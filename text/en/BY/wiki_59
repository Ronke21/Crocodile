<text>Luckenbach ( ) is an unincorporated town 13 miles (19 km) from Fredericksburg in southeastern Gillespie County, Texas, United States. Named for Carl Albert Luckenbach, son of the early settler Jacob Luckenbach, the town is known as a venue for country music and for its German-Texan heritage.

==History==
On December 15, 1847, a petition was submitted to create Gillespie County. In 1848, the Texas Legislature formed Gillespie County from Bexar and Travis Counties. 
Its oldest building is a combination general store and saloon reputedly opened in 1849 (1886 is more likely, based on land improvement records of the Texas State Library and Archives Commission) by Minna Engel, whose father was an itinerant minister from Germany. The community, first named Grape Creek, was later renamed after Engel&#x27;s husband, Carl Albert Luckenbach. They later moved to another town that became Albert, Texas. Luckenbach was first established as a community trading post, one of a few that never broke a peace treaty with the Comanche Indians, with whom they traded.

Luckenbach&#x27;s population increased to a high of 492 in 1904, but by the 1960s it was almost a ghost town.

Citizens of the town claim a resident (Jacob Brodbeck) launched the first airplane years before the Wright Brothers.

==Rebirth and fame==

A newspaper advertisement offering &quot;town — pop. 3 — for sale&quot; led actor Guich Koock, rancher-folklorist-humorist John Russell (Hondo) Crouch (1916–1976), along with rancher Kathy Morgan, to buy Luckenbach for $30,000 in 1970.

The property has been host to many unique festivals including the Luckenbach Women&#x27;s Chili Cookoff and The 1st Luckenbach World&#x27;s Fair, where Willie Nelson made a surprise appearance. In the 1990s, the town was host to several of Willie Nelson&#x27;s Fourth of July Picnics.

== Modern Luckenbach ==
Today, Luckenbach maintains a ghost-town feel with its small population and strong western aesthetic. One of its few main buildings houses the remnants of a post office, a working saloon, and a general store, while the other is the dance hall. A recent addition to the town is a new store, where guests can find top quality western apparel and &quot;Luckenbach&quot; logo shirts including merchandise featuring the town&#x27;s motto &quot;Everybody&#x27;s Somebody in Luckenbach&quot; and other memorabilia. The post office was closed on April 30, 1971, and its zip code (78647) was retired. The general store remains active as a souvenir shop.

==Geography==
It consists of between South Grape Creek (a tributary of the Pedernales River) and Snail Creek, just south of U.S. Highway 290 on the south side of Ranch to Market Road 1376. This location is roughly north of San Antonio and west of Austin. The Luckenbach website lists &quot;412 Luckenbach Town Loop, Fredericksburg, TX 78624&quot; as the physical address for GPS navigation.

===Climate===
The climate in this area is characterized by hot, humid summers and generally mild to cool winters. According to the Köppen climate classification system, Stonewall has a humid subtropical climate, &quot;Cfa&quot; on climate maps.

<doc id="710025" wikidata="Q3304472" url="?curid=710025" title="BonziBuddy">
<text>BonziBuddy ( or , stylized as BonziBUDDY) was a freeware desktop virtual assistant created by Joe and Jay Bonzi. Upon a user&#x27;s choice, it would share jokes and facts, manage downloads, sing songs, and talk, among other functions, as it used Microsoft Agent.

BonziBuddy was described as spyware and adware, and discontinued in 2004 after the company behind it faced lawsuits regarding the software and was ordered to pay fines. Bonzi&#x27;s website has remained open even after its discontinuation.

==Design==
The software used Microsoft Agent technology similar to Office Assistant, and originally sported Peedy, a green parrot and one of the characters available with Microsoft Agent. Later versions of BonziBuddy in May 2000 featured its own character: Bonzi, a purple gorilla. The program also used a text-to-speech voice to interact with the user. The voice was called Sydney and taken from an old Lernout &amp; Hauspie Microsoft Speech API 4.0 package. It is often referred to in some software as Adult Male #2.

In 2002, an article in Consumer Reports &quot;Web Watch&quot; labeled BonziBuddy as spyware, stating that it contains a backdoor trojan that collects information from users. The activities the program is said to engage in include constantly resetting the user&#x27;s web browser homepage to bonzi.com without the user&#x27;s permission, prompting and tracking various information about the user, installing a toolbar, and serving advertisements.

Trend Micro and Symantec have both classified the software as adware. &quot;Spyware Guide&quot;″s entry on the program also states that it is adware.

==Reception==
In April 2007, &quot;PC World&quot; readers voted BonziBuddy the sixth on a list named &quot;The 20 Most Annoying Tech Products&quot;. One reader was quoted as criticizing the program because it &quot;kept popping up and obscuring things you needed to see&quot;.

One of the last newspaper articles written about BonziBuddy while it was still in distribution described it as spyware and a &quot;scourge of the Internet&quot;. Another article found in 2006 on the BusinessWeek website described BonziBuddy as &quot;the unbelievably annoying spyware trojan horse&quot;.

==Lawsuits==
&quot;Internetnews.com&quot; reported the settlement of a class action suit on 27 May 2003. Originally brought against Bonzi Software on 4 December 2002, the suit accused Bonzi of using its banner advertisements to deceptively imitate Windows computer alerts, alerting the user that their IP address is being broadcast. In the settlement, Bonzi Software agreed to modify their ads so that they looked less like Windows dialog boxes and more like actual advertisements.

On February 18, 2004, the Federal Trade Commission released a statement indicating that Bonzi Software, Inc. was ordered to pay US$75,000 in fees, among other aspects, for violating the Children&#x27;s Online Privacy Protection Act by collecting personal information from children under the age of 13 with BonziBuddy.

<doc id="710027" wikidata="Q7998568" url="?curid=710027" title="Wide Awake Club">
<text>Wide Awake Club (often abbreviated to WAC) is a children&#x27;s television series that was broadcast in the United Kingdom on the breakfast television channel TV-am between 1984 and 1989.

==History==
&quot;Wide Awake Club&quot; started on Saturday 13 October 1984, broadcasting for an hour each Saturday morning at 8.30 am as TV-am&#x27;s flagship kids series. It replaced two separate shows, &quot;Data Run&quot; and &quot;SPLAT&quot; which had been created by Ragdoll&#x27;s Anne Wood then as Head of Children&#x27;s Programmes. The change to &quot;Wide Awake Club&quot; was part of cost cutting by management and was devised by producer Nick Wilson.

&quot;WAC&quot; was presented by Timmy Mallett, Arabella Warner and James Baker, with Tommy Boyd joining in February 1985 and Michaela Strachan in August 1986 – all newcomers to television, except Boyd who had previously presented &quot;Magpie&quot; and Mallett who had presented the &quot;Oxford Road Show&quot;.

The live programme combined comedy, games, celebrity guests, competitions and viewer interaction. There were also more educational features, including visiting experts such as Carol Vorderman for the science slot, and attempts to explain historical and contemporary events like the Cold War. A spelling contest, &#x27;Bonk’n’Boob&#x27; was praised by teachers for encouraging children to learn to spell properly. The show also launched the career of Mike Myers, later a major Hollywood star, who made guest appearances with Neil Mullarkey on the show for a brief time, parodying the show&#x27;s title in his segment &quot;Sound Asleep Club&quot;, in which he sported pyjamas and a &quot;bed-head&quot; hairstyle. His roles included making earrings out of spoons, tape and string, as well as making a glass of water in a cookery section.

When &quot;Wide Awake Club&quot; returned after its summer break on Saturday, 14 September 1985, the series was extended to broadcast for almost two hours from 7.30 am until 9.25 am.

The programme was so successful that it launched two spin-offs: &quot;Wacaday&quot;, a programme for holiday mornings presented solely by Timmy Mallett (joined by Terry a puppet during its first series and Michaela Strachan for later editions) that became even more successful than its parent, and &quot;WAC Extra&quot;, a Sunday morning version of the show. Both &quot;Wide Awake Club&quot; and &quot;Wacaday&quot; introduced the &quot;Wacawave&quot;, done by making a &#x27;w&#x27;, by putting one&#x27;s thumbs together, and waving.

Meanwhile, &quot;Wide Awake Club&quot; continued for many years with only minor changes to the format until 9 September 1989 when it was relaunched as &quot;WAC &#x27;90&quot;, broadcast from Granada&#x27;s studios in Manchester (as opposed to TV-am&#x27;s in London). However, the &quot;Wide Awake Club&quot; franchise continued as &quot;Wacaday&quot; until TV-am lost its franchise in 1992.

<text>Francisco José Rodríguez Sr. (born January 7, 1982), nicknamed &quot;K-Rod&quot;, is a Venezuelan former professional baseball pitcher. He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Anaheim Angels / Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim, New York Mets, Baltimore Orioles, Milwaukee Brewers and Detroit Tigers.

Rodriguez pitched for the Angels from to , and the Mets from to midway through the season. He served as the closer for both teams. Rodriguez then pitched for the Brewers until July 2013, mostly in a setup role, and for the Orioles for the rest of before returning to the Brewers for and , this time as the team&#x27;s closer. He was then traded to the Detroit Tigers in 2016, and became the Tigers&#x27; closer.

In his rookie season, Rodríguez tied Randy Johnson for the record for most victories in a single postseason, recording five wins en route to the Angels winning the World Series; Stephen Strasburg (2019) and Nathan Eovaldi (2023) later accomplished this feat as well. Rodríguez holds the major league record for saves in a single season, with 62, set in 2008 while pitching for the Angels. He is a three-time league leader in saves (2005, 2006, and 2008) and a six-time All-Star. Rodríguez is one of only eight Major League pitchers to accumulate a total of 400 or more saves in his baseball career.

==Professional career==

===Los Angeles Angels (2002–2008)===

====2002–2004====
Rodríguez signed as an undrafted amateur free agent in 1998. Originally a starting pitcher, Rodríguez moved to relief pitching in 2002 after elbow and shoulder injuries shortened his 2001 minor league season with the Lake Elsinore Storm. In 2002, he made his major league debut. At the time, he was the youngest pitcher in the American League. Because of the multiple injuries to the Angels bullpen, the club brought him up during the middle of September. He emerged as a postseason relief hero, winning five postseason games despite never having won a Major League game before. Although he threw a lively fastball, his sharp-breaking curveball was his most effective pitch, made even better in 2002 by his late season emergence and hitters lack of experience seeing such a huge 12 to 6 late break from a pitch with fastball velocity. The pitch was almost unstoppable in the 2002 postseason.

Because Rodríguez had played very little in the major leagues, hitters in the postseason had very little idea what to expect from him, a situation that often favors the pitcher. The combination of high 90&#x27;s fastball, the previously unseen high velocity late breaking curve, and the very occasional change up was too much. In the 2002 American League Division Series against the New York Yankees, he got two victories (with 1 win resulting from a blown save). The Angels won the division series against the Yankees in 4 games. During the 2002 American League Championship Series vs the Minnesota Twins, he went 2–0 with seven strikeouts in innings. The Angels won the series in 5 games. During the 2002 World Series against the San Francisco Giants, he had a 1–1 record with 13 strikeouts in innings. At 20 years, 286 days old, he became the youngest pitcher ever to win a World Series game. The Angels won the World Series in 7 games due in large part to a rookie set up man that was scheduled for and delivered 3-6 high pressure outs a game.

In 2003, Rodríguez became a setup man. He gave up an earned run in 9 of his first 15 games, but rebounded to only allow 9 in his last 44 appearances. For the 2003 year, Rodriguez made 59 appearances going 8–3 with a 3.03 ERA.

In 2004, Rodríguez was selected for the All-Star Game. On August 24, 2004, he became the sixth pitcher in the Angels&#x27; 44-year history to strike out at least 100 batters in a season without starting a game — joining Mark Clear (105 in 1980), DeWayne Buice (109, 1987), Bryan Harvey (101, 1991), Troy Percival (100, 1996), and Scot Shields (109, also in 2004). He finished the 2004 year 4–1 with 123 strikeouts and a 1.82 ERA in 69 relief appearances.

During the 2004 American League Division Series, Francisco Rodriguez had two losses as the Angels lost the division series to the Boston Red Sox in three games.

====2005–2007====
Entering the 2005 season, veteran Angels closer Troy Percival departed as a free agent which allowed Rodriguez to become the Angels&#x27; full-time closer. Rodríguez ended the season 2–5 with a 2.67 ERA in 66 relief appearances and tied the American League lead in saves with 45.

Rodriguez got his first two 2 career postseason saves during the 2005 American League Division Series as the Angels won the division series against the Yankees in 5 games. He got one save in the 2005 American League Championship Series, which the Angels lost to the Chicago White Sox in 5 games.

Rodriguez improved on his share of the 2005 American League saves title by leading the Majors in 2006 with 47 saves, one more than the National League leader Trevor Hoffman and six more than American League runner-up Bobby Jenks. On September 10 against the Toronto Blue Jays, he became the youngest closer in Major League Baseball history, at the age 24 years and 246 days, to accumulate 100 career saves. He accomplished this feat a year younger than the previous record holder, Gregg Olson. Rodriguez held this record until April 10, 2018, when Toronto Blue Jays closer Roberto Osuna acquired his 100th career save. Osuna, at the age of 23 years and 62 days, accomplished the feat about a year and a half younger than Rodriguez.
At the 2007 All-Star Game in San Francisco, Rodriguez was named as one of three Angels to represent the club, along with teammates Vladimir Guerrero and John Lackey. Rodriguez recorded the save as the American League defeated the National League, 5–4. Rodriguez finished the 2007 season 5–2 with a 1.73 ERA and 40 saves in 64 relief appearances.

In the 2007 American League Division Series against the Boston Red Sox, Rodriguez pitched only of an inning with an ERA accumulating 54.00. In Game 2 Rodriguez gave up a three-run walk-off home run to Manny Ramirez as the Red Sox won the game 6-3. The Angels eventually lost the division series to the Red Sox in just 3 games.

====2008: Single season saves record====
Rodríguez received his second career Delivery Man of the Month Award after posting 11 saves in 12 appearances during the month of June. Rodríguez set a major league record by recording his 35th save before the All-Star Break, breaking the previous record of 34 set by John Smoltz in 2003. He was a member of the American League All-Star Team for the third time and made a brief appearance in the game, facing two batters while walking one. On August 20, 2008, he set both his and the Angels single season record with his 48th save. With his 50th save on August 24, 2008, Rodríguez became the first relief pitcher to reach that number since Mariano Rivera in 2004 and the ninth overall. He was also the youngest pitcher to ever reach that number at 26 years, 7 months, and 17 days. In addition, he reached that milestone in 129 team games, faster than any pitcher in history. With three saves during the week of August 18–24, including the milestone of number 50, Rodríguez was awarded the American League Player of the Week for the first time in his career.

On September 2, 2008, Rodríguez saved his 200th career game (54th of the season), becoming the youngest player in history to reach that number. On September 10, 2008, while facing the New York Yankees, Rodríguez saved his 56th game of the season and clinched the American League Western Division title for the Angels. On September 11, 2008, while facing the Seattle Mariners, Rodríguez saved his 57th game of the season, tying Bobby Thigpen&#x27;s 1990 major league record.

On September 13, 2008, while again facing the Mariners, Rodríguez recorded his 58th save of the season, setting a new MLB record. On September 20, 2008, Rodríguez became the first pitcher to reach 60 saves in a season when he closed out a 7–3 victory against the Texas Rangers.

Rodríguez finished his record-setting 2008 regular season performance with 62 saves in 69 opportunities, appearing in an AL-leading 76 games. It was his fourth consecutive season of recording at least 40 saves. He finished third in AL Cy Young Award voting and sixth in AL Most Valuable Player Award voting.

The Angels again faced the Red Sox in the 2008 American League Division Series. Rodriguez lost a game and the Angels would lose the series to the Red Sox in four games.

===New York Mets (2009–2011)===

On December 10, 2008, Rodríguez signed a three-year, $37 million contract with the New York Mets. Rodríguez, who had worn number 57 for his entire career, switched to number 75, as Mets ace Johan Santana wore number 57 at the time. On April 6, 2009, Rodríguez recorded his first save as a Met against the Cincinnati Reds.

On May 24, 2009, Rodríguez suffered a back injury and was taken to a local Boston hospital where he was given medication for the pain. He returned to the team the next day.

He was selected to play in the 2009 All-Star game and pitched a scoreless 9th inning.

On September 30, 2009, Rodríguez surrendered a walk-off grand slam to Justin Maxwell to cap a five-run ninth inning that lifted the Washington Nationals to a 7–4 victory over the Mets. This made him the first pitcher to allow two walk-off grand slams in one season since Lee Smith did in 1995 (on August 7, Rodriguez surrendered a grand slam to Everth Cabrera with no outs to cap another five-run ninth inning that gave the San Diego Padres a 6–2 win over the Mets).
Rodríguez finished the 2009 season 3–6 with a 3.71 ERA and 35 saves converted out of 42 opportunities. It was his fifth consecutive season of 30 or more saves.

During his suspension-shortened 2010 season, Rodriguez appeared in 53 games going 4–2 with a 2.20 ERA and 25 saves.

Rodriguez started the 2011 season with 42 relief appearances going 2–2 with a 3.16 ERA and 23 saves.

===Milwaukee Brewers (2011–2013)===

On July 12, 2011, immediately following the All-Star Game, Rodríguez was traded to the Milwaukee Brewers along with cash, for Adrian Rosario and Danny Herrera. The Associated Press noted the Brewers had two potential closers in Rodríguez and their existing closer, John Axford. Rodríguez expressed his unhappiness in September to being used as the setup man to Axford. Axford finished the season with a streak of 43 consecutive save opportunities converted. In 31 games for the Brewers, Rodríguez was 4–0 with a 1.86 ERA. Overall for the 2011 season, he was 6–2 with a 2.64 ERA in 73 appearances. He had 23 saves, all with the Mets. Through 2011, he was 4th among all active pitchers in career saves (291) and games finished (445), and 8th in fielding percentage (.970).

Rodriguez made two appearances in the 2011 NLDS vs the Arizona Diamondbacks and struck out four. The Brewers won the series against the Diamondbacks in five games. He appeared in three games of the 2011 NLCS vs the St. Louis Cardinals. His ERA during the series was 3.00 and his new team of the Brewers would eventually lose the series to the Cardinals in six games.

In January 2012, Rodríguez signed a one-year, $8 million contract with the Brewers through arbitration. The Brewers again planned to have Rodríguez and Axford in the bullpen, shifting between the two depending on who has been struggling of late. In 2012, Rodriguez made a career high of 78 relief appearances going 2–7 with a 4.38 ERA and only 3 saves.

On October 29, 2012, the Brewers granted Rodriguez free agency. They re-signed him to a minor league deal on April 17, 2013 worth $2 million plus incentives if he made the major league team. After a brief stint at the Brewers&#x27; spring training complex, Rodriguez joined the Brewers. He appeared in 25 games, going 1–1 with a 1.09 ERA and 10 saves before being traded in July to the Baltimore Orioles.

===Baltimore Orioles (2013)===
On July 23, 2013, the Brewers traded Rodríguez to the Baltimore Orioles for minor league prospect Nicky Delmonico. Rodríguez struggled in his Orioles tenure, posting a 4.50 ERA in 23 appearances with the team. Overall in 2013, combined with both teams, he made 48 total relief appearances with a 3-2 record, a 2.70 ERA, and 10 saves.

===Second stint with the Brewers (2014–2015)===
On February 7, 2014, Rodríguez signed a one-year deal to return to the Milwaukee Brewers. Rodriguez was named the Brewers closer to start the 2014 season. On July 6, Rodriguez was selected as an All Star for the 5th time in his career, and the first time since 2009. On August 28, Rodriguez recorded his 1,000th career strikeout in a game against the San Diego Padres, becoming the ninth player among the Top 20 career saves leaders to also record at least 1,000 strikeouts. Rodriguez finished his 2014 campaign posting a 5–5 record with a 3.04 ERA, 73 strikeouts, and converting 44 saves in 49 opportunities. During the season, he rose to tenth place on the all-time saves list.

On February 27, 2015, the Brewers re-signed Rodriguez a two-year, $13 million deal. Milwaukee also held a club option for the 2017 season. Rodriguez would be paid $3.5 million in 2015 and $5.5 million in 2016. The deal also included a $2 million deferral and a $2 million buyout on the Brewers&#x27; 2017 club option worth $6 million. On July 6, Rodríguez was selected as an All Star for a second consecutive season and for the 6th time in his career. During the season, Rodríguez moved up three places on the all-time MLB saves list. On June 8, Rodríguez recorded his 359th career save, moving him past Troy Percival and into ninth place on the all-time list. On July 17, he recorded his 368th career save, passing Jeff Reardon for eighth place on the list. On August 19, Rodríguez recorded save number 378, passing Joe Nathan for seventh place on the all-time list, while also making him the major leagues&#x27; active career saves leader.

On September 27, Rodríguez finished his 600th career game, becoming only the 17th pitcher all time to finish 600 games. He finished the season with a 1-3 record and a 2.21 ERA. He made 55 relief appearances and had 38 saves in 40 save chances.

===Detroit Tigers (2016–2017)===
On November 18, 2015, Rodríguez was traded to the Detroit Tigers in exchange for Javier Betancourt and Manny Piña. During the 2015–16 offseason, Rodríguez contracted the Zika virus while in his native Venezuela. He said it took two months before he &quot;ultimately felt like himself again&quot; and he still felt lingering effects in spring training.

On May 24, Rodríguez recorded his 400th career save, becoming just the sixth pitcher in Major League Baseball history to reach the milestone.

On August 29, Rodríguez recorded his 423rd career save, passing Billy Wagner for fifth all-time in saves. On September 5, Rodríguez recorded his 425th career save, passing John Franco for fourth place on the all-time saves list.

Rodríguez appeared in 61 games for the 2016 Tigers, posting a 3.24 ERA with 44 saves in 49 save chances. The season saves total is the second most for a Tiger pitcher in franchise history, trailing only the 49 saves recorded by José Valverde in 2011. For the first time in his career, Rodríguez had fewer strikeouts (52) than innings pitched ().

Following the 2016 season, the Tigers exercised the $6 million club option to bring back Rodríguez for the 2017 season.

Rodríguez began the season as the Tigers closer. On May 9, 2017, manager Brad Ausmus announced that Rodríguez was being demoted from his closer role after blowing his fourth save of the young season, which included blown saves in back-to-back games on May 6 and 7. Justin Wilson replaced Rodríguez as the team&#x27;s closer. After being demoted from the closer role, Rodríguez continued to struggle, allowing seven runs in innings, including two home runs. The Tigers released Rodríguez on June 23. During the season he registered a 2–5 record with a 7.82 ERA, and 1.658 WHIP, while allowing nine home runs in innings.

===Washington Nationals===
On July 5, 2017, Rodríguez signed a minor league deal with the Washington Nationals, and was assigned to the Harrisburg Senators of the Class AA Eastern League. After pitching five innings, he was released by the Nationals on July 14.

===Philadelphia Phillies===
On January 29, 2018, Rodríguez signed a minor league deal with the Philadelphia Phillies with an invite to spring training. He was released on March 24.

===Long Island Ducks===
On April 30, 2018, Rodríguez signed with the Long Island Ducks of the independent Atlantic League of Professional Baseball. He became a free agent following the 2018 season. In 44 games 42.1 innings of relief he went 2-1 with a 2.76 ERA with 42 strikeouts and 27 saves.

===Acereros de Monclova===
On June 11, 2019, Rodríguez signed with the Acereros de Monclova of the Mexican League. He was released on July 13, 2019. In 10 games 8.1 innings of relief he went 0-0 with a 4.32 ERA and 9 strikeouts.

===Hall of Fame consideration===
Rodriguez first became eligible for the Hall of Fame in the 2023 Election. He gained 10.8% of the vote his first year. He fell to 7.8 percent in 2024, but still had enough to stay on for future elections. A player must gain 75% of the vote to be elected.

==Pitching style==
Rodríguez threw four pitches. He progressed through the minor leagues and into the major leagues throwing a hard four-seam fastball that averaged 95 mph in 2007, but the pitch settled into the 89–92 mph range through the 2016 season. He also threw a two-seam fastball at 88–91 mph. His off-speed pitches were a curveball at 76–79 mph and a changeup at 82–85 mph. He used his changeup more against left-handed hitters. It had a whiff rate of 48% since 2007, the third-highest among all changeups thrown by relief pitchers.

Rodríguez was a strikeout pitcher throughout his career, compiling an average of 10.6 strikeouts per 9 innings pitched through the 2016 season.

==Personal life==
Rodríguez&#x27;s nickname of &quot;K-Rod&quot; became popular during the 2002 playoffs. It is a play on &quot;A-Rod&quot;, the nickname of former third baseman Alex Rodriguez, with &quot;K&quot; representing the common abbreviation for strikeout. Rodríguez is a practitioner of the Santería religion. Rodríguez has competed in the 2006 and 2009 World Baseball Classic for the Venezuelan team with his former teammate Johan Santana. Rodriguez has 9 children.

===Incidents===
On June 13, 2009, New York Yankees reliever Brian Bruney criticized Rodríguez, calling his antics on the mound &quot;unbelievable&quot; and saying that Rodriguez has &quot;got a tired act&quot;, after seeing his reaction to earning a blown save in 2009 against the Yankees where teammate Luis Castillo dropped a pop-up with two outs in the ninth inning allowing the Yankees to score the winning run. Rodríguez responded by saying &quot;somebody like that, it doesn&#x27;t bother me&quot;, and suggesting that Bruney &quot;better keep his mouth shut and do his job, not worry about somebody else. I don&#x27;t even know who the guy is. I&#x27;m not going to waste my time with that guy. Instead of sending messages through the paper, next time when you see me at Citi Field, come up to me and say it to my face.&quot; During batting practice the following day Rodríguez confronted Bruney on the field, pointing and shouting at him before teammates from both sides separated the two.

In May 2010, Rodríguez and bullpen coach Randy Niemann got into a heated exchange while the pitcher was preparing to enter a game. Mets manager Jerry Manuel later said the matter was resolved, without saying what caused the dispute.

On August 11, 2010, Rodríguez was arrested after allegedly assaulting Carlos Peña, the father of his girlfriend Daian Pena, after the Mets lost a game at Citi Field. Rodríguez was reportedly upset that he made disparaging remarks about Rodríguez&#x27;s mother. Rodríguez remained in police custody at Citi Field on a charge of third-degree assault, a misdemeanor in the state of New York, and was arraigned that afternoon. He was released without bail, and ordered by a judge to stay away from his girlfriend and her father. The Mets suspended him and placed him on the team&#x27;s restricted list for two days, which meant he would forfeit two games&#x27; salary. &quot;Ownership and the organization are very disappointed in Francisco&#x27;s inappropriate behavior and we take the matter very seriously&quot;, team chief operating officer Jeff Wilpon said. Rodríguez suffered a torn ligament in his right thumb, possibly during the altercation, requiring season-ending surgery. The Mets suspended Rodríguez indefinitely, preventing him from attending or performing any activity with the team, as well as having his pay suspended until he was physically able to perform again. On September 22, 2010, Rodriguez was back in Queens Criminal Court facing seven counts of criminal contempt after sending numerous text messages to Daian Pena in violation of the order of protection. The judge imposed bail of $7,500, which Rodriguez posted.

Rodriguez was charged with domestic violence in Wisconsin relating to a September 17, 2012, incident in which he allegedly hit and kicked the mother of his child. He was facing a fine of $10,000 and/or up to 9 months in prison. Charges were subsequently dropped against Rodriguez when the victim and another witness, a housekeeper, both returned to Venezuela and did not respond to the district attorney on the case.

<text>Skylab 4 (also SL-4 and SLM-3) was the third crewed Skylab mission and placed the third and final crew aboard the first American space station.

The mission began on November 16, 1973, with the launch of Gerald P. Carr, Edward Gibson, and William R. Pogue in an Apollo command and service module on a Saturn IB rocket from the Kennedy Space Center, Florida, and lasted 84 days, one hour and 16 minutes. A total of 6,051 astronaut-utilization hours were tallied by the Skylab 4 astronauts performing scientific experiments in the areas of medical activities, solar observations, Earth resources, observation of the Comet Kohoutek and other experiments.

The crewed Skylab missions were officially designated Skylab 2, 3, and 4. Miscommunication about the numbering resulted in the mission emblems reading &quot;Skylab I&quot;, &quot;Skylab II&quot;, and &quot;Skylab 3&quot; respectively.

==Launch==

NASA&#x27;s launch center was located in an area called Cape Kennedy since November 28, 1963. Cape Kennedy was restored to its former name of Cape Canaveral officially on October 9, 1973. The Saturn V launch facilities at LC-39A and LC-39B were still located at the Kennedy Space Center on Merritt Island. The Skylab 4 mission was the first crewed launch since the area changed its name back to Cape Canaveral; it launched from the Kennedy Space Center&#x27;s LC-39B pad on November 16, 1973.

==Crew==
With three rookies, Skylab 4 was the largest all-rookie crew launched by NASA. Following the all rookie Mercury program, there were only four all-rookie NASA flights – Gemini 4, Gemini 7, Gemini 8, and Skylab 4.

==Mission highlights==


The all-rookie astronaut crew arrived aboard Skylab to find three figures dressed in flight suits. Upon closer inspection, they found they were dummies with Skylab 4 mission emblems and name tags which had been left there by Al Bean, Jack Lousma, and Owen Garriott at the end of Skylab 3.

Things got off to a bad start after the crew attempted to hide Pogue&#x27;s early space sickness from flight surgeons, a fact discovered by mission controllers after downloading onboard voice recordings. Astronaut office chief Alan B. Shepard reprimanded them for this omission, saying they &quot;had made a fairly serious error in judgement.&quot;

The crew had problems adjusting to the same workload level as their predecessors when activating the workshop. The crew&#x27;s initial task of unloading and stowing the thousands of items needed for their lengthy mission also proved to be overwhelming. The schedule for the activation sequence dictated lengthy work periods with a large variety of tasks to be performed, and the crew soon found themselves tired and behind schedule.

Seven days into their mission, a problem developed in the Skylab gyroscopic attitude control system, which threatened to bring an early end to the mission. Skylab depended upon three large gyroscopes, sized so that any two of them could provide sufficient control and maneuver Skylab as desired. The third acted as a backup in the event of failure of one of the others. The gyroscope failure was attributed to insufficient lubrication. Later in the mission, a second gyroscope showed similar problems, but special temperature control and load reduction procedures kept the second one operating, and no further problems occurred.

On Thanksgiving Day, Gibson and Pogue accomplished a 6 hour spacewalk. The first part of their spacewalk was spent deploying experiments and replacing film in the solar observatory. The remainder of the time was used to repair a malfunctioning antenna. During the experience, Gibson remarked, &quot;Boy if this isn&#x27;t the great outdoors! Inside, you&#x27;re just looking out through a window. Here, you&#x27;re right in it.&quot; The crew reported that the food was good, but slightly bland. The quantity and type of food consumed was rigidly controlled because of their strict diet. Although the crew would have preferred to use more condiments to enhance the taste of the food, and the amount of salt they could use was restricted for medical purposes, by the third mission the NASA kitchen had increased the availability of condiments, and salt and pepper were in liquid solutions (granular salt and pepper brought aboard by the second crew was little more than &quot;air pollution&quot;).

On December 13, the crew sighted Comet Kohoutek and trained the solar observatory and hand-held cameras on it. They gathered spectra on it using the Far Ultraviolet Camera/Spectrograph. They continued to photograph it as it approached the Sun. On December 30, as it swept out from behind the Sun, Carr and Gibson spotted it as they were performing a spacewalk.

As Skylab work progressed, the astronauts complained of being pushed too hard, and ground controllers complained they were not getting enough work done. NASA determined major contributing factors were a large number of new tasks added shortly before launch with little or no training, and searches for equipment out of place on the station. There was a radio conference to air frustrations which led to the workload schedule being modified, and by the end of their mission the crew had completed more work than originally planned.

Skylab 4 involved several scientific observations. The crew spent many hours studying the Earth. Carr and Pogue alternately crewed controls, operating the sensing devices which measured and photographed selected features on the Earth&#x27;s surface. Gibson and the other crew made solar observations, recording about 75,000 new telescopic images of the Sun. Images were taken in the X-ray, ultraviolet, and visible portions of the spectrum.

As the end of their mission drew closer, Gibson continued his watch of the solar surface. On January 21, 1974, an active region on the Sun&#x27;s surface formed a bright spot which intensified and grew. Gibson quickly began filming the sequence as the bright spot erupted. This film was the first recording from space of the birth of a solar flare.

The crew also photographed the Earth from orbit. Despite instructions not to do so, the crew (perhaps inadvertently) photographed Area 51, causing a minor dispute between various government agencies as to whether the photographs showing this secret facility should be released. In the end, the picture was published along with all others in NASA&#x27;s Skylab image archive, but remained unnoticed for years.

The Skylab 4 astronauts completed 1,214 Earth orbits and four EVAs totaling 22 hours, 13 minutes. They traveled 34.5 million miles (55,500,000 km) in 84 days, 1 hour and 16 minutes in space. Skylab 4 was the last Skylab mission; the station fell from orbit in 1979.

The three astronauts had joined NASA in the mid-1960s, during the Apollo program, with Pogue and Carr becoming part of the likely crew for the cancelled Apollo 19. Ultimately none of the crew of Skylab 4 flew in space again, as none of the three were selected for Apollo–Soyuz and all of them retired from NASA before the first Space Shuttle launch. Gibson, who had trained as a scientist-astronaut, resigned from NASA in December 1974 to do research on Skylab solar physics data, as a senior staff scientist with The Aerospace Corporation of Los Angeles, California.

==Communications break==
An unplanned communications break occurred during the Skylab 4 mission: its crew did not communicate with mission control for the portion of one orbit during which Skylab had line of sight to its tracking stations. Before the midpoint of the mission, the Skylab 4 crew had started to become fatigued and behind on the work. In order to catch up, they decided that only one crew member needed to be present for the daily briefing instead of all three, allowing the other two to complete ongoing tasks. At one point, according to both Carr and Gibson, the crew forgot to turn their radios on for the daily briefing, leading to a lack of communications between the crew and ground control during that orbit&#x27;s period of communications availability. By the next planned period, the crew had reaffirmed radio contact with ground control. Both Carr and Gibson stated that this event partially contributed to a discussion on December 30, 1973, in which the crew and ground control capsule communicator Richard H. Truly revisited the astronauts&#x27; schedule in light of their fatigue. Carr called this meeting &quot;the first sensitivity session in space&quot;. NASA agreed to assign the crew a more relaxed schedule, and productivity for the remaining mission significantly increased, surpassing that of the prior Skylab 3 mission.

===Consequences===

NASA spent time studying the causes and effects of the unintentional lack of communications to avoid its replication in future missions. At the time, only the crew of Skylab 3 had spent six weeks in space. It was unknown what had happened psychologically. NASA carefully worked with crew&#x27;s requests, reducing their workload for the next six weeks. The incident took NASA into an unknown realm of concern in the selection of astronauts, still a question as humanity considers human missions to Mars or returning to the Moon. Among the complicating factors was the interplay between management and subordinates. On Skylab 4, one problem was that the crew was pushed even harder as they fell behind on their workload, creating an increasing level of stress. Even though none of the astronauts returned to space, there was only one more NASA spaceflight in the decade and Skylab was the first and last American space station. NASA was planning larger space stations but its budget shrank considerably after the Moon landings, and the Skylab orbital workshop was the only major execution of Apollo Applications projects.

The final Skylab mission became known for the incident, and also known for the large amount of work that was accomplished in the long mission. Skylab orbited for six more years before its orbit decayed in 1979 due to solar activity that was higher than expected. The next crewed U.S. spaceflights were the Apollo–Soyuz Test Project in July 1975, then the first Space Shuttle orbital flight STS-1 in April 1981.

The event, which the involved astronauts have joked about, has been a case study in various fields of endeavor including space medicine, team management, and psychology. According to &quot;Space Safety Magazine&quot;, the incident affected the planning of future space missions, especially long-term missions.

The described events were considered a significant example of &quot;us versus them&quot; syndrome in space medicine. Crew psychology has been a point of study for Mars analog missions such as Mars-500, with a particular focus on crew behavior triggering a mission failure or other issues. One of the impacts of the incident is the requirement that at least one member of the International Space Station crew be a space veteran (not be on a first flight).

The 84-day stay of the Skylab 4 mission was a human spaceflight record that was not exceeded for over two decades by a NASA astronaut. The 96-day Soviet Salyut 6 EO-1 mission broke Skylab 4&#x27;s record in 1978.

===In the media===

The communications failure has been interpreted by the media as a deliberate act and became known as the Skylab strike or Skylab mutiny. One of the first accounts reporting that a strike aboard Skylab had occurred was published in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; on August 22, 1976, by Henry S. F. Cooper, who claimed that the crew were alleged to have stopped working on December 28, 1973. Cooper also published similar claims in his book &quot;A House in Space&quot; that same year. The Harvard Business School published a 1980 report, &quot;Strike in Space&quot;, also claiming that the astronauts had gone on strike, but without citing any sources.

NASA, the astronauts involved, and spaceflight historians have stated that no strike occurred. NASA has suggested the events of December 28 may have been confused with a day off that was given to the crew on December 26 following the completion of a long spacewalk by Carr and Pogue the day before. NASA added that there may also have been confusion with a known ground equipment failure on December 25; this left them unable to track Skylab for one orbit, but the crew were notified of this issue ahead of time. Both Carr and Gibson have stated that it was a series of misjudgments and not the crew&#x27;s intent that caused them to miss the briefing. Spaceflight history author David Hitt also disputed that the crew deliberately ended contact with mission control, in a book written with former astronauts Owen K. Garriott and Joseph P. Kerwin.

==Command Module legacy==

The Skylab 4 command module was transferred to the National Air and Space Museum in 1975. This module is the Command and Service Modules CSM-118 and it spent 84 days in Earth orbit as part of the Skylab mission. 

The module rolled upside down after splashdown, which happened in about half the Apollo CSM splashdowns; in this situation spheres were inflated on top of the CSM to right the module.

The windows of the Skylab 3 and 4 spacecraft modules were studied for micrometeoroid impacts.

The module was painted white on half its side to help with spacecraft thermal management. Whereas Block II Apollo CSM had Kapton coated with aluminium and silicon monoxide, later Skylab modules had white paint for the sunward side.

The Skylab 4 Command Module held the record for the longest single spaceflight for an American spacecraft for nearly 50 years until it was broken by Crew Dragon Resilience flying the SpaceX Crew-1 mission on February 7, 2021. To commemorate the event, the four person crew of Crew-1 spoke live with Edward Gibson from the International Space Station.

As of September 2020 the capsule is on display at the Oklahoma History Center.

==Mission insignia==
The triangular emblem features a large number &quot;3&quot; and a rainbow circling three areas of study the astronauts pursued. At the time of the flight, the astronauts issued the following description:

&quot;The symbols in the patch refer to the three major areas of investigation in the mission. The tree represents man&#x27;s natural environment and refers to the objective of advancing the study of earth resources. The hydrogen atom, as the basic building block of the universe, represents man&#x27;s exploration of the physical world, his application of knowledge, and his development of technology. Since the sun is composed primarily of hydrogen, the hydrogen symbol also refers to the Solar Physics mission objectives. The human silhouette represents mankind and the human capacity to direct technology with a wisdom tempered by his regard for his natural environment. It also relates to the Skylab medical studies of man himself. The rainbow, adopted from the Biblical story of the Flood, symbolizes the promise that is offered to man. It embraces man and extends to the tree and hydrogen atom, emphasizing man&#x27;s pivotal role in the conciliation of technology with nature by a humanistic application of our scientific knowledge.&quot;

Some versions of the patch included a comet in the top curve because of studies made of the comet Kohoutek.

<text>This list of schools in Waterloo Region shows the colleges and universities, secondary schools, and elementary schools based in the Regional Municipality of Waterloo, Ontario, Canada.

Currently, four school boards operate in Waterloo Region. Public schools with instruction in English are operated by the Waterloo Region District School Board and public schools with instruction in French are operated by the Conseil scolaire de district du Centre-Sud-Ouest. Catholic schools with instruction in English are operated by the Waterloo Catholic District School Board and those with instruction in French are operated by the Conseil scolaire de district catholique Centre-Sud.

There are plans to construct a new French public secondary school in the region that will be part of the Conseil scolaire Viamonde; currently, there are no French public secondary schools in the region and public school students must travel to Hamilton in order to receive their education in French at the secondary school level.

<doc id="710043" wikidata="Q3404257" url="?curid=710043" title="Privatisation of British Rail">
<text>The privatisation of British Rail was the process by which ownership and operation of the railways of Great Britain passed from government control into private hands. Begun in 1994, the process was largely completed by 1997. The deregulation of the industry was in part motivated by the enactment of EU Directive 91/440 in 1991, which aimed to create a more efficient railway network by creating greater competition.

British Railways (BR) had been in state ownership since 1948, under the control of the British Railways Board (BRB). Under the Conservative government of Margaret Thatcher elected in 1979, various state-owned businesses were gradually sold off, including various auxiliary and supporting functions related to the railways – Sealink ferries and British Transport Hotels by 1984, Travellers Fare catering by 1988 and British Rail Engineering Limited (train manufacturing) by 1989.

It was under Thatcher&#x27;s successor John Major that the railways themselves were privatised. Under the Railways Act 1993, the operations of the BRB were broken up and sold off to various parties while various regulatory functions transferred to the newly created office of the Rail Regulator. Ownership of the infrastructure, including the larger stations, passed to the new privately owned company Railtrack, while track maintenance and renewal assets were sold to 13 companies across the network. Ownership of the passenger trains themselves passed to three rolling stock companies (ROSCOs) – the stock being leased out to passenger train operating companies (TOCs) awarded contracts through a new system of rail franchising overseen by the Office of Passenger Rail Franchising (OPRAF). Ownership and operation of rail freight in Great Britain passed to two companies – English Welsh &amp; Scottish (EWS) and Freightliner, less than the originally intended six, although numerous new entrants in the sector have since appeared.

The privatisation of the railways was very controversial at the time, and still is, and the impact of this policy is hotly debated. Despite opposition from the Labour Party, who gained power in 1997 under Tony Blair, the process has never been reversed wholesale by any later government, and the system has remained largely unaltered. During the late 2010s, it was announced that a transition towards Great British Railways, a contract-based model to replace the franchise system, would be undertaken. A significant change came in 2001 with the collapse of Railtrack, which saw its assets passed to the state-owned Network Rail (NR), while track maintenance was also brought in-house under NR in 2004. The regulatory structures have also been amended subsequently.

==Background==

===To 1979===
Historically, the pre-nationalisation railway companies were almost entirely self-sufficient, including, for example, the production of the steel used in the manufacturing of rolling stock and rails. As a consequence of the nationalisation of the railways in 1948 some of these activities had been hived off to other nationalised industries and institutions, e.g. &quot;Railway Air Services Limited&quot; was one of the forerunners of British Airways; the railways&#x27; road transport services, which had carried freight, parcels and passengers&#x27; luggage to and from railheads, ultimately became part of the National Freight Corporation, but this transfer did not occur until 1969.

The preferred organisational structure in the 1970s was for the BRB to form wholly owned subsidiaries which were run at an arm&#x27;s-length relationship, e.g. the railway engineering works became British Rail Engineering Limited (BREL) in 1970; the ferry operations to Ireland, France, Belgium and the Netherlands were run by Sealink, part of the Sealink consortium, which also used ferries owned by the French national railway SNCF, the Belgian Maritime Transport Authority Regie voor maritiem transport/Regie des transports maritimes (RMT/RTM), and the Dutch Zeeland Steamship Company. However, the BRB was still directly responsible for a multitude of other functions, such as the British Transport Police, the British Rail Property Board (which was responsible not just for operational track and property, but also for thousands of miles of abandoned tracks and stations arising from the Beeching cuts and other closure programmes), a staff savings bank, convalescent homes for rail staff, and the internal railway telephone and data comms networks (the largest in the country after British Telecom&#x27;s), etc.

By 1979, the organisational structure of the BRB&#x27;s railway operations still largely reflected that of the Big Four British railway companies, which had been merged to create British Railways over 30 years previously. There were five Regions (Scotland being a separate region), each region being formed of several Divisions, and each division of several Areas. There was some duplication of resources in this structure, and in the early 1980s, the divisional layer of management was abolished with its work being redistributed either upwards to the regions or downwards to the areas.

===1980s===
The chain of British Transport Hotels was sold off, mainly one hotel at a time, during 1982. Two years later, Sealink was sold to Sea Containers, who ultimately sold the routes to their current owner, Stena Line. In 1988, catering business Travellers Fare was divested via a private equity-backed management buyout. That same year, British Rail Engineering Limited was split between the major engineering works, which became BREL (1988) Ltd and the (mostly smaller) works that were used for day-to-day maintenance of rolling stock, which became British Rail Maintenance Limited. BREL (1988) Ltd was sold to a consortium of ASEA Brown-Boveri and Trafalgar House in 1989. In 1992, ABB Transportation took full ownership before the unit was merging with Daimler-Benz&#x27;s train manufacturing interests to form Adtranz in January 1996. Daimler-Benz subsequently took 100% ownership of Adtranz in 1998 before selling it to Bombardier in May 2001.

For reasons of efficiency and to reduce the amount of subsidy required from the government, British Rail undertook a comprehensive organisational restructuring in the late 1980s. The new management structure was based on business sectors rather than geographical regions, and first manifested itself in 1982 with the creation of Railfreight, the BRB&#x27;s freight operation, and InterCity, though the Inter-City branding had been carried on coaching stock since the early 1970s. Commuter services in the south-east came under the London &amp; South East sector, which would become Network SouthEast in 1986. Services in Scotland were operated by ScotRail, while Provincial sector handled local and rural routes. The regional management structure continued in parallel for a few years before it was abolished. Sectorisation was generally regarded within the industry as a great success, and it was to have a considerable effect on the way in which privatisation would be carried out.

During 1985, what may in retrospect be viewed as the harbinger of private rail operation occurred when the quarry company Foster Yeoman bought a small number of extremely powerful 3600 hp locomotives from General Motors&#x27; Electro-Motive Diesel division (GM-EMD), designated Class 59, to operate mineral trains from their quarry in Wiltshire. Although owned and maintained by Foster Yeoman, the Class 59s were manned by British Rail staff. During acceptance trials, on 16 February 1986, locomotive 59001 hauled a train weighing 4639 tonnes – the heaviest load ever hauled by a single non-articulated traction unit. Foster Yeoman&#x27;s Class 59s proved to be extremely reliable, and it was not long before quarry company ARC and privatised power generator National Power also bought small numbers of Class 59s to haul their own trains.

During 1986, discussions were held with Sea Containers that touched on the business possibilities for the break up of British Rail, particularly on the possible takeover of the railway on the Isle of Wight by he company. However, the discussions proved abortive.

In Sweden, the Swedish State Railways was split into two in 1988, creating the Swedish Rail Administration to control the rail infrastructure, and SJ to operate the trains. This restructuring was the first time that a national railway had been divided up in this manner; one of the advantages of this arrangement was that it allowed for local county authorities to tender the provision of local passenger services to the new train operators that appeared. The Swedish system appeared to be very successful initially, although some train operators subsequently went bankrupt. The Swedish experiment was watched with great interest in various other countries during the 1980s and 1990s.

The narrow gauge Vale of Rheidol Railway in Aberystwyth, Mid Wales was unique in Britain, being the only steam railway to be operated by British Rail. During 1988, the Department of Transport started the process of privatising the line. Later that year, it was announced the line had been purchased by the owners of Brecon Mountain Railway, becoming the first part of British Rail to be privatised.

===1990s===
During 1991, following the partly-successful Swedish example and wishing to create an environment where new rail operators could enter the market, the European Union issued EU Directive 91/440. This required of all EU member states to separate &quot;the management of railway operation and infrastructure from the provision of railway transport services, separation of accounts being compulsory and organisational or institutional separation being optional&quot;, the idea being that the track operator would charge the train operator a transparent fee to run its trains over the network, and anyone else could also run trains under the same conditions (open access).
In Britain, Margaret Thatcher was forced out as leader of the Conservative Party and succeeded by John Major at the end of 1990. The Thatcher administration had already sold off nearly all the former state-owned industries, apart from the national rail network. Although the previous Transport Secretary Cecil Parkinson had advocated some form of privately or semi-privately operated rail network, this was deemed &quot;a privatisation too far&quot; by Thatcher herself. In its manifesto for the 1992 general election the Conservatives included a commitment to privatise the railways, but were not specific about how this objective was to be achieved. The manifesto claimed that &quot;The best way to produce profound and lasting improvements on the railways is to end BR&#x27;s state monopoly,&quot; although according to &quot;The Independent&quot;, &quot;many – including within the Tory party – believed that privatisation was merely a mechanism to manage the industry&#x27;s gradual decline without too heavy a burden on the taxpayer.&quot;

Contrary to opinion polls, the Conservatives won the election in April 1992 and consequently had to develop a plan to carry out the privatisation before the Railways Bill was published the next year. The management of British Rail strongly advocated privatisation as one entity, a British Rail plc in effect; Cabinet Minister John Redwood &quot;argued for regional companies in charge of track and trains&quot; but Prime Minister John Major did not back his view; the Treasury, under the influence of the Adam Smith Institute think tank advocated the creation of seven, later 25, passenger railway franchises as a way of maximising revenue. In this instance, it was the Treasury view that prevailed.

==Legislation==

As a precursor to the main legislation, the British Coal and British Rail (Transfer Proposals) Act 1993 was passed on 19 January 1993. This legislation gave the Secretary of State the power to issue directions to the BRB to sell assets, something which the board was unable to do until then.

The Railways Bill, published in 1993, established a complex structure for the rail industry. British Rail was to be broken up into over 100 separate companies, with most relationships between the successor companies established by contracts, some through regulatory mechanisms (such as the industry-wide network code and the multi-bilateral star model performance regime). Contracts for the use of railway facilities – track, stations and light maintenance depots – must be approved or directed by the Office of Rail &amp; Road, although some facilities are exempt from this requirement. Contracts between the principal passenger train operators and the state are called franchise agreements, and were first established with the Office of Passenger Rail Franchising (OPRAF), then its successor the Strategic Rail Authority and now with the Secretary of State for Transport.

The passage of the Railways Bill was controversial. The public was largely unconvinced of the virtues of rail privatisation and there was much lobbying against the Bill. The Labour Party was implacably opposed to it and promised to renationalise the railways when they got back into office as and when resources allowed. The Conservative chairman of the House of Commons Transport Committee, Robert Adley famously described the Bill as &quot;a poll tax on wheels&quot;; however Adley was known to be a rail enthusiast and his advice was discounted. Adley died suddenly before the Bill completed its passage through Parliament.

The Railways Bill became the Railways Act 1993 on 5 November 1993, and the organisational structure dictated by it came into effect on 1 April 1994. Initially, British Rail was broken up into various units frequently based on its own organisational sectors (Train Operating Units, Infrastructure Maintenance Units, etc. - for more details see below) still controlled by the British Railways Board, but which were sold over the next few years.

==Domestic system==
===As implemented===
The original privatisation structure, created over the three years from 1 April 1994, consisted of passing ownership and operation of the railway to a variety of private companies, regulated by two public offices, Rail Regulator and Director of Passenger Rail Franchising. A newly created company, Railtrack, would be the privately-owned infrastructure owner, which would subcontract work to various other companies to perform maintenance. Various other companies would lease and/or operate trains.

In preparation for full privatisation, BR was split up into various parts. Provision of passenger services was split up into twenty-five passenger train operating units (TOUs), known as shadow franchises, split by geographical area and service type. For freight services, six freight operating companies (FOCs) were created - three geographical units for trainload freight (Mainline Freight in the south-east, Loadhaul in the north-east and Transrail in the west), plus Railfreight Distribution for international and wagonload trains, Freightliner for container-carrying trains, and Rail Express Systems for parcels and mail trains. British Rail Infrastructure Services (BRIS) took responsibility for the engineering requirements of the railway. BRIS was subsequently organised for privatisation on the basis of seven infrastructure maintenance units (IMUs), which maintained the railway, and six track renewal units (TRUs), which replaced rail lines, both organised geographically.

Railtrack was the first company created; it took over ownership of all track, signalling and stations. Railtrack proceeded to let out most of the 2,509 stations to the franchised passenger train operators, managing only a handful (twelve, later seventeen) of the largest city termini itself. Since maintenance and renewal of the infrastructure was to be sub-contracted (to the private purchasers of the IMUs and TRUs), Railtrack&#x27;s directly employed staff consisted mostly of signallers. Railtrack sourced its revenue from track access charges levied on train operators as well as leases of stations and depots; additional funding would come from the British government. The company would spend its finances mostly on the railway network in accordance with plans laid out by the rail regulator.

Three newly created rolling stock leasing companies (ROSCOs) (Angel Trains, Eversholt Rail Group and Porterbrook) were allocated all British Rail&#x27;s passenger coaches, locomotives, and multiple units. Completion of the privatisation process involved converting the passenger TOUs to train operating companies (TOCs) through the process of franchising, performed in the first instance on a &quot;lowest-cost bidder wins&quot; basis. Freight locomotives and wagons were not passed to ROSCOs, instead being owned directly by the freight train operators. Full privatisation of the freight operators saw five being bought immediately by a consortium led by the Wisconsin Central Transportation Corporation and merged into what became known as the English Welsh &amp; Scottish (EWS) (now DB Cargo UK), leaving just Freightliner as the only other ex-BR freight business to be privatised to someone other than EWS.

The Rail Regulator (the statutory officer at the head of the Office of the Rail Regulator (ORR)) was established to regulate the monopoly and dominant elements of the railway industry, and to police certain consumer protection conditions of operators&#x27; licences. The Regulator did this through powers to supervise and control the consumption of capacity of railway facilities (his approval was needed before an access contract for the use of track, stations or certain maintenance facilities could be valid), to enforce domestic competition law, to issue, modify and enforce operating licences and to supervise the development of certain industry-wide codes, the most important of which is the network code. ORR&#x27;s role only covered economic regulation; crucially reviewing every five years the access charges Railtrack could charge train operators for the operation, maintenance, renewal and enhancement of the national railway network. Safety regulation remained the responsibility of the Health &amp; Safety Executive. The first Rail Regulator was John Swift.

The Director of Passenger Rail Franchising took responsibility for organising the franchising process to transfer the 25 TOUs to the private sector and then develop the re-franchising programme for the future. The first Director of Passenger Rail Franchising was Roger Salmon.

===Subsequent changes===
Post-privatisation, the structure of the railways has remained largely the same, and the system is still based on competition between private operators who pay for access to the infrastructure provider and lease rolling stock from the ROSCOs.

A major change has been in the actual owner of the infrastructure. The aftermath of the Hatfield rail crash in 2000 led to severe financial difficulties for Railtrack. Just under a year later, the company was put into a special kind of insolvency by the High Court in England at the direction of the government. The circumstances of this action were controversial, and eventually led to the largest class action lawsuit in British legal history. The administration led to instability in its share price, and on 2 October 2002 a new organisation, Network Rail, bought Railtrack. Network Rail has no shareholders and is a company limited by guarantee, nominally in the private sector but with members instead of shareholders and its borrowing guaranteed by the government. During 2004, Network Rail took back direct control of the maintenance of the track, signalling and overhead lines, although track renewal remained contracted out to the private sector.

Management of the passenger franchising system has also changed; during 2001, the functions of the Director of Passenger Rail Franchising were replaced by the Strategic Rail Authority (SRA), whose remit also included the promotion of freight services. Five years later, the SRA was in turn abolished in favour of direct control by the Department of Transport&#x27;s Rail Group. Overall, the system of franchising has proceeded as designed, with franchises being either retained or transferred dependent on performance. On nine occasions to date, passenger franchises have had to be taken into (indirect) government ownership, South Eastern Trains (2003–2006), East Coast (2009–2015), London North Eastern Railway (2018–present), Northern Trains (2020–present), Transport for Wales Rail (2021-present), Southeastern (2021-present), ScotRail (2022-present), TransPennine Express (2023-present), and Caledonian Sleeper (2023-present). Over time, some franchises have been merged and contract lengths have been extended; additionally, under the devolution programme, other government bodies have been given input into franchise terms – the Scottish Government with ScotRail, the Welsh Government in Wales &amp; Borders, as well as the Mayor of London and the various passenger transport executives for the services in their respective areas. Since 2005, the Department for Transport has been using the community railway designation to loosen the regulations and lower the costs and increase usage of certain socially necessary routes and services, although these remain within the TOC structure.

In both the freight and passenger sectors, a small number of open access operators (non-franchised operators of trains) have also emerged (some of which have since closed down). In terms of train ownership, the three ROSCOs continue to exist as originally established, although some now lease freight locomotives and wagons to the FOCs. They have also been joined by a variety of new leasing entities, including spot-hire companies offering short-term leases, as well as small-scale train owners offering to lease their private rolling stock. Furthermore, some operators, such as Network Rail, have also purchased some rolling stock themselves.

The regulatory structure has also evolved; in line with changes to the regulation of other privatised industries, the position of Rail Regulator was abolished in 2004, replaced by a nine-member corporate board called the Office of Rail Regulation, incorporating responsibility for safety regulation, previously the remit of the Health &amp; Safety Executive.

== Channel Tunnel infrastructure and services ==

Privatisation of British Rail occurred at the same time as the Channel Tunnel project linking Great Britain with France reached completion, with the tunnel itself being officially opened on 6 May 1994. Key parts of the project were a passenger rail service through the tunnel, dubbed Eurostar, and the building of a new high-speed railway on the British side, the 109-kilometre (68 mile) Channel Tunnel Rail Link (CTRL), to link the tunnel to London.

With the CTRL still at the planning stage, Eurostar trains began operating on 14 November 1994 over the existing railway, with operations on the British sections of the track being done by European Passenger Services (EPS), a subsidiary set up by British Rail. To manage construction of the CTRL, British Rail had also set up another subsidiary, Union Railways. In 1996, in line with the rest of the privatisation process, the government signed a contract with the private company London &amp; Continental Railways (LCR) to build the CTRL, and as part of that deal LCR became the owner of both EPS and Union Railways; LCR renamed EPS as Eurostar thus ending British Rail&#x27;s input in the project.

As the project progressed, due to financial difficulties both LCR and its subsidiaries underwent various changes in financing, structure and planning, with the government and Railtrack (later Network Rail) becoming involved in the various plans and projects. In 2007, the second stage of the CTRL was finally completed (the CTRL being rebranded at that point as High Speed 1 (HS1). By 2009 the government had assumed full control of LCR, announcing its intention to privatise it to recoup its investment; this was achieved in two stages, with the 2010 sale of a 30-year concession to own and operate HS1, and the 2015 sale of the British stake in the Eurostar operator (renamed in 2009 to Eurostar International Limited, EIL).

Through a subsidiary established in 2003, Network Rail is the maintainer of the infrastructure of HS1. Domestic passenger services are operated on parts of HS1 as part of the Integrated Kent Franchise, these commenced in 2009, operated by Southeastern.

== Impact ==
The impact of privatisation has been debated by the public, media and the rail industry ever since the process was completed. Whether to renationalise or otherwise make major changes to the post-privatisation model is an ever-present detail in the election manifestos of British political parties.

Stated benefits of privatisation include improved customer service, and more investment; and stated drawbacks include higher fares, lower punctuality and increased rail subsidies.

The major topics of debate concern whether the process has achieved its central aims of increasing levels of investment, performance, and customer satisfaction while reducing the cost to the taxpayer through rail subsidies. Safety also became a major issue after the Hatfield rail crash in 2000 and the Potters Bar rail crash in 2002 exposed flaws in the post-privatisation maintenance regimes.

<doc id="710045" wikidata="Q901321" url="?curid=710045" title="Pulsed laser deposition">
<text>Pulsed laser deposition (PLD) is a physical vapor deposition (PVD) technique where a high-power pulsed laser beam is focused inside a vacuum chamber to strike a target of the material that is to be deposited. This material is vaporized from the target (in a plasma plume) which deposits it as a thin film on a substrate (such as a silicon wafer facing the target). This process can occur in ultra high vacuum or in the presence of a background gas, such as oxygen which is commonly used when depositing oxides to fully oxygenate the deposited films.

While the basic setup is simple relative to many other deposition techniques, the physical phenomena of laser-target interaction and film growth are quite complex (see Process below). When the laser pulse is absorbed by the target, energy is first converted to electronic excitation and then into thermal, chemical and mechanical energy resulting in evaporation, ablation, plasma formation and even exfoliation. The ejected species expand into the surrounding vacuum in the form of a plume containing many energetic species including atoms, molecules, electrons, ions, clusters, particulates and molten globules, before depositing on the typically hot substrate.

==Process==

The detailed mechanisms of PLD are very complex including the ablation process of the target material by the laser irradiation, the development of a plasma plume with high energetic ions, electrons as well as neutrals and the crystalline growth of the film itself on the heated substrate. The process of PLD can generally be divided into four stages:

*Laser absorption on the target surface and laser ablation of the target material and creation of a plasma
*Dynamic of the plasma
*Deposition of the ablation material on the substrate
*Nucleation and growth of the film on the substrate surface

Each of these steps is crucial for the crystallinity, uniformity and stoichiometry of the resulting film. 

===Laser ablation of the target material and creation of a plasma===

The ablation of the target material upon laser irradiation and the creation of plasma are very complex processes. The removal of atoms from the bulk material is done by vaporization of the bulk at the surface region in a state of non-equilibrium. In this the incident laser pulse penetrates into the surface of the material within the penetration depth. This dimension is dependent on the laser wavelength and the index of refraction of the target material at the applied laser wavelength and is typically in the region of 10 nm for most materials. The strong electrical field generated by the laser light is sufficiently strong to remove the electrons from the bulk material of the penetrated volume. This process occurs within 10 ps of a ns laser pulse and is caused by non-linear processes such as multiphoton ionization which are enhanced by microscopic cracks at the surface, voids, and nodules, which increase the electric field. The free electrons oscillate within the electromagnetic field of the laser light and can collide with the atoms of the bulk material thus transferring some of their energy to the lattice of the target material within the surface region. The surface of the target is then heated up and the material is vaporized.

===Dynamic of the plasma===

In the second stage the material expands in a plasma parallel to the normal vector of the target surface towards the substrate due to Coulomb repulsion and recoil from the target surface. The spatial distribution of the plume is dependent on the background pressure inside the PLD chamber. The density of the plume can be described by a cosn(x) law with a shape similar to a Gaussian curve. The dependency of the plume shape on the pressure can be described in three stages: 
*The vacuum stage, where the plume is very narrow and forward directed; almost no scattering occurs with the background gases.
*The intermediate region where a splitting of the high energetic ions from the less energetic species can be observed. The time-of-flight (TOF) data can be fitted to a shock wave model; however, other models could also be possible.
*High pressure region where we find a more diffusion-like expansion of the ablated material. Naturally this scattering is also dependent on the mass of the background gas and can influence the stoichiometry of the deposited film.
The most important consequence of increasing the background pressure is the slowing down of the high energetic species in the expanding plasma plume. It has been shown that particles with kinetic energies around 50 eV can resputter the film already deposited on the substrate. This results in a lower deposition rate and can furthermore result in a change in the stoichiometry of the film.

===Deposition of the ablation material on the substrate===

The third stage is important to determine the quality of the deposited films. The high energetic species ablated from the target are bombarding the substrate surface and may cause damage to the surface by sputtering off atoms from the surface but also by causing defect formation in the deposited film. The sputtered species from the substrate and the particles emitted from the target form a collision region, which serves as a source for condensation of particles. When the condensation rate is high enough, a thermal equilibrium can be reached and the film grows on the substrate surface at the expense of the direct flow of ablation particles and the thermal equilibrium obtained.

===Nucleation and growth of the film on the substrate surface===

The nucleation process and growth kinetics of the film depend on several growth parameters including:

*&quot;Laser parameters&quot; – several factors such as the laser fluence [Joule/cm2], laser energy, and ionization degree of the ablated material will affect the film quality, the stoichiometry, and the deposition flux. Generally, the nucleation density increases when the deposition flux is increased.
*&quot;Surface temperature&quot; – The surface temperature has a large effect on the nucleation density. Generally, the nucleation density decreases as the temperature is increased. Heating of the surface can involve a heating plate or the use of a CO2 laser.
*&quot;Substrate surface&quot; – The nucleation and growth can be affected by the surface preparation (such as chemical etching), the miscut of the substrate, as well as the roughness of the substrate.
*&quot;Background pressure&quot; – Common in oxide deposition, an oxygen background is needed to ensure stoichiometric transfer from the target to the film. If, for example, the oxygen background is too low, the film will grow off stoichiometry which will affect the nucleation density and film quality.

In PLD, a large supersaturation occurs on the substrate during the pulse duration. The pulse lasts around 10–40 microseconds depending on the laser parameters. This high supersaturation causes a very large nucleation density on the surface as compared to molecular beam epitaxy or sputtering deposition. This nucleation density increases the smoothness of the deposited film.

In PLD, [depending on the deposition parameters above] three growth modes are possible:

*&quot;Step-flow growth&quot; – All substrates have a miscut associated with the crystal. These miscuts give rise to atomic steps on the surface. In step-flow growth, atoms land on the surface and diffuse to a step edge before they have a chance to nucleated a surface island. The growing surface is viewed as steps traveling across the surface. This growth mode is obtained by deposition on a high miscut substrate, or depositing at elevated temperatures
*&quot;Layer-by-layer growth&quot; – In this growth mode, islands nucleate on the surface until a critical island density is reached. As more material is added, the islands continue to grow until the islands begin to run into each other. This is known as coalescence. Once coalescence is reached, the surface has a large density of pits. When additional material is added to the surface the atoms diffuse into these pits to complete the layer. This process is repeated for each subsequent layer.
*&quot;3D growth&quot; – This mode is similar to the layer-by-layer growth, except that once an island is formed an additional island will nucleate on top of the 1st island. Therefore, the growth does not persist in a layer by layer fashion, and the surface roughens each time material is added.

==History==

Pulsed laser deposition is only one of many thin film deposition techniques. Other methods include molecular beam epitaxy (MBE), chemical vapor deposition (CVD), sputter deposition (RF, magnetron, and ion beam). The history of laser-assisted film growth started soon after the technical realization of the first laser in 1960 by Maiman. Smith and Turner utilized a ruby laser to deposit the first thin films in 1965, three years after Breech and Cross studied the laser-vaporization and excitation of atoms from solid surfaces. However, the deposited films were still inferior to those obtained by other techniques such as chemical vapor deposition and molecular beam epitaxy. In the early 1980s, a few research groups (mainly in the former USSR) achieved remarkable results on manufacturing of thin film structures utilizing laser technology. The breakthrough came in 1987 when D. Dijkkamp, Xindi Wu and T. Venkatesan were able to laser deposit a thin film of YBa2Cu3O7, a high temperature superconductive material, which was of superior quality to that of films deposited with alternative techniques. Since then, the technique of pulsed laser deposition has been utilized to fabricate high quality crystalline films, such as doped garnet thin films for use as planar waveguide lasers. The deposition of ceramic oxides, nitride films, ferromagnetic films, metallic multilayers and various superlattices has been demonstrated. In the 1990s the development of new laser technology, such as lasers with high repetition rate and short pulse durations, made PLD a very competitive tool for the growth of thin, well defined films with complex stoichiometry.

==Technical aspects==

There are many different arrangements to build a deposition chamber for PLD. The target material which is evaporated by the laser is normally found as a rotating disc attached to a support. However, it can also be sintered into a cylindrical rod with rotational motion and a translational up and down movement along its axis. This special configuration allows not only the utilization of a synchronized reactive gas pulse but also of a multicomponent target rod with which films of different multilayers can be created.

Some factors that influence the deposition rate:
*Target material
*Pulse energy of laser
*Repetition rate of the laser
*Temperature of the substrate
*Distance from target to substrate
*Type of gas and pressure in chamber (oxygen, argon, etc.)

<doc id="710050" wikidata="Q368125" url="?curid=710050" title="Anglo-Indian people">
<text>Anglo-Indian people are a distinct minority community of mixed-race British and Indian ancestry. During the colonial period, their ancestry was defined as British paternal and Indian maternal heritage; post-independence, &quot;Anglo-Indian&quot; has also encompassed other European and Indian ancestries. Anglo-Indians&#x27; first language is usually English. Prior to 1911, various designations like &quot;Eurasian&quot; or &quot;Indo-Briton&quot; were used to describe this community.

The All India Anglo-Indian Association, founded in 1926, has long represented the interests of this ethnic group; it holds that Anglo-Indians are unique in that they are Christians, speak English as their mother tongue, and have a historical link to both England and the Indian sub-continent. 

During the period of British rule in India, children born to unions between British fathers and Indian mothers from the 17th century onwards formed the basis of the Anglo-Indian community. This new ethnic group formed a small yet significant portion of the population and became well represented in certain administrative roles. As Anglo-Indians were mostly isolated from both British and Indian society, their documented numbers dwindled from roughly 300,000 at the time of independence in 1947 to about 125,000–150,000 in modern day India. During much of the time that Britain ruled India (the Raj), British-Indian relationships faced stigma, which meant that the ethnicity of some Anglo-Indians was undocumented or identified incorrectly. As such, many have adapted to local communities in India or emigrated to the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, the United States, South Africa and New Zealand.

Similar communities can also be seen in other parts of the world, although in smaller numbers, such as Anglo-Burmese in Myanmar and Burghers in Sri Lanka.

==Demographics==

==History==
The first use of &quot;Anglo-Indian&quot; was to describe all England people who lived in India. People of mixed British and Indian descent were referred to as &quot;Eurasians&quot;. Terminology has changed and the latter group are now called &quot;Anglo-Indians&quot;. The community originated soon after 1639 when the British East India Company established a settlement in Madras. The community identified itself with and was accepted by the British until 1791, when Anglo-Indians were excluded from positions of authority in the civil, military and marine services in the East India Company. During the Indian rebellion of 1857, Anglo-Indians sided with the British and consequently received favoured treatment from the British government in preference to other Indians, serving in large numbers in the strategic services of the railways, the postal and telegraph services, and customs. In 1919, the Anglo-Indian community was given one reserved seat in the Central Legislative Assembly in Delhi. The English-speaking Anglo-Indians identified themselves with the British against the nationalist Congress Party.

===Creation===
During the East India Company&#x27;s rule in India in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, it was common for British officers and soldiers to take local wives and start families, owing to an initial lack of British women in India. Looking at the records of wills from the early 1780s, a third of all British men in India named their Indian wives and children as their inheritors. By the mid-19th century, there were around 40,000 British soldiers, but fewer than 2,000 British officials present in India but by then the Suez Canal was opened and many British women came to India in quick transit.

Before the British Raj, the Company, with some reluctance, endorsed a policy of local marriage for its soldiers. The board of directors wrote in 1688 to its Council at Fort St. George: &quot;Induce by all meanes you can invent our Souldiers (sic) to marry with the Native women, because it will be impossible to get ordinary young women, as we have before directed, to pay their own passages, although Gentlewomen sufficient do offer themselves.&quot; Until 1741, a special payment was made to each soldier who had his child baptised as a Protestant. The concern in London was that if the soldiers at Fort St. George lived with or married the many Portuguese women there the children would be brought up as Roman Catholics rather than Protestants. The Company&#x27;s officials on the ground were less worried about the religious issue, but more concerned that soldiers should be married &quot;to prevent wickedness&quot;. Married soldiers with family ties were thought more likely to be better behaved than bachelors.

The British military population in India grew rapidly from a few hundred soldiers in the mid-18th century to 18,000 in the Royal and Company armies of 1790. During this time the records of cohabitation and last testaments show that at least a third of all British men in India married an Indian woman or left their inheritance to their Anglo-Indian children. There were also many second generation British officers who were born and raised in India, such as Lieutenant-Colonel James Kirkpatrick who was born in Madras in 1764, wore Mughal style clothing, and spoke Tamil as a first language. Left with a strong affinity for the cultural practices of their childhood homeland, many although nominally Christian would adopt local Hindu and Muslim customs such as shunning pork, beef, and even becoming vegetarians. Kirkpatrick would even go on to converting to Islam in order to marry a Sayyida noblewoman named Khair-un-Nissa in 1800, having two children together, and assimilating into the Hyderabadi elite. Other officials such as William Fraser would similarly assimilate themselves into local Indian culture, even patronizing artists and poets such as Ghalib, and going on to have dozens of children with many women, both Hindu and Muslim. Notable children of these unions such as James Skinner, also named Sikandar Sahib, the son of a England Company officer and an Indian noblewoman of the Bhojpur region, would go on to serve prominent roles in the Maratha Army and later Bengal Army where he raised his own regiment called Skinner&#x27;s Horse.

Many children were born to unofficial partnerships: 54% of the children baptised at St. John&#x27;s, Calcutta between 1767 and 1782 were Anglo-Indian and illegitimate. British women of good social standing were scarce; in 1785 surgeon John Stewart wrote to his brother from Cawnpore: &quot;Many of the women here are mere adventuresses from Milliners shops on Ludgate Hill and some even from Covent Garden and Old Drury [well known areas of prostitution in late 18th century London]. They possess neither sentiment nor education, and are so intoxicated by their sudden elevation, that a sensible man can only regard them with indignation and outrage.&quot;

The reforming zeal of Governor-General Lord Cornwallis had ensured that by the 1780s, the opportunities for Company servants to make a fortune through trade had gone forever. Most had to live on their Company salaries and few could afford to support a wife. Company officers were paid less than their counterparts in the British Army and promotion might take twice as long, perhaps 25 years to reach the rank of Major in the Company compared to between 12 and 17 years in the Royal Army; and in the Bengal Army in 1784, there were only four Colonels amongst 931 officers. Few young officers in either army managed to avoid debt. It might have cost approximately £50 a year (Rs 24 to Rs 40 a month) to provide for the wants of an Indian companion and her attendants, compared with £600 to support a British wife with any degree of public style. 83 of 217 wills in Bengal between 1780 and 1785 contained bequests either to Indian companions or their natural children, who were the offspring of high and low in British society, and gentlemen of wealth often left substantial bequests and annuities to their Indian partners and children. When Major Thomas Naylor in 1782 bequeathed to his companion Muckmul Patna Rs 4000, a bungalow and a garden at Berhampore, a hackery, bullocks, her jewels, clothes, and all their male and female slaves, he treated her as he might a wife. Where they could, gentlemen sent their Anglo-Indian daughters to the ladies&#x27; seminaries in Presidency towns and to England to be &#x27;finished&#x27;; and when they returned, they were married off to fellow officers. Some daughters of senior officers became substantial heiresses whose wealth was a marked marital attraction, but many more daughters of impoverished officers, raised in military orphanages after the deaths of their fathers, hoped only to find a suitable husband at the monthly public dances. Save in very few cases, when British men returned home, the Indian companion and any children stayed in India: British soldiers were not permitted to bring them, and many officers and civil servants feared the social and cultural consequences.

===Neglect===
Originally, under Regulation VIII of 1813, Anglo-Indians were excluded from the British legal system and in Bengal became subject to the rule of Islamic law outside Calcutta, and yet found themselves without any caste or status amongst those who were to judge them. This coincided with the Company officially allowing Christian missionaries into India; and evangelical organisations and popular writers of the time like Mary Sherwood routinely blamed the alleged moral shortcomings or personality defects of the growing Anglo-Indian population upon the Indian mother rather than the European father. There was growing disapproval of marriages amongst the Company elite and Anglo-Indian women. The public dances for the female wards of the Upper Military Academy, Calcutta, which had been attended so eagerly fifty years earlier had been discontinued by the 1830s. Public argument against marriages to Indian and Anglo-Indian women skirted the question of race and focused on their social consequences: they did not mix well in British society, lacked education, were reluctant to leave India when their men retired, and - probably most important of all - would handicap the career of an ambitious husband. By 1830, the proportion of illegitimate births registered in the Bengal Presidency had fallen to 10%, and British wills in Bengal in 1830-2 record less than one in four bequests to Indian women and their children compared with almost two in five fifty years earlier. For all the social disapproval, however, officers and Company servants continued to marry Anglo-Indian girls, and it was thought that in Calcutta alone there were more than 500 marriageable Anglo-Indian girls in the 1820s, compared to 250 Englishwomen in the whole of Bengal.

In 1821, a pamphlet entitled &quot;Thoughts on how to better the condition of Indo-Britons&quot; by a &quot;Practical Reformer&quot;, was written to promote the removal of prejudices existing in the minds of young Eurasians against engaging in trades. This was followed up by another pamphlet, entitled &quot;An Appeal on behalf of Indo-Britons&quot;. Prominent Eurasians in Calcutta formed the &quot;East Indian Committee&quot; with a view to send a petition to the British parliament for the redress of their grievances. John William Ricketts, a pioneer in the Eurasian cause, volunteered to proceed to England. His mission was successful, and on his return to India, by way of Madras, he received a standing ovation from his countrymen in that presidency; and was afterwards warmly welcomed in Calcutta, where a report of his mission was read at a public meeting held in the Calcutta Town Hall. In April 1834, in obedience to an Act of Parliament passed in August 1833, the Indian government was forced to grant government jobs to Anglo-Indians.

As British women began arriving in India in large numbers around the early to mid-19th century, mostly as family members of officers and soldiers, British men became less likely to marry Indian women. Intermarriage declined after the events of the Rebellion of 1857, after which several anti-miscegenation laws were implemented. As a result, Eurasians were neglected by both the British and Indian populations in India.

===Consolidation===
Over generations, Anglo-Indians intermarried with other Anglo-Indians to form a community that developed a culture of its own. Their cuisine, dress, speech (use of English as their mother tongue), and religion (Christianity) all served to further separate them from the native population. A number of factors fostered a strong sense of community among Anglo-Indians. Their English language school system, their strongly Anglo-influenced culture, and their Christian beliefs in particular helped bind them together.

They formed social clubs and associations to run functions, including regular dances on occasions such as Christmas and Easter. Indeed, their Christmas balls, held in most major cities, still form a distinctive part of Indian Christian culture.

Over time Anglo-Indians were specifically recruited into the Customs and Excise, Post and Telegraphs, Forestry Department, the railways and teaching professions – but they were employed in many other fields as well.

The Anglo-Indian community also had a role as go-betweens in the introduction of Western musical styles, harmonies and instruments in post-Independence India. During the colonial era, genres including ragtime and jazz were played by bands for the social elites, and these bands often contained Anglo-Indian members.

===Independence and choices===

Around the time of the Indian independence movement, the All-India Anglo-Indian Association was opposed to the partition of India; its then president Frank Anthony criticized the colonial authorities for &quot;racial discrimination in matters of pay and allowances, and for failing to acknowledge the sterling military and civil contributions made by Anglo-Indians to the Raj&quot;.

Their position at the time of independence of India was difficult. Given their English ancestry, many felt a loyalty to a British &quot;home&quot; that most had never seen and where they would gain little social acceptance. &quot;Bhowani Junction&quot; touches on the identity crisis faced by the Anglo-Indian community during the independence movement of the 20th century. They felt insecure in an India that put a premium on participation in the independence movement as a prerequisite for important government positions.

Many Anglo-Indians left the country in 1947, hoping to make a new life in the United Kingdom or elsewhere in the British Commonwealth, such as Australia or Canada. The exodus continued through the 1950s and 1960s and by the late 1990s most had left with many of the remaining Anglo-Indians still aspiring to leave.

Like the Parsi community, the Anglo-Indians were essentially urban dwellers. Unlike the Parsis, the mass migrations saw more of the better educated and financially secure Anglo-Indians depart for other Commonwealth nations.

===21st century cultural resurgence===

There has been a resurgence in celebrating Anglo-Indian culture in the twenty-first century, in the form of International Anglo-Indian Reunions and in publishing books. There have been nine reunions, with the latest being held in 2015 in Kolkata.

Several narratives and novels have been published recently. &quot;The Leopard&#x27;s Call: An Anglo-Indian Love Story&quot; (2005) by Reginald Shires, tells of the life of two teachers at the small Bengali town of Falakata, down from Bhutan; &quot;At the Age for Love: A Novel of Bangalore during World War II&quot; (2006) is by the same author. &quot;In the Shadow of Crows&quot; (2009) by David Charles Manners, is the critically acclaimed true account of a young Englishman&#x27;s unexpected discovery of his Anglo-Indian relations in the Darjeeling district. &quot;The Hammarskjold Killing&quot; (2007) by William Higham, is a novel in which a London-born Anglo-Indian heroine is caught up in a terrorist crisis in Sri Lanka. Keith St Clair Butler wrote &#x27;The Secret Vindaloo&#x27; (2014, reprint 2016) which used the signature dish of Vindaloo as a deep metaphor for the explorations of his family and community. The book received critical acclaim The narrative received grants from The Literature Board of Australia and The Victorian Premier&#x27;s Department of the Arts.

==Christian religious practice==
Anglo-Indians are adherents of Christianity. Along with their British heritage and English language, the Christian religious faith of Anglo-Indians is one of the things that distinguishes them from other ethnic groups. As such, Anglo-Indians have &quot;been well-represented in all tiers of the churches, from cardinals, archbishops, bishops, priests and ministers, and fill a number of educational roles.&quot;

==Present communities==
India constitutionally guarantees of the rights of communities and religious and linguistic minorities, and thus permits Anglo-Indians to maintain their own schools and to use English as the medium of instruction. In order to encourage the integration of the community into the larger society, the government stipulates that a certain percentage of the student body come from other Indian communities. 

In a 2013 BBC News feature on Anglo-Indians, journalist Kris Griffiths wrote: &quot;It has been noted in recent years that the number of Anglo-Indians who have succeeded in certain fields is remarkably disproportionate to the community&#x27;s size. For example, in the music industry there are Engelbert Humperdinck (born Madras), Peter Sarstedt (Delhi) and Cliff Richard (Lucknow). The looser definition of Anglo-Indian (any mixed British-Indian parentage) encompasses the likes of cricketer Nasser Hussain, footballer Michael Chopra and actor Ben Kingsley.&quot;

Air Vice-Marshal Maurice Barker was India&#x27;s first Anglo-Indian Air Marshal. At least seven other Anglo-Indians subsequently reached that post, a notable achievement for a small community. A number of others have been decorated for military achievements. Air Marshal Malcolm Wollen is often considered the man who won India&#x27;s 1971 war fighting alongside Bangladesh. Anglo-Indians made similarly significant contributions to the Indian Navy and Army.

One of the most respected matriculation qualifications in India, the Indian Certificate of Secondary Education, was started and built by some of the community&#x27;s best known educationalists, including Frank Anthony, who served as its president, and A.E.T. Barrow, its secretary for the better part of half a century. Most Anglo-Indians, even those without much formal education, find that gaining employment in schools is fairly easy because of their fluency in English.

Norman Pritchard became India&#x27;s first ever Olympic medallist, winning two silver medals at the 1900 Olympic Games in Paris, France. In cricket Roger Binny was the leading wicket-taker during the Indian cricket team&#x27;s 1983 World Cup triumph. Wilson Jones was India&#x27;s first ever World Professional Billiards Champion.

Today, there are estimated to be 350,000-400,000 Anglo-Indians living in India, most of whom are based in the cities of Kolkata, Chennai, Bangalore, Mumbai, Delhi, Hyderabad, Ratlam, Kochi, Pune, Kollam, Secunderabad, Mysuru, Mangaluru, Kolar Gold Fields, Kanpur, Lucknow, Agra, Varanasi, Madurai, Coimbatore, Pothanur, Tiruchirapalli, The Nilgiris, and a few in Hospet and Hatti Gold Mines. Anglo-Indians also live in the towns of Alappuzha, Kozhikode, Cannanore (Kannur) in the South Indian state of Kerala also at Goa and Pondicherry and in some towns of Bihar such as Jamalpur, McCluskieganj and in Uttarakhand such as Dehradun, Jharkhand such as Ranchi, Dhanbad and West Bengal such as Asansol, Kharagpur, Kalimpong. A significant number of this population resides in Odisha&#x27;s Khurda and some in Cuttack. However, the Anglo-Indian population has dwindled over the years with most people migrating abroad or to other parts of the country. Tangasseri in Kollam city is the only place in Kerala State where Anglo-Indian tradition is maintained. However, almost all the colonial structures there have disappeared, except the Tangasseri Lighthouse built by the British in 1902.

Most of the Anglo-Indians overseas are concentrated in Britain, Australia, Canada, United States, and New Zealand, while some have settled in European countries like Switzerland, Germany, and France. According to the Anglo-Indians who have settled in Australia, integration for the most part has not been difficult. The community in Burma frequently intermarried with the local Anglo-Burmese community but both communities suffered from adverse discrimination since Burma&#x27;s military took over the government in 1962, with most having now left the country to settle overseas.

==Political status==
Article 366(2) of the Indian Constitution defines Anglo-Indian as:

(2) an Anglo Indian means a person whose father or any of whose other male progenitors in the male line is or was of European descent but who is domiciled within the territory of India and is or was born within such territory of parents habitually resident therein and not established there for temporary purposes only;

Between 1952 and 2020, the Anglo-Indian community was the only community in India that had its own representatives nominated to the Lok Sabha (lower house) in Parliament of India. These two members were nominated by the President of India on the advice of the Government of India. This right was secured from Jawaharlal Nehru by Frank Anthony, the first and longtime president of the All India Anglo-Indian Association. The community was represented by two members. This was done because the community had no native state of its own.

Fourteen states out of twenty-eight states in India; Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Gujarat, Jharkhand, Karnataka, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Telangana, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand and West Bengal also had a nominated Anglo-Indian member each in their respective State Legislative Assemblies.

In January 2020, the Anglo-Indian reserved seats in the Parliament and State Legislatures of India were basically abolished by the 104th Constitutional Amendment Act, 2019, but this provision was extended to 2030.

==Other populations==
Anglo-Indian often only represents Indians mixed with British ancestry during the British Raj. There are many mixed Indians from other European countries during the colonial era. For example, the definition rarely embraces the descendants of the Indians from the old Portuguese colonies of both the Coromandel and Malabar Coasts, who joined the East India Company as mercenaries and brought their families with them. The definition has many extensions, for example, Luso-Indian (mixed Portuguese and Indian) of Goa and Kochi, people of Indo-French descent, and Indo-Dutch descent.

Indians have encountered Europeans since their earliest civilization. They have been a continuous element in the sub-continent. Their presence is not to be considered Anglo-Indian. Similarly, Indians who mixed with Europeans after the British Raj are also not to be considered Anglo-Indian.

===Britons in the British East Indies and British India===
Historically, the term &quot;Anglo-Indian&quot; was also used in common parlance in the British Government and England during the colonial era to refer to those people (such as Rudyard Kipling, or the hunter-naturalist Jim Corbett), who were of British descent but were born and raised in India, usually because their parents were serving in armed forces or one of the British-run administrations, such as its main government; &quot;Anglo-Indian&quot;, in this sense, was a geographically-specific subset of overseas or non-domiciled British.

==Population in other countries==
===Bangladesh===
There is a significant population of Anglo-Indians in Bangladesh. Anglo-Indians have been present in Bangladesh since the colonial period. Their population decreased to 4,000 in 1947 during the Partition of India. Most of them migrated to the United Kingdom, United States, Australia, New Zealand and Canada. In 1970, however, almost 9,000 Anglo-Indians had come from India. During the 1971 Bangladesh Liberation War, almost 1,500 Anglo-Indians died. After the independence of Bangladesh, during 1974–1976 almost 2,800 Anglo-Indians arrived in Bangladesh from India. In 1980, there were 3,750 reported births of Anglo-Indian children in Bangladesh. By 1993, there were 10,371 Anglo-Indians living in Bangladesh. The Anglo-Indian population in the country reached 20,000 in 2016.

<text>The Long Tom River is a tributary of the Willamette River in western Oregon in the United States. It drains an area at the south end of the Willamette Valley between Eugene and Corvallis.

It rises in the Central Oregon Coast Range in western Lane County, approximately 10 mi (16 km) west of Veneta. It flows east through the mountains to Veneta, through the Fern Ridge Reservoir, and then north into the Willamette Valley, roughly parallel to and west of the Willamette River. It joins the Willamette from the southwest approximately 4 mi (6.5 km) west of Halsey. The Fern Ridge Reservoir was created in 1942 when the United States Army Corps of Engineers dammed the river to control flooding.

The watershed includes approximately of land (262,000 acres, 1060 km2) zoned as 45 percent forest, 30 percent agricultural, 8 public, and 17 percent urban or rural residential. The Long Tom waters support more than 140,000 people in the area, including residents in the city of Veneta and the rural farming communities of Alvadore, Cheshire, Crow, Franklin, and Noti, as well as industrial and commercial land on the western edge of Eugene. These lands were inhabited by the Chelamela group of the Kalapuya Indians prior to European settlement.

The Oregon Country Fair is one of many groups and agencies that work with the Long Tom Watershed Council to protect and restore the river.

==Name==
The river&#x27;s name, Long Tom, developed gradually during the 19th century in imitation of a native tribal group called &quot;Lung-tum-ler&quot;. The Native American name of this Kalapuyan group is &quot;[lámpʰtumpif]&quot;, literally meaning &quot;spank-his-ass&quot;.

==Tributaries==
Named tributaries from source to mouth are Micheals, Jones, Swamp, Dusky, Hayes, Sweet, Green, and Gold creeks. Then come Noti, Wilson, Indian creeks before the river enters Fern Ridge Reservoir. Hannavan and Inman creeks enter the reservoir as does Coyote Creek. (The topographic map also shows a separate Coyote Creek that leaves the reservoir south of the main Long Tom channel and rejoins it further downstream.) Below the reservoir come Squaw, the second confluence with Coyote Creek, then Lingo Slough, Bear, Amazon, Ferguson, Shafer, and Miller creeks.

<doc id="710061" wikidata="Q3695748" url="?curid=710061" title="Lahore Junction railway station">
<text>Lahore Junction Railway Station (Urdu, ), is the main railway station in Lahore, Pakistan. It is among the oldest railway stations of the Indian subcontinent. Construction commenced shortly after the 1857 War of Independence. It was built in the style of a medieval fort with thick walls, turrets, and holes to direct gun and cannon fire for the defence of the structure.

It is located at the junction between Circular Road and Allama Iqbal Road and bounded on the north side by the old Grand Trunk Road. The station is now owned by Pakistan Railways, and also serves as its headquarters.

==History==
The station was built during the colonial era, and was built just outside the Walled City at the intersection of Empress Road, Allama Iqbal Road and Circular Road. Lahore Junction station was constructed by Mian Mohammad Sultan Chughtai, a former official of the Mughal Empire, between 1859 and 1860.

The station was also a witness to a brutal lathi charge in British era that took place on 30 October 1928 near the premises of the junction when Indian leader Lala Lajpat Rai had led a protest march against the Simon Commission that had come to Lahore to discuss political reforms in the town. Rai was beaten by a wooden baton by the then Police Superintendent of Lahore and was badly wounded. Rai later died of his injuries on 17 November.

The station served as the headquarters for the Punjab Railway and later would serve as the northern terminus of the Scinde, Punjab &amp; Delhi Railway, which connected the port city of Karachi to Lahore. The nearby Dai Anga Mosque was also converted into offices for the railways at this time. The station was built in the style of a medieval castle to ward off any potential future uprisings, as seen in the Sepoy Mutiny of 1857, with thick walls, turrets, and holes to direct gun and cannon fire for the defence of the structure.

The station is a legacy of the extensive railway network established during the British Raj, and reflects the British contribution to the region&#x27;s infrastructure. The station was severely affected during the riots which followed the Partition of the British Indian Empire and the independence of Pakistan in 1947. Similar to the contemporaneous situation of Muslims fleeing Delhi and Amritsar, Lahore&#x27;s Hindus and Sikhs were sometimes attacked at Lahore&#x27;s train station.

==Facilities==
Lahore Junction Station is equipped with all basic facilities such as ticketing services, washrooms and waiting areas. The station has current and advance reservation offices for Pakistan Railways, as well as freight and parcel facilities. Retail shops are found mainly on platforms 2 , 4 and 5.

==Overview==
The Lahore railway station is located at an elevation of 213 metres (764 ft) and was assigned the code &quot;LHR&quot;. With this, it has become the busiest railway station of Pakistan in terms of passenger movement and train traffic. Lahore railway station has free WiFi and CCTV cameras.

==Services==

<text>Cape Chelyuskin (, &quot;Mys Chelyuskina&quot;) is the northernmost point of the Eurasian continent (and indeed of any continental mainland), and the northernmost point of mainland Russia. It is situated at the tip of the Taymyr Peninsula, south of Severnaya Zemlya archipelago, in Krasnoyarsk Krai, Russia. The headland has a light on a framework tower.

Cape Chelyuskin is from the North Pole. Cape Vega is a headland located a little to the west of Cape Chelyuskin. Oscar Bay lies between both capes.

==History==
The cape was first reached in May 1742 by an expedition on land party led by Semion Chelyuskin, and was initially called Cape East-Northern. It was renamed in honour of Chelyuskin by the Russian Geographical Society in 1842, on the 100th anniversary of the discovery.

It was passed on 18 August 1878 by Adolf Erik Nordenskiöld during the first sea voyage through the North-East Passage.

In 1919 Norwegian explorer Roald Amundsen&#x27;s ship &quot;Maud&quot; left behind two men, Peter Tessem and Paul Knutsen, at Cape Chelyuskin after having made winter quarters there. The &quot;Maud&quot; continued eastwards into the Laptev Sea and the men were instructed to wait for the freeze-up of the Kara Sea and then sledge southwestwards towards Dikson carrying Amundsen&#x27;s mail. However, these two men disappeared mysteriously. In 1922 Nikifor Begichev led a Soviet expedition in search for Peter Tessem and Paul Knutsen on request of the government of Norway, but Begichev was not successful. Clues to their fate were not found until 1922.

A weather and a hydrology research base named &quot;Polar Station Cape Chelyuskin&quot; was constructed in 1932, and headed by Ivan Papanin. It was renamed the &quot;E. K. Fyodorov Hydrometeorological Observatory&quot; in 1983. The station has a magnetic observatory and stands on the eastern side of the point.

Systematic geological survey for uranium began here in 1946–47 with industrial extraction between 1950 and 1952 in a mountain 150 km south of the cape proper.

The cape hosts the northernmost airfield in Afro-Eurasia, in operation at various locations since 1950.

==Climate==

Cape Chelyuskin has a tundra climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;ET&quot;), with no month having a low above freezing. Winters last year round, but may be broken up during the meteorological summer months by short spells of above average temperatures. Snowfall is usual year round, with every year experiencing snow during every month including summer. Sunshine hours peak during April, and begin to sharply drop off during the end of July or early August.

<text>St. Mary&#x27;s High School is a Catholic secondary school in Kitchener, Ontario, Canada. It serves most of Kitchener&#x27;s Catholic students, with others attending Resurrection Catholic Secondary School. Members of its sports teams are known as the &quot;Eagles&quot;.

==History==

The school was originally located in downtown Kitchener, where it was founded as the Girls&#x27; School to complement the adjacent boys-only St. Jerome&#x27;s High School. As the latter school had older infrastructure, it was closed and St. Mary&#x27;s was made co-ed in 1990. In 2002, the school moved from the downtown to the southern suburbs, where there would be far less commuting time for most students.

The former school buildings have been given differing fates: one auxiliary building (fka &quot;West Wing&quot; aka &quot;Blue Wing&quot;) was demolished along with the gymnasium annex of the &quot;West Campus&quot; building; the main St. Jerome&#x27;s facility has been renovated to house Wilfrid Laurier University&#x27;s Faculty of Social Work, and the main St. Mary&#x27;s building (&quot;Green&quot;, &quot;Yellow&quot;, and &quot;Silver&quot; wings) now houses both the Catholic School Board offices and the Kitchener Downtown Community Centre.

In the autumn of 2004, a new branch of the Kitchener Public Library opened within the new school building.

The school&#x27;s fall 2005 enrollment was 2,200 students. This population was still far higher than the anticipated capacity; 25 portable classrooms are currently installed on the grounds, and no student parking is available due to the need for faculty parking, however, the newly constructed arena, the Activa Center, allows students use of its parking lot during school hours.

As of October 2008, the school&#x27;s population was 2,123, making it one of the largest in Ontario.

The new school building features a Triple Gym, an auditorium/theatre known as Alumni Hall, as well as a large cafeteria. The school also houses tennis courts and 2 soccer/football fields.

In 2019, the school applied for an Aviva Community Fund that would allow for a facelift for their tennis courts and transform these courts into multi-purpose courts.

The school was granted $345,000 for facility improvements funded primarily by the Hallman Foundation which included developing their multi-purpose court, green gym, and park benches thanks to the work of The Legacy Committee.

Several notable events have occurred at the new school since its opening in 2002. These events include: a bomb scare in 2004, again in September 2010 and again in April 2016, a fire in the central stairwell in 2005, and a chemical scare in 2006. Also, in 2008, an E. coli scare emerged in the school&#x27;s cafetorium, affecting several students. An anonymous caller made threats to students and staff resulting in a two-day closure on May 29 and 30, 2024.

In June 2011, the school received its first silver Certification in the WCDSB from Ontario Eco-School. with addition in June 2013 they arrive another silver Certification with Eco-School.

The school&#x27;s motto Virtus et Scientia, meaning Virtue and Knowledge, has continued to be written in the lives of their graduates. As an extension to the school&#x27;s classic motto, Virtus et Scientia, they have implemented their mission statement &quot;Where Kindness Matters, Community Grows!&quot;.

The school promotes this motto at the end of all of its announcements and makes sure to spread positivity around their school community. As a celebration of kindness, each year the school holds an annual Kindness Matters barbecue to sum up a fantastic year. This allows for all students to share a common lunch and join in participating in different games and activities while enjoying a free barbecue lunch and other great snacks.

In 2019, the Ion light rail system (LRT) brought passenger rail service to its newly constructed Block Line station, located one block from SMHS. This has allowed for easier and more convenient transportation for students.

==Athletics==

In late spring 2007, the girl&#x27;s slo-pitch team became WCSSA champions. They ended their season with 22 wins and 0 losses – a perfect season. They also competed in two tournaments in addition to the regular season, one in Toronto hosted by Bishop Allen and one in Kitchener at the Peter Hallman ballpark. They won both tournaments. Since then, they have gone 81-1-0 as of 2010.

In 2008/2009, the Activa Arena Complex, built by the city of Kitchener, was constructed beside the campus. The arena is now home to St. Mary&#x27;s hockey teams, and it also houses the Lennox Lewis Boxing School.

In the spring of 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in the closure of schools, leading to the cancellation of all athletics in the District 8 Athletic Association. In the subsequent 2021-2022 school year athletics resumed.

==Performance arts==
The campus&#x27; theatre, Alumni Hall, has been host to several theatrical productions. It is one of the only high schools in the Waterloo Region that produces two productions every year - one in the fall and one in the spring.

==Clubs==

There are many non-athletic opportunities for students to get involved in the school community. They include: Art Club, Bible Study Group, Board Games Club, Concert Band, Dance Team, DECA, Eagle Buddies, Environmental Club, Hypercussion, Investment Club, Key Club (Local Area), Link Crew, March For Life (Trip to Ottawa, ON), Mission Collection, Newspaper, Nutrition for Learning, Outdoor Adventure Club, Relay For Life, Science Olympics, Skills Canada, Social Action Team, Tech Crew, The Nest and Yearbook (Separate with non-club), as well as many others.

A relatively new club that presents support and encouragement for diversity amongst the students and staff is St. Mary&#x27;s PRISM club (Pride and Respect for Individuals of a Sexual Minority). This club is a supportive group of individuals who build a safe space and stand in solidarity to combat hate and harassment directed towards those who identify as a sexual minority.

Students at SMHS collectively started a Black Lives Matter club where they continue to bring awareness to the situation and support to those discriminated against due to race, ethnicity, or colour. St. Mary&#x27;s holds a Black History Month of events to recognize and showcase the talents, achievements, and culture of St. Mary&#x27;s own students as they demonstrate pride in their own heritage and culture.

School activities and improvements are conceived and organized by the Student Activities Council, commonly known as SAC. SAC is typically headed by two co-presidents. The council consists of positions like the Arts Reps, Assembly Reps, Athletic Reps, Social Justice Reps, Special Events Reps, Spirit Reps, Healthy Schools Reps, Special Education Reps, Inclusivity Reps, Multicultural Reps, Tech Reps, Communications Reps, Grade Nine Reps and the Faith Rep. SAC keeps students informed with current events, fundraisers, and initiatives.

== Specialist High Skills Major ==
St. Mary&#x27;s High School participates and encourages their grade 11 and 12 students to join their Specialist High Skills Major program (SHSM). This program allows for students to partake in numerous workshops that will earn valuable industry certifications and encourages focus on a career path matching their skills and interests.

St. Mary&#x27;s specifically supports grade 11&#x27;s and 12&#x27;s who participate in this program by incorporating this into their co-operative education classes as a requirement and providing a Red Seal on their diploma if successfully completed.  Students participating in SHSM are required to take courses specifically related to their Major such as - Arts, Business, Health and Wellness, Justice, Community Safety &amp; Emergency Services, etc.

The school&#x27;s co-operative education (Co-op) classes allow students to gain experience in many different trades and fields of work. St. Mary&#x27;s Co-op class gives students the chance to see what it is like to work in a profession they are interested in and allows for students to develop helpful skills and earn hands-on experience.

<text>This is a list of presidents of the United States by other offices (either elected or appointed) held. Every president of the United States except Donald Trump has served as at least one of the following:
* a member of the Presidential Cabinet (either Vice President or Cabinet secretary)
* a member of Congress (either U.S. senator or representative)
* a governor of a state
* a general of the United States Army

==Federal government==
===Executive branch===
==== Vice presidents ====
Fifteen former vice presidents (R. Johnson, Breckinridge, Morton, Stevenson, Fairbanks, Garner, Wallace, Barkley, Nixon, Humphrey, Mondale, Quayle, Gore, Pence and Harris) all made failed runs for the presidency. Breckinridge was nominated by the Southern Democratic Party in 1860 but came in second in the Electoral College. Humphrey, Mondale, Gore, and Nixon received their party&#x27;s nominations. Nixon would later be elected in a second run for the presidency becoming the first former vice president to try and win the presidency post-vice presidency. In 1984, Mondale would be the second former vice president to try for the presidency. In 1988, Vice President George H. W. Bush would be elected president. In 2020, Biden was the third former vice president to try for the presidency, and the second to win the presidency post-vice presidency. Theodore Roosevelt, Coolidge, Truman and Lyndon B. Johnson would become president after a presidential death in office and go onto win their own subsequent elections.

====Cabinet secretaries====
Calvin Coolidge (as the vice president) and Herbert Hoover both served in the Cabinet of Warren G. Harding.

==== Ambassadors ====
====Other federal appointees====
===Judicial branch===
==== Chief Justice of the United States ====
==== Other federal judges ====
===Legislative branch===
==== Senators ====
A number of future presidents served together while in the Senate:
*Monroe served under Vice President Adams (1790–1794).
*Jackson served under Vice President Jefferson (1797–1798). Jackson later served with Van Buren (1823–1825). Van Buren also served with W.H. Harrison (1825–1828) and Tyler (1827–1828). Buchanan also served with Tyler (1834–1836) and later served with Pierce (1837–1842). Both Buchanan and Tyler served under Vice President Van Buren (1833–1837), while Buchanan and Pierce briefly served under Vice President Tyler (1841).
* B. Harrison briefly served under Vice President Arthur (1881).
* L. Johnson served with both Nixon (1950–1953) and Kennedy (1953–1960). L. Johnson and Kennedy both served under Vice President Nixon (1953–1961).
* Biden served under vice presidents Ford (1973–1974) and Bush (1981–1989) and later served with Obama (2005–2008).

James A. Garfield was elected senator for Ohio in 1880, but he did not take up the office due to being elected president later that year.

Seven former senators (Monroe, Adams, Jackson, W.H. Harrison, Pierce, Buchanan, and B. Harrison) were elected to the presidency without ever serving as the vice president between their departure from the Senate and the beginning of their presidencies.

==== Members of the House of Representatives ====
A number of future and former presidents served in the House together:
*Jackson served with Madison (1796–1797).
*W.H. Harrison served with Tyler (1816–1819).
*Buchanan served with Polk (1825–1831). Polk also served with J. Q. Adams (1831–1839). J. Q. Adams later served with Fillmore (1833–1835; 1837–1843), Pierce (1833–1837), A. Johnson (1843–1848), and Lincoln (1847–1848). A. Johnson and Lincoln would continue to serve alongside each other (1848–1849).
*Garfield served with both Hayes (1865–1867) and McKinley (1877–1880).
*Nixon served with L. Johnson (1947–1949), Kennedy (1947–1950), and Ford (1949–1950). Ford, who continued to serve alongside Kennedy (1950–1953), later served with G. H. W. Bush (1967–1971).
1835 was the year in which the most former and future presidents served together in Congress: six presidents (Representatives J.Q. Adams, Pierce, Fillmore, and Polk, and Senators Buchanan and Tyler), who all served under vice president (and future president) Martin Van Buren.

The time period between 1891 and 1915 (24 years) was the longest time period with no former or future presidents serving in Congress. In total, there were 65 years in which no former or future president was serving in Congress.

As of 2024, there were 10 presidents who served in both chambers of congress (J.Q. Adams, Jackson, Pierce, Buchanan, A. Johnson, Kennedy, L.B. Johnson, and Nixon), 2 presidents who served in both the Continental Congress and the Congress of the United States (Madison and Monroe), and 1 president who served in both the Congress of the United States and the Provisional Congress of the Confederate States (President John Tyler).

<text>Slip-cueing is a turntable-based DJ technique which consists of holding a record still while the platter rotates underneath the slipmat and releasing it at the right moment. In this way the record attains the right speed almost immediately, with no need to wait for the heavy platter to accelerate.

Slip-cueing was introduced to the disco scene by Francis Grasso, but the technique had been used for many years in the radio broadcast industry; it was often used by radio stations to match a following song to the preceding song, preserving the beat. Grasso used this method to great effect in order to create a continuous flow of music for a nightclub dance floor.

<text>The Royal Air Force Museum London (also commonly known as the RAF Museum) is located on the former Hendon Aerodrome, in North London&#x27;s Borough of Barnet. It includes five buildings and hangars showing the history of aviation and the Royal Air Force. It is part of the Royal Air Force Museum.

There is another site at Royal Air Force Museum Cosford at RAF Cosford in Shropshire.

==History==
The museum site at Colindale was once part of the RAF Hendon station and prior to that, one of the first civilian airfields, acquired by Claude Grahame-White in 1911.

In 1914, the aerodrome was requisitioned for Home Defence during the First World War. Hendon became a Royal Naval Air Station, training new pilots in the flying schools on site. Operations ceased after the end of the Great War.

From 1927 to 1939 Hendon housed No. 601 Squadron, nicknamed the &#x27;Millionaires&#x27; Squadron&#x27; due to the wealth and upper social class of its volunteers. In 1939, the outbreak of war saw Hendon once again become an operational RAF station, home to No. 24 Transport and Communications Squadron. RAF Hendon also served briefly as a fighter station during the Battle of Britain.

The last flight to Hendon by a fixed-wing aircraft took place on 19 June 1968, when the last operational Blackburn Beverley was delivered to the museum prior to its royal opening in 1972. Soon afterwards, the runways were removed to make way for the Grahame Park Housing Estate. The official closure of RAF Hendon took place on 1 April 1987.

The museum was officially opened at the Colindale (then part of Hendon) London site on 15 November 1972 by Queen Elizabeth II. The hangars housed 36 aircraft at opening. Over the years, the collection has increased in size substantially, and aircraft not on display at Hendon were stored or displayed at smaller local RAF station museums.

The first director of the museum was Dr John Tanner, who retired in 1987. In 1988, Dr Michael A. Fopp (who had previously directed the London Transport Museum) was appointed director general of all three sites (London, Cosford and Stafford) operated by the museum. Retired Air Vice-Marshal Peter Dye replaced Fopp as director general on 9 June 2010. In October 2014, it was announced that Maggie Appleton was to be appointed as CEO of the museum.

The Battle of Britain Museum (later Hall) was opened by Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother in November 1978. On 3 October 2016 the Battle of Britain Hall was permanently closed and refurbished.

The London site has been regularly expanded. For example, in recent years landscaping had taking place to illustrate what the former Hendon airfield was like, in what has become a heavily urbanised area.

As of 2012, it had over 100 aircraft, including the Avro Lancaster S-Sugar, which flew 137 night sorties. It also includes the only complete Hawker Typhoon. Added in 2018, as part of the RAF Centenary exhibitions, were a Westland Sea King helicopter (once flown by Prince William, Duke of Cambridge), a Gnat jet trainer of the Red Arrows, and a full-scale mock-up of the F-35 Lightning II stealth fighter.

==Description==

The Royal Air Force Museum is a National Museum, a Government non-departmental public body (NDPB) and also is a registered charity.

The Royal Air Force Museum London is displayed over six hangars.

===Hangar 1, RAF Stories and First to the Future===
Two exhibitions, RAF Stories and RAF First to the Future, opened in 2018 to commemorate the RAF centenary:

RAF Stories, The First 100 years 1918–2018 of the RAF. This exhibition observes the RAF&#x27;s first 100 years, from its creation in 1918 as the world&#x27;s first independent air force. It explores the different roles of the people of the RAF, alongside the changes in technology.

Hangar 1 forms the main point of entry to the museum.

===Hangar 2, the Grahame-White Factory===
Also known as the Grahame-White Factory shows the earliest days of flight on the site of The London Aerodrome, through to the formation of the independent Royal Air Force in 1918.

===Hangars 3 and 4, The Historic Hangars===

These hangars focus on the aircraft of the Second World War and the Cold War. It includes original Battle of Britain fighter aircraft: the Hawker Hurricane, Messerschmitt Bf 109 and Supermarine Spitfire; helicopters, and some Cold War jet aircraft. 

===Hangar 5, the Bomber Hall===

Battle of Britain: shows the German Junkers Ju 87 Stuka and Heinkel He 111 bombers which were types used during the Battle of Britain.

===Hangar 6, RAF in an Age of Uncertainty===

<doc id="710092" wikidata="Q1173639" url="?curid=710092" title="David Ball (electronic musician)">
<text>David James Ball (born 3 May 1959) is an English producer and electronic musician, who has played in bands such as Soft Cell and the Grid, and collaborated with other producers including Ingo Vauk and Chris Braide. He is usually called Dave Ball on record sleeves.

==Life and career==
Ball was born in Chester, Cheshire, England, later adopted and brought up in Blackpool. He studied at Arnold School before studying art at Leeds Polytechnic, where he met Marc Almond; they formed the synthpop duo Soft Cell in 1978, the band lasting until 1984. In 1983, while with the group, he released a solo album, &quot;In Strict Tempo&quot;, which featured Gavin Friday, Genesis P-Orridge and Virginia Astley. Later he collaborated with P-Orridge on the soundtrack for the West German film &quot;Decoder&quot;, which also featured other Some Bizzare artists.

After Soft Cell disbanded, Ball formed a new band, Other People with his then-wife Gini Hewes (who previously worked with Almond in Marc and the Mambas) and Andy Astle, but they released only one single, &quot;Have a Nice Day&quot;. In the late 1980s, he formed another short-lived band, English Boy on the Loveranch, with Nick Sanderson and Jamie Jones, releasing two hi-NRG singles, &quot;The Man in Your Life&quot; and &quot;Sex Vigilante&quot;. He also was part of Psychic TV, working on the compilation albums &quot;Jack the Tab&quot; and &quot;Tekno Acid Beat&quot;, where he met Richard Norris (they recorded the track &quot;Meet Every Situation Head On&quot; together as M.E.S.H.) and with whom he later formed the Grid.

Ball reunited with Almond in Soft Cell in 2001, releasing new album &quot;Cruelty Without Beauty&quot;. In 2010, he formed the band Nitewreckage with Celine Hispiche, Rick Mulhall and Terry Neale. Their debut album, &quot;Take Your Money and Run&quot;, was released on Alaska Sounds on 6 June 2011, with the single &quot;Solarcoaster&quot; preceding it. The album was co-produced and mixed by Martin Rushent. In 2016, Ball and classical pianist Jon Savage collaborated on the experimental electronic album &quot;Photosynthesis&quot;. In 2018, Soft Cell saw another reunion for a final live show, celebrating their 40th anniversary since the duo was formed.

Ball also worked as a producer, with Vicious Pink Phenomena (who started as a backing duo for early Soft Cell), the Virgin Prunes and the Rose McDowall side-project Ornamental in the 1980s, and later with Kylie Minogue, Gavin Friday and Anni Hogan. He also remixed for artists and bands such as David Bowie, Vanessa-Mae and Erasure (many remixes were also made with Norris as the Grid). Ball also worked with Friday on a cover of Suicide&#x27;s &quot;Ghost Rider&quot; for the &quot;Alan Vega 70th Birthday Limited Edition EP Series&quot;.

<doc id="710094" wikidata="Q1141706" url="?curid=710094" title="The Peacemaker (1997 film)">
<text>The Peacemaker is a 1997 American political action thriller film starring George Clooney, Nicole Kidman, Armin Mueller-Stahl, Marcel Iureș and Aleksandr Baluev and directed by Mimi Leder. It is the first film distributed by DreamWorks Pictures. While the story takes place all over the world, it was shot primarily in Slovakia with some sequences filmed in New York City and Philadelphia. The basis for the film was the 1997 book &quot;One Point Safe&quot; by Andrew and Leslie Cockburn, about the state of Russia&#x27;s nuclear arsenal.

==Plot==
Outside a church celebrating an Eastern Orthodox baptism in Pale, Bosnia, the Bosnian Finance Minister, a moderate pushing for peace in the ongoing Yugoslav Wars, is murdered.

At a missile base in Kartaly (Chelyabinsk Oblast), Russia, ten nuclear warheads that belong to a SS-18 Satan ICBM are loaded onto a train for transport to a dismantling facility. However, Russian Army General Aleksandr Kodoroff, along with a rogue Spetznaz unit, kills the soldiers on board and transfers nine warheads to another train.

Kodoroff then activates the timer on the remaining warhead and sends the transport on a collision course with a passenger train. The 500-kiloton warhead eventually detonates, killing thousands of civilians and delaying an investigation of the accident.

The detonation attracts the attention of the US government. Dr. Julia Kelly, head of the NSC Nuclear Smuggling Group, believes that Chechen terrorists are behind the incident.

Former US Army Ranger and Special Forces turned Military Intelligence Lieutenant Colonel Thomas Devoe interrupts her briefing to suggest that the incident was staged to hide the hijacking of the warheads. A call to Devoe&#x27;s friend and Russian counterpart, FSB Colonel Dimitri Vertikoff, adds reliability to his theory, and he is assigned as Kelly&#x27;s military liaison.

Kelly and Devoe secure information about the terrorists&#x27; hijacking operation through an Austrian trucking company that works as a front for the Russian Mafia. They meet Vertikoff in Vienna and assume identities to visit Shummaker, who organizes the Russian trucking.

After Devoe tortures Shummaker for information, he and Kelly leave the building and get in Vertikoff&#x27;s car. They are chased by Shumaker&#x27;s men, who kill Vertikoff while he is offering a bribe. Devoe shoots at the attackers and drives away but finds he and Kelly are being followed. Another chase ensues, followed by a crash, but Devoe and Kelly escape.

Information from the trucking company says that the nukes are going to Iran via Azerbaijan. When US spy satellites place the truck in a traffic jam of refugees in Dagestan, Devoe uses a ruse to identify it. This information is passed on to Russian authorities, hoping to stop the transfer to Iran. The Russian military stops Kodoroff at a roadblock, but he and his men kill the soldiers.

Devoe leads an airborne Special Operations team from a U.S. base in Turkey to stop them. Denied entry into Russian airspace, one of the three Special Ops helicopters is shot down by a Russian missile, but the remaining two manage to locate Kodoroff&#x27;s truck. Firing missiles which disable Kodoroff&#x27;s truck, they then engage in a gunfight, killing Kodoroff and securing the warheads. However, interrogation of the group&#x27;s surviving member, a U.S.-educated Pakistani nuclear scientist, reveals that one warhead had been sent off with an operative before the truck was intercepted.

The information from the trucking company leads IFOR to a Sarajevo address. Inside is a video cassette of Dušan Gavrić, a Bosnian who disclaims allegiance to any particular faction in the Yugoslav Wars, but blames other countries for supplying weapons to all sides in the conflict. Kelly&#x27;s further analysis of the trucking company documents suggests that Gavrić intends to bomb a meeting at the UN headquarters in NYC. Gavrić arrives in Manhattan with the Bosnian diplomatic delegation, having replaced the murdered Finance Minister.

Gavrić actually wants to avenge the death of his wife and daughter, who died in Sarajevo during a sniper attack. He and his brother are later found by Devoe and Kelly. When his brother is killed by Devoe, a wounded and enraged Gavrić flees into a parochial school. Devoe and Kelly confront Gavrić, who commits suicide, knowing that the bomb is set to go off in minutes.

With only seconds to spare, Dr. Kelly manages to remove part of the bomb&#x27;s explosive lens shell and stop the primary explosion from establishing critical mass within the plutonium core. The primary explosives detonate, wrecking the church, as Devoe and Kelly dive out of a window. However, Kelly&#x27;s efforts prevent it from causing a nuclear explosion.

Kelly later is seen swimming laps in a pool. Devoe stops by and asks her out for a drink, which she accepts.

==Cast==

==Production==
&quot;The Peacemaker&quot; is inspired by an unpublished Vanity Fair article written by journalists Andrew Cockburn and Leslie Redlich Cockburn. The film marked the inaugural release from DreamWorks Pictures. George Clooney had initially been set to do a &quot;Green Hornet&quot; movie at Universal Pictures starring alongside Jason Scott Lee with Sam Raimi directing, but as DreamWorks&#x27; co-founder Steven Spielberg&#x27;s other company Amblin Television produced &quot;ER&quot;, Clooney opted to sign on for &quot;The Peacemaker&quot;.

In retrospect, Director Mimi Leder said: “I wish they would make more movies like that,&quot; she admits wistfully. &quot;And I would make them because that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m interested in! It was a very exciting experience to be able to keep &quot;The Peacemaker&quot; grounded in the real world. We actually shot the New York chase sequences first, and we were working at such a high level. We were like, &#x27;Is it too big?&#x27; But you can&#x27;t be too big in a chase where you&#x27;re trying to save the world from a nuke!&quot;

==Release==

===Box office===
&quot;The Peacemaker&quot; earned $41,263,140 in the US and $69,200,000 elsewhere, bringing its total to $110,463,140.

===Critical reception===
 Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;B+&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot; gave praise to Clooney and Kidman for portraying a &quot;charming rogue&quot; and expressing &quot;womanly professionalism as fierce, hostile sternness&quot; in their respective roles and Leder&#x27;s direction of the movie&#x27;s action setpieces, highlighting the Manhattan climax for having &quot;crisp economy and furious energy&quot; throughout the scene. Marc Savlov of &quot;The Austin Chronicle&quot; said that despite the &quot;ever-present plot holes and isoscelean character arcs&quot; throughout the film&#x27;s story and villains, he praised Leder&#x27;s directorial skills for keeping things fresh throughout the runtime and adding &quot;clever swagger&quot; to the action scenes, concluding that: &quot;By no means an embarrassment to the fledgling DreamWorks, &quot;The Peacemaker&quot; is instead a grand, noisy step in the right direction. What next, indeed?&quot; Roger Ebert commended the &quot;technical credits&quot; and both Clooney and Kidman for expertly fulfilling their roles but felt the rest of the film was filled with &quot;retreaded&quot; and &quot;off-the-shelf&quot; thriller clichés and concluded with a bomb defusal third act that lacked the &quot;real endings involving character developments and surprises&quot; found in similar films like &quot;The Edge&quot; and &quot;Kiss the Girls&quot;. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;″s Owen Gleiberman gave the film an overall &quot;C+&quot; grade, giving Leder&#x27;s direction credit for staging her scenes with &quot;crisp exactitude, [and with] a pleasing flair for &quot;rhythmic&quot; visual detail&quot; and adding &quot;elegant and accomplished&quot; atmospherics, but felt that it amounts to being &quot;a well-crafted, utterly generic genre piece&quot; that carries &quot;an air of self-important solemnity that borders on the overblown&quot;, concluding that: &quot;In &quot;The Peacemaker&quot;, nothing escapes the taint of cliche. As the inaugural feature from DreamWorks, the picture is vaguely depressing, because it suggests that the studio’s creators are working so laboriously to manufacture a hit that they’ve forgotten to put in the dream.&quot; James Berardinelli criticized the over-long runtime of the movie&#x27;s &quot;paper-thin plot&quot;, the &quot;lack of creativity&quot; in the death scenes and failing to sympathize with the villains&#x27; plight, concluding that: &quot;&quot;The Peacemaker&quot; isn&#x27;t much better or worse than the average James Bond movie, except, of course, that it doesn&#x27;t have the cars, the gadgets, the girls, or Bond himself. There&#x27;s a certain appeal to the premise, but the execution is uneven. The movie is likely to keep an audience&#x27;s attention, but it&#x27;s the kind of film that is quickly forgotten.&quot;

<text>Tad Martin is a fictional character from the American daytime drama, &quot;All My Children&quot;. Tad was played by three actors, according to the age of the character: Matthew Anton, John E. Dunn, and Michael E. Knight. Knight has portrayed the role on and off from 1983 until the series finale in 2011. Tad represents the good on the show, often butting heads with &quot;villains&quot; like Adam Chandler. He is perhaps the best male friend to Erica Kane. His relationship with Dixie Cooney made them a favorite of fans, reaching supercouple status. Under secrecy, Knight returned for the first-season finale of Prospect Park&#x27;s version of &quot;All My Children&quot; on September 2, 2013.

==Development and casting==
Portrayer Michael E. Knight was surprised at the reaction he got during the Tad the Cad era. In 1984, he said, &quot;It&#x27;s so weird. I&#x27;m playing a jerk. No one should like Tad Martin. But the letters I get...I feel like writing back and saying, &#x27;Don&#x27;t you see, people like that can only hurt you. You don&#x27;t aspire to be like them.&quot;

Knight has won three Daytime Emmys for his portrayal of Tad Martin. He won the Daytime Emmy Awards for Outstanding Younger Actor twice in 1986 and 1987, and won the Supporting Actor trophy in 2001. He is one of the very few actors to be nominated in younger, supporting, and lead actor categories, all while portraying the same character.

In 2021, Wally Kurth revealed that he had auditioned for the role of Tad.

==Storylines==
Thaddeus James &quot;Tad&quot; Gardner is written into &quot;All My Children&quot; November 14, 1972. Tad (then Matthew Anton), whose birthdate is noted as September 1, 1963, is beaten and abandoned (off-screen) by his biological father Ray Gardner (Gil Rogers). Tad is found in a Pine Valley park by Dr. Jeff Martin (Charles Frank) and his fiancée, nurse Mary Kennicott (Susan Blanchard), who become Tad&#x27;s foster parents. When Mary is killed during a home invasion, Jeff asks his parents, Dr. Joe (Ray MacDonnell) and nurse Ruth Martin (Mary Fickett), and grandmother, Kate Martin (Kay Campbell), to care for Tad. Ray returns and tries to sell Tad to the Martins for $15,000. Angered at their refusal to pay, Ray rapes Ruth. When Ray is sent to prison for the crime, Tad is formally adopted by the Martins. He develops a close relationship with his adoptive grandmother. But despite this, Tad (then John E. Dunn) proves to be a rebellious teenager. In 1981, he steals the Martins&#x27; car, and runs away from home for two years.

Tad (Michael E. Knight onward, except for a brief appearance by Terrell Anthony in 1990) returns to Pine Valley January 19, 1983, SORASed to age 20. He gets a job modeling for Olga Swenson (Peg Murray). He is nicknamed &quot;Tad the Cad&quot; because he seduces and dumps many women. He is once caught in Erica Kane&#x27;s bedroom with another model, which costs him his job. He begins seeing Liza Colby (Marcy Walker, briefly Alice Haining in 1984), a rival of his biological sister, Jenny Gardner (Kim Delaney) for the affections of Greg Nelson (Laurence Lau). Tad has a simultaneous affair with Liza&#x27;s mother, Marian Colby (Jennifer Bassey) which is eventually discovered by a furious Liza.

In 1984, Edna Thornton Ferguson (Sandy Gabriel) pays Tad to date her daughter, Dottie Thornton (Tasia Valenza) at the same time, he falls in love with Hillary Wilson (Carmen Thomas), step-daughter of town matriarch Phoebe Tyler Wallingford (Ruth Warrick) and daughter of Langley Wallingford (Louis Edmonds) Tad&#x27;s sister Jenny is killed in a jet ski explosion, and Hillary reaches out to help him cope with his loss, but encourages him to do right by Dottie when he gets her pregnant. Tad and Hillary end their relationship, and he marries Dottie. She has miscarried, but hides this from him as she knows he would not marry her otherwise. Meanwhile, Hillary captures the attention of Tad&#x27;s friend, Bob Georgia (Peter Strong) who soon learns he is terminally ill. She agrees to marry him to make his last days happy. Before the wedding, he discovers he was misdiagnosed and is not going to die, but keeps quiet because he fears losing Hillary to Tad, who is now having his marriage to Dottie annulled after discovering her deception.

In 1985, Tad&#x27;s beloved grandmother Kate dies. He later finds out that Bob is lying about his condition, leading to Hillary and Bob&#x27;s divorce. She and Tad marry in 1986. Hillary discovers con artist Wade Matthews (Christopher Holder) has evil intentions toward her stepmother, Phoebe, and that Tad knows but is keeping it secret under threat of blackmail. Between the stress of this revelation and Hillary&#x27;s focus on law school, Tad succumbs to the attentions of a lounge singer, who is revealed to be Adam Chandler&#x27;s estranged daughter, Skye Chandler (Antoinette Byron, then Robin Christopher) despite desperate attempts to gain Hillary&#x27;s forgiveness after she finds out about Tad&#x27;s infidelity, she ends their marriage. A broken-hearted Tad leaves Pine Valley in 1986 to make a fresh start.

Tad returns to Pine Valley in 1988. He quickly has an affair with Barbara Montgomery (Susan Pratt), and then meets billionaire Adam&#x27;s (David Canary) new maid, Dixie Cooney (Cady McClain). Adam hires Dixie, the niece of his bitter business rival Palmer Cortlandt (James Mitchell), with the ulterior motive of producing a son, an heir to the Chandler fortune. His affair with Dixie ruins his marriage with Brooke English (Julia Barr). Adam and Dixie then marry, with Dixie giving birth to their son, Adam Chandler Jr. (called Junior as a child, JR as a teen and adult). Dixie falls in love with Tad. They begin an affair. When Adam finds out, he gaslights Dixie and commits her to a mental institution, getting custody of their son. Tad rescues Dixie from the institution and helps her win back custody of Junior. They marry in 1989, but the marriage does not last long.

Tad&#x27;s biological mother, Opal Cortlandt (now Jill Larson), returns to Pine Valley, and helps Palmer break up the couple. They pay a woman to tell Dixie that she slept with Tad, leading to Dixie separating from him. Devastated, Tad falls into an affair with Brooke. Dixie finds out and divorces him. Shortly thereafter, the evil pimp Billy Clyde Tuggle (Matthews Cowles), who is obsessed with Dixie, kidnaps her in an effort to force her to marry him. Tad rescues Dixie, and they realize they still love each other and make plans to remarry. On their wedding day, Tad and Billy Clyde get into a fight. They both fall off a bridge into the river. Only Billy Clyde&#x27;s body is found, and it is assumed that Tad is dead. His &quot;death&quot; rocks both Dixie and Brooke. Brooke had been told she would never be able to conceive another child, but discovers she is pregnant by Tad, and has a son, who she calls Jamie (for Tad&#x27;s middle name of James). She initially keeps the identity of Jamie&#x27;s father a secret from all but her aunt Phoebe, but eventually shares the news with Tad&#x27;s loved ones.

Meanwhile, Tad drags himself from the river, with no memory of who he is, and hitchhikes to California. He gets a job at Orsini Vineyards, where the owner, Nola Orsini (Barbara Rush), says that he is the spitting image of her missing son, Ted Orsini, who was kidnapped as a child, and insists Tad is him. She takes him in, trains him to run the vineyards, and makes him her heir, completely convinced he is her lost son. Tad (as Ted) is doing business in New York City with Dimitri Marick (Michael Nader) and is invited to Wildwind, the Marick estate in Pine Valley. Nola accompanies &quot;Ted&quot; on the visit to Pine Valley and becomes gravely ill, ending up in the hospital. While being treated, Nola meets and befriends Dixie - completely unaware Dixie is the mystery woman &quot;Ted&quot; is having memories of. During this visit to Pine Valley, &quot;Ted&quot; only ever encounters residents who never met Tad and very narrowly avoids meeting with any of Tad&#x27;s loved ones. The only exception was an incident where &quot;Ted&quot; rescues Junior in the park; Junior recognizes him as Tad, but &quot;Ted&quot; leaves the scene before running into anyone else who would recognize him. Nola eventually puts it all together but before she can tell Tad, she dies of heart failure - leaving Tad her fortune. Concurrently, &quot;Ted&quot; meets investigative reporter (and Brooke&#x27;s finacé) Edmund Grey (John Callahan) and asks him to look into the name Billy Clyde Tuggle, a name &quot;Ted&quot; is remembering but doesn&#x27;t know why. Edmund eventually discovers &quot;Ted&quot; might actually be Tad and shares this information with Brooke. Brooke travels to Napa Valley, CA for Nola&#x27;s funeral hoping to determine if &quot;Ted&quot; is Tad. Brooke sees him and discovers that he is really Tad. She helps him to regain his memory and introduces him to Jamie. Meeting up with Dixie again, his feelings for her return, but they decide that he belongs with his son and Brooke.

The real Ted Orsini (also Michael E. Knight) eventually arrives in Pine Valley, showing up injured at a cabin Dixie is staying in while sorting out her feelings for Tad. Dixie initially believes he is Tad, causing her to miss Tad and Brooke&#x27;s wedding which she intended to prevent by telling Tad she loves him. Brooke and Tad marry, but the union is doomed from the start due to the unresolved feelings Tad and Dixie share. Ted and Tad face off several times, with the ever-scowling Ted expressing his resentment over what he perceived as Tad usurping a life that was rightfully Ted&#x27;s. Dixie spends a fair amount of time during this period trying to convince the residents of Pine Valley that Ted is misunderstood, but eventually even she realizes he is a lost cause. After one last standoff between Ted and Tad in Canada, Ted is shot and never seen or heard from again. Tad and Dixie embark on an affair that eventually causes an acrimonious end of his marriage to Brooke. At this same time, Brooke discovers she is pregnant again by Tad. She initially hopes this news might sway Tad&#x27;s feelings about ending their marriage, but the pregnancy is discovered to be ectopic and is terminated to save Brooke&#x27;s life. Brooke eventually realizes the marriage won&#x27;t work, and tells Tad to go back to Dixie. Tad and Dixie get married for the second time in 1994.

Tad falls back into his old ways and has an affair with Liza. He and Dixie divorce again and she moves back to her hometown of Pigeon Hollow, WV. Tad strikes up a renewed friendship with Dixie&#x27;s good friend, nurse Gloria Marsh (Teresa Blake). The relationship soon blossoms into a romantic one. Dimitri seduces Gloria away from Tad and back into his life. Gloria defends Dimitri&#x27;s unsavory actions to Tad unwaveringly. The final straw for Gloria comes when Tad and Dimitri&#x27;s half-brother Edmund trick Dimitri into confessing all of his misdeeds, and she overhears the entire conversation. Enraged at his deception, Gloria leaves him. Later on, after apologizing to Tad for being so taken in by Dimitri&#x27;s lies, Gloria leaves town to sort out her life.

In 1998, Adam Chandler wants Adam Jr. to come home, and along with him comes Dixie, who refuses to have anything to do with Tad at first. Tad&#x27;s biological mother Opal had married Dixie&#x27;s uncle Palmer, and when things start to sour in their marriage, Tad and Dixie get together to help them out. After tailing Palmer to New York City, they find themselves sharing a hotel room. Their true feelings for each other surface. Needing time to think things out, they make a plan to meet at the top of the Statler Building if they each decide they really love each other and want to be together. Tad sits waiting for hours to see if she would show, but, while on her way to meet him, she fell ill. Tad believes she did not come because she decided she did not want to reconcile. Dixie cares so much for Tad that she does not want to burden him with her health problems – a failed kidney and a weak heart. With Liza&#x27;s help, he soon learns about Dixie&#x27;s condition and goes to her. He stays by her side, proving his undying love, and once again proposing marriage to her. She accepts, and in 1999, Tad and Dixie marry for the third time.

Liza marries Adam, and when they began having problems, Tad conspires with her to successfully take over control of Chandler Enterprises. Dixie becomes pregnant. Knowing it could kill her, she decides to keep the pregnancy from Tad because she knew he would tell her to terminate it for her health&#x27;s sake. He did eventually find out, and accepts her decision to carry the baby, but she miscarries. Dixie then takes a job working as an assistant for renowned cardiologist Dr. David Hayward (Vincent Irizarry) at the hospital. Tad, knowing a cad when he sees one, becomes wary of David&#x27;s constant need for Dixie&#x27;s assistance. Tad has the opportunity to meet David&#x27;s lawyer, Leslie Coulson (Colleen Dion). She turns out to be the little sister of one of Tad&#x27;s old high school girlfriends and reveals that she always had a crush on him. Soon, with Leslie&#x27;s unrequited love for Tad and David&#x27;s obsession with Dixie, the happy reunion of Tad and Dixie begins to crumble. With a little help from David&#x27;s experimental drug, Libidizone, Leslie and David&#x27;s little plan works like a charm. At a party where David dumps his sex drug into the punch, Leslie lures Tad to bed. Although he cannot recall sleeping with Leslie, it still accomplishes its goal to put another wedge in the relationship of Tad and Dixie. Dixie grows closer to David, unaware of what actually happened. When all is revealed, Dixie leaves David and goes back to Tad. Leslie goes crazy and is sent away to a rest home. Later, Tad brings Leslie back to town to help him get even with David, but instead Leslie attacks Tad and almost kills him. Dixie, not understanding how Tad could have brought the menacing Leslie back into their lives for something as stupid as revenge, loses her trust in Tad once more, and they divorce again in January 2002.

Shortly after the divorce, Dixie and Tad reunite again, and Dixie becomes pregnant. David secretly arranges for her to stay at a special clinic in Switzerland. Tad and JR (Dixie&#x27;s son, then Jonathan Bennett) are puzzled by her sudden disappearance. When Dixie is close to her delivery date, and everything is going well health-wise, she decides to tell Tad everything, and they make arrangements for him to be there for the birth of their daughter. As Tad goes to the airport, heading for Zürich, Opal receives a phone call and rushes to tell Brooke the horrible news. Brooke hurries to board the plane to tell Tad that there has been an auto accident and Dixie has been killed. The car has gone over a cliff and they couldn&#x27;t find her body. Tad is devastated. Stuck to his seat, unable to move from shock, the two of them head for Switzerland. They go to Dixie&#x27;s apartment, where they find that she had prepared a special evening. A framed baby sonogram sits on the table with the name &quot;Kate Martin&quot; on it. They gather up Dixie&#x27;s things and return home. Tad takes a long time to mourn the death of his beloved Dixie and their unborn daughter.

In 2003, Tad begins to emerge from his dark place when he enlists his investigator skills to help Brooke find out if Maria Santos Grey (Eva La Rue) is still alive. The woman known as Maureen Gorman does indeed turn out to be Maria, and now he must find out how she lost her memory and who could have saved her from the plane crash. When it is revealed that David Hayward is involved, Tad and most of Pine Valley go after him. David found Maria and gave her his experimental drugs to save her life, then sent her away and gave her a new name to protect himself. When David is freed from the criminal charges filed against him, Tad is furious. He really wants to see David behind bars for good. Tad decides to start up his private investigating business again after Adam fires him from his position at Chandler Enterprises. Liza has a new business venture with some of the young women of Pine Valley, Fusion, and soon calls on Tad for help. Doing research for Fusion, he gets to know the girls there well, and finds himself slightly smitten with the marketing director, Simone Torres (Terri Ivens), whom Tad sums up as &quot;one hot tamale&quot;. The begin a mutually exclusive &quot;booty call&quot; type relationship, all in fun and very hot.

When JR returns home after running off to join the Merchant Marines in the aftermath of his mother&#x27;s death, he surprises everyone by presenting to them his new wife, Babe Carey (Alexa Havins, later Amanda Baker), a pretty blonde he met in San Diego. Tad discovers that Babe seduced his son Jamie (Micah Alberti, later Justin Bruening) the very night she and JR returned to Pine Valley, and begins to investigate her. He locates her mother, Krystal Carey (Bobbie Eakes), and brings her to Pine Valley. Tad is helping Liza with her Adam problems, and she is finding that her feelings for Tad were returning - and he is feeling some of the same in return, so he is soon involved with both Simone and Liza. With Krystal now in town and involved in the JR/Babe/Jamie triangle, she starts butting heads with Tad. Their fights always seem to turn into hot passion. Tad is dividing his time between three women. When Jamie calls him on how &quot;caddish&quot; that is, Tad breaks it off with all three. His constant association with Krystal makes her too hard to avoid. Tad and Krystal become a couple.

In 2004, Babe and Erica Kane&#x27;s daughter, Bianca Montgomery (Eden Riegel), are both pregnant, and they go into labor while stranded in a cabin in the woods. Bianca has a girl and Babe a boy. Babe&#x27;s ex-husband Paul Cramer (Brock Cuchna, later Shane McRae and then David Tom), in a crossover role from &quot;One Life to Live&quot;, flies his helicopter in to help. He takes Babe&#x27;s son, telling her Bianca&#x27;s baby girl is hers and that Bianca&#x27;s baby has died. Babe, having been drugged, believes this for a while. When she remembers that she did have a boy, and that Bess Chandler must be Bianca&#x27;s baby, she and Krystal decide to keep up the facade for the sake of JR, who has fallen in love with his &quot;daughter.&quot; Tad suggests DNA tests after he suspects the baby might be Bianca&#x27;s. Krystal switches the results. Tad is convinced and asks Krystal to marry him. She is wracked with guilt and keeps putting him off. When Tad finds out about the deception, he is angry, but decides to keep the secret. To make matters worse, David turns out to be Babe&#x27;s biological father, and wants to bond with Babe and Krystal. When JR becomes angry at Babe and Jamie for their affair, he divorces her and gets sole custody of Bess. Babe and Krystal discover that Babe&#x27;s son is still alive, living with Paul&#x27;s sister Kelly Cramer (Heather Tom) and her husband Kevin Buchanan (Dan Gauthier) in Llanview, Pennsylvania. Jamie and Babe come up with a plan to kidnap her baby back and they set out as fugitives, checking in with Tad and Krystal periodically, as they cross over to &quot;One Life to Live&quot;. Tad, even though he has mixed feelings, arranges for them to get new ID and passports to get out of the United States. Tad wants to tell Bianca the truth, but Krystal begs him not to. After an altercation with JR, Bianca lays in a coma. Erica feels that being reunited with baby Miranda is the only way to save Bianca. She, Tad, and Adam confront JR with the truth. After Tad takes Bess from JR&#x27;s arms, JR says that he no longer regards Tad as his father.

Liza contacts Tad after she finds Jamie and Babe hiding in New Orleans. Adam and JR&#x27;s thugs are closing in. The authorities take the young couple into custody. Tad is facing accessory charges for the kidnapping of Adam Chandler III. Krystal makes a plea-bargain and takes full responsibility for everything. Tad and Krystal spend her last night before prison together. After Edmund Grey is murdered, his son, Sam (Bobby Steggert), begins acting out. Sam is biologically Tad&#x27;s adoptive great-nephew. Sam wants to learn more about his biological family, so he moves in with the Martins. At the same time, Tad discovers Julia Santos (Sydney Penny) hiding in Wildwind, having escaped Witness Protection to confront the crime lord who killed her husband. Julia and Sam reunite in Tad&#x27;s attic.

Tad is in for the shock of his life when Diana, the Chandlers&#x27; nanny, is revealed to be Dixie. She tells Tad she did not want to come back to Pine Valley because she lost Kate and is not sure if she wants to reunite with Tad. Tad proposes to Krystal again, but it is clear he has feelings for Di. At a memorial service for Kate, Krystal comes in with shocking news. Di is not Dixie, but an inmate Krystal met in prison. Di maintains her identity, even taking a DNA test. Tad continues to believe Di, ending his engagement with Krystal. Di is somehow linked to the crime lord, The Dragon, who wants Julia dead. Di gives Stuart Chandler (David Canary) a note to be given to JR only if she did not come back. Tad convinces Stuart to give him the letter. Tad finds Di and Julia standing over The Dragon&#x27;s dead body. After making sure Di is safe, Tad reveals he knows the truth. Di is not Dixie, but her younger half-sister. Di&#x27;s deception further estranges JR and Tad. On Christmas Eve 2005, Di leaves town to visit a very much alive Dixie in Vienna.

Tad tries to push Di away for all the pain she has caused, but he cannot, as he has fallen in love with her. They make plans to marry, but their romance comes to a halt when Tad comes face to face with Dixie at David&#x27;s cabin, and is overjoyed to see her alive. Di admits that she knew Dixie was alive the whole time. Tad is angry and rejects her. Dixie tells Tad that Kate is alive somewhere. Thinking she was dying after the accident, she signed Kate away to Dr. Greg Madden (Ian Buchanan), who tricked her into believing Tad could not love the child due to the painful memories associated with her birth. Tad then rejects Dixie for her decision. Dejected, he turns back to Krystal. Tad begins the search for his lost daughter. Getting nowhere, he kidnaps Greg and buries him alive. He is planning to dig him up after he reveals the location of Kate. But Greg never broke. He dies when his coffin caves in. Tad is horrified at what he did for love.

Dixie and Zach Slater (Thorsten Kaye) go to trial for Greg&#x27;s murder. On the witness stand, Tad tries to incriminate Dixie. In front of their sons, he berates their mother for abandoning them. Dixie is shocked to see Tad&#x27;s true feelings come out. Her attorney is able to discredit his testimony, and the jury acquits them both. Tad reveals to Dixie it was his ploy to stop the investigation into Greg&#x27;s murder because he had committed the crime. Dixie and Tad finally begin to make peace, and he forgives her for all she has done. The family reunites at Christmas, and Tad and Dixie finally have a wonderful holiday with their sons. Tad realizes how much he still loves his ex-wife, and Dixie clearly loves Tad. They begin to plan a future together once again, but a tragic turn of events occur. In January 2007, Dixie eats a plate of poisoned pancakes meant for her daughter-in-law Babe, and she begins to have pains in her heart. She immediately collapses of a massive heart attack. Despite prompt medical attention, she dies in the emergency room, with Tad at her side. Her last words were to Tad: &quot;together forever&quot;.

Tad grows close to Jim and Linda Mershon&#x27;s adopted daughter, Kathy (Alexa Gerasimovich). Julia, who was named as Kathy&#x27;s guardian, acts uncomfortable when Kathy asks Tad to be her new father after her parents are killed in a car accident. Kathy helps Tad cope with his loss. Krystal, who has married Adam, reveals the child she is pregnant with is Tad&#x27;s, not Adam&#x27;s. Adam reacts by kicking his wife out. Krystal and Tad&#x27;s baby is named Jenny, for Tad&#x27;s late sister. Days after Jenny&#x27;s birth, Janet Green (Kate Collins) kidnaps her from the neonatal ward. It is revealed Adam influenced Janet to escape the mental ward and steal Jenny. Adam intended to sell Jenny on the black market. Luckily, Janet comes to her senses and returns Jenny to her parents. Adam refuses to relent in his influence over Krystal&#x27;s life. Wanting to protect Jenny and Krystal from Adam, Tad asks Krystal to marry him again. They enter a marriage of convenience on December 26, 2007.

Various people from Tad&#x27;s past come back to Pine Valley. Joe Martin asks Dr Angie Hubbard (Debbi Morgan) to consult with him on a case. Jesse and Angie&#x27;s son, Frank Hubbard (Cornelius Smith Jr.), becomes ill after ingesting a toxin in the Pine Valley woods. The ordeal brings someone surprising out of hiding, Jesse Hubbard (Darnell Williams), who had never died. A crime lord, called The Papel, had threatened to hurt his family, thinking Jesse was in the possession of a rare uncut diamond. Krystal stages it so Angie and Jesse see each other again.

Seeing that Angie causes Jesse to let down his guard, Robert Gardner (David Rasche) comes to town. Robert was Ray&#x27;s brother and is Tad&#x27;s uncle. Tad wants nothing to do with Robert. However, he somehow charms Opal and Krystal. Robert is, in fact, The Papel. He shows his true colors at Jesse and Angie&#x27;s wedding. He shoots and kills Julia; Tad also gets caught in the line of fire, falls into a coma, and is visited by Dixie&#x27;s spirit. Dixie and Tad live their lives together as if her accident in Switzerland never happened. Tad wants to stay with Dixie in Heaven, but she implores him to wake up because someone in Pine Valley needs him. Adam reveals he knows Kathy is Kate. Kathy has a hard time adjusting to life with the Martins, especially with Krystal.

When another tornado blows through Pine Valley - which kills Babe - Tad is haunted by his past. David makes his way back to town the same night. David blames Babe&#x27;s death on JR&#x27;s family. Tad hears that Jamie and Jeff are reported missing in the Congo, and so he goes to investigate the situation himself. What he does not know is that the news is part of David&#x27;s plot to break up the Martins. While Tad is away, David drugs and seduces Krystal.

After learning about Krystal&#x27;s night with David, Tad throws her out and wins full custody of Jenny in January 2009. Krystal files for divorce from Tad. He then begins working for Ryan Lavery (Cameron Mathison), doing an undercover investigation of Dr Riley Sinclair (McKenzie Westmore). The following Monday, Tad and Krystal settle their divorce right before Tad&#x27;s friend, Greenlee Smythe (Rebecca Budig) is supposedly killed in a tragic accident. That May, Tad gets shot again by Jesse, because Jesse thought Tad was the murderer who killed Stuart. Tad begins to regain his memories from the night of the shooting, seeing Annie Lavery (Melissa Claire Egan), Kendall Hart (Alicia Minshew) and Emma Lavery (Lucy Merriam) in his visions of the night of Stuart&#x27;s death. His step-son JR (now Jacob Young) is diagnosed with cancer. Meanwhile, Tad takes in the young, troubled Damon Miller (Finn Wittrock). He learns that Damon is the son of Hillary Wilson, his ex-wife. Tad, Jesse and Angie come to the conclusion that Damon could be Tad&#x27;s son, which Tad then tells Krystal and Opal. On March 17, 2010, Tad receives the DNA results confirming that Damon is his son. Tad wants to confront Hillary, but she is not in her hotel room and does not answer her phone. Paul Miller (Robert Curtis Brown) Damon&#x27;s step-father, comes to take Damon home, but Tad refuses to allow it because of how Paul has treated Damon. Damon overhears his paternity at the park, while Liza is arguing with Colby. Tad catches up with Damon at the hospital the next day and tries to explain why he didn&#x27;t tell him sooner, but Damon doesn&#x27;t want to have anything to do with him.

In March 2011, Tad marries Cara Castillo (Lindsay Hartley) so that she would not be deported - unaware that Dixie is actually alive. That September, Tad and Dixie - who has returned from the dead again - get engaged, despite him still being married to Cara. In May 2013, Tad was revealed to be out on the field on a case. In September 2013, Jesse contacts Tad for help regarding Russian criminal Yuri Koslov, suggesting that Tad may be returning to Pine Valley in the immediate future.

==Reception==
In 2024, Charlie Mason from &quot;Soaps She Knows&quot; placed Tad ninth on his ranked list of &quot;Soaps&#x27; 40 Most Iconic Characters of All Time&quot;, writing, &quot;Michael E. Knight&#x27;s tireless womanizer earned his &quot;Tad the Cad&quot; nickname the fun way. Well, not so much fun for all of the brokenhearted lovers he left in his wake. But fun for him, anyway&quot;.

<text>The swimming competitions at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney took place from 16 to 23 September 2000 at the Sydney International Aquatic Centre in Homebush Bay. It featured 32 events (16 male, 16 female), and a total of 954 swimmers from 150 nations.

The swimming program for 2000 was expanded from 1996, with the inclusion of the semifinal phase in each of the events except for some special cases. Long-distance swimming events (400 m freestyle, 800 m freestyle, 1500 m freestyle, and 400 m individual medley) and all relays still maintained the old format with only two phases: heats and final. Because of the radical changes in the competition format, it was extended into an eight-day program and thereby continued into the present era.

Swimmers from the United States were the most successful, winning 14 golds, 8 silver, and 11 bronze to lead the overall medal count with 33. Meanwhile, hosts Australia had produced a total of 18 medals (five golds, nine silver, and four bronze) to claim the second spot in the tally. A total of fourteen world records and thirty-eight Olympic records were set during the competition.

==Events==
The following events were contested (all pool events were long course, and distances are in metres unless stated):
*Freestyle : 50, 100, 200, 400, 800 (women) and 1500 (men);
*Backstroke : 100 and 200;
*Breaststroke : 100 and 200;
*Butterfly : 100 and 200;
*Individual medley : 200 and 400; 
*Relays: 4 × 100 free, 4 × 200 free, and 4 × 100 medley.

<text>In computing, &quot;Press any key to continue&quot; (or a similar text) was a historically used prompt to the user when it was necessary to pause processing. The system would resume after the user pressed any keyboard button.

==History==

Early computers were typically operated using mechanical teleprinters, which provided a continuous printed record of their output. However, during the 1970s, these became obsolete and were replaced with visual display units, and text was lost once it scrolled off the top of the screen. To compensate, programs typically paused operation after displaying one screen of data, so that the user could observe the results and then press a key to move to the next screen.

A similar pause was also required when some physical action was required from the user, such as inserting a floppy disk or loading a printer with paper.

These prompts were commonplace on text-based operating systems prior to the development of graphical user interfaces, which typically included scrollbars to enable the user to view more than one screen/window of data. They are therefore no longer required as a means of paginating output, but the graphical equivalent (such as a modal dialog box containing the text &quot;Click OK to continue&quot;) is still used for hardware interactions.

The prompt (&quot;&quot;any&quot; key&quot;) is not strictly accurate, in that one is required to press a key which generates some sort of character. For the vast majority of computer systems, pressing modifier keys or lock keys would not cause processing to resume, as they do not produce an actual character that the program could detect.

Some Samsung remote controls for DVD players, as is the case of DVD-R130, have included an &quot;anykey&quot; to their interface. It is used to view the status of the DVD being watched.

==Cultural significance==

A 1982 Apple Computer manual for developers warned:

There are reports from as early as 1988 that some users have searched for such a key labelled &quot;any&quot;, and called technical support when they have been unable to find it. The computer company Compaq even edited their FAQ to explain that the &quot;any&quot; key does not exist, and at one point considered replacing the command &quot;Press any key&quot; with &quot;Press return key&quot;.

The concept of the &quot;any key&quot; has become a popular piece of computer-related humor, and was used as a gag on &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, in the seventh-season episode &quot;King-Size Homer&quot;, where Homer Simpson searches the keyboard looking for &quot;the any key&quot;.

Plastic &quot;codice_1 keys&quot; with adhesive backings are available as novelty gifts.

<text>Africa has the longest record of human habitation in the world. The first hominins emerged 6–7 million years ago, and among the earliest anatomically modern human skulls found so far were discovered at Omo Kibish,Jebel Irhoud, and Florisbad.

European archaeology, as well as that of North Africa, is generally divided into the Stone Age (comprising the Lower Paleolithic, the Middle Paleolithic, the Upper Paleolithic, the Mesolithic, and the Neolithic), the Bronze Age, and the Iron Age. For Africa south of the Sahara, African archaeology is classified in a slightly different way, with the Paleolithic generally divided into the Early Stone Age, the Middle Stone Age, and the Later Stone Age. After these three stages come the Pastoral Neolithic, the Iron Age and then later historical periods.

Africa&#x27;s prehistory has been largely ignored, with the exception of research into early human evolution. However, it is overseen by the PanAfrican Archaeological Association, whose members consist of professional archaeologists from all over Africa.

== Early Stone Age Africa ==

The Early Stone Age (ESA), which spanned from approximately 2.6 million years ago (mya) – 280,000 years ago (ya), describes a period in African prehistory in which the first stone tools were developed, including both Oldowan and Acheulean. Early sites along the East African Rift include Lomekwi in the Turkana Basin, Kenya, and Olduvai Gorge farther south in modern-day Tanzania. The earliest hominids were discovered in Ethiopia and titled &quot;Ardipithecus ramidus&quot;. The diverging species of hominin are known as australopithecines and were first discovered in Olduvai. Australopithecines and their fossils include &quot;Paranthropus boisei&quot;, the most famous being nicknamed &quot;Zinj&quot; or &quot;Nutcracker man&quot; by Mary Leakey, the archaeologist who found it. Another older, famous australopithecine, related to those found at Olduvai Gorge but found approximately 2000 kilometers to the north east in the Awash Valley of Ethiopia, is Lucy, who was discovered by Donald Johanson and his team in 1974.

The earliest relative dating for stone tool use was discovered in 2015, by Sonia Harmand, at Lomekwi 3 in West Turkana, Kenya with stone tools dating to 3.3 million years ago. Lomekwi tools differ from Oldowan tools in their primitive technological features making them large and heavy. The Lomekwi are thought to have been made by &quot;Australopithecus afarensis&quot;. Prior to this discovery, some of the oldest stone tools were found at Lokalalei 2C in West Turkana, where artifacts exhibiting knapping processes conducted by &quot;Australopithecus africanus&quot; date to about 2.34 million years ago, marking the beginning of the ESA. Incorporation of tools provided early hominins the ability to respond to changes more readily outside of the immediate needs of daily-life and extended adaptability behavioral patterns into long-term trends experienced over generations.

Around a million years later, &quot;Homo erectus&quot; evolved into a more advanced species and made tools known as the Acheulean handaxes. These handaxes were a multipurpose bifacial technology that remained unchanged for thousands of years. The technology demonstrates an increase in brain development and complexity in &quot;Homo erectus,&quot; as shown by the increased level of forethought and knowledge of material required for production of the tools. &quot;Homo erectus&quot; are also associated with the first instances of &quot;modern human living, such as fire, &quot;modern emotions&quot;, and art. The earliest evidence for hominins controlling fire is found in Wonderwerk Cave, South Africa. Along with their new technologies, they were also a part of the first &quot;Out of Africa&quot; movement and spread to all parts of the world. This movement took place somewhere around 1.8–0.8 million years ago, where &quot;Homo erectus&quot; spread out from Africa and into Eurasia. One of the most notable &quot;Homo erectus&quot; skeletons ever found was that of Nariokotome Boy, who was found near Lake Turkana in Kenya, discovered by Richard Leakey and Kamoya Kimeu. Nariokotome Boy was a teenager when he died, and his skeleton exhibits the first evidence for caring in the archaeological record, because he was cared for through his debilitating scoliosis.

Just recently discovered was a new addition to the line of human ancestors named &quot;Homo naledi&quot;. Found in Rising Star Cave in South Africa, &quot;Homo naledi&quot; is undated but has features of both primitive and modern humans.

== Middle Stone Age Africa ==

The Middle Stone Age (MSA), dating to roughly 280,000 to 40,000 years ago, is characterized by the continuation of hunter-gatherer lifestyles and, as more recently recognized, perhaps the origins of modern human behavior and cognition. Even though hominin species&#x27; brains were reorganized and modernized at a fast rate, the behavior of these hominins did not adapt quite as fast. This caused the hominin species to be quite primitive. African hunter-gatherers hunted larger mammals and relied on an assortment of edible plants, both in the grasslands that are now the Sahara desert, and the rain forests of Central Africa. Coastal peoples also subsisted on seafood and numerous middens indicate their diet.

&quot;Homo sapiens&quot; appear for the first time in the archaeological record around 300–270,000 years ago in Africa. They soon developed a more advanced method of flint tool manufacture involving striking flakes from a prepared core. This permitted more control over the size and shape of finished tool and led to the development of composite tools, projectile points and scrapers, which could be hafted onto spears, arrows or handles. In turn, this technology permitted more efficient hunting such as that demonstrated by the Aterian industry. In eastern Africa, stone tools were made from raw materials such as quartz and obsidian using the prepared core method, which varied by region. It was during the late Middle Pleistocene that many groups began to migrate away from eastern Africa, especially southward. Technological improvements such as Aterian methods and the development of new skills helped these people adapt to new landscapes.

Although still hunter-gatherers, there is evidence that these early humans also actively managed food resources as well as simply harvesting them. The Congo Basin was first occupied around this time; different conditions and diet there produced recognizably different behaviors and tool types. There are also the earliest signs of art appearing through the use of ochre as a body decoration and paint, and burial rituals may have been practiced as well.

Evidence of a variety behaviors indicative of Behavioral modernity date to the African Middle Stone age, associated with early &quot;Homo sapiens&quot;. Abstract imagery, widened subsistence strategies, and other &quot;modern&quot; behaviors have been discovered from that period in Africa, especially South, North, and East Africa. The Blombos Cave site in South Africa, for example, is famous for rectangular slabs of ochre engraved with geometric designs. Using multiple dating techniques, the site was confirmed to be around 77,000 and 100–75,000 years old. Ostrich egg shell containers engraved with geometric designs dating to 60,000 years ago were found at Diepkloof, South Africa. Beads and other personal ornamentation have been found from Morocco which might be as much as 130,000 years old; as well, the Cave of Hearths in South Africa has yielded a number of beads dating from significantly prior to 50,000 years ago. These types of ornamentations represent some of the earliest signs of symbolic behavior amongst human ancestors, including developments in cognition and social relations. The beads from Bizmoune Cave, in southwest Morocco, are thought to be over 142,000 years old. Shell beads dating to about 75,000 years ago have been found at Blombos Cave, South Africa.

Specialized projectile weapons as well have been found at various sites in Middle Stone Age Africa, including bone and stone arrowheads at South African sites such as Sibudu Cave (along with an early bone needle also found at Sibudu) dating approximately 60,000-70,000 years ago, and bone harpoons at the Central African site of Katanda dating to about 90,000 years ago. Evidence also exists for the systematic heat treating of silcrete stone to increase its flake-ability for the purpose of toolmaking, beginning approximately 164,000 years ago at the South African site of Pinnacle Point and becoming common there for the creation of microlithic tools at about 72,000 years ago. Early stone-tipped projectile weapons (a characteristic tool of &quot;Homo sapiens&quot;), the stone tips of javelins or throwing spears, were discovered in 2013 at the Ethiopian site of Gademotta, and date to around 279,000 years ago.

In 2008, an ochre processing workshop likely for the production of paints was uncovered dating to ca. 100,000 years ago at Blombos Cave, South Africa. Analysis shows that a liquefied pigment-rich mixture was produced and stored in the two abalone shells, and that ochre, bone, charcoal, grindstones and hammer-stones also formed a composite part of the toolkits. Evidence for the complexity of the task includes procuring and combining raw materials from various sources (implying they had a mental template of the process they would follow), possibly using pyrotechnology to facilitate fat extraction from bone, using a probable recipe to produce the compound, and the use of shell containers for mixing and storage for later use.&lt;ref name=&quot;Washington Post-2011/10/12/gIQApyHrhL&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
Modern behaviors, such as the making of shell beads, bone tools and arrows, and the use of ochre pigment, are evident at a Kenyan site by 78,000-67,000 years ago.

Expanding subsistence strategies beyond big-game hunting and the consequential diversity in tool types has been noted as signs of behavioral modernity. A number of South African sites have shown an early reliance on aquatic resources from fish to shellfish. Pinnacle Point, in particular, shows exploitation of marine resources as early as 120,000 years ago, perhaps in response to more arid conditions inland. Establishing a reliance on predictable shellfish deposits, for example, could reduce mobility and facilitate complex social systems and symbolic behavior. Blombos Cave and Site 440 in Sudan both show evidence of fishing as well. Taphonomic change in fish skeletons from Blombos Cave have been interpreted as capture of live fish, clearly an intentional human behavior.

Humans in North Africa (Nazlet Sabaha, Egypt) are known to have dabbled in chert mining, as early as ≈100,000 years ago, for the construction of stone tools.

Evidence was found in 2018, dating to about 320,000 years ago, at the Kenyan site of Olorgesailie, of the early emergence of modern behaviors including: long-distance trade networks (involving goods such as obsidian), the use of pigments, and the possible making of projectile points. It is observed by the authors of three 2018 studies on the site, that the evidence of these behaviors is approximately contemporary to the earliest known &quot;Homo sapiens&quot; fossil remains from Africa (such as at Jebel Irhoud and Florisbad), and they suggest that complex and modern behaviors began in Africa around the time of the emergence of &quot;Homo sapiens&quot;.

In 2019, further evidence of early complex projectile weapons in Africa was found at Aduma, Ethiopia, dated 80,000–100,000 years ago, in the form of points considered likely to belong to darts delivered by spear throwers.

== Later Stone Age Africa ==

The Hofmeyr Skull is a specimen of a 36,000-year-old human skull that was found in 1952 near Hofmeyr, South Africa. Osteological analysis of the cranium by the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology indicates that the specimen is morphologically distinct from recent groups in subequatorial Africa, including the local Khoisan populations . The Hofmeyr fossil instead has a very close affinity with other Upper Paleolithic skulls from Europe. Some scientists have interpreted this relationship as being consistent with the Out-of-Africa theory, which hypothesizes that at least some Upper Paleolithic human groups in Africa, Europe and Asia should morphologically resemble each other.

Around 10,000 BCE, African hunter-gatherer societies developed microlith technologies. Composite microlithic tools were useful for harvesting wild grasses and also permitted the production of fine shell and bone fish hooks, which may have allowed for the exploitation of a broader range of food resources. Some of the earliest pottery in Africa has also been found in the Sahara and is associated with hunter/gatherer populations. By 9,400 BCE, in Ounjougou, central Mali, pottery is thought to been independently invented by local hunter-gatherers as they became more sedentary and began to intensively gather local wild grains (such as millet).

Archaeological evidence has attested that population settlements occurred in Nubia as early as the Late Pleistocene era and from the 5th millennium BC onwards, whereas there is &quot;no or scanty evidence&quot; of human presence in the Egyptian Nile Valley during these periods, which may be due to problems in site preservation.

In 2013, Iberomaurusian skeletons from the prehistoric sites of Taforalt and Afalou in the Maghreb were analyzed for ancient DNA. All of the specimens belonged to maternal clades associated with either North Africa or the northern and southern Mediterranean littoral, indicating gene flow between these areas since the Epipaleolithic. The ancient Taforalt individuals carried the mtDNA haplogroups U6, H, JT and V, which points to population continuity in the region dating from the Iberomaurusian period.

There is an on-going debate in regards to using modern-day hunter-gatherer societies, like the San, as an analogy to societies of the Later Stone Age.

== &quot;Pastoral Neolithic&quot; and Neolithic Africa ==

Cultural developments during the early Neolithic led nomadic hunter-gatherer lifestyles to be slowly supplanted by pastoralism in northern Africa. Africa&#x27;s earliest evidence for domesticated animals comes from the Sahara c. 7000-6000 BCE, and evidence for new cattle herding lifestyles are preserved at both archaeological sites such as Gobero and in Saharan rock art. As the Sahara increased in size due to aridification, early pastoralists migrated south and eastwards into the Niger and Nile valleys, bringing with them herding practices that would also spread throughout eastern and southern Africa. The Savanna Pastoral Neolithic and the Elmenteitan material culture traditions are found in eastern Africa. Recent aDNA research has provided evidence for the spread of Pastoral Neolithic herders from eastern Africa into southern Africa.

In the western Sahel the rise of settled communities occurred largely as a result of the domestication of millet and of sorghum. Archaeology points to sizable urban populations in West Africa later, beginning by the 2nd millennium BCE. Symbiotic trade relations developed before the trans-Saharan trade, in response to the opportunities afforded by north–south diversity in ecosystems across deserts, grasslands, and forests. The agriculturists received salt from the desert nomads. The desert nomads acquired meat and other foods from pastoralists and farmers of the grasslands and from fishermen on the Niger River. The forest-dwellers provided furs and meat.

In West Africa, Dhar Tichitt and Oualata in present-day Mauritania figure prominently among the early urban centers, dated to ~2,000 BCE. About 500 stone settlements litter the region in the former savannah of the Sahara. Its inhabitants fished and grew millet. The ancestors of the Soninke, of the Mandé peoples, may have been responsible for constructing such settlements. Around 300 BCE the region became more desiccated and the settlements began to decline, most likely relocating to Koumbi Saleh. Architectural evidence and the comparison of pottery styles suggest that Dhar Tichitt was related to the subsequent Ghana Empire and Djenné-Djenno cultures (in present-day Mali).

== Metal-using Africa ==

Farming societies in Africa developed after the origins and spread of livestock pastoralism throughout the continent. The early use of metallurgy by farming communities may have been developed independently in Africa around 3000-2000 BCE. Pockets of iron usage appeared in subsequent millennia but metal did not supplant stone in the south of the continent until around 500 BCE, when both iron and copper spread southwards through the continent, reaching the Cape around 200 CE. Although some details regarding the Bantu expansion are still controversial amongst archaeologists, linguists, and historians, the widespread use of iron does seem to have played a major role in the spread of Bantu farming communities throughout sub-Saharan Africa. Contact and interaction between hunter/gatherer, pastoralist, and incoming farming communities remains an important topic of interest in African archaeology today.

In 2014, ancient DNA analysis of a 2,330-year-old male forager&#x27;s skeleton in southern Africa found that the specimen belonged to the L0d2c1c mtDNA haplogroup. This maternal clade is today most closely associated with the Ju, a subgroup of the indigenous San people, which points to population continuity in the region. In 2016, a Late Iron Age desiccated mummy from the Tuli region in northern Botswana was also found to belong to haplogroup L0.

In central Nigeria, West Africa, around 1,500 BCE, the Nok culture developed on the Jos Plateau. The Nok people produced lifelike representations in terracotta, including human heads and human figures, elephants, and other animals. By 500 BCE, and possibly a few centuries earlier, they were smelting iron. By 200 AD the Nok culture had vanished. Based on stylistic similarities with the Nok terracottas, the bronze figurines of the Yoruba kingdom of Ife and those of the Bini kingdom of Benin are now believed to be continuations of the traditions of the earlier Nok culture.

Another site in southern Africa that used different types of metal was Bosutswe. The people who lived there used materials such as copper, bronze, and iron. It was proven that this metalworking was the basis for the trade that was responsible for the site&#x27;s success and kept the power in the ruling Lose class.

== Historical Africa ==

Trade with the Near East and Europe led to strong mercantile empires growing such as the Ethiopian kingdom of Axum and Harla Kingdom. Various states and polities also developed in West Africa including Ife, the Kingdom of Benin, Igbo Ukwu, Djenné-Djenno, Ghana Empire, Bono State and the Ashanti Empire. Bantu peoples in southern Africa built the impressive site of Great Zimbabwe between the 10th and 15th centuries CE. The north of the continent had close cultural and economic ties with the Classical and medieval Mediterranean. Cattle herding became important in the Horn of Africa and huge earthwork enclosures were built to corral the animals. The people of Christian Ethiopia produced impressive rock-cut monolithic churches such as that of St George at Lalibela during the 13th century and the first Portuguese forts appeared soon after this, penetrating as far south as Zambia.

<text>is a Japanese physicist and inventor, often cited as the inventor of carbon nanotubes. Although carbon nanotubes had been observed prior to his &quot;invention&quot;, Iijima&#x27;s 1991 paper generated unprecedented interest in the carbon nanostructures and has since fueled intense research in the area of nanotechnology.

Born in Saitama Prefecture in 1939, Iijima graduated with a Bachelor of Engineering degree in 1963 from the University of Electro-Communications, Tokyo. He received a Master&#x27;s degree in 1965 and completed his Ph.D. in solid-state physics in 1968, both at Tohoku University in Sendai.

Between 1970 and 1982 he performed research with crystalline materials and high-resolution electron microscopy at Arizona State University. He visited the University of Cambridge during 1979 to perform studies on carbon materials.

He worked for the Research Development Corporation of Japan from 1982 to 1987, studying ultra-fine particles, after which he joined NEC Corporation where he is still employed. He discovered carbon nanotubes in 1991. When he discovered carbon nanotubes, he not only took pictures of them but he put two together and explained what they really are. Afterwards, he was credited with the discovery. He is also a University Professor at Meijo University since 1999. Furthermore, he is the Honorary AIST Fellow of the National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology, Distinguished Invited University Professor of Nagoya University.

He was awarded the Benjamin Franklin Medal in Physics in 2002, &quot;for the discovery and elucidation of the atomic structure and helical character of multi-wall and single-wall carbon nanotubes, which have had an enormous impact on the rapidly growing condensed matter and materials science field of nanoscale science and electronics.&quot;

He is a foreign associate of National Academy of Sciences, foreign member of the Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters.
He is also a Member of the Japan Academy.

<doc id="710111" wikidata="Q181704" url="?curid=710111" title="Saint-Lô">
<text>Saint-Lô (, ; ) is a commune in northwest France, the capital of the Manche department in the region of Normandy.

Although it is the second largest city of Manche after Cherbourg, it remains the prefecture of the department. It is also chef-lieu of an arrondissement and two cantons (Saint-Lô-1 and Saint-Lô-2). The placename derives from that of a local saint, Laud of Coutances.

The commune has 18,931 inhabitants who are called Saint-Lois(es). The names of Laudois(es), Laudien(ne)s or Laudinien(ne)s are also cited. A martyr city of World War II, Saint-Lô was decorated with the Legion of Honour in 1948 and was given the nickname &quot;Capital of the Ruins&quot;, a phrase popularised by Samuel Beckett.

==Geography==

===Location===

Saint-Lô is in the centre of Manche, in the middle of the Saint-Lois bocage, west of Caen, south of Cherbourg and north of Rennes.

The city was born under the name of &quot;Briovera&quot; on a rocky outcrop of schist belonging to the Armorican Massif, in the Cotentin Peninsula, between the confluences of the Vire – which dominates the city centre – with the Dollée and Torteron, two rivers channelled in their urban sections. This historic heart of the city became &quot;L&#x27;Enclos&quot;, a site well suited to passive defence.

The east of the territory is the former commune of Sainte-Croix-de-Saint-Lô, south of Saint-Thomas-de-Saint-Lô, absorbed in 1964.

===Climate===
Saint-Lô has a mild oceanic climate characterised by mild winters and temperate summers. It has an average annual rainfall of per year. Rainfall is quite frequent throughout the year but most abundant in autumn and winter, in connection with the disturbances coming from the Atlantic Ocean. Rarely intense, they often fall in the form of drizzle. The average temperature is . In winter, the average temperature ranges between . There are between 30 and 40 days of frost per year. In summer, the average temperature lies around .

===Transport===
Saint-Lô is located in the centre of the department of Manche and is therefore a node of communication between Nord-Cotentin and southern Manche.

====Road====
Saint-Lô lies halfway along the Coutances–Bayeux axis (). A bypass road was commissioned in the 1980s to allow the decongestion of the city from the south. To open up the port of Cherbourg, the region and the department decided the construction of a dual carriageway, . It is a part of the European route E03 and enables direct connection to Rennes and Europe from the south, through the interchange at Guilberville. The southern section now connects Saint-Lô directly to the A84 autoroute, allowing motorway access to Caen and Rennes. The commissioning of the northern section, which is currently under construction, will meanwhile allow access to Cherbourg and England via the Route nationale 13. The construction of the dual carriageway allowed the extension of the small South ring road heading west and its mutation into genuine urban bypass. It has also enabled the creation and expansion of new business zones which contribute strongly to the current growth of the agglomeration.

====Rail====
The Gare de Saint-Lô is served by TER trains on the . It is in the majority of services for travellers in the direction of Caen via Lison or in the direction of Coutances. A few trains, two daily return trips, serve as far as Rennes via Avranches.

Following the electrification of the section of railway between Lison and Saint-Lô during 2006, the SNCF and local communities experienced a direct Intercités service (without change of train) to the Gare Saint-Lazare in Paris for two years, between December 2008 and December 2010. This service was not sustained due to a lack of sufficient number of passengers. There is also the disused former industrial line to Condé-sur-Vire. The section between Gourfaleur and Condé-sur-Vire, adjacent to the towpath along the Vire, is used by the &quot;Vélorail&quot; [rail cycle] of the Vire valley since 2007.

====Urban transport network====
Urban transportation is provided by the &quot;Transports Urbains Saint-Lô Agglomération&quot;: TUSA (formerly &quot;Transport Urbains Saint-Lô Agneaux&quot;), was created in 1980. In 2010, the network consisted of four lines (Odyssée, Azur, Horizon and Alizé) with 15 buses and one Ocitolà transport on demand minibus. However, since 3 January 2011, it is composed of three lines (1, 2 and 3) still with 15 buses and one Ocitolà transport on demand minibus. In 2008, the company recorded more than 850,000 journeys.

On 15 May 2013, seven new vehicles were integrated with the fleet, namely five Cytios 4/44, and two Mercedes-Benz Citaro K BHNS. The total fleet is composed of a Renault Master B.20 (for the Ocitolà transport on demand), 5 Vehixel Cytios 4/44, 2 Mercedes-Benz Citaro K BHNS, two , five , and a .

A new vehicle wrapping campaign is underway, the yellow livery will disappear in favour of a red livery. Added to this, a campaign of improving vehicle facilities, to meet the new standards of accessibility of public transit, including on-board announcements and scrolling banners. The old Renault PR 100.2 (nos. 97205, 97207 to 97210) and (nos. 97211 and 97212) were scrapped.

====Intercity transport network====
The commune is associated with the departmental public buses () by the lines:
* 001 : Cherbourg-Octeville – Valognes – Carentan – Saint-Lô
* 002 : Coutances – Marigny – Saint-Lô
* 109 : Saint-Lô – Periers
* 113 : Villedieu-les-Poêles – Saint-Lô
* 117 : Guilberville – Torigni – Saint-Lô
* 303 : Saint-Hilaire-du-Harcouët – Vire – Saint-Lô – Lison
* 304 : Brécey – Villedieu-les-Poêles – Saint-Lô – Lison

====Air and river transport====
Despite its status of prefecture, there is no airfield in the vicinity of the town. The nearest is that of Lessay, and for an airport, to join that of Caen-Carpiquet, Cherbourg-Maupertus or Rennes – Saint-Jacques.

Inland waterway transport on the Vire once existed with scows ensuring the transport of . It is no longer possible, due to lack of maintenance of the various equipment and the Vire.

==History==
Saint-Lô has long been an important centre of the economy of Normandy. It has attracted the covetousness of neighboring nations, including England, resulting in many successive invasions. It lost its dominant position towards the end of the 19th century because it failed to take advantage of the first Industrial Revolution, which instead affected much of the predominantly peasant population. However, the decentralisation policy allowed the city to return to the foreground.

===Briovère===
Originally called Briovera (meaning &quot;Bridge on the Vire River&quot; in Gaulish) (often written in French as Briovère), the town is built on and around ramparts. The town started life as a Gallic fortified settlement, occupied by the tribe of the Unelli of Cotentin. Briovere was conquered by the Romans led by Quintus Titurius Sabinus in 56 BC, after the defeat of their leader Viridovix at . Roman peace led the development of Gallo-Roman rural areas, on the model of the Roman &quot;villae rusticae&quot; as in Canisy, Marigny and Tessy-sur-Vire, whose names are based on the suffix &quot;-i&quot;, of location of Celtic origin &quot;*-i-āko-&quot;, and often composed with a Latin personal name, carried by a Gallo-Roman native. Then, the region was the scene of various Saxon invasions during the 3rd century. The Franks did not establish an administrative power there, although Briovera was nevertheless entitled to hammer coinage. Historian Claude Fauchet said, &quot;the Coutentin, at the same time as our Merovingian kings, was inhabited by the Sesnes (Saxons), pirates, and seems to have been abandoned by Carolingians, as variable and too remote for correction by our kings, to the Normans and other plunderers of sea...&quot;

Sainte-Croix Church was built in 300, said to be on the ruins of a temple of Ceres. Christianity grew quite late. There were only four before 511. Laud of Coutances, bishop in 525–565, had a residence here. After his death he was beatified and was particularly honoured by Briovera, which would have housed his tomb. A pilgrimage was conducted and the city took the name of &quot;Saint-Laud&quot;, and then the name &quot;Saint-Lô&quot; which has been known since the 8th century.

===Middle Ages===
The Bretons, led by King Salomon, began to occupy the west coast of the Cotentin Peninsula from 836. Before their advances, in August 867, Charles the Bald gave Salomon the Comitatus Constantiensis, territory over which he had little influence. In 889, the Vikings travelled up the Vire and besieged Saint-Lô. Protected by solid ramparts built, according to tradition, in the early 9th century by Charlemagne, the town did not initially surrender. The attackers then cut the water supply, resulting in the surrender of the inhabitants. The Vikings massacred the inhabitants, including the Bishop of Coutances, and then razed the town. The seat of the diocese moved to Rouen. It was only in 1025 that Bishop Herbert decided to return to the walls of Saint-Lô and restore the episcopal see. Then, under Geoffrey de Montbray, the town experienced a great economic development, taking advantage of the Norman expedition in Sicily. Robert Guiscard, a close associate of Geoffrey, brought important loot to Apulia and Calabria, and it was thanks to this treasure that Geoffrey was able to rebuild Coutances Cathedral in 1056. Saint-Lô is famous for its goldsmiths and even Matilda of Flanders, the wife of William the Conqueror, ordered two candelabra for the .

The population of the region participated in the conquest of England. Henry I, Count of Cotentin and eventually King of England strengthened Saint-Lô in 1090. In 1091, Geoffrey de Montbray, Bishop of Coutances, had a lock and mills built on the River Vire. With the death of Henry I in 1135, Stephen of Blois, Count of Mortain and Geoffrey of Anjou disputed the legitimacy of the realm. Saint-Lô sided with Stephen but was taken in 1139 by the Plantagenet army in just three days. The Archbishop of Canterbury, Thomas Becket, passed through Saint-Lô and a church, of which there remains no trace except the name of the &quot;Rue Saint-Thomas&quot;, was dedicated to him. In 1204, Saint-Lô submitted to Philip Augustus and became French. During this period of peace, the town prospered: It had the Hôtel-Dieu built on the edges of the town along with part of the Notre-Dame church and in 1234 a guild of tailors was established. Saint Louis came to the city twice, in 1256 and 1269. Saint-Lô was then the third largest town in the Duchy of Normandy after Rouen and Caen. In 1275 it received the right to mint coins from King Philip III of France, which it maintained until 1693. It specialised in tanneries with the designation &quot; la vache de Saint-Lô&quot; [the cowhide of Saint-Lô]. After , its own trade of laces and leather aiguillettes amounted to one million in 1555; in knife making: A 16th century saying &quot;Qui voudroit avoir bon couteau, Il faudroit aller à Saint-Lô&quot; [Who would wish to have good knife, it would be necessary to go to Saint-Lô]; in goldsmithing; and in textiles, one of the main centres of France. There were more than 2,000 weavers, located mostly near the Dollée, a less powerful river than the Vire but with a smoother flow. Wool was imported from across the Cotentin peninsula. An order of 20 June 1460 fixed a special edge to the sheets of Saint-Lô.

The English landed at Saint-Vaast-la-Hougue on 12 July 1346 and then moved upon Saint-Lô on 22 July. Jean Froissart describes &quot;the big town of Saint-Leu in Constentin... for the hard times, was rich and mercantile.&quot; The town was sacked.

===16th to 20th centuries===

The period of peace had returned but the Cotentin lost its importance. Francis I was acclaimed at the door of the Neufbourg in 1532. In the 16th century, Protestantism won the round. Saint-Lô had a reformed church from 1555 and early printed books would be Protestant works. Saint-Lô suffered notably during the Wars of Religion. The Huguenots, holding Saint-Lô and Carentan, ransacked Coutances in 1562 and seized the Bishop Artus de Cossé-Brissac, who was dragged in the town of Saint-Lô on a donkey. Although, while the Edict of Pacification of Amboise had prompted the city to submit to Charles IX in February 1574, Norman Protestants made their headquarters in Saint-Lô. Troops led by the besieged the city on 1 May, assaulted it 10 days later and captured it on 10 June. There were more than 500 deaths among those whose leader was Colombières, Lord of Bricqueville, but the Protestant Grand Captain Gabriel I of Montgomery escaped through the door of the Dollée. The town was ceded to who built the citadel. Two years later the seigneury of the bishops of Coutances over the town ceased forever.

As a result of the war, in 1580, Saint-Lô lost the headquarters of the présidial, transferred to Coutances, capital of the bailiwick. In the mid-17th century part of the walls were destroyed, and the town grew with a new borough known as &quot;Neufborg&quot;. After the revocation of the Edict of Nantes (1685), most craftsmen abandoned Saint-Lô. The Revolt of the va-nu-pieds shook the area slightly in 1636, when the Government wanted to extend the gabelle in Cotentin. The region flourished especially in the manufacture of so-called &quot;d&#x27;estame&quot; wool socks. In 1678, the relics of Saint Laud were brought back to Notre-Dame. The route between Paris and Cherbourg, built to 1761, passes to Saint-Lô, facilitating trade. The French Revolution of 1789 overthrew the administrative division of the France and the capital of the department was temporarily set at Coutances between 1794 and 1796. Saint-Lô took the &quot;Rocher de la Liberté&quot; [Rock of Freedom] and a tree was planted on the &quot;Champ de Mars&quot;. The city was relatively untouched during the Reign of Terror although there were some clashes with the Chouans.

The Napoleonic period saw the creation of the national stud. In 1827, Marie Thérèse of France, Duchess of Angoulême, passed through Saint-Lô and she was struck by the beauty of the landscape. She then planned to bring the sea to Saint-Lô making the River Vire navigable. The creation of the in 1833 allowed the establishment of the connection between Carentan and Saint-Lô. Then, by order of 10 July 1835, the Vire was classified as navigable. Baron Alfred Mosselman built a port at Saint-Lô in recruiting nearly 250 military detainees and Spanish prisoners. A boatyard was created and traffic flowed at 50 tons in 1841 to more than 132 in 1846. then launched barges and introduced horse traction by arranging the towpaths of the waterway. Several goods were transported but mainly the and the lime from the quarries of Pont-Hébert and Cavigny. It thus passed from 1,233 tonnes of lime production in 1841 to 30,000 in 1858. In 1867, the paper mill of Valvire was built near the spillway and manufactured packing paper. It was destroyed by fire in 1930 and little remains beyond the chimney of the plant.

Saint-Lô ruled out the Mantes-la-Jolie–Cherbourg railway because its inhabitants, having fear of industrial progress, refused a path linking them to Paris. It would be attached to the rail network in 1860. In the 19th century, Saint-Lô, in the heart of a rich farming area, established itself as an important place for trade in animals, but the fear of the rural population towards the industrial revolution was blocking its development. River traffic transit saw 53,000 tonnes of goods, only 6% of which were foodstuffs. A leak was discovered in the canal and the River Vire was decommissioned in 1926. The region experienced a significant rural exodus and suffered casualties of the war of 1870 and the First World War. The Valvire paper mill burned down in the 1930s and would never be rebuilt. The demographics of the department was very negative from 1850. The city entered World War II in a declining situation.

In 1914 and 1915, Saint-Lô welcomed the temporary hospital No. 2 of the 10th Army Corps.

The criminal case of Jean Philippe took place in Saint-Lô, and was then judged by the Court of Assizes of Manche, at Coutances on 9 December 1940.

===World War II===

France was invaded in 1940 and the 7th Panzer Division, commanded by Erwin Rommel, entered Normandy. The objective being the capture of the city of Cherbourg, the centre of Manche was bypassed as the German Army occupied Saint-Lô, a strategic crossroads, on the night of 17 June 1940. During the occupation, the statue of the Norman dairywoman and the Havin statue, both made by were sold and melted to make cannons, despite opposition from local politicians. In March 1943, the Germans decided to dig a tunnel under the rock. For the time being, no one is able to say what the usefulness of this tunnel would have been, though it was dug at the same time as the Agneaux Institute. Workers from the STO would be required until the beginning of the Battle of Normandy. Then, the underground, under construction, would house the sick of the Hôtel-Dieu located opposite and a part of the Saint-Lô population.

A German soldier was shot in January 1944 and several local people were arrested. The cinema, theatre and bars were closed, radios confiscated and the curfew was extended to 8pm.


During the Liberation, Saint-Lô suffered two series of air attacks during the Battle of Normandy. The first was the bombardment of the city by the Americans during the night of D-Day 6–7 June 1944. The first American air strike killed almost eight hundred civilians. Allied planes continued to attack the power plant and rail facilities daily for a week.

A second series of air attacks began on 17 July, during the Battle of Saint-Lô, which would give its name to the USS &quot;St. Lo&quot;. This time the city was bombed by the Germans. As a main transport center, the city was a nexus of military activity starting the Battle of Normandy and on to the breakout from Normandy, Operation Cobra. As a result of air and ground attacks, Saint-Lô was almost totally destroyed (90–95% according to common estimates). The city was dubbed &quot;The Capital of the Ruins&quot; by Samuel Beckett. Saint-Lô was one of the key cities to the opening of the Falaise Gap, which ultimately allowed Allied forces to expel the Germans from northern France.

By order of Major General Charles Gerhardt, a jeep carried the body of Major Thomas Howie, later immortalized as &quot;The Major of St. Lô&quot;, wrapped in a flag on its hood so that it could be said that he was the first American to enter the city.

Saint-Lô received the and the Croix de Guerre 1939–1945 on 2 June 1948 with a citation for &quot;capital of the Manche Department which has retained full confidence in the destiny of the country. Suffered on the night of 6–7 June, with a heroic calm, an air bombardment to such a point that its inhabitants could consider themselves as citizens of the capital of the ruins&quot;. These awards would be given on 6 June by President Vincent Auriol. The two communes, now absorbed from Sainte-Croix-de-Saint-Lô and Saint-Thomas-de-Saint-Lô, were also decorated with the Croix de Guerre 1939–1945 on 11 November 1948.

===Postwar period===

After the war the question arose as to whether the town should be rebuilt or left with its ruins intact as a testimony to the bombing. One American soldier laconically commented: &quot;We sure liberated the hell out of this place&quot;.

Almost totally destroyed (97%), Saint-Lô had the unenviable nickname of &quot;Capital of Ruins&quot;, an expression attributed to Archbishop Bernard Jacqueline. It was the reason which compelled the prefect of the ruins to settle in Coutances. This &quot;Capital of Ruins&quot; was revived by Samuel Beckett in his text &quot;The Capital of Ruins&quot; of 10 June 1946, which he wrote for Raidió Éireann, proving how much it remained marked by what he had seen and done in Saint-Lô. The Notre-Dame church located on the ramparts still bears the scars of bombing and bloody clashes which took place. The population timidly returned to the city. There were 180 people on 12 August 1944, but U.S. authorities decided not to issue authorisation of residence and supplied tickets. A lengthy clean-up began, including the corpses of residents and soldiers, which lasted until 15 October 1944. However, officials hesitated to rebuild Saint-Lô. Indeed, some were willing to leave the ruins as a testament to the martyrdom of the city and later rebuild a new Saint-Lô. The population declined, preferring to reinhabit its city.

In April 1945, the Minister Raoul Dautry advocated a provisional wooden barracks building. These huts are built through the generosity of the donations. Thus, the association of the unblocked an appropriation of 620,000 Swiss francs to build homes and a community centre. On 10 October 1949, Switzerland offered a gold ingot to the city which yielded 649,490 francs. There were ten housing estates in 1948, some which contained over 70 houses. The barracks were delivered in kit form, and it was enough to build them on the spot. Each had different specifics according to their place of origin (Swedish, Finnish, Swiss, French, American, Canadian). The Irish Red Cross participated in the construction of a 100-bed hospital consisting of 25 buildings (located level with the Pasteur college) and landed 174 tons of equipment starting in August 1945. The hospital was inaugurated on Sunday, 7 April 1946 and the Irish medical team left Saint-Lô at the beginning of January 1947. This hospital, consisting of wooden shacks, operated until 1956.

By 1948, a more permanent Saint-Lô had to be rebuilt. This would be done on the basis of plans designed by the Chief Architect of the reconstruction André Hilt (died 1946), which had proposed to retain the general fabric of the town by adapting it to modern needs. President Vincent Auriol laid the first stone just four years after landing.

As partial reparation for the destruction of the city, the Americans, behind the bombing, decided to build a modern hospital. The plans were made by the architect Paul Nelson, who decided to build a contemporary-style building. It is located on the &quot;Route de Villedieu&quot;. Work began in 1949, and it was completed on 10 May 1956. A monumental mosaic was made by Fernand Léger, which pays tribute to peace and Franco-American friendship: Both hands towards the Cotentin Peninsula symbolised with an apple tree branch in bloom. It was at that time the largest hospital in Europe. On 29 November 1949, the journalist Frédéric Pottecher submitted a hypothesis to not move the prefecture of Manche from Saint-Lô. Although, during the reconstruction, it was temporarily placed in Coutances. The whole of the population reacted and a petition collected more than 2,400 signatures.

The prefecture returned to Saint-Lô in 1953, into new premises.

Saint-Lô was rebuilt. The dominant style was a neo-regionalist functionalism which was dominated by concrete. Its dated and monotonous character was soon criticised. If this choice, dictated by the circumstances and the immediate problems of the housing of Saint-Lô, leaves regrets today, it makes Saint-Lô, on a smaller scale than Le Havre or Lorient, one of the most striking testimonies of the reconstruction period. A few streets contain vestiges of the old Saint-Lô: some houses on the &quot;Rue du Neufbourg&quot;, &quot;Rue Croix-Canuet&quot; and &quot;Falourdel&quot;, &quot;Rue Saint-Georges&quot; and &quot;Porte au Four&quot;. This last street houses the last medieval way of Saint-Lô. In 1964, Saint-Lô absorbed two neighbouring communes, Sainte-Croix-de-Saint-Lô (660 inhabitants in 1962, to the east of the territory) and Saint-Thomas-de-Saint-Lô (306 inhabitants to the south). The town benefitted from the economic growth of the Trente Glorieuses and the population grew by 30% between 1968 and 1975. It built neighbourhoods of buildings in the Valley of the Dollée and Val Saint-Jean. The theatre, meanwhile, was inaugurated in 1963.

The square of the town hall was completely redeveloped in the 1990s. The city organised a large demonstration on the occasion of the fiftieth anniversary of the Normandy landings. The edges of the Vire were reconfigured with the rehabilitation of the towpath and the creation of a green beach, at the &quot;Place du Quai-à-Tangue&quot;. A scow was rebuilt and crossed the river, in order to remember former river traffic. In 2004, the rural area of Bois-Jugan was urbanised, with the creation of housing within a framework of preservation of green spaces and a large aquatic centre. Later, the Des Ronchettes water tower was built following an unusual method for the time, since the tank (strongly resembling a flying saucer) was built at the ground level, then raised by a system of jacks, as the rings composing its body were manufactured. As such, its elevation allows a mounting point for telecommunication (mobile phone, WiMAX, and FM radio) networks.

In 2017, the distribution of the population of the commune by age group was as follows:

==Heraldry==


==Economy==
The city, at a crossroads between Caen, Cherbourg and Rennes, has a natural vocation of marketplace in the centre of the Manche bocage. A city of craftsmen and trade, which owes part of its prosperity to its status of prefecture, it has experienced a late industrialisation and attempts to assert its place, today, in the regional agri-food industry. Despite this, the Saint-Lô country became one of the less industrial areas of the region. Its unemployment rate of 6.7% also hides an exodus of young workers to the area of Caen and Rennes. The entry into service of the helped open up the centre of Manche and create a new industrial zone (ZAC Neptune).

In 2008, Saint-Lô was equipped with fibre optic cable to allow companies and individuals to have very high speed internet (approximately 1 Gbps and 100 Mbit/s for individuals). Companies should have had access to this speed by September 2008, with individuals not before September 2009. Saint-Lô will be one of the first cities in France of this size to be equipped with a fibre optic internet network.

===Tax rate===
===Industries===

*Lecapitaine: Manufacturer of automotive bodywork and refrigeration, a subsidiary of Petit Forestier (320 employees – €33M turnover).
*Moulinex: The Moulinex factory has long been the largest plant in Saint-Lô. When the group went bankrupt in 2004, the factory was a subsidiary of SEB, and general company for electric motors was revived as Euromoteurs, with SEB as the only customer. Part of the production lines were dismantled, sold to China and resettled there by the Green de Gourfaleur company. The Saint-Lô site had 150 employees and manufactured small and medium power electric motors. Suffering from only having the single client SEB, Euromoteurs was put into liquidation in 2007.
*Alios, production plant which manufactures smart cards and &quot;CEV&quot;, a company that manages electronic transactions, grouped in the same building (80 employees) and subsidiaries of the Group Chèque Déjeuner. It is one of the key players in the Secure Electronic Transactions .
*MT Verbom, company specialising in press tools. Created in 1985 on the &quot;Promenade des ports&quot;, the Martignoni-Traisnel company specialises in the production of auto parts, and moved in 1990 into the Chevallerie zone. In 1998 the company became closer with Canadian group Verbom and employed 65 people on the site in 2008.

===Tertiary sector===
The town of Saint-Lô is very oriented towards services, thus since the fall of Moulinex, the France-United States Memorial Hospital became the first employer in the city. There are many jobs in administration related to its status of prefecture. Its location in the heart of the bocage allows it to sustain services connected historically with agriculture: It may be noted the presence of one of the seats of the , whose closure was announced in June 2010, but also the insurer Groupama, clearly visible from the Major Howie roundabout, and . Finally, many businesses have developed along the ring road.

===Agriculture and agro-food hub===
The city hosts activities associated with the rearing of cattle and horses. Each week, a calf market took place in the market installed until 30 December 2008 near Les Ronchettes. From January 2009, it was removed and attached to the calf market at Torigni-sur-Vire. The city also has the Livestock Promotion Centre, located next to the stud farm, which hosts the equestrian competition of the Normandy horse show, each year in August. The agri-food cluster has developed since 1990 with the aim of hosting companies in this sector, several public or parapublic bodies are installed:

*Adria normandie: technical advice centre for agro-processing.
*The agri-food nursery.
*Lilano: &quot;Laboratoire interprofessionnel laitier de Normandie&quot; [Inter-professional dairy laboratory of Normandy].
*The Centre of agri-food formation of Saint-Lô, an extension of the Thère Farming School located at Le Hommet-d&#x27;Arthenay.
*Ardefa: &quot;Association régionale pour le développement de l&#x27;emploi et des formations dans les industries alimentaires&quot; [Regional Association for the development of employment and training in the food industries.]
*Workshop of agri-food rotation.
*The agri-food park of Saint-Georges-Montcocq / Le Mesnil-Rouxelin on which the master dairies are established; through lack of implementation, much remains undeveloped.

In 2008, the only success in the agri-food field was the success of the France Kebab enterprise, which had won many prizes in 2007.

==Sites and monuments==

===Religious heritage===

====Church of Notre-Dame====
The is a monument of Flamboyant Gothic style erected on four centuries from the end of the 13th century to replace the former castle&#x27;s chapel. It is located in the &quot;Enclos&quot; surrounded by ramparts and was listed on the register of historic monuments in 1840. The outdoor pulpit was noted and drawn by Victor Hugo, which he called &#x27;unique&#x27; in a letter to Adèle Foucher. He protected it from demolition, which was planned prior to town renovation in 1863.

The building suffered heavy destruction during World War II, although it was among the only standing buildings after the 1944 bombings. If the stained-glass windows were saved, after being always present since temporary removal during the war, the nave was gutted following the collapse of the North Tower which was shelled by German artillery. Its roof and façade were destroyed, as well as the top of the other tower. Instead of rebuilding the church identically, the architect of Historic Monuments decided to build a greenschist frontage to highlight the scar left by the war. The statue of &quot;Notre-Dame du Pilier&quot; is from 1467; having been destroyed and remade several times, it is now housed on a column in the apse chapel.

====Church of Sainte-Croix====

The is, according to the tradition, the heir of a chapel built here by St. Helena in the 4th century and of an abbey founded by Charlemagne. Better documented is the creation of an Augustinian abbey by Algar, the new bishop of Coutances (formerly the prior of Bodmin Priory, Cornwall) in 1132. The Romanesque church was consecrated in 1202, being largely remade in the following centuries with successive renovations. The choir was remade in the 16th century while the bell tower is from 1860 to 1863. During World War II, the bell tower (located laterally) collapsed and it was on its ruins where the body of Major Howie was placed; a new bell tower was rebuilt in 1957 on the forecourt in a modern style. On the church square stands the departmental monument in memory of the victims of the wars of Algeria and Indochina, opened in 2005.

====Cemetery of Saint-Lô====
The cemetery of Saint-Lô is located between the Saint-Croix Church and the national stud, on the &quot;Route de Lison&quot;. The cemetery is much marked by the Second World War with the plot of the civilian victims of the bombing of 1944, also the mausoleum of the Blanchet family, and Major Glover S. Johns Junior who installed the first command post before releasing the city. One can still find the tomb of the Dagobert. Also note the weeping statue which has traces of shrapnel, a bronze sculpture of Cabet, who was a student of F. Rude.

====Other buildings====
The parish of Saint-Lô has other Catholic buildings:

*Church of Saint Jean-Eudes located in Val Saint-Jean
*The chapel of the Memorial Hospital
*The chapel of the Saint Jean clinic
*The chapel of the Bon-Sauveur psychiatric hospital
*The John XXIII Chapel in the Dollée quarter

The city also has a temple of the Protestant Reformed Church of France. It was built by architect Verrey with the glazing of Max Ingrand and was inaugurated on 23 October 1955.

===Historical civil heritage===
Several sites are registered as historic monuments:

*The Madeleine Chapel.
*The Château de la Vaucelle, registered on 11 July 1975.
*Notre-Dame church, recorded in 1840, contains ten objects registered in respect of objects classified as historical monuments.
*The Sainte-Croix church.
*The National Stud and its park, registered on 18 February 1993.
*The wards and the lobby of the .
*The Manor of Bosdel, constructed between the 16th and 18th centuries, registered as an historic monument on 1 April 1946.
*The remains of the walls recorded on 12 December 1945 but the &quot;Rue de la poterne&quot; and the &quot;Place des Beaux-Regards&quot; had been registered as early as 22 October 1937.

The Maison-Dieu [House of God] (not to be confused with the Hôtel-Dieu) located opposite the church and built in the second half of the 15th century was razed during the bombings of 1944. This bourgeois construction presented a half-timbered façade with corbels and sculptures. Another House, called &quot;Poids Royal&quot;, located in the quad at 11 &quot;Rue Thiers&quot; in the &quot;Enclos&quot; had been included in historical monuments on 3 October 1929, it was also destroyed.

====Ramparts====
Saint-Lô also has remains of its medieval line of walls. Ramparts still exist on three of the four sides of the &quot;Enclos&quot;. The remains include: &quot;Tour des Beaux-Regards&quot; (&quot;Tower of Beautiful Glances&quot;), commanding the steepest part of the spur of the town, and the &quot;Tour de la Poudrière&quot; (&quot;Tower of the Gunpowder Store&quot;), an impressive military relic of the old citadel, are the two most notable elements of the ramparts. On the south side, the wartime disaster of 1944 had the paradoxical effect of clearing the base, where houses had grown around the &quot;Rue du Torteron&quot;.

====National Stud====


Saint-Lô is home to the largest of the 23 national stud farms in France. In 1806, Napoleon provided Saint-Lô with a deposit of stallions by the . From its origin, the deposit was installed on buildings and abandoned land of the old Abbey of Sainte-Croix ( first leased and then owned from 22 September 1807). The stud then recruited from the breeding of the Haras du Pin.

In 1826, the military remount depot moved premises which the stud had given to it; most stallions were taken from the stud to provide cavalry. On 28 May 1874, the Boscher Law enabled supervision of the allocations of the regiments and allowed to provide the stud with over 230 horses. On 28 June 1881, the municipal council decided to transfer the stud to adjoin the &quot;Route de Bayeux&quot;. Thus, the current stud farm buildings date from 1884 (the first stone was laid on 11 June 1884), and the transfer was finished three years later. During World War I, five mares out of six were requisitioned, but no stallions. Grooms fought at the front, and German prisoners dug a pond. In 1939, the old stable housed the staff of the Haras de Strasbourg (40 stallions and staff) at the time of the German breakthrough. Then, in 1944, fifty horses were killed by the bombing and other stallions were stolen by German soldiers in flight. The old stud was destroyed and claimed by the city. Thus, there only remains the street of the same name and the Normandy building which was previously the former riding school. The new stud was then built. General de Gaulle offered to the Sultan of Morocco &quot;Bois de Rose&quot;, a thoroughbred which had been stationed at the stud for two years. The stud then grew gradually in the field of reproduction, by investing in an artificial insemination centre, a centre for the freezing of semen and an embryo transfer unit. Thus, the electoral district of Saint-Lô has the highest density of breeding deposits of France.

====Château de la Vaucelle====
Located on the bank of the Vire, the belongs to the Saint-Lois descendants of the 17th century diarist Luc Duchemin. The Sainte-Pernelle Chapel is the work of a Lord of the Vaucelle Jean Boucart, confessor of Louis XI and founder of the parish library of Saint-Lô, which was at the time the second library of Normandy by importance. Three kings resided at the Vaucelle: Edward III in 1346, at the beginning of the Hundred Years&#x27; War the king found that it was not a safe city, Francis I during his visit in 1532 and Charles IX. The dovecote and the northern wall niche are listed as protected elements.

===Museums===

====Museum of Fine Arts====


Built by the architect Eugène Leseney, the Jean-Lurçat Cultural Centre is situated on the &quot;Place du Champ-de-Mars&quot;, opposite the Sainte-Croix Church. It houses the Museum of Fine Arts where, within the collections of the city since 1989, are found: The writings and sketches of Jean Follain, paintings by Corot, Guillaume Fouace, Eugène Boudin. Is also exposed the tapestries of the (16th century), composed of eight tapestries from the Bruges workshops including a draft with the theme of the &quot;Lai d&#x27;Aristote&quot;.

====Museum of the Norman Bocage====
Boisjugan farm is a farmhouse from the 17th century which was in use until 1970. Converted into a museum, it traces the history and ethnography of agriculture in the Norman bocage since the 18th century with agricultural practices, horse and cattle breeding. Typical sites are reconstructed (workshop, stable, barn and creamery).

====Chapel of Madeleine====
The is located right next to the national stud, on the road to Bayeux. It is a relic of a former leprosarium from the 14th century. It was classified as an historical monument on 3 August 1974 and was restored between 1988 and 1994. A memorial was inaugurated in May 1995 in honour of the soldiers of the 29th and 35th divisions who liberated Saint-Lô in 1944. Photos, commemorative plaques, tables and flags are on display.

===Other notable places===
A memorial in the city honours Major Thomas Howie, Commander of the 3d Battalion, 116th Infantry Regiment of the U.S. Army&#x27;s 29th Division; the unit that liberated the city on 18 July 1944. Howie was killed just before his unit entered the city and was so highly respected that his men placed his flag-draped body on the hood of a jeep at the front of the column so he could be the first American to enter the city. He became famous as the &quot;Major of Saint-Lô&quot;.

===Place de la Mairie===
Redesigned in 1990, the city square is all black asphalt lit by spotlights on the ground. At night it has a resemblance to an airport runway. The statue of the dairywoman or &quot;Femme d&#x27;Isigny&quot; [Woman of Isigny] can be seen at the top of the square. (1848–1918) introduced a plaster statue in 1887, a Norman woman marked by the hard work of the Earth, a milk rod (a typical Normandy container) on her shoulder. A few years later, the bronze arrived in Saint-Lô. It is set on a round plinth, surrounded by a basin, on the &quot;Place des Beaux-Regards&quot; in front of the Notre-Dame church. She moved a little further when the Poilu of the Great War was installed. It was then unbolted and melted on 8 February 1942, by the Germans, to recover the bronze for the arms industry. In January 1984, André Leplanquais, a merchant of Saint-Lô, wanted to create a replica of this statue. A fundraiser gained significant donations from residents. Once the money was together, the sculptor , the famous sculptor of Ernée, fashioned a new statue based on the original plans. Moved several times, one can find it near stairs of the square. The base and the granite basin are the original.

The Havin fountain also created by Arthur Le Duc in 1887 was located near the Museum of Saint-Lô; its statue was also melted by the Germans, however no replica has been created. Nearby is the prison entrance, a remnant of the bombing in 1944. An urn containing the ashes of deportees is placed at the foot of it. A memorial in honour of the victims of Nazi repression, it became the departmental monument to the Resistance. The belfry can also be observed from the square, which seems to spring from the heart of the city. Built in 1954, it was once used to dry the hoses of firefighters. Renovated several times since 1990, it is the symbol of the reconstruction of the city. At the top are a weathervane in the shape of Unicorn and a viewpoint, from which one can admire the entire region. Previously open to the public by the tourist office, its access is now forbidden.

===The Caisse d&#x27;Épargne squirrel===
A granite statue representing a squirrel can be seen in Saint-Lô, which is the logo of the Caisse d&#x27;Épargne banking group; It is located in the &quot;Rue Saint-Thomas&quot;. What may seem incongruous, it is that there&#x27;s no bank of this group nearby. However, the bank did have a branch in front, but it was moved in the 1990s. Then arose the question of whether or not to keep the statue for advertising purposes. The people of Saint-Lô had become attached to the squirrel, and it was finally decided to leave it in place.

<text>Fakenham is a market town and civil parish in Norfolk, England. It is situated on the River Wensum, about north-west of Norwich. The town is at the junction of several local roads, including the A148 from King&#x27;s Lynn to Cromer, the A1067 to Norwich and the A1065 to Swaffham.

The civil parish has an area of . In the 2001 census, it had a population of 7,357 in 3,292 households; this increased to 7,617 at the 2011 census. For the purposes of local government, the parish lies within the district of North Norfolk.

Fakenham has been a market town since 1250, known particularly for its corn, barley and wheat trading; in the 19th century, it became noted for its printing. Fakenham Racecourse is a thoroughbred horse racing venue to the south of the town.

The town has a long name of Fakenham Lancaster which derives from the ownership of the manor in 1377 being transferred to John of Gaunt, the Duke of Lancaster. The name continues to be used today, including on recently-placed history trail plaques around the town; it is also used to name the town&#x27;s two wards, for the purpose of electing councillors to North Norfolk District Council: Lancaster North and Lancaster South.

==History==
The name &quot;Fakenham&quot; is Saxon and has been interpreted as meaning &quot;homestead of Facca&quot;, or &quot;Fair Place&quot;/&quot;Place on a Fair River&quot;. Numerous arrowheads and flint tools found in the parish indicate occupation during Neolithic times. Two copper alloy socketed axeheads have been unearthed in Fakenham dated to the Bronze Age. In 2015, a lead plaque was found near Fakenham dating to the Early Medieval period, and has been interpreted as having been used to overcome an illness-causing dwarf based on its runic inscription.

Before 1066 the manor of Fakenham was held by King Harold, before being taken by King William the Conqueror. The manor was relatively large, containing surrounding villages such as Pudding Norton and Thorpland. A number of Early to Late Saxon brooches, buckles, and pottery have been unearthed in the area. A Middle Saxon coin found in the parish is of the East Anglian king Beonna. A watermill was mentioned in Fakenham in the Domesday Book of 1086, but it was later demolished.

In November 1297, Guy Ferre was recorded as the owner of Fakenham Manor, which King Edward I had given to him for life. During the 13th century, the hamlet of Thorpland had 90 parishioners, but by the 16th century it had largely been depopulated, and today all that remains is the hall.

Fires broke out in the town in 1660, 1718 and 1738, which destroyed or partly destroyed a number of buildings. The 4 August 1738 fire destroyed 26 buildings in Fakenham.

==Geography==
Fakenham is situated in the North Norfolk district, between Pudding Norton and Barsham, on the north bank of the River Wensum. It is sited about north-east of King&#x27;s Lynn, south-west of Cromer and north-west of Norwich. 

To the south-east of Fakenham is Pensthorpe Natural Park, which contains over 700 acres of woodland and lakes, and four gardens.

==Economy==
Fakenham has been a market town since 1250. Agricultural products and cattle have long been sold at the town&#x27;s corn and flea markets. John Chambers wrote in his &quot;A General History of the County of Norfolk&quot; (1829): &quot;Fakenham is a small town, with a good corn market, attended by buyers from Wells, and other contiguous ports. The general market here is on Thursdays, when a large quantity of barley and wheat are sold by samples&quot;.

During the 19th century, Fakenham became a major centre for printing, which continued into the 20th century. Fakenham Prepress Solutions is a contemporary printing and illustrating company based in Fakenham. The Kinnerton Confectionery Company was established in the town in 1978.

==Landmarks==

Fakenham contains the 14th-century Saint Peter and Saint Paul Parish Church, which replaced an earlier Saxon church. The tower was built in the 15th century. Baron&#x27;s Hall was originally built in 1593, but was demolished in 1812 and a new hall opened in 1825. The Corn Exchange opened in 1855, replacing an earlier sessions house. The corn exchange served as the local headquarters for the Home Guard during World War II.

The Star Inn on Oak Street was built in the 17th century. Grove House, The Red Lion, The Wooden Horse and Barclays Bank retain some 17th-century features. The town also contains the Fakenham Museum of Gas and Local History, which displays equipment used for making gas from coal.

==Sport==
Fakenham Cricket Club is one of the oldest in Norfolk; it started in 1815 with a combined team, including Hempton and Walsingham, and formed in its own right in 1883. The 1st team of the club won the Norfolk Alliance Premier Division league title in 2001, 2011, 2015 and 2018; also the Carter Cup in 2010. Queens Road Recreation Ground is a recreational ground in the centre of Fakenham. 

Fakenham Golf Club, on the southern outskirts of the town on the southern side of the Wensum, was originally established in February 1889. The present 6,245 yard course was designed in 1974. 

Fakenham Racecourse is a thoroughbred horse racing venue to the south of the town. Charles III is patron. It is the venue for the West Norfolk Hunt&#x27;s Point to Point steeplechase.

==Transport==
===Railway===

Fakenham is no longer served by the National Rail network; the nearest stations are at , and .

The town used to have two railway stations:
* , opened as &quot;Fakenham&quot; on 20 March 1849, was the terminus of the Wymondham to Wells Branch railway. The line was extended to in 1857 and the station was renamed &quot;Fakenham East&quot; in 1948. It was recommended for closure in the 1963 Beeching Report and was closed by the government in the following year. 
* opened in 1880. It was built as part of the Midland and Great Northern Joint Railway main line that meandered across Norfolk from King&#x27;s Lynn to Sheringham, , Norwich and Great Yarmouth. It was closed in 1959.

There was no connection between the two railway lines; the line south of Fakenham West crossed the line from Fakenham East south of the former station, on a girder bridge that still exists immediately north of a three-span bridge over the River Wensum.

When Fakenham East closed to passengers on 5 October 1964, the line remained open for goods. A special passenger service named the &quot;Fakenham Flyer&quot; ran on 21 April 1979, but this proved to be the only such instance, as the line closed permanently the following year.

===Buses===
Fakenham is served by several bus routes operated by different companies:
* Sanders Coaches towards Holt and Sheringham
* Lynx to Wells-next-the-Sea and King&#x27;s Lynn
* First Norfolk &amp; Suffolk to Norwich
* Konectbus to Dereham

===Roads===
The town is at the junction of several local roads, including the A148 from King&#x27;s Lynn to Cromer, the A1067 to Norwich and the A1065 to Swaffham. A single-carriageway bypass was constructed in the mid-1980s to carry the A148 to the north of the town.

==Notable people==

Notable people from Fakenham include:
*Thomas Miller, bookseller and antiquarian.
*Sir Robert Seppings, a shipwright who was knighted on the Royal Yacht in 1819.
*Sir George Edwards, farm workers&#x27; leader, and later local MP.
*Peter Parfitt, an England and Middlesex cricketer in the early 1960s, attended Fakenham Grammar School.
*Horatio Nelson
*Simon Dring, journalist and television producer.

Other notable people from the town include footballing brothers Ryan Jarvis and Rossi Jarvis, formerly of Norwich City and Adam Tann, whose League career ended at Chelmsford City and is the cousin of the Jarvis brothers. Another former Norwich City footballer, Matt Gill, grew up in the town and attended the local junior school and high school.

<text>Ultrasonic welding is an industrial process whereby high-frequency ultrasonic acoustic vibrations are locally applied to work pieces being held together under pressure to create a solid-state weld. It is commonly used for plastics and metals, and especially for joining dissimilar materials. In ultrasonic welding, there are no connective bolts, nails, soldering materials, or adhesives necessary to bind the materials together. When used to join metals, the temperature stays well below the melting point of the involved materials, preventing any unwanted properties which may arise from high temperature exposure of the metal.

== History ==
Practical application of ultrasonic welding for rigid plastics was completed in the 1960s. At this point only hard plastics could be welded. The patent for the ultrasonic method for welding rigid thermoplastic parts was awarded to Robert Soloff and Seymour Linsley in 1965. Soloff, the founder of Sonics &amp; Materials Inc., was a lab manager at Branson Instruments where thin plastic films were welded into bags and tubes using ultrasonic probes. He unintentionally moved the probe close to a plastic tape dispenser and observed that the halves of the dispenser welded together. He realized that the probe did not need to be manually moved around the part, but that the ultrasonic energy could travel through and around rigid plastics and weld an entire joint. He went on to develop the first ultrasonic press. The first application of this new technology was in the toy industry.

The first car made entirely out of plastic was assembled using ultrasonic welding in 1969. The automotive industry has used it regularly since the 1980s, and it is now used for a multitude of applications.

==Process==

For joining complex injection molded thermoplastic parts, ultrasonic welding equipment can be customized to fit the exact specifications of the parts being welded. The parts are sandwiched between a fixed shaped nest (anvil) and a sonotrode (horn) connected to a transducer, and a ~20-70kHz low-amplitude acoustic vibration is emitted. When welding plastics, the interface of the two parts is specially designed to concentrate the melting process. One of the materials usually has a spiked or rounded energy director which contacts the second plastic part. The ultrasonic energy melts the point contact between the parts, creating a joint. Ultrasonic welding of thermoplastics causes local melting of the plastic due to absorption of vibrational energy along the joint to be welded. In metals, welding occurs due to high-pressure dispersion of surface oxides and local motion of the materials. Although there is heating, it is not enough to melt the base materials.

Ultrasonic welding can be used for both hard and soft plastics, such as semicrystalline plastics, and metals. The understanding of ultrasonic welding has increased with research and testing. The invention of more sophisticated and inexpensive equipment and increased demand for plastic and electronic components has led to a growing knowledge of the fundamental process. However, many aspects of ultrasonic welding still require more study, such as the relationship of weld quality to process parameters. 

Scientists from the Institute of Materials Science and Engineering (WKK) of University of Kaiserslautern, with the support from the German Research Foundation (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft), have succeeded in proving that using ultrasonic welding processes can lead to highly durable bonds between light metals and carbon-fiber-reinforced polymer (CFRP) sheets.

A benefit of ultrasonic welding is that there is no drying time as with conventional adhesives or solvents, so the workpieces do not need to remain in a fixture for longer than it takes for the weld to cool. The welding can easily be automated, making clean and precise joints; the site of the weld is very clean and rarely requires any touch-up work. The low thermal impact on the materials involved enables a greater number of materials to be welded together. The process is a good automated alternative to glue, screws or snap-fit designs. 

Ultrasonic welding is typically used with small parts (e.g. cell phones, consumer electronics, disposable medical tools, toys, etc.) but it can be used on parts as large as a small automotive instrument cluster. Ultrasonics can also be used to weld metals, but are typically limited to small welds of thin, malleable metals such as aluminum, copper, and nickel. Ultrasonics would not be used in welding the chassis of an automobile or in welding pieces of a bicycle together, due to the power levels required.

== Components ==
All ultrasonic welding systems are composed of the same basic elements:
* A press, usually with a pneumatic or electric drive, to assemble two parts under pressure
* A nest or anvil or fixture where the parts are placed and allowing the high frequency vibration to be directed to the interfaces
* An ultrasonic stack composed of a converter or piezoelectric transducer, an optional booster and a Horn. All three elements of the stack are specifically tuned to resonate at the same exact ultrasonic frequency (Typically 15, 20, 30, 35 or 40 kHz)
** Converter: Converts the electrical signal into a mechanical vibration using piezo electric effect
** Booster: Modifies the amplitude of the vibration mechanically. It is also used in standard systems to clamp the stack in the press.
** Horn: Takes the shape of the part, also modifies the amplitude mechanically and applies the mechanical vibration to the parts to be welded.
* An electronic ultrasonic generator (US: Power supply) delivering a high power electric signal with frequency matching the resonance frequency of the stack.
* A controller controlling the movement of the press and the delivery of the ultrasonic energy.

==Applications==

The applications of ultrasonic welding are extensive and are found in many industries including electrical and computer, automotive and aerospace, medical, and packaging. Whether two items can be ultrasonically welded is determined by their thickness. If they are too thick this process will not join them. This is the main obstacle in the welding of metals. However, wires, microcircuit connections, sheet metal, foils, ribbons and meshes are often joined using ultrasonic welding. Ultrasonic welding is a very popular technique for bonding thermoplastics. It is fast and easily automated with weld times often below one second and there is no ventilation system required to remove heat or exhaust. This type of welding is often used to build assemblies that are too small, too complex, or too delicate for more common welding techniques.

===Computer and electrical industries===
In the electrical and computer industry ultrasonic welding is often used to join wired connections and to create connections in small, delicate circuits. Junctions of wire harnesses are often joined using ultrasonic welding. Wire harnesses are large groupings of wires used to distribute electrical signals and power. Electric motors, field coils, transformers and capacitors may also be assembled with ultrasonic welding. It is also often preferred in the assembly of storage media such as flash drives and computer disks because of the high volumes required. Ultrasonic welding of computer disks has been found to have cycle times of less than 300 ms.

One of the areas in which ultrasonic welding is most used and where new research and experimentation is centered is microcircuits. This process is ideal for microcircuits since it creates reliable bonds without introducing impurities or thermal distortion into components. Semiconductor devices, transistors and diodes are often connected by thin aluminum and gold wires using ultrasonic welding. It is also used for bonding wiring and ribbons as well as entire chips to microcircuits. An example of where microcircuits are used is in medical sensors used to monitor the human heart in bypass patients.

One difference between ultrasonic welding and traditional welding is the ability of ultrasonic welding to join dissimilar materials. The assembly of battery components is a good example of where this ability is utilized. When creating battery and fuel cell components, thin gauge copper, nickel and aluminium connections, foil layers and metal meshes are often ultrasonically welded together. Multiple layers of foil or mesh can often be applied in a single weld eliminating steps and costs.

===Aerospace and automotive industries===

For automobiles, ultrasonic welding tends to be used to assemble large plastic and electrical components such as instrument panels, door panels, lamps, air ducts, steering wheels, upholstery and engine components. As plastics have continued to replace other materials in the design and manufacture of automobiles, the assembly and joining of plastic components has increasingly become a critical issue. Some of the advantages for ultrasonic welding are low cycle times, automation, low capital costs, and flexibility. Ultrasonic welding does not damage surface finish because the high-frequency vibrations prevent marks from being generated, which is a crucial consideration for many car manufacturers, .

Ultrasonic welding is generally utilized in the aerospace industry when joining thin sheet gauge metals and other lightweight materials. Aluminum is a difficult metal to weld using traditional techniques because of its high thermal conductivity. However, it is one of the easier materials to weld using ultrasonic welding because it is a softer metal and thus a solid-state weld is simple to achieve. Since aluminum is so widely used in the aerospace industry, it follows that ultrasonic welding is an important manufacturing process. With the advent of new composite materials, ultrasonic welding is becoming even more prevalent. It has been used in the bonding of the popular composite material carbon fiber. Numerous studies have been done to find the optimum parameters that will produce quality welds for this material.

===Medical industry===

In the medical industry ultrasonic welding is often used because it does not introduce contaminants or degradation into the weld and the machines can be specialized for use in clean rooms. The process can also be highly automated, provides strict control over dimensional tolerances and does not interfere with the biocompatibility of parts. Therefore, it increases part quality and decreases production costs. Items such as arterial filters, anesthesia filters, blood filters, IV catheters, dialysis tubes, pipettes, cardiometry reservoirs, blood/gas filters, face masks and IV spike/filters can all be made using ultrasonic welding. Another important application in the medical industry for ultrasonic welding is textiles. Items like hospital gowns, sterile garments, masks, transdermal patches and textiles for clean rooms can be sealed and sewn using ultrasonic welding. This prevents contamination and dust production and reduces the risk of infection.

===Packaging industry===

Ultrasonic welding is often used in packaging applications. Many common items are either created or packaged using ultrasonic welding. Sealing containers, tubes and blister packs are common applications.

Ultrasonic welding is also applied in the packaging of dangerous materials, such as explosives, fireworks and other reactive chemicals. These items tend to require hermetic sealing, but cannot be subjected to high temperatures. One example is a butane lighter. This container weld must be able to withstand high pressure and stress and must be airtight to contain the butane. Another example is the packaging of ammunition and propellants. These packages must be able to withstand high pressure and stress to protect the consumer from the contents.

The food industry finds ultrasonic welding preferable to traditional joining techniques, because it is fast, sanitary and can produce hermetic seals. Milk and juice containers are examples of products often sealed using ultrasonic welding. The paper parts to be sealed are coated with plastic, generally polypropylene or polyethylene, and then welded together to create an airtight seal. The main obstacle to overcome in this process is the setting of the parameters. For example, if over-welding occurs, then the concentration of plastic in the weld zone may be too low and cause the seal to break. If it is under-welded, the seal is incomplete. Variations in the thicknesses of materials can cause variations in weld quality. Some other food items sealed using ultrasonic welding include candy bar wrappers, frozen food packages and beverage containers.

=== Experimental ===
&quot;Sonic agglomeration&quot;, a combination of ultrasonic welding and molding, is used to produce compact food ration bars for the US Army&#x27;s Close Combat Assault Ration project without the use of binders. Dried food is pressed into a mold and welded for an hour, during which food particles become stuck together.

==Safety==
Hazards of ultrasonic welding include exposure to high temperatures and voltages. This equipment should be operated using the safety guidelines provided by the manufacturer to avoid injury. For instance, operators must never place hands or arms near the welding tip when the machine is activated. Also, operators should be provided with hearing protection and safety glasses. Operators should be informed of government agency regulations for the ultrasonic welding equipment and these regulations should be enforced.

Ultrasonic welding machines require routine maintenance and inspection. Panel doors, housing covers and protective guards may need to be removed for maintenance. This should be done when the power to the equipment is off and only by the trained professional servicing the machine.

Sub-harmonic vibrations, which can create annoying audible noise, may be caused in larger parts near the machine due to the ultrasonic welding frequency. This noise can be damped by clamping these large parts at one or more locations. Also, high-powered welders with frequencies of 15 kHz and 20 kHz typically emit a potentially damaging high-pitched squeal in the range of human hearing. Shielding this radiating sound can be done using an acoustic enclosure.

<text>The Volkswagen K70 is a four-door, front engine, front wheel drive sedan developed by NSU and marketed from 1970–1975 by Volkswagen after its 1969 acquisition of NSU.

Designed by NSU&#x27;s chief engineer Ewald Praxl and styled by Claus Luthe as a four-door sedan (and five-door wagon) to complement the NSU Ro80, the K70 would become the first Volkswagen with a front-mounted engine, water cooling and front wheel drive. Competing with VW&#x27;s own 411/412 and Audi&#x27;s 100, the K70 was ultimately sold only as a sedan, with 211,127 examples manufactured for model years 1970–1975.

The K70 retained NSU&#x27;s naming convention, as introduced with the Ro 80 — with K denoting the German word &quot;Kolben&quot; (piston) and 70 designating an engine output of .

The K70 was originally developed to complement the Ro 80, distinguished by its conventional piston engine rather than the Ro80&#x27;s Wankel rotary engine. NSU scheduled the press launch for March 1969, intending to present it to the wider public at the 1969 Geneva Motor Show.

Prior to launch, rumors arose that Volkswagen would absorb cash strapped NSU. Even before the take over had been made public, the K70&#x27;s future was threatened by management concerns that the K70 was too close in size and price to the recently launched Audi 100. Plans for the K70 launch were deferred at the last minute, with rumors that Volkswagen removed the K70 from NSU&#x27;s show stand on the eve of the show. The NSU K70 was shown and advertised in Automobil Revue&#x27;s 1969 Geneva Show yearbook, published in March 1969, with a note in the addenda stating that the K70 &quot;will not be built for the time being&quot; and will not be shown. In total, 23 pre-series K70s with NSU badging were built. BMW may have also been relieved, as the NSU K70 would have competed directly with their recently introduced 2002.

A 26 April 1969 NSU shareholders&#x27; meeting endorsed a NSU/VW merger in which NSU was to take over Auto Union in return for an increase in the NSU share capital issued to Volkswagen. In reality, VW took over NSU, and during 1969 NSU was integrated with Auto Union, which Volkswagen had acquired from Daimler Benz in 1964 — in turn creating the basis of modern-day Audi.

VW needed a new family sedan to replace the Type 4 (Volkswagen 411 / 412), which itself had been intended as a move upmarket from Type 1-based cars. Considering the K70, with its front wheel drive and modern styling, could transform its image, VW scrapped publicity material showing the K70 badged as an NSU, and just over a year later the sedan went into production at Volkswagen&#x27;s new Salzgitter plant, rather than at NSU&#x27;s Neckarsulm plant. Branded as a Volkswagen, the K70 arrived off the production line in August 1970, and was subsequently launched in export markets. A launch date for the wagon / estate version, which would have competed directly against the Volkswagen 411/412 Variant, was delayed indefinitely.

==Versions==
The K70 was launched featuring a four-cylinder water-cooled engine: this was a development from the four-cylinder air cooled engine mounted in the rear of the NSU 1200, its displacement increased to . Despite reports that the car&#x27;s name reflected an output of , the engine was rated . It was longitudinally mounted, well forward and placed directly above the differential, between the front wheels, and canted to the right. The clutch and gear box were directly behind the differential, and the three comprised a compact package which necessitated a relatively high bonnet but which also maximised the proportion of the car&#x27;s weight carried by the front wheels, and the space available for passengers and their luggage, characteristics that the K70 shared with the NSU Ro80. The K70 also featured the same inboard disc brakes as the Ro80.

The performance from the engine, especially on the entry level version, was merely adequate. Comparison with the 411, which by 1970 had acquired an enlarged engine and fuel injection, was (and is) hard to avoid. Neither of VW&#x27;s family middle weight sedans topped the charts for top speed and acceleration, nor for fuel consumption, and the K70&#x27;s indifferent fuel consumption became an increasingly pressing issue because the car&#x27;s production run coincided with the 1973 oil crisis.

For what was essentially a limited production car, the K70 did undergo numerous changes. Most of them were intended to increase the parts commonality with other Volkswagen products (which was initially nearly none at all). The original square-edged bumpers were replaced with the rounded ones of the Audi 100 in August 1971. The shifter linkage was simplified in the spring of 1972, which improved the shift action; a new synchronization design introduced in August 1972 (for the 1973 model year) further improved it. At this time the car was also modified beneath the front bumper, with new openings in the sheet metal to provide better cooling for the differential. At the same time, the L versions&#x27; rectangular headlights were replaced with twin round units which distanced the car slightly from its NSU origins. In August 1974 the three-spoke steering wheel was replaced with a padded, four-spoke item also used in the Beetle. The May 1973 introduction of an version with a claimed addressed performance concerns and was accompanied by redesigned engine and transmission mountings intended to reduce interior noise. The final K70s did out-accelerate the final 412s, and had a higher maximum speed although the 411/412 offered a fuel mileage advantage.

==Design==

Tall by contemporary standards, the K70 benefited from the space saving characteristics of its front wheel drive layout and compact engine installation. The boxy cabin was unusually spacious and the luggage capacity class leading. The driver sat slightly higher than in competitor vehicles and the large window area conferred above average all-round visibility. The relatively large glass area also led to the car carrying an above average proportion of its weight above waist height, however, rendering a wide track particularly important in order to ensure lateral stability.

The 1960s was a decade when forward looking manufacturers were highlighting secondary safety features. Those on the K70 included a fuel tank mounted directly ahead of the rear axle and boot/trunk, within the wheelbase. As publicity for the Mercedes-Benz S Class would stress when that car was launched in 1972, this was the least vulnerable position in terms of the risk of the fuel tank being punctured in the event of a crash. The steering column was angled in order to reduce the risk of its being pushed too far back into the passenger cabin, and while seat belts were an optional extra, at least on the domestic market, mounting points for them were standard.

==Commercial==

For the Volkswagen dealership network, their staff trained over many years to promote and service rear-engined air-cooled cars, the appearance at relatively short notice of the water-cooled front-engined K70 presented a challenge. Although the car was priced below the Audi 100, there was an unavoidable overlap in the market place with the Volkswagen 411. Despite the different badging, some potential buyers may have tarred the K70 with the same brush as its unreliable NSU Ro 80 sister car, leading to poor sales. The car also gained a reputation for rampant body corrosion from which it never recovered.

The K70 was replaced in 1973 by the Audi-based Volkswagen Passat, although it continued in production until February 1975, by which time Volkswagen had produced 210,082 K70s. An alternative source gives the production total for the K70 as 211,127. Of these, only 800 were thought to have been produced in right-hand drive for the British market, of which eleven were reported to remain on the road in 2024. The K70 together with the VW 411/412 ended up being the only cars ever to be produced at Salzgitter, the plant being turned over for engine and transmission manufacture for the entire Volkswagen Group, which continues to the present day.

<text>Brenda Starr, Reporter (often referred to simply as Brenda Starr) is a comic strip about a glamorous, adventurous reporter. It was created in 1940 by Dale Messick for the Chicago Tribune Syndicate, and continued by others until 2011.

==History==
Although set in Chicago, &quot;Brenda Starr, Reporter&quot; initially was the only Chicago Tribune Syndicate strip not to appear in the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; newspaper. When the strip debuted on June 30, 1940, it was relegated to a comic book supplement that was included with the Sunday &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;. Soon the strip appeared in the Sunday paper and a daily strip was added starting October 22, 1945. During the 1950s, at the height of its popularity, the strip appeared in 250 newspapers. In 2010, the strip appeared in 65 newspapers, 36 of them international.

===Beginnings===
Dalia Messick had ambitions to create a comic strip from her early days; she submitted her first strip, &quot;Weegee&quot;, in the mid-1920s, when she was just out of high school. After studying at The Art Institute of Chicago, she got a job designing greeting cards. During the 1930s, Messick submitted three more comic strips—&quot;Peg and Pudy&quot; and &quot;Streamline Babies&quot; were about &quot;Depression-era heroines born ahead of their time, working girls come to the big city to earn their living&quot;, while &quot;Mimi the Mermaid&quot; explored a fantasy theme. Feeling that editors were prejudiced against female cartoonists, Dalia signed these strips with a more ambiguous first name, &quot;Dale&quot;. Still, these strips were each rejected.

In 1940, Messick created a new heroine—a &quot;girl bandit&quot; named Brenda Starr—whose looks were modeled on the film star Rita Hayworth, and named after a popular debutante, Brenda Frazier. She submitted the new strip to the Chicago Tribune-New York News syndicate, but the syndicate chief, Joseph Medill Patterson, &quot;had tried a woman cartoonist once... and wanted no more of them.&quot; Patterson&#x27;s assistant, Mollie Slott—later the vice president of the syndicate—saw the discarded samples, and encouraged Messick to make Brenda a reporter. Patterson accepted the strip, but ran it in the Chicago Tribune&#x27;s Sunday comic book supplement, rather than the daily paper. He refused to run it in his other paper, the &quot;New York Daily News&quot;, which finally carried &quot;Brenda Starr&quot; in 1948, two years after Patterson&#x27;s death. After the strip was established, other instances of resistance were reported. &quot;Whenever Ms. Messick drew in cleavage or a navel, the syndicate would erase it. She was once banned in Boston after showing Brenda smoking a polka dot cigar.&quot;

===Later production teams===
Following Messick&#x27;s retirement as &quot;Brenda Starr&quot; artist in 1980, the strip was continued by different female writer and illustrator teams. From 1980 through 1982, Messick continued scripting, and the strip was illustrated by Ramona Fradon. In 1982, Linda Sutter took over writing. Mary Schmich began scripting the strip in 1985, with Fradon continuing as the illustrator until her 1995 retirement. From 1995 onward, June Brigman illustrated Schmich&#x27;s scripts.

===End===
The final strip was published on January 2, 2011.
According to Mary Schmich, the strip ended because she and June Brigman had both &quot;decided to move on,&quot; and publishing and distributing the strip was no longer profitable for the Chicago Tribune. &quot;Besides, in real-time, Brenda is close to 100 years old.&quot;

===Characters===

Brenda has always been a modern woman, noted for her exotic adventures and steamy romances. Dale Messick and later artists concentrated on keeping Brenda contemporary in clothing and hairstyles. Comics historians Steve Duin and Mike Richardson stated that &quot;Dale Messick kept readers enthralled for years over the romance between Brenda Starr and her Mystery Man&quot;. Before Messick retired, Brenda finally married the mysterious Basil St. John, her &quot;Mystery Man&quot;, whose eye patch and black orchid serum have been a regular plot element. Shortly thereafter, Brenda had a baby girl named Starr Twinkle St. John. Brenda and Basil divorced, and sparks flew when they met again. During one of Basil&#x27;s reappearances, Brenda discovered Basil had a son named Sage with the talk show host Wanda Fonda. That marriage also ended in divorce. Brenda and Wanda became good friends. Eventually, Brenda was promoted from reporter to editor. Brenda was the daughter of actress Beth Bennet (or Bennett) and her husband Jack Starr. Her mother died under mysterious circumstances and Brenda&#x27;s grief-stricken father sent her to boarding school. 

Other regular characters include:

* Muggs Walters, the original editor of &quot;The Flash&quot; and Brenda&#x27;s boss, starting with the first strip. 
* Pesky Miller, wisecracking cub reporter. Pesky appeared in the first &quot;Brenda Starr&quot; strip in June 1940, and continued for decades. He rarely takes an active role in the story; his main role is to be a voice in the newsroom that admires Brenda. 
* Tom Taylor, reporter and Brenda&#x27;s original love interest. He appeared in the first strip in June 1940, saying, &quot;Now, listen, Brenda. Call it off and for the millionth time will ya marry me?&quot; He continued in that vein, unsuccessfully, for five years, until he fell for copy girl Slim Nolan and married her in January 1946.
* Daphne Dimples, Walters&#x27; niece and an early rival of Brenda&#x27;s. She first appeared in late 1940, trying to take Brenda&#x27;s job.
* Abretha Breeze, Brenda&#x27;s stout cousin from Indiana. She arrived for a visit with her dog Tornado in August 1941, and stayed until June 1948, when she married Hyram &quot;Hi&quot; Pockets, and went to live on his farm.
* Hank O&#x27;Hair, female city editor with a notably androgynous look. O&#x27;Hair was modeled after reporter Pat O&#x27;Haire, who worked as a copy girl at the &quot;New York Daily News&quot; in the early 1940s. Hank was introduced in the strip in the fall of 1942, and remained a regular character through the end of the strip in 2011.
* Atwell Livwright, managing editor of &quot;The Flash&quot;. He took over the paper in 1948.
* Gabby Van Slander, gossip columnist and catty rival of Brenda. Gabby was introduced by writer Mary Schmich in her first week of writing the strip, in September 1985, and remained a regular character through the end.
* Mikhail Goodenuf, handsome, blonde and muscular Soviet ballet dancer who defected to the United States and became a secret agent. He met Brenda in January 1986, while he was investigating a Russian plot to sell an addictive, deadly drug to Americans as an energy supplement. Mikhail and Brenda began a romantic entanglement that lasted several years, and crossed over with Basil&#x27;s storyline.

==Final storylines==
===2009: Romance in Paris===
However, Basil&#x27;s mysterious assistant, a handsome Kazooki code-named &quot;Ringo,&quot; persuaded Sage and Brenda to travel instead to Paris, France. Sage was thrilled by the idea of traveling by an undersea tunnel. Brenda admitted that she &quot;could never say no to Paris.&quot; In the French capital, Ringo revealed two secrets to Brenda: 1) Basil was financing and training teachers to educate the Kazooki people (which would put Basil on a death list if found out by the repressive government of Kazookistan); and 2) Ringo was in love with Brenda. When he says the latter, Brenda either does not hear him—or pretends not to. But the second time, she clearly hears him—and feels as if she is drowning. She recovers, and says: &quot;Thanks for the gift.&quot; Then the two continue exploring Paris and explaining their feelings to each other. They drink an entire bottle of champagne and Ringo recites mystic Sufi love poetry to Brenda. When the bottle is empty, Ringo places a love poem by Hafez inside it, and casts it into the Seine, calculating that one day it will reach American shores. They bid a sad bittersweet farewell. Ringo returns to Kazookistan. Brenda returns Sage to his mother Wanda in the US.

===2009: Move to India===

Bottomline, Brenda&#x27;s boss, orders her to take a furlough—an unpaid leave. Starr instead accepts a job offer from her old friend Pug—who is now working for a newspaper in India. Brenda and Pug very early have a major disagreement, concerning a street child. Brenda is ready to adopt the hungry little girl, but Pug warns her against falling for the wiles of the &quot;slumpuppies&quot;. Starr also finds herself instantly attracted to a dark and handsome fellow reporter, Salman Mistry. Salman shows some hostility towards Brenda, mostly because she is an American. The street urchin, named Carina, turns out to actually be the rich heiress of the wealthy Khan family. The other members of the family—Taj, Raj, Caressa—are suspects in a major and complex conspiracy, including the assassination of journalists and a plot for brutal slum clearance.

===2010: Family corruption===
Back in the US, Brenda is shocked to discover that &quot;The Flash&quot; has become a free newspaper and has taken on a blogger, the callow Jason. She is disappointed too when her old friend Harry Rumples seems to have sold out to the politicians. When the new mayor, charismatic Sterling Golden, is implicated in a murder, Brenda flies off to Belize in Central America, in search of the missing green campaigner Verde. Golden&#x27;s manipulative mother turns out to be behind the murder and other dark doings. Brenda next investigates eccentric district attorney Tap Fitzpatrick in relation to the death of her fellow reporter Felicity Fox, and discovers that Tap&#x27;s father is plotting against him while faking senility.

At the newspaper holiday party, Brenda announces her retirement. In the final strip (published Sunday, January 2, 2011), she says good-bye to everyone and walks away with tears in her eyes. As she leaves the party, she receives a box containing a black orchid, and a card with the initials BSJ.

==Other media==
===Comic books===

&quot;Brenda Starr, Reporter&quot; was published as a comic book series by four different publishing houses. The first was Four Star Publications in 1947, followed by Superior Publishing from 1948 through 1949. In 1955 Charlton Comics carried the series, as well as Dell Publishing in 1963. Among the several comic book runs the 1948 Superior series featured art by Jack Kamen in issues #2, #4 and #14. &quot;Brenda Starr&quot; is currently being reprinted by Hermes Press.

===Films and TV===
Through the years there have been four film and television movies based on the comic strip. The first was &quot;Brenda Starr, Reporter&quot;, a 1945 serial with Joan Woodbury in the title role. A Brenda Starr movie, produced for television, that starred Jill St. John in the lead role was released in 1976.
An unsold television pilot movie starring Sherry Jackson was produced in 1979. The last film produced to date was &quot;Brenda Starr&quot; with Brooke Shields and Timothy Dalton. Although produced in 1986, the movie was not released in the United States until 1992 due to lengthy litigation over distribution rights. The movie was panned by critics and is considered to be a notorious critical and commercial failure. In 2006, Tribune Media Services and actress Jenna Mattison were looking for producers to create a TV movie or series based on Brenda Starr.

===Merchandising and tie-ins===
* In 1964, the Madame Alexander Doll Company introduced a Barbie-like fashion doll named after and depicting Brenda Starr. The doll was a commercial failure and for 1965 Madame Alexander chose to no longer pay the royalties to use the Brenda Starr name. The same doll was renamed Yolanda for 1965 and failed again, and by 1966 the doll was discontinued. 
* &quot;Brenda Starr, Reporter&quot; was one of 20 comic strips honored as Comic Strip Classics in a special release of commemorative postage stamps in 1995.
* In 2003, the Effanbee Doll Company introduced a 16&quot; Brenda Starr collectible fashion doll, with glamorous 1940s fashions inspired by the comic strip. The collection was extended in 2004 to include a doll of Brenda&#x27;s apprentice Daphne Dimples and in 2005 a Basil St. John doll debuted with an extensive wardrobe. By 2007, the Brenda Starr line had been retired.
* In 2006, the Society of Professional Journalists sold posters and other merchandise with Brenda Starr proclaiming, &quot;Freedom of the press means freedom for everyone.&quot;

===In popular culture===
* The character was name-checked by the rock group Blondie on their single &quot;Rip Her to Shreds&quot;.

<text>Hesperis is a genus of flowering plants in the family Brassicaceae. Most are native to Eurasia, with several endemic to Greece and Turkey. Many plants of this genus bear showy, fragrant flowers in shades of purple and white. One of the more widely known species is the common garden flower &quot;Hesperis matronalis&quot;.
The genus name &quot;Hesperis&quot; was probably given because the scent of the flowers becomes more conspicuous towards evening (&quot;Hespera&quot; is the Greek word for evening).

<doc id="710162" wikidata="Q4673255" url="?curid=710162" title="Acetate disc">
<text>An acetate disc (also known as a &quot;lacquer&quot;, &quot;test acetate&quot;, &quot;dubplate&quot;, or &quot;transcription disc&quot;) is a type of phonograph record generally used from the 1930s to the late 1950s for recording and broadcast purposes. Despite their name, &quot;acetate&quot; discs do not contain any acetate.

Lacquer-coated discs are used for the production of records. Unlike ordinary vinyl records, which are quickly formed from lumps of plastic by a mass-production molding process, a lacquer master or acetate (instantaneous record) is created by using a recording lathe to cut an audio-signal-modulated groove into its surface – a sequential operation requiring expensive, delicate equipment and expert skill for good results.

In addition to their use in the creation of masters, lacquers were widely used for many purposes before magnetic tape recorders became common, and in the modern era they are used by dance music DJs. They were used in radio broadcasting to archive live broadcasts, pre-record local programming, delay network feeds for broadcast at a later time, and provide programming &quot;from home&quot; on the Armed Forces Radio Network. They were used extensively in Jamaica by sound system operators in the late 1940s and 1950s. Acetates were often used as &quot;demos&quot; of new recordings by artists and record labels. Some acetates are highly prized for their rarity, especially when they contain unpublished material.

== Physical characteristics ==

Despite their name, &quot;acetate&quot; discs do not contain any acetate. They consist of an aluminum disc with a coating of nitrocellulose lacquer with acetone added to make a varnish. Glass was often used for the substrate during World War II, when aluminum was in short supply. The production process results in a disc that is different in several ways from the vinyl records sold to customers at retail. Most noticeably, vinyl records are comparatively lightweight and flexible, while lacquers are rigid and considerably heavier because of their metal cores.

Lacquers commonly come in three sizes: discs for singles and discs for albums as well as discs for LP references and for 10&quot; master cuts. The record&#x27;s sleeve is typically nothing more than a generic cover from the manufacturing company and the disc&#x27;s label is similarly plain, containing only basic information about the content (title, artist, playing time, and so on), which is usually typed but may be hand-written.

Although once produced in a wide range of sizes (from less than to more than in diameter) and sometimes with glass core discs, the examples most commonly encountered today are in diameter. 

Blank discs were traditionally produced in several different grades, with the best and costliest grade featuring the sturdiest core, the thickest coating and the most perfectly flawless mirror-like surfaces. These top-quality blanks were intended for cutting the master discs that, once silver-coated, would be electrodeposited with nickel in order to electroform parts used in making stampers (negative profile metal moulds) for pressing ordinary records. Lower-quality blanks were considered adequate for non-critical uses such as tests and demo discs. Lower-grade blanks were formerly made for home use by amateurs and may be very thin and flexible, may have a cardboard rather than a metal or glass base, and may have noticeably dull or slightly orange-peel-textured surfaces.

In addition to the usual central &quot;spindle hole&quot;, there is traditionally at least one &quot;drive hole&quot; in the label area, meant to be engaged by a special pin that prevents the disc from slipping on the turntable during the recording process if the lathe does not have a vacuum turntable. Drive holes are often hidden by labels applied after the recording was cut, but they can usually be detected by careful inspection of the label or by holding the disc up to a light bright enough to penetrate the labels. Drive holes are no longer standard on lacquer masters, only on &quot;dubs&quot;, because the additional holes can interfere with the electroforming process and professional mastering lathes use vacuum turntables that hold the workpiece (lacquer disc) in place with suction. One pump usually provides suction for both the turntable and the chip tube that pulls away the fine string of nitrocellulose lacquer removed by the groove-cutting stylus.

Acetate discs are made for special purposes, almost never for sale to the general public. They can be played on any normal record player but will suffer from wear more quickly than vinyl, since the lacquer does not have the same properties as that of vinyl.

== Production ==

Acetates are usually made by dubbing from a master recording in another medium, such as magnetic tape. In the vinyl record manufacturing process, a lacquer master disc is cut and electroforming is used to make negative metal molds from it; certain molds are converted into stampers, can be used to press thousands of vinyl copies of the master. Within the vinyl record industry, lacquers, sometimes called &#x27;acetates&#x27; or &#x27;refs&#x27;, are also used for evaluating the quality of the tape-to-disc transfer. They were once a favored medium for comparing different takes or mixes of a recording, and if pressed vinyl copies of an impending new release were not yet available, acetates were used for getting preview copies into the hands of important radio disc jockeys.

Acetates were produced in very small quantities using elementary cutting machines. The majority of discs found on the market were not labelled or marked, as distributing studios would only at most have their name and address written on the disc. It was generally up to the recipients to write the song title or name of the artist onto the disc by hand.

On February 6, 2020, news broke of a fire at the Apollo Masters manufacturing plant in Banning, California. The plant produces Lacquer discs used in vinyl production with the fire completely destroying the manufacturing facility. The manufacturing facility is one of only two in the world, the other being Public Record (the lacquers of which are labeled MDC – the name of their principal distributor, based in Japan). This led to industry experts fearing that the vinyl production supply chain would be put under stress with heavy demand and only one factory worldwide.

== Uses ==

Lacquers were generally used from the 1930s to the late 1950s for recording and broadcast purposes and see limited use as of 2009. Lacquers have not always been used solely as a means of evaluating a tape-to-disc transfer or cutting the final master disc. They were used for many purposes before magnetic tape recorders became common, and in the modern era they are used by dance music DJs. They were used extensively in Jamaica by sound system operators in the late 1940s and 1950s. Acetates were often used as &quot;demos&quot; of new recordings by artists and record labels.

=== Disc mastering ===

In preparation for a record pressing, acetates are used for quality control prior to the production of the stampers, from which retail copies of the record will be pressed. The purpose of the test acetate(s) (called, &#x27;reference disks&#x27;) in the mastering process is to allow the artist, producer, engineer, and other interested parties to check the quality of the tape-to-disc recording process and make any necessary changes to ensure that the audio fidelity of the master disc will be as close as possible to that of the original master tape. The actual stamper sets can be made either from oversized lacquers or from DMM blanks (see Direct Metal Mastering).

=== Direct recording ===
Before the introduction of magnetic tape for mastering, disc recording was done &quot;live&quot; (see direct to disc recording), although sometimes intermediate disc-to-disc editing procedures were involved. Before lacquer discs were adopted for the purpose, the master recording was cut into a disc of wax-like material that was too soft to be played non-destructively and had to be used as a mandrel on which to electroform a metal stamper, which was in turn used to make playable pressings. Acetate blanks allowed high-quality playable records to be produced &quot;instantaneously&quot;.

Acetates were used in radio broadcasting to archive live broadcasts, pre-record local programming, delay network feeds for broadcast at a later time, and provide programming &quot;from home&quot; on the Armed Forces Radio Network. (In many cases, the AFRN disc is the only form in which a classic radio show has survived.) discs recorded at  rpm were used for these one-off &quot;electrical transcriptions&quot; beginning in the mid-1930s.

Disc recorders designed for amateur home use began appearing on the market around 1940, but their high prices limited sales, and then World War II brought their production to a halt. After the war, the popularity of such recorders greatly increased. It was not unusual for a carnival, circus, amusement park, or transit hub to offer disc recording in a booth for a modest fee. Countless discs were cut at parties and family gatherings, both for immediate amusement value and to preserve audio &quot;snapshots&quot; of these events and of the voices of relatives and friends. Schoolchildren and adults alike used them to practice speeches, amateur musical efforts were immortalized, and snippets of radio broadcasts were captured, all limited by the three- or four-minute maximum playing time of the 78 rpm large-groove format which was still standard for all home-use records. The home recorders typically had two tone arms, one for recording and the other for playback, and a red light to indicate recording was taking place. One problem with the process was the &quot;string&quot; of cut material that followed the recording tone arm as the groove was cut. This &quot;string&quot; could interfere with the recording process and required manual intervention to remove.

This relatively bulky equipment, and the bulky discs, were hauled to remote locations such as Yugoslavia (see Milman Parry) or the Mississippi Delta (see Archive of American Folk Song) by ethnographers, linguists, and musical researchers. Substantial collections of these recordings are available to researchers at academic and national libraries, as well as museums.

During the very early tape era, around 1950, acetate discs and portable disc recorders competed with magnetic tape as a location-recording medium, both for broadcast and semi-pro use, but tape&#x27;s several advantages quickly won the contest. Recording services hired to record weddings and other private events routinely captured them on tape, but because most homes of the 1950s and early 1960s were not equipped to play tapes, while nearly everyone had a record player, typically the recording was dubbed to disc and supplied to the client in that form and the original tape was recycled. Acetate discs are inherently less durable than some types of magnetic tape, and have the disadvantage of not being physically editable; unlike tape, acetates cannot be cut and spliced.

=== Black and dance music ===

In the dance music world, DJs cut new or otherwise special tracks on acetates, in order to test crowd response and find potential hits. This practice started as early as in the 1960s in Jamaica, between soundsystems, as a way of competing and drawing bigger crowds. These discs are known as dubplates. Dubplates were used by reggae soundsystems worldwide, and later adopted by producers of various dance music genres, most notably drum and bass and dubstep. Trading dubplates between different DJs is an important part of DJ culture. Actual acetate dubplates are declining in popularity, and being increasingly replaced by CDs and vinyl emulation software for reasons of weight, durability and overall cost.

== Value ==
Due to their rarity, some acetates can command high prices at auction. Brian Epstein&#x27;s collection of Beatles acetates fetched between $1,000 and $10,000 per disc, with a rare one reaching £77,500 at auction. An acetate from The Velvet Underground, containing music that would later appear on their first album &quot;The Velvet Underground &amp; Nico&quot;, sold in 2006 for $25,200. An acetate of Elvis Presley&#x27;s &quot;That&#x27;s All Right&quot; sold for $82,393.60 in 2013. The only known copy of Presley&#x27;s first recording—a 78 rpm acetate from 1953 featuring &quot;My Happiness&quot; backed with &quot;That&#x27;s When Your Heartaches Begin&quot;—sold for $300,000 at a Graceland auction in 2015.

<doc id="710164" wikidata="Q6496514" url="?curid=710164" title="Latin hypercube sampling">
<text>Latin hypercube sampling (LHS) is a statistical method for generating a near-random sample of parameter values from a multidimensional distribution. The sampling method is often used to construct computer experiments or for Monte Carlo integration.

LHS was described by Michael McKay of Los Alamos National Laboratory in 1979. An equivalent technique was independently proposed by Vilnis Eglājs in 1977. It was further elaborated by Ronald L. Iman and coauthors in 1981. Detailed computer codes and manuals were later published.

In the context of statistical sampling, a square grid containing sample positions is a Latin square if (and only if) there is only one sample in each row and each column. A Latin [[hypercube]] is the generalisation of this concept to an arbitrary number of dimensions, whereby each sample is the only one in each axis-aligned hyperplane containing it.

When sampling a function of formula_1 variables, the range of each variable is divided into formula_2 equally probable intervals. formula_2 sample points are then placed to satisfy the Latin hypercube requirements; this forces the number of divisions, formula_2, to be equal for each variable. This sampling scheme does not require more samples for more dimensions (variables); this independence is one of the main advantages of this sampling scheme. Another advantage is that random samples can be taken one at a time, remembering which samples were taken so far.

In two dimensions the difference between random sampling, Latin hypercube sampling, and orthogonal sampling can be explained as follows:
#In random sampling new sample points are generated without taking into account the previously generated sample points. One does not necessarily need to know beforehand how many sample points are needed.
#In Latin hypercube sampling one must first decide how many sample points to use and for each sample point remember in which row and column the sample point was taken. Such configuration is similar to having N rooks on a chess board without threatening each other.
#In orthogonal sampling, the sample space is partitioned into equally probable subspaces. All sample points are then chosen simultaneously making sure that the total set of sample points is a Latin hypercube sample and that each subspace is sampled with the same density.

Thus, orthogonal sampling ensures that the set of random numbers is a very good representative of the real variability, LHS ensures that the set of random numbers is representative of the real variability whereas traditional random sampling (sometimes called brute force) is just a set of random numbers without any guarantees.

<text>Isaac Burns Murphy (January 6, 1861 – February 16, 1896) was an American Hall of Fame jockey, considered one of the greatest riders in American Thoroughbred horse racing history. He won three runnings of the Kentucky Derby and was the first jockey to be inducted into the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame at its creation in 1955.

==Biography==

=== Early life ===
Isaac Burns Murphy was born into slavery on January 1, 1861, in Clark County, Kentucky. His mother America Murphy worked as a house slave on the Pleasant Green farm owned by David Tanner until the fall of 1864 when records indicate that she became a refugee at the Union Army depot at Camp Nelson. Isaac&#x27;s father Jerry had escaped from bondage and enlisted in the 114th US Colored Troops at Camp Nelson in the summer of 1864 and would fight in some of the most decisive battles of 1865. Jerry died at a Confederate prisoner-of-war camp

In 1867, America and Isaac moved in with family friend Eli Jordan, a man who would become one of the most important figures in Isaac&#x27;s life. Eli was a prominent horse trainer who worked for the Williams and Owings stables and, according to historian Pellom McDaniels: &quot;Isaac may have been the son Eli never had, and he impressed on the boy his definition of manhood, the importance of prudence and honesty, and the benefits of being consistent in all things.&quot;

Murphy began his racing career riding for Williams and Owings stables in 1875 at the age of 14. What followed was one of the most illustrious careers in the history of the sport, during which Murphy became one of the highest paid athletes and among the most famous black men in America. Murphy rode in eleven Kentucky Derbies, winning three times: on Buchanan in 1884, Riley in 1890, and Kingman in 1891. Kingman was owned by Jacobin Stables (co-owners, Preston Kinzea Stone and Dudley Allen) and trained by Dudley Allen, and was the first horse co-owned by an African-American to win the Derby. Murphy is the only jockey to have won the Kentucky Derby, the Kentucky Oaks, and the Clark Handicap in the same year (1884).

=== Salvator vs. Tenny ===
Among the most famous races of Murphy&#x27;s career was a match race at Sheepshead Bay on June 25, 1890. At the height of his career, Murphy rode Salvator to a dead-heat victory over Tenny and his rival jockey Edward &quot;Snapper&quot; Garrison. The race was considered to be one of the most thrilling races of all time, in which the most dominant black jockey squared off against one of the most dominant white jockeys, head-to-head. The race is also notable for being credited with the first instance of a &quot;photo finish,&quot; which was taken by photographer John C. Hemment.

=== Poisoning controversy ===
On August 26, 1890, at the Monmouth Handicap, Isaac fell off his horse Firenzi after crossing the finish line in last place. Given that Murphy and Firenzi had been the presumed favorites, along with long-standing rumors about Isaac&#x27;s ritual of drinking champagne before races, stories began to circulate that Isaac had been racing drunk. Following the incident, Isaac was suspended from racing pending an investigation.

Isaac strongly refuted the claim, maintaining that he had been drugged. Given Isaac&#x27;s longstanding reputation as a clean rider, some members of the press defended the jockey and called the accusations unfounded. Further adding to the scandal, it was found that bettors had uncharacteristically wagered heavily against Firenzi, betting instead on William Lakeland&#x27;s Tea Tray as the race drew near. Among those betting on Tea Tray was notable race &quot;plunger&quot; Dave Johnson who had lost $25,000 (over $750,000, adjusted for inflation) betting against Murphy on Salvator earlier that year.

For the rest of his life, Isaac maintained that he had been poisoned and, although he would race again, the accusation of drunkenness tainted the rest of his career.

=== Death and legacy ===
Murphy died of heart failure on February 16, 1896, in Lexington, Kentucky. While his funeral was attended by over 500 members of the community, over time, his unmarked grave in African Cemetery No. 2 was forgotten. During the 1960s, Frank B. Borries Jr., a University of Kentucky press specialist, spent three years searching for the grave site and in 1967, Murphy was reinterred at the old Man o&#x27; War burial site. With the building of the Kentucky Horse Park, his remains were moved to be buried again next to Man o&#x27; War at the entrance to the park.

According to his own calculations, Murphy won 628 of his 1,412 starts—a 44% victory rate which has never been equaled, and a record about which Hall of Fame jockey Eddie Arcaro said: &quot;There is no chance that his record of winning will ever be surpassed.&quot; By a later calculation of incomplete records, his record stands at 530 wins in 1,538 rides, which still makes his win rate 34%.

In 1955, he was inducted into the Jockey&#x27;s Hall of Fame at Saratoga, New York. In 1940, Murphy was honored with one of the 33 dioramas featured at the American Negro Exposition in Chicago. Since 1995, the National Turf Writers Association has given the Isaac Murphy Award to the jockey with the highest winning percentage for the year in North American racing (from a minimum of 500 mounts).

<doc id="710166" wikidata="Q2914540" url="?curid=710166" title="Cognitive distortion">
<text>A cognitive distortion is a thought that causes a person to perceive reality inaccurately due to being exaggerated or irrational. Cognitive distortions are involved in the onset or perpetuation of psychopathological states, such as depression and anxiety.

According to Aaron Beck&#x27;s cognitive model, a negative outlook on reality, sometimes called &quot;negative schemas&quot; (or &quot;schemata&quot;), is a factor in symptoms of emotional dysfunction and poorer subjective well-being. Specifically, negative thinking patterns reinforce negative emotions and thoughts. During difficult circumstances, these distorted thoughts can contribute to an overall negative outlook on the world and a depressive or anxious mental state. According to hopelessness theory and Beck&#x27;s theory, the meaning or interpretation that people give to their experience importantly influences whether they will become depressed and whether they will experience severe, repeated, or long-duration episodes of depression.

Challenging and changing cognitive distortions is a key element of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT).

==Definition==

Cognitive comes from the Medieval Latin , equivalent to Latin , &#x27;known&#x27;. Distortion means the act of twisting or altering something out of its true, natural, or original state.

== History ==
In 1957, American psychologist Albert Ellis, though he did not know it yet, would aid cognitive therapy in correcting cognitive distortions and indirectly helping David D. Burns in writing &quot;The Feeling Good Handbook&quot;. Ellis created what he called the ABC Technique of rational beliefs. The ABC stands for the activating event, beliefs that are irrational, and the consequences that come from the beliefs. Ellis wanted to prove that the activating event is not what caused the emotional behavior or the consequences, but the beliefs and how the person irrationally perceives the events which aid the consequences. With this model, Ellis attempted to use rational emotive behavior therapy (REBT) with his patients, in order to help them &quot;reframe&quot; or reinterpret the experience in a more rational manner. In this model, Ellis explains it all to his clients, while Beck helps his clients figure this out on their own. Beck first started to notice these automatic distorted thought processes when practicing psychoanalysis, while his patients followed the rule of saying anything that comes to mind. He realized that his patients had irrational fears, thoughts, and perceptions that were automatic. Beck began noticing his automatic thought processes that he knew his patients had but did not report. Most of the time the thoughts were biased against themselves and very erroneous.

Beck believed that the negative schemas developed and manifested themselves in the perspective and behavior. The distorted thought processes led to focusing on degrading the self, amplifying minor external setbacks, experiencing other&#x27;s harmless comments as ill-intended, while simultaneously seeing self as inferior. Inevitably cognitions are reflected in their behavior with a reduced desire to care for oneself, reduced desire to seek pleasure, and finally give up. These exaggerated perceptions, due to cognition, feel real and accurate because the schemas, after being reinforced through the behavior, tend to become &#x27;knee-jerk&#x27; automatic and do not allow time for reflection. This cycle is also known as Beck&#x27;s cognitive triad, focused on the theory that the person&#x27;s negative schema applied to the self, the future, and the environment.

In 1972, psychiatrist, psychoanalyst, and cognitive therapy scholar Aaron T. Beck published &quot;Depression: Causes and Treatment.&quot; He was dissatisfied with the conventional Freudian treatment of depression because there was no empirical evidence for the success of Freudian psychoanalysis. Beck&#x27;s book provided a comprehensive and empirically supported theoretical model for depression—its potential causes, symptoms, and treatments. In Chapter 2, titled &quot;Symptomatology of Depression&quot;, he described &quot;cognitive manifestations&quot; of depression, including low self-evaluation, negative expectations, self-blame and self-criticism, indecisiveness, and distortion of the body image.

Beck&#x27;s student David D. Burns continued research on the topic. In his book &quot;Feeling Good: The New Mood Therapy&quot;, Burns described personal and professional anecdotes related to cognitive distortions and their elimination. When Burns published &quot;Feeling Good: The New Mood Therapy&quot;, it made Beck&#x27;s approach to distorted thinking widely known and popularized. Burns sold over four million copies of the book in the United States alone. It was a book commonly &quot;prescribed&quot; for patients with cognitive distortions that have led to depression. Beck approved of the book, saying that it would help others alter their depressed moods by simplifying the extensive study and research that had taken place since shortly after Beck had started as a student and practitioner of psychoanalytic psychiatry. Nine years later, &quot;The Feeling Good Handbook&quot; was published, which was also built on Beck&#x27;s work and includes a list of ten specific cognitive distortions that will be discussed throughout this article.

== Main types ==
John C. Gibbs and Granville Bud Potter propose four categories for cognitive distortions: &quot;self-centered&quot;, &quot;blaming others&quot;, &quot;minimizing-mislabeling&quot;, and &quot;assuming the worst&quot;. The cognitive distortions listed below are categories of negative self-talk.

===All-or-nothing thinking===

The &quot;all-or-nothing thinking distortion&quot; is also referred to as &quot;splitting&quot;, &quot;black-and-white thinking&quot;, and &quot;polarized thinking.&quot; Someone with the all-or-nothing thinking distortion looks at life in black and white categories. Either they are a success or a failure; either they are good or bad; there is no in-between. According to one article, &quot;Because there is always someone who is willing to criticize, this tends to collapse into a tendency for polarized people to view themselves as a total failure. Polarized thinkers have difficulty with the notion of being &#x27;good enough&#x27; or a partial success.&quot;
* Example (from &quot;The Feeling Good Handbook&quot;): A woman eats a spoonful of ice cream. She thinks she is a complete failure for breaking her diet. She becomes so depressed that she ends up eating the whole quart of ice cream.
This example captures the polarized nature of this distortion—the person believes they are totally inadequate if they fall short of perfection. 
In order to combat this distortion, Burns suggests thinking of the world in terms of shades of gray. Rather than viewing herself as a complete failure for eating a spoonful of ice cream, the woman in the example could still recognize her overall effort to diet as at least a partial success.

This distortion is commonly found in perfectionists.

=== Jumping to conclusions ===

Reaching preliminary conclusions (usually negative) with little (if any) evidence. Three specific subtypes are identified:

==== Mind reading ====
Inferring a person&#x27;s possible or probable (usually negative) thoughts from their behaviour and nonverbal communication; taking precautions against the worst suspected case without asking the person.
* Example 1: A student assumes that the readers of their paper have already made up their minds concerning its topic, and, therefore, writing the paper is a pointless exercise.
* Example 2: Kevin assumes that because he sits alone at lunch, everyone else must think he is a loser. (This can encourage self-fulfilling prophecy; Kevin may not initiate social contact because of his fear that those around him already perceive him negatively).

==== Fortune-telling ====
Predicting outcomes (usually negative) of events.
* Example: A depressed person tells themselves they will never improve; they will continue to be depressed for their whole life.
One way to combat this distortion is to ask, &quot;If this is true, does it say more about me or them?&quot;

==== Labelling ====

Labelling occurs when someone overgeneralizes the characteristics of other people. Someone might use an unfavourable term to describe a complex person or event, such as assuming that a friend is upset with them due to a late reply to a text message, even though there could be various other reasons for the delay. It is a more extreme form of jumping-to-conclusions cognitive distortion where one presumes to know the thoughts, feelings, or intentions of others without any factual basis.

=== Emotional reasoning ===

In the emotional reasoning distortion, it is assumed that feelings expose the true nature of things and experience reality as a reflection of emotionally linked thoughts; something is believed true solely based on a feeling.
* Examples: &quot;I feel stupid, therefore I must be stupid&quot;. Feeling fear of flying in planes, and then concluding that planes must be a dangerous way to travel. Feeling overwhelmed by the prospect of cleaning one&#x27;s house, therefore concluding that it&#x27;s hopeless to even start cleaning.

=== Should/shouldn&#x27;t and must/mustn&#x27;t statements ===
Making &quot;must&quot; or &quot;should&quot; statements was included by Albert Ellis in his rational emotive behavior therapy (REBT), an early form of CBT; he termed it &quot;musturbation&quot;. Michael C. Graham called it &quot;expecting the world to be different than it is&quot;. It can be seen as demanding particular achievements or behaviors regardless of the realistic circumstances of the situation. 
* Example: After a performance, a concert pianist believes they should not have made so many mistakes.
* In &quot;Feeling Good: The New Mood Therapy&quot;, David Burns clearly distinguished between pathological &quot;should statements&quot;, moral imperatives, and social norms.
A related cognitive distortion, also present in Ellis&#x27; REBT, is a tendency to &quot;awfulize&quot;; to say a future scenario will be awful, rather than to realistically appraise the various negative and positive characteristics of that scenario.
According to Burns, &quot;must&quot; and &quot;should&quot; statements are negative because they cause the person to feel guilty and upset at themselves. Some people also direct this distortion at other people, which can cause feelings of anger and frustration when that other person does not do what they should have done. He also mentions how this type of thinking can lead to rebellious thoughts. In other words, trying to whip oneself into doing something with &quot;shoulds&quot; may cause one to desire just the opposite.

=== Gratitude traps ===

A gratitude trap is a type of cognitive distortion that typically arises from misunderstandings regarding the nature or practice of gratitude. The term can refer to one of two related but distinct thought patterns:

* A self-oriented thought process involving feelings of guilt, shame, or frustration related to one&#x27;s expectations of how things &quot;should&quot; be.
* An &quot;elusive ugliness in many relationships, a deceptive &#x27;kindness,&#x27; the main purpose of which is to make others feel indebted&quot;, as defined by psychologist Ellen Kenner.

===Personalization and blaming===
Personalization is assigning personal blame disproportionate to the level of control a person realistically has in a given situation. 
* Example 1: A foster child assumes that they have not been adopted because they are not &quot;loveable enough&quot;.
* Example 2: A child has bad grades. Their mother believes it is because they are not a good enough parent.
Blaming is the opposite of personalization. In the blaming distortion, the disproportionate level of blame is placed upon other people, rather than oneself. In this way, the person avoids taking personal responsibility, making way for a &quot;victim mentality&quot;. 
* Example: Placing blame for marital problems entirely on one&#x27;s spouse.

====Always being right====
In this cognitive distortion, being wrong is unthinkable. This distortion is characterized by actively trying to prove one&#x27;s actions or thoughts to be correct, and sometimes prioritizing self-interest over the feelings of another person. In this cognitive distortion, the facts that oneself has about their surroundings are always right while other people&#x27;s opinions and perspectives are wrongly seen.

====Fallacy of change====
Relying on social control to obtain cooperative actions from another person. The underlying assumption of this thinking style is that one&#x27;s happiness depends on the actions of others. The fallacy of change also assumes that other people should change to suit one&#x27;s own interests automatically, and/or that it is fair to pressure them to change. It may be present in most abusive relationships in which partners&#x27; &quot;visions&quot; of each other are tied into the belief that happiness, love, trust, and perfection would just occur once they or the other person change aspects of their beings.

===Minimizing-mislabeling===

==== Magnification and minimization ====

Giving proportionally greater weight to a perceived failure, weakness or threat, or lesser weight to a perceived success, strength or opportunity, so that the weight differs from that assigned by others, such as &quot;making a mountain out of a molehill&quot;. In depressed clients, often the positive characteristics of &quot;other people&quot; are exaggerated, and their negative characteristics are understated.

Catastrophizing is a form of magnification where one gives greater weight to the worst possible outcome, however unlikely, or experiences a situation as unbearable or impossible when it is just uncomfortable.

==== Labeling and mislabeling ====

A form of overgeneralization; attributing a person&#x27;s actions to their character instead of to an attribute. Rather than assuming the behaviour to be accidental or otherwise extrinsic, one assigns a label to someone or something that is based on the inferred character of that person or thing.

===Assuming the worst===

==== Overgeneralizing ====
Someone who overgeneralizes makes faulty generalizations from insufficient evidence. Such as seeing a &quot;single negative event&quot; as a &quot;never-ending pattern of defeat&quot;, and as such drawing a very broad conclusion from a single incident or a single piece of evidence. Even if something bad happens only once, it is expected to happen over and over again.
* Example 1: A person is asked out on a first date, but not a second one. They are distraught as tells a friend, &quot;This always happens to me! I&#x27;ll never find love!&quot;
* Example 2: A person is lonely and often spends most of their time at home. Friends sometimes ask them to dinner and to meet new people. They feel it is useless to even try. No one could really like them. And anyway, all people are the same: petty and selfish.
One suggestion to combat this distortion is to &quot;examine the evidence&quot; by performing an accurate analysis of one&#x27;s situation. This aids in avoiding exaggerating one&#x27;s circumstances.

==== Disqualifying the positive ====
Disqualifying the positive refers to rejecting positive experiences by insisting they &quot;don&#x27;t count&quot; for some reason or other. Negative belief is maintained despite contradiction by everyday experiences. Disqualifying the positive may be the most common fallacy in the cognitive distortion range; it is often analyzed with &quot;always being right&quot;, a type of distortion where a person is in an all-or-nothing self-judgment. People in this situation show signs of depression. Examples include:
*&quot;I will never be as good as Jane&quot;
*&quot;Anyone could have done as well&quot;
*&quot;They are just congratulating me to be nice&quot;

==== Mental filtering ====
Filtering distortions occur when an individual dwells only on the negative details of a situation and filters out the positive aspects.
* Example: Andy gets mostly compliments and positive feedback about a presentation he has done at work, but he also has received a small piece of criticism. For several days following his presentation, Andy dwells on this one negative reaction, forgetting all of the positive reactions that he had also been given.
&quot;The Feeling Good Handbook&quot; notes that filtering is like a &quot;drop of ink that discolors a beaker of water&quot;. One suggestion to combat filtering is a cost–benefit analysis. A person with this distortion may find it helpful to sit down and assess whether filtering out the positive and focusing on the negative is helping or hurting them in the long run.

==Conceptualization==
In a series of publications, philosopher Paul Franceschi has proposed a unified conceptual framework for cognitive distortions designed to clarify their relationships and define new ones. This conceptual framework is based on three notions: (i) the reference class (a set of phenomena or objects, e.g. events in the patient&#x27;s life); (ii) dualities (positive/negative, qualitative/quantitative, ...); (iii) the taxon system (degrees allowing to attribute properties according to a given duality to the elements of a reference class). In this model, &quot;dichotomous reasoning&quot;, &quot;minimization&quot;, &quot;maximization&quot; and &quot;arbitrary focus&quot; constitute general cognitive distortions (applying to any duality), whereas &quot;disqualification of the positive&quot; and &quot;catastrophism&quot; are specific cognitive distortions, applying to the positive/negative duality. This conceptual framework posits two additional cognitive distortion classifications: the &quot;omission of the neutral&quot; and the &quot;requalification in the other pole&quot;.

== Cognitive restructuring ==
Cognitive restructuring (CR) is a popular form of therapy used to identify and reject maladaptive cognitive distortions, and is typically used with individuals diagnosed with depression. In CR, the therapist and client first examine a stressful event or situation reported by the client. For example, a depressed male college student who experiences difficulty in dating might believe that his &quot;worthlessness&quot; causes women to reject him. Together, therapist and client might then create a more realistic cognition, e.g., &quot;It is within my control to ask girls on dates. However, even though there are some things I can do to influence their decisions, whether or not they say yes is largely out of my control. Thus, I am not responsible if they decline my invitation.&quot; CR therapies are designed to eliminate &quot;automatic thoughts&quot; that include clients&#x27; dysfunctional or negative views. According to Beck, doing so reduces feelings of worthlessness, anxiety, and anhedonia that are symptomatic of several forms of mental illness. CR is the main component of Beck&#x27;s and Burns&#x27;s CBT.

== Narcissistic defense ==

Those diagnosed with narcissistic personality disorder tend, unrealistically, to view themselves as superior, overemphasizing their strengths and understating their weaknesses. Narcissists use exaggeration and minimization this way to shield themselves against psychological pain.

== Decatastrophizing ==

In cognitive therapy, decatastrophizing or decatastrophization is a cognitive restructuring technique that may be used to treat cognitive distortions, such as magnification and catastrophizing, commonly seen in psychological disorders like anxiety and psychosis. Major features of these disorders are the subjective report of being overwhelmed by life circumstances and the incapability of affecting them.

== Criticism ==

Common criticisms of the diagnosis of cognitive distortion relate to epistemology and the theoretical basis. If the perceptions of the patient differ from those of the therapist, it may not be because of intellectual malfunctions, but because the patient has different experiences. In some cases, depressed subjects appear to be &quot;sadder but wiser&quot;.

<doc id="710168" wikidata="Q4031153" url="?curid=710168" title="Three-cent piece">
<text>The United States three cent piece was a unit of currency equaling of a United States dollar. The mint produced two different three-cent coins for circulation: the three-cent silver and the three-cent nickel. Additionally, a three-cent bronze coin was made as a pattern in 1863. During the period from 1865 to 1873, both coins were minted, albeit in very small quantities for the silver three-cent piece.

== History ==

The three-cent coin was proposed in 1851 both as a result of the decrease in postage rates from five cents to three and to answer the need for a small-denomination, easy-to-handle coin. The three-cent silver featured a shield on a six-sided star on the obverse and the Roman numeral III on the reverse. The coin was initially composed of 75% silver and 25% copper to ensure that the coin would be considered real currency yet not worth melting down for the silver. The coins were physically the lightest-weight coins ever minted by the United States, weighing only 0.8 grams and with a diameter smaller than a modern dime and only slightly greater than the smallest gold dollars. The silver coins were known as &quot;fishscales&quot;. The term &quot;trimes&quot; is often used today for these coins, and was first used by the director of the United States Mint (James Ross Snowden) at the time of their production.

Starting in 1854, the three-cent silver had its silver metal content raised to 90% to encourage circulation. At the same time, its weight was reduced to 0.75 grams by reducing thickness. The coin went through a design change at the time such that two lines were now used to border the star on the obverse and an olive sprig was added above and a bundle of arrows below the Roman numeral III on the reverse. A final design change occurred in 1859 because of striking problems: the number of lines bordering the star was reduced to one, and the font was made taller and slightly narrower. The size of the date numerals also varied through the years, with 1860–1863 featuring the smallest date numerals of any US coin. In 1851 only, the New Orleans Mint struck some of the silver three-cent coins. It was minted from 1851 to 1873 at the Philadelphia Mint. Later years had very small mintages and the 1873 issue was in proof state only, commanding prices upwards of $400. However, an earlier-date silver three-cent piece can be bought in worn condition for a relatively low price. The silver three-cent pieces can be purchased for around $25 if they are in decent shape and before 1862, depending on the mintage. The silver three-cent piece (along with the half dime, and the two-cent piece as well as the temporary suspension of the standard silver dollar in favor of the Trade Dollar) was discontinued by the Coinage Act of 1873.

Civil War-era silver shortages led to widespread hoarding of all silver coins, and most one- and five-cent coins, as well. Various alternatives were tried, including encapsulated postage and privately issued coinage. The Treasury eventually settled on issuing fractional currency. These small denomination (3 to 50 cent) notes were never popular, as they were easy to lose and unwieldy in large amounts. The answer to this issue was reached in 1865 with the introduction of the three-cent nickel coin, composed of copper and nickel and larger than the silver coin of the same denomination. The coin featured a Liberty head obverse and another Roman numeral III reverse. The three-cent nickel was never intended as a permanent issue, only as a stopgap measure until the wartime hoarding ceased. Production began to taper off in the 1870s (except for an anomalously large coinage in 1881), but mintage of the denomination did not finally end until 1889. One reason often given for the discontinuation of the three-cent nickel piece in 1889 is that this coin and the dime (10-cent silver coin) were identical in diameter. Another factor may have been that in 1883, the letter postage rate dropped to 2 cents, thus removing the justification for this coin.

The three-cent nickel was only minted in Philadelphia, and except for a larger date on the 1889 pieces, had no design differences throughout its run. Over the course of the series, mintage declined, and some of the dates are scarce, but with an 1865 mintage over 11 million, a type piece can be inexpensively obtained.

=== Glass coins ===
There was some discussion of minting a glass 3-cent coin to relieve the demand on copper during World War II.
It is possible other denomination glass coins were being considered as well.

<text>A bridge circuit is a topology of electrical circuitry in which two circuit branches (usually in parallel with each other) are &quot;bridged&quot; by a third branch connected between the first two branches at some intermediate point along them. The bridge was originally developed for laboratory measurement purposes and one of the intermediate bridging points is often adjustable when so used. Bridge circuits now find many applications, both linear and non-linear, including in instrumentation, filtering and power conversion.

The best-known bridge circuit, the Wheatstone bridge, was invented by Samuel Hunter Christie and popularized by Charles Wheatstone, and is used for measuring resistance. It is constructed from four resistors, two of known values &quot;R&quot;1 and &quot;R&quot;3 (see diagram), one whose resistance is to be determined &quot;R&quot;x, and one which is variable and calibrated &quot;R&quot;2. Two opposite vertices are connected to a source of electric current, such as a battery, and a galvanometer is connected across the other two vertices. The variable resistor is adjusted until the galvanometer reads zero. It is then known that the ratio between the variable resistor and its neighbour R1 is equal to the ratio between the unknown resistor and its neighbour R3, which enables the value of the unknown resistor to be calculated.

The Wheatstone bridge has also been generalised to measure impedance in AC circuits, and to measure resistance, inductance, capacitance, and dissipation factor separately. Variants are known as the Wien bridge, Maxwell bridge, and Heaviside bridge (used to measure the effect of mutual inductance). All are based on the same principle, which is to compare the output of two potential dividers sharing a common source.

In power supply design, a bridge circuit or bridge rectifier is an arrangement of diodes or similar devices used to rectify an electric current, i.e. to convert it from an unknown or alternating polarity to a direct current of known polarity.

In some motor controllers, an H-bridge is used to control the direction the motor turns.

==Bridge current equation==

From the figure to the right, the bridge current is represented as &quot;I&quot;5

Per Thévenin&#x27;s theorem, finding the Thévenin equivalent circuit which is connected to the bridge load &quot;R&quot;5 and using the arbitrary current flow &quot;I&quot;5, we have:

Thevenin Source (&quot;V&quot;th) is given by the formula:

formula_1

and the Thevenin resistance (&quot;R&quot;th):

formula_2

Therefore, the current flow (&quot;I&quot;5) through the bridge is given by Ohm&#x27;s law:

formula_3

and the voltage (&quot;V&quot;5) across the load (&quot;R&quot;5) is given by the voltage divider formula:

formula_4

<text>Franklin Buchanan (September 17, 1800 – May 11, 1874) was an officer in the United States Navy who became the only full admiral in the Confederate Navy during the American Civil War. He also commanded the ironclad CSS &quot;Virginia&quot;.

== Early life ==
Franklin Buchanan was born in Baltimore, Maryland, on September 13, 1800. He was the fifth child and third son of a physician, George Buchanan, and Laetitia McKean Buchanan. The Buchanan side of his family arrived in the United States from Scotland. His paternal grandfather was a general with the Maryland Militia during the Revolutionary War while his maternal grandfather Thomas McKean was one of the signers of the Declaration of Independence.
He joined the U.S. Navy on January 28, 1815, and became a midshipman; he was promoted to lieutenant on January 13, 1825, commander on September 8, 1841, and then captain on September 14, 1855.

On February 19, 1835, at Annapolis, Maryland, he married Ann Catherine Lloyd. They had nine children: eight daughters and a son.

== U.S. Navy ==
During the 45 years he served in the U.S. Navy, Buchanan had extensive and worldwide sea duty. He commanded the sloops of war and during the 1840s and the steam frigate in the Perry Expedition to Japan from 1852 to 1854. In 1845, at the request of the U.S. Secretary of the Navy, he submitted plans to his superiors proposing a naval school which would lead to the creation of the United States Naval Academy that very year; for his efforts, he was appointed the first superintendent of the Naval School—its first name—where he served in 1845–1847. This assignment was followed by notable Mexican–American War service in 1847–1848. From 1859 to 1861, Buchanan was the commandant of the Washington Navy Yard.

With the Civil War upon him, he resigned his commission on April 22, 1861, expecting his home state of Maryland to eventually secede. When that did not happen, he tried to recall his resignation, but U.S. Secretary of the Navy, Gideon Welles said he did not want traitors or half-hearted patriots in his navy and refused to reinstate him. Thus in May 1861 he was out of the U.S. Navy.

== Civil War ==

On September 5, 1861, Franklin Buchanan joined the Confederate Navy and was given a captain&#x27;s commission. On February 24, 1862, the Confederate States Secretary of the Navy, Stephen Mallory, appointed Buchanan to the office of Confederate Navy James River Squadron Flag Officer and he then selected the newly built ironclad to be his flagship.

Buchanan was the captain of CSS &quot;Virginia&quot; (formerly ) during the Battle of Hampton Roads in Virginia. He climbed to the top deck of &quot;Virginia&quot; and began furiously firing toward shore with a carbine as was shelled. He soon was brought down by a sharpshooter&#x27;s minie ball to the thigh. He would eventually recover from his leg wound. He did not get to command &quot;Virginia&quot; against . That honor went to Catesby ap Roger Jones.
In August 1862, Buchanan was promoted to the rank of full admiral – the only officer so honored in the Confederate Navy – and was sent to take command of Confederate naval forces stationed at Mobile Bay, Alabama. He oversaw the construction of the ironclad , of which the keel was laid in October 1862. He was on board &quot;Tennessee&quot; during the Battle of Mobile Bay with Rear Admiral David Glasgow Farragut&#x27;s Union fleet on August 5, 1864. Wounded and taken prisoner, Buchanan was not exchanged until February 1865.

== Later life ==
Following the conflict, Buchanan lived in Maryland and in Mobile, Alabama, until 1870, when he again took up residence in Maryland. He died there on May 11, 1874. He is buried at the Wye House family plot outside Easton, Maryland.

== Legacy ==
Three U.S. Navy destroyers have been named &quot;Buchanan&quot; in honor of Confederate Admiral Franklin Buchanan: (), (), and (). The superintendent&#x27;s quarters at the United States Naval Academy is named the Buchanan House and a street on the Academy grounds is named Buchanan Road. However, in 2023, a naming commission created by federal law to reexamine Confederate-related names and symbols on military installations recommended that Buchanan House and Buchanan Road be renamed. On May 1, 2023, it was announced the Superintendent&#x27;s quarters will be renamed Farragut House to honor Admiral David Glasgow Farragut.

<text>Punta rock, or Belizean punta, is a form of Garifuna music originating in Belize and created by Pen Cayetano. Songs are usually sung in Belizean Kriol or Garifuna and rarely in Spanish or English. Many Garifuna American artists and bands perform the genre as well.

==Origins==
Punta rock is a subgenre of punta that was created by Pen Cayetano in Belize in 1978. Punta is a style of traditional music and dance that developed among the Garifuna people of Saint Vincent, Honduras, Belize, Guatemala, and Nicaragua.

While this style is unique, calypso and soca have had some influence on it. Like calypso and soca, punta rock was used for both social commentary and risqué humor, though the initial wave of punta acts eschewed the former. Punta rock is played at parties, celebrations, parks, and other outdoor locations. Lord Rhaburn and the Cross Culture Band were integral in the acceptance of punta by Belizeans (namely Kriols) through their performance of calypso songs about punta.

<doc id="710181" wikidata="Q7958719" url="?curid=710181" title="Wacaday">
<text>Wacaday is a children&#x27;s television series in the United Kingdom that ran in TV-am&#x27;s school-holidays slot from October 1985 until 1992, in an 8:50-9:25 a.m. slot, and was hosted by Timmy Mallett.

== History ==
&quot;Wacaday&quot; was introduced when Roland Rat, the puppet host of TV-am&#x27;s previous weekday morning slot during school holidays, transferred to the BBC. With only a week until October half term was due to start, it was decided to produce a spin-off of the existing and successful Saturday morning programme, &quot;Wide Awake Club&quot;. Timmy Mallett, the best-known presenter of &quot;Wide Awake Club&quot;, was chosen to front the new show. The &quot;wac&quot; of the title took the initials of &quot;Wide Awake Club&quot;.

The show was devised and produced by Nick Wilson and first broadcast on 21 October 1985. The initial 1985 run consisted of basic features and competitions, but from its second run in 1986, the format quickly began to develop, with Mallett&#x27;s Mallet being introduced. Michaela Strachan co-presented the show with Timmy during the summers of from 1987 until 1989.

==Overview ==
The programme was similar in style to &quot;Wide Awake Club&quot;, which was also broadcast live and featured items such as the word-association games &#x27;Bonk’n’Boob&#x27; and &#x27;Mallett&#x27;s Mallet&#x27; as well as &#x27;Drop Your Toast&#x27;, where Timmy would read out a viewer&#x27;s name in the hope that they would be so shocked that they would drop their toast. From 1987, every series (there were six a year - one for each school holiday) would be themed around a different country that Timmy had visited. Pre-recorded reports from these countries would educate viewers about the country&#x27;s culture, customs and history (though in a humorous way, including Timmy often acting out famous scenes from that country&#x27;s past). In later series, the studio set was also decorated in the particular country&#x27;s theme.

Other regular features included a narrated story about the adventures of Magic, Timmy&#x27;s cockatiel, various phone-in quizzes (typically at the end of the programme) where a selected viewer would compete in some gunge-related competition, and a short five-minute cartoon, such as &quot;Transformers&quot;, &quot;Galaxy High School&quot;, &quot;Batfink&quot;, &quot;Challenge of the GoBots&quot; or &quot;Dick Tracy&quot;. Although some minor items appeared and were retired over the years, the overall structure of the series remained the same throughout the show&#x27;s life.

The self-proclaimed &#x27;show your telly was made for&#x27; eventually became even more successful than &quot;Wide Awake Club&quot; and is the programme for which Mallett is probably best remembered. In fact, many of Timmy&#x27;s trademarks, such as his giant pink mallet Pinky Punky (introduced in 1990) and Timmy&#x27;s &#x27;bleugh!&#x27; catchphrase originated on &quot;Wacaday&quot;. The &quot;bleugh&quot; saying actually originated from the rules of Mallet&#x27;s Mallet, where Timmy would hurriedly repeat the rules every day. On one occasion early in the feature&#x27;s life, he fluffed the lines and came out with &quot;bleugh&quot; - and from there, the catchphrase was born.

Pinky Punky is a soft plush hammer with a yellow handle, pink head with glasses, and yellow &quot;punk&quot; hairstyle. Pinky was famous for his catchphrase: &quot;Mr Mallett! Mr Mallett! Can I go to the toilet?&quot; A Pinky Punky can be seen in the Herbert Art Gallery and Museum in Coventry, after he was donated by Mallett.

Later on in &quot;Wacaday&quot;″s run, Mallett&#x27;s infamous routine of hitting people over the head with his giant foam mallet was changed slightly, particularly in the &quot;Mallett&#x27;s Mallet&quot; game, where he would instead hit large buttons on a machine to keep score, as the producers feared that young viewers at home might try and copy the routine by hitting people over the head with heavy objects.

The programme outlived its parent by two years, but ended in 1992 when TV-am lost its franchise.

==Other==

The 2007 debut release by British trio Scouting For Girls contains a tribute to Michaela Strachan and &quot;Wacaday&quot; in a hidden track 11. In the printed lyrics on many websites &quot;Wacaday&quot; is incorrectly written as &quot;Why Good Day&quot;.

Magic, the cockatiel in the show, is buried in Timmy Mallett&#x27;s garden.

<text>The list of rivers of the [[Great Basin]] identifies waterways named as rivers, regardless of the amount of their flow.

==Significant rivers==

The Great Basin is a series of contiguous watersheds, bounded on the west by watersheds of the Sacramento-San Joaquin and Klamath rivers, on the north by the watershed of the Columbia-Snake, and on the south and east by the watershed of the Colorado-Green rivers. The following are some of the most significant rivers in the Great Basin, most of which are in the states of Utah and Nevada. While the longest rivers in the Great Basin are the Bear River (350 miles), Sevier River (385 miles), and Humbolt Rivers (290 miles). The meandering nature of the Humbolt River may make it as long as 390 miles.

The Aterian is a Middle Stone Age (or Middle Palaeolithic) stone tool industry centered in North Africa, from Mauritania to Egypt, but also possibly found in Oman and the Thar Desert. The earliest Aterian dates to c. 150,000 years ago, at the site of Ifri n&#x27;Ammar in Morocco. However, most of the early dates cluster around the beginning of the Last Interglacial, around 150,000 to 130,000 years ago, when the environment of North Africa began to ameliorate. The Aterian disappeared around 20,000 years ago.

The Aterian is primarily distinguished through the presence of tanged or pedunculated tools, and is named after the type site of Bir el Ater, south of Tébessa. Bifacially-worked, leaf-shaped tools are also a common artefact type in Aterian assemblages, and so are racloirs and Levallois flakes and cores. Items of personal adornment (pierced and ochred Nassarius shell beads) are known from at least one Aterian site, with an age of 82,000 years. The Aterian is one of the oldest examples of regional technological diversification, evidencing significant differentiation to older stone tool industries in the area, frequently described as Mousterian. The appropriateness of the term Mousterian is contested in a North African context, however.

== Origin ==

Fleming et al. (2013) stated:

But Scerri (2012) also reckoned that the (Aterian) peoples were ultimately of sub-Saharan origin, or as we have proposed, they dispersed from Ethiopia by way of the Sahel and Lake Chad and the (interglacial) Saharan wet spots.

== Description ==

The technological character of the Aterian has been debated for almost a century, but has until recently eluded definition. The problems defining the industry have related to its research history and the fact that a number of similarities have been observed between the Aterian and other North African stone tool industries of the same date. Levallois reduction is widespread across the whole of North Africa throughout the Middle Stone Age, and scrapers and denticulates are ubiquitous. Bifacial foliates moreover represent a huge taxonomic category and the form and dimension of such foliates associated with tanged tools is extremely varied. There is also a significant variation of tanged tools themselves, with various forms representing both different tool types (e.g., knives, scrapers, points) and the degree tool resharpening.
More recently, a large-scale study of North African stone tool assemblages, including Aterian assemblages, indicated that the traditional concept of stone tool industries is problematic in the North African Middle Stone Age. Although the term Aterian defines Middle Stone Age assemblages from North Africa with tanged tools, the concept of an Aterian industry obfuscates other similarities between tanged tool assemblages and other non-Aterian North African assemblages of the same date. For example, bifacial leaf points are found widely across North Africa in assemblages that lack tanged tools and Levallois flakes and cores are near ubiquitous. Instead of elaborating discrete industries, the findings of the comparative study suggest that North Africa during the Last Interglacial comprised a network of related technologies whose similarities and differences correlated with geographical distance and the palaeohydrology of a Green Sahara. Assemblages with tanged tools may therefore reflect particular activities involving the use of such tool types, and may not necessarily reflect a substantively different archaeological culture to others from the same period in North Africa. The findings are significant because they suggest that current archaeological nomenclatures do not reflect the true variability of the archaeological record of North Africa during the Middle Stone Age from the Last Interglacial, and hints at how early modern humans dispersed into previously uninhabitable environments. This notwithstanding, the term still usefully denotes the presence of tanged tools in North African Middle Stone Age assemblages.

Tanged tools persisted in North Africa until around 20,000 years ago, with the youngest sites located in Northwest Africa. By this time, the Aterian lithic industry had long ceased to exist in the rest of North Africa due to the onset of the Ice Age, which in North Africa, resulted in hyperarid conditions. Assemblages with tanged tools, &#x27;the Aterian&#x27;, therefore have a significant temporal and spatial range. However, the exact geographical distribution of this lithic industry is uncertain. The Aterian&#x27;s spatial range is thought to have existed in North Africa up to the Nile Valley Possible Aterian lithic tools have also been discovered in Middle Paleolithic deposits in Oman and the Thar Desert. 

Most engraved Bubaline rock art appear in the northern region of Tassili, at Wadi Djerat. Levallois instruments in the area may indicate that Bubaline rock art was developed by Aterians.

In the Sahara, Aterians camped near lakes, rivers, and springs, and engaged in the activity of hunting (e.g., antelope, buffalo, elephant, rhinoceros) and some gathering. As a result of a hyper-aridification event of Saharan Africa, which occurred around the time of Europe&#x27;s Würm glaciation event, Aterian hunter-gatherers may have migrated into areas of tropical Africa and coastal Africa. More specifically, amid aridification in MIS 5 and regional change of climate in MIS 4, in the Sahara and the Sahel, Aterians may have migrated southward into West Africa (e.g., Baie du Levrier, Mauritania; Tiemassas, Senegal; Lower Senegal River Valley).

== Associated behaviour ==

The Aterian is associated with early &quot;Homo sapiens&quot; at a number of sites in Morocco. While the Jebel Irhoud specimens were originally noted to have been similar to later Aterian and some Iberomaurusian specimens, further examinations revealed that the Jebel Irhoud specimens are similar to them in some respects but differ in that the Jebel Irhoud specimens have a continuous supraorbital torus while the Aterian and Iberomaurasian specimens have a discontinuous supraorbital torus or in some cases, none at all, and from this, it was concluded that the Jebel Irhoud specimens represent archaic &quot;Homo sapiens&quot; while the Aterian and Iberomaurusian specimens represent anatomically modern &quot;Homo sapiens&quot;. The &#x27;Aterian&#x27; fossils also display morphological similarities with the early out of Africa modern humans found at Skhul and Qafzeh in the Levant, and they are broadly contemporary to them. Apart from producing a highly distinctive and sophisticated stone tool technology, these early North African populations also seem to have engaged with symbolically constituted material culture, creating what are amongst the earliest African examples of personal ornamentation. Such examples of shell &#x27;beads&#x27; have been found far inland, suggesting the presence of long distance social networks.

Studies of the variation and distribution of the Aterian have also now suggested that associated populations lived in subdivided populations, perhaps living most of their lives in relative isolation and aggregating at particular times to reinforce social ties. Such a subdivided population structure has also been inferred from the pattern of variation observed in early African fossils of &quot;Homo sapiens&quot;.

Associated faunal studies suggest that the people making the Aterian exploited coastal resources as well as engaging in hunting. As the points are small and lightweight, it is likely that they were not hand-delivered but instead thrown. There is no evidence that a spear thrower was used, but the points have characteristics similar to atlatl dart points. It has so far been difficult to estimate whether Aterian populations further inland were exploiting freshwater resources as well. Studies have suggested that hafting was widespread, perhaps to maintain flexibility in the face of strongly seasonal environment with a pronounced dry season. Scrapers, knives and points all seem to have been hafted, suggesting a wide range of activities were facilitated by technological advances. It is probable that plant resources were also exploited. Although there is no direct evidence from the Aterian yet, plant processing is evidenced in North Africa from as much as 182,000 years ago. In 2012, a 90,000-year-old bone knife was discovered in the Dar es-Soltan I cave, which is basically made of a cattle-sized animal&#x27;s rib.

==Associated language==

Due to the archaeological spread of the Aterian culture and unique linguistic spread of the Niger-Congo languages (e.g., languages of the Atlantic coast in Senegal, Kordofan in Sudan), Fleming et al. (2013) indicates that possibly the “Nilo-Saharan linguistic phylum is derived from the Aterian culture area.”

<doc id="710195" wikidata="Q915712" url="?curid=710195" title="Surfin' U.S.A. (album)">
<text>Surfin&#x27; U.S.A. is the second studio album by the American rock band the Beach Boys, released March 25, 1963 on Capitol Records. It reached number 2 in the US during a chart stay of 78 weeks, eventually being certified gold by the RIAA, and brought the group newfound national success. It was led by one single, its title track with the B-side &quot;Shut Down&quot;. In the UK, the album was released in late 1965 and reached number 17.

The majority of the album&#x27;s recording commenced in the first week of 1963, three months after the release of &quot;Surfin&#x27; Safari&quot;. Like the group&#x27;s debut album, production was credited ostensibly to Capitol&#x27;s representative for Artists and Repertoire, Nick Venet, although bandleader Brian Wilson was heavily involved in the album&#x27;s composition. The album marks the beginning of his practice to doubletrack vocals, resulting in a fuller sound.

== Background ==
In 1990, Brian Wilson reflected on &quot;Surfin&#x27; U.S.A.&quot; in liner notes which accompanied its first CD issue:

==Reception==

In a retrospective review, Richie Unterberger wrote: &quot;The album as a whole is the best they would make, prior to the late &#x27;60s, as a band that played most of their instruments, rather than as a vehicle for Brian Wilson&#x27;s ideas. The LP was a huge hit, vital to launching surf music as a national craze, and one of the few truly strong records to be recorded by a self-contained American rock band prior to the British Invasion.&quot; Author Luis Sanchez summarized the album&#x27;s impact on culture and the image it established for the Beach Boys:

==Track listing==

Notes
* Mike Love was not originally credited for any of the tracks on the album. His credits for &quot;Farmer&#x27;s Daughter&quot;, &quot;Noble Surfer&quot;, and &quot;Finders Keepers&quot; were awarded after a 1994 court case.
* Some later reissues of the album omit &quot;Stoked&quot; and &quot;Surf Jam&quot;.

<doc id="710197" wikidata="Q10714" url="?curid=710197" title="At sign">
<text>The at sign, , is an accounting and invoice abbreviation meaning &quot;at a rate of&quot; (e.g. 7 widgets @ £2 per widget = £14), now seen more widely in email addresses and social media platform handles. It is normally read aloud as &quot;at&quot; and is also commonly called the at symbol, commercial at, or address sign.

The absence of a single English word for the symbol has prompted some writers to use the French &quot;arobase&quot;, Occitan &quot;arròba&quot; and Aragonese, Catalan, Portuguese and Spanish &quot;arroba&quot;, or to coin new words such as &quot;ampersat&quot; and &quot;asperand&quot;, or the (visual) onomatopoeia &quot;strudel&quot;, but none of these have achieved wide use.

Although not included on the keyboard of the earliest commercially successful typewriters, it was on at least one 1889 model and the very successful Underwood models from the &quot;Underwood No. 5&quot; in 1900 onward. It started to be used in email addresses in the 1970s, and is now routinely included on most types of computer keyboards.

==History==

The earliest yet discovered symbol in this shape is found in a Bulgarian translation of a Greek chronicle written by Constantinos Manasses in 1345. Held today in the Vatican Apostolic Library, it features the @ symbol in place of the capital letter alpha &quot;Α&quot; as an initial in the word Amen; however, the reason behind it being used in this context is still unknown. The evolution of the symbol as used today is not recorded.

It has long been used in Catalan, Spanish and Portuguese as an abbreviation of &quot;arroba&quot;, a unit of weight equivalent to 25 pounds, and derived from the Arabic expression of &quot;the quarter&quot; ( pronounced &quot;ar-rubʿ&quot;). A symbol resembling an @ is found in the Spanish &quot;Taula de Ariza&quot;, a registry to denote a wheat shipment from Castile to Aragon, in 1448. The historian Giorgio Stabile claims to have traced the @ symbol to the 16th century, in a mercantile document sent by Florentine Francesco Lapi from Seville to Rome on May 4, 1536. The document is about commerce with Pizarro, in particular the price of an @ of wine in Peru. Currently, the word &quot;arroba&quot; means both the at-symbol and a unit of weight. In Venetian, the symbol was interpreted to mean amphora (), a unit of weight and volume based upon the capacity of the standard amphora jar since the 6th century. It could also mean “adi” (standard Italian “addì”, i. e. ‘on the day of’) as used on a health pass in Northern Italy in 1667.

==Modern use==

===Commercial usage===
In contemporary English usage, @ is a commercial symbol, meaning &quot;at&quot; and &quot;at the rate of&quot; or &quot;at the price of&quot;. It has rarely been used in financial ledgers, and is not used in standard typography.

===Trademark===
In 2012, &quot;@&quot; was registered as a trademark with the German Patent and Trade Mark Office. A cancellation request was filed in 2013, and the cancellation was ultimately confirmed by the German Federal Patent Court in 2017.

===Email addresses===
A common contemporary use of @ is in email addresses (using the SMTP system), as in codice_1 (the user codice_2 located &quot;at&quot; the domain codice_3). Ray Tomlinson of BBN Technologies is credited for having introduced this usage in 1971. This idea of the symbol representing &quot;located at&quot; in the form codice_4 is also seen in other tools and protocols; for example, the Unix shell command codice_5 tries to establish an ssh connection to the computer with the hostname codice_6 using the username codice_2.

On web pages, organizations often obscure the email addresses of their members or employees by omitting the @. This practice, known as address munging, attempts to make the email addresses less vulnerable to spam programs that scan the internet for them.

===Social media===
On some social media platforms and forums, usernames may be prefixed with an @ (in the form codice_8); this type of username is frequently referred to as a &quot;handle&quot;.

On online forums without threaded discussions, @ is commonly used to denote a reply; for instance: codice_9 to respond to a comment Jane made earlier. Similarly, in some cases, @ is used for &quot;attention&quot; in email messages originally sent to someone else. For example, if an email was sent from Catherine to Steve, but in the body of the email, Catherine wants to make Keirsten aware of something, Catherine will start the line to indicate to Keirsten that the following sentence concerns her. This also helps with mobile email users who might not see bold or color in email.

In microblogging (such as on Twitter, GNU social- and ActivityPub-based microblogs), an @ before the user name is used to send publicly readable replies (e.g. codice_10). The blog and client software can automatically interpret these as links to the user in question. When included as part of a person&#x27;s or company&#x27;s contact details, an @ symbol followed by a name is normally understood to refer to a Twitter handle. A similar use of the @ symbol was also made available to Facebook users on September 15, 2009. In Internet Relay Chat (IRC), it is shown before users&#x27; nicknames to denote they have operator status on a channel.

===Sports usage===

In American English the @ can be used to add information about a sporting event. Where opposing sports teams have their names separated by a &quot;v&quot; (for ), the away team can be written first – and the normal &quot;v&quot; replaced with @ to convey at which team&#x27;s home field the game will be played. This usage is not followed in British English, since conventionally the home team is written first.

===Computer languages===
@ is used in various programming languages and other computer languages, although there is not a consistent theme to its usage. For example:
* In ActionScript, @ is used in XML parsing and traversal as a string prefix to identify attributes in contrast to child elements.
* In Ada 2022, @ is the &quot;target name&quot; symbol, an abbreviation of the LHS of an assignment; it is used to avoid repetition of potentially long names in assignment statements. For example: codice_11 is shortened to codice_12, increasing readability.
* In ALGOL 68, the @ symbol is &quot;brief form&quot; of the at keyword; it is used to change the lower bound of an array. For example: refers to an array starting at index 88.
* In Dyalog APL, @ is used as a functional way to modify or replace data at specific locations in an array.
* In the ASP.NET MVC Razor template markup syntax, the @ character denotes the start of code statement blocks or the start of text content.
* In Assembly language, @ is sometimes used as a dereference operator.
* In CSS, @ is used in special statements outside of a CSS block.
* In C#, it denotes &quot;verbatim strings&quot;, where no characters are escaped and two double-quote characters represent a single double-quote. As a prefix it also allows keywords to be used as identifiers, a form of stropping.
* In D, it denotes function attributes: like: codice_13, codice_14, user defined codice_15 which can be evaluated at compile time (with codice_16) or codice_17 to declare properties, which are functions that can be syntactically treated as if they were fields or variables.
* In DIGITAL Command Language, the @ character was the command used to execute a command procedure. To run the command procedure VMSINSTAL.COM, one would type codice_18 at the command prompt.
* In the Domain Name System (DNS), @ is used to represent the , typically the &quot;root&quot; of the domain without a prefixed sub-domain. (Ex: wikipedia.org vs. www.wikipedia.org)
* In Forth, it is used to fetch values from the address on the top of the stack. The operator is pronounced as &quot;fetch&quot;.
* In Haskell, it is used in so-called &quot;as-patterns&quot;. This notation can be used to give aliases to patterns, making them more readable.
* in HTML, it can be encoded as codice_19
* In J, denotes function composition.
* In Java, it has been used to denote annotations, a kind of metadata, since version 5.0.
* In Julia, it denotes the invocation of a macro.
* In LiveCode, it is prefixed to a parameter to indicate that the parameter is passed by reference.
* In an LXDE autostart file (as used, for example, on the Raspberry Pi computer), @ is prefixed to a command to indicate that the command should be automatically re-executed if it crashes.
* In a Makefile, @ specifies to not output the command before it is executed.
* In ML, it denotes list concatenation.
* In modal logic, specifically when representing possible worlds, @ is sometimes used as a logical symbol to denote the actual world (the world we are &quot;at&quot;).
* In Objective-C, @ is prefixed to language-specific keywords such as @implementation and to form string literals.
* In InterSystems ObjectScript, @ is the indirection operator, enabling dynamic runtime substitution of part or all of a command line, a command, or a command argument.
* In Pascal, @ is the &quot;address of&quot; operator (it tells the location at which a variable is found).
* In Perl, @ prefixes variables which contain arrays , including array slices and hash slices or . This use is known as a &quot;sigil.&quot;
* In PHP, it is used just before an expression to make the interpreter suppress errors that would be generated from that expression.
* In Python 2.4 and up, it is used to decorate a function (wrap the function in another one at creation time). In Python 3.5 and up, it is also used as an overloadable matrix multiplication operator.
*In R and S-PLUS, it is used to extract slots from S4 objects.
*In Razor, it is used for C# code blocks.
* In Ruby, it functions as a sigil: codice_20 prefixes instance variables, and codice_21 prefixes class variables.
* In Rust, it is used to bind values matched by a pattern to a variable.
* In Scala, it is used to denote annotations (as in Java), and also to bind names to subpatterns in pattern-matching expressions.
* In Swift, codice_20 prefixes &quot;annotations&quot; that can be applied to classes or members. Annotations tell the compiler to apply special semantics to the declaration like keywords, without adding keywords to the language.
* In T-SQL, codice_20 prefixes variables and codice_21 prefixes &quot;niladic&quot; system functions.
* In several xBase-type programming languages, like DBASE, FoxPro/Visual FoxPro and Clipper, it is used to denote position on the screen. For example: to show the word &quot;HELLO&quot; in line 1, column 1.
** In FoxPro/Visual FoxPro, it is also used to indicate explicit pass by reference of variables when calling procedures or functions (but it is not an address operator).
* In a Windows Batch file, an codice_20 at the start of a line suppresses the echoing of that command. In other words, is the same as codice_26 applied to the current line only. Normally a Windows command is executed and takes effect from the next line onward, but codice_20 is a rare example of a command that takes effect immediately. It is most commonly used in the form which not only switches off echoing but prevents the command line itself from being echoed.
* In Windows PowerShell, @ is used as array operator for array and hash table literals and for enclosing here-string literals.

===Gender neutrality in Spanish ===

In Spanish, where many words end in &quot;-o&quot; when in the masculine gender and end &quot;-a&quot; in the feminine, @ is sometimes used as a gender-neutral substitute for the default &quot;o&quot; ending. For example, the word &quot;amigos&quot; traditionally represents not only male friends, but also a mixed group, or where the genders are not known. The proponents of gender-inclusive language would replace it with &quot;amig@s&quot; in these latter two cases, and use &quot;amigos&quot; only when the group referred to is all-male and &quot;amigas&quot; only when the group is all female. The Real Academia Española disapproves of this usage.

===Other uses and meanings===

* In (especially English) scientific and technical literature, @ is used to describe the conditions under which data are valid or a measurement has been made. E.g. the density of saltwater may read &quot;d&quot; = 1.050 g/cm3 @ 15 °C (read &quot;at&quot; for @), density of a gas &quot;d&quot; = 0.150 g/L @ 20 °C, 1 bar, or noise of a car 81 dB @ 80 km/h (speed).
*In philosophical logic, &#x27;@&#x27; is used to denote the actual world (in contrast to non-actual possible worlds). Analogously, a &#x27;designated&#x27; world in a Kripke model may be labelled &#x27;@&#x27;.
* In chemical formulae, @ is used to denote trapped atoms or molecules. For instance, La@C60 means lanthanum inside a fullerene cage. See article Endohedral fullerene for details.
* In Malagasy, @ is an informal abbreviation for the prepositional form &quot;amin&#x27;ny&quot;.
* In Malay, @ is an informal abbreviation for the word &quot;atau&quot;, meaning &quot;or&quot; in English.
* In genetics, @ is the abbreviation for locus, as in IGL@ for &quot;immunoglobulin lambda locus&quot;.
* In the Koalib language of Sudan, @ is used as a letter in Arabic loanwords. The Unicode Consortium rejected a proposal to encode it separately as a letter in Unicode. SIL International uses Private Use Area code points U+F247 and U+F248 for lowercase and capital versions, although they have marked this PUA representation as deprecated since September 2014.
* A schwa, as the actual schwa character &quot;ə&quot; may be difficult to produce on many computers. It is used in this capacity in some ASCII IPA schemes, including SAMPA and X-SAMPA.
* In leet it may substitute for the letter &quot;A&quot;.
* It is frequently used in typing and text messaging as an abbreviation for &quot;at&quot;.
* In Portugal it may be used in typing and text messaging with the meaning &quot;french kiss&quot; (&quot;linguado&quot;).
* In online discourse, @ is used by some anarchists as a substitute for the traditional circle-A.
* Algebraic notation for the Crazyhouse chess variant: An @ between a piece and a square denotes a piece dropped onto that square from the player&#x27;s reserve.
* In many roguelike games @ is used to represent player character

==Names in other languages==
In many languages other than English, although most typewriters included the symbol, the use of @ was less common before email became widespread in the mid-1990s. Consequently, it is often perceived in those languages as denoting &quot;the Internet&quot;, computerization, or modernization in general. Naming the symbol after animals is also common.
* In Afrikaans, it is called , meaning &#x27;monkey tail&#x27;, similarly to the Dutch use of the word ( is the word for &#x27;monkey&#x27; or &#x27;ape&#x27; in Dutch, comes from the Dutch ).

Informally, it is called a , coming from the local pronunciation of the English word &quot;monkey&quot;. Note that the Croatian words for monkey, , , , are not used to denote the symbol, except seldom the latter words regionally. 
* In Czech it is called , which means &#x27;rollmops&#x27;; the same word is used in Slovak.
* In Danish, it is (&#x27;elephant&#x27;s trunk A&#x27;). It is not used for prices, where in Danish means &#x27;at (per piece)&#x27;.

* In French, it is now officially the (also spelled or ), or (though this is most commonly used in French-speaking Canada, and should normally only be used when quoting prices; it should always be called or, better yet, when in an email address). Its origin is the same as that of the Spanish word, which could be derived from the Arabic (). In France, it is also common (especially for younger generations) to say the English word &quot;at&quot; when spelling out an email address. In everyday Québec French, one often hears when sounding out an e-mail address, while TV and radio hosts are more likely to use . 
* In Georgian, it is , spelled (, ).
* In German, it has sometimes been referred to as (meaning &#x27;spider monkey&#x27;) or (meaning &#x27;monkey tail&#x27;). or refer to the similarity of @ to the tail of a monkey. More recently, it is commonly referred to as , as in English.

<text>Mechanochemistry (or mechanical chemistry) is the initiation of chemical reactions by mechanical phenomena. Mechanochemistry thus represents a fourth way to cause chemical reactions, complementing thermal reactions in fluids, photochemistry, and electrochemistry. Conventionally mechanochemistry focuses on the transformations of covalent bonds by mechanical force. Not covered by the topic are many phenomena: phase transitions, dynamics of biomolecules (docking, folding), and sonochemistry.

Mechanochemistry is not the same as mechanosynthesis, which refers specifically to the machine-controlled construction of complex molecular products.

In natural environments, mechanochemical reactions are frequently induced by physical processes such as earthquakes, glacier movement or hydraulic action of rivers or waves. In extreme environments such as subglacial lakes, hydrogen generated by mechnochemical reactions involving crushed silicate rocks and water can support methanogenic microbial communities. And mechanochemistry may have generated oxygen in the ancient Earth by water splitting on fractured mineral surfaces at high temperatures, potentially influencing life&#x27;s origin or early evolution.

== History ==
The primal mechanochemical project was to make fire by rubbing pieces of wood against each other, creating friction and hence heat, triggering combustion at the elevated temperature. Another method involves the use of flint and steel, during which a spark (a small particle of pyrophoric metal) spontaneously combusts in air, starting fire instantaneously.

Industrial mechanochemistry began with the grinding of two solid reactants. Mercuric sulfide (the mineral cinnabar) and copper metal thereby react to produce mercury and copper sulfide:

A special issue of Chemical Society Review was dedicated to mechanochemistry.

Scientists recognized that mechanochemical reactions occur in environments naturally due to various processes, and the reaction products have the potential to influence microbial communities in tectonically active regions. The field has garnered increasing attention recently as mechanochemistry has the potential to generate diverse molecules capable of supporting extremophilic microbes, influencing the early evolution of life, developing the systems necessary for the origin of life, or supporting alien life forms. The field has now inspired the initiation of a special research topic in the journal Frontiers in Geochemistry.

== Mechanical Processes ==

=== Natural ===
Earthquakes crush rocks across Earth&#x27;s subsurface and on other tectonically active planets. Rivers also frequently abrade rocks, revealing fresh mineral surfaces and waves at a shore erode cliffs fracture rocks and abrade sediments.

Similarly to rivers and oceans, the mechanical power of glaciers is evidenced by their impact on landscapes. As glaciers move downslope, they abrade rocks, generating fractured mineral surfaces that can partake in mechanochemical reactions.

=== Unnatural ===
In laboratories, planetary ball mills are typically used to induce crushing to investigate natural processes.

Mechanochemical transformations are often complex and different from thermal or photochemical mechanisms. Ball milling and ResonantAcoustic Mixing (RAM) are widely used processes in which mechanical force is used to achieve chemical transformations.

It eliminates the need for many solvents, offering the possibility that mechanochemistry could help make many industries more environmentally friendly. For example, the mechanochemical process has been used to synthesize pharmaceutically-attractive phenol hydrazones.

== Chemical Reactions ==
Mechanochemical reactions encompass reactions between mechanically fractured solid materials and any other reactants present in the environment. However, natural mechanochemical reactions frequently involve the reaction of water with crushed rock, so called water-rock reactions. Mechanochemistry is typically initiated by the breakage of bonds between atoms within many different mineral types.

=== Silicates ===
Silicates are the most common minerals in the Earth&#x27;s crust, and thus comprise the mineral type most commonly involved in natural mechanochemical reactions. Silicates are made up of silicon and oxygen atoms, typically arranged in silicon tetrahedra. Mechanical processes break the bonds between the silicon and oxygen atoms. If the bonds are broken by a homolytic cleavage, unpaired electrons are generated:

≡Si–O–Si≡ → ≡Si–O• + ≡Si•

≡Si–O–O–Si≡ → ≡Si–O• + ≡Si–O•

≡Si–O–O–Si≡ → ≡Si–O–O• + ≡Si•

==== Hydrogen Generation ====
The reaction of water with silicon radicals can generate hydrogen radicals:

2≡Si• + 2H2O → 2≡Si–O–H + 2H•

2H• → H2

This mechanism can generate H2 to support methanogens in environments with few other energy sources. However, at higher temperatures (~&gt;80 °C), hydrogen radicals react with siloxyl radicals, preventing the generation of H2 by this mechanism:

≡Si–O• + H• → ≡Si–O–H

2H• → H2

==== Oxidant Generation ====
When oxygen reacts with silicon or oxygen radicals at the surface of crushed rocks, it can chemically adsorb to the surface:

≡Si• + O2 → ≡Si–O–O•

≡Si–O• + O2 → ≡Si–O–O–O•

These oxygen radicals can then generate oxidants such as hydroxyl radicals and hydrogen peroxide:

≡Si–O–O• + H2O → ≡Si–O–O–H + •OH

2•OH → H2O2

Additionally, oxidants may be generated in the absence of oxygen at high temperatures:

≡Si–O• + H2O → ≡Si–O–H + •OH

2•OH → H2O2

H2O2 breaks down naturally in environments to form water and Oxygen gas:

2H2O2 → 2H2O + O2

== Industry applications ==
Fundamentals and applications ranging from nano materials to technology have been reviewed. The approach has been used to synthesize metallic nanoparticles, catalysts, magnets, γ‐graphyne, metal iodates, nickel–vanadium carbide and molybdenum–vanadium carbide nanocomposite powders.

Ball milling has been used to separate hydrocarbon gases from crude oil. The process used 1-10% of the energy of conventional cryogenics. Differential absorption is affected by milling intensity, pressure and duration. The gases are recovered by heating, at a specific temperature for each gas type. The process has successfully processed alkyne, olefin and paraffin gases using boron nitride powder.

(Poly)lactic acid, a green material, can be upcycled into alkyl lactate esters by mechanochemistry, using alcohol as a reaction partner under resonant acoustic mixing. 

=== Storage ===
Mechanochemistry has potential for energy-efficient solid-state storage of hydrogen, ammonia and other fuel gases. The resulting powder is safer than conventional methods of compression and liquefaction.

<text>The [[modern pentathlon]] at the [[2000 Summer Olympics]] in Sydney was held from 30 September to 1 October 2000. The men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s events each involved 24 athletes. The venues for the events were The Dome and Exhibition Complex (fencing and shooting), the Sydney International Aquatic Centre (swimming), and Sydney Baseball Stadium (horse riding and cross-country running). For the first time in Olympic history, modern pentathlon at these Olympic games had the highest ratio of NOC representation with respect to its quota out of all the sports, and also, the women&#x27;s event was officially included in the program.

Great Britain was also the most successful nation, topping the medal table with two medals. Stephanie Cook of Great Britain won the inaugural women&#x27;s event. Her compatriot Kate Allenby took the bronze medal, while Emily de Riel of the United States claimed the silver. The Eastern European nations, on the other hand, dominated the men&#x27;s event, as Dmitry Svatkovsky of Russia won the gold, followed by Hungary&#x27;s Gábor Balogh and Belarus&#x27; Pavel Dovgal, who each obtained silver and bronze medals, respectively.

==Format==
Modern pentathlon contained five events; pistol shooting, épée fencing, 200 m freestyle swimming, show jumping, and a 3 km cross-country run. They were held in that order, with each segment awarding points to competitors based on their performance in the segment. The points from each of the events were summed to give a final ranking; in addition, the running segment at the end of the day used a staggered start designed so that the order in which runners finished would be the same as their ranking by total points.

<text>Samson Agonistes (from Greek Σαμσών ἀγωνιστής, &quot;Samson the champion&quot;) is a tragic closet drama by John Milton. It appeared with the publication of Milton&#x27;s &quot; Paradise Regained&quot; in 1671, as the title page of that volume states: &quot;Paradise Regained / A Poem / In IV Books / To Which Is Added / Samson Agonistes&quot;. It is generally thought that &quot;Samson Agonistes&quot; was begun around the same time as &quot;Paradise Regained&quot; but was completed after the larger work, possibly very close to the date of publishing, but there is no certainty.

==Background==

Milton began plotting various subjects for tragedies in a notebook created in the 1640s. Many of the ideas dealt with the topic of Samson, and he gave them titles such as &quot;Samson pursophorus or Hybristes&quot; (&quot;Samson the Firebrand, or Samson the Violent&quot;), &quot;Samson marriing or in Ramath Lechi&quot;, and &quot;Dagonalia&quot; (the unholy rites at which Samson performed his vindication of God). The title he chose emphasises Samson as a warrior or an athlete, and the play was included with &quot;Paradise Regained&quot; and printed on 29 May 1671 by John Starkey. It is uncertain as to when the work was composed, which leaves the possibility that it was an early work that was filled with Milton&#x27;s ideas about the English Civil War or it was a later work that incorporates his despair over the Restoration. Evidence for the early dating is based on his early works and his belief in revolution whereas evidence for a later dating connects the play with his later works, such as &quot;Paradise Lost&quot;, and comments reflecting on the fall of the Commonwealth. In 1671, the work was printed with a new title page and prefaced his work with a discussion on Greek tragedy and Aristotle&#x27;s &quot;Poetics&quot;.

On the title page, Milton wrote that the piece was a &quot;Dramatic Poem&quot; rather than a drama. He did not wish for it to be performed on stage, but thought that the text could still influence people. He hoped that by giving Samson attributes of other Biblical figures, including Job or the Psalmist, he could create a complex hero who would embody and help resolve theological issues.
In writing the poem and choosing the character of Samson as his hero, Milton was also illustrating his own blindness, which afflicted him in his later life.

==Play==
&quot;Samson Agonistes&quot; draws on the story of Samson from the Old Testament, Judges 13–16; in fact it is a dramatisation of the story starting at Judges 16:23. The drama starts &quot;in medias res&quot;. Samson has been captured by the Philistines, had his hair, the container of his strength, cut off and his eyes cut out. Samson is &quot;Blind among enemies, O worse than chains&quot; (line 66).

Near the beginning of the play, Samson humbles himself before God by admitting that his power is not his own: &quot;God, when he gave me strength, to show withal / How slight the gift was, hung it in my hair&quot; (lines 58–9).

The Chorus discusses Samson&#x27;s background and describes his various military accomplishments:
:Ran on embattled armies clad in iron,
:And, weaponless himself,
:Made arms ridiculous, useless the forgery
:Of brazen shield and spear, the hammered cuirass,
:Chalybean-tempered steel, and frock of mail
:Adamantean proof;

:Then with what trivial weapon came to hand,
:The jaw of a dead ass, his sword of bone,
:A thousand foreskins fell
:(lines 129–134, 142–4)

Although he is great, the Chorus points out that, through his blindness (actual and metaphorically), he is a prisoner:
:Thou art become (O worst imprisonment!)
:The Dungeon of thy self; thy soul
:(Which men enjoying sight oft without cause complain)
:Imprisoned now indeed,
:In real darkness of the body dwells,
:Shut up from outward light
:To incorporate with gloomy night
:For inward light alas
:Puts forth no visual beam
:(lines 155–163)

Samson reveals how he lost his power because of his desire for Dalila, and, through this act, betrayed God:
I yielded, and unlocked her all my heart,
Who with a grain of manhood well resolved
Might easily have shook off all her snares:
But foul effeminancy held me yoked
Her bond-slave. O indignity, O blot
To honor and religion! Servile mind
Rewarded well with servile punishment!
(lines 407–413)

However, his state is more than just his own, and it represents a metaphor for the suffering of God&#x27;s chosen people when Samson says:
:Or to th&#x27; unjust tribunals, under change of times,
:And condemnation of the ingrateful multitude.
:If these they scape, perhaps in poverty
:With sickness and disease thou bow&#x27;st them down,
:(lines 695–698)

After Samson rejects Dalila&#x27;s pleas, she asks for Samson to &quot;let me approach at least, and touch thy hand&quot; (line 951), and Samson responds, &quot;Not for thy life, lest fierce remembrance wake / My sudden rage to tear thee joint by joint&quot; (lines 952–3). He shows Dalila how not to upset him: &quot;At distance I forgive thee, go with that&quot; (line 954). The Chorus, shortly after, complains about the nature of women and how deceptive they are:
:Whate&#x27;er it be, to wisest men and best
:Seeming at first all heavenly under virgin veil,
:Soft, modest, meek, demure,
:Once joined, the contrary she proves, a thorn
:Intestine, far within defensive arms
:A cleaving mischief, in his way to virtue
:Adverse and turbulent, or by her charms
:Draws him awry enslaved
:With dotage, and his sense depraved
:To folly and shameful deeds which ruin ends.
:(lines 1034–1043)

Harapha points out that Samson is
:... no worthy match
:For valor to assail, nor by the sword
:Of noble warrior ...
:But by the barber’s razor best subdued
:(lines 1164-7)

But he does describe Samson&#x27;s past accomplishments when he says &quot;thou art famed / To have wrought such wonders with an ass’s jaw&quot; (lines 1094–5).

The Chorus discusses how God grants individuals with the power to free his people from their bonds, especially through violent means:
:He all their ammunition
:And feats of war defeats
:With plain heroic magnitude of mind
:And celestial vigor armed;
:Their armouries and magazines contemns,
:Renders them useless, while
:With winged expedition
:Swift as the lightning glance he executes
:His errand on the wicked, who surprised
:Lose their defence, distracted and amazed.
:(lines 1277–86)

The last two hundred and fifty lines describe the violent act that actually occurs while the play was unfolding: Samson is granted the power to destroy the temple and kill all of the Philistines along with himself. However, this event does not take place on stage but is told through others. When the temple&#x27;s destruction is reported, there is an emphasis on death and not peace:
:Man. I know your friendly minds and – O what noise!
::Mercy of Heav’n, what hideous noise was that!
::Horribly loud, unlike the former shout.
:Chor. Noise call you it, or universal groan,
::As if the whole inhabitation perished?
::Blood, death, and dreadful deeds are in that noise,
::Ruin, destruction at the utmost point.
:Man. Of ruin indeed methought I heard the noise.
::Oh it continues, they have slain my son.
:Chor. Thy son is rather slaying them; that outcry
::From slaughter of one foe could not ascend.
:Man. Some dismal accident it needs must be;
::What shall we do, stay here or run and see?
:Chor. Best keep together here, lest running thither
::We unawares run into danger’s mouth.
::This evil on the Philistines is fall’n;
::From whom could else a general cry be heard?
:(lines 1508–24)

Manoah describes the event as &quot;Sad, but thou know’st to Israelites not saddest / The desolation of a hostile city&quot; (lines 1560–1)

The final lines describe a catharsis that seems to take over at the end of the play:
:His servants he with new acquist
:Of true experience from this great event
:With peace and consolation hath dismissed,
:And calm of mind, all passion spent.
:(lines 1755–1758)

==Themes==

&quot;Samson Agonistes&quot; combines Greek tragedy with Hebrew Scripture, which alters both forms. Milton believed that the Bible was better in its classical forms than those written by the Greeks and Romans. In his introduction, Milton discusses Aristotle&#x27;s definition of tragedy and sets out his own paraphrase of it to connect it to &quot;Samson Agonistes&quot;:
Tragedy, as it was anciently composed, hath been ever held the gravest, moralest, and most profitable of all other poems: therefore said by Aristotle to be of power by raising pity and fear, or terror, to purge the mind of those and such-like passions, that is to temper and reduce them to just measure with a kind of delight, stirred up by reading or seeing those passions well imitated. Nor is nature wanting in her own effects to make good his assertion: for so in physic things of melancholic hue and quality are used against melancholy, sour against sour, salt to remove salt humors.
Milton continues, &quot;Of the style and uniformity, and that commonly called the plot, whether intricate or explicit... they only will best judge who are not unacquainted with Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides, the three tragic poets unequaled yet by any, and the best rule to all who endeavor to write tragedy&quot;.

The reliance on Hebrew Scripture allows Milton to emphasise a plot that he feels is worthy of discussion, while the elements of Greek tragedy allows Milton to deal with complex issues through use of choruses and messengers instead of directly depicting them in addition to softening the Hebrew characters. This merging of two forms alters Samson from a rough barbarian into a pious warrior of God.

===Violence===
Acts of violence are an important theme within &quot;Samson Agonistes&quot; as the play attempts to deal with revenge and the destruction of God&#x27;s enemies. Michael Lieb posits that &quot;the drama is a work of violence to its very core. It extols violence. Indeed, it exults in violence&quot;. John Coffey simply describes the action in the play as &quot;a spectacular act of holy violence and revenge&quot;. Likewise, David Loewenstein remarks that &quot;the destruction and vengeance depicted in &quot;Samson Agonistes&quot;, then, dramatizes a kind of awesome religious terror&quot;. Gordon Teskey describes the plot of the work when he says, &quot;delirious violence of the hero of &quot;Samson Agonistes&quot;, who cancels the Philistine hallucination of a unified and harmonious world&quot;. Against the backdrop of the challenge posed by suicide terrorism, Arata Takeda points to ethical implications arising from Samson&#x27;s &quot;brutal massacre committed against civilians attending a religious feast&quot; and the following &quot;lyrical extolment of the suicide mass murder&quot;.

The play itself suggests the horror within the actions through descriptive phrases, including &quot;evil news&quot; (line 538), &quot;this so horrid spectacle&quot; (line 1542), &quot;the place of horror&quot; (line 1550) and &quot;the sad event&quot; (line 1551). Although Samson is the hero and he causes the violence, Elizabeth Sauer points out that &quot;Milton devotes nearly twice as many lines to the Chorus&#x27; reactions in the denouement than to the Messenger&#x27;s description of the catastrophe in order to deemphasize spectacle and performance and instead to highlight the interior drama while encouraging active interpretation of the reported events&quot;.

===Women===
The play, focusing around the betrayal of Samson at the hands of Dalila, his wife, produces a negative portrayal of love and love&#x27;s effects. Women, and men&#x27;s desire for women, are connected to idolatry against God and the idea that there is no possibility for the sacred within the bonds of marital love. Samson, who is both holy and desirous of Dalila, is seduced into betraying the source of his strength, and thus betrays God. He is emasculated, through blindness, because of his sexual desires. The Chorus, after Dalila attempts to seduce Samson again, criticises women for being deceptive.

Samson&#x27;s argument against Dalila is to discuss the proper role of a wife but also the superiority of men. The depiction of Dalila, and women, is similar to that in Milton&#x27;s divorce tracts and, as John Guillory states and then asks, &quot;We scarcely need to observe that &quot;Samson Agonistes&quot; assumes the subjection of women, a practice to which Milton gives his unequivocal endorsement; but is there any sense in which that practice of subjection is modified by the contemporaneous form of the sexual divisions of labor?&quot;. A wife is supposed to help a husband, and the husband, regardless of the status of the woman, is supposed to have the superior status. In blaming Dalila, he rationalises his actions and removes blame from himself, which is similar to what Adam attempts in &quot;Paradise Lost&quot; after the fall. However, Samson develops through the play and Dalila reveals that she is concerned only with her status among her people. This places Dalila in a different role from Milton&#x27;s Eve. Instead, she is an emasculating force and represents Samson&#x27;s past failings.

===Religion===
Samson undergoes despair when he loses God&#x27;s favour in the form of his strength. In his searching for a way to return to being true to God and to serve his will, Samson is compared to the non-conformists after the English Restoration who are attacked and abused simply because they, according to their own view, serve God in the correct way.

===Blindness===
As blindness overtook Milton, it becomes a major trope in &quot;Samson Agonistes&quot;, and is seen also in &quot;Paradise Lost&quot; (3.22–55) and his 19th Sonnet. Many scholars have written about the impact of Milton&#x27;s increasing blindness on his works. This recurrence of blindness came after Milton temporarily gave up his poetry to work for Oliver Cromwell and the Commonwealth government. He continued this service even though his eyesight was failing and he knew that he was hastening his own blindness. The correlation is significant to the &quot;Agonistes&quot; plot: Milton describes Samson as being &quot;Eyeless in Gaza&quot;, a phrase that has become the most quoted line of &quot;Agonistes&quot;. Novelist Aldous Huxley used it as the title for his 1936 novel &quot;Eyeless in Gaza&quot;.

Samson&#x27;s blindness, however, is not exactly analogous to Milton&#x27;s. Rather, Samson&#x27;s blindness plays various symbolic roles. One is the correlation between Samson&#x27;s inner blindness as well as outer, the fact that he believes his &quot;intimate impulses&quot; to be divine messages, yet is never in any way divinely affirmed in this, unlike the rest of Milton&#x27;s divinely influenced characters. Samson&#x27;s inability to see that his inner vision does not correlate to divine vision is manifest in his physical blindness. It also plays on his blindness to reason, leading him to act hastily, plus the fact that he is so easily deceived by Delila, &quot;blinded&quot; by her feminine wiles. Some of the chorus&#x27;s lines in Samson Agonistes are rhymed, thus suggesting a return of the &quot;chain of rhymes&quot;, which itself reflects upon Samson&#x27;s imprisonment.

==Productions==

<doc id="710243" wikidata="Q2919952" url="?curid=710243" title="Abortion in the Netherlands">
<text>[[Abortion]] in the Netherlands was fully legalized on 1 November 1984, allowing elective abortion up to the 24th week of the pregnancy. Abortion for &quot;serious medical reasons&quot; can be performed after 24 weeks. There used to be a mandatory five-day waiting period for abortions done after one&#x27;s menstrual period is 17 days overdue. However, on 21 June 2022, Dutch parliament approved a law to scrap the mandatory five-day reflection period before undergoing an abortion, saying women with a joint consultation with the doctor, should be able to determine the time before making a decision. The law went into effect in January 2023.

== History ==
Abortion was deemed illegal under the Penal Code of 1886. Convictions were all but precluded, however, by a requirement that the prosecution prove that the fetus had been alive until the abortion. The Morality Acts of 1911 closed this loophole, and strictly barred all abortions, except those performed to save the life of the pregnant woman.

Legalization reached the forefront of public debate in the Netherlands during the 1970s as many other Western European countries liberalized their laws. The Staten-Generaal, however, was unable to reach a consensus between those opposing legalization, those in favor of allowing abortion, and those favoring a compromise measure. A controversial abortion law was passed in 1981 with single swing votes: 76 for and 74 against in the House of Representatives, and 38 for and 37 against in the Senate. The law left abortion a crime, unless performed at a clinic or hospital that is issued an official abortion certificate by the Dutch government, and the woman who is asking for the abortion declares she considers it to be an emergency. The law came into effect on 1 November 1984.

Currently, there are just over 100 Dutch general hospitals certified to perform abortions, and 17 specialized abortion clinics. More than 90% of abortions take place in the specialized clinics.

== Available procedures ==
In the Netherlands, abortion performed by a certified clinic or hospital is effectually allowed at any point between conception and viability, till 2022 subject to a five-day waiting period. The waiting period does not apply if your menstrual period is less than 17 days overdue (very early stage pregnancy). After the first trimester, the procedure becomes stricter, as two doctors must consent to treatment. In practice, abortions are performed until approximately 24 weeks into pregnancy, although this limit is the topic of ongoing discussion among physicians in the Netherlands, since, due to recent medical advancements, a fetus can sometimes be considered viable prior to 24 weeks. As a result of this debate, abortions are only rarely performed after 22 weeks of pregnancy. Abortions must be performed in a hospital.

Abortion in the Netherlands can completed with the use of different procedures including use of an abortion pill, vacuum aspiration, or dilation and evacuation.

===The abortion pill===
Since February 2000, the use of the abortion pill was legalized in the Netherlands. The pills are permitted to be taken up to 49 days after the first day of the last menstrual bleed. For most people, this is a timeframe of approximately three weeks. For this procedure, you get prescribed three pills. The pills need to be taken during an in-clinic appointments. With your last appointment you are required to stay for 4–6 hours for observation.

=== Vacuum aspiration ===

This is a procedure that uses a vacuum or suction device as a source to remove an embryo or fetus from the womb. This procedure is only available in certified medical clinics or hospitals.

=== Dilation and evacuation ===
This is a surgical procedure that is offered after the first trimester of pregnancy. This procedure completely removes the fetus and all placental tissue in the uterus. An other name for this procedure are surgical abortion. Sometimes this procedure is also used in case of an incomplete miscarriage.

== Number of abortions ==
The number of abortions has been relatively stable in the 21st century, around 28,000 per year. , the abortion rate was 9.7 abortions per 1000 women aged 15–44 years (0.97%), one of the lowest in the world.

1 in 5 women in the Netherlands has experience with an unwanted pregnancy, however, only 13.5% of those unwanted pregnancies end with an abortion.However, since scrapping the mandatory 5-days wait period, abortion number has raised.

<doc id="710247" wikidata="Q6832306" url="?curid=710247" title="Michael Long (footballer)">
<text>Michael Long (born ) is a former Australian rules footballer of Aboriginal descent who became a spokesperson for Indigenous rights and against racism in sport in Australia.

Long played in dual Australian Football League (AFL) premierships with the Essendon Football Club, including a Norm Smith Medal for his 1993 grand final performance. As an activist, he is credited with being instrumental in the introduction of a racial vilification code in the AFL in 1995 and the inspiration behind &quot;The Long Walk&quot; commemorating the Stolen Generations, now a strong AFL tradition. In August 2023, Long began a walk between Melbourne and Canberra in support of the forthcoming Australian Indigenous Voice referendum. He completed the walk in 20 days and arrived in Canberra on 14 September 2023.

==Early life==
Michael Long was born on 1 October 1969 to mother Agnes and father Jack Long. Both were removed from their parents at a young age and taken to Melville Island, one of the Tiwi Islands. Jack&#x27;s half Chinese and half English father fought unsuccessfully for custody of his son. Agnes was taken from Daly River near Darwin, and Jack was taken from Ti Tree near Alice Springs. Michael was raised on the Tiwi Islands.

==Early career==
Long moved to Darwin to play with St Mary&#x27;s, where he played in several premierships. In 1988, he represented the Northern Territory at the Adelaide Bicentennial Carnival in March, and his outstanding performances in the dominant NT team saw enormous interest in his recruitment from various first-class clubs throughout the country, including Essendon, which nominated him in the 1988 VFL draft.

Despite being drafted to the Victorian Football League (VFL), South Australian National Football League (SANFL) club West Torrens argued that Long was &quot;contracted with the club and could not play anywhere else&quot;. Recruiter Noel Judkins said, &quot;I was guaranteed this wasn&#x27;t the case, so I took the contract to Darwin and met with Michael&#x27;s father Jack, and he was irate. He grabbed it and wrote the word &#x27;bullshit&#x27; right across the front of it. When it became clear he wanted to play at Essendon, West Torrens agreed it wasn&#x27;t a binding contract.&quot; However, despite this, Long did play for West Torrens during the 1988 SANFL season, winning the club&#x27;s best-and-fairest award, the third-last player to do so, as the Eagles merged with the Woodville Football Club following the 1990 season to become the Woodville-West Torrens Eagles.

==Australian Football League career==
Long played perhaps the best game of his career in the 1993 AFL grand final. Playing on Mark Athorn, Long ran amok, helping Essendon gain a healthy quarter-time lead and then maintain it. By the end of the game, he had amassed 20 kicks and 13 handballs, totalling 33 possessions. Long&#x27;s performance was rewarded with the Norm Smith Medal, which was presented to him by fellow Tiwi Islander Maurice Rioli.

In the pre-season of 1994, in a practice match against West Coast, Long injured his knee, which required 12 months of solid rehabilitation, and he was not seen for the entire home-and-away season. In 1995, Long made a triumphant return to AFL football and played almost a full season. In the inaugural Anzac Day match between Essendon and Collingwood at the MCG, an incident of racial abuse targeting Long occurred, which was to have a lasting impact on the game.

For the next two seasons, Long needed knee surgery and only took the field seven times. He missed the first half of 1998 while recovering from the surgery, but he finished the year strongly, playing in nine games. According to the round 3, 1999 edition of the &quot;AFL Record&quot;, between the beginning of the 1994 and the end of the 1998 seasons, Long played only 38 of a possible 119 games.

Long had the honour of kicking the first-ever goal at the new Docklands Stadium when it opened in 2000. He was also a member of Essendon&#x27;s record-breaking premiership team in 2000 which lost only one game for the entire season. Long faced heavy scrutiny for his bump on Troy Simmonds, which rendered Simmonds unconscious and raised the possibility of him losing mobility. While this never eventuated, the incident prompted the AFL to introduce new rules protecting players with their heads over the ball. Long was thus suspended for the act.

2001 was Long&#x27;s final season, and although Essendon again made the grand final, Long aggravated a hamstring injury during training in the week leading up to the match and was forced to name himself unavailable on the eve of the game, which Essendon lost to Brisbane.

===Racial abuse=== 
In the inaugural Anzac Day match of the 1995 season between Essendon and Collingwood at the MCG, Long made an official complaint after he had been racially taunted by Collingwood ruckman Damian Monkhorst. The AFL arranged a mediation session between Long and Monkhorst and held a media conference. Although Long was clearly unsatisfied by the short-term outcome of their meeting, and both players received death threats, the long-term result was that it set a racial vilification code that held players to account for racist acts on the field. An AFL investigation after the incident showed that at least 10 players from six clubs regularly racially abused players. Since this incident, there have only been a handful of widely publicised accusations of racial taunts by a player on the AFL field in the following three decades, although racial abuse from fans has proved to be a recurring issue over the years.
Twenty years after the incident, at the MCG to launch the 11th Long Walk in 2015, Monkhorst and Long met and shook hands in a mutually respectful manner. Long said that Monkhorst had since shown great leadership.

In 1997, Peter &quot;Spida&quot; Everitt reportedly racially abused Long, which ironically drew a free kick to Everitt due to Long&#x27;s enraged physical response. Although nothing of consequence happened from the Long–Everitt incident, Everitt racially vilified Melbourne&#x27;s Scott Chisholm two years later and undertook a racial awareness training program as well as donating $20,000 to a charity of Chisholm&#x27;s choice. In addition, Everitt lost $50,000–$60,000 in match bonuses (depending on sources) from the incident.
 The incident came a week after Sam Newman infamously donned blackface to mock Nicky Winmar for declining to come on &quot;The Footy Show.&quot;

== Post-football activism ==
Following his retirement, Long became a spokesman for Indigenous Australians. He was a critic of then-Prime Minister John Howard&#x27;s policies towards Indigenous Australians — most notably Howard&#x27;s refusal to make an apology to the Stolen Generations. In a letter published in Melbourne&#x27;s &quot;The Age&quot;, Long likened Howard to &quot;those cold-hearted pricks&quot; who had removed his parents from their families.

===First Long Walk===
Long&#x27;s political activities culminated in a protest march from Melbourne to Canberra, leaving on 21 November 2004. The aim of the walk was to obtain a meeting with the Prime Minister. After ten days of intense media scrutiny of the walk, Prime Minister Howard eventually granted Long a meeting, at which point Long called an end to the walk, having completed half (about of the planned ) of the walk. He later said: &quot;I wanted to make a change. It was about challenging the government about some of the issues Aboriginal people were facing and still face – education, employment, health, housing, the Stolen Generations.&quot; 

The walk became known as The Long Walk, and the tradition of a commemorative community walk in Melbourne has continued, with thousands turning out for the event. The walk takes place in late May or early June before the annual Dreamtime at the &#x27;G match, starting at Federation Square and ending at the MCG. Long is patron of The Long Walk, an organisation inspired by his walk and which works for the health and wellbeing of Indigenous Australians.

===Second Long Walk===
In August 2023 Long began a walk between Melbourne and Canberra, this time in support of the forthcoming Australian Indigenous Voice referendum. He completed the walk after 20 days, arriving at Parliament House in Canberra on 14 September. He reported that he had experienced &quot;overwhelming support&quot; from people he met in regional Australia.

==Other activities and roles==
In July 2011, Long signed up as ambassador for weight-loss agency Jenny Craig, partly to highlight Indigenous health. 

In 2015, he became board member of the newly founded Michael Long Foundation (MLF), and in 2016 the Michael Long Learning and Leadership Centre (MLLLC) opened in Darwin. MLF funds education and football programs for indigenous people, and the MLLLC, funded by the federal government and managed by AFL Northern Territory, aims to nurture talent and improve lives and communities.

==Recognition, honours and awards==
In 2002, an Essendon panel ranked Long at number 23 in their &quot;Champions of Essendon&quot; list of the 25 greatest players ever to have played for Essendon.

Long was awarded the Medal of the Order of Australia in the 2021 Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours, for &quot;service to Australian rules football, and to the Indigenous community&quot;.

==Personal life==
Long is renowned for his sharp wit. In an incident recalled by Long&#x27;s only VFL/AFL coach, Kevin Sheedy, there was a fundraiser to reconstruct Windy Hill that was under way, and Sheedy was conducting a serious training session in front of a whiteboard and 200 people, mostly money donors. He paused to ask if anyone had a question. To the surprise of all that knew him, Long, who apparently hadn&#x27;t spoken up during a training session in five years, raised his hand, causing people to fall silent to hear Long speak. Long asked, &quot;What was wrong with the blackboard?&quot;

In 2006, Long was charged with assaulting a man at a football club function in Darwin. He pleaded guilty when the case came to trial in 2009, saying he had struck a man who had attacked his sister. No conviction was recorded, with the magistrate saying that he was unlikely to reoffend.

In 2018, Long was treated for a life-threatening infectious disease, melioidosis, in a hospital in Darwin; however, this did not stop him from announcing plans for a second Long Walk, as he was honoured for the Sir Doug Nicholls Round at Dreamtime at the &#x27;G in May 2019.

<doc id="710251" wikidata="Q165848" url="?curid=710251" title="Wind wave">
<text>In fluid dynamics, a wind wave, or wind-generated water wave, is a surface wave that occurs on the free surface of bodies of water as a result of the wind blowing over the water&#x27;s surface. The contact distance in the direction of the wind is known as the &quot;fetch&quot;. Waves in the oceans can travel thousands of kilometers before reaching land. Wind waves on Earth range in size from small ripples to waves over high, being limited by wind speed, duration, fetch, and water depth.

When directly generated and affected by local wind, a wind wave system is called a wind sea. Wind waves will travel in a great circle route after being generated – curving slightly left in the southern hemisphere and slightly right in the northern hemisphere. After moving out of the area of fetch and no longer being affected by the local wind, wind waves are called &quot;swells&quot; and can travel thousands of kilometers. A noteworthy example of this is waves generated south of Tasmania during heavy winds that will travel across the Pacific to southern California, producing desirable surfing conditions. Wind waves in the ocean are also called ocean surface waves and are mainly &quot;gravity waves&quot;, where gravity is the main equilibrium force.

Wind waves have a certain amount of randomness: subsequent waves differ in height, duration, and shape with limited predictability. They can be described as a stochastic process, in combination with the physics governing their generation, growth, propagation, and decay – as well as governing the interdependence between flow quantities such as the water surface movements, flow velocities, and water pressure. The key statistics of wind waves (both seas and swells) in evolving sea states can be predicted with wind wave models.

Although waves are usually considered in the water seas of Earth, the hydrocarbon seas of Titan may also have wind-driven waves. Waves in bodies of water may also be generated by other causes, both at the surface and underwater (such as watercraft, animals, waterfalls, landslides, earthquakes, bubbles, and impact events).

==Formation==


The great majority of large breakers seen at a beach result from distant winds. Five factors influence the formation of the flow structures in wind waves:
# Wind speed or strength relative to wave speed – the wind must be moving faster than the wave crest for energy transfer to the wave.
# The uninterrupted distance of open water over which the wind blows without significant change in direction (called the &quot;fetch&quot;)
# Width of the area affected by fetch (at a right angle to the distance)
# Wind duration – the time for which the wind has blown over the water.
# Water depth
All of these factors work together to determine the size of the water waves and the structure of the flow within them.

The main dimensions associated with wave propagation are:
* Wave height (vertical distance from trough to crest)
* Wave length (distance from crest to crest in the direction of propagation)
* Wave period (time interval between arrival of consecutive crests at a stationary point)
* Wave direction or azimuth (predominantly driven by wind direction)

A fully developed sea has the maximum wave size theoretically possible for a wind of specific strength, duration, and fetch. Further exposure to that specific wind could only cause a dissipation of energy due to the breaking of wave tops and formation of &quot;whitecaps&quot;. Waves in a given area typically have a range of heights. For weather reporting and for scientific analysis of wind wave statistics, their characteristic height over a period of time is usually expressed as &quot;significant wave height&quot;. This figure represents an average height of the highest one-third of the waves in a given time period (usually chosen somewhere in the range from 20 minutes to twelve hours), or in a specific wave or storm system. The significant wave height is also the value a &quot;trained observer&quot; (e.g. from a ship&#x27;s crew) would estimate from visual observation of a sea state. Given the variability of wave height, the largest individual waves are likely to be somewhat less than twice the reported significant wave height for a particular day or storm.

Wave formation on an initially flat water surface by wind is started by a random distribution of normal pressure of turbulent wind flow over the water. This pressure fluctuation produces normal and tangential stresses in the surface water, which generates waves. It is usually assumed for the purpose of theoretical analysis that:
# The water is originally at rest.
# The water is not viscous.
# The water is irrotational.
# There is a random distribution of normal pressure to the water surface from the turbulent wind.
# Correlations between air and water motions are neglected.

The second mechanism involves wind shear forces on the water surface. John W. Miles suggested a surface wave generation mechanism that is initiated by turbulent wind shear flows based on the inviscid Orr–Sommerfeld equation in 1957. He found the energy transfer from the wind to the water surface is proportional to the curvature of the velocity profile of the wind at the point where the mean wind speed is equal to the wave speed. Since the wind speed profile is logarithmic to the water surface, the curvature has a negative sign at this point. This relation shows the wind flow transferring its kinetic energy to the water surface at their interface.

Assumptions:
# two-dimensional parallel shear flow
# incompressible, inviscid water and wind
# irrotational water
# slope of the displacement of the water surface is small

Generally, these wave formation mechanisms occur together on the water surface and eventually produce fully developed waves.

For example, if we assume a flat sea surface (Beaufort state 0), and a sudden wind flow blows steadily across the sea surface, the physical wave generation process follows the sequence:

# Turbulent wind forms random pressure fluctuations at the sea surface. Ripples with wavelengths in the order of a few centimeters are generated by the pressure fluctuations. (The Phillips mechanism)
# The winds keep acting on the initially rippled sea surface causing the waves to become larger. As the waves grow, the pressure differences get larger causing the growth rate to increase. Finally, the shear instability expedites the wave growth exponentially. (The Miles mechanism)
# The interactions between the waves on the surface generate longer waves and the interaction will transfer wave energy from the shorter waves generated by the Miles mechanism to the waves which have slightly lower frequencies than the frequency at the peak wave magnitudes, then finally the waves will be faster than the crosswind speed (Pierson &amp; Moskowitz).

==Types==
Three different types of wind waves develop over time:
* Capillary waves, or ripples, dominated by surface tension effects.
* Gravity waves, dominated by gravitational and inertial forces.
** Seas, raised locally by the wind.
* Swells, which have traveled away from where they were raised by the wind, and have to a greater or lesser extent dispersed.

Ripples appear on smooth water when the wind blows, but will die quickly if the wind stops. The restoring force that allows them to propagate is surface tension. Sea waves are larger-scale, often irregular motions that form under sustained winds. These waves tend to last much longer, even after the wind has died, and the restoring force that allows them to propagate is gravity. As waves propagate away from their area of origin, they naturally separate into groups of common direction and wavelength. The sets of waves formed in this manner are known as swells. The Pacific Ocean is from Indonesia to the coast of Colombia and, based on an average wavelength of , would have ~258,824 swells over that width.

It is sometimes alleged that out of a set of waves, the seventh wave in a set is always the largest; while this isn&#x27;t the case, the waves in the middle of a given set tend to be larger than those before and after them.

Individual &quot;rogue waves&quot; (also called &quot;freak waves&quot;, &quot;monster waves&quot;, &quot;killer waves&quot;, and &quot;king waves&quot;) much higher than the other waves in the sea state can occur. In the case of the Draupner wave, its height was 2.2 times the significant wave height. Such waves are distinct from tides, caused by the Moon and Sun&#x27;s gravitational pull, tsunamis that are caused by underwater earthquakes or landslides, and waves generated by underwater explosions or the fall of meteorites—all having far longer wavelengths than wind waves.

The largest ever recorded wind waves are not rogue waves, but standard waves in extreme sea states. For example, high waves were recorded on the RRS Discovery in a sea with significant wave height, so the highest wave was only 1.6 times the significant wave height.
The biggest recorded by a buoy (as of 2011) was high during the 2007 typhoon Krosa near Taiwan.

==Spectrum==
Ocean waves can be classified based on: the disturbing force that creates them; the extent to which the disturbing force continues to influence them after formation; the extent to which the restoring force weakens or flattens them; and their wavelength or period. Seismic sea waves have a period of about 20 minutes, and speeds of . Wind waves (deep-water waves) have a period up to about 20 seconds.

The speed of all ocean waves is controlled by gravity, wavelength, and water depth. Most characteristics of ocean waves depend on the relationship between their wavelength and water depth. Wavelength determines the size of the orbits of water molecules within a wave, but water depth determines the shape of the orbits. The paths of water molecules in a wind wave are circular only when the wave is traveling in deep water. A wave cannot &quot;feel&quot; the bottom when it moves through water deeper than half its wavelength because too little wave energy is contained in the water movement below that depth. Waves moving through water deeper than half their wavelength are known as deep-water waves. On the other hand, the orbits of water molecules in waves moving through shallow water are flattened by the proximity of the sea bottom surface. Waves in water shallower than 1/20 their original wavelength are known as shallow-water waves. Transitional waves travel through water deeper than 1/20 their original wavelength but shallower than half their original wavelength.

In general, the longer the wavelength, the faster the wave energy will move through the water. The relationship between the wavelength, period and velocity of any wave is:

:::formula_1

where C is speed (celerity), L is the wavelength, and T is the period (in seconds). Thus the speed of the wave derives from the functional dependence formula_2 of the wavelength on the period (the dispersion relation).

The speed of a deep-water wave may also be approximated by:

:::formula_3

where g is the acceleration due to gravity, per second squared. Because g and π (3.14) are constants, the equation can be reduced to:

:::formula_4

when C is measured in meters per second and L in meters. In both formulas the wave speed is proportional to the square root of the wavelength.

The speed of shallow-water waves is described by a different equation that may be written as:

:::formula_5

where C is speed (in meters per second), g is the acceleration due to gravity, and d is the depth of the water (in meters). The period of a wave remains unchanged regardless of the depth of water through which it is moving. As deep-water waves enter the shallows and feel the bottom, however, their speed is reduced, and their crests &quot;bunch up&quot;, so their wavelength shortens.
===Spectral models===
Sea state can be described by the sea wave spectrum or just wave spectrum formula_6. It is composed of a wave height spectrum (WHS) formula_7 and a wave direction spectrum (WDS) formula_8. Many interesting properties about the sea state can be found from the wave spectra.

WHS describes the spectral density of wave height variance (&quot;power&quot;) versus wave frequency, with dimension formula_9.
The relationship between the spectrum formula_10 and the wave amplitude formula_11 for a wave component formula_12 is:
: formula_13
Some WHS models are listed below. 
* The International Towing Tank Conference (ITTC) recommended spectrum model for fully developed sea (ISSC spectrum/modified Pierson-Moskowitz spectrum):
:: formula_14
* ITTC recommended spectrum model for limited fetch (JONSWAP spectrum)
:: formula_15
:where
:: formula_16
:: formula_17
:(The latter model has since its creation improved based on the work of Phillips and Kitaigorodskii to better model the wave height spectrum for high wavenumbers.)

As for WDS, an example model of formula_8 might be:
: formula_19
Thus the sea state is fully determined and can be recreated by the following function where formula_20 is the wave elevation, formula_21 is uniformly distributed between 0 and formula_22, and formula_23 is randomly drawn from the directional distribution function formula_24
: formula_25

==Shoaling and refraction==
As waves travel from deep to shallow water, their shape changes (wave height increases, speed decreases, and length decreases as wave orbits become asymmetrical). This process is called shoaling.

Wave refraction is the process that occurs when waves interact with the sea bed to slow the velocity of propagation as a function of wavelength and period. As the waves slow down in shoaling water, the crests tend to realign at a decreasing angle to the depth contours. Varying depths along a wave crest cause the crest to travel at different phase speeds, with those parts of the wave in deeper water moving faster than those in shallow water. This process continues while the depth decreases, and reverses if it increases again, but the wave leaving the shoal area may have changed direction considerably. Rays—lines normal to wave crests between which a fixed amount of energy flux is contained—converge on local shallows and shoals. Therefore, the wave energy between rays is concentrated as they converge, with a resulting increase in wave height.

Because these effects are related to a spatial variation in the phase speed, and because the phase speed also changes with the ambient current—due to the Doppler shift—the same effects of refraction and altering wave height also occur due to current variations. In the case of meeting an adverse current the wave &quot;steepens&quot;, i.e. its wave height increases while the wavelength decreases, similar to the shoaling when the water depth decreases.

==Breaking==


Some waves undergo a phenomenon called &quot;breaking&quot;. A breaking wave is one whose base can no longer support its top, causing it to collapse. A wave breaks when it runs into shallow water, or when two wave systems oppose and combine forces. When the slope, or steepness ratio, of a wave, is too great, breaking is inevitable.

Individual waves in deep water break when the wave steepness—the ratio of the wave height &quot;H&quot; to the wavelength &quot;λ&quot;—exceeds about 0.17, so for &quot;H&quot; &gt; 0.17 &quot;λ&quot;. In shallow water, with the water depth small compared to the wavelength, the individual waves break when their wave height &quot;H&quot; is larger than 0.8 times the water depth &quot;h&quot;, that is &quot;H&quot; &gt; 0.8 &quot;h&quot;. Waves can also break if the wind grows strong enough to blow the crest off the base of the wave.

In shallow water, the base of the wave is decelerated by drag on the seabed. As a result, the upper parts will propagate at a higher velocity than the base and the leading face of the crest will become steeper and the trailing face flatter. This may be exaggerated to the extent that the leading face forms a barrel profile, with the crest falling forward and down as it extends over the air ahead of the wave.

Three main types of breaking waves are identified by surfers or surf lifesavers. Their varying characteristics make them more or less suitable for surfing and present different dangers.
# Spilling, or rolling: these are the safest waves on which to surf. They can be found in most areas with relatively flat shorelines. They are the most common type of shorebreak. The deceleration of the wave base is gradual, and the velocity of the upper parts does not differ much with height. Breaking occurs mainly when the steepness ratio exceeds the stability limit.
# Plunging, or dumping: these break suddenly and can &quot;dump&quot; swimmers—pushing them to the bottom with great force. These are the preferred waves for experienced surfers. Strong offshore winds and long wave periods can cause dumpers. They are often found where there is a sudden rise in the seafloor, such as a reef or sandbar. Deceleration of the wave base is sufficient to cause upward acceleration and a significant forward velocity excess of the upper part of the crest. The peak rises and overtakes the forward face, forming a &quot;barrel&quot; or &quot;tube&quot; as it collapses.
# Surging: these may never actually break as they approach the water&#x27;s edge, as the water below them is very deep. They tend to form on steep shorelines. These waves can knock swimmers over and drag them back into deeper water. 
When the shoreline is near vertical, waves do not break but are reflected. Most of the energy is retained in the wave as it returns to seaward. Interference patterns are caused by superposition of the incident and reflected waves, and the superposition may cause localized instability when peaks cross, and these peaks may break due to instability.

==Physics of waves==

Wind waves are mechanical waves that propagate along the interface between water and air; the restoring force is provided by gravity, and so they are often referred to as surface gravity waves. As the wind blows, pressure and friction perturb the equilibrium of the water surface and transfer energy from the air to the water, forming waves. The initial formation of waves by the wind is described in the theory of Phillips from 1957, and the subsequent growth of the small waves has been modeled by Miles, also in 1957.


In linear plane waves of one wavelength in deep water, parcels near the surface move not plainly up and down but in circular orbits: forward above and backward below (compared to the wave propagation direction). As a result, the surface of the water forms not an exact sine wave, but more a trochoid with the sharper curves upwards—as modeled in trochoidal wave theory. Wind waves are thus a combination of transversal and longitudinal waves.

When waves propagate in shallow water, (where the depth is less than half the wavelength) the particle trajectories are compressed into ellipses.

In reality, for finite values of the wave amplitude (height), the particle paths do not form closed orbits; rather, after the passage of each crest, particles are displaced slightly from their previous positions, a phenomenon known as Stokes drift.

As the depth below the free surface increases, the radius of the circular motion decreases. At a depth equal to half the wavelength λ, the orbital movement has decayed to less than 5% of its value at the surface. The phase speed (also called the celerity) of a surface gravity wave is—for pure periodic wave motion of small-amplitude waves—well approximated by

:formula_26

where
:&quot;c&quot; = phase speed;
:&quot;λ&quot; = wavelength;
:&quot;d&quot; = water depth;
:&quot;g&quot; = acceleration due to gravity at the Earth&#x27;s surface.

In deep water, where formula_27, so formula_28 and the hyperbolic tangent approaches formula_29, the speed formula_30 approximates

:formula_31

In SI units, with formula_32 in m/s, formula_33, when formula_34 is measured in metres.
This expression tells us that waves of different wavelengths travel at different speeds. The fastest waves in a storm are the ones with the longest wavelength. As a result, after a storm, the first waves to arrive on the coast are the long-wavelength swells.

For intermediate and shallow water, the Boussinesq equations are applicable, combining frequency dispersion and nonlinear effects. And in very shallow water, the shallow water equations can be used.

If the wavelength is very long compared to the water depth, the phase speed (by taking the limit of when the wavelength approaches infinity) can be approximated by

:formula_35

On the other hand, for very short wavelengths, surface tension plays an important role and the phase speed of these gravity-capillary waves can (in deep water) be approximated by

:formula_36

where
:&quot;S&quot; = surface tension of the air-water interface;
:formula_37 = density of the water.

When several wave trains are present, as is always the case in nature, the waves form groups. In deep water, the groups travel at a group velocity which is half of the phase speed. Following a single wave in a group one can see the wave appearing at the back of the group, growing, and finally disappearing at the front of the group.

As the water depth formula_38 decreases towards the coast, this will have an effect: wave height changes due to wave shoaling and refraction. As the wave height increases, the wave may become unstable when the crest of the wave moves faster than the trough. This causes &quot;surf&quot;, a breaking of the waves.

The movement of wind waves can be captured by wave energy devices. The energy density (per unit area) of regular sinusoidal waves depends on the water density formula_37, gravity acceleration formula_40 and the wave height formula_41 (which, for regular waves, is equal to twice the amplitude, formula_42):

:formula_43

The velocity of propagation of this energy is the group velocity.

==Models==

Surfers are very interested in the wave forecasts. There are many websites that provide predictions of the surf quality for the upcoming days and weeks. Wind wave models are driven by more general weather models that predict the winds and pressures over the oceans, seas, and lakes.

Wind wave models are also an important part of examining the impact of shore protection and beach nourishment proposals. For many beach areas there is only patchy information about the wave climate, therefore estimating the effect of wind waves is important for managing littoral environments.

A wind-generated wave can be predicted based on two parameters: wind speed at 10 m above sea level and wind duration, which must blow over long periods of time to be considered fully developed. The significant wave height and peak frequency can then be predicted for a certain fetch length.

==Seismic signals==

Ocean water waves generate seismic waves that are globally visible on seismographs. There are two principal constituents of the ocean wave-generated seismic microseism. The strongest of these is the secondary microseism which is created by ocean floor pressures generated by interfering ocean waves and has a spectrum that is generally between approximately 6–12 s periods, or at approximately half of the period of the responsible interfering waves. The theory for microseism generation by standing waves was provided by Michael Longuet-Higgins in 1950 after in 1941 Pierre Bernard suggested this relation with standing waves on the basis of observations. The weaker primary microseism, also globally visible, is generated by dynamic seafloor pressures of propagating waves above shallower (less than several hundred meters depth) regions of the global ocean. Microseisms were first reported in about 1900, and seismic records provide long-term proxy measurements of seasonal and climate-related large-scale wave intensity in Earth&#x27;s oceans including those associated with anthropogenic global warming.

<text>The Senate Watergate Committee, known officially as the Select Committee on Presidential Campaign Activities, was a special committee established by the United States Senate, , in 1973, to investigate the Watergate scandal, with the power to investigate the break-in at the Democratic National Committee (DNC) headquarters at the Watergate office complex in Washington, D.C., and any subsequent cover-up of criminal activity, as well as &quot;all other illegal, improper, or unethical conduct occurring during the controversial 1972 presidential election, including political espionage and campaign finance practices&quot;.

American print news media focused the nation&#x27;s attention on the issue with hard-hitting investigative reports, while television news outlets brought the drama of the hearings to the living rooms of millions of American households, broadcasting the proceedings live for two weeks in May 1973. The public television network PBS broadcast the hearings from gavel to gavel on more than 150 national affiliates.

Working under committee chairman Sam Ervin, the committee played a pivotal role in gathering evidence that would lead to the indictment of forty administration officials and the conviction of several of Richard Nixon&#x27;s aides for obstruction of justice and other crimes. Its revelations later prompted the impeachment process against Nixon himself, which featured the introduction of three articles of impeachment by the Democratic-led House Committee on the Judiciary. Watergate led to Nixon&#x27;s resignation on August 9, 1974.

==Background==

Shortly after midnight on June 17, 1972, five men were arrested inside the DNC offices. The FBI launched an investigation of the incident, and the dogged reporting of two &quot;Washington Post&quot; journalists, Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein, raised questions and suggested connections between Richard Nixon&#x27;s controversial reelection campaign and the men awaiting trial. The White House denied any connection to the break-in, and Nixon won reelection in a landslide. Following confirmation that such a connection did in fact exist, the Senate voted 77–0 in February 1973 to create the Select Committee on Presidential Campaign Activities.

Before the election, the House Banking Committee chaired by Wright Patman (D-TX) held hearings on Watergate but were stymied by Nixon Administration officials. A vote to issue subpoenas in October 1972 failed when several Democratic members joined all Republican members of the committee to oppose the vote. The failure of the committee hearings formed an impetus for action in the Senate.

==Members==
The members of the Senate Watergate Committee were:


The chief counsel of the Committee was Samuel Dash, who directed the investigation. The minority counsel was Fred Thompson. Members of the Senate Watergate Committee&#x27;s professional staff included:

==Hearings==

Hearings opened on May 17, 1973, and the Committee issued its seven-volume, 1,250-page report on June 27, 1974, titled &quot;Report on Presidential Campaign Activities&quot;. The first weeks of the committee&#x27;s hearings were a national political and cultural event. They were broadcast live during the day on commercial television; at the start, CBS, NBC, and ABC covered them simultaneously, and then later on a rotation basis, while PBS replayed the hearings at night. Some 319 hours were broadcast overall, and 85% of U.S. households watched some portion of them. The audio feed also was broadcast, gavel-to-gavel, on scores of National Public Radio stations, making the hearings available to people in their cars and workplaces, and increased the profile of the fledgling broadcast organization.

The hearings made stars out of both Ervin, who became known for his folksy manner and wisdom but resolute determination, and Baker, who appeared somewhat non-partisan and uttered the famous phrase &quot;What did the President know, and when did he know it?&quot; (often paraphrased by others in later scandals). It was the introduction to the public for minority counsel Thompson, who would later become an actor, senator, and presidential candidate.

Many of Watergate&#x27;s most famous moments happened during the hearings. During former White House counsel John Dean&#x27;s four days before the committee, he testified about the cover-up, who was involved including himself and events related to it, including him telling Nixon on March 21 that there was a &quot;cancer on the Presidency&quot;) . Dean confirmed to Inouye that the Nixon White House kept a list of its enemies – including Weicker, who then called for added transparency in the executive branch. Meanwhile, FAA chairman and former White House deputy assistant Alexander Butterfield revealed the existence of the secret Nixon White House tapes and Ervin sparred with former Nixon chief domestic policy advisor John Ehrlichman about whether constitutional law allowed a President to sanction such actions as the Watergate break-in and a break-in at the office of the psychiatrist to Daniel Ellsberg, the former assistant to the Assistant Secretary of Defense for International Security Affairs who had leaked the Pentagon Papers.

==Literary career==

Pearson became the first American to receive the Raymond Chandler-Fulbright Fellowship at Oxford University in 1991. He received the Quill Award from the Missouri Writers Hall of Fame, its highest honor. This award serves as a reminder of the importance of writing and encourages young people to develop their own joy for writing.

Standalone novels include: &quot;Cut and Run&quot; (2005), &quot;The Diary of Ellen Rimbauer&quot; (2001)--(under the nom-de-plume of Joyce Readon, Ph.D.), &quot;Parallel Lies&quot; (2001), &quot;Chain of Evidence&quot; (1995), &quot;Hard Fall&quot; (1992), &quot;Probable Cause&quot; (1990), &quot;The Seizing of Yankee Green Mall&quot; (1987), &quot;Blood of the Albatross&quot; (1986), and &quot;Never Look Back&quot; (1985). Ridley also wrote three Chris Klick mysteries under the pseudonym of Wendell McCall.

&quot;The Diary of Ellen Rimbauer: My Life at Rose Red&quot; was adapted as a film called &quot;The Diary of Ellen Rimbauer&quot; (2003)

To describe how Peter Pan met Captain Hook, Ridley teamed up with his long-time friend, humorist Dave Barry, to co-author &quot;Peter and the Starcatchers&quot; (2004), a prequel to &quot;Peter Pan&quot;; it is published in the US by Disney and by Walker Books in the UK. The novel was adapted as a play, &quot;Peter and the Starcatcher,&quot; written by Rick Elice, which premiered on Broadway at the Brooks Atkinson Theatre in early 2012, and earned the most Tony nominations of any play in history— nine. The play received five Tony awards at the ceremony on June 10, 2012. The play went on a national tour in 2013–14. Pearson and Barry have produced three additional prequels – &quot;Peter and the Shadow Thieves&quot; (2006), &quot;Peter and the Secret of Rundoon&quot; (2007), and &quot;Peter and the Sword of Mercy&quot; (2009). Another &quot;Peter&quot;-related book published by the duo is &quot;Bridge to Neverland&quot; (2011).

Also for Disney, Pearson has written a series of novels set inside Disney theme parks, called &quot;The Kingdom Keepers,&quot; in which five teenagers battle the Overtakers—the evil Disney villains—to keep the parks safe.

Pearson has also written &quot;Steel Trapp: The Challenge&quot; (2008) and &quot;Steel Trapp: The Academy&quot; (2010).

Also with Dave Barry, Ridley Pearson has written &quot;Science Fair&quot; (2008) and three Never Land books: &quot;Escape from the Carnivale&quot; (2006), &quot;Cave of the Dark Wind&quot; (2007), and &quot;Blood Tide&quot; (2008).

<doc id="710281" wikidata="Q282074" url="?curid=710281" title="Surfer Girl">
<text>Surfer Girl is the third studio album by the American rock band the Beach Boys, released September 16, 1963 on Capitol Records. It is largely a collection of surf songs. The LP reached number 7 in the U.S. and number 13 in the UK. Lead single &quot;Surfer Girl&quot;, backed with &quot;Little Deuce Coupe&quot;, was also a top 10 hit.

This was the first album that officially credited Brian Wilson with production. It was also the first in which he used a string section (on &quot;The Surfer Moon&quot;) and employed Wrecking Crew session musicians (on &quot;Hawaii&quot; and &quot;Our Car Club&quot;). Original member Al Jardine, who had been replaced by David Marks in February 1962, contributed to the album and would soon re-join the band full-time when Marks departed in October 1963.

&quot;Surfer Girl&quot; was certified gold by the RIAA in November 1965, indicating over 1,000,000 copies sold. In 2017, it was ranked the 193rd greatest album of the 1960s by &quot;Pitchfork&quot;.

==Background==
The massive success of the Beach Boys&#x27; March 1963 album, &quot;Surfin&#x27; U.S.A.&quot;, granted Brian Wilson the leverage to convince Capitol to allow him full control over the band&#x27;s productions, an unprecedented move in the music industry. Thanks to the band&#x27;s hit single, &quot;Surfin&#x27; U.S.A.&quot;, they had become the preeminent vocal and instrumental group in America. Capitol signed his new girl group, the Honeys, which signaled the label&#x27;s commitment to surf music.

In addition to the Honeys, Wilson was focused on writing or production work with Jan and Dean and Bob Norberg. Still resistant to touring, he had ex-member Al Jardine rejoin the group as his replacement at the band&#x27;s concerts, starting in April. Meanwhile, Jan and Dean released &quot;Jan &amp; Dean Take Linda Surfing&quot;, which featured the Wilson brothers and David Marks as guests on the tracks &quot;Surfin&#x27;&quot; and &quot;Surfin&#x27; Safari&quot;.

==Production==
Wilson produced &quot;Surfer Girl&quot; at Western Studio in Hollywood from approximately May 9 to July 16, 1963. He recalled some of the sessions lasting up to &quot;nine and ten hours, unheard-of periods of time.&quot; The 1990 CD liner notes state that the album&#x27;s ten songs were recorded in one day, but this is unlikely, and since the American Federation of Musicians contracts have been lost, the exact dates and studios are not definitely known.

&quot;The Surfer Moon&quot; was the first Beach Boys recording with a string section. Having recruited members of the Wrecking Crew to help realize his productions with the Honeys, this album also marked the first occasion that those musicians were enlisted for certain Beach Boys tracks – specifically, on two songs, &quot;Hawaii&quot; and &quot;Our Car Club&quot;. Mike Love&#x27;s sister Maureen played harp on &quot;Hawaii&quot; and &quot;Catch a Wave&quot;. Wilson considered the latter to feature his &quot;first big Beach Boy vocal arrangement&quot;.

Other songs recorded in the middle of these sessions included the originals &quot;Back Home&quot;, which was later remade for their 1976 album &quot;15 Big Ones&quot;, and &quot;Black Wednesday&quot;, which was later reworked as &quot;Run-Around Lover&quot; and recorded by the singer Sharon Marie. These were Wilson&#x27;s first recordings at Gold Star Studios.

==Songs==
Three of the tracks are based on pre-existing compositions. &quot;South Bay Surfer&quot; is a rewrite of the Stephen Foster standard &quot;Old Folks at Home&quot;, which Wilson had also recorded with The Honeys in another iteration as &quot;Surfin&#x27; Down the Swanee River&quot;, and would revisit as an instrumental intro to &quot;Ol&#x27; Man River&quot; during the recording sessions for the 1968 20/20 album. &quot;Boogie Woodie&quot; is ostensibly based on Rimsky Korsakov&#x27;s &quot;Flight of the Bumblebee&quot;. &quot;The Rocking Surfer&quot; is a reworking of the Tri-Fives&#x27; 1963 record &quot;Come and Get It&quot;, an arrangement of the Czechoslovakian folk song &quot;Stodola Pumpa&quot; (more popularly known in Southern California as the Good Humor ice cream truck jingle).

Wilson is credited with writing the remaining nine songs on &quot;Surfer Girl&quot;: two by himself (&quot;Surfer Girl&quot; and &quot;The Surfer Moon&quot;), four in conjunction with Mike Love (&quot;Catch a Wave&quot;, &quot;Hawaii&quot;, &quot;Surfers Rule&quot;, and &quot;Our Car Club&quot;), and three individually co-authored with collaborators Gary Usher (&quot;In My Room&quot;), Roger Christian (&quot;Little Deuce Coupe&quot;), and Bob Norberg (&quot;Your Summer Dream&quot;).

&quot;Your Summer Dream&quot; and &quot;In My Room&quot; are the only songs that do not relate to themes of cars or surfing. The two car songs, &quot;Our Car Club&quot; and &quot;Little Deuce Coupe&quot;, were planned to be omitted by Wilson, but this never happened due to Murry Wilson wanting more hits on the album, and so the tracks appeared on both &quot;Surfer Girl&quot; and their next album, &quot;Little Deuce Coupe&quot;.

The lyrics to &quot;Surfers Rule&quot; feature a dig at the group&#x27;s then-biggest rivals the Four Seasons. The Four Seasons would respond with the song &quot;No Surfing Today&quot; on their album &quot;Born To Wander&quot; in early 1964.

==Cover photo==
The front cover of the album depicts the five members of the band carrying surfboards at Paradise Cove in Malibu, California. It was taken at the same session that produced the cover photo for their first album, &quot;Surfin&#x27; Safari&quot; (1962).

==Release==
Lead single &quot;Surfer Girl&quot;, backed with &quot;Little Deuce Coupe&quot;, was issued in the U.S. on July 22, 1963 and reached number 7 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts. After returning from a six-week tour at the end of August, they completed their next album, &quot;Little Deuce Coupe&quot;, in short time. The &quot;Surfer Girl&quot; album followed on September 16 and peaked at number 7 on December 23. &quot;Little Deuce Coupe&quot; was released on October 7, just three weeks after &quot;Surfer Girl&quot;.

&quot;Surfer Girl&quot; was certified gold by the RIAA in November 1965. In the UK, the album was released by EMI Records in April 1967 and reached number 13. It had been held back from release due to the group&#x27;s lesser popularity in Europe, and was then issued to satisfy increased demand for new Beach Boys product.

In 1990, Capitol reissued the album on CD as a single-disc pairing with &quot;Shut Down Volume 2&quot; (1964).
==Retrospective assessments==
&quot;Surfer Girl&quot; was ranked number 193 on &quot;Pitchfork&quot;″s list of the greatest album of the 1960s. Highlighting tracks such as &quot;In My Room&quot; and &quot;Surfer Girl&quot;, contributor Quin Moreland wrote in the entry that &quot;Wilson began to probe the wistfulness at his core, hinting at further genius to come.&quot;

Reviewing &quot;Surfer Girl&quot; in AllMusic, Richie Unterberger highlighted &quot;In My Room&quot; as the most significant track and disregarded the remainder of the album as &quot;surprisingly mediocre filler&quot;.

Music historian Scott Schinder identified &quot;Surfer Girl&quot; as an advancement in &quot;Brian&#x27;s continuing growth as a composer and producer.&quot; He cited &quot;Catch a Wave&quot; as Wilson&#x27;s &quot;most ambitious surf number to date&quot; and &quot;In My Room&quot; as &quot;a startling demonstration of Brian&#x27;s willingness to confront his fears in song.&quot;

<doc id="710288" wikidata="Q2255564" url="?curid=710288" title="Addie Joss">
<text>Adrian &quot;Addie&quot; Joss (April 12, 1880 – April 14, 1911), nicknamed &quot;the Human Hairpin&quot;, was an American professional baseball pitcher. He pitched for the Cleveland Bronchos of Major League Baseball, later known as the Naps, between 1902 and 1910. Joss, who was and weighed , pitched the fourth perfect game in baseball history (which, additionally, was only the second of the modern era). His 1.89 career earned run average (ERA) is the second-lowest in MLB history, behind Ed Walsh, while his career WHIP of 0.968 is the lowest of all-time.

Joss was born and raised in Wisconsin, where he attended St. Mary&#x27;s College (later part of Wyalusing Academy) in Prairie du Chien and the University of Wisconsin. He played baseball at St. Mary&#x27;s and then played in a semipro league where he caught the attention of Connie Mack. Joss did not sign with Mack&#x27;s team, but he attracted further major league interest after winning 19 games in 1900 for the Toledo Mud Hens. Joss had another strong season for Toledo in 1901.

After an offseason contract dispute between Joss, Toledo and Cleveland, he debuted with the Cleveland club in April 1902. Joss led the league in shutouts that year. By 1905, Joss had completed the first of his four consecutive 20-win seasons. Off the field, Joss worked as a newspaper sportswriter from 1906 until his death. In 1908, he pitched a perfect game during a tight pennant race that saw Cleveland finish a half-game out of first place; it was the closest that Joss came to a World Series berth. The 1910 season was his last, and Joss missed most of the year due to injury.

In April 1911, Joss became ill and he died the same month due to tuberculous meningitis. He finished his career with 160 wins, 234 complete games, 45 shutouts and 920 strikeouts. Though Joss played only nine seasons and missed significant playing time due to various ailments, the National Baseball Hall of Fame&#x27;s Board of Directors passed a special resolution for Joss in 1977 that waived the typical ten-year minimum playing career for Hall of Fame eligibility and he was voted into the Hall of Fame by the Veterans Committee in 1978.

==Early life==
Addie Joss was born on April 12, 1880, in Woodland, Dodge County, Wisconsin. His parents Jacob and Theresa (née Staudenmeyer) were farmers; his father, a cheesemaker who was involved in local politics, had emigrated from Switzerland. A heavy drinker of alcohol, he died from liver complications in 1890, when Joss was 10 years old; Joss remained sober throughout his life as a result of his father&#x27;s death. Joss attended elementary school in Juneau and Portage and high school at Wayland Academy in Beaver Dam, Wisconsin. By age 16 he finished high school and began teaching himself. He was offered a scholarship to attend St. Mary&#x27;s College (also known as Sacred Heart College) in Watertown, where he played on the school&#x27;s baseball team. He also attended the University of Wisconsin (now University of Wisconsin–Madison), where he studied engineering. Officials in Watertown were impressed with the quality of play of St. Mary&#x27;s and put the team on a semipro circuit. During his time on the semipro circuit, Joss employed his unique pitching windup, which involved hiding the ball until the very last moment in his delivery.

Connie Mack also sent a scout to watch Joss and later offered the young pitcher a job playing on his Albany club in the Western League, which Joss declined. In 1899, Joss played for a team in Oshkosh, earning $10 per week ($ in today&#x27;s dollars). After player salaries were frozen by team owners, Joss joined the junior team in Manitowoc, which had been split into two teams, as a second baseman and was soon promoted to the senior squad, where he was developed into a pitcher. He was seen by a scout for the Toledo Mud Hens and in 1900 accepted a position with the team for $75 per month ($). While in Ohio he was considered &quot;the best amateur pitcher in the state.&quot; He started the Mud Hens&#x27; season opener on April 28 and earned the win in the team&#x27;s 16–8 victory. He won 19 games for the club in 1900.

===Contract dispute===
Midway through the 1901 season, the Boston Americans of the upstart American League offered $1,500 ($) to Toledo to buy out Joss&#x27;s contract. The St. Louis Cardinals of the National League (NL) matched Boston&#x27;s offer; Toledo rejected both offers. Joss continued to pitch for the Mud Hens and by the end of the 1901 season he had won 27 games and had 216 strikeouts (some sources say 25 games). He became known as &quot;the god of the Western League.&quot;

After the season ended, Joss returned to Wisconsin where he led Racine to the 1901 Wisconsin baseball state championship against Rube Waddell&#x27;s Kenosha squad. He also enrolled at Beloit College and played American football. It was reported that Joss had signed with the Brooklyn Dodgers of the National League as early as August 18 and received a $400 advance ($), but Joss denied receiving any money. Mud Hens owner Charles Stroebel stated that he had signed Joss and other Mud Hens players for the 1902 season on August 12 and that the Western League was under the protection of the National League through September 1901. Before 1901 ended, the Cleveland Bronchos offered $500 ($) to Toledo in exchange for Joss and manager Bob Gilks, who would be a scout for Cleveland. Toledo and Joss agreed and Joss was now a member of the American League, which was paying a premium on baseball talent to rival the National League. Dodgers owner Charles Ebbets invited Joss for a meeting, which Joss declined, and Joss let it be known that he had told Stroebel he would play for the Mud Hens for the 1902 season, and received a $150 ($) advance in February 1902.

In March 1902, Joss signed with Cleveland. Toledo sportswriters took exception to Joss, one writing that &quot;he voluntarily signed a contract [with Toledo] for this season but when Bill Armour of Cleveland showed him the $500 bill he forgot his pledge and sneaked off like a whipped cur.&quot; Stroebel later argued that Joss had returned only $100 of the $150 advance. For not returning the entire advance, Joss was charged with a felony and Stroebel pursued legal action. Joss made his major league debut with the Bronchos on April 26, and two days later he arrived in Toledo to turn himself in, accompanied by Bronchos majority owner Charles Somers, who was also American League vice president. The court set bond at $500 ($). Stroebel also filed a civil suit against the Bronchos, stating that his business had been interfered with, but Stroebel agreed to withdraw his charges in July when he accepted Bronchos pitcher Jack Lundbom.

==Major league career==

===Cleveland Bronchos/Naps (1902–1907)===

Joss made his major league debut with the Cleveland Bronchos (also known as the Bluebirds) against the St. Louis Browns. The Browns&#x27; Jesse Burkett hit a shallow pop fly in the direction of right fielder Zaza Harvey. Home plate umpire Bob Caruthers ruled that Harvey did not make a clean catch, so Burkett was credited with a hit. (Harvey and witnesses said the ball never hit the ground.) Joss finished his major league debut with a one-hitter.

Joss compiled a 17–13 record and 2.77 ERA during his major league rookie season. He led the American League with five shutouts.

On October 11, 1902, Joss married Lillian Shinivar in Monroe, Michigan. Shinivar was in attendance when Joss made his professional debut with the Mud Hens in 1900. The couple had a son, Norman, and a daughter, Ruth. Following the conclusion of the 1902 season, Joss was selected to the All-Americans, an all-star team from the American League who played exhibition games against their counterparts from the National League. To begin the 1903 season, the Cleveland organization changed the team&#x27;s name to the &quot;Naps&quot; in honor of second baseman Nap Lajoie. In Joss&#x27; second year, he went 18–13 and lowered his ERA from the season before to 2.19. His walks plus hits per inning pitched (WHIP) was an MLB-low 0.948.

For the 1904 season, the 24-year-old Joss went 14–10 with a 1.59 ERA and did not give up a home run during the season. Illness during the season reduced his starts. He had his first of four 20-win seasons in 1905 as he ended the season with a 20–12 record and 2.01 ERA. He finished with a career-high 132 strikeouts. In 1906 his 1.72 ERA was third in the league and he finished with a 21–9 record and tied a career-high with nine shutouts. To begin the 1907 season, Joss won his first 10 starts. He threw two one-hitters during the season, the first on September 4 against the Detroit Tigers and the second on September 25 versus the New York Highlanders. When teammate Heinie Berger threw his own one-hitter on September 26, it marked just the second time since 1900 that two pitchers from the same team had thrown back-to-back one-hitters. Joss finished the season with career-bests in wins (finished 27–11) and innings pitched. His win total tied with Doc White for highest in the American League and his WHIP was second-best (behind Cy Young) while both his complete game (34) and shutout (6) totals were third-best in the league.

===1908 season and perfect game===

Before the 1908 season started, the Naps&#x27; home field, League Park, was expanded by about 4,000 seats. The Detroit Tigers, Chicago White Sox, and Naps were engaged in a race for the postseason described as &quot;one of the closest and most exciting known.&quot; Three games remained in the regular season and the Naps were a half-game behind the Detroit Tigers as they headed into an October 2, 1908, match-up against the Chicago White Sox, who trailed the Naps by one game. Game attendance was announced at 10,598, which was labeled by sportswriter Franklin Lewis as an &quot;excellent turnout for a weekday.&quot;

In what proved to be one of the tightest ever pitching duels in a perfect game, Joss took the mound for the Naps, while the White Sox pitcher was future Hall of Famer Ed Walsh. Neither pitcher would give up an earned run in the 1–0 game. Walsh, blistering through his own 39 win season, struck out 15 batters, gave up only one base on balls and allowed only four scattered hits by the Naps. The Naps&#x27; Joe Birmingham scored the team&#x27;s only run, which came in the third inning—the lone, unearned run scored as a result of a botched pickoff play and a wild pitch. The tension in the ballpark was described by one writer as &quot;a mouse working his way along the grandstand floor would have sounded like a shovel scraping over concrete.&quot; Joss, having faced the minimum 24 batters in the first eight innings, retired the first two batters in the top of the ninth. Joss then faced White Sox pinch hitter John Anderson. Anderson hit a line drive that could have resulted in a double had it not gone foul. He then hit a ball to Naps third baseman Bill Bradley, which Bradley bobbled before throwing to first baseman George Stovall. Stovall dug the ball out of the dirt to achieve the final out. With the win, Joss recorded the second ever perfect game in MLB&#x27;s modern era. He accomplished the feat with just 74 pitches, the lowest known pitch count ever achieved in a perfect game. Fans swarmed the field. After the game, Joss said, &quot;I never could have done it without Larry Lajoie&#x27;s and Stovall&#x27;s fielding and without Birmingham&#x27;s base running. Walsh was marvelous with his spitter, and we needed two lucky strikes to win.&quot;

For the season, Joss averaged 0.83 walks per nine innings, becoming one of 29 pitchers in MLB history to average less than one walk per nine innings. His season-ending WHIP of .806 is the fifth-lowest single-season mark in MLB history. The Naps finished with a 90–64 record, a half-game behind Detroit. It was the closest Joss ever got to a World Series appearance.

===Final years with Naps (1909–10)===

After amassing four consecutive 20-win seasons, Joss struggled in 1909 as a result of fatigue; by September he was shut down for the season. Joss finished the year with a 14–13 record in innings pitched and recorded a 1.71 ERA. He finished fourth in the American League in ERA and third in WHIP (.944).

Joss pitched a second no-hitter, on April 20, 1910, against the White Sox, becoming the first pitcher in MLB history to no-hit the same team twice, a feat not matched until Tim Lincecum of the San Francisco Giants no-hit the San Diego Padres in both 2013 and 2014. In the second inning, the White Sox&#x27; Freddy Parent hit a ball toward third base. Bill Bradley failed to field the ball cleanly and thus his throw to first base was not in time to get Parent out. The initial ruling on the field was a base hit but it was later changed to an error. Joss gave up two walks and recorded 10 assists. He made just 13 appearances that season due to a torn ligament in his right elbow. Joss made his last appearance of the season on July 25, and left the game in the fifth inning due to arm soreness. In his final game, he allowed three runs on five hits and two walks with six strikeouts in a 4–0 loss. The Naps finished 71–82. In his final major league season, Joss finished with a 5–5 record in innings. The Naps finished the year 71–81. This marked the fifth time in Joss&#x27; nine years that the franchise finished with a losing record.

===Career marks===
Of Joss&#x27; 160 major league wins, 45 were shutouts. Joss&#x27; 1.89 career ERA is ranked second all-time (to Ed Walsh), while his 0.97 WHIP (walks and hits per inning pitched) is the lowest career WHIP in MLB history. He finished with a 160–97 record, 234 complete games, and 920 strikeouts.

Joss&#x27; repertoire included a fastball, a &quot;slow ball&quot; (today known as a changeup), and an &quot;extremely effective&quot; curve. Baseball historians Rob Neyer and Bill James ranked Joss&#x27; fastball third (1900–1904) and sixth (1905–1909) in the major leagues. George Moriarty explained that Joss had only one curveball because &quot;he believed that with a few well mastered deliveries he could acquire great control and success with less strain on his arm.&quot; In an era filled with spitball pitchers, Joss achieved his success without ever altering the baseball. Joss threw with a corkscrew windup motion, described as &quot;an exaggerated pinwheel motion.&quot; Shortstop Roger Peckinpaugh described his windup: &quot;He would turn his back toward the batter as he wound up, hiding the ball all the while, and then whip around and fire it in.&quot;

Illness and injury accompanied Joss throughout much of his professional career. In 1903, a high fever forced him to miss the last month of the season. He contracted malaria in April 1904 and then missed several starts with a back injury in 1905.

==Journalism and engineering interests==
Joss was concerned about supporting his family after his baseball career ended; many players of the day had little education and few marketable job skills beyond their abilities on the diamond. As sportswriter Franklin Lewis wrote, &quot;Only a handful of players in the rough, stirring, early days of the major leagues arrived from campuses. And when they did, sometimes the shock was too great for them. Some grizzled holdovers from the 1890s were around and they bore down heavily on the eardrums of the so-called college-boy set.&quot; Joss was hired as a sports columnist after the 1906 season for the &quot;Toledo News-Bee&quot;. He also served as their Sunday sports editor. His writings proved so popular that sales of the paper increased and a special phone line was installed in his office to field the large volume of calls he received from fans. The increased popularity gave him an advantage when negotiating with the Naps before the 1907 season, and the club agreed to pay him $4,000 (). (By 1910, player salaries averaged only $2,500.)

He later also wrote for the &quot;Cleveland Press&quot; and covered the World Series for the &quot;News-Bee&quot; and &quot;Press&quot; from 1907 to 1909. The &quot;Press&quot; introduced Joss in columns this way: &quot;Of all the baseball players in the land, Addie Joss is far and away the best qualified for this work. A scholarly man, an entertaining writer, an impartial observer of the game.&quot; Biographer Scott Longert wrote that &quot;the writer was becoming as well-known as the ballplayer.&quot; An editorial in the &quot;Toledo Blade&quot; said, &quot;In taking his vocation seriously, [Joss] was, in return, taken seriously by the people, who recognized in him a man of more than usual intelligence and one who would have adorned any profession in which he had elected to engage.&quot;

During the 1908–1909 offseasons, Joss worked on designing an electric scoreboard that would later be known as the Joss Indicator. The Naps decided to install the scoreboard, which allowed spectators to monitor balls and strikes at League Park.

==Death and benefit game==
Joss attended spring training with Cleveland before the start of the 1911 season. He collapsed on the field from heat prostration on April 3 in an exhibition game in Chattanooga, Tennessee. He was taken to a local hospital and released the next day. As early as April 7, press reports had taken note of his ill health, but speculated about &quot;ptomaine poisoning&quot; or &quot;nervous indigestion.&quot; The Naps traveled to Toledo for exhibition games on April 10 and Joss went to his home on Fulton Street where he was seen by his personal physician, Dr. George W. Chapman. Chapman thought Joss could be suffering from nervous indigestion or food poisoning. By April 9, as Joss was coughing more and had a severe headache, Chapman changed his diagnosis to pleurisy and reported that Joss would not be able to play for one month and would need ten days of rest to recover. Joss could not stand on his own and his speech was slurred. On April 13, Chapman sought a second opinion from the Naps&#x27; team doctor, who performed a lumbar puncture and diagnosed Joss with tuberculous meningitis. The disease had spread to Joss&#x27; brain and he died on April 14, 1911, two days after his 31st birthday and two days after Cleveland&#x27;s season opener.

Joss was well-liked by his peers and baseball fans. Upon hearing of his death, the &quot;Press&quot; wrote &quot;every train brings flowers&quot; and &quot;floral tributes by the wagonload are hourly arriving at the Joss home from all sections of the country.&quot; His family arranged for the funeral to take place on April 17. On that day, the Naps were to face the Detroit Tigers. Naps players signed a petition stating that they would not attend the game so they could instead attend the funeral. They asked for the game to be rescheduled, but the Tigers balked at the request. American League president Ban Johnson initially supported the Tigers&#x27; position, but he ultimately sided with the Naps. Naps owner Charles Somers and 15 Naps players attended the funeral, which was officiated by player-turned-evangelist Billy Sunday.
The first &quot;all-star&quot; game was played as a benefit for Joss&#x27;s family on July 24, 1911. The Naps invited players from the other seven American League teams to play against them. Visiting club players who were involved in the game included Home Run Baker, Ty Cobb, Eddie Collins, Sam Crawford, Walter Johnson, Tris Speaker, Gabby Street, and Smoky Joe Wood. &quot;I&#x27;ll do anything they want for Addie Joss&#x27; family&quot;, Johnson said. Washington Senators manager Jimmy McAleer volunteered to manage the all-stars. &quot;The memory of Addie Joss is sacred to everyone with whom he ever came in contact. The man never wore a uniform who was a greater credit to the sport than he&quot;, McAleer said. The game was attended by approximately 15,270 fans and raised nearly $13,000 ($ today) to help Joss&#x27; family members pay remaining medical bills. The Naps lost, 5–3.
==Recognition==
&quot;Boston Globe&quot; sports editor Jason Nason campaigned for Joss&#x27; induction into the Hall of Fame starting in the 1950s. Sportswriter Red Smith wrote in 1970 in support of Joss. &quot;Could you write a history of baseball without mentioning Joss? Nobody ever has. That ought to be the measure of a man&#x27;s fitness for the Hall of Fame, the only measure.&quot; However, Warren Giles, then-chairman of the Hall of Fame&#x27;s Veterans Committee, pointed out to baseball historian Bob Broeg in 1972 that induction to the Hall required &quot;participation in ten championship seasons.&quot; Joss had been on the Cleveland roster in 1911 and participated in spring training, falling ill just before regular season play commenced. Hence it was argued he had &quot;participated&quot; in the 1911 season, his tenth. The Hall&#x27;s Board of Directors waived the eligibility requirements for Joss. Joe Reichler, a member of the Commissioner&#x27;s office, worked to allow Joss to become eligible for the Hall and succeeded in 1977. Joss was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1978. He is the only player in the Hall of Fame whose regular season playing career lasted less than 10 years.

In 1981, Lawrence Ritter and Donald Honig included him in their book &quot;The 100 Greatest Baseball Players of All Time.&quot; They described what they called &quot;the Smoky Joe Wood Syndrome&quot;, where a player of truly exceptional talent has a career curtailed by injury or illness. They argued that such a player should still be included among the greatest all-time players, in spite of career statistics that would not quantitatively rank him with the all-time greats. They believed that Joss&#x27; career ERA was proof enough of his greatness to be included. Baseball author John Tierney wrote: &quot;Joss is remembered for a remarkably low career ERA, but he pitched in a time before earned runs were compiled as an official statistic, and his career ended in 1910, before the American League introduced its new baseball in 1911, leading to a nearly 25 percent increase in runs scored.&quot;

Joss was inducted into the Cleveland Guardians Hall of Fame on July 29, 2006. He was inducted in the same class as Ray Chapman, Rocky Colavito, Al López, Sam McDowell, Al Rosen and Herb Score.

== Footnotes ==
* Sources differ on the number of one-hitters. Porter states six one-hitters while Schneider lists five. A career summary at the time of his Hall of Fame selection noted seven in total which is consistent with records at the time of Bob Feller&#x27;s eighth one-hitter in 1946.
* Fleitz writes in &quot;Shoeless: The Life and Times of Joe Jackson&quot; that Joss was diagnosed with pleurisy by the Naps team doctor while in Chattanooga. Coffey writes in &quot;27 Men Out: Baseball&#x27;s Perfect Games&quot; while on a train ride back to Toledo, Joss stopped in Cincinnati and was diagnosed by &quot;a doctor&quot; who stated Joss had &quot;congestion in his right lung with a bad attack of pleurisy&quot; and an &quot;affection [sic] of the brain.&quot; Kneib writes in &quot;Meningitis&quot; the Naps were scheduled to go to Cincinnati but Joss did not receive an examination until he returned to Toledo, where he was examined and diagnosed with pleurisy by his personal physician and roughly a week later, seen in Toledo by the Naps&#x27; team doctor who diagnosed Joss with tubercular meningitis.

<doc id="710289" wikidata="Q213809" url="?curid=710289" title="Hermann Rauschning">
<text>Hermann Adolf Reinhold Rauschning (7 August 1887 – 8 February 1982) was a German politician and author, adherent of the Conservative Revolution movement who briefly joined the Nazi movement before breaking with it. He was the President of the Senate (head of government and chief of state) of the Free City of Danzig from 1933 to 1934. In 1934, he renounced Nazi Party membership and in 1936 emigrated from Germany. He eventually settled in the United States and began openly denouncing Nazism. Rauschning is chiefly known for his book &quot;Gespräche mit Hitler&quot; (&quot;Conversations with Hitler&quot;, American title: &quot;Voice of Destruction&quot;, British title: &quot;Hitler Speaks&quot;) in which he claimed to have had many meetings and conversations with Adolf Hitler.

==Early life ==
Rauschning was born in Thorn in the province of West Prussia (then part of the German Empire; now Toruń, Poland) to a Prussian Army officer. He attended the Prussian Cadet Corps institute at Potsdam and studied history, German philology and musicology at the Berlin University, where he obtained a Dr. phil. doctorate in 1911. He fought in World War I as a lieutenant and was wounded in action. 

After the war, he stayed in Poznań, which (like Rauschning&#x27;s home region of West Prussia) was ceded by Germany to Poland after the Treaty of Versailles in 1919. He was active in several organisations of the German minority and prominent in the Poznań historical society. Disagreeing with the leaders of the German minority in the Poznań Voivodeship, he moved to the Free City of Gdansk (which was under League of Nations mandate) in 1926, where he bought an estate in the village of Warnau (Warnowo) in the Vistula Fens and became a farmer.

==Political career==

During the 1920s, Rauschning was close to the &quot;Young Conservative&quot; movement of Arthur Moeller van den Bruck and affiliated with the German National People&#x27;s Party (DNVP) of Danzig. In 1932, he joined the Nazi Party as he believed it to offer the only way out of Germany&#x27;s troubles, including the return of Danzig to Germany. In the 1930 Danzig parliamentary election, the Nazis had become the second-strongest force, replacing the DNVP, as they had discovered the electoral potential of the rural population in Danzig. Rauschning saw this as a powerful tool to reorganize the Danzig NSDAP. Rauschning became the agricultural advisor to the local &quot;Gau&quot; in January 1932 and in February of the same year, leader of the Danzig Agricultural League &quot;(Danziger Landbund)&quot;, a movement that supported the taking over of the Senate by the Nazis. He became also became chairman of the Danzig Teachers&#x27; Association in 1932. 

The President of the Senate, Ernst Ziehm (DNVP) who ruled from 1931 to 1933, strongly disliked Rauschning. In Summer 1932, Rauschning and the local &quot;Gauleiter&quot; Albert Forster met with Adolf Hitler in Obersalzberg to discuss happenings in Danzig. After Hitler came to power in Germany in January 1933, the Nazis in Danzig withdrew their support for the Ziehm Senate and demanded the formation of a new government under the leadership of Hermann Rauschning. Ziehm refused to form a joint government with the Nazis, but he and his Senate resigned en bloc, triggering an early parliamentary election in May 1933. The NSDAP won this election with an absolute majority and Rauschning became the President of the Senate of Danzig on 20 June 1933, starting the Rauschning Senate which—except for the Senator of Justice—consisted exclusively of NSDAP members.

In foreign affairs, Rauschning did not conceal his personal desire to turn neighbouring Poland into a vassal state of Germany. As a conservative nationalist, Rauschning was not typical of Nazi members and the Nazis&#x27; violent antisemitism was alien to him. He was a bitter rival of Albert Forster, the future Gauleiter of Danzig.

There has been some debate over the importance of Rauschning to Hitler and the party. One of the reasons cited for Hitler&#x27;s interest in Rauschning was his citizenship and political leadership in the Free City of Danzig. One of the first questions that Hitler asked Rauschning was &quot;whether Danzig had an extradition agreement with Germany,&quot; which drew Hitler’s attention due to the possibility of him being forced to go underground. Hitler feared that the Weimar Republic might move against the party and ban it. Since Danzig retained an independent status under the League of Nations, Hitler apparently felt that the free port &quot;might well offer a useful asylum.&quot;

==Fall from power==
On 23 November 1934, he resigned from the Senate and the party. In the April 1935 Danzig elections, he supported &quot;constitutionalist&quot; candidates against the Nazis and wrote articles supporting co-operation with the Poles, which angered the Nazis. Rauschning found himself in personal danger.

He sold his farming interests and fled to Poland in 1936. He moved on to Switzerland in 1937, France in 1938 and the United Kingdom in 1939. Rauschning joined German émigrés; left-wing Germans opposed his right-wing views and the fact that as a member of the Nazi Party, he had been instrumental in the takeover of Danzig. Rauschning represented &quot;one of the most conservative poles of the emigration&quot; and enjoyed celebrity status through his lectures. He sought to play a leading role in the more conservative émigré German Freedom Party, run by Carl Spiecher, later of the Centre Party, but he fell out with Spiecher, who thought Rauschning was motivated by self-interest, rather than the interest of the party.

==Later life==
Between 1938 and 1942, he wrote a number of works in German on the problem of the Nazis that were translated to a number of languages, including English. His &quot;Gespräche mit Hitler&quot; (&quot;Conversations with Hitler)&quot; was a huge bestseller but its credibility would later be severely criticised, and it now has no standing as an accurate document on Hitler for historians. However, as anti-Nazi propaganda it was taken seriously by the Nazi regime. At the beginning of the war, the French dropped leaflets on the Western Front containing excerpts from Rauschning&#x27;s writings but with little response. Rauschning&#x27;s ideas of conservative Christian resistance to Hitler met with increasing scepticism and were of no interest to Winston Churchill and his doctrine of uncompromising total war against the Nazis. 

In 1941, Rauschning moved to the United States, becoming an American citizen in 1942 and purchasing a farm near Portland, Oregon, where he died in 1982. He remained politically active after the war and opposed the policies of Konrad Adenauer.

==Writings==

In 1930, he published a work under the title &quot;Die Entdeutschung Westpreußens und Posens&quot; (The Degermanisation of West Prussia and Posen). According to Rauschning, Germans in those areas were constantly put under pressure to leave Poland.

Rauschning&#x27;s writings that were translated into English deal with Nazism, the conservative revolutionaries&#x27; relation to it, and their role and responsibility for Hitler gaining power. By conservative revolution, Rauschning meant &quot;the prewar monarchic-Christian revolt against modernity that made a devil&#x27;s pact with Hitler during the Weimar period.&quot; Rauschning came &quot;to the bitter conclusion that the Nazi regime represented anything other than the longed-for German revolution.&quot;

In &quot;Die Revolution des Nihilismus&quot; (&quot;The Revolution of Nihilism&quot;), he wrote that &quot;the National Socialism that came to power in 1933 was no longer a nationalist but a revolutionary movement&quot; and as the book&#x27;s title states a nihilistic revolution that destroyed all values and traditions. He believed that the only alternative to Nazism was the restoration of the monarchy. His book went through 17 printings in the United States. The book was directed at conservatives in Nazi Germany, whom he hoped to warn of the alleged anti-Christian nature of the Nazi revolution. He would reiterate the anti-Christian nature of Nazism in &quot;Gespräche mit Hitler&quot;, where he has Hitler rule out that Jesus could have been Aryan. Given that Hitler held the exact opposite view, Rauschning&#x27;s intention appears to have been &quot;to put as much distance between Hitler and Christianity as possible&quot;. The main thesis of &quot;The Revolution of Nihilism&quot; that National Socialism was a nihilist pursuit of power with no ideological content is claimed to have unduly influenced Alan Bullock&#x27;s portrayal of Hitler as a cynic in his 1952 &quot;&quot;, as well as that of Bullock&#x27;s rival Hugh Trevor-Roper in &quot;The Last Days of Hitler&quot; (1947).

His success with the publication of his &quot;Die Revolution des Nihilismus&quot; book (&quot;The Revolution of Nihilism&quot;) in early 1938 made Rauschning financially able to pursue his German edition of &quot;Gespräche mit Hitler&quot; (&quot;Conversations with Hitler&quot;) and the other early versions and translations in 1939 and 1940. The first edition of &quot;The Revolution of Nihilism&quot; was printed in German under a Zurich, Switzerland, publishing house (Europa), which was &quot;rapidly followed by ever renewed editions.&quot; Its English translation was published in 1939 and became &quot;the third best-seller on the non-fiction list.&quot;

At the Nuremberg Trials, the Soviet Union presented as evidence (USSR-378) two extracts from &quot;The Voice of Destruction&quot;. Horst Pelckmann, for the defence, asked for Rauschning to be called as a witness on the matter of the party programme relating to the solution of the Jewish question and Hitler&#x27;s &quot;principle to deceive the Germans about his true intentions&quot; so that the prosecution would have to prove that the SS &quot;knew what Hitler actually wanted,&quot; but Rauschning was not called.

==Authenticity of &quot;Hitler Speaks&quot;==
By 2012, the scholarly consensus was that the conversations were not genuine.

The authenticity of the discussions that Rauschning claimed to have had with Hitler between 1932 and 1934, which formed the basis of his book &quot;Hitler Speaks&quot;, was challenged shortly after Rauschning&#x27;s death by an obscure Swiss researcher, Wolfgang Hänel. Hänel investigated the memoir and announced his findings at a conference of the negationist association &quot;Zeitgeschichtliche Forschungsstelle Ingolstadt&quot; (ZFI) in 1983.

The ZFI is a historical revisionist association that, according to one of its leaders, Stephen E. Atkins, is a Holocaust denial institution that is based in Germany. Its conferences and meetings have speakers attempting to trivialize Nazism and denying the guilt for Nazi Germany&#x27;s part in World War II and other culpable activities by Nazis, in close collaboration with periodicals such as &quot;Europa Vorn&quot;, &quot;Nation und Europa&quot;, and &quot;Deutschland in Geschichte und Gegenwart&quot;, who promoted similar viewpoints and goals. Not long after the ZFI conference in 1983, Mark Weber, from the Institute for Historical Review (IHR), considered the mainstay of the international Holocaust denial movement, published an article condemning the &quot;Rauschning memoir as fraudulent,&quot; which led to the Holocaust denial and neo-Nazi community campaign to deny Rauschning&#x27;s writings. As director of IHR, Mark Weber has referred to the Holocaust as a &quot;hoax&quot; and was the former news editor of &quot;National Vanguard&quot;, a neo-Nazi publication of the National Alliance.

The Hänel research was reviewed in the West German newspapers &quot;Der Spiegel&quot; and &quot;Die Zeit&quot; in 1985.

In an effort to undercut the accuracy of Rauschning&#x27;s early account of Hitler&#x27;s anti-Semitic diatribes to &quot;remove millions of an inferior race that breeds like vermin,&quot; Weber wrote:
 The Holocaust hoax is a religion. Its underpinnings in the realm of historical fact are nonexistent—no Hitler order, no plan, no budget, no gas chambers, no autopsies of gassed victims, no bones, no ashes, no skulls, no nothing.

Considered one of the first former Nazi insiders to criticize Hitler&#x27;s plan for world domination and the expulsion of Jews, many of Rauschning&#x27;s most sceptical adversaries have been led by &quot;revisionist historians gathered around David Irving,&quot; who by 1988 was regarded as a proponent of Holocaust denial. In an unsuccessful 2000 libel case, Irving was discredited after he had falsified historical facts in an effort to advance his theory that the Holocaust never happened, where Judge Charles Gray concluded that Irving was &quot;an active Holocaust denier; that he is anti-Semitic and racist and that he associates with right wing extremists who promote neo-Nazism.&quot;

&quot;The Encyclopedia of the Third Reich&quot; also considers that &quot;the research of the Swiss educator Wolfgang Hänel has made it clear that the &#x27;conversations&#x27; were mostly free inventions.&quot;

Other historians have not been convinced by Hänel′s research. David Redles criticized Hänel′s method, which he said consisted of point[ing] out similarities in phrasing of quotations from other individuals in Rauschning&#x27;s other books... and those attributed to Hitler in &quot;The Voice of Destruction&quot; [i.e. &quot;Hitler Speaks&quot;]. If the two are even remotely similar Hänel concludes that the latter must &quot;be&quot; concoctions. However, the similarities, which are mostly slight, could be for a number of reasons... [they] need not stem from Rauschning&#x27;s attempt at forgery.

According to an article by &quot;The Spectator&quot;, Rauschning had taken immediate &quot;notes made by him at the time&quot; during his years with Hitler, which have been considered &quot;not a mere transcript of the notes, but an attempt to reconstruct the conversations noted.&quot;

Although Rauschning had written his book more than six years after his conversations with Hitler, German historian Theodor Schieder remarked that it—

...is not a document in which one can expect to find... stenographic records of sentences or aphorisms spoken by Hitler, despite the fact that it might appear to meet that standard. It is a [work] in which objective and subjective components are mixed and in which alterations in the author&#x27;s opinions about what he recounts become mingled with what he recounts. It is, however, a [source] of unquestioned value, since it contains views derived from immediate experience.

Historian Hugh Trevor-Roper&#x27;s initial view that the conversations recorded in &quot;Hitler Speaks&quot; were authentic also wavered as a result of the Hänel research. For example, in the introductory essay he wrote for &quot;Hitler&#x27;s Table Talk&quot; in 1953, he said:

&quot;Hitler&#x27;s own table talk in the crucial years of the Machtergreifung (1932–34), as briefly recorded by Hermann Rauschning, so startled the world (which could not even in 1939 credit him with either such ruthlessness or such ambitions) that it was for long regarded as spurious. It is now, I think, accepted. If any still doubt its genuineness, they will hardly do so after reading the volume now published. For here is the official, authentic record of Hitler&#x27;s Table-Talk almost exactly ten years after the conversations recorded by Rauschning.&quot;

Trevor-Roper stated that Rauschning&#x27;s account &quot;has been vindicated by the evidence of Hitler&#x27;s views which has been discovered since its publication and that it is an important source for any biography of Hitler.&quot;

In the third edition, published in 2000, he wrote a new preface in which he revised but did not reverse his opinion of the authenticity of &quot;Hitler Speaks&quot;:
&quot;I would not now endorse so cheerfully the authority of Hermann Rauschning which has been dented by Wolfgang Hänel, but I would not reject it altogether. Rauschning may have yielded at times to journalistic temptations, but he had opportunities to record Hitler&#x27;s conversations and the general tenor of his record too exactly foretells Hitler&#x27;s later utterances to be dismissed as fabrication.&quot;

In his biography of Hitler, Ian Kershaw wrote: &quot;I have on no single occasion cited Hermann Rauschning&#x27;s &quot;Hitler Speaks&quot;, a work now regarded to have so little authenticity that it is best to disregard it altogether.&quot; Historian Richard Steigmann-Gall, in &quot;The Holy Reich: Nazi Conceptions of Christianity&quot;, also contends &quot;Hitler Speaks&quot; to be an overall fake.

<text>In the mathematical field of order theory, a partially ordered set is bounded complete if all of its subsets that have some upper bound also have a least upper bound. Such a partial order can also be called consistently or coherently complete (Visser 2004, p. 182), since any upper bound of a set can be interpreted as some consistent (non-contradictory) piece of information that extends all the information present in the set. Hence the presence of some upper bound in a way guarantees the consistency of a set. Bounded completeness then yields the existence of a least upper bound of any &quot;consistent&quot; subset, which can be regarded as the most general piece of information that captures all the knowledge present within this subset. This view closely relates to the idea of information ordering that one typically finds in domain theory. 

Formally, a partially ordered set (&quot;P&quot;, ≤) is &quot;bounded complete&quot; if the following holds for any subset &quot;S&quot; of &quot;P&quot;&amp;hairsp;:

: If &quot;S&quot; has some upper bound, then it also has a least upper bound.

Bounded completeness has various relationships to other completeness properties, which are detailed in the article on completeness in order theory. The term &quot;bounded poset&quot; is sometimes used to refer to a partially ordered set that has both a least element and greatest element. Hence it is important to distinguish between a bounded-complete poset and a bounded complete partial order (cpo).

For a typical example of a bounded-complete poset, consider the set of all finite decimal numbers starting with &quot;0.&quot; (like 0.1, 0.234, 0.122) together with all infinite such numbers (like the decimal representation 0.1111... of 1/9). Now these elements can be ordered based on the prefix order of words: a decimal number &quot;n&quot; is below some other number &quot;m&quot; if there is some string of digits w such that &quot;n&quot;w = &quot;m&quot;. For example, 0.2 is below 0.234, since one can obtain the latter by appending the string &quot;34&quot; to 0.2. The infinite decimal numbers are the maximal elements within this order. In general, subsets of this order do not have least upper bounds: just consider the set {0.1, 0.3}. Looking back at the above intuition, one might say that it is not consistent to assume that some number starts both with 0.1 and with 0.3. However, the order is still bounded complete. In fact, it is even an example of a more specialized class of structures, the Scott domains, which provide many other examples for bounded-complete posets.

<text>Eugénie Grandet () is a novel first published in 1833 by French author Honoré de Balzac. While he was writing it he conceived his ambitious project, &quot;La Comédie humaine&quot;, and almost immediately prepared a second edition, revising the names of some of the characters so that &quot;Eugénie Grandet&quot; then fitted into the section: &quot;Scenes from provincial life (Scènes de la vie de province)&quot; in the &quot;Comédie&quot;. He dedicated the edition to Maria Du Fresnay, who was then his lover and was the mother of his daughter, Marie-Caroline Du Fresnay.

== Background ==
&quot;Eugénie Grandet&quot; is set in the town of Saumur, which would have been familiar to Balzac since he grew up in Tours (about 35 miles away). The two towns are both on the Loire, with châteaux, and of similar size. Tours was much more important historically and politically, which may explain why Balzac allows the impression in the opening that the Grandet residence was Saumur&#x27;s most important building. Though Balzac grew up in the aftermath of the Revolution, he came to adulthood in Paris under the restored Bourbon monarchy (Louis XVIII and Charles X) and wrote most of his oeuvre under the July Monarchy (1830–1848) of Louis Philippe, which came to power when the revolution of 1830 deposed the Bourbon monarchy. Note, given the importance of money in the novel, that though the Republic had replaced the Livre with the Franc (of equivalent value), both currencies continued to circulate, as did the Louis (20 livres).

==Plot summary==
Felix Grandet, master cooper, married the daughter of a wealthy timber merchant at a time when the French Republic had confiscated the lands of the Church in the district of Saumur. When the land was auctioned his wife&#x27;s dowry and his existing savings enabled him to buy substantial property, including some of the best area under vines, all at a very satisfactory price. Though there was little sympathy locally for the Revolution, Grandet rose in esteem and became mayor, later yielding the post under the Empire only because Napoleon had no liking for republicans. At this time his only daughter was ten years old and in that same year more wealth fell into Grandet&#x27;s lap by way of inheritance of the estates of his mother-in-law, grandfather-in-law, and grandmother.

We gradually learn of Grandet&#x27;s miserly habits which included rarely admitting townspeople to his house. The principal exceptions were his banker des Grassins and his notary Cruchot, both of whom understood better than many the extent of Grandet&#x27;s wealth and that since he was 60 in 1819 when much of the action is set, that the wealth must one day devolve on Eugénie. Naturally, they had candidates to marry her in the form of Cruchot&#x27;s nephew President Cruchot de Bonfons who was president of the court of first instance, and the des Grassins son, Adolphe des Grassins. The townspeople take a lively interest in the competition, which is only natural since some sort of inheritance was the major route to prosperity in the early nineteenth century.

Throughout this sequence we are treated to details of Felix Grandet&#x27;s parsimony; this may have developed initially through sheer lack of funds but by now is total vice. He counts out slices of bread in the morning though actually never parting with cash for it since one of his tenants pays part of his rent in kind; most other consumables are supplied in a similar way. Mme Grandet is given no more than six francs at a time for pocket money. Though his house is impressive externally it is old and run-down, and he is too miserly to repair it; their servant Nanon puts her foot through a rotten stair but faithfully saves the bottle she carries. The novel illustrates Balzac&#x27;s belief that money had taken over as the national god. 
On Eugénie&#x27;s birthday, in 1819, Felix Grandet is celebrating with his favoured coterie of Grassinistes and Cruchotins. They are disturbed by a confident knock on the door and a young stranger is admitted, who hands a letter to Felix. It is from brother Guillaume, unseen and unresponsive in Paris for 30 years asking Felix to assist Charles his son to travel to the Indies. Additionally and confidentially, that Guillaume having gone bankrupt, is planning to take his own life. The next day newspaper headline announces the fact of Guillaume&#x27;s death, and debts, which causes Charles to break down. While he sleeps Eugénie reads a letter to his mistress and assumes he is dismissing Annette and planning to marry her: Another letter Eugénie reads impels her to collect up the rare gold coins her father gave her on her birthdays. Later she offers the gold to Charles who asks her to guard a gold dressing case given to him by his mother. Meanwhile Felix had made 14,000 francs on dealing in gold coin and preparations were made for Charles to depart to the Indies. Felix devises a way of profiting from winding up his deceased brother&#x27;s failed business, aided by des Grassins.

After Charles has left (not realising that Felix has swindled him out of his jewelry for a pitiful sum), Eugénie pines secretly for Charles, and is comforted by her mother and Nanon. On New Year&#x27;s Day, Felix asks to see Eugénie&#x27;s store of rare gold coins, an annual tradition. Enraged upon discovering that Eugénie has given them away to Charles, he shuts Eugénie in her bedroom, and gives orders that she is to eat only bread and water, and leave her room only to attend church. Appalled by this, Felix&#x27;s wife, who has been patient, loving and supportive throughout their married life, is physically ground down by their austere life and Felix&#x27;s behaviour towards Eugénie. As she lies ill in bed, she repeatedly begs Felix to forgive Eugénie, but he refuses. 

Felix only changes his behaviour upon being visited by the notary, M. Cruchot, who warns Felix that if his wife dies, Eugénie will be her heir rather than Felix. As such, she would be entitled to demand half of all the property that Felix and his wife jointly own. Felix accordingly becomes more friendly and forgives Eugénie, but his wife continues to get sicker. A doctor tells him that drugs will be of little use: at best, with care, Felix&#x27;s wife will live until the autumn. When she dies, Felix persuades Eugénie to sign away all of her entitlement to her mother&#x27;s share of the joint property: he promises her a pittance of 100 francs a month. Eugénie agrees to this, although Felix subsequently goes back on his promise. 

Years pass, and Eugénie continues her same existence, assuming many of her mother&#x27;s duties in the household. Eventually, Felix himself sickens and dies, leaving Eugénie extremely wealthy. Eugénie lives the next few years in Saumur with her faithful servant Nanon and Nanon&#x27;s husband, M. Cornoiller, and remains unmarried, waiting for Charles. 

Meanwhile, Charles has made a fortune (several million francs) trading slaves in the Americas. He, like Felix, has the Grandets&#x27; fatal flaws: greed and avarice. His business activities include the illegal and the unethical, and he has continuously been unfaithful to Eugénie, whom he soon forgets, blinded by both greed, and by rage at the memory and realisation of Felix having swindled him. Deciding to return to Paris, he decides to marry into a noble but impoverished family, the d&#x27;Aubrions, to advance his social standing. In Paris, M. des Grassins – representing his father&#x27;s creditors – approaches Charles, asking for the balance of the debts. Charles however taunts him, saying the debts are his father&#x27;s rather than his own, and has him thrown out of the room 

Charles then writes to Eugénie of his new engagement, telling her that he does not love his new fiancée, but that love is merely an idealistic dream, and that Eugénie&#x27;s simple country lifestyle is completely incompatible with his own. He also demands the return of his dressing case, and encloses a check for the balance of the gold coins. Eugénie is shocked by this news and cries. She is also visited by Mme des Grassins, who has a letter from her husband, in which, outraged at Charles&#x27;s behavior towards him, he declares his intention to stop protecting Charles from the creditors, and have him officially declared bankrupt, ruining Charles&#x27;s newfound social standing.

Later that day, her priest comes visiting to advise her to fulfill her Catholic duty to marry and produce heirs to her fortune. She decides to marry Cruchot, under the conditions that he must never attempt to consummate their marriage. Cruchot readily agrees, motivated by Eugénie&#x27;s wealth, and ensures they both sign a will under which the deceased spouse leaves their entire fortune to the survivor. 

Cruchot is sent by Eugénie to Paris to pay off Charles&#x27;s creditors in full, ensuring no bankruptcy is called. She also sends Charles a letter agreeing with him that she is indeed very different to him, and their lifestyles are indeed completely incompatible. Charles realises that Eugénie is actually extremely wealthy (having been fooled by Felix&#x27;s miserly behaviour): Cruchot taunts him with the fact that Eugenie is actually far wealthier than Charles. 

Cruchot goes on to become president of the superior courts, but dies before achieving his final ambitions of attaining a peerage, and before Eugénie&#x27;s death, which both he and Eugénie knew he had long hoped for, in order to inherit her wealth. After his death, Eugénie – inheriting Cruchot&#x27;s wealth – remains in the old Grandet household, living as parsimoniously as they had always lived, donating her accumulated wealth to charitable causes.

The novel ends as it begins, with the latest round of suitors paying visits to the Grandet household, in the hope of marrying the wealthy Eugénie.

==Reception==
&quot;Eugenie Grandet&quot; was critically well received when published. So much so that Balzac complained, &quot;Those who call me the father of Eugenie Grandet wish to belittle me. It is a masterpiece, I know; but it is a little masterpiece; they are very careful not to mention the great ones.&quot;

==Themes==
Christopher Prendergast writes &quot;Eugenie&#x27;s story is primarily of interest as the tale of a &quot;rite de passage&quot; from innocence to experience, ignorance to knowledge, illusion to disenchantment.&quot;

Balzac portrays Eugenie&#x27;s father Felix as a miser, and his portrayal is influenced by the character Harpagon from Molière&#x27;s play, &quot;The Miser.&quot; He wrote, “Molière had created Avarice with Harpagon; with Old Grandet, I have created a miser.” Felix Grandet was also part of the new capitalist class that had emerged since the French Revolution. The start of his fortunes occur during the Revolution when he takes advantage of the opportunities at that time, pretending to be a committed Republican. He continues to prosper in the years since the Revolution in spite of all the political changes.

Balzac had initially classified this novel as one of the &quot;Scènes de la vie privée&quot; in &quot;La Comédie humaine&quot; but then later moved it to the &quot;Scènes de la vie de province.&quot; So the novel is a study of life in provincial France, and the interconnection between the private lives of the Grandet family and the public life of Saumur.

==Notable translations==
Fyodor Mikhaylovich Dostoyevsky began his career by translating the novel into Russian, in 1843.

<text>The Colombian peso (sign: $; code: COP) is the currency of Colombia. Its ISO 4217 code is &quot;COP&quot;. The official peso symbol is $, with &quot;Col$&quot;. also being used to distinguish it from other peso- and dollar-denominated currencies.

One peso is divided one hundred &quot;centavos&quot;; however, because of high inflation in the 1970s and 1980s, Colombia ceased issuing centavo coins for circulation in 1984. It remains customary to write monetary amounts with centavos, although it is rare in daily lives and general contexts. The 50 peso coins are still legal tender, but due to its low value and circulation, most cash transactions are rounded to the nearest 100 pesos; while electronic transactions and banking statements are still processed to the centavo, centavos have practically no purchasing power.

Outside Colombia, the currency sees some acceptance in the Venezuelan border state of Táchira.

==History==

Colombia used &quot;Spanish colonial real&quot; until 1820 after independence from Spain was achieved. It was replaced by the &quot;Colombian real&quot;. In 1837, the Colombian real was replaced by the current peso at a rate of 1 peso = 8 reales and was initially subdivided into 8 reales. In 1847, Colombia decimalized the currency and the peso was subdivided into ten reales, each of 10 &quot;décimos de reales&quot;, later &quot;centavos&quot;. The real was renamed the &quot;décimo&quot; in 1853, although the last reales were struck in 1880. The current system of 100 centavos to the peso was first used in 1819 on early banknotes but did not reappear until the early 1860s on banknotes and was not used on the coinage until 1872.

In 1871, Colombia adopted the gold standard, pegging the peso to the French franc at a rate of 1 peso = 5 francs. This peg only lasted until 1886. From 1888, printing press inflation caused Colombia&#x27;s paper money (pegged to sterling at a rate of four shillings to one peso, or 5 pesos = 1 pound) to depreciate and the exchange rate between coins and paper money was fixed at 100 peso moneda corriente = 1 coinage peso. Between 1907 and 1914, coins were issued denominated in &quot;peso &quot;p/m&quot;&quot;, equal to paper pesos. In 1910, the Conversion Board began issuing banknotes in the form of &quot;peso oro&quot;. In 1931, the United Kingdom left the gold standard and the peso shifted its peg to the United States dollar, at a rate of 1.05 pesos = 1 dollar, a slight devaluation from its previous peg, this until 1949. Nevertheless, Peso banknotes continued to be issued expressed as peso oro until 1993.

In 2018, the Congress of Colombia debated whether to redenominate the peso at a rate of 1,000 pesos = 1 &quot;new&quot; peso, removing three zeroes from its face value, in order to make accounting and banking operations easier. A new series of banknotes was introduced in 2016 with the last three zeroes of the denomination replaced by the word &quot;mil&quot; (thousand), this would enable the printing of the same banknotes with the word &quot;mil&quot; replaced by the word &quot;nuevos&quot; (new). The proposal was supported by then President Juan Manuel Santos, but faced opposition due to the high cost it would have and the minimal benefits it would bring, also confusion in a mostly cash-based economy, contracts made, and the possibility of future inflation rending the changes meaningless, though reduction of inflation was not one of the expected outcomes of the redenomination. President Iván Duque did not support the change, and the proposal is currently not considered by the Government.

==Coins==
Between 1837 and 1839, silver , , 1, 2, and 8 real coins were introduced, along with gold 1, 2, and 16 pesos. These were mostly continuations of coins issued before 1837 in the name of the Republic of Colombia but with the escudo denominations replaced by pesos. In 1847, the currency was decimalized and coins were introduced in denominations of and 1 décimo de real in copper and 1, 2, 8, and 10 reales in silver. and real coins followed in 1849 and 1850. In 1853, silver and 1 décimo, and gold 10 peso coins were introduced, followed by 2 décimos in 1854 and 1 peso in 1855, both in silver. In 1856, gold 5 peso coins were added.

Between 1859 and 1862, coins were issued by the Grenadine Confederation in silver for , and 2 reales, , and 1 décimo, and 1 peso, and in gold for 1, 2, 5, 10 and 20 pesos. The United States of New Grenada issued silver 1 décimo and 1 peso in 1861.

Beginning in 1862, coins were issued by the United States of Colombia. Silver coins were struck in denominations of , , 1, 2, and 5 décimos, and 1 peso, together with gold 1, 2, 5, 10, and 20 pesos. With the introduction of the centavo in 1872, silver , 5, 10, 20, and 50 centavos were issued, followed by cupro-nickel centavos in 1874 and cupro-nickel centavos in 1881.

In 1886, the country&#x27;s name reverted to the Republic of Colombia. The first issues were cupro-nickel 5 centavos. Except for silver 50 centavos (also denominated 5 décimos) issued between 1887 and 1889, no other denominations were issued until 1897, when silver 10 and 20 centavos were introduced. Silver 5 centavos were issued in 1902

In 1907, following the stabilization of the paper money, cupro-nickel 1, 2, and 5 pesos &quot;p/m&quot; were introduced and issued until 1916. In 1913, after the pegging of the peso to sterling, gold and 5 peso coins were introduced which were of the same weight and composition as the half sovereign and sovereign. Gold 10 pesos were also issued in 1919 and 1924, with the and 5 pesos issued until 1929 and 1930, respectively.

In 1918, the 1, 2, and 5 pesos &quot;p/m&quot; coins were replaced by 1, 2, and 5 centavo coins of the same size and composition. In 1942, bronze 1 and 5 centavo coins were introduced, followed by bronze 2 centavos in 1948. Between 1952 and 1958, cupro-nickel replaced silver in the 10, 20 and 50 centavos.

In 1967, copper-clad-steel 1 and 5 centavos were introduced, together with nickel-clad-steel 10, 20 and 50 centavos and cupro-nickel 1 peso coins, the 2 centavos having ceased production in 1960. In 1977, bronze 2 pesos were introduced. In 1984, production of all coins below 1 peso ended. Higher denominations were introduced in the following years of high inflation. 5 peso coins were introduced in 1980, followed by 10 pesos in 1981, 20 pesos in 1982, 50 pesos in 1986, 100 pesos in 1992, 200 pesos in 1994, 500 pesos in 1993 and 1000 pesos in 1996. However, due to massive counterfeiting problems, the 1000 pesos was withdrawn by stages. By 2002, the coin was out of circulation.

In February 2009, the central bank stopped the minting of 5, 10, 20 peso coins. They were still legal tender, but due to their low value and circulation, most cash transactions were rounded to the nearest 100 pesos.

In 2012, the Bank of the Republic of Colombia issued a new series of coins with the 500 and 1000 peso coins now struck as Bi-metallic coins.

==Banknotes==
Between 1857 and 1880, five of Colombia&#x27;s then provinces, Bolívar, Cauca, Cundinamarca, Panama and Santander issued their own paper money. Denominations included 10¢ and 50¢, 1, 2, 3, 5, 10, 50 and 100 pesos.

In the early 1860s, banknotes were issued in denominations of 20¢ and 1, 2, 3, 10, 20 and 100 pesos, with all denominations also given in reales. In 1881, the &quot;Banco Nacional&quot; introduced notes for 20¢, and 1, 5, 10, 20, 50 and 100 pesos. These were followed by 50¢ notes in 1882 and 10¢ in 1885. 1,000 peso notes were introduced in 1895 and 500 peso notes in 1900. In 1904, the Treasury took over paper money production, issuing 1, 2, 5, 10, 25, 50 and 100 peso notes, followed by 1,000 pesos in 1908. In 1910, the Conversion Board introduced 50 and 100 peso notes, followed by 1, 2, 5 and 10 pesos in 1915.

More than sixty retail banks issued banknotes between 1865 and 1923. Denominations issued included 10¢, 20¢, 25¢, 50¢, and 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 25, 50, 100 and 500 pesos.

In 1923, the &quot;Banco de la República&quot; monopolized paper money production and introduced notes denominated in peso oro. The first were provisional issues, overprinted on earlier notes of the &quot;Casa de Moneda de Medellín&quot;, in denominations of , 5, 10 and 20 pesos. Regular issues followed for 1, 2, 5, 10, 50, 100, and 500 pesos oro. Twenty peso notes were introduced in 1927.

In 1932 and 1941, silver certificates were issued for 1 and 5 pesos plata, although 1 and 5 peso oro notes continued to be produced. Treasury notes for 5 and 10 pesos oro were issued in 1938, followed by peso oro between 1948 and 1953. Half peso oro notes were also produced by the Banco de la República in 1943 by cutting in half 1 peso notes.

The Banco de la República introduced 200 and 1,000 peso oro notes in 1974 and 1979, respectively, whilst 1 and 2 peso oro notes ceased production in 1977, followed by 10 pesos oro in 1980, 5 pesos oro in 1981, 20 pesos in 1983 and 50 pesos in 1986. 500 pesos oro notes were introduced in 1986 with 10,000 pesos oro in 1992. Production of 100 peso oro notes ended in 1991, followed by that of the 200 pesos oro in 1992 and 500 pesos oro in 1993. In 1993, the word &quot;oro&quot; was dropped. 20,000 peso notes were introduced in 1996, followed by 50,000 pesos in 2000.

In November 2006, the 1,000 and 2,000 peso notes were reduced in size from 140 × 70 mm to 130 × 65 mm, because these notes are frequently replaced due to heavy use.

In December 2010, the Banco de la República issued a 2,000 peso note that now includes the number &quot;2&quot; expressed in Braille in the watermark area.

In 2016, the Banco de la Republica issued a new series of banknotes in denominations of 2,000, 5,000, 10,000, 20,000, 50,000 and 100,000 pesos, with the latter being a new and the highest denomination. These banknotes give continuity of biodiversity present in the new series of coins that began circulating in 2012, while highlighting a group of cultural elements and landscapes of Colombia&#x27;s geography. Additionally, the notes pay tribute to major personalities of culture, science and politics, and reinforces recognition of women&#x27;s important role in Colombian society. The new 100,000 pesos banknote was introduced on 31 March 2016, followed by the 20,000 pesos note on 30 June 2016, the 50,000 pesos note on 19 August 2016, the 5,000 pesos note on 9 November 2016, and the 2,000 pesos note on 29 November 2016. The 10,000 pesos note was issued on 7 December 2016, completing the new banknote series.



==Use in Venezuela==
The crisis in Venezuela has caused an economic crisis in which the value of the bolívar declined rapidly, resulting in hyperinflation. Some areas in Venezuela informally accept the peso for transactions, alongside the United States dollar.

The state of Táchira adopted the Colombian peso as legal tender, and the bolívar is rarely used.
==Unidad de Valor Real (UVR) ==
The (&quot;real value unit&quot;, UVR, ISO 4217 code ) is an accounting currency, maintained by the Banco de la República, that reflects inflation and purchase power. It is used to calculate the cost of housing loans which allows financial entities to maintain the purchasing power of borrowed money.
