<text>The Football Association Challenge Trophy, also known as the [[Isuzu]] FA Trophy for sponsorship reasons, is a men&#x27;s football knockout cup competition run by and named after The Football Association (the FA) and competed by mainly National League teams. The competition was introduced in 1969.

Eligibility rules have changed over time, but from 2008 onwards the competition has been open to clubs playing in Steps 1–4 of the National League System, equivalent to tiers 5–8 of the overall English football league system. This covers the National League, the Southern League, Isthmian League, and Northern Premier League.

The final of the competition was held at the original Wembley Stadium from the tournament&#x27;s instigation until the stadium closed in 2000. The final has been played at the new Wembley Stadium since its opening in 2007. The record for the most FA Trophy wins is shared by Woking and two defunct clubs, Scarborough and Telford United, with three victories each.

The Trophy is currently held by Gateshead, who beat Solihull Moors in the 2024 final held on 11 May 2024.

==History==
The competition was created by the Football Association in 1969 to afford semi-professional teams an opportunity to compete for the chance to play at the Wembley Stadium. Fully-amateur clubs took part in the long-standing FA Amateur Cup, but most of the leading non-league clubs made at least some form of payment to their players and were therefore ineligible to enter the Amateur Cup. The first winners of the competition were Macclesfield Town of the Northern Premier League, who defeated Telford United of the Southern League in the final. Northern Premier League clubs dominated the first decade of the competition, with Telford United the only Southern League team to break the northern clubs&#x27; hold on the competition. In the early years of its existence, the competition struggled to achieve the same level of prestige as the long-established Amateur Cup.

In 1974 the FA abolished the distinction between official professional and amateur status and discontinued the Amateur Cup, and the Trophy soon had 300 entrants. This figure was gradually reduced until by 1991 only around 120 clubs took part. In 1978 the FA moved the final of the Trophy to the Saturday immediately following the FA Cup Final, so as to give it a longer build-up and avoid conflict with clubs&#x27; league programmes, which had previously reduced the competition&#x27;s prestige.

In 1979 the leading Southern and Northern Premier League teams formed the new Alliance Premier League, and teams from this league dominated the Trophy during the 1980s, although in the 1980–81 season Bishop&#x27;s Stortford of the comparatively lowly Isthmian League First Division entered at the preliminary round and won twelve matches to reach the final, where they defeated Sutton United. Telford United&#x27;s win in 1989 made them the second team to win the Trophy three times. Between 1990 and 2000 three more teams claimed multiple wins. Former Northern Ireland international Martin O&#x27;Neill, in his third managerial role, led Wycombe Wanderers to two wins, and Geoff Chapple managed Kingstonian to victory twice and Woking three times, all within the space of seven years. After Chapple&#x27;s period of success, Mark Stimson became the first man to manage the Trophy-winning team in three successive seasons, when he led Grays Athletic to victory in 2005 and 2006 and repeated the feat with his new club Stevenage Borough in 2007.Originally the competition included as many qualifying rounds as were required to reduce the number of teams to 32. In 1999 the format was amended to match that of the FA Cup, with six rounds prior to the semi-final stage, albeit without qualifying rounds. Teams from the Football Conference received byes through the early rounds, in a similar manner to the way in which the leading clubs receive byes in the FA Cup. As of 2001 the competition was sponsored by Umbro; in the 2007-08 season it was sponsored by Carlsberg.

==Format==
The competition is a knockout tournament with pairings drawn at random. Since the 2021–22 season all drawn games are immediately settled via a penalty shootout. This was introduced to ease fixture congestion. 

The Semi-Finals follow the same procedure as the preceding rounds: hosted by the team drawn first out of the hat and decided by a penalty shootout if the scores remain level after 90 minutes.

The Final is held at Wembley Stadium. Thirty minutes of extra-time is played if the scores are level at full-time. A penalty shootout is used if the scores further remain level at the end of extra-time.

As of 2022–23 and the recent non–league restructuring, the competition has featured a maximum of 320 teams representing all clubs from levels 5-8 on the English football league system. The competition features three qualifying rounds (three less than the FA Cup) and eight rounds proper (the same as the FA Cup). Teams from Step 4 (level 8) enter at the first qualifying round stage, those from Step 3 (level 7) at the third qualifying, those from Step 2 (level 6) at the second round proper, and those from Step 1 (level 5) at the third round proper (similar to the FA Cup).

The months in which rounds are played are typical, with exact dates subject to each calendar. The FA pays a cumulative prize fund that rises round-by-round, with exact figures subject to each new edition. See the list of FA Trophy seasons for specific details. 
==Venues==

The final was traditionally held at the original Wembley Stadium, but was moved to Villa Park during Wembley&#x27;s redevelopment, and a final was also played at West Ham United&#x27;s Boleyn Ground. Three replays were required, two of which were held at The Hawthorns, home of West Bromwich Albion, and one at Stoke City F.C.&#x27;s Victoria Ground.

In 2007 the final moved to the new Wembley Stadium, and a record crowd of 53,262 saw Stevenage Borough beat Kidderminster Harriers.

==FA Trophy winners and finalists==
Scarborough (1973, 1976, 1977), Telford United (1971, 1983, 1989), and Woking (1994, 1995, 1997) share the record for the most victories (three) in the final. In 1985 Wealdstone became the first team to win the &quot;Non-League Double&quot; of FA Trophy and Football Conference championship (although in the pre-Conference era both Macclesfield Town and Stafford Rangers had done the double of Northern Premier League championship and FA Trophy in 1970 and 1972 respectively). Since then Colchester United in 1992 and Wycombe Wanderers in 1993 have equalled Wealdstone&#x27;s achievement.

Three Welsh clubs have reached FA Trophy finals; Bangor City (1984), Newport County (2012), and Wrexham in 2013, 2015 and 2022. Wrexham became the first Welsh winners of the FA Trophy in 2013.

==Media coverage==
From the 2004–05 season Sky Sports had a deal to show the final of the FA Trophy. This changed in 2007 when the FA agreed a new deal with Setanta Sports to provide coverage of FA Trophy matches with effect from the 2008–09 season. In March 2013 it was announced that S4C would broadcast the 2013 Final between Wrexham and Grimsby Town.

BT Sport showed the 2015 FA Trophy Final live. BT Sport also showed the 2016 FA Trophy Final between FC Halifax Town and Grimsby Town live on 22 May as part of a double-header along with the 2016 FA Vase Final.

<doc id="698802" wikidata="Q482514" url="?curid=698802" title="Lotus Elan">
<text>Lotus Elan is the name of two separate ranges of automobiles produced by Lotus Cars. The first series of cars was produced between 1962 and 1975 as a rear-wheel drive vehicle. The second series was produced between 1989 and 1995 as a front-wheel drive vehicle.

== Timeline ==
The first range of cars (1962–1975) comprised:
* Two seater sports cars:
** Lotus &quot;Type 26&quot; drop head coupé (DHC) marketed as the Elan 1500, Elan 1600, and Elan S2 (Series 2).
** Lotus &quot;Type 36&quot; fixed head coupé (FHC) marketed as the Elan S3, the Elan S4 and, lastly, in a higher performance model, the Elan Sprint.
** Lotus &quot;Type 45&quot; drop head coupé, replacing the Type 26, delivered in parallel with the Type 36 in S3, S4 and Sprint form.
** Lotus &quot;Type 26R&quot; racing version of the Type 26.
* Four seater sports car (rear seats suitable for children):
** Lotus &quot;Type 50&quot;, fixed head coupé, marketed as the Elan +2.

After the S2 was released the original Elan 1500 and Elan 1600 models were typically referred to as the S1 (Series 1) although the car was never explicitly marketed as such. Today, all models (S1-Sprint) are often cited collectively as the 1960s Elans.

The second range of cars (1989–1995) comprised:
* Two seater sports cars:
** Lotus &quot;Type M100&quot; drop head coupé, initially marketed as the Elan S1 and, later, for the UK market, the Elan S2.

This second model was also produced in South Korea by Kia Motors between 1996 and 1999, rebadged as the Kia Elan.

== Lotus Elan 1500, 1600, S2, S1, S3, S4, Sprint ==
===Overview===
The Lotus Elan was the first Lotus road car to use a steel backbone chassis with a fibreglass body. This style of construction was to be repeated in subsequent Lotus models for nearly three decades. At approximately , the Elan embodied Colin Chapman&#x27;s minimum weight design philosophy. The Elan was technologically advanced with a DOHC 1,558 cc engine, four-wheel disc brakes, rack and pinion steering, and 4-wheel independent suspension. Gordon Murray, designer of the McLaren F1 supercar, reportedly said that his only disappointment with the McLaren F1 was that he could not give it the perfect steering of the Lotus Elan.

In 2004, &quot;Sports Car International&quot; named the Elan number six on the list of Top Sports Cars of the 1960s. The original version of the car was designed by Ron Hickman who also designed the first Lotus Europa as part of Lotus&#x27; GT40 project bid and made his fortune having designed the Black &amp; Decker Workmate.

Because of its successful design and rigorous attention to cost control on the body, chassis, engine and transmission, the Elan become Lotus&#x27; first commercial success and contributed to the funding of its achievements in racing over the next ten years. It revived a company stretched thin by the more exotic, expensive to build, and rather unreliable Lotus Elite, which used a fibreglass monocoque body/chassis and all aluminium Coventry Climax engine.

The original Elan 1500 was introduced in 1962 as a roadster. After a very short production run of just 22 cars the engine was enlarged and the car was re-designated the Elan 1600. An optional hardtop was also offered. The Elan 1600 of 1963 was replaced by the Elan S2 in 1964. In 1965 the Type 36, a fixed head coupé version of the car, was introduced while in 1966 the drop head coupé Type 26 was replaced by the Type 45. Both Types, 36 &amp; 45, were offered initially in S3 form, followed in 1968 in S4 form, and finally in 1970 as the Elan Sprint. Production of the Sprint ceased in 1973. The standard S2, S3 &amp; S4 models were also available in a slightly more powerful and luxurious &quot;Special Equipment&quot; variant, generally referred to as the SE (e.g. Lotus Elan S3 SE).

In the UK the Elan was offered as a fully assembled vehicle and, for tax avoidance purposes, as a lower cost kit for final assembly by the customer.

===Production===
The total production number for the Lotus Elan is not definitively known; however John Bolster, in his book &quot;The Lotus Elan and Europa: A Collector&#x27;s Guide&quot;, provides a number of 12,224 (S1-3: 7,895; S4: 2,976; Sprint: 1,353). This number was occasionally used by Lotus itself. See below for +2 production.

Meanwhile, Paul Robinshaw and Christopher Ross, in their book &quot;The Original 1962–1973 Lotus Elan&quot;, assert that Lotus&#x27; somewhat erratic record keeping at the time meant that vehicle serial numbers were not entirely sequential or consistent. Their assessment suggests the actual count to be in the range 8,676-9,153 (S1: 900; S2: 1,250; S3: 2,650; S4: 2976-3,000; Sprint: 900-1353).

As of April 2018, the voluntary, and thus inevitably incomplete, Lotus Elan registry lists approximately 1,100 known remaining vehicles (including approximately 330 +2 models) in over 30 countries.
===Construction===
The basic structure of the Lotus Elan comprised a fabricated mild steel backbone chassis, similar to a double ended tuning fork, and a fibreglass body. The chassis was the primary stressed component, providing the necessary bending and torsional rigidity. The fibreglass body was solidly bolted to the chassis at 16 points, fitting over it like a saddle. While not highly stressed the body nevertheless added to the overall rigidity of the structure. As such, the chassis should more properly be considered a subframe - it is readily changeable and most Elans on the road today have had a new chassis fitted at some point, either due to accident or decay.

The engine &amp; gearbox are located between the front fork arms and the differential between the rear fork arms. The front &amp; rear suspensions attach to the ends of their respective arms (turrets at the end of the arms hold the suspension springs &amp; dampers).
This design resulted in light weight, high rigidity (by contemporary standards), and easy driver/passenger access through wide door openings with low sills. Driver and passenger protection from front and rear impact was acceptable for its time, but side impact protection was minimal.

==== Drive train ====
The engine, gearbox and differential were all sourced from Ford UK components. See below for details on the engine. The gearbox was a high volume unit used widely across the Ford range (Anglia, Cortina, etc.). Lotus offered regular and close ratio versions. The differential unit was also sourced from Ford but converted for independent rear suspension use (contemporary Ford cars used live rear axles). Three differential ratios were offered at various times during the production life of the vehicle: 3.55, 3.77 and 3.9. Most Elans were fitted with 3.77 differentials. 3.90 differentials, which provided the best acceleration, were often favored by purchasers of early cars, while 3.55 differentials became more common in later cars (especially the more powerful Sprints) to provide more relaxed cruising on newly built highways.
The final drive used four Rotoflex couplings to connect the differential output shafts to the rear hubs. These &quot;rubber doughnut&quot; couplings were widely used at the time for road vehicles (e.g. Hillman Imp, Triumph GT6) and racing (e.g. Ford GT40, Lotus 21), prior to the availability of constant velocity (CV) joints. In the case of the Elan, which had exceptionally supple rear suspension that allowed significant vertical wheel travel, the deformation of the Rotoflexes in operation resulted in some &quot;wind up&quot; of the couplings. This could be readily detected by the driver, especially at takeoff and during gear changes, and was slightly disconcerting when driving an Elan for the first time. In practice drivers typically adjusted their clutch technique within a few minutes and no longer noticed it. In recent years the uncertain quality of replacement Rotoflex couplings, combined with the availability of half-shafts built with CV joints, has resulted in many Elans being converted from Rotoflex to CV joint drive.

A notable feature of the drive train design was its use of standard, mass-produced components in combination with a minimal number of specialized aluminium castings to create a power unit and transmission suitable for a high performance sports car:
#The engine head and timing chest. Converted the Ford Kent pushrod engine into a twin overhead cam engine.
#The differential rear cover &amp; carrier. Converted a live axle to independent suspension operation.
#The rear wheel hubs. Required for the Chapman Strut rear suspension.

These three items were unique to the Elan (although the engine was subsequently used widely in other vehicles).

==== Engine ====
The 1,558 cc &quot;Lotus TwinCam&quot; engine was based on the Ford Kent Pre-Crossflow four-cylinder 1,498 cc engine, with a Harry Mundy-designed two-valve alloy chain-driven twin-cam head. The rights to this design was later purchased by Ford, which renamed it the &quot;Lotus-Ford Twin Cam&quot;. It would go on to be used in a number of Ford and Lotus production and racing models.

Lotus reported different power outputs for the Twin Cam engine during the production of the Elan. Prior to the release of the Sprint the following outputs were reported in the Workshop Manual:


Lotus marketing material from the S3 period quoted the SE variant at , noting high lift cams, carburetor re-jetting and a four branch exhaust.

The final version of the Workshop Manual revised these numbers, as shown in the following tables. The increased power of the Sprint engine was primarily due to slightly larger inlet valves, so it was named the &quot;Big Valve&quot; engine (it has been widely reported that the combination of &#x27;hotter cams&#x27;, rejetting the carbs and big valves improved performance of the 115 bhp SE by only 11 bhp. As a marketing exercise to increase sales of the new Sprint model, Chapman saw to it that published bhp figures for existing models be downgraded to increase the apparent improvement in performance):

==== Suspension, steering, braking ====
The Elan utilized modern technologies for its suspension, steering and brakes. The overall design was simple and easily maintained. In common with many Lotus cars they were perhaps the Elan&#x27;s most highly regarded features.
*&quot;Front suspension:&quot; The front suspension was based on Triumph wheel uprights &amp; steering components while the remaining pieces were of Lotus design. The layout was a classic double wishbone arrangement with coilover springs and shock absorbers. Each &quot;wishbone&quot; consisted of two separate arms, with the upper pair connected to a ball joint at the top of the suspension upright and the bottom pair connected to a trunnion joint at the base of the upright. The bottom pair also held the base of the shock absorber and coil spring assembly (the top being connected to its chassis suspension tower). Similarly, the steering was of classic rack and pinion design, the Triumph rack (originally acquired from Alford &amp; Alder) being modified for the Elan&#x27;s narrow track with custom track rods and rack collars that set the minimum turning radius. The steering, 2 turns lock-to-lock, was not power assisted, which allowed for the visceral steering feel for which the Elan was famous.
*&quot;Rear suspension:&quot; The Chapman Strut rear suspension was designed and manufactured by Lotus. A single brazed &quot;A frame&quot; wishbone was bolted to each side of the base of a cast aluminum upright/wheel-hub, and to the chassis at two, widely set, points. The shock absorber and coil spring strut was integrated into the upright and bolted via a rubber &quot;Lotocone&quot; coupling to its chassis suspension tower. This resulted in a simple design with just three chassis connection points.
*&quot;Brakes:&quot; The disc brakes ( front and rear) were supplied by Girling. Most Elans used a single hydraulic circuit although Federal cars were fitted with dual circuits. Early Elan brake systems were not servo assisted, but servos were fitted to SE and later models. In practice the Elan was light enough that power assistance for the brakes was not required, so the provision of servo assistance may have offered a marketing benefit as much as a functional benefit.

==== Major component suppliers ====
Lotus relied heavily on suppliers of mass-produced parts to create the Elan. These included:
*Engine/Gearbox/Differential from Ford UK.
*Front suspension and steering from Triumph (Herald/Spitfire/Vitesse).
*Electrical systems from Lucas (dynamo, starter, wiring, relays, ignition, lighting, etc.).
*Instrumentation &amp; other electrical from Smiths (speedometer, tachometer, heater, etc.).
*Carburetors from Weber, Dell&#x27;Orto and Zenith-Stromberg (depending on model).
*Brakes from Girling.

==== Weight ====
As with all Lotus cars, attention to minimizing weight was a major factor during the Elan&#x27;s design and manufacture. Its diminutive size (while offering room for drivers over tall and practical luggage carrying capacity) provided the foundation for its low weight.

The Workshop Manual lists the following weights:

Lotus marketing material from the S1 period quoted the weight as &quot;11 cwt&quot; () and from the S3 period quoted as &quot;from 1,232 lb&quot; (558 kg).

Meanwhile, reported weights in magazine road tests varied from (Elan 1600, Cars Illustrated, August 1964) to (S4 FHC SE, Road &amp; Track, January 1969).

The figures above show that the weight of the vehicle changed during its production lifetime, in general tending to increase. Additional features such as electric windows, more luxurious carpeting, and larger wheels and tyres all contributing to the gain.

==== Sub assemblies ====

*Chassis: - anecdotal reports in www.lotuselan.net suggest that the weight was around .
*Body: (per contract with S. Bourne &amp; Co for early body shell construction, with subsequent variations due to DHC/FHC and S1-4 model differences).
**Door shell (without window assembly): 
**Hood/bonnet: 
**Boot/trunk lid: 
*Engine: .
*Gearbox: .
*Differential: .

===Performance===
The performance of the Elan was derived from the combination of its powerful engine (by contemporary standards) and light weight. The roadholding and agility of the car also meant that high speeds could be maintained on corners, which allowed for high average speeds.
By contemporary standards, the Sprint was an exceptionally rapid car and quite lived up to its name. It embarrassed almost every other supercar at the time in terms of outright acceleration up to about 90 mph. This electrifying performance was accentuated by the brilliant handling and road holding, allied to the small size and weight of the Elan, which meant that a well driven Elan on a dry road could outclass any other non-Lotus road car.

Although performance results achieved by testers are affected by many variables (e.g. differential ratio, weather/road conditions, gross vehicle weight, DHC vs. FHC, etc.) the following tables provide an overview of the car&#x27;s capabilities.

The following excerpt from Robinshaw &amp; Ross summarizes Elan performance for each Series:


A few additional figures for the Sprint:
=== Reviews ===
The Elan was widely admired and praised by customers and reviewers, noted for its exceptional handling, roadholding, steering, acceleration, braking and comfort:
&quot;Car and Driver&quot;: The Elan very simply represents the sports car developed in tune with the state of the art. It comes closer than anything else on the market to providing a Formula car for ordinary street use. And it fits like a Sprite, goes like a Corvette, and handles like a Formula Junior. Driving it is very simply another sort of automotive experience altogether. Most people tend to come back from their first ride a little bit glassy-eyed...
&quot;Road and Track&quot;: The light and tactile steering, combined with supple suspension and a weird, physics-defying sense of zero weight transfer in corners, provides a sensation akin to flying just over the ground. I&#x27;m convinced there&#x27;s a powerful pleasure center in the brain that remains untapped until you drive an Elan. It&#x27;s almost a drug.
&quot;Motor Sport&quot;: The tremendously responsive steering and handling requires similar qualities from the driver and the speeds achieved round corners and on the straight are deceptively fast. This, therefore, calls for a lot of concentration on the driver&#x27;s part. Once mastered, however, the Elan is the nearest thing to a single-seater racing car one is likely to be able to drive comfortably on the road. To master the car and explore its tremendous handling potential along that delightfully twisty piece of road one knows so well is close on perfection for the sporting motorist.

====Influence====
While the structure of the Elan followed an entirely traditional approach for sports cars of the time - front engine, rear wheel drive - its design included novel ideas that found their way into the designs of other manufacturers&#x27; vehicles.

Examples include:
*The Mazda MX-5 (Mazda Miata in North America). The original Elan is usually credited as being the design inspiration for this sports car in 1989. Two Elans were intimately evaluated by Mazda in the process of designing the MX-5.
*The Toyota 2000GT. This sports car used a chassis that bears a striking resemblance to the Lotus Elan.

The car designer and engineer Gordon Murray said &quot;Series 3 Lotus Elan... it&#x27;s still, in my opinion, probably the best-handling sports car that&#x27;s ever been made... If anybody wants to know what good steering is, just jump in the 60s Elan.&quot;

====Owners, drivers and in the media====
This generation of the two-seater Elan was famously driven by Diana Rigg in the character of Emma Peel in the 1960s British television series &quot;The Avengers&quot;.

The reference to a car accident in the Beatles song &quot;A Day in the Life&quot; was apocryphally based on Tara Browne&#x27;s fatal accident in his Lotus Elan.

Famous celebrities, past &amp; present, who owned and/or drove a Lotus Elan include:
*Peter Sellers - English comedian.
*Jim Clark - Scottish racing driver.
*Paul Newman - American actor.
*Jay Leno - American TV personality.
*Michael Crawford - English actor, singer, comedian.
*Noel Redding - English rock musician (Jimi Hendrix Experience &amp; Fat Mattress).

===Racing===
Despite the fact that the Lotus Elan has been (and continues to be) used extensively for racing it was Lotus&#x27; first car that was not designed with racing in mind. (The earlier Lotus Elite was designed as a road car and also to compete in high-efficiency classes at Le Mans.) Nevertheless, because owners assumed that all Lotus cars were designed for racing, it soon found its way onto the track, however unsuitable. Lotus resisted modifying the car to make it more suitable for racing but eventually created a racing version of the Elan. Robinshaw/Ross quote Colin Chapman:&quot;When we announced the Elan we said &#x27;This is a touring car, it is not intended for racing and have done no competition development on it.&#x27; The fact that customers bought them and tried to race them was originally no concern of ours, but in the second year we thought, well, if these people insist on racing them then we&#x27;d better get down to some proper development. They were too softly sprung, too softly damped, tore their doughnuts apart and had all sorts of drama, but it was the name, and people thought they must be racing cars.&quot;

The result of the &quot;proper development&quot; was the Type 26R version of the Elan, offered from 1964 at £1995 in kit form.
Motor Sport: &quot;Mechanically, the 26R differed by featuring racing lightweight competition-spec wishbones, sliding spline driveshafts in place of rubber joints, bigger anti-roll bars and a degree of reinforcement around the suspension pick-up points. Pedals were repositioned to aid heel-and-toeing, dual circuit brakes with twin master cylinders and light alloy calipers coming as standard. As did a 140bhp Cosworth-tuned &#x27;four&#x27; although up to 160bhp was offered in time.&quot;

Other changes included flared wheel arches, which allowed for larger wheels and tyres, and a lighter body shell.

===Series (model) differences===

The table below provides a simplified summary of Elan updates and changes associated with each Series. It is notable that the fundamentals of the car changed very little during its eleven years of production.

Each Series provided a general refresh of the car, incorporating new, modern features (e.g. electric windows, larger tyres, power washers &amp; windows, hazard &amp; reversing lamps) and updated cosmetics (e.g. improved sound proofing and carpeting, improved DHC hood (roof) design, Sprint color scheme).

However, as a low volume manufacturer, Lotus&#x27; processes were flexible enough to change the components used during construction at will. As a result, significant variations could exist between cars of the same Series.

Ongoing changes were frequently necessary for a variety of reasons: component availability from suppliers; price changes; the need to meet regulatory requirements (especially for Federal vehicles); model year enhancements; and the phase-in &amp; phase-out of stock during the transition to the next Series.

Lotus promoted the potential variation between vehicles by stating in its documentation: &quot;Lotus policy is one of continuous product improvement and the right is reserved to alter specifications at any time without prior notice.&quot;

==== Price ====
The price of the Elan changed during its production lifetime. At announcement, in October 1962, the fully built cost was £1,499, although between 1963 and 1966 the factory price was generally 5-10% lower. By the end of production, in April 1973, the fully built cost had increased to £2,436.

However, throughout its production the Elan was also available in the UK in &quot;kit&quot; form. This was provided for tax avoidance reasons and required the customer to complete the final assembly of the vehicle. The tax savings were considerable, the prices above being reduced to £1,095 and £2,044 respectively.

Kit versions of the Elan were as complete as possible while adhering to tax regulations. The entire chassis, body, electrical systems, final drive/suspension and all trim were delivered fully assembled to the customer. Final construction involved installation of:
*Engine, gearbox &amp; prop shaft.
*Front wheel hubs, springs/shock absorbers &amp; anti-roll bar.
*Exhaust.
*Wheels/tyres.
*Battery.
*Radiator &amp; hoses.

For the typical Lotus customer, an auto enthusiast, final assembly would be undertaken willingly.
When complete the owner would take the car to a Lotus dealer who, after checking that the assembly had been performed correctly, initiated the warranty period. This feature of Elan purchase was quite heavily promoted by Lotus, with print advertisements showing how simple and rewarding it was to complete the construction.

==== Comparative pricing ====
&#x27;The Motor&#x27; magazine regularly printed prices for all UK cars. A partial extract from its pages provides comparative pricing for several sports cars of the Elan S1 period. The table also shows that the Elite was significantly more expensive than the Elan:

===Collectibility===
1960s/70s Elans are now passing half a century old and, as a well respected Lotus and a fine example of Colin Chapman&#x27;s design philosophy, are valued today as collectors&#x27; vehicles. In the UK they have an almost cult-like status among auto enthusiasts, commanding higher prices than elsewhere in the world.
An undocumented number of right hand drive (UK market) Elans have been privately exported to Japan, where they are admired by collectors. As with many English sports cars of the period there are dedicated enthusiasts around the world, especially in Australia, Canada and the USA.

The simple design of the car, with nearly all parts being readily replaceable, makes it well suited for the collector market. New chassis, bodies and drive train components are all available. There are numerous suppliers of Elan parts and restoration services, worldwide. Conveniently, the fibreglass body is immune to rust.

==== Current Values ====
Current values vary widely around the world, so the following table provides approximate figures for the UK, based on condition. Early cars (S1 &amp; S2) and Sprints are more highly valued than S3s, which are more highly valued than S4s.

Generally, Drop Head Coupés have been more highly valued than Fixed Head Coupés and in the past it was not uncommon to convert FHCs to DHCs, making FHCs rarer. This has tended to stabilize the value of FHC cars.

On 25 February 2023, Silverstone Auctions Ltd. auctioned seven fully restored Lotus Elans, each featuring a well regarded provenance, from the Piddington Collection. The prices fetched, before 12.5% buyers premium and VAT were:

* 1975 Sprint FHC last ever Elan - £40,000
* 1971 Sprint DHC ex-Ron Hickman - £58,000
* 1969 S4 FHC ex-Jochen Rindt - £58,000
* 1966 S3 DHC ex-Diana Rigg (Emma Peel/Avengers) - £146,000
* 1968 S3 DHC ex-Rob Walker - £44,000
* 1968 S4 FDC ex-Keith Duckworth - £32,000
* 1966 S3 DHC ex-Peter Sellers - £66,000

&quot;Chassis - Engine Bay:&quot;
== Elan +2 ==
===Overview===
An Elan +2 was introduced in 1967 with a longer wheelbase and wider track, and two small rear seats, suitable for children. While the Elan was a two-seater sports car marketed to the single man/woman or young couple, the +2 was larger and considerably more luxurious vehicle marketed to the established family with children. Reviews reflected this new marketplace for Lotus. Motor Sport magazine reported the design goal as: &quot;it was decided to increase the interior dimensions considerably to meet the car&#x27;s maxim that it &quot;must be capable of transporting two adults and two children 1,000 miles in comfort with their luggage&quot;&quot;.
In 1971 Colin Chapman bought Moonraker Marine / JCL and in 1974 Brian Davey working with the Naval Architect Don Shead on a new boat design was asked to help redesign the replacement for the Europa. This was finally designed by Giugiaro of Italdesign and called the Esprit which started production in 1976.

While the Elan ceased production in 1973 the Elan +2 continued to be produced until 1975.

===Construction===
Aside from the increase in size necessary to accommodate two additional seats, the design of the Elan +2 was extremely similar to the two seater Elan. The concept of a backbone chassis with fibreglass body, powered by a Ford UK-derived drive train was maintained. Double wishbone and Chapman Strut front/rear suspension of identical design was also used, with some components (e.g. rear hubs) shared with the two seater Elan and others (e.g. wishbones) increased in size. Power assisted brakes were standard, dual circuit in some markets.

In 1968 a more luxurious version of the Elan +2 was released, named the +2S.

In 1971 +2S was upgraded to include the Big Valve engine, and then named the +2S 130. Later models of the +2S 130 were provided with a 5-speed Austin Maxi based gearbox, which greatly improved its high speed cruising capabilities, named +2S 130/5.

===Performance===
*Tested maximum power: net (depending on the model).
*Top speed: .
*Acceleration: in 7.9 seconds, in 21.8 seconds.

===Production===
As with the two seater Elan, the exact number of +2s produced is unknown. The estimated total is approximately 5,200. However, John Bolster&#x27;s &quot;The Lotus Elan and Europa: A Collector&#x27;s Guide&quot; provides a number of 3,300. Fewer than 1,200 of these cars remain on the roads today.

== Elan (M100) ==

The Lotus M100 series Elan was launched in August 1989, reviving the Elan nameplate after 14 years. A two-seater convertible sports car with front-wheel drive, designed in-house by Lotus, it featured an engine and manual transmission supplied by Isuzu, and was built with the development and testing resources of General Motors. Around £35 million (about $55 million) was invested in its development, more than any other car in Lotus history. Its design, featuring a fibreglass composite body over a rigid steel backbone chassis, was true to Lotus founder Colin Chapman&#x27;s original philosophy of achieving performance through low weight, and the name &quot;Elan&quot; connected the car with its 1960s ancestor.

=== Origins ===
In 1986 the purchase of Lotus by General Motors provided the financial backing to develop a new, small, affordable car in the same spirit as the original Elan (last built in December 1972). A development prototype, the M90 (later renamed the X100) had been built a few years earlier, using a fibreglass body designed by Oliver Winterbottom and a Toyota-supplied 1.6-litre engine and transmission. The M90 was in turn preceded by an earlier two-seater project in 1974 called the Lotus M80, also designed by Winterbottom and based on the Lotus Eclat. However, money was in short supply at Lotus and development was soon stopped, with the M80 name later resurfacing on the 1984 Lotus Eminence M80 four-door V8 saloon concept. Lotus was hoping to sell the car through Toyota dealerships worldwide, badged as a Lotus Toyota, but the project never came to fruition and the prototype was shelved (although Lotus&#x27; collaboration with Toyota had some influence on the design of the Toyota MR2).

The idea of a small roadster powered by an outsourced engine remained, however, and in late 1986 Peter Stevens&#x27;s design for the Type M100 was approved and work began by Lotus engineers to turn the clay styling buck into a car that could be built. This process was completed in just under three years.

==== Testing ====
The new Elan was conceived as a mass-market car and in particular one that would appeal to US buyers. Consequently, Lotus put an enormous effort (for such a small firm) into testing the car; over a two-year period 19 crash cars and 42 development vehicles were built, logging nearly a million test miles in locations from Arizona to the Arctic. The Elan was driven at racing speeds for 24 hours around the track at Snetterton. Finally each new car was test-driven for around at Lotus&#x27; Hethel factory to check for any manufacturing defects before being shipped to dealers.

==== Handling ====
The choice of front-wheel drive is unusual for a sports car, but according to Lotus sales literature, &quot;for a given vehicle weight, power and tyre size, a front wheel drive car was always faster over a given section of road. There were definite advantages in traction and controllability, and drawbacks such as torque steer, bump steer and steering kickback were not insurmountable.&quot; This was the only front-wheel-drive vehicle made by Lotus. Every model made since the M100 Elan, such as the Lotus Elise, has been rear-wheel drive.

The M100 Elan&#x27;s cornering performance was undeniable (on release the Elan was described by &quot;Autocar&quot; magazine as &quot;the quickest point to point car available&quot;). Press reaction was not uniformly positive, as some reviewers found the handling too secure and predictable compared to a rear-wheel-drive car. However, the Elan&#x27;s rigid chassis minimised roll through the corners and has led to many critics describing it as &#x27;the finest front wheel drive [car] bar none&#x27;. Unlike the naturally aspirated version, the turbocharged SE received power steering as standard, as well as tyres with a higher ZR speed rating.

==== Engine ====
The M100 Elan used a 1,588 cc double overhead camshaft (DOHC) I4 16-valve engine, sourced from the Isuzu Gemini and extensively modified by Lotus (a third generation of this engine was later used in the Isuzu Impulse), which produced in turbocharged form. 0–60 mph acceleration time was measured by &quot;Autocar&quot; and &quot;Motor&quot; magazine at 6.5 seconds, and a top speed of was recorded.

Significant differences in the Isuzu-Lotus engine from the original include a new exhaust system, re-routed intake plumbing for better thermodynamic efficiency, improved engine mounting, and major modifications to the engine control unit to improve torque and boost response. Almost all models featured an IHI turbocharger.

==== Braking and suspension components ====

The majority of the suspension items for the M100 Elan (both S1 and S2) were manufactured and supplied by Portland Engineering based in Dorset in the UK. They supplied front and rear brake discs, rear suspension arms, front and rear hub carriers along with numerous other components. The rear brakes had an unusual design in that the rear hub was incorporated within the brake disc.

=== Sales ===

Two variants were available at launch, the Elan 1.6 (retailing at £17,850) and the Turbo SE (£19,850). Initial sales were disappointing, due to the debut of the more affordable &quot;nostalgic&quot; Mazda MX-5 which was arguably similar in concept to the 1960s Elan, in contrast to the M100&#x27;s deliberately futuristic cant. The Elan was very expensive to make (the cost to design and produce the dashboard alone was more than the total cost of the Excel production line), and sales figures were too low to recoup its huge development costs.

Altogether just 3,855 Elans were built between November 1989 and July 1992, including 129 normally aspirated (non-turbo) cars. A mere 559 of them were sold in the US, featuring a &#x27;stage 2 body&#x27; which had a different rear boot spoiler arrangement together with a lengthened nose to accommodate a USA-compliant crash structure and airbag, and 16-inch wheels (optional in most markets, standard in the U.S.) instead of 15-inch as on the UK model. A coupé version of the Elan, to replace the Excel, had also been in the pipeline. This, too, was shelved, and there was no direct successor to the Excel, which ended up also being discontinued in 1992.

=== Series 2 ===
Two years after the end of the original production run, a limited edition of 800 Series 2 (S2) M100 Elans was released during the Romano Artioli era (produced June 1994–September 1995) when it was discovered that enough surplus engines were available to make this possible. It was only for the UK market. According to Autocar magazine, the S2 addressed some of the concerns over handling, but power was reduced to and the 0–60 mph acceleration time increased to 7.5 seconds, due to the legislative requirement to fit a catalytic converter in all markets. The S2s have very similar performance to the USA vehicles, having an identical engine management system calibration albeit with a slightly lower overall vehicle weight.

=== Kia Elan ===

After the final production run of the Elan in 1995, Lotus sold its production rights to Kia Motors, which produced its own version. Outwardly, the Kia Elan looks almost identical to the original. The most obvious difference are the Kia-designed taillights which replaced the Renault Alpine GTA rear lights of the original.

Kia Motech (Kia Motor-technology) produced the car in Ansan, South Korea from 1996 to 1999 as the Kia Elan for the Korean market, using a 1.8 L &quot;T8D&quot; engine of Mazda origins instead of the Isuzu 1.6 turbo-charged unit. In the Japanese market, the car was sold as the Vigato. A total of 1,056 were produced.

== 2013 Elan concept show car ==
A new Lotus Elan was announced at the 2010 Paris Motor Show. It was hoped to be in production by 2013, but it, alongside the Esprit and Elite concepts, was cancelled before it could enter production. The car was to have featured a 4.0-litre V6 engine with around 350 horsepower, a 0-60 time of 4.5 seconds, a top speed of 165 mph, and was to have weighed roughly . The car was also meant to have a new kinetic energy recovery system (KERS) which would provide short bursts of extra passing power using energy recovered during braking.

<text>Gaston Lachaise (March 19, 1882 – October 18, 1935) was a French-born sculptor, active in America in the early 20th century. A native of Paris, he is most noted for his robust female nudes such as his heroic &quot;Standing Woman&quot;. Gaston Lachaise was taught the fundamentals of European sculpture while living in France. While still a student, he met and fell in love with an older American woman, Isabel Dutaud Nagle, then followed her after she returned to America. There, he became profoundly impressed by the great vitality and promise of his adopted country. Those life-altering experiences clarified his artistic vision and inspired him to define the female nude in a new and powerful manner. His drawings, typically made as ends in themselves, also exemplify his remarkably new treatment of the female body.

==Early life and education==
Born in Paris, Lachaise was the son of Marie Barré (1856–1940), herself the daughter of a sculptor and Jean Lachaise (1848–1901), a cabinetmaker who designed furniture for the private apartment of Gustave Eiffel in the Eiffel Tower, among other commissions. At age 13 he entered a craft school, the École Municipale Bernard Palissy, where he was trained in the decorative arts, and from 1898 to 1904 he studied sculpture at the École des Beaux-Arts under Gabriel-Jules Thomas. He began his artistic career as a modeler for the French Art Nouveau designer René Lalique.

==Move to America==
Around 1902 or 1903 he met and fell in love with Isabel Dutaud Nagle (1872–1957), a married American woman of French Canadian descent (she eventually divorced her husband and married Lachaise). When she returned to her home near Boston in 1904, Lachaise vowed to follow her. After briefly working for the master jewelry and glass designer René Lalique in order to pay for his passage, he arrived in America in 1906, never to return to his native land. For the next fifteen years he earned a living as a sculptor&#x27;s assistant. At first, in Boston and Quincy, Massachusetts, he worked for H. H. Kitson, an academic sculptor who was chiefly producing military monuments. In 1912 Lachaise moved to New York City to help Kitson in his studio at 7 MacDougal Alley. Soon after that, he went to work as an assistant to the sculptor Paul Manship, while also creating his own art. His employment with Paul Manship lasted until 1921. (Later examples of the work of both sculptors can be seen at Rockefeller Center.)

Lachaise rented many studios in Greenwich Village, namely 45 Washington Square South (1912–1913/1914, razed), 10 West 14th Street (1917–1919/1921, still standing), 461 6th Avenue (1921–1923, still standing), 20 West 8th Street (1924–1926, razed), 55 West 8th Street (1927–1933, still standing), and 42 Washington Mews (1933–shortly before his death, still standing). In 1922, Lachaise bought a summer home and studio in Georgetown, Maine, Marsden Hartley being a frequent visitor.

In America, Lachaise developed his distinctive style and portrayal of the female nude to convey his views about the world around him and healthy, fulfilling human existence. Lachaise&#x27;s ample nudes, which markedly differ from the slender type then in favor, were seen by his contemporaries as, for example, images of maturity and abundance. In the words of a later critic: &quot;The breasts, the abdomen, the thighs, the buttocks—upon each of these elements the sculptor lavishes a powerful and incisive massiveness, a rounded voluminousness, that answers not to the descriptions of nature but to an ideal prescribed by his own emotions.&quot;

==Works==

Lachaise&#x27;s personal idiom was developed during the first decade of the twentieth century following his initial encounter with Isabel. But it was not until after he came to America, that he clearly realized his principal manifesto: his concept of &quot;Woman&quot; as a vital force principally inspired by his beloved. In his own words, he characterized some of his very early sculpted images of &quot;Woman&quot; as vigorous and robust, &quot;radiating sex and soul,&quot; or in &quot;forceful repose, serene and massive as earth.&quot;

Having both become an American citizen and married Isabel in 1917, Lachaise began his meteoric rise in the New York art world with his first solo show, held in 1918 at the Bourgeois Galleries. It featured the full-scale plaster model of his challenging, heroic-sized &quot;Woman (Elevation)&quot; (modeled 1912–15, copyrighted 1927, cast 1927, Art Institute of Chicago). 
Lachaise&#x27;s most famous work, &quot;Standing Woman&quot; (modeled 1928–30, copyrighted 1932, cast ca. 1933, Museum of Modern Art, New York), is perhaps the most complete expression of his principal theme: a voluptuous, energy-filled, self-possessed female nude. Lachaise is also known as a portraitist. He executed busts of literary celebrities and famous artists and literary celebrities such as Marianne Moore, Georgia O&#x27;Keeffe, John Marin, and Lincoln Kirstein. In 1935 the Museum of Modern Art in New York City held a retrospective exhibition of Lachaise&#x27;s work, the first at that institution for a living American sculptor.

Gaston Lachaise was an extremely versatile artist, technically expert in several media and accomplished with both ideal and commercial effort. His sculptures were typically carried out in bronze, although he was also passionately dedicated to carving stone. His work was chosen for several major New York architectural commissions—including those at 195 Broadway and Rockefeller Center. And the more commercial aspect of his sculptural output—the production of fountains and decorative bronzes, primarily depicting animals—also offered him financial relief. Yet Lachaise&#x27;s artistic legacy is closely bound to his ideal depictions of &quot;Woman.&quot;

Although one of America&#x27;s most financially successful sculptors by 1930, largely due to wealthy, discerning patrons, Lachaise burned through most of his income by the time of his unexpected death from acute leukemia on October 18, 1935—at the height of his fame, and having been evicted from his New York studio several weeks earlier because of his failure to pay rent. His late works, which are extreme in their manipulation of human anatomy, are erotic, emotional, and avant-garde. Many of them were not seen by the public until many decades after his death, and they have encouraged a more comprehensive evaluation of his artistic achievement.

Called by ARTnews the &quot;greatest American sculptor of his time&quot;, he played a critical role in the birth of American Modernism, pushing the boundaries of nude figuration with his innovative representations of the human body.

== Foundation ==
In 1963, according to the will of Lachaise&#x27;s widow, Isabel, the Lachaise Foundation was established with the intention of perpetuating Gaston Lachaise&#x27;s artistic legacy for the public benefit.

Since the founding of the Lachaise Foundation, the estate of the artist has been exclusively represented by the following galleries: Weyhe Gallery; Felix Landau Gallery and the Robert Schoelkopf Gallery (1962–1991); Salander-O&#x27;Reilly Galleries (1991–2007); Gerald Peters Gallery (2009–2013); David Findlay Jr. Gallery (2015–2016) until that gallery was acquired by Wally Findlay Galleries/ Findlay Galleries (2016-2021).

Since 2003, art historian Virginia Budny has been authoring a catalogue raisonné sponsored by the Lachaise Foundation.

<doc id="698818" wikidata="Q2065989" url="?curid=698818" title="Peccatum">
<text>Peccatum was an avant-garde metal band from Norway. Their influences range from black metal, progressive metal, industrial music, symphonic metal and gothic metal to European classical music and contemporary music.

==History==

Peccatum was formed by singer Ihriel (Heidi Solberg Tveitan), her husband Ihsahn (of the well-known black metal band Emperor), and her brother Lord PZ. The group released three albums and two EPs. &quot;Lost in Reverie&quot;, released in 2004 after Lord PZ&#x27;s departure, moved towards a more classical, avant-garde and musically opaque direction.

&quot;Lost in Reverie&quot; and the 2005 EP The Moribund People were both produced under the label Mnemosyne Productions, owned and operated by Ihriel and Ihsahn themselves.

On March 4, 2006 Peccatum split, leaving room for Ihriel to continue with Starofash and Ihsahn to work on his solo project.

<text>The Chaldean Catholic Church is an Eastern Catholic particular church (&quot;sui iuris&quot;) in full communion with the Holy See and the rest of the Catholic Church, and is headed by the Chaldean Patriarchate. Employing in its liturgy the East Syriac Rite in the Syriac dialect of the Aramaic language, it is part of Syriac Christianity. Headquartered in the Cathedral of Our Lady of Sorrows, Baghdad, Iraq, since 1950, it is headed by the Catholicos-Patriarch Louis Raphaël I Sako. According to a 1950 CIA report on Iraq, Chaldean Catholic Assyrians numbered 98,000 and were the largest Christian minority. In the late 2010s, it had a membership of 616,639, with a large population in diaspora and its home country of Iraq.

The United States Commission on International Religious Freedom reports that, according to the Iraqi Christian Foundation, an agency of the Chaldean Catholic Church, approximately 80% of Iraqi Christians are of that church. In its own 2018 Report on Religious Freedom, the United States Department of State put the Chaldean Catholics at approximately 67% of the Christians in Iraq. The 2019 Country Guidance on Iraq of the European Union Agency for Asylum gives the same information as the United States Department of State.

The majority of Chaldean Catholics (), today are ethnic Assyrians, also known as Chaldo-Assyrians. In the Assyrian homeland, Chaldean Catholics primarily inhabited villages and cities that are located in what is now modern day Iraq, such as Alqosh, Ankawa, Araden, Baqofah, Batnaya, Karamlesh, Mangesh, Shaqlawa, Tesqopa, Tel Keppe, and Zakho. Other Assyrian communities such as those from southeastern Turkey, as well as a minority in Syria and Iran, also adhere to the church.

== Origin ==
The Chaldean Catholic Church arose following a schism within the Church of the East. In 1552, the established &quot;Eliya line&quot; of patriarchs was opposed by a rival patriarch, Sulaqa, who initiated what is called the &quot;Shimun line&quot;. He, and his early successors, entered into communion with the Catholic Church, but in the course of over a century loosened their link with Rome and under Shimun XIII Dinkha, openly renounced it in 1672, by adopting a profession of faith that contradicted that of Rome, while they maintained their independence from the &quot;Eliya line&quot;. Leadership of those who wished to be in communion with Rome then passed to the Archbishop of Amid Joseph I, recognized as Catholic patriarch, first by the Turkish civil authorities (1677), and then by Rome itself (1681).

A century and a half later, in 1830, Rome conferred headship of the Catholics on Yohannan Hormizd. A member of the &quot;Eliya line&quot; family: he opposed Eliya XII (1778–1804), the last of that line to be elected in the normal way as patriarch, was himself irregularly elected in 1780, as Sulaqa had been in 1552, and won over to communion with Rome most of the followers of the &quot;Eliya line&quot;. The &quot;Shimun line&quot; that in 1553 entered communion with Rome and broke it off in 1672, is now that of the church that in 1976 officially adopted the name &quot;Assyrian Church of the East&quot;, while a member of the &quot;Eliya line&quot; family is part of the series of patriarchs of the Chaldean Catholic Church.

==The description &quot;Chaldean&quot;==
For many centuries, from at least the time of Jerome (c. 347 – 420), the term &quot;Chaldean&quot; was a misnomer that indicated the Biblical Aramaic language and was still the normal name in the nineteenth century. Jerome did know that Aramaic was in the Bible, where he designated the biblical Aramaic (or Old Aramaic) by the term &#x27;Chaldean.&#x27; Jerome implied that one reason the books of Tobit and Judith are undeserving of inclusion within the biblical canon is because they were written in Chaldean. Because he translated the Hebrew Bible, he would naturally recognize each time which language would be much more difficult for him when the passages changed from Hebrew to Chaldean.

Neither before nor after the 15th century did the term &quot;Chaldean&quot; indicate a supposed ethnic connection of the Church of the East with ancient south Babylonian Chaldea and its inhabitants, which emerged during the 9th century BC after Chaldean tribes migrated from the Levant region of Urfa in Upper Mesopotamia to southeast Mesopotamia, and disappeared from history during the 6th century BC: it referred instead to the use by Christians of that church of the Syriac language, a form of the biblical Aramaic language, which was then and indeed until the 19th century generally called Chaldean. 

Only in 1445 did it begin to be used to mean Aramaic speakers in communion with the Catholic Church, on the basis of a decree of the Council of Florence, which accepted the profession of faith that Timothy, metropolitan of the Aramaic speakers in Cyprus, made in Aramaic, and which decreed that &quot;nobody shall in future dare to call [...] Chaldeans, Nestorians&quot;. In the 16th century, Spanish cleric Francis Xavier used the term &quot;Chaldean&quot; for the Syriac language in this statement: &quot;Not even the Caciz themselves understand the prayers which they recite: which are in a foreign language (I think Chaldean). They render special honours to the Apostle St. Thomas, claiming to be descendants of the Christians begotten to Jesus Christ by that Apostle in these countries.&quot;

A letter from November 14, 1838, states: “The so-called “Chaldeans&quot; of Mesopotamia received that title, as you know, from the pope, on their becoming Catholics.” Previously, when there were as yet no Catholic Aramaic speakers of Mesopotamian origin, the term &quot;Chaldean&quot; was applied with explicit reference to their &quot;Nestorian&quot; religion. Thus Jacques de Vitry wrote of them in 1220/1 that &quot;they denied that Mary was the Mother of God and claimed that Christ existed in two persons. They consecrated leavened bread and used the &#x27;Chaldean&#x27; (Syriac) language&quot;. The decree of the Council of Florence was directed against use of &quot;Chaldean&quot; to signify &quot;non-Catholic.&quot;

Outside of Catholic Church usage, the term &quot;Chaldean&quot; continued to apply to all associated with the Church of the East tradition, whether they were in communion with Rome or not. It indicated not race or nationality, but only language or religion. Throughout the 19th century, it continued to be used of East Syriac Christians, whether &quot;Nestorian&quot; or Catholic, and this usage continued into the 20th century. In 1852 George Percy Badger distinguished those whom he called Chaldeans from those whom he called Nestorians, but by religion alone, never by language, race or nationality.

Patriarch Raphael I Bidawid of the Chaldean Catholic Church (1989–2003), who accepted the term Assyrian as descriptive of his nationality and ethnicity, commented: &quot;When a portion of the Church of the East became Catholic in the 17th Century, the name given to the church was &#x27;Chaldean&#x27; based on the Magi kings who were believed by some to have come from what once had been the land of the Chaldean, to Bethlehem. The name &#x27;Chaldean&#x27; does not represent an ethnicity, just a church [...] We have to separate what is ethnicity and what is religion [...] I myself, my sect is Chaldean, but ethnically, I am Assyrian.&quot; Earlier, he said: &quot;Before I became a priest I was an Assyrian, before I became a bishop I was an Assyrian, I am an Assyrian today, tomorrow, forever, and I am proud of it.&quot;

The Assyrian ethnicity of Chaldean Catholics is also attested by Assyriology. In 1881, archeologist and author Hormuzd Rassam stated: “The inhabitants of Assyria consist now of mixed races, Arabs, Turkomans, Koords, Yezeedees, Jews, and Christians called Chaldeans and Syrians. The last two-named denominations doubtless belong to one nationality, the Assyrian, and they were only distinguished by these two names when they separated consequent upon the theological dispute of the age, namely, Monophisites or Jacobites, and Nestorians.” In 1920, Herbert Henry Austin stated: “It may not be out of place, therefore, to point out that there were exceedingly few Roman Catholic Assyrians or “Chaldeans&quot; as they are generally termed when they embrace Rome, amongst the refugees at Baqubah. The very large majority of the Roman Catholic Assyrians in the Mosul vilayet did not join the mountaineers and fight against the Turks and in consequence were permitted by the Turks to continue to dwell practically unmolested in their homes about Mosul.&quot;

== History ==

=== The Church of the East ===

The Chaldean Catholic Church traces its beginnings to the Church of the East, which was founded in the Parthian Empire. The Acts of the Apostles mentions Parthians as among those to whom the apostles preached on the day of Pentecost (Acts 2:9). Thomas the Apostle, Thaddeus of Edessa, and Bartholomew the Apostle are reputed to be its founders. One of the modern Churches that boast descent from it says it is &quot;the Church in Babylon&quot; spoken of in 1 Peter 5:13 and that he visited it.

Under the rule of the Sasanian Empire, which overthrew the Parthians in 224, the Church of the East continued to develop its distinctive identity by use of the Syriac language and Syriac script. One &quot;Persian&quot; bishop was at the First Council of Nicaea (325). There is no mention of Persian participation in the First Council of Constantinople (381), in which also the Western part of the Roman Empire was not involved.

The Council of Seleucia-Ctesiphon of 410, held in the Sasanian capital, recognized the city&#x27;s bishop Isaac as Catholicos, with authority throughout the Church of the East. The persistent military conflicts between the Sasanians and the by then Christianized Roman Empire made the Persians suspect the Church of the East of sympathizing with the enemy. This in turn induced the Church of the East to distance itself increasingly from that in the Roman Empire. Although in a time of peace their 420 council explicitly accepted the decrees of some &quot;western&quot; councils, including that of Nicaea, in 424 they determined that thenceforth they would refer disciplinary or theological problems to no external power, especially not to any &quot;western&quot; bishop or council.

The theological controversy that followed the Council of Ephesus in 431 was a turning point in the history of the Church of the East. The Council condemned as heretical the Christology of Nestorius, whose reluctance to accord the Virgin Mary the title &quot;Theotokos&quot; &quot;God-bearer, Mother of God&quot; was taken as evidence that he believed two separate persons (as opposed to two united natures) to be present within Christ. The Sasanian Emperor provided refuge for those who in the Nestorian schism rejected the decrees of the Council of Ephesus enforced in the Byzantine Empire. In 484 he executed the pro-Roman Catholicos Babowai. Under the influence of Barsauma, Bishop of Nisibis, the Church of the East officially accepted as normative the teaching not of Nestorius himself, but of his teacher Theodore of Mopsuestia, whose writings the 553 Second Council of Constantinople condemned as Nestorian but some modern scholars view them as orthodox. The position thus assigned to Theodore in the Church of the East was reinforced in several subsequent synods in spite of the opposing teaching of Henana of Adiabeme.

After its split with the West and its adoption of a theology that some called Nestorianism, the Church of the East expanded rapidly in the medieval period due to missionary work. Between 500 and 1400, its geographical horizon extended well beyond its heartland in present-day northern Iraq, northeastern Syria, and southeastern Turkey, setting up communities throughout Central Asia and as far as China (as witnessed by the Xi&#x27;an Stele), a Tang dynasty tablet in Chinese script dating to 781 that documented 150 years of Christian history in China. Their most lasting addition was of the Saint Thomas Christians of the Malabar Coast in India, where they had around 10 million followers.
However, a decline had already set in at the time of Yahballaha III (1281–1317), when the Church of the East reached its greatest geographical extent, it had in south and central Iraq and in south, central and east Persia only four dioceses, where at the end of the ninth century it had at least 54, and Yahballaha himself died at the hands of a Muslim mob.

Around 1400, the Turco-Mongol nomadic conqueror Timur arose out of the Eurasian Steppe to lead military campaigns all across Western, Southern and Central Asia, ultimately seizing much of the Muslim world after defeating the Mamluks of Egypt and Syria, the emerging Ottoman Empire, and the declining Delhi Sultanate. Timur&#x27;s conquests devastated most Assyrian bishoprics and destroyed the 4000-year-old cultural and religious capital of Assur. After the destruction brought on by Timur, the massive and organized Church of the East structure was largely reduced to its region of origin, with the exception of the Saint Thomas Christians in India.

=== 1552 schism ===

The Church of the East has seen many disputes about the position of Catholicos. A synod in 539 decided that neither of the two claimants, Elisha and Narsai, who had been elected by rival groups of bishops in 524, was legitimate. Similar conflicts occurred between Barsauma and Acacius of Seleucia-Ctesiphon and between Hnanisho I and Yohannan the Leper. The 1552 conflict was not merely between two individuals but extended to two rival lines of patriarchs, like the 1964 schism between what are now called the Assyrian and the Ancient Church of the East.

Dissent over the practice of hereditary succession to the Patriarchate, usually from uncle to nephew, led to the action in 1552 by a group of bishops from the northern regions of Amid and Salmas who elected as a rival Patriarch the abbot of Rabban Hormizd Monastery (which was the Patriarch&#x27;s residence) Yohannan Sulaqa. &quot;To strengthen the position of their candidate the bishops sent him to Rome to negotiate a new union&quot;. By tradition, a patriarch could be ordained only by someone of archiepiscopal (metropolitan) rank, a rank to which only members of that one family were promoted. So Sulaqa travelled to Rome, where, presented as the new patriarch elect, he entered communion with the Catholic Church on 20 February 1553 and was ordained by Pope Julius III and recognized as patriarch on 9 April.

The title or description under which he was recognized as patriarch is given variously as &quot;Patriarch of Mosul in Eastern Syria&quot;; &quot;Patriarch of the Church of the Chaldeans of Mosul&quot;; &quot;Patriarch of the Chaldeans&quot;; &quot;Patriarch of Mosul&quot;; or &quot;Patriarch of the Eastern Assyrians&quot;, this last being the version given by Pietro Strozzi on the second-last unnumbered page before page 1 of his &quot;De Dogmatibus Chaldaeorum&quot;, of which an English translation is given in Adrian Fortescue&#x27;s &quot;Lesser Eastern Churches&quot;. The &quot;Eastern Assyrians&quot;, who, if not Catholic, were presumed to be Nestorians, were distinguished from the &quot;Western Assyrians&quot; (those west of the Tigris River), who were looked on as Jacobites. It was as Patriarch of the &quot;Eastern Assyrians&quot; that Sulaqa&#x27;s successor, Abdisho IV Maron, was accredited for participation in the Council of Trent.
The names already in use (except that of &quot;Nestorian&quot;) were thus applied to the existing church (not a new one) for which the request to consecrate its patriarch was made by emissaries who gave the impression that the patriarchal see was vacant.

Shimun VIII Yohannan Sulaqa returned home in the same year and, unable to take possession of the traditional patriarchal seat near Alqosh, resided in Amid. Before being put to death at the instigation of the partisans of the Patriarch from whom he had broken away, he ordained two metropolitans and three other bishops, thus initiating a new ecclesiastical hierarchy under what is known as the &quot;Shimun line&quot; of patriarchs, who soon moved from Amid eastward, settling, after many intervening places, in the isolated village of Qudshanis under Persian rule.

=== Successive leaders of those in communion with Rome ===

Sulaqa&#x27;s earliest successors entered into communion with the Catholic Church, but in the course of over a century, their link with Rome grew weak. The last to request and obtain formal papal recognition died in 1600. They adopted hereditary succession to the patriarchate, opposition to which had caused the 1552 schism. In 1672, Shimun XIII Dinkha formally broke communion with Rome, adopting a profession of faith that contradicted that of Rome, while he maintained his independence from the Alqosh-based &quot;Eliya line&quot; of patriarchs. The &quot;Shimun line&quot; eventually became the patriarchal line of what since 1976 is officially called the Assyrian Church of the East.

Leadership of those who wished to be in communion with Rome then passed to Archbishop Joseph of Amid. In 1677 his leadership was recognized first by the Turkish civil authorities, and then in 1681 by Rome. (Until then, the authority of the Alqosh patriarch over Amid, which had been Sulaqa&#x27;s residence but which his successors abandoned on having to move eastward into Safavid Iran, had been accepted by the Turkish authorities.)

All the (non-hereditary) successors in Amid of Joseph I, who in 1696 resigned for health reasons and lived on in Rome until 1707, took the name Joseph: Joseph II (1696–1713), Joseph III (1713–1757), Joseph IV (1757–1781). For that reason, they are known as the &quot;Josephite line&quot;. Joseph IV presented his resignation in 1780 and it was accepted in 1781, after which he handed over the administration of the patriarchate to his nephew, not yet a bishop, and retired to Rome, where he lived until 1791.

Appointment of the nephew as patriarch would look like acceptance of the principle of hereditary succession. Besides, the Alqosh &quot;Eliya line&quot; was drawing closer to Rome, and the pro-Catholic faction within its followers was becoming predominant. For various reasons, including the ecclesiastical as well as political turbulence in Europe after the French Revolution, Rome was long unable to choose between two rival claimants to headship of the Chaldean Catholics.

The 1672 adoption by the &quot;Shimun line&quot; of patriarchs of Nestorian doctrine had been followed in some areas by widespread adoption of the opposing Christology upheld in Rome. This occurred not only in the Amid-Mardin area for which by Turkish decree Joseph I was patriarch, but also in the city of Mosul, where by 1700 nearly all the East Syrians were Catholics. The Rabban Hormizd Monastery, which was the seat of the &quot;Eliya line&quot; of patriarchs is 2 km from the village of Alqosh and about 45 km north of the city of Mosul.

In view of this situation, Patriarch Eliya XI wrote to Pope Clement XII and his successor Benedict XIV in 1735, 1749 and 1756, asking for union. Then, in 1771, both he and his designated successor Ishoyabb made a profession of faith that Pope Clement XIV accepted, thus establishing communion in principle. When Eliya XI died in 1778, the metropolitans recognized as his successor Ishoyabb, who accordingly took the Eliya name (Eliya XII). To win support, Eliya made profession of the Catholic faith, but almost immediately renounced it and declared his support of the traditionalist (Nestorian) view.

Yohannan Hormizd, a member of the &quot;Eliya line&quot; family, opposed Eliya XII (1778–1804), the last of that line to be elected in the normal way as patriarch. In 1780 Yohannan was irregularly elected patriarch, as Sulaqa had been in 1552. He won over to communion with Rome most followers of the &quot;Eliyya line&quot;. The Holy See did not recognize him as patriarch, but in 1791 Pope Pius VI appointed him archbishop of Amid and administrator of the Catholic patriarchate. The violent protests of Joseph IV&#x27;s nephew, who was then in Rome, and suspicions raised by others about the sincerity of Yohannan&#x27;s conversion prevented this being put into effect.

In 1793 it was agreed that Yohannan should withdraw from Amid to Mosul, the metropolitan see that he already held, but that the post of patriarch would not be conferred on his rival, Joseph IV&#x27;s nephew. In 1802 the latter was appointed metropolitan of Amid and administrator of the patriarchate, but not patriarch. Nonetheless, he became commonly known as Joseph V. He died in 1828. Yohannan&#x27;s rival for the Alqosh title of patriarch had died in 1804, with his followers so reduced in number that they did not elect any successor for him, thus bringing the Alqosh or Eliya line to an end.

Finally then, in 1830, a century and a half after the Holy See had conferred headship of the Chaldean Catholics on Joseph I of Amid, Pope Pius VIII granted recognition as Patriarch to Yohannan, whose (non-hereditary) patriarchal succession has since then lasted unbroken in the Chaldean Catholic Church.

=== Later history of the Chaldean Church ===
In 1838, the Kurds of Soran attacked the Rabban Hormizd Monastery and Alqosh, apparently thinking the villagers were Yazidis responsible for the murder of a Kurdish chieftain, and killed over 300 Chaldean Catholics, including Gabriel Dambo, the refounder of the monastery, and other monks.

In 1846, the Ottoman Empire, which had previously classified as Nestorians those who called themselves Chaldeans, granted them recognition as a distinct &quot;millet&quot;.

The most famous patriarch of the Chaldean Church in the 19th century was Joseph VI Audo who is remembered also for his clashes with Pope Pius IX mainly about his attempts to extend the Chaldean jurisdiction over the Malabar Catholics. This was a period of expansion for the Chaldean Catholic Church.

The activity of the Turkish army and their Kurdish and Arab allies, partly in response to armed support for Russia in the territory of the Qochanis patriarchate, brought ruin also to the Chaldean dioceses of Amid, Siirt and Gazarta and the metropolitans Addai Scher of Siirt and Philippe-Jacques Abraham of Gazarta were killed in 1915.

In the 21st century, Father Ragheed Aziz Ganni, the pastor of the Chaldean Church of the Holy Spirit in Mosul, who graduated from the Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, &quot;Angelicum&quot; in Rome in 2003 with a licentiate in ecumenical theology, was killed on 3 June 2007 in Mosul alongside the subdeacons Basman Yousef Daud, Wahid Hanna Isho, and Gassan Isam Bidawed, after he celebrated mass. Ganni has since been declared a Servant of God.

Chaldean Archbishop Paulos Faraj Rahho and three companions were abducted on 29 February 2008, in Mosul, and murdered a few days later.

=== 21st century: international diaspora ===

There are many Chaldean Assyrians in diaspora in the Western world, primarily in the American states of Michigan, Illinois and California.

In 2006, the Eparchy of Oceania, with the title of &#x27;St Thomas the Apostle of Sydney of the Chaldeans&#x27; was set up with jurisdiction including the Chaldean Catholic communities of Australia and New Zealand. Its first Bishop, named by Pope Benedict XVI on 21 October 2006, was Archbishop Djibrail (Jibrail) Kassab, until this date, Archbishop of Bassorah in Iraq.

There has been a large immigration to the United States particularly to West Bloomfield and Oakland County in Southeast Michigan. Although the largest population resides in Southeast Michigan, there are populations in parts of California and Arizona as well, which all fall under the Eparchy of Saint Thomas the Apostle of Detroit. In addition, Canada in recent years has shown growing communities in provinces such as Ontario.

In 2008, Bawai Soro of the Assyrian Church of the East and 1,000 Assyrian families were received into full communion with the Chaldean Catholic Church.

On Friday, June 10, 2011, Pope Benedict XVI erected a new Chaldean Catholic eparchy in Toronto, Ontario, Canada and named Archbishop Yohannan Zora, who has worked alongside four priests with Catholics in Toronto (the largest community of Chaldeans) for nearly 20 years and who was previously an ad hominem Archbishop (he will retain this rank as head of the eparchy) and the Archbishop of the Archdiocese (Archeparchy) of Ahvaz (since 1974). The new eparchy, or diocese, will be known as the Chaldean Catholic Eparchy of Mar Addai. There are 38,000 Chaldean Catholics in Canada. Archbishop Zora was born in Batnaya, Iraq, on March 15, 1939. He was ordained in 1962 and worked in Iraqi parishes before being transferred to Iran in 1969.

The 2006 Australian census counted a total of 4,498 Chaldean Catholics in that country.

=== Historic membership censuses ===
Despite the internal discords of the reigns of Yohannan Hormizd (1830–1838), Nicholas I Zaya (1839–1847) and Joseph VI Audo (1847–1878), the 19th century was a period of considerable growth for the Chaldean church, in which its territorial jurisdiction was extended, its hierarchy strengthened and its membership nearly doubled. In 1850, the Anglican missionary George Percy Badger recorded the population of the Chaldean Catholic Church as 2,743 Chaldean families, or just under 20,000 persons.

Badger&#x27;s figures cannot be squared with the figure of just over 4,000 Chaldean families recorded by Fulgence de Sainte Marie in 1796 nor with slightly later figures provided by Paulin Martin in 1867. Badger is known to have classified as Nestorian a considerable number of villages in the Aqra district which were Chaldean at this period, and he also failed to include several important Chaldean villages in other dioceses. His estimate is almost certainly far too low.

Paulin Martin&#x27;s statistical survey in 1867, after the creation of the dioceses of Aqra, Zakho, Basra and Sehna by Joseph Audo, recorded a total church membership of 70,268, more than three times higher than Badger&#x27;s estimate. Most of the population figures in these statistics have been rounded up to the nearest thousand, and they may also have been exaggerated slightly, but the membership of the Chaldean Catholic Church at this period was certainly closer to 70,000 than to Badger&#x27;s 20,000.

A statistical survey of the Chaldean Catholic Church made in 1896 by J. B. Chabot included, for the first time, details of several patriarchal vicariates established in the second half of the 19th century for the small Chaldean communities in Adana, Aleppo, Beirut, Cairo, Damascus, Edessa, Kermanshah and Teheran; for the mission stations established in the 1890s in several towns and villages in the Qudshanis patriarchate; and for the newly created Chaldean diocese of Urmi. According to Chabot, there were mission stations in the town of Serai d’Mahmideh in Taimar and in the Hakkari villages of Mar Behısho, Sat, Zarne and &#x27;Salamakka&#x27; (Ragula d&#x27;Salabakkan).

The last survey of the Chaldean Catholic Church before the First World War was made in 1913 by the Chaldean priest Joseph Tfinkdji, after a period of steady growth since 1896. It then consisted of the patriarchal archdiocese of Mosul and Baghdad, four other archdioceses (Amid, Kirkuk, Seert and Urmi), and eight dioceses (Aqra, Amadiya, Gazarta, Mardin, Salmas, Sehna, Zakho and the newly created diocese of Van). Five more patriarchal vicariates had been established since 1896 (Ahwaz, Constantinople, Basra, Ashshar and Deir al-Zor), giving a total of twelve vicariates.

Tfinkdji&#x27;s grand total of 101,610 Catholics in 199 villages is slightly exaggerated, as his figures included 2,310 nominal Catholics in twenty-one &#x27;newly converted&#x27; or &#x27;semi-Nestorian&#x27; villages in the dioceses of Amid, Seert and Aqra, but it is clear that the Chaldean Catholic Church had grown significantly since 1896. With around 100,000 believers in 1913, the membership of the Chaldean church was only slightly smaller than that of the Qudshanis patriarchate (probably 120,000 East Syriac Christians at most, including the population of the nominally Russian Orthodox villages in the Urmi district). Its congregations were concentrated in far fewer villages than those of the Qudshanis patriarchate, and with 296 priests, a ratio of roughly three priests for every thousand believers, it was rather more effectively served by its clergy. Only about a dozen Chaldean villages, mainly in the Seert and Aqra districts, did not have their own priests in 1913.

Tfinkdji&#x27;s statistics also highlight the effect on the Chaldean Catholic Church of the educational reforms of the patriarch Joseph VI Audo. The Chaldean Catholic Church on the eve of the First World War was becoming less dependent on the monastery of Rabban Hormizd and the College of the Propaganda for the education of its bishops. Seventeen Chaldean bishops were consecrated between 1879 and 1913, of whom only one (Stephen Yohannan Qaynaya) was entirely educated in the monastery of Rabban Hormizd. Six bishops were educated at the College of the Propaganda (Joseph Gabriel Adamo, Toma Audo, Jeremy Timothy Maqdasi, Isaac Khudabakhash, Theodore Msayeh and Peter Aziz).

The future patriarch Yousef VI Emmanuel II Thomas was trained in the seminary of Ghazir near Beirut. Of the other nine bishops, two (Addai Sher and Francis David) were trained in the Syro-Chaldean seminary in Mosul, and seven (Philip Yaqob Abraham, Yaqob Yohannan Sahhar, Eliya Joseph Khayyat, Shlemun Sabbagh, Yaqob Awgin Manna, Hormizd Stephen Jibri and ) in the patriarchal seminary in Mosul.

Daughters of Mary Immaculate is a Chaldean Catholic apostolic order with patriarchal rights, established in Baghdad on August 7, 1922, during the reign of Patriarch Mar Youssef Emmanuel II Thomas.

Chaldean Sisters was founded by Father Anton Zebouni, born on January 17, 1883, in Mosul, Iraq. Zebouni was ordained a priest on May 15, 1907, by Patriarch Emmanuel II Toma. In the aftermath of World War I, many in Iraq faced poverty and hardship. Father Zebouni, moved by the difficult conditions, sought to create a congregation for women to support the Chaldean community. With permission from the Patriarch, the congregation was established and dedicated to Mary Immaculate. The order&#x27;s mission includes a life of contemplative unity with God. The sisters engage in apostolic work and prayer, seeking to discover and follow God&#x27;s will for the salvation of souls.

The Chaldean Sisters initially aimed to address the crisis of homeless Chaldean youth. In 1927, they founded an orphanage in Baghdad, which was later relocated due to security issues. The orphanage eventually settled in Alqosh. Over the years, the congregation has grown to nearly 100 sisters serving in various locations, including Iraq, Lebanon, Rome, Australia, the United Arab Emirates, Detroit, Chicago, Arizona, Turlock, and San Diego.

The Chaldean Sisters have been instrumental in various educational and social services, including running schools, orphanages, and retirement homes. Their commitment to education and social service has had a significant impact on the communities they serve. In 2022, the Chaldean Sisters celebrated their 100th anniversary with a fundraiser event to support their education expenses and the formation and novitiate home in Farmington Hills, Michigan.

The order is known for its dedication to prayer, community life, and service, guided by their motto, “With Mary to the Highest,” emphasizing humility and dedication in their service. The Chaldean Sisters continue to be a vital part of the Chaldean Catholic community, contributing to the spiritual and social well-being of the people they serve.

==Liturgy==

The Chaldean Catholic Church uses the East Syriac Rite.

A slight reform of the liturgy was effective since 6 January 2007, and it aimed to unify the many different uses of each parish, to remove centuries-old additions that merely imitated the Roman Rite, and for pastoral reasons. The main elements of variations are: the Anaphora said aloud by the priest, the return to the ancient architecture of the churches, the restoration of the ancient use where the bread and wine are readied before a service begins, and the removal from the Creed of the &quot;Filioque&quot; clause.

==Ecumenical relations==
The Church&#x27;s relations with its fellow Assyrians in the Assyrian Church of the East have improved in recent years. In 1994, Pope John Paul II and Patriarch Dinkha IV of the Assyrian Church of the East signed a &quot;Common Christological Declaration&quot;. On the 20 July 2001, the Holy See issued a document, in agreement with the Assyrian Church of the East, named &quot;Guidelines for admission to the Eucharist between the Chaldean Church and the Assyrian Church of the East&quot;, which confirmed also the validity of the Anaphora of Addai and Mari.

In 2015, while the patriarchate of the Assyrian Church of the East was vacant following the death of Dinkha IV, the Chaldean Patriarch Louis Raphaël I Sako proposed unifying the three modern patriarchates into a re-established Church of the East with a single Patriarch in full communion with the Pope. The Assyrian Church of the East respectfully declined this proposal citing &quot;ecclesiological divergences still remaining&quot; and proceeded with its election of a new patriarch.

==Modern activity==
In 2024, Patriarch Louis Raphaël Sako, the head of Iraq’s Chaldean Catholic Church, led the Christians of his country in a three-day fast for peace, in Iraq, Palestine, Ukraine, and the rest of the world. 

==Adherents today==

Followers of the Chaldean Catholic Church often identify and are identified as &quot;Chaldean&quot; but, like adherents of the Syriac Orthodox Church, Syriac Catholic Church, Assyrian Church of the East and Ancient Church of the East who also live in or originate from Upper Mesopotamia, they are ethnic Assyrians and call themselves &quot;Suraye&quot; () in Neo-Aramaic. The Chaldean Catholics originated from ancient communities living in and indigenous to the northern Iraq/Mesopotamia, once known as Assyria (from the 25th century BC until the 7th century AD). Chaldean Catholics largely bear the same family and personal names, share the same genetic profile, hail from the same villages, towns and cities in northern Iraq, southeastern Turkey, northeastern Syria and northwestern Iran, as their neighbours of other religious denominations. The Chaldean Neo-Aramaic, Assyrian Neo-Aramaic and Surayt/Turoyo languages do not run parallel to the often associated religious denominations (Chaldean Catholic Church, Assyrian Church of the East, Syriac Orthodox Church).

In 1908, before the Assyrian genocide, the dissolution of the Ottoman Empire and the creation of new states in the Middle East such as Iraq, an article in the &quot;Catholic Encyclopedia&quot; states: &quot;Strictly, the name of Chaldeans is no longer correct; in Chaldea proper, apart from Baghdad, there are now very few adherents of this rite, most of the Chaldean population being found in the cities of Kirkuk, Erbil, and Mosul, in the heart of the Tigris valley, in the valley of the Zab, and in the mountains of Kurdistan. It is in the former ecclesiastical province of Ator (Assyria) that are now found the most flourishing of the Catholic Chaldean communities. The native population accepts the name of Atoraya-Kaldaya (Assyro-Chaldeans), while in the neo-Syriac vernacular Christians generally are known as Syrians.&quot; The subsequent upheaval produced both an exodus, in particular but not only from what is now Turkey to other countries, and a more urbanized Chaldean Church within Iraq.
While the Chaldean Catholic Church is predominantly Assyrian, the church has taken a stance of separating its adherents from Assyrian identity in the past. Such stances have often been detrimental to the political situation of Chaldean Catholics living in Iraq, and have threatened previous actions such as the Common Christological Declaration. In 2017, the Chaldean Catholic Church issued an official statement of its Synod of Bishops, the body that is exclusively competent to make laws for the entire church and that is its tribunal that it sets store on the distinct Chaldean identity, which is recognized in the Constitution of Iraq. It also declared:
: &quot;As a genuine Chaldean people, we officially reject the labels that distort our Chaldean identity, such as the composite name “Chaldean Syriac Assyrian” used in the Kurdistan Region, contrary to the name established in the Iraqi constitution. We call upon our daughters and sons to reject these labels, to adhere to their Chaldean identity without fanaticism, and to respect the other names such as ‘Assyrians’, ‘Syriacs’, and ‘Arameans’. We call upon the authorities in the region to respect them, and we encourage our Chaldeans to cooperate with everyone for the common good and not to split into unidentified groups or follow illusory projects that harm Christians. We also encourage them to engage in public affairs and in the political process as genuine partners of this blessed land, and to play their role alongside their fellow citizens in building a modern and strong civil country that befits their country&#x27;s civilization and glory, a country that respects the rights and equality of all. We also express our support for the Chaldean League which seeks to establish links between the Chaldeans around the world.&quot;

Many Chaldean Catholic Assyrians have since migrated to Western countries, where they form a large diaspora community. The most recent reasons for migration are religious persecution, ethnic persecution, poor economic conditions during the sanctions against Iraq, and poor security conditions after the 2003 invasion. At least 20,000 of them fled through Lebanon to seek resettlement in Europe and the United States. As political changes sweep through many Arab nations, Assyrians have expressed concern about the developments and their future in the region.

== Internal Scandals in the Church ==
The Chaldean Catholic Church is experiencing a profound leadership crisis, highlighted by recent events in July 2024. Five bishops, led by Archbishop Bashar Warda, boycotted the mandatory Chaldean Church Synod. This act of defiance was followed by their withdrawal from an August spiritual retreat and the removal of their students from the Chaldean Seminary. Cardinal Louis Sako, deeply concerned about the integrity of the Church, viewed these actions as a &quot;serious breach&quot; of ecclesial unity. In an effort to restore harmony, Cardinal Sako issued an ultimatum on August 28, 2024, requesting a public apology from the dissenting bishops by September 5. However, Archbishop Warda and his allies remained defiant, refusing to apologize and criticizing Sako&#x27;s leadership. Faced with this continued resistance, Cardinal Sako has considered canonical sanctions, including the possibility of excommunication, to safeguard the Church&#x27;s unity. In September 2024, Sako reported the five bishops, including Warda, directly to Pope Francis.

The bitter feud between Cardinal Louis Sako and Archbishop Bashar Warda has escalated into a personal vendetta, with Sako accusing Warda of scheming to seize control of the patriarchate. Sako perceives Warda as a conniving opportunist, manoeuvring to position himself as the next patriarch. This perception of Warda&#x27;s ruthless power play has forced Sako to abandon his retirement plans and protect the Chaldean Catholic Church, despite his previous commitment to step down at 75.

<text>Harrow Weald is a suburban district in Greater London, England. Located about north of Harrow, Harrow Weald is formed from a leafy 1930s suburban development along with ancient woodland of Harrow Weald Common. It forms part of the London Borough of Harrow.

Harrow Weald is bordered by Bushey Heath (north), Stanmore (west), Wealdstone (south), and is near to Headstone and Hatch End. It is in the HA postcode area.

==Etymology==
The word is Old English in origin, meaning woodland. It was recorded as &quot;waldis&quot; in 1303 and &quot;welde&quot; in 1382, but the name &quot;Harrow Weald&quot; is not recorded until 1553. It was then part of the great Forest of Middlesex.

==Geography and locale==

Ancient woodland on high ground fills most of the northern part of Harrow Weald on the border of Greater London (and the traditional county of Middlesex) with Hertfordshire. The area is one of the highest in Greater London; the highest point in Middlesex is near the woods at . The eastern part of the woods merges into those of Stanmore and encompasses Bentley Priory. The priory&#x27;s grounds are now Bentley Priory Nature Reserve, a biological Site of Special Scientific Interest. Along the southern edge of the high ground runs the road Old Redding and a car park here gives views over parts of London. The western part of the woodland forms Harrow Weald Common, which adjoins Harrow Weald SSSI, a geological Site of Special Scientific Interest. Other smaller woods surround the Grim&#x27;s Dyke Hotel, the former country house of W. S. Gilbert. Gilbert and Sullivan&#x27;s comic operas are frequently performed here. The house is named after the nearby earthwork Grim&#x27;s Ditch, a long ancient monument that runs from Harrow Weald to Pinner Green. The monument remains largely mysterious but is known to have been named in the Saxon era. The ditch hints at a long history of habitation in the area and many artefacts have been found on the common to support this.

Boxtree Park Friends group
is based at Harrow Weald Recreation Ground. It is run by a group of local volunteers who look after and maintain the park on behalf of the community and in collaboration with Harrow Council.

The south of the area is a suburban development with houses, schools, small shops, supermarkets and pubs (notably Bombay Central, formerly the &quot;Weald Stone Inn&quot;, and before that the &quot;Red Lion&quot;). The area expanded around the First World War and continued to grow quickly: the population grew from 1,517 in 1901 to 10,923 in 1931.

The Harrow Weald campus of Harrow College (previously a grammar school, then a 16+ college) and Harrow Weald Cemetery are at the northern edge of the built up area. All Saints churchyard and its extension adjoin this cemetery and their most famous interment is of Leefe Robinson, a pilot who was awarded the Victoria Cross. Also buried at All Saints is the English-born Hollywood actor George Arliss (1868-1946), who won the Academy Award for Best Actor in 1930.

==Demography==
The 2011 census showed that in the Harrow Weald ward, 53% of the population was white (41% British, 6% Other, 5% Irish). The largest non-white group was Indian at 19%. Of the 4,160 household tenures, 68.4% of them are owned, 15.9% are socially rented and 13.7% are privately rented. The unemployment rate of economically active people was 4.9%. The median age of the population is 39.

==Transport==
There are no train stations in the centre of Harrow Weald, but Headstone Lane railway station is to the west, whereas Harrow &amp; Wealdstone station is to the south.

===Buses===
London Bus routes 140, 182, 186, 258, 340, 640, H12, H18, H19 and N18 operate through the area. The N140 bus also goes through Harrow Weald, it was introduced on 17 June 1972.

Harrow Weald ward is in the Harrow East constituency, represented by Conservative MP Bob Blackman. The ward is represented by Conservative Cllrs Pritesh Patel, Cllr Stephen Greek and Cllr Ramji Chauhan.

<text>Leonard Walter Jerome (November 3, 1817 – March 3, 1891) was an American financier in Brooklyn, New York, and the maternal grandfather of Winston Churchill.

== Early life ==
Leonard Jerome was born in Pompey in Onondaga County, New York, on November 3, 1817. He was one of nine sons and one daughter born to Aurora (née Murray) Jerome (1785–1867) and Isaac Jerome (1786–1866). Isaac was a descendant of Timothy Jerome, a French Huguenot immigrant who arrived in the New York Colony in 1717. Jerome was born on a farm in the central New York town of Pompey, near Syracuse. His paternal grandmother was Betsy Ball, a relative of George Washington. His maternal ancestry was Scottish.

He originally enrolled in Princeton University, then known as the College of New Jersey (where two of his brothers studied theology and became Presbyterian ministers), as a member of the Class of 1839, before leaving for Union College, where he studied law with his uncle, known as Judge Jerome, and set up a practice in Rochester, New York. He later moved to New York City, where he became a stock speculator and promoter.

Jerome was a flamboyant and successful stock speculator. He made and lost several fortunes, and was known as &quot;The King of Wall Street&quot;. He held interests in several railroad companies and was often a partner in the deals of Cornelius Vanderbilt. He was a patron of the arts, and joined in the founding of the Academy of Music, one of New York City&#x27;s earliest opera houses.

During the New York Draft Riots, Jerome defended the &quot;New York Times&quot; office building with a Gatling Gun. Although he had significant holdings in the &quot;Times&quot;, he was not the majority shareholder as is sometimes erroneously claimed.

The Jerome Mansion, on the corner of Madison Avenue and 26th Street, had a six-hundred-seat theatre, a breakfast room which seated seventy people, a ballroom of white and gold with champagne- and cologne-spouting fountains, and a view of Madison Square Park. It was later sold and housed a series of private clubs. The mansion was demolished in 1967.

=== Sporting activities ===
Jerome was an avid sportsman. He enjoyed yachting with his friend, William K. Vanderbilt. They shared a passion for thoroughbred horse racing and helped found the American Jockey Club.

In the late 1860s, Jerome was part of several hunting trips in the American West. These trips were guided by Buffalo Bill Cody.

In 1866, Jerome bought the estate and mansion of James Bathgate near Old Fordham Village in what was then rural Westchester County, but is now The Bronx. Jerome and financier August Belmont, Sr. built Jerome Park Racetrack on the Bathgate land; the first Belmont Stakes was held there in 1867. Jerome and his brother Lawrence had a wide boulevard made from Macombs Dam to the track, which city authorities attempted to name &quot;Murphy Avenue&quot; after a local politician. This incensed Jerome&#x27;s wife so much that she had bronze plaques saying &quot;Jerome Avenue&quot; made up and bolted into place along the road, forcing the city to accept the name. The racetrack was acquired and demolished by the city in 1894, to make way for Jerome Park Reservoir. The Bathgate mansion served as a summer home for the Jerome family. In the early 1900s, the mansion was razed and replaced by the Kingsbridge Armory.

Jerome became a resident of Brooklyn. He, Vanderbilt, and other investors founded the Coney Island Jockey Club which in 1884 built the Sheepshead Bay Race Track.

==Personal life==

On April 5, 1849, Jerome married Clarissa Hall (1825–1895), daughter of the wealthy Amos Hall, in Palmyra, New York. Together, they had four daughters. One daughter, Camille, died at age eight. The other three – Jeanette, Clarita, and Leonie – became known, in some quarters, as &quot;the Good, the Witty and the Beautiful&quot;. Leonard Jerome&#x27;s wealth afforded his daughters the opportunity to spend much time in Europe, where they associated with the aristocratic elite of the day. All three daughters married British or Anglo-Irish husbands:

* Lady Randolph Churchill (née Jeanette Jerome; known as Jennie), who married Lord Randolph Churchill (1849–1895), younger son of the Duke of Marlborough, and was mother to Winston Churchill and John Strange Spencer-Churchill.
* Clarita Frewen (née Clarita Jerome), known as Clara, who married Moreton Frewen (1853–1924), fifth son of Thomas Frewen MP, a charming spendthrift who ran up huge debts trying to operate a ranch in Wyoming, and through gambling, sports, and women. They had two sons, Hugh and Oswald, and one daughter, Clare Sheridan.
* Leonie, Lady Leslie (née Leonie Jerome), who married Sir John Leslie (1857–1944), an Irish baronet, whose family estates covered . They had four sons. For many years, she maintained a liaison with Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught and Strathearn.

Jerome was also rumored to be the father of the American opera singer Minnie Hauk. He also had an affair in the 1860s with Fanny Ronalds, then separated from her husband. Ronalds later lived in London, where she remained a friend of Jerome&#x27;s daughter Jennie.

Leonard Jerome died at the age of 73 in Brighton, England, surrounded by his wife and surviving daughters. He was originally buried at Kensal Green Cemetery in England, and later buried in the Green-Wood Cemetery in Brooklyn.

== Legacy ==
Jerome Avenue in the Bronx, Jerome Avenue in Brooklyn, Jerome Park Reservoir, and the Jerome Stakes are all named after him.

In 2023 Jerome was posthumously inducted into the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame as a Pillar of the Turf for his contributions to thoroughbred racing.

<doc id="698829" wikidata="Q5563808" url="?curid=698829" title="Giovanni Carrara">
<text>Giovanni Carrara Jiménez (born March 4, 1968) is a Venezuelan former professional baseball pitcher. He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Toronto Blue Jays, Cincinnati Reds, Colorado Rockies, Los Angeles Dodgers, and Seattle Mariners, and in Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB) for the Seibu Lions. He is currently the pitching coach for the Palm Beach Cardinals.

==Career==
Carrera initially struggled as a starting pitcher in the major leagues but later became an effective long reliever. He had a 90–92 MPH fastball, along with a couple of breaking balls, a deceptive slow curve, and particularly his off-speed pitch; a hard one that was somewhere between a slider and cut fastball. He controlled the running game as well, with a good move to both first base and second, and a quick delivery to the plate.

On August 15, 2001, Carrara combined with fellow Venezuelan pitchers Omar Daal, Kelvim Escobar, and Freddy García to win their respective starts: Carrara, of the Dodgers, facing Montreal, 13–1; Daal, in a Phillies victory over the Brewers, 8–6; Escobar, of the Blue Jays, over Oakland, 5–2, and García, of Seattle, against the Red Sox, 6–2. This marked the first time in major league history that four pitchers coming from Venezuela recorded a winning game in their respective starts on the same day.

On August 26, 2006, Carrara was designated for assignment by the Dodgers. He was called up in September 2006 when rosters expanded and used sparingly after re-joining the big league club. The Dodgers chose not to re-sign Carrara in the offseason.

On May 4, 2007, Carrara was signed by the Caffè Danesi Nettuno of Serie A1 in Italy. In 2008, he was 8–2 with a 2.35 ERA and 49 strikeouts.

<doc id="698830" wikidata="Q503958" url="?curid=698830" title="Street light">
<text>A street light, light pole, lamp pole, lamppost, streetlamp, light standard, or lamp standard is a raised source of light on the edge of a road or path. Similar lights may be found on a railway platform. When urban electric power distribution became ubiquitous in developed countries in the 20th century, lights for urban streets followed, or sometimes led.

Many lamps have light-sensitive photocells that activate the lamp automatically when needed, at times when there is little-to-no ambient light, such as at dusk, dawn, or the onset of dark weather conditions. This function in older lighting systems could be performed with the aid of a solar dial. Many street light systems are being connected underground instead of wiring from one utility post to another. Street lights are an important source of public security lighting intended to reduce crime.

==History==
===Preindustrial era===
Early lamps were used in the Ancient Greek and Ancient Roman civilizations, where light primarily served the purpose of security, to both protect the wanderer from tripping on the path over something and keep potential robbers at bay. At that time, oil lamps were used predominantly, as they provided a long-lasting and moderate flame. A slave responsible for lighting the oil lamps in front of Roman villas was called a .

In the words of Edwin Heathcote, &quot;Romans illuminated the streets with oil lamps, and cities from Baghdad to Cordoba were similarly lit when most of Europe was living in what it is now rather unfashionable to call the Dark Ages but which were, from the point of view of street lighting, exactly that.&quot;

So-called &quot;link boys&quot; escorted people from one place to another through the murky, winding streets of medieval towns.

Before incandescent lamps, candle lighting was employed in cities. The earliest lamps required that a lamplighter tour the town at dusk, lighting each of the lamps. According to some sources, illumination was ordered in London in 1417 by Sir Henry Barton, Mayor of London though there is no firm evidence of this. 

Public street lighting was first developed in the 16th century, and accelerated following the invention of lanterns with glass windows by Edmund Heming in London and Jan van der Heyden in Amsterdam, which greatly improved the quantity of light. In 1588 the Parisian Parliament decreed that a torch be installed and lit at each intersection, and in 1594 the police changed this to lanterns. Still, in the mid 17th century it was a common practice for travelers to hire a lantern-bearer if they had to move at night through the dark, winding streets. King Louis XIV authorized sweeping reforms in Paris in 1667, which included the installation and maintenance of lights on streets and at intersections, as well as stiff penalties for vandalizing or stealing the fixtures. Paris had more than 2,700 streetlights by the end of the 17th century, and twice as many by 1730. Under this system, streets were lit with lanterns suspended apart on a cord over the middle of the street at a height of ; as an English visitor enthused in 1698, &#x27;The streets are lit all winter and even during the full moon!&#x27; In London, public street lighting was implemented around the end of the 17th century; a diarist wrote in 1712 that &#x27;All the way, quite through Hyde Park to the Queen&#x27;s Palace at Kensington, lanterns were placed for illuminating the roads on dark nights.&#x27;

A much-improved oil lantern, called a , was introduced in 1745 and improved in subsequent years. The light shed from these réverbères was considerably brighter, enough that some people complained of glare. These lamps were attached to the top of lampposts; by 1817, there were 4,694 lamps on the Paris streets. During the French Revolution (1789–1799), the revolutionaries found that the lampposts were a convenient place to hang aristocrats and other opponents.

===Gas lamp lighting===

The first widespread system of street lighting used piped coal gas as fuel. Stephen Hales was the first person who procured a flammable fluid from the actual distillation of coal in 1726 and John Clayton, in 1735, called gas the &quot;spirit&quot; of coal and discovered its flammability by accident.
William Murdoch (sometimes spelled &quot;Murdock&quot;) was the first to use this gas for the practical application of lighting. In the early 1790s, while overseeing the use of his company&#x27;s steam engines in tin mining in Cornwall, Murdoch began experimenting with various types of gas, finally settling on coal-gas as the most effective. He first lit his own house in Redruth, Cornwall in 1792. In 1798, he used gas to light the main building of the Soho Foundry and in 1802 lit the outside in a public display of gas lighting, the lights astonishing the local population.
The first public street lighting with gas was demonstrated in Pall Mall, London on 4 June 1807 by Frederick Albert Winsor.
In 1811, Engineer Samuel Clegg designed and built what is now considered the oldest extant gasworks in the world. Gas was used to light the worsted mill in the village of Dolphinholme in North Lancashire. The remains of the works, including a chimney and gas plant, have been put on the National Heritage List for England. Clegg&#x27;s installation saved the building&#x27;s owners the cost of up to 1,500 candles every night. It also lit the mill owner&#x27;s house and the street of millworkers&#x27; houses in Dolphinholme.

In 1812, Parliament granted a charter to the London and Westminster Gas Light and Coke Company, and the first gas company in the world came into being. Less than two years later, on 31 December 1813, the Westminster Bridge was lit by gas.

Following this success, gas lighting spread outside London, both within Britain and abroad. The first place outside London in England to have gas lighting, was Preston, Lancashire in 1816, where Joseph Dunn&#x27;s Preston Gaslight Company introduced a new, brighter gas lighting. Another early adopter was the city of Baltimore, where the gaslights were first demonstrated at Rembrandt Peale&#x27;s Museum in 1816, and Peale&#x27;s Gas Light Company of Baltimore provided the first gas streetlights in the United States. In the 1860s, streetlights were started in the Southern Hemisphere in New Zealand.

Kerosene streetlamps were invented by Polish pharmacist Ignacy Łukasiewicz in the city of Lemberg (Austrian Empire), in 1853. His kerosene lamps were later widely used in Bucharest, Paris, and other European cities. He went on to open the world&#x27;s first mine in 1854 and the world&#x27;s first kerosene refinery in 1856 in Jasło, Poland.

In Paris, public street lighting was first installed on a covered shopping street, the Passage des Panoramas, in 1817, private interior gas lighting having been previously demonstrated in a house on the rue Saint-Dominique seventeen years prior. The first gas lamps on the main streets of Paris appeared in January 1829 on the place du Carrousel and the Rue de Rivoli, then on the rue de la Paix, place Vendôme, and rue de Castiglione. By 1857, the &quot;Grands Boulevards&quot; were all lit with gas; a Parisian writer enthused in August 1857: &quot;That which most enchants the Parisians is the new lighting by gas of the boulevards...From the church of the Madeleine all the way to rue Montmartre, these two rows of lamps, shining with a clarity white and pure, have a marvelous effect.&quot; The gaslights installed on the boulevards and city monuments in the 19th century gave the city the nickname &quot;The City of Light.&quot; 

Oil-gas appeared in the field as a rival of coal-gas. In 1815, John Taylor patented an apparatus for the decomposition of &quot;oil&quot; and other animal substances. Public attention was attracted to &quot;oil-gas&quot; by the display of the patent apparatus at Apothecary&#x27;s Hall, by Taylor &amp; Martineau.

====&quot;Farola fernandina&quot;====
&quot;Farola fernandina&quot; is a traditional design of gas streetlight which remains popular in Spain. Essentially, it is a neoclassical French style of gas lamp dating from the late 18th century. It may be either a wall-bracket or standard lamp. The standard base is cast metal with an escutcheon bearing two intertwined letters &#x27;F&#x27;, the Royal cypher of King Ferdinand VII of Spain and commemorates the date of the birth of his daughter, the Infanta Luisa Fernanda, Duchess of Montpensier.

===Arc lamps===
The first electric street lighting employed arc lamps, initially the &quot;electric candle&quot;, &quot;Jablotchkoff candle&quot;, or &quot;Yablochkov candle&quot;, developed by Russian Pavel Yablochkov in 1875. This was a carbon arc lamp employing alternating current, which ensured that both electrodes were consumed at equal rates. In 1876, the common council of the city of Los Angeles ordered four arc lights installed in various places in the fledgling town for street lighting.

On 30 May 1878, the first electric streetlights in Paris were installed on the avenue de l&#x27;Opera and the Place de l&#x27;Étoile, around the Arc de Triomphe, to celebrate the opening of the Paris Universal Exposition. In 1881, to coincide with the Paris International Exposition of Electricity, streetlights were installed on the major boulevards. 

The first streets in London lit with the electrical arc lamp were by the Holborn Viaduct and the Thames Embankment in 1878. More than 4,000 were in use by 1881, though by then an improved differential arc lamp had been developed by Friedrich von Hefner-Alteneck of Siemens &amp; Halske. The United States was quick in adopting arc lighting, and by 1890 over 130,000 were in operation in the US, commonly installed in exceptionally tall moonlight towers.

Arc lights had two major disadvantages. First, they emit an intense and harsh light which, although useful at industrial sites like dockyards, was discomforting in ordinary city streets. Second, they are maintenance-intensive, as carbon electrodes burn away swiftly. With the development of cheap, reliable and bright incandescent light bulbs at the end of the 19th century, arc lights passed out of use for street lighting, but remained in industrial use longer.

===Incandescent lighting===

The first street to be lit by an incandescent lightbulb was Mosley Street, in Newcastle. The street was lit for one night by Joseph Swan&#x27;s incandescent lamp on 3 February 1879. Consequently, Newcastle has the first city street in the world to be lit by electric lighting. 
The first city in the United States to successfully demonstrate electric lighting was Cleveland, Ohio, with 12 electric lights around the Public Square road system on 29 April 1879. Wabash, Indiana, lit 4 Brush arc lamps with 3,000 candlepower each, suspended over their courthouse on 2 February 1880, making the town square &quot;as light as midday&quot;.

Kimberley, Cape Colony (modern South Africa), was the first city in the Southern Hemisphere and in Africa to have electric streetlights – with 16 first lit on 2 September 1882. The system was only the second in the world, after that of Philadelphia, to be powered municipally.

In Central America, San Jose, Costa Rica, lit 25 lamps powered by a hydroelectric plant on 9 August 1884.

Nuremberg was the first city in Germany to have electric public lighting on 7 June 1882, followed by Berlin on 20 September 1882 (Potsdamer Platz only).

Temesvár (Timișoara in present-day Romania) was the first city in the Austrian-Hungarian Monarchy to have electric public lighting, on 12 November 1884; 731 lamps were used.

On 9 December 1882, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia was introduced to electricity by having a demonstration of 8 arc lights, erected along Queen Street Mall. The power to supply these arc lights was taken from a 10 hp Crompton DC generator driven by a Robey steam engine in a small foundry in Adelaide Street and occupied by J. W. Sutton and Co. In 1884, Walhalla, Victoria, had two lamps installed on the main street by the Long Tunnel (Gold) Mining Company. In 1886, the isolated mining town of Waratah in Tasmania was the first to have an extensive system of electrically powered street lighting installed. In 1888, the New South Wales town of Tamworth installed a large system illuminating a significant portion of the city, with over 13 km of streets lit by 52 incandescent lights and 3 arc lights. Powered by a municipal power company, this system gave Tamworth the title of &quot;First City of Light&quot; in Australia.

On 10 December 1885, Härnösand became the first town in Sweden with electric street lighting, following the Gådeå power station being taken into use.

=== Later developments ===
Incandescent lamps were primarily used for street lighting until the advent of high-intensity gas-discharge lamps. They were often operated at high-voltage series circuits. Series circuits were popular since their higher voltage produced more light per watt consumed. Furthermore, before the invention of photoelectric controls, a single switch or clock could control all the lights in an entire district.

To avoid having the entire system go dark if a single lamp burned out, each streetlamp was equipped with a device that ensured that the circuit would remain intact. Early series streetlights were equipped with isolation transformers. that would allow current to pass across the transformer whether the bulb worked or not.

Later, the film cutout was invented. This was a small disk of insulating film that separated two contacts connected to the two wires leading to the lamp. If the lamp failed (an open circuit), the current through the string became zero, causing the voltage of the circuit (thousands of volts) to be imposed across the insulating film, penetrating it (see Ohm&#x27;s law). In this way, the failed lamp was bypassed and power was restored to the rest of the district. The streetlight circuit contained an automatic current regulator, preventing the current from increasing as lamps burned out, preserving the life of the remaining lamps. When the failed lamp was replaced, a new piece of film was installed, once again separating the contacts in the cutout. This system was recognizable by the large porcelain insulator separating the lamp and reflector from the mounting arm. This was necessary because the two contacts in the lamp&#x27;s base may have operated at several thousand volts above ground.

==Modern lights==


Today, street lighting commonly uses high-intensity discharge lamps. Low-pressure sodium (LPS) lamps became commonplace after World War II for their low power consumption and long life. Late in the 20th century, high-pressure sodium (HPS) lamps were preferred, taking further the same virtues. Such lamps provide the greatest amount of photopic illumination for the least consumption of electricity.

Two national standards now allow for variation in illuminance when using lamps of different spectra. In Australia, HPS lamp performance needs to be reduced by a minimum value of 75%. In the UK, illuminances are reduced with higher values S/P ratio.

New street lighting technologies, such as LED or induction lights, emit a white light that provides high levels of scotopic lumens. It is a commonly accepted practice to justify and implement a lower luminance level for roadway lighting based on increased scotopic lumens provided by white light. However, this practice fails to provide the context needed to apply laboratory-based visual performance testing to the real world. Critical factors such as visual adaptation are left out of this practice of lowering luminance levels, leading to reduced visual performance. Additionally, there have been no formal specifications written around Photopic/Scotopic adjustments for different types of light sources, causing many municipalities and street departments to hold back on implementation of these new technologies until the standards are updated. Eastbourne in East Sussex, UK is currently undergoing a project to see 6000 of its streetlights converted to LED and will be closely followed by Hastings in early 2014. Many UK councils are undergoing mass-replacement schemes to LED, and though streetlights are being removed along many long stretches of UK motorways (as they are not needed and cause light pollution), LEDs are preferred in areas where lighting installations are necessary.

Milan, Italy, is the first major city to have entirely switched to LED lighting.

In North America, the city of Mississauga, Canada was one of the first and largest LED conversion projects, with over 46,000 lights converted to LED technology between 2012 and 2014. It is also one of the first cities in North America to use Smart City technology to control the lights. DimOnOff, a company based in Quebec City, was chosen as a Smart City partner for this project. In the United States, the city of Ann Arbor, Michigan was the first metropolitan area to fully implement LED street lighting in 2006. Since then, sodium-vapor lamps were slowly being replaced by LED lamps.

Photovoltaic-powered LED luminaires are gaining wider acceptance. Preliminary field tests show that some LED luminaires are energy-efficient and perform well in testing environments.

In 2007, the Civil Twilight Collective created a variant of the conventional LED streetlight, namely the Lunar-resonant streetlight. These lights increase or decrease the intensity of the streetlight according to the lunar light. This streetlight design thus reduces energy consumption as well as light pollution.

== Measurement ==
Two very similar measurement systems were created to bridge the scotopic and photopic luminous efficiency functions, creating a Unified System of Photometry. These mesopic visual performance models are conducted in laboratory conditions in which the viewer is not exposed to higher levels of luminance than the level being tested for. Further research is needed to bring additional factors into these models such as visual adaptation and the biological mechanics of rod cells before these models are able to accurately predict visual performance in real world conditions. The current understanding of visual adaptation and rod cell mechanics suggests that any benefits from rod-mediated scotopic vision are difficult, if not impossible, to achieve in real world conditions under the presence of high luminance light sources.

Outdoor Site-Lighting Performance (OSP) is a method for predicting and measuring three different aspects of light pollution: glow, trespass and glare. Using this method, lighting specifiers can quantify the performance of existing and planned lighting designs and applications to minimize excessive or obtrusive light leaving the boundaries of a property.

== Advantages ==

Major advantages of street lighting include prevention of automobile accidents and increase in safety. Studies have shown that darkness results in numerous crashes and fatalities, especially those involving pedestrians; pedestrian fatalities are 3 to 6.75 times more likely in the dark than in daylight. At least in the 1980s and 1990s, when automobile crashes were far more common, street lighting was found to reduce pedestrian crashes by approximately 50%. Furthermore, in the 1970s, lighted intersections and highway interchanges tended to have fewer crashes than unlighted intersections and interchanges.

Some say lighting reduces crime, as many would expect. However, others say any correlation (let alone causation) is not found in the data.

Towns, cities, and villages can use the unique locations provided by lampposts to hang decorative or commemorative banners. Many communities in the US use lampposts as a tool for fundraising via lamppost banner sponsorship programs first designed by a US-based lamppost banner manufacturer.

== Disadvantages ==
The major criticisms of street lighting are that it can actually cause accidents if misused, and cause light pollution.

=== Health and safety ===
There are three optical phenomena that need to be recognized in streetlight installations.
* The loss of night vision because of the accommodation reflex of drivers&#x27; eyes is the greatest danger. As drivers emerge from an unlighted area into a pool of light from a streetlight their pupils quickly constrict to adjust to the brighter light, but as they leave the pool of light the dilation of their pupils to adjust to the dimmer light is much slower, so they are driving with impaired vision. Additionally, research has shown that pupil reflexes are more pronounced and post-light recovery takes longer after exposure to blue light compared to red light. This poses a continually increasing risk as blue-rich light sources become more common in roadway lighting and vehicle headlights. As a person gets older, the eye&#x27;s recovery speed gets slower, so driving time and distance under impaired vision increases.
* The loss of night vision due to visual adaptation of retinal cells to a higher luminance level provided by streetlights. Once an individual leaves the illuminated area their retinal cells require adaptation time before they are sensitive to objects and motion under the lower luminance levels of unlit areas.
* Oncoming headlights are more visible against a black background than a grey one. The contrast creates greater awareness of the oncoming vehicle.
* Stray voltage is also a concern in many cities. Stray voltage can accidentally electrify lampposts and has the potential to injure or kill anyone who comes into contact with the post.

There are also physical dangers to the posts of streetlamps, other than children climbing them for recreational purposes. Streetlight stanchions (lampposts) pose a collision risk to motorists and pedestrians, particularly those affected by poor eyesight or under the influence of alcohol. This can be reduced by designing them to break away when hit (known as frangible, collapsible, or &quot;passively safe&quot; supports), protecting them by guardrails, or marking the lower portions to increase their visibility. High winds or accumulated metal fatigue also occasionally topple streetlights.

=== Light pollution ===
==== Astronomy ====
Light pollution can hide the stars and interfere with astronomy. In settings near astronomical telescopes and observatories, low-pressure sodium lamps may be used. These lamps are advantageous over other lamps such as mercury and metal halide lamps because low-pressure sodium lamps emit lower intensity, monochromatic light. Observatories can filter the sodium wavelength out of their observations and virtually eliminate the interference from nearby urban lighting. Full cutoff streetlights also reduce light pollution by reducing the amount of light that is directed at the sky, which also improves the luminous efficiency of the light.

==== Ecosystems ====

Streetlights can impact biodiversity and ecosystems—for instance, disrupting the migration of some nocturnally migrating bird species. In the Netherlands, Philips found that birds can get disoriented by the red wavelengths in street lighting, and in response developed alternative lighting that only emit in the green and blue wavelengths of the visible spectrum. The lamps were installed on Ameland in a small-scale test. If successful, the technology could be used on ships and offshore installations to avoid luring birds towards the open sea at night. Bats can be negatively impacted by streetlights, with evidence showing that red light can be least harmful. As a result, some areas have installed red LED streetlights to minimise disruption to bats. A study published in Science Advances reported that streetlights in southern England had detrimental impacts on local insect populations. Streetlights can also impact plant growth and the number of insects that depend on plants for food.

=== Energy consumption ===
As of 2017, globally 70% of all electricity was generated by burning fossil fuels, a source of air pollution and greenhouse gases, and also globally there are approximately 300 million streetlights using that electricity. Cities are exploring more efficient energy use, reducing streetlight power consumption by dimming lights during off-peak hours and switching to LED streetlights which illuminate a smaller area to a lower level of luminance. Many councils are using a part-night lighting scheme to turn off lighting at quieter times of night. This is typically midnight to 5:30 AM, as seen by the sign on the right. There have, however, been questions about the impact on crime rates. Typical collector road lighting in New York State costs $6,400/mile/year for high pressure sodium at 8.5 kW/mile or $4,000 for light-emitting diode luminaires at 5.4 kW/mile. Improvements can be made by optimising directionality and shape, however. Transitioning to wide angle lights enabled the doubling of distance between streetlights in Flanders from 45 m to 90 m, cutting annual street lighting electricity expenditures to €9 million for the 2,150 km long network that was retrofitted, corresponding to ca. €4,186/km.

== Street light control systems ==

A number of street light control systems have been developed to control and reduce energy consumption of a town&#x27;s public lighting system. These range from controlling a circuit of street lights and/or individual lights with specific ballasts and network operating protocols. These may include sending and receiving instructions via separate data networks, at high frequency over the top of the low voltage supply or wireless.

Street light controllers are smarter versions of the mechanical or electronic timers previously used for street light ON-OFF operation. They come with energy conservation options like twilight saving, staggering or dimming. Many street light controllers come with an astronomical clock for a particular location or a Global Positioning System (GPS) connection to give the best ON-OFF time and energy saving.

===Accessories===

Some intelligent street light controllers also come with Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM), Radio frequency (RF) or General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) communication, user adjusted according to latitude and longitude (low cost type), for better street light management and maintenance. Many street light controllers also come with traffic sensors to manage the lux level of the lamp according to the traffic and to save energy by decreasing lux when there is no traffic. The United States, Canada, India, and many other countries have started introducing street light controllers to their road lighting for energy conservation, street light management and maintenance purpose.

===Economics===
Street light controllers can be expensive in comparison with normal timers, and can cost between $100 and $2,500, but most of them return the investment between 6 months and 2 years. As the equipment&#x27;s lifetime is 7 to 10 years, it saves energy and cost after the initial investment has been recouped.

=== Image-based street light control ===
A number of companies are now manufacturing intelligent street lighting that adjust light output based on usage and occupancy, i.e. automating classification of pedestrian versus cyclist, versus automobile, sensing also velocity of movement and illuminating a certain number of streetlights ahead and fewer behind, depending on velocity of movement. Also, the lights adjust depending on road conditions, for example, snow produces more reflectance therefore reduced light is required.

== Purpose ==
There are three distinct main uses of street lights, each requiring different types of lights and placement. Using the wrong types of lights can make the situation worse by compromising visibility or safety.

=== Beacon lights ===

A modest steady light at the intersection of two roads is an aid to navigation because it helps a driver see the location of a side road as they come closer to it, so that they can adjust their braking and know exactly where to turn if they intend to leave the main road or see vehicles or pedestrians. A beacon light&#x27;s function is to say &quot;here I am&quot; and even a dim light provides enough contrast against the dark night to serve the purpose. To prevent the dangers caused by a car driving through a pool of light, a beacon light must never shine onto the main road, and not brightly onto the side road. In residential areas, this is usually the only appropriate lighting, and it has the bonus side effect of providing spill lighting onto any sidewalk there for the benefit of pedestrians. On Interstate highways, this purpose is commonly served by placing reflectors at the sides of the road.

=== Roadway lights ===

Because of the dangers discussed above, roadway lights are properly used sparingly and only when a particular situation justifies increasing the risk. This usually involves an intersection with several turning movements and much signage, situations where drivers must take in much information quickly that is not in the headlights&#x27; beam. In these situations (a freeway junction or exit ramp), the intersection may be lit so that drivers can quickly see all hazards, and a well-designed plan will have gradually increasing lighting for approximately a quarter of a minute before the intersection and gradually decreasing lighting after it. The main stretches of highways remain unlighted to preserve the driver&#x27;s night vision and increase the visibility of oncoming headlights. If there is a sharp curve where headlights will not illuminate the road, a light on the outside of the curve is often justified.

If it is desired to light a roadway (perhaps due to heavy and fast multi-lane traffic), to avoid the dangers of casual placement of street lights, it should not be lit intermittently since this requires repeated eye readjustment, which causes eyestrain and temporary blindness when entering and leaving light pools. In this case, the system is designed to eliminate the need for headlights. This is usually achieved with bright lights placed on high poles at close, regular intervals so that there is consistent light along the route. The lighting goes from curb to curb.

=== Cycle path lights ===



Policies that encourage utility cycling have been proposed and implemented, including lighting bike paths to increase safety at night.

== Usage on rail transport ==
Lights similar to street lights are used on railway platforms at train stations in the open air. Their purpose is similar to that of beacon lights: they help a train driver see the location of a station at night as the train comes closer to it, so that the driver can adjust the braking and know exactly where to stop. A train station light must never shine directly onto the tracks, and has the bonus side effect of providing spill lighting onto any platform for the benefit of passengers waiting there.

== Maintenance ==

Street lighting systems require ongoing maintenance, which can be classified as either reactive or preventative. Reactive maintenance is a direct response to a lighting failure, such as replacing a discharge lamp after it has failed or replacing an entire lighting unit after it has been hit by a vehicle. Preventative maintenance is the scheduled replacement of lighting components, for example, replacing all the discharge lamps in an area of the city when they have reached 85% of their expected life. Maintenance may be undertaken by the lighting owners or by a contractor.

In the United Kingdom, the Roads Liaison Group has issued a Code of Practice recommending specific reactive and preventative maintenance procedures.

Some street lights in New York City have an orange or red light on top of the luminaire (light fixture) or a red light attached to the lamppost. This indicates that near to this lighting pole or in the same intersection, there is a fire alarm pull box. Other street lights have a small red light next to the street light bulb; when the small light flashes, it indicates an issue with the electric current.

== Street lights as public goods ==
Street lights are the basic example of public goods, which are nonexcludable and nonrival. This means that the producer cannot prevent those who do not pay from consuming, and the consumption of one person cannot prevent the consumption of another person. This becomes a problem for governments, because no private company would have the incentive to produce street lights, which is why most governments are in charge of placing and maintaining street lights. For example, in Armenia, building and maintaining infrastructure is the duty of local self-governance.

<text>The year 1948 saw a number of significant events in radio broadcasting.
==Events==
*22 March – &quot;The Voice of Firestone&quot; becomes the first radio program to be aired on both AM and FM radio stations.
*12 May – &quot;Don McNeill&#x27;s Breakfast Club&quot; appears on television for the first time, via a simulcast on both ABC Radio and ABC TV. The telecast is seen in Philadelphia, Baltimore, Washington and New York. Because ABC-TV&#x27;s New York flagship station WJZ-TV had not signed on yet (and would not for another three months), DuMont flagship WABD carried it live.
* 17 May – The Dewey–Stassen debate becomes the first presidential primary debate to be broadcast on American radio stations.
* 6 August – Truman aide Donald Dawson and U.S. Representative Karl Mundt appear on &quot;Meet the Press&quot;, during which &quot;Newsweek&quot; journalist Ernest Lindley asks Mundt whether Elizabeth Bentley and Whittaker Chambers had spent time in mental institutions (Mundt calls these unjustified rumors).
* 27 August – Whittaker Chambers appears on &quot;Meet the Press&quot; with journalists Nathan Finney, Edward T. Folliard, James Reston, Tom Reynolds, and Lawrence E. Spivak: Folliard asks Chambers immediately whether he will say publicly that Alger Hiss is a Communist, and Chambers does.
*28 September – Thirty-two FM radio stations participate in the &quot;first coast-to-coast exclusively FM 15,000-cycle network program.&quot;

<text>Louisiana Hayride is a radio and later television country music show that was broadcast from the Shreveport Municipal Memorial Auditorium in Shreveport, Louisiana; during its heyday from 1948 to 1960, it helped to launch the careers of some of the greatest names in American country and western music. Created by KWKH station manager Henry Clay, the show is notable as a performance venue for a number of 1950s country musicians, as well as a nascent Elvis Presley.

==Hayride history==
===Beginnings===

The creators of the show took the name from the 1941 book with that title by Harnett Thomas Kane. First broadcast on April 3, 1948, from the Municipal Auditorium in downtown Shreveport, Horace Logan was the original producer and emcee. The musical cast for the inaugural broadcast included the Bailes Brothers, Johnnie and Jack, the Tennessee Mountain Boys with Kitty Wells, the Four Deacons, Curley Kinsey and the Tennessee Ridge Runners, Harmie Smith, the Ozark Mountaineers, the Mercy Brothers, and Tex Grimsley and the Texas Showboys.

===Popularization===
The show was soon made into a Broadway attraction called &quot;Louisiana Hayride&quot;. Within a year of its debut, the program was so popular that a regional 25-station network was set up to broadcast portions of the show, and was even heard overseas on Armed Forces Radio. The flagship station of the program was KWKH/1130 in Shreveport. The popularity of &quot;Louisiana Hayride&quot; spawned various incarnations in other parts of the United States, most notably in Cincinnati on WLW radio and later television; its version was dubbed &quot;Midwestern Hayride&quot;.
Beginning with the successful first show on April 3, 1948, &quot;Louisiana Hayride&quot; ranked second only to Nashville&#x27;s &quot;Grand Ole Opry&quot; in terms of importance until ABC began telecasting &quot;Ozark Jubilee&quot; in 1955. Hank Williams began performing on the &quot;Hayride&quot; in 1948 after his initial rejection from the Grand Ole Opry, and after being fired from the Opry on August 11, 1952, Williams returned to the &quot;Hayride&quot; briefly before his death on New Years Day, 1953.

===Talent-scouting showcase===
While the &quot;Opry&quot;, the &quot;Jubilee&quot;, and the &quot;Hayride&quot; all showcased established stars, the &quot;Hayride&quot; was where talented, but virtual unknowns, were also given exposure to a large audience. Over the years, country music greats such as Webb Pierce, Kitty Wells, Jimmie Davis, Will Strahan, Slim Whitman, Floyd Cramer, Sonny James, Hank Snow, Faron Young, Johnny Horton, Jim Reeves, Claude King, Jimmy Martin, George Jones, John and The Three Wise Men, Johnny Cash, Frankie Miller, Tex Ritter, Willie Nelson, Bob Wills, Cowboy Jack Hunt &amp; Little Joe Hunt of the Rhythm Ranch Hands, Nat Stuckey, and Lefty Frizzell, among many others, performed on &quot;Louisiana Hayride&quot;.

===The Elvis Presley connection===
By mid-1954, a special 30-minute portion of &quot;Louisiana Hayride&quot; was being broadcast every Saturday on the AFN Pacific channel of the United Kingdom Scottish Forces Radio Network. On October 16 of that year, Elvis Presley appeared on the radio program. Presley&#x27;s performance of his debut release on the Sun Records label, &quot;That&#x27;s All Right&quot;, brought a tepid response, according to former &quot;Hayride&quot; emcee Frank Page (1925–2013). Nonetheless, Presley was signed to a one-year contract for future appearances. Presley became so popular that after his final appearance on &quot;Hayride&quot; in 1956, emcee Horace Logan announced to the crowd a phrase that would become famous: &quot;Elvis has left the building.&quot;

The immediate and enormous demand for more of Presley&#x27;s new kind of rockabilly music actually resulted in a sharp decline in the popularity of the &quot;Louisiana Hayride&quot; that until that point had been strictly a country-music venue. On March 3, 1955, Presley made his first television appearance on the TV version of &quot;The Louisiana Hayride&quot;, carried by KSLA-TV, the CBS affiliate in Shreveport.

===Cancellation and revivals===

Within a few years, rock and roll had come to dominate the music scene, and on August 27, 1960, &quot;Louisiana Hayride&quot; ended its primary run. However, KWKH continued to use the &quot;Louisiana Hayride&quot; name for packaged music tours throughout the 1960s on a biweekly, monthly, or quarterly basis, finally ending operations entirely in 1969. In August 1974, Shreveport businessman David Kent mounted a country-music show originally called &quot;Hayride U.S.A.&quot;, which was retitled &quot;Louisiana Hayride&quot; in 1975 after KWKH agreed to let Kent use the name. Located at a new dinner theater facility in Bossier City, this new &quot;Louisiana Hayride&quot; was syndicated on radio and ran until 1987, discovering such talent as Branson fiddle sensation Shoji Tabuchi and popular country singer Linda Davis.

Some strictly local performances have been done in the Shreveport area under the name, including a 2003 &quot;Louisiana Hayride&quot; cast reunion called &quot;One More Ride&quot; that featured 60 acts from the original show, including Kitty Wells, the Browns, Betty Amos, Homer Bailes, Billy Walker, Mitchell Torok, and Hank Thompson. Barney Cannon (1955–2009), a KWKH deejay, became a specialist on the history of country music, KWKH, and the &quot;Hayride&quot;. In August 2009, the &quot;Louisiana Hayride&quot; (1948–1960) was inducted into the Louisiana Music Hall of Fame.

In 2009, after several years of litigation over the &quot;Louisiana Hayride&quot; name and trademark, a federal court ruled that Margaret Lewis Warwick owned the rights to the name. As of May 31, 2012, KWKH had changed to a sports format and ceased producing the classic country-music format reminiscent of the &quot;Hayride&quot; era.

==&quot;At the Louisiana Hayride Tonight&quot;==
&quot;At the Louisiana Hayride Tonight,&quot; a set of 20 CDs with 599 &quot;Hayride&quot; performances, was released in October 2017 by Bear Family Records. The release includes a book on the Hayride&#x27;s history. A live recording of &quot;Jambalaya (On the Bayou),&quot; by Hank Williams, is included in the set. The set includes archival material from the collection of Chris Brown, Archivist at Centenary College of Louisiana in Shreveport, with the bulk of the audio and images in the set sourced from an archive originally assembled by Joey Kent between 1992–2009 and donated to the Library of Congress in 2009.

<text>The Battle of Kings Mountain was a military engagement between Patriot and Loyalist militias in South Carolina during the southern campaign of the American Revolutionary War, resulting in a decisive victory for the Patriots. The battle took place on October 7, 1780, south of the present-day town of Kings Mountain, North Carolina. In what is now rural Cherokee County, South Carolina, the Patriot militia defeated the Loyalist militia commanded by British Major Patrick Ferguson of the 71st Regiment of Foot. The battle has been described as &quot;the war&#x27;s largest all-American fight&quot;.

Ferguson had arrived in North Carolina in early September 1780 to recruit troops for the Loyalist militia and protect the flank of Lord Cornwallis&#x27;s main force. Ferguson challenged Patriot militias to lay down their arms or suffer the consequences. In response, the Patriot militias led by Benjamin Cleveland, James Johnston, William Campbell, John Sevier, Joseph McDowell, and Isaac Shelby rallied to attack Ferguson and his forces. Receiving intelligence on the oncoming attack, Ferguson decided to retreat to the safety of Lord Cornwallis&#x27;s army. However, the Patriots caught up with the Loyalists at Kings Mountain near the border with South Carolina. 

Achieving a complete surprise, the Patriot militiamen attacked and surrounded the Loyalists, inflicting severe casualties. After an hour of battle, Ferguson was fatally shot while trying to break the Patriot line, after which his men surrendered. Some Patriots gave no quarter until their officers re-established control over their men; they were said to be seeking revenge for alleged killings by Banastre Tarleton&#x27;s militiamen at the Battle of Waxhaws, under the slogan &quot;Remember Tarleton&#x27;s Quarter&quot;. Although victorious, the Patriots had to retreat quickly from the area for fear of Cornwallis&#x27; advance. Later they executed nine Loyalist prisoners after a short trial.

The battle was a pivotal event in the southern campaign. The surprising victory of the American Patriot militia over the Loyalists came after a string of Patriot defeats at the hands of Cornwallis, and greatly raised the Patriots&#x27; morale. With Ferguson dead and his Loyalist militia destroyed, Cornwallis transferred his army into North Carolina and eventually Virginia.

==Prelude==
British Major Patrick Ferguson was appointed Inspector of Militia on May 22, 1780. His task was to march to the old Tryon County area, raise and organize Loyalist units from the Tory population of the Carolina backcountry, and protect the left flank of Lord Cornwallis&#x27; main body at Charlotte, North Carolina.

===Battle of Musgrove&#x27;s Mill===
On the morning of August 18, 1780, 200 mounted Patriot partisans under joint command of Colonels Isaac Shelby, James Williams, and Elijah Clarke prepared to raid a Loyalist camp at Musgrove&#x27;s Mill, which controlled the local grain supply and guarded a ford of the Enoree River. The Battle of Musgrove Mill occurred on August 19 near the ford. The Patriots anticipated surprising a garrison of about an equal number of Loyalists, but a local farmer informed them that the Tories had recently been reinforced by about 100 Loyalist militia and 200 provincial regulars on their way to join Ferguson. The battle took perhaps an hour; within that period, 63 Tories were killed, an unknown number wounded, and 70 were taken prisoner. The Patriots lost about four dead and twelve wounded.

Some Patriot leaders briefly considered attacking the Loyalist stronghold at Ninety Six, South Carolina; but they hurriedly dispersed after learning that a large Patriot army had been defeated at Camden three days prior.

===Pursuit of Shelby===
Shelby&#x27;s forces covered 60 miles with Ferguson in hot pursuit before making their escape. In the wake of General Horatio Gates&#x27; blundering defeat at Camden, the victory at Musgrove Mill heartened the Patriots and served as further evidence that the South Carolina backcountry could not be held by the Tories.

Shelby and his men crossed over the Appalachian Mountains and retreated back into the territory of the Watauga Association at Sycamore Shoals in present-day Elizabethton, Tennessee. On September 2, Ferguson and his militia marched west in pursuit of Shelby toward the Appalachian Mountain hill country on what is now the Tennessee/North Carolina border. By September 10, Ferguson had established a base camp at Gilbert Town, North Carolina and, according to Shelby issued a challenge to the Patriot leaders to lay down their arms or he would &quot;lay waste to their country with fire and sword&quot;. Shelby and Colonel John Sevier met at Sycamore Shoals and agreed to lead their militiamen against him.

===Muster at Sycamore Shoals===
Patriot leaders sent word to Virginia militia leader William Campbell, asking him to join them at Sycamore Shoals. Campbell called on Benjamin Cleveland to bring his Wilkes County, North Carolina, militia to the rendezvous. The detachments of Shelby, Sevier, and Campbell were met by 160 North Carolina militiamen led by Charles McDowell and his brother Joseph. Campbell&#x27;s cousin, Arthur Campbell, brought 200 more Virginians. About 1,100 volunteers from southwest Virginia and today&#x27;s northeast Tennessee, known as the &quot;Overmountain Men&quot; because they had settled into the wilderness west of the Appalachian Mountains ridgeline, mustered at the rendezvous on September 25, 1780, at Sycamore Shoals. Their movement had been made possible by easing tensions with the Cherokee, thanks to diplomacy by Benjamin Cleveland&#x27;s brother-in-law, Indian agent Joseph Martin. The Overmountain Men crossed Roan Mountain and proceeded in a southerly direction for about 13 days in anticipation of fighting the Loyalist forces. By September 30, they had reached Quaker Meadows in Burke County, North Carolina, the home of the McDowell brothers, where they united with Cleveland and 350 men. Now 1,400 strong, the Patriots marched to South Mountain, North Carolina. The five colonels leading the Patriot force (Shelby, Sevier, William Campbell, Joseph McDowell and Cleveland) chose William Campbell as the nominal commander, but they agreed that all five would act in council to command their combined army.
Meanwhile, two deserters from the Patriot militia reached Ferguson and informed him of the large body of militia advancing towards him. Waiting three days for reasons that are unclear, Ferguson ordered a retreat to Cornwallis and the British main forces in Charlotte, sending a message to Cornwallis requesting reinforcements. The request did not reach Cornwallis until one day after the battle. On October 1, Ferguson reached the Broad River where he issued another pugnacious public letter, calling the local militia to join him lest they be &quot;pissed upon by a set of mongrels&quot; (the Overmountain Men).

On October 4, the Patriot militia reached Ferguson&#x27;s former camp at Gilbert Town, where 30 Georgia militiamen joined them, anxious for action. On October 6, they reached Cowpens, South Carolina, where they received word that Ferguson was east of them, heading towards Charlotte and Cornwallis. They hurried to catch him. Patriot spies reported Ferguson was making camp on Kings Mountain with some 1,200 men. Ferguson, rather than pushing on until he reached Charlotte and safety (just a day&#x27;s march away), camped at Kings Mountain and sent Cornwallis another letter asking for reinforcements. Kings Mountain is one of many rocky forested hills in the upper Piedmont, near the border between North and South Carolina. It is shaped like a footprint with the highest point at the heel, a narrow instep, and a broad rounded toe. The Loyalists camped on a ridge west of Kings Pinnacle, the highest point on Kings Mountain.

Needing to hurry, the Patriot militia put 900 men on horseback and rode for Kings Mountain. They left immediately, marching through the night of October 6 and morning of October 7, even though the rain never stopped. By sunrise they forded the Broad River, 15 miles from Kings Mountain. By early afternoon they arrived and immediately surrounded the ridge and attacked.

==Battle==

The battle opened about 3 p.m., when the 900 Patriots (including John Crockett, father of Davy Crockett) approached the steep base of the western ridge. They formed eight detachments of 100 to 200 men each. Ferguson was unaware that the Patriots had caught up to him and his 1,100 men. He was the only regular British soldier in the command, composed entirely of Loyalist Carolina militia, except for the 100 or so red-uniformed Provincials (enlisted colonials) from New York. He had not thought it necessary to fortify his camp.

The Patriots caught the Loyalists by surprise. Loyalist officer Alexander Chesney later wrote he did not know the Patriots were anywhere near them until the shooting started. As the screaming Patriots charged up the hill, Dutch-American Loyalist Captain Abraham de Peyster turned to Ferguson and said, &quot;These things are ominous – these are the damned yelling boys!&quot; Two parties, led by Sevier and Campbell, assaulted the mountain&#x27;s &quot;heel&quot;—the smallest in area but its highest point. The other detachments, led by Shelby, Williams, Lacey, Cleveland, Hambright, Winston and McDowell, attacked the main Loyalist position, surrounding the base beside the crest.

No one in the Patriot army held command once the fighting started. Each detachment fought independently under the previously agreed-to plan to surround and destroy the Loyalists. The Patriots crept up the hill and fired from behind rocks and trees. Ferguson rallied his troops and launched a desperate bayonet charge against Campbell and Sevier. Lacking bayonets, the Patriots ran down the hill and into the woods. Campbell soon rallied his troops, returned to the hill, and resumed firing. Ferguson ordered two more bayonet charges during the battle. This became the pattern of the battle; the Patriots would charge up the hill, then the Tories would charge down the hill with fixed bayonets, driving the Patriots off the slopes and into the woods. Once the charge was spent and the Tories returned to their positions, the Patriots would reform in the woods, return to the base of the hill, and charge up the hill again. During one of the charges, Williams was killed, and McDowell was wounded. Firing was difficult for the Loyalists, since the Patriots constantly moved using cover and concealment to their advantage. Furthermore, the downhill angle of the hill contributed to the Loyalists overshooting their marks.

After an hour of combat, Loyalist casualties were heavy. Ferguson rode back and forth across the hill, blowing a silver whistle he used to signal charges. Shelby, Sevier and Campbell reached the top of the hill behind the Loyalist position and attacked Ferguson&#x27;s rear. The Loyalists were driven back into their camp, where they began to surrender. Ferguson drew his sword and hacked down any small white flags that he saw popping up, but he appeared to know that the end was near. In an attempt to rally his faltering men, Ferguson shouted out &quot;Hurrah, brave boys, the day is ours!&quot; He gathered a few officers together and tried to cut through the Patriot ring, but Sevier&#x27;s men fired a volley and Ferguson was shot and dragged by his horse behind the Patriot line. There he was confronted by an opposing Patriot officer, who demanded a surrender from the major. Ferguson shot and killed the man with his pistol in a final act of defiance but was immediately shot dead by multiple Patriots on the spot. When the Patriots recovered his corpse, they counted seven bullet wounds.

Seeing their leader fall, the Loyalists began to surrender. Some Patriots did not want to take prisoners, as they were eager to avenge the Battle of Waxhaws or &#x27;Tarleton&#x27;s Quarter&#x27;, in which Banastre Tarleton&#x27;s forces killed a sizable number of Abraham Buford&#x27;s Continental soldiers after the latter raised the white flag of surrender. (At Waxhaws, Tarleton&#x27;s horse was shot, pinning him to the ground and leading his men to believe their commanding officer had been killed under a white flag of surrender.) Also, other Patriots were seemingly unaware that the Loyalists were trying to surrender.

Loyalist Captain de Peyster, in command after Ferguson was killed, sent out an emissary with a white flag, asking for quarter. For several minutes, the Patriots rejected de Peyster&#x27;s white flag and continued firing, many of them shouting, &quot;Give &#x27;em Tarleton&#x27;s Quarter!&quot; and &quot;Give them Buford&#x27;s play!&quot; A significant number of the surrendering Loyalists were killed or wounded including the white flag emissary. When de Peyster sent out a second white flag, a few of the Patriot officers, including Campbell and Sevier, ran forward and took control by ordering their men to cease fire. They took about 700 Loyalist prisoners.

==Aftermath==
The Battle of Kings Mountain lasted 65 minutes. The Loyalists suffered 290 killed, 163 wounded, and 668 taken prisoner. The Patriot militia suffered 28 killed and 60 wounded. The Patriots had to move out quickly for fear that Cornwallis would advance to meet them. Loyalist prisoners well enough to walk were herded to camps several miles from the battlefield. The dead were buried in shallow graves, and wounded were left on the field to die. Ferguson&#x27;s corpse was later reported to have been desecrated and wrapped in oxhide before burial. Both victors and captives came near to starvation on the march due to a lack of supplies in the hastily organized Patriot army.

On October 20, the retreating Patriot force held drumhead courts-martial of Loyalists on various charges (treason, desertion from Patriot militias, incitement of Indian rebellion). Passing through the Sunshine community in what is now Rutherford County, North Carolina, the retreat halted on the property of the Biggerstaff family. Aaron Biggerstaff, a Loyalist, had fought in the battle and had been mortally wounded. His brother Benjamin was a Patriot and was being held as a prisoner-of-war on a British ship docked at Charleston, South Carolina. Their cousin John Moore was the Loyalist commander at the earlier Battle of Ramsour&#x27;s Mill (modern Lincolnton, North Carolina), in which many of the combatants at Kings Mountain had participated on one side or the other. While stopped on the Biggerstaff land, the American Patriots convicted 36 Loyalist prisoners. Some were testified against by Patriots who had previously fought alongside them and later changed sides. Nine of the prisoners were hanged before Isaac Shelby brought an end to the proceedings. Many of the Patriots dispersed over the next few days, while all but 130 of the Loyalist prisoners escaped while being led in single file through woodlands. The column finally made camp at Salem, North Carolina.

Lieutenant Anthony Allaire, a New York Loyalist attached to Ferguson&#x27;s unit, was captured at the battle and endured the forced march and mistreatment of prisoners. He eventually escaped and was able to make his way back to British forces in Charleston. His published diary gives an account of the months leading up to the battle, a brief account of the battle, his time as a prisoner of Patriot forces, and his eventual escape.

Kings Mountain was a pivotal moment in the history of the American Revolution. Coming after a series of disasters and humiliations in the Carolinas—the fall of Charleston and capture of the American army there, the destruction of another American army at the Battle of Camden, the Waxhaws massacre—the surprising decisive victory at Kings Mountain was a great boost to Patriot morale. The Tories of the Carolina backcountry were broken as a military force. Additionally, the destruction of Ferguson&#x27;s command and the looming threat of Patriot militia in the mountains caused Cornwallis to cancel his plans to invade North Carolina; he instead evacuated Charlotte and retreated to South Carolina. He would not return to North Carolina until early 1781, when he was chasing Nathanael Greene after the Americans had dealt British forces another defeat at the Battle of Cowpens.

In &quot;The Winning of the West&quot;, Theodore Roosevelt writes of Kings Mountain, &quot;This brilliant victory marked the turning point of the American Revolution.&quot; Thomas Jefferson called it &quot;The turn of the tide of success&quot;. President Herbert Hoover at Kings Mountain said,

In 1931, the Congress of the United States created the Kings Mountain National Military Park at the site of the battle. The park headquarters is in Blacksburg, South Carolina, and hosts hundreds of thousands of people each year.

<text>Edwin Amilgar Hurtado (born February 1, 1970) is a Venezuelan former middle relief pitcher in Major League Baseball who played from 1995 through 1997 for the Toronto Blue Jays and Seattle Mariners. Listed at 6&#x27; 3&quot; , 215 lb. , Hurtado batted and threw right-handed. He was born in Barquisimeto, the capital city of Lara state.

Hurtado was a reliable and durable pitcher during a professional career that spanned 17 years. Considered a workhorse who could pitch every year in different leagues, he relied on a lively fastball and an array of breaking pitches to establish himself as one of the most dependable pitchers in Venezuelan baseball history.

In a three-year majors career, Hurtado posted an 8–9 record with a 6.67 ERA in 43 pitching appearances, including 15 starts and two saves, allowing 111 runs (107 earned) on 85 walks and 167 hits while striking out 79 batters in innings of work.

Hurtado also pitched 13 Minor League seasons from 1993 to 2006, including stints for the NPB Orix BlueWave in the 1998 and 1999 seasons, and for the KBO LG Twins in 2004. Overall, he went 85–66 with a 3.92 ERA and six saves in 288 games.

In between, Hurtado played winter ball with the Cardenales de Lara and Leones del Caracas clubs of the Venezuelan Professional Baseball League during 16 campaigns from 1991 to 2006. He had a record of 68–47 with a 3.06 ERA and three saves in 199 games, including 631 strikeouts and 314 walks in innings.

Following his retirement, Hurtado became a pitching coach and has worked for several teams both in the Mexican League and the Venezuelan circuit.

<text>The following is a timeline of the Canadian federal election, 2004. More on the election in general is available in the article 2004 Canadian federal election.

==2002==
*May 13 - In seven by-elections across the country, the Liberal Party of Canada is re-elected in two ridings in Quebec, one in Newfoundland and Labrador, and one in Manitoba while losing one to the New Democratic Party (NDP) in Windsor West, where Brian Masse was elected, and one to the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada, when Rex Barnes was elected. The leader of the Canadian Alliance, Stephen Harper wins easily in Calgary Southwest, replacing out-going former Reform Party of Canada leader Preston Manning.
*June 2 - Paul Martin resigns as Minister of Finance. John Manley is named to replace him.
*August 21 - Prime Minister Jean Chrétien tells Canadians he will step down in February 2004.
*December 9 - The Bloc Québécois is able to hold on to two seats in by-elections electing Roger Gaudet in Berthier—Montcalm, replacing Michel Bellehumeur, and electing Sébastien Gagnon in Lac-Saint-Jean—Saguenay, replacing Stéphan Tremblay. Despite winning both elections, these elections were very close, especially since in the 2000 election these seats were won by 15 000 and 14 000 votes respectively.

==2003==

*January 25 - Jack Layton is elected leader of the NDP at the party&#x27;s convention in Toronto. Layton wins on the first ballot, with 53.5% of the vote.
*February 5 - Pierrette Venne is suspended from the caucus of the Bloc Québécois, and on February 6 sits as an Independent member of the Bloc.
*February 14 - Jim Harris is elected as the new leader of the Green Party of Canada.
*May 12 - The Liberal Party loses another seat through by-elections, this time to the Progressive Conservative Party as Gary Schellenberger replaces John Alexander Richardson in the riding of Perth—Middlesex.

<text>A carton is a box or container usually made of liquid packaging board, paperboard and sometimes of corrugated fiberboard.
Many types of cartons are used in packaging. Sometimes a carton is also called a box.

==Types of cartons==

===Folding cartons===
A carton is a type of packaging typically made from paperboard that is suitable for food, pharmaceuticals, hardware, and many other types of products. Folding cartons are usually combined into a tube at the manufacturer and shipped flat (knocked down) to the packager. Tray styles have a solid bottom and are often shipped as flat blanks and assembled by the packager. Some also are self-erecting. High-speed equipment is available to set up, load, and close the cartons.

===Egg carton===
Egg cartons or trays are designed to protect whole eggs while in transit. Traditionally, these have been made of molded pulp. This uses recycled newsprint which is molded into a shape which protects the eggs. More recently, egg cartons have also been made from expanded polystyrene and PET.

===Aseptic carton===
Cartons for liquids can be fabricated from laminates of liquid packaging board, foil, and polyethylene. Most are based on either Tetra Pak or SIG Combibloc systems. One option is to have the printed laminate supplied on a roll. The carton is cut, scored, and formed at the packager. A second option is to have the pre-assembled tubes delivered to the packaging plant for completion and filling. These are suited for aseptic processing and are used for milk, soup, juice, etc. Paperboard-based cartons are lighter compared to a similarly sized steel can, but are harder to recycle. Some open-loop recycling operations pelletize or flatten ground-up cartons for use in building materials; closed-loop recycling is possible by separating the layers before processing, though some recyclers only recycle the cardboard fibers.

=== Perga carton ===
Perga cartons entered production in 1932 as a leak-proof can during World War I. Jagenberg Werke AG, in Düsseldorf, Germany, patented the design. The carton had a ribbed texture and paper sleeves covered in paraffin material, which provided a seamed structure from base to lid. Most cartons had a capacity of 200 mL. Development of the carton slowed during World War II, but the design would see a revival within European markets in the 1960s.

===Gable top===

Gable top cartons are often used for liquid products such as milk, juice, etc. These use polyethylene-coated paperboard or other liquid packaging board and sometimes a foil laminate. Most are opened by pushing open the gables at the top back and pulling the top (spout) out. Some have fitments to assist in opening and eating the contents.

=== Waxed paperboard beverage carton (historical) ===
Cuboid waxed paperboard beverage, a formed waxed paperboard plug crimped and sealed, preceded gabled polyethylene-coated paperboard cartons. Waxed paper straws were used to drink. Borden distributed milk in this way.

==Packaging history==
Robert Gair was a Brooklyn printer and paper-bag maker during the 1870s. While he was printing an order of seed bags, a metal rule normally used to crease bags shifted in position and cut the bag. Gair concluded that cutting and creasing paperboard in one operation would have advantages; the first automatically made carton, now referred to as &quot;semi-flexible packaging&quot;, was created.

;Folded carton
In 1817, the first commercial cardboard box production began in England. In 1879, Robert Gair, in Brooklyn, New York, operated a factory that die-ruled, cut, and scored paperboard into a single impression of a folded carton. By 1896, the National Biscuit Company was the first to use cartons to package crackers.

During the first decade of the 1900s, G. W. Maxwell developed the first paper milk carton.

;Milk carton
In 1908, Dr. Winslow, of Seattle, Washington, described paper milk containers that were commercially sold in San Francisco and Los Angeles as early as 1906. The inventor of this carton was G.W. Maxwell. Later, in 1915 John Van Wormer of Toledo, Ohio, received the a patent for the gable-topped, wax-coated, &quot;paper bottle,&quot; a folded blank box for holding milk, calling it the &quot;Pure-Pak.&quot; The milk carton could be folded, glued, filled with milk, and sealed at a dairy farm. In 1953, Seok-kyun Shin introduced the gable-topped milk carton to Korea. In the 1960s, Mario Lepore, a Detroit engineer designed a machine to fold and seal a gable top paper carton.

In 1957 paper milk carton company Kieckhefer Container Co. merged with the Weyerhauser Timber Company of Tacoma, Washington.

==Shape==

Although quite often shaped like a cuboid, it is not uncommon to find cartons lacking right angles and straight edges, as in squrounds used for ice cream.

Tetrahedrons and other shapes are available. Cartons with a hexagonal or octagonal cross sections are sometimes used for specialty items.

==Materials==

Cartons can be made from many materials: paperboard, duplex, white kraft, recycled and many more various plastics, or a composite. Some are &quot;food grade&quot; for direct contact with foods. Many cartons are made out of a single piece of paperboard. Depending on the need, this paperboard can be waxed or coated with polyethylene to form a moisture barrier. This may serve to contain a liquid product or keep a powder dry.

==Artistic design and other imagery==
In art history, the carton (pronounced the French way) was a drawing on heavy pasteboard or paperboard, used as life-size design for the manufacture in an atelier of a valuable tapestry, such as a gobelin. During the weaving it hung behind the tapestry in the making, a time-consuming process thus in a creative sense simplified to &#x27;mechanical&#x27; painting-by-numbers.

As these were extremely valuable, often commanded by the very richest art-buyers, including princes who hung them in their palaces and even took them on their travels as prestigious displays of wealth, often with a visual message, especially the world-famous Flemish ateliers were deemed worthy to have cartons made by some of the greatest graphic artists of the time, including such celebrated painters as Rubens.

In the 1980s, milk cartons in the United States often printed photos of missing children with the hope that someone would recognize the photograph and provide information to police.

Many milk cartons also included advertisements and sponsors. These images and sponsors ranged from DVDs, Cereal, Cartoons, Frozen Dinners, and Albums.

==Carton-pierre==
&quot;Carton-pierre&quot; was a material used for the making of raised ornaments for wall and ceiling decoration. It is composed of the pulp of paper mixed with whiting (ground calcium carbonate) and glue, this being forced into plaster moulds backed with paper, and then removed to a drying room to harden. It is much stronger and lighter than common plaster-of-Paris ornaments, and is not so liable to chip or break if struck with anything.

== Beverages &amp; snacks found in cartons ==
There&#x27;s a plethora of beverages and snacks found within carton-packaging. This includes milk, juices, egg whites, coffee, protein shakes, water, and even snacks like Goldfish and Whoppers.

<doc id="698862" wikidata="Q283367" url="?curid=698862" title="Mahbub ul Haq">
<text>Mahbub ul-Haq (; ) was a Pakistani economist, international development theorist, and politician who served as the minister of Finance from 10 April 1985 to 28 January 1986, and again from June to December 1988 as a caretaker. Regarded as one of the greatest economists of his time, Haq devised the Human Development Index, widely used to gauge the development of nations.

After graduating with a degree in economics from the Government College University in Lahore, he won a scholarship to the University of Cambridge in England, where he obtained a second higher degree in the same field. He later received his PhD from Yale University in the United States and conducted postdoctoral research at the Harvard Kennedy School. Haq returned to Pakistan to serve as the chief economist of the Planning Commission throughout the 1960s. In 1970, after the fall of Ayub Khan, Haq moved to Washington, D.C. to serve at the World Bank as Director of Policy Planning until 1982, where he played a major role in reorienting its approach to assisting development in low-income countries.

He returned to Pakistan in 1982, and in 1985 assumed the position of Finance Minister with the Government of Pakistan, and oversaw a period of economic liberalization in the country. In 1989, he moved back to the United States, where he served as the special adviser to the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) under its head, William Henry Draper III. At the UNDP, Haq led the establishment of the Human Development Report and the widely-respected Human Development Index (HDI), which measures development by well-being, rather than by financial income alone. He returned to Pakistan in 1996 to establish the Human Development Centre in the capital city of Islamabad.

Haq is considered to have had a profound effect on global development. His 1995 book, &quot;Reflections on Human Development&quot;, is said to have opened new avenues to policy proposals for human development paradigms, such as the United Nations Global Compact that was formed in 2000. Amartya Sen and Tam Dalyell judged Haq&#x27;s work to have &quot;brought about a major change in the understanding and statistical accounting of the process of development&quot;. &quot;The Economist&quot; called him &quot;one of the visionaries of international development&quot;. He was widely regarded as &quot;the most articulate and persuasive spokesman for the developing world&quot;.

== Early life and education ==
Haq was born into a Punjabi Muslim family on 24 February 1934 in the city of Gurdaspur, Punjab Province, British India (now located in the Republic of India). His teenage years saw widespread intercommunal violence and forced migration following the independence of India and Pakistan from British rule in August 1947. He and his family migrated from India to the newly-created state of Pakistan following the partition of India; Haq stated that they narrowly escaped being killed in one of the refugee trains heading to Pakistan. After reaching Lahore, Haq was given government-sponsored housing and decided to continue his education.

In 1953, he graduated with a degree in economics from Lahore&#x27;s Government College University. He later earned a scholarship to attend Cambridge University, where he earned another BA in the same discipline alongside Indian economist Amartya Sen, with whom he formed a close friendship. After renewing his scholarship, Haq went to United States for his doctoral studies at Yale University and obtained a PhD. Later, Haq carried out postdoctoral work at Harvard University in 1960–61.

==Career==
Upon returning to Pakistan in 1957 at the age of 23, Haq joined the Planning Commission as Assistant Chief while it prepared its first Five-Year Plan.
Influenced by the dominant economic thought in American academia, Haq advocated capitalism as the economic base of the national economy and helped guide the government to apply free-market principles to boost the economy. This approach was wholeheartedly embraced by the military government of General Ayub Khan after it came to power in October 1958. By the 1960s as Chief Economist of the Planning Commission Haq was delivering speeches all over the country in support of these economic policies.

While the international community was applauding Pakistan as a model of development, Haq developed concerns that all was not well with the distribution of the benefits of growth. Rapid economic development made Haq&#x27;s team doubt the long-term viability of such a pattern of growth, and he increasingly supported heavier taxation of the asset owning classes. In a widely reported speech to the Applied Economics Research Centre at the University of Karachi in April 1968, Haq alleged that &quot;22 industrial family groups had come to dominate the economic and financial life-cycle of Pakistan and that they controlled about two-thirds of industrial assets, 80% of banking and 79% of insurance assets in the industrial domain.&quot; The list included Dawood family of Dawood Group, Saigols of Saigol Group, Adamjees of Adamjee Group, Colony, Fancy, Valika, Jalil, Bawany, Crescent, Wazir Ali, Gandhara, Ispahani, House of Habib, Khyber, Nishat Group, Beco, Gul Ahmed Group, Arag, Hafiz, Karim, Milwala and Dada.

These revelations played a major role in mobilising millions in a massive grassroots protest movement that led to Field Marshal Ayub Khan&#x27;s overthrow in March 1969. Following Ayub&#x27;s fall, Haq accepted an invitation from Robert McNamara, president of the World Bank to serve as his Director of Policy Planning. During his tenure (1970–82), Haq influenced the Bank&#x27;s development philosophy and lending policies, steering more attention towards poverty alleviation programmes and increased allocations for small farm production, nutrition, education, water supply and other social sectors. He wrote a study that served as a precursor to the basic needs and human development approaches of the 1980s.

While working at the World Bank, Haq was invited by Prime Minister Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto to join the Ministry of Finance, but ultimately refused as he had strong opposing views on Bhutto&#x27;s program of nationalization. In 1973 Bhutto again asked Mahbub to return to Pakistan and join his administration in devising a strategy that would lift a large number of Pakistanis out of poverty and stagflation, but their major differences persuaded Haq not to return.

In 1982 Haq returned at the request of General Zia-ul-Haq&#x27;s military government, where he assumed directorship of the Planning Commission. In 1983 Haq was appointed Minister of Planning and Development. According to Parvez Hasan &#x27;under Mahbub&#x27;s direction, the Planning Commission became once again a lively place and began to exert powerful influence on social sector issues, including education and family planning, much neglected in earlier Zia years.

In 1985 President Zia oversaw a partial return to democracy with so-called &#x27;non-party&#x27; general elections, and Haq was sworn in as Minister of Finance, Planning and Economic Affairs in the PML government of Mohammed Khan Junejo. Haq&#x27;s is credited with significant tax reforms, deregulation of the economy, increased emphasis on human development and several initiatives for poverty alleviation. Despite this major acceleration in social spending, Haq was forced to resign in January 1986 due to protests regarding his reforms. He was reappointed as Finance Minister in the caretaker administration established by General Zia-ul-Haq after he dismissed the Junejo government in May 1988. Haq&#x27;s term ended when the PPP government of Benazir Bhutto was sworn in following the general elections of November 1988.

In 1989, he was appointed as Special Advisor to the UNDP Administrator William Draper in New York City to produce the first Human Development Report. In this capacity, Haq initiated the concept of Human Development and the Human Development Report as its Project Director. He led a team of international scholars including Amartya Sen, Paul Streeten, Inge Kaul, Frances Stewart, and Richard Jolly to prepare annual Human Development Reports.

In 1996, Haq founded the Human Development Center in Islamabad, Pakistan — a policy research institute committed to organizing professional research, policy studies and seminars in the area of human development, with a special focus on South Asia. In acknowledgement of his contributions, the Human Development Centre, Islamabad was officially renamed following his death as the Mahbub ul Haq Human Development Centre on 13 December 1998, with Mrs. Khadija Haq as president.

==Death==
Haq died on 16 July 1998 in New York City at the age of 64, leaving behind his wife Khadija Haq, son Farhan and daughter Toneema.

== Posthumous recognition ==

<text>Omar Jesús Daal Cordero (born March 1, 1972) is a Venezuelan former professional baseball pitcher, who played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for 11 seasons (–). He played for the Los Angeles Dodgers, Montreal Expos, Toronto Blue Jays, Arizona Diamondbacks, Philadelphia Phillies, and Baltimore Orioles.

Daal threw a deceptive fastball that rarely exceeded 85 MPH, a good changeup, and a decent curveball. When he had both control and command of his pitches, he could be difficult to hit.

Daal was somewhat of a two-career pitcher who began as a reliever for the Dodgers, Expos, and Blue Jays, between 1993 and 1997, then became a starter with the Diamondbacks in 1998. He had perhaps his finest year in 1999, setting career highs with 16 wins and 148 strikeouts in innings.

Daal amassed 228 appearances as a relief pitcher but only recorded one save. It occurred on April 13, 1997. The Expos defeated the Rockies 8-3 and Daal pitched the final 2 2/3 innings to pick up the save. He allowed 2 hits and 0 earned runs to save the game for starting pitcher Carlos Perez. 

In 2000, Daal led the big leagues in losses with 19.

On August 15, 2001, Daal combined with fellow Venezuelan pitchers Giovanni Carrara, Kelvim Escobar, and Freddy García for wins in their respective starts: Daal, in a Phillies victory over the Brewers, 8–6; Carrara, of the Dodgers, beating Montreal, 13–1; Escobar, of the Blue Jays, over Oakland, 5–2, and García, of Seattle, against the Red Sox, 6–2. This marked the first time in MLB history that four Venezuelan starting pitchers recorded a win on the same day.

Prior to the 2003 season, Daal signed a two-year contract with Baltimore; however, after undergoing arthroscopic surgery on his left shoulder in early 2004, he was out for that entire season — and would never appear in a major league game, again.

Daal&#x27;s career stat line includes a win–loss record of 68–78, with 806 strikeouts, and a 4.55 earned run average (ERA), in 1,198 innings pitched.

Daal currently coaches two club baseball teams a 12u team and a 13u team, called the East Valley Scrapper&#x27;s in Mesa, Arizona.

<text>A censure is an expression of strong disapproval or harsh criticism. In parliamentary procedure, it is a debatable main motion that could be adopted by a majority vote. Among the forms that it can take are a stern rebuke by a legislature, a spiritual penalty imposed by a church, or a negative judgment pronounced on a theological proposition. It is usually non-binding (requiring no compulsory action from the censured party), unlike a motion of no confidence (which may require the referenced party to resign).

== Parliamentary procedure ==

===Explanation and use===
The motion to censure is a main motion expressing a strong opinion of disapproval that could be debated by the assembly and adopted by a majority vote. According to &quot;Robert&#x27;s Rules of Order&quot; (&quot;Newly Revised&quot;) (RONR), it is an exception to the general rule that &quot;a motion must not use language that reflects on a member&#x27;s conduct or character, or is discourteous, unnecessarily harsh, or not allowed in debate.&quot; &quot;Demeter&#x27;s Manual&quot; notes, &quot;It is a reprimand, aimed at reformation of the person and prevention of further offending acts.&quot; While there are many possible grounds for censuring members of an organization, such as embezzlement, absenteeism, drunkenness, and so on, the grounds for censuring a presiding officer are more limited:

More serious disciplinary procedures may involve fine, suspension, or expulsion. In some cases, the assembly may declare the chair vacant and elect a new chairman for the meeting; or a motion can be made to permanently remove an officer (depending on the rules of the assembly).

===Procedure===
If the motion is made to censure the presiding officer, then he must relinquish the chair to the vice-president until the motion is disposed. But during this time, the vice-president is still referred to as &quot;Mr. Vice President&quot; or &quot;Ms. Vice President&quot; in debate, since a censure is merely a warning and not a proceeding that removes the president from the chair. An officer being censured is not referred to by name in the motion, but simply as &quot;the president&quot;, &quot;the treasurer&quot;, etc.

After a motion to censure is passed, the chair (or the vice-president, if the presiding officer is being censured) addresses the censured member by name. He may say something to the effect of, &quot;Brother F, you have been censured by vote of the assembly. A censure indicates the assembly&#x27;s disapproval of your conduct&quot;. ([at meetings.] This phrase should not be included as the cause for censure may have occurred outside of meetings.) &quot;A censure is a warning. It is the warning voice of suspension or expulsion. Please take due notice thereof and govern yourself accordingly.&quot; Or, if the chair is being censured, the vice-president may say, &quot;Mr. &quot;X&quot;, you have been censured by the assembly for the reasons contained in the resolution. I now return to you the presidency.&quot;

==Politics==
In politics, a censure is an alternative to more serious measures against misconduct or dereliction of duty.

===Canada===

Censure is an action by the House of Commons or the Senate rebuking the actions or conduct of an individual. The power to censure is not directly mentioned in the constitutional texts of Canada but is derived from the powers bestowed upon both Chambers through section 18 of the Constitution Act, 1867. A motion of censure can be introduced by any Member of Parliament or Senator and passed by a simple majority for censure to be deemed to have been delivered. In addition, if the censure is related to the privileges of the Chamber, the individual in question could be summoned to the bar of the House or Senate (or, in the case of a sitting member, to that member&#x27;s place in the chamber) to be censured, and could also face other sanctions from the house, including imprisonment. Normally, censure is exclusively an on-the-record rebuke — it is &quot;not&quot; equivalent to a motion of no confidence, and a prime minister can continue in office even if censured.

Louis Riel faced Parliamentary censure for his role in the Red River Rebellion, and was expelled from Parliament 16 April 1874.

===Japan===
In Japan, a censure motion is a motion that can be passed by the House of Councillors, the upper house of the National Diet. No-confidence motions are passed in the House of Representatives, and this generally does not happen as this house is controlled by the ruling party. On the other hand, censure motions have been passed by opposition parties several times during the Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) administrations from 2009. The motions were combined with a demand from the opposition to take a certain action, and a refusal to cooperate with the ruling party on key issues unless some actions were taken.

For example, on 20 April 2012 the opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), Your Party and New Renaissance Party submitted censure motions against ministers of Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda&#x27;s Democratic Party of Japan-controlled cabinet. They censured Minister of Defense Naoki Tanaka and Minister of Land Takeshi Maeda, and refused to cooperate with the government on passing an increase to Japan&#x27;s consumption tax from 5% to 10%. Noda had &quot;staked his political life&quot; on passing the consumption tax increase, so on 4 June 2012, Noda reshuffled his cabinet and replaced Tanaka and Maeda.

On 28 August 2012, a censure motion was passed by the LDP and the New Komeito Party against Prime Minister Noda himself. The opposition parties were to boycott debate in the chamber, it means that bills passed in the DPJ-controlled House of Representatives cannot be enacted.

===Australia===
The Senate, the upper house of the Australian Parliament, has censured two Prime Ministers in recent decades that of Paul Keating and John Howard.

The Australian Attorney General George Brandis was censured on 2 March 2015 for his treatment of Human Rights Commission President Gillian Triggs.

Senator for Queensland Fraser Anning was censured for remarks he made about the Christchurch mosque shootings.

Former Prime Minister Scott Morrison was censured by the Australian House of Representatives on 30 November 2022 for secretly taking on the powers of additional ministries.

Former Australian Greens Senator Lidia Thorpe was threatened to face a censure motion in early 2023 over her undisclosed relationship with a bikie boss. The motion was backed by the Coalition and One Nation, with the Labor Party considering backing the motion. She was subsequently censured on 18 November 2024 for heckling the King of Australia, King Charles III.

Australian Greens Senator Janet Rice was censured by the Australian Senate over protesting during a special address to the Australian Parliament by Philippine President Bongbong Marcos.

===United Kingdom===
In the UK the Crown cannot be prosecuted for breaches of the law even where it has no exemption, such as from the Health and Safety at Work etc. Act. A Crown Censure is the method by which the Health and Safety Executive records, but for Crown immunity, there would be sufficient evidence to secure a H&amp;S conviction against the Crown.

===United States===

Censure is the public reprimanding of a public official or political party representative for inappropriate conduct or voting behavior. When the president is censured, it serves only as a condemnation and has no direct effect on the validity of presidency, nor are there any other particular legal consequences. Unlike impeachment, censure has no basis in the Constitution or in the rules of the Senate and House of Representatives. It expresses the formal condemnation of either congressional body, or of a political party, of one of their own members.

==Catholic Church==
===Canon law===

In Catholic canon law, a censure is a penalty imposed primarily for the purpose of breaking contumacy and reintegrating the offender in the community.

The ecclesiastical censures are excommunication and interdict, which can be imposed on any member of the Church, and suspension, which only affects clerics.

===Theological censure===

In Catholic theology, a theological censure is a doctrinal judgment by which the church stigmatizes certain teachings detrimental to faith or morals.

<doc id="698878" wikidata="Q4870705" url="?curid=698878" title="Battle of Chambois">
<text>The Battle of Chambois was an August 1944 battle during the Battle of Normandy in World War II. Prior to the battle, a pocket had formed around Falaise, Calvados, where the German Army Group B, with the 7th Army and the Fifth Panzer Army (formerly ) were encircled by the Western Allies. The seizure of Chambois by American, Canadian and Polish forces saw the final closure of the Falaise Pocket on August 21, 1944, and the destruction of most of Army Group B.

==Background==

Following the success of Operation Totalize south of Caen on August 8 and 9, General Harry Crerar, commander of the First Canadian Army, pushed south. Operation Tractable was launched to break through the German lines and capture the tactically important towns of Falaise and then the smaller towns of Trun and Chambois and to encircle large German formations. 

On August 18, 1944, Canadian forces captured Trun, while General Stanisław Maczek&#x27;s Polish 1st Armoured Division headed towards Chambois to encircle 110,000 Germans in the Falaise pocket. Small corridors east of Chambois allowed small numbers of Germans to escape the pocket and head towards the river Seine.

At the same time, to the south of Chambois, the American 90th Infantry Division pushed north to close the pocket at Chambois. On the morning of August 19 Saint-Lambert-sur-Dives was taken by Canadian forces, and at midday Polish forces attacked towards Chambois and against German positions on what was known as Hill 262, located north-east of Chambois. Polish forces then attacked the outskirts of Chambois. Chambois had been heavily shelled and was in ruins with German soldiers from various battered units flowing into the area.

To the east of Chambois Polish and American forces linked up to finally close the Falaise pocket. The Allies continued to attack retreating elements of the German 5th and 7th armies and the 116th Panzer Division. A German counter-attack organised by General Paul Hausser on August 20 failed to break Polish lines but did allow further German troops to escape the pocket. German troops and vehicles were trapped on the congested narrow roads and were easy prey for Allied artillery and air attacks. Late on August 20, Chambois finally fell to Polish forces and the Falaise pocket was sealed on August 21 with approximately 50,000 Germans trapped inside.

==Aftermath==
The battle resulted in the destruction of most of Army Group B west of the Seine, which opened the way to Paris and the Franco-German border for the Allied armies on the Western Front. Remnants of German units retreated east towards the Seine but left much of their heavy armour and artillery behind. General Hausser was wounded in the jaw during the battle but escaped the encirclement.

<text>Raúl Alexander Chávez (born March 18, 1973) is a Venezuelan former professional baseball catcher. He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) from 1996 to 2009 for the Montreal Expos, Seattle Mariners, Houston Astros, Baltimore Orioles, Pittsburgh Pirates, and Toronto Blue Jays. He bats and throws right-handed.

==Career==
Chávez played for the Montreal Expos (1996–1997), Seattle Mariners (1998), Houston Astros (2000, 2002–2005), Baltimore Orioles (2006), Pittsburgh Pirates (2008), and Toronto Blue Jays (2009). He also played in the New York Yankees minor league system in 2007.

=== Pittsburgh Pirates ===
In 2008, he played for the Pittsburgh Pirates. He declined a minor league assignment on December 10, 2008, becoming a free agent.

=== Toronto Blue Jays ===
On December 22, he signed a minor league contract with an invitation to spring training with the Toronto Blue Jays. He did not make the 25-man Jays&#x27; roster out of spring training, and was assigned to Triple A Las Vegas 51s. But an injury to Michael Barrett on April 17 sent Barrett to the disabled list, and Chavez was called up to the Blue Jays the next day to fill the roster spot. He made his 2009 debut catching Ricky Romero at Rogers Centre in Toronto on April 19, in a 1–0 win over the Oakland Athletics.

Chávez is known for his defense, specifically his exceptional arm, and is considered to call a solid game. On June 6, 2009, Chavez hit his first home run for the Toronto Blue Jays, giving them a 2–0 lead over the Kansas City Royals. On December 11, 2009, the Blue Jays declined to tender Chavez a contract, however two days later they signed him to a minor league contract with an invitation to spring training.

===New York Mets===
On January 14, 2011, the New York Mets signed Chávez to a minor league deal with an invitation to spring training. He spent the season with the Buffalo Bisons before retiring.

<text>The Atlanta Thrashers were an ice hockey team based in Atlanta, Georgia, United States. They were members of the Southeast Division of the Eastern Conference in the National Hockey League (NHL). The Thrashers joined the NHL in 1999 as an expansion franchise, and over 200 players have worn a Thrashers uniform since that time. The Thrashers won the Southeast Division and reached the playoffs for the first time in team history in 2006–07.

Ilya Kovalchuk is the franchise leader in goals scored (328), assists (287), points (615) and games (594). Early in 2009, Kovalchuk was named the seventh captain in franchise history. Kari Lehtonen leads the franchise in most goaltending categories, including games played (204), wins (94) and shutouts (14). At the end of the 2010–11 season the team was purchased by True North Sports &amp; Entertainment and moved to Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada for the start of the 2011–12 season and became the Winnipeg Jets.

<doc id="698897" wikidata="Q291690" url="?curid=698897" title="Nancy Hollister">
<text>Nancy Elizabeth Hollister (née Putnam; born May 22, 1949) is an American politician from the U.S. state of Ohio. Hollister was the first and, to date, only female governor of Ohio, serving briefly from December 1998 to January 1999. 

Hollister attended Kent State University, and upon leaving college she became a housewife. She began her political career in the 1980s, becoming a member of the city council in Marietta and eventually winning the position of mayor. In 1994, George Voinovich picked her as his candidate for Lieutenant Governor, and she served from 1995 to 1998. After a failed congressional bid in 1998, she succeeded Voinovich as Governor after he resigned to become a U.S. Senator. She served as Governor for 11 days, taking few political actions during her brief tenure. 

Almost immediately after leaving the governorship, Hollister was appointed to a seat in the Ohio House of Representatives. She won election to a full term in 2000 and 2002. In 2004, Hollister was defeated for re-election, attributed in part to her opposition to a constitutional amendment outlawing gay marriage.

==Early life==
Nancy Putnam was born in Terre Haute, Indiana, the daughter of Benjamin Hay Putnam Jr. (1925-2007) and Mary Elizabeth White (1926-1990). Her parents had married in 1945 in West Virginia and had moved briefly back to Terre Haute (her mother&#x27;s hometown) before moving to Marietta, Ohio, where her father&#x27;s family resided. Her 6th great-grandfather was Revolutionary War General Israel Putnam. Her 8th great-grandmother was Bathsheba Folger Pope, an accuser of witches during the Salem Witch Trials. She has five siblings: Emily, Esther, Sarah and Benjamin Hay Putnam, III.

Hollister attended Kent State University majoring in communications. She was active in protests on campus, including protesting curfews placed on women students, a policy which would later be abolished. Hollister left to marry her husband Jeff, just two months before the Kent State shootings.

==Political career (1980–1994)==
Nancy Hollister first entered public office when she was elected to the Marietta City Council in 1980.
Hollister would serve on city council until being elected Mayor of Marietta in 1984. As Mayor, Hollister worked to attract new businesses to the area, promote tourism, and secured funding for a new bridge across the Ohio River.

Since Hollister was a mayor in Southeastern Ohio, Governor George Voinovich appointed Nancy Hollister as director of the Governor&#x27;s Office of Appalachia. In this position, Hollister was responsible for coordinating federal and state efforts to improve life for the twenty-nine counties in Appalachia.

==Lieutenant governor==
In 1994, Hollister was selected by Voinovich as his running mate to replace incumbent lieutenant governor Mike DeWine, who was running for the U.S. Senate. Her selection was thought to be beneficial for Voinovich, who had lost many counties downstate in 1990, and helpful for attracting women to the ticket. Her election in November made her the and the first woman to be elected Lieutenant Governor. Hollister would oversee several State and Local Government Commissions. These included the Governor&#x27;s Office of Appalachia, the Governor&#x27;s Workforce Development Board, the Ohio Department of Agriculture, the Ohio Bureau of Employment Services, the Ohio School-to-Work Initiative, the Office of Housing and Community Partnership, the Ohio Coal Development Office, and the Ohio Farmland Preservation Task Force. In 1998, she was inducted into the Ohio Women&#x27;s Hall of Fame.

=== 1998 bid for Congress ===
In 1996, Hollister began raising funds for a bid for Ohio Secretary of State in 1998. A bid to succeed Voinovich as governor was seen as complicated by Voinovich&#x27;s implicit endorsement of Bob Taft for governor. In 1997, she began reconsidering and considered a bid for the 6th congressional district against incumbent Democrat Ted Strickland. On July 1, 1997, Hollister announced her intent to run for congress. In the primary, Hollister defeated former congressman Frank Cremeans by 4 points. She faced difficulty due to her moderate stances, but won out due to a divided conservative vote. The race was viewed as highly competitive, in part due to the fact that the district had ousted an incumbent every year since 1990. A big issue in the race was education, as the district contained some of the least affluent school districts in the state. Strickland supported more government funding in schools and hiring more teachers, whereas Hollister supported reducing the size of the Department of Education to give funds through block grants. Hollister received the endorsements of George Voinovich and John Boehner, and campaigned alongside House Speaker Newt Gingrich and Bob Dole. On November 3, 1998, Hollister was defeated by Strickland 57% to 43%.

==Governor of Ohio==
On the same day Hollister was defeated in her bid for the 6th congressional district seat, Governor George Voinovich was elected to the United States Senate, and Bob Taft was elected to the governorship.

Voinovich resigned as governor on December 31, 1998 (so he could be sworn into the Senate three days later), and with that, Hollister became governor. Hollister became Ohio&#x27;s first and to date only female governor. She only served 11 days in office - which would also make her Ohio&#x27;s shortest-serving governor - as she was essentially finishing out Voinovich&#x27;s term. During her transitory time in office, she signed a piece of legislation allowing farmers to sell land to local governments to ensure the land would remain farmland, and that local governments would pay the farmers dependent on land value. She was succeeded by Taft, whose term officially began on January 11, 1999.

==Politics (2000–present)==
Upon leaving the Governor&#x27;s office, Hollister was appointed to the Ohio House of Representatives for the 96th district, replacing outgoing Rep. Tom Johnson, who took a job with Governor Taft. She ran for and was elected to the seat in 2000 and 2002, when she ran in the redrawn 93rd district. During her tenure, Hollister introduced a bill allowing nurses to prescribe prescription drugs. The bill went into effect in 2002.

In her final run for office to date, Hollister was defeated by Jennifer Garrison in 2004. A key issue in the campaign was Hollister&#x27;s opposition to a constitutional amendment to ban same-sex marriage. Garrison – the Democrat – ran to the ideological right of Hollister on the state&#x27;s same-sex marriage ban.

She served on the board of trustees of the Ohio History Connection between 2011 and 2016.

In May 2016, she was appointed by Gov. John Kasich to fill a vacancy on the state Board of Education.

As of October 2020 she is an ad-hoc board member of the Friends of the Museums, which manages the Campus Martius Museum and Ohio River Museum in Marietta.

==Personal life==
She married Jeffrey Lynn Hollister, her boyfriend since high school, on March 21, 1970. They have five children: Jonathan Dunham Hollister (b. 1970), Jeremy Douglas Hollister (b. 1973), Justin Harrington Hollister (b. 1976), Emily Elizabeth Hollister (b. 1979) and Sarah Katherine Hollister (b. 1982).

<text>The land of Sin () or Sinim (from: , i.e. the inhabitants of the land of Sin, or the people of Sin) is a biblical hapax legomenon that appears in Isaiah 49:12: &quot;Behold, these shall come from far: and, lo, these from the north and from the west; and these from the land of Sinim.&quot;

Some English versions simply transliterate the word, others translate the Hebrew as Syene (Aswan), and still others associate Sin with China. Sinim resembles &quot;Sinae&quot;, the Latinization of &quot;Qin&quot;, after the Qin state, founded in 778 BC, and the Qin dynasty, founded in 221 BC by Qin Shi Huang-Di. The Greek Septuagint instead says, &quot;from the land of the Persians.&quot;

Young&#x27;s Analytical Concordance to the Bible (1879) defines the word as &quot;a people in the far east; the Chinese?&quot; The International Standard Bible Encyclopedia (1915) says, &quot;The land is clearly far off, and it must be sought either in the South or in the East. Many scholars have favored identification with China, the classical Sinae. It seems improbable that Jews had already found their way to China; but from very early times trade relations were established with the Far East by way of Arabia and the Persian Gulf; and the name may have been used by the prophet simply as suggesting extreme remoteness...While no certain decision is possible, probability points to the East, and China cannot be quite ruled out.&quot; Modern translations of the Bible tend to translate Sinim as Syene (ancient Aswan) because the Great Isaiah Scroll of the Dead Sea Scrolls uses that word.

In modern Hebrew, &quot;Sin&quot; () is the word for China, just as modern Hebrew uses other ambiguous biblical place names for contemporary countries, such as &quot;Sfarad&quot; () for Spain and &quot;Tzarfat&quot; () for France.

==In Mormonism==
In language nearly identical to that of the King James Version, First Nephi 21:12 in the Book of Mormon reads: “And then, O house of Israel, behold, these shall come from far; and lo, these from the north and from the west; and these from the land of Sinim.” The index of this scripture of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints defines Sinim as “possibly [the] land of China”.

<doc id="698908" wikidata="Q1137385" url="?curid=698908" title="Tube Alloys">
<text>Tube Alloys was the research and development programme authorised by the United Kingdom, with participation from Canada, to develop nuclear weapons during the Second World War. Starting before the Manhattan Project in the United States, the British efforts were kept classified, and as such had to be referred to by code even within the highest circles of government.

The possibility of nuclear weapons was acknowledged early in the war. At the University of Birmingham, Rudolf Peierls and Otto Robert Frisch co-wrote a memorandum explaining that a small mass of pure uranium-235 could be used to produce a chain reaction in a bomb with the power of thousands of tons of TNT. This led to the formation of the MAUD Committee, which called for an all-out effort to develop nuclear weapons. Wallace Akers, who oversaw the project, chose the deliberately misleading code name &quot;Tube Alloys&quot;. His Tube Alloys Directorate was part of the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research.

The Tube Alloys programme in Britain and Canada was the first nuclear weapons project. Due to the high costs for Britain while fighting a war within bombing range of its enemies, Tube Alloys was ultimately subsumed into the Manhattan Project by the Quebec Agreement with the United States. Under the agreement, the two nations would share nuclear weapons technology, and refrain from using it against each other, or against other countries without mutual consent. However, the United States did not provide complete details of the results of the Manhattan Project to the United Kingdom. The Soviet Union gained valuable information through its atomic spies, who had infiltrated both the British and American projects.

The United States terminated co-operation after the war ended, under the Atomic Energy Act of 1946. That prompted the United Kingdom to relaunch its own project, High Explosive Research. Production facilities were established and British scientists continued their work under the auspices of an independent British programme. In 1952, Britain performed a nuclear test under the codename &quot;Operation Hurricane&quot; and became the third nuclear-weapon state. In 1958, in the wake of the Sputnik crisis, and the British demonstration of a two-stage thermonuclear bomb, the United Kingdom and the United States signed the US–UK Mutual Defence Agreement, which resulted in a resumption of Britain&#x27;s nuclear Special Relationship with the United States.

== Background ==

=== Discovery of fission ===

The neutron was discovered by James Chadwick at the Cavendish Laboratory at the University of Cambridge in February 1932. In April 1932, his Cavendish colleagues John Cockcroft and Ernest Walton split lithium atoms with accelerated protons. Enrico Fermi and his team in Rome conducted experiments involving the bombardment of elements by slow neutrons, which produced heavier elements and isotopes. Then, in December 1938, Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann at Hahn&#x27;s laboratory in Berlin-Dahlem bombarded uranium with slowed neutrons, and discovered that barium had been produced, and therefore that the uranium atomic nucleus had been split. Hahn wrote to his colleague Lise Meitner, who, with her nephew Otto Robert Frisch, developed a theoretical justification which they published in &quot;Nature&quot; in 1939. The phenomenon was a new type of nuclear disintegration, and was more powerful than any seen before. Frisch and Meitner calculated that the energy released by each disintegration was approximately 200,000,000 electron volts. By analogy with the division of biological cells, they named the process &quot;fission&quot;.

=== Paris Group ===

That was followed up by a group of scientists at the Collège de France in Paris: Frédéric Joliot-Curie, Hans von Halban, Lew Kowarski, and Francis Perrin. In February 1939, the Paris Group showed that when fission occurs in uranium, two or three extra neutrons are given off. That important observation suggested a self-sustaining nuclear chain reaction might be possible. The term &quot;atomic bomb&quot; was already familiar to the British public through the writings of H. G. Wells, in his 1913 novel &quot;The World Set Free&quot;. It was immediately apparent to many scientists that, in theory at least, an extremely powerful explosive could be created, although most still considered an atomic bomb was an impossibility. Perrin defined a critical mass of uranium to be the smallest amount that could sustain a chain reaction. The neutrons used to cause fission in uranium are considered slow neutrons, but when neutrons are released during a fission reaction they are released as fast neutrons which have much more speed and energy. Thus, in order to create a sustained chain reaction, there existed a need for a neutron moderator to contain and slow the fast neutrons until they reached a usable energy level. The Collège de France found that both water and graphite could be used as acceptable moderators.

Early in 1940, the Paris Group decided on theoretical grounds that heavy water would be an ideal moderator. They asked the French Minister of Armaments to obtain as much heavy water as possible from the only source, the large Norsk Hydro hydroelectric station at Vemork in Norway. The French discovered that Germany had already offered to purchase the entire stock of Norwegian heavy water, indicating that Germany might also be researching an atomic bomb. The French told the Norwegian government of the possible military significance of heavy water. Norway gave the entire stock of to a &quot;Deuxième Bureau&quot; agent, who secretly brought it to France just before Germany invaded Norway in April 1940. On 19 June 1940, following the German invasion of France, it was shipped to England by the Earl of Suffolk and Major Ardale Vautier Golding aboard the steamer . The heavy water, valued at £22,000, was initially kept at HM Prison Wormwood Scrubs, and was later secretly stored in the library at Windsor Castle. The Paris Group moved to Cambridge, with the exception of Joliot-Curie, who remained in France and became active in the French Resistance.

=== Frisch–Peierls memorandum ===

In Britain, a number of scientists considered whether an atomic bomb was practical. At the University of Liverpool, Chadwick and the Polish refugee scientist Joseph Rotblat tackled the problem, but their calculations were inconclusive. At Cambridge, Nobel Prize in Physics laureates George Paget Thomson and William Lawrence Bragg wanted the government to take urgent action to acquire uranium ore. The main source of this was the Belgian Congo, and they were worried that it could fall into German hands. Unsure as to how to go about this, they spoke to Sir William Spens, the master of Corpus Christi College, Cambridge. In April 1939, he approached Sir Kenneth Pickthorn, the local Member of Parliament, who took their concerns to the Secretary of the Committee for Imperial Defence, Major General Hastings Ismay. Ismay in turn asked Sir Henry Tizard for an opinion. Like many scientists, Tizard was sceptical of the likelihood of an atomic bomb being developed, reckoning the odds of success at 100,000 to 1.

Even at such long odds, the danger was sufficiently great to be taken seriously. Lord Chartfield, Minister for Coordination of Defence, checked with the Treasury and Foreign Office, and found that the Belgian Congo uranium was owned by the &quot;Union Minière du Haut Katanga&quot; company, whose British vice president, Lord Stonehaven, arranged a meeting with the president of the company, Edgar Sengier. Since &quot;Union Minière&quot; management were friendly towards Britain, it was not considered worthwhile to acquire the uranium immediately, but Tizard&#x27;s Committee on the Scientific Survey of Air Defence was directed to continue the research into the feasibility of atomic bombs. Thomson, at Imperial College London, and Mark Oliphant, an Australian physicist at the University of Birmingham, were each tasked with carrying out a series of experiments on uranium. By February 1940, Thomson&#x27;s team had failed to create a chain reaction in natural uranium, and he had decided it was not worth pursuing.
At Birmingham, Oliphant&#x27;s team had reached a different conclusion. Oliphant had delegated the task to two German refugee scientists, Rudolf Peierls and Otto Frisch, who could not work on Oliphant&#x27;s radar project because they were enemy aliens and therefore lacked the necessary security clearance. Francis Perrin had calculated the critical mass of uranium to be about . He reckoned that if a neutron reflector were placed around it, this might be reduced to . Peierls attempted to simplify the problem by using the fast neutrons produced by fission, thus omitting consideration of moderator. He too calculated the critical mass of a sphere of uranium in a theoretical paper written in 1939 to be &quot;of the order of tons&quot;.

Peierls knew the importance of the size of the critical mass that would allow a chain reaction to take place and its practical significance. In the interior of a critical mass sphere, neutrons are spontaneously produced by the fissionable material. A very small portion of these neutrons are colliding with other nuclei, while a larger portion of the neutrons are escaping through the surface of the sphere. Peierls calculated the equilibrium of the system, where the number of neutrons being produced equalled the number escaping.

Niels Bohr had theorised that the rare uranium-235 isotope, which makes up only about 0.7% of natural uranium, was primarily responsible for fission with fast neutrons, although this was not yet universally accepted. Frisch and Peierls were thus able to revise their initial estimate of critical mass needed for nuclear fission in uranium to be substantially less than previously assumed. They estimated a metallic sphere of uranium-235 with a radius of could suffice. This amount represented approximately of uranium-235. These results led to the Frisch–Peierls memorandum, which was the initial step in the development of the nuclear arms programme in Britain. This marked the beginning of an aggressive approach towards uranium enrichment and the development of an atomic bomb. They now began to investigate processes by which they could successfully separate the uranium isotope.

Oliphant took their findings to Tizard in his capacity as the chairman of the Committee for the Scientific Survey of Air Warfare (CSSAW). He in turn passed them to Thomson, to whom the CSSAW had delegated responsibility for uranium research. After discussions between Cockcroft, Oliphant and Thomson, CSSAW created the MAUD Committee to investigate further.

=== MAUD Committee ===

The MAUD Committee was founded in June 1940. The committee was originally a part of the Committee for the Scientific Survey of Air Defence, but later gained independence with the Ministry of Aircraft Production. The committee was initially named after its chairman, Thomson, but quickly exchanged this for a more unassuming name, the MAUD Committee. The name MAUD came to be in an unusual way. Shortly after Germany invaded Denmark, Bohr had sent a telegram to Frisch. The telegram ended with a strange line: &quot;Tell Cockcroft and Maud Ray Kent&quot;. At first it was thought to be code regarding radium or other vital atomic-weapons-related information, hidden in an anagram. One suggestion was to replace the y with an i, producing &quot;radium taken&quot;. When Bohr returned to England in 1943, it was discovered that the message was addressed to Bohr&#x27;s housekeeper Maud Ray and Cockcroft. Maud Ray was from Kent. Thus the committee was named The MAUD Committee, the capitalisation representing a codename and not an acronym. Meetings were normally held in the offices of the Royal Society in London. In addition to Thomson, its original members were Chadwick, Cockcroft, Oliphant and Philip Moon, Patrick Blackett, Charles Ellis and Norman Haworth. 
Four universities provided the locations where the experiments were taking place. The laboratory at the University of Birmingham was responsible for all the theoretical work, such as what size of critical mass was needed for an explosion. It was run by Peierls, with the help of fellow German refugee scientist Klaus Fuchs. The laboratories at the University of Liverpool and the University of Oxford experimented with different types of isotope separation. Chadwick&#x27;s group at Liverpool dealt with thermal diffusion, which worked based on the principle that different isotopes of uranium diffuse at different speeds because of the equipartition theorem. Franz Simon&#x27;s group at Oxford investigated the gaseous diffusion of isotopes. This method works on the principle that at differing pressures uranium 235 would diffuse through a barrier faster than uranium 238. Eventually, the most promising method of separation was found to be gaseous diffusion. Egon Bretscher and Norman Feather&#x27;s group at Cambridge investigated whether another element, now called plutonium, could be used as an explosive compound. Because of the French scientists, Oxford also obtained the world&#x27;s only supply of heavy water, which helped them theorise how uranium could be used for power.

The research from the MAUD committee was compiled in two reports, commonly known as the MAUD reports in July 1941. The first report, &quot;Use of Uranium for a Bomb&quot;, discussed the feasibility of creating a super-bomb from uranium, which they now thought to be possible. The second, &quot;Use of Uranium as a Source of Power&quot; discussed the idea of using uranium as a source of power, not just a bomb. The MAUD Committee and report helped bring about the British nuclear programme, the Tube Alloys Project. Not only did it help start a nuclear project in Britain, it helped jump-start the American project. Without the help of the MAUD Committee the American programme, the Manhattan Project, would have started months behind. Instead they were able to begin thinking about how to create a bomb, not whether it was possible. Historian Margaret Gowing noted that &quot;events that change a time scale by only a few months can nevertheless change history.&quot;

The MAUD reports were reviewed by the Defence Services Panel of the Scientific Advisory Committee. This was chaired by Lord Hankey, with its other members being Sir Edward Appleton, Sir Henry Dale, Alfred Egerton, Archibald Hill and Edward Mellanby. The panel held seven meetings in September 1941, and submitted its report to the Lord President of the Council, Sir John Anderson. At this point, it was feared that German scientists were attempting to provide their country with an atomic bomb, and thus Britain needed to finish theirs first. The report ultimately stated that if there were even a sliver of a chance that the bomb effort could produce a weapon with such power, then every effort should be made to make sure Britain did not fall behind. It recommended that while a pilot separation plant be built in Britain, the production facility should be built in Canada. The Defence Services Panel submitted its report on 24 September 1941, but by this time the final decision had already been taken. Lord Cherwell had taken the matter to the Prime Minister, Winston Churchill, who became the first national leader to approve a nuclear weapons programme on 30 August 1941. The Chiefs of Staff Committee supported the decision.

== Tube Alloys programme ==

=== Organisation ===

A directorate of Tube Alloys was established as part of Appleton&#x27;s Department of Scientific and Industrial Research, and Wallace Akers, the research director of Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI), was chosen as its head. Anderson and Akers came up with the name Tube Alloys. It was deliberately chosen to be meaningless, &quot;with a specious air of probability about it&quot;. An advisory committee known as the Tube Alloys Consultative Council was created to oversee its work, chaired by Anderson, with its other members being Lord Hankey, Lord Cherwell, Sir Edward Appleton and Sir Henry Dale. This handled policy matters. To deal with technical issues, a Technical Committee was created with Akers as chairman, and Chadwick, Simon, Halban, Peierls, and a senior ICI official, Roland Edgar Slade, as its original members, with Michael Perrin as its secretary. It was later joined by Charles Galton Darwin, Cockcroft, Oliphant and Feather.

=== Isotopic separation ===

The biggest problem faced by the MAUD Committee was to find a way to separate the 0.7% of uranium-235 from the 99.3% of uranium-238. This is difficult because the two types of uranium are chemically identical. Separation (uranium enrichment) would have to be achieved at a large scale. At Cambridge, Eric Rideal and his team investigated using a gas centrifuge. Frisch chose to perform gaseous thermal diffusion using Clusius tubes because it seemed the simplest method. Frisch&#x27;s calculations showed there would need to be 100,000 Clusius tubes to extract the desired separation amount. Peierls turned to Franz Simon, who preferred to find a method more suitable for mass production.
When Moon examined the suggestion that gaseous thermal diffusion be the method of choice to the MAUD committee, there was no agreement to move forward with it. The committee consulted with Peierls and Simon over the separation method and concluded that &quot;ordinary&quot; gaseous diffusion was the best method to pursue. This relies on Graham&#x27;s law, the fact that the gases diffuse through porous materials at rates determined by their molecular weight. Francis William Aston applied this method in 1913 when he separated two isotopes of neon by diffusing a sample thousands of times through a pipe clay. Thick materials like pipe clay proved too slow to be efficient on an industry scale. Simon proposed using a metal foil punctured with millions of microscopic holes would allow the separation process to move faster. He estimated that a plant that separated of uranium-235 from natural uranium per day would cost about £5,000,000 to build, and £1,500,000 per year to run, in which time it would consume £2,000,000 of uranium and other raw materials. The MAUD Committee realised an atomic bomb was not just feasible, but inevitable.

In 1941, Frisch moved to London to work with Chadwick and his cyclotron. Frisch built a Clusius tube there to study the properties of uranium hexafluoride. Frisch and Chadwick discovered it is one of the gases for which the Clusius method will not work. This was only a minor setback because Simon was already in progress of establishing the alternative method of separation through ordinary gaseous diffusion.

The chemical problems of producing gaseous compounds of uranium and pure uranium metal were studied at the University of Birmingham and by ICI. Michael Clapham, who at the time was working on print technology at the Kynoch Works in Aston in Birmingham, carried out early experiments with uranium production processes. Philip Baxter from ICI, where he had experience working with fluorine compounds, made the first small batch of gaseous uranium hexafluoride for Chadwick in 1940. ICI received a formal £5,000 contract in December 1940 to make of this vital material for the future work. The prototype gaseous diffusion equipment itself was manufactured by Metropolitan-Vickers (MetroVick) at Trafford Park, Manchester, at a cost of £150,000 for four units. They were installed at the M. S. Factory located in a valley near Rhydymwyn, in Wales; M. S. stood for the Ministry of Supply. The building used was known as P6 and test equipment was installed. These units were tested by a team of about seventy under the guidance of Peierls and Fuchs. The results of the experiments led to the building of the gaseous diffusion factory at Capenhurst, Cheshire. ICI pilot plants for producing of pure uranium metal and of uranium hexafluoride per day commenced operation in Widnes in mid-1943.

=== Plutonium ===

The breakthrough with plutonium was by Bretscher and Norman Feather at the Cavendish Laboratory. They realised that a slow neutron reactor fuelled with uranium would theoretically produce substantial amounts of plutonium-239 as a by-product. This is because uranium-238 absorbs slow neutrons and forms a short-lived new isotope, uranium-239. The new isotope&#x27;s nucleus rapidly emits an electron through beta decay producing a new element with an atomic mass of 239 and an atomic number of 93. This element&#x27;s nucleus also emits an electron and becomes a new element with an atomic number 94 and a much greater half-life. Bretscher and Feather showed theoretically feasible grounds that element 94 would be fissilereadily split by both slow and fast neutrons with the added advantage of being chemically different from uranium.

This new development was also confirmed in independent work by Edwin M. McMillan and Philip Abelson at Berkeley Radiation Laboratory also in 1940. Nicholas Kemmer of the Cambridge team proposed the names neptunium for the new element 93 and plutonium for 94 by analogy with the outer planets Neptune and Pluto beyond Uranus (uranium being element 92). The Americans fortuitously suggested the same names. The production and identification of the first sample of plutonium in 1941 is generally credited to Glenn Seaborg, using a cyclotron rather than a reactor at the University of California. In 1941, neither team knew of the existence of the other.

Chadwick voiced concerns about the need for such pure plutonium to make a feasible bomb. He also suspected the gun method of detonation for a plutonium bomb would lead to premature detonations due to impurities. After Chadwick met Robert Oppenheimer at the Los Alamos Laboratory in 1943, he learned of a proposed bomb design which they were calling an implosion. The sub-critical mass of plutonium was supposed to be surrounded by explosives arranged to detonate simultaneously. This would cause the plutonium core to be compressed and become supercritical. The core would be surrounded by a depleted uranium tamper which would reflect the neutrons back into the reaction, and contribute to the explosion by fissioning itself. This design solved Chadwick&#x27;s worries about purity because it did not require the level needed for the gun-type fission weapon. The biggest problem with this method was creating the explosive lenses. Chadwick took this information with him and described the method to Oliphant who then took it with him to England.

=== Montreal Laboratory ===


Halban&#x27;s heavy water team from France continued its slow neutron research at Cambridge University; but the project was given a low priority since it was not considered relevant to bomb making. It suddenly acquired military significance when it was realised that it provided the route to plutonium. The British Government wanted the Cambridge team to be relocated to North America, in proximity to the raw materials it required, and where the American research was being done. But Sir John Anderson wanted the British team to retain its own identity, and was concerned that since the Americans were working on nuclear reactor designs using nuclear graphite instead of heavy water as a neutron moderator, that team might not receive a fair share of resources. The Americans had their own concerns, particularly about security, since only one of the six senior scientists in the group was British. They also had concerns about patent rights; that the French team would attempt to patent nuclear technology based on the pre-war work. As a compromise, Thomson suggested relocating the team to Canada.

The Canadian government was approached, and Jack Mackenzie, the president of the National Research Council of Canada, immediately welcomed and supported the proposal. The costs and salaries would be divided between the British and Canadian governments, but the British share would come from a billion dollar war gift from Canada. The first eight staff arrived in Montreal at the end of 1942, and occupied a house belonging to McGill University. Three months later they moved into a area in a new building at the University of Montreal. The laboratory grew quickly to over 300 staff; about half were Canadians recruited by George Laurence. A subgroup of theoreticians was recruited and headed by a Czechoslovak physicist, George Placzek. Placzek proved to be a very capable group leader, and was generally regarded as the only member of the staff with the stature of the highest scientific rank and with close personal contacts with many key physicists involved in the Manhattan project. Friedrich Paneth became head of the chemistry division, and Pierre Auger of the experimental physics division. Von Halban was the director of the laboratory, but he proved to be an unfortunate choice as he was a poor administrator, and did not work well with the National Research Council of Canada. The Americans saw him as a security risk, and objected to the French atomic patents claimed by the Paris Group (in association with ICI).

=== Niels Bohr&#x27;s contribution ===

Sir John Anderson was eager to invite Niels Bohr to the Tube Alloys project because he was a world-famous scientist who would not only contribute his expertise to the project, but also help the British government gain leverage in dealings with the Manhattan Project.
In September 1943, word reached Bohr in Denmark that the Nazis considered his family to be Jewish, and that they were in danger of being arrested. The Danish resistance helped Bohr and his wife escape by sea to Sweden on 29 September 1943. When the news of Bohr&#x27;s escape reached Britain, Lord Cherwell sent a telegram asking Bohr to come to Britain. Bohr arrived in Scotland on 6 October in a de Havilland Mosquito operated by the British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC).

At the invitation of the director of the Manhattan Project, Brigadier General Leslie R. Groves Jr., Bohr visited the Manhattan Project sites in November 1943. Groves offered Bohr substantial pay, but Bohr initially refused the offer because he wanted to make sure the relationship between the United States and Great Britain remained a real co-operative partnership. In December 1943, after a meeting with Albert Einstein, Bohr and his son Aage committed to working on the Manhattan Project. Bohr made a substantial contribution to the atomic bomb development effort. He also attempted to prevent a post-war atomic arms race with the Soviet Union, which he believed to be a serious threat. In 1944, Bohr presented several key points he believed to be essential concerning international nuclear weapon control. He urged that Britain and the United States should inform the Soviet Union about the Manhattan Project in order to decrease the likelihood of its feeling threatened on the premise that the other nations were building a bomb behind its back. His beliefs stemmed from his conviction that the Russians already knew about the Manhattan Project, leading him to believe there was no point in hiding it from them.

Bohr&#x27;s evidence came from an interpretation of a letter he received from a Soviet friend and scientist in Russia, which he showed to the British security services. He reasoned that the longer the United States and Britain hid their nuclear advances, the more threatened the Russians would feel and the more inclined to speed up their effort to produce an atomic bomb of their own. With the help of U.S. Supreme Court justice Felix Frankfurter, Bohr met on 26 August 1944 with the President of the United States, Franklin D. Roosevelt, who was initially sympathetic to his ideas about controlling nuclear weapons. But Churchill was adamantly opposed to informing the Soviet Union of such work. At the Second Quebec Conference in September 1944, Roosevelt sided with Churchill, deciding it would be in the nation&#x27;s best interest to keep the atomic bomb project a secret. Moreover, they decided Bohr was potentially dangerous and that security measures must be taken in order to prevent him from leaking information to the rest of the world, Russia in particular.

== Tube Alloys in the United States ==
=== Tizard mission ===

In August 1940, a British mission, led by Tizard and with members including Cockcroft, was sent to America to create relations and help advance the research towards war technology with the Americans. Several military technologies were shared, including advances in radar, anti-submarine warfare, aeronautical engineering and explosives. The American radar programme in particular was reinvigorated with an added impetus to the development of microwave radar and proximity fuzes. This prompted the Americans to create the MIT Radiation Laboratory, which would later serve as a model for the Los Alamos Laboratory. The mission did not spend much time on nuclear fission, with only two meetings of the subject, mainly about uranium enrichment. In particular, Cockcroft did not report Peierls&#x27; and Frisch&#x27;s findings. Nonetheless, there were important repercussions. A barrier had been broken and a pathway to exchange technical information between the two countries was developed. Moreover, the notion of civilian scientists playing an important role in the development of military technologies was strengthened on both sides of the Atlantic.

=== Oliphant&#x27;s visit to the United States ===

The MAUD Committee reports urged the co-operation with the United States should be continued in the research of nuclear fission. Charles C. Lauritsen, a Caltech physicist working at the National Defense Research Committee (NDRC), was in London during this time and was invited to sit in on a MAUD meeting. The committee pushed for rapid development of nuclear weapons using gaseous-diffusion as their isotope separation device. Once he returned to the United States, he was able to brief Vannevar Bush, the director of the Office of Scientific Research and Development (OSRD), concerning the details discussed during the meeting.

In August 1941, Mark Oliphant, the director of the physics department at the University of Birmingham and an original member of the MAUD Committee, was sent to the US to assist the NDRC on radar. During his visit he met with William D. Coolidge. Coolidge was shocked when Oliphant told him the British had predicted that only ten kilograms of uranium-235 would be sufficient to supply a chain reaction effected by fast moving neutrons. While in America, Oliphant discovered that the chairman of the OSRD S-1 Section, Lyman Briggs, had locked away the MAUD reports transferred from Britain entailing the initial discoveries and had not informed the S-1 Committee members of all its findings.

Oliphant took the initiative himself to enlighten the scientific community in the U.S. of the recent groundbreaking discoveries the MAUD Committee had just exposed. Oliphant also travelled to Berkeley to meet with Ernest Lawrence, inventor of the cyclotron. After Oliphant informed Lawrence of his report on uranium, Lawrence met with NDRC chairman James Bryant Conant, George B. Pegram, and Arthur Compton to relay the details which Oliphant had directed to Lawrence. Oliphant was not only able to get in touch with Lawrence, he met with Conant and Bush to inform them of the significant data the MAUD had discovered. Oliphant&#x27;s ability to inform the Americans led to Oliphant convincing Lawrence, Lawrence convincing Compton, and then George Kistiakowsky convincing Conant to move forward with nuclear weapons. These actions from Oliphant resulted in Bush taking this report directly to the president.

=== Information sharing ceases ===

The American effort increased rapidly and soon outstripped the British as the American authorities were reluctant to share details with their British counterparts. However, separate research continued in each country with some exchange of information. Several of the key British scientists visited the United States early in 1942 and were given full access to all of the information available. They were astounded at the momentum the American atomic bomb project had then assumed. The British and American exchange of information and efforts continued but the nations did not combine their efforts, leading their programmes separately. Furthermore, in 1941 the British Government rebuffed and vetoed attempts and proposals by Bush and Conant to strengthen cooperation between Great Britain and America.

In June 1942, the United States Army Corps of Engineers took over the Manhattan Project from OSRD, and Groves became the project&#x27;s director. He tightened security, which dried up the flow of information to Britain. American officials were particularly concerned that Akers and other people from ICI involved in the Tube Alloys project were trying to exploit American nuclear scientific knowledge to create a profitable post-war industry. In October 1942, Bush and Conant convinced Roosevelt the United States should independently develop the atomic bomb project, despite an agreement of unrestricted scientific interchange between the US and Britain.

This disastrously affected British efforts as they lacked manpower, facilities, equipment and materials. Tube Alloys, therefore, fell behind in the race with the Manhattan Project. On 30 July 1942, Anderson advised Churchill: &quot;We must face the fact that... [our] pioneering work... is a dwindling asset and that, unless we capitalise it quickly, we shall be outstripped. We now have a real contribution to make to a &#x27;merger&#x27;. Soon we shall have little or none.&quot; By the time Britain realised it, the position had worsened; Bush decided outside help for the Manhattan Project was no longer needed. The Military Policy Committee (MPC) supported Bush&#x27;s arguments and restricted access to the classified information which Britain could utilise to develop its atomic weapons programme, even if it slowed down the American efforts.

The Americans stopped sharing any information on heavy water production, the method of electromagnetic separation, the physical or chemical properties of plutonium, the details of bomb design, or the facts about fast neutron reactions. This was a major disappointment that hindered the British and the Canadians, who were collaborating on heavy water production and several other aspects of the research programme. By 1943 Britain had stopped sending its scientists to the United States, which slowed down the pace of work there, which had relied on efforts led by British scientists. In March 1943 Conant approached the Military Policy Committee, which decided that Britain&#x27;s help would benefit some areas of the project. Chadwick, William Penney, Peierls, Oliphant and other British scientists were important enough that the bomb design team at the Los Alamos Laboratory needed them, despite the risk of revealing weapon design secrets.

=== Quebec Agreement ===


Churchill sought information about building Britain&#x27;s own gaseous diffusion plant, a heavy water plant and an atomic reactor in Britain, despite the immense cost. A gaseous diffusion plant to produce a kilogram of weapons-grade uranium per day was estimated to cost up to £3million in research and development, and anything up to £50million to build in wartime Britain. A nuclear reactor to produce that much plutonium per day would have to be built in Canada. It would take up to five years to build and cost £5million. The project would also require facilities for producing the required heavy water (between £5million and £10million) and uranium metal (£1.5million). The project would need overwhelming priority, as it was estimated to require twenty thousand workersmany of them highly skilledhalf a million tons of steel, and an unprecedented half gigawatt of electricity. Disruption to other wartime projects would be inevitable, and it was unlikely to be ready in time to affect the outcome of the war in Europe. The unanimous response was that first another effort should be made to secure American co-operation.

In July 1943, in London, American officials cleared up some major misunderstandings about British motives, and after many months of negotiations the Quebec Agreement was signed by Churchill and Roosevelt on 19 August 1943 during the Quebec Conference. The British handed over their material to the Americans and in return received the copies of the American progress reports to the President. Tube Alloys was subsumed into the Manhattan Project. In a section of the Quebec Agreement formally entitled &quot;Articles of Agreement governing collaboration between the authorities of the US and UK in the matter of Tube Alloys&quot;, Britain and the US agreed to share resources &quot;to bring the Tube Alloys project to fruition at the earliest moment&quot;. The leaders further agreed that:
* &quot;First, we will never use this agency against each other,
* Secondly, we will not use it against third parties without each other&#x27;s consent, and
* Thirdly, we will not either of us communicate any information about Tube Alloys to third parties except by mutual consent.&quot;

It was also agreed that &quot;any post-war advantages of an industrial or commercial nature&quot; would be decided at the discretion of the President. The Quebec Agreement established the Combined Policy Committee to control the Manhattan Project, consisting of Henry Stimson, Bush and Conant from the United States; Field Marshal Sir John Dill and Colonel J. J. Llewellin were the British members, and C. D. Howe was the Canadian member. Llewellin returned to the United Kingdom at the end of 1943 and was replaced on the committee by Sir Ronald Ian Campbell, who in turn was replaced by the British Ambassador to the United States, Lord Halifax, in early 1945. Dill died in Washington, D.C., in November 1944 and was replaced both as Chief of the British Joint Staff Mission and as a member of the Combined Policy Committee by Field Marshal Sir Henry Maitland Wilson. The subsequent Hyde Park Agreement on 19 September 1944 extended this cooperation to the post-war period.

=== British contribution to the Manhattan Project ===

Akers summoned Chadwick, Oliphant, Simon and Peierls to the United States. They arrived the day the Quebec Agreement was signed, ready to assist the Manhattan Project in any way possible. Akers was generally disliked and the Americans refused to move forward with collaboration unless a top British scientist who was &quot;accepted and sound of judgement&quot; was appointed instead. British officials dug in over Britain&#x27;s right to make its own appointments to its own government agencies. A compromise was reached, with Chadwick put in charge as Britain&#x27;s technical advisor for the Combined Policy Committee, and as the head of the British Mission to the Manhattan Project.
With this dispute settled collaboration could once again take place. Chadwick wanted to involve as many British scientists as possible so long as Groves accepted them. Chadwick&#x27;s first choice, Joseph Rotblat refused to give up his Polish citizenship. Chadwick then turned to Otto Frisch, who to Chadwick&#x27;s surprise accepted becoming a British citizen right away and began the screening process so he could travel to America. Chadwick spent the first few weeks of November 1943 acquiring a clear picture of the extensive Manhattan Project. He realised the scale of such sites as Oak Ridge, Tennessee, which was the new headquarters of the project, and could safely conclude that without similar industrial site being found in Germany the chances of the Nazi atomic bomb project being successful was very low.

With Chadwick involved the main goal was to show that the Quebec Agreement was a success. It was Britain&#x27;s duty to co-operate to the fullest and speed along the process. Chadwick used this opportunity to give as many young British scientists experience as possible so they might carry that experience to post-war Britain. He eventually convinced Groves of Rotblat&#x27;s integrity to the cause, and this led to Rotblat being accepted to the Manhattan Project without renouncing his nationality. Rotblat had been left in charge of the Tube Alloys research, and brought with him the results obtained since Chadwick had left.

The Montreal team in Canada depended on the Americans for heavy water from the US heavy water plant in Trail, British Columbia, which was under American contract, and for technical information about plutonium. The Americans said they would supply heavy water to the Montreal group only if it agreed to direct its research along the limited lines suggested by DuPont, its main contractor for reactor construction. Despite doing much good work, by June 1943 the Montreal Laboratory had come to a complete standstill. Morale was low and the Canadian Government proposed cancelling the project. In April 1944, a Combined Policy Committee meeting in Washington agreed Canada would build a heavy water reactor. The Americans agreed to support the project with information and visits, and to supply materials, including vital uranium and heavy water. The Montreal Laboratory would be given access to data from the Metallurgical Laboratory&#x27;s research reactors at Argonne and the X-10 Graphite Reactor at Oak Ridge, but not from the production reactors at the Hanford Site; nor was it to be given any information about the chemistry of plutonium, or methods for separating it from other elements. This arrangement was formally approved by the Combined Policy Committee meeting on 19 September 1944. John Cockcroft became the director of the Montreal Laboratory. The Chalk River Laboratories opened in 1944, and in 1946 the Montreal Laboratory was closed. The project developed the ZEEP reactor, which went critical in September 1945.

William Penney, one of the Tube Alloys scientists, was an expert in shock waves. In June 1944, he went to America to work at the Los Alamos Laboratory as part of the British delegation. He worked on the means to assess the effects of a nuclear explosion, and wrote a paper on what height the bombs should be detonated at for maximum effect in attacks on Germany and Japan. He served as a member of the target committee established by Groves to select Japanese cities for atomic bombing, and on Tinian with Project Alberta as a special consultant. Along with Group Captain Leonard Cheshire, sent as a British representative, he watched the bombing of Nagasaki from the observation plane &quot;Big Stink&quot;. He also formed part of the Manhattan Project&#x27;s post-war scientific mission to Hiroshima and Nagasaki that assessed the extent of the damage caused by the bombs.

The &quot;Smyth Report&quot; was issued by the US War Department on 12 August 1945, giving the story of the atomic bomb and including the technical details that could now be made public. It made few references to the British contribution to the bomb, and a White Paper, &quot;Statements Relating to the Atomic Bomb&quot;, was hurriedly drafted by Michael Perrin. This account was issued just after Clement Attlee had replaced Churchill as Prime Minister, and was the only official statement on the British contribution for fifteen years.

== Aftermath ==
=== Soviet spies in the Tube Alloys project ===

The Soviet Union received details of British research from its atomic spies Klaus Fuchs, Engelbert Broda, Melita Norwood and John Cairncross, a member of the notorious Cambridge Five. Alan Nunn May was recruited later in Canada. Lavrenty Beria&#x27;s report to Stalin of March 1942 included the MAUD reports and other British documents passed by Cairncross.

Fuchs began disclosing information to the Soviet Union about the possible production of a British atomic bomb when he joined the Tube Alloys project, although his contribution towards Soviet espionage was more severe during the Manhattan Project. Fuchs was able to contact a London-based KPD leader, Jürgen Kuczynski, who put him in contact with Simon Davidovitch Kremer, the secretary to the military attaché at the Soviet Union&#x27;s embassy, who in turn worked for the GRU (Russian: &quot;Главное Разведывательное Управление&quot;), the Red Army&#x27;s foreign military intelligence directorate. After three meetings, Fuchs was teamed up with a courier so he would not have to find excuses to travel to London. She was Ursula Kuczynski, the sister of Jurgen Kuczynski. She was also a German communist, a major in Soviet Military Intelligence and an experienced agent who had worked with Richard Sorge&#x27;s spy ring in the Far East.

=== Post-war ===


With the end of the war the Special Relationship between Britain and the United States &quot;became very much less special&quot;. Roosevelt died on 12 April 1945, and the Hyde Park Agreement was not binding on subsequent administrations. In fact, it was physically lost: when Wilson raised the matter in a Combined Policy Committee meeting in June, the American copy could not be found. The British sent Stimson a photocopy on 18 July 1945. Even then, Groves questioned the document&#x27;s authenticity until the American copy was located years later in the papers of Vice Admiral Wilson Brown Jr., Roosevelt&#x27;s naval aide, apparently misfiled by someone unaware of what Tube Alloys was—who thought it had something to do with naval guns.

The British government had trusted that America would share nuclear technology, which the British saw as a joint discovery. On 9 November 1945, Mackenzie King and the Prime Minister, Clement Attlee, went to Washington, D.C., to confer with President Harry Truman about future cooperation in nuclear weapons and nuclear power. The three leaders agreed there would be full and effective cooperation on atomic energy, but British hopes for a full resumption of cooperation on nuclear weapons were disappointed. The Americans soon made it clear that this was restricted to basic scientific research.

The passage of the Atomic Energy Act of 1946 (McMahon Act) in August 1946 made it clear that the UK would no longer be allowed access to the United States&#x27; atomic research. This partly resulted from the arrest for espionage of Alan Nunn May in February 1946. On 8 January 1947, Attlee formed a secret Gen 163 Cabinet committee, consisting of six cabinet ministers, which decided that Britain required the atomic bomb to maintain its position in world politics. In the words of the Foreign Secretary Ernest Bevin, &quot;That won&#x27;t do at all... we&#x27;ve got to have this... I don&#x27;t mind for myself, but I don&#x27;t want any other Foreign Secretary of this country to be talked to or at by a Secretary of State in the United States as I have just had in my discussions with Mr Byrnes. We&#x27;ve got to have this thing over here whatever it costs... We&#x27;ve got to have the bloody Union Jack on top of it.&quot;

Marshal of the Royal Air Force Lord Portal, was appointed to lead the effort, code-named High Explosive Research. The Atomic Energy Research Establishment (AERE) near Harwell, Oxfordshire, was created by Cockcroft in 1946 as the main centre for military and civilian atomic energy research and development. Penney led the bomb design effort as Chief Superintendent Armament Research (CSAR, pronounced &quot;Caesar&quot;), in charge of the Ministry Of Supply&#x27;s Armaments Research Department (ARD) at Fort Halstead in Kent and the Royal Arsenal at Woolwich. In April 1950 an abandoned Second World War airfield, RAF Aldermaston in Berkshire, was selected as the permanent home for what became the Atomic Weapons Research Establishment (AWRE). Penney assembled a team to initiate the work, firstly preparing a report describing the features, science and idea behind the American Fat Man implosion-type nuclear weapon. He broke down the development tasks required to replicate it, identifying outstanding questions that required further research on nuclear weapons.

On 3 October 1952, under the code-name &quot;Operation Hurricane&quot;, the first British nuclear device was successfully detonated in the Monte Bello Islands off the west coast of Australia. The Sputnik crisis and the development of the British hydrogen bomb led to the Atomic Energy Act being amended in 1958, and to a resumption of the nuclear Special Relationship between America and Britain under the 1958 US–UK Mutual Defence Agreement.

<text>The Royal Order of Kamehameha I (&quot;Kamehameha I e Hookanaka&quot;) is an order of knighthood established by Kamehameha V in 1864, to promote and defend the sovereignty of the Hawaiian Kingdom. Established by the 1864 Constitution, the Order of Kamehameha I is the second order of its kind in Hawaii.

Kamehameha I was the founder of the Kingdom of Hawaii and the House of Kamehameha. Both native Hawaiians and foreigners could be appointed to the Order, in each instance for distinguished service to the king and the people of Hawaii. Upon its inception, it became the first order of the Kingdom of Hawaii actually awarded (the Royal Order of the Cross and Crown was established by King Kamehameha III in 1848 but not awarded until much later). Through the decree of Kamehameha V, the Royal Order of Kamehameha was perpetually created. Its purpose to promote and defend the sovereignty of the Kingdom of Hawaii. It is chartered in the Kingdom of Hawaii by the decree of 1865.

*Moku O Kahekili (Maui)

<text>The yellow-throated warbler (Setophaga dominica) is a small migratory songbird species in the New World warbler family (Parulidae) found in temperate North America.

==Description==
In summer, male yellow-throated warblers display grey upperparts and wings, with double white wing bars. Their throats are yellow, and the remainder of their underparts are white, and are streaked with black on the flanks. Their heads are strongly patterned in black and white, with a long supercilium; the different subspecies may display yellow and white superciliums. Remiges and rectrices are black. They measure long.

Other plumages of these birds – females immatures and non-breeding males – resemble washed-out versions of the summer males; in particular they have a less crisply defined strong head pattern. They also have less bright yellows, and dark grey feathers instead of black ones in the body plumage. Compared to many other New World warblers, sexual dimorphism is slight.

The males&#x27; songs are clear, descending whistles. The calls are high &quot;see&quot;s or sharp &quot;chip&quot;s.

* Weight: 
* Wingspan: 

== Taxonomy ==
Yellow-throated warblers will occasionally hybridize with northern parulas (&quot;Setophaga americana&quot;), resulting in a hybrid species known as Sutton&#x27;s warblers. Sutton&#x27;s warblers lack the black streaks bordering the breast indicative of yellow-throated warblers, and have a suffused greenish-yellow wash on their back, which is also not indicative of yellow-throated warblers. The Sutton&#x27;s warbler was first discovered in 1940 in West Virginia.

==Distribution and habitat==
These birds breed in southeastern North America, and their breeding ranges extend from southern Pennsylvania and northern Missouri, to the Gulf of Mexico. One subspecies, from northwest Florida, is resident all year round. The other populations of this species are migratory, wintering at the Gulf Coast, eastern Central America, and the Caribbean. Vagrant wintering birds are sometimes seen in northernmost South America. 

In the United States, the yellow-throated warbler&#x27;s range differs from typical &quot;Setophaga&quot; warblers because they have a more expansive resident population in the South than other &quot;Setophaga&quot; warblers. Moreover, their breeding range is more southerly, and their wintering range more is northerly, than the other warblers in the genus. According to McKay et al., &quot;[t]he near absence of the species from the lower Piedmont of the Carolinas and Georgia ... presents a puzzle.&quot;

The yellow-throated warbler is a woodland species with a preference for coniferous or swamp tree species, in which it preferably nests. 

== Diet ==
They are insectivorous, but will include a considerable amount of berries and nectar in their diet outside the breeding season. Food is typically picked off tree branches directly, but flying insects may be caught in a brief hover.

== Breeding ==
These birds build cup-shaped nests which are built in trees, and are concealed amongst conifer needles or Spanish moss (&quot;Tillandsia usneoides&quot;). Their clutches consist of 3–5 (usually 4) eggs.

<doc id="698930" wikidata="Q6223455" url="?curid=698930" title="John Brown (North Carolina politician)">
<text>John Brown (1738–1812) was a teacher, farmer, and statesman from Wilkes County, North Carolina. He was a Captain in the Wilkes County Regiment of the North Carolina militia during the Revolutionary War, served as one of the state Treasurers (1782–1784), and served in the North Carolina state legislature (1784–1787).

==Background and family ==
John Brown was born in County Londonderry, Ireland in 1738, and about 1750 his family emigrated to Pennsylvania. He matured there and taught school in Lancaster County.

In 1770 he married Jane McDowell (1750–1833), the sister of Joseph McDowell. The couple settled into frontier life near her brothers. They built a farm on the banks of the Yadkin River in Surry County, North Carolina. They would have eleven children: James (1771), William (1774), Elizabeth (1776), John (1780), Ann (1782), Hugh (1784), Hamilton (1786), Thomas (1788), Margaret (1790) and Allen (1793). Elizabeth would marry James Stewart who became a U.S. Congressman. Most of their children would extend the frontier even further, moving to western Virginia and Tennessee.

==Public career ==
The farm prospered as the family grew and John become prominent in his community. He joined the Masons and became a captain of the local militia. In 1777 when Wilkes County was organized, the first meeting of the &quot;Court&quot; of the new county was held in his home, and he was appointed Justice of the Peace. Throughout the remainder of his life he held a number of county offices, such as recorder.

He was a captain in the Wilkes County Regiment under Colonel Benjamin Cleveland from 1780 to 1781. In 1780, he marched his militia company south with Colonel Cleveland&#x27;s force. Meeting other patriot forces at the Catawba River, they finally caught up with the British expeditionary force at King&#x27;s mountain, on the South Carolina border. They were part of the overwhelming victory in the Battle of King&#x27;s Mountain on October 7, 1780. The company returned with glory. Brown was later promoted to Colonel.

As North Carolina struggled to resolve the debts raised during the revolution, Brown was named as state treasurer for his district in 1782. He served until the districts were consolidated in 1784. That same year he was elected to North Carolina&#x27;s House of Commons, or the lower branch of the legislature. He was re-elected and served until 1787. In 1788 he was a delegate to the state convention in Hillsborough that ratified the United States Constitution in 1789 after its rejection in 1788.

He died in 1812, at home on his farm in Wilkes County about 4 miles west of Wilkesboro.

<doc id="698937" wikidata="Q322827" url="?curid=698937" title="Dick Celeste">
<text>Richard Frank Celeste (born November 11, 1937) is an American former diplomat, university administrator and politician from Ohio. A member of the Democratic Party, he served as the 64th governor of Ohio from 1983 to 1991 and remains the last Democrat to win re-election as Ohio Governor.

==Early life and career==
Celeste was born in Cleveland, Ohio and grew up in Lakewood, Ohio, the son of Margaret Louis and Frank Palm Celeste. His father was born in Cerisano, Italy. He graduated from Lakewood High School in 1955. In 1959, he graduated magna cum laude from Yale University where he was a member of Phi Beta Kappa. Celeste then received a Rhodes Scholarship to attend Exeter College at Oxford University, where he is an Honorary Fellow. There he met Dagmar Ingrid Braun, whom he married in Austria in 1962. After returning to the United States, Celeste served as staff liaison office in the Peace Corps and as special assistant to Chester Bowles.

Celeste was elected to the Ohio House of Representatives from Cuyahoga County in 1970. His Ohio House District included western Cleveland and Lakewood, where his father Frank, had once served as mayor. He was subsequently elected the 55th lieutenant governor of Ohio in 1974 (defeating Republican John W. Brown, serving under the Republican James A. Rhodes—at the time, Ohio&#x27;s lieutenant governor was elected separately from the governor, so the victors could be of different parties). In 1978, Celeste ran for governor, but lost to incumbent Rhodes. President Carter appointed Celeste Director of the Peace Corps from 1979 to 1981, where he was responsible for programs in 53 countries.

==Governor of Ohio==

In 1982, Celeste defeated Attorney General William J. Brown and former Cincinnati Mayor Jerry Springer in the primary, and then the Republican candidate Clarence J. &quot;Bud&quot; Brown Jr., to become governor of Ohio. In 1986, Celeste was re-elected, defeating the Republican candidate, former governor James Rhodes who had served four prior terms (1962–70 and 1974–82). Thus Celeste served as governor of Ohio from 1983 to 1991. In 1988 he served as the Chairman of the Midwestern Governors Association.

As governor, Celeste increased support for human services, mental health &amp; addiction recovery services, funding for education and children services including providing onsite daycare for state employees. Before the Celeste era, Ohio ranked near the bottom among states in funding for these programs. Celeste and the Democratic-controlled legislature increased the state income tax by approximately 40% while also retaining a temporary tax of 50% instituted by the Republican predecessors. Celeste is noted for opening many government positions to African Americans and women—he hired more women to cabinet positions than all previous governors combined. Celeste also allowed state employee unions to negotiate wages and benefits, rather than just working conditions. At the end of his last term he commuted several Ohio prisoners death sentences to life terms. Among them was Debra Brown&#x27;s along with the sentences of most alleged battered women serving sentences at Marysville state prison for murdering their alleged aggressors. He also commuted Donald Lee Maurer to life in prison. Maurer had been convicted of raping and killing his 8 year old Massillon neighbor Dawn Marie Hendershot in the early 1980s.

Under the Celestes, the Governor&#x27;s art exhibits, chamber music concerts and First Lady&#x27;s spiritual retreats and theology gatherings as well as Christmas and Hanukkah parties for neighborhood kids became regular seasonal events. The Residence Gardens, especially the rose garden, one of the oldest in the nation, were reconstituted and The Friends of the Residence were formed, with Les Wexner as their first president, to help raise private funds to defray the cost of those improvements.

==Post-gubernatorial political career==

Celeste then established the consulting firm Celeste &amp; Sabety Ltd. in Columbus. After he served as the director of the DNC&#x27;s healthcare campaign in 1993, President Clinton appointed him as United States Ambassador to India, a position he served in from 1997 to 2001.

Celeste is a member of the advisory board of the Roosevelt Institution, a student think tank. He is a member of the Council on Foreign Relations. Celeste, along with Thomas Kean who co-chaired the 9/11 Commission, co-chairs the Homeland Security Project for The Century Foundation. He also sits on the board of the Independent Strategic Assessment Group, United States Northern Command (NORTHCOM), which is the military command over the USA established in the wake of the attacks of September 11. Celeste joined the board of Directors of Glimcher Realty Trust in September 2007. Celeste has also been a member of the CHF International Board of Trustees since January 2012.

He is currently on the board of directors for Battelle for Kids, a not-for-profit organization dedicated to moving education forward for students by supporting the educators who work with them every day.

In 2020, Celeste, with another former governor Bob Taft were appointed to establish and lead a task force to help expand COVID-19 testing in Ohio during the pandemic.

==President of Colorado College==
Celeste was inaugurated as the 12th President of Colorado College in 2002.

During his tenure as president, Celeste raised $200 million for such things as capital improvements and scholarships to help disadvantaged and minority students. His other accomplishments included Addition of 20 tenure-track faculty positions, a large increase in the size of the student applicant pool, from 3,533 in 2003 to 4,455 in 2010, and an increase in selectivity, with 55.9 percent of applicants accepted in 2003 to 33.3 percent accepted in 2010.

Celeste oversaw major renovations of campus buildings, including Palmer Hall, Cossitt Hall and Packard Hall; construction of the interdisciplinary Edith Kinney Gaylord Cornerstone Arts Center.

In 2004, a Jewish group called for Celeste&#x27;s resignation after he invited a high-profile Palestinian to give a lecture.

Celeste was known for bringing the community and the college together. He was the president of the Colorado Springs Downtown Partnership, the Colorado Economics Future Panel, the NCAA Presidential Task Force on the Future of Intercollegiate Athletics, and the Colorado Forum, which tackles public policy issues.

Celeste has since retired as President of Colorado College. He started serving as president in 2002, and was replaced in July 2011 by Jill Tiefenthaler, provost and economics professor at Wake Forest University.

==Personal life==
Celeste had six children with his first wife, Dagmar. The couple divorced in 1995. Celeste is currently married to Jacqueline Lundquist. Celeste and Lundquist have one child, Sam. Celeste has 13 grandchildren, including two who were students at Colorado College and one who is a graduate of Case Western Reserve University.

His brother, Theodore S. Celeste, successfully ran as a Democratic Party candidate for the Ohio House in 2006.

In 2022, Celeste&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;In the Heart of it All: An Unvarnished Account of My Life in Public Service&quot; (), was published.

==Legacy==
The Celeste Center at the Ohio Expo Center and State Fair in Columbus, Ohio, is named in honor of Celeste. The Richard F. Celeste Laboratory of Chemistry on the Columbus Campus of the Ohio State University is named in honor of the former Governor. In addition, the Richard F. Celeste Theater at the Cornerstone Arts Center of Colorado College is named in honor of his tenure as president.

<doc id="698941" wikidata="Q7202032" url="?curid=698941" title="Plastic.com">
<text>Plastic.com (2001–2011) was a general-interest internet forum running under the motto &#x27;Recycling the Web in Real Time&#x27;.

The website was community-driven, with readers moderating discussions, submitting stories, and participating in their selection.

==The site==
Plastic was launched in January 2001 by Automatic Media, a conglomerate that included the pioneering webzines Feed and Suck.com. In keeping with Automatic&#x27;s model of small, low-cost websites, Plastic launched with a staff of only four, amongst them &quot;Suck&quot; co-founder Joey Anuff as editor-in-chief. When Automatic Media folded in June of that year, several of the editors stayed on, working for free. On November 2, 2001, the site was sold for $30,000 to &quot;Suck&quot; co-founder Carl Steadman, who became its sole owner. Steadman took the site offline for two weeks and relaunched it on December 16, 2001, after falling out with Anuff, who no longer contributed to Plastic after the relaunch.

Plastic did not feature any advertising, and was supported entirely by user donations. The site used a modified version of Slash, the content management system developed and distributed by Slashdot, and it was almost entirely member-driven. As of November 11, 2008, there were 50,218 accounts, with several thousand being active members. For a while, Plastic offered email accounts.

Plastic closed permanently in February 2011, about a month after its ten-year anniversary.

Plastic was briefly succeeded by Trees and Things, although that website has been defunct since 2014.

==Content==
The site&#x27;s topics included &quot;etcetera&quot;, &quot;filmtv&quot;, &quot;media&quot;, &quot;music&quot;, &quot;politics&quot;, &quot;scitech&quot;, and &quot;work&quot;. Topics covered on the board were primarily related to current events. Plastic&#x27;s content was entirely driven by user-submitted stories. A typical Plastic story selected a topic based around a story found on an external link, with the Plastic user providing a larger context for that article with supporting links and some editorial comment. The stories were often written in a way that frames a discussion for the other readers to post comments within. Readers are invited to post their comments in the stories, which can be moderated by other users. New submissions will appear in the Submissions Queue (&quot;subQ&quot;), which is visible to all users, and can be voted on by users with 50 &quot;karma&quot; or higher. Each voter can give the sub 0, .5, or 1 points, and high-ranking subs will eventually become full-fledged stories that can be commented upon. In addition to voting on the submissions, users are given a 255 character text field to suggest changes to the story, post helpful links to exterior sites or previous Plastic stories, or suggest alternate headlines for the story itself. One of Plastic&#x27;s volunteer editors will then properly format the story for running on &quot;the front page&quot;.

===Karma and moderation===
Plastic&#x27;s moderation system was modeled on the one established by Slashdot, and very similar to it. Commenting plastic members were randomly awarded moderation points which could be given out as they saw fit. In any discussion thread, a person with moderation points was able to moderate a post up or down, based on the content, with a descriptive tag, such as &#x27;compelling&#x27;, &#x27;scholarly&#x27;, &#x27;astute&#x27;, &#x27;disingenuous&#x27;, &#x27;obnoxious&#x27;, etc. It cost one point to moderate a post up, and two to mod a post down. A given comment could have a score between –1 and 5 inclusive at half point intervals, and Plastic users were able to set a personal threshold where no comments with a lesser score were displayed. (For example, a person with a score threshold of 1 would not see comments with a score of –1 or 0 but would see all others.) Non-registered users were allowed to post anonymously. Plastic members had the option to block anonymous postings. Additionally, anonymous posts started with a karma score of 0, below the default moderation threshold of 1. Registered Plastic members also had the option to post anonymously, which allowed them to make controversial or offensive comments without fear of losing karma. This practice was generally frowned upon.

*0 karma or higher was required to post comments in stories and submit stories to the subQ
*5 karma or higher was required to post QuickLinks
*50 karma or higher was required to vote in the subQ
*The members with the highest karma had access to other tools, including the list of all other users in the &quot;Top Karma&quot; group and a list of all members currently logged in. The &quot;Top Karma&quot; page stated that this list was limited to the top 250 members, &quot;give or take&quot;, but in reality the list contained 566 members as of 12 August 2005. The minimum karma required to be on this list was 120.5. At 120.5, members were able to see the list of all members currently logged in, and at 121, members had access to the &quot;Top Karma&quot; list. Previously the list showed the karma totals for all members on the list, but at some point this was changed so that karma details are accessible only in &quot;bands&quot;—higher-karma members can see details of all lower scoring members&#x27; karma scores, but lower-scoring members were able to see higher rankings only in bands such as +1500, +2500, +5000, etc.

As with the story submission queue, some Plastic members complained that many comments were moderated (especially down) based on political motivations, usually to aid liberal posts or downgrade conservative posts. As with most member-moderated sites, many downmods were motivated by personal feuds. The moderation system did not encourage these practices, and the top karma bands typically included several self-described conservative members.

===QuickLinks===
A member with at least 5 karma points could also post QuickLinks (a &quot;QL&quot;), which appeared on the sidebar. No designated place existed on the site for discussion of these links, but users frequently responded directly to the poster of the QL through private messages. As with comments, Quicklinks could be modded up or down, although the system was different—any registered user with a minimum karma score of 1 could vote a Quicklink up or down. If a link received at least six more up votes than down votes, the submitter would automatically receive 1.5 karma. If a link was modded down with six more down votes than up votes, the submitter would be docked 1.5 karma and the QL would disappear from the site (but still be available in the archive). QuickLinks were used for breaking news, follow-ups to previously discussed items, or humorous stories with little discussion potential.

==Plastic Chat==
Plastic used to have an online chat server at irc://chat.plastic.com, port 6667. It also was previously available through a modified CGI:IRC client at https://web.archive.org/web/20050406191329/http://chat.plastic.com/. The chat server has been inexplicably down for an extended period of time.

==Awards==
* In 2001, Plastic won a Webby award in the category of &quot;Print + Zines&quot;, beating out its parent Feed Magazine, as well as Mother Jones Magazine, Nerve, and The Position.com.

<doc id="698969" wikidata="Q1127424" url="?curid=698969" title="The Horse Whisperer (film)">
<text>The Horse Whisperer is a 1998 American neo-western drama film directed by and starring Robert Redford, based on the 1995 novel &quot;The Horse Whisperer&quot; by Nicholas Evans. Redford plays the title role, a talented trainer with a remarkable gift for understanding horses, who is hired to help an injured teenager (played by Scarlett Johansson) and her horse back to health following a tragic accident.

The film was released on May 15, 1998. It received generally positive reviews from critics and grossed nearly $187 million worldwide.

== Plot ==
In Lake Luzerne, New York, teenager Grace MacLean and her best friend Judith go out early one winter&#x27;s morning to ride their horses, Pilgrim and Gulliver. As they ride up an icy slope, Gulliver slips and hits Pilgrim. Both horses fall, dragging the girls onto a road, and get hit by a tractor-trailer. Judith and Gulliver are killed, while Grace and Pilgrim are both severely injured.

Grace, left with a partially amputated right leg, is bitter and withdrawn after the accident. Meanwhile, Pilgrim is traumatized and uncontrollable to the extent that it is suggested he be put down. Grace&#x27;s mother Annie, a strong-minded and workaholic magazine editor, refuses to allow it, sensing that somehow Grace&#x27;s recovery is linked with Pilgrim&#x27;s.

Desperate for a way to heal both Grace and Pilgrim, Annie tracks down a &quot;horse whisperer&quot;, Tom Booker, in the remote Montana mountains. Tom agrees to help, but only if Grace also takes part in the process. Grace reluctantly agrees, and she and Annie go to stay at the Booker ranch where Tom lives with his brother and his brother&#x27;s family.

As Pilgrim and Grace slowly overcome their trauma, Annie and Tom begin to develop a mutual attraction. However, they are both reluctant to act on these feelings – Annie is married and Tom had his heart broken before (his wife left him because she belonged in the city). Tom also asks Grace to tell him what happened with her and Pilgrim to understand what Pilgrim is feeling. At first, Grace is reluctant, but eventually gathers up her courage, and tearfully describes the accident.

The status quo between Annie and Tom is broken when Robert MacLean, Grace&#x27;s father and Annie&#x27;s husband, unexpectedly shows up at the ranch. Annie is increasingly torn between her feelings for Tom and her love for her family. Soon, with Tom&#x27;s help, Grace finally takes the last step to heal herself and Pilgrim – riding Pilgrim again. As the MacLeans get ready to leave the ranch, Robert tells Annie that he knows he loved her more than she loved him, and that if he could be a better father, husband, or lawyer then it didn&#x27;t matter, he did it all for the love he had for her. He felt that he didn&#x27;t need more, he knew she was not sure how she felt about him, and now he wants her to make a choice, and not to come home until she is sure.

Although Annie wishes she could stay with Tom on the ranch, she also knows that she belongs to the city, just like Tom&#x27;s wife. Annie departs, driving away from the ranch, while Tom watches her go from the top of a hill.

==Cast==
==Production==
Although he had already directed several films, this was the first time Robert Redford directed a film that he also starred in.

The main character, according to writer Nicholas Evans, is modeled after horse whisperers Tom Dorrance, Ray Hunt and, in particular, their younger disciple Buck Brannaman. Brannaman also doubled for Robert Redford in the film and served as the consultant. Redford likewise assisted in the production of the documentary &quot;Buck.&quot; Evans said, &quot;Others have claimed to be the inspiration for Tom Booker in &quot;The Horse Whisperer&quot;. The one who truly inspired me was Buck Brannaman. His skill, understanding, and gentle, loving heart have parted the clouds for countless troubled creatures. Buck is the Zen master of the horse world.&quot;

==Horse training accuracy==
The schooling administered to the traumatized horse in the film is faithful to a number of basic natural horsemanship techniques, although the portrayal in the film does not follow the specific method of any one practitioner. Nicholas Evans writes: &quot;I spent many weeks traveling across the West and met three amazing horsemen: Tom Dorrance, Ray Hunt and Buck Brannaman.&quot;

While Brannaman was the on-site technical consultant, he did not have creative control. The constraints of film-making required several sequences showing horse training methods to be edited for length. This meant certain critical training elements that would normally be used were not presented on screen. Lapses in safety were also shown in the film such as Redford kneeling in front of a horse known to charge humans, and wearing a large ring on his finger while holding a rope while handling a dangerous horse.

The plot also used an improbable scenario that was contrary to basic horse psychology. Pilgrim, an apparently a well-trained horse, suddenly becomes vicious following a single traumatic event. Horses may have a strong reaction to an incident or there were elements that preceded the trauma that had been repeated (for example, Pilgrim developed a fear of vehicles, crossing roads, or steep slopes from past experience). However, a complete change in personality, manner, and outlook would normally be the result of sustained, long-term animal abuse.

John Lyons, a practitioner of natural horsemanship, noted that while there were many positive messages in the film, he was concerned audiences might get an inaccurate message about horse training. First Pilgrim was portrayed in the film by multiple well-trained animals. Second the movie did not represent a real-life time frame for training a single real-life animal. He pointed out that the film made the rehabilitation of the horse appear to be a one-session event when in reality it would take considerable time for such a change to occur. Lyons criticized a number of dangerous practices shown in the movie, and was particularly critical of the scene where Booker hobbles, ropes, and lays the exhausted horse on the ground, then has Grace get on the recumbent horse, which is then allowed to rise, and the horse and girl miraculously are both cured of their fears and once again a horse and rider team. He argued that the actual real-life practical risk of injury to horse and human in such a method is considerable, that a horse pushed to exhaustion is not &quot;trained&quot;, and pushing a fearful rider in such a fashion is ill-advised. However, Lyons&#x27; critique also recognized the limitations of Hollywood film-making, stating, &quot;In order to tell a story, things are often done that would be imprudent for horse owners to attempt.&quot;

==Reception==
=== Box office ===
&quot;The Horse Whisperer&quot; grossed $74.4 million in the United States and Canada, and $111.5 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $186.9 million.

In its opening weekend, the film made $13.7 million and finished in second, then made $14.5 million and $7.5 million the following two weekends.

=== Critical response ===
On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 73% based on 63 reviews, with an average rating of 7/10. The website&#x27;s critics consensus reads: &quot;It might be a bit too eager to tug the heartstrings, but &quot;The Horse Whisperer&quot; is typically graceful, well-crafted Redford—on both sides of the camera.&quot; At Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 65 out of 100, based on 19 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;A−&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Janet Maslin in &quot;The New York Times&quot; says that the film &quot;sustains great visual intensity thanks to Robert Richardson&#x27;s majestic cinematography&quot; but its &quot;rock-solid values&quot; are diluted by &quot;a misconceived ending&quot;, whereas CNN in a rather sarcastic review complains that the storytelling was &quot;all done very, very slowly&quot; and mentions the film&#x27;s length. Film critics Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert gave the film &quot;two thumbs up&quot; on their weekly TV show &quot;At the Movies&quot;. In his movie guide, Leonard Maltin gave the film out of 4 stars, calling it &quot;an exquisite rendering of Evans&#x27; novel&quot;.

The song &quot;A Soft Place to Fall&quot; by Allison Moorer and Gwil Owen was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Original Song. Moorer performs the song in the movie. The film was nominated for Best Motion Picture – Drama and Redford for Best Director at the 56th Golden Globe Awards.

==In popular culture==
The movie&#x27;s popularity led to the word &quot;whisperer&quot; being used as a slang term for anyone with a strong affinity for a particular animal or being.

In the 2015 biographical feature film &quot;Steve Jobs&quot;, Apple CEO John Sculley (Jeff Daniels) has a talk with Steve Jobs (Michael Fassbender) because Jobs is perceived to be difficult to communicate with, and Sculley is perceived to be a &quot;Steve whisperer&quot;.

<text>Wilson Eduardo Álvarez Fuenmayor (born March 24, 1970) is a Venezuelan former professional baseball player. He played in Major League Baseball as a left-handed pitcher. During a thirteen-year baseball career, he pitched for the Texas Rangers, Chicago White Sox, San Francisco Giants, Tampa Bay Devil Rays, and Los Angeles Dodgers.

==Career==
Born in Maracaibo, Venezuela, Alvarez represented his hometown in the 1982 Little League World Series, where they finished with a 2–1 record. Alvarez was signed by the Texas Rangers as an amateur free agent on September 23, 1986. He made his major league debut at the age of nineteen on July 24, 1989, the first player born in the 1970s to debut in MLB. Five days later, he was traded with Scott Fletcher and Sammy Sosa to the Chicago White Sox for Harold Baines and Fred Manrique. Alvarez provided one of the highlights of the 1991 Chicago White Sox season on August 11, pitching a no-hitter against the Baltimore Orioles at Memorial Stadium in his second Major League start. In his previous appearance, with the Rangers, he faced five batters and gave up two walks, a single and two home runs without retiring a batter, giving him an undefined career ERA prior to his no-hitter.

Between the majors, minors and winter league play, Alvarez pitched close to 300 innings in 1991; an extremely heavy workload. In 1993 he managed to break into the Sox starting pitching rotation permanently. That season, Alvarez won 15 games and finished second in the league in earned run average, but he experienced control problems and led the league with 122 walks.

In 1994, Alvarez went 12–8 and made the American League All-Star team. After a disappointing 8–11 in 1995, he had 15 wins and 181 strikeouts in 1996.

During the season, the White Sox traded Álvarez, Danny Darwin, and Roberto Hernández to the San Francisco Giants for six prospects (Keith Foulke, Bob Howry, Lorenzo Barceló, Mike Caruso, Ken Vining, and Brian Manning) in what became known as the White Flag Trade. A free agent after 1997, he signed a five-year contract with Tampa Bay. He was first in the team&#x27;s starting rotation, and started Opening Day on March 31, 1998, throwing the Devil Rays&#x27; first ever pitch (a ball to Detroit&#x27;s Brian L. Hunter).

In his first season with the Devil Rays Alvarez missed two months with tendonitis in his shoulder, eventually losing 14 games during the season. The following year he made two trips to the disabled list. Finally, he had arthroscopic shoulder surgery and missed the next two seasons. After finishing his contract with Tampa Bay, Álvarez signed with the Dodgers. He began the 2003 season as a starter for Triple-A Las Vegas. After going 5–1 with a 1.15 ERA, he filled the long relief role for the Dodgers at mid-season. Later he got a chance to start, collecting a 5–0 record and 1.06 ERA over a stretch of nine games. In 2004, he went 7–6 in 40 games (15 as a starter).

On August 1, 2005, Alvarez announced he would retire after the season. He compiled a career 102–92 record with 1330 strikeouts and a 3.96 ERA in 1747.2 innings.

In 2010, Álvarez was inducted into the Caribbean Baseball Hall of Fame.

After a brief stint as the pitching coach of the State College Spikes, Álvarez joined the Baltimore Orioles organization when he was named pitching coach of the Gulf Coast League Orioles in 2013. In June 2019, he was replaced as Orioles pitching coach.

<doc id="698978" wikidata="Q862237" url="?curid=698978" title="Bill Keller">
<text>Bill Keller (born January 18, 1949) is an American journalist. He was the founding editor-in-chief of &quot;The Marshall Project&quot;, a nonprofit that reports on criminal justice in the United States. Previously, he was a columnist for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, and served as the paper&#x27;s executive editor from July 2003 until September 2011. On June 2, 2011, he announced that he would step down from the position to become a full-time writer. Jill Abramson replaced him as executive editor.

Keller worked in the &quot;Times&quot; Moscow bureau from 1986 to 1991, eventually as bureau chief, spanning the final years of the Cold War and the dissolution of the Soviet Union. For his reporting during 1988 he won a Pulitzer Prize.

==Early life==

Keller is the son of former chairman and chief executive of the Chevron Corporation, George M. Keller. He attended the Roman Catholic schools St. Matthews and Junípero Serra High School in San Mateo, California, and graduated in 1970 from Pomona College, where he began his journalistic career as a reporter for a campus newspaper called &quot;The Collegian&quot;. From July 1970 to March 1979, he was a reporter in Portland with &quot;The Oregonian&quot;, followed by stints with the &quot;Congressional Quarterly Weekly Report&quot; and the &quot;Dallas Times Herald&quot;. He is married to Emma Gilbey Keller and has three children.

==&quot;The New York Times&quot;==

Keller joined &quot;The New York Times&quot; in April 1984, and served in the following capacities:
* Reporter in the Washington, D.C. bureau (1984–1986)
* Reporter in the Moscow bureau (1986–1988)
* Bureau chief in the Moscow bureau (1988–1991)
* Bureau chief in the Johannesburg bureau (1992–1995)
* Foreign editor (1995–1997)
* Managing editor (1997–2001)
* Op-ed columnist and senior writer (2001–2003)
* Executive editor (July 2003 to September 2011)

He won the Pulitzer Prize for International Reporting for his &quot;resourceful and detailed coverage of events in the U.S.S.R.&quot; during 1988. That is, in the Soviet Union during the year it established its Congress of People&#x27;s Deputies, the last year before the revolutions of 1989 in Central and Eastern Europe.

===Bush Adminstation ===
Keller and &quot;The Times&quot; also published a story on another classified program to monitor terrorist-related financial transactions through the Brussels, Belgium-based Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT) on June 23, 2006. Many commentators, as well as some elected officials such as U.S. Congressman Peter T. King, called for the U.S. Justice Department to prosecute &quot;The New York Times&quot; and the confidential sources who leaked the existence of this counter-terrorism program despite relevant statutes that forbid revealing classified information that could threaten national security, especially in a time of war.

In an attempt to respond to criticism stemming from the disclosure of the classified Terrorist Finance Tracking Program, the NSA program&#x27;s official name, Keller stated in a published letter that President Bush himself had acknowledged as early as September 2001 that efforts were underway &quot;to identify and investigate the financial infrastructure of the international terrorist networks&quot; and &quot;to follow the money as a trail to the terrorists.&quot; In an Op-ed column in &quot;The Times&quot;, Keller, together with &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; editor Dean Baquet wrote that &quot;Our job, especially in times like these, is to bring our readers information that will enable them to judge how well their elected leaders are fighting on their behalf and at what price.&quot; Keller&#x27;s critics, including U.S. Treasury Secretary John W. Snow, responded to Keller&#x27;s letter by pointing out that there is a vast difference between stating general intentions to track terrorist finances and the exact means employed to achieve those goals. But, as Keller wrote, this was the same Secretary Snow who invited a group of reporters to a 6-day trip on a military aircraft &quot;to show off the department&#x27;s efforts to track terrorist financing.&quot;

Keller was a leading supporter of the 2003 invasion of Iraq, explaining his backing for military action in his article &#x27;The I-Can&#x27;t-Believe-I&#x27;m-A-Hawk Club&#x27;. Two days after the invasion, Keller wrote the column &#x27;Why Colin Powell Should Go&#x27;, arguing for US Secretary of State&#x27;s resignation because his strategy of diplomacy at the UN had failed. In contrast, Keller was much more sympathetic to Deputy Defence Secretary Paul Wolfowitz, describing him as the &#x27;Sunshine Warrior&#x27;.

On July 6, 2005, Keller spoke in defense of Judith Miller and her refusal to give up documents relating to the Valerie Plame case.

===NSA Terrorist Surveillance Program===

Keller was reported to have refused to answer questions from &quot;The Times&quot; public editor, Byron Calame, on the timing of the December 16, 2005 article on the classified National Security Agency (NSA) Terrorist Surveillance Program. Keller&#x27;s delay of the paper&#x27;s reporting about NSA overreach until after Bush&#x27;s close reelection was controversial. &quot;The Times&#x27;s&quot; series of articles on this topic won a Pulitzer Prize. The source of the disclosure of this NSA program was investigated by the United States Justice Department. The NSA program itself was reviewed by the Senate Judiciary Committee as to whether it sidesteps the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, and after &quot;The Times&quot; articles, the Administration changed its procedures, allowing for more safeguards and more Congressional and judicial oversight.

Keller discussed the deliberations behind the Times&#x27; decision to publish the story in a July 5, 2006 PBS interview with Jeffrey Brown that included a discussion of the issues involved with former National Security Agency Director Admiral Bobby Ray Inman.

===Catholic Church sex abuse crisis===

Keller widely reported on the Catholic sex abuse cases and flatly put the blame on John Paul II himself : &quot;The uncomfortable and largely unspoken truth is that the current turmoil in the Roman Catholic Church is not just a sad footnote to the life of a beloved figure. This is a crisis of the pope&#x27;s making.&quot;

==Nelson Mandela==

Keller wrote a 128-page juvenile biography of Nelson Mandela published by Kingfisher Books in 2008, &quot;Tree Shaker: The Story of Nelson Mandela&quot;. He had served as the &quot;Times&quot; bureau chief in Johannesburg from April 1992 to May 1995—spanning the end of apartheid in South Africa and election of Mandela&#x27;s African National Congress as the governing party in 1994.

Keller&#x27;s wife since 1999, Emma Gilbey, wrote a full biography of Winnie Mandela published in 1993, &quot;The Lady: The Life and Times of Winnie Mandela&quot; (Jonathan Cape).
==The Marshall Project==

The Marshall Project is a nonprofit nonpartisan online journalism organization covering criminal justice in the United States. The project was originally conceived by former hedge fund manager, filmmaker and journalist Neil Barsky, who announced it in his byline in an unrelated &quot;New York Times&quot; article in November 2013. In February 2014, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that Keller was going to work for the Marshall Project. The Marshall Project formally launched in November 2014. Keller was editor in chief of the Marshall Project from 2014 until his retirement in 2019.

<text> (; ) refers to an economic phase in 19th century Germany and Austria before the great stock market crash of 1873, and a Central European architectural style, often historicist in character, which lasted from the mid- to late-19th century.

== Economy ==

The so-called &quot;Gründerzeit&quot; or &quot;age of the founders&quot; lasted for just six years, from 1867 to 1873. The term refers to a short-lived economic boom and the economic rise of the German Empire, when hundreds of new businesses, banks and railways were founded. German writers of the late 19th century used the term &quot;Gründerzeit&quot; as a pejorative, because the cultural output of that movement is associated with materialism and nationalistic triumphalism. Cultural historian Egon Friedell complained that fraud in the stock market had not been the only swindle of the &quot;Gründerzeit&quot;.

== Design and architecture ==
The need for housing rose in consequence of industrialization. Complete housing developments in the so-called Founding Epoch Architecture style arose in previously green fields, and even today, Central European cities have many buildings from the time together along a single road or even in complete districts. The buildings have four to six stories and were often built by private property developers. They often sported richly-decorated façades in the form of Historicism such as Gothic Revival, Renaissance Revival, German Renaissance and Baroque Revival. Magnificent palaces for nouveau-riche citizens but also infamous rental housing for the expanding urban lower classes were built.

The period was also important for the integration of new technologies in architecture and design. A determining factor was the development of the Bessemer process in steel production, which made possible the construction of steel façades. A classical example of the new form is the steel and glass construction of the Crystal Palace, completed in 1851, which was then revolutionary and inspired subsequent decades.

Gründerzeit districts, called , were built all over Germany, Austria and even in Hungary.

== In Austria ==
In Austria, the &quot;Gründerzeit&quot; began after 1840 with the industrialisation of Vienna, as well as the regions of Bohemia and Moravia. Liberalism reached its zenith in Austria in 1867 in Austria-Hungary and remained dominant until the mid-1870s.

Vienna, the imperial capital and the residence of Emperor Franz Joseph, after the failed uprising of 1848 became the fourth-largest city in the world with the inclusion of suburbs and an influx of new residents from other regions of Austria. Where the city wall had once stood, a ring road was built, and ambitious civic buildings, including the Opera House, Town Hall, and Parliament, were also built. In contrast to agricultural workers and urban labourers, an increasingly-wealthy upper-middle class installed monuments and mansions. That occurred on a smaller scale in other cities such as Graz but on the periphery, which preserved the old city from destructive redevelopment.

== In Germany ==
In the mindset of many Germans, the epoch is intrinsically linked with Kaiser Wilhelm I and Chancellor Bismarck, but it did not end with them (in 1888 and 1890, respectively) but continued well into the reign of Kaiser Wilhelm II. It was a Golden Age for Germany in which the disasters of the Thirty Years&#x27; War and the Napoleonic Wars were remedied, and the country competed internationally in the areas of science, technology, industry and commerce. Particularly, the German middle class rapidly increased its standard of living, buying modern furniture, kitchen fittings and household machines.

In German-speaking areas, a huge number of publications were produced that was comparable, on a per-capita basis, to modern levels. Most were academic papers or scientific and technical publications, often practical instruction manuals on topics such as dike construction. There was no copyright law in most countries except in the United Kingdom. Since popular works were immediately republished by competitors, publishers needed a constant stream of new material. Fees paid to authors for new works were high and significantly supplemented the incomes of many academics. The prices of reprints were low and so publications could be bought by poorer people. A widespread public obsession with reading led to the rapid autodidactic dissemination of new knowledge to a broader audience. After copyright law gradually became established in the 1840s, the low-price mass market vanished, and fewer but more expensive editions were published.

The social effects of industrialisation were the same as in other European nations. Increased agricultural efficiency and introduction of new agricultural machines led to a polarized distribution of income in the countryside. The landowners won out to the disadvantage of the agrarian unpropertied workforce. Emigration, most of it to America, and urbanisation were consequences.

In the rapidly-growing industrial cities, new workers&#x27; dwellings were erected, lacking in comfort by today&#x27;s standards but criticised even then as unhealthy by physicians: &quot;without light, air and sun&quot;, they were quite contrary to the prevailing ideas on town planning. The dark, cramped flats took much of the blame for the marked increase in tuberculosis, which spread also to wealthier neighbourhoods.

Nevertheless, the working class also saw improvements of living standards and other conditions, such as social security through laws on workers&#x27; health insurance and accident insurance introduced by Bismarck in 1883–1884, and in the long run also through the foundation of a social democracy that would remain the model for the European sister parties until Hitler&#x27;s &quot;Machtübernahme&quot; in 1933. Even today, the model of social care developed by Bismarck in 1873 (Reichsversicherungsordnung) remains the contractual basis for health insurance in Germany.

<doc id="698984" wikidata="Q4309890" url="?curid=698984" title="Maryville College">
<text>Maryville College is a private liberal arts college in Maryville, Tennessee. It was founded in 1819 by Presbyterian minister Isaac L. Anderson for the purpose of furthering education and enlightenment into the West. The college is one of the 50 oldest colleges in the United States and the 12th-oldest institution in the South. It is associated with the Presbyterian Church (USA) and enrolls about 1,100 students. Its mascot is the Scots, and sports teams compete in NCAA Division III athletics in the Collegiate Conference of the South.

==Academics==

As a liberal arts school, the college promotes a well-rounded education. The school requires numerous general education courses to achieve this. The courses are taken through the conclusion of the student&#x27;s education, contributing to the graduating student&#x27;s becoming knowledgeable in a number of fields.

Maryville College is one of the few colleges in the nation that requires graduating students to complete a comprehensive exam in their major and conduct an extensive senior thesis.

&quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; in its Best Colleges ranks Maryville #3 in Regional Colleges South, #1 in Best Colleges for Veterans, and #2 in Best Undergraduate Teaching.

==History==
===Founding===
Maryville College was founded as the Southern and Western Theological Seminary in 1819 by Isaac L. Anderson, a Presbyterian minister. Anderson had founded a school, Union Academy, in nearby Knox County, before becoming minister at New Providence Presbyterian Church in Maryville. He expressed to his fellow clergy the need for more ministers in the community, including a request to the Home Missionary Society and an appeal to divinity students at Princeton University in 1819. The new seminary was intended to help fill this need for ministers. It opened with a class of five men, and the new school was adopted by the Synod of Tennessee and formally named the Southern and Western Theological Seminary in October 1819.

After receiving its charter from the Tennessee General Assembly in 1842, the school adopted its current name: Maryville College.

===Integration===
In 2004, Maryville College was recognized by the Race Relations Center of East Tennessee for its history of &quot;contributing to improving the quality of life for all in East Tennessee&quot;. Maryville College was racially integrated from its earliest days. An ex-slave named George Erskine studied there in 1819, sponsored by the Manumission Society of Tennessee. Erskine went on to preach during the 1820s and was formally ordained by the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church in 1829.

Maryville College was closed during the Civil War, but, upon reopening, it again admitted students regardless of race, assisted by the Freedmen&#x27;s Bureau.

When the State of Tennessee forced Maryville College to segregate in 1901, the college gave $25,000—a little more than a tenth of its endowment at the time—to Swift Memorial Institute, the college&#x27;s sister school. Swift was founded by William Henderson Franklin, the first African American to graduate from Maryville College (1880). His institute educated black students during the era of imposed segregation.

After the Brown v. Board of Education decision in 1954, Maryville College immediately re-enrolled African Americans.

In 1875, Maryville College conferred the first college degree to a woman in the state of Tennessee. The recipient was Mary T. Wilson, the older sister of Samuel T. Wilson, who later served as president of the college from 1901 until 1930.

==Campus==
Maryville College is located in the City of Maryville, Blount County, Tennessee. Its current campus was established in 1869 on a that was then on the city&#x27;s outskirts. Several campus buildings were completed over the next five decades, with financial help from major institutions and philanthropists. The college&#x27;s historic buildings comprise the Maryville College Historic District, which was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982; Anderson Hall is also separately listed on the National Register.

===Buildings on campus===
*Anderson Hall: The oldest building on campus, Anderson Hall houses the Humanities and Education departments. Donations for its construction came from the Freedmen&#x27;s Bureau and philanthropists William Thaw, a Pittsburgh industrialist, and John C. Baldwin of New York.
*Thaw Hall: Thaw Hall was completed in 1923 with donations from Mary Thaw of Pittsburgh. It functions as the campus library, as well as housing the Academic Support Center, Social Sciences, and Environmental Studies departments. 
*Cooper Athletics Center: This building currently houses the Athletics department, as well as the Cooper Success Center.
*Fayerweather Hall: Originally a science building, this building is named for Daniel B. Fayerweather of New York, who provided funds for its construction. It was designed by Baumann Brothers of Knoxville and completed in 1898. Fayerweather now houses most of the administrative offices of Maryville College, as well as the AJB Financial Aid office.
*Bartlett Hall: Built by Kin Takahashi and many other students, this building houses the offices of Student Development, Student Involvement, Resident Life, Center for Calling and Careers, The Learning center, Security, the book store, the Post Office, Multicultural Center, and Isaac&#x27;s Cafe.
*Pearsons Hall: This building houses the main dining hall and two floors of residential housing.

*Ruby Tuesday (RT) Lodge: Since 1997, this building has been used as a private corporate retreat for the company Ruby Tuesday.
*Alumni Gym: This building is used to house campus events.
*Physical Plant: This is where all campus maintenance offices are located. 
*Center for Campus Ministry: This building houses the campus chapel and is the office of the campus Minister, Volunteer relations, and several other &quot;volunteer&quot; related officers.

===Campus housing===
The vast majority of Maryville College students reside in one of the many on-campus residence halls, which are:

*Gamble Hall: Co-ed; typically first-year housing. Rooms are available as both doubles and singles. Also features communal bathrooms.
*Davis Hall: Co-ed; typically first-year housing. Rooms are available as both doubles and singles. Also features communal bathrooms.
*Copeland Hall: Co-ed; typically first-year housing. Rooms are available as both doubles and singles. Also features communal bathrooms.
*Pearsons Hall: renovated for residential use on the second level in 2015.
*Lloyd Hall: Lloyd Hall offers suite-style living primarily to upperclassmen. These rooms are composed of a living room, two bathrooms, and either two doubles or a double and two singles. Some rooms also contain kitchens.
*Carnegie Hall: Carnegie hall offers suite-style rooms primarily for upperclassmen. Most rooms are quad-suite in which two double rooms share a kitchen and bathroom. Carnegie hall also offers single rooms in which a bathroom is shared by three residents.
*Beeson Village: Beeson Village offers apartment style living for primarily upperclassmen and is one of the newer campus living accommodations. 
*Gibson Hall: Gibson Hall offers suite-style living primarily to upperclassmen. The newest residence hall at Maryville College, which offers suite style living almost identical to that of Lloyd Hall. Gibson Hall is a &quot;wellness hall&quot;, which means that students must refrain from drinking, smoking, and drug use within the building.
All residence halls besides Copeland, Davis, Gamble, Gibson, and Pearsons allow alcohol to those of age.

===Campus improvement plan===
In 2010 Maryville College finished the construction of the Clayton Center for the Arts. This new CCA building is home to a large theatre, a flex theatre, and also classrooms and offices for professors of Maryville College. There are also plans to renovate Anderson Hall beginning June 2013. The renovations will focus on the interior and are estimated to be completed by August 2014.

===Features of the college===

The college&#x27;s heating system started as an experiment by the Tennessee Valley Authority, the Department of Energy and the college in 1982. Coinciding with the World&#x27;s Fair in Knoxville, the experiment tested the efficiency of burning wood waste as an energy source. Tours of the plant and demonstrations were held at the college.

The college&#x27;s oldest building, Anderson Hall, built in 1870, is currently used as a classroom building. It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

Crawford House is an LEED Gold certified building, and it is the oldest of 5 existing buildings to be made so in Tennessee.

==Athletics==
Maryville College sponsors 17 varsity sports under the guidelines of NCAA Division III. They are a founding member of the Collegiate Conference of the South (CCS) after they split with Maryville&#x27;s former conference USA South. They still are affiliate members in USA South for Football and Women&#x27;s Golf.

Maryville plans to move to Southern Athletic Association in the 2026-27 academic year.
Maryville also sponsors a varsity women&#x27;s equestrian team; while that sport is recognized by the NCAA as part of its Emerging Sports for Women program, Division III has yet to incorporate equestrian into the Emerging Sports program. Finally, Maryville lists its female cheerleaders (but not its male cheerleaders) and all-female dance team as varsity teams on its athletic website.

The Maryville Scots football team was the second sponsored sport at Maryville, started in 1889 by Maryville Scots Athletics Hall of Fame member, Kin Takahashi, who served as team captain, quarterback, and head coach from 1892 to 1897.

In football, Maryville played in the 1947 Tangerine Bowl – the inaugural playing of what is now the Citrus Bowl – losing 31–6 to Catawba College.

==Weekend programs==
The East Tennessee Japanese School (イーストテネシー補習授業校 &quot;Īsuto Teneshī Hoshū Jugyō Kō&quot;), a weekend Japanese education program, holds its classes at the college. It opened in August 1989, as the Blount County (ブラントカウンティ) Japanese School. In 1990 the school used Maryville students as volunteer instructors; according to Kumiko Franklin, the principal, there were 40 such volunteers applying for four positions.

<text>The Guns of August (published in the UK as August 1914) is a 1962 book centered on the first month of World War I written by Barbara W. Tuchman. After introductory chapters, Tuchman describes in great detail the opening events of the conflict. The book&#x27;s focus then becomes a military history of the contestants, chiefly the great powers.

&quot;The Guns of August&quot; provides a narrative of the earliest stages of World War I, from the decisions to go to war up until the start of the Franco-British offensive that stopped the German advance into France. The result was four years of trench warfare. In the course of her narrative Tuchman includes discussion of the plans, strategies, world events, and international sentiments before and during the war.

The book was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for General Nonfiction for publication year 1963, and proved very popular. Tuchman later returned to the subject of the social attitudes and issues that existed before World War I in a collection of eight essays published in 1966 as &quot;The Proud Tower: A Portrait of the World Before the War, 1890–1914&quot;.

==Synopsis==
The funeral of King Edward VII in May 1910 introduces Kaiser Wilhelm II and his relationship with the British monarchy, pivotal elements in the looming conflict. The remaining twenty one chapters of the book are grouped in three parts: &quot;Plans&quot;, &quot;Outbreak&quot; and &quot;Battle&quot;.

&quot;Plans&quot; delves into the prewar military strategies of the four major European powers:
* Germany – The Schlieffen Plan to avoid a two-front war involved attacking France through Belgium with a strong right wing, but Schlieffen&#x27;s successor as the chief of German General Staff, Helmuth von Moltke the Younger, weakened the plan, leading to assumptions of a swift victory that were overly optimistic (chapter 2).
* France – After decades of defensive strategies following their defeat at Sedan, France adopted General Joseph Joffre&#x27;s offensive Plan XVII in 1913, emphasizing attack and broad operational plans (chapter 3).
* Britain – The military cooperation with France evolved from informal arrangements to a formal naval agreement and Britain preparing to deploy the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) but these initiatives were supported by a narrow and fragile political will (chapter 4).
* Russia – Despite internal weaknesses and corruption, Russia&#x27;s massive army planned an invasion of Eastern Prussia, prompting Germany to prepare reactive strategies to protect this critical territory (chapter 5).

&quot;Outbreak&quot; meticulously chronicles the events that led Europe into war, hour by hour, between August 1 and 4, 1914:
* On August 1, Germany ordered general mobilization; its offensive might have taken a radically different direction if Wilhelm II, on the basis of a misunderstood telegram from London, had managed to convince Moltke to change plans; but Moltke prevailed and Luxembourg was invaded (chapter 6).
* France declared general mobilization on the same day in response to Germany&#x27;s ultimatum to Russia while in London Prime Minister H. H. Asquith&#x27;s divided Cabinet failed to move (chapter 7).
* On August 2, 1914, Germany presented Belgium with an ultimatum, which King Albert rejected (chapter 8).
* On August 3 and 4, political leaders in Germany, France, Belgium, and Britain unified their nations behind the war imperative; Germany declared war on France and invaded Belgium, which triggered Britain&#x27;s entry into the war, with only a few leaders foreseeing a prolonged conflict (chapter 9).

&quot;Battle&quot; extensively details three of the four European military fronts of August 1914:
* the Western Front: the Battle of the Frontiers (chapters 11 to 14), the battle of ideas (chapter 17), and the fighting in France up to the beginning of the First Battle of the Marne (chapters 19 to 22) 
* the Eastern Prussia Front (chapters 15 and 16); 
* the sea front: the Adriatic Campaign (chapter 10) and more generally the strategies of the three main naval forces, the UK, Germany and the US (chapter 18).

The afterword reflects on the First Battle of the Marne, highlighting the deadlock and immense human and material costs of the Western Front. Despite the Allies&#x27; eventual success in saving Paris, the war&#x27;s initial battles failed to be decisive and resulted in a war of attrition. The next four years of war were mostly determined by the events that took place in August 1914.

==Summary by chapters==

=== Ch. 1 – A Funeral ===
On May 20, 1910, of the nine kings who led the funeral of King Edward VII, Kaiser Wilhelm II held conflicted views on his deceased uncle. In public, he was the gravest and most attentionate mourner. In private, he scorned Edward&#x27;s personal diplomacy which supported Britain&#x27;s shift from isolation to alliances with former foes France and Russia, calling his uncle &quot;Satan&quot; for plotting to encircle Germany. Wilhelm&#x27;s inner tension reflected a wider polarisation around the question of Germany&#x27;s rise, illustrated by two influential books. In &quot;The Great Illusion&quot; Norman Angell demonstrated that any war between large states was impossible because of its exorbitant cost whereas General von Bernhardi argued in &quot;Germany and the Next War&quot; that his nation had to either attack and annihilate France, or accept its downfall. On that May morning of 1910 &quot;the sun of the old world was setting in a dying blaze of splendor never to be seen again.&quot;

===Plans===

====Ch. 2 – &quot;Let the Last Man on the Right Brush the Channel with His Sleeve&quot;====
To avert a two-front war, Schlieffen saw it as a &quot;military necessity&quot; to attack France via Belgium, whose perpetual neutrality was guaranteed internationally since 1839. If Germany threw seven-eighths of its 1.5 million soldiers against France, it could beat it in six weeks before turning to Russia. Influenced by Clausewitz and the recent decisive victories over Austria and France, Schlieffen&#x27;s plan aimed to march 34 active and 20 reserve divisions through Belgium. Such a strong right wing would envelop the French armies and rake in the BEF. Schlieffen presumed Belgium would merely protest but the Kaiser, who wanted more assurance, unsuccessfully attempted to bribe King Leopold II by promising him French territories and money. Moltke, who succeeded Schlieffen in 1906, weakened the right wing at each new iteration of the war plan. His version of June 1914 saw Paris capitulate 39 days after mobilisation but assumed delusively that every possible contingency could be planned for.

====Ch. 3 – The Shadow of Sedan====
The humiliating defeat at Sedan set France on the defensive for forty years. Sixteen war plans were produced, each defensive. But her direction changed a few years to 1914 after it gradually regained confidence in itself as a nation and General Foch planted the seed of the mystique of the will in the military doctrine. The War Council, pressed by the War Minister Messimy, replaced in 1911 the defensive General Michel with General Joffre, who developed Plan XVII, the first offensive war plan adopted by the War Council in May 1913 and ready for distribution to generals in February 1914. Its bold goal – go to Berlin via Mainz – was not supported by a detailed operational war plan like Schlieffen&#x27;s but instead emphasised the army&#x27;s imperative – Attack! – and laid out war options that generals could implement depending on circumstances.

====Ch. 4 – &quot;A Single British Soldier …&quot;====
Russia&#x27;s defeat to Japan in 1905 precipitated Germany in probing France in Morocco and Britain in developing military arrangements with France after Campbell-Bannerman authorised Wilson to open informal works with his French counterpart. But this embryonic military cooperation waned after the first Moroccan crisis subsided. It re-emerged in 1910 when Wilson used his new position of Director of Military Operations and his friendship with Foch to reinvigorate joint war plans, just in time for the second Moroccan crisis of 1911, whose aftermath was a shake up of the Royal Navy&#x27;s top brass, a naval agreement between Britain and France and a non-binding mutual support of their armies. Wilson delivered &quot;Plan W&quot; by the spring of 1914. Britain&#x27;s military was ready to deploy the BEF and 145,000 men to France but the British political leaders were not: only the few involved in the CID were aware of these military commitments.

====Ch. 5 – The Russian steamroller====
Not withstanding its defeats (Crimea in 1856, Manchuria in 1905) and defects, Russia&#x27;s imposing 6.5 million men army unsettled Germany and reassured France and Britain, its Triple Entente allies. After the defeat to Japan, Grand Duke Nicholas, as chair of the Council of National Defence, initiated military reforms but these were thwarted in 1908 when the conservatives dissolved it. The same year, Sukhomlinov became Minister of War. Corrupt and inefficient, he froze the modernisation of the army and changed Chief of Staff six times by 1914. Still, despite these weaknesses, Russia planned to invade Eastern Prussia with two armies totalling 800,000 men. But Germany was determined to retain this vital territory. Max Hoffmann, anticipating that the Russian army would have to split around the Masurian lakes, considered two reactive tactics: a retreat or a frontal assault on either flank.

===Outbreak===
Archduke Franz Ferdinand&#x27;s assassination on June 28, 1914, led Austria to seek Serbia&#x27;s annexation, with German backing on July 5. Austria&#x27;s ultimatum on July 23, followed by a declaration of war on July 28 and Belgrade&#x27;s bombardment on July 29, provoked Russia to mobilize on July 30 to defend Slav interests and its prestige. Germany&#x27;s ultimatum to Russia on July 31 intensified the crisis. &quot;War pressed against every frontier.&quot;

====Ch. 6 – August 1: Berlin====
Kaiser Wilhelm decreed general mobilization at 5 PM on August 1, initiating the invasion of Luxembourg at 7 PM. However, an opportunity to change this course and the twentieth century emerged shortly after 5 PM when Foreign Minister Jagow and Chancellor Bethmann-Hollweg unexpectedly received a telegram from Ambassador Lichnowsky stating that Britain would remain neutral if Germany did not attack France. The Kaiser immediately sought to alter the war plan: &quot;Now we can go to war against Russia only. We simply march the whole of our Army to the East!&quot; But an apoplectic Moltke rebuked him: &quot;Your Majesty, [the war plan] cannot be altered.&quot; Despite General von Staabs arguing in 1925 that technically four of the seven armies could have been deployed to the Eastern Front by August 15, temperamentally it is difficult to believe Germany would not have attacked France when &quot;Der Tag&quot; arrived. Lichnowsky&#x27;s second telegram at 11 PM made this point moot: it clarified that Britain&#x27;s neutrality required Germany to refrain from attacking both France and Russia. Admiral von Tirpitz pragmatically questioned the wisdom of serving an ultimatum to Russia if Germany did not intend to attack it, but diplomatic protocol and military schedules prevailed: the German die was cast.

====Ch. 7 – August 1: Paris and London====
On July 30, the French Cabinet, led by Premier Viviani, made the unprecedented decision &quot;never before taken in history&quot; to withdraw troops ten kilometers from its borders to avoid clashes with the German Army. Germany and Russia immediately sought France&#x27;s stance in a potential conflict. On the evening of July 31, German Ambassador von Schoen posed the question through diplomatic channels, while Russian Ambassador Isvolsky pressed President Poincaré at 2 AM in his bedroom. Viviani responded to Schoen at 11 AM on August 1, stating, &quot;France will act in accordance with her interests.&quot; Minutes later, Isvolsky informed the French of Germany&#x27;s ultimatum to Russia. The Cabinet convened and decreed the general mobilization that Joffre had been advocating for since July 29. By 4 PM, the first mobilization posters appeared at Place de la Concorde, with mobilization starting at midnight.

The British Cabinet was divided over whether to support France in case of war. The four Liberal Imperialists, Asquith, Grey, Haldane, and Churchill, believed Britain&#x27;s national interest lay in supporting France, while the Little Englanders led by Morley, were suspicious of any foreign adventures. Asquith patiently balanced the mounting tensions. At the July 31 Cabinet meeting, Grey threatened to resign if Britain chose neutrality over supporting France. The next day, Lloyd George described Germany&#x27;s potential attack on France as requiring only a &quot;little violation&quot; of Belgian territory. Four Little Englanders – Morley, Burns, Simon, and Harcourt – proposed to resign if Britain implemented the naval agreement with France, and the Cabinet did not authorize Grey and Churchill&#x27;s actions. Nevertheless, Churchill, who &quot;smelled battle afar off [like] the war horse in Job&quot; had already ordered the British fleet to its war stations at Scapa Flow on July 28 and persuaded Asquith on July 29 to authorize the Warning Telegram, initiating the Precautionary Period. After the Cabinet denied him further authority, Churchill mobilized the fleet upon learning that Germany had declared war on Russia. Grey, sensing that the Little Englanders might only be persuaded if Belgian neutrality was violated, asked France and Germany on July 31 if they would respect Belgian neutrality. France responded positively within an hour, but Germany remained silent.

====Ch. 8 – Ultimatum in Brussels====
On the morning of August 2, 1914, German Minister assured Foreign Minister Davignon that Belgium had nothing to fear from Germany, despite the invasion of Luxembourg. That evening, Below was asked to open the sealed envelope he had received from Berlin on July 29: it contained Germany&#x27;s ultimatum. Dumbfounded, he presented it to Davignon at 7 PM, expecting a reply by 7 AM the next morning. This carefully crafted document asserted that France was about to enter Belgium to attack Germany, which in reaction would &quot;anticipate this attack&quot; to assert its self-defense rights and have to pass through Belgium. Were Belgium to resist, it would be treated as an enemy.
King Albert was less surprised than Below. In November 1913, Kaiser Wilhelm and General Moltke had conveyed to him their readiness to wage war against France, citing constant provocations. Despite the poor state of its army, which consisted of only six infantry and one cavalry division, no heavy artillery, no clear war strategy, and four different mobilization plans, Albert remained resolute: &quot;Our answer must be &#x27;No&#x27; whatever the consequences.&quot;
As the Belgian officials were busy drafting their reply, the German government had second thoughts. Fearing that Belgian resistance would disrupt the critical operational schedule towards Paris, it instructed Below to persuade the Belgians to comply. At 1:30 AM on August 3, during a surprise visit to the Foreign Office, he used the fake news of French dirigibles bombing Nuremberg to imply that France would next invade Belgium. Unconvinced by this last-minute logic, Belgium formally rejected the German demand on August 3 at 7 AM, being &quot;firmly resolved to repel every attack upon its rights.&quot; That evening, angered by the Kaiser&#x27;s dismissive reply to the last-minute appeal he had sent on August 1, Albert ordered the destruction of bridges and tunnels to impede any German advance.

====Ch. 9 – &quot;Home before the leaves fall&quot;====
August 3 and 4 were key action days: the German, French, Belgian and British political leaders crystallized into national unions the tensions that had been building up for months, and the German General Staff declared war on France and invaded Belgium.

On the political front: At 3 PM on August 3, Grey revealed to the House of Commons the existence of informal military talks with France and asked it not to stand by and witness the violation of Belgian neutrality and the &quot;unmeasured aggrandizement of any power whatsoever.&quot; The House responded with overwhelming applause.

On August 4 at 9 AM, an hour after Belgium was invaded, King Albert’s question to the parliament, “Are you unalterably decided to maintain intact the sacred gift of our forefathers?&quot; was met with resounding shouts of &quot;Oui! Oui! Oui!” A few hours later, Viviani’s eloquent speech to the joint session of the French Senate and Chamber was greeted with cheers, especially after announcing Italy&#x27;s choice to stay neutral. Simultaneously in Berlin, the Kaiser famously declared in his speech from the throne: “From this day on, I recognize no parties but only Germans.” At 3 PM, Bethmann-Hollweg informed the Reichstag that German troops were “perhaps already in Belgium&quot; and admitted publicly that this “invasion [was] contrary to international law”, after which it unanimously voted for a 5 billion mark war credit and adjourned for four months.

On the military front: On August 3 at 6:30 PM, Ambassador Schoen delivered to Viviani the German declaration of war on France on the ground of organized hostility, alleged French aviators bombarding Nuremberg and flying over neutral Belgium, all of which Viviani categorically denied.

On August 4, Germany invaded Belgium at Gemmerich at 8:02 AM after its ultimatum was rejected. Moltke, who had anticipated in 1912 that invading Belgium would trigger Britain’s entry into the war, was not surprised, contrary to the Kaiser and Beltmann-Hollweg, when Grey sent Britain’s ultimatum to Germany and demanded a reply by midnight.

The prevalent opinion in all belligerent countries was well captured by the Kaiser’s words to his departing troops: “You will be home before the leaves have fallen from the trees.&quot; Only Joffre, Moltke, and Kitchener foresaw a prolonged conflict, with Kitchener predicting the war would take “[at least] three years, [...such a long time that] no one living knows how long.&quot;

===Battle===

====Ch. 10 – &quot;Goeben ... An Enemy Then Flying&quot;====
Tuchman starts the &quot;Battle&quot; section by covering the search by Allied naval forces for the German battlecruiser in the Mediterranean (chapter 10). The &quot;Goeben&quot; finally took refuge in the Dardanelles, waters of the then neutral Ottoman Empire. Such naval actions set off diplomatic maneuvers, but the event precipitated Turkey&#x27;s entry into the war on the side of Germany. The development worked to block Russian import/export via its year-round ports on the Black Sea. That, in turn, led to the disastrous Gallipoli Campaign.

====Ch. 11 – Liège and Alsace====
As they crossed the Belgian frontier, the German armies were engaged by the Belgian army in front of Liège, five French armies in the east of France and four British divisions (known as the British Expeditionary Force) in the south of Belgium. The French were said to be labouring under the delusion that Gallic élan would be crucial in countering German attacks while the British fought hard at the Battle of Mons. In August, each side deployed its armed forces in order to effect its own strategies developed in advance of the war (discussed in &quot;Plans&quot;).

====Ch. 12 – BEF to the Continent====
The War Council met on August 5 to approve the General Staff&#x27;s war plans but Lord Kitchener, a highly respected figure – &quot;For England to have gone to war without Kitchener would have been as unthinkable as Sunday without church&quot; – disrupted the proceedings. He predicted the war would last at least three years and require the army to grow from twenty-four to seventy divisions. Fearing that a joint commandment with the French would imperil the nucleus of the regular army around which he planned to build this stronger army, he expressed &quot;profound contempt&quot; for the war plan. Despite his objections, the Council agreed to send six BEF divisions to a French port, with the final location to be decided later.

That evening a leak from the Westminster Gazette about the BEF&#x27;s size sparked uproar. The next day, the Council, meeting with French Colonel Huguet, reduced the BEF to four divisions and cavalry. Tensions flared when Kitchener reprimanded Wilson for revealing to Huguet BEF’s embarkation times, which he deemed a secret. Wilson’s sharp response – he viewed Kitchener &quot;as much an enemy of England as Molke&quot; – left a lasting strain on their cooperation which would not help the BEF.

On August 12, at the last War Council before engagement, Kitchener made a last attempt to shift the BEF’s concentration point seventy miles back from Maubeuge to Amiens, fearing a German envelopment. Despite his authority, even he could not alter the predetermined plan as there was no time for alternatives. After intense debate, he reluctantly conceded but issued John French conflicting orders: the BEF was to support France but avoid undue risk and remain entirely independent of Allied command. This lack of unity &quot;was to haunt the Allied war effort long after Sir John was replaced and Kitchener himself was dead.&quot;

The 80,000 soldiers of the BEF embarked on August 9 and were greeted with a rapturous welcome by French crowds all their way to Mons.

====Ch. 13 – Sambre et Meuse====
Although delayed by Belgian resistance, the German armies advance through Belgium and prepare their right wing for the outflanking manoeuvre. The French get ready for their main offensive in the Ardennes. The BEF advances towards the left flank of the French armies. The Germans enter Brussels on August 20th.

====Ch. 14 – Debacle: Lorraine, Ardennes, Charleroi, Mons====
The French High Command had made incomplete allowances for dealing with the large massed attack by the German army, which now came quickly bearing down on them. It was perhaps through the decisions of Charles Lanrezac, the French Fifth Army commander, who acted in a timely fashion before getting permission from Joseph Joffre, that the entire French line was eventually saved from envelopment and general collapse. Although his pleas were ignored, Lanrezac withdrew his forces at Charleroi from an untenable position and probable destruction, and he redeployed them more favorably. He was later relieved of command.

====Ch. 15 – &quot;The Cossacks Are Coming&quot;====
The invasion of East Prussia began on August 12, when General Gurko, part of Rennenkampf&#x27;s First Army, took the town of Marggrabowa. On August 17, Rennenkampf&#x27;s 200,000-strong army crossed the border from the north, advancing along a 35-mile front toward the Insterburg Gap and pushing ahead of them a wave of panicked Germans, crying &quot;The Cossacks are coming!&quot; Meanwhile, Samsonov&#x27;s Second Army was advancing from the south, intending to complete a pincer movement. However, poor coordination between the two Russian armies, unencrypted communications, and severe ammunition shortages undermined the plan.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Von Prittwitz’s Eighth Army had its own problems, the most prominent of which was its lack of leadership. On August 20, General von François, disobeying Prittwitz’s orders, charged ahead and defeated the Russian 28th Division at Gumbinnen. But when Mackensen&#x27;s 35th Division was routed, Prittwitz insisted on retreating the army behind the Vistula. This reaction to the defeat led Moltke to dismiss at once Chief of Staff Waldersee and Prittwitz on August 21 and replace the former with Ludendorff on the same day, who immediately ordered François to move south to support General Scholtz’s XX Corps, and the latter with Hindenburg on August 23. Hindenburrg and Ludendorff met Scholtz at Tannenberg on August 24 and learned from intercepted communications that Samsonov’s army would launch a major attack the next day. Ignoring Rennenkampf’s northern forces, Hindenburg and Ludendorff concentrated their entire army on defeating Samsonov, setting the stage for the decisive Battle of Tannenberg.

====Ch. 16 – Tannenberg====
Chapter 16 presents Germany&#x27;s reaction to the invasion which culminates at the Battle of Tannenberg, where the Russian advance is stopped, decisively. Tuchman covers the series of errors, faulty plans, poor communications, and poor logistics, which, among other things, decidedly helped the French in the west. For example, the Germans mistakenly transferred, from the west, two corps to defend against what the book refers to as the &#x27;Russian Steam Roller&#x27;. The great misery that developed on the Eastern Front is noted.

====Ch. 17 – The Flames of Louvain====
Woven into the text about the battles in Belgium are threads of fact that Allied governments would employ in the formation of the West&#x27;s eventual opinion that Germany had been &quot;the aggressor nation&quot; against Belgium. Such facts and conclusions would be repeated for the duration of the war and greatly affect the future involvement of the United States.

Also here in chapter 17 &quot;The Flames of Louvain&quot;, Tuchman places a selection of German views from a variety of sources as to the aims and desires of Germany. She cites Thomas Mann as saying the goal was &quot;the establishment of the German idea in history, the enthronement of &quot;Kultur&quot;, the fulfillment of Germany&#x27;s historical mission&quot;. She then conveys American reporter Irvin S. Cobb&#x27;s account of an interview with a &#x27;German scientist&#x27;: &quot;Germany [is] for progress. German &quot;Kultur&quot; will enlighten the world and after this war there will never be another.&quot; Yet further, a &#x27;German businessman&#x27; opines that the war will give Europe &quot;a new map, and Germany will be at the center of it&quot; (aims similar to the Septemberprogramm). Such outspoken menace worked to solidify opposition to Germany, caused George Bernard Shaw to become &quot;fed up&quot; at Prussian Militarism, and H. G. Wells to condemn the German &quot;war god&quot; and hope for an end to all armed conflict.

Chapter 17&#x27;s main focus is the German army&#x27;s atrocities in Belgium, in particular against the historic university city of Louvain. Tuchman frames her remarks by describing the Schrecklichkeit, the German military&#x27;s &quot;theory of terror&quot;. Accordingly, in a failed attempt to suppress the &quot;illegal&quot; franc-tireur (civilians shooting at German troops), hundreds of nearby citizens at several Belgium towns had been executed. Her accounts of the ferocity of such German army reprisals against the general population and of the willful burning of Louvain, such as its university library make it obvious why the Western Allies might feel themselves justified to condemn Germany and Germans wholesale.

====Ch. 18 – Blue Water, Blockade and the Great Neutral====
Chapter 18 describes the British fear that since their island nation was dependent on overseas imports, the German navy could manage to disrupt their international trade. Although Britain&#x27;s navy was superior in ships and experience, perhaps the German navy&#x27;s &quot;best opportunity for a successful battle was in the first two or three weeks of the war.&quot; However, the German High Seas Fleet remained in port and was ordered not to challenge the British warships watching the North Sea. Thus, a substantial control over the world&#x27;s seaways was then exerted by the British Royal Navy.

Surrounding the neutral role of the United States, diplomatic politicking quickly intensified. On August 6, Washington formally requested the Europeans to agree to follow the 1908 &quot;Declaration of London&quot;, which &quot;favored the neutrals&#x27; right to trade as against the belligerents&#x27; right to blockade.&quot; Germany agreed. Britain &quot;said Yes and meant No&quot; and supplemented an &quot;Order of Council&quot; on August 20 (the 100th anniversary of Britain&#x27;s burning of Washington). Despite the equitable intent of international law, Britain sought to receive supplies from America while its naval blockade of Germany denied the supplies to Germany. Woodrow Wilson had already advised Americans on August 18 to be &quot;neutral in fact as well as in name, impartial in thought as well as in action&quot; so that America might become the &quot;impartial mediator&quot; that could then bring &quot;standards of righteousness and humanity&quot; to the belligerents in order to negotiate &quot;a peace without victory&quot; in Europe. Both wartime paper profits from a nearly fourfold increase in trade with Britain and France and &quot;German folly&quot; eventually would later work to cause American entry into World War I.

====Ch. 19 – Retreat====
On August 25, Joffre issued a General Order to form a Sixth Army, which was transported to Amiens to support the British and the French Fourth and Fifth Armies. On August 26, at the Battle of Le Cateau, the 75,000 strong BEF led by Smith-Dorrien lost over 8,000 men but managed to delay the Germans. The French Fifth Army, under Lanrezac, struggled to retreat, regroup, and establish a defensive line; coordination issues and miscommunications with Field Marshall French added to the chaos and confusion. By August 28, German commanders, particularly von Kluck, shifted their focus from cutting off the British to enveloping both the British and French forces, significantly impacting the German campaign&#x27;s progress. By September 2, the French armies had fallen back 150 miles from their starting positions on August 24; soldiers retreated haggard, hungry, and exhausted, marching past their own homes which they knew Germans would occupy the next day.

====Ch. 20 – The front is Paris====
August 29 and 30 proved to be turning points for the French Army. On the 29th, Lanrezac repelled a German attack at the bridge of Guise. However, Joffre, unaware of this success, could only see his Fifth and Sixth Armies in precarious positions and the BEF retreating. During this “most tragic [period] in all of French history” Joffre ordered, in &quot;wonderful calm&quot;, generals d’Amade and Lanrezac to pull back and blow up the bridges over the Somme and the Oise. Next day brought worse news: Russia’s Second Army had just been defeated at Tannenberg and 70,000 soldiers taken prisoner. Yet, another intelligence report gave him reason to hope: Moltke had decided to transfer two German corps (70,000 soldiers) from West to East.

Britain also turned a corner at home and on the battlefront. On August 30, the censor F. E. Smith urged The Times to publish Arthur Moore’s Amiens dispatch which detailed Germany’s advances. This powerful recruitment propaganda landed on a public opinion that had been shaped since August 27 by a rumor that 70,000 Russian troops had been transported across Britain to aid French forces. These soldiers were, in fact, “phantom,” but the British public’s hallucination was so strong that it contaminated France, where droves of Parisians gathered at railway stations to welcome these imaginary Cossacks, and Germany, where it influenced the military command at the Marne as much as the actual troop movements. On the military front, Sir John French informed Lord Kitchener on August 29 that he planned to withdraw the BEF behind the Seine due to his waning confidence in the French troops, which were &quot;fall[ing] back right and left of [him …], a militant misstatement of the truth, after Joffre had just finished telling him the opposite.&quot; Lord Kitchener was so shocked by the mere idea that the BEF could retreat, a &quot;calamitous&quot; act and &quot;a violation of the spirit of the Entente&quot; that he confronted French at the British Embassy in Paris on September 1 and persuaded him to keep his troops engaged with the French forces. Britain was turning its corner.

As for the German Army, it was now within 30 miles of Paris, so tantalizingly close that it was about to distribute to its soldiers a bronze medal inscribed &quot;Entry of German Troops in Paris – 1871–1914.&quot;

====Ch. 21 – Von Kluck&#x27;s Turn====
After defeating Maunoury, Kluck sought to change his strategy, aiming southeast to outflank Lanrezac and close the gap with Bülow. He needed reinforcements, but Moltke, paralyzed by indecision, was focused on three issues: i) failing to capture Paris as scheduled, ii) rumors of 80,000 Russian reinforcements, and iii) widening gaps between his armies, which could only be closed by abandoning the conquest of Nancy and Toul.

Despite Moltke’s hesitation, Kluck acted. Recognizing that Maunoury was defeated, the BEF was absent, and his flank was secure, Kluck decided on August 31 to turn southeast at Bülow&#x27;s suggestion to cut off the French Vth Army&#x27;s retreat. Moltke approved the change, eager to resolve the gaps between his forces and maintain the Paris timeline.

However, Kluck’s aggressive nature would lead to his undoing. On September 1, he unexpectedly encountered the BEF at Compiègne and Villers-Cotterêts, but instead of letting them retreat, he pursued them and lost two days. Additionally, he ignored Moltke’s orders to follow the Second Army in echelon, opting to press ahead toward the Marne aiming to drive the French southeastward.

It took the French two days to act on the realization Kluck had turned away from Paris. On August 31, Captain Lepic was surprised to notice two German columns heading toward Compiègne, not Paris. The following day Captain Fagalde found a map on a dead German cavalryman confirming the shift. Acting on this intelligence, Joffre issued General Order No. 4 on September 2, directing the Third, Fourth, and Fifth Armies to retreat toward the Seine and Aube. Once the Fifth Army had evaded encirclement and received reinforcements from eastern France and the mobile units of Paris, they would go on the offensive. Gallieni, now commanding the Sixth Army, ordered Maunoury to destroy the bridges on the Oise and advised the government to evacuate Paris for Bordeaux, which they did on the night of Sedan Day, shocking the public. On September 3, two aviators of Gallieni’s army spotted German columns moving eastward, prompting General Clergerie and Colonel Giraudon to shout: “They offer us their flank!”

====Ch. 22 – &quot;Gentlemen, We Will Fight on the Marne&quot;====
Due to communications issues between Kluck’s army and Luxembourg, OHL realized only on September 4 that Kluck had crossed the Marne, thus disobeying their orders of September 2. Kluck’s push reflected the confidence of German officers in their imminent entry into Paris, except for Moltke, who, puzzled by the absence of the usual signs of victory, believed the French were not defeated but retreating to prepare a counteroffensive. Recognizing the vulnerability of Kluck&#x27;s left flank, which was advancing southeast with an exhausted army and delayed supplies, Moltke considered at last pulling reinforcements from his left wing. He proposed the move to Rupprecht but the Kaiser balked at the idea of weakening the army that could take Nancy. Moltke backed down and ended the day signing the order that would halt Germany&#x27;s right wing.

Meanwhile, the French Army was turning a corner. Although it continued retreating, Joffre was preparing for the day after. On September 3, he relieved Lanrezac, whom he found depressed, ineffective in collaborating with John French, and prone to criticizing his orders and appointed Franchet d&#x27;Esperey to command the 5th Army. On September 4, following a day of solitary reflection, Joffre decided at 6 PM that France would attack on September 7 with the armed forces of Franchet d’Esperey, Foch, Gallieni and French. However these last two upset his plan. Gallieni had already sent preliminary orders to Maunoury to prepare to march on September 4 and thus forced Joffre’s hand to advance the attack to September 6 as he was afraid Maunoury’s move would disclose the whole offensive to the Germans. Joffre was also assuming the BEF would join the offensive but was stunned to learn, after he had issued his order at 8:30 P.M., that John French had decided to wait and see.

Kluck continued disregarding Moltke’s order to retreat and crossed the Grand Morin on September 5. He yielded only after Moltke presented him with evidence that the French were preparing to attack his flank. By then, it was too late. On the Allied side, Joffre motored three hours to the BEF&#x27;s HQ at Melun, where he urged John French to join the counter-offensive. With tears in his eyes, French agreed to &quot;do all we possibly can.&quot; Back at GQG, Joffre ended the day declaring to his assembled officers: &quot;Gentlemen, we will fight on the Marne.&quot;

===Afterword===
After Maunoury provoked Kluck’s turnabout, a gap opened in the German lines which the Allies failed to exploit as the BEF moved in too slowly and the German Army retreated in time to avoid a piercing. Germany’s much sought after decisive victory was eluding. Moltke and von Kluck attributed this failure to the unexpected power of the French &quot;élan&quot; and this “extraordinary and peculiar aptitude of the French soldier to recover quickly, [...] a possibility not studied in our war academy.&quot; Beside the morale of the French soldier, six strategic and tactical errors contributed to Germany stalling:
# two corps were taken out of the Western front and sent East
# for too long, the German Armies tried enveloping the French First and Second armies by their left wing
# Kluck outrun its supplies and exhausted its men
# did not stay level with Bülow
# and marched back on the Marne instead of forward on the Grand Morin;
# finally and most importantly, by scheduling a six-week march towards France through Belgium, Germany precipitated three troubles on itself: it had to leave some of its forces behind to fight in Belgium, Britain entered the war with its five divisions and the world opinion turned against it.
These errors alone gave the Allies a numerical superiority, a first since the Battle of the Frontiers. Further, the French generals rose to the challenge: Joffre’s “impregnable confidence” held the French Armies together during the 12-day retreat, Gallieni seized on the opportunity to counterattack and Clergerie organized 600 taxis to transport 6,000 troops to the front line. And yet, this “Miracle of the Marne” did not deliver France a victory either.

The stalemate that ensued &quot;suck[ed] up lives at a rate of 5,000 and sometimes 50,000 a day&quot;. In August 1914 alone, France lost 300,000 of its 1.6 million-soldier army. &quot;The deadlock, fixed by the failures of the first month, determined the future course of the war and, as a result, the terms of the peace, the shape of the interwar period, and the conditions of the Second Round.&quot; &quot;The Battle of the Marne was one of the decisive battles of the world not because it determined that Germany would ultimately lose or that the Allies ultimately win the war but because it determined that the war would go on. [...] There was no turning back. The nations were caught in a trap, a trap made during the first thirty days out of battles that failed to be decisive, a trap from which there was, and has been, no exit.&quot;

==Style / Genre==
Robert K. Massie, author of the 1994 foreword to the book, attributes its &quot;enormous reputation&quot; to four qualities: &quot;a wealth of vivid detail which keeps the reader immersed in events almost as an eyewitness; a prose style which is transparently clear, intelligent, controlled and witty; a cool detachment of moral judgement – Mrs. Tuchman is never preachy or reproachful: she draws on skepticism, not cynicism, leaving the reader not so much outraged by human villainy as amused and saddened by human folly. These first three qualities are present in all of Barbara Tuchman&#x27;s work, but in &quot;The Guns of August&quot;, there is a fourth, which makes the book, once taken up, almost impossible to set aside. Remarkably, she persuades the reader to suspend any foreknowledge of what is about to happen[;] so great is Mrs. Tuchman&#x27;s skill that the reader forgets what he knows. [...] Mrs. Tuchman&#x27;s triumph is that she makes the events of August 1914 as suspenseful on the page as they were to the people living through them.&quot;

Tuchman knows to find and express &quot;the vivid specific fact which would imprint on the reader&#x27;s mind the essential nature of the man or event.&quot; Some examples follow.

===Key players===
Tuchman references almost four hundred actors in &quot;The Guns of August&quot;, General Joffre being cited the most on 125 different pages. Thirty of them receive a development of their characteristics or background.

The four excerpts below illustrate Robert K. Massie&#x27;s remark that Tuchman can &quot;imprint the essential natural of the man&quot;:
* Joseph Joffre was &quot;massive and paunchy in his baggy uniform, with a fleshy face adorned by a heavy, nearly white mustache and bushy eyebrows to match with a clear youthful skin, clam blue eyes and a candid, tranquil gaze, Joffre looked like Santa Claus and gave an impression of benevolence and naïveté – two qualities not noticeably part of his character.&quot; &quot;Joffre&#x27;s supreme confidence in himself was expressed [in 1912] when his aide, Major Alexandre, asked him if he thought war was shortly to be expected. &quot;Certainly I think so,&quot; Joffre replied. &quot;I have always thought so. It will come. I shall fight and I shall win. I have always succeeded in what I do – as in the Sudan. It will be that way again.&quot; &quot;It will mean a Marshal&#x27;s baton for you,&quot; his aide suggested with some awe at the vision. &quot;Yes.&quot; Joffre acknowledged the prospect with laconic equanimity.&quot;
* &quot;The short, stocky and florid Sir John French, about to take command in the field, was keyed to a pitch of valour and combativeness. His normally apoplectic expression, combined with the tight cavalryman&#x27;s stock which he affected in place of collar and tie, gave him an appearance of being perpetually on the verge of choking, as indeed he often was emotionally if not physically.&quot;
* Vladimir Sukhomlinov was &quot;artful, indolent, pleasure-loving, chubby [...] with an almost feline manner, who, smitten by the twenty-three year old wife of a provincial governor, contrived to get rid of the husband by divorce on framed evidence and marry the beautiful residue as his fourth wife.&quot;
* &quot;Tall, heavy, bald and sixty-six years old, Moltke habitually wore an expression of profound distress, which led the Kaiser to call him &quot;der traurige Julius&quot; (for what might be rendered &quot;Gloomy Gus&quot;; in fact, his name was Helmuth). Poor health, for which he took an annual cure at Karlsbad, and the shadow of a great uncle were perhaps cause for gloom.&quot;
Aside these four men, Tuchman characterises or gives the background of twenty-seven actors:
* France: Joseph Gallieni, Louis Franchet d&#x27;Espèrey, Augustin Dubail, Adolphe Messimy, Raymond Poincaré, Noël de Castelnau, Michel-Joseph Maunoury and Fernand de Langle de Cary;
* Germany: Eric Ludendorff, Alfred von Schlieffen (&quot;of the two classes of Prussian officer, the bullnecked and the wasp-waisted, he belonged to the second&quot;), Max Hoffmann, Friedrich von Bernhardi, Alexander von Kluck, Crown Prince Rupprecht, Crown Prince Wilhelm, Paul von Hindenburg, Maximilian von Prittwitz and Hermann von François;
* Britain: Jackie Fisher, Sir Edward Grey, Sir Henry Wilson and Ernest Troubridge;
* Russia: Grand Duke Nicholas, Nicholas II and Alexander Samsonov;
* Belgium: King Albert.
It is worth noting those actors Tuchman cites often but does not characterise, if only with a few well chosen words:
* France: Ferdinand Foch, Charles Lanrezac
* Germany: Kaiser Wilhelm II (&quot;possessor of the least inhibited tongue in Europe&quot;), Theobald von Bethmann Hollweg, Max von Hausen, Karl von Bülow, Wilhelm Souchon
* Britain: Winston Churchill, Kitchener, H. H. Asquith, Richard Haldane, Archibald Murray.

===Key events===
The introductory paragraph of &quot;A funeral&quot;, the first chapter of &quot;The Guns of August&quot;, took Barbara Tuchman &quot;eight hours to complete and became the most famous passage in all her work&quot;. The Canadian historian Margaret MacMillan &quot;was gripped from her wonderful first sentence&quot;:

One of the key events took place on August 1. &quot;In Berlin just after five o&#x27;clock a telephone rang in the Foreign Office. [...] &quot;Moltke wants to know whether things can start.&quot; At that moment, [...] a telegram, from Prince Lichnowsky, ambassador in London, reported an English offer, as Lichnowsky understood it, &quot;that in case we did not attack France, England would remain neutral and would guarantee France&#x27;s neutrality.&quot; [...] The Kaiser clutched at Lichnowsky&#x27;s passport to a one-front war. Minutes counted. Already mobilization was rolling inexorably toward the French frontier. The first hostile act [...] was scheduled within an hour. It must be stopped, stopped at once. But how? Where was Moltke? Moltke had left the palace. An aide was sent off with siren screaming, to intercept him. He was brought back. The Kaiser was himself again, the All-Highest, the War Lord, blazing with a new idea, planning, proposing, disposing. He read Moltke the telegram and said in a triumph: &quot;Now we can go to war against Russia only. We simply march the whole of our Army to the East!&quot; Aghast at the thought of his marvelous machinery of mobilization wrenched into reverse, Moltke refused point-blank. For the past ten years, first as assistant to Schlieffen, then as his successor, Moltke&#x27;s job had been planning for this day. The Day, &quot;Der Tag&quot;, for which all Germany&#x27;s energies were gathered, on which the march to final mastery of Europe would begin. It weighed upon him with an oppressive, almost unbearable responsibility.
[...] &quot;Your Majesty,&quot; Moltke told him now, &quot;it cannot be done. The deployment of millions cannot be improvised. [...] Those arrangements took a whole year of intricate labor to complete&quot; – and Moltke closed upon that rigid phrase, the basis for every major German mistake, the phrase that launched the invasion of Belgium and the submarine war against the United States, the inevitable phrase when military plans dictate policy – &quot;and once settled it cannot be altered.&quot;

==Analysis==
===Miscalculations leading to war===
Throughout the aforementioned narrative, Tuchman constantly brings up a theme: the numerous misconceptions, miscalculations, and mistakes that she believed resulted in the tragedy of trench warfare, such as:
* Economic miscalculation: Tuchman says both European intellectuals and leaders overestimated the power of free trade. They believed that the interconnectedness of European nations through trade would stop a continent-wide war from breaking out, as the economic consequences would be too great. However, the assumption was incorrect. For example, Tuchman noted that Moltke, when warned of such consequences, refused to even consider them in his plans, arguing he was a &quot;soldier,&quot; not an &quot;economist.&quot;
* Unfounded belief in quick warfare: except for a very few politicians (who were at the time ridiculed and excluded because of their views, with only Lord Kitchener having the authority to act on his anticipation of a long war), all the leaders of the major combatants believed the war would be concluded in a matter of weeks, certainly by the end of 1914. Tuchman recounted the story of a British statesman who, after he warned others that the war might last two or three years, was branded a &quot;pessimist.&quot; That false assumption had disastrous effects, especially on logistics (see below).
* Over-reliance on morale and the offensive: Tuchman details, in depth, how the leaders of the major powers, before the war, developed a philosophy of warfare based almost entirely on morale, a constant offensive, and retaining the initiative. Joffre, in particular, refused to consider going on the defensive/or even to slow the offensive, even when the realities of the battlefield demonstrated that his approach was not working.
* Failure to consider political backlash: many war planners did not take into consideration the political and treaty-based consequences of their offensive actions. As Tuchman argues, the German leaders in particular refused to consider the consequences of moving their armies into Belgium despite that country&#x27;s neutrality. Despite Moltke&#x27;s concerns, German generals insisted on moving through Belgium because they needed to maneuver. They failed (or refused) to realize that by invading Belgium, they effectively forced Britain to declare war because of existing treaties and national honor.
* Failure to consider adverse societal moral effects: this war as many others produced its fair amount of individual vanity and insubordination. However, the German political leaders failed to consider that some military acts can have a wider moral repercussion, which in turn can translate adversely on the military front; this is clear from the sack of Louvain, which led to public outrage and contributed to the US entering the war.
* Outdated forms of wartime etiquette: although the technology, aims, methods, and plans of World War I were significantly different from earlier wars, military leaders in occupied territories continued to have an expectation of a form of martial etiquette from civilians, regarding co-operation and obedience of instructions, as a reciprocal part of non-combatant status; which increased resentment between the citizens of the opposing nations. To illustrate, Tuchman repeatedly uses quotes from the diaries of German generals who commandeered the homes and supplies of civilians. One recurrent theme in their diary entries was that they simply could not understand why the property owners refused full co-operation, in line with traditional wartime courtesy. In a somewhat comical passage, Tuchman even quotes from a general who criticized the master of a Belgian house for failing to sit with him at dinner and observe proper mealtime etiquette despite the fact that the Germans had violated his country&#x27;s neutrality, taken over his house, and stolen or destroyed much of his property. Similar problems occurred in the practical application of submarine, and later aerial, warfare.

Overall, Tuchman argues that while some of the war&#x27;s major combatants looked forward to a war, specifically Germany and Austria-Hungary, all of them expected it to be a short one, and none of them desired or anticipated a prolonged war. Likewise, she argues that even successes, such as the First Battle of the Marne, a French victory, were to some extent accidental victories that were won despite, and not because of, military leadership or strategy.

==Development==
The Guns of August is Tuchman&#x27;s third book, after Bible and Sword, published in 1956, and the Zimmermann Telegram, in 1958, and by her own account &quot;the genesis of this book lies in [these] two earlier books I wrote, of which the First World War was the focal point of both. […] I had always thought that 1914 was the hour when the clock struck, so to speak, the date that ended the nineteenth century and began our own age, &quot;the Terrible Twentieth&quot; as Churchill called it. I felt that 1914 was it. But I did not know what should be the gateway or the framework.&quot; She was approached by Cecil Scott of MacMillan who asked her to write a book on 1914, particularly on the battle of Mons and on &quot;how had the BEF thrown back the Germans [and whether] they [had] really seen the vision of an angel over the battlefield.&quot; But Tuchman was more interested in writing a book on the escape of the German cruiser Goeben from Royal Navy&#x27;s Gloucester, an event that would precipitate the Ottoman Empire into the war and for which she had personal affinity since she was present, although aged only two, with her parents on a small steamer from which they witnessed this naval pursuit. But Mr Scott was not interested in that episode. In the end, &quot;I formed the plan of keeping to the war&#x27;s first month, which contained all the roots, including the Goeben and Battle of Mons, to make us both happy.&quot;

Tuchman had a personal connection to the Goeben episode since she was present, as a child aged two, on a small boat nearby the pursuit: &quot;That morning [August 10, 1914] there arrived in Constantinople the small Italian passenger steamer which had witnessed the &quot;Gloucester&quot;&#x27;s action against &quot;Goeben&quot; and &quot;Breslau&quot;. Among its passengers were the daughter, son-in-law and three grandchildren of the American ambassador Mr. Henry Morgenthau.&quot; Being the grandchild of Henry Morgenthau, she is referring to herself as she confirmed in 1981 in her book &quot;Practicing History&quot;, in which she tells the story of her father, Maurice Wertheim, who was traveling from Constantinople to Jerusalem on August 29, 1914, to deliver funds to the Jewish community there. This connection, and her initial desire to write a book on the episode, might explain why two academic reviewers found this chapter &quot;long and somewhat awkward&quot; and &quot;out of context&quot;.

Tuchman creates by combining the standard method of academic history, which is to read authentic, original material with activities more readily associated with journalism, such as field trips. Thus, to write the Guns of August, she read &quot;letters, telegrams, diaries, memoirs, cabinet documents, battle orders, secret codes, and billets-doux [found in] the New York Public Library, the Library of Congress, the National Archives, the British Library and Public Record Office, the Bibliothèque Nationale, the Sterling Library at Yale and the Widener Library at Harvard, [and] rented a small Renault and toured the battlefield of Belgium and France .&quot;

==Reception==
In 1988, in her preface to the twenty-sixth anniversary of the book&#x27;s second edition, Tuchman recounts how positive the reviews were when the book was published in 1962. Since she was &quot;hardly known to the critics […] with no reputation for them to enjoy smashing, the book received instead the warmest reception.&quot; One review in particular brought her to tears because it &quot;elicit[ed] perfect comprehension&quot;: Clifton Fadiman&#x27;s critic in the Book-of-the-Month Club Bulletin. He wrote that The Guns of August had &quot;a fair chance [to] turn to be a historical classic&quot; by displaying &quot;almost Thucydidean virtues: intelligence, concision, weight, detachment. […] It is [Tuchman&#x27;s] conviction that the deadlock of the terrible month of August determined the future course of the war and the terms of the peace, the shape of the inter-war period and the conditions of the Second Round. […] [O]ne of the marks of the superior historian is the ability to project human beings as well as events.&quot;
In 1962, Publishers Weekly predicted the book &quot;will be the biggest new nonfiction seller in your winter season&quot;, which greatly surprised Tuchman but &quot;as it turned out, they were right.&quot;

Indeed, all reviewers have praised her narrative style, even the academic historians who have raised a few pointed critiques to The Guns of August because Tuchman had erected a rigid, deterministic thesis by relying too heavily on sources that corroborated it, ignoring, misrepresenting or downplaying factors that undermined it and veiling it with an anti-German veneer, which could be partially explained by the context of her writing as 1962 was probably the height of the Cold War.

===A unanimous praise of Tuchman&#x27;s narrative style===

The academic reviews of The Guns of August were published in two waves: for the first edition in 1962–63, and in 2013–14 on the hundredth anniversary of the start of the war and the associated 2014 re-edition of the book. Over these fifty years, Tuchman&#x27;s narrative style has been constantly praised:
* In 1962, the American historian Harold J. Gordon points out half a dozen major flaws but imparts in closing that Tuchman &quot;brings together materials from a great many sources and binds them skilfully into a clear and understandable account.&quot; Fellow Samuel J. Hurwitz lauds her for writing &quot;imaginatively, vividly, and even passionately, [with] a talent for making scenes of the past come alive, and the result is perhaps even larger than life.&quot; Professor John W. Oliver praises her ability to put the &quot;reader [in] a box seat as he watches the opening drama.&quot; In 1963, Ulrich Trumpener, Professor at the University of Alberta, despite writing a very critical review of her book, notes that &quot;in terms of sheer narrative power, The Guns of August is an admirable work.&quot;
* The American historian Samuel R. Williamson Jr. starts his 2013 critical review by praising &quot;her narrative style [which] gives the reader a sense of intimacy with the events&quot; and closes it by quoting Harvard Professor Sidney Fay&#x27;s: &quot;she had got the history wrong, but historians need to write like Tuchman or we will be out of business.&quot; In 2014, the Canadian historian Margaret MacMillan, Professor of International History at the University of Oxford, &quot;was gripped from her wonderful first sentence. &quot;So gorgeous was the spectacle on the May morning of 1910 when nine kings rode in the funeral of Edward VII of England that the crowd, waiting in hushed and black-clad awe, could not keep back gasps of admiration.&quot; She adds further &quot;When I first read Barbara Tuchman&#x27;s The Guns of August in the autumn of 1963 it was as though history went from black and white to Technicolor&quot;, Tuchman has this &quot;ability to bring the past to life, in part using what she called the corroborative detail&quot; and is a &quot;wonderful storyteller&quot;; lastly MacMillan loves her &quot;acerbic wit&quot; and &quot;sharp character sketches.&quot;

===A deterministic thesis erected on biased views framed by the Cold War===

The determinism of Tuchman&#x27;s thesis has been best expressed by two academic historians fifty years apart. In 1962, Professor Oron J. Hale of the University of Virginia was concerned by how Tuchman connects in a deterministic manner events that are several years, even several decades apart. He provides two such examples:
* &quot;The naval side is inadequate [with] a chapter [out of context] on the British navy&#x27;s hunt for the German cruisers Goeben and Breslau in the Mediterranean and their escape to Constantinople. In a dubious chain of causation we are told that the Russian declaration of war on Turkey, in November, followed by Gallipoli, Suez, Palestine, the breakup of the Ottoman Empire, and &quot;the subsequent history of the Middle East, followed from the voyage of the Goeben.&quot;
* He concludes his review by noting that Tuchman&#x27;s &quot;thesis that the failure of Plan 17 and the Schlieffen Plan, which produced stalemate in the West, was the mold that determined the future course of the war, the conditions of peace and of the inter-war period, as well as the &quot;Second Round,&quot; is much too deterministic. The First World War – indeed all major wars – had many turning points. The year 1917, which brought Russian withdrawal and United States entry, was more decisive for the military outcome and the nature of the peace than was 1914.&quot;

In 2014, Margaret MacMillan, who was greatly influenced by the book, ends her positive review on a similar note: &quot;her main argument that entangling alliances and rigid military timetables caught Europe in a grip that led the powers inexorably towards catastrophe is no longer accepted by most historians.&quot;

This determinism is the result of four biases: i) the sources and historical research Tuchman relies upon, ii) the events she decided to exclude from her book, iii) the factors that she downplayed as they were weakening the strength of her thesis and iv) the bias she had against Germans, which is partially explained by v) the timing of the book, written in 1962 at the height of the Cold War.

===Ignoring historical sources and research, and relying solely on key actors&#x27; memories===

Tuchman has ignored the major works on the origins of the war written by Sidney Fay, Luigi Albertini, Pierre Renouvin, Bernadotte Schmitt, George Gooch and William Langer. As Professor Gordon notes: &quot;Forty years of historical research are ignored as the hundreds of thousands of documents that have been published by the governments of Europe.&quot; He is echoed by Professor Trumpener: &quot;A wider utilization of primary sources would have been desirable. For example, neither the Russian and Italian document collection published since 1918 nor the captured German government files, a valuable new source, seem to have been consulted.&quot; Instead, as Professor Hale concludes, she relied on &quot;controversial sources, which in many instances are not evaluated critically, [i.e. the retrospective works by statesmen and soldiers] rather than upon the solid general staff operational histories of the respective military establishments.&quot;

===Misrepresenting key military events===

There is a noticeable disbalance between the minimal treatment, when mentioned at all, of the key diplomatic and military events that took place in the Balkans and on the Austro-Russian fronts on one side, and the over-emphasis of the naval chases in the Mediterranean on the other. When it comes to the first Tuchman has disregarded in particular three developments: 
* The Galician front – Although Tuchman recognizes that omitting the Austro-Hungarian / Serbian / Russian front was &quot;not entirely arbitrary&quot; and resulted from her decisions to strictly confine the book to August 1914, preserve &quot;unity&quot; and avoid &quot;tiresome length&quot;, a few historians deplored these choices. For Professor Williamson, this &quot;seems unforgivable [for] there would have been no war in the West if the Russians had not decided [...] to intervene in the war on behalf of Serbia and thus attack the Habsburg monarchy.&quot; Professor Hale challenges Tuchman on the rigidity of her time frame: &quot;[d]uring the first week of September, concurrently with the battle of the Marne, massive Russian-Austrian engagements were fought in Galicia, with results as decisive and casualties equal to those of the campaigns in France or East Prussia. All this is excluded with consequent distortion.&quot; Professor Trumpener even wonders whether it is &quot;not obscuring some crucial issues to treat the opening Austro-Hungarian campaigns against Serbs and Russians [...] as mere side shows.&quot; 
* The Austrian war plan – As a direct consequence of voluntarily ignoring the Galician front &quot;[t]he Austrian war plan is entirely ignored and the Russian merely touched upon.&quot; 
* The outbreak of the war – Oron J. Hale was &quot;disturbed [by] the fragmented treatment of the outbreak of war. [...] The war originated in the Balkans [...] and from a local crisis grew into a general European war through the reckless diplomatic and military actions of Austrian and Russian authorities.&quot; 

On the other hand, the chapter 10 dedicated to the Gloucester&#x27;s chase of the Goeben and the Breslau in the Mediterranean is &quot;long and somewhat awkward&quot;, &quot;inadequate&quot;, &quot;out of context&quot; and contains &quot;numerous inaccuracies and over-simplifications.&quot; 

===Downplaying key factors===

Professor Gordon points out that Tuchman&#x27;s excessive focus on Germans&#x27; villainy led her to pay &quot;[l]ittle more than passing mention, if that, [..] to universally operating forces as nationalism, imperialism, trade rivalries, and militarism, in creating a situation where war was an increasingly acceptable solution for the problems of Europe.&quot; Professor Williamson adds: &quot;Issues of civil-military relations, alliance structures, and the coordination of military planning receive Tuchman&#x27;s modest attention at most. The role of the public opinion is only fleetingly mentioned, and economic preparation for war, though noted, gets nothing more.&quot; 

===An anti-German bias===

For Professor Trumpener, Tuchman&#x27;s &quot;treatment of Imperial Germany is blatantly one-sided.&quot; She &quot;[transforms] the Germans of 1914 into a nation of barbarians [...] invariably unpleasant, hysterical, or outright brutish&quot;. Their &quot;[a]rmies [march] like &quot;predatory ants&quot; across Belgium, soon reveal &quot;the beast beneath the German skin&quot;. The Germans [...] prefer &quot;fearful models&quot; [...] when they invade their neighbors. Suffice is to add that one of the German generals, Alexander von Kluck, duly emerges as a &quot;grim-visaged Attila&quot; and that that Prussian officer corps is, in any case, composed exclusively of &quot;bullnecked&quot; or &quot;wasp-waisted&quot; types.&quot; 

Professor Gordon echoes Trumpener&#x27;s assessment: &quot;The impression given is that the war was half the result of the fecklessness of the Kaiser and half the result of the unbelievably vicious character of the German people, who forced the war upon an innocent and peace-loving civilized world. [...] Mrs Tuchman&#x27;s hostility to all things German also seems to have led her to ignore such crucial developments as the Russian agreement not to mobilize against Germany and its violation.&quot; 

Benefitting from fifty years of hindsight, Professor MacMillan is less stringent in her criticism of Tuchman&#x27;s negative preconceived opinion of Germans, merely stating that &quot;[s]he is prone at times to absurd overstatements, for example that the German people were gripped by the idea that divine providence had destined them to be masters of the universe.&quot; 

===The context of the Cold War===

Professor MacMillan continues explaining Tuchman&#x27;s anti-German bias as a consequence of &quot;[h]er view that the Germans somehow wanted to impose their culture on the world [which] is surely a reflection of that great ideological struggle of her own time between the west and the Soviet bloc.&quot; Indeed, as professor Williamson, concurs: &quot;By 1962 America&#x27;s strategic position had been significantly altered. The Soviet arsenal of nuclear missiles made the possibility of war increasingly likely. [...] Later in 1962, the Cuban crisis showed just how dangerous the chances of war might be. Not surprisingly leaders, writers and commentators looked back to 1914 to analyze what had gone wrong. [...] The American public firmly believed that the Germans were solely responsible for the Great War [...] a view of course reaffirmed by German behavior in the Second World War. &quot; 

==Publication==
The first edition was published by MacMillan the last week of January 1962 and it stayed on the best seller list for more than forty weeks. A second edition came out in 1988, for the seventieth anniversary of the armistice, with the author&#x27;s preface. In 1994, a third edition was published for the eightieth anniversary of the start of the war; Robert K. Massie wrote the foreword; it was published in the US by Random House and in Great Britain by Penguin Books.

By April 2024, &quot;The Guns of August&quot; has been translated in (at least) 19 languages: Bulgarian, Chinese, Czech, Dutch, Estonian, Finnish, French, German, Hebrew, Italian, Japanese, Persian, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Russian, Spanish, Swedish and Turkish.

==Legacy==

===Cultural impact===
The book was an immediate bestseller and was on the bestseller list of &quot;The New York Times&quot; for 42 consecutive weeks. The Pulitzer Prize nomination committee was unable to award it the prize for outstanding history because Joseph Pulitzer&#x27;s will specifically stated that the recipient of the Pulitzer Prize for History must be a book on American history. Instead, Tuchman was given the prize for general nonfiction.

According to the cover notes of an audio version of &quot;The Guns of August&quot;, &quot;[President John F. Kennedy] was so impressed by the book, he gave copies to his cabinet and principal military advisers, and commanded them to read it.&quot; In his book &quot;One Minute to Midnight&quot; about the Cuban Missile Crisis, Michael Dobbs notes the deep impression &quot;Guns&quot; had on Kennedy. He often quoted from it and wanted &quot;every officer in the Army&quot; to read it as well. Subsequently, &quot;[t]he secretary of the Army sent copies to every U.S. military base in the world. Kennedy drew from &quot;The Guns of August&quot; to help in dealing with the crisis in Cuba, including the profound and unpredictable implications a rapid escalation of the situation could have. Robert S. McNamara, United States Secretary of Defense during Kennedy&#x27;s presidency, recalled that &quot;[e]arly in his administration, President Kennedy asked his cabinet officials and members of the National Security Council&quot; to read &quot;The Guns of August&quot;. McNamara related that Kennedy said &quot;The Guns of August&quot; graphically portrayed how Europe&#x27;s leaders had bungled into the debacle of World War I, and that Kennedy told later his cabinet officials that &quot;We are not going to bungle into war.&quot;

The British Prime Minister Harold Macmillan, who had served on the Western Front during the First World War, was also profoundly affected by the book. In his diary for Monday, 22 October 1962, he wrote:

Graham Allison, a political scientist who covered the Cuban Missile Crisis in &quot;Essence of Decision&quot;, noted the effect of Tuchman&#x27;s book on Kennedy, but also its implications for the proper study of decision-making and warfare. Allison created an entire model of decision-making, which he called the Organizational Process Model, based on such issues as those covered by Tuchman, a model that directly countered game theory and other rationalistic means of explaining events.

===Film adaptation===
The book was the basis for a 1964 documentary film, also titled &quot;The Guns of August&quot;. The 99-minute film, which premiered in New York City on December 24, 1964, was produced and directed by Nathan Kroll and narrated by Fritz Weaver, with the narration written by Arthur B. Tourtellot. It used film footage found in government archives in Paris, London, Brussels, Berlin, and Washington, DC.

<text>The Heckler &amp; Koch G36 (Gewehr 36) is an assault rifle designed in the early 1990s by German weapons manufacturer Heckler &amp; Koch. It is chambered in 5.56×45mm NATO, and replaced the heavier G3 battle rifle chambered in 7.62×51mm. The G36 was accepted into service with the in 1997. Since then, it has been a popular export, and has seen active service in military and police units in several countries, including Germany, Spain, and the United Kingdom. The G36 is gas-operated and feeds from a 30-round detachable box magazine or 100-round C-Mag drum magazine.

In 2012, the G36 was found to suffer from significant accuracy issues due to thermal expansion of the barrel, prompting a search for a replacement. In 2017, the launched the &quot;System Sturmgewehr Bundeswehr&quot;, a program designed to field a replacement for the G36. The weapons put forth were the Heckler &amp; Koch HK416, Heckler &amp; Koch HK433, and the Haenel MK 556. The G95A1 and G95KA1, both variants of the HK416, were selected in 2022.

==History==
===Development===
In the 1970s, arms manufacturers in Germany began work on a successor for the G3 rifle, resulting in the creation of the 4.73 mm G11 assault rifle (developed jointly by a group of companies led by Heckler &amp; Koch) that used caseless ammunition (designed by Dynamit Nobel). This weapon was intended to replace the G3, therefore further development of Heckler &amp; Koch&#x27;s series of firearms chambered for the 5.56×45mm NATO cartridge had been halted. Heckler &amp; Koch, having no incentive to pursue a new 5.56 mm weapon system, was content with the export-oriented HK33 and G41 rifles. However, the G11 program came to an abrupt end when the cancelled its procurement due to defence budget cuts resulting from the unification of East and West Germany, and Heckler &amp; Koch&#x27;s 1991 acquisition by British Aerospace&#x27;s Royal Ordnance division (known today as BAE Systems).

Increasing demand for a modern service rifle chambered in the NATO-standard 5.56 mm cartridge led Heckler &amp; Koch to offer the German armed forces the G41 rifle, which, too, was rejected. Design work was initiated on a completely novel, modern 5.56 mm assault rifle; it would later be designated &quot;Project 50&quot; or &quot;HK50&quot;. During testing, prototypes were rated higher than the Austrian competition (the Steyr AUG system). The final version of the G36 was completed in 1995, and production began in 1996. The G36C was first adopted as the standard-issue rifle of US special forces unit TF23.

===Production===
The HK50 rifle was selected for service and an initial order was placed for 33,000 rifles under the designation &quot;Gewehr&quot; G36. The order included an option for a further 17,000 rifles. Deliveries were first made to the ″s NATO Quick Reaction Force during quarter four of 1997. The G36&#x27;s production line was started in early 1996.

In July 1998, it was announced that the G36 had been selected as the service rifle for the Spanish Armed Forces, replacing the Spanish-designed 5.56 mm CETME Model L and LC rifles. Deliveries started at the end of 1999. From 1999 to 2005, 75,219 rifles were manufactured in Spain under license by General Dynamics&#x27; Santa Bárbara Sistemas at the Fábrica de Armas de La Coruña (FACOR) facility in Coruña, Galicia.

The rifle has been licensed for local production in Saudi Arabia by the Military Industries Corporation (MIC). Technology transfer was granted by Germany to Saudi Arabia on 30 June 2008. The first Saudi-made G36 was produced at MIC&#x27;s factory on 30 June 2009. However, some components of their own G36s are supplied by Heckler &amp; Koch.

=== Replacement ===
In April 2012, reports surfaced that G36 rifles used in Afghanistan would overheat during prolonged firefights after several hundred rounds were fired. Overheating affected the accuracy of the G36, making it difficult to hit targets past 100 metres, ineffective past 200 metres, and incapable of effective fire past 300 metres. The G36 has been called unsuitable for long battles. Operational commanders advised allowing the weapon to cool between periods of rapid shooting.

In February 2014, the German Federal Ministry of Defence announced that the overheating deficiencies of the G36 were not a result of weapon design, but of the ammunition. A report by the on 21 February 2014 revealed that the issues were not the fault of the rifle, but that one manufacturer of ammunition was making bullets with copper-plated jackets that were too thin. The manufacturer of the ammunition confirmed this, although experts disagreed, and also said the accuracy problems were already known to the defence ministry by 2010.

On 22 June 2014, it was reported that Germany&#x27;s defense ministry had temporarily halted new orders worth €34 million ($ million) over accuracy concerns for the rifle. The consulted the Fraunhofer Institute for High-Speed Dynamics (Ernst Mach Institut) and the Federal Criminal Police Office. On 30 March 2015, Minister of Defence Ursula von der Leyen told Associated Press that the weight-saving design was the root of the issues. This was based on a letter from Inspector General Volker Wieker advising the Stewards of Defence and Budget Committee of the Bundestag and the troops in advance of publication of the report. The report was released by the Fraunhofer Ernst Mach Institut and Wehrtechnische Dienststelle 91 on 19 April 2015. According to their 372-page report, the observed hit rate of the predominantly plastic weapon with the unsupported free-floating barrel drops down to a mere 7% at 100 metres when the temperature increases by or more, whereas the required a hit rate of 90% at that distance.

On 22 April 2015, von der Leyen announced that the G36 would be phased out of the German army due to these concerns and stated that &quot;The Heckler &amp; Koch G36 has no future in the German army in its current state of construction.&quot; Von der Leyen considered the weapon to be useless and stated that the German military would stop using an assault rifle that could not shoot straight when temperatures increased or the rifle heated up during a firefight.

In 2016, the Ministry of Defence attempted to sue Heckler &amp; Koch, saying they were legally obligated to repair the subpar G36 rifles. Because the did not make its specifications for the weapon clear enough in the beginning of the procurement process, the District Court of Koblenz rejected claims from the procurement office, and ruled that Heckler &amp; Koch did not have to pay damages on the 167,000 rifles still in use out of more than 176,000 G36 rifles Germany had originally purchased.

The began the &quot;System Sturmgewehr Bundeswehr&quot; (Bundeswehr Assault Rifle System) effort to replace the G36 in 2017. Initially, C.G. Haenel won the competition in September 2020 offering their Haenel MK 556. However, German authorities cancelled the contract the next month amid allegations that the MK 556 infringed on Heckler and Koch patents, and the G95A1 (known as the HK416 A8 during field testing) was selected in early 2021. Haenel sued to attempt to reverse the decision, but a German court dismissed the lawsuit in June 2022. In December 2022, the Bundestag approved initial funding to begin procuring the rifles. The expected to purchase 118,718 rifles, designated G95A1 (with a barrel) and G95KA1 (with a shorter barrel). Fielding is planned to start in 2024.

==Design details==
The G36 is chambered in 5.56×45mm NATO and fires from a closed rotary bolt. The rifle body has a conventional layout and a modular component design. While modifications can vary, all G36 variants share an identical receiver, buttstock assembly, bolt carrier group, return mechanism, and guide rod. The receiver contains the barrel, carry handle with integrated sights, trigger group with pistol grip, handguard and magazine socket.

The G36 employs a free-floating barrel, meaning the barrel does not make contact with the handguard. The barrel is fastened to the receiver with a special nut, which can be removed with a wrench. The barrel is forged using a cold hammer process. It features a chrome-lined bore with 6 right-hand grooves and a 1 in 178 mm (1:7 in) rifling twist rate. The barrel features a collar and lug permitting attachment of a bayonet; it can also be used to attach rifle grenades and a flash suppressor.

===Features===
====Fire selector====
The fire and safety selector is ambidextrous and has controls on both sides of the receiver; this feature is inherited from the design of the original G3. Selector settings are described with letters: &quot;S&quot;—safe (&quot;Sicher&quot;), &quot;E&quot;—semi-automatic fire (&quot;Einzelfeuer&quot;) and &quot;F&quot;—automatic fire (&quot;Feuerstoß&quot;). The three-position fire selector has a 0°/45°/90° rotation pattern between the settings. HK offers several other trigger options, including the &quot;Navy&quot; trigger group with illustrated pictograms for each setting. An exclusively semi-automatic trigger is also available.

====Magazine====
The G36 uses a proprietary 30-round magazine moulded with translucent shock-resistant plastic. The sides have interlocking studs that allow the magazines to be attached jungle-style.

An empty G36 magazine weighs , while a fully loaded magazine weighs .

While STANAG magazines are not normally compatible with the G36, adapters and modifications exist that enable cross-compatibility. Certain types of Beta C-Mags, which hold 100 rounds, can also be used with the stock G36, and are employed by the MG36 variant.

====Stock====
The G36 features a folding stock, which can shorten the overall length of the weapon for close-quarters combat. The stock also incorporates holes in which assembly pins can be stored during weapon cleaning and maintenance.

====Material====
The G36 employs a number of lightweight, corrosion-resistant synthetic materials in its design. The receiver housing, stock, trigger group (including the fire control selector and firing mechanism), magazine well, handguard and carry handle are all made of a carbon fibre-reinforced polyamide. The receiver has an integrated steel barrel trunnion (with locking recesses) and a nylon 66-based, steel-reinforced receiver.

===Sights===
The standard German Army versions of the G36 are equipped with a ZF 3×4° dual optical sight, which includes a 3× magnified telescopic sight and an unmagnified reflex sight mounted slightly higher. The reflex sight is illuminated by ambient light during the day and uses battery-powered illumination for use at night. Electric illumination is activated automatically by a built-in photoresistor and can be manually activated to boost the brightness of the reticle in low contrast situations. The main reticle is sighted in at and includes crosshairs and a range-finding scale. It also features bullet drop compensation markings for .

Export versions have a single telescopic sight with 1.5× magnification and a fixed reticle. All rifles are adapted to use the Hensoldt NSA 80 third-generation night sight, which clamps into the G36 carry handle adaptor in front of the optical sight housing and mates with the rifle&#x27;s standard optical sight. The sighting bridge also functions as a carrying handle and features auxiliary open sights moulded on top of the handle that consist of a forward blade and rear notch, but these can only be used with the reflex sight removed, as in the G36V. The optical sight system is produced by Hensoldt AG (a subsidiary of Carl Zeiss AG).

===Operating mechanism===

The G36 uses a short-stroke piston system from which HK later developed the HK-416&#x27;s impingement system. Unlike direct impingement, the system uses gas trailing the bullet to operate the piston instead of pushing directly on the bolt. The G36&#x27;s bolt is operated by a cam that guides the bolt carrier by its respective cut-out. Then, when fully pushed forward, 7 radial locking lugs fully enclose the chamber.

The design includes several features that are commonplace in modern military firearms. The bolt locks back after the last round is spent, although this can be deactivated using the bolt catch button on front end of the trigger guard. The charging handle folds and unfolds automatically via a spring when firing; the handle can also be operated from either side of the firearm. The handle also doubles as a forward assist in the event of a failure to feed. The ejection port has a brass deflector that helps left-handed users avoid being struck by casings. The bolt also acts as a dust cover.

===Accessories===
The rifle can be fitted with a 40 mm AG36 (AG—&quot;Anbau-Granatwerfer&quot;) under-barrel grenade launcher, which loads via a side-tilting break action.

Standard equipment supplied with the G36 includes: spare magazines, a cleaning and maintenance kit, sling, speedloader and sometimes modified AKM type II blade bayonets (many of which are left over in Germany from stocks of the former National People&#x27;s Army).

==Variants==
=== G36 ===
Introduced in 1996, the G36 is chambered in 5.56×45mm NATO. It features a barrel.

The G36V (V—&quot;Variante&quot; &quot;variant&quot;) is the export variant of the G36, previously known as the G36E (E—&quot;Export&quot;). The G36V features an altered sight setup and bayonet mount. It is fitted with a 1.5× or 3× sight and lacks the integrated reflector sight. It features a standard NATO bayonet mount. The G36V was first produced for the Spanish and Latvian National Armed Forces.

The G36A2 is an upgraded variant of the G36 also in service with in the German Army. It is equipped with a quick-release Zeiss RSA reflex red dot sight mounted on a Picatinny rail, replacing the original red dot sight. The G36A2 includes the shorter G36C stock, a new handguard made of aluminium (permitting better heat dissipation during sustained fire), an optional four Picatinny rails, and a vertical foregrip with an integrated switch for the LLM01 laser light module. Throughout its service life, it has received further modernisation upgrades, designated as the G36A3 and G36A4.

Some G36A1 rifles were given the same modernisation upgrades as the G36A3 while reusing the original, cheaper A1 receiver. These variants are known as the G36A1.1.

=== G36K ===

Introduced in 1997, the G36K (K—&quot;kurz&quot; &quot;short&quot;) is a carbine variant with a shorter barrel, an open-type flash suppressor, a shorter forend, and a bottom rail. The carbine&#x27;s barrel lacks the ability to launch rifle grenades and does not support a bayonet. The weapon retains compatibility with the AG36 grenade launcher. G36Ks in service with German special forces are issued with a 100-round C-Mag drum. The G36K has multiple slight variations. One includes a 3× scope/carry handle attached to the top, while the second only includes iron sights and a rail.

The G36KV (formerly G36KE) is the export variant of the G36K, using the sights on the G36V.

The G36KA4 is a modernised variant of the G36K made for German special forces. It adds the proprietary HKey mod system to the handguard, a heavier barrel, and a carry handle with a MIL-STD-1913 Picatinny rail. The stock was also replaced with an IdZ adjustable stock for better handling while using body armour.

=== G36C ===
Introduced in 2001, the G36C (C—&quot;compact&quot;) is a compact variant and a further development of the G36K. It has a shorter barrel than the G36K and either a four-prong open-type flash hider or a birdcage type flash hider. The extremely short barrel forced designers to move the gas block closer to the muzzle end and reduce the length of the gas piston operating rod. The handguard and stock were also shortened, and it includes the carrying handle from the G36KA4. The dual optical sight found on the standard G36 and G36K models was replaced with a set of rail-mounted detachable iron sights that consist of a semi-shrouded front post and a flip-up rear sight with two apertures of different diameter. The short handguard has four accessory attachment points, one of which could be used for a vertical grip. The G36C was developed and produced in January 2001.

=== MG36 ===
The MG36 (MG—&quot;Maschinengewehr&quot; &quot;machine gun&quot;) is an automatic rifle variant of the G36 equipped with a heavier barrel for increased thermal performance and cook-off resistance. The MG36 and MG36E (E—&quot;Export&quot;) are no longer offered by Heckler &amp; Koch.

===Sporting and civilian variants===
Heckler &amp; Koch also created the semi-automatic SL8 rifle and the straight-pull, bolt-action R8, which are offered to the civilian sport shooting markets, both are loosely based on the G36. The SL8 is substantially different from the G36, it has a modified receiver and a thumbhole stock with a cheek rest, which is integral with the trigger group. The SL8 has a heavy profile, extended, barrel that does not have a flash hider or bayonet lug. The rifle uses a 10-round single-stack magazine and an extended top rail used to mount a wide variety of Picatinny-standard optics. Mounted to the rail are a set of iron sights with a hooded foresight and adjustable flip rear aperture. The SL8 can also mount the G36 carry handle and integrated sight assembly, after removing the mechanical iron sights. The SL8 has an unloaded weight of , overall length of and a trigger rated at .

In November 2013, Heckler &amp; Koch applied for permission from the German Government to sell a new civilian-legal version of the G36. Known as the HK243 in Europe and the HK293 in America, it is more similar to the G36 assault rifle than previous civilian models. The main difference is the bolt is redesigned not to allow a conversion to fully automatic fire. It has quad picatinny rails and accepts STANAG magazines. Four different barrel lengths from to and four stock models (short fixed, long fixed and two adjustable) will be offered.

In November 2020, semi-automatic only G36 rifles became available for sale on the civilian market in Canada. They were sold with match grade barrels by Lothar Walther for CAD $5,999, or with a Heckler &amp; Koch barrel for CAD $7,998.

===Steyr G62===
In May 2021, Steyr Arms introduced the G62 upgrade for G36 rifles. According to Steyr, the components of this upgrade kit (metal receiver, barrel and magazine well) can be mounted independently on existing G36 arms without any modifications. German media speculated this might be a relatively inexpensive way to extend the service life of the G36 in the pending the outcome of legal procedures regarding a new system assault rifle tender for the .

===TommyBuilt Tactical T36===
The TommyBuilt Tactical T36 is an American-made clone receiver based on the G36, which was started in 2007 by Tom Bostic based on converting a SL8 to a G36. In February 2021, the BATF classified it as a machine gun.

<text>Knoxville College is an unaccredited private historically black college in Knoxville, Tennessee, United States. It was founded in 1875 by the United Presbyterian Church of North America. The college is a United Negro College Fund member school.

A slow period of decline began in the 1970s and by 2015 the school had an enrollment of just 11 students. In May 2015, the college suspended classes until Fall 2016 term in hopes of reorganizing. On May 17, 2018, the Tennessee Higher Education Commission gave its approval for Knoxville College to once again reopen its doors and offer classes. On July 1, 2018, Knoxville College website announced resumption of enrolling students for fall 2018 semester. In May 2022, three students graduated.

==History==

===Establishment===
Knoxville College is rooted in a mission school established in Knoxville in 1864 by R. J. Creswell of the United Presbyterian Church to educate the city&#x27;s free Black and formerly enslaved people. This school initially met in the First Baptist Church building (which at the time was located on Gay Street) before moving to a permanent facility in East Knoxville in 1866. In spite of general apathy from the city&#x27;s leaders and threats from poor whites, the school&#x27;s enrollment gradually grew to over 100. In addition to black students, the school also had many white students until 1901, when Tennessee passed a law forcibly segregating all schools.

In the 1870s, the church&#x27;s Freedmen&#x27;s Mission, which had established mission schools for freed slaves across the South, decided to refocus its efforts on building a larger, better-equipped school in Knoxville, in part due to stiff competition from other denominations in Nashville. In 1875, the church sold its East Knoxville property and purchased its current property, which at the time consisted of a hill that had been occupied by a Confederate battery during the Civil War. The school&#x27;s first building, McKee Hall, named for O.S. McKee, was completed in 1876, and the school opened in December of that year. Former governor William G. Brownlow and gubernatorial candidate William F. Yardley spoke at the opening ceremonies.

John Schouller McCulloch was named the school&#x27;s first principal and Eliza B. Wallace was named the school&#x27;s principal of female students. The new school was primarily a normal school, which trained teachers, but also operated an academy for the education of local children. In 1877, the school was designated a college by the state, to the surprise of McCulloch, as few of the school&#x27;s students were ready for a college-level curriculum. In 1890, the state designated the school the recipient of its Morrill Act funds for blacks, with which the school established mechanical and agricultural departments.

==== Medical department (1895–1900) ====

There were no medical schools for African Americans prior to the American Civil War, which lasted to 1865. Knoxville College had an early medical department for black students, open from 1895 until 1900. The Knoxville College medical department was created through the donation of the &quot;Colored Department&quot; at the University of Tennessee; the &quot;Colored Department&quot; had been founded by the United Presbyterian Church in 1887 for the use of medical training. William Wallace Derrick had been an African American faculty member at Knoxville College and helped establish the short lived medical department. The Knoxville College Hospital was opened in 1907 at 1825 College Street.

After the department closure, the city of Knoxville organized as a replacement black medical school in winter 1900, named the Knoxville Medical College; which was led by the city physician, Henry Morgan Green.

===Early 20th-century growth===
In 1901, Knoxville College finally received a charter from the State of Tennessee. Six years later, the school established the Eliza B. Wallace Hospital, which served a dual purpose of training nurses and tending to the health needs of the local black community. This proved invaluable during the city&#x27;s Influenza outbreak of 1918.

In 1913, John Henry Michael, the head of the school&#x27;s mechanical department, designed the &quot;Negro Building&quot; for the National Conservation Exposition, which was held across town at Chilhowee Park. The building, which is no longer standing, was constructed with the help of Knoxville College students.

During World War I, Knoxville College students helped raise money for liberty bonds and the Red Cross. In the aftermath of the Riot of 1919, one of the city&#x27;s worst racial episodes, the school&#x27;s administration (comprising black and white members) staunchly defended the city&#x27;s African American community, and praised its students&#x27; restraint. In 1925, Knoxville College students staged a month-long boycott of classes to protest the school&#x27;s strict behavioral code, culminating in an all-night negotiating session between student leaders and the school&#x27;s dean, Herbert Telford. Telford agreed to relax some rules, and allowed the creation of a student council.

In 1957, Knoxville College became one of the first group of predominantly black institutions admitted to full membership in the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools (SACS). Throughout the summer of 1960, Knoxville College students engaged in a series of sit-ins to protest segregation at lunch counters in downtown Knoxville, eventually convincing most downtown businesses to end the practice. The school&#x27;s charter was amended in 1962 to allow the admission of white students.

===Accreditation loss, reorganization attempts, and closure===
Beginning in the 1970s, Knoxville College began to struggle financially, leading to a gradual decline. In 1997, the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools withdrew Knoxville College&#x27;s accreditation; enrollment dropped precipitously and the school&#x27;s financial situation became dire. As enrollment plummeted, the school&#x27;s debt skyrocketed and it was soon unable to pay its faculty or electric bills. Throughout the rest of the 1990s, as enrollment plummeted, most campus buildings were shuttered and abandoned, with most degree programs being discontinued. In August 2005, the school&#x27;s Board of Trustees fired the school&#x27;s president, Barbara Hatton.

Following Hatton&#x27;s removal, the school&#x27;s alumni association embarked on an aggressive fundraising campaign in 2006 and 2007 to save the college and return it to solvency. In January 2010, the school hired Horace A. Judson as interim president. Judson implemented a new strategic plan with the following goals: (1) regain accreditation, (2) achieve fiscal stability, (3) develop academic program distinctiveness, (4) develop a department of enrollment management, (5) develop a quality student-centered living and learning environment, and (6) establish new relationships and strengthen former ones among key constituents.

However, Judson soon left and the college continued to struggle. On June 9, 2014, the Environmental Protection Agency seized control of the long-shuttered A.K. Stewart Science Hall to conduct an emergency clean-up of toxic chemicals that the college had improperly stored in laboratories; In early 2015 state accreditation for the college was withdrawn, further complicating the college&#x27;s already strained finances. In April 2015, the school announced it was suspending classes for the Fall 2015 term in hopes of reorganizing. Enrollment had dwindled to just 11 students, and the college was struggling to pay back a $4.5 million loan from 2003 and more than $425,000 to the federal government for the Stewart Science Hall cleanup. In May 2015, the school announced classes would resume in the Fall 2016 term.

In May 2016, the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation recommended the college become a state Superfund site due to ongoing contamination concerns from the Stewart Science Hall. In September 2016, the City of Knoxville demanded that Knoxville College make repairs to fourteen of its buildings within 90 days or face condemnation. City crews subsequently boarded up the buildings. The Knoxville Fire Department responded to between four and five fires at abandoned buildings on campus in 2016, and estimated that since the buildings began falling into disuse after 1997, they had responded to twenty or thirty such fires there.

, most of the campus sits abandoned, in an advanced state of disrepair. Most buildings are open to vagrants and vandals. This has caused severe damage to the buildings. The former college center has been set on fire twice. Since early 2018, the college administrative offices are back on campus again, occupying the college Annex which is next to McMillan Chapel. Plans have been made to renovate McMillan Chapel and the Alumni Library.

In 2023, Knoxville College&#x27;s Vice President Dasha Lundy has been on a team working in collaboration with the University of Tennessee, Morris Brown College in Atlanta and other schools, to regain their accreditation by 2024 which is Knoxville College’s main priority now. In August 2024, the college applied for accreditation with the Transnational Association of Christian Colleges and Schools.

==Campus==

Knoxville College is situated on a 17-building, campus, located atop a hill overlooking the Mechanicsville neighborhood, just northwest of Knoxville&#x27;s downtown area. Along with administration and classroom buildings, the campus includes a performing arts center, a gymnasium, a library, a chapel, and a student center. The school maintains dormitories for on-campus students, as well as a president&#x27;s house, and cottages and apartments for faculty.

===Knoxville College Historic District===

In 1980, eight buildings on the Knoxville College campus received recognition for having a role in minority education on the National Register of Historic Places as a historic district. Many of the earliest buildings were constructed using student labor, student-made bricks, and lumber donated by alumni. The district includes the following buildings:

*McKee Hall, the oldest building on campus, originally built in 1876, largely rebuilt in 1895 following a fire. The building is named for O.S. McKee who had established the first school for African-American children in Nashville in 1862. This building currently houses administration offices.
*The President&#x27;s House, built in the late 1880s. The house was originally built of wood, but brick siding was added in 1905.
*Wallace Hall, built in 1890 as an orphanage. This building is named for Eliza B. Wallace, the school&#x27;s principal of female students, 1877–1897.
*Elnathan Hall, built in 1898 following the destruction by fire of the original Elnathan Hall, and altered in 1905 and 1971. This building has served variously as a women&#x27;s dorm, administration building, and classroom building. It was destroyed by fire on November 4, 2024.
*Two Faculty cottages, 1005 and 1009 College Street, both built in the Bungalow style in 1906.
*McMillan Chapel, built in 1913, designed by Knoxville College alumnus, William Thomas Jones. Along with church services, the chapel served as the campus&#x27;s primary performance venue. Notable guests who have delivered speeches at the chapel include George Washington Carver, Countee Cullen, W. E. B. Du Bois, Jesse Owens, William H. Hastie and Jackie Robinson.
*Giffen Memorial Gymnasium, built in 1929.

In 2016, the preservationist group Knox Heritage placed the Knoxville College Historic District on its &quot;Fragile Fifteen,&quot; a list of endangered Knoxville-area historic properties.

===Freedmen&#x27;s Mission Historic Cemetery===
The Freedmen&#x27;s Mission Historic Cemetery, at the corner of Booker and College, is a historic African-American burial ground on the campus.

==Administration==
A 16-member board of trustees oversees Knoxville College. Its chairman is Dr. Eric Barnes. The board includes representatives from the Knoxville College National Alumni Association. The board appoints the president, who is the school&#x27;s chief administrator.

On December 5, 2024, it was announced that Dr. Rotesha Harris would be the college&#x27;s 32nd President.

==Academics==
, Knoxville College offered two degrees: the four-year Bachelor of Liberal Studies, and the two year Associate of Arts. The Bachelor of Liberal Studies includes one of four areas of concentration: Humanities, Business and Computer Sciences, Natural Sciences and Mathematics, or Social and Behavioral Sciences. The curriculum further requires 15 to 18 semester hours of specialization within each concentration, providing for a more in-depth understanding of a particular field.

Knoxville College followed a debt-free policy that allowed students to complete the degree program without the accumulation of debt. This was accomplished primarily through its College Work Program, which allowed students to offset much of their tuition costs by working for several hours per week. This program involved a mix of performing various tasks around campus, community involvement, and internship programs.

==Student life==

Knoxville College&#x27;s Student Government Association (SGA), which was elected by the student body, acted as a liaison between students and campus administration. The SGA was led by a president, elected for one term.

Student activities included a dance team, a debate team, a choir, and a trivia team (which competed with other HBCUs in the Honda Bowl Competition). The school&#x27;s newspaper, &quot;The Aurora&quot;, was published for over a century. The college also maintained a student ambassador program and wellness program that provided volunteer services for the surrounding community.

After 1997, Knoxville College dropped most athletics programs due to declining enrollment, but as part of its reorganization, hopes to re-establish men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s basketball teams, as well as a cheerleading squad.

<text>Heaven and Hell is a studio album by Greek electronic composer Vangelis, released in November 1975 on RCA Records. It is the first album recorded at his Nemo Studios in London that he used until 1987. It is a concept album based on duality.

The album marks Vangelis&#x27; departure from the progressive rock sound on his previous album &quot;Earth&quot; (1973), with adoption of a more classical synthesized sound, as well his UK chart debut.

== Overview ==
In 1975, Vangelis moved to London where he set up his own Nemo Studios. The album was his first record made at the studio. He recalls that &quot;I was trying to put together the studio while recording my first album, &quot;Heaven and Hell&quot;, at the same time. In fact, the studio was Hell because there was unmixed concrete everywhere, builders all over the place making a lot of noise, and next to all that, there I was, trying to finish my album. There was no limit as to how much time I could spend working on the album, but I felt I just had to do it, and in any case, the only way you can complete the construction of a studio quickly is to start working in it before it&#x27;s actually finished&quot;.

Vangelis recalls &quot;I don&#x27;t like to prepare for a long, long, long time an album. It&#x27;s more exciting for me to sit down and to play whatever comes. So this is the way that &quot;Heaven and Hell&quot; happens. I spent six weeks to make this album but I spent maybe two weeks to put down the first tracks&quot;. Vangelis played all the instruments except the choir.

The album marked Vangelis&#x27; first collaboration with singer Jon Anderson, who sings on &quot;So Long Ago, So Clear&quot;, the closing section of Part One. Vangelis recalls how they &quot;sat down one day and I start to play the melody and he felt so comfortable that immediately he started to write the words&quot;.

== Release ==
&quot;Heaven and Hell&quot; entered the UK Albums Chart on January 10, 1976 and reached #31. The album gained further recognition when &quot;Movement 3&quot; became the theme for the American television documentary series, &quot;&quot; by Carl Sagan. In 1981 it was released as a single titled &quot;Heaven and Hell (Theme from &#x27;The Cosmos&#x27;)&quot;, and reached #48 in the UK Singles Chart on 18 July 1981.

In 2011 the album was included along with &quot;Albedo 0.39&quot; and &quot;Spiral&quot; in a 3-CD box set series &quot;Original Album Classics&quot; by Sony, RCA and Legacy Recordings. In 2013 the album was released as a remastered and reissued digipak edition by Esoteric Recordings. The same label in September 2014 released a remastered gatefold vinyl limited edition.

== Composition ==
It is one of the most important works by Vangelis as it demonstrated for the first time his combination of synthesizer, percussion and a chorus in a rich orchestral style of electronic music. It is one of many thematic albums by Vangelis, contrasting images of Heaven, expressed with a more tranquil sound, and Hell, which sounds more avant-garde.

== Reception ==

Steven McDonald of AllMusic described it as a &quot;dark, thundering album&quot; which &quot;massed Gothic choirs and a musical depiction of all the tortures of the damned, with an impressive amount of string-driven shrieking&quot;, concluding &quot;... it&#x27;s a brilliant piece of work that should not be absent from any Vangelis collection&quot;. Henri Stirk from Background Magazine rated the 2013 edition by Esoteric Recordings 3/5 stars.

<text>Endurance racing is a form of motorsport which is meant to test the durability of equipment and endurance of participants. Teams of multiple drivers attempt to cover a large distance in a single event, with participants given a break with the ability to change during the race. Endurance races can be run either to cover a set distance in laps as quickly as possible, or to cover as much distance as possible over a preset amount of time.

One of the more common lengths of endurance races can be running for , or roughly 3 hours, or , or roughly 6 hours. Longer races can run for , 12 hours, or even 24 hours. Endurance races often feature multiple different categories of vehicles competing in their own classes, but races with a single category also exist. Teams can consist of anywhere from two to four drivers per event, which is dependent on the driver&#x27;s endurance abilities, length of the race, or even the rules for each event.

==Origins==
Coppa Florio was an Italian car race started in 1900, and renamed in 1905 when Vincenzo Florio offered the initial 50 000 Lira and a cup designed by Polak of Paris. The Brescia race visited the route Brescia-Cremona-Mantova-Brescia. In 1908, the race used the Circuito di Bologna: Bologna-Castelfranco Emilia-Sant&#x27;Agata Bolognese-San Giovanni in Persiceto-Bologna. Since 1914 most of the Coppa Florio was co-organized with the Targa Florio near Palermo, Sicilia, running four or five laps, 108 km each.

The Targa Florio was an open road endurance automobile race founded in 1906- the track length of the last decades was limited to the 72 kilometres of the Circuito Piccolo delle Madonie, which was lapped 11 times.

The Mille Miglia was an open-road endurance race which took place in Italy 24 times from 1927 to 1957.

The world&#x27;s first organized 24-hour automobile race event was held on a 1-mile oval track at Driving Park, Columbus, Ohio on July 3–4, 1905. Beginning on the afternoon of July 3, four cars from Frayer-Miller, Pope-Toledo, Peerless and White Steamer raced for a $500 silver trophy. The winning Pope-Toledo car covered 828.5 miles. A protest was filed by the Frayer-Miller and Peerless teams, alleging the Pope-Toledo was not owned by the driver, instead sent from the factory with an engine built for racing.

The first 24-hour race to take place at a dedicated motorsport venue was at Brooklands in England, eleven days after its opening in 1907. This incurred the wrath of local residents and would lead to the &quot;Double Twelve&quot; race. This format meant the race took place for 12 hours each between 8 am to 8 pm and between it, the cars were locked up overnight to prevent maintenance work from being performed on them.

The 2001 Dakar Rally saw competitors cover a distance of with a winning time of 70 hours over 20 days with three classes of cars, motorbikes, and trucks. The 1992 Paris–Cape Town Rally covered a distance of 12,427 km. The 1994 edition saw competitors return to Paris, for a distance of 13,379 km. The Expedition Trophy, first held in 2005, runs from Murmansk to Vladivostok, for a total distance of 12,500 km. The 1908 New York to Paris Race covered a distance of over 16,000 km, taking 169 days from February 12 to July 30.

==Automobile endurance racing==

In the beginning of formalised endurance racing, the races tended to be for sports cars while the Grand Prix cars of the era began to evolve into the open wheel racing cars of today and ran over shorter distances. Over time sports cars began to evolve away from their roots as a production based alternative to pure-bred racing machines of Grand Prix cars, which led to the creation of GT and touring car racing classes, and these classes continued to embrace the endurance format. Multiple drivers per car was an early adaptation as the rigors of endurance racing quickly overcome the abilities of most racing drivers to compete solo, although solo attempts on 24 hour races like Le Mans would continue into the 1950s.

The various endurance formats were appealing to manufacturers, not only as alternatives to the expense of Grand Prix racing, but also because of its increased relevance to road going models.

===Triple Crown and other major races===

In automobile endurance racing, three events have come to form a Triple Crown. They are considered three of the most challenging endurance races over the decades: the 24 Hours of Daytona, 12 Hours of Sebring, and 24 Hours of Le Mans. Other major endurance races include Petit Le Mans, Nürburgring 24 Hours, Spa 24 Hours, and Bathurst 12 Hour. Usually, these races include two or more categories of automobiles, but single-category endurance races also exist.

===Endurance racing championships===
Strong spectator figures, media interest and television coverage of endurance racing&#x27;s Triple Crown events (24 Hours of Daytona, 12 Hours of Sebring, and 24 Hours of Le Mans) has led to the establishment of several endurance racing series — thereby giving teams the opportunity of running their cars in Championship events throughout the year.

The FIA World Endurance Championship is an international sports car racing series organized by both the Automobile Club de l&#x27;Ouest (ACO) and the Fédération Internationale de l&#x27;Automobile (FIA). It supeceded the Intercontinental Le Mans Cup, run in 2010 and 2011, and uses similar rules to the WSCC and ELMS/AsLMS below. The series features both Le Mans Prototypes and GT cars. The 24 Hours of Le Mans is included as a feature race, while the other races are 6 hours long and take place in countries all over the world such as Bahrain, Brazil, Japan, and the United States. The WEC is considered a revival of the defunct World Sportscar Championship which ended in 1992.

An early championship was the Australian Endurance Championship, held since 1981.

The IMSA SportsCar Championship is a US sports car racing series organized by the International Motor Sports Association (IMSA). The season begins with the 24 Hours of Daytona, traditionally held in the last weekend of January or the first weekend of February. There then follows a further 12 races, including 
the famed 12 Hours of Sebring, 6 Hours of Watkins Glen and Petit Le Mans. The series includes Le Mans Prototypes and Le Mans-spec GT cars and formerly featured the unique Daytona Prototypes and Daytona-spec GT cars. The series is considered to be the successor of the defunct IMSA GT Championship as well as the American Le Mans Series and Rolex Sports Car Series that merged to form it.

The European Le Mans Series (ELMS) is a European sports car racing endurance series run by the Automobile Club de l&#x27;Ouest (ACO). The ELMS is seen as a rebirth of the old European Le Mans Series which was created by IMSA and the ACO, but only ran in 2001. LMS champions and runners-up in all four categories receive an automatic entry to the following year&#x27;s 24 Hours of Le Mans. All races used to be 6 hours long, but the format was changed to 3 hours in 2013 to differentiate it further from the WEC; currently, it has been reextended to 4 hours. With the debut of the World Endurance Championship in 2012, the series has dropped LMP1 and now features LMP2 as its premier category, in addition to LMP3 and GT categories. 

The Asian Le Mans Series (AsLMS) is an Asian sports car racing series run by the Automobile Club de l&#x27;Ouest (ACO). It uses the same car categories and regulations as the ELMS, and also provides automatic entries to the 24 Hours of Le Mans. The series is related to the former Japan Le Mans Challenge that turned into the older Asian Le Mans Series (which was cancelled after one season).

The GT World Challenge Europe Endurance Cup (GTWCEEC) is a European sports car racing endurance series run by the Stéphane Ratel Organisation. It is similar to the ELMS, but only uses performance-balanced GT3 cars instead of prototypes and holds generally shorter races, although some races are exceptions, such as the 24 Hours of Spa, which the series is centred on. One of the key emphases of the series is being friendly for amateur and gentlemen drivers, and there are numerous non-pro classes in addition to the premier GT3 Pro class. The series began in 2011 and saw increased involvement in 2012 and 2013.

The Baja 1000 is an annual Mexican off-road motorsport endurance race held on the Baja California Peninsula. It is one of the most prestigious off-road races in the world. The race was founded by Ed Pearlman in 1967 and is sanctioned by SCORE International. The Baja 1000 allows various types of vehicles and classes to compete on the same course at the same time. The course has remained relatively the same over the years, with about every event being either a point-to-point race from Ensenada to La Paz, or a loop race starting and finishing in Ensenada.

The Intercontinental GT Challenge is world sports car racing endurance series run by the Stéphane Ratel Organisation, like the GTWCEEC. Its rule set is similar to GTWCEEC, although it is centred on internationally renowned endurance races that are often part of multiple championships, such as the Bathurst 12 Hours and the Nürburgring 24 Hours, which belong to the GT World Challenge Australia and Nurburgring Langstrecken-Serie championships respectively.

===In popular culture===
Endurance motor racing has proven a popular subject for depiction in video games, and on film. The Lee H. Katzin film &quot;Le Mans&quot;, starring Steve McQueen, used real race footage, and enjoys cult status. The 1986 arcade game &quot;WEC Le Mans&quot; was the first to portray endurance racing in a videogame, while &quot;Gran Turismo 4&quot; and &quot;5&quot; extended this to a real-time simulation of 24 hour events. In the 2018 stealth video game Hitman 2, a level takes place amidst an endurance race in Miami, Florida, with a target being a racer in the event. 
==Motorcycle endurance racing==
In the early days of endurance racing cars and motorcycles raced side by side, but the two were soon separated. The most notable motorcycle endurance race was the Bol d&#x27;Or, first run on the circuit of Vaujours, near Paris in 1922. Only one rider was permitted per bike and there was no stopping other than for refuelling.

Motorcycle endurance racing began to expand after the second World War as new races began to emerge, among them the 24 Hour Race in Warsage, Belgium in 1951, the 24 Hours of Montjuïc in Barcelona in 1957, 24 hours in Monza, Italy in 1959, and the Thruxton 500 mile endurance race at Thruxton, Hampshire, England in 1960.

1960 also saw the inaugural FIM Endurance Cup initially made up of four races, the Thruxton 500, Montjuich, Warsage, and the Bol d&#x27;Or.

The popularity of motorcycle endurance racing increased in the 1970s with the arrival of four-cylinder machines from Japan. In 1976 the FIM Endurance Cup became the European Championship and in 1980 a World Championship.

===Notable motorbike endurance races===
Motorcycle endurance classics:
* 24 Hours of Le Mans
* Bol d&#x27;Or (variously at the Le Mans, Paul Ricard and Magny Cours circuits; and earlier at Saint Germain, Fontainebleau, Monthly).
* Thruxton 500 and 
* Suzuka 8 Hours
* Albacete 8 Hours
* Francorchamps Spa

==Kart endurance racing==
Endurance races last for an extended period, ranging from 30 minutes up to 24 hours or more, for one or more drivers. In general, consistency, reliability, and pit strategy is of greater importance than all out speed.

As well as the famous 24 Hours of Le Mans race for automobiles there is also a 24 hours event for karts which takes place at the kart circuit Alain Prost at Le Mans, France. This race has taken place since 1986 and its winners list include four times Champ Car champion Sébastien Bourdais (in 1996).

==Motorboat endurance racing==

===Notable motorboat endurance races===
24 Heures Motonautiques de Rouen - take place on the Seine River

==Other forms==
* In addition to the annual car and motorcycle race, the Circuit de la Sarthe also holds 24 hour races in cycling, karting, trucks, and road skating.
* A unique event involving an endurance race between lawn mowers takes place in the United Kingdom, called the &quot;BLMRA 12 Hour Race&quot;.

==See also==
* 24 hour mountain bike races
* Australian HPV Super Series
* Endurance World Championship
* Gran Turismo (racing)
* Greenpower
* Rally raid
* Sports car racing
* Pedal Car Racing
* 24 Hours of Lemons
* ChampCar Endurance Series

==Notes==
: Was known as the &quot;Daytona 3 Hour Continental&quot;, up to 1964.
: Was known as the &quot;Daytona 2000&quot;, up until 1965 before becoming a 24 hour race following that year.
: The race was shortened to 6 hours, partly over concerns that the 3 liter formula one engined prototypes were not reliable enough for the entire 24 hours.

<text>Weingarten ([[Baden]]) () is a municipality in the district of Karlsruhe in southwestern Germany, situated at the transition from the Kraichgau to the Rhine valley. Its name means wine garden in German. Weingarten is located on the Bertha Benz Memorial Route.

While remains of a settlement from Roman or earlier times have been found nearby, the village itself developed from a farm belonging to the Wissembourg monastery in Northern Alsace; 985 is considered to be the village&#x27;s founding year. Until 1803, Weingarten belonged to the Electorate of the Palatinate; in the course of the Napoleonic wars it became part of the Grand Duchy of Baden.

The population is about two thirds Protestant, one third Catholic.
The village is connected by &quot;Bundesstraße&quot; (federal road) B 3 and the railroad Frankfurt am Main-Basel. Close by is the &quot;Bundesautobahn&quot; (motorway) A 5 for the Karlsruhe-Frankfurt am Main route.

The village has its own elementary and secondary school; additional schools are in the neighbouring cities of Karlsruhe, Bruchsal, and Stutensee.

The village&#x27;s main industries are wine and fruit production, gastronomy, and wood, chemical, and metal production.

For recreation, there are sports fields, an indoor swimming pool, a recreational lake, and the nature reserve &quot;Weingartener Moor&quot;.
Also part of the municipality are the settlements Sallenbusch and Sohl in the Kraichgau hills, and Waldbrücke on the plain. The settlement of Sallenbusch was founded in June 1951 and constructed with the aid of U.S. soldiers. The first settlers arrived in July 1952.

<text>Marvin Earl &quot;Monty&quot; Roberts MVO (born May 14, 1935) is an American horse trainer who promotes his techniques of natural horsemanship through his &quot;Join-Up International&quot; organization, named after the core concept of his training method. Roberts believes that horses use a non-verbal language, which he terms &quot;Equus,&quot; and that humans can use this language to communicate with horses. In order to promulgate his methods, Roberts has authored a number of books including his original best-seller, &quot;The Man Who Listens to Horses&quot;, and regularly tours with a live demonstration. He runs an Equestrian Academy in Solvang, California and an &quot;online university&quot; to promote his ideas.

==Early life==
Monty Roberts was born in Salinas, California and is the son of horse trainer Marvin E Roberts, who authored his own self-published book, &quot;Horse and Horseman Training&quot;, in 1957. Roberts claims that his father also beat him as a child, although other family members, including his younger brother Larry, dispute this version of events, with his aunt and cousin, Joyce Renebome and Debra Ristau, specifically refuting the allegation in the book &quot;Horse Whispers &amp; Lies&quot;.

Roberts competed in rodeo and won his first trophy at the age of four. He attended California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo (&quot;Cal Poly&quot;) and riding for their rodeo team, he won two National Intercollegiate Rodeo Association (NIRA) National Championships, including National NIRA Champion Bulldogger in 1957, the NIRA Champion Team Roping in 1956. He graduated from Cal Poly in 1959 with a degree in animal science.

In 1966, Roberts assisted in the founding of Flag Is Up Farms, of which he is now the full owner. From 1973 to 1986, he was a leading consignor to the Hollywood Park Two-Year-Old Thoroughbreds in Training Sale. In 2004, Roberts’ German-bred horse Sabiango won major races throughout the US.

==Career==
Roberts describes in his books and web site how he was sent to Nevada at the age of 13 in order to round up horses for the Salinas Rodeo Association&#x27;s Wild Horse Race, and there began observing mustangs interact with each other. It was there he realized that horses use a discernible, effective and predictable body language to communicate, set boundaries, show fear and express annoyance, relaxation or affection. Roberts states he came to understand that utilizing this silent language would allow training to commence in a much more effective and humane manner, encouraging true partnership between horses and humans. Roberts describes this language as &quot;Equus&quot; and he refers to it frequently in his books, tours and demonstrations.

In his books, he has written about how he strongly disagreed with his father&#x27;s equine training methods, which he described as &quot;almost torturing the animals into submission&quot;. Morever, Marvin Roberts&#x27; own book has described training methods similar to the &quot;Join-up&quot; technique developed by son. However, critics have also noted parallels between the training methods of both father and son. In 2000 critics of Roberts registered a website using his name: www.montyroberts.org. After litigation, WIPO ruled against these parties stating they had &quot;engaged in abusive registration&quot; and transferred ownership to Roberts. Roberts says the website owners tried to blackmail him for US$90,000 to transfer the domain name.

Three documentaries on Roberts have been released. The first was the 1997 documentary BBC/PBS &quot;Monty Roberts: The Real Horse Whisperer&quot;. It showed Roberts as he set out to tame a wild mustang without enclosures, and his developing relationship with the horse later known as Shy Boy. Other documentaries include the 1999 film &quot;Shy Boy: The Horse That Came in from the Wild&quot; and a 2005 documentary on Roberts&#x27; work with wild horses and another about his work with aboriginal youth on Palm Island, Australia. In 2006, a DVD series with 17 episodes, named &quot;A Backstage Pass!&quot; was completed and broadcast in the UK. The series has also been broadcast in the US on the HRTV cable channel.
He has his own show on Horse &amp; Country TV, &quot;Backstage Pass with Monty Roberts&quot;.

==Horse training==
===Live demonstrations===

Roberts travels around the world, demonstrating his method of horse training to paying audiences, as well as volunteering time for audiences such as incarcerated youth in juvenile detention facilities. Roberts also teaches his techniques to students at his Equestrian Academy in Solvang, California, acts as a consultant at schools with disciplinary issues in the UK and the US, and advises executives at Fortune 500 companies. He also runs the &quot;Equus Online University&quot; to promote his ideas.

===Royal connections===

An event which would change the direction of his life was an invitation in 1989 from the offices of Queen Elizabeth II, who was an avid horsewoman. After hearing about Roberts&#x27; training techniques, she invited him to come to the United Kingdom to demonstrate his &quot;Join Up&quot; method to her stable staff. After watching his demonstration, Roberts said the Queen urged him to write a book about his nonviolent methods, which became &quot;The Man Who Listens to Horses&quot;. During his book tour of the UK in 1996, Roberts presented a copy of his book to the Queen.

In 2002 Roberts returned to Windsor Castle as part of the Queen&#x27;s Golden Jubilee. In the 2011 Birthday Honours, Roberts was appointed an Honorary Member of the Royal Victorian Order (MVO) &quot;for services to Her Majesty&#x27;s racing establishment&quot;. In June 2012, the Queen, as Patron of Join–Up International, attended the Guards Polo Club, and along with Roberts presented awards to international polo trainers from South and Central America in recognition of their work in promoting the non–violent training of horses.

After the death of the Queen on 8 September 2022, Roberts was invited to her funeral on 19 September.

===Writing===
Roberts has published several books. His first was the autobiographical &quot;The Man Who Listens to Horses&quot; which was published in 1996, which was on the New York Times Bestsellers list for 58 weeks, and translated into more than 15 languages, selling more than five million copies worldwide. Roberts has written other books, including best-selling &quot;Shy Boy: The Horse That Came in from the Wild&quot; (1999), &quot;Horse Sense for People&quot; (2001), &quot;From My Hands to Yours&quot; (2002), &quot;The Horses in My Life&quot; (2005) and &quot;Ask Monty&quot; (2007).

==Awards==
