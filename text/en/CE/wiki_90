<text>The United States 32nd Infantry Division was formed from Army National Guard units from Wisconsin and Michigan and fought primarily during World War I and World War II. With roots as the Iron Brigade in the American Civil War, the division&#x27;s ancestral units came to be referred to as the &quot;Iron Jaw Division&quot;. During tough combat in France in World War I, it soon acquired from the French the nickname &quot;Les Terribles&quot;, referring to its fortitude in advancing over terrain others could not. It was the first allied division to pierce the German Hindenburg Line of defense, and the 32nd then adopted its shoulder patch; a line shot through with a red arrow, to signify its tenacity in piercing the enemy line. It then became known as the &quot;Red Arrow Division&quot;.

During World War II, the division was credited with many &quot;firsts&quot;. It was the first United States division to deploy as an entire unit overseas and among the first of seven U.S. Army and U.S. Marine units to engage in offensive ground combat operations during 1942. The division was among the first divisions to engage the enemy and were still fighting holdouts after the official Japanese surrender. The 32nd logged a total of 654 days of combat during World War II, more than any other United States Army division. The unit was inactivated in 1946 after occupation duty in Japan.

During 1961, the division was called up for a one-year tour of service in the state of Washington during the Berlin Crisis. In 1967, the 32nd Infantry Division (now made up completely of units from Wisconsin) was inactivated and partially reorganized as the 32nd Infantry Brigade, the largest unit of the Wisconsin Army National Guard.

==World War I==
===Activation, organization and training===

When the United States declared war on Germany on 11 April 1917, the Wisconsin Adjutant General ordered the Milwaukee troops to add a squadron, and Troop C and Troop D were added. The Guard units&#x27; Troop A and Troop B had been mustered out of federal service less than a year earlier on 20 October 1916 and 6 March 1917, respectively. The Adjutant General then directed the unit to add a new regiment, and the Second and Third Squadrons were formed as the First Wisconsin Cavalry, with units organized in various cities. Troop E commanded by Captain John S. Coney was formed in Kenosha on 10 May 1917, and the Wisconsin Cavalry was officially formed on 29 May 1917.

Only two months later, the 32nd Division was activated in July 1917 at Camp MacArthur, Waco, Texas of National Guard units from Wisconsin and Michigan. Wisconsin furnished approximately 15,000 men, and another 8,000 troops came from Michigan. The division was made up of the 125th and 126th Infantry Regiments (63rd Infantry Brigade) and the 127th and 128th Infantry Regiments (64th Infantry Brigade), as well as three artillery regiments within the 57th Field Artillery Brigade. On 4 August 1917, Battery F, 121st Field Artillery regiment was the first unit to arrive at Camp MacArthur. The remainder arrived as soon as trains could be mustered for transportation.

On 26 August 1917, Major General James Parker assumed command. General Parker had previously been awarded the Medal of Honor during the Philippine–American War. On 18 September 1917, General Parker left for France on special duty with his chief of staff, Lieut. Col. E. H. DeArmond. Brigadier General William G. Haan assumed command in his absence. When General Parker returned in December, he was almost immediately transferred to the 85th Division at Camp Custer, Michigan. General Haan assumed command once again. In keeping with the new 1917 infantry division tables of organization that called for a square division, he reorganized the division during September and October. The 120th Field Artillery Regiment was organized on 22 September 1917 at Camp MacArthur, as a part of the 57th Field Artillery Brigade, better known as the &quot;Iron Brigade&quot;. The nickname originated with the 1st Wisconsin Cavalry and was traditionally given to crack artillery units in the Civil War. From 26 October to 3 November 1917, 3,000 National Army draftees were assigned to the division from Camp Custer, and during December, another 1,000 came from Camp Custer and Camp Grant, Illinois; the division would still be about 3,500 men understrength at the time of its departure for France.

Captain Alien L. Briggs returned to Camp MacArthur to assist with training. He had been an Aide-de-camp to General Parker and had been in Europe when the war broke out in 1914. He had observed the training methods used in military schools in France. As training intensified in preparation for leaving for France, five French and four British officers, along with several non-commissioned officers, joined the division as instructors. A trench system was built outside the camp in which the division practiced the techniques of trench warfare. There was a continual shortage of equipment that hampered training in the artillery and machine gun battalions. Additional training for junior and non-commissioned officers was implemented, and General Haan offered additional daily instruction to the brigade, regimental and battalion commanders.

By early December, it had received the equipment assigned to it and was judged to be ready for deployment. War Department inspectors found the division more advanced in its training than any other division in the United States. Orders were received in late December, and the first troops left Waco on 2 January 1918 for the New York Port of Embarkation at Hoboken, New Jersey. The infantry was moved first, arriving at Camp Merritt before the division headquarters sailed. The unit received its first casualties when the SS Tuscania (1914) was sunk by a German U-boat. Brigadier General William G. Haan led the unit when it arrived in France.

===Combat in France===
The 32nd Division arrived on the Western Front in February 1918. The 32nd was the sixth U.S. division to join the American Expeditionary Force (AEF), under General John J. Pershing. The unit&#x27;s morale was temporarily lessened when they learned they were assigned to create a depot for I Corps that would train replacement soldiers. Major General Haan reminded his commanders that it was every soldier&#x27;s duty to contribute their best to the war effort, including training replacements. However, Haan lobbied Pershing and after several stormy sessions, finally convinced him that the 32nd could hold its own as a division. Up to this point much of the war had been a stalemate, fought from static trench lines over the same few kilometers of terrain. Over the next six months, the division was under constant fire, with only 10 days&#x27; rest. The division took a leading role in three important offensives, fighting on five fronts, suffered more than 14,000 casualties, captured more than 2,000 prisoners, and never yielded ground to the enemy.

Major General James Parker had re-assumed command on 7 December 1917, and led the unit into Alsace in May 1918, attacking in seven days. During the Battle of Marne, they captured Fismes. The only American unit in French General Charles Mangin&#x27;s famous 10th French Army, it fought between the Moroccans and the Foreign Legion, two of the best divisions in the French army in the Battle of Oise-Battle of Aisne offensive. The 10th Army took Juvigny. In the five-day battle against five German divisions, the 32nd suffered 2,848 casualties.

On 18 May 1918, four battalions of the 32nd division replaced decimated French troops on the front line at Haute Alsace, along a front from the Aspach-le-Bas to the Swiss border. The division&#x27;s units conducted combat patrols into Germany itself, gaining the distinction of being the first US troops to set foot on enemy soil in World War I.

Moving out of their trenches, the division fought continuously for 20 days during the Meuse–Argonne offensive. The division was the front line element of the Third U.S. Army. The Germans were well dug in after four years of trench warfare and had orders to hold the line at all costs. On 14 October at 5:30 am, the division broke through the maze of barbed wire and took the line of trenches forming the Hindenburg Line and moved on to the last German stronghold at Kriemhilde Stellung, where they reached the Meuse River. The 32nd was the first Allied Army unit to penetrate the Hindenburg Line. They then captured Côte Dame de Marie, the key to all the defenses in the area. Over the next five days the division continued to advance while under nearly constant machine gun and artillery fire. The 32nd Division defeated 11 German divisions in the Argonne fighting, including the fearsome Prussian Guards and the German Army&#x27;s 28th Division, known as Kaiser&#x27;s Own. The offensive cost the division 5,950 casualties.

Their next objective was to flank the Germans at Metz and they marched to the Rhine River. There they occupied the center sector in the Koblenz bridgehead for four months, during which they held and 63 towns.

===Origin of nickname &quot;Les Terribles&quot;===

The division fought in three major offensives, engaging and defeating 23 German divisions. They took 2,153 prisoners and gained , pushing back every German counterattack. During the drive to capture Fismes, they successfully attacked over open ground at great cost.

The authorized strength of the 3rd battalion was 20 officers and 1,000 men, but by 4 August it had only 12 officers and 350 men on the line. As they advanced over of mostly open ground, the Germans targeted them with intense artillery and machine gun fire. They were reinforced by the 2nd Battalion, 127th Infantry, which was also understrength. The 127th Infantry finally captured Fismes, but they lost many men. By the end of the day, the 3rd Battalion had only two officers and 94 men; the 2nd Battalion had five officers and 104 men.

General de Mondesir, the 38th French Corps Commander, which the 32nd served under, went to the front to observe the fighting. When he saw how the 32nd cleared the Germans out of their reinforced positions with unrelenting and successful attacks, he exclaimed, &quot;Oui, Oui, Les soldats terribles, tres bien, tres bien!&quot; General Charles Mangin heard of it and referred to the 32nd Division as &quot;Les Terribles&quot; when he asked for the division to join his 10th French Army north of Soissons. He later made the nickname official when he incorporated it in his citation for their attack at Juvigny. The division&#x27;s shoulder patch, a line shot through with a red arrow, symbolizes the fact that the 32nd Division penetrated every German line of defense that it faced during World War I.

===Casualties and decorations===
The division was still engaging German troops east of the Meuse River when the Armistice was finally signed. The division suffered a total of 13,261 casualties, including 2,250 men killed in action and 11,011 wounded, placing it third in the number of battle deaths among U.S. Army divisions. The American, French, and Belgian governments decorated more than 800 officers and enlisted men for their gallantry in combat.

All four infantry regiments, the three artillery regiments, and the division&#x27;s three machine gun battalions were awarded the Croix de guerre by the Republic of France. The flag and standard of every unit in the division was authorized four American battle streamers. The 32nd Division was the only American division recognized with a &quot;nom-de-guerre&quot; by an Allied nation during the war.

===Inactivation===

Following the war&#x27;s end, the division served in the Army of Occupation in Germany, commanded by Maj. Gen. William Lassiter. The 32nd Division headquarters arrived at the port of Hoboken, New Jersey, aboard the troopship U.S.S. George Washington on 5 May 1919 after 16 months of overseas service and was demobilized 23 May 1919 at Camp Custer.

== Interwar period ==

In accordance with the National Defense Act of 1920, the 32nd Division was allotted to the states of Wisconsin and Michigan and assigned to the VI Corps in 1921. The division headquarters was reorganized and federally recognized on 24 July 1924 at Sparta, Wisconsin, under Major General Robert Bruce McCoy. After McCoy&#x27;s death from illness, the headquarters was relocated on 21 June 1926 to Lansing, Michigan, under the command of Major General Guy Wilson. Wilson was succeeded by Major General Irving Fish of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, on 22 December 1938.

In the period between the World Wars, the 32nd Division was understrength, with training rarely leaving the local drill hall except for the yearly summer encampment and occasional corps area or army maneuvers. During most years, the division&#x27;s units trained within their respective states; Michigan units at Camp Grayling, and Wisconsin units at Camp McCoy, Camp Williams, or Camp Douglas. For at least one year, in 1937, the division’s subordinate units trained over 100 company-grade officers of the Organized Reserve 101st Division at Camp Williams. In 1937 and 1938, the 107th Engineer Regiment trained at Camp Grayling with emphasis on boat drills and float bridging. The regiment was short of men, had no vehicles, and what equipment it had was of World War I vintage. The division staff mostly conducted joint training at Camp Grayling, with the Wisconsin elements of the staff training at Camp Douglas in those years when they did not go to Camp Grayling. The staff also participated in the Sixth Corps Area command post exercises in 1931, 1932, and 1936, and the large Second Army command post exercises in Chicago in 1933 and at Fort Knox, Kentucky, in September 1938. 

The entire division assembled in one place at Camo Custer, in August 1936 for the Second Army Maneuvers, The division was pitted against the 33rd Division of the Illinois National Guard in the field near Allegan, Michigan. In 1940, the division underwent a minor reorganization concurrent with the National Guard disbanding many of its horse cavalry units and fielding six new field artillery brigades. The 119th Field Artillery Regiment was relieved from the 32nd Division on 18 September 1940, reassigned to the 72nd Field Artillery Brigade, and had its armament changed from 75 mm guns to 155 mm guns; on 1 October 1940, the 105th Cavalry Regiment was relieved from the 23rd Cavalry Division, redesignated the 126th Field Artillery Regiment (75 mm gun), and assigned to the 32nd Division. The Michigan elements of the 107th Quartermaster Regiment were reorganized as part of the separate 177th Field Artillery Regiment, and the 107th was reorganized as an entirely Wisconsin-based unit.

== World War II ==

=== Louisiana Maneuvers ===
The fall of France in June 1940 injected urgency into their training operations, and on 27 August 1940, Congress authorized inducting the National Guard into federal service. Eighteen National Guard divisions were activated, including the 32nd. On 16 September 1940 Congress authorized the first peacetime draft in United States history.

When the division was federalized on 15 October 1940, It was authorized to have a peacetime strength of about 11,600 soldiers, but like almost all units in the National Guard and the Regular Army prior to World War II, was not at full strength nor was it assigned all of the equipment it was authorized. Training for many soldiers was incomplete. The division was scheduled to receive a year of training. In October 1940, the division began a six-day motor march to Camp Beauregard, Louisiana. On 26 January 1941, the 32nd Division relocated to the recently completed Camp Livingston, about northeast of Alexandria, Louisiana. The unit then spent the next 16 months training in Louisiana.

During the summer of 1941, the division moved to Camp Beauregard, Louisiana, as part in the Third and Fourth Army maneuvers—nicknamed the Louisiana Maneuvers—which provided the army high command a good look at the preparedness of the regiment. The first test, which was held in the vicinity of Camp Beauregard, was conducted 16–27 June and included the 32nd Division as well as the 37th Division from Ohio. From 16–30 August, the maneuvers expanded to include the 34th and 38th Divisions. During September, the largest maneuvers were held with the Seventh Corps of the Second Army, opposing the Fourth, Fifth, and Eighth Corps of the Third Army. The Grand Rapids Guard was part of the Fifth Corps. It was the largest maneuver of its kind in the history of the Army and included some 100,000 men.

National Guard units were at the time not required to serve active duty outside of the western hemisphere and draftees were inducted for a maximum of one year of service. But on 7 August 1941, by a margin of a single vote, Congress approved an indefinite extension of service for the guard, draftees, and reserve officers, including the Red Arrow Division.

During January and February 1942, the division lost one of its infantry regiments when, like all U.S. Army divisions, its &quot;square&quot; infantry division structure was reorganized into a triangular organization, centered on three instead of four infantry regiments. It was left with the 126th Infantry Regiment, 127th Infantry Regiment, and the 128th Infantry Regiment. The three existing artillery regiments (120th, 121st and 126th) were converted into four separate battalions (120th, 121st, 126th and 129th), and supporting units. In early February 1942, Major General Fish was transferred and replaced by Regular Army Major General Edwin F. Harding.

=== Pacific Theater ===
After the Attack on Pearl Harbor, the division was one of the first to be prepared for overseas duty. The division was initially ordered to prepare for an early departure overseas to Europe and the division moved to Fort Devens, Massachusetts, for transport to Northern Ireland. The 107th Engineer Battalion left Camp Livingston on 2 January 1942, and was shipped by train to Fort Dix, New Jersey, where it lost its 2nd battalion and was redesignated the 107th Engineer Combat Battalion. The 107th was shipped ahead of the rest of the division as an advance party so they could prepare an overseas camp for the division&#x27;s arrival.
The rest of the division was to have three months to prepare for embarkation to the front in Europe. However, Japan had rapidly advanced into the South Pacific, progressively occupying an increasing number of islands. Japan was evidently intent on cutting Australia off from its American supply lines, and Australia feared that Japan was planning to invade. Prime Minister John Curtin demanded the Allies release Australian troops from the Mediterranean and North Africa front to defend their home. The United States initially sent the 41st Infantry Division, less one regiment, from where it was training at Fort Lewis, Washington. The 41st Division arrived in Melbourne on 6 April 1942.

Though the Allies released the Australian 6th and 7th Divisions, the 9th could not be spared. In a compromise, the 32nd was notified on 25 March, less than six weeks after Harding was placed in command, to turn around and ship out west to the Pacific instead. Harding was told the entire unit was to be ready to board ships in San Francisco in only three weeks. Implementing these orders cost the division&#x27;s preparedness a great deal. The 35th Division, in lieu of an aborted mission to the Philippines to reinforce American forces there, was designated to replace the 32nd Division for eventual shipment to England.

The 114th Engineer Combat Battalion was hurriedly assigned to replace the 107th Engineers, who were already in the middle of the Atlantic bound for Ireland. On 1 June 1942, the original 107th Engineer Combat Battalion was redesignated the 2nd Battalion, 112th Engineer Regiment; on 19 August 1943, at Saunton Sands near Camp Braunton, England, the 2nd Battalion, 112th Engineers was redesignated as the 254th Engineer Combat Battalion.

The division boarded 13 freight trains and 25 passenger trains at Fort Devens near Boston on 9 April 1942 and arrived five days later in Oakland, California. Portions of the unit were then transported by bus to Pier 7 in San Francisco, where they boarded the U.S. Army ferry for Angel Island in San Francisco Bay, which was utilized by the Army as Fort McDowell. The remainder were housed at Fort Ord near Monterey, California, at the Dog Track Pavilion in Emeryville and at the Cow Palace, where the men slept uncomfortably in stadium chairs and in horse stalls.

On 22 April 1942, just before the division boarded ships in San Francisco bound for Australia, they received about 3,000 additional soldiers, most of whom had just finished basic training, to fill in their incomplete ranks. The division was still missing about 1,800 men. The division had to make do with whatever equipment was found in depots near San Francisco. Not even its firearms allocation was complete; it could not obtain any compact M1 carbine rifles meant for officers and support forces, forcing the division to arm them with the regular infantry&#x27;s longer, heavier yet more powerful M1 Garand. They traded in their World War I-era horse-drawn artillery pieces for new 105mm M101 howitzers, though they received scant training on the new guns.

After eight days waiting for transit, the division returned to San Francisco and boarded a convoy of seven Matson Line ships, including the S.S. &quot;Lurline&quot; and USS &quot;Hugh L. Scott&quot; at Pier 42. The convoy (SF 43) was escorted by the cruiser USS &quot;Indianapolis&quot; and two corvettes. Four days out of San Francisco, the Lurline ship&#x27;s crew discovered the division&#x27;s mascot, a dog named Vicksburg. She was named for the town she was born in and the location of the final major campaign of the American Civil War. (Vicksburg was killed in a road accident in Southport, Australia on 8 October 1942). A monument to the dog still exists at the former entrance to Camp Cable.

After a stop in Auckland, New Zealand, the ships entered a zone where two freighters had been sunk by Japanese submarines in recent days. The soldiers stayed fully dressed and wide eyed for the two days to Sydney. Taking a southerly route to avoid the Japanese Navy, they arrived in southern Australia at Port Adelaide on 14 May 1942, having traveled in 23 days. They were the first American division in World War II to be moved in a single convoy from the United States to the front lines.

=== Training in Australia ===

After the division arrived in Adelaide, the 126th Infantry Regiment was sent to Camp Sandy Creek (north of Adelaide), and the 127th and 128th went to Camp Woodside, east of Adelaide and from Camp Sandy Creek. Once the unit arrived in Australia, rather than begin combat training, the division was forced to build its new camps from scratch. Their initial training was planned to be oriented around a defense of the Australian mainland. However, instead of learning the basics of patrolling and maneuvering, they cut down trees, dug wells and latrines, and set up kitchens and tents. The division did not begin training again for several weeks.

==== Preparedness for jungle warfare ====
Although the 32nd had spent a good deal of time training in Louisiana, with considerable swamp close at hand, their intended destination at that time was Europe. Most official records state that the men had little additional training for jungle conditions while in Australia. General Eichelberger, Commanding General, I Corps and US Army Forces in Australia, wrote that &quot;In Washington I had read General MacArthur&#x27;s estimates of his two infantry divisions, and these reports and our own inspections had convinced my staff and me that the American troops were in no sense ready for jungle warfare.&quot; However, some veterans reported that they received general training with weapons and practice at terrain maneuvers and in jungle warfare, increasing once the unit arrived in Brisbane.

Less than two months after their arrival in Australia, the unit was moved in July 1942 halfway across Australia, northeast to Camp Tamborine, about south of Brisbane on Australia&#x27;s east coast. The majority of the division and its equipment was split up and shipped by railroad, while some were transported on five Liberty Ships. Each Australian state had a different rail gauge (or width), and the equipment and men had to be offloaded at each state&#x27;s boundary and reloaded onto a new train. The division&#x27;s trains crossed four states before it reached Brisbane.

On 30 August, Camp Tamborine was renamed Camp Cable, in honor of Sergeant Gerald O. Cable, a soldier in the Service Company, 126th Infantry. Sergeant Cable was the sole casualty when his Liberty ship, en route from Adelaide to Brisbane, was torpedoed by a Japanese submarine, making him the first soldier of the 32nd Division to die in combat during World War II.

=== Japanese assault on Port Moresby ===
The Battle of Coral Sea in early May followed by the Allied victory at the Battle of Midway in early June foiled Japan&#x27;s plans to capture Port Moresby by sea. The Japanese were undaunted. A Japanese convoy conveyed Maj. Gen. Tomitarō Horii with about 4,400 troops onto the beach at Gona during the night of 21–22 July 1942 on the north-eastern shore of Papua New Guinea. They proceeded inland to Popondetta and then south-westward onto the Kokoda Trail with the object of capturing Port Moresby. By 13 August, the Japanese had landed about 11,100 men, which the object of securing a base to dominate the south Pacific. The Allies commonly believed the Japanese intended to invade Australia, whose Cape York Peninsula was only from New Guinea. Unknown to the Allies, the Chief of the Imperial Japanese Naval General Staff, Osami Nagano, had proposed an invasion, but this plan was rejected in favor of a decision to occupy Midway Island with the intention of cutting Australia off from United States supply lines, eventually forcing Australia to surrender.

General Willoughby continued to believe that the Japanese only intended to build airfields on the northern coast with the intent to attack Port Moresby and Australia by air. But the Japanese fought up the northern side of the Owen Stanley Mountains and in the middle of September, after weeks of fighting, descended the southern slopes to Ioribaiwa Ridge, within of Port Moresby. At the peak of their effort, the Japanese had 16,000 troops in the region. Japanese engineers remained on the coast to fortify the beachhead and build a system of reinforced and cross-linked bunkers.

The Allied air forces relentlessly attacked the Japanese supply lines over the Owen Stanley Mountains that connected the Japanese forces to Buna, Sanananda, and Gona. The weakened Japanese forces, attacked from the air and on the front and flanks by Australian forces, were finally stopped on 17 September at Imita Range, south of Ioribaiwa.

=== Japanese withdrawal from Kokoda Track ===
On Guadalcanal, Lieutenant General Harukichi Hyakutake&#x27;s initial thrust to re-take the island&#x27;s Henderson Field had been badly defeated. Meanwhile, a landing at Milne Bay had also been repulsed. With the concurrence of the Japanese command staff, he ordered General Horii to withdraw his troops on the Kokoda Track until the issue at Guadalcanal was decided. On 28 September, General Horii and his troops began to hastily withdraw northward over the Owen Stanley Mountains to Kokoda and then to Buna–Gona.

=== Transport to New Guinea ===
General Douglas MacArthur had repeatedly requested Washington, D.C. to send him additional troops with which to initiate an offensive campaign and had been pointedly told he would have to make do with the troops on hand. MacArthur had decided as soon as he had reached Australia that the key to its defense lay not on the Australian mainland but in New Guinea. The U.S. Army typically required divisions to train as a unit for a full year before entering combat. The 32nd had arrived in Australia in April 1942, spent several weeks building its first camp, was transported to a new camp in July, and nearly one third of its troops had been in boot camp only five months previously. Nonetheless U.S. officers decided it was the most combat-ready unit in Australia.

Even though the division had less than two months of jungle warfare training, MacArthur ordered parts of the 32nd Division to Papua New Guinea on 13 September 1942. Because the situation was critical and time was short, 5th Air Force commander General George Kenney suggested that he could transport the first regiment by air. This had never been attempted before, so Company E, 126th IR, was used to test the concept. At dawn on 15 September 1942, the unit was flown from Amberly Field in Brisbane to Port Moresby. The remainder of the 126th IR boarded ships for Port Moresby beginning on 18 September from Brisbane. The 128th IR was from Townsville, Australia to Port Moresby on the same day. These units would become part of the opening ground offensive against Japanese troops in the Southwest Pacific Area, and MacArthur expected the Americans to quickly and easily advance on and capture the Japanese forward base at Buna.

=== Kapa Kapa Trail march ===
The Australian Army units on New Guinea were under increasing pressure from the Japanese forces who had advanced within of Port Moresby. Anxious to blunt the Japanese attack, and although no white man had crossed using that route since 1917, General Douglas MacArthur issued orders for United States forces to take the Kapa Kapa Trail running parallel to the Kokoda Track. The 32nd&#x27;s Divisional Headquarters and two regimental combat teams formed around the 126th and 128th infantry regiments were deployed to Port Moresby between 15 and 29 September 1942.

MacArthur believed based on available intelligence that the U.S. forces could guard the right flank of the Australian forces and entrap the Imperial Japanese troops between the two allied forces. Beginning on 14 October 900 troops of the 2nd Battalion, 114th Engineer Battalion, 19th Portable Hospital, and the 107th Quartermaster Company of 126th Infantry, commanded by Lt. Col. Henry A. Geerds, departed in stages from Karekodobu, nicknamed &quot;Kalamazoo&quot; by the GIs who had a hard time pronouncing the local name.

 They were charged with making an extremely difficult trek inland over the Kapa Kapa Trail toward Jaure, where they were to flank the Japanese on the Kokoda Trail. The total distance over the mountains to the Japanese positions was over , and most of the trail was barely a goat path. The men carried only six days rations, expecting to be resupplied en route. The food, however, was very poor, including hardtack, rice and bully beef, some of which had become rancid and sickening many men. They had leather toilet seats but no machetes, insect repellent, waterproof containers for medicine or personal effects, and it rained heavily every day. The men found themselves utterly unprepared for the extremely harsh conditions found in the jungle. The Kapa Kapa trail across the Owen Stanley divide was a &quot;dank and eerie place, rougher and more precipitous&quot; than the Kokoda Track on which the Australians and Japanese were then fighting.

Lead elements of the 126th finally crossed the gap near Mount Obree, which they nicknamed Ghost Mountain, where all of the remaining native porters abandoned the Americans, leaving them to carry their own equipment. On 20 November 1942, after almost 42 days on the trail, crossing exceedingly difficult terrain, including hogback ridges, jungle, and mountainous high-altitude passes, E Company was the first to reach Soputa near the front. The remainder of the battalion trickled in over the next few days. As a result of the extremely difficult march and the decimated ranks of the unit, the battalion earned the nickname of &quot;The Ghost Battalion&quot;. No other troops were tasked with making the same trek.

=== Attack on Buna ===


 Two weeks later the remainder of 128th Regimental Combat Team was flown to Wanigela near the Buna where they joined the Australian 18th Brigade. They were to begin an assault on 16 November 1942 on the main Japanese beachheads in eastern New Guinea.

The 32nd Division was among the first of all US divisions to engage in a ground assault against the enemy in World War II. General Harding was nearly killed before the attack began. The first day of the assault, Harding was on board a sixty-two-foot wooden coastal trawler, the Australian civilian crewed &quot;Minnamurra&quot; that was operating as part of the US Army Small Ships Section, with his headquarters company when it and its convoy carrying important artillery and supplies was attacked by Japanese fighter-bombers. Harding saved himself by diving overboard and swimming to shore. The attack destroyed all five vessels and the supplies Harding was relying on for the upcoming attack. More were sunk over the following days or ran aground. General George Kenney wielded a great deal of influence over MacArthur, and although he had no knowledge of jungle warfare, insisted that tanks had no role in ground action in the jungle, but that the &quot;artillery in this theater flies.&quot; Harding reluctantly accepted MacArthur&#x27;s decision to go ahead with the attack and to rely on direct air support in place of tanks or heavy artillery.

==== Japanese defenses ====
The Japanese were now commanded by Maj. Gen. Kensaku Oda, who succeeded General Horii, who had drowned in the Kumusi River while retreating from their initial attack across the Kokoda Track on Port Moresby. The Japanese at Buna-Gona were unable to dig deep trenches or shelters due to the water table. Instead, they built hundreds of coconut log bunkers. These had mutually supporting lines of fire and were organized in depth. The bunkers were often linked by trenches allowing the Japanese to move at will among them, reinforcing one another.

Buna was General Douglas MacArthur&#x27;s first ground offensive campaign against Japanese troops in World War II. He received intelligence from Brigadier General Charles Willoughby, who told MacArthur before the operation that there was &quot;little indication of an attempt to make a strong stand against the Allied advance.&quot; Other intelligence he received led him to believe that Buna was held by about 1,000 sick and malnourished soldiers. Unfamiliar with the state of Japanese defenses, Lieutenant General Richard K. Sutherland, MacArthur&#x27;s chief of staff, glibly referred to these fortifications as &quot;hasty field entrenchments.&quot;

The division&#x27;s performance in battle under the circumstances was not surprising. It was unprepared for offensive operations against what turned out to be some of the strongest Japanese fortified positions in the South Pacific, and was severely hampered by completely inadequate fire support.

====Harding relieved====
After taking a large number of casualties and making virtually no progress, MacArthur became frustrated with the 32nd Division&#x27;s performance and gave Major General Robert Eichelberger authority to remove Harding, which Eichelberger promptly did. Eichelberger then ordered a two-day pause in operations, had hot food brought to the front, got additional supplies moved forward, and was able to get the detached 128th restored to the division. These were all actions that Harding had requested and been denied.

==== Casualties and refitting ====
U. S. Air Force historian Stanley Falk wrote, &quot;The Papuan campaign was one of the costliest Allied victories of the Pacific war in terms of casualties per troops committed.&quot; Of the 9,825 men of the 32nd Division who entered combat, the division suffered 2,520 battle casualties, including 586 killed in action. More telling was the huge number who were casualties due to illness: 7,125 (66%, with 2,952 requiring hospitalization), and 100 more died from other causes. The total casualty count of 9,956 exceeded the division&#x27;s entire battle strength.

The Ghost Mountain Boys of the 2/126th were especially hard hit. When Buna was taken they finished the fight with only six officers and 126 troops standing out of the 900 plus who had started out from Kapa Kapa. The extremely difficult march by the U.S. 2/126th from Kapa Kapa to Jaure and the brutal combat at Buna-Gona taught the Allied armies important lessons that they applied throughout the Pacific Theater and remainder of the war in the Pacific.

===Refit and retrained in Australia===
After the 32nd Division wrapped up operations at Buna, the men were slowly transported to Australia for rest, rehabilitation and training. The first units arrived in Brisbane, Australia on 1 March 1943. The complete move took several weeks because of the limited number of planes available to transport the troops over the Owen Stanley Mountains and the few ships available to get the men from Port Moresby to Australia. The last units arrived in April. Upon arrival, some men spent a few days camped near Brisbane and went into town to get drunk. The division then returned to Camp Cable where it had been stationed before it left for New Guinea.

On 1 March 1943, Major General William H. Gill at Camp Carson, Colorado was ordered to Australia to assume command of the division. After a period of rest, the division began training to induct the many replacements into its ranks and help them incorporate the lessons of jungle warfare the division had gained in battle. The troops also received six weeks&#x27; amphibious training.

During March, the 107th Quartermaster Battalion was reorganized as the 32nd Quartermaster Company, and the ordnance detachment was redesignated the 732nd Ordnance Company. The 121st Field Artillery Battalion&#x27;s 155 mm howitzers were replaced with 75 mm howitzers.

=== Return to New Guinea===

By October 1943 the division was ready for combat and moved back to New Guinea. From 16 to 30 October 1943 the 32nd Division was moved from Australia back to New Guinea. At Milne Bay and Goodenough Island they continued their training and prepared for future combat operations.

During December 1943 the U.S. Sixth Army was given the mission to capture Saidor with the goal to cut off the Japanese retreat from Finschhafen. The 32nd division formed the majority of the Michaelmas Task Force given the assignment to help establish a blocking position at Saidor with the intent to trap an entire Japanese division at Sio. They were charged with seizing the airfield at Saidor and securing the surrounding area. The main combat power for the task force was the 126th Infantry.

=== Operation Cartwheel and Western New Guinea ===

On 2 January 1944, the 32nd Division took part in Operation Cartwheel, part of MacArthur&#x27;s &quot;leap-frog&quot; operational plan to take strategic points to use as forward bases. MacArthur sent Allied forces westward along the northern coast of New Guinea in a sequence of operations against selected locations that would provide landing fields for aircraft. This was designed to provide his ground forces with continued close air support and deny the enemy sea and airborne resupply, effectively cutting the Japanese forces off as they were under attack.

=== Landing at Saidor===

Elements of the 32nd&#x27;s 126th Infantry Regimental Combat Team landed at Saidor on the north coast of New Guinea and helped to end enemy resistance there on 14 April 1944. On 23 April, elements took part in the landing at Aitape, the division arriving on 3 May. After meeting slight initial resistance, the 32nd had to withstand savage counterattacks in the Driniumor River area.

By 31 August, Aitape was secured and the division rested. Elements landed on Morotai on 15 September. The 32nd&#x27;s command post opened at Hollandia, Dutch New Guinea on 1 October, setting the stage for the advance into the Philippines.

=== Philippines battles ===
==== Battle of Leyte ====
The Battle of Leyte was the invasion and conquest of Leyte in the Philippines by American and Filipino guerrilla forces under the command of MacArthur. The U.S. forces fought Japanese Army forces led by General Tomoyuki Yamashita. The battle took place from 17 October to 31 December 1944 and launched the Philippines campaign of 1944–45, the goal of which was to recapture and liberate the entire Philippine Archipelago and to end almost three years of Japanese occupation. The 32nd was in reserve and was not deployed to Leyte until 14 November when it was assigned to the US X Corps. It relieved the 24th Infantry Division and went into action along the Pinamopoan-Ormoc highway, taking Limon and smashing the Yamashita line in bitter hand-to-hand combat. The division linked up with elements of the U.S. 1st Cavalry Division in the vicinity of Lonoy, on 22 December, marking the collapse of Japanese resistance in the upper Oromoc Valley. The division remained on the front lines until the Japanese resistance on Leyte was broken near the end of December.

==== Battle of Luzon ====
From Leyte the division moved to Lingayen Gulf, Luzon, on 27 January 1945. In the Battle of Villa Verde Trail, the 32nd navigated a narrow track through the Caraballo Mountains against heavy Japanese resistance and after 100 days of fighting, it took Imugan and the crossroads town of Santa Fe, Nueva Vizcaya. Four men were awarded the Medal of Honor during its six-week fight up the 27 miles of the Villa Verde Trail: William R. Shockley, David M. Gonzales, Thomas E. Atkins, and Ysmael R. Villegas. It took American troops until the end of June to seize the Cagayan Valley and its food supplies.

On 28 May the 32nd met the 25th Infantry Division near Santa Fe securing Balete Pass, the gateway to the Cagayan Valley. While elements of the division continued mopping-up activities near Imugan, other units moved to rest and rehabilitation centers. Active elements secured the Baguio area, wiped out Japanese forces in the Agno River Valley area, and opened Highway 11 as a supply route. They captured General Tomoyuki Yamashita, who surrendered on 2 September 1945, in Kiangan. &quot;It was a great moment for the 32nd,&quot; wrote Maj. Gen. William H. Gill, commanding general of the Red Arrow Division, &quot;a glorious finish to this long bitter struggle.&quot;

==== End of the war ====
Operations officially ceased on 15 August 1945 when Japan surrendered, although A Company beat off a banzai charge during the morning that killed one soldier and wounded two others, and another 18 hours later in which another soldier died and seven were wounded.

On 9 October, the 32nd Division left Luzon for Japan and occupation duty in a convoy of 31 ships. They arrived on 14 October at Sasebo, Japan on the island of Kyushu. The 32nd stayed in Kyushu until the division was inactivated on 28 February 1946. Among the first to enter combat, and the very last to cease fighting, the 32nd was in combat for 654 days, more than any other United States Army unit during World War II, and eleven of its men were awarded the Medal of Honor. It was estimated the division had killed over 32,000 Japanese soldiers during the war.

=== Many firsts ===
The 32nd Division was the first division to deploy as an entire unit from the United States and the first division to be shipped as a single convoy overseas. Once in the South West Pacific Area, portions of the 128th Infantry were the first to be airlifted into combat, from Australia to Port Moresby, New Guinea.

United States forces first launched amphibious offensive operations against the Japanese during the summer and fall of 1942. These were led by the 1st Marine and the Americal divisions on Guadalcanal beginning on 7 August, followed by Carlson&#x27;s Raiders on Makin Island on 17 August.

On 16 November the 32nd became the first U.S. forces to launch a ground assault against Japanese forces. They were followed by the 163rd Regimental Combat Team of the 41st Infantry Division, which arrived at Port Moresby, New Guinea on 27 December, and whose first elements flew over the Owen Stanley Range to the Buna Gona front on 30 December. On the Atlantic front, the first units to engage in a ground assault were the 1st Infantry, 3rd Infantry, 9th Infantry, 1st Armored and the 2nd Armored Divisions in North Africa on 8 November.

In another first, the four gun sections of Battery A of the 129th Field Artillery became the first howitzers flown into a war, first carried to Port Moresby by a B-17 bomber. Then one half of Battery A, 129th Field Artillery, a single 105 mm howitzer, was air-lifted in pieces by three Douglas C-47 Skytrain aircraft over the Owen Stanley Range to Buna, becoming the first U.S. Army artillery flown into combat in World War II.

At Saidor, they became the first U.S. division to make a beach landing in the New Guinea campaign. They were the first to employ General MacArthur&#x27;s &quot;by-pass strategy,&quot; leaving some Japanese units alone and attacking behind them to cut them off from their lines of supply. In the battle for Aitape, they were the first division to simultaneously supply 11 battalions in combat in one action completely by airdrop. Later on, in the Battle of Leyte, they were the first to supply four infantry battalions for two days from artillery liaison &quot;Cub&quot; planes. They were the first to publish an American servicemen&#x27;s letterpress newspaper (the &quot;Stalker&quot;) in the Southwest Pacific. Finally, elements of the 32nd Division were among the first American occupation troops to land in Japan.

=== Division march ===
Theodore Steinmetz wrote and conducted the words to a march song about the unit&#x27;s origins and tenacity.

=== Post-war criticism ===
In 1949, U.S. Air Force General George Kenney published &quot;General Kenney Reports&quot;, a personal history of the air war he commanded from 1942 to 1945. In it he praised Australian Generals George Vasey and George Wootten, commanders of the 7th and 9th Divisions, but he also criticized Australian Lieutenant General Sydney Rowell, who was dismissed by General Edmund Herring for insubordination. He said Rowell had a &quot;defeatist attitude.&quot; Of the U.S. 32nd Division, he said the troops &quot;were green and the officers were not controlling them.&quot; He quoted General Herring and Major General Sir Thomas Blamey as critical of the 32nd&#x27;s efforts. Kenney said the 32nd sat in the jungle for 10 days &quot;doing nothing but worrying about the rain and the strange noises at night.&quot;

In a letter to General Herring in 1959, General Eichelberger responded to criticism about Herring&#x27;s dismissal of General Rowell and his dismissal of General Harding:

=== Decorations and citations ===
At the conclusion of the Buna Campaign in April 1943, the division was sent to Australia for recuperation, replacement, and re-training. On 6 May 1943, the 32nd Division was awarded the Distinguished Unit Citation, a streamer embroidered &quot;Papua&quot;, for &quot;outstanding performance of duty in action during the period 23 July 1942 to 23 January 1943.&quot; The citation read:

It was also recognized by the Philippine government for its efforts in the battles for Leyte and Luzon with the Philippine Presidential Unit Citation, the streamer embroidered, &quot;17 OCTOBER 1944 TO 4 JULY 1945&quot;.

== Recent history ==

The division was recreated within the Army National Guard after the end of the Second World War in 1946. In 1954, it comprised the 127th, 128th, and 426th Infantry Regiments, 120th, 121st, 126th, and 129th Field Artillery Battalions, 132nd Antiaircraft Artillery Battalion, 132nd Tank Battalion, and other units, including the 724th Engineer Battalion.
On 6 September 1961, with the heightening of the tensions due to the Berlin Crisis, the 32nd Infantry Division was alerted to an impending call-up. The commanding general, Major General Herbert A. Smith was notified a few days later that the division was to report on 15 October 1961 to Fort Lewis, Washington, for active duty. This was exactly 21 years after their activation date for World War II, at which time then Lt. Col. Herbert A. Smith had been commander of the 2nd Battalion, 128th Infantry. The unit served until August 1962 at Fort Lewis, Washington, and was assigned to the Strategic Army Command. The division began training as replacements for the 4th Infantry and the 2nd Armored Divisions at Fort Lewis, Washington, and Fort Hood, Texas, in case they were deployed overseas as reinforcements for the Seventh Army in Germany. They returned to Wisconsin without being deployed overseas.

The 32nd Division (as were all U.S. infantry divisions at the time) was organized in a Pentomic division, composed of five line (rifle) companies, a combat support company, and a headquarters company. From 1940 until 1959, divisions had contained three regiments. This divisional structure was found unwieldy and was eliminated in 1963.

=== Reorganized as brigade combat team ===
In 1967, the 32nd Division—by then made up entirely of Wisconsin units—was inactivated and reorganized as the non-divisional 32nd Separate Infantry Brigade. In 1971, the brigade was converted to mechanized infantry. In 1997, the 32nd reorganized from a separate to a divisional brigade, reducing in the process the staff of its headquarters from 300 down to 85.

After it was converted back to light infantry, Army officials designated the 32nd an &quot;enhanced&quot; brigade, eligible for a higher level of funding and other resources than most National Guard brigades receive. Changing the brigade&#x27;s shape to fit the profile of a light brigade also meant significant benefits for the unit and for the state, including more than US$6 million a year in additional federal funds to operate units and provide training and logistics support. This also meant an increase in the number of physical assets, such as trucks and scoop loaders, which are available to the state in an emergency.

Major changes in the structure of the 32nd Infantry Brigade included:

* One new infantry battalion—the 2nd Battalion, 128th Infantry—was formed to fill the brigade&#x27;s three-battalion infantry complement.
* The 173rd Engineer Battalion and the 1st Battalion, 632nd Armor, were inactivated. Similar or related missions were assigned to new, smaller units—the 32nd Engineer Company and Troop E, 105th Cavalry, a light reconnaissance unit.
* The 1st Battalion, 120th Field Artillery converted from the 155 mm self-propelled howitzer to the more easily transported 105 mm towed howitzer.
* The brigade added an intelligence unit, the 232nd Military Intelligence Company.
* New detachments were formed in the 132nd Support Battalion to provide transportation support to the brigade&#x27;s three infantry battalions. New equipment that replaced M48 Patton Tanks, M75 and M59 Armored Personnel Carriers (APCs), the M14 rifle and the M67 recoilless rifle were M60 Series Tanks, M113 Series APCs, the M16 rifle and the M47 Dragon.

The 32nd Brigade headquarters moved from Madison to Camp Douglas and Wausau, locations more central to the brigade&#x27;s statewide units.

The changing mission of the 32nd Separate Infantry Brigade (Mech.) from mechanized to light infantry also brought many changes for the Maneuver Area Training Equipment Site (MATES) at Fort McCoy. The 32nd is part of the Wisconsin Army National Guard. MATES is owned and operated by the State of Wisconsin and the Wisconsin Army Guard so it is tasked to support the 32nd&#x27;s equipment needs. MATES was required to bring 32nd equipment not necessary for light infantry, such as M1 tanks and M113 APCs up to Army standards so they can be re-distributed to other units.

In February 2009, the 32nd Brigade deployed 3,200 members on a fourteen-month deployment to Iraq, its largest deployment since World War II.

==Legacy==
Several people who served in the division gained notability during and after their time in the division. In World War I, PFC Joseph William Guyton (1889–1918), became the first American killed on German-held territory, earning him the French Croix de guerre. During World War II, notable members of the division included Captain Herman Bottcher, recipient of two Distinguished Service Cross Medals, Captain William &quot;Bill&quot; Walter Kouts, and Private John Rawls, recipient of a Bronze Star who later became a political philosopher.

Additionally, eleven men were awarded the Medal of Honor while serving with the division, all for action during World War II. They include PFC Thomas E. Atkins, Private Donald R. Lobaugh, PFC David M. Gonzales, Staff Sergeant Ysmael R. Villegas, PFC Dirk J. Vlug, Staff Sergeant Gerald L. Endl, Sergeant Kenneth E. Gruennert, First Sergeant Elmer J. Burr, Sergeant Leroy Johnson, PFC William A. McWhorter, and PFC William R. Shockley.

For its efforts in both World Wars, the division has been honored and memorialized by communities throughout the United States and Philippines for its actions. Some of these memorials include:

* The 32nd Division March song, written by Theodore Steinmetz, is still played by marching bands to this day.
* Wisconsin Highway 32 (WIS 32), as well as a portion of former U.S. Route 12 in Michigan (now Red Arrow Highway), are named in honor of the 32nd Infantry Division, and all WIS 32 markers carry the Red Arrow insignia. A memorial plaque describing the division is located at southern end of WIS 32 on Sheridan Road in Kenosha County, Wisconsin. Ceremonies were held along the route and included veterans of the Grand Rapids Guard, which had been part of the Thirty-second Division during both world wars.
* Lowell High School in Lowell, Michigan, adopted the nickname &quot;Red Arrows&quot; in honor of the 32nd Infantry Division shortly after their return.
* A memorial to the division was built in San Nicolas, Pangasinan, Philippines. It is inscribed, &quot;Erected by the officers and men of the 32d Infantry Division United States Army in memory of their gallant comrades who were killed along the Villa Verde Trail 30 January 1945 – 28 May 1945&quot;.

* The Red Arrow Elementary School in Hartford, Michigan, is named for the division
* The Red Arrow High School in San Nicolas, Pangasinan, Philippines was named in honor of the division
* Milwaukee built the Red Arrow Park dedicated to the men of the 32nd Red Arrow Division who came from Wisconsin following World War I. When Interstate 43 was built over the site, the park was relocated to a site just north of Milwaukee City Hall at E. State Street and N. Water Street. On 11 November 1984, the city dedicated a red granite monument at the park. At its base is inscribed &quot;Les Terribles&quot;.
* Red Arrow Park in Kenosha, Wisconsin, is dedicated to the division.
* Red Arrow Park in Manitowoc, Wisconsin, is dedicated to the division.
* Red Arrow Park in Marinette, Wisconsin, is dedicated to the division.
* A memorial to the division was built in Arcadia, Wisconsin. It bears the inscription:
* Veterans of Foreign Wars Post #1527 &quot;The Red Arrow Post&quot; in Portage, Michigan is named in their honor.
* Veterans of Foreign Wars Post #5003 &quot;Cockle-Lemanski Post&quot; in Bronson, Michigan, is named in part after Benedict P. Lemanski, a private first class in the 32nd Infantry Division who was killed in action on 28 December 1942.

===Notable former members===
*Ray M. Atcherson, served as a sergeant in the 119th Machine Gun Battalion in World War I. After the war, served as a Wisconsin state legislator.
*Byron Darnton, served with the 32nd Division in World War I. Later served as a war correspondent for &quot;The New York Times&quot; in World War II and died in the Pacific

<text>Kenneth Reese &quot;Ken&quot; Cole Jr. (January 27, 1938 – August 16, 2001) was an aide to President Richard Nixon, serving his entire administration from 1969 to Nixon&#x27;s resignation in 1974. He continued to work in the White House under Gerald Ford.

Cole worked at the J. Walter Thompson advertising agency under H. R. Haldeman and went with Haldeman to work on the Nixon campaign in 1969. When Nixon was elected, he entered government, working as an assistant to John Ehrlichman and in 1974 became assistant to the president for domestic affairs.

Cole was not implicated in the Watergate scandal—his name does not even appear in Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein&#x27;s book &quot;All the President&#x27;s Men&quot;.

He died in Willsboro, New York, at age 63.

<text>Dominica competed at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece, from 13 to 29 August 2004. The country&#x27;s participation at Athens marked its third appearance in the Summer Olympics since its debut in the 1996 Summer Olympics. Two track and field athletes, Chris Lloyd and Marie-Lyne Joseph were selected to represent the nation, the latter by a wildcard place as the nation had no other athletes that met either the &quot;A&quot; or &quot;B&quot; qualifying standards apart from Lloyd. Lloyd was selected as flag bearer for the opening ceremony.

==Athletics ==

Dominican athletes have so far achieved qualifying standards in the following athletics events (up to a maximum of 3 athletes in each event at the &#x27;A&#x27; Standard, and 1 at the &#x27;B&#x27; Standard).

<text>The Supreme Court of Sweden (, HD) is the supreme court and the third and final instance in all civil and criminal cases in the Kingdom of Sweden. Before a case can be decided by the Supreme Court, leave to appeal must be obtained, and with few exceptions, leave to appeal can be granted only when the case is of interest as a precedent. The Supreme Court consists of 16 Justices () who are appointed by the government, but the court as an institution is independent of the Riksdag, and the Government is not able to interfere with the decisions of the court.

==History==
Historically, all judicial power was vested in the Monarch, but in 1614 Gustavus Adolphus instituted Svea Court of Appeal and authorized it to issue sentences in his name. Those not satisfied with sentencing were able to turn directly to the monarch, and appeals were handled by the Justice Department of the Privy Council (in ), a committee of that council.

Under the rule of King Gustav III, the noble Privy Council was suspended in 1789 after the Riksdag of the estates introduced an addition to the instrument of government from 1772 called the Union and Security Act. After the Riksdag ended, the King on 15 May instituted the King&#x27;s Supreme Court () to handle legal matters. There were twelve judges of the court, half of which was to be nobles and half commoners. While in session, no more than eight judges could serve at the same time, and with equal numbers of nobles and commoners. In the court, the king held two votes, as well as the deciding vote in case of a tie. However, this voting right was never exercised, except on the centennial of the court, when King Oscar II took part in the decision of one case.

Under the 1809 Instrument of Government, the judges of the Supreme Court became salaried civil servants, with the title of Councillor of Justice (&quot;justitieråd&quot;). The earlier Lord High Steward or Justiciar (&quot;Riksdrots&quot;) became the new Minister of State for Justice (or Prime Minister for Justice) and the foremost member of the court in 1809, but when the modern government ministries were created in 1840, this minister of justice were separated from the court. In 1844 the requirement on equal numbers of noblemen and commoners in service as judges of the court was dropped.

In 1909, the Supreme Administrative Court (&quot;Regeringsrätten&quot;) and the Council on Legislation (&quot;Lagrådet&quot;) were created to assume certain tasks that had been handled by the Supreme Court. The Supreme Administrative Court assumed responsibility for ruling on administrative cases and the Legal Council received the responsibility for judicial review (strictly speaking legal preview). At the same time the monarch lost voting power in the court.

The right to appeal cases to the Supreme Court was limited for the first time in 1915. A special dispensation was required before trying a minor civil or criminal case. Dispensation was to be given when there was a ruling that could become a precedent, and in 1945 this requirement was extended to all cases.

In 1948, the legal procedure was supplemented with oral proceedings and to satisfy the need for additional space the Supreme Court was moved in 1949 from the Royal Palace to the Bonde Palace on Stadsholmen.

By the Instrument of Government of 1974 the Supreme Court discontinued the practice to award sentencing in the name of the Swedish monarch (&quot;Kungl Maj:t&quot;), as well as announcing them at the Royal Palace where they were adorned with the royal seal.

<text>The Bonde Palace () is a palace in Gamla stan, the old town in central Stockholm, Sweden. Located between the House of Knights (&quot;Riddarhuset&quot;) and the Chancellery House (&quot;Kanslihuset&quot;), it is, arguably, the most prominent monument of the era of the Swedish Empire (1611–1718), originally designed by Nicodemus Tessin the Elder and Jean De la Vallée in 1662-1667 as the private residence of the Lord High Treasurer Gustaf Bonde (1620–1667) it still bears his name, while it accommodated the Stockholm Court House from the 18th century and since 1949 houses the Swedish Supreme Court. On the south side of the building is the street Myntgatan and the square Riddarhustorget, while the alleys Riddarhusgränd and Rådhusgränd are passing on its western and eastern sides.

==History==

The original design by Simon de la Vallée and Tessin the Younger, based on French Baroque and Renaissance prototypes, was H-shaped in plan, the planned two southern wings flanking a main court, while the northern wings surrounded a small Baroque garden. The central building was covered by a tall steep-pitched, copper-dressed roof surrounded by the cupolas of the corner pavilions, while the façades were decorated with Ionic pilasters, festoons and portraits of Roman Emperors. The Reduction in 1680 (e.g. the Crown recapturing lands earlier granted the nobility) dramatically reduced the financial power of the Bonde dynasty, and therefore, following the devastating fire of the royal palace Tre Kronor in 1697, the Royal Library and the Svea Court of Appeal were lodged in the Bonde palace. The original elaborated roof was destroyed in a fire in 1710, the original cupolas, however, are still preserved on the northern wings. In 1730, the palace was finally bought by the city in order to relocate the Town Hall from the central square Stortorget, thus definitively ending the buildings history as a private palace.
The reconstruction following another fire in 1753 produced much of the present shape of the building; the design of Johan Eberhard Carlberg resulting in the construction of the southern wings to the original plans, the addition of a new top floor, and an up-to-date low hipped roof; the present interior still reflecting the taste of the mid 18th century. As a City Hall, the palace commenced its central role in Swedish legal history by witnessing several dramatic historical events, including the public flogging of Jacob Johan Anckarström in 1792, and the mob beating of statesman Axel von Fersen the Younger to death in 1810.

As the bridge Vasabron, extending the alley Riddarhusgränd between the Bonde Palace and the House Knights, was constructed in the 1870s, proposals were made to adapt the width of the narrow alley to that of the new bridge, plans effectively suggesting the demolition of the palace. The plans were, however, never carried through, and one of the bridge&#x27;s roadways is forced to make a detour around the still intact palace. During the 19th century, the building gradually failed to accommodate the court house, and as a new court house was finally built on Kungsholmen in 1915, the palace was to accommodate various municipal offices instead, the gradual decay that followed resulting in a second proposed demolition in 1920. The building was however restored in 1925, using the original white colour of the façades.

In 1948, the building was transferred from the city to the state. A comprehensive restoration led by the architect Ivar Tengbom, including the reinforcement of the foundations, the replacement of the windows, and interior lightwells being used for installations, transformed the decayed structure to its present classical shape; the updated interiors designed by Carl Malmsten, however, making the interior connote the 1940s. Additional restorations in 1986 and 2003–2004, have carefully focused on the building&#x27;s origin from the 17th and 18th centuries using original materials and craftsmanship as far as possible while adapting the offices of the Supreme Court to modern requirements regarding accessibility and security. The building is today classified as a historical monument of national interest administered and maintained by the Swedish National Property Board (&quot;Statens Fastighetsverk&quot;).

<text>Latvia competed at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece, from 13 to 29 August 2004. This was the nation&#x27;s eighth appearance at the Summer Olympics.

The Latvian Olympic Committee sent the nation&#x27;s smallest delegation to the Games since the breakup of the Soviet Union. A total of 32 athletes, 22 men and 10 women, competed only in 11 sports. Fourteen athletes had previously competed in Sydney, including silver medalist Aigars Fadejevs in men&#x27;s race walk, defending Olympic champion Igors Vihrovs in men&#x27;s floor exercises, and judoka and bronze medalist Vsevolods Zeļonijs. Pistol shooter and former Olympic champion Afanasijs Kuzmins, the oldest of the team, at age 57, became the first Latvian athlete to compete in seven Olympic games (including three of his appearances under the Soviet Union). Meanwhile, javelin thrower and Latvia&#x27;s top Olympic medal contender Vadims Vasiļevskis was appointed by the committee to become the nation&#x27;s flag bearer in the opening ceremony.

Latvia left Athens with a total of four Olympic silver medals, surpassing a single short of the overall tally from Sydney. Three of these medals were awarded to the athletes for the first time in men&#x27;s javelin throw, modern pentathlon, and weightlifting. Gymnast Jevgēņijs Saproņenko claimed another sporting medal for his team with a silver in the men&#x27;s vault exercises, adding it to a prestigious gold from Igors Vihrovs in Sydney four years earlier.

<text>Delta Pavonis, Latinized from δ Pavonis, is a single star in the southern constellation of Pavo. It has an apparent visual magnitude of 3.56, making it a fourth-magnitude star that is visible to the naked eye from the southern hemisphere. Parallax measurements yield an estimated distance of from Earth. This makes it one of the nearest bright stars to the Solar System. It is approaching the Sun with a radial velocity of −23.5 km/s, and is predicted to come as close as in around 49,200 years.

==Observations==
This object is a subgiant of spectral type G8 IV; it will stop fusing hydrogen at its core relatively soon, starting the process of becoming a red giant. Hence, Delta Pavonis is 24% brighter than the Sun, but the effective temperature of its outer atmosphere is less: 5,571 K. Its mass is 105% of Sol&#x27;s mass, with a mean radius 120% of Sol&#x27;s radius. Delta Pavonis&#x27;s surface convection zone extends downward to about 43.1% of the star&#x27;s radius, but only contains 4.8% of the star&#x27;s mass.

Spectroscopic examination of Delta Pavonis shows that it has a higher abundance of elements heavier than helium (metallicity) than does the Sun. This value is typically given in terms of the ratio of iron (chemical symbol Fe) to hydrogen (H) in a star&#x27;s atmosphere, relative to that in Sol&#x27;s atmosphere (iron being a good proxy for the presence of other heavy elements). The metallicity of Delta Pavonis is approximately

:formula_1

This notation gives the logarithm of the iron-to-hydrogen ratio, relative to that of the Sun, meaning that Delta Pavonis&#x27;s iron abundance is 214% of that of Sol. It is considered super metal-rich, and the high metallicity has slowed its evolution. Studies have shown a correlation between abundant heavy elements in stars, and the presence of a planetary system, so Delta Pavonis has a greater than average probability of harboring planets.

The age of Delta Pavonis is approximately 6.6 to 6.9 billion years, and is certainly in the  billion year range. It appears to be rotating slowly, with a projected rotational velocity of 0.32 kilometers per second.

==Possible planetary system==
The existence of a Jupiter-mass gas giant on a long-period orbit around Delta Pavonis is suspected, as of 2021, based on astrometric data. A study in 2023 detected a trend in the star&#x27;s radial velocity, which may indicate the presence of a planetary companion, supporting the previous astrometric result. Such a planet would, at minimum, orbit with a period of 37 years at a distance of , and have a mass at least ().

==SETI==
Delta Pavonis has been identified by Maggie Turnbull and Jill Tarter of the SETI Institute as the &quot;Best SETI target&quot; among the 100 closest G-type stars. Properties in its favor include a high metallicity, minimal level of magnetic activity, low rotation rate, and kinematic membership in the thin disk population of the Milky Way. Gas giants orbiting in, near, or through a star&#x27;s habitable zone may destabilize the orbits of terrestrial planets in that zone; the lack of detected radial velocity variation suggests that there are no such gas giants orbiting Delta Pavonis. However, observation has detected no artificial radio sources. Delta Pavonis, a close photometric match to the Sun, is the nearest solar analog that is not a member of a binary or multiple star system.

<doc id="932823" wikidata="Q420566" url="?curid=932823" title="Calcineurin">
<text>Calcineurin (CaN) is a calcium and calmodulin dependent serine/threonine protein phosphatase (also known as protein phosphatase 3, and calcium-dependent serine-threonine phosphatase). It activates the T cells of the immune system and can be blocked by drugs. Calcineurin activates nuclear factor of activated T cell cytoplasmic (NFATc), a transcription factor, by dephosphorylating it. The activated NFATc is then translocated into the nucleus, where it upregulates the expression of interleukin 2 (IL-2), which, in turn, stimulates the growth and differentiation of the T cell response. Calcineurin is the target of a class of drugs called calcineurin inhibitors, which include ciclosporin, voclosporin, pimecrolimus and tacrolimus.

== Structure ==
Calcineurin is a heterodimer of a 61-kD calmodulin-binding catalytic subunit, calcineurin A and a 19-kD Ca2+-binding regulatory subunit, calcineurin B. There are three isozymes of the catalytic subunit, each encoded by a separate gene (PPP3CA, PPP3CB, and PPP3CC) and two isoforms of the regulatory, also encoded by separate genes (PPP3R1, PPP3R2).

== Mechanism of action ==

When an antigen-presenting cell interacts with a T cell receptor on T cells, there is an increase in the cytoplasmic level of calcium, which activates calcineurin by binding a regulatory subunit and activating calmodulin binding. Calcineurin induces transcription factors (NFATs) that are important in the transcription of IL-2 genes. IL-2 activates T-helper lymphocytes and induces the production of other cytokines. In this way, it governs the action of cytotoxic lymphocytes. The amount of IL-2 being produced by the T-helper cells is believed to influence the extent of the immune response significantly.

== Clinical relevance ==

=== Rheumatic diseases ===

Calcineurin inhibitors are prescribed for adult rheumatoid arthritis (RA) as a single drug or in combination with methotrexate. The microemulsion formulation is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for treatment of severely active RA. It is also prescribed for: psoriatic arthritis, psoriasis, acute ocular Behçet&#x27;s disease, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, adult and juvenile polymyositis and dermatomyositis, adult and juvenile systemic lupus erythematosus, adult lupus membranous nephritis, systemic sclerosis, aplastic anemia, steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome, atopic dermatitis, severe corticosteroid-dependent asthma, severe ulcerative colitis, pemphigus vulgaris, myasthenia gravis, and dry eye disease, with or without Sjögren&#x27;s syndrome (administered as ophthalmic emulsion).

=== Schizophrenia ===

Calcineurin is linked to receptors for several brain chemicals including glutamate, dopamine and GABA. An experiment with genetically-altered mice that could not produce calcineurin showed similar symptoms as in humans with schizophrenia: impairment in working memory, attention deficits, aberrant social behavior, and several other abnormalities characteristic of schizophrenia.

=== Diabetes ===

Calcineurin along with NFAT, may improve the function of diabetics&#x27; pancreatic beta cells. Thus tacrolimus contributes to the frequent development of new diabetes following renal transplantation.

Calcineurin/NFAT signaling is required for perinatal lung maturation and function.

=== Organ transplantation ===
Calcineurin inhibitors such as tacrolimus and ciclosporin are used to suppress the immune system in organ allotransplant recipients to prevent rejection of the transplanted tissue.

== Interactions ==

Calcineurin has been shown to interact with RCAN1 and AKAP5.

<text>Monument Avenue is a tree-lined grassy mall dividing the eastbound and westbound traffic in Richmond, Virginia, originally named for its emblematic complex of structures honoring those who fought for the Confederacy during the American Civil War. Between 1900 and 1925, Monument Avenue greatly expanded with architecturally significant houses, churches, and apartment buildings. Four of the bronze statues representing J. E. B. Stuart, Stonewall Jackson, Jefferson Davis and Matthew Fontaine Maury were removed from their memorial pedestals amidst civil unrest in July 2020. The Robert E. Lee monument was handled differently as it was owned by the Commonwealth, in contrast with the other monuments which were owned by the city. Dedicated in 1890, it was removed on September 8, 2021. All these monuments, including their pedestals, have now been removed completely from the Avenue. The last remaining statue on Monument Avenue is the Arthur Ashe Monument, memorializing the African-American tennis champion, dedicated in 1996.

In the wake of the protests that followed the murder of George Floyd in 2020, the Davis monument was torn down by protestors, while the Lee monument was ordered to be removed by Governor Ralph Northam. In July 2020, Richmond mayor Levar Stoney directed removal of the remaining Confederate monuments on city-owned land including J.E.B. Stuart, Stonewall Jackson, Matthew Fontaine Maury, the cannons marking the Richmond Defenses, and other monuments around the Richmond area. Public opinion regarding the removal or retention of the statues was mostly split in several polls down the middle, with other varying figures for retention with historical context or moving them elsewhere. 

Monument Avenue is the site of several annual events, particularly in the spring, including an annual Monument Avenue 10K race and &quot;Easter on Parade&quot;, when many Richmonders stroll the avenue wearing Easter bonnets and other finery. Prior to 2020, at various times (such as Robert E. Lee&#x27;s birthday and Confederate History Month), the Sons of Confederate Veterans gathered along Monument Avenue in period military costumes.

&quot;Monument Avenue Historic District&quot; includes the part of Monument Avenue beginning at the traffic circle in the east at the intersection of West Franklin Street and North Lombardy Street, extending westward for some fourteen blocks to Roseneath Avenue, and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places as a National Historic Landmark District.

The American Planning Association selected Monument Avenue as one of the &quot;10 Great Streets in America for 2007&quot; based upon the corridor&#x27;s historical residential design and craftsmanship, diversity of land uses, the integration of multiple forms of transportation, and the commitment of the community to preserve its legacy.

==History==
The former capital of the Confederacy, Richmond became a central location of the Lost Cause of the Confederacy mythos. The Southern economy was largely devastated due to the war; former Confederates therefore held onto their pride and demanded respect. Monument Avenue was conceived during a site search for a memorial statue of General Robert E. Lee after Lee&#x27;s death in 1870. Richmond citizens had been wanting to erect statues for three Virginians who had helped defend the city (two of whom were killed in the defense). City plans as early as 1887 show the proposed site, a circle of land, just past the end of West Franklin Street, a premier uptown residential avenue at the time. The land was owned by a wealthy Richmonder, Otway C. Allen. The plan for the statue included building a grand avenue extending west lined with trees along a central grassy median, in accordance with the “City Beautiful” style of urban planning and civic design during this time. The plan shows building plots which Allen intended to sell to developers and those wishing to build houses on the new grand avenue.

On May 29, 1890, crowds were estimated at 100,000 to view the unveiling of the first monument, a massive memorial to Robert E. Lee.

It would take about 10 years for wealthy Richmonders and speculative developers to start buying the lots and building houses along the avenue, but in the years between 1900 and 1925 Monument Avenue exploded with architecturally significant houses, churches and apartment buildings. The architects who built on Monument Avenue practiced in the region and nationally, and included the firms of John Russell Pope, William Bottomley, Duncan Lee, Marcellus Wright, Claude Howell, Henry Baskervill, D. Wiley Anderson and Albert Huntt. Speculative builders such as W. J. Payne, Harvey C. Brown and the Davis Brothers bought lots and built many houses to sell to those not designing with an architect.

The street was once a favored residential area for Richmond&#x27;s upper class. The Fan District section, in particular, is lined with large mansions from the end of the Gilded Age. The Museum District part of Monument Avenue includes a combination of large houses (especially in the 3100 block), apartment buildings, and smaller single-family houses. West of Interstate 195, Monument Avenue becomes a more typically suburban avenue, although it continues the wide lanes and expansive grassy median with a variety of trees through to its termination a little over two miles past the current city limits in Henrico County.

Through the decades, the avenue has had its ups and downs. As early as 1910, but mostly during the 1950s and &#x27;60s, many of the large homes were subdivided into apartments, or interior rooms and carriage houses were let to boarders as Richmond&#x27;s upper class largely abandoned Monument Avenue for newer suburban neighborhoods in the West End many of which are outside the city limits in predominantly white Henrico County. A few houses were demolished to make way for parking lots or building expansions, and several modern additions were tucked between earlier existing buildings. But protections put in place by the city by designating Monument Avenue as an Old and Historic Neighborhood have helped maintain the integrity of the neighborhood. In 1969, a group was incorporated called The Residents and Associates for the Preservation of Monument Avenue, led by Zayde Rennolds Dotts (Mrs. Walter Dotts, Jr.), granddaughter of Beulah and John Kerr Branch, a banker who had commissioned a Jacobean mansion on Monument Avenue in 1914 by the firm of John Russell Pope. In 1970 the group changed its name to the Monument Avenue Preservation Society (MAPS).

From 1981 to 1988, just over of Monument Avenue between Malvern Avenue (VA 197) and Arthur Ashe Boulevard (VA 161) was officially designated as unsigned State Route 418.

In August 2017, following the Unite the Right rally and a vehicle attack in Charlottesville, Virginia, Richmond Mayor Levar Stoney announced that the city&#x27;s Monument Avenue commission would look at providing contextual markers around the Confederate monuments as an option for dealing with the issues raised by statues honoring men who fought to preserve slavery and fracture the Union. At that time, removal of such statues was not permitted at the local level under Virginia law. In April 2020, the Democratic Party took over the Virginia legislature and changed the law, allowing local jurisdictions to remove monuments other than in cemeteries and the Virginia Military Institute; the changes were to take effect in July 2020. On June 10, 2020, protestors tore down the statue of Jefferson Davis from its pedestal. On the first day the new law was in effect, July 1, 2020, Mayor Stoney had a State of Emergency extended to justify the removal of the statue of Stonewall Jackson by a city of Richmond contract, followed with the removal of the Maury statue and the defensive cannon display on July 2. Mayor Stoney then announced plans to remove a total of 11 Confederate memorials. There was an investigation into the awarding of the contract for removal by Stoney as political patronage, but Augusta County Commonwealth Attorney Tim Martin found because of the circumstances (where most contractors rejected bidding on the removal due to the perception of possible threats against their business for doing so), that the contracted contractor created a new company to carry out the work specifically to avoid those threats, and that the bid price was justified for the circumstances, nor was it connected to the mayor&#x27;s campaign at all, clearing Stoney and the contractor of any wrongdoing.

==Monuments==
Monument Avenue is home to the Arthur Ashe Monument, a memorial to Richmond native Arthur Ashe. Sculpted by Paul DiPasquale, it was unveiled on July 10, 1996.

The Avenue previously included several statues dedicated to Confederate military and political figures, including:
===Robert E. Lee Monument===
The Robert E. Lee Monument was located in the traffic circle at the intersection of Monument Avenue and Allen Street. Dedicated in 1890, the Lee Monument was the first and the largest of the street&#x27;s monuments. It was removed on September 8, 2021 by the Commonwealth of Virginia following a state Supreme Court ruling. At the time it was removed, the Lee statue was the last existing Confederate monument on Monument Avenue.

===J.E.B. Stuart Monument===

The J. E. B. Stuart Monument was located in the traffic circle at the intersection of West Franklin Street and North Lombardy Street. 
The statue of Stuart was removed by the City of Richmond on July 7, 2020. The empty pedestal stood until February 2022, when it too was removed, and the traffic circle has been made into a garden.

===Jefferson Davis Memorial===

The Jefferson Davis Memorial was located at the intersection of Monument Avenue and North Davis Street. 
The statue was toppled on June 10, 2020, during the protests following the murder of George Floyd.

===Stonewall Jackson Monument===

The equestrian statue of Stonewall Jackson was located at the intersection of Monument Avenue and North Boulevard.

Mayor Stoney had the monument removed on July 1, 2020. In February 2022 the empty pedestal was removed and the site has been paved over, making it a &quot;normal&quot; traffic junction.

===Matthew Fontaine Maury Monument===
The monument of Matthew Fontaine Maury was located on Monument Avenue at Belmont Avenue. 
The statue of Maury was removed on July 2, 2020, and the globe followed on July 9. The empty pedestal was removed in February 2022 and the site is now a garden.

===Arthur Ashe Monument===
Nearly a century after the original monuments were put in place, the Richmond community approved a statue of Arthur Ashe by Paul DiPasquale to be placed on Monument Avenue. The statue&#x27;s placement lacked a correlation between the tennis star and the Confederate leaders already represented on the Avenue. Some residents thought the monument should be placed at the Arthur Ashe Athletic Center. The monument became a significant discussion point in the city around the times of its commission and its unveiling. Many of the city&#x27;s residents cited Ashe&#x27;s distinguished place in the modern history of the city as a reason for inclusion, while some residents and other parties rejected it as inappropriate for Monument Avenue, which had contained only statues of men with a relationship to the Confederate States of America.

Ashe&#x27;s statue was the farthest one placed on the Avenue, situated in what is known as the Museum District, just west of the city&#x27;s Fan district. Ashe stands, racket in hand, on a pedestal bearing the Biblical quote: “Since we are surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses, let us lay aside every weight, and the sin which so easily ensnares us, and let us run with endurance the race that is set before us.”

== Controversy ==
The Confederate memorials on Monument Avenue have been a source of controversy from time to time since they were first built. Opponents have pointed to their roots in the &quot;Lost Cause&quot; and Virginia&#x27;s &quot;Massive Resistance&quot; to racial integration of public schools to argue that the statues symbolize white supremacy and should be removed or revised. Proponents of preservation recognize the monuments as veterans&#x27; memorials erected to commemorate the hundreds of thousands of Confederate soldiers and citizens who died fighting to defend Richmond during the Civil War. The removal movement gained momentum following a similar controversy with Charlottesville, Virginia&#x27;s Robert E. Lee statue and the subsequent events of the &quot;Unite The Right&quot; rally on August 11–12, 2017.

In late 2017, Mayor Levar Stoney announced the formation of a &quot;Monument Avenue Commission&quot; that was chartered to solicit the public&#x27;s input and ultimately provide recommendations on the future of the monuments. In mid-2018, the Commission issued its recommendations, calling for the removal of the Jefferson Davis monument while expressing a desire to attach signage &quot;reinterpreting&quot; the Lee, Jackson, Stuart and Maury monuments.

During the 2020 protests that erupted after the murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis, the statues again became a focal point in Richmond. They became a frequent site for both peaceful as well as violent protests. Throughout this period, the statues were covered in graffiti and surrounded with materials such as signs, artwork, candles, and flowers. Richmond-based artists Dustin Klein and Alex Criqui created &quot;Reclaiming the Monument,&quot; a series of light projections that transformed the Confederate statues at night, in particular the Robert E. Lee Monument. In June 2020, Governor Ralph Northam announced he had been working for a full year on plans to remove the Lee monument from the avenue. Immediately following Gov. Northam&#x27;s announcement, Richmond&#x27;s Mayor Stoney announced plans to remove the other four Confederate statues along with seven additional related monuments throughout the city. The City of Richmond began work to remove the city-controlled statues, beginning with the Stonewall Jackson monument, on July 1, 2020. Matthew Maury&#x27;s statue was removed on July 2, and J. E. B. Stuart&#x27;s on July 7. The Lee Monument was removed by the Commonwealth of Virginia on September 8, 2021.

==Disposition of the monuments==
The statues are presently in an open-air industrial area in Richmond, whose location has been withheld. Richmond recently transferred ownership of the fallen memorials to the Black History Museum and Cultural Center of Virginia; it is now up to the institution to decide what to do with them.

In the fall of 2023, the Jefferson Davis statue will travel to Los Angeles, where it will be exhibited as part of a display of toppled Confederate art works.

<doc id="932831" wikidata="Q20710" url="?curid=932831" title="Jean-Martin Charcot">
<text>Jean-Martin Charcot (; 29 November 1825 – 16 August 1893) was a French neurologist and professor of anatomical pathology. He worked on groundbreaking work about hypnosis and hysteria, in particular with his hysteria patient Louise Augustine Gleizes. Charcot is known as &quot;the founder of modern neurology&quot;, and his name has been associated with at least 15 medical eponyms, including various conditions sometimes referred to as Charcot diseases.

Charcot has been referred to as &quot;the father of French neurology and one of the world&#x27;s pioneers of neurology&quot;. His work greatly influenced the developing fields of neurology and psychology; modern psychiatry owes much to the work of Charcot and his direct followers. He was the &quot;foremost neurologist of late nineteenth-century France&quot; and has been called &quot;the Napoleon of the neuroses&quot;.

== Personal life ==
Born in Paris, Charcot worked and taught at the famous Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital for 33 years. His reputation as an instructor drew students from all over Europe. In 1882, he established a neurology clinic at Salpêtrière, which was the first of its kind in Europe. Charcot was a part of the French neurological tradition and studied under, and greatly revered, Duchenne de Boulogne.

&quot;He married a rich widow, Madame Durvis, in 1864 and had three children, Jeanne, Jean-Paul and Jean-Baptiste, who later became a doctor and a famous polar explorer&quot;.

He has been described as an atheist.

== Career ==
=== Neurology ===
Charcot&#x27;s primary focus was neurology. He named and was the first to describe multiple sclerosis. Summarizing previous reports and adding his own clinical and pathological observations, Charcot called the disease &quot;sclérose en plaques&quot;. The three signs of multiple sclerosis now known as Charcot&#x27;s triad 1 are nystagmus, intention tremor, and telegraphic speech, though these are not unique to MS. Charcot also observed cognition changes, describing his patients as having a &quot;marked enfeeblement of the memory&quot; and &quot;conceptions that formed slowly&quot;. He was also the first to describe a disorder known as Charcot joint or Charcot arthropathy, a degeneration of joint surfaces resulting from loss of proprioception. He researched the functions of different parts of the brain and the role of arteries in cerebral hemorrhage.

Charcot was among the first to describe Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease (CMT). The announcement was made simultaneously with Pierre Marie of France (his resident) and Howard Henry Tooth of England. The disease is also sometimes called peroneal muscular atrophy.

Charcot&#x27;s studies between 1868 and 1881 were a landmark in the understanding of Parkinson&#x27;s disease. Among other advances he made the distinction between rigidity, weakness and bradykinesia. He also led the disease formerly named &quot;paralysis agitans&quot; (shaking palsy) to be renamed after James Parkinson. He also noted apparent variations on PD, such as Parkinson&#x27;s disease with hyperextension. Charcot received the first European professional chair of clinical diseases for the nervous system in 1882.

=== Studies on hypnosis and hysteria ===
Charcot is best known today for his work on hypnosis and hysteria. In particular, he is best remembered for his work with his hysteria patient Louise Augustine Gleizes, who somewhat increased his fame during his lifetime; however, Marie &quot;Blanche&quot; Wittmann, known as the Queen of Hysterics, was his most famous hysteria patient at the time. He initially believed that hysteria was a neurological disorder for which patients were pre-disposed by hereditary features of their nervous system, but near the end of his life he concluded that hysteria was a psychological disease.

Charcot first began studying hysteria after creating a special ward for non-insane females with &quot;hystero-epilepsy&quot;. He discovered two distinct forms of hysteria among these women: minor hysteria and major hysteria. His interest in hysteria and hypnotism &quot;developed at a time when the general public was fascinated in &#x27;animal magnetism&#x27; and &#x27;mesmerization, which was later revealed to be a method of inducing hypnosis. His study of hysteria &quot;attract[ed] both scientific and social notoriety&quot;. Bogousslavsky, Walusinski, and Veyrunes write:Charcot and his school considered the ability to be hypnotized as a clinical feature of hysteria ... For the members of the Salpêtrière School, susceptibility to hypnotism was synonymous with disease, i.e. hysteria, although they later recognized ... that &quot;grand hypnotisme&quot; (in hysterics) should be differentiated &quot;from petit hypnotisme&quot;, which corresponded to the hypnosis of ordinary people.Charcot argued vehemently against the widespread medical and popular prejudice that hysteria was rarely found in men, presenting several cases of traumatic male hysteria. He taught that due to this prejudice these &quot;cases often went unrecognised, even by distinguished doctors&quot; and could occur in such models of masculinity as railway engineers or soldiers. Charcot&#x27;s analysis, in particular his view of hysteria as an organic condition which could be caused by trauma, paved the way for understanding neurological symptoms arising from industrial-accident or war-related traumas.

The Salpêtrière School&#x27;s position on hypnosis was sharply criticized by Hippolyte Bernheim, another leading neurologist of the time. Bernheim argued that the hypnosis and hysteria phenomena that Charcot had famously demonstrated were in fact due to suggestion. However, Charcot himself had had longstanding concerns about the use of hypnosis in treatment and about its effect on patients. He also was concerned that the sensationalism hypnosis attracted had robbed it of its scientific interest, and that the quarrel with Bernheim, amplified by Charcot&#x27;s pupil Georges Gilles de la Tourette, had &quot;damaged&quot; hypnotism.

=== Arts ===
Charcot thought of art as a crucial tool of the clinicoanatomic method. He used photos and drawings, many made by himself or his students, in his classes and conferences. He also drew outside the neurology domain, as a personal hobby. Like Duchenne, he is considered a key figure in the incorporation of photography to the study of neurological cases.

===Distorted views of Charcot===
Distorted views of Charcot as harsh and tyrannical have arisen from some sources that rely on a fanciful autobiographical novel by Axel Munthe, &quot;The Story of San Michele&quot; (1929). Munthe claimed to have been Charcot&#x27;s assistant, but in fact, Munthe was just a medical student among hundreds of others. Munthe&#x27;s most direct contact with Charcot was when Munthe helped a young female patient &quot;escape&quot; from a ward of the hospital and took her into his home. Charcot threatened to report this to the police, and ordered that Munthe not be allowed on the wards of the hospital again.

In a 1931 letter to &quot;The New York Times Book Review&quot;, Charcot&#x27;s son Jean-Baptiste Charcot, who had, himself, been a formal student of his father at the Salpêtrière, emphatically stated:
&quot;I can certify that Dr Munthe never was trained by my father&quot;; and, further, that &quot;[although Munthe] may have [incidentally] followed, like hundreds of others, some courses of Charcot, ...he was not trained by him and certainly never had the intimacy of which he boasts [in his recently reviewed work, &quot;Memories and Vagaries&quot;]. ...I was, myself, a student at the Salpetriere then, and can certify that he was not one of his students and that my father never knew him. Everything he says about professor Charcot is false...&quot;

Bengt Jangfeldt, in his 2008 biography, &quot;Axel Munthe: The Road to San Michele&quot;, states that &quot;Charcot is not mentioned in a single letter of Axel&#x27;s out of the hundreds that have been preserved from his Paris years&quot; (p. 96).

== Legacy ==
One of Charcot&#x27;s greatest legacies as a clinician is his contribution to the development of systematic neurological examination, correlating a set of clinical signs with specific lesions. This was made possible by his pioneering long-term studies of patients, coupled with microscopic and anatomic analysis derived from eventual autopsies. This led to the first clear delineation of various neurological diseases and classic description of them, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.

Charcot is just as famous for his influence on those who had studied with him: Sigmund Freud, Joseph Babinski, Jean Leguirec, Pierre Janet, William James, Pierre Marie, Albert Londe, Charles-Joseph Bouchard, Georges Gilles de la Tourette, Alfred Binet, and Albert Pitres. Among the doctors trained by Charcot at the beginning of the 20th century account the Spanish neuropathologists Nicolás Achúcarro and Gonzalo Rodríguez Lafora, two distinguished disciples of Santiago Ramón y Cajal and members of the Spanish Neurological School.

Charcot bestowed the eponym for Tourette syndrome in honor of his student, Georges Gilles de la Tourette.

Although, by the 1870s, Charcot was France&#x27;s best known physician, his ideas about hysteria were later refuted, and French psychiatry did not recover for decades. An example of the dismissal of Charcot&#x27;s views can be found in Edward Shorter&#x27;s &quot;History of Psychiatry&quot;: Shorter states that Charcot understood &quot;almost nothing&quot; about major psychiatric illness, and that he was &quot;quite lacking in common sense and grandiosely sure of his own judgement&quot;. This perspective overlooks the fact that Charcot never claimed to be a psychiatrist or to be practising psychiatry, a field that was separately organized from neurology within France&#x27;s educational and public health systems. After Charcot&#x27;s death, the phenomenon of &quot;hysteria&quot; that he had described was no longer recognized as a real neurological condition, but was considered to be an &quot;artifact of suggestion&quot;. However, Charcot continued to have a &quot;prominent&quot; position in French psychiatry and psychology.

The negative evaluation of Charcot&#x27;s work on hysteria was influenced by a significant shift in diagnostic criteria and understanding of hysteria which occurred in the decades following his death. The historical perspective on Charcot&#x27;s work on hysteria has also been distorted by viewing him as a precursor of Freud. After Charcot&#x27;s death, Freud and Janet wrote articles on his importance. However, Charcot&#x27;s work on hysteria and hypnotism was at odds with the perspective Freud made famous, since Charcot believed in neurological determinism.

The Charcot-Janet school, which formed from the work of Charcot and his student Janet, contributed greatly to knowledge of multiple personality disorders.

===Influence on the development of anti-Semitism===

Charcot claimed to have observed a higher prevalence of diseases with a hereditary component (notably arthritis and neurological disorders) in Jewish communities, where limited numbers combined with longterm endogamy. He also used Jewish patients as examples in some of his public lectures.

When these claims were developed by neurologist Henry Meige, and others, in conjunction with the myth of the Wandering Jew, this was used as support by the apostles of French anti-Semitism, notably the journalist Edouard Drumont. However, historian of science Ian Hacking cautions that Charcot&#x27;s interest in Jews and his claims about them must be seen in their nuanced, ambiguous context: &quot;notice how Charcot shared most of the presuppositions of the genetic approach to mental illness that are current today [1998]. He could not fall back on a genome project to support his scientific speculations, but he did have a closed gene pool to study, not just in that Jews were endogamous, but because many Jews in his clinic were descended from relatives, even cousins, who married each other. Scientific reasoning could motivate his constant attention to Jewish family lines, thus a reputable scientific quest merged with a great willingness to see Jews as aberrant, troublesome, ill.&quot;

By the very end of the 19th century, anti-Semitism in France had rapidly ascended, due to the Dreyfus affair. &quot;Because of this transition, it has become all too easy to read gross and manifest anti-Semitism&quot; retrospectively into the hospital wards of one or two decades previous.

=== Awards ===
By decree on 22 April 1858, Charcot was made a Knight of France&#x27;s Legion of Honour. He was subsequently promoted in rank to Officer (decree: 4 April 1880), and then finally Commander (decree: 12 January 1892).

=== Other ===
A collection of Charcot&#x27;s correspondence is held at the United States National Library of Medicine.

Charcot Island in Antarctica was discovered by his son, Jean-Baptiste Charcot, who named the Island in honor of his father.

The &quot;Charcot Award&quot; is given every two years by the Multiple Sclerosis International Federation for a lifetime of outstanding research into the understanding or treatment of multiple sclerosis.

==In popular culture==
A 2024 award-winning historical literary novel &quot;The Dream Collector - Sabrine &amp; Sigmund Freud&quot; by R.w. Meek, published by Historium Press, explores the relationship between Dr. Charcot and his patient known as the Princess of Hysteria; the secrets of Charcot&#x27;s stenographer, Julie Forette, and the blossoming dream interpretations of his new intern, a young Sigmund Freud. Winner of the 2022 Palm Beach Book Festival book contest, and the 2023 Runner-up for book of the year at The Historical Fiction Company.

In literature, Charcot&#x27;s hypnosis is mentioned in Bram Stoker&#x27;s novel &quot;Dracula.&quot; He figures in Per Olov Enquist&#x27;s 2004 novel &quot;The Book about Blanche and Marie&quot;, and in the 2005 novel by Sebastian Faulks, &quot;Human Traces&quot;, as well as Alasdair Gray&#x27;s 1992 &quot;Poor Things&quot;.

A 2012 French historical drama film &quot;Augustine&quot;, is about a fictional love affair between Charcot and his patient Louise Augustine Gleizes, who was known as Augustine or A. Charcot is a central figure in the 2021 French film, &quot;The Mad Women&#x27;s Ball&quot;.

In music, the Scottish experimental hip hop group Hector Bizerk wrote the song &quot;Dr. Charcot&quot; for their 2015 album &quot;The Waltz Of Modern Psychiatry&quot;. Charcot is the main character of the song &quot;Let Yourself Go&quot; form The Alan Parsons Project 1990 album &quot;Freudiana&quot;.

== Quotations ==
* &quot;In the last analysis, we see only what we are ready to see, what we have been taught to see. We eliminate and ignore everything that is not a part of our prejudices.&quot; 
* &quot;To learn how to treat a disease, one must learn how to recognize it. The diagnosis is the best trump in the scheme of treatment.&quot;
* &quot;Symptoms, then, are in reality nothing but a cry from suffering organs.&quot;
* &quot;If you do not have a proven treatment for certain illnesses, bid your time, do what you can, but do not harm your patients.&quot;
* &quot;...perfectly legitimate pathological phenomena, in which the will of the patient counts for nothing, absolutely nothing&quot;; in reference to the clinical features of hysteria.

Vanhecke started his career in Belgian politics as a student by joining the Jong Studentenverbond and later the Nationalistische Studentenvereniging. He gave up his membership of the Volksunie in 1977 after it acceded to a much-debated package of federal reforms. Vanhecke subsequently joined the Vlaams Nationale Partij, the predecessor of the Vlaams Blok.

Quickly climbing the party ranks, he became responsible for the party&#x27;s press and media communication in 1986 and worked from 1989 as a personal assistant to Karel Dillen in the European Parliament, until he was elected to a Parliamentary seat himself in 1994. After a short term in the Belgian Senate, Vanhecke returned to European politics after the elections in 2004.

Vanhecke sat on its Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, and is a substitute for the Committee on Development and a member of the
Delegation for relations with Switzerland, Iceland and Norway and to the European Economic Area (EEA) Joint Parliamentary Committee. His voting record in the European Parliament shows his clear pro-life stance.

When Karel Dillen resigned from his post as chairman of the Vlaams Blok in 1996, Vanhecke was designated as his successor. He was elected in 2001.

In November 2004 the Vlaams Blok was dissolved and a new political party was created under the name Vlaams Belang. Vanhecke was appointed chairman of this new party, a role he performed until 2008.

Vanhecke left Vlaams Belang in 2011, one of several high profile members at the time to quit the party, and finished the remainder of his term as an MEP as an independent and joined the Europe of Freedom and Democracy group. He subsequently announced his support for the New Flemish Alliance party but was refused membership due to his political past.

<doc id="932862" wikidata="Q3150163" url="?curid=932862" title="Area codes 213, 323, and 738">
<text>Area codes 213, 323, and 738 are telephone area codes in the North American Numbering Plan (NANP) for the U.S. state of California. They are assigned in an overlay complex to a numbering plan area (NPA) that comprises, roughly, the area of downtown Los Angeles City, as well as several southeast Los Angeles County cities, such as Bell and Huntington Park. Area code 213 was one of the original North American area codes of 1947 and 323 was created in an area code split of 213 in 1998. This was the fifth split of 213 and left it serving only downtown Los Angeles and immediately adjoining neighborhoods. In 2017, the two NPAs were recombined in the overlay.

Area code 738 was selected as an additional overlay area code, activated in November 2024.

==History==
In 1947, when the American Telephone and Telegraph Company (AT&amp;T) devised the first nationwide telephone numbering plan and assigned the original North American area codes, the state of California was divided into three numbering plan areas: 213, 415, and 916, for the southern, central, and northern parts of the state, respectively. The area served by 213 extended from the Mexican border to the Central Coast. In 1950, the boundary between 213 and 415 was realigned toward the north, requiring the southern portion of the Central Valley, including Bakersfield, to change from area code 415 to 213.

As a result of southern California&#x27;s rapid expansion of telephone service during the second half of the 20th century, area code 213 was split five times in the period from 1951 to 1998. In the 21st century area code overlays have become more practical.

===1951–1998: Area code splits===
The first split became necessary in 1951, when most of the southern and eastern portion, including San Diego and most of Orange County, were assigned area code 714. In 1957, 213 was restricted to Los Angeles County, with most of the northern and western portions receiving area code 805. This configuration was stable for almost three decades, until 1984, when the San Fernando Valley and the San Gabriel Valley received area code 818, thus making Los Angeles one of the first major cities in the US to be split into two numbering plan areas—New York City experienced this later in the same year. In 1991, West Los Angeles and the South Bay were assigned area code 310.

On June 13, 1998, the Los Angeles NPA was divided once more, to create area code 323. Area code 213 was kept by Los Angeles exchanges &quot;1&quot; (Downtown/Echo Park), &quot;7&quot; (South Park/Exposition Park) and &quot;10&quot; (Westlake/Koreatown), while exchanges &quot;2&quot; (Silverlake/Los Feliz), &quot;3&quot; (Eagle Rock/Highland Park), &quot;4&quot; (El Sereno/Lincoln Heights), &quot;5&quot; (Boyle Heights/East Los Angeles), &quot;6&quot; (Bell/Vernon/South Gate), &quot;8&quot; (South Central/South LA), &quot;9&quot; (South LA/Hyde Park/Athens), &quot;11&quot; (West Adams/Jefferson Park), &quot;12&quot; (Leimert Park/Baldwin Hills), &quot;13&quot; (Hancock Park/Fairfax District) and &quot;14&quot; (Hollywood/Hollywood Hills) switched to area code 323. This split made 213 one of the geographically smallest numbering plan areas in the nation, covering only Downtown Los Angeles and its immediately adjoining neighborhoods, such as Chinatown. Completely surrounding 213, 323 included most of the remainder of central Los Angeles, including Hollywood, as well as several neighboring cities, including Bell, Huntington Park and Montebello.

===Since 2017: Overlay codes===
Despite Southern California&#x27;s continued growth and the proliferation of cell phones and pagers, 213 was not projected to exhaust until 2050. In contrast, 323 was projected to exhaust in 2017. Since 213 still had an abundance of numbers available, the California Public Utilities Commission approved a plan that erased the boundaries between both area codes, converting the area to an overlay complex for all of central Los Angeles. Since this change went into full effect on July 8, 2017, telephone companies have been able to assign any available 213 numbers in the former 323 area and vice versa, and customers have been required to dial the area code for all calls. This change returned 213 to some areas that had used it for more than half a century prior to 1998. Even so, within five years of the boundary elimination, it was determined that further relief would be required for 213/323.

Based on exhaustion studies of the numbering plan area, the California Public Utilities Commission approved an additional all-services overlay code on March 16, 2023, by selection of area code 738 with an in-service date of November 1, 2024.

<doc id="932864" wikidata="Q1211216" url="?curid=932864" title="Bande à part (film)">
<text>Bande à part () is a 1964 French New Wave film directed by Jean-Luc Godard. It was released as Band of Outsiders in North America; its French title derives from the phrase &quot;faire bande à part&quot;, which means &quot;to do something apart from the group&quot;. The film is about three people who commit a robbery. It received positive critical reviews, and its dance scene has been referenced several times in popular culture.

==Plot==
A young woman named Odile (Anna Karina) meets a man named Franz (Sami Frey) in an English language class. She has told him of a large pile of money stashed in the villa where she lives with her aunt Victoria and Mr. Stolz in Joinville, a Parisian suburb. Franz tells his friend Arthur (Claude Brasseur) of the money and the two make a plan to steal it.

Franz and Arthur go to the English class, where Arthur flirts with Odile and asks her about the money. Odile goes home and finds the money in Stolz&#x27;s room. She then meets Franz and Arthur, and they go to a café, order drinks, and dance. Odile tells Arthur that she loves him, and the two go back to his place and spend the night together.

The next day, Arthur&#x27;s uncle learns of the money and wants a cut of it. Franz, Arthur, and Odile decide to commit the robbery sooner than they planned. The three meet up and run through the Louvre in record time. That night, they go to Odile&#x27;s house and find that the door to Stolz&#x27;s room is locked. Arthur tells Odile to find the key. Franz and Arthur return to the house the following night, and Odile tells them that the locks have been changed. They tie and gag Victoria, before locking her in a closet. Then, they go to Stolz&#x27;s room and see that the money is not there anymore. They search the house and find only a small amount of cash. When they open the closet to interrogate Victoria, she appears to be dead. Franz and Odile leave, and Arthur stays behind, saying he wants to check if Victoria really dead (but we infer he is going back to find the rest of the money).

While driving away, Franz and Odile see Arthur&#x27;s uncle heading to the villa, and they go back. They then see that Arthur has found the rest of the money in a kennel. Arthur and his uncle get into a shootout and kill each other. Stolz returns to the house and Victoria is shown to be alive. Franz and Odile drive off with the small stack of money from the robbery. They flee to South America and realise that they love each other.

==Cast==
*Anna Karina as Odile
*Sami Frey as Franz
*Claude Brasseur as Arthur
*Danièle Girard as English teacher
*Louisa Colpeyn as Madame Victoria
*Ernest Menzer as Arthur&#x27;s uncle
*Chantal Darget as Arthur&#x27;s aunt
*Georges Staquet as legionnaire

==Production==
&quot;Bande à part&quot; was directed by Jean-Luc Godard and was filmed in 25 days. Godard described it as &quot;&quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; meets Franz Kafka&quot;. The film is an adaptation of the 1958 novel &quot;Fools&#x27; Gold&quot; by American author Dolores Hitchens.

==Reception==
&quot;Bande à part&quot; has a 94% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 52 reviews, with an average rating of 7.98/10. The website&#x27;s critical consensus calls the film &quot;an oddball heist movie with an dark streak that picks apart every rule in filmmaking.&quot; Film critic Pauline Kael described &quot;Bande à part&quot; as &quot;a reverie of a gangster movie&quot; and &quot;perhaps Godard&#x27;s most delicately charming film&quot;. According to critic Ignatiy Vishnevetsky, the film&#x27;s outward charm contrasts with how sad it is: &quot;&quot;Band Of Outsiders&quot; contains some of the medium&#x27;s most sublime images of the anything-goes possibility of youth, but it also captures the hopelessness and loneliness of being young with nothing to do. Whether they&#x27;re planning a crime or performing an impromptu dance routine, the trio is mostly motivated by boredom, and everything carries a tinge of personal darkness.&quot;

&quot;Bande à part&quot; is often considered one of Godard&#x27;s most accessible films; critic Amy Taubin called it &quot;a Godard film for people who don&#x27;t much care for Godard&quot;. Its accessibility has endeared the film to a broader audience. For example, it was the only Godard film selected for &quot;Time&quot;s &quot;All-Time 100 movies&quot;. &quot;Bande à part&quot; was also ranked No. 79 in &quot;Empire&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;The 100 Best Films of World Cinema&quot; in 2010.

In tribute, Quentin Tarantino named his film production company &quot;A Band Apart&quot;. It was also Tarantino&#x27;s favorite Godard film.

==Memorable scenes==

When Franz, Arthur, and Odile are in a crowded café, Arthur and Odile decide to dance. Franz joins them as they perform a dance routine. The music is R&amp;B or soul music composed for the film by Michel Legrand, but Anna Karina said the actors called it &quot;the Madison dance&quot;, alluding to a novelty dance of the time. The Madison scene influenced the dance scene with Uma Thurman and John Travolta in Tarantino&#x27;s &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; (1994). It also influenced scenes in Hal Hartley&#x27;s &quot;Simple Men&quot; (1992) and Martin Hynes&#x27; &quot;The Go-Getter&quot; (2007). In Roger Michell&#x27;s &quot;Le Week-End&quot; (2013), the principal characters see the dance scene on a TV screen in their Paris hotel room and briefly dance along with it. The final scene of the movie is a longer reenactment in a café after one of the characters plays the music on a jukebox. In &quot;The Gentlemen&#x27;s Wager&quot;, a 2014 short film made to promote Johnnie Walker whiskey, Jude Law and a group of dancers perform the Madison dance in order to win a bet. Emma Stone, Jonah Hill, and Rome Kanda perform the dance in &quot;Exactly Like You&quot;, the fifth episode of the 2018 Netflix series &quot;Maniac&quot;. The entire dance scene was also used as the music video for the song &quot;Dance with Me&quot; by Nouvelle Vague from their album &quot;Bande à Part&quot; (2006). The group took their name from a scene in the film, where Arthur and Odile are walking on a street and pass an emporium with Nouvelle Vague (New Wave or New Trend) in large letters over the door.

In a later scene, Franz, Arthur, and Odile attempt to break the world record for running through the Louvre museum. The narrator informs viewers that their time was 9 minutes and 43 seconds, which broke the record set by Jimmy Johnson of San Francisco at 9 minutes and 45 seconds. The Louvre scene is referenced in Bernardo Bertolucci&#x27;s 1968-based 2003 film &quot;The Dreamers&quot;, in which its characters break the Louvre record.

<text>In 1947, the American Telephone and Telegraph Company (AT&amp;T) devised the first nationwide telephone numbering plan and assigned the original North American area codes. The state of California was divided into three numbering plan areas (NPAs) with distinct area codes: 213, 415, and 916, for the southern, central, and northern parts of the state, respectively. 

In 1949, Oakland, CA, received the fifth regional dial switching center for Operator Toll Dialing in the nation, which set the stage for direct distance dialing by customers in the 1950s. In 1950, the boundaries of the California numbering plan areas were redrawn to produce a division of the northern and central parts along a north–south-running dividing line. Numbering plan area 415 became the coastal region from the North Coast to the Oregon border, while 916 was redrawn to comprise the northeastern corner of the state. This realignment resulted in Sacramento changing from area code 415 to 916, and Bakersfield to 213.

During the initial trials of DDD, starting in 1951, area code 318 was temporarily installed for the new toll-switching center in San Francisco to separate calls destined through Oakland (415), as six-digit translation was not available until two years later.

In subsequent decades the California numbering plan areas underwent many area code splits and area code overlay arrangements. As of July 2023, California has 38 active area codes.

357 will be an overlay with area code 559 starting on March 26, 2025 (https://docs.cpuc.ca.gov/PublishedDocs/Published/G000/M530/K320/530320126.PDF).

<text>Nachrodt-Wiblingwerde is a municipality in the Märkischer Kreis, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany.

==Geography==
The municipality is split into two main settlements. Nachrodt is located in the valley of the river Lenne at an altitude of 140 m above sea level, while Wiblingwerde is located at an altitude of 480 m on the hills of the Lennegebirge, one of the hill chains in the Sauerland mountains.

=== Division of the municipality ===
==History==
The municipality was formed in 1907, when the Amt Altena was dissolved. The two municipalities Kelleramt and Wiblingwerde were merged into the new municipality Nachrodt-Wiblingwerde, which was no longer member in an Amt anymore.

==Coat of arms==
The coat of arms of the municipality shows in the top part the red and silver rose from the church seal of the &quot;Kirchspiel Wiblingwerde&quot;. In the bottom is a wavy line representing the river Lenne and thus Nachrodt. Both symbols are separated by the red-and-silver chequered bar of the Mark. The coat of arms was designed by Otto Hupp, and was granted on October 17, 1935.

<text>The Madison is a novelty dance that was popular in the late 1950s to mid-1960s.

==Description and history==
It was created and first danced in Columbus, Ohio, in 1957. The local popularity of the dance and record in Baltimore, Maryland, came to the attention of the producers of &quot;The Buddy Deane Show&quot; in 1960, which led to other dance shows picking it up.
The Madison is a line dance that features a regular back-and-forth pattern interspersed with called steps. Its popularity inspired dance teams and competitions, as well as various recordings, and today it is still sometimes performed as a nostalgic dance. The Madison is featured in the John Waters movie &quot;Hairspray&quot; (1988), and it continues to be performed in the Broadway musical &quot;Hairspray&quot;. Both the film and the musical feature one of many songs released during the Madison &quot;craze&quot; in the US.

The jazz pianist Ray Bryant recorded &quot;Madison Time&quot; for Columbia Records in 1959. &quot;Billboard&quot; stated that &quot;The footwork for the Madison dance is carefully and clearly diagrammed for the terpers.&quot; The Ray Bryant version was the version featured in the film &quot;Hairspray&quot;. The other popular version was by Al Brown &amp; The Tunetoppers. Another version was recorded by radio presenter Alan Freeman for Decca Records in 1962.

An example of an album featuring music for the Madison is &quot;The Madison Dance Party&quot; (1960) by Al Brown&#x27;s Tunetoppers with calls by Al Brown. It includes a song titled &quot;The Madison&quot; as well as several other songs to which the Madison can be danced, including &quot;Madison Party&quot;, &quot;Mo&#x27; Madison&quot;, &quot;Madison Jr.&quot;, and &quot;Madison Jam&quot;, among others.

The Madison basic, danced in the film &quot;Hairspray&quot;, is as follows:

#Step left forward
#Place right beside left (no weight) and clap
#Step back on right
#Move left foot back and across the right
#Move left foot to the left
#Move left foot back and across the right

Called steps included the Double Cross, the Cleveland Box, The Basketball (with Wilt Chamberlain), the Big &quot;M&quot;, the &quot;T&quot; Time, the Jackie Gleason, the Birdland, and The Rifleman. &quot;The Jackie Gleason&quot; is based on a tap dance movement known as &quot;Shuffle Off to Buffalo&quot;. Additional called sequences are: Two Up and Two Back, Big Boss Cross in Front, Make a &quot;T&quot;, the Box, Cuddle Me, and Flying High. &quot;Away We Go&quot; may be the same as &quot;The Jackie Gleason&quot;.

&quot;Time&quot; magazine noted the Madison in April 1960.

The Madison dance has become very popular in the Kingdom of Cambodia and Kampuchea Krom (Mekong delta). It was introduced to Cambodia in the 1960s and remains a very popular dance at wedding banquets and other parties. The largest Madison dance in the world took place in Siem Reap, Cambodia on 15 April 2015 in celebration of the Cambodian New Year, involving 2,015 participants.

== Examples in motion pictures ==
* In a famous sequence in Jean-Luc Godard&#x27;s 1964 film &quot;Bande à part&quot; (&quot;Band of Outsiders&quot;, 1964), the main characters engage in a dance, which is not named in the film, but which the actors later referred to as the &quot;Madison dance&quot;. The music and choreography are, however, unrelated to the Madison.
* In &quot;The Rocky Horror Picture Show&quot; (1975), Brad (played by Barry Bostwick) calls out, &quot;Say, do any of you guys know how to Madison?&quot; after the Time Warp dance. However, the dance is not performed in the film.
* The dance is performed by a large group in the original (non-musical) version of John Waters&#x27; &quot;Hairspray&quot; (1988).
* In &quot;Monsieur Ibrahim&quot; (2003), Lola Naymark does a Madison-like dance at 42 minutes and at 1 hour 18 minutes a group of Turkish youth appears to be doing a facsimile of the dance as well. The song by Olivier Despax and the Gamblers is featured.
* In &quot;The Go-Getter&quot; (2007), Lou Taylor Pucci, Zooey Deschanel and Jena Malone all dance the &quot;Madison&quot; as an homage to Godard&#x27;s &quot;Bande à part&quot;.
*The film &quot;Le Week-End&quot; (2013) ends with the main characters Nick and Morgan dancing in the midst of the café recreating the scene from &quot;Bande à part&quot;.
*Episode 3, &quot;Other People, Other Rooms&quot;, of the Hulu miniseries &quot;11.22.63&quot; (2016) (based on the 2011 Stephen King novel &quot;11/22/63&quot;) features students and Sadie Dunhill doing The Madison.
*In the Netflix series &quot;Maniac&quot; (2018) episode 5, the characters played by Rome Kanda, Emma Stone, and Jonah Hill dance the Madison.

<text>Amgen Inc. (formerly Applied Molecular Genetics Inc.) is an American multinational biopharmaceutical company headquartered in Thousand Oaks, California. As one of the world&#x27;s largest independent biotechnology companies, Amgen has approximately 24,000 staff in total as of 2022.

The name &quot;AMGen&quot; is a portmanteau of the company&#x27;s original name, Applied Molecular Genetics, which became the official name of the company in 1983 (three years after incorporation and coincident with its initial public offering). The company is listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the ticker symbol &quot;AMGN&quot;, as well as a component of the Nasdaq-100, the Dow Jones Industrial Average, and the S&amp;P 100 and 500 indices.

== History ==
Amgen was established in Thousand Oaks in 1980, as Applied Molecular Genetics. Amgen was backed by a small group of venture capitalists, and its early focus was on recombinant DNA technology and recombinant human insulin.

Its initial scientific advisory board consisted of Norman Davidson, Leroy Hood, Arnold Berk, John Carbon, Robert Schimke, Arno Motulsky, Marvin H. Caruthers, and Dave Gibson. In October 1980, Amgen named George Rathmann its first president and chief executive officer.

On June 17, 1983, Amgen went public, selling two million common shares and raising nearly $40 million. That same year, after more than two years of work, an Amgen research team led by Fu-Kuen Lin had a breakthrough in finding and cloning the erythropoietin gene, a protein created in the kidney that stimulates red blood cell production. Lin&#x27;s team created what would become Epogen (epoetin alfa).

In 1985, Amgen researcher Larry Souza and his team cloned granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), leading to the development of Neupogen (filgrastim).

In October 1988, Gordon Binder was named CEO, succeeding George Rathmann. The following year, in 1989, Amgen received approval for the first recombinant human erythropoetin product, Epogen (epoetin alfa).

In February 1991, Amgen received FDA approval for Neupogen for the prevention of infections in patients whose immune systems are suppressed due to cancer chemotherapy.

Amgen opened a new manufacturing facility in Puerto Rico, in March 1993, which later became the company&#x27;s flagship manufacturing site.

In 1994, Amgen became the fifth company to receive the U.S. Department of Commerce&#x27;s National Medal of Technology and Innovation, in recognition of its work developing medicines to improve quality of life for kidney and cancer patients. Also around this time, Amgen researcher Steve Elliott and his team added more sugar molecules to erythropoietin, causing it to remain in the body longer. This led to the development of Aranesp (darbepoetin alfa).

=== 2000-2014 ===
Binder was succeeded as CEO by Kevin W. Sharer in 2000. Robert A. Bradway became Amgen&#x27;s president and chief executive officer in May 2012, following Sharer&#x27;s retirement.

In March 2011, Amgen acquired a manufacturing facility near Dublin, Ireland, in March.

Amgen also opened an affiliate in China in 2013.

In November 2014 the company announced it was halting all trials of rilotumumab in advanced gastric cancer patients after one of the trials found more deaths in those who took the compound with chemotherapy, than those without. Later in the same week, the company in conjunction with AstraZeneca reported positive results for brodalumab in a Phase III trial comparing the compound with ustekinumab and a placebo in treating psoriasis. In the same month, construction was completed on Amgen&#x27;s next-generation biomanufacturing facility in Singapore. Blincyto (blinatumomab) was approved by the FDA in December of that year.

Amgen&#x27;s Thousand Oaks staff in 2022 numbered approximately 5,000 (8.5% of total city employment) and included hundreds of scientists, making Amgen the largest employer in Ventura County.

==Pipeline and clinical trials==
As of August 2022, Amgen had 17 clinical programs underway in Phase III, eight in Phase II, and 19 in Phase I.

In September 2019, FDA granted fast track designation to sotorasib for the treatment of metastatic non-small-cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) with the KRAS G12C mutation.

In August 2020, Amgen, Takeda, and AbbVie, as part of a COVID-19 research and development (R&amp;D) alliance, announced the first patients enrolled in the I-SPY COVID clinical trial. The trial evaluated the efficacy of Otezla and two other medicines in severely ill, hospitalized COVID-19 patients who required high-flow oxygen.

In October 2020, Amgen announced positive topline Phase 2 results from the CodeBreaK 100 clinical study, evaluating sotorasib in 126 patients with KRAS G12C-mutant advanced NSCLC who had failed three or fewer prior lines of anti-cancer therapies (including immunotherapy and/or chemotherapy). Amgen, the Global Coalition for Adaptive Research, and Eisai Co., Ltd. also announced enrollment of the first patient in a study testing multiple interventions for the treatment of patients hospitalized with COVID-19.

In November 2020, Amgen, Takeda, and UCB, as part of the COVID R&amp;D alliance, announced the first patient enrolled in another trial evaluating Otezla and two other drugs as treatments for COVID-19. Amgen also announced that it would terminate its collaboration with Cytokinetics and transition the development and commercialization rights for omecamtiv mecarbil and AMG 594. Amgen and AstraZeneca announced positive topline results from a Phase 3 trial in which the investigational medicine tezepelumab demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in exacerbations in patients with severe asthma.

In December 2020, the FDA granted breakthrough therapy designation to sotorasib for advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer patients with KRAS G12C mutation.

In May 2021, sotorasib received accelerated approval from FDA for treatment of adult patients with NSCLC whose tumors have a KRAS G12C mutation and who have received at least one prior systemic therapy; this was the first approved targeted therapy for tumors with any KRAS mutation. Similar approvals for sotorasib in NSCLC followed in January 2022 in Europe and Japan.

In September 2022, data from a late-stage study showed the company&#x27;s cancer pill Lumakras beating out chemotherapy. This was the first approved drug in the set of treatments that target KRAS, among the most common generic mutations found in cancers but one where researchers have struggled for years to design drugs to treat. The drug was approved in 2021 with a list price of $17,900 per month.

==Carbon footprint==
Amgen reported Total CO2e emissions (Direct + Indirect) for the twelve months ending 31 December 2020 at 243 Kt (-6 /-2.4% y-o-y) and aims to reach net zero emissions by 2027.

== Controversies ==
The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; reported on December 18, 2012, that Amgen pleaded guilty and agreed to pay $150 million in criminal penalty and $612 million to resolve 11 related whistleblower complaints. Federal prosecutors accused the company of pursuing profits while putting patients at risk. Larry Husten, a contributor at Forbes.com elaborates on AMGEN&#x27;s illegal marketing practices in this case, namely that the &quot;government accused Amgen of marketing Aranesp for indications not approved by the FDA and other illegal marketing practices&quot;.

<text>Eagle Butte is a rural area south of Medicine Hat and west of the Cypress Hills. It is home to Saint Margaret&#x27;s Church. Formerly there was a NWMP post in the area. The first post office opened in 1900. The locality takes its name from a nearby butte of the same name. It is near the location of a confirmed impact crater 10 km in diameter at 49°42&#x27;N110°31&#x27;W around 65 million years ago.

<text>Area codes 916 and 279 are California telephone area codes that serve Sacramento, the state capital, and most of its suburbs. Area code 916 was one of the first three original area codes established in California in October 1947. It originally covered most of northeastern California, but area code splits have reduced its coverage to the greater Sacramento area. Area code 279 began service in March 2018 to relieve an exhausted supply of telephone numbers in the 916 area code.

==History==
Originally, the plan area covered the far northern portion of the state. In 1950, as part of a realignment of California&#x27;s area codes, 916 was rotated to cover the northeastern corner of California, from the Sierra Nevada to the Central Valley. This involved changing Sacramento from area code 415 to 916.

The numbering plan area was split in a flash-cut on March 1, 1959, when area code 707 was created out of the northwest portion. On November 1, 1997, it was split again. The northeastern portion, including Redding, Yreka and Mount Shasta, became area code 530, reducing the 916 numbering plan area to Sacramento and its immediate area. On the same day, Dixon was reassigned from 916 to 707. This split left 916 as the only one of the original 86 area codes that no longer covers any part of its original area.

In 2017, the CPUC approved an overlay area code to take effect in 2018, as all available prefixes were expected to be allocated by December 2018. On February 9, 2017, the CPUC announced that the new overlay area code would be area code 279. The new area code began service on March 10, 2018.

<doc id="932908" wikidata="Q1968916" url="?curid=932908" title="RAF Ascension Island">
<text>RAF Ascension Island , also known as Wideawake Airfield or Ascension Island Auxiliary Field, is a military airfield and facility located on Ascension Island in the Atlantic Ocean. The airfield is jointly operated by the Royal Air Force (RAF) and the United States Space Force (USSF). Under the terms of an international agreement between the UK and US governments, only state aircraft (e.g. military and diplomatic flights) are authorised to land at Ascension; however, it is also open to air services between Saint Helena and Ascension.

The facility is home to a U.S. Space Force ground tracking station in support of the Eastern Range and rocket launches from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida.

==History==
In 1939 Ascension became important as a high-frequency direction finding radio station covering trade routes. Wideawake Airfield (named after a noisy colony of sooty terns nearby) was built by the US military in 1942 by arrangement with the British government. The work was done by a US task force of the USAAF 38th Engineer Combat Regiment and the airfield opened on 10 July 1942. The first aircraft to land on Ascension Island was a Fairey Swordfish from HMS &quot;Archer&quot; in June, 1942 and it went on to be used by more than 25,000 aircraft as a staging point during the Second World War. An unusual visitor was a captured German Junkers Ju 88 bomber, which landed there in October 1943 as it was being flown from the Middle East to the United States in stages.

A U.S. Air Force tracking station (now administered by the U.S. Space Force) was officially activated as a satellite of Patrick Air Force Base (now Patrick Space Force Base) in Florida on 25 June 1956.

The airfield&#x27;s runway was extended in the latter part of 1980. The base was re-garrisoned by the RAF in 1982 and used extensively as a staging airfield, for the Avro Vulcan bombers and the Handley Page Victor tankers, during the Falklands War. A series of long-range bombing raids was carried out from there under the name Operation Black Buck. The first mission was on 30 April 1982. At one stage during that conflict, Wideawake became the busiest airport in the world for the number of aircraft movements.

In 2017 a parliamentary answer disclosed the runway needed a &#x27;full depth resurfacing&#x27;. In June 2020 the U.S. Department of Defense announced the runway would be repaired, with a completion date in 2022 after eighteen months work; until then commercial flights were suspended. Normal flights were able to resume in August/September 2022 when repairs to the eastern side of the runway were completed (see further discussion below).

The USAF relies upon contractors to maintain the airfield facilities and the satellite station. An update is underway, with a completion date in 2025.

==Target Tracking Radar Station==

The Target Tracking Radar Station was a Nike Zeus test facility for tracking reentry vehicles from Cape Canaveral missile launches. Built from 1960-1961 for anti-ballistic missile measurement, the &quot;Golf Ball&quot; radar antenna was on Cat Hill, and a collimation tower for radar calibration was towards English Bay. The facility is home to the Detachment 2 of the 45th Mission Support Group, part of the U.S. Space Force&#x27;s Delta 45. It operates a ground tracking station in support of the Eastern Range and rocket launches from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida.

The NASA Tracking Station at Devil&#x27;s Ashpit and the Cable &amp; Wireless Earth Station at Donkey Plain were built in the mid-1960s for space operations and communications, including the latter&#x27;s use for transmitting &quot;microwave borne data via the Early Bird Satellite back to the NASA facility at Andover, Maine&quot;.

==Operations==
The station comes under the overall jurisdiction of the Commander British Forces South Atlantic Islands, an officer of one-star rank. , the incumbent is Commodore Jonathan Lett.

The RAF airfield on Ascension Island is run on a day-to-day basis by around 19 RAF personnel, headed by a wing commander.

RAF Ascension Island is normally the refuelling point for the Ministry of Defence&#x27;s South Atlantic air bridge flights to RAF Mount Pleasant, on the Falkland Islands, from RAF Brize Norton in Oxfordshire, in the UK.

Beginning in November 2017, the Ascension Island Government has contracted South African air carrier Airlink to conduct regularly scheduled charter flights between Saint Helena Airport and Ascension Island on a monthly basis. Flights are currently scheduled on the second week of every month, arriving at Ascension on Saturday afternoon and returning to Saint Helena on Sunday morning. The first of these flights were scheduled for 18 and 19 November 2017. Additionally civilian passengers had been permitted on flights to and from RAF Brize Norton with reservations handled by AW Ship Management, with some customers doing package deals combined with the RMS &quot;Saint Helena&quot;, which travelled between Saint Helena and Cape Town, South Africa until the opening of St Helena Airport to passenger flights.

Ascension serves as a diversion airport for ETOPS aircraft crossing the Atlantic. In January 2013, a Delta Air Lines Boeing 777-200LR en route from Johannesburg to Atlanta diverted to Ascension as a result of engine problems.

The site is home to a high frequency radio station forming part of the Defence High Frequency Communications Service. The station is operated by Babcock International Group on behalf of the Ministry of Defence.

==Suspension of operations and runway repair==
Potholes on the runway led to the suspension in April 2017 of all Ministry of Defence South Atlantic Air Bridge Flights between RAF Mount Pleasant and RAF Brize Norton until at least 2019/2020. An Airbus A330 aircraft operated by AirTanker Services on behalf of the Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom) carried out those flights although a limited number of commercial passenger tickets were available. Those flights traveled via Dakar. Planes for emergency medical evacuation flights and the newly established monthly charter flight to Saint Helena Airport were not impacted given the size of aircraft used. Essential personnel and equipment were also exempt from the suspension. In February 2021, an RAF A400M aircraft delivered Covid-19 vaccines to the island.

While A330s were unable to land at the airport until the repair reached a stage to permit the resumption of full flight operations, the United States military continued to maintain a weekly flight between the island and Patrick Space Force Base in Florida, only for the use of its personnel, while the MV &quot;Ascension&quot; supply ship regularly services US facilities.
A repair project aimed at restoring service to the airport celebrated its halfway point in March 2022. In August 2022, the eastern portion of the runway was completed, allowing full flight operations to resume, with a U.S. Air Force C-17 Globemaster III of the 21st Airlift Squadron being the first aircraft of that size to use the improved runway on 31 August 2022. Earlier that month, an RAF A400M aircraft flying from Ascension Island was refueled for the first time by a Voyager KC.2 aircraft flying out of RAF Mount Pleasant. The repairs to the western side of the runway were fully completed in April 2023.

<text>Area codes 415 and 628 are telephone area codes in the North American Numbering Plan (NANP) for the city of San Francisco and its northern suburbs in Marin County (across the Golden Gate), and the northeast corner of San Mateo County in the U.S. state of California. Area code 415 was one of the eighty-six original North American area codes established in 1947, but modified in geographic configuration later. Area code 628 was assigned in 2015 to form an overlay in that numbering plan area in mitigation of central office prefix exhaustion.

==History==
When the North American Numbering Plan was proposed by AT&amp;T for Operator Toll Dialing in 1947, the state of California was divided into three numbering plan areas (NPAs) arranged as geographical zones in the southern part, the central part, and the northern part of the state. Area code 415 was assigned to central California, south of area code 916, and north of area code 213. It stretched from Sacramento in the north to Bakersfield in the south.

In 1950, the boundaries of the numbering plan area were redrawn to produce a division of the northern and central parts along a north–south-running dividing line. Numbering plan area 415 became the coastal region from the North Coast to the Oregon border, while 916 was redrawn to comprise the northeastern corner of the state. As part of this realignment, Sacramento was renumbered from area code 415 to 916, and Bakersfield to 213.

With the preparations for nation-wide direct distance dialing (DDD) in the early 1950s, area code 318 was temporarily used in the San Francisco area, initially by customers in Englewood, New Jersey, participating in the first customer trials to reach the city, as well as some areas north of the Golden Gate. In 1953, the entire Bay Area was &quot;reunited&quot; in using area code 415.

Area code 415 has been split three times due to the Bay Area&#x27;s rapid economic growth and demand for telecommunication services:
* On March 1, 1959, area code 707 was created from the northern part, and area code 408 was created for San Jose, the South Bay, the Monterey Bay, and the Salinas Valley. (408 has since been split to 831 and overlaid with 669. 707 has since been overlaid with 369.)
* On September 2, 1991, area code 510 was created for the East Bay, including Oakland. (510 has since been split to 925 and was overlaid by 341 in 2019.)
* On August 2, 1997, area code 650 was created; the partition approximately followed the boundary between San Francisco, which (along with Marin County) kept 415, and San Mateo County to the south, which received the new code. Deviations from the county line included a very small area east of the San Francisco Golf Club, which was changed to 650, and portions of Brisbane and Daly City, which remained in 415.

On February 21, 2015, the numbering plan area was transitioned to an overlay plan by adding area code 628 to the same service area for new numbers, making ten-digit dialing mandatory in the area, with eleven-digit dialing necessary from landlines.

<text>The Divine Light Mission (&quot;Divya Sandesh Parishad&quot;; DLM) was an organization founded in 1960 by guru Hans Ji Maharaj for his following in northern India. During the 1970s, the DLM gained prominence in the West under the leadership of his fourth and youngest son (Prem Rawat). Some scholars noted the influence of the Bhagavad Gita and the Radha Soami tradition, a.k.a. Sant Mat movement, but the western movement was widely seen as a new religious movement, a cult, a charismatic religious sect or an alternative religion. DLM officials said the movement represented a church rather than a religion.

When Shri Hans Ji Maharaj died in 1966, he was succeeded as guru by Prem Rawat, then just eight years old, despite rival claims from other family members. Although Prem Rawat was accepted as his father&#x27;s successor, because of his age his family retained effective control of the DLM. In 1971, Rawat defied his mother by travelling to the UK and the US, where local branches of DLM were established and rapidly expanded. By 1973, DLM had over a million followers in India and tens of thousands of followers in the West, along with dozens of ashrams and hundreds of centers.

As Rawat grew older, he began to take a more active role in the movement and, when he turned sixteen, following the financially disastrous Millennium &#x27;73 festival, he took administrative control of the US branch. His increasing independence and his marriage to a non-Indian in 1974, caused a permanent rift with his mother and two of his brothers, Satpal Ji Maharaj and Bhole Ji Maharaj. They returned to India, where his eldest brother Satpal Maharaj took over the control of the Indian DLM.

In the early 1980s, Rawat began disbanding the western DLM. He closed the ashrams and eliminated the remaining Indian influences from his presentation to make it independent of any specific culture or religion. In the US, UK, France and Australia, Elan Vital was formed to replace the DLM in supporting Rawat in his role as teacher.

==History==

===Founding and early years in India===

Shri Hans Maharaj Ji, initiated by the Sant Mat guru Sri Swarupanand Ji, began teaching in the Sind and Lahore provinces of India in the 1930s. In 1950 he began initiating &quot;Mahatmas&quot;, followers who could themselves initiate devotees, and formed a magazine called &quot;Hansadesh&quot; which is still active in 2017.

In 1960 in the city of Patna, he founded the Divine Light Mission (&quot;Divya Sandesh Parishad&quot;) to organize followers across Northern India. At the time of his death on 19 July 1966, the Divine Light Mission had six million members in India.

During the customary 13 days of mourning, his mother and senior officials of the organization discussed the succession. Prem Rawat, who was 8 years-old at the time, addressed the crowd and was accepted by them as their teacher and &quot;Perfect Master&quot; and was named as Bal Bhagwan. Because of his age, effective control of the DLM was shared by the whole family.

===International Footprints===

In 1971, Rawat, then known as Guru Maharaji Ji, travelled to the West against his mother&#x27;s wish &amp; will. DLM was established in the U.S. and the UK. The U.S. branch was headquartered in Denver, Colorado. It was registered there as a non-profit corporation and in 1974 was recognized as a church by the United States Internal Revenue Service under section 501(c)(3).

By 1972 DLM was operating in North and South America, Europe and Australia. By 1973, DLM was operating in 37 countries, tens of thousands of people had been initiated (become premies) and several hundred centers and dozens of ashrams formed in the U.S. and the UK. DLM said it had 8,000 devotees and forty ashrams at that time.

In the United States, the staff at the headquarters grew to 125, and Telexes connected the headquarters with the ashrams. Social service facilities, including a medical clinic in New York City, were opened. A Women&#x27;s Spiritual Right Organization dedicated to reaching out to persons in prisons, mental institutions and hospitals, was organized. The U.S. DLM published two periodicals: &quot;And It Is Divine&quot; (&quot;AIID&quot;), a monthly magazine with a circulation of 90,000; and &quot;Divine Times&quot;, a biweekly newspaper with a circulation of 60,000. The cover price of &quot;AIID&quot; was $1 but most were given away free, as were the advertisements. The World Peace Corps (WPC) was established as a security force to provide protection for Rawat. After Bob Mishler, the DLM President, was removed from power he said that Rawat got the idea to start a bodyguard unit after watching &quot;The Godfather&quot;. The WPC became the organizing agent of meetings and businesses. A variety of businesses were founded under US DLM auspices including laundromats, used clothing stores, a plane charter agency (&quot;Divine Travel Services&quot;), a repair service, and the &quot;Cleanliness-is-Next-to-Godliness&quot; janitorial service.

===Detroit incident===
On 8 August 1973, while Rawat was at the Detroit City Hall to receive a testimonial resolution praising his work, Pat Halley, who was at the time a reporter from Detroit&#x27;s underground periodical &quot;Fifth Estate&quot;, slapped him in the face with a shaving cream pie. Rawat responded by saying that he did not want his attacker arrested or hurt, but the reporter was attacked by two men a few days later and seriously injured. When local members heard of the incident they notified Rawat in Los Angeles who extended his regrets and condolences to Pat Halley&#x27;s family, and requested that the DLM conduct a full investigation. The assailants, one of them an Indian, were identified. They admitted their part in the incident and offered to turn themselves in. The Chicago police were immediately notified. The Detroit police declined to initiate extradition proceedings, variously claiming that they were unable to locate the assailants, or that the cost of extraditing them from Chicago to Detroit made it impractical. The arrest warrant remained outstanding. This lack of action by the Detroit police was attributed by some to Halley&#x27;s radical politics. A spokesman later stated that the Indian national had been &quot;shipped off to Europe&quot;.

===Festivals===
Festivals were a regular part of the Divine Light Mission&#x27;s activities and a source of revenue. Members would pay from $50 to $100 to attend, and Darshan events would generate considerable donations. The DLM celebrated three main festivals: Holi, which is celebrated in late March or early April; Guru Puja, which was held in July; and Hans Jayanti, which falls in November. Hans Jayanti marks the birthday of the DLM&#x27;s founder. According to Marc Galanter, the members at a festival in Orlando, Florida &quot;looked as though they had been drawn from the graduate campus of a large university—bright, not too carefully groomed, casually dressed. They were lively, good-tempered, and committed to their mutual effort. There was no idleness, brashness, marijuana, beer, loud music, or flirtation—all hallmarks of a more typical assembly of people in their twenties&quot;. Other festivals were held nationally and locally, and sometimes organized with little advance notice. Attending as many as ten festivals a year meant many members were unable to hold regular full-time jobs, and required sacrificing leisure and community activities in order to devote time to earning the money needed to attend.

In 1972, seven jumbo jets were chartered to bring members from the U.S. and other countries to the Hans Jayanti festival held at the main ashram near New Delhi. 2500 foreign members camped out at the mission&#x27;s &quot;city of love&quot; for a month. The event attracted a reported total of 500,000 attendees. When Rawat flew to India to attend he was accused of attempting to smuggle $65,000 worth of cash and jewelry into the country, but no charges were ever filed, and the Indian government later issued an apology. The accusation led to negative coverage in the Indian press and hard feelings between Rawat and his mother, who had persuaded him to return to India for the festival.

In June 1973, the British DLM, with Prem Rawat&#x27;s mother acting on behalf of her son, organized the &#x27;Festival of Love&#x27; at Alexandra Palace in London. While it drew thousands of attendees, Rawat began receiving hostile press coverage, partly due to his showing up late, or not at all, at scheduled appearances. The membership had grown very rapidly but the organizers had no clear idea where to lead the following, nor did they have the financial resources to maintain so many full-time workers.

====Millennium &#x27;73====

The 1973 Hans Jayanti festival was held at the Astrodome in Houston, Texas, and publicized as &quot;Millennium &#x27;73&quot;. The free three-day event was billed as &quot;the most significant event in human history&quot; that would herald &quot;a thousand years of peace for people who want peace&quot;, the idea being that peace would come to the world as individuals experienced inner peace. To promote the event, Prem Rawat&#x27;s 20-year-old brother, Bhole Ji Rawat toured with a 60-piece band, Blue Aquarius for two weeks giving free concerts. The 500-member tour was dubbed &quot;Soul Rush&quot; and traveled to seven cities on the way to Houston.

Rennie Davis, well known as one of the defendants in the Chicago Seven trial, attracted extensive media coverage as a spokesperson for Rawat. At the event, Davis declared that &quot;All I can say is, honestly, very soon now, every single human being will know the one who was waited for by every religion of all times has actually come.&quot; In a press conference at Millennium, Rawat denied being the Messiah, and when asked by reporters about the contradictions between what he said about himself and what his followers said about him, Rawat replied, &quot;Why don&#x27;t you do me a favor ... why don&#x27;t you go to the devotees and ask their explanation about it?&quot; While Rawat&#x27;s brother Satpal was nominally in charge of the festival, Davis was the &quot;General Coordinator&quot; and handled the details.

Expectations for the event were very high, with predictions that it would attract more than 100,000, or even as many as 400,000 people from Satpal. Davis privately said he thought 22,000 was a more realistic estimate and reserved 22,000 hotel beds. There was even talk about a space in the parking lot reserved for a flying saucer to land. When Satpal heard about the flying saucer he said, &quot;If you see any, just give them some of our literature&quot;.
The actual attendance was estimated at 35,000, and at 10,000 by police.

The event featured spectacular staging, a 56-piece rock band and a giant video screen that showed a barrage of shots from the tumultuous 1960s. Though it was not covered by the national television news, it did get extensive coverage in the print media. The premies were reported to be &quot;cheerful, friendly and unruffled, and seemed nourished by their faith&quot;. To the 400 premie parents who attended, Rawat &quot;was a rehabilitator of prodigal sons and daughters&quot;. Media people found a &quot;confused jumble of inarticulately expressed ideas.&quot; It was depicted in the award-winning U.S. documentary &quot;Lord of the Universe&quot; broadcast by PBS Television in 1974. The event was called the &quot;youth culture event of the year&quot;. Singer-songwriter Loudon Wainwright III visited the festival and later remarked that while the premies inside were looking happy the ones outside were arguing with Jesus Freaks and Hare Krishnas. Wainwright&#x27;s song &quot;I am the Way&quot; was partly inspired by Prem Rawat.

At the festival, Larry Bernstein, a prize-winning, 41-year-old architect described a &quot;Divine City&quot; to be built from the ground up starting the following year. It was to feature translucent hexagonal plastic houses stacked on concrete columns and connected with monorails. Polluting vehicles would be replaced by electric vehicles, and solar power would be used to provide energy. Cards would replace cash. The use of advanced technologies to ensure pollution-free air, Rennie Davis told a journalist, would be a practical demonstration of what it means to have Heaven on Earth. Two sites were suggested: either the Blue Ridge Mountains or somewhere near Santa Barbara, California. The former president and vice president of the DLM later said that Prem Rawat had spoken frequently of building such a city. Plans for the city were delayed amid the fiscal crisis following the Millennium festival. Incorporation papers for the formation of the &quot;City of Love and Light Unlimited, Inc.&quot; were filed in Colorado in 1974, and there was a failed attempt in 1975 to build the community near San Antonio, Texas.

The DLM incurred a debt estimated between $600,000 and over $1 million, attributed to poor management and low attendance. The debt severely damaged the DLM&#x27;s finances. Event-related expenses were covered by short-term credit based on the expectation that contributions would pour in following the free festival. DLM&#x27;s post-Millennium financial troubles forced it to close ashrams, sell its printing business and real estate, and to drop the lease on its IBM computer. Monthly donations fell from $100,000 to $70,000. According to Messer, &quot;to pay the debts remaining from the Houston event, devotees all over the country turned over their own possessions to Divine Sales, which had crash garage sales, attended flea markets, and invented numerous activities to dispose of the goods.&quot; By 1976 it was able to reduce the debt to $80,000. Consequently, the festival necessitated policy shifts within the movement organization.

===Marriage and rift===
Because of Prem Rawat&#x27;s age, Jagat janni Mata Ji, his mother, and her eldest son, Satpal Rawat (later known as Satpal Ji Maharaj) had managed the affairs of the worldwide DLM. As Prem Rawat approached sixteen he wanted to take a more active part in guiding the movement. According to Downton, &quot;this meant he had to encroach on his mother&#x27;s territory and, given the fact that she was accustomed to having control, a fight was inevitable&quot;. In December 1973, when he turned 16, Rawat took administrative control of the Mission&#x27;s U.S. branch and began to assert his independence from his mother who returned to India with Satpal.

In May 1974, a judge gave Rawat his consent to marry without parental permission. His marriage to his secretary, Marolyn Johnson, a 24-year-old follower from San Diego, California, was celebrated at a non-denominational church in Golden, Colorado. Rawat&#x27;s mother, Mata Ji, had not been invited. As a result of his marriage, Rawat became an emancipated minor. He called his wife &quot;Durga Ji&quot;, after the Hindu goddess Durga.

Rawat&#x27;s decision to marry a Westerner precipitated a struggle for control of DLM. His mother claimed that Rawat had broken his spiritual discipline by marrying, and had become a &quot;playboy&quot;. She appointed Satpal as the new head of DLM India, but the Western premies remained loyal to Rawat. The marriage led to a permanent rift between Prem Rawat and his mother, and was also credited with causing a profound disruption in the movement. Many followers left the ashrams to get married, and the base of support inevitably shifted from the ashrams to the wider premie community. Others felt &quot;almost betrayed&quot;, in part because he had championed celibacy, one of the requirements of ashram life, before getting married himself.
The bad press from the festivals and the rift caused by Prem Rawat&#x27;s marriage in 1974 marked the end of the movement&#x27;s growth phase.

In 1975, Prem Rawat returned to India in an attempt to gain control of the Indian DLM. A court-ordered settlement resulted in his eldest brother Satpal retaining control of the Indian DLM, while Rawat maintained control of the DLM outside of India.

===Westernization===
Following the rift with his mother, Rawat announced that he was replacing the predominantly Indian image with a Western one and began to wear business suits instead of his all-white Indian attire. The Indian mahatmas were replaced with Westerners, and Indian terminology fell from use. Rawat encouraged premies to leave the ashrams. According to one estimate, the worldwide membership had declined from 6 million to 1.2 million by 1976, and in the U.S. the 50,000 claimed initiates had dwindled to 15,000 regular contributors. A spokesman for the Mission explained in 1976 that the higher numbers had been inflated due to poor record-keeping. One estimate had from 500 to 1200 members living in ashrams in the mid-1970s. By the end of the 1970s, the movement had lost an estimated 80% of its followers in the U.S. Bromley and Hammond attribute the decline of groups including the Divine Light Mission to internal factors, but also in part to the news media&#x27;s &quot;discrediting reports about their activities&quot;, accounts which created a &quot;wide-spread public perception of &#x27;mind control&#x27; and other &#x27;cult&#x27; stereotypes.&quot;

The Divine Light Mission also attracted the attention of the anti-cult movement. Some members were violently kidnapped and deprogrammed. Some former members became outspoken critics of the organization and attacked the group with what Melton calls &quot;standard anti-cult charges of brainwashing and mind control&quot;. In reference to ex-followers, DLM spokesman Joe Anctil said that &quot;A lot of people were just on a trip in the beginning. They felt they had to be &#x27;hyped&#x27;, and some didn&#x27;t stay long enough to get beyond that. But we&#x27;ve changed as our understanding has changed.&quot; Bob Mishler, the founding president of the DLM in the U.S., was removed by Rawat in 1977 and gave an interview in 1979, along with the former vice president, in which he said he was concerned that the DLM was becoming a &quot;tax evasion for the guru&quot;, and said he feared a repeat of Jonestown. They also accused Rawat of engaging in inappropriate behavior. Mishler&#x27;s charges found little support and did not affect the progress of the Mission.

In the 1980s, Prem Rawat removed the Indian trappings from his message, and adopted a more Western style. Melton said the mission was disbanded [when] Prem Rawat personally renounced the trappings of Indian culture and religion, to make his teachings independent of culture, beliefs and lifestyles. Prem Rawat was no longer to be venerated as a god or regarded as a Perfect Master. The ashrams were closed along with the Denver headquarters (1979). The Divine Light Mission organization was replaced by Elan Vital; the U.S. organization&#x27;s name was changed to Elan Vital in 1983, by filing an entity name change. Prem Rawat asked to be referred to as &quot;Maharaji&quot; instead of &quot;Guru Maharaj Ji.&quot;

According to Ron Geaves, a religious scholar who has been associated with the teachings of Prem Rawat for the last thirty years:
Maharaji has chosen a route of perpetual transformation in which organizational forms are created and utilized and then destroyed, thus providing flexibility to deal with rapidly changing social attitudes, to provide pragmatic solutions to internal problems, and above all to keep his students focused on the core message rather than the peripheral requirements of organizational forms.
Since then the Elan Vital has been &quot;virtually invisible.&quot; Rawat stopped granting interviews and making public announcements of his visits. As of 2008, he has continued to write, lecture, and tour with the support of the Elan Vital and the Prem Rawat Foundation.

===DLM in India===

In 1975, Mata Ji took control of the DLM in India as a result of the rift and installed her eldest son, Satpal Rawat, as its head. A lawsuit in India resulted in his brother Satpal gaining control of the Divine Light Mission in India, and Rawat continuing to lead DLM in the rest of the world.

Satpal Rawat, now known as Shri Satpal Ji Maharaj, teaches &quot;Manav Dharam&quot; (the &quot;Dharam [Religion] of Mankind&quot;). He is also a politician and former Union Minister in India, and founded Manav Utthan Sewa Samiti, which he describes as &quot;an all-India registered voluntary social welfare and charitable organization&quot;, that is also &quot;making freely available the spiritual Knowledge which is the essence of all religions.&quot; Satpal Rawat&#x27;s supporters now assert that he is the rightful successor to his father, Hans Ji Maharaj. Scholars that have written about the succession report that Satpal and the rest of the family accepted and supported Prem&#x27;s declaration of succession for eight years.

The Divine United Organization (DUO) was an organization registered under the Societies Registration Act 21 of 1860 with the Registrar of Delhi in 1977, to disseminate the teachings of Prem Rawat in India. According to Geaves, DUO remained in India until it was replaced by Raj Vidya Bhavan [sic]. Raj Vidya Kender (Center for the King of Knowledge) states on its website that it was registered under the societies Registration Act in 1977, with registration No. 8845/77, &quot;by individuals eager to help in the dissemination of Maharaji&#x27;s message of hope and peace.&quot;

==Beliefs and practices==

According to some scholars, Shri Hans was influenced by both the Sant tradition and the Bhagavad Gita. Reinhart Hummel wrote that from the former came the reduction of Hinduism to the inner realization of the divine and the veneration of the guru, and from the latter the emphasis on the practical life. Hummel also noted that the DLM never developed a systematic doctrine, either during Hans&#x27; time or Prem Rawat&#x27;s time. Hummel further asserted that the influence of the North Indian Sant tradition was dominant in Hans&#x27; eclectic thinking, and that from the Sant tradition also came the rejection of outward rituals and ceremonies; the rejection of asceticism in favor of life as a householder; the rejection of veneration of idols, and the focus on the guru as the manifestation of the divine. Hummel also noted that the four meditation techniques are of central importance to Prem, as they were to Hans.

No rules or regulations were imposed, and no beliefs or ethical practices were taught. The fundamental practices of inner peace were embodied and experienced through satsang, service and meditation, the sum of which is an experience called &quot;Knowledge.&quot; Members of the DLM meditated formally twice daily and attended discourses on the Knowledge (known as satsang) when possible. According to Galanter &quot;satsang could be delivered to active members or to those with only a casual interest. It was something of a polemic interspersed with parables, and because members were bright and sophisticated, these discourses tended to be engaging, making use of both Hindu mythology and Western philosophy&quot;. In a study by Flo Conway and Jim Siegelman, former followers said that they had spent 32.9 hours per week in group-related processes and ritual and 19.9 hours in additional study or indoctrination (lectures, seminars, workshops etc). Vegetarianism was encouraged but not enforced except in ashrams and Divine Centers.

Five &quot;commandments&quot; were part of the Divine Light Mission&#x27;s teachings:
#Do not put off until tomorrow what you can do today.
#Constantly meditate and remember the Holy Name.
#Leave no room for doubt in the mind.
#Never delay attending satsang.
#Always have faith in God.

In the United States, the early years of the Divine Light Mission were marked by the rapid growth of loosely affiliated local ashrams, united mainly by a shared devotion to Guru Maharaj Ji. As the DLM became more and more structured and centralized, leadership and power came to be concentrated in the Denver headquarters. According to scholars, Prem Rawat&#x27;s desire to consolidate his power and authority over the U.S. movement led to increasing formalization, with rules and regulations for ashram living, standards for recruited &quot;candidates,&quot; and pressure towards certification of the movement&#x27;s teachers. According to scholars Foss and van der Lans, the teachings of Hans Ji Maharaj were minimized after 1975, and followers were expected to accept Prem Rawat as their personal savior.

David V. Barrett noted that the DLM movement was often criticized for emphasizing the superiority of subjective emotional experience over intellect. The sociologists Ralph Larkin and Daniel A. Foss made similar observations in 1978. In response, the religious scholar Ron Geaves, himself a member of the movement, accused Foss and Larkin of bias.

A 1981 article based on the Dutch branch of the Divine Light Mission, stated that the DLM had little philosophical background and that all its central creeds and tenets were described in the song associated with the Hindu ritual called aarti. Arti was sung to Prem Rawat in the morning and evening in ashrams.

Rawat says he does not charge for teaching people the techniques of Knowledge. Related organizations that support the dissemination of Rawat&#x27;s message are funded by donations. According to the Prem Rawat Foundation, it is supported by people who appreciate Rawat&#x27;s message and wish to help make it available to others.

==Members==
In a comparison of new religious movements, Gartrell and Shannon noted that people appeared to seek out such religious organizations to get answers to questions about ultimate meaning as well as answers to more prosaic issues. In discussing the differences in recruiting tactics employed by these groups, they placed the Divine Light Mission in the middle ground between movements in which recruits were love bombed, or overwhelmed by waves of intense sentiment, and those in which affective bonds were discouraged. They reported that close ties between newcomers and DLM members developed gradually over a period of three to four months, between initial contact and their attending a &quot;Knowledge session&quot;, and the emergent friendships were an important forum in which recruits aired doubts and discussed DLM beliefs. These relationships thus supplemented a very cognitive conversion process, in which active consideration of the movement&#x27;s ideas and beliefs was encouraged from the outset. They found little evidence to suggest that social rewards were orchestrated by the movement, either in degree or timing.

The sociologist James V. Downton, who studied the DLM for five years, reported that the &quot;idealism of these premies was one of the motivating forces behind their conversion [to DLM]. They wanted to create a more caring world&quot;. Five years after the subjects of his study became premies he wrote:
&quot;There is little doubt in my mind that these premies have changed in a positive way. Today, they seem less alienated, aimless, worried, afraid, and more peaceful, loving, confident, and appreciative of life. We could attribute these changes to surrender, devotion, and their involvement in the premie community. Each of these undoubtedly had a positive impact, but, if we accept what premies say, none were as critical as their experience of the universal spirit. Meditating on the life-energy for five years, they report having more positive attitudes about themselves.&quot;

According to Carroll Stoner and Jo Anne Parke, when they visited an ashram the premies &quot;appeared to be in control of their own lives and seemed to be achieving some measure of peace as a by-product of a lifestyle they feel is constructive and healthy&quot;. When the same members attended an appearance by Prem Rawat a week later, &quot;they lost control, sobbed and swayed and knelt to kiss his feet.&quot;

According to Foss and van der Lans, members who joined before 1975 tended to be young people from the counterculture who had used psychedelic drugs. Later members, they asserted, were older and more responsible with ordinary jobs who were disillusioned with conventional religions or other Eastern movements.

A study of group cohesiveness carried out by Marc Galanter in 1974, based on questionnaire responses given by 119 DLM members randomly chosen from festival registration lines, found that after two years involvement with DLM, members reported a considerable decline in psychological distress and drug use compared to their pre membership status. The study found that 45% of those surveyed had used marijuana daily before joining, while only 7% did so at the time of the study. Seventy-one percent reported psychological stress before joining compared to 37% at the time of the study. Overall, 38% had sought professional help for psychological problems before joining. These observations led to what Galanter&#x27;s describes as &quot;an apparent overall improvement in psychiatric state derived from conversion and its retention through continued membership&quot;, and that members, whether they were seriously distressed or not before joining, reported an improved emotional state after joining. Galanter reports that 82% of members surveyed were single, 97% were white, and 73% were in their twenties. The percentage of these with Catholic or Protestant backgrounds mirrored the general population, while there were ten times as many members with Jewish backgrounds as in the general population (21% versus 2%). Three-quarters of them had attended college.
James V. Downton conducted a comparative study of 41 DLM members from three US cities, 29 members of the Hare Krishna movement and 40 college students. Among the DLM members the average age was 23 and ranged from 19 to 29. They came from middle-class backgrounds, all were white and had attended an average of 1.5 years of college, similar to the Hare Krishna sample, though DLM members were less likely to have come from broken homes. Sixty-five percent of DLM members reported having religious experiences while tripping on LSD. Overall, 95% of DLM members had used psychedelic drugs, compared to 89% of Hare Krishna and 67% of the college student cohort. Compared to the college students, fewer DLM members had had religious upbringings and they tended to have had worse family experiences though only 17% came from &quot;broken homes&quot;.

One member, writing in the 1970s said that followers were &quot;nagged to donate funds of their own&quot; and some devotees signed pledges to donate a dollar a day to provide the Mission with some reliable income. One former accountant for the DLM said that new followers were asked to turn over their entire savings, sometimes hundreds of thousands of dollars, and in several cases their families contested the donations. He was quoted as saying &quot;it takes a lot of money to keep a guru.&quot; Bob Mishler, the mission&#x27;s executive director, talked one person into signing over power of attorney shortly after she joined. Mishler was sacked by Rawat in 1976.

==Ashrams==

=== In India ===
The Divine Light Mission began creating ashrams in India in the 1960s, starting with a small one in Rajasthan and a larger one called Satlok (&quot;Place of Truth&quot;) between Delhi and Haridwar. Khushwant Singh, who visited the Mission&#x27;s headquarters in Delhi in 1973 described it as being like a fortress with -high walls, an iron grilled gate enclosing a courtyard and a complex of buildings capable of housing 100 and with the capacity to feed 50,000 visitors on special occasions. Singh also described &quot;the lavish use of marble, wall-to-wall carpets, chandeliers and modern furnishings&quot; as evidence of affluence.

=== In the West ===
Only a small fraction of the overall DLM membership lived in organized ashrams during its short history but several dozen ashrams were formed in the U.S., Britain, Europe and Australia. Ashrams were run by &quot;general secretaries&quot; appointed by the national office. Each ashram had a &quot;house mother&quot; who oversaw cooking, washing, ironing, and food service but the normal isolation of the housewife and cook became a communal, everyone-pitchin-and-help festival. 
Followers (&quot;premies&quot;) who lived in them often worked part or full time at ordinary jobs and gave a sizable portion – sometimes all – of their income to the movement. Ashrams typically had an associated business, such as a Divine Sales outlet and a Divine Service Company. The ashram premies became the core of the Mission in the United States, but the ashrams themselves were not a source of income, never becoming more than self-sufficient. Followers wishing to stay in the ashrams established by Rawat were required to fill out detailed applications that focused on their trust funds, insurance policies, and other assets.

In Australia in the early 1970s, a small percentage of premies lived in ashrams. Some premies choose to live in an ashram for a couple of months, to get into their meditation, and then moved out into households or shared houses. Ashram rules demanded celibacy and abstinence from meat, alcohol, cigarettes and drugs. Married people, as well as single, lived in ashrams and, in their case, the practice of celibacy meant that they had sexual relations only with their marital partner. About three hundred people chose to live in communal houses and almost all households were non-smoking, non-drinking and vegetarian and, in some, the finances and energies were pooled for the good of all. Each household made its own decisions about life styles and often contained students and married couples.

In addition to the ashrams, there were many more residences with less formality. &quot;Premie Centers&quot;, were households committed to the Mission&#x27;s activity that donated 30% of their income and followed dietary rules, but that allowed married, non-celibate couples and children, and which weren&#x27;t subject to orders from the national Mission. &quot;Premie houses&quot; were informal households (with as many as 30 followers) held together by their shared commitments and values. Ashrams served as local coordinating centers for all the local devotees.

Carroll Stoner and Jo Anne Parke wrote in 1977 of their visits to several ashrams that &quot;there was no persuasion or cajoling for us to become part of this group. We did feel a sense of calm and peace in the ashrams. Marc Galanter, wrote in 1989 of his visit to a DLM ashram that —

 &quot;The atmosphere in the ashram was indeed quite striking. ... I was greeted in a friendly, even intimate fashion by people who were complete strangers. The intense communality of the members was immediately apparent, a quality that was clearly an important aspect of the group&#x27;s function. One could sense a closeness among those present, and an absence of the minor tensions that would be expected in a setting where two dozen people were living in tight quarters. ... Caring and intimacy, reflective of the group&#x27;s cohesiveness, seemed to mute any expression of animosity. ... I was made to feel as if I were entering a supportive envelope, to be protected from the rough edges of relationships in the outside world.

==Reception==

The Divine Light Mission was described in various and sometimes conflicting terms. It was called a new religious movement, a cult, a charismatic religious sect, an offshoot of Sant Mat, an alternative religion or spin-off from other traditional religions, a youth religion, a Radhasoami offshoot, an orthodox Sikh community, an Advait Mat related tradition, a proselytizing religion (&quot;Guru-ism&quot;), and a defunct religious movement. A study of terms used in U.S. newspapers and news magazines, which examined the media&#x27;s failure to use the more neutral terminology favored by social scientists, found that the Divine Light Mission was referred to as a &quot;sect&quot; in 10.3% of articles, as a &quot;cult&quot; in 24.1%, and as both in 13.8%. It was referred to as a &quot;sect&quot; in 21.4% of headlines, with 0% for &quot;cult&quot;.

The president and spokesman of the DLM said in 1977 that &quot;they represent a church rather than a religion&quot;.

In some countries, the DLM faced persecution and even banning. In 1972, in Argentina, as part of a crackdown on small religious groups by the military junta, 87 members of the DLM were arrested in Mar del Plata on charges of using drugs and practising their faith. The DLM, the Hare Krishnas and the Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses were banned, reportedly at the behest of the Roman Catholic Church. The Government Junta of Chile (1973) arrested over 200 members, including 12 foreigners, in 1974. The Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses and DLM were also banned by Singapore authorities.

Bromley and Hammond described the Divine Light Mission as belonging in a &quot;medium tension category&quot;, among movements that were seen by the public as peculiar rather than threatening, and to which society responded with watchfulness and ostracism. Psychiatrist Saul V. Levine wrote that the DLM, along with other groups such as the Unification Church, was widely held in low esteem – families felt their children were being financially exploited while the groups&#x27; leaders lived in &quot;ostentation and offensive opulence.&quot;

Ron Geaves states that the Divine Light Mission &quot;developed into a vigorous new religious movement with its own specific traits that included characteristics of a contemporary North Indian Sant panth (sectarian institution) and nirguna bhakti was combined with intense reverence for the living satguru and millennial expectations of the western counter-culture.&quot;

According to sociologist Pilarzyk the youth culture response – mainly from a decidedly leftist political perspective – was somewhat ambiguous, combining indifference with some instances of overt hostility. Pilarzyk mentioned that these criticisms usually focused on the perceived phoniness of the &quot;blissed-out premies&quot;, the &quot;hocuspocus&quot; aspects of the meditation, and the &quot;materialistic fixations&quot; and physical condition of the guru. These accounts are described by Pilarzyk as being quite negative and full of distortions from the DLM&#x27;s adherents point of view and drawing responses from them that varied from bewilderment and amusement to extreme defensiveness. Positive comments came from youth culture &quot;folk heroes&quot; such as anti-war activist Rev. Daniel Berrigan, radical lawyer William Kunstler, and singer-songwriter Cat Stevens.

Summarizing his 1985 review of studies of a number of new religious movements, such as The Jesus Movement, the Unification Church, the Children of God group in Europe and the Divine Light Mission, James T. Richardson stated that &quot;life in the new religions is often therapeutic instead of harmful&quot;, and suggested that the young people attracted to these movements were affirming their idealism by their involvement. Richardson asserted that his review found there was little data to support the almost completely negative picture of these groups painted by a few mental health professionals and others.

<text>Lorraine Hunt Lieberson (March 1, 1954 – July 3, 2006) was an American mezzo-soprano. She was noted for her performances of both Baroque era and contemporary works. Her career path to becoming a singer was unconventional – formerly a professional violist, Lieberson did not shift her full-time focus to singing until she was in her thirties.

==Life==
One of four children, Lorraine Hunt was born to parents who were both involved with opera in the San Francisco Bay Area. Her mother, Marcia, was a contralto and music teacher and her father, Randolph, taught music in high school and college. She performed as a child in Engelbert Humperdinck&#x27;s &quot;Hänsel &amp; Gretel&quot;, as a gingerbread boy. She returned to opera after taking part in a charity performance of the same work at a prison, this time taking Hänsel&#x27;s role. After this performance, she auditioned for the Met, at age 29.

While rehearsing in his opera Ashoka&#x27;s Dream at Santa Fe in 1997, she met composer Peter Lieberson. She married him two years later, changing her name to Lorraine Hunt Lieberson. Peter Lieberson&#x27;s song cycles &quot;Rilke Songs&quot; and &quot;Neruda Songs&quot;, both available on CD, were composed especially for his wife. 
Hunt Lieberson died from breast cancer in Santa Fe, New Mexico on July 3, 2006, at the age of 52. Only a few years previously, she had nursed her sister through her final illness with the same disease. Her husband fell victim to cancer too, falling ill in 2007 and dying in April 2011.

==Career==
Hunt Lieberson began her musical career as a violist, and became principal viola with the San Jose Symphony. At age 26, she turned to studying voice seriously at the Boston Conservatory of Music. Her professional career as a singer began in 1984, and in 1985 she made her operatic debut after meeting Peter Sellars, appearing in his 1985 production of Handel&#x27;s &quot;Giulio Cesare&quot;. She began her career as a soprano, singing roles such as Handel&#x27;s Theodora and Donna Elvira in Sellars&#x27; notorious production of Don Giovanni, but soon gravitated to the mezzo-soprano range. She began working with Craig Smith at Emmanuel Music as a violist, then sang in the chorus and began taking leading roles. Her work with Emmanuel continued throughout the 1980s and 1990s, and a recording of her work there in Bach and Handel was released in 2008 by Avie Records, &quot;Lorraine at Emmanuel.&quot;

Her debut performance at the Metropolitan Opera came during the 1999–2000 season, in eleven performances in the role of Myrtle Wilson in the world premiere of John Harbison&#x27;s &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; (first performance on December 20, 1999). During this same season, she also appeared as Sesto in the New York City Opera&#x27;s production of Mozart&#x27;s &quot;La clemenza di Tito&quot;, as well as playing La Pelerin in Kaija Saariaho&#x27;s &quot;Clemence&quot; at the Salzburg Festival. Her only other appearances at the Met came in two gala performances where she sang the spiritual &quot;Deep River&quot; (1999), and the fourth act of Bizet&#x27;s Carmen in 2000, and finally four performances in February, 2003 in the role of Dido in Berlioz&#x27;s Les Troyens. She was scheduled to sing the role of Orfeo in a new production of Gluck&#x27;s &quot;Orfeo ed Euridice&quot;. On her death, she was replaced by countertenor David Daniels, and the four performances run in May 2007 were dedicated to her memory.

Among the roles she sang during her career are Sesto (Mozart&#x27;s &quot;La clemenza di Tito&quot;), Carmen (Bizet&#x27;s opera of the same name), Beatrice (Berlioz&#x27;s &quot;Beatrice et Benedict&quot;), Mélisande in Pelléas et Mélisande (concert performances under Bernard Haitink), Médée (title role of Charpentier&#x27;s &quot;Médée&quot;, with William Christie and Les Arts Florissants), Phèdre (Jean-Philippe Rameau&#x27;s &quot;Hippolyte et Aricie&quot;), Theodora and Irene (Handel&#x27;s &quot;Theodora&quot;; Theodora at Göttingen with Nicholas McGegan, Irene at Glyndebourne with Christie), Minerva (Monteverdi&#x27;s &quot;Il ritorno d&#x27;Ulisse in patria&quot; with René Jacobs), Ottavia (Monteverdi&#x27;s L&#x27;incoronazione di Poppea with Marc Minkowski) and the title roles of Handel&#x27;s &quot;Ariodante&quot; and &quot;Serse&quot;.

She made a number of recordings, including works of Bach and Handel, as well as modern works.

Those who worked with Hunt Lieberson have spoken of her intense commitment to the detail of bringing a piece to life. Canadian vocal coach Denise Massé said in a &quot;New Yorker&quot; magazine interview,

Lorraine is like Callas in her determination to dig as deeply as possible into the character — to find all the grain in the wood.

In June 2005, Hunt Lieberson made her last appearance in Amsterdam, performing the Sellars staging of Bach&#x27;s &quot;Ich habe genug&quot;. Her final public performances were given on March 16, 17, and 18, 2006, at Orchestra Hall in Chicago, in Mahler&#x27;s Symphony No. 2 (&quot;Resurrection&quot;) with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra and Chorus, conductor Michael Tilson Thomas and soprano Celena Shafer.

In 2007, she posthumously received the Grammy Award for Best Classical Vocal Performance for her recording of her husband&#x27;s &quot;Rilke Songs&quot;, and in 2008 won again posthumously for her performance of her husband&#x27;s &quot;Neruda Songs&quot;.

==Recordings==
Besides those mentioned above, her most recent recordings include two of Johann Sebastian Bach&#x27;s Cantatas, BWV 82 (&quot;Ich habe genug&quot;) and BWV 199 (&quot;Mein Herze schwimmt im Blut&quot;), which made the New York Times top 10 classical albums of the year and No. 3 on the Billboard classical chart. Musical America recognized her as the 2001 Vocalist of the Year.

In the late 1980s and early 1990s, before her marriage to Peter Lieberson, Lorraine Hunt rose to prominence in the repertoire of George Frideric Handel. She performed and recorded opera and oratorios with the Göttingen International Handel Festival, under Nicholas McGegan&#x27;s direction. Her recordings include &quot;Ariodante&quot;, &quot;Serse&quot;, &quot;Messiah&quot; (as a soprano), &quot;Clori, Tirsi e Fileno&quot;, &quot;Theodora&quot;, &quot;Susanna&quot;, and two CDs of Handel arias. For the oratorio &quot;Theodora&quot;, she sang the roles of both Irene and the title character; she has also recorded Henry Purcell&#x27;s incidental music for &quot;The Fairy-Queen&quot; and the title role of &quot;Dido and Aeneas&quot; with McGegan.
Hunt Lieberson&#x27;s 1999 debut at Wigmore Hall, a performance of lieder by Schumann (&quot;Frauen-Liebe und Leben&quot;, Op. 42) and Brahms (Op. 57) with the pianist Julius Drake, was released as a live recording.

<text>South Wimbledon is a London Underground station in South Wimbledon, a suburb of Wimbledon in south-west London. The station is on the Northern line, situated between Colliers Wood and Morden stations. It is located on the corner of Merton High Street (A238) and Morden Road (A219). South Wimbledon is on the boundary between Travelcard Zone 3 and Zone 4.

==History==
The station was opened on 13 September 1926 as part of the Morden extension of the City &amp; South London Railway south from Clapham Common. On the original plan it had the name &quot;Merton Grove&quot;. For geographical accuracy, the station was shown as &quot;South Wimbledon (Merton)&quot; on tube maps from 1928, the name was also modified on platform signage, though not on the station building at street level. From the early-1950s, the &quot;(Merton)&quot; parenthetical fell out of use.
Along with the other stations on the Morden extension, the building was designed by architect Charles Holden. They were Holden&#x27;s first major project for the Underground. He was selected by Frank Pick, general manager of the Underground Electric Railways Company of London (UERL), to design the stations after he was dissatisfied with designs produced by the UERL&#x27;s own architect, Stanley Heaps. Built with a shop to each side, the modernist design takes the form of a double-height box clad in white Portland stone with a three-part glazed screen on the front façade divided by columns of which the capitals are three-dimensional versions of the Underground roundel. The central panel of the screen contains a large version of the roundel. The station is a Grade II listed building.

The station is the southernmost station on the London Underground network which has platforms in tunnels (Morden is in an open cut).

==Connections==
London Buses routes 57, 93, 131, 152, 219, and night route N155 serve the station.

Connection to Bus Route 470 and Tramlink at Morden Road tram stop is within walking distance of the station.

==Future==

A planned new line to the Tramlink light rail or a separate bus rapid transit (BRT) system called the Sutton Link will create a new tram or BRT/tube interchange with new platforms built at South Wimbledon somewhere close to the current station as part of Option 1, offering services to Sutton via St Helier.

<doc id="932933" wikidata="Q5030272" url="?curid=932933" title="Canadian Labour Party">
<text>The Canadian Labour Party (CLP) was an early, unsuccessful attempt at creating a national labour party in Canada. Although it ran candidates in the federal elections of 1917, 1921, 1925, and 1926, it never succeeded in its goal of providing a national forum for the Canadian labour movement. In Alberta, the CLP and its ally, the Dominion Labour Party, ran candidates in municipal elections and had some success. In most provinces, the CLP ceased to exist after 1928 or 1929. The later Co-operative Commonwealth Federation, forerunner of the modern NDP, largely filled the role of a &quot;Labour Party&quot; after its founding in 1932. 

==History==
The CLP was founded in 1917, on the initiative of the Trades and Labour Congress of Canada (TLC). It was intended to be the Canadian equivalent of the British Labour Party and endorsed a variety of reformist labour initiatives. In this sense, it was ideologically closer to A. W. Puttee&#x27;s original Winnipeg Labour Party than to the revolutionary Socialist Party of Canada.

The CLP endorsed a number of candidates in the 1917 election, although none were elected. In 1918, the Canadian TLC leaders adopted a &quot;non-partisan&quot; policy advocated by the American Federation of Labor and the CLP was largely abandoned. Its work was taken up by the Dominion Labor Party, formed in 1918. The DLP was active in Manitoba and also in Alberta (especially in Calgary).

The party was revived in 1921 by James Simpson. It again espoused a reformist platform, including the nationalization of banks and public utilities, major extensions in social and labour legislation, and lower taxes on the working class. The CLP was intended to be an &quot;umbrella&quot; organization for the various regional labour parties within Canada. Its primary failure on this front was its inability to convince the leaders of Manitoba&#x27;s Independent Labour Party to affiliate. Initially, this was due to a local split in the Winnipeg labour movement—the regional Dominion Labour Party (DLP) had been taken over by rightist elements, and the parliamentary labour caucus had retaliated by creating a separate ILP organization. When the DLP affiliated with the CLP, the ILP refused to do the same. ILP leaders such as J. S. Woodsworth and A. A. Heaps remained outside the CLP network throughout the 1920s.

In other regions, the CLP was more successful. The Alberta DLP did not fall into the hands of rightist labourites, and there was no controversy when this party became part of the CLP, although the DLP stayed separate in southern Alberta - it later, on its own, federated with the CCF. Alberta Labour MLAs and MPs, among them William Irvine, Edmonton&#x27;s Lionel Gibbs and provincial cabinet minister Alexander Ross, were elected in 1921, 1925, 1926 and 1930. (Irvine went on to be elected as CCF MP as well.)

The Federated Labour Party of British Columbia also joined the CLP, and many other reformist labour organizations throughout the country had some connections to the larger organization.

In spite of this, the CLP never became a coherent national party. Most provincial labour parties remained focused on their own local concerns, and the national party organization was comparatively weak (though it was usually successful in preventing vote-splitting among its affiliated groups). The national CLP was also weakened by controversies concerning the role of Communists within the party.

==Relationship with Communists==
In its earliest years, the Communist Party of Canada supported a united front against the capitalist class. Its provincial organizations joined the CLP in various stages between 1922 and 1924, and the leaders of the Communist Party believed that they would eventually be able to shift CLP policy to reflect their own policies. By the late 1920s, Communist groups had come to dominate the CLP in some regions of the country. (It may be noted that the Communist Party seems to have accepted the CLP&#x27;s ban on electoral competition between affiliated groups, even to the point of endorsing some rightist labour candidates in whom they had little confidence.)

The Communist presence did not always provoke internal dissension (several Communist delegates were greeted with cheers at CLP conventions), but it did prevent some moderate social democrats from joining. In 1927, social democrats in the Ontario CLP withdrew from the organization to create their own Independent Labour Party. In the same year, J. S. Woodsworth accused the CLP of being controlled by Communist interests, and called for a new national alliance of Independent Labour Parties to take its place.

The CLP&#x27;s alliance with the Communist Party ended in 1928-29, following a shift in Comintern policy away from the &quot;united front&quot; strategy. The provincial Communist parties either left the CLP during this period, or were expelled.

In most parts of the country, the resulting loss in membership was enough to bring about the effective demise of the CLP. The one exception to this rule appears to have been in Alberta.

==Alberta==
Despite the break with Communists, in Alberta, the CLP showed significant successes in the late 1920s and 1930s. Lionel Gibbs was a long-time activist both in the Alberta Legislature and on Edmonton&#x27;s city council for many years. The CLP elected a near-majority to Edmonton&#x27;s city council in 1929 and held power on Edmonton city council in 1934 and 1935. It federated with the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF) in 1935, but the Social Credit wave drastically reduced popular support. It maintained a semi-autonomous existence until 1942 when it formally merged with the Alberta CCF.
&quot;See Labour candidates and parties in Canada#In Alberta for a list of Alberta Labour representatives in the Alberta legislature&quot;

==Legacy==

Although the CLP did not provide a coherent framework for the various labour organizations across the country,
it should get partial credit for the 1920s elections of Calgary&#x27;s CLP/DLP MPs William Irvine and Joseph Tweed Shaw and Winnipeg&#x27;s ILP MP J. S. Woodsworth. The party was a prototype for later pan-Canadian labour parties such as the CCF and the New Democratic Party.

Also of note is the fact that the CLP maintained a formal alliance with labour organizations during its existence, as was done by its successor, the NDP (but was not done by the CCF, except in regards its relationship with the Brotherhood of Railway Employees).

<text>False advertising is the act of publishing, transmitting, distributing or otherwise publicly circulating an advertisement containing a false claim, or statement, made intentionally, or recklessly, to promote the sale of property, goods or services. A false advertisement can be classified as deceptive if the advertiser deliberately misleads the consumer, rather than making an unintentional mistake. A number of governments use regulations or other laws and methods to limit false advertising.

== Types of deception ==
False advertising can take one of two broad forms: an advertisement may be factually wrong, or intentionally misleading. Both types of false advertising may be presented in a number of ways.

=== Photo manipulation ===

Photo manipulation is a technique often used in the cosmetics field and for weight loss commercials to advertise false (or non-typical) results and give consumers a false impression of a product&#x27;s capabilities. Photo manipulation can alter the audience&#x27;s perception of a product&#x27;s effectiveness; for example, makeup advertisements may use airbrushed photos. Another example is using darkroom exposure techniques, darkening and lightening photographs. Some manipulation techniques are praised for the impressive artwork, whereas others are looked down upon, especially in cases where others are deceived.

=== Hidden fees and surcharges ===
Hidden fees can be a way for companies to trick unwary consumers into paying more for a product which was advertised at a specific price to increase profits without raising the price of the product. The Fine print may be used to obscure fees and surcharges in advertising. Another way to hide fees is to exclude shipping costs when listing the price of goods online, making an item look less expensive than it actually is. A number of hotels charge resort fees, which are not typically included in the advertised price of a room.

=== Fillers and oversized packaging ===
Some products are sold with fillers, which increases the legal weight of a product with something that costs the producer very little compared to what the consumer thinks they are buying. Some food advertisements use this technique in products such as meat, which can be injected with broth or brine (up to 15 percent), or TV dinners filled with gravy (or other sauce) instead of meat. Malt and ham have been used as filler in peanut butter. Non-meat fillers may be high in carbohydrates and low in nutritional value; one example is a cereal binder, which usually contains flour and oatmeal. Some products may come in a large container which is mostly empty, leading a consumer to believe that the total amount of food is greater than it is.

=== Falsifying quality and origin ===
Another form of deceptive advertising falsifies the quality or origin of a product. If an advertiser shows a product with a certain quality but knows the product has defects or is not of the same quality, they are falsely advertising the product. Producers may misrepresent where a product is manufactured, saying (for example) that it was produced in the United States when it was produced in another country.

=== Misleading health claims ===

The labels &quot;diet,&quot; &quot;low fat,&quot; &quot;sugar-free,&quot; &quot;healthy&quot; and &quot;good for you&quot; are often associated with products which claim to improve health. Advertisers, aware of consumer desire to live healthier and longer, describe their products accordingly. Food advertising influences consumer preferences and shopping habits. Highlighting certain ingredients may mislead consumers into thinking they are buying healthy products when, in fact, they are not. Dannon&#x27;s Activia yogurt was advertised as scientifically proven to boost the immune system, and was sold at a much higher price. The company was ordered to pay $45 million in damages to consumers after a lawsuit.

Food companies may end up in court for using misleading tactics such as:
* Using a &quot;tick panel&quot; above a nutritional label, with a large, bold font and brighter colors
* Highlighting one healthy ingredient on the front of a package with a large check mark (a &quot;tick&quot;) next to it
* Using words like &quot;healthy&quot; and &quot;natural&quot;, which are regarded as weasel claims: words contradicting claims which follow them
* Using words like &quot;helps&quot; on product labels, which may mislead consumers into thinking a product help

Many US advertisements for dietary supplements include the disclaimer, &quot;This product is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease&quot;, since products intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent disease must undergo FDA testing and approval.

=== Comparative advertising ===
Companies use a number of advertising techniques to assert that their products are the best available. One of the most common marketing tactics is comparative advertising, where &quot;the advertised brand is explicitly compared with one or more competing brands and the comparison is obvious to the audience.&quot; Laws about comparative advertising have changed in the United States; perhaps the most drastic change occurred with the 1946 Lanham Act, the backbone of all cases involving false advertisement. Marketing strategies have become more aggressive, however, and the provisions of the Lanham Act have become outdated.

USCA §1125 was passed in 2012 as an addition to the Lanham Act, clarifying issues about comparative advertising. Anyone who uses words, symbols or misleading descriptions of fact in commerce which are likely to cause consumer confusion about their own product, or misrepresents the nature, characteristics or qualities of their own (or another&#x27;s) product, is civilly liable. USCA §1125 addresses gaps in the Lanham Act, but is not a perfect remedy. Advertisements that present false descriptions of fact are considered deceptive, with no additional evidence required; when an advertisement makes a factual (but misleading) claim, however, evidence of confusion of an average consumer is needed.

== Puffing ==
Puffing (or puffery) is exaggerating a product&#x27;s worth with meaningless or unsubstantiated terms, language based on opinion rather than fact, or the manipulation of data. Examples include superlatives such as &quot;greatest of all time,&quot; &quot;best in town,&quot; and &quot;out of this world,&quot; or a restaurant&#x27;s claim that it had &quot;the world&#x27;s best-tasting food.&quot;

Puffing is not an illegal form of false advertising, and may be seen as a humorous way to attract consumer attention. Puffing may be used as a defense against charges of deceptive advertising when it is formatted as opinion rather than fact. Omitted, or incomplete, information is characteristic of puffery.

=== Manipulation of terms ===

Terms used in advertising may be used imprecisely. Depending on the jurisdiction, &quot;organic&quot; food may not have a clear legal definition; &quot;light&quot; has been used to describe foods low in calories, sugars, carbohydrates, salt, texture, viscosity, or even light in color. Labels such as &quot;all-natural&quot; are frequently used, but essentially meaningless.

Before the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act, tobacco companies regularly used terms like &quot;low tar&quot;, &quot;light&quot;, &quot;ultra-light&quot; and &quot;mild&quot; to imply that such products had less detrimental effects on health. In 2009, the United States banned manufacturers from labeling tobacco products with these terms. When the U.S. United Egg Producers used an &quot;Animal Care Certified&quot; logo on egg cartons, the Better Business Bureau said that it misled consumers by implying a higher level of animal care than was actually the case.

In 2010, Kellogg&#x27;s Rice Krispies cereal claimed that it could improve a child&#x27;s immunity. The company was forced to discontinue such claims. In 2015, Kellogg&#x27;s advertised its Kashi products as &quot;all natural&quot; when they contained a number of artificial ingredients; Kellogg&#x27;s paid $5 million to settle a lawsuit.

=== Incomplete comparison ===

&quot;Better&quot; means that one item is superior to another in some way; &quot;best&quot; means that it is superior to all others in some way. Advertisers often fail to specify the basis on which products are compared (such as price, size or quality) and, in the case of &quot;better,&quot; what the product is compared to (a competitor&#x27;s product, an earlier version of their product, or nothing at all). Without defining the terms &quot;better&quot; and &quot;best&quot;, they become meaningless. An ad that says, &quot;Our cold medicine is better&quot; could be claiming that it is an improvement over taking nothing at all. Another often-seen example is &quot;better than the leading brand&quot;, with a statistic attached; the &quot;leading brand&quot;, however, is undefined.

=== Inconsistent comparison ===

In an inconsistent comparison, an item is compared with others only in terms of favorable attributes; this conveys the false impression that it is the best of all products overall. One variant is a website which lists competitors whose price for a particular item is higher, ignoring competitors whose price is lower.

=== Misleading illustrations ===
A common example is the serving suggestion pictures on food-product boxes, which include ingredients other than those included in the package. The &quot;serving suggestion&quot; disclaimer is a legal requirement for an illustration including items not included in the purchase, but if a customer fails to notice (or understand) the caption they may assume that all depicted items are included.

Some advertised photos of hamburgers convey the impression that the food is larger than it really is, and foods are &quot;styled&quot; to appear unrealistically appetizing. Products sold unassembled or unfinished may have a picture of the finished product, without a picture of what the customer is actually buying. Video-game commercials may include what are essentially short CGI films, with considerably better graphics than the actual game.

=== False coloring ===
Consumers may buy an item based on the color they saw in an advertisement. When used to make people think food is riper, fresher, healthier, or otherwise more desirable than it really is, food coloring may be deceptive. When combined with added sugar or corn syrup, bright colors convey a subconscious impression of healthy, ripe fruit, full of antioxidants and phytochemicals.

One variation is packaging which obscures the color of the foods within, such as red mesh bags holding yellow oranges or grapefruit which then appear to be a ripe orange or red. Regularly stirring minced meat on sale at a deli can make the surface meat remain red (and appear fresh) when it would oxidize (and brown), showing its true age if left unstirred. Some sodas are sold in colored bottles when the actual product is clear.

=== Angel dusting ===

Angel dusting is a process where an ingredient which would be beneficial in a certain quantity is added in insignificant quantities, which would have no consumer benefit. The advertiser then says that the product contains that ingredient, misleading a consumer into expecting that they will experience the benefit. A cereal may claim that it contains &quot;12 essential vitamins and minerals,&quot; but the amounts of each may be only one percent (or less) of the Reference Daily Intake and provide virtually no nutritional benefit.

=== Chemical free ===

A number of products are advertised with some form of the statement &quot;chemical free&quot; or &quot;no chemicals.&quot; Because everything on Earth is made up of chemicals except for a few elementary particles formed by radioactive decay or present in minute quantities from solar wind and sunlight, a chemical-free product is impossible. The label can indicate that a product contains no synthetic or exceptionally-harmful chemicals but, because the word &quot;chemical&quot; carries a stigma, it is often used without clarification.

=== Bait-and-switch ===

Bait-and-switch is a deceptive marketing tactic generally used to lure customers into a store. A company will advertise a product in an attractive way (the bait). The product is not available for some reason, however, and the company will try to sell something more expensive than what was originally advertised (the switch). Although only a small percentage of shoppers will buy the more expensive product, an advertiser may still profit.

Bait advertising is also used in other contexts; in an online job advertisement, a potential candidate may be deceived about working conditions, pay, or other variables. An airline may &quot;bait&quot; a potential client with a bargain before raising the price or redirecting them to a more expensive flight.

Businesses can avoid charges of misleading or deceptive conduct by following a few guidelines:
* Reasonable time frame, reasonable quantities: Businesses must supply publicized merchandise or services at the promoted cost for a sensible (or expressed) time frame and in sensible (or expressed) amounts.
* Qualifying statements: Qualifying statements such as &quot;in store and online now&quot; could still leave a business open to charges of bait advertising if sensible amounts of the publicized item are not available.
* Advertising deadlines: When advertising products or prices which are available for a limited time, the deadline (or expiration) should be made clear to consumers.
* Rain checks: When (through no fault of its own) a business cannot supply merchandise or service as promoted, it should provide the product (or service) as soon as it becomes available.
* Online claims: If a company operates primarily on the Internet, it must keep its website updated to avoid misleading customers.

In some countries, such as Australia, bait advertising can have severe legal penalties.

=== Guarantee without a remedy ===
If a company does not say what it will do if a product fails to meet expectations, it is generally free to do little or nothing. This is due to a legal technicality which states that a contract cannot be enforced unless it provides a basis for determining a breach and for providing a remedy for a breach. Fraud in crowdfunding communities such as Indiegogo and Kickstarter can be difficult to prosecute.

=== &quot;No risk&quot; ===
Advertisers can falsely claim that there is no risk in trying their product. They may charge a customer&#x27;s credit card for a product, offering a full refund if not satisfied. However, the customer may not receive the product; they may be billed for things they did not want; they may be unable to call the company to authorize a return; they may not be refunded an item&#x27;s shipping and handling costs, or they may have to pay for return shipping.

== Neurological deception ==

=== Mirror neurons ===
Mirror neurons are found in several sections of the human brain. They are responsible for mirroring a behavior (or movement) seen in others. In marketing, mirror neurons have been used to stimulate consumers to do what those in advertisements do.

=== Subliminal advertising ===

In subliminal advertising, products (or ideas) are advertised to consumers without their knowledge. Its purpose is to induce a consumer to buy an advertised item while they are unaware that they are being influenced into making a purchase. This form of advertising exploits a consumer&#x27;s sub-limenal state.

== Regulation and enforcement ==

=== United States ===
The United States federal government regulates advertising through the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) with truth-in-advertising laws and enables private litigation through a number of laws, most significantly the Lanham Act (trademark and unfair competition). Specifically, under Section 43(a), false advertising is an actionable civil claim. Therefore, a party successful in a suit may be awarded damages or may be entitled to injunctive relief. In order to bring a false advertising claim, it is imperative that the plaintiff demonstrate that the defendant actually made false/misleading statement to their own or another&#x27;s product, that at least a tendency to deceive a large amount of the intended audience was present, and that there was a likelihood of injury to the plaintiff, among other reasons.

The goal is prevention rather than punishment, reflecting the difference between civil and criminal law. A typical remedy is ordering an advertiser to stop its illegal acts, or to include disclosure of additional information which eliminates potentially-deceptive material. Corrective advertising may be mandated, but no fines or prison time is imposed except for the rare instances where an advertiser refuses to stop despite an order to do so.

The state governments General Business Law § 349 covers an essential part of the false advertisement regulation including &quot;Deceptive acts or practices in the conduct of any business, trade or commerce or in the furnishing of any service in this state are hereby declared unlawful.&quot; In the Chimienti v. Wendy&#x27;s Int&#x27;l, LLC Case the plaintiff failed to demonstrate that he suffered injury and did not sufficiently allege that the advertisements were materially misleading, so the claims were dismissed under the New York General Business Law. &quot;For a claim to be considered a cause of action to recover damages pursuant to General Business Law § 349 has three elements: first, that the challenged act or practice was consumer-oriented; second, that it was misleading in a material way; and third, that the plaintiff suffered injury as a result of the deceptive act.&quot;

In 1905, Samuel Hopkins Adams released a series of articles detailing misleading claims by the patent medicine industry. The public outcry resulting from the articles led to the creation of the Food and Drug Administration the following year.

In 1941, the Supreme Court reviewed &quot;Federal Trade Commission v. Bunte Brothers, Inc.&quot; under Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act of 1914 with regard to &quot;unfair or deceptive acts or practices&quot;. The court reviewed three false-advertising cases in 2013 and 2014: &quot;Static Control v. Lexmark&quot; (concerning who may sue under the Lanham Act), &quot;ONY, Inc. v. Cornerstone Therapeutics, Inc.&quot; and &quot;POM Wonderful LLC v. Coca-Cola Co.&quot;

State governments have a number of unfair-competition laws which regulate false advertising, trademarks, and related issues. Many are similar to those of the FTC, and may be copied so closely that they are known as &quot;little FTC acts.&quot; According to the National Consumer Law Center, the lawsknown as &quot;unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts and practices laws&quot; (UDAAP or UDAP laws)vary widely in the protection they offer consumers. In California, one such statute is the Unfair Competition Law (UCL). The UCL &quot;borrows heavily from section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act&quot;, and has developed a body of case law.

Civil penalties may range from thousands to millions of dollars, and advertisers are sometimes ordered to provide all customers who purchased the product with a partial (or full) refund. Corrective advertising, disclosures, and other informational remedies may also be ordered. Advertisers may have to warn buyers of false statements in advertisements, make clear disclosures in future advertisements, or provide customers with other information to correct misinformation in an original ad.

=== United Kingdom ===
Advertising in the UK is regulated under the Consumer Protection from Unfair Trading Regulations 2008 (CPR), the &quot;de facto&quot; successor of the Trade Descriptions Act 1968. It is designed to implement the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive, part of a common set of European minimum standards for consumer protection which legally bind advertisers in England, Scotland, Wales, and parts of Ireland. The regulations, which focus on business-to-consumer (B2C) interactions, are modeled with a table meant to assess unfairness. Evaluations are made against four tests in the regulations which indicate deceptive advertising:
* Contrary to the requirements of professional diligence
* False or deceptive practice in relation to a specific list of key factors
* Omission of material information (unclear or untimely information)
* Aggressive practice by harassment, coercion or undue influence

These elements of deceptive advertising may impair a consumer&#x27;s ability to make an informed decision, limiting their freedom of choice. The system resembles FTC regulation of behavioral advertising in prohibiting false and deceptive messaging, unfair and unethical commercial practices, and omitting important information; it differs in monitoring aggressive sales practices (regulation seven), which include high-pressure practices which go beyond persuasion. Harassment and coercion are not defined but rather interpreted as any undue physical and psychological pressure (in advertising). Each case is analyzed individually, allowing the authority to promote compliance with its enforcement policies, priorities, and available resources.

The CPR mandates different standards authorities for each country:
* In England and Wales, standards offenses are handled by the Local Authority Trading Standards Services (TSS).
* In Northern Ireland, offenses are handled by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment.
* In Scotland, offenses are evaluated (and potentially prosecuted) by the Crown Office and the Procurator Fiscal Service on behalf of the Lord Advocate.

=== Australia ===
The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (also known as the ACCC) is responsible for ensuring that all businesses and consumers act in accordance with the Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Act 2010 and fair-trade and consumer-protection laws (ACCC, 2016). Each state and territory has its own consumer-protection or consumer-affairs agency:
* ACT - Office of Fair Trading (OFT)
* NSW - Fair Trading
* QueenslandOffice of Fair Trading
* South Australia - Office of Consumer and Business Services (CBS)
* Tasmania - Consumer Affairs &amp; Fair Trading
* Consumer Affairs Victoria (CAV)
* Western Australia - Department of Commerce

The ACCC is designed to assist consumers, businesses, industries, and infrastructure nationwide. It assists the consumer by making available the rights, regulations, obligations, and procedures for refunds and returns, complaints, faulty products, and guarantees of products and services. They also develop laws and guidelines in relation to unfair practices and misleading or deceptive conduct.

There are many similarities in the laws and regulation between the Australian ACCC, New Zealand&#x27;s FTA, the U.S. FTC, and the United Kingdom&#x27;s CPR. The goals of these policies are to support fair trade and competition and to reduce deceptive and false practices in advertising. A number of countries have agreements with the International Consumer Protection and Enforcement Network (ICPEN).

=== New Zealand ===

The Fair Trading Act 1986 aims to promote fair competition and trading in New Zealand. The act prohibits certain conduct in trade, provides for the disclosure of information available to the consumer relating to the supply of goods and services, and regulates product safety. Although it does not require businesses to provide all information to consumers in every circumstance, businesses are obliged to ensure that the information they provide is accurate and important information is not withheld from consumers.

A number of sales practices intended to mislead consumers are illegal under the Fair Trading Act. The act also applies to certain activities whether or not the parties are &quot;in trade,&quot; such as employment advertising, pyramid selling, and supplying products covered by product-safety and consumer-information standards.

Consumers and businesses can rely on and take legal action under the act. Consumers may contact the trader and assert rights stated in the act. If the issues are not resolved, the consumer (or anyone else) can take legal action under the act. The Commerce Commission is also empowered to take enforcement action when allegations are sufficiently serious to meet its criteria.

There are also four consumer-information standards:
* Country of Origin (Clothing and Footwear) Labeling Regulations 1992
* Fiber Content Labeling Regulations 2000
* Used Motor Vehicles Regulations 2008
* Water Efficiency Regulations 2010

=== India ===
The voluntary Advertising Standards Council of India (ASCI) was established in 1985 to evaluate the truth and fairness of advertisements. The ASCI also aims to ensure that ads are respectful to widely accepted public decency principles. It has a number of codes, including the Press Council Act of 1978, the News Broadcasters Association&#x27;s Code of Conduct, the Young Persons Act of 1956, the Consumer Protection Act of 1986, the Drugs and Cosmetics Act of 1940, and the Food Safety and Standards Act of 2006. Surrogate advertising a major misleading advertising tactic in India. Many companies use this idea to advertise Betting, Gambling, online fantacy gaming and casino apps.

<text>LacusCurtius is the ancient Graeco-Roman part of a large history website, currently hosted on a server at the University of Chicago. It went online on August 26, 1997, a few weeks before both Wikipedia and Google; in October 2024 it had &quot;3916 webpages, 779 photos, 772 drawings &amp; engravings, 120 plans, 139 maps.&quot; The overall site is the creation of William P. Thayer.

==Overview==
The main resources to be found on it include:

* a number of Latin and Greek texts, usually in English translation, and often in the original language as well,
* &quot;Smith&#x27;s Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities&quot;,
* &quot;Platner&#x27;s Topographical Dictionary of Ancient Rome&quot;,
* several secondary works, mostly on Rome and Roman Britain,
* a photogazetteer of Roman remains and medieval churches of central Italy including the city of Rome,
* an often-cited online copy of Richard Hinckley Allen&#x27;s &quot;Star Names: Their Lore and Meaning&quot;,
* the Antiquary&#x27;s Shoebox, a selection of articles from classical studies journals that are now in public domain.

The parent site also includes a large American history section (mostly military and naval history), sections on World War II history, British, French and Ukrainian history, and other materials, as well as a Gazetteer of Italy; the latter is somewhat of a misnomer, being almost entirely about central Italy, especially Umbria, for which it is a useful source.

In the early days of the site, LacusCurtius was often the only English source online for a number of the primary texts presented. The texts and translations are not scanned, but usually rekeyed by hand from Loeb Classical Library editions that had entered public domain, and less often from other sources. Though many of these primary texts could after a decade be found elsewhere on the web, Thayer&#x27;s versions feature enhanced functionalities. They provide direct word-links to terms in Smith&#x27;s &quot;Dictionary&quot; and other secondary sources on LacusCurtius and elsewhere, and often link quoted or cited passages to the full text of other ancient sources. Thayer corrects typographical errors in the Loeb editions, with a note on the original error, and on occasion provides his own commentary to update his source material, most of which is near or more than a century old.

In similar fashion, Thayer&#x27;s edition of Smith&#x27;s &quot;Dictionary&quot; is keyed in article by article, and is linked to other entries and to the primary sources cited. Each entry appears on an individual page, except for very short entries, which are collected on alphabetical index pages that link to the major articles. Thayer also provides topical indices for subjects such as the Roman military, law, and daily life. Thayer has stated that his interest in subject matter pertaining to ancient Greece is slim, and his selection from Smith&#x27;s is predominantly Roman, with Greek topics included as they illuminate Roman texts.

The proper spelling of &quot;LacusCurtius&quot; is as a single CamelCase word, with no space; the idea was to avoid interfering with searches for the original Lacus Curtius in ancient Rome.

<text>The Case Study Houses were experiments in American residential architecture sponsored by &quot;Arts &amp; Architecture&quot; magazine, which commissioned major architects of the day to design and build inexpensive and efficient model homes for the United States residential housing boom caused by the end of World War II and the return of millions of soldiers. The program yielded 36 designs and 25 constructed homes, concentrated in Southern California.

== History ==
The &quot;Case Study&quot; House program, spearheaded by &quot;Arts &amp; Architecture&quot; editor John Entenza, was announced in the January 1945 issue of the magazine. The magazine initially commissioned eight nationally known architects to create contemporary single-family homes within a specified budget, with the magazine itself serving as the &quot;client&quot; for each project.

The program was envisioned as a creative response to the impending building boom expected to follow the housing shortages of the Great Depression and World War II. The initial program announcement stated that &quot;each house must be capable of duplication and in no sense be an individual performance&quot; and that &quot;the overall program will be general enough to be of practical assistance to the average American in search of a home in which he can afford to live.&quot; Entenza encouraged participating architects to use donated materials from industry and manufacturers to create low-cost, modern housing prototypes that might foster a dialogue between architectural professionals and laymen.

The first eight architects commissioned and profiled in the January 1945 announcement of the program were JR Davidson, Sumner Spaulding, Richard Neutra, Eero Saarinen, William Wilson Wurster, Charles Eames, and Ralph Rapson. The program employed a &quot;design-build-publish&quot; model, publishing the prototypes alongside the architects&#x27; comments. JR Davidson&#x27;s design was the first feature of the series, with the exteriors and interiors appearing in the February and March 1945 edition of &quot;Arts &amp; Architecture,&quot; respectively. Davidson&#x27;s design was labeled Case Study House #1, thus inaugurating the numbering convention, which refers to the order in which designs were published, rather than constructed.

As outlined in the program announcement, construction was intended to commence immediately following the World War II moratorium on domestic housing construction. Case Study House #11, also designed by Davidson, was the first house constructed, and was permitted in December 1945. Construction on Case Study House #11 began on January 9, 1946, prompting the design for the home to precede the publication of Case Study House #10.

The program announcement called for each house to be open to the public for a six to eight weeks upon the conclusion of construction. Houses were to be furnished &quot;under a working arrangement between the architect, the designer, and the furniture manufacturer&quot;. By January 1949, the magazine had published designs, models, for 19 houses. Of the 19 profiled, nine houses were complete and five were &quot;in various stages of construction.&quot; Several houses were not constructed for unspecified reasons beyond the control of the magazine and architects.

In January 1949, the magazine announced &quot;having come this far with it, we feel that we have proved our point to the extent that we need no longer be so ambitious as to numbers,&quot; and pivoted to sponsoring one house each year, starting with Case Study House 1949.

In total, the program commissioned 36 prototypes, of which 25 were constructed. The majority of the constructed houses were built in Los Angeles County. Additional case study houses were built in San Rafael, California; San Diego, California; and Phoenix, Arizona. Of the unbuilt houses, #19 was to have been built in Atherton, California, while #27 was to have been built in Smoke Rise, New Jersey.

A number of the houses appeared in the magazine in iconic black-and-white photographs by architectural photographer Julius Shulman. In 1989 Shulman&#x27;s photographs of the Case Study Houses were exhibited at the Los Angeles Museum of Contemporary Art in an exhibit titled &quot;Blueprints for Modern Living.&quot;

The Eames House was added as a stand-alone site to the National Register in 2006. In 2013, a group of 10 case study houses, all located in Southern California, were added to the National Register of Historic Places, while House #23A was determined eligible for the registry, but not officially listed due to an objection by the owner.

== Stylistic Commonalities ==
Houses in the program shared common design elements, including open floor plans, clean lines, floor to ceiling glass, steel framing, and a flat roof. Most of the houses were &quot;predominately modular in design.&quot;

<doc id="932949" wikidata="Q7912719" url="?curid=932949" title="ValueTales">
<text>ValueTales is a series of 43 simple biographical children&#x27;s books published primarily by the now-defunct Value Communications, Inc. in La Jolla, California. They were written by Dr. Spencer Johnson and Ann Donegan Johnson, and illustrated by Stephen Pileggi.

Each book gives a simplified and semi-fictionalized biography of a historical figure as an allegory, illustrating the value of a characteristic. Each volume is a white pictorial glossy hardback book around 60 pages long with a brightly colored cartoon of the figure, along with some anthropomorphic item or animal that narrates the subject&#x27;s life throughout the book.

The title of each book is &quot;The Value of &quot;x&quot;: The story of &quot;y&quot; &quot;, where &quot;x&quot; is the characteristic exemplified and &quot;y&quot; is the exemplary person (i.e. &quot;The Value of Determination: The Story of Helen Keller&quot;). Early editions of the books use a different format: &quot;The Valuetale of &quot;y&quot;: The value of &quot;x&quot; &quot;. So the first edition of the Helen Keller book is called &quot;The ValueTale of Helen Keller : the value of determination&quot;

The books were quite popular in homes, elementary school libraries, pediatrics offices, and sunday schools across North America. Most are out of print. In October 2010, Simon &amp; Schuster Children&#x27;s Books published an anthology containing five of the ValueTales books, with new illustrations by Dan Andreason.

<doc id="932962" wikidata="Q3045078" url="?curid=932962" title="The Unpleasant Profession of Jonathan Hoag">
<text>The Unpleasant Profession of Jonathan Hoag is a science fantasy novella by American writer Robert A. Heinlein. It was originally published in the October 1942 issue of &quot;Unknown Worlds&quot; magazine under the pseudonym of &quot;John Riverside&quot;. The novella also lends its title to a collection of Heinlein&#x27;s short stories published in 1959.

==Plot summary==
Jonathan Hoag, a lover of art and fine dining living in Chicago, realizes that he has no memory of his daytime activities when asked, at an evening dinner, what he does for a living. Furthermore, when he washes his hands in the evening, he discovers a red-brown substance, possibly dried blood, under his fingernails.

He contacts a detective agency, Randall &amp; Craig, and asks them to follow him during the day. The partners, actually the husband and wife team of Ted and Cynthia Randall, agree to this. They try to collect fingerprints from their client, but find that Hoag leaves none, even when not wearing gloves. The few memories Hoag has turn out to be false, except for his home address, and a doctor, Potiphar T. Potbury, whom Hoag consulted about the substance under his fingernails, had thrown him out of his office and told him not to return.

The first time the pair tail Hoag, Cynthia sees him turn and talk to her husband. Then Cynthia is menaced by Hoag after she tails him in an office building. When she is reunited with Ted, he tells her that he had a completely different experience: after uneventfully tailing Hoag into the building and up to Hoag&#x27;s office on the thirteenth floor, Ted discovers that Hoag is a jeweler working for a company called Detheridge &amp; Co., and that the red substance is jeweler&#x27;s rouge. Both realize that something is terribly wrong, especially once they discover that the building has no thirteenth floor.

Ted has a series of &quot;dreams&quot; in which he is taken through a mirror into the offices of Detheridge &amp; Co., where he is told to leave Hoag alone by an assemblage of conservative businessmen. He ignores the dreams until, in one final dream, Cynthia is taken through as well. The businessmen reveal themselves as &quot;Sons of the Bird&quot;, disciples of an old pagan religion; Hoag is a nemesis of theirs. They cause something to be sucked out of Cynthia into a bottle, and return her and Ted to their apartment.

Ted wakes up to find Cynthia in an apparent coma. He realizes that the dreams were true, and paints over all the mirrors in the apartment. He then calls Potbury, the only doctor he knows, to come and examine Cynthia. Potbury diagnoses her with &quot;lethargica gravis&quot;, but when Ted repeats the mantra of the Sons of the Bird to him, &quot;The Bird is Cruel!&quot;, Potbury compulsively covers his face just as the sons did. Realizing Potbury is one of them, Ted overpowers him and locks him in the bathroom. He calls Hoag, who comes to the apartment. Told about Potbury, Hoag says that &quot;lethargica gravis&quot; is just a way of saying &quot;deep sleep&quot;. They open the bathroom door, only to find that Potbury is gone, and the mirror scraped free of paint with a razor. They find a bottle in Potbury&#x27;s black bag which, upon being opened, causes Cynthia to awaken.

To solve the mystery once and for all, Ted and Cynthia take Hoag to their office and subject him to questioning under drugs. After a few questions, Hoag wakes up with a strong, dominant personality, completely different from the nervous, weak man they have heretofore worked with. He declares the session over, and tells them to meet him later in a park just outside the city. He gives them a list of things to bring, and leaves them in a state of some puzzlement.

Reaching the park, with the collection of fine foods and wines Hoag requested, Ted and Cynthia find him there. They picnic on the epicurean fare, and Hoag tells them he is an art critic. The art in question is their entire world, created by an &quot;artist&quot; as a student project. Critics live as inhabitants in the world, not knowing they are critics, in order to judge experiences. One such experience is eating and drinking, as Hoag points out, since the simple act of gaining energy to live had not been thought of as an &quot;experience&quot; previously. Another is sex, but this is thought to be ridiculous until Hoag realizes that it is the basis for &quot;the tragedy of human love&quot; that he sees between Ted and Cynthia. Hoag&#x27;s artistic judgment is that, while there is much that is amateurish in the world, overall its creator has real promise.

The Sons of the Bird are responsible for all the things that Ted and Cynthia have seen, including the times they saw Hoag during the day. They only encountered the real Hoag in their home and office. The sons were an early artistic mistake, hurriedly &quot;painted over&quot; rather than eliminated in the rush to complete the work, but still holding power. Now they are to be expunged completely. Hoag was recruited to report on them; the substance under his fingernails is their ichor, placed there to make them fearful.

Hoag tells the couple to leave the city, not stopping to talk to anyone on the way. He places one last grape in his mouth, and then becomes still. Leaving his inert body, the two drive through town, but finally yield to the urge to tell someone about Hoag&#x27;s body. When they roll down their car windows, however, all that is outside their automobile is a pulsing, luminous mist, though all the other windows show an apparently normal scene. They drive on in a state of shock.

In the epilogue, the Randalls now live in an unnamed remote rural area by the sea. They do everything together, have no mirrors in their home, and every night before going to sleep &quot;he handcuffs one of his wrists to one of hers&quot;.

==Reception==
Alexei and Cory Panshin described the novella as &quot;the last and strangest of the stories that Robert Heinlein contributed to the Golden Age before he ceased to write during World War II.&quot; &quot;Galaxy&quot;&#x27;s Floyd C. Gale in 1961 found it &quot;a brand of fantasy-mystery [that] would shock-present-day Heinlein lovers&quot;, while the SF Site&#x27;s Dale Darlage stated in 2011 that it seemed more like the work of Philip K. Dick than of Heinlein, and that although not all the aspects of the story have aged well, &quot;the underlying story overcomes all of that window dressing.&quot;

In 1996, Jonathan Lethem published the short story &quot;The Insipid Profession of Jonathan Hornebom (&quot;Hommage à Heinlein&quot;)&quot;, which the SF Site&#x27;s Neil Walsh called &quot;an overt parody&quot; of Heinlein&#x27;s original, while conceding that it is &quot;parody-tribute-homage (...) rather than outright mockery&quot;.

The cultural theorist Slavoj Žižek has had occasion to ruminate on this story. He asserted that the luminous mist which confronts Ted and Cynthia as they drive out of town could only represent the Lacanian Real, &quot;the pulsing of the presymbolic substance in its abhorrent vitality.&quot;

<text>Beta Hydri (β Hyi, β Hydri) is a star in the southern circumpolar constellation of Hydrus. (Note that Hydrus is not the same as Hydra.) With an apparent visual magnitude of 2.8, this is the brightest star in the constellation. Based upon parallax measurements the distance to this star is about .

This star has about 113% of the mass of the Sun and 184% of the Sun&#x27;s radius, with more than three times the Sun&#x27;s luminosity. The spectrum of this star matches a stellar classification of G2 IV, with the luminosity class of &#x27;IV&#x27; indicating this is a subgiant star. As such, it is a slightly more evolved star than the Sun, with the supply of hydrogen at its core becoming exhausted. It is one of the oldest stars in the solar neighborhood. This star bears some resemblance to what the Sun might look like in the far distant future, making it an object of interest to astronomers.

At a distance of 13°, it is the closest easily visible star to the south celestial pole, and around 150 BC it was within two degrees of it, which made it the southern pole star.

==Search for planets==

In 2002, Endl et al. inferred the possible presence of an unseen companion orbiting Beta Hydri as hinted by a radial velocity linear trend with a periodicity exceeding 20 years. A substellar object such as a planet with a minimum mass of 4 Jupiter masses and orbital separation of roughly 8 AU could explain the observed trend. If confirmed, it would be a true Jupiter-analogue, though 4 times more massive. So far no planetary/substellar object has been certainly detected.

These results were not confirmed in CES and HARPS measurements published in 2012. Instead, the long-term radial velocity variations may be caused by the star&#x27;s magnetic cycle. Similarly, a 2023 study detected long-period radial velocity variations that were attributed to stellar activity.

<text>Argentina competed at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece, from 13 to 29 August 2004. This was the nation&#x27;s twenty-first appearance at the Olympic Games, except for three different editions. Argentina did not attend the 1904 Summer Olympics in St. Louis, the 1912 Summer Olympics in Stockholm, and the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow, because of its support for the United States-led boycott. The sailor Carlos Espínola was the nation&#x27;s flag bearer at the opening ceremony. 152 competitors, 106 men and 46 women, took part in 86 events in 22 sports.

The total medal count of six, marked the best performance by Argentina since the 1948 Summer Olympics, earning their first gold medals since the 1952 Summer Olympics and their best position in the medal table up to that point, at 35th place overall.

<text>The M270 Multiple Launch Rocket System (M270 MLRS) is an American armored self-propelled multiple launch rocket system.

The U.S. Army variant of the M270 is based on the chassis of the Bradley Fighting Vehicle. The first M270s were delivered in 1983, and were adopted by several NATO and non-NATO militaries. The platform first saw service with the United States in the 1991 Gulf War. It has received multiple improvements since its inception, including the ability to fire guided missiles. M270s provided by the United Kingdom have seen use in the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

== Description ==
=== Background ===
In the early 1970s, the Soviet Union had a clear advantage over U.S. and NATO forces in terms of rocket artillery. Soviet doctrine dictated large-scale bombardment of a target area with large numbers of truck-mounted multiple rocket launchers (MRLs), such as the BM-21 &quot;Grad&quot;. By contrast, U.S. artillerists favored conventional large-caliber artillery for its relative accuracy and logistical efficiency. As a result, U.S. rocket artillery was limited to the remaining stock of World War II-era systems.

This mindset began to change following the 1973 Yom Kippur War, which saw heavy casualties, especially from rear-area weapons like surface-to-air missiles (SAMs). Israel effectively employed rocket artillery against these targets. The United States predicted that this requirement would persist in the event of a war in Europe. Thus, the need had arisen for a system that could engage enemy air defenses and provide counter-battery fire, freeing large-caliber artillery units to provide call-for-fire artillery support for ground forces.


The MLRS was initially conceived as the General Support Rocket System (GSRS). In December 1975, the U.S. Army Missile Command issued a request for proposal to industry to assist in determining the best technical approach for the GSRS. In March 1976, the Army awarded contracts to Boeing, Emerson Electric, Martin Marietta, Northrop and Vought to explore the concept definition of the GSRS. In September 1977, Boeing Aerospace and Vought were awarded contracts to develop prototypes of the GSRS.

In 1978, the U.S. Army Aviation and Missile Command made changes to the program so that the GSRS could be manufactured in Europe. This was to allow European nations, who had been independently pursuing their own MLRS programs, to buy in to the program. In July 1979, the United States, West Germany, France and the United Kingdom signed a memorandum of understanding for joint development and production of GSRS. In November 1979, GSRS was accordingly redesignated the multiple launch rocket system. Both competitors delivered three MLRS prototypes to the Army. 

The Army evaluated the MLRS prototypes from December 1979 – February 1980. In May 1980, the Army selected the Vought system. In early 1982, Vought began low-rate initial production. In August 1982, the first production models were delivered. In early 1983, the first units were delivered to the 1st Infantry Division. In March 1983, the first operational M270 battery was formed. In September 1983, the first unit was sent to West Germany.

European nations produced 287 MLRS systems, with the first being delivered in 1989. Some 1,300 M270 systems have been manufactured in the United States and in Western Europe to date, along with more than 700,000 rockets of all kinds, including over 70,000 GMLRS guided munitions as of March 2024.

=== Overview ===
The M270 MLRS weapons system is collectively known as the M270 MLRS Self-Propelled Loader/Launcher (SPLL). The SPLL is composed of two primary subsystems; the M269 Launcher-Loader Module (LLM) houses the electronic fire-control system and sits atop the M993 Carrier Vehicle.
The M993 is the designation of the M987 carrier when it is used in the MLRS. The M987/M993 is a lengthened derivative of the Bradley Fighting Vehicle chassis, in which the ground contact length is increased from to . Originally called the Fighting Vehicle System, the M987 chassis was designed to serve as the basis for many other vehicles. These included the XM1070 Electronic Fighting Vehicle, the M4 Command and Control Vehicle, the Armored Treatment and Transport Vehicle and the Forward Area Armored Logistics System, the latter encompassing three vehicles, including the XM1007 AFARV rearm vehicle.

The original GSRS plan called for 210 mm diameter rockets. After European allies became involved with the project, these were replaced with 227 mm rockets in order to accommodate the AT2 mine.

Cold War doctrine for the M270 called for the vehicles to spread out individually and hide until needed, then move to a firing position and launch their rockets, immediately move away to a reloading point, then move to a completely new hiding position near a different firing point. These shoot-and-scoot tactics were planned to avoid susceptibility to Soviet counter-battery fire. One M270 firing 12 M26 rockets would drop 7,728 bomblets, and one MLRS battery of nine launchers firing 108 rockets had the equivalent firepower of 33 battalions of cannon artillery.

The system can fire rockets or MGM-140 ATACMS missiles, which are contained in interchangeable pods. Each pod contains six standard rockets or one guided ATACMS missile; the two types cannot be mixed. The LLM can hold two pods at a time, which are handloaded using an integrated winch system. All twelve rockets or two ATACMS missiles can be fired in under a minute. One launcher firing twelve rockets can completely blanket one square kilometre with cluster munitions; a typical MLRS cluster salvo would involve three M270 vehicles firing together. With each rocket containing 644 M77 submunitions, the entire salvo would drop 23,184 submunitions in the target area. However, at a two percent dud rate, that would leave approximately 400 undetonated bombs scattered over the area, which could endanger friendly troops and civilians.

Production of the M270 ended in 2003, when a last batch was delivered to the Egyptian Army. In 2003, the U.S. Army began low-rate production of the M142 HIMARS. The HIMARS fires all of the munitions of the MLRS, and is based on the chassis of the Family of Medium Tactical Vehicles. As of 2012, BAE Systems still had the capability to restart production of the MLRS.

In 2006, MLRS was upgraded to fire guided rounds. Phase I testing of a guided unitary round (XM31) was completed on an accelerated schedule in March 2006. Due to an Urgent Need Statement, the guided unitary round was quickly fielded and used in action in Iraq. Lockheed Martin also received a contract to convert existing M30 Dual-Purpose Improved Conventional Munition (DPICM) GMLRS rockets to the XM31 unitary variant.

The M31 GMLRS Unitary rocket transformed the M270 into a point target artillery system for the first time. Due to Global Positioning System (GPS) guidance and a single high-explosive warhead, the M31 could hit targets accurately with less chance of collateral damage while needing fewer rockets to be fired, reducing logistical requirements. The unitary warhead also made the MLRS able to be used in urban environments. The M31 had a dual-mode fuse with point detonation and delay options to defeat soft targets and lightly fortified bunkers respectively, with the upgraded M31A1 equipped with a multi-mode fuse adding a proximity airburst mode for use against personnel in the open; proximity mode can be set for Height of Burst (HOB). The GMLRS has a minimum engagement range of and can hit a target out to , impacting at a speed of Mach 2.5. In 2009 Lockheed Martin announced that a GMLRS had been successfully test fired out to .

In April 2011, the first modernized MLRS II and M31 GMLRS rocket were handed over to the German Army&#x27;s Artillery School in Idar Oberstein. The German Army operates the M31 rocket up to a range of . A German developmental artillery system, called the Artillery Gun Module, has used the MLRS chassis on its developmental vehicles.

In 2012, a contract was issued to improve the armor of the M270s and improve the fire control to the standards of the M142 HIMARS. In June 2015, the M270A1 conducted tests of firing rockets after upgrades from the Improved Armored Cab project, which provides the vehicle with an enhanced armored cab and windows.

In early March 2021, Lockheed announced they had successfully fired an extended-range version of the GMLRS out to , part of an effort to increase the rocket&#x27;s range to . Later in March the ER GMLRS was fired out to . In September 2023, Lockheed announced an ER GMLRS test achieved its maximum range of . The U.S. Army approved the ER GMLRS for production in May 2024.

== Service history ==
When first deployed with the U.S. Army, the MLRS was used in a composite battalion consisting of two batteries of traditional artillery (howitzers) and one battery of MLRS SPLLs (self-propelled loader/launchers). The first operational Battery was C Battery, 3rd Battalion, 6th Field Artillery, 1st Infantry Division (Ft. Riley, Kansas) in 1982. The first operational organic or &quot;all MLRS&quot; unit was 6th Battalion, 27th Field Artillery.

Originally, a battery consisted of three platoons with three launchers each for nine launchers per battery; by 1987, 25 MLRS batteries were in service. In the 1990s, a battery was reduced to six launchers.

The 6th Battalion, 27th Field Artillery was reactivated as the Army&#x27;s first MLRS battalion in October 1984, and became known as the &quot;Rocket Busters&quot;. In March 1990, the unit deployed to White Sands Missile Range, New Mexico to conduct the Initial Operational Test and Evaluation of the Army Tactical Missile System. The success of the test provided the Army with a highly accurate, long range fire support asset.
=== Gulf War ===
The first combat use of the MLRS occurred in the Gulf War. The U.S. deployed over 230 MLRS during Operation Desert Storm, and the UK an additional 16.

In September 1990, the 6th Battalion, 27th Field Artillery deployed to Saudi Arabia in support of Operation Desert Shield. Assigned to the XVIII Airborne Corps Artillery, the unit played a critical role in the early defense of Saudi Arabia. As Desert Shield turned into Desert Storm, the Battalion was the first U.S. Field Artillery unit to fire into Iraq. Over the course of the war, the 6th Battalion, 27th Field Artillery provided timely and accurate rocket and missile fires for both U.S. corps in the theater, the 82nd Airborne Division, the 6th French Light Armored Division, the 1st Armored, 1st Infantry Division, the 101st Airborne Division, and the 24th Infantry Division (Mechanized).

A Battery 92nd Field Artillery (MLRS) was deployed to the Gulf War in 1990 from Ft. Hood Texas. 3/27th FA (MLRS) out of Fort Bragg deployed in support of Operation Desert Shield in August 1990. A/21st Field Artillery (MLRS) – 1st Cavalry Division Artillery deployed in support of Operation Desert Shield in September 1990. In December 1990, A-40th Field Artillery (MLRS) – 3rd Armored Division Artillery (Hanau), 1/27th FA (MLRS) part of the 41st Field Artillery Brigade (Babenhausen) and 4/27th FA (MLRS) (Wertheim) deployed in support of Operation Desert Shield from their bases in Germany and 1/158th Field Artillery from the Oklahoma Army National Guard deployed in January 1991.

MLRS launchers were deployed during Operation Desert Storm. Its first use was on 18 January 1991, when Battery A of the 6th Battalion, 27th Field Artillery fired eight ATACMS missiles at Iraqi SAM sites. In one engagement, three MLRS batteries fired 287 rockets at 24 separate targets in less than five minutes, an amount that would have taken a cannon battalion over an hour to fire. In early February 1991, 4-27 FA launched the biggest MLRS night fire mission in history, firing 312 rockets in a single mission. When ground operations began on 24 February 1991, 414 rockets were fired as the U.S. VII Corps advanced. Out of the 57,000 artillery rounds fired by the end of the war, 6,000 were MLRS rockets plus 32 ATACMS.

=== Middle East ===
The MLRS has since been used in numerous military engagements, including the 2003 invasion of Iraq. In March 2007, the British Ministry of Defence decided to send a troop of MLRS to support ongoing operations in Afghanistan&#x27;s southern province of Helmand, using newly developed guided munitions.

In September 2005, the GMLRS was first used in Iraq, when two rockets were fired in Tal Afar over and hit insurgent strongholds, killing 48 Iraqi fighters.

During the 2023 Israel–Hamas war, Israel used the M270 for the first time since 2006, to fire on Hamas targets in the Gaza Strip.

=== Mali===
The French army deployed them for the first time with occasional use between February and the end of April 2016 in Mali during Operation Barkhane with three M270s.

=== Ukraine ===

During the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, the United States considered sending the MLRS as part of military aid to Ukraine. Concerns were raised that this system could be used to hit targets inside Russia. US President Joe Biden initially declined to send it to Ukraine, but on May 31 he announced that the M142 HIMARS, another vehicle capable of firing GMLRS rockets, would be supplied.

On 7 June 2022, British defence secretary Ben Wallace announced that the UK would send three (later increased to six) MLRS to aid Ukrainian forces. On 15 June, Germany announced it would send three of its MARS vehicles from German Army stocks.
Ukraine announced they had received the first M270s on 15 July. The German defence secretary Christine Lambrecht announced the arrival of the vehicles they contributed on 26 July 2022, and on 15 September Lambrecht announced that Germany would transfer two more.

During the Russo-Ukrainian War, Russian forces have relied on electronic warfare to jam GPS signals. The inertial navigation system is immune to jamming, but less accurate than when paired with GPS coordinates and can miss the target.

== Variants ==


* M270 is the original version, which carries a weapon load of 12 rockets in two six-pack pods. This armored, tracked mobile launcher uses a stretched Bradley chassis and has a high cross-country capability.
* M270A1 was the result of a 2005 upgrade program for the U.S. Army, and later on for several other states. The launcher appears identical to M270, but incorporates the Improved Fire Control System (IFCS) and an improved launcher mechanical system (ILMS). This allows for significantly faster launch procedures and the firing of GMLRS rockets with GPS-aided guidance. The US Army updated 225 M270 to this standard. When Bahrain ordered an upgrade of nine to &quot;A1 minimum configuration&quot; in 2022, it was stated to include CFCS.
* M270B1 British Army variant of the M270A1, which includes an enhanced armor package to give the crew better protection against IED attacks. Following an agreement struck with the United States Department of Defense, the British Army will be embarking on a five-year programme to update the M270B1 to the M270A2 standard. They are developing some UK-specific systems, including Composite Rubber Tracks (CRT), and a vehicle camera and radar system. Upgrade of the first tranche of launchers started in March 2022, with the fleet going through production over a four-year period. A new Fire Control System will be developed collaboratively with the US, the UK, Italy, and Finland.
* M270C1 was an upgrade proposal from Lockheed Martin involving the M142&#x27;s Universal Fire Control System (UFCS) instead of IFCS.
* M270D1 Finnish Army variant of the M270A1 that uses the M142&#x27;s Universal Fire Control System (UFCS).
* MARS II / LRU / MLRS-I is a European variant of the M270A1 involving Germany, France, and Italy. The launchers are equipped with the European Fire Control System (EFCS) designed by Airbus Defence and Space. The EFCS disables the firing of submunitions-carrying rockets to ensure full compliance with the Convention on Cluster Munitions.
* M270A2 is a 2019 upgrade program to the US Army variant, which includes the new Common Fire Control System (CFCS) to allow the use of the Precision Strike Missile (PrSM). The update also includes a new 600 hp engine, upgraded and rebuilt transmission, and improved cabin armor protection. The U.S. Army will eventually upgrade its entire fleet of 225 M270A1 and an additional 160 decommissioned M270A0 launchers.

== Rockets and missiles ==

The M270 system can fire MLRS Family of Munitions (MFOM) rockets and artillery missiles, which are manufactured and used by a number of platforms and countries. These include:

=== MLRS ===
M26 and M28 rocket production began in 1980. Until 2005 they were the only rockets available for the M270 system. When production of the M26 series ceased in 2001, a total of 506,718 rockets had been produced. Each rocket pod contains 6 identical rockets. The M26 rocket and its derivatives were removed from the US Army&#x27;s active inventory in June 2009, as they did not satisfy a July 2008 Department of Defense policy directive, issued under President George W. Bush, that US cluster munitions that leave more than 1% of submunitions as unexploded ordnance must be destroyed by the end of 2018. (The United States is not a party to the Convention on Cluster Munitions, which prohibits them). The last use of the M26 rocket prior to its use with the GLSDB occurred during Operation Iraqi Freedom in 2003.

* M26 rockets carrying 644 DPICM M77 submunitions. Range: . The submunitions that were used in these rockets prior to their use with the GLSDB covered an area of 0.23 km. Dubbed &quot;Steel Rain&quot; by Iraqi soldiers, M26 rockets were used extensively during Desert Storm and Operation Iraqi Freedom. Initially fielded in 1983, the rockets have a shelf life of 25 years. The US started destroying its M26 stocks in 2007, when the US Army requested $109 million for the destruction of 98,904 M26 MLRS rockets from fiscal year 2007 to fiscal year 2012. M26 rockets were removed from the US Army&#x27;s active inventory in June 2009 and the remaining rockets were being destroyed as of 2009, but the US requirement to destroy them was removed in 2017. The UK and the Netherlands destroyed their stock of 60,000 M26 rockets by 2013, Italy destroyed its 3,894 rockets by 31 October 2015, Germany its 26,000 by 25 November 2015, and France its 22,000 by 2017.
* M26A1 ER rockets carrying 518 M85 submunitions. Range: . The M85 submunitions are identical to the M77 submunitions, except for the fuze. The M85 use the M235 mechanical/electronic self-destruct fuze to reduce hazardous duds and the potential for fratricide or collateral damage.
* M26A2 ER rockets carrying 518 M77 submunitions. Interim solution until the M26A1 ER entered service. Range: . The M26A2 ER rockets have been retired from US Army service and the remaining rockets are being destroyed.
* M28 practice rockets. A M26 variant with three ballast containers and three smoke marking containers in place of the submunition payload. Production ceased in favor of the M28A1.
* M28A1 Reduced Range Practice Rocket (RRPR) with blunt nose. Range reduced to . Production ceased in favor of the M28A2.
* M28A2 Low Cost Reduced Range Practice Rocket (LCRRPR) with blunt nose. Range reduced to .
* AT2 German M26 variant carrying 28 AT2 anti-tank mines. Range: 

=== GMLRS ===
Guided multiple launch rocket system (GMLRS) rockets have a GPS-aided inertial navigation system and extended range. Flight control is accomplished by four forward-mounted canards driven by electromechanical actuators. GMLRS rockets were introduced in 2005 and can be fired from the M270A1 and M270A2, the European M270A1 variants (British Army M270B1, German Army MARS II, French Army Lance Roquette Unitaire (LRU), Italian Army MLRS Improved (MLRS-I), Finnish Army M270D1), and the lighter M142 HIMARS launchers.

M30 rockets have an area-effects warhead, while M31 rockets have a unitary warhead, but the rockets are otherwise identical. By December 2021, 50,000 GMLRS rockets had been produced, with yearly production then exceeding 9,000 rockets. Each rocket pod contains 6 identical rockets. The cost of an M31 missile is estimated at $500,000, though this may be the &quot;export price&quot;, always higher than the amount charged to the U.S. Army. According to the U.S. Army&#x27;s budget, it will pay about $168,000 for each GMLRS in 2023.

Both Lockheed Martin and the U.S. Army report that the GMLRS has a maximum range of 70+ km (43+ mi). According to a U.S. Department of Defense document the maximum demonstrated performance of a GMLRS is , a figure also reported elsewhere. Another source reports a maximum range of about . In 2009 Lockheed Martin announced that a GMLRS had been successfully test fired .

During the Russo-Ukrainian War, Russian forces have relied on electronic warfare to jam GPS signals. The inertial navigation system is immune to jamming, but less accurate than when paired with GPS coordinates and can miss the target. Ukraine attempted to mitigate the jamming by changes to the software and attacking Russian jamming systems by artillery.

* M30 rockets carrying 404 DPICM M101 submunitions. Range: . 3,936 produced between 2004 and 2009. Production ceased in favor of the M30A1. The remaining US Army M30 rockets have been converted to the M31 (unitary warhead) variant.
* M30A1 rockets with Alternative Warhead (AW). Range: . The M30&#x27;s submunitions are replaced with about 182,000 pre-formed tungsten fragments, to give area effects, but without leaving unexploded submunitions. The system uses a proximity sensor fuze mode with a 10 meter height of burst. Entered production in 2015.
* M30A2 rockets with Alternative Warhead (AW). Range: . Improved M30A1 with Insensitive Munition Propulsion System (IMPS). The only M30 variant in production since 2019.
* M31 rockets with high-explosive unitary warhead. Range: . Entered production in 2005. The warhead is produced by General Dynamics and contains of PBX-109 high explosive in a steel blast-fragmentation case.
* M31A1 rockets with high-explosive unitary warhead. Range: . Improved M31 with new multi-mode fuze that added airburst to the M31&#x27;s fuze point detonation and delay.
* M31A2 rockets with high-explosive unitary warhead. Range: . Improved M31A1 with Insensitive Munition Propulsion System (IMPS). The only M31 variant in production since 2019.
* M32 SMArt German variant produced by Diehl Defence carrying 4 SMArt anti-tank submunitions and new flight software. Developed for MARS II, but has not been ordered as of 2019, so is not in service.
* ER GMLRS rockets with extended range of up to . Uses a slightly bigger rocket motor, a newly designed hull, and tail-driven guidance, while still being six per pod. It will come in unitary and AW variants. The first successful test flight was in March 2021. In early 2021, Lockheed Martin anticipated putting it into its production line in the fiscal year 2023 contract award and was planning to produce the new rockets at its Camden facility. In 2022 Finland became the first foreign customer to order it.

=== GLSDB ===

The Ground Launched Small Diameter Bomb is a weapon made by Boeing and the Saab Group, who modified Boeing&#x27;s GBU-39 Small Diameter Bomb (SDB) with the addition of a rocket motor. It has a range of up to .

=== ATACMS ===
The Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) is a series of 610 mm surface-to-surface missile (SSM) with a range of up to . Each rocket pod contains one ATACMS missile. As of 2022 only the M48, M57, and M57E1 remain in the US military&#x27;s active inventory.

* M39 (ATACMS BLOCK I) missile with inertial guidance. The missile carries 950 M74 Anti-personnel and Anti‑materiel (APAM) bomblets. Range: . 1,650 M39 were produced between 1990 and 1997, when production ceased in favor of the M39A1. During Desert Storm 32 M39 were fired at Iraqi targets and during Operation Iraqi Freedom a further 379 M39 were fired. The remaining M39 missiles are being updated since 2017 to M57E1 missiles. The M39 is the only ATACMS variant which can be fired by all M270 and M142 variants.
* M39A1 (ATACMS BLOCK IA) missile with GPS-aided guidance. The missile carries 300 M74 Anti-personnel and Anti‑materiel (APAM) bomblets. Range: . 610 M39A1 were produced between 1997 and 2003. During Operation Iraqi Freedom 74 M39A1 were fired at Iraqi targets. The remaining M39A1 missiles are being updated since 2017 to M57E1 missiles. The M39A1 and all subsequently introduced ATACMS missiles can only be used with the M270A1 (or variants thereof) and the M142.
* M48 (ATACMS Quick Reaction Unitary (QRU) missile with GPS-aided guidance. It carries the WDU-18/B penetrating high explosive blast fragmentation warhead of the US Navy&#x27;s Harpoon anti-ship missile, which was packaged into the newly designed WAU-23/B warhead section. Range: . 176 M48 were produced between 2001 and 2004, when production ceased in favor of the M57. During Operation Iraqi Freedom 16 M48 were fired at Iraqi targets a further 42 M48 were fired during Operation Enduring Freedom. The remaining M48 missiles remain in the US Army and US Marine Corps&#x27; arsenal.
* M57 (ATACMS TACMS 2000) missile with GPS-aided guidance. The missile carries the same WAU-23/B warhead section as the M48. Range: . 513 M57 were produced between 2004 and 2013.
* M57E1 (ATACMS Modification (MOD) missile with GPS-aided guidance. The M57E1 is the designation for upgraded M39 and M39A1 with re-grained motor, updated navigation and guidance software and hardware, and a WAU-23/B warhead section instead of the M74 APAM bomblets. The M57E1 ATACMS MOD also includes a proximity sensor for airburst detonation. Production commenced in 2017 with an initial order for 220 upgraded M57E1. The program is slated to end in 2024 with the introduction of the Precision Strike Missile (PrSM), which will replace the ATACMS missiles in the US arsenal.

=== PrSM ===

The Precision Strike Missile (PrSM) is a new series of GPS-guided missiles, which will begin to replace ATACMS missiles from 2024. PrSM carries a newly designed area-effects warhead and has a range of . PrSM missiles can be launched from the M270A2 and the M142, with rockets pods containing 2 missiles. As of 2022 the PrSM is in low rate initial production with 110 missiles being delivered to the US military over the year. PrSM will enter operational service in 2023.

=== Reverse engineering ===
In the Turkish SAGE-227 project A/B/C/D medium-range composite-fuel artillery rocket and SAGE-227 F experimental guided rocket were developed from reverse engineering HIMARS missiles due to trust issues in 2019.

* PARS SAGE-227 F (Turkey): Experimental Guided MLRS (GMLRS) developed by TUBITAK-SAGE to replace the M26 rockets.

=== Israeli rockets ===
Israel developed its own rockets to be used in the &quot;Menatetz&quot;, an upgraded version of the M270 MLRS. 

* Trajectory Corrected Rocket (TCS/RAMAM): In-flight trajectory corrected for enhanced accuracy.
* Ra&#x27;am Eithan (&quot;Strong Thunder&quot;): an improved version of the TCS/RAMAM (in-flight trajectory corrected for enhanced accuracy) with significantly decreased percentage of duds.

=== British missiles ===
As part of the circa £2bn Land Deep Fires Programme (LDFP), the British Army intends a large scale modernization effort of its GMLRS capability involving both a increase in the number of launchers and an expansion in the variety of effectors available. The British Army launchers will be upgraded to the M270A2 standard and additional launchers will be purchased and upgraded from stockpiles likely from the US for a total of 76 launchers and 9 recovery vehicles. M270A2 will include a number of British-specific upgrades such as new composite rubber tracks, radar and video sensors, as well as the new jointly developed fire control system from the UK, US, Italy, and Finland.

Alongside the procurement of GMLRS-ER and the possible procurement of the PrSM, the UK is also developing two additional effectors under its &#x27;one launcher, many payloads&#x27; concept:

* Dispensing-Rocket Payload: developed under &#x27;Technical Demonstrator Program 5&#x27;, a UK designed dispensing payload that replaces the standard warheads for the GMLRS-ER and PrSM. It is capable of deploying small UAVs such as Lockheed Martin UK&#x27;s OUTRIDER for ISTAR, battle damage assessment, and electronic warfare; or a number of Thales UK&#x27;s free-fall lightweight multirole missile (FFLMM) for anti-armour capability.
* Land Precision Strike (LPS): derived from MBDA UK&#x27;s CAMM and Brimstone products; designed to complement the GMLRS-ER by enabling the engagement of high value, time sensitive, and mobile targets out to 80–150 km (47.7-93.2 mi). MBDA graphics show that LPS could be used on a number of platforms including the M270 with an additional vehicle sporting the two way data link pod, Boxer (as a mission module), or MBDA&#x27;s iLauncher.

=== French missiles ===

Developed by MBDA France and Safran as a candidate for the (FLP-T) or Land Long Range Fires procurement program, the Thundart guided artillery rocket is designed to have a range of 150 km and the ability to be fired from the French version of the M270, the (LRU).

=== Alternative Warhead Program ===
In April 2012, Lockheed Martin received a $79.4 million contract to develop a GMLRS incorporating an Alliant Techsystems-designed alternative warhead to replace DPICM cluster warheads. The AW version is designed as a drop-in replacement with little modification needed to existing rockets. An Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) program was to last 36 months, with the alternative warhead GMLRS expected to enter service in late 2016. The AW warhead is a large airburst fragmentation warhead that explodes over a target area to disperse penetrating projectiles. Considerable damage is caused to a large area while leaving behind only solid metal penetrators and inert rocket fragments from a warhead containing approximately 182,000 preformed tungsten fragments. The unitary GMLRS also has an airburst option, but while it produces a large blast and pieces of shrapnel, the AW round&#x27;s small pellets cover a larger area.

In May 2013, Lockheed and ATK test fired a GMLRS rocket with a new cluster munition warhead developed under the Alternative Warhead Program (AWP), aimed at producing a drop-in replacement for DPICM bomblets in M30 guided rockets. It was fired by an M142 HIMARS and traveled before detonating. The AWP warhead will have equal or greater effect against materiel and personnel targets, while leaving no unexploded ordnance behind.

In October 2013, Lockheed conducted the third and final engineering development test flight of the GMLRS alternative warhead. Three rockets were fired from away and destroyed their ground targets. The Alternative Warhead Program then moved to production qualification testing. The fifth and final Production Qualification Test (PQT) for the AW GMLRS was conducted in April 2014, firing four rockets from a HIMARS at targets away.

In July 2014, Lockheed successfully completed all Developmental Test/Operational Test (DT/OT) flight tests for the AW GMLRS. They were the first tests conducted with soldiers operating the fire control system, firing rockets at mid and long-range from a HIMARS. The Initial Operational Test and Evaluation (IOT&amp;E) exercise was to be conducted in fall 2014.

In September 2015, Lockheed received a contract for Lot 10 production of the GMLRS unitary rocket, which includes the first order for AW production.

<doc id="932990" wikidata="Q44290" url="?curid=932990" title="Mihai Antonescu">
<text>Mihai Antonescu (18 November 1904 – 1 June 1946) was a Romanian politician who served as Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister during World War II, executed in 1946 as a war criminal.

==Early career==
Born in Nucet, Dâmbovița County, he went to school in Pitești, and then at the Saint Sava National College in Bucharest. From 1922 to 1926 he attended the Faculty of Law of the University of Bucharest. Antonescu made his living as an attorney before becoming the Minister of Foreign Affairs to Prime Minister Ion Antonescu (to whom he was not closely related) in 1940. Antonescu was initially not an extremist or supporter of the Iron Guard, whose leaders held prominent positions in Ion Antonescu&#x27;s government in 1940–1941 (&quot;see National Legionary State&quot;); in the 1930s, he was a member of the National Liberal Party-Brătianu.

As a minister, he drifted to the far right, and established contacts with the German Nazi Party. Antonescu subsequently became one of Ion Antonescu&#x27;s most trusted advisors, especially when the Iron Guard&#x27;s leader, Horia Sima (who was also deputy prime minister), became increasingly uncooperative. He was effective in censoring governmental critics and enforcing blatant Anti-Semitism in the media.

When the Iron Guard was suppressed and removed from power in January 1941 as a result of the Legionnaires&#x27; Rebellion and Bucharest Pogrom, Mihai Antonescu was promoted to Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs, making him the second most powerful man in the country (&quot;see Romania during World War II&quot;).

==Prominence==
Throughout 1941, especially after the Invasion of the Soviet Union, Ion Antonescu primarily focused on Romania&#x27;s military affairs, leaving Mihai Antonescu in almost full control of the country&#x27;s domestic matters. Although initially uncomfortable with Romania&#x27;s close alliance with Germany, Antonescu strengthened the nation&#x27;s ties with Adolf Hitler&#x27;s regime after a string of early Axis victories against the Soviets. Antonescu primarily attempted to gain Germany&#x27;s favor by persecuting Romania&#x27;s Jews. Essentially running the interior ministry, he drafted a series of laws that resulted in thousands of Romania&#x27;s Jews being forced out of their jobs and positions, while at the same time being denied access to countless other careers. More such laws resulted in the country&#x27;s Jews having their property seized.

Throughout 1941, Antonescu would approve the pogrom against the Jews of Iași, stop the emigration of Jews from Romania, and remove the Romanian government&#x27;s protection of Romanian Jews outside the country, thus leaving them in German-occupied areas at the mercy of the Nazis. He also approved the slaughter of Jews in Bessarabia and Bukovina, and the deportation of the survivors to concentration camps in Transnistria. In November 1941, he was awarded the Order of the Star of Romania, Grand Cross class.

==Late in the war and execution==
As 1942 came to a close, Ion Antonescu became alarmed at the deterioration of the Axis war effort and started looking for ways to withdraw Romania from the war. He attempted to persuade Hitler to make peace with the Western Allies and focus the full power of the Axis forces on the Soviet Union. When the Soviets won the Battle of Stalingrad on 2 February 1943, Antonescu came to the conclusion that the war was lost for the Axis, proceeding to destroy files and documents that revealed his active persecution of Romania&#x27;s Jews. With Ion Antonescu&#x27;s approval, he came to advocate the withdrawal from conflict of all minor allies of the Nazis – Romania, Hungary, Italy, and Finland.

Antonescu believed Benito Mussolini was powerful enough to stand up to Hitler, and that Italy could successfully negotiate an armistice with the Western Allies. Under Antonescu&#x27;s plan, the four states and other European nations would turn against Hitler and join the Allies against Germany. In his capacity as foreign minister, Antonescu strengthened Romania&#x27;s ties with Italy and paid a visit to Mussolini in June 1943, at which time he discovered that Mussolini agreed with certain aspects of his plan but was less than enthusiastic in regard to actually implementing it. Antonescu subsequently increased his efforts to improve Romania&#x27;s relations with the United States and Great Britain. As such, he stopped the deportations of Romania&#x27;s Jews, allowed Jewish emigration to non-Axis nations, and repatriated those who had survived Transnistria.

On 23 August 1944, as Soviet forces drew closer and closer to Romania, King Michael dismissed the government of Ion Antonescu, declared the nation&#x27;s surrender, and had Mihai Antonescu arrested. He was subsequently handed over to the new authorities, tried by a Communist Party-influenced Bucharest People&#x27;s Tribunal, and found guilty of war crimes. He was executed by a firing squad, together with Ion Antonescu, , and Gheorghe Alexianu, near the fort of Jilava. His resting place is unknown.

<doc id="933007" wikidata="Q1866958" url="?curid=933007" title="Lloyd Wright">
<text>Frank Lloyd Wright Jr. (March 31, 1890 – May 31, 1978), commonly known as Lloyd Wright, was an American architect, active primarily in Los Angeles and Southern California. He was a landscape architect for various Los Angeles projects (1922–1924), provided the shells for the Hollywood Bowl (1926–1928), and produced the Swedenborg Memorial Chapel (or Wayfarers Chapel) at Rancho Palos Verdes, California (1946–1971). His name is frequently confused with that of his more famous father, Frank Lloyd Wright.

==Early years==
Born on March 31, 1890, Frank Lloyd Wright Jr. was the eldest son of renowned architect Frank Lloyd Wright and Wright&#x27;s first wife, Catherine Lee &quot;Kitty&quot; Tobin Wright. He spent his early years at his father&#x27;s home and studio in Oak Park, Illinois. Wright briefly attended the University of Wisconsin in Madison for two years of coursework in agronomy and engineering before traveling extensively through Europe after his father moved to Italy in 1909.

In 1911, Wright joined the landscape firm Olmsted and Olmsted in Boston, Massachusetts, where he specialized in botany and horticulture. Wright would be later sent to San Diego, California to assist with the landscape design of the 1915 Panama–California Exposition with architects Bertram Goodhue, Carleton Winslow, and Irving Gill. The exposition&#x27;s principal buildings and gardens still remain in Balboa Park. Landscape design led him to work with Los Angeles architect William J. Dodd, and in San Diego with Irving Gill, the latter another master architect and mentor to his design career. In the mid-1910s, Wright formed a landscape partnership with Paul Thiene, a colleague from the Olmsted firm, before opening his own practice in 1916. Beginning in 1919, his father, working in Japan on the Imperial Hotel, delegated some of the responsibilities to him and architect Rudolf Schindler to supervise construction of the Hollyhock House, while Wright worked on the Imperial Hotel in Japan. The house was commissioned by the oil heiress and philanthropist Aline Barnsdall.

Wright began his independent career in 1920. In 1922, he was a production designer at Paramount Studios, responsible for the extensive castle and 12th-century village sets for the Douglas Fairbanks version of Robin Hood. In December 1922, Wright prepared plans for the Henry Bollman House in Hollywood that included a repeated pattern of concrete blocks, a precursor to his father&#x27;s more famous &quot;textile block&quot; houses in the Los Angeles area. From 1923 through 1926, the younger Wright was drawn into the realization of these four houses, and the ambitious attempt to evolve the &quot;textile block&quot; system into a patented construction technique. The first was the 1923 Millard House in Pasadena, California where Lloyd designed the grounds, and contributed an adjacent studio building in 1926. Lloyd served as construction manager for the other three: the Storer House (1923), the Samuel Freeman House (1923), and the Ennis House (1924). By all accounts Lloyd&#x27;s work was difficult as he shuttled back and forth between sites, communicating with his father via telegram, and receiving little constructive support from Taliesin.

==Independent work==
Wright designed and built a number of houses in the Hollywood and Los Feliz districts of Los Angeles in the mid- to late 1920s. Lloyd Wright&#x27;s first residential commission, the Taggart House was built for the mother of his second wife, Helen Taggart, a registered Los Angeles Historic-Cultural Monument located next to the city&#x27;s Griffith Park. Another significant project was the hillside house for the manager of film star Ramón Novarro, and then a renovation and enlargement when Novarro himself acquired the residence. He also designed and built his own home with a ground floor studio and second floor residence, using concrete blocks, in West Hollywood in the 1920s.
He also designed the second and third band shells at the Hollywood Bowl. The original 1926 shell, designed by the Allied Architects group, was considered unacceptable both visually and acoustically. Wright&#x27;s 1927 shell had a pyramidal shape and a design reminiscent of southwest Native American architecture. According to Charles Willard Moore, it was built from leftovers from the &quot;Robin Hood&quot; production. Its acoustics generally were regarded as the best of any shell in Bowl history. But its appearance was considered too avant-garde, or perhaps only ugly, and it was demolished at the end of the season. His 1928 wooden shell had the now-familiar concentric ring motif, covered a 120-degree arc, and was designed to be easily dismantled. Unfortunately it was neglected and ruined by water damage, making way for the 1929 Allied Architects shell, which stood until the end of the 2003 season.

In 1927, Wright built a residence for himself, made of two units – one for living and one for work. The 2,413 square feet (224.17 square meter) of living space has an upstairs residence with a living room, a fireplace and wooden floors. Interlocking blocks with a stylized Joshua tree design overlay some of the windows. The Great Depression stalled Wright&#x27;s firm as he was reaching his artistic and professional peak. As for many architects, remodellings, rather than total designs, were the scope of 1930s work. His post-war designs became more expressionistic and less aligned to previous modernist architectural themes. He also promoted the word Usonia.

The largest collection of Lloyd Wright buildings in the United States was built in phases (1946–1957) for the Institute of Mentalphysics, located on a large Mojave Desert site next to the town of Joshua Tree, to the east of Joshua Tree National Park.

==Later work==
His best-known project is the Wayfarers Chapel, also known as &quot;The Glass Church&quot;, an indoor/outdoor structure made almost entirely of glass and built in 1951 for the Swedenborgian church, overlooking the Pacific Ocean on the Palos Verdes Peninsula. The site planning and planting design express his talent and experience as a landscape architect. He had an embracing grove of Redwoods (Sequoia sempervirens) planted to achieve this. The Wayfarer&#x27;s Chapel is listed in the National Register of Historic Places.

 When the trees that surround the Chapel grow up, they will become the framework, become a part of the tree forms and branches that inevitably arise from the growing trees adjacent to it. I used the glass so that the natural growth, the sky, and sea beyond became the definition of their environment. This is done to give the congregation protection in services and at the same time to create the sense of outer as well as inner space. 

Among his last projects was the 1963 John P. Bowler house, known as the &quot;Bird of Paradise&quot; House, in Rancho Palos Verdes using blue fiberglass for projecting roof fins, and the master plan and building designs for a 1970 shopping center in Huntington Beach, at Warner and Springdale streets south of Long Beach.

==Personal life==
In 1922 Wright married the actress and artist Elaine Hyman (known as Kyra Markham). They divorced in 1925.

The following year, Wright married Helen Taggart, the daughter of a client (Her then seven-year-old son, Rupert Pole, would later marry Anaïs Nin). In 1929, Lloyd and Helen became the parents of architect Eric Lloyd Wright, who has consulted on the restoration of many of his father&#x27;s and grandfather&#x27;s works, as well as being independently creative. Lloyd Wright died in 1978 in Santa Monica, California. A comprehensive monograph on Lloyd Wright and his work, &quot;Lloyd Wright, the Architecture of Frank Lloyd Wright Jr.&quot;, has extensive vintage and contemporary photographic documentation of his projects.

<text>Böhlen () is a town in Saxony, Germany, south of Leipzig. Its main features are a small airport and a power plant. It is located in the newly built Neuseenland, the lakes created in former open-pit mining areas.

== History ==

The first documented mention of Böhlen dates to 1353, although the area has been settled since the 7th century. The name of the town is derived from the Slavic word &quot;bely&quot; (white, bright, shiny). The manor is first mentioned in 1548. The manor house, locally referred to as the castle, was built in the 16th century. First documentation regarding the old village church dates from 1540, although the building contains Romanesque parts. A plague epidemy during the Thirty Years&#x27; War was reportedly only survived by two families.

The character of the place was rural for a long time. In 1842 a station on the Leipzig–Hof railway was opened in Böhlen. A schoolhouse with five classrooms was built in 1879. Böhlen was part of Amt Pegau until 1856, then of &quot;Gerichtsamt&quot; (judicial district) Zwenkau until 1875 and from then on of &quot;Amtshauptmannschaft&quot; (district) Leipzig.

Only from the 1920s on the village developed into an industrial location, mainly due to the lignite found in the area. In 1924 one of the largest lignite mines in the world of its time was opened west of Böhlen. It was equipped with a conveyor bridge of 200 m length and 50 m height.

Towards the end of World War II a subcamp of Buchenwald concentration camp was established, where 800 prisoners worked as forced labor in a &quot;Braunkohle-Benzin AG&quot; (&quot;Brabag&quot;) plant. Due to the strategically important industry, Böhlen suffered heavy aerial attacks in 1944/1945.

The principal industries were transferred into Soviet administration after World War II, and were returned to the GDR in 1952. In the same year, the &quot;Kulturhaus&quot; (arts and leisure center) was opened. By administratively merging the power station, the coal processing plants, and the motor fuel works, the publicly owned &quot;Kombinat&quot; &quot;Otto Grotewohl&quot; was formed. On 7 October 1964 Böhlen was awarded town status.

The neighbouring village of Zeschwitz was incorporated administratively into Böhlen in 1942, but mined over from 1943. Likewise, Stöhna (partially mined over since 1955) was incorporated in 1960, Trachenau (mostly mined over 1962–1965) in 1964, and Großdeuben in 1997.

The chemical works were acquired by Dow Olefinverbund in 1995.

Today Böhlen, as well as its neighboring city Zwenkau, are profiting from the newly formed Neuseenland, where old open-cast mines are being converted into huge lakes.

<text>Film production is an industry in the Greater Toronto Area, with the City of Toronto being colloquially referred to as Hollywood North. The city is home to a number of film production companies, as well as Canada&#x27;s largest film studio, Pinewood Toronto Studios.

A number of films shot in the city use Toronto as a setting in film. However, the majority of non-Canadian films that were shot in Toronto, do not explicitly use the city as the setting for the film being shot. Many American produced films use the city as a stand in for New York City or Chicago.

<doc id="933033" wikidata="Q78626" url="?curid=933033" title="Rudolph Schindler (architect)">
<text>Rudolph Michael Schindler (born Rudolf Michael Schlesinger; September 10, 1887 – August 22, 1953) was an Austrian-born American architect whose most important works were built in or near Los Angeles during the early to mid-twentieth century.

Although he worked and trained with some of its foremost practitioners, he often is associated with the fringes of the modernist movement in architecture. His use of complex three-dimensional forms, &quot;warm&quot; materials, and striking colors, as well as his ability to work within tight budgets, however, have placed him as one of the s of early twentieth century architecture. Reyner Banham said he designed &quot;as if there had never been houses before.&quot;

==Early history==
Rudolf Michael Schindler was born on September 10, 1887, to a middle-class Jewish family in Vienna, Austria. His father was a wood and metal craftsman and an importer; his mother was a dressmaker. He attended the Imperial and Royal High School, from 1899 to 1906, and enrolled at the Vienna University of Technology before attending the Vienna Academy of Fine Arts, or Wagnerschule, being graduated in 1911 with a degree in architecture. For unknown reasons, his family changed their surname from &#x27;Schlesinger&#x27; to &#x27;Schindler&#x27; in 1901.

Schindler was most influenced by professor Carl König, despite the presence of many other famous professors such as Otto Wagner and particularly, Adolf Loos. Most notably, in 1911, he was introduced to the work of Frank Lloyd Wright through the influential Wasmuth Portfolio.

Schindler also met his lifelong friend and rival Richard Neutra at the university in 1912, before completing his thesis project in 1913. Their careers would parallel each other: both would go to Los Angeles through Chicago, be recognized as important early modernists creating new styles suited to the Californian climate, and sometimes, both would work for the same clients. At one point, they and their wives shared a communal office and living structure that Schindler designed as his home and studio.

==Early professional career==

In Vienna, Schindler acquired experience in the firm of &quot;Hans Mayr and Theodore Mayer&quot;, working there from September 1911 to February 1914. Schindler then moved to Chicago to work in the firm of Ottenheimer, Stern, and Reichert (OSR), accepting a cut in pay to be in that progressive American city, which was the home of Frank Lloyd Wright. He found New York City, which he visited along the way, to be crowded, unattractive, and commercial. Chicago was more appealing to him, however, with less congestion and providing access to the architectural work of Henry Hobson Richardson, Louis Sullivan, and Frank Lloyd Wright.

==Establishing contact with Wright==

Schindler continued to seek contact with Wright, writing letters despite his limited English. He finally met him for the first time on December 30, 1914. Wright had little work at this stage, was still plagued by the destruction of Taliesin and the murder of his mistress earlier that year, and did not offer Schindler a job. Schindler continued work at OSR, keeping himself occupied with trips and study, notably familiarizing himself with the early tilt up slab work of Irving Gill.

Wright was able to hire Schindler after obtaining the commission for the Imperial Hotel in Tokyo, a major project that would keep the architect in Japan for several years. Schindler&#x27;s role was to continue Wright&#x27;s American operations in his absence, working out of Wright&#x27;s Oak Park studio. In 1919, Schindler met and married Pauline Gibling (1893–1977). In 1920, Wright summoned him to Los Angeles to work on the Barnsdall House.

Schindler was engaged to design several private commissions while in Los Angeles, notably, he completed what many think is his finest building, the Kings Road House, also known as the Schindler house or the Schindler-Chase house, as an office and home for two professional couples by late spring 1922. He and his wife were one of the couples living in the communal structure. He also started to take on several projects of his own.

During this time, fractures started to appear in the Schindler-Wright relationship. Schindler complained, with some validity, of being underpaid and exploited. As well as his architectural affairs, he was running Frank Lloyd Wright&#x27;s businesses, such as the rental of the Oak Park houses.

Of the houses Wright built in this period, the Hollyhock House was undoubtedly the most significant, for which Schindler did most of the drawings and oversaw the construction of, while Frank Lloyd Wright still was in Japan. The client, Aline Barnsdall, subsequently chose Schindler as her architect to design a number of other small projects for her on Olive Hill and a spectacular beach-side &#x27;translucent house&#x27; in 1927, which remains one of the great uncompleted projects of the twentieth century.

As Schindler was applying for a Los Angeles license to practice architecture in 1929, he mentioned his extensive work on the architectural and structural plans of the Imperial Hotel. Wright, however, refused to validate these claims. Eventually, disputes over whose work was whose, escalated until Schindler released a flier for a series of talks with Richard Neutra, describing himself as having been, &quot;in charge of the architectural office of Frank Lloyd Wright for two years during his absence&quot;. Wright refuted this claim. The two split in 1931 and didn&#x27;t reconcile until 1953, less than a year before Schindler&#x27;s death.

==Solo work==

Schindler&#x27;s early buildings usually are characterized by concrete construction. The Kings Road House, Pueblo Ribera Court, Lovell Beach House, Wolfe House, and How House are the projects most frequently identified among these.

The Kings Road house was designed as a studio and home for Schindler, his wife, and their friends Clyde and Marian DaCamara Chace. The floor plan worked itself around several L-shapes. Construction features included tilt up concrete panels cast on site, which contrasted with the more &#x27;open&#x27; walls of redwood and glass. It has largely become the symbol of Schindler&#x27;s architecture.

In a search to create a more inexpensive architecture, Schindler abandoned concrete and turned to the plaster-skin design. This type of construction is characteristic of his work throughout the 1930s and 1940s, but his interest in form and space never changed. The Rodriguez House appears in the film &quot;Pineapple Express&quot;.

He developed his own platform frame system, the Schindler Frame in 1945. His later work uses this system extensively as a basis for experimentation.

==Recognition==

Schindler&#x27;s early work, such as the Kings Road House and Lovell Beach House, largely went unnoticed in the wider architectural world. As early and radical as they were for modernism, they may have been too different for recognition and Los Angeles was not a significant location on the architectural map. Schindler was not included in the highly influential International Style exhibit of 1932, while Richard Neutra was and, to add insult to injury, Neutra, incorrectly, was credited as the Austrian who worked on the Imperial Hotel with Wright.

His first major exposure came in Esther McCoy&#x27;s &#x27;Five California Architects&#x27; of 1960. His work is undergoing somewhat of a contemporary revaluation for its inventiveness, character, and formal qualities, which are making his designs familiar to a new generation of architects.

The Mackey Apartments and the Schindler Residence are maintained by the Friends of the Schindler House and the MAK Center for Art and Architecture. The MAK Center offers a variety of exhibitions and events. The center also sponsors six-month residencies for emerging architects and artists who are housed in the Mackey Apartments.

<text>Neuseenland is an area south of Leipzig, Germany, where old open-cast mines are being converted into a huge lake district. The region&#x27;s name is a marketing concept and it means &quot;New land of lakes&quot; in German. It should not be confused with the German name for New Zealand, &quot;Neuseeland&quot;. It is planned to be finished in 2060 It is a part of the larger Central German Lake District.

It contains the following lakes, some of which are not yet flooded:

* 3 former open-cast mines north of Leipzig.

Altogether they have an expanse of 30,000 ha, approx 116 mi2. Once fully flooded they will have a final expanse of 270 mi2 (70,000 ha).

<doc id="933042" wikidata="Q142234" url="?curid=933042" title="Slovakia at the 2004 Summer Olympics">
<text>Slovakia competed at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece, from 13 to 29 August 2004. This was the nation&#x27;s third consecutive appearance at the Summer Olympics since the post-Czechoslovak era. The Slovak Olympic Committee sent a total of 64 athletes to the Games, 48 men and 16 women, to compete in 11 sports. There was only a single competitor in artistic and trampoline gymnastics and sailing.

The Slovak team featured four Olympic medalists from Sydney: freestyle and butterfly swimmer Martina Moravcová, twins Pavol and Peter Hochschorner, and slalom canoeist Michal Martikán, who later became the nation&#x27;s flag bearer in the opening ceremony. Along with Moravcova, sprint canoeist Peter Páleš and track cyclist Jaroslav Jeřábek were among the Slovak athletes to compete in four editions of the Summer Olympics, although they previously appeared as part of the Czechoslovak team (Pales in 1988; Jerabek and Moravcova in 1992). Other notable Slovak athletes featured professional tennis players Daniela Hantuchová and Karol Beck, rifle shooter and former Olympic medalist Jozef Gönci, and slalom kayak world champion Elena Kaliská.

Slovakia left Athens with a total of six Olympic medals, an equal allocation of gold, silver, and bronze with two each, surpassing a single short of the tally from Sydney four years earlier. While the Hochschorner twins defended their Olympic title in double slalom canoeing, Slovak athletes continued to dominate the sport, as Elena Kaliská and Michal Martikán managed to claim Olympic medals in their respective events. Jozef Gönci added a second bronze to his Olympic career in men&#x27;s air rifle shooting, while Jozef Krnáč set a historic milestone for Slovakia, after earning the nation&#x27;s first Olympic medal in judo.

<text>A greeting card is a piece of card stock, usually with an illustration or photo, made of high quality paper featuring an expression of friendship or other sentiment. Although greeting cards are usually given on special occasions such as birthdays, Christmas or other holidays, such as Halloween, they are also sent to convey thanks or express other feelings (such as condolences or best wishes to get well from illness).

Greeting cards are usually packaged using an envelope and come in a variety of styles. There are both mass-produced and handmade versions available and they may be distributed by hundreds of companies large and small. While typically inexpensive, more elaborate cards with die-cuts, pop-ups, sound elements or glued-on decorations may be more expensive.

Hallmark Cards and American Greetings, both U.S.-based companies, are the two largest producers of greeting cards in the world today.
In Western countries and increasingly in other societies, many people traditionally mail seasonally themed cards to their friends and relatives in December. Many service businesses also send cards to their customers in this season, usually with a universally acceptable non-religious message such as &quot;happy holidays&quot; or &quot;season&#x27;s greetings.&quot;

== Types ==

Counter cards: Greeting cards that are sold individually. This contrasts with boxed cards.

;Standard: A standard greeting card is printed on high-quality paper (such as card stock), and is rectangular and folded, with a picture or decorative motif on the front. Inside is a pre-printed message appropriate for the occasion, along with a blank space for the sender to add a signature or handwritten message. A matching envelope is sold with the card. Some cards and envelopes feature fancy materials, such as gold leaf, ribbons, or glitter.
;Handmade: A Handmade card is a card which includes a production stage or a feature that is made by hand. The term covers a wide range of products including not only for example, applique items or ribbons but also pop-up and 3-D cards as well as cards made with mixed materials. The term &quot;Handmade&quot; is applied both to cards made by amateurs and to volume-production cards that include stages made by hand.
;Photo: A photo card is a card which features a photograph chosen by the sender. There are two main types of photo card. The first is the photo insert card which is designed to display a sender&#x27;s own photo. Depending on the card design, the photo is stuck to the card, clipped to the card or slid into a pocket in the card into which a hole has been cut to act as a frame. The second type is the printed photo card, in which the photo is combined with artwork and printed directly onto the face of the card. Both types are popular for sending holiday greetings such as Christmas, Hanukkah, and for baby showers, where the sender wishes to send a memento of their own family. See also Personalised cards.
;Personalised: A personalised card is a card which is personalised with the sender&#x27;s own pictures or a personal audible message. Websites using special print-personalisation technology, such as Moonpig, allow consumers to personalise a card which is then printed and sent directly to the recipient. Sound personalization is also possible using a small recording device called a Botski, which is a sticker-based recordable medium allowing users to record songs, sounds or spoken words and include them in a greeting card.
;Reusable: These are greeting cards for the budget conscious. There are two common formats for reusable cards. Firstly, there are cards with slits in them positioned to hold pages. Secondly, there are notepad style cards where pages stick to the back of the cards. The pages that have been used for reusable cards can be removed after being received and fresh pages can be used to reuse the cards.
;Sound-based or Musical: Some greeting cards play music or other sound when they are opened. They are commonly 3D handmade cards which play traditional celebration songs such as &quot;Happy Birthday To You.” They also may be personalized using a Botski which is a small, sticker-based recordable medium which users can record their own music, sounds or voice greeting and apply it to a card.
;Electronic: (also called e-cards) Greeting cards can also be sent electronically. Flash-based cards can be sent by email, and many sites such as Facebook enable users to send greetings. More recently, companies such as 2050cards have started providing ecards as downloadable videos that can be sent mobile-to-mobile via instant messaging platforms such as WhatsApp and Facebook. 
;Quilling Cards: Quilling cards are greeting cards that contain a Quilled design on the front of the card. Quilling is an artform where strips of paper are rolled to make intricate designs. These cards are unique and handcrafted and are often framed as works of art.
;Pop-up:Pop-up cards are normally cards that, once opened, have a picture coming outward, giving the reader a surprise. Pictures and printed messages in greeting cards come in various styles, from fine art to humorous to profane. Non-specific cards, unrelated to any occasion, might feature a picture (or a pocket to paste in a personal photograph) but no pre-printed message. Paper Pop Cards has a patent for detachable pop-up cards which lets the pop-up be saved as a keepsake. Pop-up card designs are inspired by the Kirigami art form, which originated in Japan. This card style has spread to the US, U.K., India and elsewhere. In Shark Tank episode 605 in season 11, the startup Lovepop cards founded by Wombi Rose and John Wise appeared with Kirigami art inspired pop up cards and raised $300,000 of funding.

=== Printable ===
: Also known as &quot;digital&quot; greeting cards, they can be found online through shopping platforms such as Etsy and some blogs. Usually available in the form of a PDF document, the design for a card can be printed out at home or a local print shop. Printable cards have allowed designers to make cards readily available to customers all over the world.

=== Get Well ===
: A get-well card is a greeting card which is sent to someone when they are ill. Their use in the case of chronic and terminal illness is problematic because the patient may not be expected to recover but they may still offer comfort to the invalid.

=== Fabric ===
The concept of a khaki fabric card appeared in 1899 during the first Christmas of the Boer War and was issued by a business in Glasgow. In New Zealand, it was not uncommon to receive a khaki greeting card, even the premier, RJ Seddon is said to have received one. An example of a fabric card is held by the Auckland War Memorial Museum, and is a small square of fabric with a heavy fringe created by threads with a hand written greeting.  

==History==

The custom of sending greeting cards can be traced back to the ancient Chinese who exchanged messages of good will to celebrate
the New Year, and to the early Egyptians, who conveyed their greetings on papyrus scrolls. By the early 15th century, handmade paper greeting cards were being exchanged in Europe. The Germans are known to have printed New Year&#x27;s greetings from woodcuts as early as 1400, and handmade paper Valentines were being exchanged in various parts of Europe in the early to mid-15th century, with the oldest Valentine in existence being in the British Museum. The card was written to Bonne of Armagnac by her husband, Charles Duke of Orleans, who was imprisoned in the Tower of London at the time. Not surprisingly, its message is rather downbeat. Its opening reads: ‘I am already sick of love / my very gentle Valentine.’

By the 1850s, the greeting card had been transformed from a relatively expensive, handmade and hand-delivered gift to a popular and affordable means of personal communication, due largely to advances in printing, mechanization, and a reduction in postal rates with the introduction of the postage stamp. This was followed by new trends like Christmas cards, the first of which appeared in published form in London in 1843 when Sir Henry Cole hired artist John Calcott Horsley to design a holiday card that he could send to his friends and acquaintances. In the 1860s, inventor Hugh Pierce Jr., inspired by the Christmas card, invented the Birthday card. Companies like Marcus Ward &amp; Co, Charles Goodall &amp; Son, and Charles Bennett began the mass production of greeting cards. They employed well-known artists such as Kate Greenaway and Walter Crane as illustrators and card designers. The extensive Laura Seddon Greeting Card Collection from the Manchester Metropolitan University gathers 32,000 Victorian and Edwardian greeting cards and 450 Valentine&#x27;s Day cards dating from the early nineteenth century, printed by the major publishers of the day.

Technical developments like color lithography in 1930 propelled the manufactured greeting card industry forward. Humorous greeting cards, known as studio cards, became popular in the late 1940s and 1950s.

In the 1970s, Recycled Paper Greetings, a small company needing to establish a competing identity against the large companies like Hallmark Cards, began publishing humorous, whimsical card designs with the artist&#x27;s name credited on the back. This was away from what was known as the standard look (sometimes called the Hallmark look.)

During the 1980s, reduced costs of small batch printing and die cutting together with a growing taste for handmade cards made it economically possible for smaller niche companies to set up in competition with the large established brands. Innovative companies such as Nobleworks and Meri Meri grew from their foundation in the 1980s to becoming significant influencers in the industry. A thriving market was established for what were now called &quot;alternative&quot; greeting cards. The name stuck even though these &quot;alternative&quot; cards grew to embrace a vast range of styles and ultimately changed the look of the industry.

The largest recorded number of greeting cards sent to a single person went to Craig Shergold, a beneficiary/victim of chain letters and later chain emails.

==Economic effects==
In the United Kingdom, an estimated one billion pounds are spent on greeting cards every year, with the average person sending 55 cards annually. In the United States, approximately 6.5 billion greeting cards are bought each year, at a total cost of more than US$7 billion.

A counter card in the U.S. typically sells for $2 to $4. Boxed cards, which are a popular option for Christmas cards or other times when multiple cards are sent, tend to cost less.

==Greeting Card Association==
The Greeting Card Association is a U.S. trade organization representing the interests of greeting card and stationery manufacturers. John Beeder, former president of the Greeting Card Association, says greeting cards are effective tools to communicate important feelings to people you care about: &quot;Anyone feels great when they receive an unexpected card in the mail. For me, there’s nothing like a greeting card to send a special message. I’m proud to be a part of an industry that not only keeps people connected, but uses both imagery and the power of words to help us express our emotions.”

==Louie Awards==
Since 1988, the Greeting Card Association has held an annual award ceremony for the best greetings cards published that year. The awards are called Louies in recognition of Louis Prang, described as the Father of the American Christmas Card.

<doc id="933060" wikidata="Q990976" url="?curid=933060" title="One Hour Photo">
<text>One Hour Photo is a 2002 American psychological thriller film written and directed by Mark Romanek and starring Robin Williams, Connie Nielsen, Michael Vartan, Gary Cole and Eriq La Salle. The film was produced by Catch 23 Entertainment, Killer Films and John Wells Productions and released by Fox Searchlight Pictures. The film stars Williams as a photo technician who develops an unhealthy obsession with a family to whom he has long provided services.

The film premiered at the 2002 Sundance Film Festival, was given a limited release on August 21, 2002, and was given a wider release on September 13. &quot;One Hour Photo&quot; received positive reviews from film critics, including praise for Williams&#x27; against-type performance, for which he earned the Saturn Award for Best Actor.

==Plot==
Sy Parrish is a photo technician at a one-hour photo lab in big-box store SavMart. He lives alone with a pet hamster, has no friends or love life, and lives only for his work, which he considers a &quot;vital service&quot;. His favorite customers are the Yorkin family, whose photos he has developed for many years. Over the years, he has grown obsessed with the family, enshrining them in his home with their photos that he secretly copies. However, because he is shy and socially inept, his attempts to become closer to the family are gently rebuffed.

Sy eventually manages to spark a connection with Nina Yorkin when he pretends to be interested in a book that he saw her purchase. Nina learns that Sy lives a solitary existence, something only her son Jake had considered previously. The next day, store manager Bill Owens discovers, through an audit investigation on company expenditures, that over the span of nine years, Sy has printed many more prints than those that have been ordered and paid for by the customers. For this, as well as other infractions, Sy is fired from SavMart. Bill allows him to finish the week, although Sy is devastated.

While inspecting a customer&#x27;s photos, Sy discovers that Will Yorkin is having an affair, and his idyllic conception of the Yorkins as the perfect family is shattered. He surreptitiously places the photos of Will and his mistress, Maya Burson, into a packet of photos that Nina was scheduled to pick up. Meanwhile, Sy takes paparazzi-style photos of Bill&#x27;s young daughter, sends the film with the photos to Yoshi (another SavMart employee), who turns them over to Bill, who reports the matter to the police.

While detectives James Van Der Zee and Paul Outerbridge discover Sy&#x27;s obsession, Sy confronts Will and Maya during a rendezvous in their hotel room. Armed with a knife and a camera, Sy forces the lovers to pose naked in sexual positions while he takes pictures. After the confrontation, Sy notices that the police have arrived at the hotel, and escapes through an emergency exit. The exit door trips an alarm, and Van Der Zee pursues Sy while Outerbridge finds Will and Maya physically unharmed but emotionally traumatized. The police apprehend Sy in the parking garage. On his arrest, Sy claims &quot;I just took pictures.&quot;

In the police interrogation room, Van Der Zee asks why Sy terrorized Will and Maya. Sy says that he can tell Van Der Zee is a good father who would never commit adultery or take &quot;disgusting, sick, degrading pictures&quot; of his children (implying that Sy&#x27;s own father exploited him for child pornography), and the affair between Will and Maya sparked his traumatic memory, which Sy had to avenge. Satisfied with his candid testimony, Van Der Zee expresses his appreciation. Sy requests to see the pictures that he took at the hotel, which Van Der Zee turns over to him, at which point Sy methodically displays them on the table. They appear to be only shots of objects and furnishings of a hotel room. After he is left alone in the room, Sy imagines himself as being part of a happy family picture of the Yorkins, with Will&#x27;s arm around a smiling Sy.

==Cast==
==Production==

Trent Reznor of the band Nine Inch Nails was originally asked to compose the film&#x27;s score. However, early in the process, Romanek was allegedly pressured by the studio to hire a &quot;real composer&quot;, and Reznor was dropped from the production. Some of the music that Reznor created for the film evolved into material found on the Nine Inch Nails EP &quot;Still&quot;.

In accordance with the photography-themed movie, the names of several characters are drawn from actual photographers: Sy&#x27;s assistant at the Savmart, Yoshi Araki (named for Nobuyoshi Araki), manager Bill Owens (Bill Owens), Det. Van Der Zee (James Van Der Zee), Det. Outerbridge (Paul Outerbridge), Maya Burson (Nancy Burson), and Savmart customers Mrs. von Unwerth (Ellen von Unwerth) and Mr. Siskind (Aaron Siskind).

In one of the voice-over pieces, Sy can be heard saying, &quot;They actually believe that any idiot that attends a two-day seminar can master the art of making beautiful prints in less than an hour. But of course, like most things, there&#x27;s far more to it than meets the eye.&quot; Williams prepared for the role by training for two and a half days in a Southern California photo development lab.

In an interview, Romanek said that he was inspired to create the movie by films from the 1970s about &quot;lonely men&quot;, notably &quot;Taxi Driver&quot; (1976).

In the DVD commentary, Romanek says that Jack Nicholson was first approached to play the lead character. Nicholson turned down the role reportedly because he thought that the character was too similar to the role he played in &quot;The Shining&quot; (1980).

==Reception==

===Critical response===
On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, &quot;One Hour Photo&quot; holds an approval rating of 81% based on 198 reviews, with an average rating of 7/10. The site&#x27;s critics consensus reads: &quot;Robin Williams is very effective in this creepy, well-shot thriller.&quot; At Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 64 out of 100, based on 35 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;C&quot; on a scale of A+ to F.

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave the film three and a half stars out of four, and wrote, &quot;Robin Williams plays Sy, another of his open-faced, smiling madmen, like the killer in &quot;Insomnia&quot;. He does this so well you don&#x27;t have the slightest difficulty accepting him in the role.&quot;

Mick LaSalle of the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; noted that the film is &quot;not nearly as intelligent, thoughtful or penetrating as it promises to be. Yet the consistent delicacy and emotional clarity of Williams&#x27; acting in &quot;One Hour Photo&quot; makes the picture impossible to dismiss.&quot;

===Box office===

<doc id="933063" wikidata="Q508790" url="?curid=933063" title="Chastushka">
<text>Chastushka (, plural: chastushki) is a traditional type of short Russian humorous folk song with high beat frequency, that consists of one four-lined couplet, full of humor, satire or irony. It may be described as &quot;&quot; . The term &quot;chastushki&quot; was first used by Gleb Uspensky in his book about Russian folk rhymes published 1889. Usually many chastushki are sung one after another. Chastushki make use of a simple rhyming scheme to convey humorous or ironic content. The singing and recitation of such rhymes were an important part of peasant popular culture both before and after the Bolshevik Revolution of 1917.

==Form==

A chastushka (plural: chastushki) is a simple rhyming poem which would be characterized derisively in English as doggerel. The name originates from the Russian word &quot;часто&quot; (&quot;chasto&quot;) – &quot;frequently&quot;, or from &quot;частить&quot; (&quot;chastit&quot;), meaning &quot;to do something with high frequency&quot; and probably refers to the high beat frequency of chastushki.

The basic form is a simple four-line verse making use of an ABAB, ABCB, or AABB rhyme scheme.

Usually humorous, satirical, or ironic in nature, chastushki are often put to music as well, usually with balalaika or accordion accompaniment. The rigid, short structure (and, to a lesser degree, the type of humor used) parallels the poetic genre of limericks in British culture.

Sometimes several chastushki are delivered in sequence to form a song. After each chastushka, there is a full musical refrain without lyrics to give the listeners a chance to laugh without missing the next one. Originally chastushki were a form of folk entertainment, not intended to be performed on stage. Often they are sung in turns by a group of people. Sometimes they are used as a medium for a back-and-forth mocking contest. Improvisation is highly valued during chastushka singing.

==Content==

Chastushki cover a very wide spectrum of topics, from lewd jokes to political satire, including such diverse themes as love songs and Communist propaganda.

Following the 1917 Russian Revolution, chastushki varied considerably in content from region to region. In some areas hit particularly hard by the grain requisitioning of the Soviet regime during the Civil War, such as Ryazan, peasant chastushki tended to be bitterly hostile. In other places, particularly those in close proximity to Moscow under Stalin&#x27;s leadership, &quot;Soviet chastushki&quot; favorable to Stalin&#x27;s Bolshevik government were sung and recited.

In the early 1920s chastushki were used by Young Communists in organized village gatherings as a form of anti-religious propaganda, subjecting the church and the rural clergy to ridicule using the traditional rural poetic form. Scholar Lynne Viola provides one such example of an anti-religious Soviet rhyme, rendered here in literal English translation:
&quot;All the pious are on a spree,&quot;
&quot;They see God is not at home.&quot;
&quot;He got drunk on homebrewed liquor,&quot;
&quot;And left to go abroad.&quot;

Given the difficult economic circumstances of the Soviet peasantry in the late 1920s and 1930s, chastushki overwhelmingly took an anti-government form, with the singing of anti-Soviet couplets a common practice at peasant festivals of the period. Following the assassination of Communist Party leader Sergei Kirov late in 1934, chastushki sprung up relating the killing to a recent decision to terminate bread rationing, including this literal translation of one example provided by scholar Sheila Fitzpatrick:
&quot;When Kirov was killed,&quot;
&quot;They allowed free trade in bread.&quot;
&quot;When Stalin is killed,&quot;
&quot;They will disband all the collective farms.&quot;

== Examples ==
Many folk chastushki are lewd or laden with vulgarities. The following are some relatively printable examples, with slightly loose English translations that attempt to give an approximate feeling of the chastushka&#x27;s rhyme and meter, and the general meaning:

<doc id="933071" wikidata="Q3028083" url="?curid=933071" title="Hooghalen">
<text>Hooghalen is a village in the municipality Midden-Drenthe, in the Dutch province Drenthe. In Drenthe it is also called &quot; Hoal&#x27;n &quot; or &quot; Hoalen &quot;, but then people often mean the entire area, with the neighborhoods Laaghalen, Laaghalerveen and Oosthalen.

It is located on the flank of sandy soils, above a salt dome. The main attraction of Hooghalen is the Herinneringscentrum Kamp Westerbork. Here the history is told of Westerbork Camp and the Jewish persecution in general. The former camp is located on the edge of the southern village Westerbork.

== Facilities ==
The village of Hooghalen has a Dutch Reformed and a Reformed Churches liberated church and also has a Reformed municipality. Other facilities in the village are: sports fields, football club HHCombi, a public primary school, a supermarket with postal agency, a bakery and a few other shops and restaurants. Thanks to its location on the Oude Provincialeweg and the A28, Hooghalen can be easily reached by car. There is a motorway connection to the north and south of the village. The railway line Meppel – Groningen runs just east of the village, but there is no longer a station. Hooghalen Station was closed in 1938.

== Environment ==
At the northern edge of the village is a small forest, &quot; &#x27;t Witte Zand &quot;. To the east of the village lies not only the modest ess, but also a large nature reserve: the Hoogwaardij Boswachterij. This consists not only of coniferous forest, but also of a peat bog area (the Hingstveen) and heathland. The camp site is in the middle of the area, the memorial center on the outskirts. Since the end of the sixties there has been a row of radio telescopes, the Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope. To prevent disturbance of the observations, motorized traffic and the use of mobile phone s in the wider area is not permitted.

The Heuvingerzand is also part of the forestry. This does not apply to the Groote Zand, a forest and heath area to the north-east of Hooghalen that is owned by The Drentse Landschap. In addition, there is Hijkerveld between Hooghalen and Hijken, which consists of moorland, fens, peat remains and deciduous forest. There is also a sheep cage, where the shepherd leaves every day at half past nine with his Schoonebekers to the heath, and brings the sheep back to the cage at half past four.

== History ==
Until the 18th century no distinction was made between Hooghalen and Laaghalen. Laaghalen is probably a medieval spin-off from Hooghalen. Both places were part of the boermarke van Haelen. The marke was not split in two until 1864, although the villages were already functioning independently at that time. In 1870, Hooghalen received a station on the newly constructed Meppel-Groningen railway line. In 1938 it was closed due to a lack of customers. Fighting acts at the end of the Second World War destroyed many old farms and in the village center. After the Second World War, Hooghalen was expanded on a modest scale with new construction. The village slowly changed from an agricultural village into a commuter village and many farms were given a residential function, a development that took place everywhere in Drenthe.

Until 1 January 1998, Hooghalen was part of the municipality Beilen. At present, the village is located in the municipality of Midden-Drenthe through a merger with the municipality of Westerbork and the municipality Smilde. An Easter fire is also held every year in Hooghalen

== Education ==
There is one primary school, De Bosvlinder.

<doc id="933076" wikidata="Q1268530" url="?curid=933076" title="Dwingeloo">
<text>Dwingeloo () is a village halfway between Meppel and Assen in the Dutch province of Drenthe. It is a part of the municipality of Westerveld.

The village is known internationally because of the radio telescope of the Dwingeloo Radio Observatory (which at the time of its completion in 1956 was the largest radio telescope in the world), located on the edge of the Dwingeloo Heath, 3 km south of the village. The telescope discovered Dwingeloo 1 and Dwingeloo 2, two galaxies about 10 million light-years away from the Earth in the constellation Cassiopeia.

== History ==
The village was first mentioned in 1181 as Twingelo. The etymology is unclear. Dwingeloo is an &quot;esdorp&quot; which developed in the Early Middle Ages. The church is located on the north side of a large village square which contained a drinking water pool.

The Dutch Reformed church was built in the 15th century as a replacement of the medieval church which had a detached tower. The union shaped crown has been placed on top the tower in 1631 after the old spire had collapsed. The church was damaged by a village fire in 1923, and was restored between 1923 and 1925.

The &quot;havezate&quot; (manor house) Westrup is one of the four &quot;havezates&quot; of Dwingeloo, and the only one which has remained intact. It was built around 1600, and enlarged in 1740. It received a neoclassic facade and an extra floor in 1870. Between 1984 and 1986, it was restored and is used as an office building.

Dwingeloo was a separate municipality until 1998, when it became a part of Westerveld.

<doc id="933109" wikidata="Q235931" url="?curid=933109" title="Teena Marie">
<text>Mary Christine Brockert (March 5, 1956 – December 26, 2010), known professionally as Teena Marie, was an American soul and R&amp;B singer, songwriter, and producer. She was known by her childhood nickname Tina before taking the stage name Teena Marie and later acquired the nickname Lady T, given to her by her collaborator and friend Rick James.

She was known for her distinctive and soulful soprano vocals, which caused many listeners to believe she was black. Her success in R&amp;B and soul music, and loyalty to these genres earned her the title Ivory Queen of Soul. She played rhythm guitar, keyboards, and congas. Teena Marie was a 4 time Grammy Award nominee.

==Early life==
Mary Christine Brockert was born on March 5, 1956, in Santa Monica, California, the daughter of construction worker Thomas Leslie Brockert and home renovator Mary Anne. She spent her early childhood in Mission Hills, California. She said that her ethnic heritage was Belgian, Portuguese, Italian, Irish, and Native American. In 2005, while visiting Louisiana, she discovered that her paternal ancestors once lived in New Orleans. She took to singing naturally, performing Harry Belafonte&#x27;s &quot;Banana Boat Song&quot; by age 2.

When she was eight years old, her parents began sending Tina on auditions which, among other things, netted her an acting role on &quot;The Beverly Hillbillies&quot;, credited as Tina Marie Brockert. She later taught herself the guitar, bass, and congas. She formed a semi-professional R&amp;B band with her younger brother Anthony and their cousin.

In the early 1970s, after the family moved to Venice, California, Brockert spent her adolescent years in the historically black Venice enclave of Oakwood, nicknamed &quot;Venice Harlem&quot;. There, she acquired a strong spiritual influence from neighborhood matriarch Berthalynn Jackson, a black woman who became her godmother.

While attending Venice High School, Brockert joined the Summer Dance Production and was the female lead in the school&#x27;s production of &quot;The Music Man&quot;. She also fronted a local Venice rock band &quot;Truvair&quot; in 1974–1975; the band&#x27;s members were her high school classmates. Following graduation, Brockert juggled auditioning for various record companies with studying English literature at Santa Monica College.

==Career==
===1976–1982: Gordy era===
In 1976, Brockert (as the lead singer of a band she had assembled, which included long-time friend Mickey Boyce) gained an introduction to Motown Records staff producer Hal Davis (best known for his work with Brenda Holloway and the Jackson 5). It led to an audition for a film about orphans that was being developed by Motown. The project was shelved, but label boss Berry Gordy, impressed with her singing but having no need for a musical group, decided to sign her as a solo act. Tina recorded unreleased material with a number of different producers over the next few years, before being spotted by labelmate Rick James, who was immediately impressed with her sound. Some of Tina&#x27;s earlier, unreleased material has been made available on the compilation album &quot;First Class Love: Rare Tee&quot;. At the time, James, already established as a successful recording artist, was on tap to produce for Diana Ross but changed his mind and decided to work with Brockert, instead. The result was her debut album release, &quot;Wild and Peaceful&quot;. The album was, at one point, due to be credited to &quot;Teena Tryson&quot;, but ultimately was put out under &quot;Teena Marie&quot;, the name by which she was known throughout her remaining career. It scored Teena Marie her first top-ten R&amp;B hit &quot;I&#x27;m a Sucker for Your Love&quot; (#8 R&amp;B Singles Chart), a duet with James. Neither the album nor its packaging had her picture on it, and many radio programmers assumed she was black during the earliest months of her career. This myth was disproved when she performed her debut hit with James on &quot;Soul Train&quot; in 1979, becoming the show&#x27;s first white female guest. (She appeared on the show eight more times, more than any other white act.)

Her album &quot;Lady T&quot; (1980), featured her portrait on the cover, and it is noted for having production from Richard Rudolph (the widower of R&amp;B singer Minnie Riperton). Teena Marie had asked Berry Gordy to contact Rudolph and secure his input, as Rick James was unavailable, and she felt unprepared to be sole producer of her own material. Rudolph had intended for &quot;Now That I Have You&quot;, a song he penned, for his wife Minnie Riperton, but offered it to Teena Marie for &quot;Lady T&quot;. Rudolph also co-composed the single &quot;Behind the Groove&quot;, which reached number 21 on the R&amp;B singles chart and No. 6 on the U.K. singles chart in 1980. The song also was included on the soundtrack of &quot;Grand Theft Auto: Vice City&quot; on the &quot;Fever 105&quot; radio station.

Also in 1980, Teena Marie released the LP &quot;Irons in the Fire&quot;, for which she handled most of the writing and production herself, an achievement considered rare at the time for a female artist. The single &quot;I Need Your Lovin&#x27;&quot; (#37 Pop, No. 9 R&amp;B Singles) brought Teena Marie her first top 40 hit; it also peaked at No. 28 in the UK chart.

The same year, Teena Marie appeared on James&#x27; album &quot;Street Songs&quot;, with the duet &quot;Fire and Desire&quot;. In an interview, Teena Marie said she had a fever at the time yet managed to record her vocals in one take. After the session, she was driven to a hospital. The two performed the single at the 2004 BET Awards, which was their last TV appearance with one another, as James died later that year.

Teena Marie continued her success with Motown in 1981, with the release of &quot;It Must Be Magic&quot; (#2 R&amp;B Albums Chart), her first gold record, which included her then biggest hit on R&amp;B, &quot;Square Biz&quot; (#3 R&amp;B Singles). Other notable tracks include &quot;Portuguese Love&quot; (featuring a brief, uncredited cameo by James, No. 54 R&amp;B Singles), the title track &quot;It Must be Magic&quot; (#30 R&amp;B Singles).

In 1982, Teena Marie got into a heated legal battle with Motown Records over her contract and disagreements about releasing her new material. The lawsuit resulted in &quot;The Brockert Initiative&quot;, which made it illegal for a record company to keep an artist under contract without releasing new material for that artist. In such instances, artists are able to sign and release with another label instead of being held back by an unsupportive one. Teena Marie commented on the law in a &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; article, saying &quot;It wasn&#x27;t something I set out to do. I just wanted to get away from Motown and have a good life. But it helped a lot of people, like Luther Vandross and the Mary Jane Girls, and a lot of different artists, to be able to get out of their contracts.&quot; She left Motown as the label&#x27;s most successful white solo act.

===1983–1990: Epic era===
Contacted by Epic Records in the fall of 1982, after expressing dismay over her Motown contract, Teena Marie signed a worldwide deal with the Columbia Records subsidiary that also allowed her to establish her own publishing company, Midnight Magnet. Epic released the concept album &quot;Robbery&quot;, which featured the hit &quot;Fix It&quot; (#21 R&amp;B), as well as &quot;Shadow Boxing&quot; and &quot;Casanova Brown&quot;. The latter was one of many tracks Teena Marie wrote over the years about her real-life romance with one-time mentor Rick James.

In 1984, Teena Marie released her biggest-selling album &quot;Starchild&quot;. It yielded &quot;Lovergirl&quot;, her biggest hit, which peaked at No. 4 on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart in March 1985 and at No. 9 on the R&amp;B chart. &quot;Lovergirl&quot; was included in the 2002 Jennifer Lopez movie &quot;Maid in Manhattan&quot;. The label also released the moderate R&amp;B hit &quot;Out on a Limb&quot;, which peaked at No. 56 on the R&amp;B chart but didn&#x27;t break the Hot 100. &quot;14k&quot; was featured on the soundtrack of the film &quot;The Goonies&quot; (1985) but this song was not a hit.

In 1986, Teena Marie released a rock music-influenced concept album titled &quot;Emerald City&quot;. She also recorded the rock-influenced track &quot;Lead Me On&quot;, co-produced by Giorgio Moroder, for the soundtrack of the box-office hit film &quot;Top Gun&quot; (1986).

In 1988, she returned to R&amp;B and funk, releasing the critically acclaimed album &quot;Naked to the World&quot;. That album contained the hit &quot;Ooo La La La&quot;, which reached # 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Singles &amp; Tracks chart.

Teena Marie released &quot;Ivory&quot; in the fall of 1990; it scored no pop hits, but it did experience two R&amp;B hits: &quot;Here&#x27;s Looking at You&quot; (#11 R&amp;B) and &quot;If I Were a Bell&quot; (#8 R&amp;B).

===1991–2002: Hiatus and &quot;Passion Play&quot; and &quot;Black Rain&quot;===
During the 1990s, Teena Marie&#x27;s classic R&amp;B, soul, and funk records were either sampled by hip-hop artists or covered by R&amp;B divas. Teena Marie herself is regarded as something of a pioneer in helping to bring hip-hop to the mainstream by becoming one of the first artists of her time to rap one of her singles—the aforementioned &quot;Square Biz&quot;. In the hip-hop portion of that song, she mentions some of her inspirations: Sarah Vaughan, Johann Sebastian Bach, Shakespeare, Maya Angelou, and Nikki Giovanni. In 1996, the Fugees paid tribute to her by interpolating the chorus of her hit &quot;Ooo, La, La, La&quot; (1988), into its own &quot;Fu-Gee-La&quot;.

In the fall of 1994, Teena Marie released &quot;Passion Play&quot; on her independent label, Sarai Records.

On March 30, 1995, Teena Marie appeared and performed in an episode of &quot;New York Undercover&quot; as an old friend of one of the characters.

Subsequently, Teena Marie devoted most of her time to raising her daughter Alia Rose (who has since adopted the stage name &quot;Rose Le Beau&quot; and is pursuing her own singing career). During the late 1990s, she began working on a new album, titled &quot;Black Rain&quot;. She was unable to secure a major label deal for the album and did not want to put it out on her own Sarai label, in light of the modest sales of &quot;Passion Play&quot;. However, a version pressed for promotional purposes was widely bootlegged among fans. This contained the tracks, &quot;The Mackin&#x27; Game&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;ll Take the Pressure&quot;, &quot;Baby, I&#x27;m Your Fiend&quot;, &quot;My Body&#x27;s Hungry&quot;, &quot;Ecstasy&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;m on Fire&quot;, &quot;Watcha Got 4 Me&quot;, &quot;Black Rain&quot;, &quot;1999&quot;, &quot;Butterflies&quot;, &quot;Spanish Harlem&quot;, &quot;Blackberry Playa&quot;, &quot;The Perfect Feeling&quot;, and &quot;Rainbow Outro&quot;.

===2003–2010: &quot;La Doña&quot; to &quot;Congo Square&quot;===

After a ten-year hiatus from the music industry, Teena Marie returned to her musical career by signing with the Classics sub-label of the successful hip-hop label, Cash Money Records. She released the album &quot;La Doña&quot; in 2004, and follow up &quot;Sapphire&quot; in 2006. &quot;La Doña&quot; became a gold-certified success (and the highest-charting album of her career, peaking at No. 6 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart) on the basis of the Al Green-sampled &quot;I&#x27;m Still in Love&quot; (#23 R&amp;B, No. 70 Pop) and &quot;A Rose by Any Other Name&quot;, a duet with Gerald Levert.

The &quot;Sapphire&quot; album peaked at No. 24 on the &quot;Billboard 200&quot; chart, yielding yet another &quot;R&amp;B&quot; Top-40 hit, &quot;Ooh Wee&quot; (#32). &quot;Sapphire&quot; also reunited Teena (on &quot;God Has Created&quot; and &quot;Cruise Control&quot;) with Smokey Robinson, one of her musical idols. Teena Marie parted ways with Ca$h Money records after the release of &quot;Sapphire&quot;.

On September 19, 2008, Teena Marie performed in concert at B.B. King&#x27;s Blues Club in New York City. She took this time to play a couple of finished tracks from her upcoming album &quot;Congo Square&quot; and received a positive response from the audience. &quot;Congo Square&quot; was released on June 9, 2009, on Stax/Concord Records. Teena Marie has described the album as &quot;personal and spiritual&quot;, and indicated that it was more jazz-influenced than most of her previous work. &quot;Can&#x27;t Last a Day&quot;, a duet with Faith Evans, leaked to the Internet in March 2009. Teena Marie says of Evans: &quot;It was after I had recorded the song (&quot;Can&#x27;t Last a Day&quot;) I got the idea to put Faith on it. I&#x27;ve always loved Faith and her vocal style. She reminds me of me. Her correlation with Biggie – having a career with him and without him – reminds me of me and Rick. I feel like she&#x27;s a younger me. Of the younger ladies, she&#x27;s the one I love most.&quot;

Regarding the early-life inspirations for &quot;Congo Square&quot;, Teena Marie told &quot;Blues &amp; Soul&quot; magazine editor Lee Tyler in January 2010: &quot;I wanted to do songs that reflected the things that I loved when I was growing up. Every single song on the record is dedicated to someone, or some musical giant that I loved. &#x27;The Pressure&#x27; is dedicated to Rick James; &#x27;Can&#x27;t Last a Day&#x27; is dedicated to the Gamble &amp; Huff sound – the Philly International sound&#x27;. Then &#x27;Baby I Love You&#x27; and &#x27;Ear Candy&#x27; are dedicated to Marvin Gaye and Curtis Mayfield – with memories of riding down Crenshaw in LA in jeeps and bumping to music on &quot;the 808&quot; i.e. Roland TR-808 drum machine. While &#x27;Miss Coretta&#x27; is, of course, dedicated to Mrs. Coretta Scott King, the late wife of Martin Luther King.&quot;

Sales-wise, the album proved another success, reaching the Top 20 on &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s Top 200, and giving Teena Marie yet another Top 10 R&amp;B chart entry. In 2010, Teena Marie continued to be a headliner on the Las Vegas Strip, appearing regularly at the Las Vegas Hilton and other venues until just before her death.

At the time of her death, Teena Marie had been in the process of completing her album &quot;Beautiful&quot;. It was finished posthumously by her daughter Alia Rose and released on January 15, 2013.

==Personal life==
Teena Marie gave birth to a daughter, Alia Rose, on December 25, 1991, whom she had with a man named Peter Butcher. Alia Rose would grow up following in her mother&#x27;s footsteps, often dueting with Marie during live shows and being featured on some of Marie&#x27;s songs on her last four albums (&quot;La Doña&quot; to &quot;Beautiful&quot;). Alia went under the name Rose LeBeau in the late 2000s. From 2015 and onward, she has since released songs under her original name.

Teena Marie lived in various neighborhoods and cities throughout greater Los Angeles, including Santa Monica, Inglewood, Pasadena, and Marina Del Rey.

Teena Marie was godmother to American actress and comedian Maya Rudolph, daughter of singer-songwriter Minnie Riperton, as well as Marvin Gaye&#x27;s daughter Nona Gaye. She also cared for Rick James&#x27;s son Rick, Jr. and family friend Jeremiah O&#x27;Neal. Lenny Kravitz posted a video in which he said that Teena Marie had taken him into her home and helped him when he was struggling early in his career.

==Death==
In 2004, while Teena Marie was sleeping in a hotel room, a large picture frame fell and struck her on the head. The blow caused a serious concussion that resulted in momentary seizures for the rest of her life.

On the afternoon of December 26, 2010, Teena Marie was found dead by her daughter, Alia Rose, in her Pasadena home. On December 30, 2010, an autopsy was performed by the coroner of Los Angeles County, who found no signs of apparent trauma or a discernible cause of death, and concluded she had died from natural causes. She had suffered a generalized tonic–clonic seizure a month before.
A memorial service for Teena Marie was held at Forest Lawn Cemetery on January 10, 2011. Among those in attendance were Stevie Wonder, Deniece Williams, Smokey Robinson, Queen Latifah, LisaRaye, Sinbad, Tichina Arnold, Shanice, and Berry Gordy.

<text>Filmmaking or film production is the process by which a motion picture is produced. Filmmaking involves a number of complex and discrete stages, beginning with an initial story, idea, or commission. Production then continues through screenwriting, casting, pre-production, shooting, sound recording, post-production, and screening the finished product before an audience, which may result in a film release and exhibition. The process is nonlinear, in that the filmmaker typically shoots the script out of sequence, repeats shots as needed, and puts them together through editing later. Filmmaking occurs in a variety of economic, social, and political contexts around the world, and uses a variety of technologies and cinematic techniques to make theatrical films, episodic films for television and streaming platforms, music videos, and promotional and educational films.

Although filmmaking originally involved the use of film, most film productions are now digital. Today, filmmaking refers to the process of crafting an audio-visual story commercially for distribution or broadcast.

== Production stages ==
Film production consists of five major stages:
* Development: Ideas for the film are created, rights to existing intellectual properties are purchased, etc., and the screenplay is written. Financing for the project is sought and obtained.
* Pre-production: Arrangements and preparations are made for the shoot, such as hiring cast and film crew, selecting locations, and constructing sets. 
* Production: The raw footage and other elements of the film are recorded during the film shoot, including principal photography.
* Post-production: The images, sound, and visual effects of the recorded film are edited and combined into a finished product.
* Distribution: The completed film is distributed, marketed, and screened in cinemas and released on home video to be viewed at home.

=== Development ===
The development stage contains both general and specific components. Each film studio has a yearly retreat where their top creative executives meet and interact on a variety of areas and topics they wish to explore through collaborations with producers and screenwriters, and then ultimately, directors, actors, and actresses. They choose trending topics from the media and real life, as well as many other sources, to determine their yearly agenda. For example, in a year when action is popular, they may wish to explore that topic in one or more movies. Sometimes, they purchase the rights to articles, bestselling novels, plays, the remaking of older films, stories with some basis in real life through a person or event, a video game, fairy tale, comic book, graphic novel. Likewise, research through surveys may inform their decisions. They may have had blockbusters from their previous year and wish to explore a sequel. They will additionally acquire a completed and independently financed and produced film. Such notable examples are &quot;Little Miss Sunshine&quot;, &quot;The English Patient&quot;, and &quot;Roma&quot;.

Studios hold general meetings with producers and screenwriters about original story ideas. &quot;In my decade working as a writer, I knew of only a few that were sold and fewer that made it to the screen,&quot; relays writer Wayne Powers. Alan Watt, writer-director and Founder of The LA Writer&#x27;s Lab confirmed that completed original screenplays, referred to as &quot;specs&quot;, make big news when they sell, but these make up a very small portion of movies that are ultimately given the green light to be produced by the president of a studio.

The executives return from the retreat with fairly well-established instructions. They spread these concepts through the industry community, especially to producers they have deals with (traditional studios will have those producers in offices on their lots). Also, agents for screenwriters are made aware. This results in a pairing of producers with writers, where they develop a &quot;take&quot;, a basic story idea that utilizes the concept given by studio executives. Often it is a competition with several pairings meeting with studio executives and &quot;pitching&quot; their &quot;take&quot;. Very few writing jobs are from original ideas brought to studios by producers or writers. Perhaps one movie a year will be a &quot;spec&quot; script that was purchased.

Once the producer and writer have sold their approach to the desired subject matter, they begin to work. However, many writers and producers usually pass before a particular concept is realized in a way that is awarded a green light to production. Production of &quot;Unforgiven&quot;, which earned Oscars for its Director/Star Clint Eastwood, as well as its screenwriter, David Webb Peoples, required fifteen years. Powers related that &quot;The Italian Job&quot; took approximately eight years from concept to screen, which, as Powers added, &quot;is average.&quot; And most concepts turned into paid screenplays wind up gathering dust on some executive&#x27;s shelf, never to see production.

Writers have different styles and creative processes; some have stronger track records than others. Because of this, how the development process proceeds from there and how much detail a writer returns to the studio to divulge before beginning writing can vary greatly. Screenwriters are often protected by the union, the Writers Guild of America, or WGA. The WGA allows a screenwriter to contract for One Draft, One Revision, and One Polish. Bob Eisle, Writer and Member of the Guild Board, states, &quot;Additional writing requires an extension of contracts and payment for additional work&quot;. They are paid 80% of their fee after the First Draft. Preliminary discussions are minimal with studio executives but might be quite detailed with the producer.

Next, a screenwriter writes a screenplay over a period of several months, or however long it takes. Deadlines are in their contracts but there is no pressure to adhere to them. Again, every writer&#x27;s process and speed vary. The screenwriter may rewrite the script several times to improve dramatization, clarity, structure, characters, dialogue, and overall style.

Script Coverage, a freelance job held by recent university graduates, does not feed scripts into the system that are ready for production nor already produced. &quot;Coverage&quot; is a way for young screenwriters to be read and their ideas might make their way up to an executive or famous producer and result in &quot;meet and greets&quot; where relations with up-and-comers can be formed. But it has not historically yielded ideas studios pursue into production.

The studio is the film distributor who at an early stage attempts to choose a slate of concepts that are likely to have market appeal and find potential financial success. Hollywood distributors consider factors such as the film genre, the target audience and assumed audience, the historical success of similar films, the actors who might appear in the film, and potential directors. All these factors imply a certain appeal of the film to a possible audience. Not all films make a profit from the theatrical release alone, however, the studio mainly targets the opening weekend and the second weekend to make most domestic profits. Occasionally, a film called a &quot;word of mouth film&quot; does not market strongly but its success spreads by word of mouth. It slowly gains its audience. These are special circumstances and these films may remain in theaters for 5 months while a typical film run is closer to 5 weekends. Further earnings result from pay television purchases, foreign market purchases and DVD sales to establish worldwide distribution gross of a film.

Once a screenplay is &quot;green-lit&quot;, directors and actors are attached and the film proceeds into the pre-production stage, although sometimes development and pre-production stages will overlap. Projects which fail to obtain a green light may have protracted difficulties in making the transition to pre-production and enter a phase referred to as development hell for extended period of time or until developmental turnaround.

Analogous to almost any business venture, financing of a film project deals with the study of filmmaking as the management and procurement of investments. It includes the dynamics of assets that are required to fund the filmmaking and liabilities incurred during the filmmaking over the time period from early development through the management of profits and losses after distribution under conditions of different degrees of uncertainty and risk. The practical aspects of filmmaking finance can also be defined as the science of the money management of all phases involved in filmmaking. Film finance aims to price assets based on their risk level and their expected rate of return based upon anticipated profits and protection against losses.

=== Pre-production ===

In pre-production, every step of actually creating the film is carefully designed and planned. This is the phase where one would narrow down all the options of the production. It is where all the planning takes place before the camera rolls and sets the overall vision of the project. The production company is created and a production office established. The film is pre-visualized by the director and may be storyboarded with the help of illustrators and concept artists. A production budget is drawn up to plan expenditures for the film. For major productions, insurance is procured to protect against accidents. Pre-production also includes working out the shoot location and casting process. The Producer hires a Line Manager or a Production Manager to create the schedule and budget for the film.

The nature of the film, and the budget, determine the size and type of crew used during filmmaking. Many Hollywood blockbusters employ a cast and crew of hundreds, while a low-budget, independent film may be made by a &quot;skeleton crew&quot; of eight or nine (or fewer). These are typical crew positions:

* Storyboard artist: creates visual images to help the director and production designer communicate their ideas to the production team.
* Director: is primarily responsible for the storytelling, creative decisions and acting of the film.
** Assistant director (AD): manages the shooting schedule and logistics of the production, among other tasks. There are several types of AD, each with different responsibilities.
* Film producer: hires the film&#x27;s crew.
** Unit production manager: manages the production budget and production schedule. They also report, on behalf of the production office, to the studio executives or financiers of the film.
*** Location manager: finds and manages film locations. Nearly all pictures feature segments that are shot in the controllable environment of a studio sound stage, while outdoor sequences call for filming on location.
* Production designer: the one who creates the visual conception of the film, working with the art director, who manages the art department which makes production sets.
** Costume designer: creates the clothing for the characters in the film working closely with the actors, as well as other departments.
** Makeup and hair designer: works closely with the costume designer in order to create a certain look for a character.
* Casting director: finds actors to fill the parts in the script. This normally requires that actors partake in an audition, either live in front of the casting director or in front of one or more cameras.
** Choreographer: creates and coordinates the movement and dance – typically for musicals. Some films also credit a fight choreographer.
* Director of photography (DOP): the head of the photography of the entire film, supervises all cinematographers and camera operators.
* Production sound mixer: the head of the sound department during the production stage of filmmaking. They record and mix the audio on set – dialogue, presence and sound effects in monaural and ambience in stereo. They work with the boom operator, Director, DA, DP, and First AD.
** Sound designer: creates the aural conception of the film, working with the supervising sound editor. On Bollywood-style Indian productions the sound designer plays the role of a director of audiography.
** Composer: creates new music for the film. (usually not until post-production)

=== Production ===


In production, the film is created and shot. In this phase, it is key to keep planning ahead of the daily shoot. The primary aim is to stick to the budget and schedule, which requires constant vigilance. More crew will be recruited at this stage, such as the property master, script supervisor, assistant directors, stills photographer, picture editor, and sound editors. These are the most common roles in filmmaking; the production office will be free to create any unique blend of roles to suit the various responsibilities needed during the production of a film. Communication is key between the location, set, office, production company, distributors and all other parties involved.

A typical day shooting begins with the crew arriving on the set/location by their call time. Actors usually have their own separate call times. Since set construction, dressing and lighting can take many hours or even days, they are often set up in advance.

The grip, electric and production design crews are typically a step ahead of the camera and sound departments: for efficiency&#x27;s sake, while a scene is being filmed, they are already preparing the next one.

While the crew prepares their equipment, the actors do their costumes and attend the hair and make-up departments. The actors rehearse the script and blocking with the director, and the camera and sound crews rehearse with them and make final tweaks. Finally, the action is shot in as many takes as the director wishes. Most American productions follow a specific procedure:

The assistant director (AD) calls &quot;picture is up!&quot; to inform everyone that a take is about to be recorded, and then &quot;quiet, everyone!&quot; Once everyone is ready to shoot, the AD calls &quot;roll sound&quot; (if the take involves sound), and the production sound mixer will start their equipment, record a verbal slate of the take&#x27;s information, and announce &quot;sound speed&quot;, or just &quot;speed&quot;, when they are ready. The AD follows with &quot;roll camera&quot;, answered by &quot;speed!&quot; by the camera operator once the camera is recording. The clapper loader, who is already in front of the camera with the clapperboard, calls &quot;marker!&quot; and slaps it shut. If the take involves extras or background action, the AD will cue them (&quot;action background!&quot;), and last is the director, telling the actors &quot;action!&quot;. The AD may echo &quot;action&quot; louder on large sets.

A take is over when the director calls &quot;Cut!&quot; and the camera and sound stop recording. The script supervisor will note any continuity issues, and the sound and camera teams log technical notes for the take on their respective report sheets. If the director decides additional takes are required, the whole process repeats. Once satisfied, the crew moves on to the next camera angle or &quot;setup&quot;, until the whole scene is &quot;covered.&quot; When shooting is finished for the scene, the assistant director declares a &quot;wrap&quot; or &quot;moving on&quot;, and the crew will &quot;strike&quot;, or dismantle, the set for that scene.

At the end of the day, the director approves the next day&#x27;s shooting schedule and a daily progress report is sent to the production office. This includes the report sheets from continuity, sound, and camera teams. Call sheets are distributed to the cast and crew to tell them when and where to turn up the next shooting day. Later on, the director, producer, other department heads, and, sometimes, the cast, may gather to watch that day or yesterday&#x27;s footage, called &quot;dailies&quot;, and review their work.

With workdays often lasting fourteen or eighteen hours in remote locations, film production tends to create a team spirit. When the entire film is &quot;in the can&quot;, or in the completion of the production phase, it is customary for the production office to arrange a wrap party, to thank all the cast and crew for their efforts.

For the production phase on live-action films, synchronizing work schedules of key cast and crew members is very important. For many scenes, several cast members and many crew members must be physically present at the same place at the same time (and bankable stars may need to rush from one project to another). Animated films have different workflow at the production phase, in that voice actors can record their takes in the recording studio at different times and may not see one another until the film&#x27;s premiere. Animated films also have different crew, since most physical live-action tasks are either unnecessary or are simulated by various types of animators.

=== Post-production ===

This stage is usually thought of as starting when principal photography ends, but they may overlap. The bulk of post-production consists of the film editor reviewing the footage with the director and assembling the film out of selected takes. The production sound (dialogue) is also edited; music tracks and songs are composed and recorded if a film is intended to have a score; sound effects are designed and recorded. Any computer-generated visual effects are digitally added by an artist. Finally, all sound elements are mixed down into &quot;stems&quot;, which are synchronized to the images on the screen, and the film is fully completed (&quot;locked&quot;).

===Distribution===

Distribution is the last stage, where the film is released in movie theaters or, occasionally, directly to consumer media (VHS, VCD, DVD, Blu-ray) or direct download from a digital media provider. The film is duplicated as required (either onto film or hard disk drives) and distributed in cinemas for exhibition (screening). Press kits, posters, and other advertising materials are published, and the film is advertised and promoted. A B-roll clip may be released to the press based on raw footage shot for a &quot;making of&quot; documentary, which may include making-of clips as well as on-set interviews separate from those of the production company or distributor. For major films, key personnel are often contractually required to participate in promotional tours in which they appear at premieres and festivals and sit for interviews with many TV, print, and online journalists. The largest productions may require more than one promotional tour, in order to rejuvenate audience demand at each release window.

Since the advent of home video in the late 1970s, most major films have followed a pattern of having several distinct release windows. A film may first be released to a few select cinemas, or if it tests well enough, may go directly into wide release. Next, it is released, normally at different times several weeks (or months) apart, into different market segments like rental, retail, pay-per-view, in-flight entertainment, cable television, satellite television, or free-to-air broadcast television. The distribution rights for the film are also usually sold for worldwide distribution. The distributor and the production company share profits and manage losses.

== Independent filmmaking ==
 
Filmmaking also takes place outside of the mainstream and is commonly called independent filmmaking. Since the introduction of DV technology, the means of production have become more democratized and economically viable. Filmmakers can conceivably shoot and edit a film, create and edit the sound and music, and mix the final cut on a home computer. However, while the means of production may be democratized, financing, traditional distribution, and marketing remain difficult to accomplish outside the traditional system. In the past, most independent filmmakers have relied on film festivals (such as Sundance Film Festival, Venice Film Festival, Cannes Film Festival, and Toronto International Film Festivals) to get their films noticed and sold for distribution and production. However, the internet has allowed for the relatively inexpensive distribution of independent films on websites such as YouTube. As a result, several companies have emerged to assist filmmakers in getting independent movies seen and sold via mainstream internet marketplaces, often adjacent to popular Hollywood titles. With internet movie distribution, independent filmmakers who choose to forego a traditional distribution deal now have the ability to reach global audiences.

<doc id="933120" wikidata="Q1232467" url="?curid=933120" title="Lacus Curtius">
<text>The Lacus Curtius (&quot;Lake Curtius&quot;) was a pit or pool in the ground of the Forum Romanum. The area where the Forum would be built was likely once a lake, as the wider area is known to have been surrounded by brooks and marshes. One part was never drained and gradually shrank until only a basin, known as the Lacus Curtius, was left. Its nature and significance in Rome’s early history is uncertain, and several conflicting stories exist about its origin and purpose.

The name of the place is likely connected with the Curtia gens, a very old Roman Family with Sabine origins.

==History==
The exact history of the feature was not well known even to the Romans themselves, and at least three different explanations were given for its name. Two were given by Livy, and another by Varro. By order of when they are said to have taken place:

===Livy&#x27;s Sabine war origin===

According to the oldest story (8th century BCE), the Lacus Curtius was named after a champion of the Sabines, the horseman Mettius Curtius. In the war that followed the Rape of the Sabine Women, he was said to have gotten stuck in the marsh during battle. This is corroborated by the fact that the Forum was once marshland, the fact that the Curtia Gens was of Sabine origin, and that the name &quot;Mettius&quot; was an authentic Sabine one taken from the word &quot;medìss&quot; &quot;leader&quot;.

===Varro&#x27;s lightning origin===
A second version (~445 BCE), and also the most prosaic, says Gaius Curtius Philon, a consul, had consecrated the site after a lightning strike had hit it.

===Livy&#x27;s mythical origin===

The Lacus Curtius may have been regarded with some veneration by ancient Romans. The most popular story (~362 BCE), and also the one Livy deemed most likely, was a myth glorifying the nation: Rome was endangered when a great chasm opened on the Forum. An oracle directed the people to throw into the chasm “that what constituted the greatest strength of the Roman people,” and doing so would make the Roman nation last forever. After dropping various things into the ravine without result, a young horseman named Marcus Curtius (again, of the Curtia gens) saved the city by realizing that it was &quot;virtus&quot; that the Romans held most dear. In full armour on his horse, he jumped into the chasm whereupon the earth closed over him and Rome was saved. The story, though clearly epic in nature, was likely a copy of another very similar Greek story concerning king Midas.

===Other possibilities===
A bit to the east of the Lacus Curtius were found the skeletal remains of a man, woman, and child who had been bound together and drowned. This supports the notion that legends of Mettius and Marcus Curtius are perhaps warped recollections of a very ancient sacrificial drowning ritual done when the feature was still large enough to form a pool. Alternatively, they could have been related to “profaners” mentioned in the inscription on the nearby Lapis Niger, making it a special location of punishment.

The theme is related to high-medieval Celtic stories about lake-bursts.

==In art==

Marcus Curtius&#x27; self-sacrifice has been a popular theme since the Renaissance, depicted by Paolo Veronese, Lucas Cranach the Elder, and many others.

<doc id="933124" wikidata="Q3353450" url="?curid=933124" title="Fakhr al-Din Iraqi">
<text>Fakhr al-Din Iraqi (also spelled Araqi; ; 1213/14 – 1289) was a Persian Sufi poet of the 13th-century. He is principally known for his mixed prose and poetry work, the &quot;Lama&#x27;at&quot; (&quot;Divine flashes&quot;), as well as his &quot;divan&quot; (collection of short poems), most of which were written in the form of a &quot;ghazal&quot;.

Born to a religious and well-read family, during his youth, Iraqi joined a group of &quot;qalandars&quot; (wandering dervishes) in search for spiritual knowledge. They eventually reached Multan in India, where Iraqi later became a disciple of Baha al-Din Zakariyya (died 1262), the leader of the Multani branch of the &quot;Suhrawardiyya&quot;, a Sufi order. After the latter&#x27;s death in 1262, Iraqi briefly became his successor, but was forced to leave due to the envy of his former master&#x27;s son Sadr al-Din Arif and some of his disciples.

Following a pilgrimage to Mecca, Iraqi settled in Konya in Anatolia, where he became acquainted with many figures, such as his new patron, Mu&#x27;in al-Din Parwana (died 1277), an administrator of the Mongol Ilkhanate. Following his patron&#x27;s disgrace and execution in 1277, Iraqi was accused of collaborating with him, and thus forced to flee. After a brief stay at Sinope, Iraqi moved to Cairo for a few years, and then eventually to Damascus, where he died in 1289.

By successfully combining two mystical schools, the Arabic-speaking Sufism of the Andalusian mystic Ibn Arabi (died 1240), and the Persian poetic style of Sufism, Iraqi managed to give his writings rich and expressive imagery, a feat which had a permanent impact on Iranian spirituality.

== Historiography ==
Most of Iraqi&#x27;s life is known through the anonymous &quot;Muqaddima&quot; (&quot;Introduction&quot;) of his &quot;divan&quot; (collection of short poems). Although the &quot;Muqaddima&quot; was written in same style of Iraqi&#x27;s era, the American historian William Chittick argues that it may have been composed as late as the 15th-century. Another historian, Ève Feuillebois, adds that if this hypothesis is correct, the oldest source that mentions Iraqi would be the &quot;Tarikh-i guzida&quot; (&quot;Selected historical events&quot;), composed by the historian and geographer Hamdallah Mustawfi (died after 1339/40) in 1330. Many of the stories in the &quot;Muqaddima&quot; give context for Iraqi&#x27;s &quot;ghazals&quot;, but have little value in terms of historicity. They focus a lot on Iraqi&#x27;s &quot;shahidbazi&quot; (&quot;perhaps excessively&quot; according to Feuillebois), a Sufi custom of staring at young males in order to witness the image of the divine witness.

Later sources rely heavily on the information from the Muqaddima for their biographical details about Iraqi. These sources include the &quot;Nafahat al-uns&quot; (&quot;Breaths of familiarity&quot;) composed between 1476 and 1478 by the poet and hagiographer Jami (died 1492), and the &quot;Habib al-siyar&quot; (&quot;Beloved of the biographies&quot;) by the historian Khvandamir (died 1535/36).

== Biography ==
Of Persian stock, Iraqi was born in 1213/14 in the village of Komjan, close to Hamadan, one of the major cities of Persian Iraq. He was the son of a certain Buzurgmihr ibn Abd al-Ghaffar Jawaliqi, and belonged to a religious and well-read family. By the age of six, Iraqi had reportedly memorized the Quran. He was then educated in religious sciences, and was by the age of seventeen a teacher in a &quot;madrasa&quot; (religious school) in Hamadan. During one time when Iraqi, still at a young age, was teaching &quot;tafsir&quot; (interpretation of the Quran), a group of &quot;qalandars&quot; (wandering dervishes) attended his teaching session. They convinced him to abandon his teachings and join them in search for spiritual knowledge.

They eventually went to the city of Multan in India, where Iraqi met Baha al-Din Zakariyya (died 1262), the leader of the Multani branch of the &quot;Suhrawardiyya&quot;, a Sufi order. Iraqi first became his disciple two years later, after wandering in India. He continued to stay as Baha al-Din&#x27;s disciple for 25 years, eventually marrying the latter&#x27;s daughter and having a son named Kabir al-Din. Following Baha al-Din&#x27;s death in 1262, Iraqi succeeded him as the head of the order. However, he was soon forced to leave Multan due to the envy of Baha al-Din&#x27;s son Sadr al-Din Arif and some of his disciples.

Along with a group of loyal companions, Iraqi made a pilgrimage to Mecca. While they were on their way in Hijaz, the sultan of Oman unsuccessfully attempted to hold Iraqi back. After the pilgrimage, Iraqi went to the city of Konya in Anatolia. There he started studying with Sadr al-Din al-Qunawi (died 1274), the most prominent disciple of the Andalusian mystic Ibn Arabi (died 1240). It was during this period that Iraqi started writing the &quot;Lama&#x27;at&quot; (&quot;Divine flashes&quot;), a book which Sadr al-Din highly admired. Iraqi watched the &quot;sama&quot; (spiritual concert) sessions that the prominent Persian poet Rumi (died 1273) organized. He also reportedly attended Rumi&#x27;s funeral.

Another figure who attended Rumi&#x27;s sessions was Mu&#x27;in al-Din Parwana (died 1277), an administrator of the Mongol Ilkhanate. He became a follower of Iraqi and had a &quot;khanaqah&quot; (Sufi lodge) constructed in Duqat for him and his students. Iraqi also became acquainted with Shams al-Din Juvayni (died 1284), who served as the minister of the Ilkhanate rulers from 1262 to 1284. Following the disgrace and execution of Parwana, Iraqi was accused of having hidden state property for Parwana, and thus forced to flee. With the help of Shams al-Din Juvayni, Iraqi escaped to the city of Sinope, which was ruled by Parwana&#x27;s son Mu&#x27;in al-Din Muhammad, who was known for his support of Sufis. Iraqi then went to the city of Cairo, where he stayed for some years and gained the support of its ruler, the Mamluk sultan Qalawun ().

Along with his son Kabir al-Din, Iraqi later went to the city of Damascus, where he died at the age of 78. He was buried next to Ibn Arabi in the cemetery of the Salihiyya district of Damascus, but nothing of his tomb remains today.

== Works ==
The &quot;divan&quot; of Iraqi is mostly written in the form of &quot;ghazals&quot; and encompasses 4,500 double verses. It includes twenty &quot;qasidas&quot; (eulogies) about religious and mystical material; a commendation of his teachers Baha al-Din Zakariyya and Sadr al-Din al-Qunawi, as well as the Islamic prophet Muhammad (died 632); seven strophic poems regarding mystical philosophy, and around 200 &quot;rubaʿis&quot; (quatrains) regarding love, spirituality, and disruptive Sufism, the latter of which is most likely mostly forgery. 300 mystical/love &quot;ghazals&quot; that were written during his stay in India make up the majority of his poetry. Some of the poems also show influence from philosophy of Ibn Arabi, which demonstrates that they were written after Iraqi met Sadr al-Din al-Qunawi.

Iraqi&#x27;s famous &quot;Lama&#x27;at&quot; 
(لمعات) is mixed prose and poetry and consists of 27, or perhaps 28 chapters, as early texts suggest that one of the chapters is two chapters, similar to Ibn Arabi&#x27;s &quot;Fusus al-Hikam&quot; (&quot;Bezels of wisdom&quot;). Despite the fact that the work is based on Sadr al-Din al-Qunawi&#x27;s understanding of Ibn Arabi&#x27;s works, it is not just a commentary, as it combines Ibn Arabi&#x27;s philosophy with Persian love-mysticism, thus making it comprehensible and welcomed by the Persians. In the introduction of the work, Iraqi says that he was encouraged by the love treatise &quot;Sawanih al-ʿushshaq&quot; (&quot;Auspices of the lovers&quot;) of the prominent Persian mystic, writer, and preacher Ahmad Ghazali (died 1126).

Iraqi has been credited with the writing of the &quot;Istilahat&quot; (&quot;Technical terms&quot;), a short book about Sufi terminology. However, it is in reality a variant of the &quot;Rashf al-alhaz fi kashf al-alfaz&quot; (&quot;Taking in side-glances at the unveiling of technical terms&quot;) by another Sufi, the 14th-century writer Sharaf al-Din Husayn ibn Ulfati Tabrizi.

Iraqi was also originally considered the author of the &quot;Ushshaq-nama&quot; (&quot;Book of lovers&quot;), also known as &quot;Dah-nama&quot; (&quot;The ten [love] letters&quot;), a &quot;masnavi&quot; (poem in rhyming couplets) filled with some &quot;ghazals&quot;. However, the modern historian J. Baldick has argued that it was in reality written roughly thirty years later by one of his admirers, Ata&#x27;i. This suggestion has received support by other historians.

== Legacy and assessment ==
By successfully combining two mystical schools, the Arabic-speaking Sufism of Ibn Arabi, and the Persian poetic style of Sufism, Iraqi managed to give his writings rich and expressive imagery, a feat which had a permanent impact on Iranian spirituality.

Iraqi is highly regarded by scholars on Persian literature, such as Saeed Nafisi (died 1966), who regarded his &quot;bold exposition of love mysteries to be unparalleled in all Persian poetry.&quot;

<text>Ineta Radēviča (born 13 July 1981) is a retired Latvian athlete, competing in the long jump and triple jump.

Radēviča won the bronze medal in the 2003 European U-23 championship. She has also won two NCAA championships, while competing for the University of Nebraska. In the 2004 Summer Olympics, she was 13th in the triple jump and 20th in the long jump. Radēviča became popular after posing nude for Playboy magazine before the 2004 Summer Olympics. She finished fifth at the 2006 IAAF World Indoor Championships and eighth at the 2007 European Athletics Indoor Championships. By the time the 2008 Summer Olympics were held, she was pregnant and missed the competition.

At the 2010 European Championships she won the long jump event with a new Latvian record of 6.92 metres. In 2011, she won the bronze medal at the World Championships in Daegu with a result of 6.76 metres. In 2017 she received a Silver medal when results were updated because of past doping offenses.

At the 2012 Summer Olympics she placed fourth, with Janay DeLoach finishing just one centimeter ahead of her. Afterwards she realised her dream of earning an Olympic medal was not going to happen, and she retired to devote herself to her family, ending her professional career.

In May 2019, following reanalysis of her samples from the 2012 Olympics, which tested positive for oxandrolone metabolites, she was disqualified from the Olympic Games.

Radēviča was coached by Evgeny Ter-Ovanesov.

<doc id="933134" wikidata="Q659109" url="?curid=933134" title="1928 Winter Olympics medal table">
<text>The 1928 Winter Olympics, officially known as the II Olympic Winter Games and commonly known as St. Moritz 1928, were an international multi-sport event held in St. Moritz, Switzerland, from 11 to 19 February 1928. A total of 464 athletes representing 25 National Olympic Committees (NOCs) participated, which included 9 NOCs more than the last and inaugural Winter Games in Paris, France. The 9 NOCs were all first time entrants at the Winter Games: Argentina, Estonia, Germany, Japan, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Mexico, the Netherlands, and Romania. The games featured 14 events in 4 sports in 8 disciplines, with skeleton making its debut appearance. These games were the first Winter Games to be held as a stand-alone event, not in conjunction with a Summer Olympics. It also replaced the Nordic Games, a former international multi-sport event that also focused primarily on winter sports.

Overall, athletes representing 12 NOCs won at least one medal, and 6 NOCs won at least one gold medal. Norway won the most gold medals and the most overall medals, with 6 and 15 respectively. France&#x27;s team won their first Winter Olympic gold medal, with figure skaters Andrée Joly and Pierre Brunet winning gold in the pair skating event. Germany&#x27;s and Czechoslovakia&#x27;s team obtained their first Winter Olympic medals, with the former winning bronze in the five-man bobsleigh event from bobsledders Hans Heß, Sebastian Huber, Hanns Kilian, Valentin Krempl, and Hanns Nägle, and the latter also winning bronze but in the men&#x27;s individual ski jumping event from Rudolf Burkert.

Skier Johan Grøttumsbraaten of Norway and speed skater Clas Thunberg of Finland tied for the most gold medals won for an individual at the games, with two each. Speed skater Bernt Evensen of Norway won the most overall medals for an individual games, winning three medals with one gold, one silver, and one bronze.

Sweden and Norway achieved podium sweeps at the games, with the latter achieving two. The former swept the men&#x27;s 50 kilometre event in cross-country skiing with Per-Erik Hedlund winning the gold, Gustaf Jonsson winning the silver, and Volger Andersson winning the bronze. The latter swept the men&#x27;s 18 kilometre event in cross-country skiing with Grøttumsbråten winning the gold, Ole Hegge winning the silver, and Reidar Ødegaard winning the bronze, and the individual nordic combined event with Grøttumsbråten again winning the gold, Hans Vinjarengen winning the silver, and Jon Snersrud winning the bronze.

==Medals==


The medals used for the 1928 Winter Olympics were minted by Huguenin Frères in Le Locle and were designed by Arnold Hünerwadel. The obverse of the medals featured a design of a female figure skater surrounded with snowflakes. The reverse of the medals featured the Olympic rings, the official name of the games and the host city in French, and an olive branch on the left- and right-handed side.

==Medal table==
The medal table is based on information provided by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and is consistent with IOC conventional sorting in its published medal tables. The table uses the Olympic medal table sorting method. By default, the table is ordered by the number of gold medals the athletes from a nation have won, where a nation is an entity represented by a NOC. The number of silver medals is taken into consideration next and then the number of bronze medals. If teams are still tied, equal ranking is given and they are listed alphabetically by their IOC country code.

In speed skating, two gold medals and three bronze medals with no silver medal were awarded in the men&#x27;s 500 metres event after a tie for first place and a three-way tie for third place. The men&#x27;s 10,000 metres event resulted in having no medals awarded after the finals were cancelled by a referee due to thawing ice. Irving Jaffee of the United States was briefly credited as the champion of the event by the IOC but the decision was overruled by the International Skating Union (ISU) and restored the ruling that there would be no medalists. The United States NOC submitted a protest to the decision by the ISU but was rejected as they had submitted it too late.

<text>The Firm is a 1991 legal thriller by American writer John Grisham. It was his second book and the first that gained wide popularity. In 1993, after selling 1.5 million copies, it was adapted into a film of the same name starring Tom Cruise, Gene Hackman and Jeanne Tripplehorn. Grisham&#x27;s first novel, &quot;A Time to Kill&quot;, came into prominence afterwards due to this novel&#x27;s success.

A sequel novel, &quot;The Exchange&quot;, was published in October 2023.

==Plot==
Mitch McDeere is a graduate of Western Kentucky University with a degree in accounting, who has passed his Certified Public Accountant exam on the first attempt and graduated third in his class at Harvard Law School. Mitch is married to his high-school sweetheart, Abby McDeere, an elementary school teacher who also attended Western Kentucky University. His older brother Ray is imprisoned in Tennessee for manslaughter, and his other brother, Rusty, died in Vietnam. His mother suffers from mental health issues and lives in Florida.

Mitch spurns offers from law firms in New York and Chicago in favor of signing with Bendini, Lambert and Locke, a small tax law firm based in Memphis. He finds the firm&#x27;s offer—a large salary, a lease on a new BMW, and a low-interest mortgage on a house—too generous to resist. Soon after he joins, his new colleagues help him study and pass his bar exam, the first priority for new associates. Mitch is assigned to partner Avery Tolar, the firm&#x27;s &quot;bad boy,&quot; but a highly accomplished attorney.

Two of Mitch&#x27;s colleagues, Marty Kozinski and Joe Hodge, die in a scuba diving accident in the Cayman Islands a few days before he starts at the firm. On his first scheduled day of work, Mitch attends their funerals. Mitch finds the deaths unsettling, but focuses on his goal of becoming the youngest partner in the firm&#x27;s history. During a memorial service at the firm for the two deceased attorneys, Mitch notices plaques commemorating three other attorneys who died while working at the firm. Suspicious, he hires a private investigator, Eddie Lomax, an ex-cellmate of his brother Ray, to investigate the deaths.

Lomax discovers that the other three deceased attorneys died under suspicious circumstances: in a car accident, a hunting accident, and a suicide. While the details of their deaths don&#x27;t add up, nothing concrete was ever proven. Lomax cautions Mitch to be careful. Soon after delivering his report to Mitch, Lomax is murdered. FBI agent Wayne Tarrance confronts Mitch, telling him the FBI is watching the firm.

While Mitch is in Washington, D.C., on business, Tarrance approaches him again, this time alongside FBI Director F. Denton Voyles. The FBI reveals that the firm is a white collar front for the Morolto crime family of Chicago. The firm&#x27;s founder, Anthony Bendini, was the son-in-law of old man Morolto. He founded the firm in 1944, and for almost half a century, the firm has lured young lawyers from humble backgrounds with the promise of prestige and financial security. Although Mitch&#x27;s work so far has been legitimate, the partners and senior associates are deeply immersed in a massive tax fraud and money laundering operation that accounts for as much as 75 percent of the firm&#x27;s business. By the time members of the firm become aware of its true nature, they cannot leave. No lawyer has escaped the firm alive; the five who tried were killed to keep them from talking. Kozinski and Hodge were actually in contact with the FBI at the time of their murders, leading Voyles to take personal charge of the investigation.

Mitch learns that his house, office, and car are bugged. The FBI tells Mitch that in order to get enough evidence to bring down the firm, he must reveal information about his clients. The attorney-client privilege in most U.S. states, including Tennessee, does not apply to situations when a lawyer knows that a crime is taking place. However, if Mitch cooperates, he will have to reveal information about some of his legitimate clients as well, which will all but end his legal career. The FBI warns Mitch that he will almost certainly go to prison if he chooses to ignore them. The firm also ramps up the pressure on Mitch; the firm&#x27;s security chief, DeVasher, suspects he is getting too close to the FBI. Desperate to find a way out and stay alive in the process, Mitch has to make a decision quickly.

Ultimately, Mitch and Abby decide to cooperate with the FBI. He promises to collect enough evidence to bring down the firm in return for $2 million and Ray&#x27;s release from prison. However, they secretly decide to flee after turning over enough evidence to topple the firm, since they do not completely trust the FBI to protect them. 

Working with Lomax&#x27;s secretary and lover, Tammy Hemphill, Mitch obtains several confidential documents from the firm&#x27;s bank records in the Cayman Islands, eventually copying over 10,000 documents detailing over 20 years of illegal transactions. Mitch tells Tarrance that while these documents spell out only a fraction of the firm&#x27;s criminal activities, they contain enough evidence to indict roughly half the firm&#x27;s active members and several retired partners. However, the documents will also provide strong circumstantial evidence that the firm is part and parcel of a criminal conspiracy. This will give the FBI probable cause to obtain a search warrant for the firm&#x27;s building and with it, access to all of the firm&#x27;s dirty files. Mitch is certain those files will provide enough evidence for a massive RICO indictment that will bring down the firm and cripple the Morolto family.

Meanwhile, the firm becomes suspicious of Mitch. Tarry Ross, alias &quot;Alfred,&quot; a top FBI official and close confidant of Voyles who is actually a mole for another crime family, confirms that Mitch is indeed working with the FBI. Once Mitch learns of the leak, he flees to Panama City Beach, Florida with his brother and wife with the Moroltos and FBI chasing them. On the way, he steals $10 million from one of the firm&#x27;s Grand Cayman bank accounts, sending some of the money to his mother and in-laws, depositing some in a Swiss bank account for his use, and leaving the rest for Tammy.

Mitch, Abby and Ray manage to escape to the Cayman Islands with the help of Barry Abanks, a scuba diving business owner from the islands whose son died in the incident which killed Kozinski and Hodge. Armed with Mitch&#x27;s evidence, the FBI indicts 51 present and former members of the Bendini firm, as well as 31 alleged members of the Morolto family, for everything from money laundering to mail fraud. As the book ends, Mitch, Abby and Ray enjoy their newfound wealth in the Cayman Islands.

== Origins ==
Grisham himself had planned to become a tax lawyer before pivoting to trial law.

He told NBC in 2011:My first book was published in 1989, &quot;A Time to Kill&quot;. When it came out, it didn&#x27;t sell. I was very busy then as a lawyer and I told myself, “I’m going to write one more book.” When I was in law school I had a friend who was a top student and this guy was heavily recruited and would go off to visit law firms, and he came back from a trip and he said, “You know, I didn&#x27;t really feel good about that firm. I got the impression that once you joined the firm you never leave, like it&#x27;s owned by the Mafia or something.” Well that was ten years earlier but the idea stuck.Grisham began writing &quot;The Firm&quot; the day after he finished &quot;A Time to Kill&quot;.

When he sent the draft to his agent, bootleg copies were made and the story was shopped around Hollywood without Grisham’s knowledge and purchased by Paramount Pictures for $600,000. The existence of a movie deal drove demand for the book deal and the book was purchased by Doubleday.

==Reception==
The book spent 47 weeks on &quot;The New York Times&quot; Best Seller list and was the No. 1 novel of 1991.

Marilyn Stasio of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that &quot;Mr. Grisham, a criminal defense attorney, writes with such relish about the firm&#x27;s devious legal practices that his novel might be taken as a how-to manual for ambitious tax-law students.&quot;

The success of the novel and the 1993 film led to a 2012 television show set ten years after the events of the original story and ended up running for one season.

==Differences with movie adaptation==

The film based on Grisham&#x27;s book kept the earlier part of the plot, but has a completely different ending. In the film, Mitch makes a deal with the FBI for his brother&#x27;s release along with large sums of money in exchange for information about his firm&#x27;s clients. But rather than betray his oath as a lawyer by turning the confidential files over to the FBI, Mitch finds a devious legal way to keep both the FBI and the Mafia off his back so he can continue to practice as a lawyer though not in Tennessee. Reviewer George Crown noted that &quot;In this case, I have the distinct feeling that the film improved on the book. The book&#x27;s Mitch undergoes a very sudden transformation - plodding lawyer to dashing action hero. Virtually nothing in what had gone before has given us any idea that he had that in him. The film&#x27;s Mitch, conversely, stays very much in character. He was a clever young lawyer to start with, that was why The Firm took him on in the first place - but he just gives them a bit more than they bargained for. His way of getting out of the predicament is the quintessential lawyer&#x27;s way: a very neat, devious (and a bit dubious) legal solution, which only somebody with a good legal mind could have come up with.&quot;

==Sequel==
&quot;The Exchange: After The Firm&quot; features the return of Mitch McDeere as the protagonist. It was released by Doubleday on October 17, 2023.

<text>Royal Air Force Gibraltar or more simply RAF Gibraltar (also formerly known as North Front) is a Royal Air Force station on Gibraltar. No military aircraft are currently stationed there, but RAF and aircraft of other NATO nations will periodically arrive for transient stopovers, exercises, or other temporary duty. Administered by British Forces Gibraltar, the station is a joint civil-military facility that also functions as the Rock&#x27;s civilian airport – Gibraltar Airport, with the civilian airport&#x27;s passenger terminal building and apron facilities located on the north side of the runway while the apron and hangar of RAF Gibraltar are located on the south side of the runway.

A total of 16 personnel were reported assigned to RAF Gibraltar as of 2023.

==History==
===Early history===
A Royal Naval Air Service seaplane base was opened at Gibraltar during the First World War.

The airport was constructed during World War II when Gibraltar was an important naval base for the British. Originally opened in 1939, it was only an emergency airfield for the Royal Navy&#x27;s Fleet Air Arm. However, the runway was later extended by reclaiming some land from the Bay of Gibraltar using rock blasted from the Rock of Gibraltar while carrying out works on military tunnels. This last major extension of the runway allowed larger aircraft to land at Gibraltar. At this time the airfield completely obliterated the former Gibraltar horse racing track.

On 25 September 1939, No. 200 (Coastal) Group RAF was formed as a subordinate formation to HQ RAF Mediterranean in control of No. 202 Squadron RAF. The Group&#x27;s function was the control of Royal Air Force units operating from Gibraltar. In late 1940 the Group was transferred to Coastal Command. Later a joint RN/RAF Area Combined Headquarters was formed which commenced operations in early 1942.

RAF North Front opened in 1942 and RAF New Camp opened around the same time. RAF New Camp was built on reclaimed land in the harbour next to Montagu Bastion and was the site for a slipway and hangar for flying boats and RAF motor launches.

The airfield played a major part in Operation Torch, the Anglo-American invasion of French North Africa (French colonial possessions in Algeria, Tunisia and Morocco) in November 1942.

Following the major reorganization of the Allied air forces at the Casablanca Conference in January 1943, RAF Gibraltar became a major sub-command of the Mediterranean Air Command under Air Chief Marshal Sir Arthur Tedder in February 1943.

Anti-submarine warfare was a major priority of RAF Gibraltar during the later years of the Second World War and some of their aircraft were equipped with special detectors to locate German U-boats in the relatively shallow waters around Gibraltar. United States Navy Fleet Air Wing 15 based at Port Lyautey coordinated its antisubmarine warfare operations with RAF Gibraltar and assigned a ZP-14 Squadron blimp pilot/liaison officer to Gibraltar.

===Post-war===
On 29 May 1945 the Area Combined Headquarters was shut down and most of the personnel sent home. Weather flights from Gibraltar were maintained at the end of the war by No. 520 Squadron RAF flying Halifaxes. This was superseded by a detachment of No. 518 Squadron RAF from Aldergrove, and then by the arrival of No. 224 Squadron RAF. Initially the squadron dispatched a detachment in May 1948, but the whole squadron moved to Gibraltar in August 1951. It was re-equipped with Avro Shackletons. The station officially became &quot;RAF Gibraltar&quot; in 1966.

The RAF camp, now known as Devil&#x27;s Tower Camp, which was increasingly used by the British Army in the 1960s and 1970s, became the home of the Royal Gibraltar Regiment.

By the 1980s RAF Gibraltar was increasingly being used as a Forward Operating Base for middle east operations.

On 4 February 2011, the new RAF headquarters in Gibraltar was officially opened by The Chief of Joint Operations, Air Marshal Sir Stuart Peach.

In 2016 a major runway resurfacing project was completed ensuring both military and civilian flights could continue.

<text>The Community Games, known for sponsorship reasons as the Cairn Community Games, is an Irish independent voluntary organisation and national governing body which seeks to provide opportunities for children and young people to participate in a range of sporting and cultural activities. A number of &#x27;National Festivals&#x27;, undertaken as part of the Community Games, are held over several weekends during the year, usually from May onwards. Children first take part in their area, of which there are over 400, and then progress to county, provincial and ultimately the national finals.

==History==
The Community Games was set up in 1967 by Joseph Connolly. Initially, the event was focused in the Walkinstown area of Dublin – as a way to deal with the problems of the lack of leisure-time activities for young people of the area. The Dublin Community Games finals took place, in Santry, in 1968 and 1969. The event expanded by 1970, and the finals of the inaugural National Community Games involved teams from counties Cork, Kilkenny, Limerick, Louth, Roscommon, Tipperary and Waterford.

For much of the game&#x27;s history, from 1973 until 2008, the national finals were held in Mosney, County Meath. However, from 2009 onwards the games were held at the Athlone Institute of Technology in Athlone, County Westmeath and then in the grounds of the University of Limerick. They have since been in several different venues throughout Ireland such as SETU Carlow, Westport Golf Club, Kilkenny Watershed and Visual Carlow.

Previously known as the &quot;HSE Community Games&quot;, as of 2018 the organisation was sponsored by Aldi. In early 2024, Cairn Homes was announced as the title sponsor for the Community Games.

<doc id="933169" wikidata="Q3347452" url="?curid=933169" title="Bolo knife">
<text>A bolo (, , , , , , , , , ) is a general term for traditional pre-colonial small- to medium-sized single-edged swords or large knives of the Philippines that function both as tools and weapons. Bolos are characterized by a wide curved blade that narrows down to the hilt, and that comes with a pointed or a blunt tip. Bolos are used as tools in the Philippines and are sometimes compared to machetes.

==Description==
Bolos are differentiated from other Filipino swords and bladed implements by their dual use as both tools and weapons. They are characterized by a curved (usually convex) wide blade that narrows towards the hilt, with pointed or blunt tips. There are various types of bolos differing by ethnic group and purpose, ranging from large knives to short swords to specialized agricultural equipment. They had a wide range of use, from hunting to scything grass, opening coconuts, harvesting crops, or clearing dense brush.

Most bolos are cheap and unornamented, with the handle usually made from plain carabao horn or wood. Bolos with finely carved handles with precious materials were used as status symbols of high social rank.

== Common uses ==
The bolo is common in the countryside due to its use as a farming implement. As such, it was used extensively during Spanish colonial rule as a manual alternative to ploughing with a carabao. Normally used for cutting coconuts, it was also a common tool for harvesting narrow row crops found on terraces such as rice, mungbean, soybean, and peanut.

===Use in warfare===
During the American period in the Philippines, Filipino fighters armed with bolos were known as &quot;bolomen&quot;. They were used as auxiliary troops by the Americans during the various battles with Moros, and others. They were often placed in front of riflemen, as beliefs in &quot;anting-anting&quot;. The bolo men were effective in close combat with riflemen using bayonets but were easily defeated if riflemen opened fire on them.

The bolo was adopted by the US Military as the bolo knife. Produced from 1897 to 1918, they remained in service both as a tool for clearing brush and for combat until World War II.

The bolo is also used in Filipino martial arts or Arnis as part of training.

== Design ==
A bolo is characterized by having a native hardwood or animal horn handle (such as from the carabao), a full tang, and a steel blade that both curves and widens, often considerably so, towards its tip. This moves the centre of gravity as far forward as possible, giving the bolo extra momentum for chopping.

So-called &quot;jungle bolos&quot;, intended for combat rather than agricultural work, tend to be longer and less wide at the tip. Bolos for gardening usually have rounded tips.

=== Types ===
The term &quot;bolo&quot; has also expanded to include other traditional blades that primarily or secondarily function as agricultural implements. They include:
*Barong - a leaf-shaped sword or knife favored by the Tausug people.
*Batangas - a single-edged bolo of the Tagalog people that widens at the tip.
*Garab - a sickle used for harvesting rice.
*Guna or Bolo-guna - A weeding knife with a very short, wide, dull blade and a perpendicular blunt end. It is used mainly for digging roots and weeding gardens.
*Iták - a narrow sword used for combat and self-defense in the Tagalog regions. Like the &quot;súndang&quot;, it is also known as the &quot;jungle bolo&quot; or &quot;tip bolo&quot;, and was a popular weapon during the Philippine Revolution and the Philippine Insurrection.
*Haras - a scythe used for cutting tall grass. It is called &quot;Lampas&quot; by people from Mindanao.
*Pinutî - a narrow sword traditionally carried as a personal weapon for combat or self-defense.
*Pirah or Pira - a wide-tipped sword or knife favored by the Yakan people, it is also common in the Sulu Archipelago, Mindanao, and the Visayas.
*Punyál or Gunong - a dagger derivative of the &quot;kalis&quot;. Used as a side-weapon in combat, or to kill and bleed pigs during slaughter. Also known under the more generic term &quot;kutsilyo&quot; (Spanish &quot;cuchillo&quot;, &quot;knife&quot;). 
*Súndang - the most common personal weapon used for combat and self-defense in the Visayas. Also known as the &quot;jungle bolo&quot; or &quot;tip bolo&quot;. It was a popular weapon of choice in the Philippine Revolution against the Spanish Empire and during the subsequent Philippine Insurrection.
**Binangon - A form of súndang used in Western Visayas and Negros Island.

== Historical significance ==
The bolo was the primary weapon used by the Katipunan during the Philippine Revolution. It was also used by some Filipino guerrillas and bolomen during the Philippine–American War.

During World War I, United States Army soldier Henry Johnson gained international fame repelling a German raid in hand-to-hand combat using a bolo.

During World War II, members of the 1st Filipino Regiment and the 81st Division used bolos for close quarters combat, earning them the distinctive title &quot;Moro Bolo Battalion&quot;.

On 7 December 1972, would-be assassin Carlito Dimahilig used a bolo to attack former First Lady Imelda Marcos as she appeared onstage at a live televised awards ceremony. Dimahilig stabbed Marcos in the abdomen several times, and she parried the blows with her arms. He was shot dead by security forces while she was taken to a hospital.

== Symbolism ==
The bolo serves as a symbol for the Katipunan and the Philippine Revolution, particularly the Cry of Pugad Lawin. Several monuments of Andres Bonifacio, as with other notable Katipuneros, depict him holding a bolo in one hand and the Katipunan flag in the other.

== Other uses of the term ==
In the United States Military, the slang term &quot;to bolo&quot; – to fail a test, exam or evaluation, originated from the combined Philippine-American military forces including recognized guerrillas during the Spanish–American War and the Philippine Insurrection; those local soldiers and guerrillas who failed to demonstrate proficiency in marksmanship were issued bolos instead of firearms so as not to waste scarce ammunition. The lowest level of qualification for the Army Marksmanship Qualification Badge (Marksmanship badges (United States)), ‘marksman’, is unofficially known as a ‘bolo’ badge.

In hand-to-hand combat sports, especially boxing, the term &quot;bolo punch&quot; is used to describe an uppercut thrown in a manner mimicking the arcing motion of a bolo while in use.

<text>Archelon is an extinct marine turtle from the Late Cretaceous, and is the largest turtle ever to have been documented, with the biggest specimen measuring from head to tail and in body mass. It is known only from the Pierre Shale and has one species, A. ischyros. In the past, the genus also contained &quot;A. marshii&quot; and &quot;A. copei&quot;, though these have been reassigned to &quot;Protostega&quot; and &quot;Kansastega&quot;, respectively. The genus was named in 1895 by American paleontologist George Reber Wieland based on a skeleton from South Dakota, who placed it into the extinct family Protostegidae. The leatherback sea turtle (&quot;Dermochelys coriacea&quot;) was once thought to be its closest living relative, but now, Protostegidae is thought to be a completely separate lineage from any living sea turtle.

&quot;Archelon&quot; had a leathery carapace instead of the hard shell seen in most sea turtles. The carapace may have featured a row of small ridges, each peaking at in height. It had an especially hooked beak and its jaws were adept at crushing, so it probably ate hard-shelled crustaceans, mollusks, and possibly even sponges, while slowly moving over the seafloor. It also potentially consumed other animals, whilst swimming closer to the surface, like jellyfish, squid, or nautiloids. However, its beak may have been better-adapted for shearing flesh, with fish being another possible prey choice. With its large and strong foreflippers, &quot;Archelon&quot; was likely able to produce powerful strokes necessary for open-ocean travel and, if need be, escape from fellow marine predators. It inhabited the northern Western Interior Seaway, a mild to cool temperate area, dominated by plesiosaurs, hesperornithiform seabirds, and mosasaurs. It may have gone extinct due to the shrinking of the seaway, increased infant mortality rates (in the sea), higher instances of egg and hatchling predation (on land), and a rapidly cooling climate.

==Research history==

The holotype specimen, YPM 3000, was collected from the Late Campanian-age Pierre Shale of South Dakota along the Cheyenne River in Custer County by American paleontologist George Reber Wieland in 1895, and described by him the following year based on a mostly complete skeleton excluding the skull. He named it &quot;Archelon ischyros&quot;, genus name from the Ancient Greek - (-) &#x27;first/early&#x27;, () &#x27;turtle&#x27;, and species name from () &#x27;mighty&#x27; or &#x27;powerful&#x27;. A second specimen, a skull, was discovered in 1897 in the same region.

In 1900, Wieland described a second species, &quot;A. marshii&quot;, from remains collected in 1898 by American paleontologist Othniel Charles Marsh, to whom the species name refers, on the basis that the shell underside (plastron) was thicker and the humeri were straighter. However, in 1909, Wieland reclassified it as &quot;Protostega marshii&quot;. In 1902, a third, mostly complete specimen was collected also along the Cheyenne River. In the same study, &quot;Protostega copei&quot; from Kansas, which was first described by Wieland in 1909 and named in honor of Edward Drinker Cope who first erected the family Protostegidae, was moved to the genus &quot;Archelon&quot; as &quot;A. copei&quot;. In 1998, &quot;A. copei&quot; was moved to the new genus (originally named &quot;Microstega&quot;, but subsequently renamed &quot;Kansastega&quot;) as &quot;K. copei&quot;. In 1992, a fourth and the largest specimen to date, nicknamed &quot;Brigitta&quot;, was discovered in Oglala Lakota County, South Dakota and resides in the Natural History Museum Vienna. In 2002, a fifth specimen, a partial skeleton, was discovered from the Pierre Shale of North Dakota along the Sheyenne River near Cooperstown.

==Description==
The holotype measures from head to tail, with the head measuring , the neck , the thoracic vertebrae , the sacrum , and the tail . The largest specimen, Brigitta, measures around from head to tail and from flipper to flipper, and, in life, weighed around . Skulls of &quot;Archelon&quot; measured at up to .
&quot;Archelon&quot; had a distinctly elongated and narrow head. It had a defined hooked beak which was probably covered in a sheath in life, reminiscent of the beaks of birds of prey. However, in the back, the cutting edge of the beak is dull compared to such animals. Much of the length of the head derives from the elongated premaxillae–which is the front part of the beak in this animal–and maxillae. The jugal bones, the cheek bones, due to the elongate head, do not project as far as they do in other turtles. The nostrils are elongated and rest on the top of the skull, slightly posited forward, and are unusually horizontal compared to sea turtles. The jugal bones (cheekbones) are rounded as opposed to triangular in sea turtles. The articular bone, which formed the jaw joint, was probably heavily encased in cartilage. The jaw probably moved in a hammering motion.
Five neck vertebrae were recovered from the holotype, and it probably had eight in total in life; they are X-shaped, procoelous–concave on the side towards the head and convex on the other–and their thick frame indicates strong neck muscles. Ten thoracic vertebrae were found, increasing in size until the sixth then rapidly decreasing, and they have little connection with the carapace. The three vertebrae of the sacrum are short and flat. It probably had eighteen tail vertebrae; the first eight to ten (probably in the same area as the carapace) had neural arches, whereas the remaining did not. Its tail likely had a wide range of mobility, and the tail is thought to have been able to bend at nearly a 90° angle horizontally.

The humeri in the upper arms are proportionally massive, and the radii and ulnae of the forearms are short and compact, indicating the animal had strong flippers in life. The flippers would have had a spread of between , though most likely the more conservative estimate. Stretch marks on the limb bones indicate fast growth, with similarities to the leatherback sea turtle, the fastest growing turtle known, whose juveniles have an average growth rate of per year.

===Carapace===

The carapace comprises on either side eight neuralia–the plates closest to the midline–and nine pleuralia–the plates that connect the midline to the ribs. The plates of the carapace are mostly uniform in dimensions, with the exception of the two pairs of plates corresponding to the eighth thoracic vertebra which are smaller than the others, and the pygal plate closest to the tail which is larger. &quot;Archelon&quot; has ten pairs of ribs, and, like the leatherback sea turtle but unlike other sea turtles, the first rib does not meet the first pleural. As in sea turtles, the first rib is noticeably shorter than the second, in this case, three quarters of the length. The second to fifth ribs project at a right angle from the midline, and, in the holotype, each measure in length. A rib increases in thickness in the vertical direction distally, as it gets farther from the midline, and the ribs are relatively larger and more well-developed than those of sea turtles. The second to fifth ribs, in the holotype, originate with a thickness of and terminate with around in thickness.

The neuralia and pleuralia form highly irregular and finger-like sutures where they meet, and one plate may have lain over the other plate while the bone was still developing and malleable. The neuralia and pleuralia–the bony portions of the carapace–are particularly thin, and the ribs, especially the first rib, and the shoulder girdle are unusually heavy and may have had to carry extra stress to compensate, a condition seen in ancient ancestral turtles. &quot;Archelon&quot; has osteosclerotic structures, where the bone is dense and heavy, which probably served as ballasts in life similar to the limb bones of whales and other open-ocean animals.

The carapace, in life, probably featured a row of ridges along the midline over the chest region, perhaps totaling in seven ridges, with each ridge peaking at either . In the absence of firmly jointed neck and pleural plates, the skin over the carapace was probably thick, strong, and leathery in order to compensate and properly support the shoulder girdle. This leathery carapace is also seen in the leatherback sea turtle. The spongy makeup is similar to the bones seen in open-ocean going vertebrates such as dolphins or ichthyosaurs, and was probably also an adaptation to reduce overall weight.

===Plastron===

A turtle plastron, its underside, comprises (from head-most to tail-most) the epiplastron, the entoplastron, which is small and wedged in between the former and the hyoplastron; then is the hypoplastron and finally, the xiphiplastron. The plastron, as a whole, is thick, and measures (in a specimen described in 1898) in length. Unlike the carapace, it features striations throughout.

In protostegids, the epiplastron and entoplastron are fused together, forming a single unit called an &quot;entepiplastron&quot; or a &quot;paraplastron.&quot; This entepiplastron is T-shaped, as opposed to the Y-shaped entoplastrons in other turtles. The top edge of the T rounds off, except at the center which features a small projection. The outward side is slightly convex and bends somewhat, away from the body. The two ends of the T flatten out, getting broader and thinner, as they get farther from the center.

A thick, continuous ridge connects the hyoplastron, hypoplastron, and xiphiplastron. The hyoplastron features a large number of spines projecting around the circumference. The hyoplastron is slightly elliptical, and grows thinner as it gets farther from the center, before the spines erupt. The spines grow thick and narrow towards their middle portion. The seven to nine spines projecting towards the head are short and triangular. The six middle spines are long and thin. The last 19 spines are flat. There are no marks indicating contact with the entepiplastron. The hypoplastron is similar to the hyoplastron, except it has more spines, a total of 54. The xiphiplastron is boomerang-shaped, a primitive characteristic in contrast to the straight ones seen in more modern turtles.

==Classification and evolution==

In its original 1896 description, Wieland placed &quot;Archelon&quot; into the family Protostegidae, which included at the time the smaller &quot;Protostega&quot; and &quot;Protosphargis&quot;, the latter being nowadays classified in a position closer to the family Cheloniidae. In 1953, Swiss paleontologist split Protostegidae into two subfamilies: Chelospharginae and Protosteginae; to the former was assigned &quot;Chelosphargis&quot; and &quot;Calcarichelys&quot;, and the latter &quot;Archelon&quot; and &quot;Protostega&quot;. The sister group of &quot;Protostegidae&quot; had, in the past, been considered to be Dermochelyidae, and thus their closest living relative would have been the dermochelyid leatherback sea turtle (&quot;Dermochelys coriacea&quot;). However, phylogenetic studies conclude that protostegids represent a completely separate, basal (ancient) lineage that originated in the Late Jurassic, removing the family from the superfamily &quot;Chelonioidea&quot; (which includes all sea turtles). In this model, &quot;Archelon&quot; does not share a marine ancestor with any sea turtle.

==Paleobiology==

&quot;Archelon&quot; was an obligate carnivore. The thick plastron indicates the animal probably spent a lot of time on the soft, muddy seafloor, likely a slow-moving bottom feeder. According to American paleontologist Samuel Wendell Williston, the jaws were adapted for crushing, implying the turtle ate large mollusks and crustaceans. In 1914, he suggested that the abundant, thin-shelled, bottom-dwelling Cretaceous bivalves–some exceeding in diameter–would have easily been able to sustain &quot;Archelon&quot;. However, these were probably absent in the central Western Interior Seaway by the Early Campanian. Conversely, the beak may have been adapted for shearing flesh. It might have been able to target larger fish and reptiles, as well as, similar to the leatherback sea turtle, soft-bodied creatures such as squid and jellyfish. However, it is possible the sharp beak was used only in combat against other &quot;Archelon&quot;. The nautilus &quot;Eutrephoceras dekayi&quot; was found in great number near an &quot;Archelon&quot; specimen, and may have been a potential food source. &quot;Archelon&quot; may have also occasionally scavenged off the surface water.

&quot;Archelon&quot; probably had weaker arms, and thus less swimming power, than the leatherback sea turtle, and so did not frequent the open ocean as much, preferring shallower, calmer waters. This is indicated by the similarity of the humerus/arm and hand/arm ratios of it and cheloniids, which are known to have poor development of the limbs into flippers and a preference for shallow water. Conversely, the large flipper-to-carapace ratio of protostegids and the similarly large flipper spread, like that of the predatory cheloniid loggerhead sea turtle (&quot;Caretta caretta&quot;), combined with a broad body, indicate they could have pursued active prey, though they probably could not have sustained high speeds. Overall, it may have been a moderately-good swimmer, capable of open-ocean travel.

&quot;Archelon&quot;, like other marine turtles, probably would have had to have come onshore to nest; like other turtles, it probably dug out a hollow in the sand, laid several dozens of eggs, and took no part in child rearing. The right lower flipper of the holotype is missing, and stunted growth of remaining flipper bone indicates this occurred early in life. It may have been the result of attempted predation by a bird while a hatchling and trying to escape to the sea, bitten off by some large predator such as a mosasaur or a &quot;Xiphactinus&quot;, or was crushed off by larger adults while herding on the shore. However, the latter is unlikely as juveniles probably did not frequent the coasts even during breeding season. Brigitta is estimated to have lived to 100 years, and may have died while partially covered in mud brumating–a state of dormancy–on the ocean floor. However, the longstanding belief that marine turtles brumate underwater like freshwater turtles may be incorrect given the high surfacing-frequency needed to prevent drowning.

==Paleoecology==

&quot;Archelon&quot; inhabited the shallow Western Interior Seaway; the muddy, oxygen-depleted seafloor was probably, on average, no more than below the surface, and average water temperature may have been in the Campanian. The Late Cretaceous Dakotas were submerged in the Northern Inland Subprovince, an area characterized by moderate to cool temperatures, with an abundance of plesiosaurs, hesperornithiform seabirds, and mosasaurs, particularly &quot;Platecarpus&quot;. There is no fossil evidence for vertebrate migration between the northern and southern provinces. Though sharks were generally more common in the southern province, several sharks are known from the Pierre Shale, including &quot;Squalus&quot;, &quot;Squalicorax&quot;, &quot;Pseudocorax&quot;, and &quot;Cretolamna&quot;. Other large predatory fish include ichthyodectids such as &quot;Xiphactinus&quot;. The Pierre Shale&#x27;s invertebrate assemblage includes a variety of mollusks, namely ammonites–from the Pierre Shale &quot;Placenticeras placenta&quot;, &quot;Scaphites nodosus&quot;, &quot;Didymoceras&quot;, and &quot;Baculites ovatus&quot;–bivalves–such as the giant &quot;Inoceramus&quot;– the squid-like belemnites, and nautilus.

As the seaway progressively migrated southward, it is possible &quot;Archelon&quot; was unable to migrate with it. The increasing threat of egg or hatchling predation by new marine or mammalian species may have led to the extinction of &quot;Archelon&quot;, and the disappearance of gigantic protostegids seems to have coincided with the increasing size of dermochelyids. Protostegidae is more-or-less absent in Maastrichtian deposits, the latest Cretaceous, and probably died off due to a cooling trend which other turtles were able to survive due to some thermoregulatory capabilities. Average water temperature may have decreased to depending on estimated CO2 levels. However, some Maastrichtian-age Kansas Pierre Shale fossils may have been eroded millions of years ago, and it is possible &quot;Archelon&quot; survived well into the Maastrichtian.

<text>Canadian Forces Base Goose Bay , commonly referred to as CFB Goose Bay, is a Canadian Forces Base located in the municipality of Happy Valley-Goose Bay in the province of Newfoundland and Labrador. It is operated as an air force base by the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF). Its primary RCAF lodger unit is 5 Wing, commonly referred to as 5 Wing Goose Bay.

The airfield at CFB Goose Bay is also used by civilian aircraft, with civilian operations at the base referring to the facility as Goose Bay Airport. The airport is classified as an airport of entry by Nav Canada and is staffed by the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA). CBSA officers at this airport can handle general aviation aircraft only, with no more than 15 passengers.

The mission of 5 Wing is to support the defence of North American airspace, as well as to support the RCAF and allied air forces in training. Two units compose 5 Wing: 444 Combat Support Squadron (flying the CH-146 Griffon) and 5 Wing Air Reserve Flight. CFB Goose Bay also serves as a forward operating location for RCAF CF-18 Hornet aircraft and the base and surrounding area is occasionally used to support units of the Canadian Army during training exercises.

==History==
While the flat and relatively weather-favoured area around North West River had for years been under consideration for an airport for the anticipated North Atlantic air routes, it was not until Eric Fry of the Dominion Geodetic Survey investigated the area on 1July 1941 that the Goose Bay location was selected. Fry beat by three days a similar United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) survey team under Captain Elliott Roosevelt; the American team had first investigated nearby Epinette Point before joining Fry at the sandy plains that would become Goose Bay. These surveys used amphibious aircraft that landed at the Grenfell Mission; from there the teams explored by boat.

Eric Fry recalled: &quot;The airport is actually located on the plateau at the west end of Terrington Basin but it is only five miles inland from the narrows between Goose Bay and Terrington Basin. Having a Gander air base in Newfoundland I suggested we call the Labrador site Goose Bay airport and the suggestion was accepted.&quot;

Under pressure from Britain and the United States the Canadian Air Ministry worked at a record pace, and by November, three 
 gravel runways were ready. The first land aircraft movement was recorded on 9 December 1941. By spring of 1942 the base, now carrying the wartime codename &quot;Alkali&quot;, was bursting with air traffic destined for the United Kingdom. In time, the USAAF and the British Royal Air Force (RAF) each developed sections of the triangular base for their own use, but the airport remained under overall Canadian control despite its location in the Dominion of Newfoundland, not yet a part of Canada. The 99-year lease arrangement with the United Kingdom was not finalized until October 1944.

===Aerodrome===
In approximately 1942 the aerodrome was listed as RCAF Aerodrome – Goose Bay, Labrador at with a variation of 35 degrees west and elevation of . The field was listed as &quot;all hard-surfaced&quot; and had three runways listed as follows:

The northeast side of the facility was built to be a temporary RCAF base, complete with its own hangars and control tower, while the south side of the facility, built for the Americans, was being upgraded with its own aprons, hangars, earth-covered magazines, control tower and infrastructure. The Canadian and American bases were built as an RCAF station and later a United States Air Force base known as Goose AB, housing units of the Strategic Air Command and Aerospace Defense Command. It was later home to permanent detachments of the RAF, Luftwaffe, Aeronautica Militare, and Royal Netherlands Air Force, in addition to temporary deployments from several other NATO countries.

=== Cold War history ===
====1950 – The Rivière-du-Loup Incident====

Goose Air Base was the site of the first US nuclear weapons in Canada, when in 1950 the United States Air Force Strategic Air Command (SAC) stationed 11 model 1561 Fat Man and Mark 4 atomic bombs at the base in the summer, and flew them out in December. While returning to Davis–Monthan Air Force Base with one of the bombs on board, a USAF B-50 heavy bomber encountered engine trouble, had to drop, and conventionally (non-nuclear) detonate, the bomb over the St. Lawrence, contaminating the river with uranium-238.

====1954 – Construction of the Strategic Air Command Weapons Storage Area====
Construction of SAC&#x27;s Weapons Storage Area at Goose Air Base was officially completed in 1954. The area was surrounded by two fences, topped with barbed wire. It was the highest security area in Goose Air Base and comprised
* One guard house
* One administration building
* Three warehouses (base spares #1, base spares #2, supply warehouse)
* Six guard towers
* One plant group building
* Five earth-covered magazines for non-nuclear weapon storage
* Four earth-covered magazines for &quot;pit&quot; storage (constructed with vaults and shelving to store pit &quot;birdcages&quot;)
The design and layout of the Goose Air Base weapons storage area was identical, with only slight modifications for weather and terrain, to the three SAC weapons storage areas in Morocco located at Sidi Slimane Air Base, Ben Guerir Air Base, and Nouasseur Air Base, which were constructed between 1951 and 1952 as overseas operational storage sites.
The last nuclear bomb components that were being stored at the Goose Air Base weapons storage area were removed in June 1971.

====1958 – Construction of the Air Defence Command ammunition storage area====
Construction of the Air Defence Command ammunition storage area at Goose Air Base was completed in 1958. This extension to the SAC weapons storage area was built directly beside the previously constructed area, with a separate entrance. The buildings built within the area were:
* Three storage buildings
* One guardhouse
* One missile assembly building.
The storage was being built to accommodate components of the GAR-11/AIM-26 &quot;Nuclear&quot; Falcon, which is normally stored in pieces, requiring assembly before use.

====1976 – Departure of the USAF Strategic Air Command and closure of Goose AB====
The former U.S. facilities were re-designated CFB Goose Bay (the second time this facility name has been used). The value of the airfield and facilities built and improved by the USAF since 1953 and transferred to Canada were estimated in excess of US$250 million (equivalent to $ billion today). By 1976 all SAC assets had been stood down, and only USAF logistical and transport support remained.

====1980 – Multinational low-level flying training stepped up====
In response to lessons learned from the Vietnam War and the growing sophistication of Soviet anti-aircraft radar and surface-to-air missile technology being deployed in Europe, NATO allies began looking at new doctrines in the 1970s–1980s which mandated low-level flight to evade detection. CFB Goose Bay&#x27;s location in Labrador, with a population of around 30,000 and area of , made it an ideal location for low-level flight training. Labrador&#x27;s sparse settlement and a local topography similar to parts of the Soviet Union, in addition to proximity to European NATO nations caused CFB Goose Bay to grow and become the primary low-level tactical training area for several NATO air forces during the 1980s.

The increased low-level flights by fighter aircraft was not without serious controversy as the Innu Nation protested these operations vociferously, claiming that the noise of aircraft travelling at supersonic speeds in close proximity to the ground was adversely affecting wildlife, namely caribou, and was a nuisance to their way of life on their traditional lands.

During the 1980s–1990s, CFB Goose Bay hosted permanent detachments from the Royal Air Force, Luftwaffe, Royal Netherlands Air Force (RNLAF), and the Aeronautica Militare, in addition to temporary deployments from several other NATO countries. The permanent RNLAF detachment left CFB Goose Bay in the 1990s, although temporary training postings have been held since. Goose Bay was an attractive training facility for these air forces in light of the high population concentration in their countries, as well as numerous laws preventing low-level flying. The bombing range is larger than several European countries.

====1983 – The Space Shuttle &quot;Enterprise&quot; visits====
In 1983, a NASA Boeing 747 transport aircraft carrying the Space Shuttle &quot;Enterprise&quot; landed at CFB Goose Bay to refuel on its way to a European tour where the prototype shuttle was then displayed in France and the United Kingdom. This was the first time that a U.S. Space Shuttle ever &quot;landed&quot; outside the United States.

====1988 – Long-range radar closure====
In 1988, the Pinetree Line radar site (Melville Air Station) adjacent to CFB Goose Bay was closed.

===Post-Cold War history===
====1990 – Gulf War====
Goose Bay experienced a significant increase in traffic volume from USAF Military Airlift Command (MAC) during August 1990 due to Operation Desert Shield and Operation Desert Storm. At one point, MAC flights arrived at an average rate of two per hour; the normal rate was two to three per month. Part of the increase may have been driven by Hurricane Bertha, which occurred at the same time. The USAF deployed additional personnel to the base to assist managing the increased volume. Overall, operations proceeded smoothly as it resembled previous high-volume airlifts like Exercise Reforger.

====1993 – Base Rescue Flight and 444 Combat Support Squadron====
To provide rescue and range support to the jet aircraft operating from Goose Bay, the Canadian Forces provided a Base Rescue Flight consisting of three CH-135 Twin Huey helicopters. In 1993 the Base Rescue Flight was re-badged as 444 Combat Support Squadron and continued to operate the same fleet of three helicopters. In 1996 the CH-135s were replaced with three CH-146 Griffon helicopters.

====2001 – 9/11 Operation Yellow Ribbon====
On 11 September 2001, CFB Goose Bay hosted seven trans-Atlantic commercial airliners which were diverted to land as part of Operation Yellow Ribbon, following the closure of North American airspace as a result of the 9/11 terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center in New York City and the Pentagon in Washington, D.C. It was also the first Canadian airport to receive diverted aircraft.

====2005 – Cessation of Multinational Low Level Flying Training====
In 2004 the RAF announced its intent to close the permanent RAF detachment, effective 31 March 2005. The German and Italian air forces had agreements signed to use the base until 2006, however they were not renewed as of 2004. These air forces still operate at Goose Bay, but plan to initiate simulator training instead. The base continues in its role as a low-level tactical training facility and as a forward deployment location for the RCAF, although the total complement of Canadian Forces personnel numbers less than 100.

====2005 – Ballistic missile defence====
Labradorian politicians such as former Liberal Senator Bill Rompkey have advocated using CFB Goose Bay as a site for a missile defence radar system being developed by the United States Department of Defense. Executives from defence contractor Raytheon have surveyed CFB Goose Bay as a suitable location for deploying such a radar installation.

==Airlines and destinations==
Civilian flights use a smaller terminal structure located on Zweibrucken Crescent. A new terminal structure was being built in 2012 to accommodate civilian use. The terminal has a single retail tenant, Flightline Café and Gifts with a Robin&#x27;s Donuts shop.

An increasing number of airliners (especially mid-range aircraft like the Boeing 757) have resorted to using Goose Bay for unplanned fuel stops, especially common for trans-Atlantic flights impacted by a seasonally strong jet stream over the North Atlantic. The majority of civilian airliners using the airfield are not regularly scheduled airlines to this location.

Helicopter charters are operated by CHC Helicopter, Cougar Helicopters and Universal Helicopters.

Air Labrador was a tenant of the airport until the airline ceased operations in 2017 when it was merged with Innu Mikun Airlines as Air Borealis. It flew mainly from Goose Bay to remote communities in Newfoundland and Labrador and Quebec.

===Historical airline service===

In 1950, Trans-Canada Air Lines (TCA) was operating round trip transatlantic service via a stop at the airport with a routing of Montreal Dorval - Goose Bay - Glasgow Prestwick - London Airport flown with Canadair North Star aircraft which was a Canadian manufactured version of the Douglas DC-4. By 1962, Trans-Canada was serving Goose Bay with nonstop flights twice a week from Montreal Dorval operated with Vickers Vanguard turboprop aircraft. In 1981, Eastern Provincial Airways was the only airline serving Goose Bay with nonstop Boeing 737-200 jet service from Churchill Falls, Deer Lake, Halifax, Montreal Dorval, St. John&#x27;s, Stephenville and Wabush although none of these flights were operated on a daily basis. By 1989, Canadian Airlines International was operating nonstop Boeing 737-200 jet service to Montreal Dorval four days a week. On January 23, 2021 Air Canada Express ended service from the airport to Halifax because of reduced demand due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Service returned on April 30, 2022.

== Units, squadrons and formations ==
The principal components of CFB Goose Bay are:
* 444 Combat Support Squadron
* 5 Wing Air Reserve Flight
* Forward Operating Location Goose Bay

== Fixed-base operators ==
The following fixed-base operators (FBOs) are based at CFB Goose Bay:
*PAL Airlines
*Canadian Helicopters
*Universal Helicopters

==Contamination==

The heavy contamination of the site and surrounding area is the result of decades of military operations. For many years waste material was disposed of on-site . The contamination is mostly due to the waste dumps and substance leaks from storage tanks, pipelines, and equipment. As a result, both the soil and groundwater of the site have been contaminated with polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, heavy metals, and polychlorinated biphenyls, among other hazardous substances. In addition, in 2014 it was estimated that there were over 1 million litres of undissolved petroleum before cleanup began. The contamination is spread over more than 100 individual sites on the base. Over time the contamination has spread from the base itself onto neighbouring private and provincially-owned land. In 2004 the groundwater pollution of the surrounding area had progressed to an extent that the Department of National Defence warned local farmers to avoid using wellwater until further testing was done.

===Remediation===
Work started on remediation in 2009 and is slated to be finished in 2028. As of 2022, the federal government has spent $142.9 million on remediating the site. One of the dumps has been transformed into an engineered wetland as part of the efforts to filter out contaminants from the water. In addition, over 46,000 m3 of contaminated soil has been cleaned and returned to the site. Over 700,000 litres of hydrocarbons have been recuperated and over 5 million litres of contaminated groundwater have been treated.

A number of different technologies have been employed in the site clean-up, such as dual phase vacuum extraction.

<doc id="933188" wikidata="Q4040754" url="?curid=933188" title="Hope (programming language)">
<text>Hope is a programming language based on functional programming developed in the 1970s at the University of Edinburgh.
It predates Miranda and Haskell and is contemporaneous with ML, also developed at the University. Hope was derived from NPL, a simple functional language developed by Rod Burstall and John Darlington in their work on program transformation. NPL and Hope are notable for being the first languages with call-by-pattern evaluation and algebraic data types.

Hope was named for Sir Thomas Hope (c. 1681–1771), a Scottish agriculture reformer, after whom &quot;Hope Park Square&quot; in Edinburgh, the location of the artificial intelligence department at the time of the development of Hope, was also named.

The first implementation of Hope used strict evaluation, but there have since been lazy evaluation versions and strict versions with lazy constructors. A successor language Hope+, developed jointly between Imperial College and International Computers Limited, added annotations to dictate either strict or lazy evaluation.

==Language details==
A factorial program in Hope is:
 dec fact : num -&gt; num;
 --- fact 0 &lt;= 1;
 --- fact n &lt;= n*fact(n-1);

Changing the order of clauses does not change the meaning of the program, because Hope&#x27;s pattern matching always favors more specific patterns over less specific ones. Explicit declarations of data types in Hope are required; there is no type inference algorithm.

Hope provides two built-in data structures: tuples and lists.

==Implementations==
Roger Bailey&#x27;s Hope tutorial in the August 1985 issue of &quot;Byte&quot; references an interpreter for IBM PC DOS 2.0. British Telecom embarked on a project with Imperial College London to implement a version of Hope. The first release was coded by Thanos Vassilakis in 1986. Further releases were coded by Mark Tasng of British Telecom.

<doc id="933193" wikidata="Q589655" url="?curid=933193" title="Neo-expressionism">
<text>Neo-expressionism is a style of late modernist or early-postmodern painting and sculpture that emerged in the late 1970s. Neo-expressionists were sometimes called &quot;Transavantgarde&quot;, &quot;Junge Wilde&quot; or &quot;Neue Wilden&quot; (&#x27;The new wild ones&#x27;; &#x27;New Fauves&#x27; would better meet the meaning of the term). It is characterized by intense subjectivity and rough handling of materials.

Neo-expressionism developed as a reaction against conceptual art and minimal art of the 1970s. Neo-expressionists returned to portraying recognizable objects, such as the human body (although sometimes in an abstract manner), in a rough and violently emotional way, often using vivid colors. It was overtly inspired by German Expressionist painters, such as Emil Nolde, Max Beckmann, George Grosz, Ernst Ludwig Kirchner, James Ensor and Edvard Munch. It is also related to American lyrical abstraction painting of the 1960s and 1970s, the Hairy Who movement in Chicago, the Bay Area Figurative School of the 1950s and 1960s, the continuation of abstract expressionism, precedents in Pop Painting, and New Image Painting: a vague late 1970s term applied to painters who employed a strident figurative style with cartoon-like imagery and abrasive handling owing something to neo-expressionism. The New Image Painting term was given currency by a 1978 exhibition entitled &quot;New Image Painting&quot; held at the Whitney Museum.

==Critical reception==
Neo-expressionism dominated the art market until the mid-1980s. The style emerged internationally and was viewed by many critics, such as Achille Bonito Oliva and Donald Kuspit, as a revival of traditional themes of self-expression in European art after decades of American dominance. The social and economic value of the movement was hotly debated. From the point of view of the history of Modern Art, art critic Robert Hughes dismissed neo-expressionist painting as retrograde, as a failure of radical imagination, and as a lamentable capitulation to the art market.

Critics such as Benjamin Buchloh, Hal Foster, Craig Owens, and Mira Schor were highly critical of its relation to the marketability of painting on the rapidly expanding art market, celebrity, the backlash against feminism, anti-intellectualism, and a return to mythic subjects and individualist methods they deemed outmoded. Women were notoriously marginalized in the movement, and painters such as Elizabeth Murray and Maria Lassnig were omitted from many of its key exhibitions, most notoriously the 1981 &quot;New Spirit in Painting&quot; exhibition in London which included 38 male painters but no female painters.

==Neo-expressionism around the world==

The movement became known as Transavanguardia in Italy and Neue Wilden in Germany, and the group Figuration Libre was formed in France in 1981. In Toronto, the group known as ChromaZone/Chromatique Collective was formed in 1981 and existed till 1986.

<text>The AVGP (Armoured Vehicle General Purpose), later known as the LAV I, is a series of three amphibious armoured fighting vehicles ordered by the Canadian military in the 1970s. The vehicles, named Grizzly, Cougar and Husky respectively, were based on the six-wheeled version of the Swiss Mowag Piranha I, and became the first generation Light Armoured Vehicle produced by General Motors Diesel (later General Dynamics Land Systems – Canada).

The AVGP program led to the development of the 8×8 LAV II, variants of which were adopted as direct replacements for the AVGP. These were the Bison and Coyote Reconnaissance Vehicle, which replaced the Grizzly and Cougar respectively.

The Canadian Army retired all AVGP variants beginning in 2005; however, a number of the retired vehicles were transferred to other militaries and police forces, where they continue in use.

==History==
===Canada===

In 1974 the Canadian military launched an acquisition program to procure a light vehicle for the Army reserves. The Army desired a flexible vehicle that could be adapted to serve in many different styles of conflict. The military drafted requirements for four different variants. Cadillac-Gage seemed primed to win this contract. The Swiss firm Mowag pitched its Piranha. Mowag partnered with General Motors Diesel to manufacture the AVGP at GM&#x27;s plant in London, Ontario. In March 1976, the Piranha was selected.

The AVGP variants were introduced into Canadian service in the late 1970s.

The AVGP had propellers and trim vanes for amphibious use, like the eight-wheeled Bison, which was the vehicle family&#x27;s immediate successor.

The Cougar was used for training in Canada as a reconnaissance vehicle. During the 1980s and 1990s, it was used by armoured units as a fire support vehicle, for those units not equipped with the Leopard tank.

The Grizzly was used as an armoured personnel carrier in regular force infantry battalions not equipped with the M113 APC, and also by reserve units. The majority of vehicles had their marine propulsion systems removed. Under the Wheeled LAV Life Extension project, the Canadian Forces planned to convert Grizzly and Husky vehicles to support variants, such as Command Post and Mobile Repair Team Vehicle. However, the project was cancelled in 2005, and the vehicles retired.

The AVGP was passed on to several United Nations missions, including UNPROFOR and the mission to Somalia. One Grizzly was captured by Serb forces in the late 1990s, where it was present on a peace keeping mission.

In May 2007, the Edmonton Police Service accepted the donation of a disarmed Grizzly from the Canadian Army. In 2020 it was retired and replaced with the Quebec-made Camblie BlackWolf based on the Ford F-550.

In March 2010, the Canadian Army donated two disarmed Cougar AVGPs to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police in British Columbia for use by the Emergency Response Team. They were retrofitted to transport ERT assault teams into hazardous areas where transport in unarmoured vehicles would not be safe.

In April 2013, the department of National Defence donated a Cougar AVGP to the Windsor Police Service in Windsor, Ontario and another to the New Glasgow Regional Police in Nova Scotia. The New Glasgow Regional Police ended use of the AVGP in 2017 with plans to donate it to another Police Service, citing difficulty in driving and lack of regular use. In 2020 the Windsor Police replaced their AVGP with the Ontario built Terradyne Armored Vehicles Gurkha based on the Ford F-550.

===Use in Africa===
In June 2005, the Canadian government announced plans to loan 105 AVGPs (100 Grizzlys and 5 Huskys) to African peacekeepers in the Darfur region of Sudan. The AVGP was considered sufficiently modern to be useful in this low-intensity conflict. Canada planned to arrange for civilian contractors to maintain these vehicles. As the vehicles contained some U.S.-manufactured or licensed parts, U.S. permission would be required to loan the vehicles. Initially, the vehicles were to be shipped without their Cadillac-Gage turrets. The vehicles arrived in Senegal in the late summer of 2005.

The Sudanese government required various kinds of assurances before they would allow peacekeepers to use the vehicles in Sudan. On November 18, 2005, the vehicles started arriving in Sudan, in white livery, with their turrets. The loan of vehicles for peace-keeping service in Sudan was originally for one year.

However, the loan was extended, and transferred from the African Union to the United Nations. According to Amnesty International, the soldiers who used the loaned vehicles served in Sudan for too short a term to be properly trained and become experienced. One of the vehicles was destroyed by a rocket-propelled grenade. A second vehicle was damaged when it rammed a more heavily armed, but unarmoured Technical vehicle.

===Uruguay===

In 2008, the Uruguayan Army bought 44 surplus Cougars from the Canadian Army. They were rebuilt without the turret by the Chilean MOWAG-Piranha builder FAMAE, as they will act as armoured personnel carriers for the UN deployment in the Republic of Congo (MONUC), and domestically.

In 2009, Uruguay bought 98 Grizzlys and 5 Huskys that were on loan with the AMIS/UNAMID mission in Darfur. It was reported that FAMAE was contracted in 2011 to modernize the vehicles by installing new engines and gearboxes, as well as performing preventive maintenance.

==Variants==
Variants of the 491 AVGP manufactured are:

===Cougar (195)===
* Used as a tank trainer, reconnaissance and fire support vehicle
* Three-man crew
* Turret of a British FV101 Scorpion reconnaissance vehicle (76mm main gun)

===Grizzly (274)===
* Armoured personnel carrier (APC)
* Three-man crew
* Designed to carry a section of infantry
* Mounting a Cadillac-Gage 1 metre turret, armed with a .50 BMG and a 7.62 mm machine gun

===Husky (31)===
* Armoured recovery vehicle (ARV)
* Two-man crew
* Designed to provide mechanical support for the other two vehicles

==Operators==

===Historical operators===
* (Canadian Army) – AVGPs were used by Regular and Reserve units, the Cougar in armoured regiments and the Grizzly in mechanized infantry battalions.
** The Edmonton Police Service received one disarmed Grizzly in 2007. They replaced it in 2020 with a Cambli BlackWolf Armored Vehicle. 
** The New Glasgow Regional Police received one disarmed Grizzly in 2013, but ended use around 2017 with plans to donate it to another Police Service. 
** The Windsor Police Service received one disarmed Cougar in 2013 and replaced it in 2020 with a Terradyne Armored Vehicles Gurkha. 
* – at least one Canadian Grizzly serving in the former Yugoslavia was captured by Serbian forces and had been photographed in the service of &quot;Jedinica za Specijalne Operacije&quot; (JSO, Unit for Special Operations) or &quot;Crvene Beretke&quot; (Red Berets), a unit of the Serbian police.

===Current operators===
* – (Royal Canadian Mounted Police) – as the Tav 2 variant (Cougars modified for ERT tasks), these were given for free by the Canadian Army to the RCMP in British Columbia in March 2010.
* – 44 refurbished Cougars with turrets removed. 98 Grizzlys and 5 Huskys given directly from the AMIS/UNAMID mission in Sudan.

===Others===
* African Union (AMIS mission) – 100 (−1 lost in combat) Grizzlys, 5 Huskys

<doc id="933220" wikidata="Q639717" url="?curid=933220" title="Trautonium">
<text>The Trautonium is an electronic synthesizer invented in 1930 by Friedrich Trautwein in Berlin at the Musikhochschule&#x27;s music and radio lab, the Rundfunkversuchstelle. Soon afterward Oskar Sala joined him, continuing development until Sala&#x27;s death in 2002.

== Description ==
Instead of a keyboard, its manual is made of a resistor wire over a metal plate, which is pressed to create a sound. Expressive playing was possible with this wire by gliding on it, creating vibrato with small movements. Volume was controlled by the pressure of the finger on the wire and board. The first Trautoniums were marketed by Telefunken from 1933 until 1935 (200 were made).

The sounds were at first produced by neon-tube relaxation oscillators
 (later, thyratrons, then transistors), which produced sawtooth-like waveforms. The pitch was determined by the position at which the performer pressed the resistive wire into contact with the plate beneath it which effectively changed its length, with suitable technique allowing vibrato, quarter tones, and portamento. The oscillator output was fed into two parallel resonant filter circuits. A foot pedal controlled the volume ratio of the output of the two filters, which was sent to an amplifier.

On 20 June 1930 Oskar Sala and Paul Hindemith gave a public performance at the Berliner Musikhochschule Hall called &quot;Neue Musik Berlin 1930&quot; to introduce the Trautonium. Later, Oskar Sala toured Germany with the Trautonium; in 1931 he was the soloist in a performance of Hindemith&#x27;s Concerto for Trautonium with String Quartet. He also soloed in the debut of Hindemith&#x27;s student Harald Genzmer&#x27;s Concerto for Trautonium and Orchestra.

Paul Hindemith wrote several short trios for three Trautoniums with three different tunings: bass, middle, and high voice. His student Harald Genzmer wrote two concertos with orchestra, one for the monophonic Trautonium and, later, one for Oskar Sala&#x27;s Mixtur-Trautonium. One of the first additions of Sala was to add a switch for changing the static tuning. Later he added a noise generator and an envelope generator (so called &#x27;Schlagwerk&#x27;), formant filter (several bandpass filters) and the subharmonic oscillators. These oscillators generate a main pitch and several subharmonics, which are not multiples of the fundamental tone, but fractions of it. For either of the (now two) manuals, four of these waves can be mixed and the player can switch through these predefined settings. Thus, it was called the Mixtur-Trautonium. Oskar Sala composed music for industrial films, but the most famous was the bird noises for Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s &quot;The Birds&quot;. The Trautonium was also used in the Dresden première of Richard Strauss&#x27;s Japanese Festival Music in 1942 for emulating the gongs- and bells-parts and in the 1950s in Bayreuth for the Monsalvat bells in Wagner&#x27;s Parsifal.

== Manufacturers ==
The German manufacturer Doepfer sells some devices for the commercial market to allow for Trautonium-like synthesizer control.

The German manufacturer Trautoniks sells custom made Trautoniums.

==Present Trautonium performers==
Oskar Sala developed the Trautonium further and worked with at least one pupil, music therapy pioneer Maria Schüppel. However, Peter Pichler, a Munich musician and artist, had heard the sound of the Trautonium when he was a young man and was fascinated by its emotional impact and dynamic range. Pichler found he could not forget the unique sound; he searched obsessively for anyone who could help him understand the instrument and he finally tracked down Sala. In 1996 the two met in Sala&#x27;s studio in Berlin, and the result was the preservation of much of Sala&#x27;s knowledge.

Pichler was transformed by the experience but he had to wait fifteen years before he could afford to commission his own Mixturtrautonium from the company Trautoniks.
He wrote a musical theater piece about the fathers of the Trautonium, &quot;Wiedersehen in Trautonien&quot;, which was performed at the German Museum in Munich, for the 100th birthday of Oskar Sala in 2010. For this theater piece, Pichler commissioned three &quot;Volkstrautonien&quot; (a smaller version of the instrument), one of which was bought by the German Museum later for its permanent collection. Pichler is still cooperating closely with the German Museum in Munich that is administering Sala&#x27;s estate.

Since then, Pichler has been making regular appearances with the Mixturtrautonium in various musical genres. The classical music composed for this instrument by Paul Hindemith, Harald Genzmer and Oskar Sala, for instance, is extremely challenging for even an experienced musician to play.

Pichler is one of the very few musicians in the world who has mastered this instrument and is also composing for it.

Daniel Matz plays trautonium on the Agnes Obel albums, &quot;Citizen of Glass&quot; and &quot;Late Night Tales&quot;.

The Dutch performer LudoWic [Thijs Lodewijk] also plays the Trautonium and is one of the few people that owns and plays a Mixtur Trautonium.

<doc id="933236" wikidata="Q612226" url="?curid=933236" title="Polo at the 1908 Summer Olympics">
<text>At the 1908 Summer Olympics, a polo tournament was contested. It was the second time the sport had been featured at the Olympics, with 1900 being its first appearance. The venue was the Hurlingham Polo Grounds in London. The Hurlingham Club presented a Challenge Cup to the winner of the tournament, which consisted of three teams. All three teams represented the British Olympic Association, with two from England and one from Ireland. The two English teams played each first, with the winner playing against the Irish team. Roehampton won both games, taking the gold medal, while the other two teams did not face each other to break the tie for second place.

==Background==

This was the second time that polo was played at the Olympics; the sport had previously appeared in 1900 and would appear again in 1920, 1924, and 1936. Each time, the tournament was for men only.

No nations made their debut in polo in 1908, as Great Britain was the only nation represented and was making its second appearance.

==Competition format==

Only two games were played. The winner of the first game played the team that had a bye. Games were played in six periods of ten minutes each.

==Medal table==

==Medal summary==

==Team rosters==
===Hurlingham===

* Walter Buckmaster
* Frederick Freake
* Walter Jones
* John Wodehouse

===Ireland===

* John Hardress Lloyd
* John Paul McCann
* Percy O&#x27;Reilly
* Auston Rotherham

===Roehampton===

* Charles Darley Miller
* George Arthur Miller
* Patteson Womersley Nickalls
* Herbert Haydon Wilson

==Results==
===Game 1===

Hurlingham scored first, with a goal in the second period by Jones. It would be the only goal scored by the team, however, as Roehampton answered with two goals in the third and added another in the fifth.

===Game 2===

The second game was decidedly more lopsided than the first, with Roehampton scoring twice in the first period and Miller adding three more himself in the second. Ireland scored its only goal shortly before the end of the match, when the team was already down 8-0.

<doc id="933237" wikidata="Q3640749" url="?curid=933237" title="Black Racer (DC Comics)">
<text>The Black Racer is a character, a deity and avatar of Death in the DC Comics universe who often hunts those affiliated with the New Gods. The character first appears in &quot;New Gods&quot; #3 (July 1971) and was created by Jack Kirby.

==Fictional character biography==
The Black Racer&#x27;s corporeal form is Sgt. Willie Walker, who was paralyzed during the Vietnam War. Walker was contacted by the Source when Darkseid first brought the war of the gods to Earth, and told it was his responsibility to take on the role.
The Racer makes use of what appear to be skis as his means of transport, much like how the Silver Surfer, another Kirby creation, uses a surfboard. New Gods are collected by the Racer at the moment of their deaths, and taken to Hadis (the Fourth World version of Hades).

According to &quot;Captain Atom&quot; #42, the Black Racer represents &quot;death as inevitability&quot;, whereas Death of the Endless represents &quot;death as compassionate release&quot;. Nekron, meanwhile, represents &quot;Death as the ultimate opponent&quot;. This has been contested by Neil Gaiman, who says that Death of the Endless is the ultimate incarnation of death in the DC Universe.

During the &quot;Our Worlds at War&quot; crossover, he came to harvest Steel&#x27;s soul, but Superman talked him out of it. Young Justice came across him while he was moving Steel to Apokolips and pursued him by initiative of Lobo and Superboy, even if Robin disagreed. In the &quot;Darkseid vs. Galactus&quot; crossover, Silver Surfer delays the Racer when it came to claim Orion, giving Orion&#x27;s Mother Box time to heal his injuries.

===Seven Soldiers===
In &quot;Seven Soldiers: Mister Miracle&quot;, the Black Racer has a bet with Metron as to whether Mister Miracle will be successful in saving the New Gods following the destruction of Apokolips and New Genesis. The Racer&#x27;s original form makes brief appearances to test Shilo Norman&#x27;s skills. Willie Walker is later killed by Infinity-Man in &quot;Death of the New Gods&quot; mini-series.

===Final Crisis===

The Black Racer makes an appearance in #1, present at the death of Orion. As with the other New Gods, his appearance has been redesigned; he now wears a sleeker armor only faintly resembling his classic appearance (his skis now appear to be highly stylized boots), and his poles appear much like scythes. The &quot;Final Crisis Sketchbook&quot; states that J.G. Jones and Grant Morrison decided to play up the Black Knight aspect of the character in this new design.

The Black Racer also appears at the end of #2, pursuing Barry Allen/Flash and the God-bullet that has been fired backwards through time. In issue #6, Wally West suggests that the Black Racer and the Black Flash are one and the same; in &quot;The Flash: Rebirth&quot; #2 this idea is mentioned once again. In issue #7, Barry and Wally, chased by the Black Racer, bring him to a mortally wounded Darkseid, who he takes in their place.

===The New 52===
The Black Racer makes his first appearance after the Flashpoint reboot in the &quot;Darkseid War&quot; storyline, where the Anti-Monitor fuses him with the Flash and forces him to kill Darkseid. However, the two are ultimately separated, with the Racer killing Volthoom and freeing Jessica Cruz from his influence before vanishing.

==Powers and abilities==
The Black Racer has the power to phase through solid objects and bring death to those he has chosen with a single touch. He travels through the air by means of two cosmically powered celestial skis, which can accelerate to the speed of light. His ski poles can also phase through solid matter to deliver the Black Racer&#x27;s death touch. As a deity, he is also immortal, and wears a cosmic armor that give him super strength and endurance. When he has finished delivering his message of death, the Black Racer returns to the comatose life of Sgt. Willie Walker until he is summoned anew.

<doc id="933247" wikidata="Q3866219" url="?curid=933247" title="Motherland (Natalie Merchant album)">
<text>Motherland is the third solo album by Natalie Merchant, released in 2001. It was her last studio album released on Elektra Records.

The album is musically eclectic, varying from Middle Eastern violin–reggae beat fusion &quot;This House Is on Fire&quot; to 10,000 Maniacs-sounding &quot;Tell Yourself&quot;. Folky &quot;Motherland&quot; precedes stylistically Merchant&#x27;s next album, &quot;The House Carpenter&#x27;s Daughter&quot;.

Originally, &quot;The End&quot; was supposed to appear on the album instead of &quot;Not In This Life.&quot; Merchant noted that:
I&#x27;d take out one song, &#x27;Not in This Life,&#x27; &quot; she said, referring to a midtempo meditation on love, &quot;because it seems frivolous to me now. And I&#x27;d put back a song called &#x27;The End,&#x27; which probably would have gotten me in trouble. Part of the lyric goes: &#x27;That&#x27;ll be the end of war/ the end of the law of Bible, of Koran, Torah.&#x27; I really wanted to put it on the record, but I felt there was so much serious material already that I chose something lighter, for balance.
The album is dedicated to the victims of September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks upon the United States. However, the recording was finished two days before the event, so the songs are not influenced by it. The event has still affected people&#x27;s interpretations of the lyrics. Additionally, the cover was changed at the last minute to accommodate the post-9/11 world.
Her original concept for the photograph on the album cover was a picture of children in a field wearing oxygen masks: 
We shot these kids in upstate New York on Sept 10. And then we were going to reshoot on the 11th. Of course we canceled the session. The day I brought the pictures into the city, there were articles on the run here for Cipro and gas masks. I was getting pressure, anyway, from the record label, friends even, that the image was too controversial. So finally I gave in.

A photograph of a demure-looking Ms. Merchant was used instead.

The title song was later covered by Joan Baez and Christy Moore.

<doc id="933257" wikidata="Q932105" url="?curid=933257" title="Yakovlev UT-2">
<text>The Yakovlev UT-2 (; NATO reporting name &quot;Mink&quot;) is a single-engine tandem two-seat low-wing monoplane that was the standard Soviet trainer during World War II. It was used by the Soviet Air Force from 1937 until replaced by the Yakovlev Yak-18 during the 1950s.

==Development==
The preceding U-2 (Po-2) biplane was no longer a suitable trainer for the faster modern aircraft entering service, and to fill the role, the UT-2 was designed as a trainer.

The new aircraft was designed by Alexander Sergeevich Yakovlev&#x27;s team at OKB-115. Originally designated AIR-10, it was based upon the AIR-9, but it was simpler, with tandem open cockpits, also omitting slats and flaps. It first flew on 11 July 1935. The AIR-10 won the competition in 1935 and, after minor changes, was accepted as the standard Soviet Air Force trainer. With the disgrace of Alexey Ivanovich Rykov under whom Yakovlev had been working, the initials &quot;AIR&quot; were replaced with &quot;Ya&quot; making what would have been the AIR-20 the Ya-20 (Я-20).

The wood-and-metal mixed construction of the AIR-10 was simplified to use only wood to facilitate production, and the AIR-10s 120 hp Renault inline engine was replaced with the 112 kW (150 hp) Shvetsov M-11E radial on the prototype, and the 82 kW (110 hp) M-11Gs in early production aircraft. Serial production started in September 1937. The Soviet VVS (Air Force) assigned the aircraft the designation UT-2 (&quot;uchebno-trenirovochnyi&quot; {учебно-тренировочный}, trainer).

The UT-2 was not easy to fly and easily entered into spins. The UT-2 model 1940 featured a lengthened forward fuselage, and a change to the 93 kW (125 hp) M-11D radial to attempt to rectify the problem. Despite improvements, the handling and flight characteristics remained challenging.

To further improve handling and stability, the new UT-2M (modernized) variant was developed in 1941 and it replaced the original UT-2 in production. The wing planform was redesigned, with a swept leading edge and a straight trailing edge, and the vertical stabilizer was enlarged.

7,243 UT-2 of all types were produced in five factories between 1937 and 1946. 
In the 1950s, the UT-2 was replaced by the Yak-18 primary trainer and the Yak-11 advanced trainer.

Before and after World War II the UT-2 was used by civilian organizations, and after the war, UT-2s were also operated by the Polish and Hungarian Air Forces.

<text>Stuart Vance Carlisle (born 10 May 1972) is a former Zimbabwean cricketer who played 37 Test matches and 111 One Day Internationals for Zimbabwe. He also captained the side briefly, leading them in six Tests and 12 ODIs, and achieving a 2–3 result in an ODI series in India. He has the unique distinction of being the only Zimbabwean player to have scored both ODI and test century against Australia.

He was denied the opportunity and long rope of potentially being a prominent and integral member of the Zimbabwean side during his peak years due to the tensions he and fellow white players had with Zimbabwe Cricket. He was known for his unorthodox playing style in his short international career and was also lauded for being an athletic fielder during his playing days.

==International career==
He made his test debut on 31 January 1995 against Pakistan and a month later he made his ODI debut against the same opponents on 22 February 1995. He was picked in Zimbabwe&#x27;s squad for the 1999 Cricket World Cup.

During a triangular ODI series in 2001, he scored a quick-fire century and ended up with 119 off just 45 balls as he single-handedly helped Zimbabwe to chase the mammoth target of 304 set by Australia and Zimbabwe eventually fell short by just 2 runs. Despite the valiant knock, his innings is best remembered as one of the finest ODI knocks in losing causes.

Carlisle became the Zimbabwean captain in 2001 and Zimbabwe registered their first overseas test win in 17 years after defeating Bangladesh down under. After losing five out of six test matches, he lost the captaincy and was not picked for the 2003 Cricket World Cup.

A right batsman, he was often shuffled up and down the order. He was used a utility batsman who played in a number of positions in the lineup from no 1 to no 7 position and was never given a role clarity and was not given the perfect position where he can bat for a long time. Due to the instability of his batting position, he quite did not reach the true potential in international career which was cut short.

He made his maiden Test century in October 2003, against Australia at Sydney and despite his valiant efforts Zimbabwe lost the match by 9 wickets. He was also well known for his spirited knock of 109 against India in a VB ODI tri-nation series clash in 2004 where he along with Sean Ervine made a record breaking partnership worth 202 runs which propelled Zimbabwe to pull off an upset victory over India but ultimately Zimbabwe fell short by just 3 runs when chasing a target of 281. He along with Sean Ervine set the record for the highest 4th wicket partnership for Zimbabwe in ODIs (202).

After an unbeaten 103 in a test match against Bangladesh in early 2004, he became involved in the dispute with the Zimbabwean Cricket Board over the controversial sacking of Heath Streak. He was at the forefront of the 2004 strike which was sparked by Streak&#x27;s sacking from captaincy and from national selection for complaining about alleged racism by selectors and politically motivated policies. He was one of the 15 contracted players to be fired from the team after showing support to ousted Heath Streak. As one of the rebel players he refused to play for Zimbabwe and after a brief return in 2005 he had had enough of the internal struggles and retired from all forms of the game. He revealed that he was fed up by the things which transpired within Zimbabwe Cricket and insisted that he was tired of the politics in Zimbabwe after announcing his retirement.

== Post cricket ==
After announcing his international retirement, he reportedly received an offer to play for Australia but he turned down the offer and instead started the business of importing food products. However, the business was later taken over by the bigger corporates and then he pursued his interest in sports manufacturing.

He also owns and runs Absolute Sports, a golf store attached to the Royal Harare Golf Club which hosts Zimbabwe Open.

<doc id="933267" wikidata="Q777114" url="?curid=933267" title="Kihon">
<text>is a Japanese term meaning &quot;basics&quot; or &quot;fundamentals.&quot; The term is used to refer to the basic techniques that are taught and practiced as the foundation of most Japanese martial arts. 

The practice and mastery of kihon is essential to all advanced training, and includes the practice of correct body form and breathing, while practicing basics such as stances, punches, kicks, blocks, and thrusts, but it also includes basic representative &quot;kata&quot;.

Kihon is not only practicing of techniques, it is also the budōka fostering the correct spirit and attitude at all times.

Kihon techniques tend to be practiced often, in many cases during each practice session. They are considered fundamental to mastery and improvement of all movements of greater complexity. Kihon in martial arts can be seen as analogous to basic skills in, for example, basketball. Professional NBA players continue to practice dribbling, passing, free throws, jump shots, etc. in an effort to maintain and perfect the more complex skills used during a basketball game.

<text>504 Records is a record label founded by Mike Dine in 1979 that specializes in New Orleans jazz. The name comes from an area code in New Orleans.

==History==
Mike Dine was a British draughtsman and jazz fan living in England when he met Tom Stagg, now a British expatriate, jazz fan, and founder of NOLA Records. During the 1960s, Stagg had helped bring to Europe musicians such as John Handy, Andrew Morgan, Louis Nelson, Alton Purnell, Emanuel Sayles, and Kid Thomas. When Dine started 504 Records in 1979, he hired Stagg as a producer, and Stagg shut down NOLA Records.

Between 2005 and 2018, 504 Records collaborated with La Croix Records (UK) to co-produce 9 504/La Croix CDs in the Lord Richard New Orleans Sessions series. This series included tapes owned exclusively by Lord Richard Ekins, La Croix Records, supplemented with material owned by Mike Dine, 504 Records. 504 Records is now owned by Upbeat Recordings, UK, with the exclusive ownership of all 504/La Croix material passing to Lord Richard Ekins.

Dine released &quot;The 504 Records Story: 1978–2003 (25 Year Anniversary Release)&quot;. He died in Welling, Kent, England, on December 17, 2016.
