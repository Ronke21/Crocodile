<text>Meanwood is a suburb and former village in north-west Leeds, West Yorkshire, England.

The area sits in the Moortown ward of Leeds City Council and Leeds North East parliamentary constituency.

==Origins and history==
The name Meanwood goes back to the 12th century, and is of Anglo-Saxon derivation: the &quot;Meene wude&quot; was the boundary wood of the Manor of Alreton, the woods to the east of Meanwood Beck. Dwellings and farms near the wood were known by a variety of names including Meanwoodside until 27 August 1847 when the parish of Meanwood was established and the woods became known Meanwood Woods.

A skirmish, between Royalist and Parliamentarian forces, took place in Meanwood, during the Civil War. It is said that the &quot;beck ran red&quot;, with the blood of the fallen, hence, the place name &quot;Stainbeck&quot;.

The Meanwood Valley was a place of industry as long ago as 1577 and it continued to the 19th century. The Meanwood Beck provided water and power for corn, flax and paper mills, dye works and tanneries. There were numerous quarries.

In 1830 a turnpike road was established through the Meanwood Valley to Leeds. Public transport followed from 1850 and electric trams in 1890, meaning that it was practical for people to travel to work from greater distances, encouraging both industrial buildings and housing.

==Geography and buildings==
===Tunnel How Hill===
Tunnel How Hill, north of the Stonegate Road, &quot;was reputed to be the highest point in Leeds.&quot; A folly in the form of a ruined castle stood there from the 18th century until 1946, dedicated to King Alfred. Some streets adjacent to the hill are named after King Alfred.

The hill was formerly known as &quot;Pen-how-fyn&quot;, and a hamlet below it was &quot;Paenfynaen&quot; (where &quot;fynaen&quot; means settlement). It was referred to as Penny Fun in the 19th century and several houses in the vicinity used the name. The 1850 Ordnance Survey Map labels the settlement as &quot;Pen-y-ffynon&quot;. A public house in the Moor Allerton District Centre was called the Penny Fun until 2020, when it was renamed.

===Various Buildings===
The 1841 census listed 144 houses, including Carr House (Carr Manor), Meanwood Hall and Whalley House (now demolished). Most properties were stone cottages, now gone, with the exception of a few houses on Monkbridge Road. Hustler&#x27;s Row remains as a group of 1850 stone cottages named after John Husler, a quarry owner. To the west along the road towards Meanwood Park are some houses built for tannery workers and the Meanwood Institute, built about 1820, but opened as the Institute in 1885, a Grade II listed building.

Sugarwell Court on Meanwood Road, is the former Cliff Tannery, an 1866 Grade II listed building converted into a university hall of residence. Nearby is a former Baptist school, a brick Grade II listed building dating from about 1886.

There are a number of 19th-century industrial buildings in Meanwood Valley along the Meanwood Beck, and 19th century terraced housing on the valley side leading to Headingley, Weetwood and Woodhouse, along with an area of woodland known locally as the Ridge.

New estates have been built with grand, suburban housing, the Woodleas, the Stonegates and the Bowoods. 20th century council housing mixed with open space forms the opposite side of the valley leading up to Scott Hall. There is a shopping centre opposite a Waitrose Food &amp; Home store on Green Road, near the site of a tannery which is believed to date from 1700.

===Meanwood Hall===

Meanwood Hall is a grade II listed building. It was built about 1762 for Thomas Denison, extended in 1814 for Joseph Lees, and further developed in 1834 for Christopher Beckett. In 1919 it was bought by the city council to form the nucleus of Meanwood Park Hospital which accommodated men, women and children with learning disabilities. It served the city of Leeds and other areas of the West Riding of Yorkshire, and at its maximum extent in the 1960s had 841 beds. After the hospital closed in 1997, the hall was converted to housing, and further housing developments now fill the hospital grounds.

===Meanwood Towers===

In the middle of an estate of inter-war semi-detached houses behind Stonegate Road stands a Victorian Gothic house, Meanwood Towers. Designed by Edward Welby Pugin, and built in 1866–67. A private house, it was commissioned by Thomas Stuart Kennedy and was originally called Meanwood House. Kennedy commissioned the German organ-builder Edmund Schulze to build him a pipe organ. In 1869, it was installed in a specially-built 800-seat wooden concert hall or &#x27;organ house&#x27;. After eight years, there were problems with the organ house and the Schulze organ was loaned to St. Peter&#x27;s Church, Harrogate and two years later, in 1879, it was sold and presented to St. Bartholomew&#x27;s Church, Armley. 
In keeping with its grand design, the house was built with tall chimneys, but in 1969 these were shortened for safety reasons. Most of the original house survives, but converted into flats.

===Carr Manor===
Carr Manor was a 17th-century manor house sometimes known as Carr House. It was greatly extended 1880-81 by architect Edward Schroeder Prior for Thomas Clifford Allbutt. It was used by the City of Leeds as a residence for judges during trials at Leeds Crown Court, but is now private dwellings.
Carr Manor gives its name to a 1950s estate of private houses and a primary and high school.
===Farm Hill===
Early photographs show the Model Farm, which occupied the hillside, with fields in which rhubarb was grown. The area also hosted Sugarwell Hill Mill which had a distinctive round chimney.
In 1919, 80 acres of land to the south of Meanwood, close to Woodhouse Ridge, was sold by the Model Farm to Leeds Corporation. The Farm Hill housing estate was developed on the land. The area was often referred to informally as the &#x27;white houses&#x27; because of the colour the concrete was rendered. The estate became a concentration of bad press for Meanwood very quickly. Most of the original houses were demolished in the late 1980s and many of the residents were moved to the Beckhill estate. The opening credits to police drama Parkin&#x27;s Patch began with a scene shot at Farm Hill.
The area was redeveloped in 1990 as a series of two- and three-bedroom semi-detached houses and bungalows, around half of which are privately owned. A few of the original 1920s houses remain on the fringes of the estate. The Model Farm, after which the hillside and estate is named, is still standing today (situated off Farm Hill South) with a number of fields used as pasture for horses. Many of the streets in the area are still known as Farm Hill. The estate also hosts the much newer Meanwood Valley Urban Farm. A network of woodland and field footpaths connect the estate to Potternewton Lane, Buslingthorpe Lane and Woodhouse Ridge.

In 2000, a further estate of residential houses was built on the opposite side of Meanwood Road, centred around Boothroyd Drive. Although the Farm Hills and Boothroyd Drive are contiguous, Meanwood Road divides the older and new estates and represents a political and postal boundary. Houses on the Farm Hill have an LS7 postcode, whilst houses on the south side of Meanwood Road have an LS6 postcode.

Woodhouse Community Sports and Social Club is sandwiched between the two developments (despite its name, the club house and pitches are in Meanwood, not Woodhouse). The club hosts cricket (Woodhouse Cricket Club) and amateur rugby league (both Headingley Hawks and Woodhouse Warriors).

==Religion==
The Church of England parish church is Holy Trinity Church, a Grade II* listed building consecrated in 1849, designed by William Railton in the lancet Gothic style. Its clock was designed by Edmund Beckett and made by Edward John Dent, who was responsible for Big Ben. It has three faces, as there was open country to the east.

The Methodist Church was built in 1881 in a modified Gothic style, and enlarged seven years later to accommodate a further 120 seats. A previous Methodist Church in Meanwood had been built in 1811. The church building was closed in October 2014 and the church community moved to use the Holy Trinity Church building. The building is now used by the Iglesia ni Cristo.

St Oswald&#x27;s Church was built in 1890 as a chapel of ease for St Chad&#x27;s of Far Headingley. It was enlarged in 1910 and made into a church, but closed in 2002 and the congregation moved to St Chad&#x27;s.

==Meanwood Park==
Meanwood Park, in the north of the area, is approximately , and has large open areas and mature trees. Meanwood Beck runs through it, crossed by many small footbridges. The southern end has a children&#x27;s playground and an area with picnic tables. To the north west Meanwood Park borders onto the Hollies, a separate park with sloping woodland containing many rhododendrons and azaleas. The Hollies has gardens including the National Plant Collection of Philadelphus. The Meanwood Valley Trail passes through Meanwood Park. It is believed that the artist John Atkinson Grimshaw based some of his fairy paintings in Meanwood Park.
==Community groups==
Meanwood Valley Partnership is a not for profit organisation made up of residents and volunteers that focuses on caring for and preserving the Meanwood Valley, a stretch of land approximately one mile across and two miles long. It is focused on retaining the village atmosphere and holds events such as an annual funday and restoration work on projects such as the war memorial.

YMAV Youth Movement Against Violence cic is a not for profit organisation which was founded in 2016 they support the victims and families affected by violence in a holistic approach providing 1-1 outreach support, counselling and holistic therapies. They also provide many community based projects running from Meanwood Community Center including a tea-time club, yoga group and have recently started a project called Restore Community Healing Garden see there website www.ymav.co.uk for more information

==Sport and social activities==
Numerous sporting activities exist in Meanwood, including the Meanwood Valley Trail Race (a cross country race that has been going since 1996), amateur cricket and rugby league. Meanwood Cricket Club has existed since 1870, and their present ground since 1895. Meanwood Cricket Club are currently members of the Wetherby Cricket League and run 2 teams. They previously played in the Dales Council League where the club enjoyed a successful period from 1989 to 2002. The cricket club won the League Cup a then record six times - appearing in eight finals in the space of 12 years - and also claimed a League and Cup double in 1998.

==Notable residents==

Captain Lawrence Oates (of the ill-fated Scott expedition to Antarctica) often resided in Meanwood. There is a monument to his altruism close to Holy Trinity Church. The Lawrence Oates School (closed 1992) was named after him. In 2012, on the 100th anniversary of his death, a blue plaque was unveiled in his honour at Meanwood Park.

Writer and critic Graham Holderness was born in Meanwood.

<doc id="926264" wikidata="Q876852" url="?curid=926264" title="Summer camp">
<text>A summer camp, also known as a sleepaway camp or residential camp, is a supervised overnight program for children conducted during the summer vacation from school in many countries. Children and adolescents who attend summer residential camps are known as . They generally are offered overnight accommodations for one or two weeks out in an outdoor natural campsite setting. Day camps, by contrast, offer the same types of experience in the outdoors but children return home each evening. Summer school is a different experience that is usually offered by local schools for their students focused on remedial education to ensure students are prepared for the upcoming academic year or in the case of high school students, to retake failed state comprehensive exams necessary for graduation. Summer residential and day camps may include an academic component but it is not a requirement.

The traditional view of a summer camp as a wooded place with hiking, canoeing, campfires, etc. has changed with a higher number of camps offering a wider variety of specialized activities. Examples of such themes include the performing arts, music, magic, computer programming, language education, mathematics, children with special needs, and weight loss.

In 2024, the American Camp Association&#x27;s National Economic Impact Study of the Camp Industry reported 20,175 camps in the United States. This is largely to counter a trend in decreasing enrollment in summer camps, which some argue to have been brought about by smaller family sizes and the growth in supplemental educational programs. Some summer camps are affiliated with religious institutions, including various denominations of Christianity and Judaism.

The primary purpose of many camps is educational, athletic, or cultural development. A summer camp especially for children may allow people to learn new skills in a safe and nurturing environment. Summer camp experience can have a lasting psychological impact on the development of a child.

The first organized camp is often credited to the Gunnery Camp, established in 1861 by Frederick W. Gunn in Washington, Connecticut. This camp primarily served as a place for young boys to engage in outdoor activities and develop physical skills. Girls camps in the United States began to appear around 1900; many of the early camps were located in New England. In 1900, there were fewer than 100 camps in the United States, but by 1918 over 1000 were in operation. Early camps for girls were located in remote, natural areas, and many camps featured a water venue. There were outdoor activities such as canoeing, archery, and hiking. Other types of popular instruction involved handcrafts, dramatics, camp and fire-making. Campers slept in wigwams, tents, or open dormitories. Any of these options encouraged a camper to take responsibility for maintaining her own personal space and to develop self-sufficiency.

Mimicking Native American traditions such as council fires and storytelling generated a sense of community and inspired campers to become conscientious members of a group. Typically, girl campers wore their hair in a version of native style. Uniforms were standard in most camps, but braided hair and headbands were common attire for campers. For camp ceremonies and pageants, girls would dress in special Native inspired dresses, at times even contributing to the handiwork. In this era, camps were considered to be a natural pathway for young girls to develop healthy bodies, self-assurance and a sense of community.

Today&#x27;s girls&#x27; camps offer many activities, such as STEM Camps, sailing, and dramatic arts.

== Organization ==
In most camps in Canada and the United States, young adult supervisors are called counselors or &quot;cabin leaders&quot;. In many camps, counselors are assigned to small groups of campers, called &quot;bunks&quot;, &quot;huts&quot;, &quot;cabins&quot;, or &quot;units&quot;, who participate in activities as a group, such as campfires, hiking, canoeing, swimming, nature lore, and arts and crafts. Counselors often share living accommodations with their group.

In the United States and Canada, counselors for residential camps are typically drawn from older teens and college-aged adults (early 20s) because of the temporary, seasonal and low-paying aspects of the work. International staff are often hired alongside their North American counterparts through agencies who vet the staff beforehand. Overall camp supervision is typically done by older camp directors, who lead a team that includes cooks, sports instructors, a nurse, maintenance personnel and counselors. The director and the maintenance personnel have a longer-term affiliation with the summer camp. Professional camp staff organize the preparation of facilities and supplies for the camp season and supervise the maintenance of the camp during the off-season. Camp directors conduct the hiring of seasonal counselors, instructors, and support staff, often during job fairs held on campuses or on online job boards.

At some camps, all campers stay overnight in cabins and eat all their meals in a cafeteria. At some camps, also known as day camps, the campers go home each night. Some other camps allow both day and overnight campers. In the US and Canada, residential camps that have overnight facilities are sometimes called &quot;sleepaway camps&quot;. Summer camp is often the first time that children spend an extended period of time away from home.

Many camps cancelled their 2020 season in light of the COVID-19 pandemic.

==Educational camps==
In the United States, there are numerous models of camp with an educational focus that cater to students of differing ages and academic interest.

===College credit courses===
Some camps offer students the opportunity to explore a pre-college experience. Typically, students entering grades 10 through 12 stay in the college dormitories and attend summer classes run by college faculty. At the successful completion of a summer program, course credits are awarded, which in turn are accepted by most tertiary institutions. Typically, colleges in the United States and Canada offer these programs, as it serves as an introduction to students to entice them to attend the college as full-time students based upon a memorable summer experience.

===Non-college credit courses===
Some camps, such as CTY and Duke TIP, are focused primarily on education or on educational-related activities, such as debate, history, or journalism. These camps are often run by colleges or universities, and are usually for children in junior or senior high school. Instruction in debate and speech is also available for middle school students and incoming high school students all over the country. Educational summer camps are different from summer schools as the summer camps often are not offered for school credit, and often have a significant focus on non-academic activities. Students for these programs are often invited or recruited. Many of these camps, such as Canada/USA Mathcamp and SSP, focus on a specific subject, such as mathematics or astronomy. These camps tend to have selective application processes involving problem solving or an essay about the applicant&#x27;s interest in the subject.

===Academic adventure camps===
These provide high school students with the opportunity to study academic topics on a summer adventure travel program, typically in the wilderness or a foreign country. Many include community service as a component of the course. Others also offer college credit with the successful completion of the program.

===SAT preparation courses===
Various camp programs offer preparation for the SAT Reasoning Test as part of a mixture of academic learning with summer fun. Often the SAT preparation is offered as a full morning immersion while the afternoons and evenings are geared towards homework and recreational activities. These camp programs often outsource their SAT component from test preparation companies like The Princeton Review or Kaplan who provide the teachers and resources.

===Enrichment courses===
These programs offer a wide range of classes that may have little or no scholastic overlap but are taught with the purpose of broadening the student&#x27;s conception and interest in many otherwise unknown areas of study. Students typically explore subjects like photography, community service, drama, magic, scuba diving, video production, comic book design, crime scene forensics, cooking, yoga, and similar areas.

===Science and nature===
Summer camps provide opportunities for children to learn hands-on. One of the oldest and longest-running science camps is the International Astronomical Youth Camp (IAYC) which began in 1969. So far, IAYCs have been held in 15 countries and have hosted 3,468 participants (~1,700 unique), from 81 nationalities worldwide.

===Tech camps===

Tech camps focus on technology education. These summer camps develop 21st-century skills in areas such as game design, 3D game creation, web design, graphic design, robot building, and programming languages. These summer camps are typically held on college campuses. Many universities now offer technology-focused camps in the summer as a way of reaching future students, generating revenue and providing community service outreach.

===Language and foreign culture camps===

To meet a growing demand for language education, language camps have developed around the United States. Many of these summer programs are hosted by high schools. Colleges and universities have also created camps using their facilities to host younger students. Foreign countries have established summer schools in the United States to offer education regarding their culture and language. The growing popularity of summer language camps may be related to a growing interest in languages not typically offered in United States high school curricula. Arabic, Mandarin Chinese, and Korean are examples of languages in-demand that do not often appear in a curriculum.

== Other type of camps ==

===Art and performing arts camps===
Other camps have become summer training grounds for a variety of arts. Many offer elective classes in a range of creative and performing arts activities including visual arts, music, theater, speech, debate, dance, circus arts, rock and roll, magic and other specialties. Some of these programs have a narrow focus on one particular area, while others offer a wide range of programs. Due to the popularity of these activities, many traditional camps have added some elements of the visual and performing arts into their programs as well.

Oftentimes camps will have various totems or traditions that pass from one group of campers to the next, with each group adding something that denotes their time at the camp, often like a time capsule. Painted totems, wood carving, and show programs often accumulate as a sacred object that passes from one group to the next. Cheer camps have popularized the concept of a spirit stick. Performing art camps often run 3 or 4 week sessions that culminate in some sort of performance that parents and families attend.

===Sports camps===

Summer camps can be found that offer intensive instruction in almost any sport imaginable, or that offer quality instruction and competition in a wide range of sports. Camps are split into groups of day camps and overnight camps. In the United States, overnight sports camps fall into two groups. The more traditional of these offer boys and girls the chance to learn and play many sports. Sessions are typically 3 to 8 weeks long, and some camps have multiple sessions. While many strong athletes attend these camps, a traditional sports camp program also serves the needs of less proficient athletes by having all campers compete on teams picked by ability, so all kids get a chance to contribute to their team&#x27;s success in their daily competitions. Some of these camps have been operating for more than 100 years. These camps generally focus, through the medium of team sports, on the development of the whole child; not just how they are as an athlete, but also how they are as a person, a bunkmate, a teammate, and a friend. Many of these camps include a variety of non-sports programs as well for a more diverse experience.

Many sports camps are of the second type, which focuses almost exclusively on one particular sport. These camps generally focus on helping each camper acquire skills in a sport that helps them gain confidence and improve their chances of making the team when they return to school. Indeed, some campers are helped to be nationally competitive by way of this kind of intensive summer training. These camps generally run week-long sessions, and some campers may attend more than one session even though the curriculum repeats each week. Some single-sport camps offer longer sessions. Many of the instructors at these camps are coaches of local teams, and thus many athletes get valuable extra time with the coach they play for during the school year (or the coach they hope to play for during the upcoming school year). Such camps are also a good way to learn about potential college scholarships in their sport.

Both multi-sport and single-sport camps tend to be run by experienced teachers and coaches (who typically have summers off from their school responsibilities). Cabin staff, instructors, and counselors are typically college athletes. The best sports camps succeed at challenging aspiring athletes both mentally and physically, while also promoting their social and leadership skills. This is possible in part because many of the counselors attended as campers, and thus there is a vibrant &quot;camp culture&quot; that welcomes new campers into an extended camp family and establishes the high standards that incoming campers are encouraged to achieve. The best sports camps do much more than just improve a camper&#x27;s soccer, tennis, lacrosse, or wrestling skills; they help each child become a more skillful athlete, a more gracious competitor, a more committed team player, and a more confident person.

===Weight loss camps===

Weight loss camps are for overweight children, teenagers, and adults to learn about losing weight and keep it off while having a summer camp experience.

=== Emotional education camps ===
These kinds of camps are a new way to increase the emotional intelligence of the children. There are some examples of these camps, around the world, for example, Rumbendëll emotional camp, based in Seville, Spain.

=== LGBT camps ===
LGBT summer camps are safe spaces designed for LGBT youths to experience the supportive atmosphere they may lack at home. They follow a similar model to summer camps, with traditional activities like swimming, canoeing, and bog runs but also queer activities like &quot;Grave Digging&quot;, where kids can bury their old gender identities and , or learning makeup tips from a drag queen. Identity-affirming camps can improve the psychological well-being of LGBT youth.

==Around the world==
===Australia===

Summer camps are largely non-existent in Australia, because the Australian summer break (known as the Christmas holidays) only lasts four weeks, and occurs over Christmas and the New Year, shorter than in North America. Most children participate in School-camps, Girl Guide/scout camps, or school holiday camps with some religious groups (Such as the Salvation Army and Seventh-Day Adventists) holding week-long Summer Camps. Girl Guides and Scouts offer &#x27;jamborees&#x27; which are camps over 1 to 2 weeks. Multiple-week camps are next to unheard of.

Many of Australia&#x27;s youth music organizations hold annual rehearsal camps in summer including the Australian Youth Orchestra&#x27;s National Music Camp and Gondwana Choirs Gondwana National Choral School. Other than the Seventh-Day Adventist Summer Camps, most holiday camps are referred to as &quot;Adventure Camps&quot;, because they largely do not occur over summer. Many groups hold holiday day-camps for Primary aged children, and often run week-long adventure camps during the Spring, Autumn and Winter breaks.

Australian Defence Force Cadets often and almost exclusively (excepting school-based units) run their extended camps and courses over school holiday periods, which provide food and lodging for cadets over the course of the camp. However, these camps or field exercises often last only one or two weeks and thus do not fill up the majority of the school holidays. This allows the cadets (who are aged 12–18 years and therefore mostly attend school) to attend the camps whilst still completing normal schooling.

===Canada===
In Canada, summer camps are very popular. About 70% of Canadian camps tend to be affiliated with organizations, while the rest are private. There are also many summer camps for ESL students. Summer camp fairs are held throughout Canada, usually during the winter months. Parents and children can meet camp directors and collect information about summer camps. Admission to these fairs is typically free, and the camps on display vary in their cost from completely subsidized fees to quite expensive.

Some camps are specifically designed to reduce Summer learning loss, particularly in literacy and mathematics. For example, the Council of Ontario Directors of Education (CODE) published the results of their study entitled &quot;The Ontario Summer Literacy Learning Project 2010&quot;. Then, in 2014 they published a Program Planning Guide to help Boards implement &quot;Summer Learning Programs&quot; (SLP). After three years of delivering the SLP, they concluded that the programs a) make a difference for students experiencing literacy challenges, b) minimize summer learning losses, and c) in many cases, increase literacy achievements. In recent years the project has included both French and English classes, blended literacy &amp; numeracy, robotics, coding, student mentors, Indigenous activities and English Language Learning, and reports are available online.

===Chile===
The Chilean Inglés Abre Puertas (English Opens Doors) program from the Ministry of Education runs each January and July English-language Summer and Winter camps, respectively. The camps take place during the students&#x27; vacations, and &quot;are designed to give talented Chilean public high school students the chance to practice English in a more hands-on way through interactive activities including role-playing exercises, field trips, group projects, and competitive games.&quot;

===China===
Most of the summer camps are sponsored by the educational bureau. However, nowadays, there are more privately held camp programs. The traditional camps are only open to the selected students within individual school districts. In recent years, programs have started that are open to kids from different backgrounds and regions. There are also programs tailored for international students who are interested in learning Chinese language and culture.

===Cyprus===
In Cyprus, summer camps are widely used for children. They usually are situated in the Troodos Mountains area and more specific around Platres. The church, government and organised groups provide funds for many children so that they can join summer camps for free.

===Czech Republic===
There is a long-standing tradition of summer camps in the Czech Republic. Most commonly, campers are accommodated in tents standing on so-called &quot;podsada&quot;. It was invented in 1913 and nowadays it is widely used across the Czech Republic, but also in some other European states such as Slovakia. These camps are usually situated in meadows surrounded by forests far away from cities and civilisation in general. Even though there is almost no possibility to use electrical devices and no facilities such as hot water, the popularity of those camps is still increasing.

===Finland===

Many Finnish non-governmental organizations arrange summer camps for children in a wide variety of age brackets. Major organizers of summer camps are the scouts, sports teams and the orthodox and evangelic-Lutheran churches. The concept of summer camps arose with the rapid post-WWII urbanization and industrialization Finland experienced. The reason behind this was that Finnish pedagogues of that period, influenced by the values of the largely agrarian pre-WWII society, were convinced that an urban lifestyle was harmful to the development of children. The idea behind summer camps was to ensure that children had experiences of the countryside, experiences that would aid in development into a decent citizen.

One Finnish tradition also arose soon after WWII, was confirmation camps. Confirmation camps, religious camps for 13–16 years old youths organized by the local churches, aimed to combine the traditional concept of confirmation school and the newer concept of summer camps in order to battle secularization of the society. The concept was successful enough to such an extent that today, 90% of all youths participate in confirmation camps. The camps require their participants to learn certain religious texts, such as the catechism, and the Lord&#x27;s Prayer. There are a number of non-religious alternatives for confirmation camps, such as the Prometheus Camp, which aim to generate a positive intellectual and social atmosphere for the participants of the camp without religious tuition.

===France===
In France, they are called &quot;colonies de vacances&quot; or more recently &quot;centres de vacances&quot;. According to the French administration, more than 25% of French children attend this kind of &quot;collective holiday&quot; each year.

===Greece===
In Greece, summer camps are widely known for offering organized vacations for children. They offer sports activities, entertainment activities, and educational activities. Children 5 – 15 years old can join summer camps and have the opportunity to interact with peers. The Greek government provides funds for many children so that they can join a summer camp, free.

===India===
Summer camps in India are primarily located in the Himalayas in Northern India in the state of Uttarakhand in places like Uroli near Ranikhet, near the Tons river in Purola, near the Ganges in Rishikesh, in Uttarkashi where many peaks like Darba top are located, and in the Shimla region in Himachal Pradesh. In South India, summer camps are popular in Coorg in the state of Karnataka and in Yercaud and Anaikkati in the state of Tamil Nadu. Activities in summer camps in India include rock climbing, backpacking, mountain biking, white water rafting, trekking, ropes, and wilderness craft. Many pre-schools in India such as Season Camps, G MaX, Gurukul Preschool (Hunar Summer Camp ) AppleKids conduct extensive Summer Camps for Kids aged 2 to 12 years. Adventure activities for kids are also popular at the summer camps for age groups of 7 to 18 years. Summer camps focusing on wildlife conservation are getting popular over the years. Many of these summer camps are also held in and around metros like Bangalore, Mumbai, Chennai, Kolkata and Pune.

===Ireland===
Summer camps in Ireland were traditionally in the form of Irish colleges in areas that are officially recognized as speaking Irish as the local language, (called Gaeltachts). They are residential Irish language summer courses that give students the opportunity to be totally immersed in the Irish language, usually for periods of three weeks over the summer months. During these courses, students attend classes and participate in a variety of different activities games, music, art and sport. These courses not only provide students with the ability to improve their language skills but also have proved to be a vehicle for introducing traditional cultural activities (céilís, Irish traditional music, etc.) to a new generation.

Whilst Irish colleges are still popular, a greater variety of summer camps are now on offer catering for a range of interests. Sports camps covering Gaelic games as well as rugby and soccer have proven very popular. Arts and crafts, cookery, acting, dance, and outdoor pursuits are some of the other niche camps available. There is also a growing popularity for technical or computer camps. They cover areas such as web design, video production, desktop publishing, etc., reflecting a more modern and diverse Ireland.

===Israel===
The majority of summer camps in Israel are run by the youth movements and the largest organization is the Israeli Scouts who are organizing over 40 different overnight camps every summer with more than 80,000 participants. Youth movement summer camps usually take place between 3 and 12 days. There are some longer overnight camps where campers stay for two weeks such as Camp Kimama, which was founded in Michmoret, within the youth village of Mevo&#x27;ot Yam. The affiliation of the overnight summer camps is Jewish so they celebrate Shabbat and other Jewish holidays. The summer camps are international and are meant for Jewish kids and teens from Israel and countries around the world.

Today, there are summer day camps in almost every village and city, most of which are run by the local authority or certain organizations. In addition, there are a lot of church organized camps including many denominations. For example, all evangelical churches (mostly in the Galilee) hold a Vacation Bible School (VBS) which includes many activities for children. One of the overnight camps is called the Potter&#x27;s Wheel Camp (PWC) which was originally started by Baptist missionaries at the Baptist Village near Petah Tikva. This camp continues to serve hundreds of children to this day.

===Italy===
In Italy, summer camps take place during the students&#x27; vacations (usually between June and August).

===South Korea===
Summer camps in South Korea are English Immersion camps where the emphasis is on learning through structured lessons, and especially tailored activities to ensure students use the language as much as possible. South Korea is quite unique with its emphasis on acquiring English speaking skills, and teachers for these 2 to 4 week camps come from all over the English speaking world. Some of the teachers are on vacation from their regular work in South Korea. Others come from their home countries or other countries where they might be working and are on special visas just for the camps.

Some employ as many Korean staff as there are native English teachers to ensure the cultural and communication gaps are narrowed. A good camp should provide equipment and well-researched texts for the different levels of students. To maximize the learning time spent there should be no more than 11 students per class. At some of the camps, students sleep at dormitory accommodations, which are monitored all through the night by Korean staff. Other camps are day camps where the majority of students are bused to and from the camp. Teachers spend most of their time with their students. They eat together, play sports together, and supervise them when there are special group activities. Similar camps are also offered during winter vacation. They are certainly no less popular than the summer camps.

===Malaysia===
Summer camps in Malaysia are not so popular as in other countries. Children &amp; teenagers have fun together by themselves. But now, summer camps are slowly getting attention. The biggest summer camps available are usually for children below 7 years old.

===Russia===
In the USSR, the first summer camps were created shortly after its establishment and were called Young Pioneer camps during the Soviet Union&#x27;s existence. Their number grew throughout the history of the Soviet Union and they numbered more than forty thousand in 1973, with 9,300,000 children attending them during their vacation every year. After the breakup of the USSR, the number of Young Pioneer camps greatly declined. However, many of the major camps still exist. There are 2,726 Residential camps (with 2,000,000 children), and more 40,000 Day camps (3,500,000 children) in Russia (2006). Most of them were united by All-Russian Camp Association &quot;Deti Plus&quot; (Children Plus) in 1994.

===Sweden===
The Church of Sweden provides confirmation camps, usually combined with outdoor life. Summer camps are often single sport camps.

===Tunisia===
Every year during the summer school holiday, the Youth and Science Association organizes Scientific camps in many regions in Tunisia where children and teenagers can learn new skills, develop their potential and have fun.

===United Kingdom===
Summer camps are not a major part of childhood in the United Kingdom in the way they are in North America. The UK school summer holiday is shorter, typically six weeks for state schools. The industry body is called the British Activity Holiday Association. Camps in the UK are also generally less specialised than in the United States and Canada, and most offer a fairly broad multi-activity programme of adventure activities alongside some fun social elements. This is partly because summer camps in the UK grew as an offshoot of the activity holiday industry and were therefore influenced by their adventure-only outdoor program. The UK has for the past few decades had a number of organisations that have established themselves more along the traditional model with a very wide range of holiday options as well as themed camps and major event days.

Some religious organisations also run camps throughout the country. The Titus Trust and its predecessors, has been running evangelical Christian camps for children at private schools since the 1930s. Scripture Union also runs camps in the UK, and has been doing so since the end of the nineteenth-century. West Runton Holidays has been putting on camps in the village of that name since 1919. Some mission activities involve camp-style accommodation, such as United Beach Missions, which seeks to evangelise to holiday-makers on beaches.

A number of youth organisations, such as the Scout Association, Army Cadet Force and Air Training Corps, do often run more specialised summer camps for their membership, though these are not usually open to non-members.

The Council of Colony Holidays for Schoolchildren ran summer camps called &quot;Colonies&quot; from the mid-1960s to the mid-1980s. Colonies were not based on outdoor pursuits or the &quot;action-adventure&quot; model, but were multi-activity holidays designed to appeal to a very wide range of children. This organisation was based on the French model, and was unique in the UK in that the young volunteers who worked directly with the children (known as &quot;Monitors&quot;) were prepared for their work in training courses designed and run by the organisation. After Colony Holidays folded in the 1980s, Chris Green, one of their former staff, set up ATE Superweeks to provide similar holidays. He also campaigns for summer camps to become more widely supported and to help transform children&#x27;s lives.

=== United States ===

The American Camp Association (ACA) reported in 2013 that there are about 7,000 overnight camps and about 5,000 day camps in the U.S., for a total of more than 12,000 camps. These camps are attended each year by more than 11 million children and adults. Of the 12,000 camps, about 9,500 are operated by nonprofit groups, and 2,500 by for-profit operators, employing more than 1,500,000 adults. Sports camps abound, offering single and group instruction in numerous sports and activities, often as prep for collegiate sports and scholarships. Their more recent data estimates that, before the COVID-19 pandemic, there were about 15,000 total camps attended by 26 million campers.

In the United States, youth organizations, such as the Boy Scouts, Girl Scouts, 4-H, the JCC, the YMCA, Camp Fire, and several religiously affiliated groups are known for having many camps and integrating them with their own local organizations. Since 2008, the United States has been home to the world&#x27;s first children&#x27;s sleep away camp for transgender children. It is called Camp Aranu&#x27;tiq and serves campers aged 8 to 18. It won the Eleanor P. Eells Award from the American Camp Association in 2012.

<text>The eighth HMS &quot;Vanguard&quot; of the British Royal Navy was an central battery ironclad battleship, by Edward Reed launched in 1870. In 1875, the ship was sunk during a summer cruise in a collision in fog with the ironclad . None of the crew were lost, but the commanding officer of the ship never commanded another vessel in his career. The wreck lies near the Kish lightship off the coast of Ireland and is protected under the Irish National Monument Act.

==Design and construction==
&quot;Vanguard&quot; was long between perpendiculars. She had a beam of and a draught of forward and aft. The ship normally displaced .

==Propulsion==
&quot;Vanguard&quot; was with two sets of 2-cylinder horizontal single expansion, return connecting-rod and 6 rectangular boilers that drove twin screws. The engine had a total designed output of which gave &quot;Vanguard&quot; a maximum speed of .

==Armament==
Her armament consisted of ten 12-ton MLR guns all in a two-tier central battery where six were on MD and two on UD. Furthermore she had four /64-pounder (71 cwt) MLR on UD, with two forward and two aft and six 20-pounder guns for saluting.

==Service history==
&quot;Vanguard&quot; — under the command of Captain Richard Dawkins, sailed out of Kingstown (now Dún Laoghaire) harbour on 27 August 1875 in company with three other ironclads, , and . The ships were part of the First Reserve Squadron and were on a summer cruise around the Irish coast. The squadron — under the command of Admiral Tarleton, was &quot;en route&quot; to Queenstown (Cobh), County Cork where the cruise would finish. As they passed the Kish lightship, a heavy fog came down which restricted visibility to less than a ship&#x27;s length.
&quot;Vanguard&quot;″s sister ship — &quot;Iron Duke&quot; — noticed she was drifting off course and began returning to her proper station. A problem with her steam plant rendered her foghorn inoperable, and could not be used to alert the other vessels of her position or course.
At about 12:50, a look-out on &quot;Vanguard&quot; spotted a sailing ship directly ahead. As &quot;Vanguard&quot; turned to avoid it, &quot;Iron Duke&quot; appeared out of the fog on her port side less than away. Collision was unavoidable. &quot;Iron Duke&quot;″s underwater ram tore open &quot;Vanguard&quot;″s hull near her boilers.

&quot;Iron Duke&quot; freed herself after a few minutes, sustaining only minor damage. &quot;Vanguard&quot;, however, was sinking. Her pumps could move water at a rate of 3,000 lb/min (23 kg/s) but the flooding exceeded 50 long tons per minute (847 kg/s). The pumps were powered by the engines, which shut down ten minutes after the collision when the engine room flooded.

&quot;Vanguard&quot; and &quot;Iron Duke&quot; both launched all boats. The abandonment was completed in good order with Captain Dawkins the last of the 360 crew aboard to leave and the only casualty was his dog which was lost. &quot;Warrior&quot; and &quot;Hector&quot; sailed on in the fog and only learned of the sinking upon reaching Queenstown.

Seventy minutes after the collision, &quot;Vanguard&quot; rested on the seabed deep. The tips of her masts were still visible above the surface. The Admiralty was confident that the ship could be raised and diving operations started, but were soon abandoned. Captain Dawkins was blamed at the court martial for not doing enough to save his vessel following the collision, and never received command of another vessel. Contemporary popular opinion, however, was sympathetic towards him.

The wreck was rediscovered in 1985 and lies in of water. The wreck is protected under the Irish National Monument Act, and a licence from the National Monuments Service is required to dive it.

<text>Woodhouse is a largely residential area just north of the city centre of Leeds and close to the University of Leeds. The area considered as Woodhouse is partly in the Little London and Woodhouse ward and partly in the Headingley &amp; Hyde Park ward of City of Leeds metropolitan district.

==History==
The name &quot;Woodhouse&quot; is first attested around the 1170s as &quot;Wd(e)husa&quot;, &quot;Wd(e)huse&quot;, and &quot;Wudeusum&quot;. It is likely to derive from Old English &quot;wudu&quot; &#x27;wood&#x27; and &quot;hūs&quot; &#x27;houses&#x27;. Locals refer to it as Wudhus. It was described in 1853 as a &quot;large and handsome village&quot;.

The original Woodhouse area of Leeds extended in a wide horseshoe arc travelling north from Burley Street (where it is known as Little Woodhouse), up along Clarendon Road, including the current site of the University of Leeds, across Woodhouse Moor (now a public park), then on towards its northernmost boundary, the steeply banked woodland of Woodhouse Ridge part of the Meanwood Valley Trail, and the Forest of Leeds, where the area was known as Woodhouse Cliff to the west and Woodhouse Carr to the south-east. Ordnance Survey maps for 1893 and 1921 mark an area to the west of Meanwood Road between Buslingthorpe Lane and Buslingthorpe Green as &quot;Woodhouse Carr&quot;.

During the Second World War, the Institution Street (now Holborn Approach) area was accidentally bombed by the German Luftwaffe during night-time blackout air-raid unsuccessful attempts to destroy a nearby industrial target. Several buildings were hit and as a result three people at the bottom end of the street were killed.

The Chemic Tavern is a public house situated in the heart of Woodhouse. It was established in the 1840s and named after Johnson&#x27;s Chemical Works. The factory was demolished in the 1890s but the pub remained.

==Architecture==

Older residences are largely redbrick back-to-back and &#x27;through&#x27; terraced housing. There are also concrete council houses (the Holborn Estate) and a mixture of more modern buildings, particularly student accommodation. There is a small amount of light industry. The former Anglican parish church of St Mark&#x27;s, which has been renovated by Gateway Church Leeds, lends its name to nearby streets and the St Mark&#x27;s Residences of the university. The church building was used as the exterior of The Parish Church of St Mathews in the TV comedy series &quot;The Beiderbecke Affair&quot;. Other older buildings include Quarry Mount Primary School, and several public houses. On Holborn Approach (formerly Institution Street) is the Temperance Hall and Mechanics&#x27; Institute which was opened by Samuel Smiles in 1851 as an alternative to local pubs for socialising. It cost £900 and is of red bricks with yellow sandstone details. Over the years it has been used for various purposes. It is now used as Holborn Church.

==Location grid==
== Notable people ==

The suffragette, socialist and trade unionist Mary Gawthorpe was born in Woodhouse in 1881. 

Alice Mann, the radical printer and bookseller had moved to a house on St Mark&#x27;s Terrace by 1851.

The author and reformer Samuel Smiles moved to live on Woodhouse Cliff in 1847. He was the first president of the Woodhouse Mechanics Institution.

<doc id="926272" wikidata="Q2887535" url="?curid=926272" title="Minas Basin">
<text>The Minas Basin () is an inlet of the Bay of Fundy and a sub-basin of the Fundy Basin located in Nova Scotia, Canada. It is known for its extremely high tides.

== Geography ==

The Minas Basin forms the eastern part of the Bay of Fundy which splits at Cape Chignecto and is delineated by the massive basalt headlands of Cape Split and Cape d&#x27;Or. The Minas Basin is divided into four sections: (1) the Minas Channel, from the shortest line between Cape Chignecto and the Annapolis Valley Shore to Minas Passage, between Parrsboro and Cape Blomidon; (2) Central Minas Basin, from Minas Passage to the mouth of Cobequid Bay, the shortest line point between Economy and the Noel Shore; (3) Cobequid Bay which extends to the mouth of the Salmon River; and (4) the Southern Bight, from the mouth of the Avon River to the shortest line between Cape Blomidon and the Noel Shore.

Several large rivers drain into the Minas Basin: the Shubenacadie River, Cornwallis River, Avon River, Gaspereau River, and Salmon River. Lesser rivers include the Canard River, Diligent River, Farrell River, and the Debert River. Along the northern edge of the Minas Basin lies a chain of intermittent high-cliffed basaltic bluffs and islands called the Basalt Headlands.

On the northern shore of the Minas Basin, around the Gaspereau River, and around the Salmon River, extensive areas of farmland have been created using dykes with sluices (one-way flow control valves), a form of polderisation.

=== Tides ===
Burntcoat Head, located on the &quot;Noel Shore&quot; along the south side of the Minas Basin, is the location of the highest tidal range ever recorded, exceeding (during a spring tide only) and has one of the highest average tidal ranges every day. The waters of Minas Bay exchange with the main part of the Bay of Fundy through the Minas Channel which flows between Cape Split and Cape Sharp, creating extremely strong tidal currents. Near Cape d&#x27;Or, the turbulent collision of currents is known as the Dory Rips. The water in Minas Basin is a dense and nearly opaque reddish brown due to large amounts of suspended silt which are continually churned by tidal currents. At mid-tide, the currents exceed 8 knots ( per second), and the flow in the deep, -wide channel on the north side of Cape Split equals the combined flow of all the rivers and streams on Earth together (about per hour).

== Communities ==
Several communities border the Minas Basin or the rivers that flow into it. The largest is the town of Truro which lies at the head of Cobequid Bay. Smaller centres include Parrsboro, Wolfville, Windsor and Maitland. Other communities include Great Village, Bass River, Five Islands, Economy, Walton, and Kingsport.

Historically, the north and southern sides of the basin were connected by a succession of ferries, which operated for more than 200 years, from Acadian times to 1941. The last ferry connected Parrsboro, Wolfville, and Kingsport and was called the MV &quot;Kipawo&quot; ferry, whose name was derived from the three communities.

=== Parks ===
Provincial parks at Anthony (near Truro), Five Islands, and Cape Blomidon allow visitors to enjoy and explore the Minas Basin. Community parks interpreting the Basin include the Kingsport waterfront in Kings County; the Walton Lighthouse and Burntcoat Head Lighthouse in Hants County and the Lookout Tower in Economy and the Ottawa House Museum in Parrsboro in Cumberland County.

== History ==

===Settlement===
The Mi&#x27;kmaq were the first people to inhabit the area around the Minas Basin. Mi&#x27;kmaq tradition ties the god Glooscap in with significant geographical features such as Cape Blomidon and Five Islands.

European explorers and traders arrived in the early 1600s. Among them were the French explorer Samuel de Champlain who explored the copper deposits at Cape d&#x27;Or at the entrance to the Basin in 1607. Champlain bestowed the name Port of Mines onto the nearby Advocate Harbour to reflect the seams of copper ore at Cape d&#x27;Or. While the French did not establish a mine, the name &quot;Les Mines&quot; became associated with the upper Bay of Fundy beyond Cape d&#x27;Or which became known as the &quot;Baie des Mines&quot;&#x27;, later Anglicized to Minas Basin.

French Acadian settlements began in the late 1600s first with settlements around the southern shore of the Minas Basin which became known as Les Mines. The Acadians had a particularly significant impact on the area in that they reclaimed considerable farmland through the use of &quot;dykes&quot; and &quot;aboiteaux&quot;. They founded in the area Grand-Pré, Les Mines, Pisiguit, Cobequid, Rivière-aux-Canards, and Beaubassin. Even today their dyke systems—greatly expanded by later additions—are still used near Truro and Wolfville at Port Williams and Grand Pré. In 1755, the British forcibly expelled the over 12,000 Acadians from Grand Pré, Pisiguit, Cobequid, and Beaubassin, in what became known as the Grand Dérangement, or Great Expulsion.

== Demography ==
During the Acadian era, virtually all inhabitants lived in distributed clusters or &quot;villages&quot;, with no single place dominating. The area was administered from Port Royal, later Annapolis Royal. The following table shows the population of the region during the Acadian era:

The vacant Acadian settlements around the Minas Basin were succeeded by the New England Planters who arrived in 1760 and were later joined by Loyalists settlers in the 1780s. The Planters maintained operation of the ferry, rebuilt and expanded the Acadian dyke systems, and reclaimed more farmland from the Basin through projects like the Wellington Dyke in 1816.

==Industry==
The communities around the Minas Basin were sustained by fishing, logging, farming, mining, boat building and shipbuilding. In the late 19th Century the Basin&#x27;s shipyards produced some of the highest numbers of wooden ships in Canadian history and some of the largest, including the ship &quot;William D. Lawrence&quot;, the largest wooden ship built in Canada along with the giant barques &quot;Kings County&quot;, Canada&#x27;s largest four masted-barque and Hamburg, Canada&#x27;s largest three-masted barque. The tidal water also provided a means of transporting commodities such as lumber, apples and gypsum and powered Tide mills at locations such as Canning, Hantsport and Walton.

Mining included gypsum (several locations including Windsor and Cheverie), iron (Londonderry), barite (near Walton and the Eureka Mine at Five Islands), manganese (several locations including Cheverie and Tennycape), and copper (the Colonial Copper Company at Cape d&#x27;Or). Gypsum was shipped from Hantsport until 2009.

There have been attempts to generate energy from the rough waters of Minas Basin. However, the attempts were not successful. 

== Nature ==

Marine mammals include seals and porpoises. Fish include bass, shad, and flounder; lobster, crab, mussel, and clam are common. Many types of seaweed, sponges, worms, seajellys and more are also found. Birds include sandpipers, terns (visitors only), eagles, falcons, seagulls, herons, and kingfishers.

Fossils are found near Parrsboro, Blue Beach and other areas along the Avon River. Rarely, fossils have been found at Evangeline Beach, Burntcoat Head, and other locations. These fossils include various shells (brachiopods, molluscs), sponges, trees, fish, amphibians, reptiles, and dinosaurs. Trace fossils include vertebrate footprints, fish fin-tracks, invertebrate trackways (ex. scorpions at Blue Beach), raindrop imprints, and wave ripples. They range from the beginning of the Carboniferous to the Jurassic. They were deposited when the region was warm and tropical, later when it was covered by a shallow sea, and later still when it was a desert.

Minerals include a variety zeolites from the basalt cliffs at Cape Split, the area around Parrsboro, Five Islands and Cap D&#x27;Or. These include Nova Scotia&#x27;s provincial mineral stilbite, as well as heulandite, analcime, chabazite, gmelinite, natrolite and thomsonite. Other minerals found in the basalts include calcite, magnetite, copper, and quartz (often as amethyst). Beautiful agate is also found. In the sedimentary rocks, gypsum is commonly found at Blomidon, Clarke Head, and near Windsor in both the colorless variety (selenite) and the fibrous variety (satin spar), the latter sometimes being bright orange. Other minerals from the sedimentary rocks include pyrite, calcite, barite, manganite, and pyrolusite. Small amounts of fluorite, celestite, howlite have also been found at Cheverie.

<text>Hawksworth is a small, early twentieth-century council estate in the Kirkstall ward in Leeds, West Yorkshire, England.

It is situated on a hill between West Park and Horsforth and is circled by Butcher Hill, the A65 and Vesper Road. Hawksworth lies within the LS5 Kirkstall postcode area and is commonly known as &quot;The Hawk&quot;, &quot;The Hawky&quot; or &quot;The Hawky Estate&quot;.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Hawksworth&quot; appears to have been given to the estate as recently as its foundation in the twentieth century, and is not covered by the relevant English Place Name Society surveys. The name also belongs to the ancient village of Hawksworth five miles away and may have been transferred to the Hawksworth estate from there.

The name Hawksworth Wood probably refers to the wood that stood to the west of Kirkstall Abbey. It provided shelter, fuel, pannage and building resources such as thatch for the abbey; timber was generally brought from elsewhere since Alexander, the founding abbot of Kirkstall who completed the initial building work, was concerned to preserve the woodland at Hawksworth.

==History==
After the First World War, councils were encouraged to build &#x27;Homes fit for Heroes&#x27;, and by 1930 7,000 new council houses had been built in Leeds, on estates which included the Hawksworth Wood.

The woodland around the Hawksworth estate lies within the framework of the Upper Aire Valley. Parts of these sites were formerly quarried or gleaned for millstone grit but have now reverted to woodland and scrub.

The woodlands are predominantly mixed broadleaves mainly containing oak and sycamore, with the understories consisting of rowan, hazel, holly and guelder rose. Small pockets of heather can also be found. These woodlands provide considerable colour and diversity to this suburban and formerly industrial area and are currently managed to ensure a continuity of multi-aged tree cover. Great Hawksworth has received active management in recent years through the removal of invasive tree species and the promotion of understorey and ground flora.

Another interesting fact concerning the area is that the 1933 Penny of George V, a classic rarity, had been placed under the foundation stone of St. Mary&#x27;s Church in the area. Most accounts indicate that a mere seven pieces were struck for special presentation purposes, and only three currently reside in private collections. In 1933 there was no requirement for the Royal Mint to produce any pennies because there were already enough in circulation. Requests were, however, received for sets of coins dated 1933 to be placed under the foundation stones of buildings erected in that year, and the Mint obliged by striking a small number of coins. The result was to create a rarity that many people thought could turn up in their change.

Reports indicate that in 1970, during construction at Church of St. Cross, Middleton, one of these examples was stolen. In response, the Bishop of Ripon ordered that the St. Mary&#x27;s Church 1933 Penny be unearthed and sold as a protective measure to prevent its theft.

Numerous public rights of way run through the woods which are accessible via Butcher Hill, Hawksworth Road, New Road Side, Abbey Road, Vesper Road, Cragside Walk and Cragside Close.

There is a metal hatch in Hawksworth Woods which is actually the entrance to an old explosives store from when the woods were once quarried for stone. It has been mistaken for a Second World War shelter.

==Facilities==
Hawksworth contains various different stores, including a Co-op, LloydsPharmacy and two small Premier stores. Other facilities include various independent takeaway stores, hairdressing salons and a charity shop.

A Post Office facility was situated on Broadway, however was eventually closed down due to lack of staff willing to operate the premises. An intregreted Premier store has since taken over responsibility of main Post Office functions. However, as of July 2021, the postbox outside the previous Broadway premises still remains in use.

Previously there was a pub on Vesper Road titled The Woodway, however this was closed in the 1990s.

== Education ==

=== Primary Education ===
Hawksworth Wood Primary School is the sole primary school on the estate. The school was split into two during the 1970s into Hawksworth Wood Primary and Vesper Gate Middle School. Vesper Gate Middle School has since been redeveloped into Hawksworth Wood Children&#x27;s Centre. On opening, the children&#x27;s centre included an adult education facility run by Leeds City College however this closed soon after.

=== Secondary Education ===
Hawksworth does not contain any secondary education facilities itself. However, there are numerous secondary schools around the area where residents may attend, including Abbey Grange Church of England Academy, Lawnswood School and Horsforth School.

== Culture ==
An episode of TV series A Touch of Frost named &quot;Held in Trust&quot;, released in 2003, had some scenes filmed at Hawksworth Primary School.

<text>Time Machine is a series of children&#x27;s novels published in the United States by Bantam Books from 1984 to 1989, similar to their more successful &quot;Choose Your Own Adventure&quot; line of &quot;interactive&quot; novels. Each book was written in the second person, with the reader choosing how the story should progress. They were designed by Byron Preiss Visual Publications. 

The main difference between the &quot;Choose Your Own Adventure&quot; series and the &quot;Time Machine&quot; series was that &quot;Time Machine&quot; books featured only one ending, forcing the reader to try many different choices until they discovered it. Also, the series taught children basic history about many diverse subjects, from dinosaurs to World War II. Only the sixth book in the series, &quot;The Rings of Saturn&quot;, departed from actual history; it is set in the future, and features educational content about the solar system. Some books gave the reader their choice from a small list of equipment at the beginning, and this choice would affect events later in the book (e.g. &quot;If you brought the pen knife, turn to page 52, if not turn to page 45.&quot;). Another main difference between the &quot;Time Machine&quot; novels and the &quot;Choose Your Own Adventure&quot; counterparts was hints offered at certain junctures, where the reader was advised to look at hints at the back of the book. An example was in &quot;Mission to World War II&quot; about the Warsaw Ghetto uprising, where the reader was given the choice of starting the mission in the Jewish ghetto or the Aryan part of Warsaw, in which the hint read &quot;Ringelblum was Jewish&quot;, suggesting the reader should begin in the Jewish section of the city, but not ordering it, or it was possible for the hint to be missed.

The line spawned a brief spin-off series for younger readers, the &quot;Time Traveler&quot; novels.

<text>Cobequid Bay is an inlet of the Bay of Fundy and the easternmost part of the Minas Basin, located in the Canadian province of Nova Scotia. The bay was carved by rivers flowing into the eastern end of the Bay of Fundy.

The eastern end of the bay hosts the estuary of the Salmon River, whereas the west end of the bay is less well-defined, typically delineated by Burntcoat Head on the southern shore and Five Islands or Economy Mountain on the northern shore.

The largest tidal range in the world was measured at Burntcoat Head, where average tidal ranges measure a 12.4 m (41 ft) vertical difference in water level between low tide and high tide.

The bay&#x27;s name is derived from the Acadian spelling of We&#x27;kopekwitk, the Mi&#x27;kmaq name for the area. Acadian settlers came to this area in the early 1700s. 

The bay is an Important Bird Area. as well as having tourist spots such as Debert Beach and Masstown Market.

<doc id="926290" wikidata="Q1565648" url="?curid=926290" title="HMS Vanguard (S28)">
<text>The eleventh HMS &quot;Vanguard&quot; of the Royal Navy is the lead boat of her class of Trident ballistic missile-armed submarines. The submarine is based at Faslane, HMNB Clyde, Argyll, Scotland.

&quot;Vanguard&quot; was built at Barrow-in-Furness by Vickers Shipbuilding and Engineering Ltd, later BAE Systems Submarine Solutions, was launched on 4 March 1992, and commissioned on 14 August 1993 in the presence of Diana, Princess of Wales.

==Operational history==
=== Entry into service ===
The submarine&#x27;s first commanding officer was Captain David Russell and the senior engineer officer, during build, was Commander James Grant OBE.

=== Refit ===
In February 2002, &quot;Vanguard&quot; began a two-year refit at HMNB Devonport. The refit was completed in June 2004 and in October 2005, &quot;Vanguard&quot; completed her return to service trials (Demonstration and Shakedown Operations) with the firing of an unarmed Trident missile. During this refit, &quot;Vanguard&quot; was boarded by a pair of anti-nuclear protesters who spent half an hour on board before being challenged. They were charged with damaging a fence which they cut to access the submarine.

=== Collision with &quot;Le Triomphant&quot; ===

On 4 February 2009, &quot;Vanguard&quot; collided with the French submarine in the Atlantic. On February 6 the French Ministry of Armed Forces reported that &quot;Triomphant&quot; had &quot;collided with an immersed object&quot;. The United Kingdom Ministry of Defence initially would not comment on the incident, which was however confirmed on February 16 by First Sea Lord Sir Jonathon Band. &quot;Vanguard&quot; had returned to HMNB Clyde in Scotland under her own power two days prior. Band stated that the collision had occurred at slow speed, and that there had been no injuries. However, both vessels had been damaged. &quot;Vanguard&quot; received damage to the outer casing in the area of the missile compartment, requiring repairs.

=== Overhaul and refueling ===
In January 2012 radiation was detected in the PWR2 test reactor&#x27;s coolant water, caused by a microscopic breach in fuel cladding. This discovery led to &quot;Vanguard&quot; being scheduled to be refuelled in its next &quot;deep maintenance period&quot;, due to last 3.5 years from 2015, and contingency measures being applied to other &quot;Vanguard&quot; and submarines, at a cost of £270 million. This was not revealed to the public until 2014.

Vanguard eventually returned to active service in July 2022 after spending almost 7 years undergoing refit. On 16 August 2022 &quot;Vanguard&quot; was rededicated into the Royal Navy in a ceremony held at HMNB Devonport, and on 9 May 2023 she left for sea.

=== Glued bolts during overhaul ===
In February 2023, the Royal Navy began investigating claims that broken bolts for the reactor chamber on &quot;Vanguard&quot; had insufficiently been repaired using glue, during her seven year refit. After the heads of several bolts had been sheared off after being over-tightened, workers for defence firm Babcock had allegedly glued the heads on the bolts back on, rather than completely replacing the bolts. The glued bolts held insulation in place on the coolant pipes for the nuclear reactor, and were found shortly prior to activation of the reactor.

Defence Secretary Ben Wallace demanded a meeting and “assurances about future work” after The Sun reported on the issue. Babcock is one of the United Kingdom&#x27;s largest defence contractors, with contracts for the maintenance of both the Royal Navy&#x27;s &quot;Astute&quot;-class and &quot;Vanguard&quot;-class submarine fleets. Labour Party shadow secretary of state for defence John Healey stated that &quot;the Defence Secretary must make sure contractors are delivering maintenance to this critical capability safely, on time and on-budget.&quot;.

<text>Ireland Wood is a small residential area in north-west Leeds, West Yorkshire, England named after the Woodland Trust wood which it contains. It is approximately to the north-west of Leeds city centre. It was planned by the Leeds Housing Director, R.A.H. Livett, and won the Ministry Housing medal for 1945-9. An early plan of Ireland Wood in 1950 is shown on the Leodis website .

The estate was constructed throughout the 1950s and provided a refuge from the slum houses in industrial parts of the city which they (along with other similar areas) replaced. This estate is particularly leafy, due to the amount of greenery and woodland surrounding. The area&#x27;s main thoroughfare is the &quot;Otley Old Road&quot;.

It sits in the Weetwood ward of Leeds City Council and Leeds North West parliamentary constituency.

The district is close to the Holt Park, Cookridge and Tinshill areas and the Leeds Ring Road.

==Housing==

Most housing in Ireland Wood is late 1940s concrete, prefabricated housing. This stock is generally in a good condition and has been recently refurbished. There is one block of highrise flats, Beevers Court, situated on Iveson Approach. Most housing in the area is off yellow in colour, but as many houses in the area have been bought by their residents, some owners have painted their houses white. From late 2013 many council houses have seen a repaint, accompanied with new insulation.

Most housing on the estate comprises semi-detached properties with two or three bedrooms. Council housing on nearby estates such as Tinshill and Moor Grange is built with bricks, as opposed to being prefabricated, and so generally fetches a higher price on the property market.
==Amenities==
The area has Ireland Wood Surgery and Pharmacy, three schools, Iveson Primary School, Ireland Wood Primary School and a Catholic primary school called Holy Name School, as well as three parades of shops, the main one on Iveson Approach next to the Beever&#x27;s Court Flats, one on Otley Old Road and a further parade on Raynel Approach which contains Kidz in Kampz charity shop, Best-One Convenience Store and the hair,tanning and beauty salon &#x27;LS Sixteen&#x27;. The row of shops on Otley Old Road contains Ireland Wood Post Office. Holy Name Church (Roman Catholic) and St Paul&#x27;s (Church of England) are both situated on Otley Old Road, the latter at its junction with Raynel Drive. St Paul&#x27;s Church is octagonal in form and its construction was funded by the Leeds Church Extension Society.

==Natural amenities==
Ireland Wood is 7.6 hectares of 50% oak and 20% birch Secondary woodland which has a category A rating for its exceptional popularity. In addition, residents have access to several other woods including Clayton Wood which contains two large ponds and an ancient stone circle, and a large open area of the former Woodside Quarry.
==Transport==
The main bus services with routes through Ireland Wood are the First Bus Sky Line (6), linking the area with Holt Park, Horsforth railway station, Headingley and Leeds city centre and the First Bus Pink Line (19 &amp; 19A) which connects the area with Kirkstall, Burley and Leeds city centre then Colton and Garforth.

<text>Amarah (), also spelled Amara, is a city in south-eastern Iraq, located on a low ridge next to the Tigris River waterway south of Baghdad about 50 km (31 mi) from the border with Iran. It lies at the northern tip of the marshlands between the Tigris and Euphrates.

It had a population of about 340,000 in 2002, 420,000 in 2005, and 1,100,000 in 2020. Amarah is the seat of the Maysan Province. A major trading center for the surrounding agricultural area, the city is known for woven goods and silverware. The staple economic goods produced in northern Amarah are winter cereals such as wheat and barley, as well as animals such as sheep and horses.

==History==

The city was founded in the 1860s as an Ottoman military outpost from which the empire tried to control the warring Banu Lam and Al Bu Muhammad tribes.

In 1915 Amarah was captured by the British. Before the revolution in 1958 Amarah was known for its feudal system with local estate-holders maintaining private militias.

Abdul Rahim al-Rahmani founded the first bookstore in Amarah in 1922, and the city&#x27;s first cinema in 1950.

During the eight-year Iran–Iraq War, the eastern parts of the province became the site of several battles, notably Operation Before the Dawn launched by Iran. Since the Baghdad-Basra highway cut through the province, Iran targeted the area due to its strategic significance to the Iraqis.

After the Persian Gulf War, Amarah was one of many sites during the 1991 uprisings in Iraq against Saddam Hussein. Many insurgents throughout Iraq retreated to safe havens in the Amarah area. Many were killed and crudely buried in a mass grave outside the city. Saddam Hussein also resorted to a crude tactic of draining the marshes surrounding Amarah. Furthermore, Saddam constructed a number of dams in an effort to cut off the water supply to the area.

Throughout the 90&#x27;s, the town&#x27;s population swelled with refugees from the marshes. Saddam Hussein occasionally neglected service to the city in retribution for its role in the uprising. The city also supported the efforts of Moqtada al-Sadr, whose father was also killed by Saddam. In May 1999, Ba&#x27;ath party militias and units of the Special Republican Guard conducted operations in the region. Local resistance forces reportedly repelled the operation.

===Iraq War (2003–2011)===

During the 2003 invasion of Iraq, the city made a final stand as a center of resistance to Saddam Hussein. The city was soon occupied by British forces, which set up two camps. Local residents hired diggers to unearth the bodies in the mass grave after twelve years. However, in June 2003, citizens of Amarah took up arms against patrolling British forces, killing six soldiers each in two separate attacks, south of the City in Majar al-Kabir. The British bases frequently experienced mortar attacks afterward. 

Battle of Amarah: After the British handed power over to the Iraqi government, a power struggle erupted between Shi&#x27;ite loyalists of the Mahdi Army and Badr Brigades. A number of assassinations occurred in the city between the rival factions. According to Sheik Abdul Kareem al-Muhamadawi, the latest dispute between the Shiite militias began after Qassim al-Tamimi, the chief of investigations for the provincial police force and a member of the Badr Organization, was killed in a bombing. Badr fighters blamed the Mahdi Army for the killing. After the brother of Sheikh Fadel al-Bahadli, the Mahdi Army commander in the province, was captured, the Mahdi Army captured least three police stations and other state facilities on October 20, 2006, resulting in at least 22 deaths, three of which were children. 

On June 18, 2008, the Iraqi Army launched a major operation in Amarah to wrest the city from the control of militias loyal to Muqtada al-Sadr and to reduce the flow of weapons and Shiite militants transiting through the city from nearby Iran. The operation, codenamed Promise of Peace (Bashir Al Salem in Arabic), followed significant Iraqi Army operations in Basra, the Sadr City neighborhood of Baghdad, and Mosul in the first half of 2008.

During this time, the 4th Brigade of the US Army&#x27;s 1st Cavalry Division established a semi-permanent presence in the province by constructing two large operating bases in the Province and several smaller company outposts. Specific within 4th Brigade, Amarah and its surrounding towns were covered by 2nd Battalion of the 7th Cavalry Regiment, which established FOB Garryowen just west of the city proper. Throughout 2008 and 2009, over 2,000 US troops from the 1st Cavalry Division partnered with the Iraqi Army, police, and the Border Enforcement Brigade in the Province to defeat Shia extremism and interdict illicit arms smuggling across the Iranian border. Working closely with British investigators and Iraqi police, US troops also successfully detained 11 out of 17 individuals who were wanted for the murder of British soldiers in Majr Al Khabir back in 2003. All 11 suspects faced murder charges in a Baghdad court.

Provincial elections in January 2009 saw a dramatic shift in the balance of power in Amarah and Maysan Province in general. In an election widely recognized as both credible and legitimate, Maysan voters broke the six-year-long grip that Sadrist parties had on power in the Provincial Council resulting in an even split between Sadrist and Islamic Dawa Party affiliates in the council. In May 2009, the PC formally appointed a Dawa Party member to the governorship to replace the radical Sadrist leadership that had held power for years in the Province.

==Notable people==
Lihadh Al-Gazali, professor of clinical genetics, was born in Amarah in 1950

==Climate==
Amarah experiences a hot desert climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;BWh&quot;) with extremely hot and dry summers and cool, wetter winters. On July 31, 2020, a temperature of 53.0 °C (127.4 °F) was recorded.

<doc id="926304" wikidata="Q173643" url="?curid=926304" title="Abbey Road">
<text>Abbey Road is the eleventh studio album by the English rock band the Beatles, released on 26 September 1969, by Apple Records. It is the last album the group recorded, although &quot;Let It Be&quot; (1970) was the last album completed before the band&#x27;s break-up in April 1970. It was mostly recorded in April, July, and August 1969, and topped the record charts in both the United States and the United Kingdom. A double A-side single from the album, &quot;Something&quot; / &quot;Come Together&quot;, was released in October, which also topped the charts in the US.

&quot;Abbey Road&quot; incorporates styles such as rock, pop, blues, and progressive rock, and makes prominent use of the Moog synthesiser and guitar played through a Leslie speaker unit. It is also notable for having a long medley of songs on side two that have subsequently been covered as one suite by other notable artists. The album was recorded in a more collegial atmosphere than the &quot;Get Back&quot; / &quot;Let It Be&quot; sessions earlier in the year, but there were still significant confrontations within the band, particularly over Paul McCartney&#x27;s song &quot;Maxwell&#x27;s Silver Hammer&quot;, and John Lennon did not perform on several tracks. By the time the album was released, Lennon had left the group, though this was not publicly announced until McCartney also quit the following year.

Although &quot;Abbey Road&quot; was an instant commercial success, it received mixed reviews upon release. Some critics found its music inauthentic and criticised the production&#x27;s artificial effects. By contrast, critics today view the album as one of the Beatles&#x27; best and one of the greatest albums of all time. George Harrison&#x27;s two songs on the album, &quot;Something&quot; and &quot;Here Comes the Sun&quot;, are considered among the best he wrote for the group. The album&#x27;s cover, featuring the Beatles walking across the zebra crossing outside of Abbey Road Studios (then officially named EMI Studios), is one of the most famous and imitated of all time.

== Background ==
After the recording sessions for the proposed &quot;Get Back&quot; album, Paul McCartney suggested to producer George Martin that the group get together and make an album &quot;the way we used to do it&quot;, free of the conflict that had begun during sessions for &quot;The Beatles&quot; (also known as the &quot;White Album&quot;). Martin agreed, but on the strict condition that all the group—particularly John Lennon—allow him to produce the record in the same manner as earlier albums and that discipline would be adhered to. No one was sure that the work would be the group&#x27;s last, though George Harrison later recalled that &quot;it felt as if we were reaching the end of the line&quot;.

==Production==

===Recording history===
The first sessions for &quot;Abbey Road&quot; began on 22 February 1969, only three weeks after the &quot;Get Back&quot; sessions, in Trident Studios. There, the group recorded a backing track for &quot;I Want You (She&#x27;s So Heavy)&quot; with Billy Preston accompanying them on Hammond organ. No further group recording occurred until April because of Ringo Starr&#x27;s commitments on the film &quot;The Magic Christian&quot;. After a small amount of work that month and a session for &quot;You Never Give Me Your Money&quot; on 6 May, the group took an eight-week break before recommencing on 2 July. Recording continued through July and August, and the last backing track, for &quot;Because&quot;, was taped on 1 August. Overdubs continued through the month, with the final sequencing of the album coming together on 20 August the last time all four Beatles were present in a studio together.

McCartney, Starr and Martin have reported positive recollections of the sessions, while Harrison said, &quot;we did actually perform like musicians again&quot;. Lennon and McCartney had enjoyed working together on the non-album single &quot;The Ballad of John and Yoko&quot; in April, sharing friendly banter between takes, and some of this camaraderie carried over to the &quot;Abbey Road&quot; sessions. Nevertheless, there was a significant amount of tension in the group. According to Ian MacDonald, McCartney had an acrimonious argument with Lennon during the sessions. Lennon&#x27;s wife Yoko Ono had become a permanent presence at Beatles recordings, and clashed with other members. Halfway through recording in June, Lennon and Ono were involved in a car accident. A doctor told Ono to rest in bed, so Lennon had one installed in the studio so she could observe the recording process from there.

During the sessions, Lennon expressed a desire to have all of his songs on one side of the album, and McCartney&#x27;s on the other. The album&#x27;s two halves represented a compromise: Lennon wanted a traditional release with distinct and unrelated songs, while McCartney and Martin wanted to continue their thematic approach from &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot; by incorporating a medley. Lennon ultimately said that he disliked &quot;Abbey Road&quot; as a whole and felt that it lacked authenticity, calling McCartney&#x27;s contributions &quot;[music] for the grannies to dig&quot; and not &quot;real songs&quot;, and describing the medley as &quot;junk ... just bits of songs thrown together&quot;.

===Technical aspects===

&quot;Abbey Road&quot; was recorded on eight-track reel-to-reel tape machines rather than the four-track machines that were used for earlier Beatles albums such as &quot;Sgt Pepper&quot;, and was the first Beatles album not to be issued in mono anywhere in the world. The album makes prominent use of guitar played through a Leslie speaker, and of the Moog synthesiser. The Moog is not merely used as a background effect but sometimes plays a central role, as in &quot;Because&quot;, where it is used for the middle eight. It is also prominent on &quot;Maxwell&#x27;s Silver Hammer&quot; and &quot;Here Comes the Sun&quot;. The synthesiser was introduced to the band by Harrison, who acquired one in November 1968 and used it to create his album &quot;Electronic Sound&quot;. Starr made more prominent use of the tom-toms on &quot;Abbey Road&quot;, later saying the album was &quot;tom-tom madness ... I went nuts on the toms.&quot;

&quot;Abbey Road&quot; was also the first and only Beatles album to be entirely recorded through a solid-state transistor mixing desk, the TG12345 Mk I, as opposed to earlier tube (thermionic valve)-based REDD desks. The TG console also allowed better support for eight-track recording, facilitating the Beatles&#x27; considerable use of overdubbing. Emerick recalls that the TG desk used to record the album had individual limiters and compressors on each audio channel and noted that the overall sound was &quot;softer&quot; than the earlier tube (valve) desks. In his study of the role of the TG12345 in the Beatles&#x27; sound on &quot;Abbey Road&quot;, the music historian Kenneth Womack observes that &quot;the expansive sound palette and mixing capabilities of the TG12345 enabled George Martin and Geoff Emerick to imbue the Beatles&#x27; sound with greater definition and clarity. The warmth of solid-state recording also afforded their music with brighter tonalities and a deeper low end that distinguished &quot;Abbey Road&quot; from the rest of their corpus, providing listeners with an abiding sense that the Beatles&#x27; final long-player was markedly different.&quot;

Alan Parsons worked as an assistant engineer on the album. He later went on to engineer Pink Floyd&#x27;s landmark album &quot;The Dark Side of the Moon&quot; and produce many popular albums himself with the Alan Parsons Project. John Kurlander also assisted on many of the sessions, and went on to become a successful engineer and producer, most noteworthy for his success on the scores for the &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; film trilogy.

== Songs ==
=== Side one ===

==== &quot;Come Together&quot; ====

&quot;Come Together&quot; was an expansion of &quot;Let&#x27;s Get It Together&quot;, a song Lennon originally wrote for Timothy Leary&#x27;s California gubernatorial campaign against Ronald Reagan. A rough version of the lyrics for &quot;Come Together&quot; was written at Lennon&#x27;s and Ono&#x27;s second bed-in event in Montreal.

The biographer Jonathan Gould suggested that the song has only a single &quot;pariah-like protagonist&quot; and Lennon was &quot;painting another sardonic self-portrait&quot;. MacDonald has suggested that the &quot;juju eyeballs&quot; has been claimed to refer to Dr John and &quot;spinal cracker&quot; to Ono. The song was later the subject of a lawsuit brought against Lennon by Morris Levy because the opening line in &quot;Come Together&quot; – &quot;Here come old flat-top&quot; – was admittedly lifted from a line in Chuck Berry&#x27;s &quot;You Can&#x27;t Catch Me&quot;. A settlement was reached in 1973 in which Lennon promised to record three songs from Levy&#x27;s publishing catalogue for his next album.

&quot;Come Together&quot; was later released as a double A-side single with &quot;Something&quot;. In the liner notes to the compilation album &quot;Love&quot;, Martin described the track as &quot;a simple song but it stands out because of the sheer brilliance of the performers&quot;.

==== &quot;Something&quot; ====
Harrison was inspired to write &quot;Something&quot; during sessions for the White Album by listening to his label-mate James Taylor&#x27;s &quot;Something in the Way She Moves&quot; from his album &quot;James Taylor&quot;. After the lyrics were refined during the &quot;Let It Be&quot; sessions (tapes reveal Lennon giving Harrison some songwriting advice during its composition), the song was initially given to Joe Cocker, but was subsequently recorded for &quot;Abbey Road&quot;. Cocker&#x27;s version appeared on his album &quot;Joe Cocker!&quot; that November.

&quot;Something&quot; was Lennon&#x27;s favourite song on the album, and McCartney considered it the best song Harrison had written. Though the song was written by Harrison, Frank Sinatra once commented that it was his favourite Lennon–McCartney composition and &quot;the greatest love song ever written&quot;. Lennon contributed piano to the recording and while most of the part was removed, traces of it remain in the final cut, notably on the middle eight, before Harrison&#x27;s guitar solo.

The song was issued as a double A-side single with &quot;Come Together&quot; in October 1969 and topped the US charts for one week, becoming the Beatles&#x27; first number-one single that was not a Lennon–McCartney composition. It was also the first Beatles single from an album already released in the UK. Apple&#x27;s Neil Aspinall filmed a promotional video, which combined separate footage of the Beatles and their wives.

==== &quot;Maxwell&#x27;s Silver Hammer&quot; ====

&quot;Maxwell&#x27;s Silver Hammer&quot;, McCartney&#x27;s first song on the album, was first performed by the Beatles during the &quot;Let It Be&quot; sessions (as seen in the film). He wrote the song after the group&#x27;s trip to India in 1968 and wanted to record it for the White Album, but it was rejected by the others as &quot;too complicated&quot;.

The recording was fraught with tension between band members, as McCartney annoyed others by insisting on a perfect performance. The track was the first Lennon was invited to work on following his car accident, but he hated it and declined to do so. According to engineer Geoff Emerick, Lennon said it was &quot;more of Paul&#x27;s granny music&quot; and left the session. He spent the next two weeks with Ono and did not return to the studio until the backing track for &quot;Come Together&quot; was laid down on 21 July. Harrison was also tired of the song, saying &quot;we had to play it over and over again until Paul liked it. It was a real drag&quot;. Starr was more sympathetic to the song. &quot;It was granny music&quot;, he admitted, &quot;but we needed stuff like that on our album so other people would listen to it&quot;. Longtime roadie Mal Evans played the anvil sound in the chorus. This track also makes use of Harrison&#x27;s Moog synthesiser, played by McCartney.

==== &quot;Oh! Darling&quot; ====

&quot;Oh! Darling&quot; was written by McCartney in a doo-wop style, like contemporary work by Frank Zappa. It was tried at the &quot;Get Back&quot; sessions, and a version appears on &quot;Anthology 3&quot;. It was subsequently re-recorded in April, with overdubs in July and August.

McCartney attempted recording the lead vocal only once a day. He said: &quot;I came into the studios early every day for a week to sing it by myself because at first my voice was too clear. I wanted it to sound as though I&#x27;d been performing it on stage all week.&quot; Lennon thought he should have sung it, remarking that it was more his style.

==== &quot;Octopus&#x27;s Garden&quot; ====

As was the case with most of the Beatles&#x27; albums, Starr sang lead vocal on one track. &quot;Octopus&#x27;s Garden&quot; is his second and last solo composition released on any album by the band. It was inspired by a trip with his family to Sardinia aboard Peter Sellers&#x27;s yacht after Starr left the band for two weeks during the sessions for the White Album. Starr received a full songwriting credit and composed most of the lyrics, although the song&#x27;s melodic structure was partly written in the studio by Harrison. The pair would later collaborate as writers on Starr&#x27;s solo singles &quot;It Don&#x27;t Come Easy&quot;, &quot;Back Off Boogaloo&quot; and &quot;Photograph&quot;.

==== &quot;I Want You (She&#x27;s So Heavy)&quot; ====

&quot;I Want You (She&#x27;s So Heavy)&quot; was written by Lennon about his relationship with Ono, and he made a deliberate choice to keep the lyrics simple and concise. Author Tom Maginnis writes that the song had a progressive rock influence, with its unusual length and structure, repeating guitar riff, and white noise effects, though he noted the &quot;I Want You&quot; section has a straightforward blues structure.

The finished song is a combination of two different recording attempts. The first attempt occurred in February 1969, almost immediately after the &quot;Get Back&quot; / &quot;Let It Be&quot; sessions with Billy Preston. This was subsequently combined with a second version made during the &quot;Abbey Road&quot; sessions proper in April. The two sections together ran to nearly eight minutes, making it the Beatles&#x27; second-longest released track. Lennon used Harrison&#x27;s Moog synthesiser with a white noise setting to create a &quot;wind&quot; effect that was overdubbed on the second half of the track. During the final edit, Lennon told Emerick to &quot;cut it right there&quot; at 7 minutes and 44 seconds, creating a sudden, jarring silence that concludes the first side of &quot;Abbey Road&quot; (the recording tape would have run out within 20 seconds as it was). The final mixing and editing of the track occurred on 20 August 1969, the last day on which all four Beatles were together in the studio.

=== Side two ===

==== &quot;Here Comes the Sun&quot; ====

&quot;Here Comes the Sun&quot; was written by Harrison in Eric Clapton&#x27;s garden in Surrey during a break from stressful band business meetings. The basic track was recorded on 7 July 1969. Harrison sang lead and played acoustic guitar, McCartney provided backing vocals and played bass, and Starr played the drums. Lennon was still recovering from his car accident and did not perform on the track. Martin provided an orchestral arrangement in collaboration with Harrison, who overdubbed a Moog synthesiser part on 19 August, immediately before the final mix.

Though not released as a single, the song attracted attention and critical praise, and was included on the compilation &quot;1967–1970&quot;. It has been featured several times on BBC Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;Desert Island Discs&quot;, having been chosen by Sandie Shaw, Jerry Springer, Boris Johnson and Elaine Paige. &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;&#x27;s Martin Chilton said it was &quot;almost impossible not to sing along to&quot;. Since digital downloads have become eligible to chart, it reached number 56 in 2010 after the Beatles&#x27; back catalogue was released on iTunes.

Harrison recorded a guitar solo for this track that did not appear in the final mix. It was rediscovered in 2012, and footage of Martin and Harrison&#x27;s son Dhani listening to it in the studio was released on the DVD of &quot;Living in the Material World&quot;.

==== &quot;Because&quot; ====
&quot;Because&quot; was inspired by Lennon listening to Ono playing Ludwig van Beethoven&#x27;s &quot;Moonlight Sonata&quot; on the piano. He recalled he was &quot;lying on the sofa in our house, listening to Yoko play ... Suddenly, I said, &#x27;Can you play those chords backward?&#x27; She did, and I wrote &#x27;Because&#x27; around them.&quot; The track features three-part harmonies by Lennon, McCartney and Harrison, which were then triple-tracked to give nine voices in the final mix. The group considered the vocals to be some of the hardest and most complex they attempted. Harrison played the Moog synthesiser, and Martin played the harpsichord that opens the track.

==== Medley ====

The remainder of side two consists of a 16-minute medley of eight tracks consisting of a number of short songs and song fragments (known during the recording sessions as &quot;The Long One&quot;), recorded over July and August and blended into a suite by McCartney and Martin. Some songs were written (and originally recorded in demo form) during sessions for the White Album and &quot;Get Back&quot; / &quot;Let It Be&quot;, which later appeared on &quot;Anthology 3&quot;. While the idea for the medley was McCartney&#x27;s, Martin claims credit for some structure, adding he &quot;wanted to get John and Paul to think more seriously about their music&quot;.

The first track recorded for the medley was the opening number, &quot;You Never Give Me Your Money&quot;. McCartney has said the band&#x27;s dispute over Allen Klein and what McCartney viewed as Klein&#x27;s empty promises were the inspiration for the song&#x27;s lyrics. However, MacDonald doubts this, given that the backing track, recorded on 6 May at Olympic Studios, predated the worst altercations between Klein and McCartney. The track is a suite of varying styles, ranging from a piano-led ballad at the start to arpeggiated guitars at the end. Both Harrison and Lennon provided guitar solos, with Lennon playing the solos at the end of the track.

This song transitions into Lennon&#x27;s &quot;Sun King&quot; which, like &quot;Because&quot;, showcases Lennon, McCartney and Harrison&#x27;s triple-tracked harmonies. Following it are Lennon&#x27;s &quot;Mean Mr. Mustard&quot; (written during the Beatles&#x27; 1968 trip to India) and &quot;Polythene Pam&quot;. These in turn are followed by four McCartney songs, &quot;She Came In Through the Bathroom Window&quot; (written after a fan entered McCartney&#x27;s residence via his bathroom window), &quot;Golden Slumbers&quot; (based on Thomas Dekker&#x27;s 17th-century poem set to new music), &quot;Carry That Weight&quot; (reprising elements from &quot;You Never Give Me Your Money&quot;, and featuring chorus vocals from all four Beatles), and closing with &quot;The End&quot;.

&quot;The End&quot; features Starr&#x27;s only drum solo in the Beatles&#x27; catalogue (the drums are mixed across two tracks in &quot;true stereo&quot;, unlike most releases at that time where they were hard-panned left or right). Fifty-four seconds into the song are 18 bars of lead guitar: the first two bars are played by McCartney, the second two by Harrison, and the third two by Lennon, and the sequence is repeated two more times. Harrison suggested the idea of a guitar solo in the track, Lennon decided they should trade solos and McCartney elected to go first. The solos were cut live against the existing backing track in one take. Immediately after Lennon&#x27;s third and final solo, the piano chords of the final part of the song begin. The song ends with the memorable final line, &quot;And in the end, the love you take is equal to the love you make&quot;. This section was taped separately from the first and required the piano to be re-recorded by McCartney, which was done on 18 August. An alternative version of the song, with Harrison&#x27;s lead guitar solo played against McCartney&#x27;s (and Starr&#x27;s drum solo heard in the background), appears on the &quot;Anthology 3&quot; album and the 2012 digital-only compilation album &quot;Tomorrow Never Knows&quot;.

Musicologist Walter Everett interprets that most of the lyrics on side two&#x27;s medley deal with &quot;selfishness and self-gratification – the financial complaints in &#x27;You Never Give Me Your Money,&#x27; the miserliness of Mr. Mustard, the holding back of the pillow in &#x27;Carry That Weight,&#x27; the desire that some second person will visit the singer&#x27;s dreams – perhaps the &#x27;one sweet dream&#x27; of &#x27;You Never Give Me Your Money&#x27;? – in &#x27;The End. Everett adds that the medley&#x27;s &quot;selfish moments&quot; are played in the context of the tonal centre of A, while &quot;generosity&quot; is expressed in songs where C major is central. The medley concludes with a &quot;great compromise in the &#x27;negotiations in &quot;The End&quot;, which serves as a structurally balanced coda. In response to the repeated A-major choruses of &quot;love you&quot;, McCartney sings in realisation that there is as much self-gratifying love (&quot;the love you take&quot;) as there is of the generous love (&quot;the love you make&quot;), in A major and C major, respectively.

==== &quot;Her Majesty&quot; ====

&quot;Her Majesty&quot; was recorded by McCartney on 2 July when he arrived before the rest of the group at Abbey Road. It was originally included in a rough mix of the side two medley (and officially available in this form for the first time on the album&#x27;s 3CD Super Deluxe edition box set), appearing between &quot;Mean Mr. Mustard&quot; and &quot;Polythene Pam&quot;. McCartney disliked the way the medley sounded when it included &quot;Her Majesty&quot;, so he asked for it to be cut. The second engineer, John Kurlander, had been instructed by George Martin not to throw out anything, so after McCartney left, he attached the track to the end of the master tape after 20 seconds of silence. The tape box bore an instruction to leave &quot;Her Majesty&quot; off the final product, but the next day when mastering engineer Malcolm Davies received the tape, he (also trained not to throw anything away) cut a playback lacquer of the whole sequence, including &quot;Her Majesty&quot;. The Beatles liked this effect and included it on the album.

&quot;Her Majesty&quot; opens with the final, crashing chord of &quot;Mean Mr. Mustard&quot;, while the final note remained buried in the mix of &quot;Polythene Pam&quot;, as a result of being snipped off the reel during a rough mix of the medley on 30 July. The medley was subsequently mixed again from scratch although the song was not touched again and still appears in its rough mix on the album.

Original US and UK pressings of &quot;Abbey Road&quot; do not list &quot;Her Majesty&quot; on the album&#x27;s cover nor on the record label, making it a hidden track. The song title appears on the inlay card and disc of the 1987 remastered CD reissue, as track 17. It also appears on the sleeve, booklet and disc of the 2009 remastered CD reissue, but not on the cover or record label of the 2012 vinyl reissue or the 2019 remix of the album.

=== Unreleased material ===
Three days after the session for &quot;I Want You (She&#x27;s So Heavy)&quot;, Harrison recorded solo demos of &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot; (which became the title track of his 1970 triple album), &quot;Something&quot; and &quot;Old Brown Shoe&quot;. The latter was re-recorded by the Beatles in April 1969 and issued as the B-side of &quot;The Ballad of John and Yoko&quot; the following month. All three of these Harrison demos were later featured on &quot;Anthology 3&quot;.

During the sessions for the medley, McCartney recorded &quot;Come and Get It&quot;, playing all the instruments. It was assumed to be a demo recording for another artist but McCartney later said that he originally intended to put it on &quot;Abbey Road&quot;. It was instead covered by Badfinger, while McCartney&#x27;s original recording appeared on &quot;Anthology 3&quot;.

The original backing track to &quot;Something&quot;, featuring a piano-led coda, and &quot;You Never Give Me Your Money&quot;, which leads into a fast rock-n-roll jam session, have appeared on bootlegs.

== Cover photo ==
Apple Records creative director Kosh designed the album cover. It is the only original UK Beatles album sleeve to show neither the artist name nor the album title on its front cover. EMI believed that the record would not sell without this information, but Kosh said that &quot;we didn&#x27;t need to write the band&#x27;s name on the cover [...] They were the most famous band in the world&quot;. The front cover was a photograph of the group walking on a zebra crossing, based on ideas that McCartney sketched, and taken on 8 August 1969 outside EMI Studios on Abbey Road. At 11:35 that morning, photographer Iain Macmillan was given ten minutes to take the photo while he stood on a step-ladder and a policeman held up traffic behind the camera. Macmillan took six photographs, which McCartney examined with a magnifying glass before deciding which would be used on the album sleeve.

In the image selected by McCartney, the group walk across the street in single file from left to right, with Lennon leading, followed by Starr, McCartney and Harrison. McCartney is barefoot and out of step with the others. Except for Harrison, the group are wearing suits designed by Tommy Nutter. A white Volkswagen Beetle is to the left of the picture, parked next to the zebra crossing, which belonged to one of the people living in the block of flats across from the recording studio. After the album was released, the number plate (LMW 281F) was repeatedly stolen from the car. In 2004, news sources published a claim made by retired American salesman Paul Cole that he was the man standing on the pavement to the right of the picture.

==Release==
In mid-1969, Lennon formed a new group, the Plastic Ono Band, in part because the Beatles had rejected his song &quot;Cold Turkey&quot;. While Harrison worked with such artists as Leon Russell, Doris Troy, Preston and Delaney &amp; Bonnie through to the end of the year, McCartney took a hiatus from the group after his daughter Mary was born on 28 August. On 20 September, six days before &quot;Abbey Road&quot; was released, Lennon told McCartney, Starr, and business manager Allen Klein (Harrison was not present) that he &quot;wanted a divorce&quot; from the group. Apple released &quot;Something&quot; backed with &quot;Come Together&quot; in the US on 6 October 1969. Release of the single in the UK followed on 31 October, while Lennon released the Plastic Ono Band&#x27;s &quot;Cold Turkey&quot; the same month.

The Beatles did little promotion of &quot;Abbey Road&quot; directly, and no public announcement was made of the band&#x27;s split until McCartney announced he was leaving the group in April 1970. By this time, the &quot;Get Back&quot; project (by now retitled &quot;Let It Be&quot;) had been re-examined, with overdubs and mixing sessions continuing into 1970. Therefore, &quot;Let It Be&quot; became the last album to be finished and released by the Beatles, although its recording had begun before &quot;Abbey Road&quot;.

&quot;Abbey Road&quot; sold four million copies in its first two months of release. In the UK, the album debuted at number one, where it remained for 11 weeks before being displaced for one week by the Rolling Stones&#x27; &quot;Let It Bleed&quot;. The following week (which was Christmas), &quot;Abbey Road&quot; returned to the top for another six weeks (completing a total of 17 weeks) before being displaced by Led Zeppelin&#x27;s &quot;Led Zeppelin II&quot;. Altogether, it spent 81 weeks on the UK albums chart. The album also performed strongly overseas. In the US, it spent 11 weeks at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top LPs chart. It was the National Association of Recording Merchandisers (NARM) best-selling album of 1969. In Japan, it was one of the longest-charting albums to date, remaining in the top 100 for 298 weeks during the 1970s.

== Critical reception ==
=== Contemporary ===
&quot;Abbey Road&quot; initially received mixed reviews from music critics, who criticised the production&#x27;s artificial sounds and viewed its music as inauthentic. William Mann of &quot;The Times&quot; said that the album will &quot;be called gimmicky by people who want a record to sound exactly like a live performance&quot;, although he considered it to be &quot;teem[ing] with musical invention&quot; and added: &quot;Nice as &#x27;Come Together&#x27; and Harrison&#x27;s &#x27;Something&#x27; are – they are minor pleasures in the context of the whole disc ... Side Two is marvellous ...&quot; Ed Ward of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; called the album &quot;complicated instead of complex&quot; and felt that the Moog synthesiser &quot;disembodies and artificializes&quot; the band&#x27;s sound, adding that they &quot;create a sound that could not possibly exist outside the studio&quot;. While he found the medley on side two to be their &quot;most impressive music&quot; since &quot;Rubber Soul&quot;, Nik Cohn of &quot;The New York Times&quot; said that, &quot;individually&quot;, the album&#x27;s songs are &quot;nothing special&quot;. Albert Goldman of &quot;Life&quot; magazine wrote that &quot;Abbey Road&quot; &quot;is not one of the Beatles&#x27; great albums&quot; and, despite some &quot;lovely&quot; phrases and &quot;stirring&quot; segues, side two&#x27;s suite &quot;seems symbolic of the Beatles&#x27; latest phase, which might be described as the round-the-clock production of disposable music effects&quot;. John Gabree of the magazine &quot;High Fidelity&quot; wrote, of the album, &quot;what&#x27;s to say? If you like the Beatles, you&#x27;ll like the record. If you have your doubts, this will do nothing to allay them. Of course, as someone just said, they do have &#x27;something.&#x27;&quot;

Conversely, Chris Welch wrote in &quot;Melody Maker&quot;: &quot;the truth is, their latest LP is just a natural born gas, entirely free of pretension, deep meanings or symbolism ... While production is simple compared to past intricacies, it is still extremely sophisticated and inventive.&quot; Derek Jewell of &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; found the album &quot;refreshingly terse and unpretentious&quot;, and although he lamented the band&#x27;s &quot;cod-1920s jokes (Maxwell&#x27;s Silver Hammer) and ... Ringo&#x27;s obligatory nursery arias (Octopus&#x27;s Garden)&quot;, he considered that &quot;Abbey Road&quot; &quot;touches higher peaks than did their last album&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fricke/Mojo&quot;&gt;Fricke, David (2003). &quot;Road to Nowhere&quot;. In &quot;Mojo: The Beatles&#x27; Final Years Special Edition&quot;. London: Emap. p. 112.&lt;/ref&gt; John Mendelsohn, writing for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, called it &quot;breathtakingly recorded&quot; and praised side two especially, equating it to &quot;the whole of &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot;&quot; and stating, &quot;That the Beatles can unify seemingly countless musical fragments and lyrical doodlings into a uniformly wonderful suite ... seems potent testimony that no, they&#x27;ve far from lost it, and no, they haven&#x27;t stopped trying.&quot; Don Heckman of &quot;Stereo Review&quot; named the album one of the &quot;Best Recordings of the Month&quot; of January 1970, remarking that it was &quot;better than &#x27;The Beatles&#x27; or &#x27;Magical Mystery Tour,&#x27; and probably the equal of &#x27;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;&quot;, adding, &quot;I suppose I haven&#x27;t really come up with any new compliments for the Beatles-not that they need them. But I hope I have at least persuaded you to hear &#x27;Abbey Road.&#x27; You&#x27;ll find it a happy experience.&quot;

While covering the Rolling Stones&#x27; 1969 American tour for &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, Robert Christgau reported from a meeting with Greil Marcus in Berkeley that &quot;opinion has shifted against the Beatles. Everyone is putting down &quot;Abbey Road&quot;.&quot; Shortly afterwards, in Los Angeles, he wrote that his colleague Ellen Willis had grown to love the record, adding: &quot;Damned if she isn&#x27;t right – flawed but fine. Because the world is round it turns her on. Charlie Watts tells us he likes it too.&quot;

=== Retrospective ===

Many critics have since cited &quot;Abbey Road&quot; as the Beatles&#x27; greatest album. In a retrospective review, Nicole Pensiero of &quot;PopMatters&quot; called it &quot;an amazingly cohesive piece of music, innovative and timeless&quot;. Mark Kemp of &quot;Paste&quot; viewed the album as being &quot;among the Beatles&#x27; finest works, even if it foreshadows the cigarette-lighter-waving arena rock that technically skilled but critically maligned artists from Journey to Meatloaf would belabor throughout the &#x27;70s and &#x27;80s&quot;. Neil McCormick of &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; dubbed it the Beatles&#x27; &quot;last love letter to the world&quot; and praised its &quot;big, modern sound&quot;, calling it &quot;lush, rich, smooth, epic, emotional and utterly gorgeous&quot;.

AllMusic&#x27;s Richie Unterberger felt that the album shared &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot;″s &quot;faux-conceptual forms&quot;, but had &quot;stronger compositions&quot;, and wrote of its standing in the band&#x27;s catalogue: &quot;Whether &quot;Abbey Road&quot; is the Beatles&#x27; best work is debatable, but it&#x27;s certainly the most immaculately produced (with the possible exception of &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot;) and most tightly constructed.&quot; Ian MacDonald gave a mixed opinion of the album, noting that several tracks had been written at least a year previously, and would possibly have been unsuitable without being integrated into the medley on side two. He did, however, praise the production, particularly the sound of Starr&#x27;s bass drum.

&quot;Abbey Road&quot; has received high rankings in several &quot;greatest albums of all time&quot; lists and polls by critics and publications. It was voted number 8 in the third edition of Colin Larkin&#x27;s book &quot;All Time Top 1000 Albums&quot; (2000). &quot;Time&quot; included it in their 2006 list of the All-Time 100 Albums. In 2009, readers of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; named &quot;Abbey Road&quot; the greatest Beatles album. In 2020, the magazine ranked the album at number 5 on its list of the &quot;500 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot;, the highest Beatles record on the list; a previous version of the list from 2012 had ranked it at number 14. The album was also included in the book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;.

==Legacy==
=== Abbey Road crossing and &quot;Paul is dead&quot; ===

The front cover image of the Beatles on the Abbey Road crossing has become one of the most famous and imitated in recording history. The crossing is a popular destination for Beatles fans, and a webcam has operated there since 2011. In December 2010, the crossing was given grade II listed status for its &quot;cultural and historical importance&quot;; the Abbey Road studios themselves had been given similar status earlier in the year.

Shortly after the album&#x27;s release, the cover became part of the &quot;Paul is dead&quot; conspiracy theory that was spreading across college campuses in the US. According to followers of the rumour, the cover depicted the Beatles walking out of a cemetery in a funeral procession. The procession was led by Lennon dressed in white as a religious figure; Starr was dressed in black as the undertaker; McCartney, out of step with the others, was a barefoot corpse; and Harrison dressed in denim was the gravedigger. The left-handed McCartney is holding a cigarette in his right hand, indicating that he is an impostor, and part of the number plate on the Volkswagen parked on the street is 281F (misread as 28IF), meaning that McCartney would have been 28 if he had lived – despite the fact that he was only 27 at the time of the photo and subsequent release of the record. The escalation of the &quot;Paul is dead&quot; rumour became the subject of intense analysis on mainstream radio and contributed to &quot;Abbey Road&quot;″s commercial success in the US. Lennon was interviewed in London by New York&#x27;s WMCA, and he ridiculed the rumour but conceded that it was invaluable publicity for the album.

The cover image has been parodied on several occasions, including by Booker T. &amp; the M.G.&#x27;s &quot;McLemore Avenue&quot; (1970), Kanye West&#x27;s &quot;Late Orchestration&quot; (2006) and by McCartney on his 1993 live album &quot;Paul Is Live&quot;. On the cover of its October 1977 issue, the satirical magazine &quot;National Lampoon&quot; depicted the four Beatles flattened along the zebra crossing, with a road roller driving away up the street. The Red Hot Chili Peppers&#x27; &quot;The Abbey Road E.P.&quot; parodies the cover, with the band walking near-naked across a similar zebra crossing. In 2003, several US poster companies airbrushed McCartney&#x27;s cigarette out of the image without permission from Apple or McCartney. In 2013, Kolkata Police launched a traffic safety awareness advertisement against jaywalking, using the cover and a caption that read: &quot;If they can, why can&#x27;t you?&quot; &quot;Yesterday&quot; (2019) is about a musician who suddenly finds himself as the only person who remembers the Beatles and becomes famous for performing their songs. One of the film&#x27;s posters depicts him walking on a similar zebra crossing, alone.

=== Cover versions and influence===
The songs on &quot;Abbey Road&quot; have been covered many times and the album itself has been covered in its entirety. One month after &quot;Abbey Road&quot;″s release, George Benson recorded a cover version of the album called &quot;The Other Side of Abbey Road&quot;. Later in 1969 Booker T. &amp; the M.G.&#x27;s recorded &quot;McLemore Avenue&quot; (the location in Memphis of Stax Records) which covered the &quot;Abbey Road&quot; songs and had a similar cover photo.

While matching albums such as &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; in terms of popularity, &quot;Abbey Road&quot; failed to repeat the Beatles&#x27; earlier achievements in galvanising their rivals to imitate them. In author Peter Doggett&#x27;s description, &quot;Too contrived for the rock underground to copy, too complex for the bubblegum pop brigade to copy, the album influenced no one – except [Paul McCartney]&quot;, who spent years trying to emulate its scope in his solo career. Writing for &quot;Classic Rock&quot; in 2014, Jon Anderson of the progressive rock band Yes said his group were constantly influenced by the Beatles from &quot;Revolver&quot; onwards, but it was the feeling that side two was &quot;one complete idea&quot; that inspired him to create long-form pieces of music.&lt;ref name=&quot;Anderson/CR&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Several artists have covered some or all of the side-two medley, including Phil Collins (for the Martin/Beatles tribute album &quot;In My Life&quot;), The String Cheese Incident, Transatlantic and Tenacious D (who performed the medley with Phish keyboardist Page McConnell). Furthur, a jam band including former Grateful Dead members Bob Weir and Phil Lesh, played the entire &quot;Abbey Road&quot; album during its Spring Tour 2011. It began with a &quot;Come Together&quot; opener at Boston on 4 March and ended with the entire medley in New York City on 15 March, including &quot;Her Majesty&quot; as an encore.

=== Continued sales and reissues ===

In June 1970, Allen Klein reported that &quot;Abbey Road&quot; was the Beatles&#x27; best-selling album in the US with sales of about five million. By 1992, &quot;Abbey Road&quot; had sold nine million copies. The album became the ninth-most downloaded on the iTunes Store a week after it was released there on 16 November 2010. A CNN report stated it was the best-selling vinyl album of 2011. It is the first album from the 1960s to sell over five million albums since 1991 when Nielsen SoundScan began tracking sales. In the US, the album had sold 7,177,797 copies by the end of the 1970s. , the album had sold over 31 million copies worldwide and is one of the band&#x27;s best-selling albums. In October 2019, &quot;Abbey Road&quot; re-entered the UK charts, again hitting number one.

&quot;Abbey Road&quot; has remained in print since its first release in 1969. The original album was released on 26 September in the UK and 1 October in the US on Apple Records. It was reissued as a limited edition picture disc on vinyl in the US by Capitol on 27 December 1978, while a CD reissue of the album was released in 1987, with a remastered version appearing in 2009. The remaster included additional photographs with additional liner notes and the first, limited edition, run also included a short documentary about the making of the album.

In 2001, &quot;Abbey Road&quot; was certified 12× platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). The album continues to be reissued on vinyl. It was included as part of the Beatles&#x27; &quot;Collector&#x27;s Crate&quot; series in September 2009 and saw a remastered LP release on 180-gram vinyl in 2012.

A super deluxe version of the album, which featured new mixes by Giles Martin, was released in September 2019 to celebrate the original album&#x27;s 50th anniversary.

As of October 2019, &quot;Abbey Road&quot; has sold 2,240,608 pure sales in the United Kingdom with all consumed sales standing at 2,327,230 units. Post 1994 sales stand at 827,329.

<text>Theodore Moody Berry (November 8, 1905 – October 15, 2000) was an American politician of the Charter Party of Cincinnati, Ohio and was the first African-American mayor of Cincinnati, Ohio.

==Early life and education==
Born in poverty in Maysville, Kentucky, on November 8, 1905, Ted Berry overcame great obstacles to achieve personal success and gain a national reputation as a leader in the Civil Rights Movement. He graduated from Woodward High School in 1924 and served as class valedictorian, the first African American to hold that honor in Cincinnati. In his senior year, he won an essay contest with an entry submitted under the pseudonym Thomas Playfair after an all-white panel had rejected his initial entry. Berry worked at steel mills in Newport, Kentucky, to pay tuition at the University of Cincinnati and then at its law school.

==Legal career==
Berry was admitted to the Ohio Bar in 1932. He served as president of the Cincinnati branch of the NAACP from 1932 to 1946. In 1938 he was appointed the first black assistant prosecuting attorney for Hamilton County.

===Military service===
During World War II, Berry worked in the Office of War Information as a morale officer. The job took him to Washington, D.C., and also caused him to change his political affiliation from Republican to Democrat. In 1945, Berry defended three black Army Air Force officers, members of the Tuskegee Airmen, who had protested a segregated officer&#x27;s club in Indiana. He won acquittal for two of the men. In 1995, the Air Force pardoned the third who had been convicted.

===NAACP service===
From 1947 to 1961, Berry served on the NAACP Ohio Committee for Civil Rights Legislation where he worked on equal employment and fair housing issues. He was also involved with the Urban League of Greater Cincinnati.

===Political career===
He began his Cincinnati political career in 1947 when he ran for City Council. He lost that year but won in 1949. He was chairman of the finance committee in 1953 and led a controversial battle to create a city income tax. In 1955 he was elected vice mayor. His 1963 political campaign to return to Cincinnati&#x27;s City Council was chaired by Rev. L. Venchael Booth. His creation of the Community Action Commission in Cincinnati caught the attention of Sargent Shriver. In 1965 President Lyndon Johnson appointed Berry to head the Office of Economic Opportunity&#x27;s Community Action Programs that included Head Start, the Job Corps and Legal Services. Berry returned to Cincinnati in 1969 and was appointed to City Council in 1971. He was elected mayor in 1972 and served for four years—Cincinnati&#x27;s first African-American mayor. In the 1980s and 1990s, Berry struggled to return proportional representation to Cincinnati because he firmly believed that it gave a fair share of power to Black voters.

==Death and legacy==

Berry died at the age of 94 on October 15, 2000. Other prominent black Cincinnatians such as Marian Spencer and Judge Nathaniel R. Jones considered Ted Berry a role model. The city of Cincinnati has named both a street and a park after Berry.

==Associations and awards==
Mayor Berry was a Prince Hall Freemason and a member of Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity, Alpha Alpha chapter. He was one of the founders that helped charter Alpha Rho Lambda chapter, December 21, 1929, in Columbus, Ohio. In 1979, the NAACP honored Berry by awarding him the William Robert Ming Advocacy Award for the spirit of financial and personal sacrifice displayed in his legal work.

<text>Sheepscar is an inner city district of Leeds in West Yorkshire England, lying to the north east of Leeds city centre. The district is in the City of Leeds Metropolitan Council. It is overlooked by the tower blocks of Little London and Lovell Park to the west, and gives way to Meanwood in the north-west, Chapeltown in the north-east and Burmantofts in the east.

Clay Pit Lane runs through Sheepscar to the south, while Scott Hall Road makes up the eastern border. The area consists of complex road junctions, Penraevon Industrial Estate and a number of warehouses thanks to the impressive transport links attractive to haulage companies. There are a number of upmarket car showrooms such as Jaguar Land Rover and Volvo.

The former public library building survives, and was the Leeds base for the West Yorkshire Archive Service, but closed some years ago. now a Games studio.

Throughout the winter months, Sheepscar is notable for its large gasholder. This is completely invisible throughout the summer as its storage tank is below ground. The second and older spiral guided gasholder was removed some years ago. Sheepscar gasholder station is the only one in Leeds never to have been used as a Gas Works.

==Sheepscar Interchange==
Sheepscar is most notable for the Sheepscar Interchange where north Leeds&#x27; local roads meet. The A58 (road to Wetherby) and the Inner Ring Road and A61 (road to Harrogate) and Leeds city centre meet here. Both carry very large volumes of traffic, particularly at peak hours. It was because of this that the Sheepscar Interchange was constructed in the 1960s. The A58 carries less traffic than it did previously due to traffic using A1-M1 link.

The areas Sheepscar, Little London and Lovell Park are generally all referred to as either Sheepscar or Little London, Lovell Park being seen as an area of Little London. Sheepscar is an industrial area, while Little London and Lovell Park are residential.

Sheepscar Tannery was the largest tannery in the country in 1893, when it was run by John Joseph Willson of Willson, Walker &amp; Co.

<doc id="926311" wikidata="Q1639184" url="?curid=926311" title="José de Escandón, 1st Count of Sierra Gorda">
<text>José de Escandón y Helguera, conde de Sierra (May 19, 1700, Soto de la Marina, Cantabria, Spain – September 10, 1770, Querétaro, New Spain) was a Spanish Indian-fighter in New Spain and the founder and first governor of the colony of Nuevo Santander, which extended from the Pánuco River in the modern-day Mexican state of Tamaulipas to the Guadalupe River in the modern-day U.S. state of Texas.

==Military career before Nuevo Santander==
Escandón was one of three sons of Juan de Escandón and Francisca de la Helguera. He arrived in New Spain as a child in 1715. He volunteered to serve as a cadet in the cavalry of the city of Mérida, Aadi where he fought against the English at Laguna de Términos. For his valor, he was promoted to lieutenant and posted to Querétaro. There he fought in the wars against the Apaches. In Querétaro he learned to treat the Indians &quot;como amigos, con mano suave, y como enemigos, con rigor implacable&quot; (as friends, with a soft hand, and as enemies, with implacable rigor).

In 1727 he pacified the Pames, who had revolted in Celaya, and was promoted to sergeant mayor of the regiment. In 1732 he subdued rebels at the mines in Guanajuato, and the following year he did the same at Irapuato. In 1734 he pacified 10,000 Indian rebels at San Miguel el Grande. For these accomplishments, he was promoted to colonel and assigned as an aide to the captain general of the Sierra Gorda.

In 1742 he was transferred from Querétaro to Veracruz, which was threatened by the English, but upon his arrival he received orders to return to Tehuacán. In 1749 he pacified disturbances in Querétaro that resulted from a famine following a drought. Several times he visited the missions in the Sierra Gorda, introducing reforms in the administration. He also fought against the Tamaulipecos who were devastating the region of Nuevo León.

==Colonization of Nuevo Santander==
In the late 1740s New Spain, because of encroachments of the French from Louisiana and the English along the Gulf coast, decided that they would have to complete the conquest of the Seno Mexicano (the Gulf coast, especially Tamaulipas and Texas). A council of war meeting was held to consider this project, from May 8, 1748, to May 13. Various officers presented plans, and that of José de Escandón was chosen as the most comprehensive.

Escandón had already financed an expedition to the region and thus was in a position to choose sites for settlement. He proposed the name &quot;Nuevo Santander&quot;. He also proposed a budget of 115,000 pesos for the new expedition, plus 500 pesos for each colonist. Upon the acceptance of Escandón&#x27;s plan, it was advertised in Querétaro, San Luis Potosí, Charcas, Huasteca, Nuevo León and Coahuila, and very quickly attracted the intended number of colonists.

Between December 25, 1748, the date of the foundation of Llera, and 1755, he founded over twenty towns or villages and a number of missions in the colony, including Santander, Soto la Marina, Güemes, Camargo, Reynosa, Mier, and Revilla south of the Rio Grande, and Laredo and Nuestra Señora de los Dolores hacienda north of the Rio Grande. Escandón is sometimes referred to as the &quot;father of the lower Rio Grande Valley&quot;.

==As governor of Nuevo Santander==
For his firmness and energy, he was also known as the &quot;Exterminator of the Pames of Querétaro&quot;. In Nuevo Santander he was accused of murdering the Indians and taking slaves. He faced a court case where he was charged with illegally using Indian labor in his textile mills and using the port of Santander to bring in English contraband. However, in the period 1770-1775 there were more than twice as many deaths among the Indians as in the 22 years he governed.

Among his enemies in the region were the Jesuits, the French and the secular clergy.

He accumulated vast wealth during his stay in Querétaro, San Miguel and Nuevo Santander from the work of badly paid Indians and slaves, as well as large land grants from the viceroys. The livestock and other products of his lands, as well as the goods he bought from the colonists, were shipped from the port of Soto la Marina along the coast to Veracruz in a frigate he owned.

He was considered one of the great statesmen of New Spain in the eighteenth century, superior to many of the viceroys. He assigned activities and crops to each settlement, stimulated irrigation and constructed roads and bridges. He built a grand mansion in Santander, capital of the colony, known as the &quot;Palace of the Count&quot;. He also built the church at Santander and a reservoir for drinking water. He brought in masons, carpenters and blacksmiths from Tacubaya and established kilns as well as sugar and flour mills.

To reward him for his services, the Crown granted him the title of &quot;conde de Sierra Gorda&quot;, free of lanzas (duty imposed on noblemen in lieu of military service) and media anata (tax paid on assuming office).

He died forgotten in 1770, probably on September 10, in Quetétero or Mexico City. Five years later he was exonerated of the legal charges against him, and rehabilitated. The title passed to his eldest son, Manuel. Manuel died without descendants, and the second son of José, Mariano, became count.

Ciudad Victoria, now the capital of the state of Tamaulipas, erected a statue to his memory in 1975. There are also streets named for him there and in Querétaro. In Laredo, Texas, the Festival de Música José de Escandón is celebrated annually in November. There is also a statue dedicated to him in Alice, Texas.
A statue was dedicated to Jose de Escandon in 2014. It is located at the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley in Edinburg, Texas.

<doc id="926313" wikidata="Q11321326" url="?curid=926313" title="Tony Clark">
<text>Anthony Christopher Clark (born June 15, 1972) is an American professional baseball player and executive. He played in Major League Baseball as a first baseman from 1995 to 2009 and is the sixth executive director of the Major League Baseball Players Association (MLBPA), a position he has held since 2013.

Clark had his best years with the Detroit Tigers (1995–2001), but also played on the Boston Red Sox, New York Mets, New York Yankees, Arizona Diamondbacks, and San Diego Padres during a 15-year career that ended in 2009. He was a switch hitter, and threw right-handed. He was third in Rookie of the Year voting in 1996, and was an All Star in 2001.

Clark was a union representative while he was a player, and after retiring he joined the staff of the MLBPA in 2010. He served as deputy executive director and acting executive director of the union before he was appointed executive director in December 2013, upon the death of Michael Weiner. Clark is the first former player to be executive director of the MLBPA.

==Amateur career==
Clark prepped at Valhalla High School in El Cajon, California, but after going out to dinner with principal Ed Giles and others, Clark transferred to nearby Christian High School. He averaged 43.7 points per game in basketball in his senior season.

Clark played college basketball at the University of Arizona and San Diego State University, where he was the San Diego State Aztecs&#x27; top scorer with 11.5 points per game in 1991–92. Clark left college (and ended his basketball career) without finishing his business administration degree in order to focus on baseball.

==Professional baseball career==
In a 15-year career, Clark hit .262 with 251 home runs and 824 run batted in (RBIs) in 1,559 games played.

===Detroit Tigers===
The Detroit Tigers selected Clark out of high school with the second overall pick in the 1990 MLB draft. He played in Minor League Baseball while attending college and playing college basketball.

He was third in Rookie of the Year voting in 1996 when he hit .250 with 27 home runs.

His most productive seasons were 1997, with 32 HRs and 117 RBIs (10 errors at first base), 1998, with 34 HRs and 103 RBIs (13 errors at first), and 1999, with 31 HRs and 99 RBIs (10 errors at first).

Clark was selected an All-Star in 2001.

===Boston Red Sox and New York Mets===
With Clark eligible for salary arbitration and expected to earn $7 million for the 2002 season, the Tigers placed Clark on waivers, and he was claimed by the Boston Red Sox. In 2002, Clark hit only .207 with 29 RBIs and three HRs for Boston in 90 games, with a career-low .291 slugging percentage. A free agent after the 2002 season, Clark signed a one-year contract with the New York Mets for the 2003 season. In 2003, he batted .232 for the Mets.

===New York Yankees===
Signed as a bench player, Clark filled in for the New York Yankees in 2004 after Jason Giambi was forced out of the lineup because of an injury, though he was replaced as the main first baseman by John Olerud late in the season. During an August 28 game, Clark hit a career-high three home runs in an 18–6 rout of the Blue Jays in Toronto.

===Arizona Diamondbacks===

Clark signed with the Arizona Diamondbacks after the 2004 season. In a limited role (349 at bats) in the 2005 season, he hit .307 with 30 home runs, and 87 RBIs.

In 2006, Clark was injured for most of the season. Although he tried to play through a shoulder injury that required significant surgery to repair, he batted a career-low .197, with a career-low .279 on-base percentage, in 132 at-bats. He struggled especially against right-handers, batting .125 against them. In 2007, Clark shared first base with Conor Jackson. He played in 113 games and batted .249.

===San Diego Padres===
After the season, his contract was up and on February 10, 2008, Clark agreed to a one-year contract worth $900,000 with the San Diego Padres. On July 17, 2008, he was traded back to the Diamondbacks for minor league pitcher Evan Scribner. In order to complete the trade, Clark waived a clause under his contract with the Padres pursuant to which he was to receive $500,000 from the Padres if traded.

In 2008, between the two teams, Clark batted .225 with a .318 slugging percentage. Clark struck out more than a third of the time, with 55 strikeouts in 151 at-bats. He struggled especially against right-handers, batting .198 against them.

===Return to Arizona===
Clark filed for free agency after the 2008 season. On January 2, 2009, he signed a one-year deal worth $800,000 to remain with the Diamondbacks.

Clark had a startling good performance on Opening Day 2009, hitting 2 home runs to lead the D-Backs to a victory over the Colorado Rockies; fellow switch-hitting teammate Felipe López also homered from both sides of the plate in the same game, making them the first teammates to do so on an Opening Day.

Clark slumped badly thereafter, however, as in his next 18 at-bats he only managed to eke out a single. As of May 6 he was batting .179, and had struck out in more than half his at bats. That day Clark was placed on the 15-day disabled list for a lingering wrist ligament injury, and Josh Whitesell, who was hitting .356 for the Reno Aces with a .477 on-base percentage, was called up to the Diamondbacks to take his place. Clark suffered the injury during spring training, and re-aggravated it in late April, leaving him unable to swing comfortably from the left side. It was anticipated that the injury could require more than 15 days to heal.

On June 19 Clark came off the disabled list and returned to Arizona (after a rehab assignment at Reno in which he batted .160, and during which he turned 37), and Whitesell was optioned back to Reno (after batting .300 with a .447 on-base percentage in his second stint with the team). In his first game back with the team, Clark went 0–3 with 2 strikeouts to bring his batting average down to .161, with strikeouts in 55% of his at bats for the season.

Clark struggled on defense as well, as on June 21 in his second game back he dropped a throw to him at first base with two outs in the ninth, allowing the winning run to score for Seattle. The play left players and managers on both sides stunned and speechless. &quot;It&#x27;s a miserable ending to a rough road trip&quot;, manager A. J. Hinch said. His resulting .973 fielding percentage was last among major league first basemen who had played 60 or more innings.

On July 12, 2009, the Diamondbacks released Clark, who was hitting .182 with four home runs and 11 RBIs. They replaced him with Whitesell. Clark said he would continue to work out the next few weeks in the event an opportunity might arise with another team, and that if he didn&#x27;t land with another team he&#x27;d consider broadcasting and coaching, perhaps with the Diamondbacks. Diamondbacks General Manager Josh Byrnes expressed an interest in keeping him with the organization, and Clark said he &quot;would welcome the opportunity.&quot;

===Post-Season===
Clark played in four post-season series through 2008, two each for the Yankees and the Diamondbacks. In aggregate, he batted .135, with a .158 on-base percentage and a .189 slugging percentage, and drove in one run in 37 at-bats.

==MLB Players Association==

Throughout his playing career, Clark was involved in the Major League Baseball Players Association (MLBPA) on various levels. He attended an executive board meeting for the first time in 1999 and was a team player representative and association representative for several seasons following. He was an active participant in the union&#x27;s collective bargaining in 2002 and 2006 and in negotiations regarding Major League Baseball&#x27;s drug policy. In March 2010, Clark was hired to be the MLBPA&#x27;s Director of Player Relations.

It was reported in April 2013 that Clark was close to earning a degree in history and planned to potentially pursue a Juris Doctor degree. Following the death of Michael Weiner, Clark was unanimously voted executive director of Major League Baseball Players Association in December 2013. He became the first former major league player to hold the position.

Clark led the MLBPA negotiations during the 2021-22 MLB lockout.

During the 2022 season, Clark and the MLBPA worked to unionize minor league baseball players.
In September 2022, the MLBPA joined the AFL-CIO. After the 2022 season, the MLBPA extended Clark&#x27;s contract by five years.

==Nickname==
During his time in Detroit, fans and the media gave Clark the nickname &quot;Tony the Tiger.&quot; The nickname came from the Frosted Flakes mascot Tony the Tiger and that he was a member of the Detroit Tigers.

==Personal life==
Clark and his wife, Frances, have one son. They reside in Phoenix, Arizona, having previously lived in New York.

<text>Audio Stream Input/Output (ASIO) is a computer audio interface driver protocol for digital audio specified by Steinberg, providing high data throughput, synchronization, and low latency between a software application and a computer&#x27;s audio interface or sound card.

ASIO was initially released in 1997 in order to enable streaming of one or more audio streams from an (multi-input/output) audio interface to a software and vice versa with minimal latency and sample accurate synchronization of the audio streams. It allows the audio streams to use any sample rate and supports bit resolutions of 16, 24, 32 bit integer and 32 or 64 bit floating point.

The release of ASIO 2.0 in 1999 brought further enhancements such as ASIO Direct Monitoring, where an audio signal is monitored directly from the audio interface with basically zero latency, and ASIO Positioning Protocol, used to sample accurately synchronize a computer to other digital machines such as ADAT recorder or also other computers.

ASIO 2.3 introduced monitoring for dropouts in the audio stream.

ASIO bypasses the normal audio path from a user application through layers of intermediary operating system software so that an application connects directly to the sound card hardware. Each layer that is bypassed means a reduction in latency (the delay between an application sending audio information and it being reproduced by the sound card, or input signals from the sound card being available to the application). In this way, ASIO offers a relatively simple way of accessing multiple audio inputs and outputs independently.

==Operating systems==
Currently only Microsoft Windows (AMD/Intel x86-64) is supported by the ASIO SDK. Microsoft announced to incorporate ASIO into their USB Audio Class 2 driver for their Arm64 architecture.

While originally supporting MacOS, the introduction of Core Audio with macOS X made ASIO support for this OS unnecessary.

There is also an experimental ASIO driver for Wine, WineASIO, for a Windows compatibility layer for Linux. WineASIO driver uses the JACK sound server as its audio back-end and allows many ASIO-aware applications to run with low latency under WINE.

== Licensing ==
The license to use the ASIO software development kit (SDK) and to distribute an ASIO driver is free of charge. Yet an SDK license agreement has to be signed.

Distribution of the source code is not allowed. For example, the user manual of the Audacity audio editor states: &quot;Licensing restrictions prevent us including ASIO support in released versions of Audacity, but Audacity can be compiled with ASIO support for private, non-distributable use.&quot;

Melkert also became active in the private and public sectors as a corporate and non-profit director and served on several state commissions and councils on behalf of the government, and works as a trade association executive serving as Chairman of the Dutch Hospitals association since December 2018 and became a Member of the Social and Economic Council for the Industry and Employers confederation (VNO-NCW) in April 2019.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Adrianus Petrus Wilhelmus Melkert was born into a Roman Catholic middle-class family in Gouderak, a small village situated in the province of South Holland. His father was a barber. Melkert attended a Roman Catholic primary school in Moordrecht until 1968, after which he continued his studies at the Coornhert Gymnasium in Gouda, a state school specialising in the arts. In the final year of his secondary education, he worked for a greengrocer at the local market. Melkert graduated in 1974 and went on to study political science at the University of Amsterdam. During this period he became active within the radical left-wing Christian Political Party of Radicals (PPR) party and served as a member of the board of the youth organisation of the PPR between 1978 and 1980. He went on to become a member of the general board of the Dutch branch of the European Movement, the chairperson of the Council of European National Youth Committees and the chairperson of the Dutch Platform for International Youth Work. In 1979 he was elected to the party board of the PPR and was 3rd candidate on the PPR&#x27;s list for the 1979 European Parliament elections. He graduated in 1981 and received the Dutch Society for International Relations prize for best Master&#x27;s thesis of 1981, the subject of which dealt with the foreign policy of the Den Uyl cabinet.

In 1981 he became general secretary of the youth forum of the European Community in Brussels. In this capacity, he attended an illegal youth conference in Chile, then ruled by Pinochet. Meanwhile, tensions within the PPR had escalated. Melkert was a member of the so-called, &#x27;Blues&#x27; or &#x27;Godebald&#x27; group of radicals, which favoured closer cooperation with the social-democrat Labour Party (PvdA) and the social-liberal Democrats 66 (D66) party. The conflict came to an end in 1981. The &#x27;Reds&#x27;, who favoured closer cooperation with the left-wing socialist Pacifist Socialist Party (PSP) party and the communist Communist Party of the Netherlands (CPN) party, and the &#x27;Greens&#x27;, who favoured an independent Green Party, joined forces. Many &#x27;Blues&#x27;, including Melkert, left the PPR for the PvdA. In 1984 he became director of international affairs at Oxfam Novib, the Dutch branch of Oxfam, and moved to The Hague. He also became a member of the board of the local PvdA branch. In 1986 he published a book on international development in the Netherlands titled: &quot;The Next Minister: Development Cooperation with the Cabinet, 1965 – 19?&quot;

===Politics===
In 1996 Melkert was elected into the House of Representatives. In the early years, he was the party&#x27;s spokesperson on foreign affairs, development cooperation and environmental affairs.

After the 1989 elections, he took the post of financial spokesperson of the PvdA, becoming the party&#x27;s primary spokesperson in the debates on the national budget. Between 1990 and 1994 he was vice-chairman of the parliament&#x27;s committee on finance.

As an MP, Melkert also participated in several boards of civil society organisations. He was a member of the board of advisers of the Foundation for Communication on Development Cooperation, chairman of the Foundation for Development Cooperation Almere-Port Sudan, and vice-chairman of the Atlantic Committee. Also, he wrote a column in the region newspaper, &quot;De Gooi- en Eemlander&quot;, that covered Hilversum and the Almere region.

In 1994 Melkert became the Minister of Social Affairs and Employment in the first cabinet of Prime Minister, Wim Kok. He held responsibility for one of its main goals, which, in the words of those who shaped the cabinet was: &quot;Employment, Employment, Employment&quot;. As a minister, Melkert was known for his work ethic. Each Friday he would fill a postman&#x27;s cart, which he had bought specifically for that purpose, with dossiers. Upon his return to work the following Monday all the dossiers would have been read. His work ethic was also noticeable in the vast amount of policies and laws he initiated during his tenure as minister.
* In 1995 he initiated a plan to employ 40.000 long-term unemployed. They would be offered a so-called, &quot;Melkert job, mostly in the public sector e.g. tram conductor, high school janitor etc. These jobs were subsidised by the national government.
* In 1995 Melkert also published a note, &quot;The Other Side of the Netherlands&quot;, in which he proposed several plans to combat silent poverty and social exclusion. This led to the 1997 law: &quot;Prevention and Combat of Poverty and Social Exclusion&quot;. It changed the social security and the old age pension laws, giving municipalities more ways of offering special social benefits to the poorest citizens.
* In the same year he also wrote the note, &quot;Flexibility and Certainty&quot;, in which proposals for a more flexible labour market were made.
* In 1997, in collaboration with Frank de Grave, the VVD (Liberal) state secretary of social affairs, he published the note, &quot;Working on Security&quot;, in which the future of the social security system was researched. It included plans to reform the way old-age pensions were financed.
* In the same year he also initiated a &quot;White Cleaners&quot; plan, which stimulated the hiring of cleaners by individuals with the added responsibility of paying taxes and social benefits. The plan was intended to combat unemployment of the least educated, and the informal economy.
* In addition, he united all employment laws, such as the Youth Work law, as well as the &#x27;job pools&#x27; into one Law Activation Working-Seeking, which offered municipalities more possibilities to employ the long-term unemployed.

As minister of Social Affairs, he often came into conflict with the VVD&#x27;s (People&#x27;s Party for Freedom and Democracy) Minister of Finance, Gerrit Zalm.

Following the 1998 general elections in which Melkert was the PvdA&#x27;s fifth-ranking candidate, he became leader of the PvdA in parliament. He also served as chair of the parliament&#x27;s committee on Information and Security Services. During his period as chairman, the party discipline tightened. The PvdA&#x27;s image appeared arrogant. A conflict situation between Melkert and Rob van Gijzel, a popular PvdA MP, regarding the post of spokesperson on fraud in the construction sector, resulted in Van Gijzel leaving parliament. Despite concerns regarding Melkert&#x27;s policy of marginalising and isolating the Socialist Party, he was seen as a competent politician and was designated to succeed Prime Minister, Wim Kok, who officially retired as leader of the PvdA in 2001.

===Elections of 2002===
It was widely anticipated that the election would revolve mainly around the question as to whether the Labour Party or the People&#x27;s Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD) would become the largest party and that either Melkert or the Leader of the People&#x27;s Party for Freedom and Democracy Hans Dijkstal were to become the next Prime Minister. Melkert and Dijkstal were the front runners in the early stages of the campaign but the unexpected arrival of former Sociology professor Pim Fortuyn of the Livable Netherlands (LN) party and later the Pim Fortuyn List (LPF) party turned the polls.

Fortuyn shifted the election issues from &quot;Business as usual&quot; to Immigration and Integration policies, Healthcare reform and the state of the Public sector. Fortuyn blamed the problems in the country on the Purple cabinets (in which both Melkert and Dijkstal served as ministers) and depicted Melkert and Dijkstal as two bureaucrats who were out of touch with the voter&#x27;s concerns. During the election, Fortuyn accused Melkert of the demonization of his character and personal integrity. In several television debates between Melkert and Fortuyn, it became apparent that Melkert was no match for Fortuyn&#x27;s rather unconventional, though highly charismatic debating style. In the now infamous debate on the night when the results of the 2002 municipal elections were telecast, Fortuyn, having just won the elections in Rotterdam, made a lively, enthusiastic impression, rarely missing an opportunity to mock his opponent who appeared to sit with a degree of discomfort. The incompatibility of the two men dominated the rest of the election campaign. In a one-on-one debate during the programme, &quot;Network&quot;, their vastly different styles were once again highlighted. To every question posed by the host, Melkert responded with a detailed course of action. With regard to Fortuyn&#x27;s plans, Melkert demanded &#x27;footnotes!&#x27;, implying that his opponent&#x27;s contribution was unrealistic and devoid of detail. There were those who perceived this as arrogance on his part. Steps were taken to redress the possibility of a negative, bureaucratic image and it was revealed that Melkert was an avid follower of Feyenoord football club and enjoyed culinary pursuits: a cookbook was published on his personal website. In May 2006 Melkert revealed to politician-turned-television personality, Paul Rosenmöller, that perhaps by being too entrenched in the confines of the governmental tower, his demeanour had come across as somewhat patronising: something that did not appeal to the voter.

On 6 May 2002 nine days before the election Fortuyn was assassinated by a 32-year-old environmental activist. in Hilversum. A few relatively minor riots erupted in The Hague where Melkert was at the time, urging him to make a quick departure from the city. After receiving death threats, including a loaded gun in the mail, he and his family temporarily went into hiding. Melkert&#x27;s PvdA lost nearly half its seats, decreasing from 45 to 23 in the 150-seat House of Representatives. The party fell from 1st to 4th place. Melkert resigned as political leader on election night and was replaced by the former speaker of the House of Representatives, Jeltje van Nieuwenhoven. Melkert remained in parliament for a short time afterwards. His last major parliamentary debate was on the state of the European Union.

===World Bank and the United Nations===
In November 2002, Melkert was appointed executive director of the World Bank. In April 2005 he was a serious candidate for the post of Administrator of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). It went, however, to the Turkish economist and politician, Kemel Dervis. In January 2006 Melkert was appointed Associate Administrator of the UNDP. In 2009 Melkert was appointed Special Representative of the Secretary-General of the United Nations in Iraq. He was a candidate to succeed Juan Somavía as Director-General of the International Labour Organization but lost to Guy Ryder.

The PvdA formed an electoral alliance with GroenLinks in the early 2020s. Melkert opposed merger plans, arguing that the focus of GroenLinks on climate change would deter moderate voters. He said that the PvdA should win back working-class people, and he has supported Rood Vooruit, an initiative founded in 2023 that has been critical of a merger.

<doc id="926327" wikidata="Q5884591" url="?curid=926327" title="Holt Park">
<text>Holt Park is a medium-sized low-rise 1970s housing estate in the northwest suburbs of Leeds, West Yorkshire, England. It is approximately from Leeds city centre situated between Tinshill, Cookridge and Adel, and is at the edge of the Leeds urban fringe, bordering the green belt which makes up two thirds of the metropolitan borough of the City of Leeds. The nearby Tinshill BT Tower dominates the skyline.

Holt Park is in the Leeds North West constituency; its Member of Parliament is Labour&#x27;s Katie White. It is part of the Adel &amp; Wharfedale ward of Leeds City Council.

==Housing==
One half of Holt Park was built as a council estate; the other half as private housing, built to typical British 1970s design by the well-known property developer Norman C. Ashton Limited (similar/identical architecture and build can be found in other areas in Leeds and West Yorkshire, including Otley, Ainsty in Wetherby, Ferrybridge and Knottingley), comprising a mixture of detached and semi-detached housing, and several apartments. This came about after an agreement between Norman Ashton (an experienced developer) and Leeds City Council to create a new &#x27;village&#x27; within the city, which would include a mixture of private and council housing stock with shops and leisure facilities.

The farm was sold to the developers by The Co-op, who purchased the land in 1920 as one of five dairy farms in Leeds. The earlier housing was completed before the farm was closed, and the farmer took advantage of this delivering milk to all the new residents in the early years.

The council housing is a mixture of two-story terraced houses, end-bungalows and flats with bedroom numbers ranging from one to four. These are set in cul-de-sacs within, off and on the periphery of Holtdale Approach, connected by various alleyways and footpaths. Some of this stock is now privately owned, but much of it remains under the control of the Council. Several blocks of flats, set over three storeys, also exist, albeit owned/managed by a housing association. At the same time two schools (Holt Park Middle School and Ralph Thoresby High School), a sports centre (Holt Park Leisure Centre), a library (Holt Park Library, which was annexed to and therefore part of the High School) were built and a shopping centre were built.

== Ralph Thoresby School ==

The original Ralph Thoresby buildings were built around 1975 and remained the school&#x27;s premises until September 2007. It was strategically built as part of the district centre and so the leisure centre and the library were fully accessible to the public and part of the school&#x27;s premises.

Holt Park Library and Ralph Thoresby High School were rebuilt on a new site off Holtdale Approach (south), with the opening in September 2007. This is one in a long line of North Leeds secondary schools to be rebuilt, following Lawnswood School and Roundhay School to name but two.

== Holt Park District Centre ==

The shopping centre began to decrease in character from the late 1990s, with many businesses occupying the units either closing or relocating. The Asda supermarket that has been the main anchor of the centre since it opened in the early 1970s, has enlarged its floor space by taking over some of the empty shop units. A complete redevelopment of the district centre has been discussed for many years. In 2005, a planning application was submitted to Leeds City Council for a complete rebuild of the shopping centre and a standalone Asda superstore with a petrol station to be built next to it. The plans were ultimately rejected. However, discussions remain ongoing.

Adjacent to the shopping centre is &quot;High Farm&quot;, the farm which the estate was originally built on and around, and later converted into a public house. The building itself is known to date back to the 17th century and the interior of the pub still contains period features such the original oak beams. The shopping centre also contains the area&#x27;s bus &#x27;station&#x27;. In many ways the district centre is similar (although smaller) to many new town shopping centres such as those in Newton Aycliffe and Cumbernauld.

=== Public houses ===
There is now just one public house in Holt Park, The High Farm, adjacent to the shopping centre, is situated in the old farm buildings and won awards when converted into a pub in the 1970s. The High Farm pub was formerly tied to Hull based brewery North Country Breweries and latterly the Mansfield Brewery. It has a function room in an original barn with beams dating back to the 16th century.

== Transport ==
Holt Park has bus services operated by First Leeds (formerly Yorkshire Rider), particularly Route 1 &quot;Brown Line&quot; which runs from the shopping centre, through Weetwood, Headingley, Leeds University, Leeds city centre and terminates in the South Leeds area of Beeston. The original terminus of the Route 1 in Holt Park was the roundel where Heathfield meets Holt Lane. The first public-service bendy-buses in the United Kingdom were pioneered on this route in 1999. By 2009, withdrawals had begun on these vehicles, and the last set of FTR Bendybuses for First Leeds were withdrawn in 2016 when they were replaced with new 16 plate Wrightbus Streetdeck double deckers.

The Route 6 &quot;Sky Blue Line&quot; (formerly the 96 &quot;Sky Line&quot;) bus service runs through Cookridge, Tinshill, Weetwood, Headingley and Leeds University to Leeds City bus station. The original 96 route ran to and terminated at Cookridge. In the late 2000s, the route was extended to Holt Park via Cookridge, before being renumbered as the number 6 in August 2010.

Route 940 (operated by Connexionsbuses) also runs from the shopping centre to Otley, via Bramhope and Pool-in-Wharfedale.

Routes 31 and 32 operate from Holt Park Shopping Centre to Horsforth Green on circular routes. These are run by Squarepeg Buses.

All buses are governed by West Yorkshire Metro (and The West Yorkshire Combined Authority).

The nearest railway station to Holt Park is Horsforth situated on the Leeds-Harrogate-York Line.

<doc id="926340" wikidata="Q1164773" url="?curid=926340" title="Rinca">
<text>Rinca is a small island near Komodo and Flores island, East Nusa Tenggara, Indonesia, within the West Manggarai Regency. It is one of the three largest islands included in Komodo National Park. The island is famous for Komodo dragons, giant lizards that can measure up to long. Rinca is also populated with many other species such as wild pigs, buffalos and many birds.

==Area==

The island&#x27;s area is .

==Living conditions==
Living conditions for local people on the island are often difficult. Education facilities, for example, are quite limited for children. Some non-government organisations help with the provision of books for children on Rinca. Local people must also take some care to avoid Komodo dragons because Komodos in the area occasionally attack and kill humans.

==Sea conditions==
Rinca and Komodo Islands bracket a north-south passage between the Indian Ocean and the Flores Sea. Due to the large bodies of water and narrow gap, the waters between Rinca and Komodo are subject to whirlpools and currents in excess of 10 knots.

Diving in the region requires care. In June 2008, five scuba divers (three British, one French and one Swedish) were found on the southern coast of Rinca after having been missing for 2 days. The group had drifted from where their dive boat abandoned them. They survived on oysters and other shellfish.

==Fauna==
Being less known and less visited than Komodo Island, Rinca is a good place to see the Komodo dragon in its natural environment with fewer people to disturb them. Day trips can be arranged to the Loh Buaya park facility on Rinca Island from Labuan Bajo on Flores by small boat at the park headquarters. A jetty marks the entrance to the park facility. A short walk leads to the local park office where there are rangers to accompany visitors on short or medium-length walks to see komodos and other animals such as monkeys, deer and buffalos.

<doc id="926344" wikidata="Q3818182" url="?curid=926344" title="The Approach to Al-Mu'tasim">
<text>&quot;The Approach to Al-Mu&#x27;tasim&quot; (original Spanish title: &quot;El acercamiento a Almotásim&quot;) is a fantasy short story written in 1935 by Argentine writer Jorge Luis Borges. In his autobiographical essay, Borges wrote about &quot;The Approach to Al-Mu&#x27;tasim&quot;, &quot;it now seems to me to foreshadow and even to set the pattern for those tales that were somehow awaiting me, and upon which my reputation as a storyteller was to be based.&quot;

==Background==

Written in 1935, &quot;The Approach to Al-Mu&#x27;tasim&quot; was first published as an essay in Borges&#x27;s 1936 philosophical essay collection &quot;A History of Eternity&quot; (&quot;Historia de la eternidad&quot;). It was labeled a short story when it was reprinted in 1942 in Borges&#x27;s first short fiction collection, &quot;The Garden of Forking Paths&quot; (&quot;El jardín de senderos que se bifurcan&quot;), which became a subsection of &quot;Ficciones&quot; when that was published in 1944.

Borges described his story as &quot;both a hoax &quot;and&quot; a pseudo-essay.&quot; He borrowed from Kipling for some of the plot of the fake book. The supposed publisher of the fictitious book described in the story was an actual publisher, Victor Gollancz, as was the supposed writer of the preface, Dorothy L. Sayers.

==Plot summary==
The story is a review of &quot;The Conversation with the Man Called Al-Mu&#x27;tasim: A Game of Shifting Mirrors&quot;, the second edition of an earlier work, &quot;The Approach to Al-Mu&#x27;tasim&quot;. Written by Mir Bahadur Ali, an Indian lawyer, and published in 1934, the second edition is described by the narrator as inferior to the first edition, published in 1932.

The reviewer gives a history of the book, first describing the success of the first edition, the publishing of the second edition by a respected publisher in London, and the positive and negative reception given to it by critics. Borges states that though both books have been popular, the first had an original printing of 4,000 copies and was never reprinted, while the second is by far the better known, having been reprinted several times. The second has often been criticized for poor writing and for its obvious allegory to the quest of finding God.

The narrator then summarizes the plot of the novel. The book is a detective story about a freethinking Bombay law student of Islamic background. He becomes involved in a sectarian riot in which he impulsively kills a Hindu, after which he becomes an outcast among the lower classes of India. He flees to a tower where he meets a robber of Parsee corpses collecting gold teeth. He then begins a journey across the subcontinent (the geography of which Borges describes in detail), interacting with untouchables along the way. He meets a man who, though destitute, is happy and spiritual. The student encounters many such people radiating a small amount of this spiritual clarity. From these experiences, he infers the existence of a &quot;perfect man&quot;, whom he calls Al-Mu&#x27;tasim. (&quot;Al-Mu&#x27;tasim&quot; means &quot;he who goes in quest of aid&quot; or &quot;the seeker of shelter&quot;.) This perfect man is a higher spiritual being, the source and originator of this pure spiritual clarity. Obsessed with meeting Al-Mu&#x27;tasim, the student goes on a pilgrimage through Hindustan to find him. He eventually hears the voice of the Al-Mu&#x27;tasim resounding from a hut. He pulls back the curtain and goes in. The book ends at this point. The reviewer then gives his criticisms of the work.

A long footnote at the end of the review summarises &quot;The Conference of the Birds&quot; (1177) by Farid ud-Din Attar, in which a group of birds seek a feather dropped in the middle of China by Simurgh, the bird king. Thirty birds reach the mountain of Simurgh and there they find through contemplation that they themselves are the Simurgh. (&quot;Si murgh&quot; means &quot;thirty birds&quot;.)

==Style==
Borges&#x27;s mixing of the fictional and the real, which Jaime Alazraki calls a &quot;Borgesian device,&quot; both imparts a real feeling to the fictional, and an unreal feeling to the real. Also, the use of a summary within a summary, and the taking of those summaries and stripping them down to expose the same principle &quot;are a form of expressing in the structure of the story the pantheistic idea that anything is all things.&quot;

Naomi Lindstrom describes the reviewer of the detective story as &quot;a typical Borges narrator&quot;. At times he demonstrates great knowledge of detailed information, but at other times he cannot grasp the most basic concepts. His narrative is uncertain and inconstant. His confusion serves to emphasize the incomprehension of the main character of the fictitious book as he goes on his pilgrimage.

Borges&#x27;s use of an allegory to shed light on a detective story shows his use of religious doctrines for aesthetic value.

==Reception==
In his autobiographical essay, Borges writes that when &quot;The Approach to Al-Mu&#x27;tasim&quot; was first published, the people who read it &quot;took it at face value, and one of my friends even ordered a copy from London.&quot;

==Legacy==
Psychedelic rock band Blaak Heat named their 2016 album, Shifting Mirrors, after the subtitle of Bahadur&#x27;s fictional book mentioned in the short story. The album also contains a track named after The Approach To Al-Mu&#x27;Tasim.

<text>Cathedral,&quot; also known as Cathedral: The Game of the Mediaeval City,&quot; is a two-player abstract strategy game designed by Robert Moore and first published in 1979, in which dark and light factions vie for territorial supremacy within the bounds of a medieval city. Players play pieces to capture territory on a game board, attempting to place all or most of their game pieces while preventing their opponent from doing likewise. The game&#x27;s copyright is currently owned by Chrisbo I.P. Holdings Limited in New Zealand. 

== History ==

&quot;Cathedral&quot; was invented between 1962 and 1979 by Robert Moore, a pilot in the Royal New Zealand Air Force. Inspiration for the game was provided by Christchurch Cathedral and its environs in Christchurch, New Zealand. From the air, Moore was fascinated by the way the cathedral and neighbouring buildings intricately fit together, like pieces of a jigsaw puzzle.

In 1979 Moore presented a prototype version to Brightway Products, a New Zealand wooden toy and game company. Two versions of the game were originally created: a &quot;formal piece&quot; using three-dimensional wooden models of mediaeval buildings and towers, and an &quot;abstract piece&quot; consisting of two-dimensional squares. The formal piece proved more popular and is the only version produced today. 

A plastic moulded version with very highly detailed parts and a gridded locking system was published by Mattel in 1985. 

== Gameplay ==

&quot;Cathedral&quot; is played on a wooden board divided into a 10x10 grid and enclosed by turreted walls, representing a medieval city. It is played with 29 pieces, each of which are small abstracts of buildings: 14 dark pieces, 14 light pieces, and one grey piece– the Cathedral. All pieces except the Abbey and the Academy are the same between colours.

The player using the light pieces begins by placing the Cathedral anywhere within the play area, aligned with the squares. The dark player then places one of their game pieces on the board. Play alternates between the two sides until one side is unable to make a move. The other side then attempts to place all of their remaining pieces in areas they have captured.

Players capture territory within the city by completely enclosing it with their pieces or with the help of the city walls. Boundaries of these areas must be &quot;wall to wall&quot; such that surrounding pieces touching only at the corners are not enough to capture. If the captured territory contains only one of the opponent&#x27;s pieces or the Cathedral, that piece may be removed and the opponent may no longer place pieces in that area. A player&#x27;s removed piece can return to play later, but the cathedral is removed for the remainder of the game. If the territory contains more than one piece, it is not captured and remains available for the opponent to use.

The winner is the player who manages to place all of their pieces, while preventing their opponent from doing so. If neither player is able to place all of their pieces, then the player whose remaining pieces would take up the smaller area is declared the winner.

==Reception==
&quot;Wirecutter&quot; listed &quot;Cathedral&quot; as one of the best board games as of 2023, with Winnie Yang praising the game for its simple rules, fast pace, and &quot;beautifully made&quot; design. Wolfgang Baur, in the book &quot;Family Games: The 100 Best,&quot; described the game as &quot;board gaming nirvana&quot; because of &quot;its speed, its simplicity, and the sheer joy of placing that one, perfect piece that seals your opponent&#x27;s doom.&quot; In a review for Issue #43 of &quot;Games&quot;, senior editor R. Wayne Schmittberger described &quot;Cathedral&quot; as &quot;an exceptional game for both its visual beauty and intriguing gameplay.&quot; In a brief review for Issue #3, &quot;Abstract Strategy&quot; compared the game to Pentominoes and Go, praising its medieval city theme and &quot;the attractiveness of its playing equipment.&quot; 

On his website, ludologist Tom Lehmann described &quot;Cathedral&quot; as &quot;both an attractive and interesting abstract game for 2,&quot; but noted that the game was broken because there exists an opening strategy for the first player that cannot be countered by the second player. He suggested a fix for this where the second player instead places the Cathedral along with their first piece.

In 1983, &quot;Cathedral&quot; was the recipient of the Designmark Award.

<doc id="926354" wikidata="Q714788" url="?curid=926354" title="Victor Noir">
<text>Victor Noir, born Yvan Salmon (27 July 1848 – 11 January 1870), was a French journalist. After he was shot and killed by Prince Pierre Bonaparte, a cousin of the French Emperor Napoleon III (), Noir became a symbol of opposition to the imperial regime. His tomb in Père Lachaise Cemetery in Paris has become a fertility symbol.

==Early life, family and education==

He was born Yvan Salmon at Attigny, Vosges, the son of a Jewish cobbler who had converted to Catholicism.

==Career==
He adopted &quot;Victor Noir&quot; as his pen name after his mother&#x27;s maiden name. He moved to Paris and became an apprentice journalist for the newspaper &quot;La Marseillaise&quot;, owned and operated by Henri Rochefort and edited by Paschal Grousset.

==Shooting==
===Background===
In December 1869, a dispute broke out between two Corsican newspapers, the radical &quot;La Revanche&quot;, inspired from afar by Grousset; and the loyalist &quot;L&#x27;Avenir de la Corse&quot;, edited by an agent of the Ministry of Interior named Della Rocca. The invective of &quot;la Revanche&quot; concentrated on Napoleon I. On 30 December, &quot;l&#x27;Avenir&quot; published a letter to its editor authored by Prince Pierre Bonaparte, the nephew of Napoleon, and cousin of Emperor Napoleon III, who by then had ruled more than twenty years. Prince Bonaparte castigated the staff of &quot;la Revanche&quot; as cowards and traitors. The letter made its way from Bastia to Paris. Grousset took offense and demanded satisfaction. In the meantime, &quot;la Marseillaise&quot; lent strong support to the cause of &quot;la Revanche&quot;.

On 9 January 1870, Prince Bonaparte wrote a letter to Rochefort, claiming to uphold the good name of his family:
===Shooting===
On the following day, Grousset sent Victor Noir and Ulrich de Fonvielle as his seconds to fix the terms of a duel with Pierre Bonaparte. Contrary to custom, they presented themselves to Prince Bonaparte instead of contacting his seconds. Each of them carried a revolver in his pocket. Noir and de Fonvieille presented Prince Bonaparte with a letter signed by Grousset. But the prince declined the challenge, asserting his willingness to fight his fellow nobleman Rochefort, but not his &quot;menials&quot; (&quot;ses manœuvres&quot;). In response, Noir asserted his solidarity with his friends. According to Fonvieille, Prince Bonaparte then slapped his face and shot Noir dead. According to the Prince, it was Noir who took umbrage at the epithet and struck him first, whereupon he drew his revolver and fired at his aggressor. That was the version eventually accepted by the court.

==Aftermath==
A public outcry followed and on 12 January, led by political activist Auguste Blanqui, more than 100,000 people joined Noir&#x27;s funeral procession to a cemetery in Neuilly. Attendance in this procession was regarded as a civic duty for republicans. When Marie François Sadi Carnot endorsed electoral candidates, he often identified them as such attendees. (&quot;&quot;)

At a time when the emperor was already unpopular, Pierre&#x27;s acquittal on the murder charge caused enormous public outrage and a number of violent demonstrations.

The Franco-Prussian War resulted in the overthrow of the Emperor&#x27;s regime on 4 September 1870 and the establishment of the Third Republic. In 1891 the body of Victor Noir was moved to Père Lachaise Cemetery in Paris.

==Monument==
A life-sized bronze statue was sculpted by Jules Dalou to mark his grave, portrayed in a realistic style as though he had just fallen on the street, dropping his hat which is depicted beside him.

The sculpture has a very noticeable protuberance in Noir&#x27;s trousers. This has made it one of the most popular memorials for women to visit in the famous cemetery. The myth says that placing a flower in the upturned top hat after kissing the statue on the lips and rubbing its genital area will enhance fertility, bring a blissful sex life, or, in some versions, a husband within the year. As a result of the legend, those particular components of the otherwise verdigris (grey-green oxidized bronze) statue are rather well-worn and shiny, as are the tips of the boots.

A fence was erected around the statue of Noir in 2004, to deter superstitious people from touching the statue. However, due to protests from the &quot;female population of Paris&quot;, led by French TV anchor Péri Cochin, it was torn down again.

<text>Laurdine Kenneth &quot;Pat&quot; Patrick Jr. (November 23, 1929 – December 31, 1991) was an American jazz musician and composer. He played baritone saxophone, alto saxophone, and Fender bass and was known for his 40-year association with Sun Ra. His son, Deval Patrick, was formerly governor of Massachusetts.

==Early life==
Patrick was born in East Moline, Illinois, to Laverne and Laurdine Kenneth Patrick His father (1905–2001), a native of Kansas, worked as an iron moulder at a factory at the time of his son&#x27;s birth.

Patrick first learned piano, drums, and trumpet as a child, and then switched to saxophones. He attended and studied music at DuSable High School in Chicago, where he met future bassist Richard Davis and future saxophonists John Gilmore and Clifford Jordan. Patrick was baritone saxophonist for the Regal Theater&#x27;s house band while still at school. &quot;In 1949 he enrolled at Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, but he soon returned to the Chicago area to study at Wilson Junior College.&quot;

==Later life and career==
Patrick first played in one of Sun Ra&#x27;s bands as part of a trio around 1950. He played occasionally in Sun Ra&#x27;s Arkestra from around the same time, and then became a regular band member in 1954. In February 1955, Patrick married Emily Wintersmith in Cook County, Illinois. His children with Emily were Deval Patrick and Rhonda Sigh. He had at least one child, La&#x27;Shon Anthony, outside his marriage. In 1959, a woman called for Patrick and his wife asked for a message. This precipitated the breakup of his marriage that year.

In 1960, Patrick left Emily, Deval and Rhonda, and moved out of their apartment. When four-year-old Deval chased after him, he slapped his son and continued. He refused to sign Deval&#x27;s application to Milton Academy, arguing that Deval would lose his African American identity there. Deval, whose tuition was paid by scholarship, was accepted anyway. Father and son rarely saw each other.

Patrick resided for several years in the Arkestra&#x27;s communal residences in New York City&#x27;s East Village and Philadelphia. The Arkestra, with Patrick, moved to New York in 1961. He also played with John Coltrane (appearing on &quot;Africa/Brass&quot; in 1961), Blue Mitchell (&quot;A Sure Thing&quot;, 1962), Mongo Santamaría (&quot;Yeh, Yeh&quot;, which he composed, and &quot;Watermelon Man&quot;) and Thelonious Monk (early 1970s). He also extensively backed Babatunde Olatunji. In December 1965, Patrick married Edna Jean Ballinger in Las Vegas, Nevada.

In 1972, Patrick co-founded the Baritone Saxophone Retinue, which also featured Charles Davis and another four players of the instrument, plus a rhythm section. The group recorded two albums for Saturn Records. He toured Europe with Sun Ra in 1970 and 1976, and was part of some other Arkestra performances in that decade, but he also devoted time to teaching at the State University of New York at Old Westbury. He was a regular member of the Arkestra again from 1986 to 1988. A contributor to &quot;Grove Music&quot; wrote: &quot;Patrick was a well-schooled, versatile soloist and ensemble player and made an important contribution to Sun Ra&#x27;s music. Besides his principal instrument, which was baritone saxophone, he played flutes, bass, and percussion.&quot;

Patrick died from leukemia in Moline, Illinois, on December 31, 1991.

<text>Agawam (or Rogers 15) is a hybrid grape variety. It is a crossing of Carter (another hybrid grape with &quot;Vitis labrusca&quot; and &quot;Vitis vinifera&quot; in its pedigree) and Muscat Hamburg (a &quot;Vitis vinifera&quot; cultivar). Agawam is one of the so-called Rogers&#x27; Hybrids created by E.S. Rogers of Salem, Massachusetts, in the early-to-mid-19th century, and is unique among the named cultivars of that group in that it is self-fertile.

It can be used to make a rosé wine having a &quot;foxy&quot; flavor.

==Synonyms==
Agawam is also called Agavam, Rogers 15, and Rogers&#x27; Hybrid Nr. 15.

<doc id="926360" wikidata="Q808218" url="?curid=926360" title="Baritone saxophone">
<text>The baritone saxophone (sometimes abbreviated to &quot;bari sax&quot;) is a member of the saxophone family of instruments, larger (and lower-pitched) than the tenor saxophone, but smaller (and higher-pitched) than the bass. It is the lowest-pitched saxophone in common use — the bass, contrabass and subcontrabass saxophones are relatively uncommon. Like all saxophones, it is a single-reed instrument. It is commonly used in concert bands, chamber music, military bands, big bands, and jazz combos. It can also be found in other ensembles such as rock bands and marching bands. Modern baritone saxophones are pitched in E.

==History==
The baritone saxophone was created in 1846 by the Belgian instrument maker Adolphe Sax as one of a family of 14 instruments. Sax believed these instruments would provide a useful tonal link between the woodwinds and brasses. The family was divided into two groups of seven saxophones each, from the soprano to the contrabass. Though a design for an F baritone saxophone is included in the C and F family of saxophones, no known F baritones exist. The family consisting of saxophones in the keys of B and E was more successful because of their popularity in military bands.

All saxophones were originally keyed to low B, but a low B mechanism was patented in 1887 and by 1910 this was standard for most saxophones including baritones. This low B is a concert D on baritone saxophone, and players began creating &#x27;low A pipes&#x27; to insert into the bell to extend the range to the very useful concert C just below that (low A on the baritone sax). This modification made the low B inaccessible and low B out of tune. This method is still used today by some players. From the 1930s through the 1950s, manufacturers experimented with extending the bell to add a low A key to the instrument. The simplest way was to add a cylindrical section between the bell and bow to provide the extra length and tone hole, and some makers produced and sold instruments built this way, but these horns generally suffer from intonation problems in the lowest few notes and players often consider their tone poor as well. Selmer Paris began producing low A versions of the Mark VI baritone saxophone in the late 1950s which had a bell that had been designed separately from the low B version (such a bell may have been a custom-order option before this time), and these instruments do not generally suffer from the same intonation problems. In the 1970s, Yamaha&#x27;s YBS-61 was keyed to low A with no low B option, and by the 1980s most baritones were being manufactured with a low A bell. The low A model is now considered standard and only a few manufacturers still produce low B instruments.

In its original form, the baritone saxophone&#x27;s highest keyed note was high E, but instruments keyed to high F became standard during the 1920s. High F became a rare option starting in the 1950s and slowly became more common, but as with other modern saxophones, most baritones are now manufactured with a high F key.

==Description==
The baritone saxophone, like other saxophones, is a conical tube of thin brass. It has a wider end, flared to form a bell, and a smaller end connected to a mouthpiece. The baritone saxophone uses a single reed mouthpiece like that of a clarinet. There is a loop in the top of the body (sometimes also known as the &#x27;pigtail&#x27;) in two U-shaped pieces of tube called the upper bow and spit bow, to reduce it to a practical height.

Baritone saxophones are typically found in two versions with one ranging to low A and the other to low B. Despite the ubiquity of the low A horn, some players still prefer to use B horns because of the added weight of a low A bell or because of personal preference for a particular vintage instrument. Some also believe low A horns sound inferior in the low range; however, this is the subject of debate among players.

A baritone saxophone weighs , depending on the material and design, making it substantially heavier than a tenor saxophone. Some players use a harness in place of a neck strap to distribute the weight more comfortably. Some modern instruments have a mount for a floor peg, similar to those on bass clarinets, to reduce weight on the player&#x27;s neck when seated.

==Transposition==
It is a transposing instrument in the key of E, pitched an octave plus a major sixth lower than written. It is one octave lower than the alto saxophone. Modern baritones with a low A key and high F key have a range from C2 to A4.

As with all saxophones, its music is written in treble clef. By coincidence, it is possible to use a trick known as clef substitution to read music written in bass clef at concert pitch (for example most tuba or bassoon parts), by reading as if it were a transposing part in treble clef and pretending there were three more sharps (or three fewer flats) in the key signature. A similar trick allows instruments in B like the tenor saxophone to read concert pitch tenor clef.

==In classical music==
The baritone saxophone is used as a standard member of concert bands and saxophone quartets.

It has also been occasionally called for in music for orchestra. Examples include Richard Strauss&#x27; &quot;Sinfonia Domestica&quot;, which calls for a baritone saxophone in F; Béla Bartók&#x27;s &quot;The Wooden Prince&quot; ballet music; Charles Ives&#x27; &quot;Symphony No. 4&quot;, composed in 1910–1916; and Gershwin&#x27;s &quot;Rhapsody in Blue&quot; (Grofé&#x27;s orchestration) and &quot;An American in Paris&quot;. In his opera &quot;The Devils of Loudun&quot; (Die Teufel von Loudun), Krzysztof Penderecki calls for two baritone saxes. Karlheinz Stockhausen includes a baritone saxophone in &quot;Gruppen&quot; and Stravinsky calls for one in his Ebony Concerto. 

It has a comparatively small solo repertoire although an increasing number of concertos have appeared, one of these being &quot;Concerto for Saxophone Quartet and Orchestra&quot; by American composer Philip Glass. This is a piece that can be played with or without an orchestra that features the baritone sax in the second movement. The American composer Mark Watters&#x27; &quot;Rhapsody for Baritone Saxophone&quot; has been scored for piano, wind ensemble, and orchestra. This single-movement solo for the baritone sax includes a virtuosic cadenza.

==In jazz music==
A number of jazz performers have used the baritone saxophone as their primary instrument. It is part of standard big band instrumentation (the larger bass saxophone was also occasionally used up until the 1940s). As phrased by Alain Cupper from JazzBariSax.com, &quot;Used a few times in contemporary classical music...it is especially in jazz that this wonderful instrument feels most comfortable.&quot; One of the instrument&#x27;s pioneers was Harry Carney, longtime baritone saxophone player in the Duke Ellington band.

Baritone saxophone soloists Gerry Mulligan, Cecil Payne, Sahib Shihab, Pepper Adams, Serge Chaloff, and Leo Parker achieved fame in the jazz world. Peter Brötzmann is a notable free jazz player.

A noted Scottish performer was Joe Temperley, who appeared with Humphrey Lyttelton as well as with the Lincoln Center Jazz Orchestra.

More recent notable performers include Hamiet Bluiett (who has also led a group of baritone saxophone players), John Surman, Scott Robinson, James Carter, Stephen &quot;Doc&quot; Kupka of the band Tower of Power, Nick Brignola, Gary Smulyan, Brian Landrus, and Ronnie Cuber. In the avant-garde scene, Tim Berne has doubled on bari. Jazz/funk player Leo Pellegrino of Lucky Chops and Too Many Zooz has become popular with younger listeners for his aggressive playing style and energetic performances.

==In other music==
The baritone sax is an important part of military bands and is common in musical theater. Horn sections with baritone saxophone were used on many rock-and-roll hits of the 1950s, several Motown hits of the 1960s featured baritone saxophonist Mike Terry, and the instrument continued to be used in horn sections in American rock and pop music. It is often in the horn sections of funk, blues, Latin, soul bands.

Prominent baritone saxophonists in contemporary American popular music include Stephen Kupka of Tower of Power, Dana Colley of Morphine, Leroi Moore of the Dave Matthews Band, John Linnell of They Might Be Giants and Martin Perna of Antibalas, the Dap-Kings and TV on the Radio.

Nigerian Afrobeat singer, musician, and bandleader Fela Kuti typically featured two baritone saxophone players in his band.

A few modern non-jazz artists have recently begun to incorporate saxophones into their instrumentation. The LA Indie rock band Fitz and the Tantrums featured both an alto and a baritone saxophone in their music—most recently their 2016 song &quot;Handclap&quot; from an album of the same name. Both were played by band member James King. The &quot;Brass house&quot; (experimental jazz/funk) group Too Many Zooz is another group that has popularized the baritone saxophone. Originally a New York City subway band, the trio has released three albums and been featured on a TEDxYouth@Budapest segment.

==In popular culture==
Lisa Simpson from the cartoon comedy series &quot;The Simpsons&quot; plays the baritone sax.

Haruka Ogasawara from the anime &quot;Sound! Euphonium&quot; plays the baritone sax.

<doc id="926366" wikidata="Q6023128" url="?curid=926366" title="Owen Oglethorpe">
<text>Owen Oglethorpe ( – 31 December 1559) was an English academic and Bishop of Carlisle, 1557–1559.

== Childhood and Education ==
Oglethorpe was born in Tadcaster, Yorkshire, England (where he later founded a school), the third son of George Oglethorpe. He studied at Magdalen College, Oxford, where he was elected a Fellow in 1524. He completed his BA in 1525, received his MA in 1529, and his BTh and DTh in 1536. He was reputed to have taken a keen interest in his studies.

== Career ==
Oglethorpe was appointed a Junior Proctor at Oxford University in 1533. He served as President of Magdalen from 1536 to 1552, was Vice-Chancellor of Oxford for 1551–1552, and was again President of Magdalen from 1553 to 1555. In addition to being one of Henry VIII&#x27;s chaplains, he was also a canon of both Christ Church, Oxford, and St. George&#x27;s Chapel, Windsor (1540–1553). In 1541 he was appointed Rector of Romaldkirk in the newly created Diocese of Chester. The exact date is not recorded but he was appointed by Henry VIII himself. He was deprived of the freehold of the living on 4 August 1559 (just over a month after being deprived of his See for failing to take the Oath of Supremacy to Elizabeth I).

Oglethorpe was unpopular with the &#x27;reformers&#x27; at Oxford, and he was forced to resign his university offices during the reign of Edward VI. His fortunes changed under Mary I, and was appointed Dean of Windsor and Registrar of the Order of the Garter, serving from 1553 to 1556.

==Bishop of Carlisle==
Oglethorpe was consecrated Bishop of Carlisle on 15 August 1557 alongside Thomas Watson, Bishop of Lincoln, and David Poole, Bishop of Peterborough.

When Mary I died on 17 November 1558, she was succeeded by her half-sister, Elizabeth I. Oglethorpe was chosen (for unknown reasons) to celebrate Elizabeth&#x27;s Christmas Day mass in the Chapel Royal of St James&#x27;s Palace. Oglethorpe refused Elizabeth&#x27;s instruction to not elevate the host at its consecration (an action that implied the corporeal presence of Christ). According to a letter sent by Don Aloisio Schivenoglia to Ottaviano Vivaldino, the Mantuan ambassador, Oglethorpe remained adamant that he could not alter the service, as it was against both his conscience and his training. So, after the gospel had been read, Elizabeth walked out of the service to avoid witnessing the elevation of the host. It remains unclear as to why Oglethorpe was presiding at the service (the Queen&#x27;s chaplains usually presided at services in the chapel), especially as the way Schivenoglia describes the event, Elizabeth was pre-warned that Oglethorpe would elevate the host, meaning that she could have found a different presider.

For reasons that scholars have never been able to explain, and despite his &#x27;performance&#x27; at the Christmas Day mass, Oglethorpe presided at Elizabeth&#x27;s coronation only a few weeks later. As was traditional, the coronation took place in Westminster Abbey, on 15 January 1559. Oglethorpe greeted Elizabeth in Westminster Hall, and sprinkled her with holy water. Then, during the service itself, Elizabeth was anointed and invested with the sacred regalia. She was crowned three times: with the crown of St Edward, the imperial state crown, and a third crown (which had likely been made for Mary&#x27;s coronation). Then she swore the coronation oath, which included the distinctly Protestant promise to rule according to &quot;true profession of the Gospel established in this Kingdom&quot;. All of this was administered or performed by Oglethorpe. The service, however, was celebrated by George Carew, the newly installed Dean of the Royal Chapel. Carew&#x27;s designation as celebrant was likely to prevent Oglethorpe elevating the host, and to allow the epistle and the gospel to be read in English.

After Parliament passed the Elizabethan religious settlement, the Church of England became formally Protestant. Oglethorpe refused to swear the required Oath of Supremacy, and was deprived of his See on 26 June 1559.

After his deprivation, Oglethorpe remained in London under loose house arrest. He drew up his will on 10 November 1559, and died on 31 December 1559. He was buried in St Dunstan-in-the-West Church, Fleet Street, on 6 January 1560.

<text>Frank Bonner (born Frank Woodrow Boers Jr.; February 28, 1942 – June 16, 2021) was an American actor and television director widely known for his role as sales manager Herb Tarlek on the television sitcom &quot;WKRP in Cincinnati&quot;.

==Early life==
Bonner was born in Little Rock, Arkansas, to Grace Marie &quot;Mamie&quot; (née Dobbins) Boers Delahoussay, a singer, and Frank Woodrow Boers, a saxophonist. He grew up in Malvern, Arkansas.

==Career==
Bonner began acting in the experimental 1967 independent film &quot;The Equinox ... A Journey into the Unknown&quot;, which was reshot and re-edited as the 1970 cult classic &quot;Equinox&quot; (in which he is credited as Frank Boers Jr.).

He later had several small roles in movies and on television, including &quot;Mannix&quot;, &quot;Emergency!&quot;, and &quot;Love, American Style&quot;. In 1978 he joined the cast of &quot;WKRP in Cincinnati&quot;, finding his signature role as Herb Tarlek, the crass and ineffectual station advertising sales agent, noted for his garish plaid suits and white shoes. 

Bonner appeared as a guest star in two episodes of the sitcom &quot;Night Court&quot; in the 1980s. From 1988 to 1990, Bonner played the role of Father Hargis, headmaster of the fictional St. Augustine&#x27;s Academy, on the TV show &quot;Just the Ten of Us&quot;, which was a spin-off of &quot;Growing Pains&quot;. He also appeared in one of the early episodes of the television show &quot;Newhart&quot;. He reprised the role of Herb Tarlek in the 1991 spinoff &quot;The New WKRP in Cincinnati&quot; and in a 2004 rock video for Canadian indie rock band Rheostatics (for the song &quot;The Tarleks&quot;, from their album &quot;2067&quot;).

After directing six episodes of &quot;WKRP in Cincinnati,&quot; he directed for other television shows in the 1980s and 1990s, including &quot;Who&#x27;s the Boss?&quot;, &quot;Head of the Class&quot; (starring his WKRP alumni Howard Hesseman), &quot;Evening Shade&quot;, &quot;Newhart&quot;, and every episode of the NBC Saturday morning sitcom &quot;City Guys&quot;. Bonner also appeared in five episodes of &quot;Saved by the Bell: The New Class&quot;, and directed four episodes.

==Personal life==
Bonner was married to Sharon Gray from 1966–1971; actress Mary Alice Rings from 1972–1975; playwright Lillian Garrett-Groag from 1977–1980; Catherine M. Sherwood from 1981 until their divorce (date indeterminate); and Gayle Hardage, his former high school sweetheart in Malvern, Arkansas, from 2006 until his death. 

Frank Bonner had five children (four biological), seven grandchildren, and one great-grandchild at his death. He had a daughter, Desiree Boers-Kort, with his first wife, Sharon Gray. He had three sons (Michael, Matthew, and Justin); Michael predeceased his father. Bonner also had a step-daughter, DeAndra Freed.

In 1979, Bonner was injured in a parasailing accident at the El Mirage Lake Off-Highway Vehicle Recreation Area, northeast of Los Angeles. He was approximately in the air, suspended under an ascendancy parachute pulled by a tow vehicle — when a sudden, unexpected gust of wind collapsed the chute, causing him to fall to the lake bed and suffer internal injuries and injuries to his back. Subsequently, he appeared on crutches in episodes of &quot;WKRP in Cincinnati&quot; (the season 2 episode &quot;A Family Affair&quot;) and an All-Star Special episode of &quot;Family Feud&quot;.

==Death==
Bonner died on June 16, 2021, aged 79, in Laguna Niguel, California, of complications from Lewy body dementia.

<text>The Gravis UltraSound or GUS is a sound card for the IBM PC compatible system platform, made by Canada-based Advanced Gravis Computer Technology Ltd. It was very popular in the demoscene during the 1990s.

The Gravis UltraSound was notable at the time of its 1992 launch for providing the IBM PC platform with sample-based music synthesis technology (marketed as &quot;wavetable&quot;), that is the ability to use real-world sound recordings rather than artificial computer-generated waveforms as the basis of a musical instrument. Samples of pianos or trumpets, for example, sound more like their real respective instruments. With up to 32 hardware audio channels, the GUS was notable for MIDI playback quality with a large set of instrument patches that could be stored in its own RAM.

The cards were all manufactured on red PCBs, similar to fellow Canadian company ATI. They were only a little more expensive than Creative cards, undercutting many equivalent professional cards aimed at musicians by a huge margin.

== Versions ==

=== UltraSound (Classic) ===
The first UltraSound was released in early October 1992, along with the Gravis PC GamePad. The Ultrasound was one of the first PC soundcards to feature 16-bit, stereo. The final revision (v3.74) of the GUS Classic features of onboard RAM (upgradeable to 1024 kB through DIP sockets), hardware analog mixer, and support for 16-bit recording through a separate daughterboard based on the Crystal Semiconductor CS4231 audio codec.

====Reception====
&quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; in 1993 criticized the UltraSound&#x27;s Sound Blaster emulation and lack of native support in games, stating that &quot;it is hard to recommend this card to anyone other than a &quot;Windows&quot; MIDI musician&quot;.

===UltraSound MAX===

Released in 1994, UltraSound Max is a version of the GUS with a CS4231 codec on board, 512 kB of onboard RAM (upgradeable to 1024 kB with a single SOJ chip), and Panasonic/Sony/Mitsumi CD-ROM interface slots. CS4231 provides support for Windows Sound System specs, although the IO port range doesn&#x27;t match the WSS hardware, and can be used for SoundBlaster emulation. The software CD includes a demo that featured &quot;3D holographic sound&quot; through the use of software HRTF filters.

===UltraSound Plug &amp; Play (PnP)===
Released in 1995, the Ultrasound Plug &amp; Play was a new card based on AMD InterWave technology with a completely different sound set. Supposedly Synergy acted as the ODM-producer for it (as evidenced by their logo on the rear side of the card, although early and now very rare GUS PnP cards did not have the Synergy logo). The card features 1 MB of sound ROM, no onboard RAM (although it can be expanded to 8 MB with two 30-pin SIMMs), and an ATAPI CD-ROM interface. A &#x27;Pro&#x27; version adds 512 kB of on-board RAM required for compatibility with the GUS Classic.
In 2014, a RAM adapter for the 72-pin SIMM was produced by retro-computer enthusiasts that made it possible to install 16 MB of RAM on the &#x27;Pro&#x27; version without any modifications to the card.

===UltraSound ACE (Audio Card Enhancer)===
Released in 1995, this budget version of UltraSound Classic has 512 kB of RAM (upgradable to 1024 kB, just as is the MAX), and has no game port or recording ability. Marketed as a competitor to Wave Blaster-compatible cards, it is supposed to be installed alongside a SoundBlaster Pro/16 card as a sample-based synthesis (marketed as &#x27;wavetable synthesis&#x27;) upgrade. A prototype of this card was named &quot;Sound Buddy&quot;.

===UltraSound CD3===
An OEM version of UltraSound Classic produced by Synergy, with of RAM. It features AT-BUS CD-ROM interfaces following Sony, Mitsumi and MKE/Panasonic standards. This is the only Gravis sound card with a green circuit board. It is similar to a few card clones, including the Primax SoundStorm Wave (model Sound M-16B) and the AltraSound.

===UltraSound Extreme===
Released in 1996, the UltraSound Extreme is a 3rd party OEM system combining the UltraSound Classic with an ESS AudioDrive ES1688 sound chip for Sound Blaster Pro and AdLib emulation. It was produced by Synergy as was the ViperMAX. It has 1 MB RAM by default, but cannot be upgraded any further.

===UltraSound Clones and OEM cards===
All clones use the original Gravis GF1 or the AMD InterWave soundchip.

* Primax SoundStorm Wave (GF1) - there are two variants of cards from the well known scanner and mouse producer. Re-labeled Altrasound as Sound M-16B and different Sound M-16C with 4x CD-ROM Interfaces.
* D&amp;B UltraWave (GF1) - this card has onboard RAM by default, upgradeable to RAM using a SOJ-40 DRAM chip. Has a DIP socket for a boot ROM (optional) and an IDE interface (secondary).
* Synergy ViperMAX (GF1) - same card later repacked as UltraSound Extreme, but with only RAM on board.
* Expertcolor MED3201 (InterWave LC) - probably the only card with cut-down variant of GFA1 chip - AM78C200 InterWave LC. First series was with standard Am78C201KC.
* Compaq Ultra-Sound 32 (InterWave) - one of the last InterWave cards was designed for Compaq Presario desktops. Newer &quot;C&quot; revision of InterWave - AM78C201AKC and TEA6330T fader. Produced by STB Systems.
* STB Systems Soundrage 32 (InterWave) - standard InterWave card missing SIMM slots and IDE interface. There was &quot;Pro&quot; variant with 512 kB RAM. AM78C201KC chip.
* Core Dynamics DYNASonix 3D/PRO (InterWave) - features additional DSP chip that offered a graphic equalizer and additional sound FX presets.
* Philips PCA761AW (InterWave) - card design closely resembles the &quot;AMD InterWave OEM Design&quot; prototype. Has a footprint for 512kb RAM, often left unpopulated. AM78C201KC chip.
* Reveal WAVExtreme 32 (InterWave) - AM78C201KC based design. Comes without RAM and has no sockets/footprints to add any.
* As of February 2015 there have been efforts by hobbyists to produce a new InterWave based UltraSound compatible soundcard named ARGUS.
* PicoGUS (OpenSource) - Pico Pi based design started in 2022 by Ian Scott. Community support built up over the subsequent years. As of 2024 its emulation has similar compatibility to an original GUS. The PicoGUS also includes support for Tandy 3 Voice like the Tandy 1000, Game Blaster / Sound Blaster 2.0 (Sound Blaster), and intelligent mode MPU-401 support. 

==GF1==
The GF1 was co-developed by Advanced Gravis and Forte Technologies (creator of the VFX1 Headgear virtual reality helmet) and produced by Integrated Circuit Systems under the ICS11614 moniker. The chip was derived from the Ensoniq OTTO (ES5506) chip, a next-generation version of the music-synthesizer chip found in the Ensoniq VFX and its successors.

The GF1 is purely a sample-based synthesis chip with the polyphony of 32 oscillators, so it can mix up to 32 mono PCM samples or 16 stereo samples entirely in hardware. The chip has no built-in codec, so the sounds must be downloaded to onboard RAM prior to playback. Sound compression algorithms such as IMA ADPCM are not supported, so compressed samples must be decompressed prior to loading.

The sound quality of the GF1 is not constant and depends on the selected level of polyphony. A CD-quality 44.1 kHz sample rate is maintainable with up to 14-voice polyphony; the sample rate progressively deteriorates until 19.2 kHz at the maximum of 32-voice polyphony. The polyphony level is software-programmable, so the programmer can choose the appropriate value to best match the application. Advanced sound effects such as reverberation and chorus are not supported in hardware. However, software simulation is possible; a basic &quot;echo&quot; effect can be simulated with additional tracks, and some trackers can program effects using additional hardware voices as accumulators.

===Sample RAM===
The UltraSound offers MIDI playback by loading instrument patches into adapter RAM located on the card, not unlike how instruments are stored in ROM on other sample-based cards (marketed as &quot;wavetable&quot; cards). The card comes with a 5.6 MB set of instrument patch (*.PAT) files; most patches are sampled at 16-bit resolution and looped to save space. The patch files can be continuously tweaked and updated in each software release.

The card&#x27;s various support programs use .INI files to describe what patches should be loaded for each program change event. This architecture allowed Gravis to incorporate a General MIDI-compatible mapping scheme. Windows 95 and 98 drivers use UltraSound.INI to load the patch files on demand. In DOS, the loading of the patches can be handled by &quot;UltraMID&quot;, a middleware TSR system provided by Gravis that removes the need to handle the hardware directly. Programmers are free to include the static version of the UltraMID library in their applications, eliminating the need for the TSR. The application programmer can choose to preload all patches from disk, resizing as necessary to fit into the UltraSound&#x27;s on-board RAM, or have the middleware track the patch change events and dynamically load them on demand. This latter strategy, while providing better sound quality, introduces a noticeable delay when loading patches, so most applications just preload a predefined set.

Each application can have its own UltraMID.INI containing a set of patch substitutions for every possible amount of sample RAM (256/512/768/1024 kB), so that similar instruments are used when there is not enough RAM to hold all of the patches needed (even after resampling to smaller sizes). Unused instruments are never loaded. This concept is similar to the handling of sample banks in digital samplers. Some games — including &quot;Doom&quot;, &quot;Doom II&quot; and &quot;Duke Nukem 3D&quot; — come with their own optimized UltraMID.INI.

The UltraSound cards gained great popularity in the PC tracker music community. The tracker format was originally developed on the Commodore Amiga personal computer in 1987, but due to the PC becoming more capable of producing high-quality graphics and sound, the demoscene spilled out onto the platform in droves and took the tracker format with it. Typical tracker formats of the era included MOD, S3M, and later XM. The format stores the notes and instruments digitally in the file instead of relying on a sound card to reproduce the instruments. A tracker module, when saved to disk, typically incorporates all the sequencing data and samples, and typically the composer would incorporate their assumed name into the list of samples. This primitive precursor to the modern sampler opened the way for Gravis to enter the market, because the requirements matched the capabilities of the GF1 chip ideally. The problem with other sound cards playing these formats was that they had to downmix voices into one or both of its output channels in software, further deteriorating the quality of 8-bit samples in the process. An UltraSound card was able to download the samples to its RAM and mix them using fast and high-quality hardware implementation, offloading the CPU from the task. Gravis realized early on that the demo scene support could be a sales booster, and they gave away 6000 cards for free to the most famous scene groups and people in the scene.

===Compatibility===
As the GF1 chip does not contain AdLib-compatible OPL2 circuitry or a codec chip, Sound Blaster compatibility was difficult to achieve at best. Consumers were expected to use the included emulation software to emulate other standards, an activity not necessary with many other cards that emulated the Sound Blaster through their sound hardware. The emulation software ran as a huge TSR that was difficult to manage in the pre-Windows days of complicated DOS extenders.

Although there was native support for many popular games that used middleware sound libraries like HMI (Human Machine Interfaces) Sound Operating System, the Miles Audio Interface Libraries (AIL), the Miles Sound System or others, the user had to patch the games by replacing the existing sound drivers with the UltraSound versions provided on the installation CD. Also, the UltraSound required two DMA channels for full-duplex operation, and 16-bit channels were generally faster, so many users chose to use them, but this led to errors for games that used the DOS/4GW DOS extender, which was common in the UltraSound&#x27;s era.

The two principal software sound emulators included with software package were:
*&quot;SBOS&quot;, Sound Board OS — Sound Blaster Pro 8-bit stereo emulation and AdLib FM synthesis. It was a real-mode software emulator that recreated the AdLib&#x27;s OPL2 FM synth chip and required that the user have a 286 processor or better. There were special versions for the UltraSound MAX (MAXSBOS) and AMD InterWave-based cards (IWSBOS), which made use of the CS4231 codec chip instead.
*&quot;Mega-Em&quot; — advanced emulation software that required at least a 386 processor and EMM manager with DPMI/VCPI support. Mega-Em emulated the 8-bit Sound Blaster circuitry for sound effects and the Roland MT-32/LAPC-I or Roland Sound Canvas/MPU-401 for music. It supported UltraMID TSR functionality.

==AMD InterWave==

The great potential of the original UltraSound enabled Advanced Gravis to license the new GFA1 chip and software to AMD, who were trying to enter the sound chip market at the time. The chip, released in 1995, was named AMaDeus, with the AMD part number of Am78C201 and was marketed as InterWave. It was enhanced to handle up to 16 MB of onboard memory, IMA ADPCM-compressed samples, have no sample rate drop at full 32 voices, and featured additional logic to support hardware emulation of FM synthesis and simple delay-based digital sound effects such as reverb and chorus. It was compatible with CS4231 codec installed in the UltraSound MAX or 16-bit recording daughterboard for the UltraSound Classic.

The sound &quot;patch set&quot; was reworked from a collection of individual instrument .PAT files to a unified .FFF/.DAT sound bank format, resembling SoundFont, which could be either ROM or RAM based. There were 4 versions of the sound bank: a full 16-bit 4 MB with 8-bit downsampled 2 MB version, and 16-bit 2 MB (different sample looping) with 8-bit downsampled 1 MB version. A converter utility, GIPC, was provided for making .FFF/.DAT banks out of .PAT/.INI collections.

The reference card contained a 1 MB μ-law ADPCM compressed sound ROM, which contained basic General MIDI voices and sound samples to help FM emulation, and 2 slots for RAM expansion through 30-pin SIMMs. The IWSBOS emulator was reworked to include Mega-Em features such as General MIDI emulation, and the SBOS kernel was included in Windows 95 drivers to provide emulation in a DOS Box window.

The process of patching middleware sound &#x27;drivers&#x27; was greatly simplified with PREPGAME utility, which could fix most known DOS games automatically either by correctly installing and configuring native InterWave drivers or replacing the binaries for some rare devices like Covox. It could also update DOS/4GW extender to work around its 16-bit DMA bug.

The GFA1 featured a GUS/MAX compatibility mode, but the base card was not compatible with the UltraSound Classic unless some memory was installed.

The InterWave technology was used in the Gravis &quot;UltraSound PnP&quot; line of cards. It was also licensed to various OEMs such as STB Systems, Reveal, Compaq, Core Dynamics, Philips and ExpertColor. Some high-end OEM variants contained a full-blown 4 MB patch set in ROM and proprietary hardware DSPs to enable features like additional sound effect algorithms and graphic equalizer.

Software drivers for the InterWave were written by eTek Labs, containing the same development team as the earlier Forte Technologies effort. eTek Labs was split off from Forte Technologies just prior to this effort. In August 1999, eTek Labs was acquired by Belkin and is currently their research and development team.

==Demise==
Some game developers of the time noted problems with the software development kit and the product&#x27;s hardware design. On the user-side, the Sound Blaster emulation was especially hard to get right out of the box, and this resulted in a substantially high number of product returns at the store level and thus soured the retail channel on the product. Bundled software was refined over time, but Gravis could not distribute updates effectively.

The company itself also created its own trouble. When Gravis&#x27;s list of promised supporting game titles failed to materialize, the company lost credibility with consumers and commercial developers. Several publishers and developers threatened to sue the company over misrepresentation of their products — pointing to outright fabrication of Gravis&#x27;s list.

The shareware games industry embraced the Gravis more than the retail games industry. Companies which did this in an early stage were publisher Apogee and developers id software and Epic MegaGames. Gravis can also claim victory in the demoscene, which had taken the GUS to its heart, ensuring a dedicated cult following for a number of years. But without the marketing and developer presence of Creative Labs, Gravis could not generate either the sales or support required for the Gravis soundcard to compete in the mainstream market against the de facto standard Soundblaster.

Although the InterWave chip was a substantially improved version of the GF1 chip, this new design was not able to hold up with the Sound Blaster AWE32. More than that, AMD was facing financial troubles at the time so it was forced to close many projects, including the InterWave.

Due to declining sales, Gravis was eventually forced out of the soundcard business, and the UltraSound&#x27;s failure nearly took the entire company down with it. Advanced Gravis, once one of the dominant players in the PC peripherals marketplace, had bet much of the future of the company on the UltraSound and paid the price for its demise. Shareholders sued the company charging gross incompetence by its management, in regards to the entire UltraSound effort. After significant restructuring, including acquisition by competitor Kensington Technology Group (via its parent, ACCO World Corp), the company retreated to its core market, the one which had made it a success — joysticks and gamepads.

<text>Michigan Stadium, nicknamed &quot;The Big House,&quot; is the American football stadium for the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, Michigan. It is the largest stadium in the United States and the Western Hemisphere, the third-largest stadium in the world, and the 34th-largest sports venue in the world. Its official capacity is 107,601, but it has hosted crowds in excess of 115,000.

Michigan Stadium was built in 1927 at a cost of $950,000 (equivalent to $ in ) and had an original capacity of 72,000. Prior to the stadium&#x27;s construction, the Wolverines played football at Ferry Field. Every home game since November 8, 1975 has drawn a crowd in excess of 100,000, an active streak of more than 300 contests. On September 7, 2013, the game between Michigan and the Notre Dame Fighting Irish attracted a crowd of 115,109, a record attendance for a college football game since 1948, and an NCAA single-game attendance record at the time, overtaking the previous record of 114,804 set two years previously for the same matchup.

Michigan Stadium was designed with footings to allow the stadium&#x27;s capacity to be expanded beyond 100,000. Fielding Yost envisioned a day where 150,000 seats would be needed. To keep construction costs low at the time, the decision was made to build a smaller stadium than Yost envisioned but to include the footings for future expansion.

Michigan Stadium is used for the University of Michigan&#x27;s main graduation ceremonies; President Lyndon B. Johnson outlined his Great Society program at the 1964 commencement ceremonies in the stadium. It has also hosted hockey games including the 2014 NHL Winter Classic, a regular season NHL game between the Toronto Maple Leafs and the Detroit Red Wings with an official attendance of 105,491, a record for a hockey game. Additionally, a 2014 International Champions Cup soccer match between Real Madrid and Manchester United had an attendance of 109,318, a record crowd for a soccer match in the United States.

==History==
===20th century===

Prior to playing at Michigan Stadium, Michigan played its games at Ferry Field, which at its peak could seat 40,000 people. Fielding Yost recognized the need for a larger stadium after original expansions to Ferry Field proved to be too small, and persuaded the regents to build a permanent stadium in 1926. Fashioned after the Yale Bowl, the original stadium was built with a capacity of 72,000, though Yost originally wanted to have a capacity of 140,000. At Yost&#x27;s urging, temporary bleachers were added at the top of the stadium, increasing capacity to 82,000.

On October 1, 1927, Michigan played Ohio Wesleyan in the first game at Michigan Stadium, prevailing easily, 33–0. The new stadium was then formally dedicated three weeks later in a contest against Ohio State on October 22. Michigan had spoiled the formal dedication of Ohio Stadium in Columbus five years earlier and was victorious again, besting the Buckeyes 21–0 before a standing-room-only crowd of 84,401. In 1930, electronic scoreboards were installed, making the stadium the first in the United States to use them to keep the official game time.

In 1956, the addition of a press box raised the stadium&#x27;s official capacity to 101,001. The one &quot;extra seat&quot; in Michigan Stadium is said to be reserved for Fritz Crisler, athletic director at the time. Since then, all official Michigan Stadium capacity figures have ended in &quot;-01&quot;, although the extra seat&#x27;s location is not specified.

Before 1968, Michigan Stadium maintained a policy of &quot;No women or children allowed on the field&quot;. Sara Krulwich, now a photojournalist for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, was the first woman on the field. Longtime radio announcer Bob Ufer dubbed Michigan Stadium &quot;The hole that Yost dug, Crisler paid for, Canham carpeted, and Schembechler fills every cotton-pickin&#x27; Saturday afternoon&quot;. Since November 8, 1975, the stadium has held over 100,000 fans for every home game (the Indiana University contest on October 25, 1975 attracted &quot;only&quot; 93,857 fans).—and 24 of the 25 most attended NCAA games are at the stadium. Michigan Stadium&#x27;s size is not wholly apparent from the outside as most of the seats are below ground level.

By the mid-1980s, Michigan Stadium had become known by the nickname &quot;The Big House&quot;.

===21st century===

Michigan&#x27;s game versus Ball State University on November 4, 2006, was the 200th consecutive crowd of over 100,000 fans. When the game&#x27;s attendance is announced, the public address announcer, historically Howard King, thanks the fans for &quot;being part of the largest crowd watching a football game anywhere in America today&quot;.

On September 9, 2006, attendees of Michigan&#x27;s football game against the Central Michigan Chippewas endured the first weather delay in the stadium&#x27;s history after lightning struck nearby during the first quarter and play was suspended for approximately one hour.

On September 3, 2011, Michigan and Western Michigan mutually agreed to end their game with 1:27 left in the third quarter because of an ongoing lightning delay. It was the first time Michigan had a football game called because of lightning. The stadium was evacuated at 6:38 p.m. and the game was called shortly after 7:00.

On June 21, 2007, the University&#x27;s Board of Regents approved a $226 million renovation (equivalent to $ in ) and expansion project for Michigan Stadium. The project included replacement of some bleachers, widening of aisles and individual seats, installing hand rails, and the addition of a new press box, 83 luxury boxes, and 3,200 club seats. The renovation plan garnered opposition from a small number of students, alumni, and fans around the country, which waned as the renovation neared external completion.

A disabled-veterans group filed a federal lawsuit against the university on April 17, 2007, alleging that the design of the project did not meet federal standards for wheelchair-accessible seating.

On March 11, 2008, as part of the settlement terms of a lawsuit filed against the university pursuant to the Americans with Disabilities Act, the university announced that the official capacity of the stadium would be reduced to accommodate additional wheelchair-accessible seating beginning with the 2009 season. The project was completed before the 2010 season.

Renovations in April 2008 caused that year&#x27;s University of Michigan graduation ceremony to be moved to the Diag.

In August 2011, the University completed a six-month scoreboard replacement project; the new boards measure each with a resolution of 900 x 1632.

Michigan Stadium was rededicated on September 4, 2010, before Michigan&#x27;s first home football game of the 2010 season against the University of Connecticut, with a listed capacity of 109,901.

After the renovation, the stadium lacked permanent lights, although platforms for temporary lights were included in the design. In September 2010, a few days after the rededication, the University of Michigan&#x27;s Board of Regents approved a plan to add permanent lights, at a cost of $1.8 million (equivalent to $ in ). The lights were first used at the men&#x27;s hockey game on December 11, 2010. The following season saw the stadium&#x27;s first night football game on September 10, 2011. The Wolverines defeated the Notre Dame Fighting Irish 35–31.

The Michigan lacrosse program was elevated to NCAA varsity status in spring 2011, effective in the 2011–12 academic year. The team played most of its 2012 games in Michigan Stadium, including a match against Ohio State on April 14, 2012, after the annual Wolverine football spring game.

Before the 2023 season, new video boards were installed in the north and south end zones. The identically-sized screens each measure or , are the third-largest in college football behind the video boards at Jordan-Hare Stadium and Ross–Ade Stadium, and are among the largest in the world. The new video boards were part of a $41 million Michigan athletic department renovation that also upgraded the production room and audio system, and introduced a new LED stadium lighting system.

The renovations also included replacing the video boards at Alumni Field at Carol Hutchins Stadium, home of Michigan softball; Cliff Keen Arena, home of Michigan men&#x27;s gymnastics, women&#x27;s volleyball, and wrestling; Phyllis Ocker Field, home of Michigan field hockey; Ray Fisher Stadium, home of Michigan baseball; and U-M Soccer Stadium, home of Michigan men&#x27;s soccer and women&#x27;s soccer.

==Seating and surface==
The stadium&#x27;s original capacity was 72,000, but Fielding Yost made certain to install footings that could allow for expansion over 100,000 seats. Initially, all seating consisted of wooden bleachers. These were replaced with permanent metal seating in 1949 by Fritz Crisler, athletic director at the time. From 1927 to 1968, the stadium&#x27;s field was natural grass. This was replaced with 3M TartanTurf in 1969 to give players better traction. However, this surface was thought to be unforgiving on players&#x27; joints, and the stadium returned to natural grass in 1991. This too became problematic, as the field&#x27;s below-surface location near the water table made it difficult for grass to permanently take root. The field was converted to FieldTurf, an artificial surface designed to give grass-like playing characteristics, in 2003. In 2010, it was upgraded with a newer version of FieldTurf called Duraspine.

==Attendance records==
Michigan Stadium holds the NCAA single-season average home attendance record, set in 2012 at 112,252 fans per game.

On September 7, 2013, Michigan Stadium drew a crowd of 115,109 to see Michigan defeat Notre Dame 41–30, which at the time represented a post-1948 NCAA collegiate football attendance record. Previously, and prior to NCAA record keeping for attendance, a 1927 Notre Dame–USC game at Soldier Field in Chicago drew an estimated 117,000–123,000. Both of these records fell in 2016 when Tennessee and Virginia Tech drew 156,990 for a game held at Bristol Motor Speedway, a NASCAR track with a capacity of over 150,000.

&quot;The Big House&quot; also holds the record for the largest attendance for an NCAA Division II football game, one involving Slippery Rock University of Pennsylvania. Back in 1959, stadium announcer Steve Filipiak thought it would be amusing to include Slippery Rock with the other football scores he read to the crowd, due to the school&#x27;s unusual name. Soon, it was a tradition, and Slippery Rock became so popular with U of M fans that on September 29, 1979, &quot;The Rock&quot; played in-state rival Shippensburg at Michigan Stadium, in front of 61,143 fans (Shippensburg won, 45-14). Slippery Rock made repeat trips to Ann Arbor in 1981 and 2014.

With an attendance of 104,173, &quot;The Big Chill at the Big House&quot; set the record attendance for a hockey game. The record was broken on January 1, 2014 for the NHL&#x27;s 2014 Winter Classic, where a crowd of 105,491 saw the host Detroit Red Wings fall to the Toronto Maple Leafs in a shootout.

On Saturday, August 2, 2014, a sell-out crowd of 109,318 watched Manchester United defeat Real Madrid 3-1 in an International Champions Cup match. The official attendance figure was the largest for a soccer game in the United States to date, overtaking the previous record set by the 1984 Olympics Gold Medal match, when 101,799 saw France defeat Brazil 2-0 at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California. Michigan Stadium also holds three of the top four U.S. Soccer attendances as a crowd of 105,826 watched a 2016 International Champions Cup match on July 30, 2016 where Real Madrid defeated Chelsea 3-2 and a crowd of 101,254 watched a 2018 International Champions Cup match on July 28, 2018 where Liverpool defeated Manchester United 4-1.

<text>Richard Sanders (born August 23, 1940) is a retired American actor and screenwriter. He played quirky news anchorman Les Nessman on the CBS sitcom &quot;WKRP in Cincinnati&quot; (1978–1982). Most of his acting career has been on television.

==Early life and education==

Sanders was born in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, the son of Thelma S. and Henry Irvine Sanders. After graduating from Leavenworth High School in Leavenworth, Kansas, he was enrolled in the Fine Arts Department at Carnegie Institute of Technology (now known as Carnegie Mellon University) as an acting major. There, he was a classmate of René Auberjonois and Aubrey Wilson, among others.

== Career ==
After graduating from college, Sanders studied Shakespearean theatre in England on a Fulbright Scholarship, and served a stint with the Peace Corps in the states of Paraíba and Rio Grande do Norte, Brazil.

Sanders joined Gordon Jump and Frank Bonner in reprising his original &quot;WKRP&quot; role on &quot;The New WKRP in Cincinnati&quot; in the early 1990s. He has guest-appeared on other television shows, including &quot;Lou Grant&quot;, &quot;Kojak&quot;, &quot;The Rockford Files&quot;, &quot;Alice&quot;, &quot;Newhart&quot;, &quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot;, &quot;Designing Women&quot;, and &quot;Married... with Children&quot;, and has also acted in the mini-series &quot;&quot;, the animated series &quot;Inhumanoids&quot;, the horror film &quot;Lovers Lane&quot;, and the Robert De Niro/Cuba Gooding Jr. film &quot;Men of Honor&quot;.

Besides being an actor, Sanders is a screenwriter, having written, among other works, several episodes of &quot;WKRP in Cincinnati&quot;. In 1993, he starred in the computer game &quot;Day of the Tentacle&quot; as the voice of Bernard Bernoulli.

<doc id="926384" wikidata="Q437752" url="?curid=926384" title="Loudon Wainwright III">
<text>Loudon Snowden Wainwright III (born September 5, 1946) is an American singer-songwriter and occasional actor. He has released twenty-six studio albums, four live albums, and six compilations. Some of his best-known songs include &quot;The Swimming Song&quot;, &quot;Motel Blues&quot;, &quot;The Man Who Couldn&#x27;t Cry&quot;, &quot;Dead Skunk&quot;, and &quot;Lullaby&quot;. In 2007, he collaborated with musician Joe Henry to create the soundtrack for Judd Apatow&#x27;s film &quot;Knocked Up&quot;. In addition to music, he has acted in small roles in at least eighteen television programs and feature films, including three episodes in the third season of the series &quot;M*A*S*H&quot;.

Reflecting upon his career in 1999, he stated, &quot;You could characterize the catalog as somewhat checkered, although I prefer to think of it as a tapestry.&quot; In 2017, Wainwright released his autobiography, &quot;Liner Notes: On Parents &amp; Children, Exes &amp; Excess, Death &amp; Decay, and a Few of My Other Favorite Things&quot;. He is the brother of singer Sloan Wainwright and has four children, including musicians Rufus Wainwright, Martha Wainwright, and Lucy Wainwright Roche. He has been married and divorced twice, including to folk singer Kate McGarrigle.

==Early life==
Wainwright was born in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, the son of Martha Taylor, a yoga teacher, and Loudon Wainwright Jr., a columnist and editor for &quot;Life&quot; magazine. His great-great-grandfather was the politician and diplomat A. Loudon Snowden. His father was not a professional musician, but he played the piano and wrote some songs, exposing his children to musicians such as Tom Lehrer and Stan Freberg, whom Wainwright later cited as influences. Wainwright grew up in Bedford, New York, in Westchester County. Among his sisters is Sloan Wainwright, also a singer. Like his father, he attended St. Andrew&#x27;s School near Middletown, Delaware.

==Career==
Wainwright&#x27;s career began in the late 1960s. He had played the guitar while in school but subsequently sold it for yoga lessons while living in San Francisco. Later, in Rhode Island, Wainwright&#x27;s grandmother got him a job working in a boatyard. An old lobsterman named Edgar inspired him to borrow a friend&#x27;s guitar and write his first song, &quot;Edgar&quot;. Wainwright soon bought his own guitar and in about a year wrote nearly twenty songs. He went to Boston and New York City to play in folk clubs and was eventually noticed by Milton Kramer, who became his manager. He signed a record deal with Atlantic, which released his self-titled debut album in 1970.

Wainwright is perhaps best known for the 1972 novelty song &quot;Dead Skunk (in the Middle of the Road)&quot; and for playing Captain Calvin Spalding (the &quot;singing surgeon&quot;) on the American television show &quot;M*A*S*H&quot;. His appearances spanned three episodes in the show&#x27;s third season (1974–1975).

Using a witty, self-mocking style, Wainwright has recorded over twenty albums on eleven different labels. Three of his albums have been nominated for Grammy Awards: &quot;I&#x27;m Alright&quot; (1985), &quot;More Love Songs&quot; (1986), and &quot;High Wide &amp; Handsome: The Charlie Poole Project&quot; (2009), for which he won the Grammy for Best Traditional Folk Album in January 2010.

Wainwright has also appeared in a number of films, including small parts in &quot;The Aviator&quot; (with two of his children), &quot;Big Fish&quot;, &quot;Elizabethtown&quot;, &quot;The 40-Year-Old Virgin&quot;, &quot;28 Days&quot;, and &quot;Knocked Up&quot;, and the television series &quot;Undeclared&quot; and &quot;Parks and Recreation&quot;. In the UK, he recorded sessions for John Peel from 1971 onwards and appeared on a simultaneous broadcast on BBC TV and on Radio 1 in February 1978 (known as &quot;Sight and Sound in Concert&quot;). However, it was in the late 1980s that he gained much wider popularity in Britain, when he appeared as the resident singer with comedian Jasper Carrott on his show &quot;Carrott Confidential&quot;.

He appeared as a musical guest on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; in the first season&#x27;s fifth episode, which was hosted by Robert Klein and broadcast on November 15, 1975. He performed &quot;Bicentennial&quot; and &quot;Unrequited to the Nth Degree&quot;.

Wainwright has said that, like many of his contemporaries, he was inspired musically by seeing Bob Dylan at the Newport Folk Festival in 1963. He was one of many young folk singers tagged as the &quot;new Dylan&quot; in the early 1970s, a fact that he later ruefully satirized in his song &quot;Talking New Bob Dylan&quot; from the album &quot;History&quot; (1992).

Wainwright was a judge for the fourth annual AIM Independent Music Awards.

The singer entered a period of deep depression following the death of his mother in 1997 and believed he could never write again. Retreating to his mother&#x27;s cabin in the woods, he underwent therapy and gradually recovered, eventually recording &quot;Last Man on Earth&quot; in 2001.

Wainwright and musician Joe Henry composed the music for the 2007 Judd Apatow film &quot;Knocked Up&quot;. In addition to composing the soundtrack, Wainwright appeared in the film in a supporting role as the protagonists&#x27; obstetrician. He has also composed music for the new theatre production of Carl Hiaasen&#x27;s &quot;Lucky You&quot;, which premiered at the 2008 Edinburgh Festival Fringe.

==Personal life==
===Relationships and family===
Wainwright&#x27;s first marriage, to singer-songwriter Kate McGarrigle, ended in divorce. During their marriage, they had two children: Rufus and Martha, both of whom are musicians.

Wainwright later had a relationship with singer Suzzy Roche, during which they had a daughter, Lucy Wainwright Roche, who is also a musician. The relationship ended, although Wainwright and Suzzy Roche remain on good terms and occasionally appear onstage together, sometimes with Lucy.

Wainwright&#x27;s second marriage was to Ritamarie Kelly, and the couple lived in Los Angeles. This also ended in divorce. They have a daughter, Alexandra (Lexie) Kelly Wainwright (born 1993).

Since 2015, Wainwright has lived with Susan Morrison, an editor at &quot;The New Yorker&quot;.

===Mutual inspiration for songs===
Wainright&#x27;s first wife, Kate McGarrigle, wrote her song &quot;Go Leave&quot; about him. In it, she recounts how in the 1970s, he, her then-husband, ran off to Europe with performance artist Penny Arcade. McGarrigle, who was pregnant at the time with what would have been their third child, traveled from Canada to England in search of him. After finding him, she lost the baby, and Wainwright informed her that he was leaving her. Their daughter, Martha, has said that it is &quot;the most gut-wrenchingly painful song ever. At the end, you hear the sound of a tear falling on to a string of her guitar. I used to listen to it as a child and cry my eyes out&quot;.

Wainright&#x27;s son, Rufus, was the inspiration behind two of Wainwright&#x27;s songs: &quot;Rufus Is a Tit Man&quot; (referring to his breastfeeding) and &quot;A Father and a Son&quot;, a retrospective. Rufus has written the song &quot;Dinner at Eight&quot; about his conflicted relationship with his father. 

Martha and her father sang a duet on &quot;Father Daughter Dialogue&quot; (on Loudon&#x27;s 1995 album, &quot;Grown Man&quot;) and collaborated on the song &quot;You Never Phone&quot; (on Loudon&#x27;s 2003 live album, &quot;So Damn Happy&quot;). Wainwright&#x27;s songs inspired by his first daughter, Martha, are &quot;That Hospital&quot; (about visiting a hospital during her gestation for an attempted abortion) &quot;Pretty Little Martha&quot; (about her as an infant), &quot;Five Years Old&quot; (about missing her fifth birthday), the confessional &quot;Hitting You&quot; (about assaulting her), the duet &quot;Father/Daughter Dialogue&quot;, and &quot;I&#x27;d Rather Be Lonely&quot;. In 2005, Martha told &quot;The Guardian&quot;, &quot;For most of my childhood Loudon talked to me in song, which is a bit of a shitty thing to do, especially as he always makes himself come across as funny and charming while the rest of us seem like whining victims, and we can&#x27;t tell our side of the story. As a result he has a daughter who smokes and drinks too much and writes songs with titles like &#x27;Bloody Mother Fucking Asshole&#x27;.&quot; Regarding &quot;Hitting You&quot;, Wainwright has said, &quot;I would never forget that event, that incident... hauling off and whacking my kid...it&#x27;s not something I would ever forget. There was an interesting song there&quot;.

Martha had originally presumed that &quot;I&#x27;d Rather Be Lonely&quot; was about an old girlfriend and was shocked when Wainwright told an audience that it was about her. She revealed that she &quot;always felt terribly sorry for the poor woman I thought it was about because of the line: &#x27;Every time I see you cry you&#x27;re just a clone of every woman I&#x27;ve known&#x27;. Then one time I was on tour with Loudon and he said to the crowd: &#x27;I wrote this song about my daughter&#x27;. I had no idea. We lived together for one year in New York when I was 14 and it was a disaster, and &#x27;I&#x27;d Rather Be Lonely&#x27; was about that year. He really crossed the line there&quot;. In her memoir, &quot;Stories I Might Regret Telling You&quot;, Martha wrote that, when she heard the song&#x27;s key lines, &quot;You&#x27;re still living here with me / I&#x27;d rather be lonely&quot; and realized that the song was about her, &quot;A part of me wanted to jump to my death from my tiny seat. Or, better yet, take off into the night, leaving him standing there waiting for me. But the show must go on, so I dried my tears and went down the stairs and on to the stage&quot;.

<text>Gary Sandy (born December 25, 1945) is an American actor. He is best known for playing program director Andy Travis on the television sitcom &quot;WKRP in Cincinnati&quot; (1978–1982).

==Early life and education==
Sandy was born in Dayton, Ohio, the son of Austin and Dolores Sandy. He attended Fairmont High School in Kettering, Ohio, and lived in Moraine, Ohio. He later attended Wilmington College in Wilmington, Ohio, and the American Academy of Dramatic Arts in New York City.

== Television ==
Sandy&#x27;s early TV career included appearances on several soap operas in the early 1970s, and a number of appearances as a guest on shows including &quot;Medical Center&quot;, &quot;Barnaby Jones&quot;, &quot;Chips&quot;, and &quot;Starsky &amp; Hutch&quot;.

Sandy&#x27;s most notable role was as Andy Travis, the new program director at a struggling radio station on the CBS sitcom &quot;WKRP in Cincinnati&quot;. The idea for the show was based on the real experiences of several people who had worked in the industry, including creator Hugh Wilson. 

== Theater ==
In 1982, he replaced Kevin Kline as The Pirate King on Broadway in &quot;The Pirates of Penzance&quot;. In 1986, he replaced Tony Roberts as Mortimer Brewster in the fiftieth anniversary production of &quot;Arsenic and Old Lace&quot; opposite Jean Stapleton, Marion Ross, Larry Storch, and Jonathan Frid, and continued the role in the North American tour. In 1992, he played Billy Flynn in the Los Angeles production of &quot;Chicago&quot; alongside Juliet Prowse and Bebe Neuwirth. Beginning in 2001, he starred opposite Ann-Margret in a stage production of &quot;The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas&quot;, which toured for two years.

He continues to perform in regional theater and has performed such roles as Elliot Garfield in &quot;The Goodbye Girl&quot; and Mike Hammer. He has said that it bothers him being known for a &#x27;70s TV show.

<doc id="926387" wikidata="Q254156" url="?curid=926387" title="Egyptian Museum of Berlin">
<text>The Egyptian Museum and Papyrus Collection of Berlin () is home to one of the world&#x27;s most important collections of ancient Egyptian artefacts, including the Nefertiti Bust. Since 1855, the collection is a part of the Neues Museum on Berlin&#x27;s Museum Island, which reopened after renovations in 2009.

==History==
The museum originated in the 18th century from the royal art collection of the Hohenzollern kings of Prussia. Alexander von Humboldt had recommended that an Egyptian section be created, and the first objects were brought to Berlin in 1828 under King Friedrich Wilhelm III. Initially housed in Monbijou Palace, the department was headed by the Trieste merchant Giuseppe Passalacqua (1797–1865), whose extensive collections formed the basis. A Prussian expedition to Egypt and Nubia led by Karl Richard Lepsius in 1842–45 brought additional pieces to Berlin.

In 1850, the collections moved to its present-day home in the Neues Museum, built according to plans designed by Friedrich August Stüler. The Nefertiti Bust, discovered during the excavations by Ludwig Borchardt in Amarna, was donated to the museum by the entrepreneur Henri James Simon in 1920; it quickly became its best-known exhibit. After World War II, during which the Neues Museum was heavily damaged by strategic bombing, the collections were divided between East and West Berlin. The main part remained in East Berlin and was displayed at the Bode Museum, while those artifacts evacuated to West Germany, including the Nefertiti Bust, returned to West Berlin. From 1967 to 2005, these items were housed vis-à-vis Charlottenburg Palace. The whole collection was reunited again after the Reunification of Germany, when it returned to Museum Island.

==Collection==
The collection contains artefacts dating from between 4000 BC (the Predynastic era) to the period of Roman rule, though most date from the rule of Akhenaten (around 1340BC).

The most famous piece on display is the exceptionally well preserved and vividly coloured bust of Queen Nefertiti. The collection was moved from Charlottenburg to the Altes Museum in 2005 and was rehoused within the newly reconstructed Neues Museum on Berlin&#x27;s Museum Island in October 2009.

The museum is home to at least 23 mummified ancient Egyptians. In the 2020s the CT scans were performed on the mummies as part of a study into the mummification of hearts. At the same time the CT scans were examined to try and establish the mummified individuals sex and the age at which they died.

<text>Baco blanc or Baco 22A is a French-American hybrid grape variety. It is a cross of Folle blanche and the Noah grape, created in 1898 by the grape breeder François Baco. Folle blanche is its &quot;Vitis vinifera&quot; parent. Noah, its other parent, is itself a cross of &quot;Vitis labrusca&quot; and &quot;Vitis riparia&quot;. 

Baco blanc was developed to produce some of the same flavors as Folle blanche but without the susceptibility to American grape disease and phylloxera. In the 20th century it was widely planted in the Gascony region for uses in brandy production. Both Armagnac and Cognac (from the Charentes and Charente-Maritime districts north of Gascony) are brandies made from white grapes – Ugni blanc, Folle blanche and Colombard – but only Armagnac was permitted under French regulations to use Baco blanc and until the late 1970s, Baco blanc was the primary grape of Armagnac. 

Following the grape&#x27;s decline in the late 20th century, there was some speculation about the future of the variety, especially after a 1992 &quot;Institut National des Appellations d&#x27;Origine&quot; (INAO) decree that all vines of Baco blanc were to be uprooted by 2010. However, advocates for the grape variety and its historical role in Armagnac were able to persuade French authorities to continue permitting its use in the distilled wines from the Armagnac region.

==History and parentage==
 Baco blanc was bred in 1898 by French grape breeder François Baco from a crossing of the &quot;Vitis vinifera&quot; Folle blanche, which was having difficulties taking to the rootstock grafting after the phylloxera epidemic of the mid to late 19th century, and the American hybrid grape Noah (itself a previously crossing of an unknown &quot;Vitis labrusca&quot; species and the &quot;Vitis riparia&quot; grape Taylor. Four years earlier François Baco had used Folle blanche and an unknown species of &quot;Vitis riparia&quot; to produce a dark skin version of Baco blanc known as Baco noir.

Prior to Baco noir&#x27;s development, Folle blanche was the primarily grape variety for the &quot;eau de vie&quot; grape brandies produced in the Cognac and Armagnac regions of France. But, in addition to its difficulties with the new American rootstock, the grape was highly susceptible to several grape diseases including grey rot in the Cognac region and black rot in Armagnac. The aim of François Baco was to produce a grape that had many of the neutral flavors and characteristics which made Folle blanche favorable for distillation but without the susceptibility that had plagued Folle Blanche growers. While growers in the Cognac region began adopting Ugni blanc (the same grape known in Italy as Trebbiano), growers in the Armagnac region began to enthusiastically plant Baco&#x27;s new white hybrid. 

For most of the 20th century, Baco blanc was the primary grape of the Armagnac region. Its reached it peak in the 1970s when more than 85% of all plantings in the area were Baco blanc, accounting for more than . However, as Ugni blanc began gaining more of a foothold in other Gascon wine regions, the plantings of Baco blanc began to gradually decline. By the end of the 20th century, Ugni blanc had eclipsed Baco blanc as the most widely planted grape in Armagnac.

This decline led to some speculation about the future of the variety, especially after a 1992 (INAO) decree that all vines of Baco blanc were to be uprooted by 2010. However, advocates for the grape variety and its historical role in Armagnac were able to persuade French authorities to continue permitting its use in the distilled wines from the Armagnac region. While far from its early to mid-20th century prominence, the variety continues to play an important role in the Armagnac region and, as of 2005, the &quot;Bureau National Interprofessionnel de L&#x27;Armagnac&quot; (BNIA) reported that the grape variety was still used in the production of nearly half of all Armagnac.

==Wine regions==

Baco blanc is found primarily in France and was one of the &quot;work-horse&quot; hybrids that the country turned to following the phylloxera epidemic of the late 19th century. While scattered plantings could be found throughout France, most of the Baco blanc plantings could be found on the west side of the country (in many of the areas where its parent vine, Folle blanche is found, from the South West France wine regions of Gascony all the way to the Loire Valley where it was particularly popular Muscadet and Anjou wine-Saumur regions of the &quot;Middle Loire&quot;. The early to the mid-20th century saw a particular &quot;boom period&quot; in the Loire, with its cool maritime climate in most areas, for hybrid varieties. At late as 1979, Baco blanc along with other hybrid grapes such as Baco noir, Chambourcin, Plantet and Villard noir accounting for more than 10% of all grape plantings.

But since the mid to late 20th century, the grape variety has fallen out of favor among French wine producers who are continuing pulling up their hybrid grapes and returning to &quot;vinifera&quot;-only plantings (which are permitted for &quot;Appellation d&#x27;Origine Contrôlée&quot; AOC wines). Even in its Armagnac stronghold, Baco blanc vines are being uprooted and replanted with Ugni blanc. Similarly, Baco blanc experienced a brief period of popularity in the emerging New Zealand wine industry during the 20th century but as that century drew to a close, New Zealand producers also turned away from the variety to concentrate on &quot;vinifera&quot; grapes such as Müller-Thurgau, Chardonnay and Sauvignon blanc. Today, what little Baco blanc is left in New Zealand is used primarily for distillations and spirits.

==Viticulture and wine styles==

While Baco blanc does not share Folle blanche&#x27;s sensitivities to grey and black grape rots, it can be susceptible to powdery mildew. This susceptibility is enhanced due to the tendency of Baco blanc vines to bud early and ripen late, putting them at risk to rain and moisture of both early spring and early harvest time. However, while its growing season cycle doesn&#x27;t bode well for wine production, its tendency to produce high acid, neutral flavor grapes with low sugars does work well for distillation.

According to Master of Wine Jancis Robinson, grape-based spirits made from Baco blanc often are not as fine and complex as those made from Folle blanche or Ugni blanc. But they do have a tendency to age quickly, which creates a market for brandies meant for near-term consumption.

==Synonym==
Baco blanc and its wines are known under a variety of synonyms including 22 A Baco, Baco 22 A, Baco 22-A, Baco 221, Maurice Baco, and Piquepoul de Pays.

<text>Harmony, also known as Node 2, is the &quot;utility hub&quot; of the International Space Station. It connects the laboratory modules of the United States, Europe and Japan, as well as providing electrical power and electronic data. Sleeping cabins for four of the crew are housed here.

&quot;Harmony&quot; was successfully launched into space aboard Space Shuttle flight STS-120 on 23 October 2007. After temporarily being attached to the port side of the &quot;Unity&quot; module, it was moved to its permanent location on the forward end of the &quot;Destiny&quot; module on 14 November 2007. &quot;Harmony&quot; added to the station&#x27;s living volume, an increase of almost 20%, from to . Its successful installation meant that from NASA&#x27;s perspective, the station was considered to be &quot;U.S. Core Complete&quot;.

== Origin of name ==
The unit formerly known as &quot;Node 2&quot; was renamed &quot;Harmony&quot; in March 2004. The name was chosen in a competition where more than 2,200 students from 32 states participated. The &quot;Node 2 Challenge&quot; required students to learn about the space station, build a scale model, and write an essay explaining their proposed name for the module, which will serve as a central hub for science labs. The six winning classes were: Paul Cummins&#x27; 8th grade class at Browne Academy, Alexandria, Va.; Mrs.Sue Wilson&#x27;s 3rd grade class at Buchanan Elementary School, Baton Rouge, La.; Brigette Berry&#x27;s 8th grade class at League City Intermediate School, League City, Texas; Bradley Neu&#x27;s 9th grade science class at Lubbock High School, Lubbock, Texas; Russell Yocum &#x27;s 3rd grade class at West Navarre Intermediate School, Navarre, Fla.; and, David Dexheimer&#x27;s students at the World Group Home School, Monona, Wisconsin.

== Specifications ==

&quot;Harmony&quot; is the second of three node modules on the United States Orbital Segment (USOS). It is composed of a cylindrical, thick 2219-T851 aluminium alloy pressure shell with two endcones and is thermally insulated by a goldised Kapton blanket. It is protected from micrometeoroids by 98 panels, each made from a composite sandwich of stainless steel and 6061-T6 aluminium alloy, and a secondary barrier of Kevlar/resin. The design is based on the existing Multi-Purpose Logistics Module, as well as the European Space Agency&#x27;s &quot;Columbus&quot; module (both of which have only one passive Common Berthing Mechanism [CBM]). There are six CBMs on &quot;Harmony&quot;: the aft CBM that connects it to &quot;Destiny&quot; is passive; the rest are active.

&quot;Harmony&quot; is managed by NASA&#x27;s Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama. Its deployment expanded the Space Station, allowing it to grow from the size of a three-bedroom house, to the space equivalent of a typical five-bedroom house, once the Japanese &quot;Kibō&quot; and European &quot;Columbus&quot; laboratories are attached. The Space Station robotic arm, Canadarm2, is able to operate from a powered grapple fixture on the exterior of &quot;Harmony&quot;. &quot;Harmony&quot; is equipped with eight International Standard Payload Racks: four avionics racks and four for stowage or crew quarters. The first two were delivered on STS-126 and the second two on STS-128. After the cancellation of the Habitation Module, &quot;Harmony&quot; was chosen to house the American Crew Quarters.

== Construction agreement ==
In an agreement between NASA and the European Space Agency, the company Thales Alenia Space, built &quot;Harmony&quot; at its facility in Turin, Italy. &quot;Harmony&quot; arrived on 1 June 2003 at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida after its flight in an Airbus Beluga oversize cargo vehicle. Following post transportation inspection, the Italian Space Agency (ASI) formally handed over &quot;Harmony&quot; to the European Space Agency (ESA). From there, ESA formally transferred ownership of &quot;Harmony&quot; to NASA on 18 June 2003, taking place in the Space Station Processing Facility (SSPF) of the Kennedy Space Center. The handover of &quot;Harmony&quot; completed a major element of the barter agreement, between ESA and NASA, that was signed in Turin, Italy on 8 October 1997.

Paolo Nespoli, an ESA astronaut born in Milan, Italy, accompanied the &quot;Harmony&quot; module aboard STS-120 as a mission specialist.

== Launch ==

&quot;Harmony&quot; was launched on 23 October 2007 aboard of the STS-120, as the primary component of assembly mission ISS-10A.

On 26 October 2007, the station&#x27;s Space Station Remote Manipulator System (SSRMS) removed &quot;Harmony&quot; from the shuttle cargo bay and temporarily mated it to the port side of &quot;Unity&quot; and, on 27 October 2007, the crew entered in &quot;Harmony&quot;. After the Space Shuttle departed, &quot;Harmony&quot; was relocated to the forward dock of the &quot;Destiny&quot; laboratory. It required three EVAs by the station crew to complete the installation.

== Connecting modules and visiting vehicles ==
&quot;Harmony&quot; was the first permanent living space enlargement to the ISS after the &quot;Pirs&quot; docking compartment was added in 2001. The Expedition 16 crew moved the Pressurized Mating Adapter (PMA-2) on 12 November 2007 from &quot;Destiny&quot; to the forward berth of &quot;Harmony&quot;. The combined PMA-2/&quot;Harmony&quot; unit was subsequently berthed to its final destination at the forward end of &quot;Destiny&quot; on 14 November 2007. All the following Space Shuttle missions would dock at this location.

On 11 February 2008, ESA&#x27;s &quot;Columbus&quot; laboratory was attached to the starboard hatch of the &quot;Harmony&quot; module during space shuttle mission STS-122. On 14 March 2008, the Experiment Logistics Module Pressurized Section (ELM-PS) of Kibō was attached to its interim location: the zenith hatch of &quot;Harmony&quot;. During STS-124, a Space Shuttle mission flown by Space Shuttle &quot;Discovery&quot;, the Pressurized Module of Kibō was added to the port side of &quot;Harmony&quot; and the ELM-PS was moved, leaving the zenith hatch empty. The zenith hatch was originally intended to be the permanent docking connector for the now canceled Centrifuge Accommodations Module (CAM).

When the Space Shuttle flew the Multi-Purpose Logistics Modules (MPLMs) to the station, the MPLM would be temporarily berthed to the nadir mechanism of &quot;Harmony&quot;. The Japanese H-II Transfer Vehicle and the American Commercial Resupply Service (COTS) vehicles, Dragon and Cygnus, are temporarily berthed to either the nadir or zenith mechanism.

In August 2016, the forward docking port was equipped with the International Docking Adapter (IDA) delivered with the CRS-9 mission. This adapter was used for the first time for the automatic docking of the Crew Dragon spacecraft during its uncrewed test mission on 3 March 2019.

On 26 March 2017, PMA-3 was robotically removed from the &quot;Tranquility&quot; module and attached to the zenith port of the &quot;Harmony&quot; module after being prepared during a successful spacewalk on 24 March 2017. A second spacewalk was conducted on 30 March 2017 to finalize the PMA-3 cable connections on &quot;Harmony&quot;. PMA-3 is linked to the International Docking Adapter-3 adapter, delivered on the SpaceX CRS-18 mission in July 2019. IDA-3 was fully linked to PMA-3 during an EVA on 21 August 2019.

<doc id="926400" wikidata="Q1049086" url="?curid=926400" title="Incunabula (album)">
<text>Incunabula is the debut studio album by English electronic music duo Autechre, released by UK label Warp on 29 November 1993, and again by Wax Trax! on 25 January 1994 in the United States.

&quot;Incunabula&quot; became a surprise success, reaching the top of the UK Indie Chart. In 2012, UK magazine &quot;Fact&quot; named it the 11th best album of the 1990s. It was re-released on vinyl by Warp on 11 November 2016.

==Production==
Autechre member Rob Brown stated that &quot;Incunabula&quot; was &quot;more of a compilation of old material&quot; and that he believed follow-up album &quot;Amber&quot; was the &quot;first album we put out on Warp.&quot;

Music critics David Stubbs and Ned Raggett noted that &quot;Incunabula&quot; would differ from Autechre&#x27;s later releases. Raggett found that the album &quot;doesn&#x27;t totally display the full experimentation which would dominate their future albums and singles&quot; while Stubbs stated that following both &quot;Incunabula&quot; and &quot;Amber&quot;, Autechre &quot;took an increasingly remote turn, moving away from both the blissful pastures of the chillout zone and the wildfire, staplegun rhythms characteristic of the &#x27;Intelligent Dance Music&#x27; brigade.&quot;

Raggett continued that the first track &quot;Kalpol Introl&quot; &quot;sets the overall mood for the rest of the record&quot; with the track&#x27;s combination of minimal beats and bass with various keyboard textures and understated melodies. He concluded that &quot;Incunabula&quot; &quot;follows the same general tone; tracks often experiment with ghostly keyboard backing and mostly clinical beats combined with odd, individual touches.&quot;

==Release==
&quot;Incunabula&quot; was released by Warp on 29 November 1993. It was released again by Wax Trax! on 25 January 1994 in the United States. &quot;Incunabula&quot; was re-released on vinyl by Warp on 11 November 2016.

==Reception==
In a contemporaneous review, the &quot;St. Louis Post-Dispatch&quot; stated that the repetition of most techno would be repellent to audiences but that this was not the case with the genre&#x27;s &quot;ambient strain&quot;, lumping Autechre with groups like The Orb and Ultramarine and artists such as Aphex Twin. The review found little relevance in citing individual tracks as highlights as they ebbed and flowed into each other, but stated that &quot;the music is never boring and does inspire fits of introspection.&quot;

From retrospective reviews, David Stubbs of &quot;The Wire&quot; discussed both &quot;Incunabula&quot; and &quot;Amber&quot; stating the two were &quot;terrific adventures in homebrewed Techno but not radically dissimilar in method from the work of their Warp contemporaries.&quot; Raggett (AllMusic) stated that &quot;despite the relative sameness in the basic arrangements of tracks covering the better portion of the album -- a few song subtractions wouldn&#x27;t have hurt the 75-minute length any -- &quot;Incunabula&quot; still stands out as a better effort than many other U.K. techno albums of the early &#x27;90s.&quot; &quot;The New Rolling Stone Album Guide&quot; gave the both &quot;Incunabula&quot; and &quot;Amber&quot; two and half stars out of five, describing them as &quot;smart if unexciting ambient watercolors&quot; that &quot;give no indication of the innovations to follow&quot;. &quot;Pitchfork&quot; gave a positive review of the album, praising tracks such as &quot;Bike&quot; and &quot;Basscadet&quot;, described as a &quot;fan-favorite hit of sorts&quot;, while criticizing the album&#x27;s &quot;unwarranted&quot; length.

&quot;Fact&quot; would place the album at 11th place on their list of best albums of the 1990s, stating that it was a &quot;symphony of whirrs, cranks and rattling spokes; its formal ingenuity and sheer, brute intensity have sealed its status as a set text for the ages.&quot;

<text>Abbey Road is a thoroughfare in the borough of Camden and the City of Westminster in Greater London running roughly northwest to southeast through St John&#x27;s Wood near Lord&#x27;s Cricket Ground. It is part of the road B507. The road is best known for the Abbey Road Studios and for featuring on the cover of the Beatles&#x27; album of the same name, which was released in September 1969.

==Location==
The northwestern end of Abbey Road begins in Kilburn at the junction with Quex Road and West End Lane. The road was once a track leading to Kilburn Priory and its associated Abbey Farm and was developed in the beginning of the nineteenth century. It continues southeast for roughly one mile crossing Priory Road, Belsize Road, Boundary Road (which forms the Camden/Westminster boundary) and Marlborough Place, ending at the junction of Grove End Road and Garden Road. It is joined from the west by Abercorn Place.

==History==
The Abbey National Building Society (now Santander UK) was founded in 1874 as &quot;The Abbey Road &amp; St John&#x27;s Wood Permanent Benefit Building Society&quot; in one Baptist Church on Abbey Road.
EMI&#x27;s Abbey Road Studios is located at the southeastern end at 3 Abbey Road, St John&#x27;s Wood. Rigo Tovar, The Beatles, Kanye West, Glenn Miller, Queen, Radiohead, Lady Gaga, Shirley Bassey, Aretha Franklin, ABBA, Cliff Richard, Kate Bush, Brockhampton, Kylie Minogue, Pink Floyd, and many other famous popular music performers have recorded at this studio. The Beatles named their last studio LP after this street, and the album&#x27;s cover photograph shows the four group members walking across the zebra crossing just outside the studio entrance.

As a result of its association with the Beatles, this part of Abbey Road has been featured on the London tourism circuit. The crossing was given the official status of Grade II Listed Building by English Heritage in December 2010. The zebra crossing featured on the Beatles cover has become a popular photo opportunity area, despite the road still being a busy thoroughfare for traffic.

The crossing may have been relocated several metres as part of traffic management work in the 1970s, with a spokesperson for Westminster City Council saying in 2010 that &quot;by comparing photographs with the Ordnance Survey maps, we believe that the crossing might have been further north nearer 3 Abbey Road, which was the front house of the EMI Studios, because the steps of Neville Court appear to the right of the crossing in original photographs of the crossing, whereas the present crossing is near the junction of Abbey Road and Grove End Road&quot;.

The Beatles&#x27; album cover has been parodied many times over the years. The street sign on the corner of Grove End Road and Abbey Road, which was frequently defaced or stolen, is now mounted high on the building on the corner to save the local council the expense of cleaning and replacing it. The council repaints the wall next to the zebra crossing every three months to cover fans&#x27; graffiti.

Abbey Road is also an electoral ward in the City of Westminster. At the 2011 census, it had a population of 11,250.

<text>A larnax (plural: larnakes; , plural: λάρνακες, &quot;lárnakes&quot;) is a type of small closed coffin, box or &quot;ash-chest&quot; often used in the Minoan civilization and in Ancient Greece as a container for human remains—either a corpse (bent back on itself) or cremated ashes.

The first larnakes appeared in the Minoan period of the Aegean civilization, when they took the form of ceramic coffers designed to imitate wooden chests, perhaps on the pattern of Egyptian linen chests. They were richly decorated with abstract patterns, octopuses and scenes of hunting and cult rituals.

During the later Hellenistic period, larnakes, in the form of small terracotta sarcophagi, became popular, some of which were painted in similar styles to contemporary Greek vases.

In a few special cases, larnakes appear to have been made out of precious materials, as in the 4th century BC example found at Vergina in Macedonia, of gold, with a sun motif (hence known as the &quot;Vergina Sun&quot; motif) on the lid. Manolis Andronikos, the leader of the archaeological excavation, posited that the larnax most likely contained the remains of King Philip II of Macedon, father of Alexander the Great.

<text>Gus is a masculine name, often a diminutive for, Angus, August, Augustine, Gustave, Constantine, Konstantinos, Augusten, Gustavo, Gusten, or Augustus, and other names (e.g. Aengus, Argus, Fergus, Ghassan, Gustav, Gustafson, Ferguson, and Gussie).

It can also be used as the adaptation into English of the popular Greek name (of Latin origin) Kostas or Konstantinos (Constantin), especially amongst Greek immigrants in English-speaking countries, probably due to similarity in the sound. For Italian-Americans, Gus is short for Gaspare.

<text>Mzilikazi Moselekatse, Khumalo ( 1790 – 9 September 1868) was a Southern African king who founded the Ndebele Kingdom now called Matebeleland which is now part of Zimbabwe. His name means &quot;the great river of blood&quot;. He was born the son of Mashobane kaMangethe near Mkuze, Zululand (now known as KwaZulu-Natal in South Africa), and died at Ingama, Matabeleland (near Bulawayo, Zimbabwe). Many consider him to be the greatest Southern African military leader after the Zulu king, Shaka. In his autobiography, David Livingstone referred to Mzilikazi as the second most impressive leader he encountered on the African continent.

== Leaving Zululand ==

Mzilikazi was originally a lieutenant of Shaka. He left Zululand during the period largely known as mfecane with a large kraal of Shaka&#x27;s cattle. Shaka had originally been satisfied that Mzilikazi had served the Zulu nation well and he rewarded Mzilikazi with cattle and soldiers. But after some time King Shaka of the Zulu Kingdom, assassinated the twins of Mzilikazi&#x27;s sister— Ntombizodwa Ka Mashobana, who was later was known as Mafakašane. This led to a greater division between Mzilikazi and Shaka. It is unclear if Mzilikazi stole Shaka&#x27;s cattle or if he raided them from neighbouring tribes. He first travelled to Mozambique but in 1826 he moved west into the Transvaal due to continued attacks by his enemies. He absorbed many members of other tribes as he conquered the Transvaal. He attacked the Ndzundza kraal at Esikhunjini, where the Ndzundza king Magodongo and others were kidnapped and subsequently killed at the Mkobola river.

For the next ten years, Mzilikazi dominated the Transvaal. Mzilikazi eliminated all opposition and reorganised the captured territory to suit the new Matabele order. In 1831, after winning a battle against the Griqua people, Mzilikazi occupied the Griqua lands near the Ghaapse mountains. He used scorched earth methods to maintain a safe distance from all surrounding kingdoms. The death toll has never been satisfactorily determined, but it is believed that the region was so depopulated that the Voortrekkers were able to occupy and take ownership of the Highveld area without opposition in the 1830s.

==Fighting with the Boers==
Voortrekkers began to arrive in the Transvaal where Mzilikazi was king for 10 years. Voortrekkers discover that there was gold in Johannesburg area in 1836. This resulted in several confrontations of which Mzilikazi won several, until at length the Voortrekkers over powered Mzilikazi. The battle took two years during which the Matabele suffered heavy losses. By early 1838, Mzilikazi and his people were forced northwards and out of Transvaal altogether, across the Limpopo River. He decided to split his group in two. One of these groups moved north under military leader by Nkulumane, Mzilikazi&#x27;s first born son, and Gundwane Ndiweni, who conducted a section of the Ndebele across the Limpopo without Mzilikazi.

Further attacks caused Mzilikazi to move again, at first westwards into present-day Botswana and then later northwards towards what is now Zambia. He was unable to settle the land there because of the prevalence of tsetse fly which carried diseases fatal to oxen. Mzilikazi therefore travelled again, this time southeastwards into what became known as Matabeleland (situated in the southwest of present-day Zimbabwe) and settled there in 1840 where he reunited with the splinter group led by Ndiweni and Nkulumane Mzilikazi.

After his arrival, he organised his followers into a militaristic system with regimental kraals, similar to those of Shaka; under his leadership, the Matabele became strong enough to repel the Boer attacks of 1847–1851 and persuade the government of the South African Republic to sign a peace treaty with Mzilikazi in 1852.

==Matabele Kingdom==
While Mzilikazi was generally friendly to European travellers, he remained mindful of the danger that they posed to his kingdom. In later years he refused some visitors access to his realm. The Europeans who met Mzilikazi included Henry Hartley, hunter and explorer; Robert Moffat, missionary; John Mackenzie, missionary; David Hume, explorer and trader; Andrew Smith, medical doctor, ethnologist and zoologist; William Cornwallis Harris, hunter; and the missionary explorer David Livingstone.

After he was defeated by the Voortrekker Boers in Transvaal during the tribe&#x27;s wanderings north of the Limpopo, Mzilikazi became separated from the bulk of the tribe. They gave him up for dead and hailed his young heir Nkulumane as his successor. However, Mzilikazi reappeared after a traumatic journey through the Zambezi Valley and reasserted control. According to one account, his son and all the chiefs who had chosen him were put to death on his orders. A popular belief is that they were executed by being thrown down a steep cliff on the hill now called Ntabazinduna [&quot;hill of the chiefs&quot;].

Another account claims that Nkulumane was not killed with the chiefs, but was sent back to the Zulu Kingdom with a sizeable delegation which included warriors. During his journey south, he passed through the Bakwena territory in the northwestern Transvaal, near Rustenburg. At the time the Bakwena were struggling to repel repeated attacks from a neighbouring king, who laid claim to the territory that they occupied. Nkulumane assisted the Bakwena by leading his impi in a battle in which Nkulumane himself killed the neighbouring chief.

Following this victory, the Bakwena convinced Nkulumane to settle in their territory, arguing that it would be futile to return to the Zulu Kingdom as his father&#x27;s enemies would probably kill him. Nkulumane settled and lived with his family in that area until his death in 1883. His grave, covered in a concrete slab, is on the outskirts of Rustenburg in Phokeng. The site of Nkulumane&#x27;s grave is incongruously referred to as Mzilikazi&#x27;s Kop, even though it is his son who is buried there.

After resuming his role as king, Mzilikazi founded his nation at Ntabazinduna mountain and his first capital was at Inyathi where he ended up meeting his old friend Robert Moffat whom he had met in the Transvaal Republic when he was coming from Kuruman which was the year when his son (Nkulumane) was born, Inyathi was abandoned in 1859 when one of his senior wives, Queen Loziba, died. His next capital was established at Mhlahlandlela in Matopo District where he is buried. This became his second and last capital until he died at eNqameni near Gwanda on September 5, 1868.

In 1970, the City of Bulawayo established Mzilikazi Memorial Library which is the central library of all the city libraries. The King&#x27;s bust was placed at the entrance of the library in celebration of his centenary.

<doc id="926429" wikidata="Q835594" url="?curid=926429" title="Quest Joint Airlock">
<text>The &quot;Quest&quot; Joint Airlock is the primary airlock for the International Space Station. &quot;Quest&quot; was designed to host spacewalks with both Extravehicular Mobility Unit (EMU) spacesuits and Orlan space suits. The airlock was launched on STS-104 on July 14, 2001.

It was attached to the starboard CBM of the &quot;Unity&quot; during STS-104. The four external HP tanks were installed in pairs on two occasions.

Before &quot;Quest&quot; was attached, Russian spacewalks using Orlan suits could only be done from the &quot;Zvezda&quot; service module, and American spacewalks using EMUs were only possible when a Space Shuttle was docked, allowing the astronauts to use the Shuttle&#x27;s airlock, located in its payload bay. The arrival of &quot;Pirs&quot; docking compartment on September 16, 2001, provided another airlock from which Orlan spacewalks can be conducted.

== Requirements ==

&quot;Quest&quot; was necessary because American suits (EMUs) will not fit through a Russian airlock hatch and have different components, fittings, and connections. The airlock is designed to contain equipment that can work with both types of spacesuits, however, it is currently only able to host American spacewalks because the equipment necessary to work with Russian space suits has not been launched yet, which required the Expedition 9 crew to take a circuitous route to a worksite because of problems with the American space suits.

It is sized to allow EVAs with two crew.

== Early use ==
EMU EVAs were conducted from the ISS Joint Airlock in July 2001, February 2002, April 2002, and June 2002.

== Design ==

The &quot;Quest&quot; Airlock consists of two segments, the &quot;Equipment lock&quot; that stores spacesuits and equipment, and the &quot;Crew Lock&quot; from which astronauts can exit into space. It was derived from the Space Shuttle airlock, although it was significantly modified to waste less atmospheric gas when used. It has mountings for four high-pressure gas tanks, two containing oxygen and two containing nitrogen, which provides for atmospheric replenishment to the American side of the space station, most specifically for the gas lost after a hatch opening during a space walk.

=== Equipment lock segment ===
The larger equipment lock has storage space for EMU suits and equipment to check and maintain the EMUs.

There is a Battery Charging Assembly, a Battery Stowage Assembly, a Fluid Pumping Unit (FPU) (to refill the EMU water tanks after each EVA), and much else.

=== Crew lock segment ===

The hatch to space (EV hatch) has an inward opening airtight hard hatch, and an outwardly hinged thermal cover. The inner airtight hatch gets stowed at the end of the crew lock to allow ingress and egress.

In the crew lock is the Umbilical Interface Assembly, able to support two US suits, or two Orlan-M suits, or one of each.

== Camp-out procedure ==
&quot;Quest&quot; provides an environment where astronauts can &quot;camp out&quot; before a spacewalk in a reduced-nitrogen atmosphere to purge nitrogen from their bloodstream and avoid decompression sickness in the low-pressure () pure-oxygen atmosphere of the spacesuit. In April 2006, Expedition 12 Commander Bill McArthur and Expedition 13 flight engineer Jeffrey Williams tested this new method of preparing for spacewalks by spending the night in the &quot;Quest&quot; Airlock. In the chamber, the pressure was reduced from the normal . Four hours into the Expedition 13 crew&#x27;s sleep period, an error tone prompted mission controllers to cut short the activity, but the test was still deemed a success. American spacewalk activities thereafter have employed the &quot;camp-out&quot; pre-breathing technique.
The previous method of preparing for spacewalks involved breathing pure oxygen for several hours prior to an EVA to purge the body of nitrogen.

More recently astronauts have been using the In-Suit Light Exercise protocol rather than camp-out to prevent decompression sickness.

== High-pressure gas tanks ==
Two oxygen and two nitrogen high-pressure gas tanks are attached externally to the equipment lock segment. These tanks (known as the High Pressure Gas Assembly.) provide a replenishable source of gas to the atmosphere control and supply system and oxygen for recharging the space suits (EMUs).

Recharging the high-pressure tanks was accomplished by the Space Shuttle fleet until its retirement. When an orbiter was docked to the station&#x27;s Pressurized Mating Adapters (PMA-2 or PMA-3), oxygen was routed through pressure lines from the PMAs to the &quot;Quest&quot; Airlock. The pumping of the oxygen from the docked spacecraft tanks into &quot;Quest&quot;″s high-pressure tank was accomplished by the Oxygen Recharge Compressor Assembly (ORCA).

After the retirement of the Space Shuttle fleet, the Nitrogen Oxygen Recharge System (NORS) and spacecraft from the Commercial Crew Development program will take over this task.

== Construction ==
This module was manufactured by Boeing, under contract by NASA, at the Marshall Space Flight Center in 2000. It is made from aluminum and steel alloys.

The design for the crew airlock segment was derived from that of the Space Shuttle&#x27;s external airlock.

== Airlock specifications ==
*Material: aluminium and steel
*Length: 
*Diameter: 
*Mass: 
*Volume: 
*Cost: $164 million, including tanks

<doc id="926432" wikidata="Q176595" url="?curid=926432" title="Amber (Autechre album)">
<text>Amber is the second studio album by English electronic music duo Autechre, released on 7 November 1994 by Warp. It was the first Autechre album to be composed entirely of new material, as their debut album &quot;Incunabula&quot; was a compilation of older tracks.

== Production and style ==
Unlike &quot;Incunabula&quot;, which was part of Warp&#x27;s &quot;Artificial Intelligence&quot; series of albums and predominantly a compilation of older material, &quot;Amber&quot; was described by Autechre member Rob Brown as &quot;genuinely the first album we put out on Warp&quot;. Designed by Ian Anderson of The Designers Republic, the cover art is a detail of a panoramic photograph of sandstone cliffs in Cappadocia, Turkey, taken by landscape photographer Nick Meers.

&quot;Select&quot; described the album as a &quot;&#x27;90s update of electro&#x27;s cut-&#x27;n&#x27;-paste rhythmics into the realms of the odd,&quot; and stated that &quot;Amber&quot; &quot;made music by μ-Ziq or Aphex Twin seem almost conventional.&quot; &quot;CMJ&quot; described the sound of &quot;Amber&quot; as &quot;entirely electronic and entirely instrumental&quot; outside a few vocal samples. 
In a 2013 retrospective feature, &quot;Fact&quot; described &quot;Amber&quot; as containing &quot;some of Autechre&#x27;s most ambient moments,&quot; and compared several songs (&quot;Nine&quot; and &quot;Yulquen&quot;) to the works of Brian Eno, saying that their &quot;beatless, but powerful low-end means that they’re contemplative rather than ethereal&quot;. &quot;Fact&quot; also described songs such as &quot;Montreal&quot; and &quot;Piezo&quot; as uniquely-styled pieces with &quot;deep veins of techno and acid house&quot;.

==Release==
&quot;Amber&quot; was first released by Warp on 7 November 1994 on compact disc, double vinyl and cassette. The album was released in the United States on 24 January 1995 by Wax Trax! and TVT Records.

The album has subsequently been reissued in all major formats, including digital download. Warp notably reissued Autechre&#x27;s first three albums—&quot;Incunabula&quot;, &quot;Amber&quot; and &quot;Tri Repetae&quot;—on vinyl on 11 November 2016.

==Critical reception==

&quot;Select&quot;″s Gareth Grundy rated the album four out of five, describing Autechre as &quot;out on the fringes, having a good rummage for the weird and beautiful,&quot; and stating that the album was not &quot;goalless experimentation. There&#x27;s plenty of melody on board, it&#x27;s just that it creeps up on you from behind.&quot; &quot;CMJ&quot; writer Heidi MacDonald noted that Autechre&#x27;s more rhythmic music, such as &quot;Glitch&quot; and &quot;Piezo,&quot; is &quot;almost hypnotically listenable&quot; but that slower tracks were &quot;dangerously close to new age&quot;. Ned Raggett of AllMusic gave the album a four-and-a-half star rating out of five, and compared the album to &quot;Incunabula&quot;, opining that &quot;a couple of tracks could be removed with no problem, while tracks like &quot;Montreal&quot; and &quot;Slip&quot; continue the basic &quot;Incunabula&quot; formula without noticeable change.&quot; Raggett concluded that &quot;things are clearly starting to gel a little more here than on previous releases; the great leap forward becomes all the more logical in retrospect.&quot;

In 2008, Rob Brown described listening to &quot;Incunabula&quot; and &quot;Amber&quot; again, and commented on &quot;how cheesy they were, and how contrasted our newer ideas are.&quot; Brown clarified his statement in 2013, explaining that the comment &quot;was easily misinterpreted&quot; and that he simply intended to say that the earlier albums &quot;were perhaps more simple [than their more recent work], but not in a shit way.&quot;

In &quot;The New Rolling Stone Album Guide&quot;, critic Ben Sisario gave both &quot;Incunabula&quot; and &quot;Amber&quot; two and half stars out of five, describing them as &quot;smart if unexciting ambient watercolors&quot; that &quot;give no indication of the innovations to follow&quot;. Writing about &quot;Amber&quot; upon the occasion of the 2016 vinyl reissue, &quot;Pitchfork&quot;″s Andy Beta stated that the melodies of &quot;Slip&quot; had not aged well, and that parts of &quot;Glitch&quot; and &quot;Piezo&quot; were &quot;dulled and gentle in hindsight, knowing just what nasty and brutish sounds [Autechre] would soon wring out of their gear.&quot; He concluded that &quot;What makes &quot;Amber&quot; fascinating to revisit decades on is to hear vestigial organs and sonic cul-de-sacs that Autechre would bin almost immediately after. ... prov[ing] that at one point the duo was human after all.&quot; In 2017, &quot;Pitchfork&quot; ranked &quot;Amber&quot; at number 16 on its list of &quot;The 50 Best IDM Albums of All Time&quot;.

<text>Misfits of Science is an American science fiction comedy-drama television series created by James D. Parriott that aired on NBC from October 4, 1985, to February 21, 1986.

== Plot==
The series featured super-powered humans and their madcap adventures. The team is formed by Dr. Billy Hayes, a research scientist at the &quot;Humanidyne Institute&quot; who specializes in &quot;human anomalies&quot;. He works with shrinking Dr. Elvin &quot;El&quot; Lincoln, and together they recruit electrically powered Johnny Bukowski, a rock-and-roll musician, and Gloria Dinallo, a telekinetic teenager.

== Production ==
A double-length TV pilot and 15 additional episodes were produced; however, one episode did not air before the show was cancelled due to low ratings.

The name &quot;Misfits of Science&quot; and other conceptual ideas were the brainchild of then-president of NBC Entertainment, Brandon Tartikoff. He explained of the series &quot;We&#x27;ll rely on the &quot;National Enquirer&quot; for story ideas. It&#x27;s loosely inspired by the dynamics we saw in &quot;Ghostbusters&quot;... sort of a kick-back, Friday type of show.&quot;

The ninth episode was the first paid writing job for Tim Kring, who later originated and produced the thematically similar &quot;Heroes&quot; in 2006.

=== Title sequence ===
The main title sequence and its theme song were unusual for TV shows of the era. Donald Todd, head writer and story editor, described them as follows:

== Cast and characters ==
* Dean Paul Martin as Dr. Billy Hayes, the leader of the team (who has no superpowers). He is a young research scientist at the Humanidyne Institute who specializes in &quot;human anomalies&quot; and a fast-talking but good-hearted schemer full of boyish enthusiasm who often gets the team into as much trouble as he gets them out of. Although easily distracted whenever an attractive woman walks by, he is honestly interested in getting involved in a serious relationship with Jane Miller even after she showed up pregnant by another man.
* Kevin Peter Hall as Dr. Elvin &quot;El&quot; Lincoln, Billy&#x27;s colleague and close friend. He has the ability to shrink for minutes at a time from his height of to via hormonal treatments which he activates by pressing a nerve on the back of his neck. A recurring joke after such transformations is that he always has to put on the tiny change of clothes he carries with him for his small size. The character is shy and struggles socially, and despite being so tall, he is a very bad basketball player.
* Mark Thomas Miller as Johnny &quot;Johnny B&quot; Bukowski, a rock and roll musician who was electrically shocked on stage which resulted in disturbing electrical powers. He continually drains any electrically charged items in his surroundings, forcing him to live in isolation. He wears sunglasses because his eyes glow when he is fully charged. He can throw lightning bolts forcefully and run at superhuman speed, easily outracing in one episode a parody of the &quot;Six Million Dollar Man&quot;, but he is vulnerable to water which short-circuits him and burns his skin. He is a big Chuck Berry fan.
* Courteney Cox as Gloria Dinallo, a troubled telekinetic teenager with a history of juvenile delinquency and a mother in a mental institution who claims Gloria&#x27;s father is from outer space. She has a crush on Johnny. Gloria can only use her telekinesis on things that she can see: using a blindfold on her renders her powerless.
* Diane Civita as Miss Nance, the scientists&#x27; secretary. Although she usually seems more interested in doing her nails, going on her coffee break, and watching her soap operas, she is actually the one who keeps their department running and is always there at the end of the series to turn off the lights and say goodnight to the rabbits in their cages.
* Jennifer Holmes as Jane Miller, Gloria&#x27;s probation officer. Although attracted to Billy, she is often put off by his eccentric behavior. Her character appears only in the earlier episodes, disappearing after the first 7 episodes. (Although Holmes is still in the opening credits through episode 12.)
* Max Wright as Dick Stetmeyer, the uptight director of the Humanidyne Institute. Unlike the other cast members, he isn&#x27;t actually considered to be one of the Misfits.
* Mickey Jones as Arnold &quot;Beef&quot;/&quot;Ice Man&quot; Beifneiter, who got his power to freeze anything he touches from placing himself in an experimental cryogenic cold storage unit back in the year of 1937 due to grief caused by the loss of his beloved Amelia Earhart. The team drives around in an ice cream truck (International Metro Mite M-800) because the lumbering and now rather simple-minded Ice Man dies if he gets too warm, so they keep him in the freezer. Beef only appears in the pilot episode due to legal objections from Marvel Comics, who publish a similarly named character in &quot;X-Men&quot;, but the characters continue to use the ice cream truck.

== Episodes ==
==International broadcast==
In France, the series was known as &quot;Superminds&quot;, in Germany, as &quot;Die Spezialisten unterwegs&quot; (&quot;The Specialists On The Way&quot;), in Brazil, as &quot;Curto-Circuito&quot; (&quot;Short Circuit&quot;), in Mexico, Colombia, Peru and rest of Latin America as &quot;Los Cientificos Rebeldes&quot; (&quot;The Rebel Scientists&quot;).

==DVD releases==
On January 25, 2008, the series was released in Germany as a 5-disc DVD box set (Region 2) with all episodes (including the final episode, which was originally unaired on NBC but broadcast in Germany) with both English and German audios and German subtitles. The release was entitled “Die Spezialisten Unterwegs”, translates literally to “The Specialists On The Go”.

On September 19, 2012, the series was released on DVD in France as &quot;Superminds&quot;.

<text>The Haliacmon (, &quot;Aliákmonas&quot;; formerly: , &quot;Aliákmon&quot; or &quot;Haliákmōn&quot;) is the longest river flowing entirely in Greece, with a total length of . In Greece there are three rivers longer than Haliakmon: Maritsa (), Struma (Strymónas), both coming from Bulgaria, and Vardar () coming from North Macedonia, but the length of each one of them in Greek territory is less than that of Haliakmon, which flows entirely in Greece. &quot;Haliacmon&quot; is the traditional English name for the river, but many sources cite the formerly official Katharevousa version of the name, &quot;Aliákmon&quot;. Today, the only official variant is the demotic &quot;Aliákmonas&quot;. It flows through the Greek regions of West Macedonia (Kastoria, Grevena and Kozani regional units) and Central Macedonia (Imathia and Pieria regional units). Its drainage basin is .

==Name==
The Latin name &#x27; is derived from Ancient Greek &#x27;, a composite derived from (salt, sea) and (anvil). In Greek mythology Haliakmon was one of the river gods, who were sons of Oceanus and Tethys, according to the allegorical obsessive-anthropomorphic concept familiar to the Ancient Greeks, on geological upheaval after Deucalion&#x27;s deluge.

An ancient tradition says that sheep that drank water from Haliakmon would turn their colour to white. This tradition is confirmed by the following record of the Roman author Pliny the Elder (23-79 AD) : &quot;Similarly in Macedonia, those who want their sheep to be white go to Haliakmon, while those (who want them to be) black (go) to Axios (Vardar)&quot;.

Ottoman Turks called the river Ince-Karasu (narrow-black water), a name still used in Turkey. The Eastern South Slavic name is Бистрица, &quot;Bistritsa&quot; (Бистрица, from Proto-Slavic *-bystr, meaning &quot;clear, lucid, limpid&quot;) which is still in use in Bulgaria and North Macedonia.

==Course and tributaries==
Before the construction of its diversion dam near the village of Aghia Varvara in the mid-1950s, Haliakmon had no permanent river bed in its lowland course. It often flooded and formed extensive marshes. Its devastating fury in December 1935 remains fresh in memory of the elder inhabitants of the region (Veria and Alexandreia).

The Haliacmon rises in the Gramos mountains in northern Greece, near the border with Albania. In its upper course it flows generally towards the east, and turns southeast near Kastoria. It describes a wide curve around the Vourinos mountains, and turns northeast near the village Paliouria. It feeds the large artificial lake Polyfyto, that was created after the construction of the namesake hydroelectric dam and consists almost its entire course through the Kozani prefecture. Over the bridge runs the Lake Polyfytos Bridge, part of the Athens-Kozani national road. Southeast of Veria, the Haliacmon enters the central Macedonian plains, an area of great importance to agriculture. It flows into the Thermaic Gulf west of the delta of the Axios (&quot;Vardar&quot;), northeast of the coastal town Methoni.

Haliakmon&#x27;s tributaries include Gramos, Ladopotamos, Pramoritsa, Grevenitikos, Venetikos, Tripotamos and Krasopoulis.

The Haliacmon flows along the towns (in downstream order) Nestorio, Argos Orestiko, Neapoli, Paliouria, Velventos and Alexandreia.

==Wetland==
Haliakmon contains 33 kinds of fish. These include brown trout, gilt-head bream, sardine, carp, pike, eel, european anchovy, nursehound, bogue, garfish, red porgy, saddled seabream, angler, bream, mediterranean sand smelt, sand steenbras, mullus barbatus, freshwater bass, tuna, salmon, Mediterranean moray, weever, longfin gurnard, dogfish, dusky grouper, school shark and turbot. About 30 of them are indigenous, while the rest were introduced by human intervention. Many of them are considered scarce and one, &quot;mavrotsironi&quot;, lives nowhere else in the world, i.e. it is endemic. Μost of these kinds of fish have no commercial value but only biological, since they support the food web. Fish found in Haliakmon, like carp and rainbow trout, indicate that its water is still pure. Some eels are found in its estuaries, that cannot migrate, hindered by the dams.

For amateur fishermen the river has been enriched with introduced rainbow trout, that is not easy to reproduce, so there is no danger of disturbance of the river&#x27;s ecosystem.

In the place where the river flows into the sea, there has been formed over the years an extended Delta of 4.000 hectares, because of the large dam that was constructed and retains much of the brought matters. As a result, silting has been greatly reduced and during the summer, when there is not much water, the sea enters and largely overwhelms the river bed. Flathead mullets and European seabasses are found in Haliakmon&#x27;s Delta. In the shallow marine areas formed there, the fry of many Aegean Sea&#x27;s fish finds a place to reproduce, while about 90% of Greece&#x27;s mussels are produced in the Haliakmon-Axios (Vardar) Delta. Aliki Kitrous is an area of 254 hectares, where 15–20.000 tons of salt are produced per year.

Many kinds of birds have been observed in Haliakmon&#x27;s region. They use it for accommodation and overwintering, like the ducks, or to rest on their long migratory journey. There have been observed 215 kinds of birds and about ⅓ of them nest in the region. Over 10% of the birds are endangered. They include Dalmatian pelican and curlew, that are considered to be among the rarest birds in the world. 27 kinds of rare and protected kinds of birds nest in the region, like purple heron.

==History==

In antiquity, Claudius Ptolemy called the chain of mountains in which the river rises (northern Pindus) the &quot;Canalovii&quot;. According to Julius Caesar, the Haliacmon formed the line of demarcation between Macedon and Thessaly. In the upper part of its course it took a southeast direction through Elimiotis, which it watered; and then, continuing to the northeast, formed the boundary between Pieria, Eordaea, and Imathia. In the time of Herodotus the Haliacmon was apparently joined by the Loudias 7, 127, the discharge of the lake of Pella; but a change has taken place in the course of the Loudias, which no longer joins the Haliacmon, but flows directly into the Aegean Sea. The image below shows a wind gap between the Haliacmon and Loudias watersheds that is the probable ancient course of the Haliacmon.

It was the domain of the eponymous river god Haliacmon.

<doc id="926449" wikidata="Q355247" url="?curid=926449" title="Strathspey (dance)">
<text>A strathspey () is a type of dance tune in time, featuring dotted rhythms (both long-short and short-long &quot;Scotch snaps&quot;), which in traditional playing are generally somewhat exaggerated rhythmically. Examples of strathspeys are the songs &quot;The Bonnie Banks o&#x27; Loch Lomond&quot; and &quot;Coming Through the Rye&quot; (which is based on an older tune called &quot;The Miller&#x27;s Daughter&quot;).

Strathspeys may be played anywhere from 108 beats per minute for Highland dance up to 160 beats per minute for step dance. Traditionally, a strathspey will be followed by a reel, which is in with even eighth-notes, as a release of the rhythmic tension created during the strathspey.

It has been hypothesized that strathspeys mimic the rhythms of Scottish Gaelic song. Among traditional musicians, strathspeys are occasionally transmitted as canntaireachd, a style of singing in which various syllables are used to vocalize traditional bagpipe embellishments.

The dance is named after the Strathspey region of Scotland, in Moray and Badenoch and Strathspey. Strathspey refers both to the type of tune and to the type of dance usually done to it (although strathspeys are also frequently danced to pastoral airs played at the same tempo; an example of which would be the dance Autumn in Appin, danced to the tune &quot;The Hills of Lorne&quot;). The strathspey is one of the dance types in Scottish country dancing. According to William Lamb on the Bagpipe News website, the first mention of the word &quot;Strathspey&quot; in connection with a specific type of dance is the anonymous Menzies manuscript dated to 1749. A Scottish country dance will typically consist of equal numbers of strathspeys, jigs and reels. The strathspey step is a slower and more stately version of the skip-change step used for jigs and reels. The strathspey also forms part of the musical format for competing pipe bands. Modern high grade pipe bands are required to play a march, a strathspey and a reel for competition purposes.

Many strathspeys were written in the 18th and 19th centuries by composers such as William Marshall, James Scott Skinner, and Magdalene Stirling, who utilised the full range of the fiddle to produce many memorable tunes. Skinner distinguished between dance tunes, which retained the staccato bowing (Laird o Drumblair), and airs which were for listening (Music of Spey). Angus Cumming produced the first collection of strathspeys to be published by a person from Strathspey. More recently, Muriel Johnstone has written some elegant piano strathspeys. These days there are at least four, some would say seven, varieties: the bouncy schottische, the strong strathspey, the song or air strathspey, all three of which can be enjoyed for dancing, and the competition strathspey for the Great Highland bagpipe, primarily intended as a display of virtuosity. Although band and solo competition bagpiping generally involves a complicated, heavily ornamented setting, traditional pipers often play simpler, more rhythmically driven versions.

In the Irish tradition, strathspeys are largely relegated to the Scottish-influenced traditions of Donegal, where they are commonly called highlands. Unlike many duple-time tune types in the Irish tradition, Highlands are articulated with four distinct beats to the bar, rather than two. Unlike their Scottish counterparts, highlands are played with a smoother, less-jagged articulation, and the dotted rhythms tend to devolve into long passages of triplets.

In the New World, the Cape Breton strathspey differs from its Scottish cousins in that the &quot;snaps&quot; can come at any point in the measure; they have been described as more &quot;wild&quot; than in Scottish playing. Cape Breton dot-snaps often follow the same pattern within any given piece of music, and adhere to a local pattern shared among the community of Cape Breton-style players.

== Printed collections ==

Among printed collections of Strathspeys, Keith MacDonald&#x27;s &quot;The Skye Collection of the Best Reels and Strathspeys&quot; (1887) has over 400 tunes. It is mentioned on the website &quot;The Session&quot; under the article for &quot;Clark&#x27;s Strathspey&quot;. Peter Wyper recorded a version of &quot;Lord Lynedoch&quot; on cyclinder in the period 1901 - 1907. (see &quot;The Session&quot; article referenced above). It is not easy to determine the most frequently recorded strathspey but &quot;Monymusk&quot; has been recorded 24 times. (see &quot;The Session&quot; again). The &quot;tunearch&quot; website has 21 transcriptions of &quot;Money Musk&quot;, originally dated to 1789.

<doc id="926453" wikidata="Q1049413" url="?curid=926453" title="Tri Repetae">
<text>Tri Repetae (stylised as tri repetae.) is the third studio album by English electronic music duo Autechre, released on 6 November 1995 by Warp in the United Kingdom. In contrast to the duo&#x27;s previous albums, &quot;Incunabula&quot; (1993) and &quot;Amber&quot; (1994), &quot;Tri Repetae&quot; features a distinct style that incorporates more minimal rhythms and spacious melodies.

==Background==
In contrast to previous albums by Autechre, &quot;Incunabula&quot; (1993) and &quot;Amber&quot; (1994), &quot;Tri Repetae&quot; features a distinct style that incorporates more minimal, repetitive rhythmic patterns and intricate, spacious arrays of melodies; the aesthetical shift was intentionally echoed by its album cover designed by the duo&#x27;s visual collaborators The Designers Republic, consisting of only a single shade of beige. Stemming from Autechre&#x27;s increasing preoccupation with unique electronic musical textures and glitches, the liner notes of the album mention a preference to listen to the album on vinyl for surface noise; the CD version states that the album is &quot;incomplete without surface noise&quot;, whereas the vinyl version satisfactorily states that it is &quot;complete with surface noise&quot;.

==Release==
In preparation for the 1997 release of the duo&#x27;s fourth studio album &quot;Chiastic Slide&quot;, &quot;Tri Repetae&quot; was rereleased on 16 March 1996 by Wax Trax! Records and TVT Records in the United States as a two-disc set named &quot;Tri Repetae++&quot;, which included the &quot;Garbage&quot; and &quot;Anvil Vapre&quot; EPs constituting the second CD. In Japan, it was released with the bonus track &quot;Medrey&quot;. On 11 November 2016, &quot;Tri Repetae&quot; was re-released on vinyl by Warp, along with their two previous albums, &quot;Incunabula&quot; and &quot;Amber&quot;.

==Critical reception==

&quot;Tri Repetae&quot; received critical acclaim upon release. In 2017, &quot;Pitchfork&quot; ranked it at number three on its list of &quot;The 50 Best IDM Albums of All Time&quot;.

<doc id="926455" wikidata="Q858306" url="?curid=926455" title="Shandong Peninsula">
<text>The Shandong (Shantung) Peninsula or Jiaodong (Chiaotung) Peninsula is a peninsula in Shandong in eastern China, between the Bohai Sea to the north and the Yellow Sea to the south. The latter name refers to the east and Jiaozhou.

==Geography==
The waters bordering the peninsula are Laizhou Bay to the northwest, which opens into the Bohai Sea to the north, which in turn passes through the Bohai Strait to the northeast into the Yellow Sea to the east and south. The peninsula&#x27;s territory comprises three prefecture-level cities of Shandong: Qingdao in the southwest, Yantai in the north and centre, and Weihai at the eastern tip.

Shandong Peninsula is the largest peninsula in China. Stretching into the Bohai Sea and the Yellow Sea, it is 290 kilometers long from east to west, 190 kilometers wide from north to south, and 50 kilometers narrow. The total area of Shandong Peninsula is 73,000 square kilometers.

Geologically it was once connected to the Korean Peninsula and the Liaodong Peninsula, but was split starting around 27 Ma ago, resulting in the formation of the Yellow Sea.

==History==
In the Paleolithic, the Shandong Peninsula area was covered by forest. In the Neolithic, about 7,000 years ago, a large number of Dongyi people inhabited the peninsula. The Dongyi had their own kingdom called the State of Lai. The peninsula later belonged to the State of Qi. The Qi built the Great Wall of Qi, which is partially on the peninsula. During the Han dynasty, the peninsula belonged to the semi-independent feudatory Jiaodong Kingdom.

The Kiautschou Bay Leased Territory was a leased territory of the German Empire from 1898 to 1914 located around Jiaozhou Bay, where the village of Qingdao (Tsingtao) developed into a major seaport. 
Japan seized the territory from Germany in 1914 in the First World War. In the 1919 Treaty of Versailles, Germany lost Qingdao and its sphere of influence in Shandong. Instead of restoring Chinese sovereignty over the area, the treaty transferred the leased territory to the Empire of Japan. This resulted in popular dissatisfaction in China with the outcome, known as the Shandong Problem, and led to the May Fourth Movement. Eventually, Shandong was reverted to Chinese control in 1922 after mediation by the United States during the Washington Naval Conference. However, Japan retained economic influence in the area.

Due to geographical reasons, the Shandong Peninsula is closely connected with Northeast China and South Korea. Historically, a large number of people migrated to the Northeast by boat, whereas in the present day many people from the Northeast &quot;return&quot; to the Shandong Peninsula. After the People&#x27;s Republic of China established diplomatic relations with South Korea in 1992, a large number of South Korean companies also set up factories in the region. There are more than 200,000 Koreans living in the Shandong Peninsula. South Korea has a consulate-general in Qingdao.

== Climate ==
Shandong Peninsula is surrounded by sea on three sides and has a monsoon climate with four distinct seasons (Köppen: &quot;Cwa/Dwa&quot;). Due to maritime influence, the climate is relatively mild, in both summer and winter.

== Major urban areas ==
==In popular culture==
The Shandong Peninsula is fictionalized as the &quot;Chinese Peninsula&quot; in the Japanese manga and anime series, &quot;Fire Force&quot;.

<text>Richard Adu-Bobie (born 12 January 1985) is a Canadian sprinter. He was an alternate for Canada&#x27;s 4 × 100 m relay team at the 2004 Summer Olympics. He was an alternate for the same team at the 2008 Summer Olympics.

Born in Manchester, New Hampshire to Ghanaian parents, Adu-Bobie moved to Canada at a young age and received his Canadian citizenship just two days prior to the Olympic trials. Adu-Bobie attended Sir Wilfrid Laurier Secondary School in Ottawa, Canada, where he first launched into his sprinting career.

Following the 2004 Olympics in Athens, Adu-Bobie went to the University of Florida where he placed third in the 60-yard dash at the NCAA Indoor Track and Field Championship. Unfortunately, that same spring, he injured his leg and had to miss most of the outdoor season. In 2006, Adu-Bobie transferred to Texas A&amp;M.

Adu-Bobie has become an experienced international sprinter, competing in the NCAA Midwest Regional Championships, the Canadian Championships, the Pan Am Games and the 2005, and 2007 World Championships. He is the former Canadian junior record holder in the 100 metres.

After graduating from Texas A&amp;M University in College Station, Texas, he returned to Ottawa, where he currently resides.

<text>Crest Whitestrips is a line of tooth whitening products made by Procter &amp; Gamble.

==Description==
Crest Whitestrips were introduced in 2001. The product is used by placing a disposable plastic strip directly onto the teeth that contains an enamel-safe whitening gel. It is reported to be most effective on yellow and heavily stained teeth.

In 2010, the &quot;3D&quot; range of Whitestrips was introduced. The new &quot;Advanced Seal&quot; was a technological advancement from the older Crest Whitestrips. The strips are now non-slip, and also whiten more teeth because each strip is longer. These are available with the strongest retail 3D Advanced Vivid and 3D Professional Effects Whitestrips.

U.S. dentists also offer a specialized Crest Whitestrips called &quot;Supreme&quot;, which is more effective than retail versions due to the higher concentration of hydrogen peroxide.

Possible side effects from Whitestrips usage include gum irritation and white spots on the teeth for a few hours after use. Sensitivity can also temporarily occur. Whitestrips can also have a bleaching effect if they come in contact with clothing or skin. Whitestrips are not for use by children under the age of 12, while Crest Whitestrips Supreme should not be used in persons under the age of 18. The active ingredient is hydrogen peroxide. 

According to a 2009 article in The Washington Post, Consumer Reports found Crest Whitestrips Supreme to be the best of the eight teeth whitening products it tested. This product was the most expensive kit tested by Consumer Reports.

===Ingredients===
Crest Whitestrips contain water, glycerin, hydrogen peroxide, carbomer 956, and sodium saccharin. Crest Whitestrips Professional Effects (Hong Kong Version) contains water, glycerin, carbomer 956, sodium hydroxide, and sodium saccharin.

== Usage ==
Crest 3D White Whitestrips only whiten natural teeth. The strips do not whiten caps, crowns, veneers, fillings or dentures. They are not to be used with dental braces, loose teeth or temporary or loose restorations. Crest recommends that if customers are in need of dental work, have had dental work or have staining from medication, they ask a dentist if tooth whitening is appropriate.

==Summary of products==
==Strengths available==
* Crest Whitestrips Supreme has 100 mg of gel with 14% hydrogen peroxide (14 mg) of hydrogen peroxide per upper strip.
* Crest Whitestrips Professional has 200 mg of gel with 6.5% hydrogen peroxide per upper strip.
* Crest Whitestrips Professional Effects (Hong Kong Version) has 200 mg of gel with (14 mg) of sodium hydroxide as active ingredient.

<doc id="926474" wikidata="Q264934" url="?curid=926474" title="Seventy-four (ship)">
<text>The &quot;seventy-four&quot; was a type of two-decked sailing ship of the line, which nominally carried 74 guns. It was developed by the French navy in the 1740s, replacing earlier classes of 60- and 62-gun ships, as a larger complement to the recently developed 64-gun ships. Impressed with the performance of several captured French seventy-fours, the British Royal Navy quickly adopted similar designs, classing them as third rates. The type then spread to the Spanish, Dutch, Danish and Russian navies.

The design was considered a good balance between firepower and sailing qualities. Hundreds of seventy-fours were constructed, becoming the dominant form of ship-of-the-line. They remained the of most major fleets into the early 19th century. From the 1820s, they began to be replaced by larger two-decked ships mounting more guns. However, some seventy-fours remained in service until the late 19th century, when they were finally supplanted by ironclads.

Standardising on a common ship size was an appealing ideal for naval administrators and bureaucrats. Although the seventy-four was a common type, the ship classes were not identical, even within the same navy. In the period 1750–1790, seventy-fours could measure from just under 2,000 to 3,000 tons burthen. The armament could also vary considerably, with the lower deck mounting 24-pounder to 36-pounder long guns, and a variety of calibres (sometimes including a few carronades) used on the upper deck. Some seventy-fours of the Danish navy only carried 70 guns.

== First 74-gun designs ==
The first 74-gun ships were constructed by the French as they rebuilt their navy during the early years of the reign of Louis XV. The new ship type was a very large two-decker big enough to carry the largest common type of gun (36-pounders) on the lower gun deck, something only three-deckers had done earlier. This great firepower was combined with very good sailing qualities compared to both the taller three-deckers and the shorter old-style 70-gun two-deckers, making the 74 the perfect combination of the two. A disadvantage of the 74 was that it was relatively expensive to build and man compared to the older type of two-decker.
The 74-gun ship carried 28 (24-pounders – to 36-pounders) on the lower gun deck, 28–30 (18 – to 24-pounders) on the upper gun deck, and 14–18 (6 – to 12-pounders) on the upper works. Crew size was around 500 to 750 men depending on design, circumstances and nationality, with British ships tending to have smaller crews than other navies. The French had large and small seventy-fours, called &quot;grand modèle&quot; and &quot;petit modèle&quot;, the waterline length of a &quot;grand modèle&quot; seventy-four could be up to 182 feet. This was copied by the Royal Navy in about two dozen such ships of its own, such as where they were known as Large, while the other seventy-fours built to be between were known as Common.

The significance of the 74s however is hard to overstate, as shown by a summary of the ships of the line for all nations that were in commission at any time during the Revolutionary/Napoleonic Wars period.

*1st &amp; 2nd rates (90-130 guns) 156
*3rd rate 74s (70–90 guns) 408
*4th rate (60–68 guns) 199

=== The 80-gun ship ===
Lengthening the hull by one gun port, allowing one additional gun per side on the lower and upper gun deck and on the quarterdeck produced the 80-gun ship. Given the construction techniques of the day, the seventy-four approached the limits of what was possible. Such long hulls made from wood had a tendency to flex and sag over time. Increased maintenance could counter this to some extent, but this was of course costly. This limited the success of the even bigger two-deck 80-gun ships that were built in small numbers after the seventy-four had been introduced. Three-deckers did not have the same problem due to their additional deck giving more rigidity.

== 74s in the Royal Navy ==
The Royal Navy captured a number of the early French 74-gun ships during the War of the Austrian Succession (for example, , captured at the first battle of Cape Finisterre in 1747) and the Seven Years&#x27; War and was greatly impressed by them compared to its own smallish 70-gun ships. As a result, it started building them in great numbers from about 1760, as did most other navies. Navies that were restricted by shallow waters, such as the Dutch and Scandinavian navies, at least early on tended to avoid the 74-gun ship to a certain degree due to its size and draught, preferring smaller two-deckers instead. Even so, the seventy-four was a standard feature in all European navies around 1800. Only a handful of 74-gun ships were commissioned into the United States Navy; the US Navy&#x27;s early sea power concentrated on its frigates.

The type fell into disuse after the Napoleonic Wars, when improved building techniques made it possible to build even bigger two-deckers of 84 or even 90 guns without sacrificing hull rigidity.

The last seventy-four, the French Trafalgar veteran &quot;Duguay-Trouin&quot;, was scuttled in 1949. Her stern ornamentation is on display at the National Maritime Museum, Greenwich. In addition, dozens of ship models exist, produced as part of constructing the real ships, and thus believed accurate both externally and internally.

<text>Burnt Oak is a suburb of London, England, located northwest of Charing Cross. It lies to the west of the M1 motorway between Edgware and Colindale, located predominantly in the London Borough of Barnet, with parts in the London Boroughs of Brent and Harrow. It was part of Middlesex until it was transferred to Greater London in 1965.

== History ==

The earliest recorded use of the name Burnt Oak was in 1754, when it was used to refer to a field on the eastern side of Edgware Road (Watling Street) in the Ancient Parish of Hendon. The name originates from the fact that the field had contained an ancient oak tree some time before the 1750s, having been burned by a lightning strike. The tree stood at the boundary of the Little Stanmore parish with the Kingsbury parish.

Parts of modern-day Burnt Oak lie on what was once a 33-acre field known as Sheves Hill Common Field. However, outside of Sheves Hill, most areas of farmland had been owned by the Goldbeaters Farm since the 14th century. The Goldbeaters estate may have originated in a grant of land and rent by John le Bret to William of Aldenham, goldbeater of London, in 1308. John Goldbeater held a house and some land of the manor of Hendon in 1321. This land had been cultivated for hay and became enclosed by the late 1500s. A known custom from the area from the early 19th century had been established by hay farmers, who would assemble at the Bald Faced Stag pub and lead a procession to London. By the 1840s, two other notable farms existed in the area, known as Burntoak Farm and Redhill Farm, both also producing hay alongside being used as livery stables.

In the 19th century, Sheves Hill field was rented out in divisions of land to 46 tenants, and later became the site of the Hendon Union Workhouse, commonly known as Redhill Workhouse, in 1838. The institution housed around 130 inmates in 1863, and was governed by Rev. Theodore Williams, Vicar of Hendon, who developed a reputation for cruelty toward inmates. The infirmary of the workhouse is now the site of Edgware Community Hospital.

In May 1844, Burnt Oak field was sold to a Mr Essex. A union school for 150 children was built next to the workhouse in 1859. A farmhouse and cow farm existed to the south, which were still maintained into the early 1920s. In 1853, three residential streets: North Road, East Road, and South Road were built on the site of Burnt Oak field by the Middlesex Freehold Land Society. The application of the field name to the district followed from this new estate by the initiative of the land society, as the name Redhill had become associated with the ill-famed workhouse. The new name, Burnt Oak, was in use by the 1880s and first appeared on maps in 1895. However, the area continued to be referred to as Red Hill until the opening of Burnt Oak tube station, with a Redhill Drive still existing in the area. Similarly, an area known as Orange Hill existed closer to the outskirts of Mill Hill, giving its name to Orange Hill Road. This area took its name from Orange Hill House, which in turn was possibly named to celebrate the accession of William of Orange in 1689. The building which now stands at the site, once the site of St Rose&#x27;s Convent, was built in 1881 for a Mr Ruddock.

The area was largely rural, having few buildings except for pubs such as the Bald Faced Stag, Royal Oak, Prince of Wales, and Load of Hay, which catered to travellers. However, there were a handful of shops by the 1890s; a post office and grocery run by George and William Plumb, a bakery run by Caller &amp; Poole, as well as James Huggett the greengrocer. A new school had been opened in 1884, later being replaced by a larger school housing up to 300 students in 1901. The Metropolitan Electric Tramway along Edgware Road to Cricklewood opened in 1905, but the population remained small, being around in 1921.

Burnt Oak would begin to become urbanised after Burnt Oak station on London Underground&#x27;s Northern line opened on 27 October 1924. Plans to open the tube station had existed since 1913, but were postponed due to the First World War; initially proposed names differed, including Sheves Hill, Orange Hill, and Goldbeaters. The station was first open on weekdays with a small booking hall suitable for a rural area. The Underground Electric Railways Company of London constructed a new road, Watling Avenue, known as Mill Hill Avenue until 1927. This was to link to Edgware Road, and originally for transporting soil and materials for the construction of the tube station. At 100 Watling Avenue, the first remotely controlled electrical substation in the country was constructed, which was able to power the railway line while being controlled remotely from Golders Green.

Also in 1924, it was announced that the London County Council was to build a housing estate (Watling Estate), which was ready for its first occupants in April 1927. The estate offered three main styles of houses, made of brick, wood, and steel, as well as newly constructed flats. Other housing estates were opened on former farmland, such as the Canada Park Estate and Highlands Estate. In 1927, Redhill Hospital was also opened near the Union Workhouse. With this and other new amenities the area was provided with a new station by 1928, and the population by 1931 had grown to . A shop parade was built along Watling Avenue in 1930, as well as a number of new schools to serve the area, such as Woodcroft and Goldbeaters.

Most of the residents who migrated to Burnt Oak when the area became urbanised in the 1920s came from the overcrowded working-class districts of Islington and St Pancras. This led to discontent among some long-time residents, who accused the working class of pick-pocketing and possible Communist sentiments, giving the area the nickname &quot;Little Moscow&quot;. This led to some shop owners denying service to those who lived on the estates. However, the Watling Centre, established in 1933, provided facilities and entertainment to the local population. On 29 June 1936, the Regent Cinema was opened on Burnt Oak Broadway, later becoming known as the Odeon Cinema and Savoy Cinema. From 1961, the building housed Mecca Bingo, London&#x27;s first bingo club. The club closed in 2014, with the building becoming derelict and, as of 2021, set to be transformed into apartments.

Similarly to neighbouring Hendon and Grahame Park, Burnt Oak&#x27;s history was associated with early aviation. The area was once the site of the Stag Lane Aerodrome, where pioneering pilot Amy Johnson had learned to fly. In July 1921, aviation pioneer Harry Hawker died after crashing in a park in Burnt Oak. Stag Lane was also the site of the de Havilland aircraft works, which employed a significant number of residents in the area. London&#x27;s RAF Museum is located nearby in Grahame Park, on the site of the former Hendon Airfield.

In September 1931 Jack Cohen opened the first Tesco store at 54 Watling Avenue, Burnt Oak. The store was later moved to a larger plot at 9 Watling Avenue, with a second store opening on Burnt Oak Broadway in 1976. The Watling Avenue store closed in the 1990s, while the Burnt Oak Broadway store closed in 2018 and was set to be redeveloped into apartments.

In 1930, Dominican nuns established St Rose&#x27;s Convent at Orange Hill House, which led to the foundation of St James&#x27; Catholic High School in 1934. On 31 October 1936, the Co-op opened its department store at the junction of Stag Lane and Burnt Oak Broadway. The Watling Market, consisting of a hundred covered shops and stalls, opened in December 1960 but ceased trading around 2014. In 2018, a stairwell previously used to access the marketplace was closed to the public, along with another on the opposite side which led to the derelict electrical substation.

On 9 February 1948, an Avro Anson C Mk 19 TX168 crashed when attempting to land at RAF Hendon with only one engine, as part of a crew training exercise. The aircraft crashed into buildings in Burnt Oak and a passing trolleybus. Wing Commander (33013) Theodore Urquhart Rolfe, RAF (aged 34), who was the pilot, and Flight Lieutenant (55123) William Johnstone McMeekan, RAF (aged 28) were killed in the incident. Eight passengers using the trolleybus were severely injured.

On 10 December 2014, a large fire destroyed the roof of the Lansdowne pub in Burnt Oak. The building was demolished in 2016 and is now the site of a car dealership.

In 2017, 500 people were evacuated from the area due to the eruption of a large fire behind shops in Watling Avenue.

=== Watling Estate ===

The Watling Estate is one of 12 London County Council cottage estates built between the wars to provide Homes fit for Heroes.
== Geography ==
Burnt Oak lies about 160 (50 m) to 200 feet (60 m) above sea level. Prior to urbanisation, much of the area had been rolling grassland.

The Silk Stream, Burnt Oak Brook, and Deans Brook flow through Burnt Oak, all tributaries of the River Brent.

There are several parks in the area: Watling Park, Silkstream Park, Lyndhurst Park, Woodcroft Park, and The Meads Open Space.

Burnt Oak lies northwest of Charing Cross in central London.

== Demography and culture ==
In 2021, the Burnt Oak ward in Barnet had a population of 21,857. The census showed that 43% (9,401) of the population were White, 25.7% (5,616) were Asian, 16.5% (3,611) were Black, 2.8% (608) were Arab, 6.1% (1,326) were of mixed race/multiple backgrounds, and 5.9% (1,294) belonged to other ethnic groups. In terms of religion, 50.7% (10,285) were Christian, 21.2% (4,308) were Muslim, 7.2% (1,466) were Hindu, 2.2% (429) Buddhist, 1.3% (256) Jewish, 53 were Sikh, 1% (197) belonged to other religions, and 16.2% were irreligious.

The ward covers an area of approximately 0.983 square miles (2.55 km2), giving a population density of 22,237/sq mi (8,584/km2), the fourth highest in the borough behind the wards of Golders Green, Colindale South, and the highest being Colindale North, respectively.

The area is known for its variety of multicultural shops, reflecting the established Indian, Turkish and Nigerian communities. In the 2010s, the area attracted a large community of Eastern Europeans, particularly from Romania. The large size of the Romanian diaspora and its concentration in the area has earned Burnt Oak the nickname &quot;Little Romania&quot;, or &quot;Little Bucharest&quot;. Earlier, in the 1930s, the area was known by some as &quot;Little Moscow&quot; due to rising fears of revolutionary sentiments among working-class people who arrived to settle the Watling Estate.

== Transport ==
London Buses routes 32, 142, 204, 251, 292, 302 all meet at the junction of Watling Avenue, Stag Lane and Burnt Oak Broadway. The old route 52 was split into a shorter 52 (between Willesden Junction and Victoria bus station) and new route 302 (from Mill Hill Broadway to Kensal Rise via Burnt Oak) in 1992. Night bus route N5 runs between Trafalgar Square and Edgware bus station serving all the tube stations, and the N16 runs north from Victoria Station via the Edgware Road, to Edgware Station, via Burnt Oak.

Northern line trains on the Edgware Branch serve Burnt Oak tube station.

<doc id="926485" wikidata="Q1710970" url="?curid=926485" title="LP5">
<text>The untitled fifth studio album by English electronic music duo Autechre, commonly known as LP5, was released on 13 July 1998 on Warp. No title was printed anywhere within the artwork, so it became known as &quot;LP5&quot; in line with the later EP &quot;EP7&quot;; it has also been called &quot;Autechre&quot;, as well as &quot;Album&quot;, as listed on promotional copies.

With the album, Autechre began abandoning the warm sounds of earlier albums like &quot;Amber&quot; in favor of a fine-tuned, technical style they had begun exploring on &quot;Chiastic Slide&quot; and the &quot;Cichlisuite&quot; EP, while also incorporating influences from electroacoustic music.

==Production==
The track &quot;Drane2&quot; is a response to Aphex Twin&#x27;s &quot;Bucephalus Bouncing Ball&quot;, which, according to Sean Booth, is an answer to Autechre&#x27;s earlier track &quot;Drane&quot;:&quot;yeah we did the track drane, which had that exponential speeding-up delay thing happening, and then rich did that bouncing ball track, and we answered it with drane2 which was the same delay trick but feeding percussion into it instead, as a kind of tease&quot;

Several technical facts about the album&#x27;s production are known from an AMA conducted in 2013 on the electronic music site &quot;We Are The Music Makers&quot;: synths used on the album include the Nord Lead 1, Yamaha DX100, and Ensoniq ASR-10; the first half of &quot;Vose In&quot; was made using the Nord Lead&#x27;s drum maps and its ending was programmed in SoundEdit 16; finally, the complex rhythms of &quot;Under BOAC&quot; were programmed in Logic Pro rather than in Max.

==Critical reception==

Greg Prato of AllMusic gave the album 4.5 out of 5 stars and said that &quot;all the songs are cut from the same sonic cloth&quot;. &quot;Pitchfork&quot; listed &quot;LP5&quot; at number eight on its 2017 list of &quot;The 50 Best IDM Albums of All Time&quot;, one of three Autechre albums to be included; reviewer Mark Richardson stated that the album effectively balances the accessibility of their earlier work with the more challenging material to come, and thus represents &quot;a certain peak.&quot;

==Track listing==
On US pressings, the hidden track is moved to its own 12th track, and the silence after &quot;Drane2&quot; is shortened by three minutes. The hidden track is not found on vinyl pressings. Additionally, some digital releases of the album rename &quot;Acroyear2&quot; to &quot;AcroyearII&quot;.

<text>You Bet Your Life is an American comedy quiz series that has aired on both radio and television. The original version was hosted by Groucho Marx of the Marx Brothers, with announcer and sidekick George Fenneman. The show debuted on ABC Radio on October 27, 1947, moved to CBS Radio debuting October 5, 1949, and went to NBC-TV and NBC Radio on October 4, 1950. Because of its simple format, it was possible to broadcast the show on both radio and television but not simultaneously. Many of the laughs on the television show were evoked by Groucho&#x27;s facial reactions and other visual gimmicks, so the two versions were slightly different. The last episode in a radio format aired on June 10, 1960. The series continued on television for another year, recording the last season, beginning on September 22, 1960, with a new title, The Groucho Show.

Gameplay on each episode of &quot;You Bet Your Life&quot; was generally secondary to Groucho&#x27;s comedic interplay with contestants and often with Fenneman. The show was so popular that it was the first primetime series to be shown in reruns during the summer months. The common practice at the time was to have a series go on hiatus during the summer, being replaced temporarily by a 13-week comedy or variety series before the main series returned in the fall. The &quot;You Bet Your Life&quot; summer reruns were broadcast as The Best of Groucho, to make clear to viewers that these were repeat broadcasts.

After the show went off the air, NBC prepared a syndicated version for local stations in 1961. Because the reruns were already established as &quot;The Best of Groucho&quot;, the syndicated version retained this title. NBC removed all references to the original sponsors by cropping the image whenever the sponsor&#x27;s logo appeared, along with using a bright light to blur the &quot;NBC&quot; mark on Groucho&#x27;s microphone. This is why some shots in the syndicated versions appear grainy and less focused. By deleting the sponsor&#x27;s logo, the image zoomed in on what remained on the screen, sometimes cropping out a contestant while the screen showed only Groucho.

&quot;You Bet Your Life&quot; has been revived three times since the original series ended, the most recent being a version hosted by Jay Leno that aired in first-run syndication from 2021 to 2023.

==History==
The mid-1940s were a lull in Groucho Marx&#x27;s career. His radio show &quot;Blue Ribbon Town&quot;, sponsored by Pabst Blue Ribbon beer, had begun in March 1943 and had failed to catch on. Groucho left the program in June 1944 and was replaced by vocalist Kenny Baker (who appeared with Groucho in 1939&#x27;s &quot;At the Circus&quot;). The show ended two months later. Groucho also reluctantly appeared in two films with brothers Chico and Harpo Marx, &quot;A Night in Casablanca&quot; and the lackluster &quot;Love Happy&quot;.
During a radio appearance with Bob Hope in March 1947, Marx ad-libbed most of his performance after being forced to stand by in a waiting room for 40 minutes before going live on the air. The audience found Marx&#x27;s ad libs very funny. John Guedel, the Hope program&#x27;s producer, formed an idea for a quiz show and approached Marx about the subject.

After initial reluctance on Marx&#x27;s part, Guedel was able to convince him to host the program once Marx realized the quiz would be only a backdrop for his contestant interviews and the storm of ad-libbing that they would elicit. Guedel also convinced Marx to invest in 50% of the show, in part by saying that he was &quot;untouchable&quot; at ad-libbing, but not at following a script.

As Marx and the contestants were ad-libbing, Guedel insisted that each show be filmed and edited before release to remove both the risqué and the less interesting material. The show for the studio audience ran longer than the broadcast version so some parts could be omitted.

On December 28, 1949, episode #49-13 was filmed as a visual test in preparation for the show to be broadcast on television. The president of Film Craft Productions, Regina Lindenbaum (who did the subsequent filming), cited it as the first television show filmed before a live audience. Most television histories incorrectly credit &quot;I Love Lucy&quot; with that achievement, but Lucy premiered a year after Groucho&#x27;s first filmed season. While filming both shows did indeed allow for greater control in post-production editing, the principal reason they were filmed was so that they could be produced in Hollywood before the advent of the &quot;coaxial cable&quot; that allowed live coast-to-coast broadcasts. They also produced clearer images for the West Coast than the fuzzy kinescope recordings that dominated network programming there in television&#x27;s early days.

==Gameplay==

Contestant teams usually consisted of one male and one female, most of whom were selected from the studio audience. Occasionally, famous or otherwise interesting figures were invited to play (e.g., a Korean-American contestant who was a veteran and had been a prisoner of war during the Korean War), or noteworthy sports figures like
Joe Louis, Kenny Washington, Rocky Marciano, Don Drysdale and Coach Red Sanders, among others.

Each episode began with the introduction &quot;And now, here he is: the one, the &quot;only&quot;...&quot; by Fenneman, who would pause, inviting the audience to finish the sentence by shouting in unison &quot;GROUCHO!&quot; The show&#x27;s band would then play a portion of the tune &quot;Hooray for Captain Spaulding&quot;, Marx&#x27;s signature song. Groucho next would be introduced to the first two contestants and engage in humorous conversations in which he would improvise his responses or employ prepared lines written by the show&#x27;s writers after conducting pre-show interviews. In this way, some of Groucho&#x27;s supposed ad-libs were actually written ahead of time. The total number of contestants in each episode varied depending on the length of Groucho&#x27;s conversations and the time taken for gameplay in each segment. Generally, the 30-minute format of the televised show provided time for two or three two-person teams to play in each episode.

Some show tension revolved around whether a contestant would say the &quot;secret word&quot;, a common word revealed to the audience at the outset of each episode. If one of the contestants said the word, a toy duck resembling Groucho—-with eyeglasses and a mustache—-descended from the ceiling to bring a $100 prize. It would then be divided equally between that segment&#x27;s two-person team. A cartoon of a duck with a cigar was also used in the opening title sequence. The duck was occasionally replaced with various other things, for example a wooden Indian figure, carrying the required $100 prize to the lucky team. In one episode, Groucho&#x27;s brother Harpo came down instead of the duck, and in another a female model attired in a tight bodice and very short skirt came down in a birdcage with the money. In his conversations with contestants, Marx would at times direct their exchanges in ways to increase the likelihood that someone would say the secret word.

In November 1955, Groucho announced on the air that he had noticed the success of big-money quiz programs (referring to, but not naming, &quot;The $64,000 Challenge&quot;) and declared that &quot;You Bet Your Life&quot; was itself going to raise its &quot;Secret Word&quot; bonus: from $100 to $101. This gimmick lasted until the end of the year.

===Formats===

====Main game====
After the contestants&#x27; introduction and interview, the actual game began. Couples were allowed to choose from a list of 20 available categories before the show; then they tried to answer a series of questions within that category. From 1947 to 1956, couples were asked four questions.

* 1947–1953 – Each couple began with $20, wagering part or all of their bankroll for each question.
* 1953–1954 – Each couple now began with $0, but selected values from $10 to $100 (going up in $10 increments). A correct answer added the value of the question to their bankroll, while an incorrect answer did nothing. According to co-director Robert Dwan in his book &quot;As Long As They&#x27;re Laughing&quot;, Guedel changed the scoring format because too many couples were betting, and losing, most or all of their money.
* 1954–1956 – The format was slightly altered to start each couple with $100. Incorrect answers now cut their bankroll to that point in half.
* 1956–1959 – Two couples (reduced from three) answered questions until they either gave two consecutive incorrect responses or answered four consecutive questions correctly for a prize of $1,000.
* 1959–1961 – For the last two seasons, couples picked four questions worth $100, $200, or $300 each, potentially winning up to $1,200. Winning at least $500 qualified the team to go for the jackpot question.

From 1947 to 1956, if a couple ended their quiz with $25 or less, Marx would ask a very easy question so they could receive consolation money of $25 (later $100), which did not count toward the scores. The question was often patently obvious so there was virtually no chance that departing contestants would answer it incorrectly. Some examples include the following: &quot;Who is buried in Grant&#x27;s Tomb?&quot;, &quot;When did the War of 1812 start?&quot;, &quot;How long do you cook a three-minute egg?&quot;, and &quot;What color is an orange?&quot; The question about Grant&#x27;s Tomb became such a staple of the show that both Marx and Fenneman were shocked when one man got the question &quot;wrong&quot; by answering &quot;No one&quot;. As the contestant then pointed out, Grant&#x27;s Tomb is an above-ground mausoleum. On another occasion, Marx and Fenneman were dumbfounded when a contestant answered &quot;Me&quot; when asked who was buried in Grant&#x27;s tomb.

====Jackpot question====
In all formats, one of the two players on the team could keep their half of the winnings while the other risked their half. In this case, all amounts being played for were divided in half.
*1947–1956 – The highest-scoring couple was given one final question for the jackpot, which began at $1,000 and increased by $500 each week until won. In the event of a tie, the tied couples wrote their answers on paper and all couples who answered correctly split the jackpot. 
*1956–1957 – For a brief period following the format change, couples who won the front game could wager half on another question worth $2,000.
*1957–1959 – Winning couples now faced a wheel with numbers from 1–10, selecting one number for $10,000. If the number selected was spun, a correct answer to the jackpot question augmented the team&#x27;s total winnings to that amount; otherwise, the question was worth a total of $2,000.
*1959–1961 – For the last two seasons, the format was slightly altered to eliminate the risk and add a second number for $5,000.

===Nielsen ratings===
Seasonal Nielsen ratings covered the period between October and April of the following year. The rating number represents the percentage of homes tuned into that program.

Nielsen also measured the radio version at tenth among radio shows in 1955.

Despite not being involved with the quiz show scandals, the show&#x27;s popularity waned and &quot;You Bet Your Life&quot; fell out of the top 25. NBC stopped making the show in 1961.

===Sponsorship===
The radio program was sponsored by Allen Gellman, president of Elgin American, maker of watch cases and compacts, during its first two and a half seasons. Later, seasons of the television show (as well as the radio show, after January 1950) were sponsored by Chrysler, with advertisements for DeSoto automobiles incorporated into the opening credits and the show itself. Each show would end with Marx sticking his head through a hole in the DeSoto logo and saying, &quot;Friends...go in to see your DeSoto-Plymouth dealer tomorrow. And when you do, tell &#x27;em Groucho sent you.&quot; Still later sponsors included the Toni Company (Prom home permanent, White Rain shampoo) with commercials featuring Harpo and Chico Marx, Lever Brothers (Lux liquid, Wisk detergent), Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Geritol), and Lorillard Tobacco Co. (Old Gold cigarettes).

In 1953 the show became embroiled in controversy when its musical director, Jerry Fielding, was called to appear before the House Committee on UnAmerican Activities and refused to testify, citing his Fifth Amendment privileges. The show&#x27;s sponsor, the DeSoto-Plymouth Dealers of America, demanded that Marx fire Fielding, and he complied. Fielding later accused the House committee of calling him up to testify because they wanted him to name Marx as a Communist sympathizer, and Marx himself later wrote, &quot;That I bowed to sponsors&#x27; demands is one of the greatest regrets of my life.&quot;

===Contestants===
The interviews were sometimes so memorable that the contestants became celebrities: &quot;nature boy&quot; health advocate Gypsy Boots; Mexican-American entertainer Pedro Gonzalez-Gonzalez; comedians Phyllis Diller and Ronnie Schell; author Ray Bradbury; virtuoso cellist Ennio Bolognini; blues singer and pianist Gladys Bentley; strongmen Jack LaLanne and Paul Anderson; and actor John Barbour all appeared as contestants while working on the fringes of the entertainment industry.

Harland Sanders, who talked about his &quot;finger-lickin&#x27;&quot; recipe for fried chicken that he parlayed into the Kentucky Fried Chicken chain of restaurants, once appeared as a contestant. A guest purporting to be a wealthy Arabian prince was really writer William Peter Blatty; Groucho saw through the disguise, stating, &quot;It was pretty obvious to me that you weren&#x27;t an Arabian prince; I used to have an Arabian horse and I know what they look like.&quot; Blatty won $10,000 and used the money, after quitting his job, to support himself while he focused on establishing a career as a writer. He would later go on to write &quot;The Exorcist&quot; in 1971. No one in the audience knew the identity of contestant Daws Butler until he began speaking in the voice of cartoon character Huckleberry Hound. He and his partner in the episode went on to win the top prize of $10,000. Cajun politician Dudley J. LeBlanc, a Louisiana state senator and medicine showman, demonstrated his winning style at giving campaign speeches in French, also confessing (in a rare moment of candor) the truth about his signature nostrum, Hadacol: when asked what Hadacol was good for, LeBlanc admitted &quot;about five million dollars for me last year.&quot; General Omar Bradley was teamed with an army private, and Marx goaded the private into telling Bradley everything that was wrong with the army. Professional wrestler Wild Red Berry admitted that the outcomes of matches were determined in advance, but that the injuries were real; he revealed a long list of injuries he had sustained.

Other celebrities, already famous, occasionally teamed up with their relatives to win money for themselves or for charities. On February 6, 1958, silent-film star Francis X. Bushman and his wife Iva Millicient Richardson appeared on the show and won $1,000 by successfully answering questions in a geography quiz. Arthur Godfrey&#x27;s mother Kathryn was a contestant on another episode and held her own with Marx. Edgar Bergen and his then 11-year-old daughter Candice also teamed up with Marx and his daughter Melinda to win $1,000 for the Girl Scouts of the USA, with Fenneman taking on the role of quizmaster for that segment.

Other celebrity guests included Jayne Mansfield, Edith Head, Mickey Walker, Francis X. Bushman, Howard Hill, General Clarence A. Shoop, Louise Beavers, Irwin Allen, Frankie Avalon, Lord Buckley, Sammy Cahn, Ray Corrigan, Sam Coslow, Don Drysdale, Kenny Washington, Hoot Gibson, physicist and host of &quot;Exploring&quot; Albert Hibbs, Tor Johnson, Ward Kimball, Ernie Kovacs, Laura La Plante, Liberace, Joe Louis, Bob Mathias, Irish McCalla, screenwriter and author Mary Eunice McCarthy, Harry Ruby, Max Shulman, Fay Spain, Colonel John Paul Stapp, National Champion Football Coach Red Sanders, John Charles Thomas, Pinky Tomlin, Rocky Marciano and his mother, Charles Goren, and Johnny Weissmuller. In 1961 Groucho&#x27;s brother Harpo appeared to promote his just-published autobiography, &quot;Harpo Speaks&quot;.

====Cigar incident====

The show&#x27;s most notorious remark supposedly occurred as Groucho was interviewing Charlotte Story, who had borne 20 children (the exact number varies in tellings of the urban legend). When Marx asked why she had chosen to raise such a large family, Mrs. Story is said to have replied, &quot;I love my husband&quot;; to which Marx responded, &quot;I love my cigar, but I take it out of my mouth once in awhile.&quot; The remark was judged too risqué to be aired, according to the anecdote, and was edited out before broadcast.

Marion and Charlotte Story were indeed parents of 20 children and had appeared as contestants on the radio version of the show in 1950. Audio recordings of the interview exist, and a reference to cigars is made (&quot;With each new kid, do you go around passing out cigars?&quot;), but there is no evidence of the infamous line. Marx and Fenneman both denied that the incident took place. &quot;I get credit all the time for things I never said,&quot; Marx told Roger Ebert, in 1972. &quot;You know that line in &quot;You Bet Your Life&quot;? The guy says he has seventeen kids and I say, &#x27;I smoke a cigar, but I take it out of my mouth occasionally&#x27;? I never said that.&quot; Marx&#x27;s 1976 memoir recounts the episode as fact, but co-writer Hector Arce relied mostly on sources other than Marx himself—who was by then in his late eighties and mentally compromised—and was probably unaware that Marx had specifically denied speaking the legendary line. Snopes surmised the line may have been conflated with another exchange with a girl who had 16 siblings; in that episode, Groucho asked the girl how her father felt about having 17 children. She replied &quot;my daddy loves children,&quot; and Groucho responded &quot;Well, I like pancakes, but I haven&#x27;t got a closet full of them!&quot;

===Legacy===
Seven months after &quot;You Bet Your Life&quot; ended its 11-season run at NBC, Marx hosted another game show in prime time, &quot;Tell It to Groucho&quot;. It aired on CBS during the winter months of 1961 and the spring months of 1962. The game involved each of three celebrity pictures being flashed on a screen, each for a quarter of a second. The couple won $500 for each picture they identified. If the couple could not identify any of the three pictures, they were shown one picture and won $100 for a correct guess. As in &quot;You Bet Your Life&quot;, the focus of the show was on Marx&#x27;s interviews with the contestants before they played the game. Replacing George Fenneman were two teenaged sidekicks, Jackson Wheeler and Patti Harmon. Both had appeared on &quot;You Bet Your Life&quot; as contestants during its final season (Harmon under her given name of Joy Harmon).

&quot;You Bet Your Life&quot; was parodied on a live April 1955 episode of &quot;The Jack Benny Program&quot;. Benny pretended to be someone else (&quot;Ronald Forsythe&quot;)&lt;ref name=&quot;coopertoons/youbetyourlife&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; to get on the quiz show (competing with a female contestant played by Irene Tedrow), and continues to divulge information during an effort to say the secret word. In the skit, Benny is unable to answer the final question, which Groucho asks with a knowing chuckle and ironically is about Benny himself, simply because it asks his real age; as part of his comic persona, Benny would never give his age voluntarily, even for something he valued as much as money. After the sketch Groucho asked him why he opted out of the 3,000-dollar prize. Benny then gave away his age, indirectly, by saying &quot;Where else could I buy 22 years for 3,000 dollars?&quot; After Marx&#x27;s death this film appeared in the &quot;Unknown Marx Brothers&quot; documentary on DVD. A brief clip of the episode appeared in the 2009 PBS special &quot;Make &#x27;Em Laugh: The Funny Business of America&quot;.

The title of the show was parodied in the 1989 Weird Al Yankovic film &quot;UHF&quot;, on the U62 Fall Schedule as &quot;You Bet Your Pink Slip&quot;.

A Bugs Bunny cartoon entitled &quot;Wideo Wabbit&quot; had a scene where Bugs Bunny impersonated Groucho to Elmer Fudd for the game show &quot;You Beat Your Wife&quot;, a takeoff on the name &quot;You Bet Your Life&quot;.

An episode of &quot;Animaniacs&quot; had a segment called &quot;You Risk Your Life&quot; where, if a contestant said the secret word, Wakko would hit that contestant on the head with a mallet. The contestants were Mrs. Myra Puntridge and Aristotle. The secret word was &quot;yes,&quot; and Aristotle said it three times.

An episode of &quot;In Living Color&quot; had a skit called &quot;You Bet Your Career&quot;. Jamie Foxx plays Bill Cosby, and it features washed-up celebrities competing for a walk-on role in sitcoms.

==Revivals==
===1980–1981: Buddy Hackett===

In 1980, Buddy Hackett hosted a new version produced by Hill-Eubanks Productions, and syndicated by MCA. Fenneman&#x27;s announcer/sidekick role was taken over by nightclub entertainer Ron Husmann.

The show would begin with Hackett performing a brief stand up routine followed by a brief chat with Husmann. Three individual contestants appeared on each episode, one at a time. The contestants were interviewed by Hackett and then played a true or false quiz of five questions in a particular category. The first correct answer to a question earned $25, and the amount doubled with each subsequent correct answer. After the fifth question, the contestant could opt to try to correctly answer a sixth question to triple their winnings; however, if the contestant was incorrect, their earnings were cut in half. Additionally, the secret word was still worth $100, and if anyone said it, each contestant on that episode won $100.

The contestant with the most money returned at the end of the show to meet &quot;Leonard&quot;, the prize duck (If there was a tie, they would be asked a question with a numeric answer, which they wrote down, and whoever was closest without going over won). The contestant then stopped a rotating device, causing a plastic egg to drop out which concealed the name of a bonus prize, one of which was a car.

Some episodes had celebrities, including George Fenneman, Phil Harris, and Greg Evigan appear as contestants; each played for a member of the studio audience.

===1988: Richard Dawson===
Richard Dawson hosted a pilot, which taped on August 3, 1988 for NBC. However, it was not picked up as a series.

Teams of two unrelated players came out one team at a time and were asked three questions, either $100, $150 or $200. Later, both teams came out and played four questions each at either $200, $300 or $400. The team with the most money at the end of this round went onto a bonus game. The secret word was around, but since it was never guessed, it&#x27;s unknown whether the duck survived for this pilot, but Richard told one couple one the pilot &quot;if you say the secret word you&#x27;ll win $100 each&quot; so based on that it&#x27;s assumed the secret word was worth $200.

In the bonus game, sidekick Steve Carlson read questions with either true or false answers. The players locked in their answers over a 30 second period. If the players match on 5 answers and their matched answer is correct, the team won $5,000. If they don&#x27;t reach five, they earn $200 per correct match.

===1992–1993: Bill Cosby===

Another version hosted by Bill Cosby aired from September 7, 1992, to June 4, 1993 (with repeats airing until September 3 of that year), in syndication. Carsey-Werner syndicated the series, the first show they distributed themselves. Cosby was joined on this show by a female announcer and sidekick, Robbi Chong, who was referred to as &quot;Renfield&quot;. Organist Shirley Scott contributed the jazzy theme music, and the program was taped in Philadelphia at the studios of public television station WHYY-TV (the former taping site of Nickelodeon&#x27;s &quot;Double Dare&quot; and &quot;Finders Keepers&quot;).

Three couples competed, with each couple playing the game individually. After the couple was introduced, they spent time talking with Cosby. When the interview was done, the game began. Each couple was staked with $750 and were then asked three questions within a category presented at the start of the game. Before each question, the couple made a wager, which would be added to their winnings if they were correct or subtracted if they were incorrect. The secret word in this version, worth $500, was delivered by a stuffed toy black goose dressed in a sweatshirt from Temple University, Cosby&#x27;s alma mater; if one couple said it, a new word would be chosen when the next couple was introduced.

The couple with the most money (independent of any secret word bonuses) advanced to the bonus round, in which they were asked one last question in any given subject. A correct answer won a choice of three envelopes, which were all attached to the goose. Two of the envelopes displayed the goose&#x27;s face and would double the couple&#x27;s money, while the third awarded an additional $10,000.

As the 1992/93 season progressed, many stations carrying the show either moved it to overnight time slots or dropped it entirely due to low ratings.

===2021–2023: Jay Leno===

In September 2020, it was announced that Fox First Run would reboot the show in syndication, which premiered on September 13, 2021, with Jay Leno as host. Carsey-Werner&#x27;s Tom Werner will return as executive producer. It was stated that the revival would also include bits carried over from Leno&#x27;s tenure on &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; and &quot;The Jay Leno Show&quot;, such as Headlines, and that Kevin Eubanks, who had been Leno&#x27;s bandleader on &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; from 1995 to 2009 and for a brief time in 2010, and &quot;The Jay Leno Show&quot; (as the Primetime band). and comic foil for much of his run on &quot;Tonight&quot;, would serve as sidekick; Leno plans on avoiding any political or topical humor to keep the show evergreen.

In this format, two teams of two contestants per show answer four questions in one category; some are multiple-choice, while others are open-ended. The first question is worth $250, and the value increases by $250 per question to a maximum of $1,000. After the fourth question, each member of the team may either end the game and keep their share of the winnings, or play a fifth question; a correct answer doubles their total, while a miss forfeits it. The secret word (sponsored by CarGurus in the first season and Bingo Blitz and Slotomania in the second season), awards a $500 bonus as in the 1992-93 revival. Starting in the second season, if the contestants answer a random question correctly, a follow-up bonus question was asked where if answered correctly, the contestants are awarded a $1,000 bonus. A team can win up to $6,500 by answering all five questions correctly, answering the bonus question correctly, and saying the secret word. If time permits at the end of an episode, one audience member is asked a question and can win a prize for giving the correct answer.

The opening comedy segments, including &quot;Headlines&quot;, were removed at the end of the first season; starting with the second season, the program begins with Leno chatting with first set of contestants.

Production of a planned third season was suspended after Writers Guild of America members went on strike in May 2023, as Leno refused to cross the picket line in solidarity. Instead of continuing to air reruns into the 2023–24 season, stations that carried the program replaced it with other syndicated fare in the interim, with Fox First Run offering two other syndicated game shows, &quot;Person, Place or Thing&quot; (which entered national syndication that season following a six-week test run in the Summer of 2022 on selected Fox-owned stations) and &quot;Who the Bleep Is That&quot; (which was alternately offered to selected Fox O&amp;Os as a substitute, following an initial six-week test run on Fox O&amp;Os the previous Spring), to fill its vacated timeslots. As a result of the strike, the show was cancelled in August 2023.

==Episode status==
Most of the episodes still exist, with 1954–61 episodes syndicated by NBC as &quot;The Best Of Groucho&quot;. Also existing is the unaired pilot episode (TV version), which was produced for CBS on December 5, 1949. A handful of audio recordings from the radio show also exist dating as far back as 1947, as do a number of one-hour, uncut audio recordings, which were edited to create the radio version, mostly from spring 1949 and fall 1953.

Unlike most pre-1973 NBC in-house productions, it was not part of the package of series sold to National Telefilm Associates. Producer John Guedel explained why the &quot;You Bet Your Life&quot; shows were excluded: &quot;They were slow and in black-and-white and old-fashioned. When NBC sold its library to NTA and went out of the syndication business, NTA had no interest in Groucho.&quot; Marx&#x27;s grandson, Andy Marx, confirmed the story.

While Groucho Marx was entertaining show business friends at a 1973 party, an employee at an NBC warehouse called and announced that the network was discarding its inventory of &quot;You Bet Your Life&quot; film prints to make room for newer series. The network was willing to give the reels back to Marx for free. Although Marx wasn&#x27;t interested in the physical film prints, those present at the party convinced him to take the prints so they would not be destroyed. Once the hundreds of film cans arrived, Marx, dismayed at the sheer volume of the library, contacted Guedel. Guedel, anxious to see if there was still a market for the show, sold it on a trial basis to a local station for less than $50 for each night. The show became an instant success, prompting Guedel to send the reruns into syndication almost immediately.

With Guedel having &quot;made a royalty deal with NBC to syndicate&quot; the old shows himself, NBC still held ancillary rights of this version, thus distribution began with NBC Enterprises from 2001 to 2004. Since September 2004, NBCUniversal Syndication Studios handles syndication rights to the Marx (non-public domain) and Hackett versions.

In the United States, public domain and official releases were distributed on home video by the following companies:

*NBC Home Video (1984–85)
*Ambrose Video (1988–98)
*Brentwood Home Video (1998–2001)
*Alpha Video Classics (2001–11)
*Goodtimes DVD (2000–02)
*Passion Productions (2005–present)
*Brentwood Communications (2005–08)
*BCI Navarre (2011–present)
Additionally, two official DVD compilations were released by Shout! Factory and Sony Music Entertainment; the first was &quot;You Bet Your Life: The Lost Episodes&quot;, released in 2003, which contained 18 classic episodes not seen since the original broadcasts, as well as numerous bonus features, including outtakes, a behind-the-scenes piece, and rare audio clips. A second release, &quot;You Bet Your Life: The Best Episodes&quot;, followed in 2004 and included another assortment of 18 original episodes, as well as three game show pilots featuring Marx among its bonus features. Both of the DVD presentations in both of SHOUT! Factory/Sony Music Entertainment&#x27;s DVD releases of &quot;Groucho Marx’s You Bet Your Life&quot; were presented uncut and unedited, remastered and restored from the original kinescopes and in its original NBC broadcast presentation.

The Carsey-Werner Company owns the Cosby version, as it produced that revival with Cosby.

<doc id="926504" wikidata="Q1627868" url="?curid=926504" title="Horace Gray">
<text>Horace Gray (March 24, 1828 – September 15, 1902) was an American jurist who served on the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court, and then on the United States Supreme Court, where he frequently interpreted the Constitution in ways that increased the powers of Congress. Noted for possessing a sharp mind and an enthusiasm for legal research, he was also a staunch supporter of the authority of precedent throughout his career, and would write landmark opinions in cases such as &quot;Elk v. Wilkins&quot; and &quot;United States v. Wong Kim Ark&quot;.

==Early life==
Gray was born in Boston, Massachusetts, the son of Horace and Harriet Upham Gray, and grandson of merchant and politician William Gray. He enrolled at Harvard College at the age of 13, and graduated four years later. After traveling in Europe for a time, Gray entered Harvard Law School, from which he graduated with an LL.B. in 1849. Gray was admitted to the bar in 1851, and practiced law in Boston for 13 years.

==Judicial career==
===Massachusetts state courts===
In 1854, he was named Reporter of Decisions for the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court. While serving in this capacity, Gray edited sixteen volumes of court records, and also served as a counselor to the governor of Massachusetts on legal and constitutional questions. The quality of Gray&#x27;s work earned him a reputation for historical scholarship and legal research.

Gray was appointed to the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court as an associate justice in 1864. At age 36, he was the youngest appointee in the Court&#x27;s history. Nine years later he was elevated to chief justice. While serving as chief justice, Gray hired Louis D. Brandeis as a clerk, becoming the first justice of that court to hire a law clerk.

===United States Supreme Court===
In December 1881, President Chester A. Arthur nominated Gray to fill the vacancy on the U.S. Supreme Court created by the death of Nathan Clifford. The United States Senate quickly confirmed his appointment, and on January 9, 1882, he officially joined the Court.

As he had been in Massachusetts, Gray was also the first U.S. Supreme Court justice to hire a law clerk. He used his own funds to pay the clerk&#x27;s salary, as no government money was appropriated for this purpose at the time. Additionally, he was one of the few Supreme Court appointees in the latter half of the 19th century who had not previously been a politician, and he maintained the opinion that law and politics were entirely separate fields.

Two years after joining the Court, he wrote the majority opinion in &quot;Juilliard v. Greenman&quot; (1884), the last of the post–Civil War &quot;Legal Tender Cases&quot;, which reaffirmed that Congress did have the power to issue paper money as legal tender. The 8–1 decision rested largely on prior court cases as well as an assessment of what the Framers of the Constitution intended to achieve (i.e. their original intent) through their grant of certain &quot;Enumerated powers&quot; to Congress in Article I, Section 8.

The most enduring of his written opinions is the one he authored in &quot;Mutual Life Insurance Co. of New York v. Hillmon&quot; (1892), which held that a declarant&#x27;s out-of-court statement of his intention to do something or go somewhere in the future is admissible under the &quot;state-of-mind&quot; hearsay exception. &quot;The letters in question were competent, not as narratives of facts communicated to [Walters] by others, nor yet as proof that he actually went away from Wichita, but as evidence that, shortly before the time when other evidence tended to show that he went away, he had the intention of going, and of going with Hillmon, which made it more probable both that he did go and that he went with Hillmon, than if there had been no proof of such intention.&quot; This holding was subsequently codified in Rule 803(3) of the &quot;Federal Rules of Evidence&quot;, as well as the evidence laws in most states.

Gray was also the author of the 1898 case &quot;United States v. Wong Kim Ark&quot;, ruling that &quot;a child born in the United States, of parents of Chinese descent, who, at the time of his birth, are subjects of the Emperor of China, but have a permanent domicil and residence in the United States, and are there carrying on business, and are not employed in any diplomatic or official capacity under the Emperor of China, becomes at the time of his birth a citizen of the United States.&quot;.

He joined the majority in &quot;Pollock v. Farmers&#x27; Loan &amp; Trust Co.&quot; (1895), a 5–4 ruling that the unapportioned income taxes on interest, dividends and rents imposed by the Income Tax Act of 1894 were unconstitutional. This case was heard twice, though only the second hearing resulted in a decision; the justices, feeling that the opinions written had not adequately explained their view of the situation, wished to rehear the case. After the first hearing, Gray wrote that he sided with the defendant (Farmer&#x27;s Loan &amp; Trust), arguing that the tax was indeed constitutional. He was in the minority, however. After the second hearing, Gray changed his stance, joining with the majority in favor of the plaintiff. He also sided with the majority in &quot;Plessy v. Ferguson&quot; (1896), a 7–1 ruling that upheld the constitutionality of racial segregation laws for public facilities as long as the segregated facilities were equal in quality.

Gray served on the US Supreme Court for over 20 years, until his death on September 15, 1902. He was succeeded by a fellow Massachusetts native, Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr., who, like Gray, previously served on the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court.

==Personal life==
He was elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society in 1860, and in 1866, was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.

In 1889, Gray married Jane Matthews (1860–1949), daughter of fellow associate justice Stanley Matthews.

Gray&#x27;s half-brother, John Chipman Gray, was long-time professor at Harvard Law School, and is noted for his formative text on the rule against perpetuities.

He is buried in Mount Auburn Cemetery in Middlesex County, Massachusetts.

His home in Washington, D.C. later became the site of the Third Church of Christ, Scientist, which was demolished in 2014.

<doc id="926510" wikidata="Q1941711" url="?curid=926510" title="Confield">
<text>Confield is the sixth studio album by British electronic music duo Autechre. It was released on 30 April 2001 through Warp Records on 2xLP, CD and digital services. The album marked a significant shift in sound for the duo, moving towards abstract and experimental tracks instead of the previous warm, ambient sounds of &quot;Amber&quot; and &quot;Tri Repetae&quot;. &quot;Confield&quot; was the first Autechre studio album to utilise generative programs such as Max. The album received mixed reviews; some critics enjoyed its experimental nature, while others thought it was overly robotic and unapproachable.

== Background ==
Autechre are a British electronic music duo composed of members Rob Brown and Sean Booth. After the release of the self-titled album &quot;Lego Feet&quot; in 1991, their first project under the Autechre name would come with the release of &quot;Cavity Job&quot; later in December. The duo&#x27;s first studio album, &quot;Incunabula&quot;, was a surprise success. After signing with Warp Records, the duo would go on to release albums such as &quot;Amber&quot; and &quot;Tri Repetae&quot;, which were received mostly positively by critics.

== Production ==
With &quot;Confield&quot;, the duo largely abandoned the ambient and melodic styles of their earlier works such as &quot;Amber&quot; and &quot;Tri Repetae&quot; in favour of more chaotic and abstract sound palettes. As their style grew more experimental, &quot;Confield&quot; and their later albums would see the use of software like Max to form the basis of songs rather than physical synthesisers. According to Booth, most tracks from &quot;Confield&quot; originated from experiments with this software that would not fit in with a club environment.

&quot;Confield&quot; and later releases by the duo such as &quot;Exai&quot; would make use of generative sequences done through Max. Brown and Booth later noted the use of something called &quot;the system&quot; while making their music; a large network of synthesisers and other digital processes. The duo have also stated in interviews that the music created by this system is not entirely random, and still requires human control to guide and change tracks.

== Composition == 
&quot;Confield&quot; has been described as IDM, experimental, electronic, electronica, and abstract. In a review for &quot;Pitchfork&quot;, Malcolm Seymour III described how abstract the album was in comparison to the duo&#x27;s previous projects. Seymour III also stated how &quot;Confield&quot; was a lot less accessible to newer listeners compared to Autechre&#x27;s previous projects. Mike Barnes of &quot;The Independent&quot; called the music harsh but beautiful, noting its repetitive beats and its complex rhythms throughout. In a retrospective review of &quot;Tri Repetae&quot; for &quot;The Quietus&quot;, Gary Suarez noted how the album treated melodies like &quot;bitter foes&quot;, with sounds being timestretched and manipulated. Louise Bradbury of &quot;OffBeat&quot; noted how melodies &quot;took secondseat&quot; with &quot;Confield&quot;, with sweeping percussive elements being the main focus of the album.

Tony Naylor of &quot;NME&quot; called &quot;Sim Gishel&quot; a track with atmospheric, stifled melodies and disjointed beats. &quot;Eidetic Casin&quot; was also noted for its &quot;iridescent chimes&quot;. Pascal Wyse of &quot;The Guardian&quot; commented on the &quot;strange sampled snoring&quot; of &quot;Uviol&quot; and the melodies resembling voices on &quot;Lentic Cathachresis&quot;. In a review for AllMusic, John Bush described &quot;Cfern&quot; as a track that &quot;keeps listeners guessing&quot; with conflicting rhythms and confusing beats. Bush also said the opener &quot;VI Scose Poise&quot; contained &quot;bouncing-ball-in-a-ring-modulator production&quot; along with melodies in the minor key. Seymour III compared &quot;Pen Expers&quot; to drill &#x27;n&#x27; bass with &quot;vacuum-navigated&quot; percussion. &quot;Parhelic Triangle&quot; contains a brooding baseline and a variety of chimes; Seymour III compared the track to &quot;Acroyear2&quot; from &quot;LP5&quot;. In &quot;Sounding Art&quot;, Katharine Norman stated &quot;Bine&quot; contained warped drum machines and disordered sounds. Norman compared the track to a &quot;machine gone mad&quot;.

== Reception ==
&quot;Confield&quot; received mixed reviews from critics. Despite this, at Metacritic, which aggregates scores from mainstream critics and assigns a weighted average, &quot;Confield&quot; has an average score of 82 based on 10 reviews, indicating &quot;critical acclaim&quot;.

Reviewing the album for &quot;Pitchfork&quot;, Malcolm Seymour III gave the album an 8.8 out of 10, concluding that Autechre fans would feel alienated by the release. However, Seymour III also noted the high production value of the album and that it was &quot;thought-provoking&quot;. Tony Naylor of &quot;NME&quot; gave &quot;Confield&quot; an 8 out of 10, stating the release was not &quot;emotionally detached&quot; and calling it both &quot;biologically warm&quot; and imaginative. &quot;Spin&quot;&#x27;s Eric Weisbard gave the album a 7 out of 10, concluding that the album was a variety of six minute tracks that set texture-beats against drone-shimmers. &quot;Confield&quot; was covered in a 2001 issue of &quot;Billboard&quot;, stating that the duo&#x27;s music would likely be picked apart, as well as calling them influential. It was also noted that the audience should instead &quot;sit back and let [the album] wash over [them]&quot;. In a review for &quot;Blender&quot;, Douglas Wolk described how the duo had moved away from traditional compositions to fractured beats that &quot;detonate in flurries&quot;. Wolk also noted how Autechre &quot;[pushed] the outer limits of their craft&quot; with &quot;Confield&quot;. Louise Bradbury of &quot;OffBeat&quot; gave a positive review, calling the album &quot;breathtaking&quot;.

Ben Sisario gave &quot;Confield&quot; three stars in the &quot;The Rolling Stone Album Guide&quot;. Sisario mentioned the &quot;crunching, robotic rhythms&quot; and &quot;clean, spacey melodies&quot; of &quot;Confield&quot; and &quot;Draft 7.30&quot;, but also noted how newer Autechre releases maintained a sense of &quot;mind-numbing sameness&quot;. John Bush of AllMusic gave the album three stars and commented that the album contained signs of the duo&#x27;s earlier work. However, he also noted its experimental nature and said it was an album that should be respected instead of enjoyed. Pascal Wyse of &quot;The Guardian&quot; gave the album three stars, concluding that the release was overly robotic and comparing it to information overload. Mark Jenkins of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; compared the sounds on &quot;Confield&quot; to the sound of a skipping CD player. Jenkins also noted the stylistic change from &quot;smooth and pulsing&quot; tracks on the duo&#x27;s previous works to &quot;ragged and fidgety&quot; tracks within the album. For &quot;Muzik&quot;, Thomas Green gave &quot;Confield&quot; a 2/5, likening its sounds to manipulated metal filaments within a dustbin. While Green stated their diehard fans would still enjoy the album, he also said the duo simply &quot;didn&#x27;t surprise any more&quot;.

<text>The Burns&#x27; Day Storm (also known as Cyclone Daria) was an extremely violent windstorm that took place on 25–26 January 1990 over North-Western Europe. It is one of the strongest European windstorms on record and caused many fatalities in the UK and Europe. This storm has received different names, as there was no official list of such events in Europe at the time. Starting on Burns Day, the birthday of the Scottish poet Robert Burns, it caused widespread damage and hurricane-force winds over a wide area.

== Meteorological history ==

The storm began as a cold front over the Northern Atlantic Ocean on 23 January. By 24 January, it had a minimum central pressure of and began to undergo explosive cyclogenesis, which was sometimes referred to as a weather bomb. It made landfall on the morning of 25 January over Ireland. It then tracked over to Ayrshire in Scotland. The lowest pressure of was estimated near Edinburgh around 16:00. After hitting the United Kingdom, the storm tracked rapidly east towards Denmark causing major damage and a further 30 deaths in the Netherlands and Belgium.

===Winds===
The strongest sustained winds recorded were between , comparable to a weak Category 1 hurricane or Hurricane-force 12 on the Beaufort Scale. Strong gusts of up to were reported, which caused the most extensive damage. The Great Storm of 1987 contained considerably higher wind speeds across every parameter but affected a smaller area of the UK; both highest recorded sustained wind speeds of 86 mph and highest gust of 135 mph, for example. Sustained periods of high gust speeds were also far higher in 1987. However, during the 1987 storm, many anemometers stopped recording because of power outages, breakages by the excess wind speeds and measurement maxima being exceeded. By 1990, the meteorological community had newer devices that remained independent of external power and could measure higher wind speeds. The general opinion is that wind speeds measured during the Burns&#x27; Day Storm provide an accurate picture, but there is a tendency to downplay windspeeds from the 1987 storm because of the patchy data available. In the 1987 storm, it was the counties of Sussex, Surrey, Kent and Essex (i.e. the SE of England) which were worst hit and suffered the most damage. A Met Office forecaster the 
previous day, Michael Fish, notoriously said he had assured a lady enquirer that &quot;there was not going to be a &#x27;hurricane&#x27;&quot;.

===Forecasting===
The Burns&#x27; Day Storm of 1990 has been given as an example of when the Met Office &quot;got the prediction right&quot;. The model forecast hinged on observations from two ships in the Atlantic near the developing storm the day before it reached the UK.

During the day of the storm, the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute (KNMI) increased warnings to force 11 and eventually to hurricane force 12. It conducted research that showed that most of the general public could not understand the severity of the warnings. The storm has led to more awareness and understanding of storminess among the public by the KNMI, which started a teletext page and the introduction of special warnings for extreme weather events in reaction to these findings.

== Impacts ==

Casualties were much higher than those of the Great Storm of 1987 because the storm hit during the daytime. There were 47 deaths in the UK, most caused by collapsing buildings or falling debris. A school girl was killed by a falling tree at her school in Presales, in Ware, Hertfordshire. In one case in Sussex, a class of children was evacuated just minutes before their school building collapsed. The actor Gorden Kaye was also injured during the storm when a plank of an advertising board was blown through his car&#x27;s windscreen. The storm caused extensive damage, with approximately 3 million trees downed, power disrupted to over 500,000 homes and severe flooding in England and West Germany. The storm cost insurers in the UK£3.37 billion, the UK&#x27;s most expensive weather event to insurers.

<doc id="926522" wikidata="Q1345621" url="?curid=926522" title="Marco Biagi (jurist)">
<text>Marco Biagi (24 November 1950 – 19 March 2002) was an Italian jurist and economist. A native of Bologna, he was professor of labour law and industrial relations at the University of Modena.

==Life==
In 1984, Biagi was appointed Professor of Labour Law and Italian and Comparative Trade Union Law at the University of Modena, in the Department of Business Administration. From 1987 to 2002 he also served as a full professor at the Faculty of Economics.

From 1986 to 2002, he was Adjunct a Professor of Comparative Industrial Relations at Dickinson College and a member of the Academic Council of the Johns Hopkins University, Bologna Center. From 1988 to 2000, he was scientific director of SINNEA International, the research and training institute of the Lega delle cooperative. In 1991, at the Department of Business Administration at Modena University, he founded the Centre for International and Comparative Studies, and set up an innovative research programme in labour law and industrial relations.

<text>Draft 7.30 is the seventh studio album by English electronic music duo Autechre, released on 7 April 2003 by Warp Records.

Around the time of the album&#x27;s release, Sean Booth stated in an interview that &quot;[rhythm] doesn&#x27;t seem to limit us in the way it did when we first started&quot;.

==Reception==
The album received mixed to positive reviews from critics. Dominique Leone of &quot;Pitchfork Media&quot; said the album &quot;doesn&#x27;t break much new ground&quot;, but also thought that &quot;Booth and Brown return to more straightforward grounds, even if they don&#x27;t quite reach their mid-90s peak as melodic technicians&quot;. Pascal Wyse of &quot;The Guardian&quot; said, &quot;Buried in this splintered, maths-driven world, down there with the metal insects, are shards of musical convention that keep a humanity alive&quot;, adding that the music &quot;becomes quite a beautiful picture of the chaos of your brain&quot;.

<text>The AK-230 is a Soviet radar-controlled 30mm naval anti-aircraft autocannon. It is mounted in an enclosed automatic turret and directed by radar. The AK-230 is widely used, mounted on large warships as well as small craft. About 1450 guns were produced in the USSR, and about 300 were produced in China as the Type 69. It was succeeded by the more powerful AK-630 from the mid-to-late 1970s.

==Development and service==

Development of the weapon began during the 1950s, with the first trial weapon fitted to the &quot;Osa&quot; class of fast attack missile boats and &quot;Shershen&quot; class torpedo boats. The weapon was officially accepted into service in 1969. Its service life was relatively short due to the fielding of the AK-630 system in the mid-1970s, which uses the same mountings and can be controlled by the same fire control systems. While its 30×210 mm round was much more powerful than the AK-630&#x27;s 30×165 mm one, having the muzzle velocity of (the same as with 30×173 mm GAU-8&#x27;s cartridge), the moderately powered AK-630&#x27;s round allowed for much higher rates of fire, especially in a Gatling-type weapon, which was considered more advantageous for the anti-aircraft system.

==Description==
The weapon consists of two stabilized NN-30 30 mm water-cooled four chamber revolver cannons, which are mounted inside a riveted steel turret. The gun mechanism is gas operated. The guns each weigh and have barrels long, and a total length of . The barrels are rifled with 12 grooves. The guns each have a rate of fire of 1,000 round per minute; they are fed by independent 500-round belts of ammunition.

The rounds are electrically fired; propellent gases are used to eject the spent shells and belt links into a space between the magazine and the hull. The ballistic maximum range for the weapon is about , but realistic ranges for engaging air targets are quoted as between .

The weapon is remote-directed, typically by a fire-control system linked to either a MR-104 &quot;Rys&quot; (NATO reporting name: &quot;Drum Tilt&quot;) or MR-103 &quot;Bars&quot; (NATO reporting name: &quot;Muff Cobb&quot;) radar systems.

==Ammunition==
The AK-230 fires specially developed 30x210B 30 mm ammunition that is electrically primed. Two rounds were developed: a high-explosive round with an impact fuze, and an armour-piercing round. The Chinese Type 69 fires only a locally produced version of the high-explosive round. Ammunition is also produced in Romania and Serbia.

==Specifications==
* Calibre: 30 mm
* Traverse: +180 to -180 degrees at 35 degree/s
* Elevation: -12 to +87 degrees at 50 degree/s
* Mounting weight: 
* Rate of fire: 2,000 rpm (system)
* Gun Weight: 
* Gun Length oa: 
* Bore Length: 
* Rifling Length: 
* Grooves: 12
* Chamber Volume:

<text>&quot;Chav&quot; (), also &quot;charver&quot;, &quot;scally&quot; and &quot;roadman&quot; in parts of England, is a British term, usually used in a pejorative way. The term is used to describe an anti-social lower-class youth dressed in sportswear. Julie Burchill described the term as a form of &quot;social racism&quot;. &quot;Chavette&quot; is a related term referring to female chavs, and the adjectives &quot;chavvy&quot;, &quot;chavvish&quot;, and &quot;chavtastic&quot; are used to describe things associated with chavs, such as fashion, slang, etc. In other countries like Ireland, &quot;skanger&quot; is used in a similar manner. In Ontario (particularly in Toronto), the term is &quot;hoodman&quot;, an equivalent of the term &quot;roadman&quot; used in England. In Newfoundland, &quot;skeet&quot; is used in a similar way, while in Australia, &quot;eshay&quot; or &quot;adlay&quot; is used.

==Etymology==
Opinion is divided on the origin of the term. &quot;Chav&quot; may have its origins in the Romani word &quot;chavi&quot; (&quot;child&quot;) or &quot;chaval&quot; (&quot;boy&quot;), which later came to mean &quot;man&quot;. The word &quot;chavvy&quot; has existed since at least the 19th century; lexicographer Eric Partridge mentions it in his 1950 dictionary of slang and unconventional English, giving its date of origin as c. 1860.

The word in its current pejorative usage is recorded by the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; as first used in a Usenet forum in 1998 and first used in a newspaper in 2002. By 2005, the term had become widely used to refer to a type of anti-social, uncultured youth, portrayed as wearing excessive flashy jewellery, white athletic shoes, baseball caps, and sham designer clothes. Similarly, girls are portrayed as commonly wearing clothes which expose their midriffs.

In his 2011 book, &quot;&quot;, Owen Jones argued that the word is an attack on the poor. In the 2010 book &quot;Stab Proof Scarecrows&quot; by Lance Manley, it was surmised that &quot;chav&quot; was an abbreviation for &quot;council housed and violent&quot;. Others regard this as a backronym. This interpretation of the word was used in a 2012 public statement by rapper Plan B as he spoke out to oppose the use of the term.

In 2013, linguist David Crystal said on BBC Learning English:
People talk about &quot;chav behaviour&quot; or &quot;chav insults&quot; and that sort of thing. Oh, don&#x27;t believe the popular etymologies that you read sometimes in the press and on websites. I saw one the other day, people said, &quot;It&#x27;s an acronym, &#x27;chav&#x27;, from &#x27;council house and violent&#x27;&quot;—well, no, it isn&#x27;t, that was made up in recent times.

It has also been suggested that the term is derived from the name of the town of Chatham, in Kent, but the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; thinks this is &quot;probably a later rationalization&quot;.

==Stereotype==

Besides referring to loutish (ill-mannered) behaviour, violence, and particular speech patterns (all of which are stereotypes), the chav stereotype includes wearing branded designer sportswear, which may be accompanied by some form of flashy gold jewellery otherwise termed as &quot;bling&quot;. They have been described as adopting &quot;black culture&quot;.

In a case where a teenage woman was barred from her own home under the terms of an anti-social behaviour order in 2005, some British national newspapers branded her &quot;the real-life Vicky Pollard&quot; with the &quot;Daily Star&quot; running headlines reading, &quot;Good riddance to chav scum: real life Vicky Pollard evicted&quot;, both referring to a BBC comedy character . A 2006 survey by YouGov suggested 70% of TV industry professionals believed that Vicky Pollard was an accurate reflection of white working-class youth.

Response to the stereotype has ranged from amusement to criticism, with some saying that it is a new manifestation of classism. &quot;The Guardian&quot; in 2011 identified issues stemming from the use of the terms &quot;hoodies&quot; and &quot;chav&quot; within the mass media, which had led to age discrimination as a result of mass media-created stereotypes.

===Commercial effect===
In 2005 the fashion house Burberry, whilst deriding chavs, claimed that the widespread fashion in the UK of chavs wearing its branded style (Burberry check) was due to the widespread availability of cheaper counterfeit versions.

The large supermarket chain Asda has attempted to trademark the word &quot;chav&quot; for a line of confectionery. A spokeswoman said, &quot;With slogans from characters in shows such as &quot;Little Britain&quot; and &quot;The Catherine Tate Show&quot; providing us with more and more contemporary slang, our &#x27;Whatever&#x27; sweets — now nicknamed chav hearts — have become very popular with kids and grown-ups alike. We thought we needed to give them some respect and have decided to trademark our sweets.&quot;

==Criticism of the stereotype==
A BBC TV documentary suggested that chav culture is an evolution of previous working-class youth subcultures associated with particular commercial clothing styles, such as mods, skinheads, and casuals.

In a February 2005 article in &quot;The Times&quot;, Julie Burchill argued that use of the word is a form of &quot;social racism&quot;, and that such &quot;sneering&quot; reveals more about the shortcomings of the &quot;chav-haters&quot; than those of their supposed victims. The writer John Harris argued along similar lines in a 2007 article in &quot;The Guardian&quot;. The widespread use of the &quot;chav&quot; stereotype has been criticised. Some argue that it amounts to simple snobbery and elitism. Critics of the term have argued that its users are &quot;neo-snobs&quot;, and that its increasing popularity raises questions about how British society deals with social mobility and class.

The Fabian Society considers the term to be offensive and regards it as &quot;sneering and patronising&quot; to a largely voiceless group. On describing those who use the word, the society stated that &quot;we all know their old serviette/napkin, lounge/living room, settee/sofa tricks. But this is something new. This is middle class hatred of the white working class, pure and simple. The Fabian Society have been highly critical of the BBC in using the term in broadcasts. Use of the term &#x27;chav&#x27; was reported in &quot;The Guardian&quot; in 2011 as &quot;class abuse by people asserting superiority&quot;. Writer Owen Jones also criticised the use of the term in his book &quot;&quot;.

==In the media==
By 2004, the word was used in national newspapers and common parlance in the UK. Susie Dent&#x27;s &quot;Larpers and Shroomers: The Language Report&quot;, published by the Oxford University Press, designated it as the &quot;word of the year&quot; in 2004.

Characters described as &quot;chavs&quot; have been featured in numerous British television programmes, as well as films. The character, clothing, attitude and musical interests of Lauren Cooper and her friends in the BBC comedy series, &quot;The Catherine Tate Show,&quot; have been associated with the chav stereotype. The character Ali G, created by Sacha Baron Cohen originally for &quot;The 11 O&#x27;Clock Show&quot; and eventually gaining more popularity due to the &quot;Da Ali G Show&quot;, is described as using &quot;the chav&#x27;s putative anti-intellectuality to critique radical political stances&quot;. The BBC comedy series &quot;Little Britain&quot; features the character Vicky Pollard (portrayed by Matt Lucas), a parody of a teenage female chav. In the British television series &quot;Misfits&quot;, the character of Kelly Bailey is presented as a stereotypical chav. Lauren Socha, the actress who portrays Kelly, has described the character as being &quot;a bit chavvy&quot;. &quot;The Times&quot; has referred to the character as &quot;[a] chavvish girl&quot;, and the character has been said to possess a &quot;chav accent&quot;.

In the &quot;New Earth&quot; episode of the BBC TV series &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, the character Lady Cassandra is transplanted into Rose Tyler&#x27;s body (Billie Piper). When Cassandra sees herself in a mirror, she exclaims &quot;Oh my God... I&#x27;m a chav!&quot; In &quot;&quot;, the main character Eggsy Unwin (Taron Egerton) is introduced as a stereotypical chav.

<text>EP7 is the seventh EP by the electronic music group Autechre, released by Warp Records on 7 June 1999. It is classified as an EP by the band despite being long enough to qualify as an album. The record was released in two parts on vinyl, named EP7.1 and EP7.2. The name of this EP prompted Warp Records to give the name &quot;LP5&quot; to the previously released untitled album by the band.

The fractal on the cover was designed with a circuit board designer. The minisite created by Warp also featured a fractal generator that would create new artwork similar to that featured throughout the liner notes.

==Reception==

&quot;EP7&quot; received mixed to positive reviews. Ryan Screiber of Pitchfork Media said the album&#x27;s primary problem was a &quot;lack of diversity&quot; and that the tracks &quot;[offer] very little in the way of originality&quot;.

==Track listing==
The original UK CD pressing includes a hidden track in the pregap. The track, which can be accessed by rewinding from the beginning of &quot;Rpeg&quot;, is 6:44 in duration and is followed by 3:01 of silence. Some CD players do not handle the trick, and may skip &quot;Rpeg&quot; because of it. The hidden track was not included on the US release nor on vinyl. The hidden track is included on Autechre&#x27;s &quot;EPs 1991–2002&quot; box set, with the CD version retaining the track&#x27;s pregap placement. In 2010, Pitchfork Media included the &quot;EP7&quot; hidden track in their list of &quot;ten unusual CD-era gimmicks.&quot;

<doc id="926547" wikidata="Q741916" url="?curid=926547" title="Pirs (ISS module)">
<text>Pirs &quot;(&quot;, meaning &quot;pier&quot;) – also called Stykovochny Otsek 1 (SO-1; , &quot;docking module&quot;) and DC-1 (Docking Compartment 1) – was a Russian module on the International Space Station (ISS). &quot;Pirs&quot; was launched on 14 September 2001, and was located on the &quot;Zvezda&quot; module of the station. It provided the ISS with one docking port for Soyuz and Progress spacecraft, and allowed egress and ingress for spacewalks by cosmonauts using Russian Orlan space suits. &quot;Pirs&quot; was docked to &quot;Zvezda&quot; for almost 20 years, until 26 July 2021, when it was decommissioned and undocked by Progress MS-16 to make way for the new &quot;Nauka&quot; module.

== Poisk module ==
A second docking compartment, Stykovochniy Otsek 2 (SO-2), was planned with the same design. However, when the Russian segment of the ISS was redesigned in 2001, the new design no longer included the SO-2, and its construction was canceled. After another change of plans the SO-2 module finally evolved into the &quot;Poisk&quot; module, which was added to the ISS in 2009.

The &quot;Pirs&quot; docking compartment had two primary functions: to provide a docking port for visiting Soyuz and Progress spacecraft and to serve as an airlock for Russian EVAs. The docking port could accommodate one Soyuz-MS or one Progress-MS spacecraft. Visiting spacecraft could deliver people and cargo to and from the space station. In addition, the Docking Compartment could transfer fuel from the fuel tanks of a docked Progress resupply vehicle to either the Zvezda Service Module’s Integrated Propulsion System or the Zarya Functional Cargo Block. It could also transfer propellant from &quot;Zvezda&quot; and &quot;Zarya&quot; to the propulsion system of docked vehicles — Soyuz and Progress. The two airlocks were designed to accommodate spacewalking cosmonauts wearing Russian Orlan-M spacesuits. The &quot;Pirs&quot; docking compartment was manufactured by RKK Energia. The Docking Compartment was similar to the Mir Docking Module used on the earlier Mir space station. The docking compartment&#x27;s planned lifetime as part of the station was five years.

== Launch ==
&quot;Pirs&quot; was launched on 14 September 2001, as ISS Assembly Mission 4R, on a Russian Soyuz-U launch vehicle, using a modified Progress spacecraft, Progress DC-1, as an upper stage. The &quot;Pirs&quot; Docking Compartment was attached to the nadir (bottom, Earth-facing) port of the &quot;Zvezda&quot; service module.

== Docking ==

&quot;Pirs&quot; docked to the International Space Station on 17 September 2001, at 01:05 UTC, and was configured during three spacewalks by the Expedition 3 crew. Two &quot;Strela&quot; cargo cranes were later added by the STS-96 and STS-101 missions, carried up on Integrated Cargo Carriers and installed during EVAs.

== Undocking and disposal ==
On 14 July 2021, Roskosmos announced that members of the 65th expedition aboard the ISS, were preparing the &quot;Pirs&quot; module for its departure on 23 July.

The &quot;Pirs&quot; module supported 52 spacewalks and served as a docking port for Russian Soyuz and Progress spacecraft ferrying crew and cargo to and from the space station. 
After nearly 20 years at the International Space Station, ISS, the &quot;Pirs&quot; Docking Compartment, SO1, undocked from the nadir (Earth-facing) port of the Zvezda Service Module, SM, on 26 July 2021, at 13:55 Moscow Time (6:55 a.m. EDT) in the joint stack with the Progress MS-16 cargo ship. At the time, the spacecraft was orbiting the Earth over Eastern China and within communications range of Russian ground stations.

Within four minutes (13:59:00 Moscow Time, according to schedule), Progress MS-16 performed a short separation burn to increase distance from the ISS. The deorbiting maneuver was planned within around three hours aiming at the reentry of the &quot;Pirs&quot;/Progress stack over the Pacific.

Progress MS-16 initiated braking maneuver as planned at 17:01 Moscow Time (10:01 a.m. EDT) and after a 1,057-second (17.6-minute) burn, the module/cargo ship duo reentered the dense atmosphere at 17:42 Moscow Time (10:42 a.m. EDT).

According to NASA, the &quot;Pirs&quot; Docking Compartment spent 19 years, 313 days 9 hours 50 minutes and 45 seconds at the station and 19 years 315 days 15 hours 10 minutes and 47 seconds in flight.

<text>The Presentation of Jesus is an early episode in the life of Jesus Christ, describing his presentation at the Temple in Jerusalem. It is celebrated by many churches 40 days after Christmas on Candlemas, or the &quot;Feast of the Presentation of Jesus&quot;. The episode is described in chapter 2 of the Gospel of Luke in the New Testament. Within the account, &quot;Luke&#x27;s narration of the Presentation in the Temple combines the purification rite with the Jewish ceremony of the redemption of the firstborn (Luke 2, ).&quot;

In the Eastern Orthodox Church, the Presentation of Jesus at the temple is celebrated as one of the twelve Great Feasts, and is sometimes called &quot;Hypapante&quot; (, &quot;meeting&quot; in Greek). 

The Orthodox Churches which use the Julian Calendar celebrate it on 15 February, and the Armenian Church on 14 February.

In Western Christianity, the &quot;Feast of the Presentation of the Lord&quot; is also known by its earlier name as the &quot;Feast of the Purification of the Virgin&quot; or the &quot;Meeting of the Lord&quot;. In some liturgical calendars, Vespers (or Compline) on the Feast of the Presentation marks the end of the Epiphany season, also (since the 2018 lectionary) in the Evangelische Kirche in Deutschland (EKD). In the Church of England, the mother church of the Anglican Communion, the Presentation of Christ in the Temple is a Principal Feast celebrated either on 2 February or on the Sunday between 28 January and 3 February. In the Roman Catholic Church, especially since the time of Pope Gelasius I (492–496) who in the fifth century contributed to its expansion, the Feast of the Presentation is celebrated on 2 February. 

In the Roman Rite of the Catholic Church, the Anglican Communion, and the Lutheran Church, the episode was also reflected in the once-prevalent custom of churching of women forty days after the birth of a child. The Feast of the Presesentation of the Lord is in the Roman Rite also attached to the World Day of Consecrated Life.

==Scripture==
The event is described in the Gospel of Luke (). According to the gospel, Mary and Joseph took the Infant Jesus to the Temple in Jerusalem forty days (inclusive) after his birth to complete Mary&#x27;s ritual purification after childbirth, and to perform the redemption of the firstborn son, in obedience to the Torah (, , etc.). Luke explicitly says that Joseph and Mary take the option provided for poor people (those who could not afford a lamb; ), sacrificing &quot;a pair of turtledoves, or two young pigeons.&quot; indicates that this event should take place forty days after birth for a male child, hence the Presentation is celebrated forty days after Christmas.

Upon bringing Jesus into the temple, they encountered Simeon. The Gospel records that Simeon had been promised that &quot;he should not see death before he had seen the Lord&#x27;s Christ&quot; (). Simeon then uttered the prayer that would become known as the &quot;Nunc Dimittis&quot;, or Canticle of Simeon, which prophesied the redemption of the world by Jesus:

&quot;Lord, now let your servant depart in peace,
according to your word; for my eyes have seen your salvation which you have prepared in the presence of all peoples, a light for revelation to the Gentiles, and for glory to your people Israel&quot;. ().

Simeon then prophesied to Mary: &quot;Behold, this child is set for the fall and rising of many in Israel, and for a sign that is spoken against (and a sword will pierce through your own soul also), that thoughts out of many hearts may be revealed. ().

The elderly prophetess Anna was also in the Temple, and offered prayers and praise to God for Jesus, and spoke to everyone there of his importance to redemption in Jerusalem ().

Cornelius a Lapide comments on Mary and Joseph sacrificing a pair of turtledoves: &quot;…because they were poor; for the rich were obliged to give in addition to this a lamb for a holocaust. Although the three kings had offered to Christ a great quantity of gold, still the Blessed Virgin, zealously affected towards poverty, accepted but little of it, that she might show her contempt of all earthly things…. The couple offered two turtledoves or two pigeons (Luke 2:24) presumably because they could not afford a lamb.

==Liturgical celebration==


===Name of the celebration===
In addition to being known as the Feast of the Presentation of Jesus at the Temple, other traditional names include Candlemas, the Feast of the Purification of the Virgin, and the Meeting of the Lord. &quot;Candlemas&quot; is an English name for the feast because of the procession with lighted candles at the Mass on this day, reflecting Simeon&#x27;s proclamation of &quot;a light for revelation to the Gentiles&quot;, which, in turn, echoes Isaiah 49:6 in the second of the &quot;servant of the Lord&quot; oracles.

The date of Candlemas is established by the date set for the Nativity of Jesus, for it comes forty days afterwards. Under Mosaic law as found in the Torah, a mother who had given birth to a boy was considered unclean for seven days; moreover she was to remain for three and thirty days &quot;in the blood of her purification.&quot; Candlemas therefore corresponds to the day on which Mary, according to Jewish law, should have attended a ceremony of ritual purification (). The Gospel of Luke 2:22–39 relates that Mary was purified according to the religious law, followed by Jesus&#x27; presentation in the Jerusalem temple, and this explains the formal names given to the festival, as well as its falling 40 days after the Nativity.

In the Roman Catholic Church, it is known as the &quot;Presentation of the Lord&quot; in the liturgical books first issued by Paul VI, and as the &quot;Purification of the Blessed Virgin Mary&quot; in earlier editions. In the Eastern Orthodox Church and Greek Catholic Churches (Eastern Catholic Churches which use the Byzantine rite), it is known as the &quot;Feast of the Presentation of our Lord, God, and Savior Jesus Christ in the Temple&quot; or as &quot;The Meeting of Our Lord, God and Saviour Jesus Christ&quot;.

It is known as the Presentation of Our Lord in the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America. The Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod observes 2 February as The Purification of Mary and the Presentation of Our Lord. 

In the churches of the Anglican Communion, it is known by various names, including &quot;The Presentation of Our Lord Jesus Christ in The Temple (Candlemas)&quot; (Episcopal Church), &quot;The Presentation of Christ in the Temple, and The Purification of the Blessed Virgin Mary&quot; (Anglican Church of Canada), &quot;The Presentation of Christ in the Temple (Candlemas)&quot; (Church of England), and &quot;The Presentation of Christ in the Temple&quot; (Anglican Church of Australia).

===Practices===
Traditionally, Candlemas had been the last feast day in the Christian year that was dated by reference to Christmas. It is another &quot;epiphany&quot; type feast as Jesus is revealed as the messiah by the canticle of Simeon and the prophetess Anna. It also fits into this theme, as the earliest manifestation of Jesus inside the house of his heavenly Father. Subsequent moveable feasts are calculated with reference to Easter.

====Western Christianity====

Candlemas occurs 40 days after Christmas.

Traditionally, the Western term &quot;Candlemas&quot; (or Candle Mass) referred to the practice whereby a priest on 2 February blessed beeswax candles for use throughout the year, some of which were distributed to the faithful for use in the home. In Poland the feast is called &quot;Święto Matki Bożej Gromnicznej&quot; (Feast of Our Lady of Thunder candles). This name refers to the candles that are blessed on this day, called gromnice, since these candles are lit during (thunder) storms and placed in windows to ward off storms.

This feast has been referred to as the Feast of Presentation of the Lord within the Roman Catholic Church since the liturgical revisions of the Second Vatican Council, with references to candles and the purification of Mary de-emphasised in favor of the Prophecy of Simeon the Righteous. Pope John Paul II connected the feast day with the renewal of religious vows. In the Roman Catholic Church, the Presentation of Jesus in the Temple is the fourth Joyful Mystery of the Rosary.

In the Liturgy of the Hours, the Marian antiphon &quot;Alma Redemptoris Mater&quot; is used from Advent through 2 February, after which &quot;Ave Regina Caelorum&quot; is used through Good Friday.

====Eastern Christianity====

In the Byzantine tradition practised by the Eastern Orthodox, the Meeting of the Lord is unique among the Great Feasts in that it combines elements of both a Great Feast of the Lord and a Great Feast of the Theotokos (Mother of God). It has a forefeast of one day, and an afterfeast of seven days. However, if the feast falls during Cheesefare Week or Great Lent, the afterfeast is either shortened or eliminated altogether.

The holiday is celebrated with an all-night vigil on the eve of the feast, and a celebration of the Divine Liturgy the next morning, at which beeswax candles are blessed. This blessing traditionally takes place after the Little Hours and before the beginning of the Divine Liturgy (though in some places it is done after). The priest reads four prayers, and then a fifth one during which all present bow their heads before God. He then censes the candles and blesses them with holy water. The candles are then distributed to the people and the Liturgy begins.

It is because of the biblical events recounted in the second chapter of Luke that the Churching of Women came to be practised in both Eastern and Western Christianity. The usage has mostly died out in the West, except among Western Rite Orthodoxy, very occasionally still among Anglicans, and Traditionalist Catholics, but the ritual is still practised in the Orthodox Church. In addition, babies, both boys and girls are taken to the Church on the fortieth day after their birth in remembrance of the Theotokos and Joseph taking the infant Jesus to the Temple.

Some Christians observe the practice of leaving Christmas decorations up until Candlemas.

===Date===
In the Eastern and Western liturgical calendars the Presentation of the Lord falls on 2 February, forty days (inclusive) after Christmas. In the Church of England it may be celebrated on this day, or on the Sunday between 28 January and 3 February. This feast never falls in Lent; the earliest that Ash Wednesday can fall is 4 February, for the case of Easter on 22 March in a non-leap year. However, in the Tridentine rite, it can fall in the pre-Lenten season if Easter is early enough, and &quot;Alleluia&quot; has to be omitted from this feast&#x27;s liturgy when that happens.

In Swedish and Finnish Lutheran Churches,
Candlemas is (since 1774) always celebrated on a Sunday, at earliest on 2 February and at latest on 8 February, except if this Sunday happens to be the last Sunday before Lent, i.e. Shrove Sunday or Quinquagesima (, ), in which case Candlemas is celebrated one week earlier.

In the Armenian Apostolic Church, the Feast, called &quot;The Coming of the Son of God into the Temple&quot; (&quot;Tiarn&#x27;ndaraj&quot;, from &quot;Tyarn-&quot;, &quot;the Lord&quot;, and &quot;-undarach&quot; &quot;going forward&quot;), is celebrated on 14 February. The Armenians do not celebrate the Nativity on 25 December, but on 6 January, and thus their date of the feast is 40 days after that: 14 February. The night before the feast, Armenians traditionally light candles during an evening church service, carrying the flame out into the darkness (symbolically bringing light into the void) and either take it home to light lamps or light a bonfire in the church courtyard.

==History==
The Feast of the Presentation is among the most ancient feasts of the Church. Celebration of the feast dates from the fourth century in Jerusalem. There are sermons on the Feast by the bishops Methodius of Patara († 312), Cyril of Jerusalem († 360), Gregory the Theologian († 389), Amphilochius of Iconium († 394), Gregory of Nyssa († 400), and John Chrysostom († 407).

The earliest reference to specific liturgical rites surrounding the feast are by the intrepid Egeria, during her pilgrimage to the Holy Land (381–384). She reported that 14 February was a day solemnly kept in Jerusalem with a procession to Constantine I&#x27;s Basilica of the Resurrection, with a homily preached on (which makes the occasion perfectly clear), and a Divine Liturgy. This so-called (&quot;Pilgrimage Itinerary&quot;) of Egeria does not, however, offer a specific name for the Feast. The date of 14 February indicates that in Jerusalem at that time, Christ&#x27;s birth was celebrated on 6 January, Epiphany. Egeria writes for her beloved fellow nuns at home:

XXVI. &quot;The fortieth day after the Epiphany is undoubtedly celebrated here with the very highest honor, for on that day there is a procession, in which all take part, in the Anastasis, and all things are done in their order with the greatest joy, just as at Easter. All the priests, and after them the bishop, preach, always taking for their subject that part of the Gospel where Joseph and Mary brought the Lord into the Temple on the fortieth day, and Symeon and Anna the prophetess, the daughter of Phanuel, saw him, treating of the words which they spake when they saw the Lord, and of that offering which his parents made. And when everything that is customary has been done in order, the sacrament is celebrated, and the dismissal takes place.&quot;

About AD 450 in Jerusalem, people began the custom of holding lighted candles during the Divine Liturgy of this feast day. Originally, the feast was a minor celebration. But then in 541, a terrible plague broke out in Constantinople, killing thousands. The Emperor Justinian I, in consultation with the Patriarch of Constantinople, ordered a period of fasting and prayer throughout the entire Empire. And, on the Feast of the Meeting of the Lord, arranged great processions throughout the towns and villages and a solemn prayer service (&quot;Litia&quot;) to ask for deliverance from evils, and the plague ceased. In thanksgiving, in 542 the feast was elevated to a more solemn celebration and established throughout the Eastern Empire by the Emperor.

In Rome, the feast appears in the &quot;Gelasian Sacramentary&quot;, a manuscript collection of the seventh and eighth centuries associated with Pope Gelasius I. There it carries for the first time the new title of the feast of Purification of the Blessed Virgin Mary. Late in time though it may be, Candlemas is still the most ancient of all the festivals in honor of the Virgin Mary. The date of the feast in Rome was 2 February because the Roman date for Christ&#x27;s nativity had been 25 December since at least the early fourth century.

Though modern laymen picture Candlemas as an important feast throughout the Middle Ages in Europe, in fact it spread slowly in the West; it is not found in the &quot;Lectionary&quot; of Silos (650) nor in the &quot;Calendar&quot; (731–741) of Sainte-Geneviève of Paris.

The tenth-century Benedictional of St. Æthelwold, bishop of Winchester, has a formula used for blessing the candles. Candlemas did become important enough to find its way into the secular calendar. It was the traditional day to remove the cattle from the hay meadows, and from the field that was to be ploughed and sown that spring. References to it are common in later medieval and early Modern literature; Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Twelfth Night&quot; is recorded as having its first performance on Candlemas Day 1602. It remains one of the Scottish quarter days, at which debts are paid and law courts are in session.

===Relation to other celebrations===
The Feast of the Presentation depends on the date for Christmas: As per the passage from the Gospel of Luke () describing the event in the life of Jesus, the celebration of the Presentation of the Lord follows 40 days after. The blessing of candles on this day recalls Simeon&#x27;s reference to the infant Jesus as the &quot;light for revelation to the Gentiles&quot; ().

Modern Pagans believe that Candlemas is a Christianization of the Gaelic festival of Imbolc, which was celebrated in pre-Christian Europe (and especially the Celtic Nations) at about the same time of year. Imbolc is called &quot;St. Brigid&#x27;s Day&quot; or &quot;Brigid&quot; in Ireland. Both the goddess Brigid and the Christian Saint Brigid—who was the Abbess of Kildare—are associated with sacred flames, holy wells and springs, healing, and smithcraft. Brigid is a virgin, yet also the patron of midwives. However, a connection with Roman (rather than Celtic or Germanic) polytheism is more plausible, since the feast was celebrated before any serious attempt to expand Christianity into non-Roman countries.

In Irish homes, there were many rituals revolving around welcoming Brigid into the home. Some of Brigid&#x27;s rituals and legends later became attached to Saint Brigid, who was seen by Celtic Christians as the midwife of Christ and &quot;Mary of the Gael&quot;. In Ireland and Scotland she is the &quot;foster mother of Jesus.&quot; The exact date of the Imbolc festival may have varied from place to place based on local tradition and regional climate. Imbolc is celebrated by modern Pagans on the eve of 2 February, at the astronomical midpoint, or on the full moon closest to the first spring thaw.

Frederick Holweck, writing in the &quot;Catholic Encyclopædia&quot; says definite in its rejection of this argument: &quot;The feast was certainly not introduced by Pope Gelasius to suppress the excesses of the Lupercalia,&quot; (referencing J.P. Migne, &quot;Missale Gothicum&quot;, 691) The &quot;1911 Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; agrees: the association with Gelasius &quot;has led some to suppose that it was ordained by Pope Gelasius I in 492 as a counter-attraction to the pagan Lupercalia; but for this there is no warrant.&quot; Since the two festivals are both concerned with the ritual purification of women, not all historians are convinced that the connection is purely coincidental. Gelasius certainly did write a treatise against Lupercalia, and this still exists.

Pope Innocent XII believed Candlemas was created as an alternative to Roman Paganism, as stated in a sermon on the subject:
Why do we in this feast carry candles? Because the Gentiles dedicated the month of February to the infernal gods, and as at the beginning of it Pluto stole Proserpine, and her mother Ceres sought her in the night with lighted candles, so they, at the beginning of the month, walked about the city with lighted candles. Because the holy fathers could not extirpate the custom, they ordained that Christians should carry about candles in honor of the Blessed Virgin; and thus what was done before in the honor of Ceres is now done in honor of the Blessed Virgin.

There is no contemporary evidence to support the popular notions that Gelasius abolished the Lupercalia, or that he, or any other prelate, replaced it with the Feast of the Purification of the Blessed Virgin Mary.

In Armenia, celebrations at the Presentation have been influenced by pre-Christian customs, such as: the spreading of ashes by farmers in their fields each year to ensure a better harvest, keeping ashes on the roof of a house to keep evil spirits away, and the belief that newlywed women needed to jump over fire to purify themselves before getting pregnant. Young men will also leap over a bonfire.

The tradition of lighting a candle in each window is not the origin of the name &quot;Candlemas&quot;, which instead refers to a blessing of candles.

On the day following Candlemas, the feast of St. Blaise is celebrated. It is connected to the rite of Blessing of the Throats, which is, for to be available to reach more people, also often transferred after the Mass of the Presentation of the Lord or even bestowed on both feasts. By coincidence, the Blessing of the Throats is bestowed with crossed candles.

==In art==
The event forms a usual component of extensive cycles of the &quot;Life of Christ&quot; and also of the &quot;Life of the Virgin&quot;. Often either the Presentation of Jesus or the visually similar &quot;Circumcision of Jesus&quot; was shown, but by the late Middle Ages the two were sometimes combined. Early images concentrated on the moment of meeting with Simeon.

In the West, beginning in the 8th or 9th century, a different depiction at an altar emerged, where Simeon eventually by the Late Middle Ages came to be shown wearing the elaborate vestments attributed to the Jewish High Priest, and conducting a liturgical ceremony surrounded by the family and Anna. In the West, Simeon is more often already holding the infant, or the moment of handover is shown; in Eastern images the Virgin is more likely still to hold Jesus. In the Eastern Churches this event is called the &quot;Hypapante&quot;.

Simeon&#x27;s comment that &quot;you yourself a sword will pierce&quot; gave rise to a subset iconography of the Sorrowful Mother.

==In music==
Many motets and anthems have been composed to celebrate this feast and are performed as part of the liturgy, among them an anthem by 16th century German composer Johannes Eccard (1553–1611), &quot;Maria wallt zum Heiligtum&quot;, often translated in English as &quot;When Mary to the Temple went&quot;.

The Lutheran church of the Baroque observed the feast as &quot;Mariae Reinigung&quot; (Purification of Mary). Johann Sebastian Bach composed several cantatas to be performed in the church service of the day, related to Simeon&#x27;s canticle &quot;Nunc dimittis&quot; as part of the prescribed readings.

* &quot;Erfreute Zeit im neuen Bunde&quot;, BWV 83, 1724
* &quot;Mit Fried und Freud ich fahr dahin&quot;, BWV 125, 1725 (on Luther&#x27;s hymn after &quot;Nunc dimittis&quot;)
* &quot;Ich habe genug&quot;, BWV 82, 1727

==Traditions and superstitions==
As the poem by Robert Herrick records, the eve of Candlemas was the day on which Christmas decorations of greenery were removed from people&#x27;s homes; for traces of berries, holly and so forth will bring death among the congregation before another year is out.

In Scotland, until a change in the law in 1991 (see Scottish term days), and in much of northern England until the 18th century, Candlemas was one of the traditional quarter days when quarterly rents were due for payment, as well as the day or term for various other business transactions, including the hiring of servants.
In the United Kingdom, good weather at Candlemas is taken to indicate severe winter weather later: &quot;If Candlemas Day is clear and bright, / winter will have another bite. / If Candlemas Day brings cloud and rain, / winter is gone and will not come again.&quot; 

The Carmina Gadelica, a seminal collection of Scottish folklore, refers to a serpent coming out of the mound on &quot;Latha Fheill Bride&quot;, as the Scots call Candlemas. This rhyme is still used in the West Highlands and Hebrides.

In the United States, Candlemas coincides with Groundhog Day, the earliest American reference to which can be found at the Pennsylvania Dutch Folklore Center at Franklin and Marshall College. The reference implies that Groundhog Day may have come from a German-American Candlemas tradition:

In France and Belgium, Candlemas () is celebrated with crêpes.

In Italy, traditionally, it () is considered the last cold day of winter.

In Tenerife (Spain), it is the day of the Virgin of Candelaria (Saint Patron of the Canary Islands). In Catalonia, it is alleged to be the date that bears emerge from hibernation. 

In Southern and Central Mexico, and Guatemala City, Candlemas () is celebrated with tamales. Tradition indicates that on 5 January, the night before Three Kings Day (the Epiphany), whoever gets one or more of the few plastic or metal dolls (originally coins) buried within the Rosca de Reyes must pay for the tamales and throw a party on Candlemas. In certain regions of Mexico, this is the day in which the baby Jesus of each household is taken up from the nativity scene and dressed up in various colorful, whimsical outfits.

In Luxembourg, &quot;Liichtmëss&quot; sees children carrying lighted sticks visiting neighbors and singing a traditional song in exchange for sweets.

Sailors are often reluctant to set sail on Candlemas Day, believing that any voyage begun then will end in disaster—given the frequency of severe storms in February, this is not entirely without sense.

According to over eight centuries of tradition, the swaddling clothes that baby Jesus wore during the presentation at the Temple are kept in Dubrovnik Cathedral, Croatia.

==Consecrations==
In Croatia, there are several Catholic churches and parishes consecrated to the Presentation of Jesus: in Đurđanci, Beli, Nevest, Dol on Brač and Smokvica.

<text>Samuel M. Blatchford (March 9, 1820 – July 7, 1893) was an American attorney and judge who served as an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States from April 3, 1882, until his death in 1893.

==Early life and career==

Blatchford was born in Auburn, New York on March 9, 1820. He was the eldest of five children born to Julia Ann (née Mumford) Blatchford and Richard Milford Blatchford (1798–1875). U.S. Army Major General Richard M. Blatchford (1859–1934) was his cousin.

Blatchford studied law under Seward and then entered into the private practice of law with his father and uncle. In 1854, he moved to New York City and started a law firm, Blatchford, Seward &amp; Griswold, now known as Cravath, Swaine &amp; Moore. He became well known for preparing summaries of United States circuit court cases, serving for a time as reporter of decisions for the Circuit Court in New York, and developed a lucrative practice in admiralty law.

On May 3, 1867, Blatchford received a recess appointment from President Andrew Johnson to a seat on the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York vacated by Samuel Betts. Formally nominated on July 13, 1867, Blatchford was confirmed by the United States Senate three days later, receiving his commission the same day.

On February 15, 1878, President Rutherford B. Hayes promoted Blatchford to serve as Circuit Judge of the Second U.S. Judicial Circuit to fill the vacancy caused by the death of Alexander Smith Johnson. Blatchford was confirmed by the Senate, and received his commission, on March 4, 1878.

==Supreme Court of the United States==

On March 13, 1882, Blatchford was nominated as an associate justice of the United States Supreme Court, by President Chester A. Arthur, to a seat vacated by Ward Hunt, after two other candidates, Senator George F. Edmunds and former Senator Roscoe Conkling, declined. He was confirmed by the United States Senate on March 22, 1882, and was sworn into office on April 3, 1882. Blatchford thus became the first person to serve at all three levels of the federal judiciary—as a District Judge, a Circuit Judge, and a Supreme Court Justice. When he was nominated for the Supreme Court, it was estimated that his personal wealth exceeded $3 million (over $77 million in 2018), mostly held in real estate.

Blatchford was an expert in admiralty law and patent law, and authored &quot;Blatchford and Howland&#x27;s Admiralty Cases&quot;, which was considered the most complete work of its kind. During his eleven-year tenure on the High Court, he wrote 430 opinions and two dissents. His most noteworthy opinions, &quot;Chicago, Milwaukee &amp; St. Paul Railway Co. v. Minnesota&quot;, and &quot;Budd v. People of New York&quot;, were roundly criticized for their apparently contradictory conclusions about due process under the Fourteenth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.

==Personal life==

Blatchford&#x27;s father was a well known attorney and friend of Daniel Webster who served as a New York State Assemblyman in 1855, U.S. Minister to the Papal States, and New York City Park Commissioner in 1872. After his mother&#x27;s death in 1857, his father remarried to Angelica Hamilton, the daughter of James Alexander Hamilton and granddaughter of Alexander Hamilton, the first Treasury Secretary. Angelica died in 1868, and Blatchford married for the third time, to Katherine Hone.

His grandfather, also named Samuel Blatchford, was born in England and was the first president of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. The younger Samuel Blatchford was educated at Columbia College, where he joined the Philolexian Society and graduated when he was 17 years old. In 1840, he served as the private secretary to Governor William H. Seward. From 1842 to 1845, he served as the Military Secretary of New York. In 1844, Blatchford was married to Caroline Frances Appleton (1817–1901) in Boston. Caroline was the daughter of Eben Appleton and Sarah (née Patterson) Appleton. Together, they had one son: Samuel Appleton Blatchford (1845–1905), also a lawyer who married Wilhelmina Bogart Conger (1848–1944), daughter of Hon. Abraham B. Conger, the namesake of Congers, New York.

On what he thought was inside information, Blatchford sold all his shares of stock on the eve of the Battle of Fort Sumter and the decline in stock prices that took place at the onset of the American Civil War, thus preserving his personal fortune.

Blatchford served as a trustee of Columbia College.

In June 1893, he was stricken with paralysis at his home in Newport, Rhode Island on Greenough Place. Blatchford died at his home in Newport at age 73 on July 7, 1893. After a funeral service at the All Saints&#x27; Chapel in Newport conducted by Bishop Henry C. Potter (his brother-in-law Edward Tuckerman Potter&#x27;s brother), his body was transported by train to New York City where he was buried at Greenwood Cemetery in Brooklyn.

In his will, which was drawn on June 15, 1876, he left $100,000 to Rachel Bliss Beckwith and $20,000 to Cordelia F. Green. To his widow, he left the furniture and artwork in his Newport home and the income from half of his estate. His son received the other half of the income and split the realty with his mother. Upon his wife&#x27;s death, one-third of her share of the realty went to Rachel Beckwith, a third to Julia Maria Potter, and the remaining third to his unmarried sister, Sophia Ethelinda Blatchford.

<doc id="926564" wikidata="Q7316139" url="?curid=926564" title="Restless (Sara Evans album)">
<text>Restless is the fourth studio album by American country music singer Sara Evans. It was released in August 2003 via RCA Records Nashville. It has been certified platinum by the RIAA.

The album&#x27;s first single, &quot;Backseat of a Greyhound Bus&quot;, reached number 16 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Country Songs chart. Despite the rather low chart performance of the first single, the album debuted at number 3 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top Country Albums chart and at number 20 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart after selling 44,283 copies in its first week. The album&#x27;s second single, &quot;Perfect&quot;, fared better and reached number 2. &quot;Suds in the Bucket&quot;, the third single, became a signature song for Evans, having reached number one on the country charts, making &quot;Restless&quot; her third consecutive album to contain a number one single. The fourth single, &quot;Tonight&quot;, charted just outside the country Top 40 at number 41.

<doc id="926565" wikidata="Q866206" url="?curid=926565" title="Russian Roulette (game show)">
<text>Russian Roulette is an American game show created and executive produced by Gunnar Wetterberg that ran for two seasons on Game Show Network from June 3, 2002, to June 13, 2003. The show was hosted by Mark L. Walberg (excluding the April Fool&#x27;s Day episode that was hosted by Todd Newton) and announced by Burton Richardson.

==Gameplay==
The &quot;Russian Roulette&quot; set consists of a circle with six trapdoors (referred to as &quot;zones&quot; by the host). Four consecutive positions are occupied by the contestants, each of whom has a slot-machine handle within easy reach. Throughout the game, zones are lit in blue or red to designate them as &quot;safe&quot; or &quot;drop&quot; zones, respectively. The first question of each round is played with one drop zone, and another zone is added on each subsequent question to a maximum of five.

Contestants are given $150 each at the start of the game.

===First round===
One contestant is randomly chosen as the first challenger and asked a question, then must choose one opponent to answer it. That opponent is then given three answer choices and has 10 seconds to respond. A right answer awards $150 and makes them the challenger for the next question. However, a wrong answer or failure to respond in time forfeits all their money to the challenger and forces them to play Russian Roulette to determine whether they stay in the game. The opponent pulls the handle at their position to spin the arrangement of safe/drop zones around the six trapdoors. If a safe zone lands at the opponent&#x27;s position, they become the challenger for the next question; if a drop zone lands at their position, they are eliminated and the trapdoor opens, allowing them to fall through the stage and out of sight.

The round ends when one contestant has been eliminated or time runs out, whichever occurs first. In the latter case, if one contestant is in the lead alone, they step off their zone and pull a handle at center stage to spin one drop zone among the other three contestants and eliminate one of them. If there is a tie for the lead, all four contestants are in danger and the host pulls the handle. The eliminated contestant&#x27;s money (if any) is evenly divided among the other three.

===Second and third rounds===
The second round is played similarly to the first, with the three remaining contestants answering questions that have four answer choices and are worth $200 each. The high scorer from the first round becomes the first challenger; in case of a tie, a random draw decides who will start.

The third round follows the same rules as the second, with questions now worth $300 (season 1) or $250 (season 2). Now, however, the challenger may either pass a question to the opponent or try to answer it directly. The last contestant standing keeps their money and advances to the bonus round; if time runs out, the low scorer forfeits their money to the high scorer and is automatically eliminated. Ties are broken as in the first two rounds.

=== Bonus round ===
The champion has 60 seconds to answer a set of questions, with one drop zone opening at the end of every 10 seconds, starting with the one to the champion&#x27;s left and proceeding clockwise. They may pass a question and return to it after playing through all others if time permits, but drop immediately on a wrong answer or if time runs out. Money is awarded for each correct answer given before the champion drops.

The number, type, and value of questions are as follows.

* &quot;Season 1:&quot; Five brain-teasers are asked, involving challenges such as math problems, unscrambling or anagramming words, and general-knowledge questions. The clock begins to run as soon as the host begins to ask the first question, and the champion may think aloud but must say &quot;My answer is...&quot; before responding. Each right answer awards $500.
* &quot;Season 2:&quot; Ten multiple-choice questions are asked, each with three similar-sounding choices. The clock begins to run after the host finishes asking the first question. The contestant is no longer required to say &quot;My answer is...&quot; in this part of the round. Each right answer awards $300.

Correctly answering all questions before time runs out increases the champion&#x27;s bonus round winnings to $10,000. They may either stop playing at this point and keep all winnings, or give up the $10,000 and play one final round of Russian Roulette, using the number of drop zones that opened during the question round. If a drop zone lands at the champion&#x27;s position, they drop with no further winnings; if a safe zone lands at their position, they win $100,000. Three contestants won this top prize over the entire run of the series.

The champion&#x27;s main-game winnings are not at risk, and any money won in the bonus round is in addition to this total.

==International versions==
On all versions of &quot;Russian Roulette&quot; outside of the U.S., the UK, Argentina, Portugal, and Poland (in season two), there are also displays of the contestants&#x27; heart rates on the screen (examples include Russia&#x27;s, Poland&#x27;s (season one), and Hong Kong&#x27;s versions), and most versions even have the contestants themselves asking questions to their opponents. There is also a camera underneath each of the trapdoors to catch footage of the contestant dropping from another angle. Some may also have a maximum time limit of 15 seconds instead of 10 to answer questions. The Polish version has 30 seconds to answer the question in season one and 20 seconds in season two. Most versions of the show (except for the versions in the U.S., Greece, Taiwan and India) run for an hour rather than a half-hour. As of 2013, there are no versions of the show still in production internationally. However, China&#x27;s regional broadcaster Shandong TV revived the show in the Spring of 2015 as a substitute for the previous edition using the format of &quot;The Million Pound Drop&quot;. This version uses a slightly different format – the daily prize fund always starts at RMB¥50,000, and each correct answer before the final round adds RMB¥1,000 to the final pot. The Chinese version is broadcast live on weekdays and runs for 65 minutes (including commercials).

<text>Philip Syng Physick (July 7, 1768 – December 15, 1837) was an American physician and professor born in Philadelphia. He was the first professor of surgery and later of anatomy at the University of Pennsylvania medical school from 1805 to 1831 during which time he was a highly influential teacher. Physick invented a number of surgical devices and techniques including the stomach tube and absorbable sutures. He has been called the &quot;Father of American Surgery.&quot;

==Life and career==

Physick was born in Philadelphia on July 7, 1768, to Edmund Physick and Abigail Syng. Edmund was a businessman and receiver general of Pennsylvania who was a close friend of the Penn family and Keeper of the Great Seal. Abigail&#x27;s father, Philip Syng was a silversmith. 

Physick was educated at the Friend&#x27;s Public School where he studied under Robert Stroud. He graduated from the University of Pennsylvania in 1785, then began the study of medicine under Adam Kuhn, and continued it in London under John Hunter, learning anatomy through cadaver dissections, becoming, on January 1, 1790, house surgeon of St. George&#x27;s hospital. Physick&#x27;s skill in dissection made him a favorite student of Hunter.

In 1791, he received his license from the Royal College of Surgeons in London, and was invited by Hunter to assist him in his professional practice, but after a few months went to the University of Edinburgh, where he received his degree in medicine in 1792.

He returned to Philadelphia to practice, taking a position at Pennsylvania Hospital. One of the foremost surgeons of the time, Physick was among the few doctors who remained in the city to care for the sick during Philadelphia&#x27;s decimating Yellow Fever Epidemic of 1793. In 1795, Physick performed the first human blood transfusion, though he did not publish the information.

In 1802, Physick was elected a member of the American Philosophical Society, in Philadelphia.

Physick pioneered the use of the stomach pump, used autopsy as a regular means of observation and discovery, excelled in cataract surgery, and was responsible for the design of a number of surgical instruments, such as the needle forceps, the guillotine/snare for performing tonsillectomies, and improved splints and traction devices for treatment of dislocations; he also innovated many operative techniques.

Physick was the first in Western medicine to introduce cataract extraction by aspiration of lens material by applying suction to a tube in 1815.

Physick was also one of the most sought-after medical lecturers of the 19th century. His lectures prepared a generation of surgeons for service throughout America. It is because of his status as a teacher that he was dubbed the &quot;Father of American Surgery&quot;. 

His many patients included James Madison&#x27;s wife, Dolley Madison, Chief Justice John Marshall (from whom he removed more than 1,000 kidney stones, effecting a complete cure), Benjamin Rush, and Judge John Faucheraud Grimké, father of the Grimké sisters. When President Andrew Jackson consulted with Physick about his lung hemorrhages, he was told to stop smoking.

Physick married Elizabeth daughter of Quaker preacher Samuel Emlen in 1800 and they had seven children before they separated in 1815. Physick pursued wealth and had an income of $20,000 a year () and invested nearly all his surplus wealth in real estate, which at the time of his death was valued at half a million dollars ().

==Death and interment==
Physick died in Philadelphia and was interred at Christ Church Burial Ground. His nephew John Syn Dorsey made use of Physick&#x27;s case histories to publish &quot;Elements of Surgery&quot; (1813).

<doc id="926570" wikidata="Q2545208" url="?curid=926570" title="Ward Hunt">
<text>Ward Hunt (June 14, 1810 – March 24, 1886) was an American jurist and politician. He was Chief Judge of the New York Court of Appeals from 1868 to 1869, and an associate justice of the U.S. Supreme Court from 1872 to 1882.

==Early life==
Hunt was the son of Montgomery James Hunt (d. 1871), long-time cashier of the Bank of Utica, and Elizabeth (née Stringham) Hunt. He was a classmate of Horatio Seymour at the Oxford and Geneva Academies, and graduated from Union College in 1828, where he was an early member of the Kappa Alpha Society. Then he studied law with Judge James Gould at Litchfield Law School in Litchfield, Connecticut and with Hiram Denio in Utica, and was admitted to the bar in 1831.

==Career==
He was a Democratic member from Oneida County of the New York State Assembly in 1839, and was Mayor of Utica in 1844. In 1848, he joined the Free Soil Party, and in 1855 he was among the founders of the New York Republican Party.

Hunt remained in private practice until 1865, when he was elected to an eight-year term on the New York Court of Appeals on the Republican ticket, to succeed to the seat held by his former law teacher and partner Hiram Denio. Hunt became chief judge in 1868 after the sudden death of Chief Judge William B. Wright. In 1870, he was legislated out of office but was appointed one of the Commissioners of Appeals.

===U.S. Supreme Court===

Hunt was a friend and patron of political boss Roscoe Conkling, who was an associate of President Ulysses S. Grant. When Samuel Nelson retired from the Supreme Court, Conkling asked Grant to nominate Hunt for the vacancy. Hunt was nominated on December 3, 1872, confirmed by the U.S. Senate on December 11, and was sworn into office on January 9, 1873.

Hunt had little impact on the court, siding with the majority in all but 22 cases in his ten years on the job and writing only four dissenting opinions. His most notable contribution came while riding circuit in New York, where he presided over &quot;United States v. Anthony&quot;. Citing the 14th Amendment, Susan B. Anthony argued that she was constitutionally guaranteed the right to vote and had not broken the law when she voted in the 1872 election. Justice Hunt refused to allow Anthony to testify on her own behalf, allowed statements given by her at the time of her arrest to be allowed as &quot;testimony,&quot; explicitly ordered the jury to return a guilty verdict, refused to poll the jury afterwards, and read an opinion he had written before the trial even started. Hunt found that Anthony had indeed broken the law and fined Anthony $100 (which she refused to pay).

In 1878, Hunt suffered a severe paralyzing stroke, which prevented him from attending court sessions or rendering opinions. Nonetheless, he did not retire, because at the time in order to retire with a full pension a person had to put in at least ten years of government service and be at least 70 years old. To encourage him to retire, Congress passed a special provision under which he could receive a pension if he would retire within 30 days. Hunt did so on January 27, 1882, and enjoyed his pension until his death in Washington, D.C., four years later.

==Personal life==
On November 8, 1837, Hunt was married to Mary Ann Savage (1819–1846), the daughter of U.S. Representative and chief justice of the New York Supreme Court John Savage, and great-niece of Congressman Samuel Lyman. They had three children, one of whom died in early manhood. Together they were the parents of:

* Elizabeth Stringham &quot;Eliza&quot; Hunt (1838-1905), who married Arthur Breese Johnson (1829–1883). Johnson was the great-grandson of Second President of the United States John Adams and great-nephew of Sixth President of the United States John Quincy Adams. They had six children:
** Ward Hunt Johnson (1864-1937); named after Ward himself
** Mary Savage Johnson (1866-1951); named after Ward&#x27;s first wife
** Laura Savage Johnson (1870-1933)
** Montgomery Hunt Johnson (1872-1952); named after Ward&#x27;s father
** Louise Eliza Johnson (1873-1875)
** Leon Arthur Johnson (1877-1909)
* John Savage Hunt (1839-1864), who was named after Mary&#x27;s father; served as a first lieutenant in the United States Civil War and died after drowning in the James River in Virginia.
* Ward Hunt, Jr. (1843-1901), who married Grace Annette Taylor (1844-1928)
** John Savage Hunt (1866-1911); named after his uncle

After his wife&#x27;s death, he remained a widower for eight years until June 18, 1853, when he married Maria Taylor (1827-1912), the daughter of James Taylor, the former Cashier of the Commercial Bank of Albany.

Hunt died on March 24, 1886, in Washington, D.C. He was buried at the Forest Hill Cemetery in Utica.

<doc id="926575" wikidata="Q2271175" url="?curid=926575" title="Longships, Cornwall">
<text>The Longships is the name given to a group of rocky islets situated approximately 1 miles (2 km) west of Land&#x27;s End, Cornwall, England, United Kingdom. The islets are marked by the Longships Lighthouse, the current structure being first lit in December 1873. The islets are very popular for recreational diving, the sea has clear water with prolific marine life and flora.

==Geography==
The Longships lie off the granite headland of Land&#x27;s End and the contact area between the granite pluton and the ″country rocks″ is just offshore. The reef is within a metamorphic aureole formed after the granite intruded the earlier Devonian rocks between 268 and 275 million years ago, during the Permian period.

Much of the Longship group is submerged at high water but the three largest islets in the group – Tal-y-Maen, Carn Bras, and Meinek – remain above the high water mark. Two smaller rocks known as Kettle&#x27;s Bottom are situated midway between Longship and the coast. The Longships islets (but not Kettle&#x27;s Bottom rocks) are in the civil parish of Sennen.

===Names of the rocks===
The names of the rocks that make up the reef have meanings in the Cornish language.

*Cein (Cornish: Keyn, meaning &quot;back, ridge, or keel&quot;)
*Farkell Carn (Cornish: Karn Forhel, meaning &quot;forked rock-pile&quot;)
*Tal-y-maen (Cornish: Tal an Meyn, meaning &quot;brow of the stones&quot;)
*Carn Bras (Cornish: Karn Bras, meaning &quot;big rock-pile&quot;)
*Herly (Cornish: Hir Legh, meaning &quot;long ledge&quot;)
*Plassek (Cornish: Plosek, meaning &quot;foul one&quot;)
*Meinek (Cornish: Meynek, meaning &quot;stony place&quot;)

==Shipwrecks==

It is not known how many ships have been lost in and around Land&#x27;s End but there are hundreds recorded and probably thousands unknown. One of the earliest recorded on the Longships, is an unidentified ship lost at the Long Shipps in 1532 reported by the bayliffe John Penheleg. Other wrecks include:

* 1898: S.S. Bluejacket,
* 1901, November: &#x27;Mary James.&#x27; Built 1862 by Richard Tredwen in Padstow. For most of her life owned by the St. Just family of Harvey James and made many voyages to Wales with copper ore, bringing back coal for the mines. Sank after dismasting.

<text>Courtney Babcock-Key (born June 30, 1972) is a Canadian coach and competitor in the sport of running. Babcock holds the Canadian Women&#x27;s 5000m(14:54.96) and formerly held the 10,000m records both set during the 2003 season. She broke the Canadian 5000m record in the final of the 2003 World Track and Field IAAF Championships in Paris, where she finished in eighth place, securing her a spot for the 2004 Olympic Games. Her 1500m time of 4:01.99 was also a top time in the World that year. She is a five-time national champion. Two times in each the 5000m and 10,000m and once in Cross Country.

Born and raised in Chatham, Ontario Babcock trained in the United States. Her father was Larry Babcock a hockey player who was drafted by the Montreal Canadiens. Larry died in 2007. In high school, she was more interested in swimming and basketball, but moved to running in her final year while attending the Bishop Strachan School in Toronto. A full-time athlete for 13 years, she attended the University of Michigan where she competed successfully in the NCAA. She was an NCAA Champion in the Distance Medley Relay anchoring the team to its first win in 1994 and an 8x All American. At school she studied communication and broadcasting and hopes to move into that field upon retirement from running.

Today Babcock lives and trains in Missoula, Montana. A middle-distance runner, she competed for Canada for almost 10 years. 2004 was a more difficult year due to injury problems and a bout of bronchitis. At the 2004 Summer Olympics she failed to pass the qualifying round in the 5,000 meter race with a time well off her personal best. In the 1500 meter she also failed to advance finishing 26th; only the top twenty-four moved on.

She was inducted into the Michigan Women&#x27;s Track and Field Hall of Fame in 2004.

She coached at the Division 1 level for five years with the University of Montana. In that time, Montana won its first Women&#x27;s Cross Country Big Sky Championship title in 24 years. She led two athletes to the top 10 in the NCAA in the 1500m and the 3k steeplechase.

==Personal life==
She currently owns her own run coaching business, Key Running, named after her husband Miles Key. They have two sons.

<doc id="926595" wikidata="Q1046725" url="?curid=926595" title="Rose-painting">
<text>Rose-painting, &#x27;, &#x27; or &#x27; is a Scandinavian decorative folk painting that flourished from the 1700s to the mid-1800s, particularly in Norway. In Sweden, rose-painting began to be called &#x27;, c. 1901, for the region Dalecarlia where it had been most popular, and , in the 1920s, for a characteristic trait, but in Norway the old name still predominates beside terms for local variants. Rose-painting was used to decorate church walls and ceilings. It then spread to wooden items commonly used in daily life, such as ale bowls, stools, chairs, cupboards, boxes, and trunks. Using stylized ornamentation made up of fantasy flowers, scrollwork, fine line work, flowing patterns and sometimes geometric elements give rose-painting its unique feel. Some paintings may include landscapes and architectural elements. Rose-painting also utilizes other decorative painting techniques such as glazing, spattering, marbleizing, manipulating the paint with the fingers or other objects. Regional styles of rose-painting developed, and some varied only slightly from others, while others may be noticeably distinct.

==Etymology and terminology==
The term derives from , applied decoration or embellishment, decorative, decorated [, , , ] and , to paint. The first element can also be interpreted as a reference to the rose flower, but the floral elements are often so stylized that no specific flower is identifiable, and are absent in some designs.

In Sweden the style was traditionally called &quot;rosmålning&quot;, with cupboard decorations said to be &quot;utkrusat i rosmålning&quot; or &quot;krusmålning&quot;. In the 20th century the terms or and came into common use. &quot;Dalamålning&quot; refers to Dalarna, with which the style is particularly associated; the term appeared around 1901. &quot;Kurbits&quot; originally derived from the Latin &quot;Cucurbita&quot;, and refers to a long-bodied gourd. The poet Erik Axel Karlfeldt, who wrote about the painted wall hangings of Dalarna, popularized the term in the 1920s, particularly in his 1927 poem &quot;Kurbitsmålning&quot;.

==History in Norway==

Rosemaling in Norway originated in the lowland and rural areas of eastern Norway, particularly in the Telemark, Valdres, Hallingdal, Numedal, Setesdal, Gudbrandsdalen, and in other valleys in Vest-Agder, Hordaland, Sogn og Fjordane, and Rogaland. It came into existence in the early 1700s, when Baroque and Rococo artistic styles of the upper class were introduced into Norway&#x27;s rural culture. Since no rose-paintings can be traced back before this time, there is an indication that folk traditions within Norway went through a period of change and evolution. Once developed, regional styles of rosemaling began to emerge. Some varied only slightly from others, while others were noticeably distinct. In the middle of the 18th century, more and more individuals became painters and carvers. Due to this, rosemaling styles boomed to include even more unique forms. Rose-painters also began to initial their work as a way to identify the pieces they created. Through this, historians have been more easily able to gauge how many pieces certain artists have done, and even identify dynasties of painters through family relation. Rosemaling&#x27;s popularity, however, declined by the mid-19th century.

Rosemaling designs use C- and S-shaped brushstrokes that feature scroll and flowing lines, floral designs, and both subtle and vibrant colors. Script lettering, scenes, animal and human figures may also be included. For instance, when Norway was still ruled by the Danes, some artists would create rose-paintings of the Danish King and Queen or of Danish warriors. Artists who specialized in rosemaling often came from poorer classes in the countryside. They would travel from county to county painting churches, homes and furnishings for a commission of either money or merely room and board. Thus rosemaling was carried over the mountains and toward Norway&#x27;s western coast. Once farther away from the influence of the painters&#x27; guild, these artists tried new ideas and motifs. Rosemaling became widespread as amateur artists in rural areas often imitated this folk art. Soon, strong regional styles developed, and today the three main styles are Telemark, Hallingdal and Rogaland, named after the regions in which each originated.

Rosemaling is, in a sense, the two-dimensional counterpart of acanthus carving, since it is clear that the C and S curves in rosemaling take their inspiration from the acanthus carvings of Baroque and Rococo art and the acanthus carvings in rural churches (for example the altar reredoses and pulpits) and homes (for example cupboards) were painted in the same bright colors as used in rosemaling. While in the cities these acanthus carvings were generally gilded, the rural artisans did not have ready access to gold leaf as their urban counterparts and so painted their carvings in the bright colors whose popularity in rural communities is seen also in the traditional Norwegian rural dress, the &quot;bunad&quot;. Like rosemaling, acanthus carving has had a cultural revival in recent times as both a means of interior design (for example, on furniture, picture frames, and door and window frames) and as a personal hobby, although most modern acanthus carving is left unpainted and unvarnished.

An anecdote about the Nazi occupation of Norway (1940–1945) is that at a time when the public display of the Norwegian flag or the State Coat of Arms could bring imprisonment or even death, the Norwegians discovered that they could display the &#x27;H&#x27; overlapping the &#x27;7&#x27; of the Royal cypher of their exiled king, Haakon VII, at the center of a rosemaling design without the German occupation forces seeing anything but a colorful peasant design. Christmas cards with the Royal cypher at the center of a rosemaling design were especially popular; many have survived and their history documented. 

Currently, this specific type of folk art is becoming popularized in a more mobile way. Back in the 1700s when the first piece of rose-painting was done in Norway, it was only visible in remote locations such as inside homes and churches. Now, however, rose-painting is being executed on bowls, vases, plates, chests, jewelry boxes, and a multitude of furniture items. This expansion in rose-painting has not only allowed it to remain popular, but it has given it the ability to do more than just be seen in museums such as the Norwegian Folk Museum. Many shops in Norwegian tourist cities sell various unique rose-painted items from local at-home artists. They are a must see by not only tourists, but the overall citizens of the cities. At a shop, rose-painted items can be sold for quite an income due to the fact that these items are made the traditional way (hand-painted) rather than industrially processed. Each item is carefully crafted and unique. The process behind these items is quite extensive and can take time. For instance, wood items begin with first applying special oil-based paint or wood stain. This color normally tends to be a deeper blue or red, dusty pink, white, black, or even brown. When the rose-painting is complete, it will be sold based on its intricacy and size of design. Something as simple as a large bread tray can be sold for as much as 240 dollars.

In terms of the design of current rose-paintings, it holds much similarities to past rose-paintings in Norway. Since rosemaling in Norway simply means &quot;decorative painting,&quot; there are still many other designs besides floral or rose depictions. It can involve agricultural landscapes, scenes from historical events, life in the rural or countryside areas, and more. Some even are known for depicting scenes from children&#x27;s stories or fairytales. One of the most commonly rose-painted children&#x27;s story is &quot;Little Red Riding Hood.&quot; Furthermore, more and more styles have since emerged after the most famous Telemark, Hallingdal, and Rogaland styles.

While shops and museums will most likely contain rose-paintings from all areas of Norway, rose-painting is currently most prominent in the southern parts of Norway. In specific, the regions Telemark and Hallingdal are booming with this folk art. Regardless of being most popular in the southern region of Norway, however, the rose-paintings still do vary quite decently from city to city. This is why the styles have always been regionalized and regionally named. For instance, Telemark tends to produce rose-painting with a more exaggerated and ornate style. It follows an 18th-century French influence and inspiration. Hallingdal, on the other hand, produces its own style of work. These artists, unlike many others, tend to prefer selling their work privately rather than within shops.

Overall, rose-painting in Norway is something that has become partially industrialized. Individuals can buy rose-painted items from commercial stores and industries for a cheaper price. Industrialized rose-painting started back when the interiors of homes began to become more modernized. Certain items, such as the invention of chimneys, made Norwegians feel the need to decorate more parts of their home. This led to the expansion of rose-paintings and an industrialized version that was more accessible and economically affordable for everyday citizens. However, that is also why individuals who buy rose-painted items from tourist shops and private artists must be willing to pay a higher price; they are buying a traditionally made item. These hand-crafted goods are just as important as the industrialized goods because they help to maintain the Norwegian culture of rosemaling and keep it from fully disappearing. Norwegians view rosemaling as a way to keep a shared identity and culture among their entire nation. This is why certain places to this day, such has the Nordic Museum and Chicago Public Library, display a multitude of rose-paintings.

==History in Sweden==
In Sweden, it is a style of painting featuring light brush strokes and depictions of gourds, leaves, and flowers, used especially in the decoration of furniture and wall hangings, and was adopted by both artists and artisans in rural Sweden, reaching its greatest popularity in the latter half of the 18th century. While rose painting was popular among the entire nation, lots of times the houses of more wealthy individuals had more rose paintings as they were able to afford more decorations. In addition, the major popularity of rose painting in Sweden occurred before the industrialization period. After industrialization, it did not disappear due to the fact that the art created during this period was recognized as a major part of Sweden&#x27;s folk culture and heritage.
The tradition of painted wall hangings in this style was fully developed around 1820. The paintings were done by itinerant painters, most from Dalarna, whose signatures can be found in many localities. The artists learned it as a trade or handicraft from one another, and copied each other&#x27;s works; some pieces have been found copied more than 140 times. Artists also used stamps to create small details in patterns. Those from the Rättvik school of art were more likely to add spontaneous leaves and flowers, breaking up the symmetry of their pieces. Many of the paintings also included a zig-zag pattern at the bottom of the painting, called &quot;ullvibården&quot; after the village of . Scenes were based on Bible illustrations, with people and buildings rendered in the then current styles. The gourds reference a Biblical legend about Jonah sitting beneath a gourd; the gourd symbolizes vegetal fertility. The most common themes of kurbit art are the wedding at Cana, Jonah preaching, the entry of the Queen of Sheba, the three wise men, Jesus riding into Jerusalem, the story of Joseph, the ten virgins, the crowning of Salomon, and the vineyard.

The style is widely found in the regions of Dalarna and southern Norrland, and today &quot;kurbits&quot; can refer to the painting of furniture, tapestry, Dala horses, or Swedish folk painting as a general concept. On the Dala horse, a gourd is used to indicate the saddle.

Kurbits artists include Winter Carl Hansson of Yttermo and Back Olof Andersson, who painted in 1790–1810. 

The kurbits style was used in the candidate city logo of the Stockholm-Åre bid for the 2026 Winter Olympics, forming the year &quot;2026&quot;.

==History in America==
Norwegian immigrants brought the art of rosemaling to the United States. Immigration from Norway to America first began in the 1830s. It is not surprising this specific form of folk art was brought to America by Norwegian immigrants since it was not just used for decoration and aesthetic purposes in Norway, but also for self-definition. Rosemaling was a way for Norwegian-Americans to keep a hold of some of their heritage. During this time period of immigration, immigrants did just that, and they maintained a strong ethnic identity both privately and publicly. They might have specific traditions within their homes, participate in ethnic festivals, and more. Rose paintings were often displayed in these festivals. In addition, lots of immigrants traveling from Norway to the Midwest regions of America would actually create rose paintings in churches on their travel to make some money. These rose paintings done by travelers helped expand the variation of styles among rose paintings.

The art form experienced a revival in the 20th century as Norwegian-Americans became interested in the rosemaling-decorated possessions of their ancestors. Rosemaling artists whose work was recognized by newspapers and magazines allowed the art form to be further recognized and grow. One prominent rosemaling artist Per Lysne, who was born in Norway and emigrated to Wisconsin, was trained in the craft. Lysne is often considered the father of rosemaling in the U.S. As the revival continued on, it reached its peak in the 1960s to the 1980s. In the late 1960s, Vesterheim Norwegian-American Museum in Decorah, Iowa began to exhibit rosemaling. The museum then began bringing Norwegian rosemalers to the U.S. to hold classes. The style&#x27;s popularity boomed in the U.S., even among non-Norwegians. Other classes can be found throughout the country, especially in areas where Norwegians settled.

The Swedish settlement of Lindsborg, Kansas is known for Dala horses among other celebrations of its heritage.

Currently, rose painting is still most common in the Upper Midwest. This is due to the fact that when Norwegians most heavily migrated between the 1840s and 1910s, they ended up living in the Upper Midwest. In addition, the Norwegian-American Museum is still offering workshops on rosemaling. Besides workshops, rosemaling can also be taught through books, classes, and heritage centers. This is very valuable as it offers more ways for Norwegian-Americans (and other Americans) to pass on rosemaling skills and traditions to future generations.

To this day, there is now a decent amount of Norwegian-Americans from the Upper Midwest who have taken on rose painting, causing some of their styles to be considered &quot;Americanized.&quot; Rather than being seen as a piece of Norwegian heritage, it is seen as a piece of Upper Midwest communities. Some rosemaling styles have been &quot;Americanized&quot; beginning between 1930 and 1960. Compared to traditional styles, often they included brighter colors, special ornamental details, and more. Dane County, Wisconsin, which developed a style known as American Rogaland and American Telemark style found in Milan, Minnesota.

== Styles ==
There are many different styles of rosemaling. Typically, each style is named after the region it is most commonly used in. To begin, the first style that has gained major popularity is the Telemark style. This style is extremely popular in Norway, and it is very impromptu. It normally involves a root center that has floral depictions or branches swirling out from it. Within the Telemark style, there are also two other styles. The transparent Telemark, which has light enough brush strokes to almost be seen through, and the American Telemark, which is a combination of both the regular Telemark style and the transparent Telemark style. Another popular style in Norway is Hallingdal. Hallingdal is different from Telemark in that the paint is often less translucent and more bold in color. In addition, it has much more symmetry and pattern to it. In addition to these, the Rogaland style also has some popularity. This style consists of more floral images than lines or scrolls. It often will have a darker background with a central flower surrounded by leaves and other decorations. While those three forms are popular, there still are other forms as well. For instance, another style is the Valdres style. The Valdres style is one that has some of the most realistic looking floral designs.

<text>The Presentation of the Blessed Virgin Mary, known in the East as The Entry of the Most Holy [[Theotokos]] into the Temple, is a liturgical feast celebrated on November 21 by the Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, and some Anglo-Catholic Churches.

The feast is associated with an event recounted not in the New Testament, but in the apocryphal Protoevangelium of James. According to that text, Mary&#x27;s parents, Joachim and Anne, who had been childless, received a heavenly message that they would have a child. In thanksgiving for the gift of their daughter, they brought her, when still a child, to the Temple in Jerusalem to consecrate her to God. Later versions of the story (such as the Gospel of Pseudo-Matthew and the Gospel of the Nativity of Mary) indicate that Mary was taken to the Temple at around the age of three in fulfillment of a vow. Tradition held that she was to remain there to be educated in preparation for her role as Mother of God.

In the Eastern Orthodox tradition, this is one of the days when women named Mary ( in Greek) and Despoina () celebrate their name day.

==Story==

The account of the Presentation of the Blessed Virgin Mary in the Temple is principally based on the Protoevangelium of James, which has been dated by historians prior to the year 200 AD. The story relates that in thanksgiving for the birth of their daughter Mary, Joachim and Anne decide to consecrate her to God, and bring her, at the age of three years, to the temple in Jerusalem. Mary&#x27;s presentation in the temple draws parallels to that of the prophet Samuel, whose mother Hannah, like Anne, was also thought to be barren, and who offered her child as a gift to God at Shiloh.

Mary remained in the Temple until her twelfth year, at which point Joseph was assigned to be her guardian. According to Coptic tradition, her father Joachim died when Mary was six years old and her mother when Mary was eight.

&quot;This story is a legend with no foundation in history and the point of the story is to show that even in her childhood Mary was completely dedicated to God. However, it is from this very account that arose the feast of Mary&#x27;s Presentation.&quot;

==Feast day==

The feast originated as a result of the dedication of the New Church of the Theotokos, built in 543 by the Byzantines under Emperor Justinian I near the site of the ruined Temple in Jerusalem. This basilica was destroyed by the Sasanian Persians under Khosrow II after the Siege of Jerusalem (614). The first documented celebration of the feast in any calendar is the mention of the &quot;Εἴσοδος τῆς Παναγίας Θεοτόκου&quot; (Entry of the All-Holy Theotokos, i.e., into the Temple) in the &quot;Menologion of Basil II&quot;, an 11th-century menology of the Eastern Roman (also known as Byzantine) emperor Basil II.

The feast continued to be celebrated throughout the East, was celebrated in the monasteries of Southern Italy by the ninth century, and was introduced into the Papal Chapel in Avignon in 1372 by decree of Pope Gregory XI. The feast was included in the Roman Missal in 1472, but was suppressed by Pope Pius V in 1568. As a result, it did not appear in the Tridentine calendar. Pope Sixtus V reintroduced it into the Roman calendar in 1585. Pope Clement VIII made this feast a greater double in 1597. The feast also continued as a memorial in the Roman calendar of 1969.

==Liturgical celebration==
The Eastern Orthodox Church celebrates it on November 21 as one of its twelve Great Feasts. For those churches which follow the Julian calendar, November 21 falls on December 4 of the modern Gregorian calendar. In the Orthodox Church the feast always falls during the Nativity Fast, and on the day of the feast the fasting rules are lessened somewhat so that fish, wine, and oil may be eaten.

For the Roman Catholic Church, on the day of the Presentation of the Blessed Virgin Mary, &quot;we celebrate that dedication of herself which Mary made to God from her very childhood under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit who filled her with grace ... .&quot; In the 1974 encyclical &quot;Marialis Cultus&quot;, Pope Paul VI wrote that &quot;despite its apocryphal content, it presents lofty and exemplary values and carries on the venerable traditions having their origins in the Eastern churches&quot;.

The three feasts of the Birthday of Our Lady, the Holy Name of Mary, and her Presentation in the Temple correspond in the Marian cycle with the first three feasts of the cycle of feasts of Jesus: namely, Christmas, the Holy Name of Jesus, and His Presentation at the Temple. November 21 is also a &quot;Pro Orantibus&quot; Day, a day of prayer for cloistered religious &quot;totally dedicated to God in prayer, silence, and concealment&quot;.

==Legacy==

During the World Youth Day in July 2016, Pope Francis paid a private morning visit to the Convent of the Sisters of the Presentation (lat. ), founded in 1627 in Kraków as the first Polish active Religious institute.

St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica contains the (Presentation Chapel); the altar is dedicated to St. Pius X.

The Presentation of the Virgin Mary Orthodox Monastery was located in Marshfield, Missouri, before the nuns relocated to Holy Archangel Michael and All Angels Skete in Weatherby, Missouri.

The Presentation Sisters, also known as the Sisters of the Presentation of the Blessed Virgin Mary (PBVM for short), a religious institute of Roman Catholic women, was founded in Cork, Ireland, by Honora (Nano) Nagle in 1775.

The congregation of the Sisters of the Presentation of Mary, dedicated to the education of youth, was founded November 21, 1796, in Thueyts, France, by Anne-Marie Rivier.

The Sisters of Mary of the Presentation is a Catholic religious institute founded in 1828 in Broons, France, known for schools and hospitals in Europe, Africa, and North America.

==In art==
Western depictions of the subject usually focus on the lone figure of the child Mary climbing the steep steps of the Temple. Having left her parents at the bottom, she is to be received by the High Priest and other Temple officials waiting at the top of the steps. Orthodox images of the event may include a procession of virgins headed by Mary.

The Presentation is one of the usual scenes in larger cycles of the Life of the Virgin, although it is not usually one of the scenes shown in a Book of Hours. One of the most important illustrations of this event is Pietro Testa&#x27;s famous painting.

<doc id="926601" wikidata="Q164785" url="?curid=926601" title="Cinnamic acid">
<text>Cinnamic acid is an organic compound with the formula C6H5-CH=CH-COOH. It is a white crystalline compound that is slightly soluble in water, and freely soluble in many organic solvents. Classified as an unsaturated carboxylic acid, it occurs naturally in a number of plants. It exists as both a &quot;cis&quot; and a &quot;trans&quot; isomer, although the latter is more common.

==Occurrence and production==
===Biosynthesis===
Cinnamic acid is a central intermediate in the biosynthesis of a myriad of natural products including lignols (precursors to lignin and lignocellulose), flavonoids, isoflavonoids, coumarins, aurones, stilbenes, catechin, and phenylpropanoids. Its biosynthesis involves the action of the enzyme phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) on phenylalanine.

===Natural occurrence===
It is obtained from oil of cinnamon, or from balsams such as storax. It is also found in shea butter. Cinnamic acid has a honey-like odor; and its more volatile ethyl ester, ethyl cinnamate, is a flavor component in the essential oil of cinnamon, in which related cinnamaldehyde is the major constituent. It is also found in wood from many diverse tree species.

===Synthesis===
Cinnamic acid was first synthesized by the base-catalysed condensation of acetyl chloride and benzaldehyde, followed by hydrolysis of the acid chloride product. In 1890, Rainer Ludwig Claisen described the synthesis of ethyl cinnamate via the reaction of ethyl acetate with benzaldehyde in the presence of sodium as base. Another way of preparing cinnamic acid is by the Knoevenagel condensation reaction. The reactants for this are benzaldehyde and malonic acid in the presence of a weak base, followed by acid-catalyzed decarboxylation. It can also be prepared by oxidation of cinnamaldehyde, condensation of benzal chloride and sodium acetate (followed by acid hydrolysis), and the Perkin reaction. The oldest commercially used route to cinnamic acid involves the Perkin reaction, which is given in the following scheme

==Metabolism==
Cinnamic acid, obtained from autoxidation of cinnamaldehyde, is metabolized into sodium benzoate in the liver.

==Uses==
Cinnamic acid is used in flavorings, synthetic indigo, and certain pharmaceuticals. A major use is as a precursor to produce methyl cinnamate, ethyl cinnamate, and benzyl cinnamate for the perfume industry. Cinnamic acid is a precursor to the sweetener aspartame via enzyme-catalysed amination with phenylalanine. Cinnamic acid can dimerize in non-polar solvents resulting in different linear free energy relationships.

<text>Bullseye is an American game show that aired in syndication from September 29, 1980, to June 25, 1982, with reruns continuing until September 24, 1982. Jim Lange was the host, and the program was produced by Jack Barry and Dan Enright. Jay Stewart was the announcer for the first season, and Charlie O&#x27;Donnell announced for the second season. The series&#x27; executive producer was Ron Greenberg.

==Gameplay==

===Main game===
Two contestants competed, one a returning champion who had initial control of the game. The gameboard consisted of three circular windows arranged in an upside-down triangle. Eight different categories were available per game, four in each of the top two windows, while the bottom window displayed numbers from one to five as well as a bullseye.

The windows were covered up and spun to randomize the contents, and the contestant in control hit a button (with a target on it) on their podium to freeze and reveal them. Each top window displayed a category and a dollar amount from $50 to $200 in increments of $50, and the bottom window indicated the number of questions in a &quot;contract&quot; that had to be completed in order to claim any money. After choosing a category/value pair, the contestant answered one question at a time; each correct response added the value to a pot. The bullseye represented an open-ended contract, which allowed a contestant to continue answering questions as long as he/she desired and stop after any correct response. If a contestant missed a question at any point, the opponent was given a chance to take control of the contract with a right answer; if a bullseye had been spun, the opponent could then either end the contract or take more questions. If both contestants missed the same question, whether on a bullseye or not, it was thrown out and control reverted to the contestant who had originally tried to answer it. Once a contract was completed or ended, the contestant who did so could choose to bank the money in the pot and give up control of the next spin to the opponent, or leave the money in the pot and spin again.

Originally, the first contestant to bank $1,000 or more won the game. During the two-week period of November 24 to December 5, 1980, the same amount won by a champion in the main game would also be donated to a children&#x27;s charity. To ensure the charities would receive more money, the question values were doubled to $100 to $400, with a total of $2,000 or more needed to win, and these increased amounts remained in place for the rest of the series. Later, prior to December 1981, a $500 value was added to the main game.

Contestants kept any money banked during a game, regardless of the outcome, making &quot;Bullseye&quot; one of the few Barry &amp; Enright shows to allow losing contestants to keep winnings from the game.

Since the champion always spun first, it was possible for him/her to win without giving the challenger an opportunity to play. If this happened, the challenger returned to play again in the next game.

As was the case with most Barry &amp; Enright game shows, a contestant won a new car after every fifth victory, and players competed until beaten in the main game.

===Bonus Island===
The champion advanced to play the bonus round, referred to as &quot;Bonus Island.&quot; Once again, he/she hit a button (big enough to use two hands) to stop the spinning windows. For this round, however, the windows contained various dollar amounts ($100–$150–$200 originally, later increased to $100–$200–$300 during the fifth week). All three windows also contained bullseyes, and one contained a lightning bolt.

After each safe spin, any dollar amounts appearing in the windows were added to the pot for this round. Originally, if any bullseyes appeared, the champion had the option to freeze those windows and put them out of play; this option was later removed and any windows showing bullseyes were automatically frozen. The champion could choose to stop at any time and keep the accumulated money, but if the lightning appeared, the round ended and he/she forfeited the money. The location of the lightning was not revealed until after the round was over, so the champion had no way of knowing whether it had been put out of play behind a bullseye.

The champion won a prize package, usually worth between $2,000 and $4,000, by either spinning three bullseyes or surviving a given number of spins (originally ten, later reduced to seven) without finding the lightning. Spinning three bullseyes also awarded double the money in the pot, or $10,000 (originally $5,000) if the champion did so in a single spin. Surviving all spins awarded either $5,000 or all the money in the pot, whichever was greater. Except for the &quot;Celebrity Bullseye&quot; episodes, which did not offer prizes, the same prize package was at stake throughout a particular episode until won.

==Production information==
The show featured a bombastic music package from Barry and Enright&#x27;s in-house music composer Hal Hidey, including a main theme strongly reminiscent of the Santa Esmeralda disco hit &quot;Don&#x27;t Let Me Be Misunderstood,&quot; which had been used itself on the pilot. An eerie sound effect was used while the swirls were in motion, as well as during the window reveals following a bonus round win. The game board itself was run by slide projectors, similar to other game shows such as &quot;The Joker&#x27;s Wild&quot;, &quot;Blockbusters&quot;, and &quot;Press Your Luck&quot;.

&quot;Bullseye&quot; first originated from NBC Studios in Burbank, California, taping in stages 2, 3, and 4 at different times. In 1981, production of &quot;Bullseye&quot; moved to Studio 31 of CBS Television City in Los Angeles, California. Later that same year, production of &quot;Bullseye&quot; was moved to Television City&#x27;s Studio 33; the show briefly returned to Studio 31 in early 1982, but returned to Studio 33 for the remainder of its run.

===&quot;Celebrity Bullseye&quot;===
On December 7, 1981, the show changed its name to &quot;Celebrity Bullseye&quot; and featured celebrity contestants playing for their favorite charities. The celebrities played a best two-out-of-three game. The categories were no longer announced by Lange before the game began and most questions were multiple-choice, containing three possible answers. Otherwise, gameplay was unchanged; the first celebrity to win two games became champion and continued playing until beaten.

Celebrities who played included Daryl Anderson, F. Lee Bailey, Meredith Baxter, Ernest Borgnine, Jim Brown, Jack Coleman, Doug Davidson, Phyllis Diller, Max Gail, Lynda Goodfriend, Shecky Greene, Rosey Grier, Richard Kline, Harvey Korman, Diane Ladd, Gloria Loring, Tina Louise, Jerry Mathers, Rue McClanahan, Brian S. Mitchell, Rita Moreno, Greg Morris, Donna Pescow, Lynn Redgrave, Roxie Roker, Nipsey Russell, Lilibet Stern, Fred Travalena, Patrick Wayne and Jo Anne Worley.

===Episode status===
All episodes exist, with reruns airing on CBN Cable (1982–1984) and USA Network (April 1, 1985 – June 26, 1987) with Game Show Network doing so in more recent years (as recent as November 2007 for a &quot;Viewers&#x27; Choice&quot; marathon).

<text>A lost and found (American English) or lost property (British English), or lost articles (also Canadian English) is an office in a public building or area where people can go to retrieve lost articles that may have been found by others. Frequently found at museums, amusement parks and schools, a lost and found will typically be a clearly marked box or room in a location near the main entrance.

Some lost and found offices will try to contact the owners of any lost items if there are any personal identifiers available. Practically all will either sell, give away, or discard items after a certain period has passed to clear their storage.

==History==
In Japan, the lost-and-found property system dates to a code written in the year 718.
The first modern lost and found office was organized in Paris in 1805. Napoleon ordered his prefect of police to establish it as a central place &quot;to collect all objects found in the streets of Paris&quot;, according to Jean-Michel Ingrandt, who was appointed the office&#x27;s director in 2001. However, it was not until 1893 that Louis Lépine, then prefect of police, organized efforts to actively track down the owners of lost items.

==Organization==

Lost-and-found offices at large organizations can handle a large and varied collection of articles. Transport for London&#x27;s lost property offices (which handle items lost on the city&#x27;s Tube, buses and taxis) handles over 130,000 items a year, including 24,000 bags and 10,000 mobile phones. Among the more peculiar items that have been handed in include a wedding dress, ashes in an urn, a longcase clock, a kitchen sink, and several wheelchairs. In Japan, a combination of infrastructure, laws, and cultural norms result in a very strong lost-and-found system; Tokyo&#x27;s lost-and-found system processes over 4 million items annually.

Other large organizations may lack a central lost-and-found office but have several offices attached to different administrative units. This is the case, for instance, at the University of Illinois, where different campus units have both distinct offices and different unofficial retention and resolution policies (rules for how long to keep items and what to do with them once that period has expired). In addition to such distributed offices, a cross-unit office might also exist; again referring to the University of Illinois, this cross-functional unit rests in the Campus Police (Division of Public Safety).

==Computing==
Some file systems contain a special directory, called &quot;lost+found&quot; under Unix, where a file system check places lost and potentially corrupted files when the correct location cannot be determined, and so requires manual intervention by the user.

<text>The Runnel Stone (, meaning &quot;stone abounding in seals&quot;), or Rundle Stone, is a hazardous rock pinnacle about south of Gwennap Head, Cornwall, England, United Kingdom. It used to show above the surface at low water until a steamship struck it in 1923.

==Marks==
===Current===
====Runnelstone buoy====
A buoy currently marks the position of the Runnel Stone. Until May 2012 it was topped with a flashing light, a bell which peals with the movement of the waves and was also fitted with a whistle set in a tube, which emitted a moaning sound when there was a good swell running. This mournful noise could be heard clearly from Gwennap Head, drifting in from the sea, and added to the eerie atmosphere on the cliffs in foggy conditions. In a gale during the 1960s, the buoy became tangled in a drifting cargo ship&#x27;s anchor line, and the buoy was towed into Mount&#x27;s Bay. On 13 May 2012, the buoy was replaced by THV &quot;Patricia&quot; with a larger one, with a whistle to replace the bell.

====Day markers on Tol-pedn====

On the mainland, there is a pair of cone-shaped navigation markers on Gwennap Head, in line with the Runnel Stone buoy. These are day markers warning vessels of the hazard of the Runnel Stone. The cone to the seaward side is painted red and the inland one is black and white. When at sea the black and white one should always be kept in sight in order to avoid the submerged rocks nearer the shore. If the black and white cone is completely obscured by the red cone then the vessel would be directly on top of the Runnel Stone. The landmark was erected by the Corporation of Trinity House in 1821 – an event recorded on a plaque on the back of the black and white marker.

===Historic===
====Beacons====
In 1795, following numerous petitions from mariners for dangers around Land&#x27;s End to be marked by lights and beacons, Trinity House built a lighthouse on the Longships, and beacons on Wolf Rock and the Rundlestone. The latter, a bare wrought iron pole, was &#x27;soon carried away by the sea&#x27;. In 1841, work began on erecting a replacement beacon (designed by James Walker, chief engineer at Trinity House). The process was one of &#x27;great difficulty and danger&#x27;: only a small portion of the rock protruded from the water, and landing by boat was only ever achievable during spring tides; even then &#x27;the sea was seldom smooth enough to admit of a footing on the rock&#x27;. The beacon was completed on 27 June 1843: a wrought iron mast of diameter standing some above mean high water springs and topped by a ball-shaped top-mark, wide (which had been reduced in size from 6 ft after heavy seas were observed to submerge the top of the mast). In October the following year the beacon was snapped off in a gale, leaving a stump (which was itself carried away, following a ship collision, before repairs could be effected). A replacement, high with a top-mark, was installed the following summer and remained in place until 1854, when it too was carried off in a storm. Another replacement was therefore erected, by James Douglass in the spring of 1856, but it too was destroyed in December that same year. Thereafter the decision was taken to mark the hazard with a buoy.

====Buoys====
There had been previous attempts to attach buoys, with the first led by the naval Lieutenant Hugh Goldsmith (nephew of the famous poet Oliver Goldsmith) aboard the cutter HMS Nimble in 1824. (After several unsuccessful attempts Lt Goldsmith and a number of his crew turned their attention to, and succeeded in toppling the famous rocking stone, Logan Rock from its precarious perch on the Treryn Dinas headland east of Porthcurno, much to the dismay of local people.) Buoys were also placed from time to time in the absence of the beacon.

Douglass designed the first permanent Rundlestone bell buoy following the destruction of his 1856 beacon; it had a ball-shaped top-mark and the bell was struck by four clappers. Various buoys have since been attached, as in December 1880 when the local newspaper (The Cornishman) reported that the Trinity House vessel, &quot;Stella&quot; put into Penzance with about 30 tons of mooring-chain, etc. for the &quot;Sevenstones&quot; Lightship and the Rundlestone buoy. A second buoy was attached in June 1881 with a bell and four large iron balls which ran in grooves. As one side of the buoy was raised by a wave, the movement sent one of the balls against the bell. The buoy and the mooring costs was paid for by the blacksmith who designed it. People living at Tol-pedn and Porthgwarra were asked to listen for the two ″bell-buoys″ as a means to test the new buoy. Another buoy, Sherwell&#x27;s patent bell-buoy, was placed nearby in Autumn 1881 and was substituted for the original bell-buoy in March 1882. The Cornishman newspaper reported in March 1883 that the spherical buoy was removed and replaced with a bell buoy, which was knocked off by a passing vessel sometime around October 1885.

====Other====
When the Longships Lighthouse was rebuilt in the early 1870s, its fixed white light was provided with a pair of red sectors to indicate nearby hazards, one of which was angled towards the Runnel Stone.

==Shipwrecks==
Between 1880 and 1923 over thirty identified steamships were wrecked, stranded or sunk in the area.

On a calm midsummer day during World War I, a Royal Navy minesweeper hit the rock despite a local fisherman serving on board as a rating. He was aware that the ship was on a collision course, but was advised to keep quiet by a colleague in case he might be disciplined for criticising his superiors.

On a foggy day at 3pm, 8 October 1923, the 6,000 ton SS City of Westminster bound from Belfast to Rotterdam with a cargo of South African maize knocked the top of the reef clean off. A total of seventy-two people were taken off by the Sennen and Penlee lifeboats. Today, the remains of the ship lie in of water, jammed into a gully on the eastern side of the stone. The rock is now less dangerous and there have been no wrecks since.

==Diving==
Due to its exposure to the ocean currents and its relative accessibility of slipways at Porthgwarra and Lamorna, the Runnel Stone is known as one of the best dive sites in the whole of Cornwall. Diving must be carried out at slack water, which is about one and a half hours before high water at Newlyn. The highlights include visibility of up to 20m, numerous wrecks, and anemones in a vast array of colours.

==Marine Conservation Zone==
The Runnel Stone Marine Conservation Zone (also known as Land&#x27;s End (Runnel Stone)) was designated on 29 January 2016 and covers 20 km². The Conservation Zone boundary is a 3.5 km arc based on and to the south of the National Coastwatch Institution lookout on Gwennap Head. Included is the coast from Gwennap Head to Hall Dinas on the east side of Treryn Dinas. As well as protecting deep sea rocks on the Runnel Stone reef, the MCZ also protects other habitats ranging from exposed rock on the coast to soft sediments on the sea floor. Animals within the zone include sea anemones, sea fans and sponges.

==Literature==
The Cones of Runnel are used as a clue in the 1940 World War II thriller &quot;The Trojan Horse&quot; by Hammond Innes.

In the book &quot;The Medley of Mast and Sail: A Camera Record&quot; by Hurst, Alex. &amp; others, a Captain Lille describes the harrowing passage he inadvertently took with his ship, the barque &#x27;Favell&#x27;, sailing her between the Runnel Stone and the shore on 5 October 1934.

<text>Bobby Dodd Stadium at Hyundai Field is the football stadium located at the corner of North Avenue at Techwood Drive on the campus of the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta. It has been home to the Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets football team, often referred to as the &quot;Ramblin&#x27; Wreck&quot;, in rudimentary form since 1905 and as a complete stadium since 1913. The team participates in the NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision as a member of the Atlantic Coast Conference. It is the oldest stadium in the FBS and has been the site of more home wins than any other FBS stadium.

==Location==
The stadium is located on the east side of the Georgia Tech campus, across from freshman housing facilities and just a short walk from the campus library and fraternity/sorority row. The facility is in Midtown Atlanta, just off Interstate 75/85 (the &quot;Downtown Connector&quot;), across from the famed Varsity restaurant.

North Avenue station, located on the Red and Gold lines of the MARTA subway system, is a short walk to the east of Bobby Dodd Stadium along North Avenue.

==History==
Hyundai Field, formerly known as Historic Grant Field, is the oldest continuously used on-campus site for college football in the Southern United States, and the oldest in the FBS.

Football has been played at the current site since 1905. In 1913, permanent grandstands were built for the first time, mostly by Tech students. It was originally named for Hugh Inman Grant, son of John W. Grant, a well-known Atlanta merchant and original benefactor of the stadium. From 1913 to 1919, the stadium grew from a capacity of 7,000 to one of 25,000.
The stadium bears little, if any, resemblance to its original form, having been expanded many times. The original facility, roughly corresponding to the lower level of the current stadium&#x27;s west grandstands, seated 5,600. The terrain in the area slopes upward from north to south, a slope very noticeable in the background of early photos, before the slopes were covered by the large stands built over them. Due to that natural grade, much of the field itself is below street level. The houses observable in the background of early photos were replaced by dormitory buildings in the 1930s. In 1935, President Franklin D. Roosevelt gave a speech at the stadium.
By 1925, the east and south stands were completed, making the stadium a 30,000-seat horseshoe with an open north end. The west stands were rebuilt and a large press box was added in 1947, bringing capacity up to 44,000. The original all-steel 4,105-seat North stands were erected in 1958, and in 1962 and 1968 the upper decks were added to the East and West sides, respectively, bringing capacity to its all-time high of 58,121. Following this, Grant Field hosted the inaugural Peach Bowl in 1968, and would serve as its venue from 1968 to 1970. Grant Field was used as a site for an Atlanta Falcons game on October 5, 1969, when it was sharing Fulton County Stadium with the Atlanta Braves of Major League Baseball and there were scheduling conflicts for the 1969 NLCS. Grant Field also served as the home field for the Atlanta Apollos of the North American Soccer League for their 1973 season. In August 1984, the stadium hosted the annual Drum Corps International World Championships. In 1985 the South stands were razed to make room for the William C. Wardlaw Center, a modern field house and athletic office facility to replace the facilities in the old Heisman Gym, which was located just to the north of the stadium; the construction of the Wardlaw Center reduced the stadium&#x27;s capacity to 46,000.

In 1988, the stadium was renamed in honor of Bobby Dodd, who has the most wins of any coach in the team&#x27;s history.

The current, modern west grandstand covers the old concrete one, which is still intact underneath. The high interstitial space is currently used for storage. The lighting was replaced in 1998.

In 2001, the stadium served as the home venue for the Atlanta Beat of the Women&#x27;s United Soccer Association in their inaugural season. Following the 2001 season, a major expansion and renovation project was started, which was done in two phases in order to play the 2002 season in the stadium. For the 2002 season, seating was returned to the South end in front of the Wardlaw Center, and the original North stands and lower east bleachers were rebuilt and bowled in, with a club section featuring chairback seating and an air conditioned lounge added. After the 2002 season, the expansion was completed by adding a massive free standing upper deck in the north end zone. This addition of a north end zone upper deck brought Bobby Dodd Stadium to its current capacity. The new stadium was rededicated during the 2003 home season opener versus the Auburn Tigers on September 2, 2003. Georgia Tech won that game 17–3 in front of a capacity crowd of 55,000.

In the summer of 2009, Bobby Dodd Stadium underwent a number of changes. First, the scoreboard was renovated and after completion, is now twice as big as the old scoreboard. Also, ribbon boards were installed in front of the Wardlaw Center, as well as along the sides of the stadium. Another change was the improvement of the sound system in the stadium.
On October 5, 2016, Major League Soccer expansion team Atlanta United FC announced that it would play its home matches for the first half of the 2017 MLS season at Bobby Dodd Stadium until Mercedes-Benz Stadium was ready in mid-2017. The soccer club paid the university and the athletic association over $1 million for the usage of Bobby Dodd Stadium.

In the summer of 2020, Georgia Tech athletics officials announced that the playing surface of Bobby Dodd Stadium would be replaced with the Legion NXT synthetic turf by Shaw Sports. The stadium also got a new sound system, new LED lights, a full rebrand of stadium signage, and renovated restrooms.

On August 8, 2023, Georgia Tech announced a &quot;multi-decade&quot; naming rights deal with the Hyundai Motor Company, with Grant Field changing its name to Hyundai Field. According to the &quot;Atlanta Journal-Constitution&quot;, the agreement is for 20 years and worth $55 million.

In 2024, sections 218 and 219, and a part of section 217, in the stadium were permanently removed to fit the new Fanning Center, a 100,000 square-foot facility, into the northeast corner of the historic venue. Bobby Dodd Stadium&#x27;s capacity, starting with the 2024 season, was reduced from 55,000 to 51,913.

==Notable games==
October 7, 1916: Georgia Tech 222, Cumberland College 0&lt;br&gt;In the most lopsided game in American football history, Georgia Tech, under coach John Heisman, defeated Cumberland College, 222–0. It has been said that Coach Heisman was repaying the Bulldogs for a 22–0 baseball defeat the previous year in which Cumberland had allegedly used professional players to ensure victory or conversely that he was showing how that running up the score against weak opponents was vastly influential over the voters in college football rating polls. In any case, the Engineers (as the Georgia Tech team was known at the time) never threw a pass and never took more than four plays to score.
November 29, 1917: Georgia Tech 68, Auburn 7&lt;br&gt;This win marked the end of the first undefeated, untied National Championship season for the Yellow Jackets. In 1917, Georgia Tech outscored opponents 491–17 in the midst of a 33-game undefeated streak spanning over five seasons.

December 8, 1928: Georgia Tech 20, Georgia 6&lt;br&gt;This was the culmination of Georgia Tech&#x27;s second perfect season and National Championship, though the Yellow Jackets would go on to the Rose Bowl to face Cal in what would turn out to be a famous game itself. Georgia Tech played only two away games in its 9–0 regular season lineup hosting Notre Dame, Alabama, Auburn and Georgia. The main reason for this is that many of the other Southern teams&#x27; stadiums were not as large or accessible as Grant Field in Midtown Atlanta.
November 15, 1952: #4 Georgia Tech 7, #12 Alabama 3&lt;br&gt;In one of the biggest games of Georgia Tech&#x27;s third national championship season, two of the highest ranked teams to ever face off on Grant Field saw Georgia Tech defeat Alabama in a closely matched defensive battle. Georgia Tech&#x27;s Jake &quot;Mouse&quot; Rudolph was knocked unconscious by tackling Alabama&#x27;s Bobby Marlow on a fourth-down play on the goal line late in the game, which became known as the &quot;$125,000 tackle&quot;. This play prevented Alabama from scoring and provided the Yellow Jackets with the opportunity to win the game with one touch down drive. The victory preserved the Yellow Jackets&#x27; undefeated record, and Georgia Tech was invited to play in the Sugar Bowl and earned the bowl payout. Tech, which had already defeated number 6 Duke would go on to defeat Florida State, Georgia and undefeated number 7 Mississippi (in the Sugar Bowl) in the midst of a 31-game undefeated streak.

November 17, 1962: Georgia Tech 7, #1 Alabama 6&lt;br&gt;This upset victory over top-ranked Alabama ended the Crimson Tide&#x27;s 26-game unbeaten streak. Bobby Dodd called it his greatest victory as Tech thwarted Alabama comeback efforts by preventing a two-point conversion attempt and intercepting a Joe Namath pass deep in their own territory with just 1:05 left.

October 5, 1969: Baltimore Colts 21, Atlanta Falcons 14&lt;br&gt;This was the only regular season NFL game played at Grant Stadium. The stadium hosted this game because the Atlanta Braves were playing in the National League Championship Series against the New York Mets.

November 6, 1976: Georgia Tech 23, #11 Notre Dame 14&lt;br&gt;In the most memorable game of a 4–6–1 season, Georgia Tech defeated #11 Notre Dame without throwing a forward pass. After quarterback Gary Lanier was sacked while dropping back to pass in the first quarter, Notre Dame&#x27;s Ross Browner and Willie Fry celebrated on the field. Georgia Tech coach Pepper Rodgers decided to not allow the Fighting Irish the chance to strut after a sack, and called for a run on every subsequent play. The unusual strategy worked, and the Yellow Jackets upset Notre Dame.

October 13, 1990: #15 Georgia Tech 21, #14 Clemson 19&lt;br&gt;Only two seasons removed from a 3–8 1988 season, Coach Bobby Ross had led his team to a 4–0 record to face the Tigers. The Yellow Jackets came out on top of this closely matched battle and would go on to defeat number 1 Virginia and number 19 Nebraska in the Citrus Bowl for its fourth national championship.

October 17, 1998: #25 Georgia Tech 41, #7 Virginia 38&lt;br&gt;In the second meeting between two highly ranked Georgia Tech and Virginia teams (the first being in 1990), Georgia Tech again came out victorious by the same score of 41–38, earning the Yellow Jackets a share of the ACC Championship. Virginia jumped to a big lead in this Georgia Tech homecoming game. Big plays by GT finally put them ahead late in the game, including a dramatic touchdown pass by Joe Hamilton to Dez White. Virginia missed a field goal in the final seconds prompting thousands of Georgia Tech fans to pour onto the field.

November 27, 1999: #16 Georgia Tech 51, #21 Georgia 48 (OT)&lt;br&gt;In the highest scoring game ever in the series, Georgia overcame a 17-point deficit in the second half to tie the game and appeared to be within easy victory after driving all the way to Tech&#x27;s 2-yard line with nine seconds left in regulation. Rather than kick a game-winning field goal, Georgia coach Jim Donnan called a running play that was ruled a fumble by Jasper Sanks which Georgia Tech recovered in the endzone. Replays seemed to indicate that the runner was down when the ball came out, anyway Georgia lost. In overtime, after intercepting a Georgia pass in the endzone, Tech attempted a field goal on third down in its possession. The kick was blocked, but Tech holder George Godsey recovered the ball. Tech kicker Luke Manget&#x27;s second chance at the kick was good. The Georgia Tech student section rushed the field and tore down the goal posts. this remains Georgia Tech&#x27;s most recent home win over Georgia.

September 2, 2006: #2 Notre Dame 14, Georgia Tech 10 &lt;br&gt;A prime time game in front of a national audience on ABC, the Jackets played toe to toe with the second-ranked Irish but fell just short in a 14–10 defeat. College Gameday came to Atlanta earlier that day. The storyline of a top five Irish squad going up against the Jacket&#x27;s Calvin Johnson, who at the time was the best college wide receiver in the nation, intrigued sports fans. A crowd of 56,680 squeezed into the stadium, which is the largest crowd in the current configuration of Bobby Dodd Stadium.

November 1, 2008: Georgia Tech 31, #16 Florida State 28 &lt;br&gt;Prior to the November 1 meeting between FSU and Georgia Tech, Bobby Bowden was undefeated against Georgia Tech. Florida State Coach Bobby Bowden had never lost to Georgia Tech in 12 meetings. The last time Georgia Tech defeated Florida State in football was in 1975. During Paul Johnson&#x27;s first year as head coach, Georgia Tech had a 6–2 record going into the game. Georgia Tech fell behind by a touchdown twice in the first quarter, but pulled ahead in the 2nd quarter to finish the first half leading 24–20. A third-quarter touchdown put Tech up 31–20, but Florida State rallied, scoring a touchdown and converting on the two-point attempt to come within three points. On their final drive Florida State drove down to inside the five-yard line. Florida State running back Marcus Sims received the handoff and was headed for the end zone, but was met by Georgia Tech freshman, Cooper Taylor, son of former Tech QB Jim Bob Taylor. The football was knocked loose into the end zone and recovered by Tech freshman Rashaad Reid to secure the victory for the Jackets. Fans swarmed the field after witnessing their team snap a 12-game losing streak to the Seminoles, Tech&#x27;s longest to any modern team.

November 20, 2008: Georgia Tech 41, #23 Miami (FL) 23 &lt;br&gt;Under the lights on Thursday night the Jackets made a statement with a pivotal blowout win over Miami. Tech had fallen from the ranks after losing to then nineteenth ranked North Carolina nearly two weeks prior. The Yellow Jackets had a bye week and extra time to prepare for the Hurricanes. Bobby Dodd Stadium was energized for the game. While it is an annual tradition now, this was the first white-out game on the flats. Paul Johnson wanted to excite the fanbase in his first year as coach. Inspired by Penn State, he introduced the white-out to Tech. Come game time, the entire stadium wasn&#x27;t full (49,335 out of 55,000 seats were filled). But the Tech students packed the sections behind both endzones, creating a tough environment for the Miami offense to play in. Miami was favored by 3.5 points. After the first quarter Tech led 3–0 in a mostly even game. That changed in the second period. Miami faced 3rd &amp; 3 in their own territory. Michael Johnson picked off a pass and ran it back for the first Touchdown of the game. The Jackets would score 21 points in the second, 17 in the third, and cruised to victory. The Jacket offense behind the spread option scheme rushed for 472 yards and wowed an ESPN national audience. The next week the Jackets returned to the polls at #18.

October 17, 2009: #19 Georgia Tech 28, #4 Virginia Tech 23 &lt;br&gt;Played before an emotionally charged crowd, this was the first time Georgia Tech defeated a top-5 team at home since beating No. 1 Alabama 7–6 in 1962. After the victory students rushed the field, tore down the goalpost at the north end zone, and carried it to Georgia Tech President George P. &quot;Bud&quot; Peterson&#x27;s house. The victory launched the Jackets to #11 in the AP Poll. This was the pivotal game which helped Georgia Tech win the ACC Coastal Division title. Later, the Jackets beat Clemson in the 2009 ACC Championship Game and earned its first conference title since 1998 and its first Orange Bowl berth since 1967. The game is also remembered by Tech fans as the “All The Way Turnt Up game”. GT players made hype videos using the song All the Way Turnt Up which were played on the video board during timeouts. The Tech fans chanted it throughout the game and the Tech team sang it in the locker room postgame. The ACC title was later vacated.

October 29, 2011: Georgia Tech 31, #5 Clemson 17 &lt;br&gt;Before a sellout crowd of 55,646, Georgia Tech rebounded from two consecutive losses to upset #5 Clemson. The Tigers, who were undefeated before the game, turned the ball over 4 times in the game and allowed Georgia Tech to rush for 383 yards. Tevin Washington led the Yellow Jackets by rushing for 176 yards on 27 carries and a touchdown, which was the most rushing yards ever by a Georgia Tech quarterback. The Yellow Jackets raced to a 24–3 halftime lead and held off Clemson, which was 8–0 for the first time since 2000, when Georgia Tech defeated the then #4 Clemson Tigers. It was Tech&#x27;s first win against a top-5 team since defeating #4 Virginia Tech in 2009.

October 24, 2015: Georgia Tech 22, #9 Florida State 16 &lt;br&gt;Before a sellout crowd of 55,000, Georgia Tech rebounded from five consecutive losses to opponents with combined records of 30–4 to upset #9 Florida State University, a program that had won 28 consecutive conference games, the 2013 Vizio BCS National Championship, and two consecutive Atlantic Coast Conference Titles. Over their last 51 games, Florida State was 48–3. The Seminoles, who were undefeated before the game, had the ball with 3rd and goal to go with eight minutes remaining, up 16–13, when Everett Golson&#x27;s intended pass was deflected off Georgia Tech cornerback Lawrence Austin&#x27;s shoe and intercepted by veteran senior safety Jamal Golden. Harrison Butker of the Yellow Jackets nailed a 25-yard field goal with 57 seconds remaining to tie the game at 16. Florida State drove down the field, and set itself up for a 56-yard game-winning field goal by Roberto Aquayo, who was 26 for 26 all time on field goal attempts in the fourth quarter, and 63 for 63 on extra points in the fourth quarter. The potential game-winning kick was blocked by Patrick Gamble of the Yellow Jackets, and recovered by Lance Austin at the 22 yard line, where he dazzled his way amongst a convoy of Georgia Tech blockers 78 yards down the gridiron into the endzone as time expired, giving Georgia Tech its third win of the 2015 season, and third Top 10 win under Paul Johnson&#x27;s guidance. Fans rushed the field almost immediately after Austin reached the endzone. Ever since the VT game in 2009, the goalposts have been lowered after each game, which prevented fans from tearing them down that night. Regardless, Tech fans partied and celebrated on Grant Field for almost two hours postgame. Some of the Tech players even came back out to party with the fans. This remains one of the most recognizable endings in College Football history, and is known as the “Miracle on Techwood Drive”.

March 5, 2017: Atlanta United 1, New York Red Bulls 2 &lt;br&gt;The first game in Atlanta United history was played before a sellout crowd of 55,297. In the 25th minute, midfielder Yamil Asad scored the very first goal in club history, with the assistance of forward Josef Martínez. The Red Bulls, however, struck back with midfielder Daniel Royer&#x27;s equalizer in the 76th minute and the game-winning own goal for the Red Bulls scored by United defender Anton Walkes, with the help of Red Bulls forward Bradley Wright-Phillips. United would go on to play another 8 games at Bobby Dodd before moving to their new home at Mercedes-Benz Stadium.

October 28, 2023: Georgia Tech 46, #17 North Carolina 42 &lt;br&gt;Behind 635 yards of offense and Haynes King&#x27;s fourth touchdown pass of the game with 4:28 to go, Georgia Tech erased an 11-point deficit with 22 points in the final 13 minutes of its 46–42 win over 17th-ranked North Carolina. King&#x27;s 5-yard touchdown pass to Brett Seither with 4:28 remaining capped a 79-yard drive – the Yellow Jackets’ third scoring drive of the fourth quarter – and proved to be the game-winner. Trailing 35–24, Tech started its comeback when Haynes capped an 88-yard march with a 4-yard touchdown run at the 12:02 mark. King connected with Malik Rutherford on an inside screen for the two-point conversion, bringing the Jackets within 35–31. North Carolina answered with a long kickoff return to set up a quick two-play drive for a touchdown, scoring on a 35-yard pass from Drake Maye to Doc Chapman and extending its lead to 42–32. But it took just 33 seconds for Tech to score next, with Smith bolting 70 yards up the middle for a touchdown to get the Jackets back within 42–39 with 10:40 remaining in the game. After UNC&#x27;s Noah Burnett&#x27;s 39-yard field goal missed to the left, Tech capitalized by moving 79 yards on six plays, capped by the go-ahead touchdown pass from King to Seither with 4:28 to go. Maye started leading the Tar Heels down the field once again. Maye completed a 36-yard strike to Tez Walker, but Tech&#x27;s Ahmari Harvey drilled Walker to knock the ball loose and K.J. Wallace recovered the fumble for the Jackets at their 24-yard line. From there, Tech picked up a pair of first downs to drain the last 2:54 off the clock, setting off a field-storming celebration by an elated Bobby Dodd Stadium crowd.

November 9, 2024: Georgia Tech 28, #4 Miami 23 &lt;br&gt; Georgia Tech kept the nation’s top offense at bay and gashed No. 4 Miami’s defense for 271 yards on the ground to knock the Hurricanes from the ranks of the unbeaten with a 28-23 win on Homecoming in front of a deafening Tech crowd. Despite throwing just 16 passes in quarterback Haynes King’s first start since sustaining an injury nearly a month ago, Georgia Tech (6-4, 4-3 ACC) raced out to a 21-10 lead and held on to hand Miami its first loss of the season. It was Tech’s first win over a top four team since the 2009 Virginia Tech win. The win triggered a huge field-storming celebration, and both goalposts were torn down and paraded around campus.

<text>Hide Nothing is the third studio album by the Pompano Beach, Florida rock band Further Seems Forever, released in 2004 by Tooth &amp; Nail Records. It was the band&#x27;s only studio album with vocalist Jon Bunch, formerly of Sense Field, who had replaced Jason Gleason when the latter left the band due to interpersonal tensions. An animated music video was filmed for the song &quot;Light Up Ahead.&quot;

==Background==
Further Seems Forever recorded the music to their third album with James Paul Wisner from December 2003 to January 2004. The drums were tracked at Landmark Productions &amp; Recording Studios in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, while the guitars and bass guitar tracks were recorded at Wisner&#x27;s home studio, Wisner Productions in Davie, Florida. Vocalist Gleason got as far as recording vocals for one song, before leaving the band in mid-January 2004. Gleason cited that the band &quot;spent too much time&quot; together &quot;packed in a box&quot;. Though he initially agreed to finish working on the album, he backed out, leaving the group to complete it amidst financial pressure from Tooth &amp; Nail Records. Drummer Steve Kleisath said the manner in which Gleason &quot;went about things was horrible and it affected a lot more people than just us, as far as the bad timing of it.&quot; 

Despite an announcement that Further Seems Forever planned to break up, the band revealed that Sense Field frontman Jon Bunch had joined as their new vocalist in mid-February 2004. The band had to wait to finish recording the vocals and mix the album until Wisner could free up his schedule. In addition to relocating his studio from Davie, Florida to St. Cloud, Florida in early February 2004, Wisner was also busy recording Underoath&#x27;s album &quot;They&#x27;re Only Chasing Safety&quot; in February 2004, followed by Mourning September&#x27;s album &quot;A Man Can Change His Stars&quot; in March 2004. Bunch finally recorded his vocals at Wisner Productions in St. Cloud, Florida in April 2004, and the album was mixed later that month.

==Composition==
Musically, the sound of &quot;Hide Nothing&quot; has been described as emo with elements of progressive metal and pop. Kleisath said it combined elements from the group&#x27;s first two albums &quot;The Moon Is Down&quot; (2001) and &quot;How to Start a Fire&quot;. He said Bunch&#x27;s lyrics were &quot;a lot less metaphorical and more up front&quot;. The opening track &quot;Light Up Ahead&quot; tackles the theme of spiritual salvation. The closing track &quot;For All We Know&quot; is an acoustic-and-piano track with a string section.

==Release and promotion==
Further Seems Forever played their first show with Bunch in early May 2004; the band tried to have Gleason for a tour with their Tooth &amp; Nail label-mates, until negotiations fell through. Later in the month, Bunch played some shows in Japan with Sense Field. On June 17, &quot;Hide Nothing&quot; was announced for release in two months&#x27; time. In addition, &quot;Light Up Ahead&quot; was posted online. &quot;Like Someone You Know&quot; was posted on the band&#x27;s PureVolume page on July 16, 2004, followed by the title-track three days later. In early August 2004, leading up to the album&#x27;s August 24 release, several more songs were made available through the band&#x27;s website. 

The band teamed up with Brandtson, The Kicks, Moments in Grace and Salem for the Hide Nothing Tour, which spanned from August 22 to October 4, 2004. The tour took the bands through the United States&#x27; West Coast (including a date in Western Canada), the Midwest and the East Coast. The band next partnered with Sparta, Copeland and Sunshine for another American and Canadian tour which spanned from November 5 to December 6, 2004.

From February 15 to March 14, 2005, the band toured the United States with The Starting Line, Days Away and JamisonParker. On April 5, 2005, the band released digitally the acoustic EP &quot;Hope Against Hope&quot;, which contains the bonus material original offered on the limited edition version of &quot;Hide Nothing&quot;. On April 30, 2005, the band played a one-off reunion show with its original members, including Carrabba and Dominguez, at The Bamboozle, at which they performed &quot;The Moon Is Down&quot; in its entirety.

With Bunch back on vocals, Further Seems Forever toured Europe and the United Kingdom during May and June 2005, joined by bass guitarist Thomas Rankine (formerly of As Friends Rust and Salem). In August, the group embarked on a North American tour with Number One Gun and Project 86. In September 2005, the band headlined three shows at national amusement parks: Cliff&#x27;s Amusement Park in Albuquerque, New Mexico, Walt Disney World in Lake Buena Vista, Florida and Carowinds Paladium in Charlotte, North Carolina.

On November 26, 2005, the band announced they would go on a hiatus; by early January 2006, the situation shifted to a disbandment. A planned farewell show in Canada was cancelled when Further Seems Forever became banned from the country as the result of an improperly filled out form. Five of the album&#x27;s tracks – the title-track, &quot;Light Up Ahead&quot;, &quot;Like Someone You Know&quot;, &quot;Bleed&quot; and &quot;For All We Know&quot;, as well as the acoustic version of &quot;Light Up Ahead&quot; – later appeared on the group&#x27;s compilation album &quot;Hope This Finds You Well&quot; (2006).

==Reception==

Christian Broadcasting Network included the album as an honorable mention on their best albums of 2004 list. &quot;Jesus Freak Hideout&quot; ranked it at number 81 on their list of the top 100 Tooth &amp; Nail releases.

&quot;Jesus Freak Hideout&quot; staff member Josh Taylor said Bunch&#x27;s vocals were &quot;much more melodic and ambient&quot; than Gleason&#x27;s or Carrabba&#x27;s, though not as emotional as the latter, &quot;but the power is there.&quot; Most of the time, it was a &quot;mellow, yet sonic&quot; release, with the tracks &quot;pick[ing] up on occasion.&quot; &quot;Cross Rhythms&quot; writer Haydon Spenceley said the group &quot;have struck gold&quot; with the inclusion of Bunch: &quot;This boy can SING.&quot; The group offered their &quot;most immediate material to date&quot;, which could &quot;see Further Seems Forever cementing their place at the centre of the underground rock scene.&quot;

With the album, AllMusic said the band furthered their developing brand of &quot;appealing ... melodic emo-core&quot;, coming across as &quot;a more finely tuned sense of songcraft&quot; than &quot;How to Start a Fire&quot;. The resultant mixture of confessional singer-songwriter elements, aggressive guitar work and harmonies &quot;should appeal to both the hardcore set and lovers of emo-tinged indie rock.&quot; Kaj Roth of &quot;Melodic&quot; said the record showed the band &quot;has new fuel for their engines and feels more rocking and vital than before.&quot; He noted its short length, where &quot;only 2 songs are longer than 3 minutes&quot;, was one of its strengths, &quot;so you get to know all the songs much faster than the average rock album.&quot;

<text>Balzhinima Tsyrenzhapovich Tsyrempilov (, &quot;Balzhinimá Tsyrenzhápovich Tsyrempílov&quot;, born April 9, 1975, in Ulekchin, Zakamensky District, Buryatia) is a World Cup-winning and former world number one Buryat archer from Russia.

==2004 Summer Olympics==
Tsyrempilov competed at the 2004 Summer Olympics in men&#x27;s individual archery. Tsyrempilov placed 14th overall.

==2007 World Championship==
At the 2007 World Archery Championships in July 2007 in Leipzig, Tsyrempilov won silver in recurve men&#x27;s individual.

==2008 Summer Olympics==
At the Men&#x27;s individual archery event of 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing Tsyrempilov finished his ranking round with a total of 671 points, eight points behind Juan René Serrano, the winner of the round. This gave him the sixth seed for the final competition bracket in which he faced Daniel Pavlov in the first round, beating the Bulgarian 112-102. In the second round Tsyrempilov had a rematch with Chen Szu-Yuan and took revenge for the loss in 2004 with a 109–101 win. However, in the third round Tsyrempilov&#x27;s tournament was over after he was unable to beat Ryuichi Moriya, 113-110.

Together with Andrey Abramov and Bair Badënov he also took part in the team event. With his 671 score from the ranking round combined with the 660 of Abramov and the 658 of Badënov Russia was in fourth position after the ranking round, which gave them a straight seed into the quarter-finals. However, with 217-209 they were beaten by the team from China that eventually won the bronze medal.

The centrifuge would have provided controlled acceleration rates (artificial gravity) for experiments and the capability to:
*Expose a variety of biological specimens that are less than tall to artificial gravity levels between 0.01g and 2g.
*Simultaneously provide two different artificial gravity levels.
*Provide partial g and hyper g environment for specimens to investigate altered gravity effects and g-thresholds.
*Provide short duration and partial g and hyper g environment for specimens to investigate temporal effects of gravity exposure.
*Provide Earth simulation environment on ISS to isolate microgravity effects on specimens.
*Provide Earth simulation environment on ISS to allow specimens to recover from microgravity effects.
*Provide in situ 1g controls for specimens in micro-gravity.
It was built by JAXA&#x27;s predecessor, NASDA, but owned by NASA, who obtained ownership of the CAM by trading in a free launch of the Japanese Experiment Module Kibo to the ISS. The CAM flight model along with the engineering model of the centrifuge rotor were manufactured. The CAM would have been attached to the zenith port on the Harmony module of the ISS. 

It was cancelled in 2005 alongside the Habitation Module and the Crew Return Vehicle, because of ISS cost overruns and scheduling problems in Space Shuttle assembly flights.

It is now on display in an outdoor exhibit at the Tsukuba Space Center in Japan.
