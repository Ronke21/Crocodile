<text>The Curtiss NC (Curtiss Navy Curtiss, nicknamed &quot;Nancy boat&quot; or &quot;Nancy&quot;) is a flying boat built by Curtiss Aeroplane and Motor Company and used by the United States Navy from 1918 through the early 1920s. Ten of these aircraft were built, the most famous of which is the NC-4, the first airplane to make a transatlantic flight. The NC-4 is preserved in the National Museum of Naval Aviation, at NAS Pensacola, Florida.

==Development==
Manufacture of the &quot;NC&quot;s began in 1918 during World War I. The U.S. Navy wished for an aircraft capable of long ocean flights, both for anti-submarine warfare patrol, and if possible with capability to fly across the Atlantic Ocean under their own power to avoid having to be shipped through ocean waters menaced by German submarines. This was a very ambitious undertaking, given the state of aviation at the time. The Navy and Curtiss came up with one of the largest biplane designs yet produced, equipped with sleeping quarters and a wireless transmitter/receiver. It was originally powered by three V12 Liberty engines, of 400 hp (298 kW) each; during the testing phase Marc Mitscher recommended the addition of a fourth engine to help create enough power to lift the boats out of the water. The fourth engine was added to the midline in a pusher configuration. The maximum speed was 90 mph (144 km/h) and the estimated maximum range was 1,500 mi (2,400 km). Called NC boats, with the &quot;N&quot; for Navy and &quot;C&quot; for the builder Curtiss, they were nicknamed &quot;Nancys&quot;.

===NC-1 and NC-2 engine nacelle arrangements===

As originally completed the NC-1 had three tractor engines in nacelles located midway between the mainplanes, the centre nacelle housing the cockpit for two pilots. Due to a lack of power the centre nacelle was raised, elongated forwards and a pusher engine added. With this engine arrangement the pilots cockpit was moved to the hull in a more conventional position.

NC-2 differed in having the centre engine, of its complement of three, fitted as a pusher, retaining the pilots cockpit in the centre nacelle. Also suffering from a lack of power, the NC-2 was modified with four engines in tandem outer nacelles, (due to the outer nacelles being built closer to the centre nacelle, the three tractor/one pusher arrangement was impractical). Initially the centre cockpit nacelle was retained but this was soon removed and a similar conventional cockpit to NC-1 was added.

NC-3 onwards continued with the later NC-1 arrangement of 3x tractor/1x pusher engines and conventional cockpit in the hull.

==Operational history==

On 4 October 1918, the first of these aircraft, the NC-1, made its first test flight with the early three-engine configuration. On 25 November, it flew again, with a world record 51 people on board. 
 Armistice Day, signaling the end of the war in Europe, came before testing of the first NC and construction of the other three of the Navy&#x27;s initial order had been completed.

The NC-2 suffered damage during the testing phase and was cannibalized for spare parts.

The other three NCs, NC-1, NC-3, and NC-4, set out on what was intended as the first demonstration of transatlantic flight, via Newfoundland and the Azores, on 8 May 1919. As junior officer, Mitscher, who had been allotted to one of the commands, lost his command when NC-2 had to be broken up for parts. He went on the flight as one of the pilots of the NC-1. The group met heavy fog off the Azores, making flight in the crudely instrumented aircraft extremely dangerous. Without a visible horizon it was extremely difficult to keep the aircraft in level flight. NC-1 tried different altitudes and soldiered on for several hours before eventually putting down just short of the Azores and was damaged beyond repair in the rough seas.

Only the NC-4 made it through. The crew of NC-1 was rescued at sea. Attempts to tow the aircraft to the Azores failed. NC-3 was forced to land some 205 mi (330 km) distance from the Azores, but the crew, led by Commander John Henry Towers, managed to sail her to Ponta Delgada unaided. 
The Navy had two more sets of NCs constructed, numbered NC-5 to NC-8, and NC-9 and NC-10, up to 1921.

<doc id="907222" wikidata="Q749568" url="?curid=907222" title="REST">
<text>REST (Representational State Transfer) is a software architectural style that was created to describe the design and guide the development of the architecture for the World Wide Web. REST defines a set of constraints for how the architecture of a distributed, Internet-scale hypermedia system, such as the Web, should behave. The REST architectural style emphasises uniform interfaces, independent deployment of components, the scalability of interactions between them, and creating a layered architecture to promote caching to reduce user-perceived latency, enforce security, and encapsulate legacy systems.

REST has been employed throughout the software industry to create stateless, reliable web-based applications. An application that adheres to the REST architectural constraints may be informally described as &quot;RESTful&quot;, although this term is more commonly associated with the design of HTTP-based APIs and what are widely considered best practices regarding the &quot;verbs&quot; (HTTP methods) a resource responds to while having little to do with REST as originally formulated—and is often even at odds with the concept.

== Principle ==
The term &quot;representational state transfer&quot; was introduced and defined in 2000 by computer scientist Roy Fielding in his doctoral dissertation. It means that a server will respond with the representation of a resource (today, it will most often be an HTML document) and that resource will contain hypermedia links that can be followed to make the state of the system change. Any such request will in turn receive the representation of a resource, and so on.

An important consequence is that the only identifier that needs to be known is the identifier of the first resource requested, and all other identifiers will be discovered. This means that those identifiers can change without the need to inform the client beforehand and that client and server must be inherently loosely coupled.

== History ==

The Web began to enter everyday use in 1993–1994, when websites for general use started to become available. At the time, only a fragmented description existed of the Web&#x27;s architecture, and there was pressure within the industry to agree on a standard for the Web interface protocols. For instance, several experimental extensions had been added to the communication protocol (HTTP) to support proxies, and more extensions were being proposed, but there was a need for a formal Web architecture with which to evaluate the impact of these changes.

The W3C and IETF working groups together started work on creating formal descriptions of the Web&#x27;s three primary standards: URI, HTTP, and HTML. Roy Fielding was involved in the creation of these standards (specifically HTTP 1.0 and 1.1, and URI), and during the next six years he created the REST architectural style, testing its constraints on the Web&#x27;s protocol standards and using it as a means to define architectural improvements — and to identify architectural mismatches. Fielding defined REST in his 2000 PhD dissertation &quot;Architectural Styles and the Design of Network-based Software Architectures&quot; at UC Irvine.

To create the REST architectural style, Fielding identified the requirements that apply when creating a world-wide network-based application, such as the need for a low entry barrier to enable global adoption. He also surveyed many existing architectural styles for network-based applications, identifying which features are shared with other styles, such as caching and client–server features, and those which are unique to REST, such as the concept of resources. Fielding was trying to both categorise the existing architecture of the current implementation and identify which aspects should be considered central to the behavioural and performance requirements of the Web.

By their nature, architectural styles are independent of any specific implementation, and while REST was created as part of the development of the Web standards, the implementation of the Web does not obey every constraint in the REST architectural style. Mismatches can occur due to ignorance or oversight, but the existence of the REST architectural style means that they can be identified before they become standardised. For example, Fielding identified the embedding of session information in URIs as a violation of the constraints of REST which can negatively affect shared caching and server scalability. HTTP cookies also violate REST constraints because they can become out of sync with the browser&#x27;s application state, making them unreliable; they also contain opaque data that can be a concern for privacy and security.

== Architectural properties ==
The REST architectural style is designed for network-based applications, specifically client-server applications. But more than that, it is designed for Internet-scale usage, so the coupling between the &quot;user agent&quot; (client) and the &quot;origin server&quot; must be as loose as possible to facilitate large-scale adoption.

The strong decoupling of client and server together with the text-based transfer of information using a uniform addressing protocol provided the basis for meeting the requirements of the Web: extensibility, anarchic scalability and independent deployment of components, large-grain data transfer, and a low entry-barrier for content readers, content authors and developers.

The constraints of the REST architectural style affect the following architectural properties:

* Performance in component interactions, which can be the dominant factor in user-perceived performance and network efficiency;
* Scalability allowing the support of large numbers of components and interactions among components;
* Simplicity of a uniform interface;
* Modifiability of components to meet changing needs (even while the application is running);
* Visibility of communication between components by service agents;
* Portability of components by moving program code with the data;
* Reliability in the resistance to failure at the system level in the presence of failures within components, connectors, or data.

== Architectural constraints ==
The REST architectural style defines six guiding constraints. When these constraints are applied to the system architecture, it gains desirable non-functional properties, such as performance, scalability, simplicity, modifiability, visibility, portability, and reliability.

The formal REST constraints are as follows:

* Client/Server – Clients are separated from servers by a well-defined interface
* Stateless – A specific client does not consume server storage when the client is &quot;at rest&quot;
* Cache – Responses indicate their own cacheability
* Uniform interface
* Layered system – A client cannot ordinarily tell whether it is connected directly to the end server, or to an intermediary along the way
* Code on demand (optional) – Servers are able to temporarily extend or customize the functionality of a client by transferring logic to the client that can be executed within a standard virtual machine

=== Uniform interface ===
The uniform interface constraint is fundamental to the design of any RESTful system. It simplifies and decouples the architecture, which enables each part to evolve independently. The four constraints for this uniform interface are:

* Resource identification in requests: Individual resources are identified in requests using URIs. The resources themselves are conceptually separate from the representations that are returned to the client. For example, the server could send data from its database as HTML, XML or as JSON—none of which are the server&#x27;s internal representation.
* Resource manipulation through representations: When a client holds a representation of a resource, including any metadata attached, it has enough information to modify or delete the resource&#x27;s state.
* Self-descriptive messages: Each message includes enough information to describe how to process the message. For example, which parser to invoke can be specified by a media type.
* Hypermedia as the engine of application state (HATEOAS) – Having accessed an initial URI for the REST application—analogous to a human Web user accessing the home page of a website—a REST client should then be able to use server-provided links dynamically to discover all the available resources it needs. As access proceeds, the server responds with text that includes hyperlinks to other resources that are currently available. There is no need for the client to be hard-coded with information regarding the structure of the server.

== Classification models ==
Several models have been developed to help classify REST APIs according to their adherence to various principles of REST design, such as

* the Richardson Maturity Model
* the Classification of HTTP-based APIs
* the W S3 maturity model

<doc id="907223" wikidata="Q3046401" url="?curid=907223" title="Luis Carlos Galán">
<text>Luis Carlos Galán Sarmiento (29 September 1943 – 18 August 1989) was a Colombian liberal politician and journalist who ran for the Presidency of Colombia on two occasions, the first time for the political movement New Liberalism that he founded in 1979. The movement was an offspring of the mainstream Colombian Liberal Party, and with mediation of former Liberal president Julio César Turbay Ayala, Galán returned to the Liberal party in 1989 and sought the nomination for the 1990 presidential election, but was assassinated before the vote took place.

Galán declared himself an enemy of the drug cartels and the influence of the mafia in Colombian politics, in this case the main drug cartel being the Medellin Cartel led by Pablo Escobar and who unsuccessfully tried to become a member of the New Liberalism Movement in his bid to become a member of the Colombian House of Representatives. Galán denounced Pablo Escobar in a public rally, and supported the extradition treaty with the U.S, contrary to the wishes of the Colombian cartels that feared extradition to the U.S. 

After receiving several death threats, on 18 August 1989, Galán was shot and killed by hitmen hired by the drug cartels of Pablo Escobar during a campaign rally in the town of Soacha, Cundinamarca. At the time, he was comfortably leading the polls with 60 percent favourable ratings for the forthcoming 1990 presidential election. While the investigation into his assassination remains unsolved, Galan&#x27;s assassination was a crucial factor in the downfall of the Medellin Cartel a few years later.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Luis Carlos Galán Sarmiento was born on 29 September 1943 in the city of Charala, Santander. He had a happy childhood, with strong family bonds, affectionate and sometimes austere, as he had 12 siblings. His father moved with the whole family to Bogotá in 1949.

In Bogotá, Galán attended middle school in the &quot;Colegio Americano&quot; in 1950. While a student there and only 8 years old, he joined a rally against Conservative president Laureano Gómez and intended to support the Liberal guerrillas. Two years later he was transferred to another school, the &quot;Colegio Antonio Nariño&quot;. When he was only a 14-year-old, Galán participated in the students protests of 1957 against the dictatorial regime of Gustavo Rojas, being arrested and spending the night in a jail despite his young age. In 1960 Galán graduated from high school with honors and began studies of law and economics in the Pontifical Xavierian University in Bogotá. While a student in 1963, Galán founded &quot;Vértice&quot;, a university focused magazine to express his Liberal tendencies in a university that was predominantly Conservative, which also became his first experience with journalism. He was able to meet prominent Colombian leaders like former Liberal president Carlos Lleras (who, delighted with Galán&#x27;s work, decided to write articles for Vértice Magazine) and Colombia&#x27;s main circulation newspaper El Tiempo owner and also former Liberal president of Colombia Eduardo Santos during an interview in which Santos was impressed by Galán&#x27;s journalist qualities. Galán began working for the Colombian newspaper El Tiempo in 1965 after graduating from university the same year.

===Journalism===
While working with El Tiempo, Galán turned himself into a well known journalist and columnist, an effort that earned him the director&#x27;s assistant position and later the membership of the Executive Directorate in the newspaper with the support of Eduardo Santos and then director Roberto García Peña. He was also active with the Nueva Frontera weekly magazine founded by former president Carlos Lleras, which he directed in 1976 after arriving from Italy. As a journalist Galán wrote no less than 150 editorial articles, followed by another 150 during his time with the El Tiempo newspaper.

In 1977 Galán wrote an article in one of Nueva Frontera&#x27;s editorials denouncing the existence of narcotics trafficking mafias and that they were influencing the social structure of Colombia. He also denounced the clientelist politics, moral values corruption and collective values loss, which was seen as a premonition for Colombia&#x27;s future.

It was during an interview with the then recently elected president Misael Pastrana that he was surprised by the president in the middle of the interview who told Galán that he was going to be his Minister of Education.

In 1986, Galán wrote an autobiography under the pseudonym &quot;Cleo Tilde&quot;, but it was not until 1994 that the identity was revealed. He described detailed facts, events and encounters with prominent figures as well as an approach to his personal point of view and thoughts.

===Political career===
In 1970 Galán was appointed Minister of National Education during the presidency of Misael Pastrana. His time as minister was marked by his progressive and social policies, but was not considered successful. In 1972 Galán was appointed Ambassador of Colombia to Italy and later in 1974 while still ambassador, was appointed Colombian representative to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO). Under the influence of former president Lleras and after directing the Nueva Frontera Magazine for seven years, in 1976 Galán ran for councilman in the small town of Oiba in the northeastern department of Santander. In 1977 and 1978 Galán became very active and supportive of Carlos Lleras reelection as president of Colombia while he ran for the Senate. The reelection never occurred, however, and he got elected as Senator of Colombia representing the Santander Department.

On 30 November 1979 Galán founded a party with the name Nuevo Liberalismo and within the Liberal Party.

During the 1980s Colombia went under critical siege by violent drug cartels, especially the Medellín Cartel that had gained a great amount of influence by bribing or killing officials. Galán saw this as disastrous for Colombia and its society.

In 1980 Galán was elected as councilman for the capital, Bogotá to be named the following year as possible candidate for the presidency of Colombia amid divisions in the Liberal Party that intended to challenge the majorities of the party led by Alfonso López Michelsen and then president Julio César Turbay, but voters leaned for the conservative candidate Belisario Betancur. For Galán it had been a positive outcome despite losing, his party Nuevo Liberalismo had gained a 10% of the total votes, winning 21 of the 23 Department Assemblies and getting reelected as Senator, but he had been criticised by the Liberal party for creating divisions among them and indeed losing the Presidency.

In 1982 Medellin Cartel boss Pablo Escobar tried to infiltrate Galán&#x27;s Nuevo Liberalismo Party. Galán publicly rejected him in front of thousands of his fellow men from Antioquia and Colombia, which angered the cartel, especially Escobar.

Galán continued with his ascendant career, absenting himself from the 1986 presidential race to prevent Liberal Party divisions and running his party as an offspring he was reelected once again as a Senator. This allowed the Liberal Party to regain the Presidency with the election of Virgilio Barco but at a terrible cost for his party that lost 50% of the votes gained in the previous election.

It was only until the mediation of former president Julio César Turbay that Galán returned to the party in 1987 and intended to win the party nomination for official candidate. Galán was growing impatient with the violence and the corruption the drug cartels led by Pablo Escobar and Gonzalo Rodríguez were imposing in Colombia, which encouraged him to try to support the weakening government by shifting the balance of power away from his dangerous enemies.

The Nuevo Liberalism joined the government and was given the Ministry of Agriculture headed by Gabriel Rosas Vega, and the Liberal Party gained a solid union that consolidated further when Galán won the Liberal Party&#x27;s popular nomination to be the presidential frontrunner. Galán was becoming popular for his open criticism and denunciation of drug cartel violence, as he had promised to extradite drug dealers to the United States. He announced he would run for office on 4 July 1989 in the Tequendama Hotel in Bogotá. After this announcement, his popularity rating skyrocketed to 60%.

Meanwhile, Escobar found some support in Tolima&#x27;s political chief Alberto Santofimio, affiliated also with a faction of the Liberal Party led by Alfonso López Michelsen and with a movement called &quot;Movimiento de Renovación Liberal&quot; (Liberal Renovation Movement), getting himself elected to the Chamber of Representatives as second runner up for Santofimios&#x27; congress candidate Jairo Rojas.

==Death==

According to accounts the first assassination threats were calls made to Galán&#x27;s home telephone number after the Liberal Party convention to nominate an official candidate. Flyers were left in the mailbox threatening to kill or kidnap his children. An attempt to kill Galán with an RPG was thwarted while visiting Medellín on 4 August 1989. The assassination attempt was prevented by men working for Waldemar Franklin Quintero, the commander of the Colombian National Police in Antioquia. Accompanying Quintero and Galán was the mayor of Medellín, Pedro Pablo Peláez; both Peláez and Quintero would be killed within a few weeks of the assassination attempt. After these assassinations, Galán and his family restricted their travels, especially at night.

Later on, Galán&#x27;s staff received information from the Colombian intelligence services advising him of a group of hitmen staying in Bogotá that had the intention of killing him. His staff advised him not to travel to the town of Soacha and that the trip to Valledupar was more suitable since he was also scheduled to travel to nearby Barranquilla to attend a 1990 FIFA World Cup qualification match in which the Colombian national team was going to play. However, Galán changed his mind and ordered his staff to prepare to go to Soacha. On 18 August 1989, Galán, who was being protected by eighteen armed bodyguards, was killed as he walked onto the stage to give a speech in front of 10,000 people in Soacha. At least ten others were wounded in the gunfire. This created a war that both sides did not want, one side being the Colombian Government and the other The Extraditables. Both sides saw deaths at a record toll.

The Colombian drug cartels were worried about the possible approval in congress of an extradition treaty with the United States, and political enemies had feared Galán&#x27;s increasing power would isolate many of them from the voters. According to John Jairo Velásquez a.k.a. &quot;Popeye&quot; and Luis Carlos Aguilar a.k.a. &quot;El Mugre&quot;, former hitmen of Pablo Escobar, the assassination was planned in a farm by Escobar, Gonzalo Rodríguez a.k.a. &quot;El Mexicano&quot;, Liberal political leader Alberto Santofimio and others. Velásquez affirmed that Santofimio had certain influence over Escobar&#x27;s decision making, and he had heard Santofimio say &quot;kill him Pablo, kill him!&quot;. Santofimio told Escobar that if Galán became president, he would extradite Escobar to the United States. Other potential perpetrators were mentioned by a demobilized member of the AUC paramilitary group, &quot;Ernesto Baez&quot;, who testified that the murder of Galán was organized by the Colombian mafia with the participation of corrupt members of the military and the DAS.

==Aftermath==
César Gaviria, who had been Galán&#x27;s debate chief (&quot;Jefe de Debate&quot;) during the campaign, was proclaimed as his successor by Galán&#x27;s family and his supporters inside the Liberal party. He was elected president in 1990.

In 2004, new information in a letter written by one of the hitmen who had infiltrated his escort suggested that Galán&#x27;s assassination was executed with help of corrupt Colombian policemen and some of his own bodyguards, who had been bought off by the drug cartels, including Pablo Escobar and other drug lords. Most of the arrested presumed hitmen were killed in jail or shortly after their release, allegedly to silence them.

On 13 May 2005, a former Justice minister (1974) and congressman of the Colombian Liberal Party, Alberto Santofimio, known for his open connections to Pablo Escobar during the 1980s (Escobar joined Santofimio&#x27;s political movement), was arrested in Armenia and accused of being the intellectual author of Galán&#x27;s murder.

According to the newly extended confession of Escobar&#x27;s former top hitman, John Jairo Velasquez (also known as &quot;Popeye&quot;), Santofimio would have openly suggested Galán&#x27;s murder during a secret meeting, in order to eliminate a political rival and, should Galán ever be elected president, also prevent Escobar&#x27;s likely extradition. Santofimio had been previously questioned and mentioned during the investigation and his involvement was widely rumored, but apparently no direct testimonies of his role had been acquired until recently. Velásquez, who served a 23-year sentence and died in 2020, told the Colombian press that he had initially denied Santofimio&#x27;s participation due to his existing political power at the time. Other new and unspecified evidences would also have contributed to building the case against Santofimio.

On 11 October 2007, Alberto Santofimio was convicted to 24 years in prison. He was later released on appeal in 2008, but in August 2011 the Supreme Court reinstated the conviction and he surrendered himself.

On 25 November 2010 Colombian prosecutors issued an arrest warrant for the ex-director of the Colombian security agency (DAS), Retired Gen. Miguel Maza Márquez, for involvement in Galán&#x27;s murder. The prosecutors claimed that Maza intentionally lightened Galán&#x27;s bodyguard contingent to enable his assassination. The Supreme Court convicted Maza in 2016 and sentenced him to 30 years in prison.

==Family==
Son of Mario Galán Gómez and Cecilia Sarmiento Suárez, Galán was one of their 12 children, the others being: María Lucía, Gabriel, Cecilia, Helena, Elsa, Gloria, Antonio, Juan Daniel, Mario Augusto, Francisco Alberto and María Victoria Galán Sarmiento. He was cousin of former Attorney General of Colombia Alfonso Valdivieso Sarmiento. In 1971 he married journalist Gloria Pachón Castro and had three children Juan Manuel, Claudio Mario and Carlos Fernando.

==Quotes==
Galán was largely influenced by Pierre Teilhard de Chardin&#x27;s ideas and Nikos Kazantzakis&#x27;s books. His father Mario described him as a person fascinated with spirituality, a man with integrity, an individual struggle for knowing one&#x27;s self between good and evil and that the effort to achieve it consisted in the main objective in life, not only individually, but collectively.

«La sensibilidad social del autor, el hombre integral que buscaba y la lucha interna que Kazantzakis padeció y soportó a través de su vida entre el ángel y la bestia, entre la naturaleza interior y superior del hombre, entre el mundo pasional y el espíritu, lo fascinaban dice su padre- la búsqueda de esa trascendencia espiritual y el esfuerzo para realizarlo constituía para Luis Carlos el objetivo de la vida, no solamente en lo individual sino también en lo colectivo».

<text>A blurb is a short promotional piece accompanying a piece of creative work. It may be written by the author or publisher or quote praise from others. Blurbs were originally printed on the back or rear dust jacket of a book. With the development of the mass-market paperback, they were placed on both covers by most publishers. Now they are also found on web portals and news websites. A blurb may introduce a newspaper or a book.

== History==

In the US, the history of the blurb is said to begin with Walt Whitman&#x27;s collection, &quot;Leaves of Grass&quot;. In response to the publication of the first edition in 1855, Ralph Waldo Emerson sent Whitman a congratulatory letter, including the phrase &quot;I greet you at the beginning of a great career&quot;: the following year, Whitman had these words stamped in gold leaf on the spine of the second edition.

The word &quot;blurb&quot; was coined in 1906 by American humorist Gelett Burgess (1866–1951). The October 1906 first edition of his short book &quot;Are You a Bromide?&quot; was presented in a limited edition to an annual trade association dinner. The custom at such events was to have a dust jacket promoting the work and with, as Burgess&#x27; publisher B. W. Huebsch described it, &quot;the picture of a damsel—languishing, heroic, or coquettish—anyhow, a damsel on the jacket of every novel&quot;.

In this case, the jacket proclaimed &quot;YES, this is a &#x27;BLURB&#x27;!&quot; and the picture was of a (fictitious) young woman &quot;Miss Belinda Blurb&quot; shown calling out, described as &quot;in the act of blurbing.&quot; The name and term stuck for any publisher&#x27;s contents on a book&#x27;s back cover, even after the picture was dropped and only the text remained.

In Germany, the blurb is regarded to have been invented by Karl Robert Langewiesche around 1902. In German bibliographic usage, it is usually located on the second page of the book underneath the half title, or on the dust cover.

==Books==
A blurb on a book can be any combination of quotes from the work, the author, the publisher, reviews or fans, a summary of the plot, a biography of the author or simply claims about the importance of the work.

In the 1980s, &quot;Spy&quot; ran a regular feature called &quot;Logrolling in Our Time&quot; which exposed writers who wrote blurbs for one another&#x27;s books.

===Blurb requests===

Prominent writers can receive large volumes of blurb requests from aspiring authors. This has led some writers to turn down such requests as a matter of policy. For example, Gary Shteyngart announced in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; that he would no longer write blurbs, except for certain writers with whom he had a professional or personal connection. Neil Gaiman reports that &quot;Every now and again, I stop doing blurbs... The hiatus lasts for a year or two, and then I feel guilty or someone asks me at the right time, and I relent.&quot; Jacob M. Appel reports that he received fifteen to twenty blurb requests per week and tackles &quot;as many as I can.&quot; 

In acknowledgement of such concerns, Simon &amp; Schuster announced in 2025 that it would not expect authors to solicit blurbs for their books. The publisher was quoted in &quot;The New York Times&quot; as saying that the requesting of blurbs &quot;often rewards connections over talent” and that the practice exacts too much time from authors.

==Film==

Movie blurbs are part of the promotional campaign for films, and usually consist of positive, colorful extracts from published reviews.

Movie blurbs have often been faulted for taking words out of context. &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported:

Chris Beam from &quot;Slate&quot; wrote in an &quot;Explainer&quot; column:

Many examples exist of blurb used in marketing a film being traceable directly back to the film&#x27;s marketing team.

<text>Kortatu was a Basque ska punk band from the Basque Autonomous Community formed in Irun in the summer of 1984.

Kortatu was born in the context of the first democracy years in Spain in 1984. They had a big significance for left-wing basque nationalism (which rejected the new constitutional project) as precursors of a new wave of music: Basque Radical Rock (Rock Radikal Vasco or RRV in Spanish). They reached a huge degree of influence in Basque and Spanish punk, as other bands like La Polla Records, Cicatriz and Eskorbuto became famous in the 80s underground scene. It was a very popular band in Basque Country, and also in the rest of Spain.

==Music style==
Although labeled from the beginning as a &quot;radical Basque rock&quot;, Kortatu tried to fight against any classification, even if political links with Herri Batasuna were evident. They also faced some censorship problems, especially when they tried to add a picture of Spanish monarch Juan Carlos I depicted as a robot. In the five year life span of the band they moved from ska to punk and even hip hop, eventually disbanding the formation after seeing Public Enemy in Paris and creating a bigger project, Negu Gorriak. Although their lyrics also evolved from &quot;party-ska&quot; to &quot;combat-rock&quot; (in their last record all the songs were sung in Basque), their style along the lines of social and political protest stayed intact.

==Influences==
They were clearly influenced by The Clash, in fact, their frontman Fermin Muguruza decided to create a ska punk band after seeing Strummer&#x27;s band in a 1980 gig in Donostia.

==Demos and Tours==
They recorded a demo which included their first three songs in 1985. In the same year, they included those songs in the landmark album known as &quot;Four&#x27;s Album&quot;, because of the sharing with other three new bands: Cicatriz, Jotakie and Kontuz-Hi.

That year they toured first time around all the Basque Country, and also played in Madrid and Barcelona. On May 31, played in Martutene Prison (Donostia) with Barricada. Some months later, Joseba Sarrionandia, a recognized writer and poet who was imprisoned because of his ETA membership, escaped with another prisoner, Iñaki Pikabea, inside a loudspeaker, after a gig by Imanol. Kortatu and Barricada were accused of preparing the escapes, and they were banned from playing in all prisons, but nothing was proved. After that they wrote their best-known song, Sarri Sarri, about the escape of Sarrionandia. In fact, it was a cover, including new lyrics, of Toots &amp; the Maytals´ &quot;Chatty Chatty&quot;.

In 1987, they went across the Iron Curtain to perform in Poland on Róbrege Festival.

==The book==
The book &quot;El estado de las cosas de Kortatu: lucha, fiesta y guerra sucia&quot; (Lengua de Trapo, 2013), translated as &quot;The current state of Kortatu-related things: fight, party and dirty war&quot; was published in December 2013, written by Roberto Herreros and Isidro Lopez. This work offers an analysis of the historical context in which the radical basque rock was developed.

<text>Bao Chunlai (; ; born 17 February 1983) is a retired left-handed badminton player from China.

== Career ==
The tall, powerful Bao ranked among the world&#x27;s leading singles player during the first decade of the 21st century. He was a member of China&#x27;s world champion Thomas Cup (men&#x27;s international) teams in 2004, 2006, 2008, and 2010. Bao won medals at three of the six BWF World Championships that he played in, earning a bronze at the 2003 and 2007 editions, and a silver at the 2006 Championships in Madrid, where he upset first seeded Lee Chong Wei in the quarterfinals before falling to teammate Lin Dan in the final. A frequent finalist in top tier international tournaments, Bao had some difficulty breaking through in them until 2009, his most successful year, which saw him capture the Asian Championships, and the German, Singapore, and Japan Opens. In 2010 he upset his superbly accomplished compatriot Lin Dan in the quarterfinals of the prestigious All England Open but was then upset in turn by Japan&#x27;s Kenichi Tago. Bao&#x27;s repeat win that year at the German Open was his last tournament victory on the international circuit.

Bao officially retired from the national team on 21 September 2011. In 2015 he appeared in the sports action film Full Strike.

<text>A white hat (or a white-hat hacker, a whitehat) is an ethical security hacker. Ethical hacking is a term meant to imply a broader category than just penetration testing. Under the owner&#x27;s consent, white-hat hackers aim to identify any vulnerabilities or security issues the current system has. The white hat is contrasted with the black hat, a malicious hacker; this definitional dichotomy comes from Western films, where heroic and antagonistic cowboys might traditionally wear a white and a black hat, respectively. There is a third kind of hacker known as a grey hat who hacks with good intentions but at times without permission.

White-hat hackers may also work in teams called &quot;sneakers and/or hacker clubs&quot;, red teams, or tiger teams.

==History==
One of the first instances of an ethical hack being used was a &quot;security evaluation&quot; conducted by the United States Air Force, in which the Multics operating systems were tested for &quot;potential use as a two-level (secret/top secret) system.&quot; The evaluation determined that while Multics was &quot;significantly better than other conventional systems,&quot; it also had &quot;... vulnerabilities in hardware security, software security and procedural security&quot; that could be uncovered with &quot;a relatively low level of effort.&quot; The authors performed their tests under a guideline of realism, so their results would accurately represent the kinds of access an intruder could potentially achieve. They performed tests involving simple information-gathering exercises, as well as outright attacks upon the system that might damage its integrity; both results were of interest to the target audience. There are several other now unclassified reports describing ethical hacking activities within the US military.

By 1981 &quot;The New York Times&quot; described white-hat activities as part of a &quot;mischievous but perversely positive &#x27;hacker&#x27; tradition&quot;. When a National CSS employee revealed the existence of his password cracker, which he had used on customer accounts, the company chastised him not for writing the software but for not disclosing it sooner. The letter of reprimand stated &quot;The Company realizes the benefit to NCSS and encourages the efforts of employees to identify security weaknesses to the VP, the directory, and other sensitive software in files&quot;.

On October 20, 2016, the Department of Defense (DOD) announced &quot;Hack The Pentagon.&quot;

The idea to bring this tactic of ethical hacking to assess the security of systems and point out vulnerabilities was formulated by Dan Farmer and Wietse Venema. To raise the overall level of security on the Internet and intranets, they proceeded to describe how they were able to gather enough information about their targets to have been able to compromise security if they had chosen to do so. They provided several specific examples of how this information could be gathered and exploited to gain control of the target, and how such an attack could be prevented. They gathered up all the tools they had used during their work, packaged them in a single, easy-to-use application, and gave it away to anyone who chose to download it. Their program called Security Administrator Tool for Analyzing Networks, or SATAN, was met with a great amount of media attention around the world in 1992.

==Tactics==
While penetration testing concentrates on attacking software and computer systems from the start – scanning ports, examining known defects in protocols and applications running on the system, and patch installations, for example – ethical hacking may include other things. A full-scale ethical hack might include emailing staff to ask for password details, rummaging through executive dustbins, usually without the knowledge and consent of the targets. Only the owners, CEOs, and Board Members (stakeholders) who asked for such a security review of this magnitude are aware. To try and replicate some of the destructive techniques a real attack might employ, ethical hackers may arrange for cloned test systems, or organize a hack late at night while systems are less critical. In most recent cases these hacks perpetuate for the long-term con (days, if not weeks, of long-term human infiltration into an organization). Some examples include leaving USB/flash key drives with hidden auto-start software in a public area as if someone lost the small drive and an unsuspecting employee found it and took it.

Some other methods of carrying out these include:

* Disk and memory forensics
* DoS attacks
* Frameworks such as:
** Metasploit
* Network Security
* Reverse engineering
* Security scanners such as:
** Burp Suite
** Nessus
** W3af
* Social engineering tactics such as:
** Phishing
** Pretexting
* Training Platforms
* Vulnerability research

The methods identified exploit known security vulnerabilities and attempt to evade security to gain entry into secured areas. They can do this by hiding software and system &#x27;back-doors&#x27; that can be used as a link to information or access that a non-ethical hacker, also known as &#x27;black hat&#x27; or &#x27;grey hat&#x27;, may want to reach.

==Legality==
===Belgium===
Belgium legalized white hat hacking in February 2023.

=== China ===
In July 2021, the Chinese government moved from a system of voluntary reporting to one of legally mandating that all white hat hackers first report any vulnerabilities to the government before taking any further steps to address the vulnerability or make it known to the public. Commentators described the change as creating a &quot;dual purpose&quot; in which white hat activity also serves the country&#x27;s intelligence agencies.

===United Kingdom===
Struan Robertson, legal director at Pinsent Masons LLP, and editor of OUT-LAW.com says &quot;Broadly speaking, if the access to a system is authorized, the hacking is ethical and legal. If it isn&#x27;t, there&#x27;s an offense under the Computer Misuse Act. The unauthorized access offense covers everything from guessing the password to accessing someone&#x27;s webmail account, to cracking the security of a bank. The maximum penalty for unauthorized access to a computer is two years in prison and a fine. There are higher penalties – up to 10 years in prison – when the hacker also modifies data&quot;. Unauthorized access even to expose vulnerabilities for the benefit of many is not legal, says Robertson. &quot;There&#x27;s no defense in our hacking laws that your behavior is for the greater good. Even if it&#x27;s what you believe.&quot;

==Employment==

The United States National Security Agency offers certifications such as the CNSS 4011. Such a certification covers orderly, ethical hacking techniques and team management. Aggressor teams are called &quot;red&quot; teams. Defender teams are called &quot;blue&quot; teams. When the agency recruited at DEF CON in 2020, it promised applicants that &quot;If you have a few, shall we say, &quot;indiscretions&quot; in your past, don&#x27;t be alarmed. You shouldn&#x27;t automatically assume you won&#x27;t be hired&quot;.

A good &quot;white hat&quot; is a competitive skillful employee for an enterprise since they can be a countermeasure to find the bugs to protect the enterprise network environment. Therefore, a good &quot;white hat&quot; could bring unexpected benefits in reducing the risk across systems, applications, and endpoints for an enterprise.

Recent research has indicated that white-hat hackers are increasingly becoming an important aspect of a company&#x27;s network security protection. Moving beyond just penetration testing, white hat hackers are building and changing their skill sets, since the threats are also changing. Their skills now involve social engineering, mobile tech, and social networking.

<text>The Invasion of the Kuril Islands () was the World War II Soviet military operation to capture the Kuril Islands from Japan in 1945. The invasion, part of the Soviet–Japanese War, was decided on when plans to land on Hokkaido were abandoned. The successful military operations of the Red Army at Mutanchiang and during the invasion of South Sakhalin created the necessary prerequisites for invasion of the Kuril Islands.

==Battle==
The operation took place between 18 August and 1 September. The attack was made by the 87th Rifle Corps (Guards Lieutenant General A. S. Ksenofontov) of the 16th Army (Lieutenant General Leonty Cheremisov) from the 2nd Far Eastern Front, and elements of the Kamchatka Defense Area (Major General Alexey Gnechko commanding). Ships and transportation were drawn from the Petropavlovsk military base (Captain Dmitry Ponomarev). The 128th Aviation Division also provided support.

The islands were occupied by the Japanese 91st Infantry Division (Shiashkotan, Paramushir, Shumshu, and Onekotan), 42nd Division (Simushir), 41st Independent Regiment (Matua), 129th Independent Brigade (Urup), and 89th Infantry Division (Iturup and Kunashir). The Japanese commander was Lieutenant General Fusaki Tsutsumi.

Initial reconnaissance was undertaken on 18 August by a detachment of the 113th Separate Rifle Brigade (Captain-Lieutenant G. I. Brunshtein), carried by two mine trawlers (ТЩ-589 and ТЩ-590) to Rubetzu Bay on Iturup island. The landings on Iturup were continued by the 355th Rifle Division, which also landed on the smaller island of Urup.

On 23 August, the 20,000-strong Japanese garrisons on the islands were ordered to surrender as part of the general surrender of Japan. However, some of the garrison forces ignored this order and continued to resist Soviet occupation.

From 22 to 28 August, troops of the Kamchatka Defense Area occupied the Kuril Islands from Urup north.

On 1 September, elements of the 87th Rifle Corps were landed by torpedo boats, mine trawlers and transports (departing from Otomari) on Kunashir and Shikotan in the southern Kuril Islands. This was an assault landing against Japanese resistance. On 4 September, 87th Rifle Corps occupied five smaller islands (Sibotzu, Taraku-Shima, Uri-Shima, Akiuri, and Suiseto).

After 4 September, Soviet forces occupied the rest of the Kuril Islands without further resistance.

The islands remained part of Russia after the dissolution of the Soviet Union, but their true legal status remains in question as part of the Kuril Islands dispute between Russia, Japan, and other parties.

<text>Dunstan Thompson (1918–1975) was an American poet who lived in Britain. A Catholic, he wrote openly about gay and wartime experiences.

==Life and career==

Thompson was born in New London, Connecticut, and educated at Harvard University. He edited a magazine, &quot;Vice Versa&quot;. in New York City between 1940 and 1942, with Harry Brown.

Thompson joined the U.S. Army in 1942; his &quot;Poems&quot; (Simon &amp; Schuster) was published in 1943. Borges translated some of his poems into Spanish shortly after. Also in 1942 he published a novel, &quot;The Dove with the Bough of Olive&quot;. After the war he traveled in the Middle East and settled in the United Kingdom. In 1947, he published &quot;Lament for the Sleepwalker&quot;, another book of poetry. A travel book, &quot;The Phoenix in the Desert&quot;, appeared in 1951.

Subsequently, he published little and virtually disappeared from literary circles; a few poems were taken by magazines. &quot;Poems 1950-1974&quot; (1984, Paradigm Press) was a posthumous collection.

Raised Catholic, he returned to Catholicism, which led his partner Philip Trower to convert, starting in 1952. After this a priest gave the couple permission to continue living together but as celibates. This arrangement, celibacy but living with a male partner in the 1950s, has been remarked upon by both gay and Catholic critics of his work.

<text>Westfield Parramatta is a shopping centre in Parramatta, Sydney, Australia.

==History==
The site upon which Westfield Parramatta currently stands has had a long history of retail. In 1933, Grace Bros opened their first Sydney suburban department store on a site on the corner of Church and Argyle Streets. This block, bounded by Aird and Marsden Streets, was predominantly occupied by retail properties and expanded the Parramatta town centre south of the Main Western railway line.

In 1971 planning for the Parramatta retail commenced with the aim of incorporating the existing Grace Bros. store into the first stage development of the new Westfield Parramatta. Development was approved by Parramatta City Council for an expanded retail floor area and a tavern. In the same year the redeveloped Grace Bros featured a food hall, supermarket and a hardware on the ground floor. There was parking spaces for over 2,000 cars in the multi-level carpark.

Westfield Parramatta opened in three stages. Stage one opened in May 1975 and featured Target, Coles, Woolworths and 44 speciality stores. Stage two opened in September 1975 and was the largest shopping centre in Australia at the time. Stage two featured Grace Bros, Waltons and 60 speciality stores. Stage three opened towards the end of 1975 and featured the four screen Village Cinemas complex, Westower Tavern and 14 speciality stores.

The first redevelopment of Westfield Parramatta occurred in 1986 when Village Cinemas was refurbished and 300 stores were added. In 1987 Waltons closed and was replaced by Venture.

In 1989 a proposal to build an underground pedestrian underpass to link the centre with the railway station to ease the passage of commuters to the stores was submitted and subsequently approved.

Westfield Parramatta expanded in 1992 with the purchase of properties on the north side of Aird Street between O’Connell and Marsden Streets and the eastern half of the block bounded by Aird, Marsden, Campbell and O’Connell streets. Parts of the original Westfield Shoppingtown on the corner of Argyle and Marsden Streets, and the northern side of Campbell Street were incorporated into the development. During the excavation in the developments of the sites now occupied by the current Westfield Parramatta involved archaeological digs which uncovered artifacts dating back to the earliest days of Colonial settlement, this revealed the foundations of buildings on what would have been the fringes of Parramatta town in the 19th century reflecting Parramatta&#x27;s history as the second oldest settlement in Australia. In 1993 AMP sold a 50% shareholding. 

Westfield Parramatta was redeveloped in 1996 saw the centre regain its position as the largest shopping centre in Australia, with approximately 127,000m² of retail space (from approximately 80,000m²). This expansion included the development of two separate blocks in the Parramatta CBD west of the main centre. A multi-storey retail air bridge over Marsden Street and Aird Street connected the two new sections to the existing centre&#x27;s levels 3, 4 and 5. Department store David Jones relocated to Westfield Parramatta from its stand alone store on Church Street which was built in 1961 in the north of the Parramatta CBD. David Jones opened in the space previously occupied by Venture in the space next to Grace Bros in the expanded centre. Village Cinemas expanded from a 4 screen complex to an 8 screen complex while a new fresh food market place opened on level 5 outside Coles and a new food court and JB Hi-Fi and opened on level 5 on the upper level previously occupied by Venture.

In 2006, Westfield Parramatta completed a major redevelopment. This redevelopment included a city block east of the existing centre on the corner of Church Street and Argyle Street was developed as a multi-storey cinema and lifestyle complex, connected to the main centre by a pedestrian air bridge at level 4 and an underground retail arcade at level 1. Greater Union (renamed Event Cinemas in 2010) opened an 11 screen complex featuring 3 Gold Class theatres, 1 GMAX theatre and 7 regular movie cinemas replacing the existing Village Cinemas.

At street level beneath the cinemas, and fronting Parramatta&#x27;s Transport Interchange (redeveloped along with Westfield), is a concourse of restaurants and cafes with direct access to the cinemas via an external escalator.

The underground retail arcade links the centre&#x27;s level 1 with Parramatta railway station&#x27;s main concourse as well as the Parramatta Transport Interchange. It provides for an extension of the underground level 1 food court featuring cafes and takeaway food retailers as well as a fresh food market, a mini IGA Express supermarket and second Woolworths Metro supermarket. A feature of the redeveloped food-court are the electronic passenger destination indicator boards for services out of Parramatta railway station. The existing centre saw minor redevelopment of retail areas adjacent to the new pedestrian air bridge as well as an upgraded facade. The expansion added approximately 70 new specialty shops in addition to the cinemas and close to 200 new car spaces. Following the expansion Westfield Parramatta&#x27;s gross retail floor area reached its current size of 137,407m² and near 500 stores

On 30 April 2007 Singapore&#x27;s GIC Real Estate acquired a 50% stake in Westfield Parramatta for $717.5 million over a $1.4 billion deal. In July 2014, as part of a restructure of the Westfield Group, it came under the control of the Scentre Group.

From 2010 and onwards Westfield Parramatta has seen the opening of many new store including Uniqlo which opened on 28 May 2015, Zara which opened on 24 September 2016 and H&amp;M which opened on the space previously occupied by Toys &quot;R&quot; Us on 17 April 2019.

==Future==
In 2014, Scentre and GIC had developed plans to build a 25-storey office development on the corner of Argyle and Church Street for up to 35,000m² of commercial space. However in August 2018 plans for the 25 storey tower to reach 42 storeys with 112,000m² of commercial space scheduled to cost $425 million. The proposed building will be moved further to the west on Argyle Street about midway between Church and Marsden streets and above Myer to avoid demolition of the existing five-storey retail podium at the corner block where the original plans were approved for. The space occupied by Myer will be reconfigured to accommodate the tower.

The main office lobby and entrance will also be relocated from Church Street to Argyle Street.

A two storey open-air terrace has been proposed on the roof of the podium and would be integrated with the approved additional retail level with cafés and retail outlets have been proposed for the rooftop area.

==Tenants==
Westfield Parramatta has 137,236m² of floor space. The major retailers include Aldi, Best &amp; Less, Club Lime, Coles, Cotton On Body, Cotton On Kids, Daiso, David Jones, Dymocks, Event Cinemas, H&amp;M, JB Hi-Fi, JD Sports, Kmart, Myer, Rebel, Target, Timezone, Uniqlo, Woolworths, Woolworths Metro and Zara.

==Transport==
The North Shore &amp; Western, Leppington &amp; Inner West and Cumberland Line offer frequent services to Westfield Parramatta.

Westfield Parramatta has bus connections to the Sydney CBD, Inner West Northern Sydney and Greater Western Sydney, as well as local surrounding suburbs. It is served by Busways, CDC NSW and Transit Systems. The majority of its bus services are located opposite Parramatta station or on Argyle Street.

Westfield Parramatta also has multi level car parks with 4,661 spaces.

==Incidents and accidents==
* On 3 July 2003, a man committed suicide by jumping off the third floor of the shopping centre. Half an hour later, the deceased body of a second male was located on the rooftop near the northern end of the building. Authorities believe the deaths were connected, with homicide detectives ruling out the possibility of a murder-suicide.
* On 25 March 2012 a 34 year old man was shot by police after a hijacking incident which led a police chase from Penrith down the M4 and tried to hijack a taxi before stealing a car from the carpark of the Nepean Hospital and being chased by police towards the motorway. He then crashed into a Mitsubishi Lancer before stealing it from a motorist at knifepoint. A police helicopter tracked the man as he sped along the motorway towards Parramatta. He drove into the Westfield carpark but was chased towards the centre&#x27;s food court area. An officer caught up with the man and the two fought violently before the man produced a weapon and the officer shot him. The man was declared dead a short time later after paramedics were unable to revive him. Sections of the centre were immediately locked down at 4pm as dozens of police converged on the building. The incident happened not far from a JB Hi-Fi and store employees reported hearing what sounded like an argument outside.
* On 7 July 2014 a man was stabbed to death outside a Myer store at 10:30am. A 33 year old man was arrested at the scene after he took off his shirt and waited for police to arrive.
* On 14 May 2019 a woman fell to her death with police called to the centre around 1pm. Many of the areas in the centre were taped off around 3pm.
* On 23 December 2019 balloons filled with trivial freebies such as coffee vouchers, free parking, gift cards and discount cards sparked a wild stampede amongst the 150 Christmas shoppers as part of the 33 hour non-stop trade promotion. 12 people were treated on scene with a further 5 taken to hospital for further treatment.
* On 4 March 2020 a person was threatened with a knife inside Woolworths over toilet paper. The incident occurred at 1:30pm and staff and police had blocked off access to the toilet paper aisle.

<text>The Institut National Agronomique Paris-Grignon (; INA P-G) was a French university-level institution of grande école-type. It offered master&#x27;s degree in agricultural- and life sciences. It was created in 1971 by merging the &quot;Institut national agronomique&quot; (Paris) and the &quot;École nationale supérieure d&#x27;Agronomie de Grignon&quot;, thus having a history that goes back to 1826.

INA P-G disappeared as an administrative entity on 1 January 2007, along with ENSIA and ENGREF, to create AgroParisTech.

* Jardin botanique de l&#x27;Institut National

== History ==
The Institut national agronomique Paris Grignon results from the merger, in 1971, of the National Agronomic Institute of Paris and the National School of Agronomy of Grignon. The Institute became “AgroParisTech” in 2007. 

The National Agronomic School of Grignon is a school founded in 1826 which was successively a royal institution for agriculture, a regional school of agriculture, then a national school of agronomy. The vocation has remained unchanged: to train specialists in agricultural sciences. The diploma it issues was granted the title of engineer in 1908. The school was then integrated into the National Agronomic Institute Paris-Grignon (INA P-G) in 1971. This is the oldest French agronomy school.

<text>Fuji Bikes is a brand of bicycles and cycling equipment currently owned by Advanced Sports International. The company is a descendant of , a bicycle manufacturer originally established in Japan in 1899. The company took its name and logo from Mount Fuji, a Japanese symbol of strength and endurance.

==History==

===1899 to 1998===

The company was founded in 1899 in Japan by Okazaki Kyūjirō. In 1900 it was established under the trade name Nichibei Shōkai (literally &#x27;Japanese-American Trading Company&#x27;). At first, it was importing and distributing US-products, but later it began bicycle production in Japan. 

By the late 1920s, Fuji was Japan’s most popular bicycle. In the 1930s, Fuji established the first national stage race between Osaka and Tokyo and sponsored the winning team. Today, this race remains a premier race in Asia. The first Asian games were held in New Delhi in 1951. Shoichiro Sugihara, riding a Fuji, won the first race.

During World War II the company name was changed to Dainippon Cycle, which after the war was changed back to Nichibei Fuji Cycle Company. 

In the 1950s, Toshoku America acquired distribution rights to Fuji-made bicycles in the United States. Toshoku America sold private-label Fuji-made bicycles as house brands through U.S. retailers such as Sears &amp; Roebuck and Montgomery Wards.

During this period, Fuji became a partner with several contractors supplying parts for Japanese bicycles, including Sugino Cycle Industries and SunTour. Sales expanded into other Asian markets. At the 1964 Tokyo Olympics, Fuji&#x27;s chief engineer and designer, Dr Shoichiro Sugihara, designed the Japanese national team bicycles and was team coach. He repeated this role at the 1968 Olympics in Mexico and the 1972 Olympics in Munich, Germany.

By 1971, Fuji America was established to distribute models across the United States. Fuji played a part in the cycling boom of the 1970s. It introduced the first successful mass-production 12-speed bicycle in the mid-1970s, using a redesigned rear axle to minimize spoke dish to maintain wheel strength. In 1974, Richard Ballantine, author of Richard&#x27;s Bicycle Book, recommended Fuji road bicycles at or near the top of each of four price and quality categories, from basic (low-price) to professional (high-end).

During the early 1980s, Fuji developed touring bicycles, and in 1986 was one of the first to manufacture frames of titanium. Fuji was not well situated to take advantage of the mountain bike boom of the 1980s. The demand for mountain bikes caused a steep decline in touring and road bike sales. This allowed manufacturers such as Specialized, Giant, and Trek to make inroads into Fuji&#x27;s share of U.S. bicycle sales, often using frames produced at lower cost in Taiwan.

With the continued rise of the yen, Fuji fell on hard times in the early 1990s. One of the last Japanese bike companies to shift production to Taiwan after the fall of the dollar, Fuji bicycles cost more in the United States than most competing brands, causing a drop in sales. Fuji bicycles produced in Taiwan were not as well regarded by U.S. buyers as the Japanese-built bicycles. The company eventually designed new models, taking advantage of modern improvements in materials and construction techniques, but this proved insufficient. Toshoku America filed for bankruptcy in 1997, and in 1998, Nichibei Fuji Cycle Company Ltd., Fuji America&#x27;s parent company, also declared bankruptcy.

===Bankruptcy and Purchase===

The assets of Fuji America, as well as the worldwide distribution rights to the Fuji bicycle brand, was purchased by Philadelphia-based Advanced Sports International. 

In 2004, Ideal Bike Corporation, Taiwan&#x27;s third-largest complete-bicycle maker, acquired 17% of Advanced Sports International Asia, which markets the Fuji brand of bicycles in Asia. Fuji bicycles are now built in Taichung, Taiwan; Dong Guan, Guangdong Province, China; and in Kutno, Poland by Ideal Bike Corporation.

In November 2018 ASE (the parent company of ASI) declared bankruptcy, leaving the fate of US distribution of Fuji bicycles uncertain. Originally 
HEAD was set to buy ASE&#x27;s assets, but the deal was abandoned weeks later. On February 1, 2019 it was reported that three entities won the auction for ASE and would divide its assets among themselves. One of these, BikeCo, a partnership of Tiger Capital Group and Advanced Holdings, received ASI and its bicycle brands including Fuji.

==Sponsored teams and riders==
From 2015-2017 Fuji sponsored the UCI Continental Circuits Caja Rural-Seguros Cycling Team. Previously, until the end of 2014, Fuji sponsored and equipped the UCI Continental Circuits NetApp Endura, which rode the Fuji Altamira Road Bike and Fuji D-6 1.0 Time Trial bike. Riders of NetApp Endura also worked with the Fuji design team in the development of the Fuji Transonic Aero Road Bike. Fuji also sponsors U.S. triathlete Matt Reed.

<doc id="907259" wikidata="Q16986295" url="?curid=907259" title="Initiatives and referendums in the United States">
<text>In the politics of the United States, the process of initiatives and referendums allow citizens of many U.S. states to place legislation on the ballot for a referendum or popular vote, either enacting new legislation, or voting down existing legislation. Citizens, or an organization, might start a popular initiative to gather a predetermined number of signatures to qualify the measure for the ballot. The measure is placed on the ballot for the referendum, or actual vote.

Initiatives and referendums, along with recall elections and popular primary elections, were signature reforms from the Progressive Era (1896–1917) when people sought to moderate the power of parties and political bosses. These powers are written into several state constitutions, particularly in the West. Initiatives and referendums constitute a form of direct democracy. As of 2024, these processes are only available at state levels, and do not exist for federal legislation.

The technical name of these types of votes used internationally is referendum, but within the United States they are commonly known as ballot measures, propositions or ballot questions. The term referendum in the United States normally refers specifically to questions about striking down enacted law, known internationally as the popular referendum.

== History ==
The Progressive Era was a period marked by reforms aimed at breaking the concentrated power, or monopoly, of certain corporations and trusts. Many Progressives believed that state legislatures were part of this problem and that they were essentially &quot;in the pocket&quot; of certain wealthy interests. They sought a method to counter this—a way in which average persons could become directly involved in the political process. One of the methods they came up with was the initiative and referendum. Through 2006, 2,231 statewide initiatives were held in the United States, of which 887 were successful.

Because US states with direct democracy require each signature to be witnessed and notarized by a circulator, gathering the required signatures usually costs millions of dollars in the larger states, to hire circulators. This means that the process, as with state legislatures described above, is also &quot;in the pocket&quot; of certain wealthy interests.

In 2021, in Boulder, Colorado, the first official online petition system was used to get an initiative on the ballot, with no circulators involved at &quot;petitions.bouldercolorado.gov&quot;.

The voters of the city of Boulder approved a charter amendment allowing online petitioning by a vote of 71% to 29% in 2018. The proposal was developed by members of the city&#x27;s Campaign Finance and Elections Working Group, spearheaded by Evan Ravitz and Steve Pomerance.

== Types of initiatives and referendums ==
Initiatives and referendums—collectively known as &quot;ballot measures&quot;, &quot;propositions&quot;, or simply &quot;questions&quot;—differ from most legislation passed by representative democracies; ordinarily, an elected legislative body develops and passes laws. Initiatives and referendums, by contrast, allow citizens to vote directly on legislation.

In many U.S. states, ballot measures may originate by several different processes: Overall, 26 US states have initiative and/or veto referendum processes at the statewide level, and all states have at least one form of legislatively referred processes: 49 states have at least a legislatively referred process to amend their constitutions, and one state, Delaware, has a possibility of legislatively referred ballot measures to pass new statutes only. In all of these states except Delaware, to modify the state constitution, at least one form of ballot measure is mandatory, under sometimes greatly different processes from state to state, either for directly voting on a proposed modification, or voting on a ballot measure for choosing to call or not for the election of a state convention charged of modifying the state constitution. 
Washington, D.C., also has initiative and veto referendum processes. Additionally, multiple forms of direct democracy also exists at the local level, including in some states that otherwise do not have these forms of direct democracy at the state level, the availability of direct democracy measures at the local level varying by jurisdiction depending on state and local laws.

=== Initiatives ===
An initiative is a means through which any citizen or organization may gather a predetermined number of signatures to qualify a measure to be placed on a ballot, and to be voted upon in a future election (These may be further divided into constitutional amendments and statutory initiatives. Statutory initiatives typically require fewer signatures to qualify to be placed on a future ballot.).

Initiatives can also be indirect, which means that after sufficient signatures to place a measure on the ballot are collected, the measure is first considered by a state or local legislative body. If the legislative body elects not to pass the proposed new law within a prescribed window of opportunity, the initiative must then be placed on the ballot. The details of the process vary by state. For example, in some states, another round of signatures is required to qualify an initiative for the ballot if the legislature does not approve it. In others, if the legislature passes a law determined to be substantially similar to the initiative, it precludes an election on the original initiative proposal, while in others the legislature must pass the initiative unaltered or it goes to the voters.

==== Initiated state constitutional amendment ====

An initiated constitutional amendment is an amendment to a state&#x27;s constitution that results from petitioning by a state&#x27;s citizens. By utilizing this initiative process, citizens can propose and vote on constitutional amendments directly, without need of legislative referral. When a sufficient number of citizens have signed a petition requesting it, a proposed constitutional amendment is then put to the vote.

In the United States, while no court or legislature needs to approve a proposal or the resultant initiated constitutional amendment, such amendments may be overturned if they are challenged and a court confirms that they are unconstitutional. Most states that permit the process require a 2/3 majority vote.

Not all amendments proposed will receive sufficient support to be placed on the ballot. Of the 26 proposed petitions filed in the state of Florida in its 1994 general election, only three garnered sufficient support to be put to the vote.

==== Indirect initiated state constitutional amendment ====
The initiative process, for proposing constitutional amendments, may also, like for state statutes, be &quot;direct&quot; or &quot;indirect&quot;. Among the 18 states that provide for citizen-initiated constitutional amendments, Massachusetts and Mississippi are the only two states with indirect initiated state constitutional amendment.

In Massachusetts, if enough signatures are submitted for an initiated constitutional amendment, the initiative first goes to the legislature where it must garner approval in two successive legislative sessions from one-quarter of state senators and representatives voting together in a joint session. Massachusetts is the only state to have such a requirement for initiated constitutional amendments.

Before 2021 in Mississippi, if enough signatures were collected and submitted, the legislature had to either: approve the measure; ignore the measure (but it does not annul the measure, it still goes to the ballot); voting against the measure without providing for an alternative (but it does not annul the measure, it still goes to the ballot); or approve an alternative amendment to appear on the ballot alongside the original citizen proposal as a competing measure. In the cases when both of the contradicting measures were approved by voters, the measure with the most votes was the one that became law.

A May 2021 decision by the Mississippi Supreme Court nullified a voter-passed initiative that permitted medical marijuana in the state, with the 6–3 majority citing a fundamental flaw in the state&#x27;s constitutional process that was viewed by media as effectively banning future use of indirect initiatives in the amendment process, barring a future constitutional amendment. The indirect initiative process, added to the state&#x27;s constitution in the 1990s as Article 15, Section 273(3), requires that over a 1-year period, the sponsors obtain a total number of signatures equal to at least 12% of the total number of votes cast for governor in the state&#x27;s last election for that office. Additionally, it requires that no more than 20% of the signatures required to place an initiative on the ballot come from any single congressional (i.e., U.S. House) district. At the time the indirect initiative process passed, Mississippi had five congressional districts, but the state lost one House seat in the reapportionment that followed the 2000 United States Census. In the majority decision, Justice Josiah Coleman wrote, &quot;Whether with intent, by oversight, or for some other reason, the drafters of section 273(3) wrote a ballot-initiative process that cannot work in a world where Mississippi has fewer than five representatives in Congress. To work in today&#x27;s reality, it will need amending—something that lies beyond the power of the Supreme Court.&quot; Coleman added that from 2003 to 2015, the legislature had attempted six times to place an amendment on the ballot that would have changed the process to reflect Mississippi&#x27;s current (and presumably future) House apportionment, but all attempts died in committee.

=== Referendum ===

Called Popular referendum, or alternatively Veto Referendum, Citizen referendum, Statute referendum, Statute remand, People&#x27;s veto, or Citizen&#x27;s veto, in which a predetermined number of signatures (typically lower than the number required for an initiative) qualifies a ballot measure for voting on repealing or not a specific state law. 23 states allow for citizens to initiate popular referendums, and one territory, the U.S. Virgin Islands.
The popular referendum was first introduced in the United States by South Dakota in 1898, and first used in 1906 in Oregon, two years after the first initiative was used in 1904, also in Oregon.

=== Legislative referral ===

Legislative referral (aka &quot;legislative referendum&quot;, or &quot;referendum bill&quot; in the state of Washington for legislatively referred state statute), in which the legislature puts proposed legislation up for popular vote (either voluntarily or, in the case of a constitutional amendment, as an obligatory part of the procedure). With the exception of Delaware, 49 US states allow legislatively referred state constitutional amendments.

=== Statute affirmation ===
Nevada is the only state to allow for statute affirmation. The statute affirmation allows the voters to collect signatures to place on ballot a question asking the state citizens to affirm a standing state law. If a majority vote to affirm the law, the state legislature will be barred from ever amending the law, and it can be amended or repealed only if approved by a majority of state citizens in a direct vote.

=== Automatic referrals ===
An automatic referral is question that is legally required to automatically be placed on the ballot. Many states have laws in their constitution requiring a question to hold a constitutional convention to appear before the voters after a scheduled amount of time.

=== Agricultural referendums ===
The United States Code requires national referendums before the authorization of marketing quotas for certain agricultural products including wheat, maize, milk, and rice. The responsibility of conducting these referendums is with the Secretary of Agriculture, and eligibility to vote is limited to producers of the agricultural product in question.

A similar referendum system is in place for fishing quotas in both the New England and Gulf fishery management councils.

== Referendum law by state ==
*The District of Columbia does not have a Constitution, however it does have a Charter which can be amended by Referral to the Ballot by the City Council followed by Congressional approval

**Citizen Initiated Amendments in Mississippi cannot qualify for the ballot so long as the state has four Congressional Districts due to a signature distribution provision requiring votes from five Congressional Districts

== Objections to the system ==
The initiative and referendums process have critics. Some argue that initiatives and referendums undermine representative government by circumventing the elected representatives of the people and allowing the people to directly make policy: they fear excessive majoritarianism (tyranny of the majority) as a result, believing that minority groups may be harmed.

Other criticisms are that competing initiatives with conflicting provisions can create legal difficulties when both pass; and that when the initiatives are proposed before the end of the legislative session, the legislature can make statutory changes that weaken the case for passing the initiative. Yet another criticism is that as the number of required signatures has risen in tandem with populations, &quot;initiatives have moved away from empowering the average citizen&quot; and toward becoming a tool for well-heeled special interests to advance their agendas. John Diaz wrote in an editorial for the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; in 2008:

In some cases, voters have passed initiatives that were subsequently repealed or drastically changed by the legislature. For instance, legislation passed by the voters as an Arizonan medical cannabis initiative was subsequently gutted by the Arizona legislature. To prevent such occurrences, initiatives are sometimes used to amend the state constitution and thus prevent the legislature from changing it without sending a referendum to the voters; however, this produces the problems of inflexibility mentioned above. Accordingly, some states are seeking a middle route. For example, Colorado&#x27;s Referendum O would require a two-thirds vote for the legislature to change statutes passed by the voters through initiatives, until five years after such passage. This would allow the legislature to easily make uncontroversial changes.

An objection not so much to the initial concept, but to its present implementations, is that signature challenges are becoming a political tool, with state officials and opposing groups litigating the process, rather than simply taking the issue fight to voters. Signatures can be declared void based on technical omissions, and initiatives can be thrown out based on statistical samplings of signatures. Supporters lacking necessary funds to sustain legal battles can find their initiative taken off the ballot.
Legislatures themselves may tighten already arduous requirements. E.g., while California or Oregon typically have dozens of ballot measures each year, Idaho has had 28 since the 1930s, of which twelve passed. The Idaho Legislature in 2013 however increased the geographical requirements for putting an initiative on the ballot after a trio of unpopular education laws (&quot;Students Come First&quot;) were repealed by the voters. Despite the new requirement of the signatures of 6% of the registered voters in 18 of Idaho&#x27;s 35 legislative districts before May, as of mid-April 2018 the drive to put the Medicaid gap before the voters on the November ballot (by way of their amending the state constitution, yea or nay) was well on its way to gathering the prerequisite number of signatures in the prerequisite number of legislative districts, much to the surprise of pundits. Ultimately the organizers had by the April 30 deadline delivered 60,000 signatures to county clerks&#x27; offices, which if verified are far more than the 56,192 required.

&quot;The New York Times&quot; reported in May 2021 that so far that year, Republicans had introduced 144 bills to restrict initiatives in 32 states, 19 of which had been signed into law by nine Republican governors. Although initiatives had historically been used by both parties, Democrats had been especially successful using the process in recent years in states where they do not control the state government. In three states, Republican legislators asked voters to approve initiatives that would restrict their right to bring and pass future initiatives.

==Proposed reforms==
Some proposed reforms include paying signature gatherers by the hour, rather than by the signature (to reduce incentives for fraud) and increasing transparency by requiring major financial backers of initiatives to be disclosed to potential signatories. Other proposals include having a &quot;cooling-off&quot; period after an initiative qualifies, in which the legislature can make the initiative unnecessary by passing legislation acceptable to the initiative&#x27;s sponsors. It has also been proposed that proxy voting be combined with initiative and referendum to form a hybrid of direct democracy and representative democracy.

=== Ludlow Amendment ===

The Ludlow Amendment was a proposed constitutional amendment drafted by Indiana congressman Louis Ludlow allowing for a referendum after a congressional declaration of war. It reached its peak public approval rating in the 1930s in an effort to maintain American isolationism in the years before the Second World War.

=== National initiative ===

The national initiative is a proposal to amend the United States Constitution to allow ballot initiatives at the federal level.

=== Citizens&#x27; Initiative Review ===
Healthy Democracy, and a similar organization in Washington State, proposed a Citizens&#x27; Initiative Review process. This brings together a representative cross-section of voters as a citizens&#x27; jury to question and hear from advocates and experts regarding a ballot measure; then deliberate and reflect together to come up with statements that support and/or oppose the measure. The state would organize such a review of each ballot measure, and include the panelists&#x27; statements in the voters&#x27; pamphlet. Since 2009, Healthy Democracy has led efforts to develop and refine the Citizens&#x27; Initiative Review process for use by Oregon voters.

In 2011, the Oregon Legislature approved House Bill 2634, legislation making the Citizens&#x27; Initiative Review a permanent part of Oregon elections. This marked the first time a legislature has made voter deliberation a formalized part of the election process. The CIR is a benchmark in the initiative reform and public engagement fields.

Each state has individual requirements to qualify initiatives for the ballot. Generally, all 24 states and the District of Columbia follow steps similar to:
# File a proposed petition with a designated state official
# State review of the proposal and, in several states, a review of the language of the proposal
# Prepare ballot title and summary
# Petition circulation to obtain the required number of signatures
# Petition submitted to state election officials to verify the signatures and qualify the ballot entry

<text>Ingush (, pronounced ), historically known as &quot;Durdzuks&quot;, &quot;Gligvi&quot; and &quot;Kists&quot;, are a Northeast Caucasian ethnic group mainly inhabiting the Republic of Ingushetia in central Caucasus, but also inhabitanting Prigorodny District and town of Vladikavkaz of modern day North-Ossetia. The Ingush are predominantly Sunni Muslims and speak the Ingush language.

== Ethnonym ==
=== Ingush ===
The ethnonym of the &quot;Ingush&quot; came from the name of the medieval Ghalghai village (&quot;aul&quot;) of Angusht, which by the end of the 17th century was a large village in the Tarskoye Valley. The toponym &quot;Angusht&quot; itself is a composition of three words: &quot;an&quot; (&quot;sky&quot; or &quot;horizon&quot;), &quot;gush&quot; (&quot;visible&quot;) and the suffix of place &quot;tĕ&quot; (indication of position or location), literally translating as a &quot;place where the horizon is seen&quot;.

=== Ghalghai ===
The endonym of Ingush people is &quot;Ghalghai&quot; (, ), which most often is associated with the word &quot;ghāla&quot; (&quot;гIала&quot;), meaning &quot;tower&quot; or &quot;fortress&quot; and the plural form of the suffix of person, &quot;gha&quot; (&quot;гIа&quot;), thus, translates as &quot;people/inhabitants of towers&quot;, though according to some researchers the ethnonym has a more ancient origin. Some scholars associate it with the ancient Gargareans and Gelae mentioned in the 1st century in the work of the ancient historian and geographer Strabo. In Georgian sources, in the form of Gligvi, it is mentioned as an ethnonym that existed during the reign of Mirian I, as well as the ruler of Kakheti Kvirike III. In Russian sources, &quot;Ghalghaï&quot; first becomes known in the second half of the 16th century, in the form of &quot;Kalkans/Kolkans&quot;, &quot;Kalkan people&quot;.

== History ==
=== Ancient history ===

In the 4th-3rd millennium BC in the North Caucasus, archaeological cultures of the early Bronze Age are spreading: Maykop and Kuro-Araxes. The territory of Ingushetia is located in the zone of their intersection and part of the early Bronze Age monuments found here has a characteristic syncretic appearance (for example, the Lugovoe settlement). With these cultures, several cultures are genetically linked, which were formed in the subsequent Middle Bronze Age and received in science the general name &quot;&quot;. In turn, on the basis of the cultures of the North Caucasian cultural and historical community, an ancient culture of the North Caucasian autochthonous peoples developed – the Koban culture, the chronological framework of which is usually determined by the 12th-4th centuries BC. It is with the tribes of the Koban culture that it is customary to link the ethnogenesis of the Proto-Ingush ethnic groups. In the written Georgian sources describing the events of this period, the ancestors of the Ingush (tribes of the Koban culture) are known under the ethnonym &quot;Caucasians&quot; and &quot;Dzurdzuks&quot;, in ancient ones – under the name &quot;Makhli&quot;. In the second half of the 1st millennium BC, Koban tribes created a large political union of tribes, known from ancient sources under the name Malkh (Makhli, Makhelonia), according to Georgian sources – &quot;Dzurdzuketi&quot;. The Dzurdzuks controlled the main Caucasian passage, the Darial Gorge, and had close political ties with the ancient Georgian state. According to Leonti Mroveli, the first king of Georgia, Pharnavaz, was married to a woman &quot;from the tribe of Dzurdzuks, descendants of the Caucasus&quot; and they had a son, Saurmag (, &quot;dragon&quot;). He ascended the Georgian throne after the death of his father Pharnavaz I of, and upon learning that the Georgian &quot;eristavis&quot; wanted to kill him, he and his mother took refuge with his maternal uncles in Dzurdzuketi. According to the ancient writer Lucian, the name of one of the rulers of the political association of the ancient Kobans is Adirmakh, whose name the Abkhaz researcher Gumba G. D. etymologizes with the help of the Ingush language as &quot;the owner of the power of the sun&quot;. At the beginning of the 2nd century BC as a result of the military invasion of the North Caucasus by the Seleucid king Antiochus III, the political union of the Koban tribes was defeated. As a result of its collapse, common Koban names cease to be used in the sources, and later, in the 1st century BC – 1st century AD, the descendants of the Kobans are known in the sources under the names of individual tribal groups: &quot;Khamekits&quot;, &quot;Serbs&quot;, &quot;Dvals&quot;, &quot;Sanars/Tsanars&quot;, &quot;Masakhs/Mashakhs&quot;, &quot;Isadiks&quot;, and others.

The ethnonym &quot;Gargareans&quot; is associated with the tribes of the Koban culture, which is mentioned by the ancient Greek geographer Strabo in his work &quot;Geographica&quot; in 1st century AD as a North Caucasian people living next to the Amazons. They are connected with the Ingush by several scholars. Strabo also mentioned Gelae which are like wise Gargareans, also connected with Ingush by several scholars.

In the 7th century, in the well-known chronicle, &quot;Ashkharhatsuyts&quot;, the Ingush were mentioned under the ethnonym &quot;Kusts&quot; (Kists).

In Georgian sources, the Ingush (Galgaï) are mentioned in the form of Gligvi during the reign of Mirian I (1st century), and also during the reign of the ruler of Kakheti, Kvirike III, in the 11th century.

=== Middle Ages ===

In the late 9th – early 13th centuries, the history of the Ingush was closely connected with the Alans their kingdom, Alania, to which the Ingush belonged. It&#x27;s known that the population of Alania was diverse and included Ingush. According to Ingush researchers, the capital of Alania – the city of Magas was located on the territory of Ingushetia in the area covering part of the modern cities of Magas, Nazran and the villages of Yandare, Gazi-Yurt, Ekazhevo, Ali-Yurt and Surkhakhi, that is, in the area where numerous monuments of the Alanian time are located. On the designated territory there are a number of Alanian settlements. The researchers noted that many settlements here are located in groups or &quot;nests&quot; within sight. In some of these groups, as a rule, one of the central settlements stands out for its large size, fortification and complexity of planning, to which less significant ones gravitate. The &quot;nested&quot; location of the settlements is associated with strong tribal remnants in the respective society. According to , this area of the group of monuments is one of the largest in the North Caucasus.

In 1238–1240 the plain of the North Caucasus was conquered by the Mongol-Tatars and included in the Ulus of Jochi. In 1395, the association of the Alans was finally destroyed during the campaign against the North Caucasus by Tamerlane, and the remaining population retreated to the mountains. The collapse of Alania and the outflow to the mountains of its population, which was entrenched to the east and west of the Darial by building fortresses, served as the basis for the formation of new ethnoterritorial communities, which in turn led to the formation of modern North Caucasian peoples.

Villages located in the mountainous zone were grouped mainly along local gorges, which contributed to their ethnopolitical consolidation into separate territorial groups/districts – communities (). By the end of the 16th century, the main territorial societies of the Ingush had already formed. Based on the data of Russian sources of the 16th–17th centuries, naming several territorial societies of the Ingush, it is concluded that in Ingushetia and in the 15th century there were approximately the same number of political formations (shahar societies), each of which united several villages.

From the west, starting from the Darial Gorge, to the east, existes several Ingush societies, such as: Dzherakh (&quot;Erokhan people&quot;), Kistins, Fyappins, or Metskhalins, Chulkhoy, Khamkhins (&quot;Kyakalins&quot;), Tsorins, Akkins, Orstkhoy, and to the south of them, the societies of Merzhoy, Tsechoy, Galai. To the southeast of the Tsorins was the society of Malkhins.

Over time, the number and boundaries of societies changed, this happened as a result of migration processes of the Ingush-speaking population, including those associated with the return of the Ingush to the plane (plain). They began quite early, soon after Timur left the North Caucasus. At a very early stage, they were in the nature of individual military-political actions undertaken by the Ingush on the plain lands in order to counteract the consolidation of alien nomadic peoples on them. Separate episodes associated with this time are reflected in one of the Ingush legends, recorded in the 19th century by ethnographer Albast Tutaev, where representatives of the Galgaï Society of Mountainous Ingushetia appear. Also, the people&#x27;s memory has preserved the most important episodes from the events associated with the development of plain lands. In particular, the legend recorded in the mountain village of Pkhamat by I.A. Dakhkilgov, tells how eminent men of several territorial communities of mountainous Ingushetia gathered to unite the country. The participants decided that from now on they will all be referred to by a single name – &quot;Ghalghaï&quot;, stop strife and begin to move out in an organized manner. Probably, these events were associated with the development of land in the upper reaches of the Sunzha and Kambileevka, where the oldest settlements of the Ingush Akhki-Yurt and Angusht arose. The colonization of this zone, likely, was carried out during the XVI-XVII centuries, and received activation with further advancement to the north, after the departure of the Kabardians from Sunzha and Kambileevka, around from the 30s of the XVIII century.

=== Contacts with Russian Empire ===

In the 18th century, the process of returning the Ingush to their fertile lands in the Sunzha and Terek basins was completed. On March 4–6, 1770, with a large gathering of people near the foothill village of Angusht in a clearing with the symbolic name &quot;Barta-Bos&quot; (&quot;Slope of Agreement&quot;), 24 Ingush elders swore an oath of allegiance to the Russian Empire. This event was attended by German academician J. A. Güldenstädt, who described it in his work &quot;Journey through Russia and the Caucasus Mountains.&quot; However it is worth saying that even after the oath of individual Ingush society or clans, the former Russian-Ingush relations remained the same. In fact, both sides took these type of oaths as a conclusion union treaties.

The interfluve of the Terek and Sunzha, through which the road to Georgia passed, acquires strategic importance for Russia during this period. This territory was mastered by the Ingush no later than the end of the 17th – beginning of the 18th century. According to J. A. Güldenstädt, there were many Ingush villages on the banks of the Sunzha and Kambileyevka rivers. Angusht was the center of the district, known as the &quot;Great Ingush&quot;. Settlers from the &quot;Great Ingush&quot; formed a new colony &quot;Small Ingush&quot;, the center of which was the village of Sholkhi. In the future, the Ingush advance to the Nazran Valley.

In 1781, at the confluence of the river Nazranka with the Sunzha, people from the Angusht region founded the village of Nazran (Nyasare). In the same year, the quartermaster of the Russian army, L. L. Städer, noted an Ingush outpost on this territory Thus, in 1781 the Nazran Valley was already controlled by the Ingush.

In May 1784, in connection with the need to establish reliable communication routes with the territory of Georgia, either near, or, on the territory of the Ingush village of Zaur (Zovr-Kov), the Vladikavkaz fortress was founded. Vladikavkaz became the economic, political and cultural center of the Ingush and one of the most important cities in the North Caucasus.

=== Caucasian War ===
During the 19th century, the Ingush bitterly resisted the Russian Empire&#x27;s expansion in the region during the Caucasian War and they were considered &quot;half-conquered&quot;. Therefore, during the war, there was a series of military expeditions of Russians done to Ingushetia.

In July 1830, two Russian columns under the command of Major General Abkhazov made a punitive expedition to mountainous Ingushetia. The Russian troops went through the Darial and Assa gorges. Especially the inhabitants of Eban put up a courageous resistance against the Russian troops. On November 12, 1836, Baron Rosen reported in letter to count Alexander Chernyshyov that in 1830, the highlanders of Dzherakh, Kist, and Galgai societies were briefly subdued by Russia. As a result of the expedition, district courts were established and a civil system was introduced to mountainous Ingushetia.

In July 1832, Russian troops consisting also of Ossetian and Georgian detachments made another punitive expedition to mountainous Ingushetia, this time under the command of Baron Rosen, who at the time was commander-in-chief of the troops in the North Caucasus. The reason of this expedition was the murder of bailiff Konstantinov by the inhabitants of the village of Khuli. As a result of the expedition, many Ingush villages were exterminated with the arable lands being spoiled and a large number of livestock being stolen.

Ingush participated in many uprisings of Chechnya, twice in two different uprisings in 1822 as well as the uprising of Chechnya in 1840 during which two Ingush societies – Galashians and Karabulaks joined the Caucasian Imamate after swearing allegiance to Imam Shamil in Urus-Martan.

Regarding general uprising of Chechnya that happened in March 1840, General Pavel Grabbe reported in March 30, 1840 as follows:

The 1840–1850s are considered the peak of Caucasian Imamate, during which, number of Ingush societies (Vilayet Kalay), some Tsorin and Galgai auls were part of it.

&quot;The Eclectic Review&quot; wrote in 1854 about the resistance of the Ingush against the Russian expansion in the region as follows:

In the late 1840s to late 1850s, the construction of a chain of Cossack villages began on the flat area of Ingushetia. The Ingush were expelled from the lowland villages to the mountains and foothills, Cossack villages were founded in the territories.

=== As a part of the Russian Empire ===

In 1860, the territory of Ingushetia formed the Ingushskiy &quot;Okrug&quot; as part of the Terek &quot;Oblast&quot;. In 1870, the Ingushskiy &quot;Okrug&quot; was merged with the Ossetinskiy &quot;Okrug&quot; into the Vladikavkazsky &quot;Okrug&quot;. In 1888, the Vladikavkazsky &quot;Okrug&quot; was disbanded, and the Ingush-Cossack Sunzhensky &quot;Otdel&quot; was formed on the site of the Ingushshkiy Okrug. In 1909, the Sunzhensky &quot;Otdel&quot; was divided into two &quot;okrugs&quot; – Sunzhensky and Nazranovskiy.

According to the 1897 census, the number of Ingush in the Russian Empire was 47,409 people.

=== In the USSR ===
In 1923, the Ingush alphabet was introduced based on the Latin alphabet, developed by Zaurbek Malsagov. On May 1, 1923, the first newspaper in the Ingush language, Serdalo, was published. New schools appeared in the villages of Gamurzievo, Bazorkino, and Yandare. Muslim schools – madrasahs – still functioned.

According to the 1926 census, 74,097 Ingush lived in the USSR, and according to the 1939 census, their number was 92,120 people.

==== Genocide of 1944 ====

During World War II, in 1942 German forces entered the North Caucasus. For three weeks Germans captured over half of the North Caucasus. They were only stopped at two Checheno-Ingush cities: Malgobek and Ordzhonikidze ( &quot;Vladikavkaz&quot;) by heroic resistance of natives of Chechen-Ingush ASSR.

On 23 February 1944, Ingush and Chechens were falsely accused of collaborating with the Nazis, and the entire Ingush and Chechen populations were deported to Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and Siberia in Operation Lentil, on the orders of Soviet leader Joseph Stalin, while the majority of their men were fighting on the front. The Checheno-Ingush ASSR was liquidated and the territory of Ingushetia was divided between the newly created Grozny Oblast and Georgian SSR. The initial phase of the deportation was carried out on American-supplied Studebaker trucks specifically modified with three submachine gun-nest compartments above the deported to prevent escapes. American historian Norman Naimark writes:

The deportees were gathered on the railroad stations and during the second phase transferred to the cattle railroad carts. Up to 30% of the population perished during the journey or in the first year of the exile. The Prague Watchdog claims that &quot;in the early years of their exile about half of the Chechens and Ingush died from hunger, cold and disease&quot;. The deportation was classified by the European Parliament in 2004 as genocide. After the deportation Ingush resistance against Soviets rises again. Those who escaped the deportation, shepherds who were high in the mountains during the deportation combine forces and form rebel groups which constantly attack Russian forces in Ingushetia. Major rebel groups were led by Akhmed Khuchbarov, Tsitskiev brothers, and Ingush femalesniper Laisat Baisarova. The last one of the male Ingush rebels was killed in 1977 by the KGB officers, while Baisarova was never captured or killed. American professor Johanna Nichols, who specializes in Chechen and Ingush philology, provided the theory behind the deportation:

In the early 1990s, the Ossetian side put forward a version that &quot;instead of the Prigorodny District&quot;, the Naur and Shelkovskaya districts of the Stavropol Territory were included in the restored Checheno-Ingushetia in 1957 (until 1957 these districts were part of the Grozny region). However, the transfer of these regions to Checheno-Ingushetia cannot be considered as “compensation” for the Prigorodny region.

According to the all-Union census of 1959, the number of Ingush was 105,980 people.

Since the return of the Ingush, they have advocated the return of the torn territories, for the creation of their own statehood. These performances reached their apogee in 1973 – at a rally in Grozny, organized by the Ingush demanding the return of the Prigorodny district. According to all-Union censuses, the number of Ingush continued to grow: for example, the total number of Ingush in the USSR in 1979 amounted to 186,198 people, and according to the 1989 census – 237,438 people.

Since 1988, informal organizations have been created in Ingushetia, various movements have appeared (&quot;Nijsxo&quot;, &quot;Däqaste&quot;, &quot;People&#x27;s Council&quot;), which set as their goal the creation of Ingush statehood within the Russian Federation with the return of all territories torn away during the deportation. Formally, the Ingush were rehabilitated in their rights on April 26, 1991, when the law “On the Rehabilitation of Victims of Political Repressions” was adopted at the 1st Congress of the Supreme Soviet of the RSFSR. This law became a kind of catalyst for the restoration of historical and social justice for other millions of citizens of the former Soviet Union.

=== Present time ===
In 1992, the Law &quot;On the Formation of the Ingush Republic as part of the Russian Federation&quot; was adopted (see Ingushetia). In October–November, the Ossetian-Ingush conflict around the Prigorodny district of North Ossetia escalated into armed clashes. According to the Russian prosecutor&#x27;s office, during the clashes as a result of the conflict, 583 people died (350 Ingush and 192 Ossetians), 939 people were injured (457 Ingush and 379 Ossetians), another 261 people went missing (208 Ingush and 37 Ossetians), from 30 to 60 thousand Ingush were forced to move from Vladikavkaz and the Prigorodny district to Ingushetia.

In 1995, the new capital of Ingushetia, the city of Magas, was founded.

== Anthropological type ==

The Ingush are traditionally a classless society based on a clan system and unwritten law. Approximately 350 clans live in Ingushetia today. Every clan, and each clan member, are viewed as equal. Unlike neighboring nations in the Caucasus, the Ingush rarely had social superiors or inferiors. In 1781, during his travels fromt the Mozdok fortress to the inner Caucasus, Leonti von Städer described the Ingush as “outwardly free, fierce and serious; ardent in speech, yet pacified rather quickly; their feelings are manifested sincerely and openly; they consider contempt for life a virtue and the slightest symptom of fear as the greatest of faults; therefore they are daringly courageous.”

According to anthropologist Ivan Pantyukhov, anthropologically the Ingush differ not only from other populations of the Caucasus; but also from the neighbouring Chechens with whom they form a single speech community, due to passive bilingualism practiced by the Ingush people. The Soviet-Russian anthropologists and scientists N.Y. Marr, V.V. Bounak, R.M. Munchaev, I.M Dyakonov, E.I. Krupnov and G.A. Melikashvilli wrote: “Among Ingush the Caucasian type is preserved better than among any other North Caucasian nation”. Professor G.F. Debets recognized that Ingush Caucasian anthropologic type is the most Caucasian among Caucasians.

Prussian scholar Peter Simon Pallas visited the Caucasus region in the late 18th century and made the following observation of the Ingush people:

== Ingush language and grammar ==
The famous Georgian historian and linguist Ivane Javakhishvili proposed to use &quot;Ghalghaï&quot; () as a general name or classification for the Ingush, Chechen and Bats languages, instead of artificially invented terms, such as &quot;Nakh&quot; or &quot;Vainakh&quot;:

According to the linguist Johanna Nichols, the Ingush language differs from the Chechen, but is placed into the same language group due to the passive bilingualism of the Ingush people. J. Nichols remarks: &quot;To my surprise, Ingush turned out to be the most complex language of my sample, besting even polysynthetic languages like Seneca, Lakhota, and Halkomelem. Ingush is not polysynthetic; its complexity is due to large inventories of elements (phonemes, cases, tenses, etc.), a high degree of inflectional synthesis in the verb, and classification of various types – declension and conjugation classes, agreement genders, overt inherent genders, split verbal lexicon, split alignment, etc. Perhaps this complexity explains why it has taken thirty years to produce this grammar, during most of which time the project has in fact been on or near the front burner ... Ingush and Chechen are distinct languages and not mutually intelligible, but because of widespread passive partial knowledge of standard lowlands Chechen by Ingush they function to some extent as a single speech community.&quot;

== Origin of the Ingush population ==
According to Leonti Mroveli, the 11th-century Georgian chronicler, the word Caucasian is derived from the Vainakh ancestor Kavkas. According to Professor George Anchabadze of Ilia State University &quot;The Vainakhs are the ancient natives of the Caucasus. It is noteworthy, that according to the genealogical table drawn up by Leonti Mroveli, the legendary forefather of the Vainakhs was &quot;Kavkas&quot;, hence the name Kavkasians, one of the ethnicons met in the ancient Georgian written sources, signifying the ancestors of the Chechens and Ingush. As appears from the above, the Vainakhs, at least by name, are presented as &quot;the most Caucasian people of all the Caucasians&quot; (Caucasus – Kavkas – Kavkasians) in the Georgian historical tradition.
In an article from the Science Magazine Bernice Wuethrich states that American linguist Dr. Johanna Nichols has used language to connect modern people of the Caucasus region to the ancient farmers of the Fertile Crescent and that her research suggests that &quot;farmers of the region were proto-Nakh-Daghestanians&quot;. Nichols is quoted as stating that &quot;The Nakh–Dagestanian languages are the closest thing we have to a direct continuation of the cultural and linguistic community that gave rise to Western civilization&quot;.

== Genetics ==
The Ingush have 89% of J2 Y-DNA which is the highest known frequency in the world and J2 is closely associated with the Fertile Crescent. The mitochondrial DNA of the Ingush differs from other Caucasian populations and the rest of the world. &quot;The Caucasus populations exhibit, on average, less variability than other [World] populations for the eight Alu insertion polymorphisms analyzed here. The average heterozygosity is less than that of any other region of the world, with the exception of Sahul. Within the Caucasus, the Ingush have much lower levels of variability than any of the other populations. The Ingush also showed unusual patterns of mtDNA variation when compared with other Caucasus populations (Nasidze and Stoneking, submitted), which indicates that some feature of the Ingush population history, or of this particular sample of the Ingush, must be responsible for their different patterns of genetic variation at both mtDNA and the Alu insertion loci.&quot;

== Social structure ==
One of the outstanding features of the Ingush character can be attributed to democratic individualism, which directly penetrated the entire social life of the Ingush people. Since time immemorial, the Ingush people were a collection of many small, but completely independent democratic clans and communities. Each individual village was independently governed by senior family members and was completely independent from neighboring villages; only in case of great danger were all villages united together for common protection, under the control of all senior members of the united societies. No military virtues or merits could give a person distinguished by them any significant privileges, therefore, among the Ingush people there were no titles at all that would have civil significance and give the official right of influence on fellow tribesmen, like many neighboring Caucasian peoples.

== Architecture ==

The Ingush stone architecture is closely related to their way of life in the mountains. The stone architecture is known to mountain Ingushetia as early as 8,000–4,000 BC cyclopean masonry settlements Egikal, Targim, Doshkhakle, Leymi. Caucasologist Ruslan Buzurtanov mentions that every Ingush family had an architectural triad: a tower, a church, and a necropolis. All three were present in every settlement. All three evolved continuously over time. For example, the Tkhaba-Yerdy Church was originally a pagan temple according to the evidence the earliest structures that dates back before the 8th–9th centuries when it was remodeled into a Christian church adding Christian crosses and reliefs but keeping the pagan petroglyphs. The Ingush stone town consisting of towers and churches were located lower than the necropolis town of the dead. Ingush necropolis had stepped roof either pyramidal or conical shape. Combat towers had stepped pyramidal roof. Necropolis evolved over time: 3,000 BC they were underground stone cists, later grouped into pyramids, then became half underground and finally early Middle Ages above the ground structures. Majority of the Ingush stone necropolis and churches East of the Terek river were either partially or fully destroyed during the Soviet times especially after Ingush people were exiled en masse in 1944. The necropolis were looted by Ossetian and Russian colonists who were brought to Ingushetia after 1944. The combat towers had an entrance on the second floor which had a conical roof with a cross made of stones and a keystone which formed the floor of the next level. These conical stone crosses are unique only in the Ingush towers. The combat towers usually had five to six levels. None of the arches of windows in the combat towers had a keystone and were made of a solid blocks of stone. The famous Soviet archaeologist and historian, professor E.I. Krupnov in his book &quot;Medieval Ingushetia&quot; described the Ingush towers as «&quot;in the true sense the pinnacle of the architectural and constructional mastery of the ancient population of the region&quot;».

== Culture ==

The Ingush possess a varied culture of traditions, legends, epics, tales, songs, proverbs, and sayings. Music, songs and dance are particularly highly regarded. Popular musical instruments include the &quot;dachick-panderr&quot; (a kind of balalaika), &quot;kekhat ponder&quot; (accordion, generally played by girls), mirz ponder (a three-stringed violin), zurna (a type of oboe), tambourine, and drums.

== Religion ==
The Ingush are Sunni Muslims. In matters of fiqh, they adhere to the school of Imam Muhammad ash-Shafi’i, the founder of the Shafi&#x27;i madhab. They are also adherents of two Sufi tariqas: Qadiriyya and Naqshbandiya. Before the final consolidation of Islam, the Ingush from ancient times had their traditional pagan beliefs widespread, with their own unique pantheon, developed mythology and numerous religious architectural objects. At some period, Christianity was also widespread.

=== Christianity ===
According to the writings of the historian Bashir Dalgat, the first Christian missionaries were Georgian and they appeared in Ingushetia around the 10th century, simultaneously with the flourishing of Georgia. Christianity spread quite widely in Ingushetia and Chechnya, at the moment, on the territory of modern Chechnya, Ingushetia and North Ossetia, there are many archaeological, historical and architectural monuments confirming the centuries-old Christianity among the Ingush in particular, and the Vainakhs in general. The scientist&#x27;s study describes numerous testimonies of historians and travelers of the early and middle Middle Ages, according to which churches or even, possibly, a monastery were built on the territory of the Ingush lands. In particular, according to the testimonies of Russian German scientists Johann Güldenstädt and Peter Simon Pallas, who visited Ingushetia in the 18th century, in the Tkhaba-Yerdy Church (an example of architecture of the 9th–10th centuries) ancient documents were kept, written, according to them the interlocutor-monk, &quot;in gold, blue and black letters&quot;, that above the doors of the temple there is an inscription in &quot;Gothic letters&quot;. Brockhaus and Efron Encyclopedic Dictionary, published in the late 19th – early 20th centuries, indicated the presence of Christians and pagans among the Ingush:

=== Islam ===
Islam began to penetrate to the ancestors of the Ingush as early as the 8th century as a result of military campaigns of the Arabs against the Khazars and Alans, which ran through the Darial and Derbent gorges. This period includes a bronze figure of an eagle (&quot;The Eagle of Suleyman&quot;) from the tower settlement of Erzi in the Kistin Gorge of mountainous Ingushetia, which probably came here in the form of a military trophy and today is the oldest accurately dated bronze product of Islamic art. The eagle served as the coat of arms of the village of Erzi (from the Ingush. &quot;Eagle&quot;) and was passed from generation to generation to the eldest family member. And the name of the village of Dzheyrakh in mountainous Ingushetia is associated with the name of the Arab commander Jarrah ibn-Abdullah. Also, the legends of the Ingush connect the spread of Islam among them with another Arab commander named Abu Muslim.

Some researchers tend to associate the penetration of Islam with the presence of the Mongol-Tatars in the flat regions of Ingushetia, especially with the coming to power of Khan Uzbek (r. 1312–1340), when Islamization began to be carried out more intensively. V. B. Vinogradov believed that the headquarters of Khan Uzbek was located in the area of the modern Ingush village of Plievo, the city of Karabulak and the mausoleum of Borga-Kash. This unique architectural monument was built in 1405–1406. There is an opinion that here may be buried the ruler Burakan (Borokhan), mentioned in the chronicles &quot;Zafar-name&quot; (&quot;Book of Victories&quot;) Nizam-ad-din Shami, who was a contemporary and personal secretary of Tamerlan, and &quot;Zafar-name&quot; (&quot;Book of Victories&quot;) Sheref-ad-din Yazdi, who lived in the first half of the XV century.

According to other sources, the flat Ingush, unlike the Ingush highlanders, begin to accept Islam in the 16th century, and the period of its wide distribution falls on the 18th century. According to the Georgian geographer and historian prince Vakhushti Bagrationi, at the beginning of the 18th century. Part of the Ingush, namely the Angusht society, were Sunni Muslims. The presence of ancient mosques of the 18th to 19th centuries. recorded in mountainous Ingushetia.

In the first half of the 19th century, the activities of Imam Shamil played a significant role in rooting Islam among the Ingush. During the Caucasian War, his Naqshbandi tariqa became the official ideology of the Imamate, so that some Ingush societies – Karabulaks, Galashians – became followers of the Imam&#x27;s teachings.

<doc id="907276" wikidata="Q7758845" url="?curid=907276" title="The Puzzle Palace">
<text>The Puzzle Palace is a book written by James Bamford and published in 1982. It is the first major, popular work devoted entirely to the history and workings of the National Security Agency (NSA), a United States intelligence organization. The title refers to a nickname for the NSA, which is headquartered in Fort Meade, Maryland. In addition to describing the role of the NSA and explaining how it was organized, the book exposed details of a massive eavesdropping operation called Operation Shamrock. According to security expert Bruce Schneier, the book was popular within the NSA itself, as &quot;the agency&#x27;s secrecy prevents its employees from knowing much about their own history&quot;.

==Research and publication==

The NSA describes Bamford&#x27;s research process in a partially declassified history of postwar American cryptography. The history begins by describing how Bamford approached Houghton-Mifflin with a proposal to write a book on the NSA. The publisher accepted and paid Bamford a $7,500 advance.

According to the NSA&#x27;s historical account, &quot;Public Law 86-36 had served as a useful barrier against this type of research, but Bamford proved to be cleverer than others. He began with a barrage of requests for information under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA).&quot; Bamford eventually discovered &quot;the Mother Lode,&quot; a collection of documents deposited at the George C. Marshall Foundation Library by former NSA chief cryptologist William Friedman. These documents included copies of the &quot;NSA Newsletter&quot;, addressed to &quot;NSA Employees and their families.&quot; The account continues, &quot;Bamford then submitted a FOIA request for the entire collection, using as his rationale the offending phrase indicating that the information had been intended for dissemination to uncleared people.&quot; The FOIA requests gave Bamford access to an only lightly redacted set of documents, and a former NSA employee later gave Bamford access to an almost complete collection.

During the 1975 Church Committee hearings, the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) had investigated the legal culpability of various intelligence agencies. Bamford submitted a FOIA request for resulting documents, and received most of their report on the NSA. The DOJ did not inform the NSA of the release because the investigation was ongoing, and the NSA was a possible target. The released papers were later to become the subject of threatened litigation, and their release prompted eventual rule changes that allowed for document reclassification. According to the NSA&#x27;s history, &quot;the document, with some Justice redactions, contained a good deal of information about the NSA-GCHQ [Government Communications Headquarters, a British intelligence agency] relationship, and served as the basis for Bamford&#x27;s information on Second Party issues [i.e., issues regarding outside agencies with which the NSA had partnered].&quot; The NSA history dryly notes that &quot;GCHQ was not amused&quot; about the disclosure.

Bamford also interviewed retired NSA senior officials, including former director Marshall Carter, with whom he talked for a day and a half. None of the discussed subject matter was classified, but, according to the NSA, &quot;it helped Bamford to complete his mosaic.&quot; The NSA account also describes how Bamford drove through the NSA parking lot, recording diplomatic license plates and cross-checking them against known lists to determine which countries maintained representatives at Fort Meade.

The NSA&#x27;s historical account summarizes Bamford&#x27;s work thusly: &quot;James Bamford broke new ground in intelligence agency research, and his techniques were adopted by others seeking to investigate reclusive federal agencies. He did it all within the limits of the law – through attributable interviews, FOIA&#x27;ed documents, and meticulous research in public libraries and newspapers. ... He &#x27;wrote the book&#x27; on how to put together a comprehensive picture of an organization that wanted no such comprehensive picture.&quot;

==Threatened legal action and document reclassification==
Before the book&#x27;s publication, the Reagan administration claimed that unclassified source documents were released to Bamford in error, and threatened him with prosecution if he did not return 250 pages of documents he had obtained through Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests. The documents in question related to a 1975-76 DOJ investigation, and described the NSA&#x27;s widespread illegal monitoring of domestic communication, warrantless surveillance of Americans, and monitoring of commercial cable and telex traffic. Bamford&#x27;s attorney, believing that they would prevail in court, invited the DOJ to prosecute, but no case was ever brought. In the wake of the dispute, classification rules were revised to allow document reclassification, and the contested documents were reclassified. NSA agents then visited libraries to remove other source documents from circulation.

The new rules allowing document reclassification were outlined in Executive Order 12356. Previously, Executive Order 12065, issued by Jimmy Carter in 1978, had prohibited document reclassification. Executive Order 12356, issued by Ronald Reagan in 1982, eliminated the reclassification prohibition and described situations in which documents could be reclassified. Released documents could be reclassified as long as they could be reasonably recovered (meaning that documents available to the public at large would not meet this criterion). It also allowed documents requested under the FOIA or Privacy Act to be classified or reclassified provided they met specified requirements (e.g., certain matters related to national security). According to Bamford, he could not be prosecuted under the new rules because of the principle of &quot;ex post facto&quot;.

==Reclassified source documents and American Library Association lawsuit==

Reclassified and re-sequestered source documents that Bamford had used when writing &quot;The Puzzle Palace&quot; were the subject of subsequent litigation. The NSA&#x27;s historical account states that documents removed from the Marshall Library were &quot;sequestered portions of the Friedman collection,&quot; i.e., the collection that included the copies of the &quot;NSA Newsletter&quot; that spurred one of Bamford&#x27;s FOIA requests. The materials removed from circulation included three government publications and 31 pieces of Friedman&#x27;s private correspondence. The American Library Association (ALA) challenged the document removal in court, and in 1987 the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia dismissed the case. Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who was at that time a Court of Appeals judge, ruled that the ALA lacked standing in the case. A lower court ruling had already affirmed that the NSA had authority to remove the reclassified documents, but criticized the NSA&#x27;s &quot;cavalier attitude&quot; toward the classification determination of those documents.

==Reviews and reception==
&quot;The New York Times&quot; reviewed the book favorably, writing that &quot;Until now no one has published a comprehensive and detailed report on the agency. The quality and depth of Mr. Bamford&#x27;s research are remarkable.&quot; The review concluded, &quot;By revealing the scope and opening up the operations of the N.S.A. without giving away its most sensitive secrets, Mr. Bamford has performed an important public service in this impressive book.&quot;

In a review of Shane Harris&#x27; book &quot;The Watchers: The Rise of America&#x27;s Surveillance State&quot;, &quot;New York Times&quot; reporter Eric Lichtblau described &quot;The Puzzle Palace&quot; as &quot;the benchmark study of the N.S.A. [that] first pulled back the curtain to provide a glint of unwanted sunlight on the place&quot;. Michael Duffy, reviewing Bamford&#x27;s 2004 book &quot;Pretext for War&quot;, wrote in &quot;Time&quot; magazine that &quot;The Puzzle Palace&quot; &quot;is still considered the classic account of the mysterious National Security Agency.&quot;

&quot;The Puzzle Palace&quot; has been generally well received by experts, and has been used as a textbook at the Defense Intelligence Agency&#x27;s National Intelligence University. The NSA itself says the book &quot;brought a new focus to the efforts of journalists and independent writers to break down the Agency&#x27;s vaunted anonymity,&quot; and describes the book as &quot;the most significant breach in NSA&#x27;s anonymity since David Kahn&#x27;s &quot;The Codebreakers&quot; in 1967.&quot; In the years between the book&#x27;s publication and September 11 attacks (9/11), the relationship between Bamford and the NSA grew less adversarial. The NSA cooperated with Bamford on a later book titled &quot;Body of Secrets&quot;, and in April 2001 the NSA hosted a book-signing event for Bamford at their Maryland headquarters. Bamford was critical of NSA actions in the years following 9/11, and the relationship between the two once again cooled.

<doc id="907282" wikidata="Q253205" url="?curid=907282" title="Entourage (American TV series)">
<text>Entourage is an American comedy-drama television series that premiered on HBO on July 18, 2004, and ended on September 11, 2011, after eight seasons. The series was created and largely written by Doug Ellin and chronicles the acting career of Vincent Chase, a young A-list movie star, and his childhood friends from Queens, New York City, as they attempt to further their nascent careers in Los Angeles.

Mark Wahlberg and Stephen Levinson served as the show&#x27;s executive producers, and its premise is loosely based on Wahlberg&#x27;s experiences as an up-and-coming film star.

==Development==
According to Mark Wahlberg, &quot;Entourage&quot; was initially conceived when his assistant asked if he could film Wahlberg and his friends, calling them &quot;hilarious.&quot; Other reports credit Eric Weinstein, a long-time friend of Wahlberg, with the idea of filming the actor&#x27;s group of friends. However, according to Donnie Carroll, who was the inspiration for the Turtle character, the idea for a show involving an actor and his friends had come from him. It had originated as a book idea, centered on Carroll&#x27;s own life and his experiences with Wahlberg, titled &quot;From the &#x27;Hood to Hollywood, A Soldier&#x27;s Story&quot;.

To be more satirical of the Hollywood lifestyle, a fictional approach was chosen rather than a straight documentary in order to keep the content light, and avoid directly depicting Wahlberg&#x27;s violent past. Vincent Chase was envisioned to be more similar to Wahlberg, but it was decided that some of his and his friends&#x27; activities (particularly some elements of their criminal past) would not work well on television. A lighter approach was subsequently decided upon.

==Cast and characters==

&quot;Entourage&quot; revolves around Vincent Chase (Adrian Grenier). His best friend and manager is Eric Murphy (Kevin Connolly). &quot;E&quot;, as his friends call him, is based on Mark Wahlberg&#x27;s friend and associate producer Eric Weinstein. He&#x27;s also been reported to be inspired by Stephen Levinson, Mark Wahlberg&#x27;s manager.

Vincent&#x27;s older half-brother, Johnny &quot;Drama&quot; Chase (Kevin Dillon), is Vince&#x27;s personal chef, trainer and bodyguard. Drama is a C-list actor who was in the fictional show &quot;Viking Quest&quot; during his younger days. His role in the new fictional hit show &quot;Five Towns&quot; had begun to resurrect his fame and career, although he still received less acknowledgment than he would have liked for it. As the show went on, Drama got offers for more and more roles. The show ended with Drama having his own animated TV show called &quot;Johnny&#x27;s Bananas&quot; and him landing a new TV movie with the help of Vince. Drama&#x27;s character is based on Johnny &quot;Drama&quot; Alves (cousin of Mark Wahlberg), whom Donnie Wahlberg had hired to keep his younger brother out of trouble.

Rounding out the entourage of friends is Salvatore &quot;Turtle&quot; Assante (Jerry Ferrara), who is another of Vince&#x27;s old friends from childhood. Turtle&#x27;s official role is as Vince&#x27;s driver and assistant, though his value as such is often brought into question. This character is based on Wahlberg&#x27;s former &quot;gofer&quot; Donnie Carroll aka &quot;Donkey&quot;. Carroll auditioned for the role, but the Boston native was turned down when it was decided the actors would have to be New Yorkers. Carroll died on December 18, 2005, after an asthma attack.

Ari Gold (Jeremy Piven) is Vince&#x27;s abrasive but lovable agent. The role has led to several nominations and Emmy Awards for Piven. Ari is based on Wahlberg&#x27;s real-life agent Ari Emanuel.

Connolly, Grenier, Dillon, Ferrara, and Piven are credited in every episode in the opening credits of the entire series. Debi Mazar, who has a recurring guest star role as Shauna in season 1, is promoted to opening credits billing in season 2. Her appearances in season 3 were limited due to her pregnancy and Mazar made her final regular appearance in episode 42 (season 3 finale). Mazar made appearances in seasons 4 through 8 and is credited as a special guest star. Melissa Gold (Perrey Reeves) and Lloyd (Rex Lee) have recurring roles in the first two seasons. Starting in season 3, Reeves and Lee are credited as &quot;starring&quot; in the end credits in the episodes they appear in. Reeves receives opening credits billing starting with season 4, and Lee is added to the opening credits starting with season 5. In season 4, Rhys Coiro, who portrays recurring character Billy Walsh, is credited as &quot;starring&quot; in the end credits for the first six episodes of the season. However, when his character returns in episode 52 (season 4, episode 10), he is again credited as a guest star; he returns in season 7 as a recurring special guest star and is credited as &quot;starring&quot; in the end credits again in season 8. Emmanuelle Chriqui portrays E&#x27;s on-and-off girlfriend Sloan McQuewick as a recurring guest star from season 2 to 5, and beginning with season 6, she is credited as &quot;starring&quot; in the end credits. Gary Cole guest stars in three episodes of season 5 as agent Andrew Klein, and beginning with season 6 he is credited as &quot;starring&quot; in the end credits and returns in season 7 as a special guest star. Scott Caan guest stars in two episodes of season 6 as Scott Lavin, and in season 7 and 8, he is credited as &quot;starring&quot; in the end credits.

===Recurring characters===
&quot;Entourage&quot; features many recurring characters. Some are fictional, such as Malcolm McDowell&#x27;s &quot;Terrance McQuewick&quot; character, while other actors, such as Mark Wahlberg, Bob Saget, Pauly Shore, Jamie-Lynn Sigler, Mandy Moore, Sasha Grey, and Seth Green appear as fictional versions of themselves.

===Guests and cameos===
&quot;Entourage&quot; typically has at least one celebrity guest per episode, such as actors, film directors, film producers, musicians and professional athletes playing themselves. Appearances include Peter Jackson, Christina Aguilera, Kanye West, Curtis Jackson, Tom Brady, Jessica Alba, Gary Busey, Larry David, Scarlett Johansson, James Cameron, Dennis Hopper, Martin Scorsese, Matt Damon, Eminem, LeBron James, Mark Cuban, John Cleese, Phil Mickelson, and many others.

==Episodes==

===First season===
The first season chronicles Vincent Chase&#x27;s adventures as he climbs the celebrity ladder after his first successful film: &quot;Head On&quot;. At the forefront of the first few episodes is the conflict between Vince&#x27;s best friend &quot;E&quot; and his agent Ari, who are both working to get the best for Vince, but often differ on how to accomplish this.

Vince&#x27;s next project is decided halfway through the season: &quot;Queens Boulevard&quot;. Signed on is indie director Billy Walsh (Rhys Coiro), who comes into immediate conflict with E. Eventually their differences are put aside and the season ends with the crew leaving for New York to start production on &quot;Queens Boulevard&quot;, with E having become Vince&#x27;s official manager (with salary).

Running subplots include: Turtle&#x27;s laziness and quest for marijuana; Drama&#x27;s struggle to follow in his younger brother&#x27;s footsteps; E dating Ari&#x27;s assistant Emily (Samaire Armstrong); and Vince&#x27;s many and varied girlfriends.

===Second season===
The second season focuses on Vince&#x27;s proposed role in the film adaptation of &quot;Aquaman&quot; as the eponymous hero. Ari&#x27;s inability to close the contract leads to trouble, but Vince manages to convince the film&#x27;s director, James Cameron, that he is right for the part. However, new problems arise when the role of the leading lady goes to Mandy Moore, Vince&#x27;s ex-girlfriend, for whom he still has feelings, but who is engaged to be married. Mandy and Vince resume their romance after Mandy&#x27;s engagement shows signs of problems, but she eventually returns to her boyfriend. Initially devastated, Vince finds the will to go on with the film in the end.

However, Ari has his own problems in the form of his boss and partner, Terrance McQuewick (Malcolm McDowell), who is trying to steal Vince away from him. Near the end of the season, their conflict reaches a head and Ari is fired from the agency after another agent, Adam Davies, leaked information suggesting that Ari may be plotting against Terrance. E, meanwhile, begins dating Sloan (Emmanuelle Chriqui), McQuewick&#x27;s daughter.

Meanwhile, Drama continues to try to become a star, even considering getting his calves augmented. He is eventually dropped by his agent, Adam Davies, after Vince decides to stick with Ari after Ari is fired. Turtle starts a career of his own, as manager of rapper Saigon.

===Third season, part 1===
The third season continues with the &quot;Aquaman&quot; plotline as the film premieres and becomes a huge hit, attaining the highest-grossing opening weekend in movie history. Problems arise, however, when &quot;Medellin&quot;, Vince&#x27;s dream project about the life of Pablo Escobar, conflicts with the schedule of &quot;Aquaman 2&quot;. The end result is that Vince is unable to star in either and is fired by Warner Bros.

E&#x27;s relationship with Sloan comes into question when he has a threesome with her and her friend Tori (Malin Åkerman), to whom E is attracted. Tensions rise further when E is confronted by Sloan&#x27;s stalker Seth Green. Seth claims that he had been with Sloan a few years back however, Sloan assures E that he was creepy and they never so much as kissed.

Near the end of the season, Drama finally lands his big break as he&#x27;s signed on to the new TV series &quot;Five Towns&quot;. Turtle&#x27;s career as a music manager ends unceremoniously when he is forcefully bought out by Saigon&#x27;s original manager. Ari meanwhile has to juggle his new, initially failing, business with keeping Vince happy. Even though Ari manages to set up a successful new agency with the help of Barbara Miller (Beverly D&#x27;Angelo), it leads him to neglect his star client. After Ari introduces E to washed up producer Bob Ryan (Martin Landau), E discovers in Ryan&#x27;s home a biographical script about punk band The Ramones, with Vince having the opportunity to play Joey Ramone. However, in the season finale, Ari is fired as Vince&#x27;s agent after his abrasive methods and constant mocking of Ryan result in failure to secure the film.

===Third season, part 2===
The second part of the third season focuses almost entirely on Vince and Ari and the troubles surrounding &quot;Medellin&quot;. Attempting to get Vince back, Ari convinces him that he can secure the film after all. Vince&#x27;s new agent, Amanda Daniels (Carla Gugino), tries to steer Vince towards a different film, but he ends up refusing. To compound their problems, Vince and Amanda both admit to a mutual attraction, and have a relationship. When &quot;Medellin&quot; once again slips from Vince&#x27;s grasp, he questions Amanda&#x27;s motives. After proving her innocence, she drops him as both client and boyfriend. With the help of Ari, who is once again hired, Vince and E finally secure their dream project when they buy the rights to the film &quot;Medellin&quot; themselves. Billy Walsh is signed on as the director with E given his first shot at producer.

In the continuation of the previous part&#x27;s subplot, Drama&#x27;s star rises, and &quot;Five Towns&quot; becomes a hit. E moves in with Sloan.

===Fourth season===
The fourth season continues the &quot;Medellin&quot; plotline as production of the film finally begins. Conflicts quickly arise when E admits to being dissatisfied with the first cut after Walsh reluctantly agrees to a midnight screening. Vince and E subsequently clash over the creative direction and financing of the film in an arc which escalates through the season. There is much contention over the ending of the script, and Stephen Gaghan is brought in briefly, at which point Walsh comes up with what he believes to be a good ending.

When the &quot;Medellin&quot; trailer leaks to the public via YouTube, an opportunity is presented to leverage the resultant hype to broker a deal attaching Vince to a new big-budget project. The deal, however, is unexpectedly sold on the strength of not just Vince, but the &quot;&quot;Medellin&quot; Dream Team&quot; — also involving E as producer and Walsh as director — at the point when animosity between E and Walsh begins to come to a head. Consequently, E must decide between jeopardizing the deal and the prospect of working on another project with Walsh, which he had previously sworn he would never do again.

Meanwhile, Ari contends with various complications in his personal and professional lives, including the incapacitating relationship troubles of his indispensable assistant, Lloyd, the uncertainty of his son&#x27;s acceptance into the exclusive private school that his daughter attends, and interpersonal conflicts among employees of his agency.

E navigates unfamiliar waters as he clumsily attempts to expand the representation of his fledgling management agency beyond Vince, his only client at the time. By chance he comes to meet and subsequently represent Anna Faris, but when his loyalty to Vince and his personal feelings for Faris are set at odds with each other and compromise his professional judgment, he is ultimately fired by Faris.

Drama and Turtle are featured throughout the season in various subplots that see them engaging in the type of antics typical of their characters, such as procuring marijuana and engaging in furry fetishes via Craigslist on a bet.

In the season finale, the entourage travels to the Cannes Film Festival to promote &quot;Medellin&quot;, and sign a distribution deal. However, the film bombs with the Cannes audience, and they are forced to accept an offer from producer Harvey Weingard (Maury Chaykin) of a mere one dollar for the film.

===Fifth season===
Vince returns to Los Angeles ready to work after spending months relaxing in Mexico with Turtle. &quot;Medellin&quot; has gone straight-to-DVD and made numerous worst-of-the-year lists, with Vince&#x27;s performance also being heavily criticized. Eric receives a script from a pair of unknown screenwriters trying to get a break in Hollywood called &quot;Nine Brave Souls&quot;, in which Eric sees potential. Eric gets Edward Norton and Amanda Daniels (Carla Gugino) interested, and they change the name of the film to &quot;Smoke Jumpers&quot;. When Ari reads the script of &quot;Smoke Jumpers&quot; he convinces Eric to start a bidding war for the film with Vince attached. Amanda refuses to participate and passes on it until later reconsidering and making an offer. However, Alan Gray (Paul Ben-Victor), head of the Warner Brothers Studio and the man who fired Vince from the sequel to &quot;Aquaman&quot;, outbids them.

Ari, determined to get Vince the role he desires, challenges Alan to a round of golf for the part. When Alan beats Ari, they get into a heated argument, causing Alan to drop dead of a heart attack. At Alan&#x27;s funeral, Ari takes the opportunity to ask John Ellis (Alan Dale), Alan&#x27;s boss, about giving the role to Vince. Ellis instead offers him Alan&#x27;s position as president of the studio, with Amanda as the number-two choice for the job. Rather than accepting the offer and abandoning his clients, Ari instead gets Dana Gordon (Constance Zimmer) the job, therefore locking up &quot;Smoke Jumpers&quot; for Vince.

Meanwhile, Drama is continuing production of &quot;Five Towns&quot; while maintaining a long-distance relationship with his French girlfriend, Jacqueline. Drama&#x27;s nervousness about Jacqueline possibly cheating on him leads to their break-up and his breakdown during a guest appearance on &quot;The View&quot;. Turtle meets Jamie-Lynn Sigler on an airplane and the two hit it off, but their potential relationship is ruined when Turtle tells the guys she gave him a handjob. She eventually forgives him and is interested in a relationship. Also, Ari signs his old colleague Andrew Klein (Gary Cole) as a new partner in MGA.

&quot;Smoke Jumpers&quot; begins filming, but after several conflicts between Vince and director Verner Vollstedt (Stellan Skarsgård), which leads to Verner firing Vince, production is halted by Ellis. The boys return to New York City, where Vince pursues a role in Gus Van Sant&#x27;s new film. Eric persistently tries to convince Van Sant that Vince is right for the film, but Van Sant says not for his current film, but would love to work with him in the future. After discovering Van Sant said no, Vince becomes upset and fires Eric, believing that Eric had made him look desperate. A frustrated E returns to Hollywood to concentrate on another client, a young and rising comedian named Charlie (Bow Wow). Vince later apologizes after learning that Eric&#x27;s persistence led to an offer by Martin Scorsese for a lead in his next feature, a re-envisioning of &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; set in the Upper West Side of New York City. The guys return to Hollywood.

===Sixth season===
The sixth season is mostly divided into individual storylines. Vince, back to A-list status after &quot;Gatsby&quot;, is preparing for his next role, starring in an Enzo Ferrari biopic (to be directed by Frank Darabont). Left to his own devices by his friends, Vince spends much of the season relaxing.

Meanwhile, Eric, prompted by ex-girlfriend Sloan, moves out on his own. Midway through the season, he disbands his company, shutting it down for good, and goes to work for veteran manager Murray Berenson (George Segal) while also incurring the wrath of colleague Scott Lavin (Scott Caan) who deeply resents Eric&#x27;s involvement in the company. While he starts a relationship with his neighbor Ashley (Alexis Dziena), Eric still pines for Sloan, and tries to win her back.

Turtle, who dreams of starting his own business, starts college. He is still together with Jamie-Lynn Sigler and is quickly becoming a celebrity in his own right. While at college, he meets Brooke, who attempts to seduce him. He turns her down. When Jamie-Lynn is offered a role, to be filmed in New Zealand, she breaks up with Turtle.

Jamie-Lynn also factors into Drama&#x27;s storyline, as she guest-stars on his show &quot;Five Towns&quot;. When the head of production, Dan Coakley (Matt Letscher), jokes to Drama about wanting to have sex with Sigler, Drama attacks him. Coakley then takes it on himself to ruin Drama&#x27;s character on the show. Finally, Drama leaves &quot;Five Towns&quot; with some help from Ari, and after a successful audition, receives an offer to star in his own television show pending studio approval.

Ari also faces trouble at work. Lloyd, his assistant, demands a promotion to agent and Ari makes him undergo a series of demeaning tests. As a result, Lloyd quits. Meanwhile, Andrew Klein, whose standing with Barbara Miller (Ari&#x27;s partner) is precarious, cheats on his wife. His marital problems interfere with his work and only Ari&#x27;s intervention saves him from being fired. Klein redeems himself by signing writer Aaron Sorkin.

In the final episodes of the season, Ari is approached by his old boss, Terrance McQuewick, who wants him to buy out his agency. Despite bitterness from being fired over his agency revolt years before, Ari finally agrees to the buyout and reconciles with Terrance. Ari goes out firing employees who might not fit in after his takeover, with Adam Davies also getting the boot. He is now on the road to becoming the most powerful agent in Hollywood. Ari finally promotes Lloyd to agent.

The season ends with Vince and Drama traveling to Rome, to start shooting the &quot;Ferrari&quot; film. Turtle is to meet them there, having traveled all the way from Auckland. Only E stays behind, having successfully proposed marriage to Sloan.

===Seventh season===
As Vince shoots an action film called &quot;The Takeover&quot; directed by Nick Cassavetes, Vince performs a dangerous driving stunt, despite Eric and Ari&#x27;s disapproval. As a result, he crashes the car into the set, but emerges feeling emboldened and invincible. The incident also pushes Vince to seek out new thrills, including impulsively adopting a shorter haircut, sky-diving, purchasing a Harley-Davidson, popping Vicodin pills, and striking up a relationship with pornographic star Sasha Grey. Vince is introduced to a new project, &quot;Air-Walker&quot;, by Eric&#x27;s associate Scott Lavin (Scott Caan), creating a hostile relationship with Eric; they eventually bury the hatchet and temporarily work together to help further Vince&#x27;s career. This friendship eventually ends once Eric realizes Scott possibly supplied Vince with cocaine at a party.

Now running a fledgling car service business, Turtle is frustrated when an employee named Alex (Dania Ramirez) causes problems for him; however, she quits after an inappropriate advance he makes towards her. Turtle&#x27;s business eventually fails, but after reconciling with Alex, she introduces him to some friends in Mexico, who wish to make Vince the face of their tequila company, Avión. Turtle agrees and begins promoting the product. The promotions create a huge demand for it in Southern California, which cannot be met by the company&#x27;s production unless a new factory is built. Looking for potential investors, Turtle pitches the company to Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban and his business partner Ken Austin (Bob Odenkirk), and after a meeting with one of Avion&#x27;s owners, Carlos, Cuban gives him the $5 million needed.

Meanwhile, Lizzie Grant (Autumn Reeser), the promising young agent who had a turbulent affair with Andrew Klein, quits after Ari refuses to promote her to the head of the TV department of the agency (Klein&#x27;s former position) despite her stellar performance. Lizzie attempts to steal some of Ari&#x27;s clients, prompting Ari to take action. Ari learns that Lizzie had gone to Amanda Daniels to try to bring down Ari; however, this alliance is short-lived, as Lizzie decides she wants no part in Amanda&#x27;s revenge plots. An anonymous person sends tapes to &quot;Deadline Hollywood&quot;, revealing Ari&#x27;s foul-mouthed rants. Ari, who was nearing a deal with Jerry Jones to bring an NFL team to Los Angeles, suddenly finds his life in a tailspin. This incident leads Ari&#x27;s wife to &quot;seriously re-evaluate their marriage&quot;, causing Ari to spend more time with his family and attempting a friendlier work environment. His newfound peace is broken when he confronts Amanda at an upper-class restaurant, accusing her of sending the tapes and stealing his NFL team. She reveals that her ex-assistant sent the tapes and that the NFL was reconsidering Ari for their team (with the help of Amanda). She has now lost complete respect for Ari, and the outburst leaves Ari looking foolish in front of many Hollywood executives. Ari&#x27;s relationship with his wife ends on the fence as well as she tells him she wants a break from him.

During this, Scott wants to reconcile with Eric and offers him an opportunity to supplant Murray Berenson at the management company, having already convinced everyone else in the office to go along. Eric refuses as he gets along with Murray because he is Sloan&#x27;s godfather. However, Terrence McQuewick asks Eric to sign a pre-nuptial agreement with Sloan as both he and Murray feel that Eric may just rely on Sloan&#x27;s family money. This causes him to take Scott up on his offer.

Drama wants a job since his holding deal will expire in eight weeks. He finds out new shows are being made by the network, but not for him. Lloyd finds an Emmy Award-winning writer (Jeff Garlin) to write something for Drama, though Drama is disappointed that he hasn&#x27;t written anything since 1991 and that the proposed show would be a comedy. The script turns out to be a good fit for Drama and John Stamos is suggested as a co-star; however, Bob Saget is given Drama&#x27;s role instead due to his friendship with Stamos. Billy Walsh makes a return after starting a family and becoming an ordained minister. Looking for work so that he can provide for his family, he looks to create a new show for Drama. The show, a cartoon called &quot;Johnny&#x27;s Bananas&quot;, is conceptually a hit with the network but it takes a while (and persuasion from Eric&#x27;s assistant) for Drama to get on board. After accepting the offer, Drama, Turtle, Alex, Billy and Lloyd celebrate back at Vince&#x27;s house, where Lloyd discovers a large bag of cocaine belonging to Vince.

Vince&#x27;s drug problems continue to grow, as &quot;Air-Walker&quot; director Randall Wallace becomes suspicious of Vince&#x27;s behavior. Randall quits when Vince refuses to take a drug test and is replaced with Peter Berg. When Vince discovers that Sasha is seriously considering a role in an upcoming porn film, he tries to land her a role in &quot;Air-Walker&quot; instead. He succeeds, but Sasha sees this as a way for Vince to control her life, as evidenced by Vince&#x27;s reckless behavior on the set of Sasha&#x27;s new movie. As a result, Sasha ends their relationship. The guys attempt to stage an intervention for Vince, who refuses to listen to them and decides to spend the night at a hotel. During Eminem&#x27;s party at the hotel, Vince starts a fight with him, and gets beaten up by him and his security. Vince gets taken to the hospital where the police find a bag of cocaine that was in his sweater.

===Eighth season===
Vince is sober after spending three months in rehab and returns home ready to work. He pitches a film idea to his friends about miners, but is not well received among his &quot;entourage&quot;. Eric and Sloan have broken up, mainly because Eric refused to sign a prenuptial agreement and took over Murray Berenson&#x27;s agency with Scott&#x27;s help while both Eric and Scott later work together, creating the &quot;Murphy Lavin Group&quot;. Johnny&#x27;s new show, &quot;Johnny&#x27;s Bananas&quot;, is a potential hit in the making. Still separated, but wanting to get back together, Ari learns his wife is seeing chef Bobby Flay. Hurt, Ari begins seeing Dana Gordon. Turtle burns down part of the house when he accidentally throws out his joint onto the drapes, forcing the group to move into a hotel.

Vince writes a script for the miner movie and receives several tips from Billy Walsh, most notably that the movie would be better served with Drama as the lead, rather than Vince himself. Eric and Sloan have one last &quot;fling&quot; before she tells him that she is moving to New York. Ari makes Lloyd the head of the TV department. Avión owner Carlos reluctantly pushes Turtle to retire, and reveals to him that Alex has left him for someone else. Turtle presents an idea to Vince to start a new company after he sells his stock from Avión. Johnny begins recording &quot;Johnny&#x27;s Bananas&quot; and finds out that the show will be getting its first test screening; co-star Andrew Dice Clay signs with Scott Lavin. Dice pushes Johnny and E to ask the network for more money, they turn him down. Staying true to his word, Dice leaves the show before it airs. Johnny is not happy with his replacement.

Vince meets with producer Carl Ertz (Kim Coates) at his house. Ertz offers to produce his TV movie for Johnny, but in return wants Vince to star in the film &quot;Taxman&quot;. After realizing his mistake and feeling bad, Ertz runs off to the bathroom to get high and subsequently shoots himself in the head. After the shooting, Vince is required to take a drug test by his parole officer as there was cocaine in Ertz&#x27;s house. Worried he will fail the test, as he smoked a joint earlier in the week, he ends up using a device to pass the drug test against E&#x27;s approval.

Ari continues his fling with former flame Dana Gordon. After a bad session of couples therapy, Ari takes Dana out to Bobby Flay&#x27;s restaurant to get back at his wife. Dana learns of Ari&#x27;s real motives and storms out. Melissa then accuses Ari of cheating on her with Dana while they were still together, which Ari immediately denies.
Vince has an interview with &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; writer Sophia Lear (Alice Eve). He opens up to Sophia and tells his story only for the article to call him an &quot;insecure womanizer&quot;. Ari&#x27;s personal and professional lives collide when he realizes that he might lose his share in the company after his divorce is finalized. Eric takes a meeting with Melinda Clarke and ends up having sex with her instead. He is unnerved when he realizes afterwards that her true intentions were to get back at her ex.

Drama tries to get Andrew Dice Clay back on his show, and instead ends up going on strike alongside him. However, Phil Yagoda (William Fichtner) and CBS agree to pay them more, ending the strike and green-lighting &quot;Johnny&#x27;s Bananas&quot; once again. Vince tries to meet with Sophia to change her perception of him, but is instead rejected. Turtle meets with his new business partners, but they&#x27;re more interested in the &quot;Hollywood glam&quot; than anything else. Things get worse when he realizes that Avión has gone public and that he sold his share too soon.

Vince and Ari realize that Phil is upset with Drama going on strike, so Vince offers him $100,000 in exchange for him forgiving Drama and producing the miner movie with him. In the meantime, Turtle and Drama each speak with Sophia, and try to steer her towards going out with Vince, which she ultimately does. Turtle is sulking over the Avión deal, until Vince tells him that he never sold his share, and bought Turtle&#x27;s share for him as well. Vince&#x27;s original investment of $1.1 million is now worth $15 million and Turtle&#x27;s $300,000 is worth $4 million. Vince, Drama and Turtle toast to redemption. Meanwhile, Eric gets word that Sloan is out with his client Johnny Galecki, so he and Melinda crash their date. Tensions mount and Eric finds out that Sloan is pregnant with his child and that she still intends to move to New York without him.

In the final episode, Vince tells the gang that he&#x27;s flying to Paris in a few hours to marry Sophia. Eric quits his job and announces that he&#x27;s moving to New York to try to be a good father for his child. Turtle and Drama try to convince Sloan to forgive Eric and fly to Paris for the wedding. She&#x27;s on the fence, until Vince seals the deal by giving her a heartfelt speech about Eric. In the meantime, Ari quits his job for his family and reconciles with his wife. In the end, the entourage meets up at the airport where Sloan forgives Eric and together they fly away to a destination of their choice, compliments of Vince. Meanwhile, Vince, Sophia, Drama, Turtle, Ari and Melissa fly to Paris for Vince&#x27;s wedding while Scott stays behind in Los Angeles, presumably to continue looking after the day-to-day running of the &quot;Murphy Lavin Group&quot; agency.

In the post-credits scene, Ari and Melissa are busy resting on the Amalfi Coast when John Ellis suddenly calls up Ari. John explains to Ari that he wants to retire, and wants him to take his place as chairman and CEO of Time Warner. The final scene shows Ari contemplating the offer.

==Feature film==

In August 2010, when it was confirmed that &quot;Entourage&quot; would end after its eighth season, creator Doug Ellin expressed interest in writing a film after the series ended.

In September 2012, it was confirmed that Ellin had completed the script and that it would take place six months after the end of the series. In January 2013, the film was officially green-lit, and it was confirmed that Ellin would direct it and Warner Bros. would distribute. However, by September 2013, amid reports that there had been significant delays in production and contract issues with the film&#x27;s cast, Ellin stated the film was &quot;less and less likely every day.&quot; In October 2013, the cast reached a deal, confirming the film would move forward. Principal photography began on February 19, 2014, and the film stars Kevin Connolly, Adrian Grenier, Kevin Dillon, Jerry Ferrara, Jeremy Piven, Rex Lee, Debi Mazar, Perrey Reeves, Emmanuelle Chriqui, Rhys Coiro, and new characters played by Billy Bob Thornton and Haley Joel Osment. The film was released on June 3, 2015, to critical and commercial disappointment.

==Themes and characteristics==

===Male friendship===
A recurring theme in &quot;Entourage&quot; is the strength of male camaraderie and its importance over work. Series creator Doug Ellin stated, &quot;&quot;Entourage&quot; works because it&#x27;s about male friendship. The Hollywood setting is entertaining but it&#x27;s really about the relationship between these guys.&quot; He later added that, &quot;Ultimately, the show&#x27;s theme is friendship and family. The characters may have the bling, but they&#x27;re grounded guys who look out for each other. That&#x27;s the backbone of the show. If it was just about fantasy lifestyles, it wouldn&#x27;t be relatable.&quot;

This view was supported by Jeremy Piven, who plays the talent agent, Ari: &quot;If it was just a show about wish fulfillment and guys getting (sex) because their best friend was famous, it wouldn&#x27;t be that interesting.&quot;

To strengthen the bond between the actors, only actors with ties to New York were chosen.

===Hollywood lifestyle===
Episodes of the show focus, besides the friendship between the four main characters, on their lifestyle in Hollywood. To lend credence to the show&#x27;s situations and locations, most episodes of &quot;Entourage&quot; feature at least one celebrity guest star, appearing as themselves.

==Critical reception==
&quot;Entourage&quot; received positive reviews from critics during the majority of its run, with many praising Piven&#x27;s performance as agent Ari Gold and Dillon&#x27;s performance as Johnny Chase. On Metacritic, the show has scores of 68/100 for season 1, 73/100 for season 3, 70/100 for season 5, 61/100 for season 7, and 62/100 for season 8. &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; commented on the writing, saying it &quot;is almost always smart, sharp and funny.&quot; Ken Tucker of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, called season 3 &quot;Almost preposterously enjoyable.&quot;

In 2009, Tucker remarked regarding the sixth-season premiere, that &quot;the show really isn&#x27;t that funny anymore&quot;. Season 7, while still gaining generally favorable reviews, had a much more mixed reception than the earlier seasons because &quot;it all feels maybe a little too familiar.&quot; The eighth and final season of the show was met with mixed reviews from critics, and it holds a 46% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 28 reviews with a consensus of, &quot;The familiar faces are always a comfort, but with &quot;Entourage&quot;&#x27;s best stories behind it, the series finale feels like a merciful end.&quot;

==Awards and nominations==
The series was nominated for 26 Primetime Emmy Awards, with six wins, in categories such as acting, directing, writing and for Outstanding Comedy Series. Jeremy Piven was nominated four consecutive times for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series, winning the award three times in a row in 2006, 2007, and 2008. Kevin Dillon received three consecutive nominations in 2007, 2008, and 2009, for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series. The series was nominated in 2007, 2008, and 2009 for Outstanding Comedy Series. It also received six directing nominations and one writing nomination.

It was nominated for 14 Golden Globe Awards, with Piven and the series being nominated every year. Piven won the Supporting Actor award in 2008. Dillon received a nomination in the Supporting Actor category alongside Piven in 2008, while Kevin Connolly was nominated alongside Piven in 2009.

It was nominated for six Screen Actors Guild Awards–Piven independently and the ensemble cast, four Directors Guild of America Awards, four Producers Guild of America Awards–winning in 2006, and four Writers Guild of America Awards. It also won a Peabody Award in 2008 &quot;for its picaresque and pointed take on Tinsel Town.&quot;

==Home media==
All eight seasons have been released on DVD; with the third season being released in two parts. The sixth, seventh, and eighth seasons have also been released on Blu-ray Disc. A complete series collection, containing all the seasons, and special features from the individual season releases, has been released on both DVD and Blu-ray on November 6, 2012.

==Syndication==
&quot;Entourage&quot; is syndicated, often broadcast on HBO, and is also carried in full through HBO Max and HBO&#x27;s depreciated streaming services; two cuts were created, the original aired by HBO, and a syndicated cut with nudity, sexual content and profanity removed, which is aired in some countries as the default cut to meet local mores.

In the United States, the series was syndicated on local stations and WGN America beginning September 13, 2010, but was only carried for one season, due to low ratings. The series was also syndicated by Spike TV in an attempt to improve their late night ratings. Spike quickly reduced, then ended the contract to carry the series, also due to low ratings; the series often drew lower numbers than much older library or syndicated content, and even the paid programming that followed episodes of the show overnights.

==Promotional material==
Dillon and Ferrara appeared as their &quot;Entourage&quot; personalities in a set of commercials for the video game &quot;Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit&quot;. In the commercials, the guys are valets during the day, and racers (Turtle) and interceptors (Drama) at night.

Nike SB collaborated with creator Doug Ellin to commemorate the final season with an &quot;Entourage&quot;-branded version of their Nike SB shoes, which was featured on the series. However, these shoes are exclusively for the families of the cast and crew.

As a way to promote the &quot;Entourage&quot; film, a memoir/self-help book titled &quot;The Gold Standard: Rules to Rule By&quot; written in the style of character Ari Gold was released on May 12, 2015.

<doc id="907287" wikidata="Q9097353" url="?curid=907287" title="Yúcahu">
<text>Yúcahu —also written as Yucáhuguama Bagua Maórocoti, Yukajú, Yocajú, Yokahu or Yukiyú— was the masculine spirit of fertility in Taíno mythology. He was the supreme deity or zemi of the Pre-Columbian Taíno people along with his mother Atabey who was his feminine counterpart. Dominant in the Caribbean region at the time of Columbus’ First voyages of Discovery, the peoples associated with Taíno culture inhabited the islands of the Bahamas, the Greater Antilles, and the Lesser Antilles.

==Mythology==
Yúcahu was the supreme deity of the Taíno people. &quot;They call him Yúcahu Bagua Maórocoti&quot; is the earliest mention of the zemí taken from the first page of Fray Ramón Pané&#x27;s &quot;Account of the Antiquities of the Indians&quot;. As the Taíno did not possess a written language, the name is the phonetic spelling as recorded by the Spanish missionaries, Ramón Pané, and Bartolomé de las Casas. The three names are thought to represent the Great Spirit&#x27;s epithets. Yúcahu means spirit or giver of cassava. Bagua has been interpreted as meaning both &quot;the sea&quot; itself and &quot;master of the sea.&quot; The name Maórocoti implies that he was conceived without male intervention. He was also later known as &quot;El Gigante Dormido&quot;, or &quot;Sleeping Giant&quot;. 

The Taíno had a well developed creation myth, which was mostly passed down via oral tradition. According to this account, in the beginning there was only Atabey, who created the heavens. However, there was still a void, where nothingness prevailed. The heavens were inactive and any action was meaningless. Earth and the other cosmic entities laid barren. Despite being dominated by darkness, Atabey herself failed to notice that this universe was incomplete. Eventually she decided to create two new deities, Yucáhu and Guacar, from magic and intangible elements. Atabey now felt confident that her creation could be completed and left it in charge of her sons. Yucáhu took over as a creation deity, becoming a universal architect and gathering the favour of his mother. From his dwelling in the heavens, he contemplated and awoke the Earth from its slumber. As part of this process, two new deities emerged from a cave. Boinael and Maroya, controlling the sun and moon respectively, which were tasked with illuminating the new world day and night. No longer would the Earth be shrouded by darkness. Yucáhu was satisfied with his work, but in a fit of jealousy Guacar hid within the heavens, never to be seen again. Now bored, Yucáhu roamed and noticed four gemstones that lied in the ground, which he took and converted into the celestial star beings, who reproduced and spread throughout the universe, where they guide the deities. He followed this by creating animals, granting them dwellings and teaching them how to live. Yucáhu then had a revelation, believing that something else should complete his creation. Convinced that the new entity should be neither animal nor deity, he pondered this profoundly. Yucáhu then opened a rift in the heavens from which emerged the first man, whom he granted a soul and named Locuo. This man would roam the Earth endlessly filled by joy and thanking the deity for his creation. Finally satisfied with his creation, Yucáhu left the world in the hands of humanity, feeling that balance had been reached.

Yúcahu became known as the deity of agriculture, as well as the zemi of peace and tranquility, he represented goodness. This was contrasted greatly by the goddess Guabancex (more commonly, but erroneously, known as Juracán) whose fierce nature was regarded as responsible for persuading other zemis in order to bring forth chaos and who was associated with the more aggressive Caribs. Yúcahu was believed to have a throne in El Yunque peak, the largest mountain found in the tropical El Yunque National Forest reserve, where he resided in the same manner that the Greek gods did in Mount Olympus. The Taíno referred to the peak as &quot;yuké&quot;, or &quot;The White Lands&quot;, in reference to the thick cloud shroud that always surrounds it. This mountain range diverts the wind of hurricanes, minimizing the damage that the storms do to the lower parts of the island. Noticing this, the natives interpreted this as Yúcahu confronting Guabancex and her cohorts over the safety of his worshipers. Located in the northern mountains of Puerto Rico, the region where El Yunke is located was originally known as &quot;Yukiyu&quot;, a name that became associated with the deity. Following the Spanish colonization, it became known under the Hispanized variant of Luquillo, a name that remains in use.

== Modern usage ==
===Religious===
Adaptations of traditional Taíno religion are practiced by a number of neo-Taíno groups, featuring Yúcahu as part of their pantheons.

===Cultural===
As with other mythologies, Taíno religion and the good/evil (in this case Yúcahu/Juracán) dichotomy has been adapted for comic books, in particular being central as the source of supernatural superpowers in Edgardo Miranda Rodríguez&#x27;s La Borinqueña.

Preceding the impending passing of hurricanes Irma and Maria over Puerto Rico during the 2017 Atlantic hurricane season, artistic representations depicting an updated model of Yúcahu (as the sentient embodiment of El Yunque, distinguished by a humanoid form composed by the forest&#x27;s vegetation) became widespread in social media as a method to boost the population&#x27;s morale.

<doc id="907292" wikidata="Q613006" url="?curid=907292" title="Nizam of Hyderabad">
<text>Nizam of Hyderabad was the title of the ruler of Hyderabad State ( part of the Indian state of Telangana, and the Kalyana-Karnataka region of Karnataka). &quot;Nizam&quot; is a shortened form of (; ), and was the title bestowed upon Asaf Jah I when he was appointed Viceroy of the Deccan by the Mughal Emperor Farrukhsiyar. In addition to being the Mughal Viceroy (&quot;Naib&quot;) of the Deccan, Asaf Jah I was also the premier courtier of the Mughal Empire until 1724, when he established an independent realm based in Hyderabad, but in practice, continued to recognise the nominal authority of emperor.

The Asaf Jahi dynasty was founded by Chin Qilich Khan (Asaf Jah I), who served as a &quot;Naib&quot; of the Deccan sultanates under the Mughal Empire from 1713 to 1721. He intermittently ruled the region after Emperor Aurangzeb&#x27;s death in 1707. In 1724 Mughal control weakened, and Asaf Jah became virtually independent. Later the Nizam defeated the Marathas with the alliance of the British.

When the English East India Company achieved paramountcy over the Indian subcontinent, they allowed the Nizams to continue to rule their princely states as client kings. The Nizams retained internal power over Hyderabad State until 17 September 1948, when Hyderabad was integrated into the new Indian Union.

The Asaf Jahi dynasty had only seven recognized rulers, but there was a period of 13 unstable years after the rule of the first Nizam when two of his sons, Nasir Jung,and Salabath Jung, and grandson Muzafur Jung ruled. They were never officially recognised as rulers. The seventh and last Nizam, Mir Osman Ali Khan, fell from power when India annexed Hyderabad State in 1948 in Operation Polo. Today, the title is held by his great grandson and pretender, Azmet Jah.

==History==

===Etymology===
The title &quot;Nizam&quot; comes from the Persian نظام /nɪˈzɑːm/, which itself is derived from Arabic &quot;niẓām&quot; which means &quot;order&quot; or &quot;arrangement&quot;, and was typically given to high ranking state officials.

===Descent===

According to Sir Roper Lethbridge in &quot;The Golden Book of India&quot; (1893), the Nizams are lineally descended from the First Caliph Abu Bakr, the successor of the Islamic prophet Muhammed. The family of Nizams in India is descended from Abid Khan, a Persian from Samarkand, whose lineage is traced to Sufi Shihab-ud-Din Suhrawardi (1154–91) of Suhraward in Iran. In the early 1650s, on his way to hajj, Abid Khan stopped in Deccan, where the young prince Aurangzeb, then Governor of Deccan, cultivated him. Abid Khan returned to the service of Aurangzeb to fight in the succession wars of 1657–58. After Aurangzeb&#x27;s enthronement, Abid Khan was richly rewarded and became Aurangzeb&#x27;s favourite nobleman. His son Ghazi Uddin Khan was married to Safiya Khanum, the daughter of the former imperial Grand Vizier (prime minister) Sa&#x27;dullah Khan. Mir Qamaruddin Khan, the founder of the line of Nizams, was born of the couple, thus descending from two prominent families of the Mughal court.

Ghazi Uddin Khan rose to become a General of the Emperor Aurangzeb and played a vital role in conquering Bijapur and Golconda Sultanates of Southern India in 1686. He also played a key role in thwarting the rebellion by Prince Akbar and alleged rebellion by Prince Mu`azzam.After Aurangzeb&#x27;s death and during the war of succession, Qamaruddin and his father remained neutral thus escaping the risk of being on the losing side; they remained marginal players in the Mughal court during the reigns of Bahadur Shah I (1707–12) and Jahandar Shah (1712–13). Their successor Farrukhsiyar (1713–19) appointed Qamaruddin the governor of Deccan in 1713, awarding him the title &quot;Nizam-ul-Mulk&quot;. However, the governorship was taken away two years later and Qamaruddin withdrew to his estate in Moradabad. Under the next emperor, Muhammad Shah (1719–48), Qamaruddin accepted the governorship of Deccan for the second time in 1721. The next year, following the death of his uncle Muhammad Amin Khan, a power-broker in the Mughal Court, Qamaruddin returned to Delhi and was made the &quot;wazir&quot; (prime minister). According to historian Faruqui, his tenure as prime minister was undermined by his opponents and a rebellion in Deccan was engineered against him. In 1724, the Nizam returned to Deccan to reclaim his base, in the process making a transition to a semi-independent ruler.

===Reign===

In 1724, Asaf Jah I defeated Mubariz Khan to establish autonomy over the &quot;Deccan Suba&quot;, named the region &quot;Hyderabad Deccan&quot;, and started what came to be known as the Asaf Jahi dynasty. Subsequent rulers retained the title &quot;Nizam ul-Mulk&quot; and were referred to as Asaf Jahi Nizams, or Nizams of Hyderabad. Nizam I never formally declared independence from the Mughals; he still flew the Mughal flag, and was never crowned. In Friday prayers, the sermon would be conducted in the name of Aurangzeb, and this tradition continued until the end of Hyderabad State in 1948. The death of Asaf Jah I in 1748 resulted in a period of political unrest as his sons, backed by opportunistic neighbouring states and colonial foreign forces, contended for the throne. The accession of Asif Jah II, who reigned from 1762 to 1803, ended the instability. In 1768, he signed the treaty of Machilipatnam, surrendering the coastal region to the East India Company in return for a fixed annual rent.

Following the decline of the Mughal power, the region of Deccan saw the rise of the Maratha Empire. The titular Nizams themselves fought during the Mughal-Maratha Wars since the 1720s, which resulted in the Nizam paying a regular tax (&quot;Chauth&quot;) to the Marathas. The major battles fought between the Marathas and the Nizam include Palkhed, Bhopal, Rakshasbhuvan, and Kharda, in all of which the Nizam lost. Following the conquest of Deccan by Bajirao I and the imposition of &quot;Chauth&quot; by him, the Nizam essentially remained a tributary of the Marathas.

In 1805, after the East India Company&#x27;s victory in the Second Anglo-Maratha War, the Nizam of Hyderabad came under their protection.. In 1858, the state of Hyderabad became part of the British Indian Empire as a princely state with full autonomy albeit under colonial rule and was subject to the British Crown. 

From 1876 to 1948, the Nizam recognised the Crown as paramount ruler of India as the monarch of the United Kingdom simultaneously held the title of emperor of India (first held by Queen Victoria as empress and the last being George VI as emperor) 

In 1903, the Berar region of the state was separated and merged into the Central Provinces of British India, to form the Central Provinces and Berar. 

During the Second World War, 80,000 men who were raised by the Nizam to form a personal army under the Indian State Forces, known as the 19th Hyderabad Regiment served in Malaya, North Africa, Persia, Singapore and Burma

The last Nizam of Hyderabad state, Mir Osman Ali Khan crowned in 1911, had been the richest man in the world in his time. The Nizams developed the railway, introduced electricity, and developed roads, airways, irrigation and reservoirs; in fact, all major public buildings in Hyderabad City were built during his reign during the period of British rule in India. He pushed education, science, and the establishment of Osmania University forward.

In 1947, at the time of the partition of India, the British government offered the 565 princely states in the sub-continent the options of acceding to either India or Pakistan or remaining independent.

===End of the dynasty===

After the Independence of India in 1947, the Nizam of Hyderabad chose to join neither the Dominion of India nor the Dominion of Pakistan. He later declared Hyderabad an independent state as the third Dominion, attempting to become an independent monarchy in the British Commonwealth, sharing King George VI as head of state (since at that time members are required to share the king as head of state). Not only the Government of India, but George VI who was head of the organization, the last emperor of India before independence and most crucially, the incumbent monarch of India rejected the notion. After attempts by India to persuade the Nizam to accede to India failed, and due to large-scale atrocities committed by Razakars (who wanted the Nizam to accede Hyderabad to Pakistan) on the Hindu populace, the Indian government finally launched a military operation named Operation Polo. The Indian Army invaded Hyderabad on 13 September 1948 and defeated his untrained forces. The Nizam capitulated on 17 September 1948; that same afternoon he broadcast the news over the State radio network. The Nizam was forced to accept accession to the new Union of India. His abdication on 17 September 1948 ended the dynasty&#x27;s ambitions. Nevertheless, he became the Rajpramukh postindependence based on public vote. He died on Friday, 24 February, 1967. 

All Nizams are buried in royal graves at the Makkah Masjid near Charminar in Hyderabad excepting the last, who wished to be buried beside his mother, in the graveyard of Judi Mosque facing King Kothi Palace.

==State wealth==

During the period of the Nizams&#x27; rule, Hyderabad became wealthy - thanks to the Golconda mines which were the only sources of diamonds in the world market at that time (apart from South African mines) making the 7th Nizam the richest person in the world. Osman Ali Khan, Asaf Jah VII and his family including Salar Jung I were taught by Nawab Sarwar Ul Mulk and Agha Mirza Baig Bahadur, who was his political advisor, and the senior-most salute state among the Indian princely states. It was spread over in the Deccan, ruled by the Asaf Jahi dynasty. The Nizams were conferred with the title of His Exalted Highness, and &quot;Faithful Ally of the British Government&quot; for their roles in the Second and Third Anglo-Mysore Wars and the Indian Rebellion of 1857, becoming the only Indian prince to be given both these titles.

One example of the wealth of the Nizams is the Jewels of the Nizams, an international tourist attraction once displayed in Salar Jung Museum, but now locked in a Reserve Bank of India vault in Delhi. In 1948 Hyderabad state had an estimated population of 17 million (1.7 crore), and it generated an estimated annual revenue of £90,029,000.

The state had its currency known as the Hyderabadi rupee, until 1951. The pace at which the last Nizam Mir Osman Ali Khan amassed wealth made him one of the world&#x27;s richest men in 1937, also known for his miserliness. He was estimated to be worth 660 crores (roughly 2 billion by the then exchange rates). According to the &quot;Forbes All-Time Wealthiest List&quot; of 2008, Nizam Mir Osman Ali Khan is the fifth richest man in recorded history per the figures, with an estimated worth of 210.8 billion adjusted by Forbes as per the growth of the US GDP since that period and the present exchange rate of the US dollar against the Indian rupee.

===Institutions===

The Nizams set up numerous institutions in the name of the dynasty including hospitals, schools, colleges, and universities that imparted education in Urdu. Inspired by the Indian Civil Service, the Nizams established their own local Hyderabad Civil Service.

===Infrastructure===

The Nizams commissioned engineering projects such as large reservoirs like Osman Sagar and Himayat Sagar. Survey work on the Nagarjuna Sagar Dam was also initiated during this time, although the actual work was completed under the aegis of the Government of India in 1969.

They also gave Hyderabad its railway network - the Nizam&#x27;s Guaranteed State Railway which helped in setting up various industries. 

Other landmarks include the Telangana High Court, City College, Public Gardens (formerly &quot;Bagh-e-Aaam&quot;), Jubilee Hall, Asafia Library, The Assembly building, Niloufer Hospital, the Osmania Arts College and the Osmania Medical College.

===Donation for compilation of Mahabharata===

In 1932, there was a need for money for the publication of Mahabharata in the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute located in Pune. A formal request was made to the 7th Nizam, who granted Rs. 1000 per year for 11 years.

He also gave Rs 50,000 for construction of the guest house which stands today as &quot;Nizam&#x27;s guest house&quot;.

===Donation to Hindu Temples===

The Nizams donated Rs. 82,825 to the Yadagirigutta temple near Bhongir and Rs. 29,999 to Sita Ramachandraswamy temple, Bhadrachalam.

The 7th Nizam also donated Rs. 8,000 to Tirupati Balaji Temple as yearly grants.

A donation of Rs. 50,000 towards the reconstruction of Sitarambagh temple located in the old city of Hyderabad was also made.

He also donated 1,525 acres of Land to &quot;Sita Rama Swami Temple&quot; located in Devaryamjal

<text>Lee Chong Wei (; born 21 October 1982) is a Malaysian former professional badminton player. As a singles player, Lee was ranked first worldwide for 349 weeks, including a 199-week streak from 21 August 2008 to 14 June 2012. He is the fifth Malaysian player after Foo Kok Keong, Rashid Sidek, Roslin Hashim and Wong Choong Hann to achieve such a ranking (since official rankings were first kept in the 1980s), and is the only Malaysian shuttler who has held the number one ranking for more than a year.
On 2 May 2023, Lee was inducted to BWF Badminton Hall of Fame. He is widely regarded as one of the greatest badminton players of all time.

Lee is a triple silver medalist at the Olympic Games, and the sixth Malaysian to win an Olympic medal. He won his first silver medal in 2008, also the first time a Malaysian had reached the finals in the men&#x27;s singles event. This achievement earned him the title Datuk. He repeated the achievement twice more in 2012 and 2016, thus making him the most successful Malaysian Olympian in history.

On 13 June 2019, Lee announced his retirement after struggling to return to full fitness following a nose cancer diagnosis. He was appointed as Malaysia&#x27;s chef de mission for the 2020 Summer Olympics, but skipped the event due to his health concerns. He retained his role, albeit serving it virtually.

==Early life==
Lee was born in Bagan Serai, Perak, into a Malaysian Chinese family, to Lee Ah Chai and Khor Kim Choi. In his early years, he favoured basketball, however his mother soon banned him from the game due to the searing heat of the outdoor basketball court. Lee began to learn badminton at the age of 11, when his father, who liked to play the game, brought him to the badminton hall. He attracted the attention of local coach Teh Peng Huat, who asked Lee&#x27;s father if he could take him as a student. After receiving his father&#x27;s consent, Teh began to train Lee after school. Discovered by Misbun Sidek, he was drafted into the national squad in 2000 when he was seventeen years old.

==Career==

===2002–2007===
Lee picked up only one minor title during the 2002 and 2003 seasons. He reached his first final of a major tournament at the 2003 Malaysia Open where he was defeated by Chen Hong of China. Lee then secured two titles in 2004, the Malaysia Open and the Chinese Taipei Open. Lee gained a spot for the 2004 Olympic Games in Athens. In his first Olympic appearance, Lee defeated Ng Wei of Hong Kong in the first round. His journey ended in the second round when he was defeated by Chen Hong. Lee scored another two titles in 2005, his second Malaysia Open title and the Denmark Open. Lee won a bronze in his first appearance in the world meet, the 2005 World Championships after losing to eventual winner Taufik Hidayat in the semi-final.

Lee won three titles out of six finals in 2006. He was crowned as the winner of the Swiss Open, Asian Badminton Championships and his third Malaysia Open title. He also reached the final of the Chinese Taipei Open, Macau Open and Hong Kong Open. In the Malaysia Open, Lee fought back from 13 to 20 down in the rubber match and saved eight match points against Lin Dan, and finally won the game with a score of 23–21 to secure the title. Lee won Malaysia&#x27;s two gold medals in the badminton event for 2006 Commonwealth Games, in both the men&#x27;s singles and mixed team events. Lee reached the top spot twice in the Badminton World Federation&#x27;s world rankings in 2006, and he participated in the World Championships as top seed. However, he was upset by Bao Chunlai of China in the quarter-final despite Lee winning at their previous meeting. The match was also marred by two controversial line calls that were not in favour of Lee.

During the 2007 season, Lee failed to reach the final of the Malaysia Open for the first time in five years. He also suffered an early exit in five competitions afterward. Later on that season he took the Indonesia Open crown, his first title since the 2006 Malaysia Open after reuniting with former coach Misbun Sidek from Li Mao. His performance at the second half of the year was solid, as he achieved three titles in the Philippines Open, the Japan Open, and the French Open. He also managed to reach the final of the China Open and Hong Kong Open, despite his knee injury haunting him on both occasions. Lee won all matches he played in the Sudirman Cup in June, despite Malaysia finishing just fifth in the tournament. Lee&#x27;s low point of the year was in the World Championships, despite the tournament being held in front of his home crowd and his solid performance during the second half of the year, he was defeated in the third round by Indonesia&#x27;s Sony Dwi Kuncoro. Lee criticised the chief coach, Yap Kim Hock for treating him indifferently and putting pressure on him before the world championships. While the chief of Badminton Association of Malaysia, Datuk Nadzmi Mohd Salleh encouraged Lee and the chief coach, Yap Kim Hock to improve their relationship.

===2008===
Lee kicked off 2008 with success, capturing his fourth Malaysia Open title in five years. However, Lee only captured one more other title that year, the Singapore Open, which was the final tournament in his pre-Olympic preparations. Other tournaments he took part in were the Korea Open; the All England Open; the Swiss Open; the Badminton Asia Championships; and Thomas Cup in Jakarta, Indonesia where Lee helped Malaysia advance to the semi-final. In the semi-final he defeated Lin Dan to give Malaysia a 1–0 lead in its clash with defending champion China, but Malaysia eventually lost 2–3 due to the defeat of its first doubles team in the vital final match.

In the 2008 Olympic Games, Lee was given a bye in the first round. He cruised to straight game victories over Ronald Susilo in the second round, Kęstutis Navickas in the third round, and Sony Dwi Kuncoro in the quarter-finals. In the semi-finals Lee Hyun-il gave him a tough fight, but eventually Lee was able to beat the South Korean and reach the final. However, it was a one-sided final, as Lee was completely outplayed by Lin Dan and salvaged only 20 points, losing 12–21, 8–21. He came second place overall.

Lee participated in several tournaments after the Olympic Games without capturing a title. He advanced to the finals of the Japan Open, the Macau Open and the China Open, but lost to Sony Dwi Kuncoro, Taufik Hidayat, and Lin Dan respectively. In the French Open Lee was eliminated in the semi-finals. His coach, Misbun Sidek, cited the pressure of being ranked world number one to explain Lee&#x27;s recent failure to capture a title.

Lee ended his last Super Series tournament of the year, the Hong Kong Open, with a sudden withdrawal due to a knee injury, conceding a walkover to Germany&#x27;s Marc Zwiebler. His last minute withdrawal led to the Chinese media tagging him as the &quot;weakest world number one&quot;. The Chinese media speculated that three factors had hampered Lee&#x27;s performance since the Olympic Games: the stress of the Olympic final, a phobia of Lin Dan due to his lopsided Olympic defeat at Lin&#x27;s hands, and (echoing Misbun Sidek&#x27;s conjecture) the pressure of being the world number one.

Despite Lee&#x27;s difficulties in international play, he recorded his seventh consecutive victory at the National Badminton Grand Prix Final in Kedah on 12 December 2008, thus breaking the record of six consecutive titles set by Misbun Sidek. Lee ended the year with a title in the Super Series Masters Finals. However, Lin Dan and China&#x27;s other top players did not compete, their association citing injuries and fatigue.

===2009===
Lee Chong Wei started the 2009 season with his fifth Malaysia Open title. He failed to secure his first Korea Open and All England Open title despite marching into the final. However, he secured his second title of the year in the Swiss Open which was held in Basel, defeating Lin Dan in straight sets and marking his first win in the finals against the Chinese opponent outside home turf.

Next, Lee was defeated by Chen Long of China in the India Open. Lee claimed he lost because of food poisoning and insisted that authorities improve the conditions before the World Championships. In May, Lee helped Malaysia reach the semi-finals of the Sudirman Cup, the first in national history, despite his unbeaten record in the tournament being blown out by Lin Dan. He won another two titles in June, the Indonesia Open and the Malaysia Open Grand Prix Gold, despite failing to defend his Singapore Open title when he was taken by Nguyễn Tiến Minh in the second round.

Lee kicked off the second half of the season with defeat by Sony Dwi Kuncoro in the world meets, but went on to win the Macau Open in August. He reached the semi-final in the China Masters, but once again failed to beat his all time rival Lin Dan. Then, Lee participated in the Japan Open. He only managed to reach the second round of the Open, before winning the Hong Kong Open in November. His inconsistency saw him tumble down in the first round of the China Open. In December, Lee defended his Super Series Masters Finals title, which saw the competition played without the top badminton players in the world.

===2010===
Lee started the year with the title in all events he took part, his first treble in the Super Series titles. He gained his first ever Korea Open crown, sixth Malaysia Open, and defeated Kenichi Tago to win the oldest and most prestigious badminton championship in the world, the All England Open, his first since he took part in 2004.

Lee participated in the Thomas Cup in his home ground. He managed to defeat Kenichi Tago and take the first point, despite Malaysia&#x27;s eventual loss (2–3) to Japan. In the quarter-finals, he beat Peter Gade, thus helping to secure Malaysia&#x27;s place in the semi-finals. In the semi-finals against China, Lee was defeated by Lin Dan, which ended his 18-match unbeaten record since the start of the year.

In June, Lee participated in the Singapore Open losing in the quarter-finals. However, Lee bounced back winning the Indonesia Open, Malaysian Open Grand Prix Gold in July, and Macau Open in August. In late August, Lee suffered a shock exit in another attempt for the World Championships, but was beaten by Taufik Hidayat in the quarter-finals. Misbun cited that the loss was due to the back injury he picked up after the match against Rajiv Ouseph in the third round. On 26 September, Lee beat his archrival Lin Dan in the Japan Open, the only title not taken by Chinese players in the tournament.

In October, he helped Malaysia to beat India to defend the gold medal at the 2010 Commonwealth Games mixed team event, then he successfully defended his gold medal once again in the singles event a few days later. The following month he won a silver medal at the Asian Games. Despite beating reigning World Champion Chen Jin in the semi-final, Lee once again tasted defeat at the hands of his rival, Lin Dan, in the final. At season&#x27;s end, he won his second consecutive Hong Kong Open title, and third consecutive Super Series Master Finals title, where the tournament was held in January 2011.

===2011===
In January, Lee won his seventh Malaysia Open title by defeating Taufik Hidayat from Indonesia in the final. However, he failed to defend the Korea Open title, the world&#x27;s first ever million-dollar badminton tournament, after being beaten by Lin Dan from China in three games. In March, Lee cruised into the final of the All England Open for the third consecutive time and retained his title successfully with a convincing straight games victory over Lin Dan, and was praised by prime minister Najib Tun Razak.

On Labour Day, he won his first ever India Open, and also his third consecutive Malaysia Open Grand Prix Gold title a week later. Despite the fact that Lee won all the matches he played during the Sudirman Cup, Malaysia&#x27;s journey ended in quarterfinals, after being beaten by South Korea 2–3. In late June, he won the Indonesia Open, becoming the first non-Indonesian player to complete the hat-trick in the tournament.

Lee&#x27;s hopes of becoming the first Malaysian to win gold in the World Championships were dashed after defeat by Lin Dan in the final. Lee led for most of the match but lost two important match points in the rubber game. In September, Lee also failed to defend his Japan Open crown after losing to China&#x27;s rising star Chen Long. In October, he lost to Chen Long again in his bid for his second Denmark Open title. He won the French Open a week later. This was followed by triple semi-finals exit in the Hong Kong Open, the China Open, and the Super Series Master Finals.

===2012===

Lee started the Olympic year with the first Super Series tournament of the season, the Korea Open. In a repeat of the previous year&#x27;s final, he avenged his loss to Lin Dan by defeating him in three sets. A week later, he captured his fifth straight and eighth Malaysia Open title, thus equalling the number of home titles held by Wong Peng Soon who won them between 1940 and 1953.

In March, Lee lost in the All England Open when he bowed out in the second game after receiving medical help on three occasions. This also dashed Lee&#x27;s hopes of becoming the first man to win three successive All England Open titles. In April, he was defeated by South Korean Shon Wan-ho in the final of the India Open, but retained his Malaysia Open Grand Prix Gold title for the fourth time in a row in May. Lee was out for three to four weeks after suffering an ankle injury during the Thomas Cup Group C tie against Denmark.

Lee returned to the court for the first time after recovering from his injury to play in the London Olympic Games. He closely beat Ville Lång of Finland in rubber games for the first round, and blamed pressure for the close defeat. In the second round, he eased to a victory against Indonesia&#x27;s Simon Santoso, before beating Kashyap Parupalli of India in the quarter-finals. In the semi-finals, he beat Chen Long of China in straight sets despite early predictions that Chen would be difficult to beat, and set up a repeat of 2008&#x27;s final against Lin Dan. This was the second meeting in the Wembley Arena for both players after the 2011 World Championships. Lee led the match after winning the first game but Lin brought it to the rubber games. Despite leading for most of the time in the third game, Lin managed to level the point and edge him narrowly by 21–19, forcing Lee to settle for silver once more. BBC Sport analyst Gail Emms said, &quot;You couldn&#x27;t have asked for any more from Lee Chong Wei.&quot; This epic episode was documented in an academic article entitled &quot;Silver lining in winning silver: an exploratory study of supporters’ reactions and coping on the social media towards Lee Chong Wei&#x27;s London Olympics defeat&quot;.

He won the Japan Open and Denmark Open on his return since the London Olympic Games, but lost in the final of the Hong Kong Open, only a few days after his marriage. Lee ended the year with a loss in the opening match of the Super Series Master Finals and subsequently pulled out of tournament due to a thigh injury.

===2013===

Lee took the Korea Open title for the third time. A week later, he captured his ninth Malaysia Open title, which broke the record of eight titles previously held by Wong Peng Soon. Lee then lost in the final of the All England Open to Chen Long. Lee said he was disappointed with his performance during the tournament, despite marching into the final.

In April, he lost in the semi-finals of the Australia Open to the young Chinese player Tian Houwei. He then won his second India Open title and fifth Indonesia Open. In August, Lee marched into the final of the World Championships, but his hopes were once again dashed in a repeat of his 2011 final and 2010 Asian Games defeats against Lin Dan. He suffered leg cramps late into the third game. After attempting to continue, he had to retire and was subsequently stretchered to hospital.

After the World Championships Lee participated in four Super Series tournaments. First, he took the Japan Open title for the fourth time. Then he lost in the final of the Denmark Open and semifinal of the French Open, and triumphed again in the Hong Kong Open.

Lee won a record fourth Masters Finals title, the season ending Super Series tournament.

===2014===
In January, Lee lost in the final of Korea Open to Chen Long, his fourth straight defeat by the Chinese. He recorded his tenth Malaysia Open title a week later. Soon after the triumph, he announced it would be his last Malaysia Open outing, as he would assess his condition after the Asian Games and might retire if the results were not good.

However, his form improved and he won his third All England Open and India Open titles, although he was beaten by Simon Santoso in final of the Singapore Open. In the Thomas Cup, Lee won every match he played. Malaysia reached the finals, but lost to Japan with a score of 3–2.

In June, he won the Japan Open for the third consecutive year and fifth time overall. He then lost in the semifinals of the Indonesia Open, ending his hopes of nine straight Super Series finals. Due to a serious hamstring injury, Lee withdrew from the 2014 Commonwealth Games in July, also ending his hopes of being the first men&#x27;s singles shuttler to win 3 back-to-back gold medals at the games.

Lee resumed play in August where he finished second for the third time at the World Championships, losing to Chen Long of China in straight sets. He again lost to Chen in the semifinals of Asian Games team competition, and to Lin Dan in the semifinals of the singles event a few days later.

====Doping====
In October 2014, local media reported that the Badminton Association of Malaysia confirmed that one of the nation&#x27;s top shuttlers tested positive for dexamethasone after urine samples were taken during the World Championships in late August. The identity of the shuttler was not revealed but was widely believed to be Lee Chong Wei. Dexamethasone is not a performance-enhancing drug but a commonly administered anti-inflammatory corticosteroid that is not illegal when used off-season for injury rehabilitation, but deemed illegal if discovered in an athlete&#x27;s body during competition.

On 5 November 2014, Lee flew to Norway to witness the testing of his &quot;B&quot; sample at the Oslo University Hospital after the &quot;A&quot; sample had already tested positive in October. The results were announced on 8 November 2014 by a Malaysian sports official who confirmed that the &quot;B&quot; sample had tested positive as well. He declined to identify the player but confirmed to The Associated Press that it was Lee.

On 11 November 2014, the Badminton World Federation confirmed that Lee was temporarily suspended from competing due to an apparent anti-doping regulation violation. The hearing was held on 11 April 2015 in Amsterdam.

On 27 April 2015, it was announced that Lee had been handed a backdated eight-month ban for his anti-doping rule violation. The panel was convinced that Lee had no intent to cheat and allowed him to resume his career by 1 May 2015. Lee was stripped of his silver medal from the 2014 World Championships but allowed to keep his two bronze medals from the 2014 Asian Games.

===2015===
The Sudirman Cup was Lee&#x27;s first tournament after serving an eight-month suspension for a doping violation. He went on to win all three matches he played in the tournament. He then took back to back titles by winning the US Open and Canada Open. Lee again had to settle for second place at the World Championships as he lost to Chen Long in the final.

After the World Championships, Lee endured three early-round exits. First, in the second round of the Japan Open, followed by the qualifying rounds of the Korea Open, and then in the second round of Denmark Open.

After three early-round losses, Lee bounced back to win the French Open, followed by his first ever China Open title, thus making him the first-ever men&#x27;s singles shuttler to have won all Super Series titles. The following week, Lee won the Hong Kong Open. However Lee did not qualify for the Super Series Finals, ending the year with three back-to-back titles.

===2016===
In January, Lee won his fifth Malaysia Masters title. In March, Lee lost in the first round of All England Open, and also in the second round of the India Open. In April, Lee won his 11th Malaysia Open title, then followed by his second Badminton Asia Championships title. At the Thomas Cup in May, Malaysia lost to eventual winners Denmark in the semi-finals despite Lee winning all the matches he contested in the tournament. In June, Lee won his 6th and record-equaling Indonesia Open title, becoming the third shuttler and first non-Indonesian to win the title six times. He was set to play in the Australian Open, but withdrew due to a muscle injury.

On 5 August 2016, Lee led the Malaysia contingent during the opening ceremony of the Olympic Games. In the men&#x27;s singles competition he made it to the final, defeating his longtime rival Lin Dan in the semifinals in a dominating performance. However, he was defeated by Chen Long in the final, his third successive defeat in the final of the Olympic Games.

In September, Lee won his sixth Japan Open title. Since then, Lee has failed to win any tournament he participated in: he was defeated in the third round of the Denmark Open, pulled out from the French Open due to a hamstring injury, and ended the year with a group stage exit in the Super Series Finals.

===2017===
He started 2017 season with his fourth win in All England Open. He nearly missed out on the tournament after tearing the medial collateral ligament during a training session at the new Academy Badminton Malaysia (ABM), this caused his feud with technical director Morten Frost, as Frost was not receptive to his complaint, asking for the slippery mats to be replaced. Lee lost to Lin Dan for two consecutive tournaments, the first in the final of Malaysia Open, and the second in semifinals of Badminton Asia Championships.

In May, Lee won all the matches he contested during the Sudirman Cup. A month after, he lost in the second round of Indonesia Open. In August, Lee was upset by Brice Leverdez in the first round of the World Championships, soon after, he apologises to Malaysians for his defeat in his Twitter account but received some touching reply from the fans.

In September, he lost in his 100th career final, the Japan Open. He was knocked off in the early rounds of next three Super Series tournament, second round of Denmark Open, first round of French Open, and quarter-finals of the China Open. He won the Hong Kong Open title, only his second title this year.

He ended the year with lost in the final of Super Series Finals.

===2018===
Lee won his fifth Commonwealth Games gold medal in April, and settled for silver in the mixed team event.

He failed to win any World Tour titles in first half of the year. He bowed out in the first round of Malaysia Masters, a tournament which he claimed he did not intend to participate in, third round of All England Open, and semi-finals of Badminton Asia Championships.

In the team event, Lee managed to win all his matches, in both the Badminton Asia Team Championships and Thomas Cup. Malaysia reached the semi-finals and quarter-finals in the respective events.

In July 2018, Lee extended his own record at the Malaysia Open, taking a 12th title in his 14th final, and reached the semi-finals of the Indonesia Open. A week before the World Championships, the Badminton Association of Malaysia (BAM) announced that Lee would not be able to take part in the championships and also the Asian Games as he has to undergo treatment for a respiratory-related disorder. His participation in these two tournaments was in doubt even before the announcement after media reported that he was absent from the training. He was diagnosed with early stage of nasopharynx cancer and received treatment in Taiwan.

==Retirement==
On 13 June 2019, Lee announced his retirement after almost a year since he was diagnosed with nose cancer and failed to return to competition despite dropping several hints that he would make a return in early 2019. This ended his 19-year-long international badminton career. The retirement came under his doctor&#x27;s advice to avoid high-intensity training to avoid a relapse of his cancer.

Members of the media and players alike paid tribute to him after the announcement. His career-long rival, Lin Dan, wrote on Sina Weibo that he now has to &quot;head into battle alone, as he no longer has a companion anymore (独自上场没人陪我了)&quot;, and shared a song titled &quot;Don&#x27;t Cry, Friend&quot; (朋友别哭).

However, Lee announced his reconciliation with Mew Choo after winning a silver medal in the 2012 Summer Olympics.

<text>The Country Road Group is a middle market clothing retailer with operations in Australia, New Zealand and South Africa. It is a subsidiary of Woolworths South Africa. Its brands include Country Road, Mimco, Trenery, Politix, and Witchery.

==History==

Country Road was founded in 1974 by Stephen Bennett, initially as a niche women&#x27;s shirting label. It grew rapidly to become Australia&#x27;s first lifestyle brand. In 1981, Myer purchased Country Road, before listing it on the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) in 1987. In 1988, it expanded into homewares and the American market. By 1980 it was selling women&#x27;s apparel and had products in department stores as well as in ten Country Road stores. In 1984, Country Road began producing menswear, then in 1986, it began producing accessories. Its growth during the 1990s extended in both product range and location, operating over 100 stores at its peak.

In 1998, Woolworths South Africa acquired a controlling interest in the company. However, Woolworths was unable to take the Country Road private due to Solomon Lew refusing to sell the 11.67 % stake held by his family company Australian Retail Investments.

Country Road was relaunched in July 2004 as a company that has higher volume sales and lower product prices, with its head office in Burnley, Victoria, and the Australian flagship store at Chadstone Shopping Centre.

In 2003, Country Road entered into an exclusive agreement with Myer department stores. Under this agreement, Country Road agreed to sell exclusively to Myer and not to its main rival, David Jones. It also included joint marketing and in-store visual merchandising. This arrangement ended in January 2007 when Country Road became a concession store in David Jones and Myer stores. There were also stores in Boston, Chicago, New York City and other cities in the United States, as recently as 2000 or later, which closed due to weak sales.

In June 2009, Country Road launched Trenery, a new brand aimed at the 40-plus market.

In 2012, Country Road purchased Witchery Group, which include Witchery and Mimco. Having built up an 88% shareholding in the company, Woolworths took full ownership of Country Road in July 2014 when it purchased Solomon Lew&#x27;s shareholding for $200 million with the company delisted from the ASX.

The Country Road Group acquired menswear chain Politix in October 2016.

In June 2021, the Country Road Group began selling products from its brands on online marketplace The Iconic.

In February 2024, Country Road Group chief supply chain officer Rachid Maliki left the company after allegations of sexual harassment and bullying. Mehmed Mustafic, a general manager, left the company the following month after allegations of workplace bullying. Staff dissatisfaction over the company&#x27;s handling of their complaints and allegations that CEO Raju Vuppalapati had protected Maliki led to the scandal being made public in the media in May 2024.

<text>The 2004 NFL draft was the procedure by which National Football League teams selected amateur college football players. It is officially known as the NFL Annual Player Selection Meeting. The draft was held from April 24–25, 2004, at the Theater at Madison Square Garden in New York City. No teams chose to claim any players in the supplemental draft that year.

The draft was shown on ESPN both days and eventually moved to ESPN2 both days. The draft began with the San Diego Chargers selecting Mississippi quarterback Eli Manning with the first overall selection. Due to his refusal to play for the Chargers, Manning was later traded to the New York Giants for the fourth overall pick Philip Rivers of NC State. There were 32 compensatory selections distributed among 16 teams, with the Eagles, Rams, and Jets each receiving 4 compensatory picks. Seven wide receivers were selected in the first round, a draft record later tied in 2024. Another record set by the draft was the most trades in the first round, with twenty-eight trades. The University of Miami set an NFL record for the most first rounders drafted with six, which would be tied by Alabama in 2021. Ohio State set an NFL draft record having 14 total players selected through all rounds. It was the first draft to have produced two quarterbacks who each won multiple Super Bowls, with Ben Roethlisberger winning his second in 2008 and Eli Manning his second in 2011.

The 255 players chosen in the draft were composed of:

<doc id="907310" wikidata="Q5922406" url="?curid=907310" title="Inflammatory breast cancer">
<text>Inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) is one of the most aggressive types of breast cancer. It can occur in women of any age (and, extremely rarely, in men, see male breast cancer). It is referred to as &quot;inflammatory&quot; due to its frequent presentation with symptoms resembling a skin inflammation, such as erysipelas. 

Inflammatory breast cancer presents with variable signs and symptoms, frequently without detectable lumps or tumors; it therefore is often not detected by mammography or ultrasound. Typical presentation is rapid breast swelling, sometimes associated with skin changes (peau d&#x27;orange), and nipple retraction. Other signs include redness, persistent itching, and unusually warm skin. IBC often initially resembles mastitis. Approximately 50% to 75% of cases have the typical presentation; an atypical presentation makes diagnosis more difficult. In some cases, a sign such as acute central venous thrombosis may be the sole presenting indication of the disease.

IBC comprises a small proportion of breast cancer cases (1% to 6% in the USA). African-Americans are usually diagnosed with IBC at younger ages than Caucasian women, and they are also at higher risk for the disease. Recent advances in therapy have improved the prognosis considerably; at least one-third of women will survive with IBC for ten years or longer.

==Symptoms==

Signs and symptoms are quite variable, and may not be present at all in &quot;occult&quot; inflammatory breast cancer. Rapid onset of symptoms is typical; the breast often looks swollen and red, or &quot;inflamed&quot;, sometimes seemingly changing overnight. IBC is frequently misdiagnosed as mastitis. Invasion of the local lymphatic ducts, the hallmark sign of IBC, impairs lymphatic drainage and causes edematous swelling of the breast. Because the skin of the breast is tethered by the suspensory ligament of Cooper, the accumulation of fluid within the lymphatic system of the skin may cause the breast skin to assume a dimpled appearance similar to an orange peel (peau d&#x27;orange). A palpable tumor is not always found as it would be in other forms of breast cancer.

Symptoms may include:
*Sudden swelling of the breast
*Skin changes on breast
*Reddened area with a texture resembling the peel of an orange (peau d&#x27;orange)
*Nipple retraction (flattened look) or discharge
*Pain in the breast
*Itching of breast
*Swelling of lymph nodes under the arm or in the neck
*Unusual warmth of the affected breast
*Breast is harder or firmer

Other symptoms may rarely include:
*Swelling of the arm
*Breast size may seem to decrease instead of increasing
*Although a dominant mass is present in many cases, most inflammatory cancers present as diffuse infiltration of the breast without a well-defined tumor.
*A lump may be present and grow rapidly

Most patients do not experience every known symptom of IBC. Not all symptoms need to be present to make an IBC diagnosis.

==Diagnosis==
The reliable method of diagnosis by imaging, Mammography, breast MRI or ultrasound, which often show suspicious signs (general skin edema, skin thickening, mass, suspected breast lesions). It is important to biopsy the suspected lesions and/or skin. However, despite significant effort, a diagnosis could be missed. Therefore, repeat imaging and biopsies are important if a diagnosis of IBC is suspected.

Clinical presentation is typical in only 50% to 75% of cases; many other conditions, such as mastitis or even cardiac insufficiency, can mimic the typical symptoms of inflammatory breast cancer.

Temporary regression or fluctuation of symptoms, spontaneously or in response to medications or hormonal events should not be considered of any significance in diagnosis. Treatment with antibiotics or progesterone have been observed to cause a temporary regression of symptoms in certain cases.

==Characterization==

Inflammatory breast cancer is a high-grade aneuploid cancer, with mutations and overexpression of p53, high levels of E-cadherin and abnormal cadherin function. It is often regarded as a systemic cancer. A large number of IBC cases present as triple negative breast cancer (TNBC). Similar to TNBC, as opposed to hormone receptor-positive breast cancer, there is a high rate of relapse and metastasis in the first three years after presentation, with few late events (five years or later).

IBC is characterised by the presence of cancer cells in the subdermal lymphatics on skin biopsy. Consequently, IBC is always staged at stage IIIB or above, as that type of locally advanced disease is a classic prognostic indicator.

Searches for biomolecular characteristics has produced a broad range of possible biomarkers, such as loss of LIBC and WISP3 expression. Inflammatory breast cancer is similar in many ways, both prognostically and treatment-wise, to late-stage or metastatic breast cancer; it can be distinguished from those cancer types both by molecular footprint and clinical presentation. On the molecular level, some similarity exists with pancreatic cancer.

Estrogen and progesterone receptor status is frequently negative, corresponding with poor survival. IBC tumors are highly angiogenic and vascular, with high levels of VEGF and bFGF expression.

A number of proteins and signalling pathways show behaviour of biochemicals which can be considered paradoxical, compared with their function in normal tissue as well as in other breast cancer types.
* Caveolin 1 and caveolin 2 are overexpressed, and may contribute to tumour cell motility
* E-cadherin is overexpressed; paradoxically, it is associated with especially aggressive subtypes of IBC.

RhoC GTPase is overexpressed, possibly related to overexpression (hypomethylation) of caveolin 1 and caveolin 2. Caveolin is, paradoxically, tumour-promoting in IBC. NF-κB pathway activation overexpression may contribute to the inflammatory phenotype.

The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) pathway is commonly active in inflammatory breast cancer; this has the clinical implication that EGFR targeting therapy may be effective in inflammatory breast cancer.

==Epidemiology==

IBC occurs in all adult age groups. While the majority of patients are between 40 and 59 years old, age predilection is much less pronounced than in noninflammatory breast cancer. The overall rate is 1.3 cases per 100000; black women (1.6) have the highest rate, Asian and Pacific Islander women the lowest (0.7) rates.

Most known breast cancer risk predictors do not apply for inflammatory breast cancer. It may be slightly negatively associated with cumulative breast-feeding duration.

Whether inflammation contributes to the development of this disease remains an area of ongoing research.

==Role of hormones==

Age distribution and relation to breastfeeding duration is suggestive of the involvement of hormones in the causation of IBC; however, significant differences exist between IBC and other breast cancers.

Typically, IBC shows low levels of estrogen and progesterone receptor sensitivity, which corresponds with poor outcome. In IBC cases with positive estrogen receptor status, antihormonal treatment is believed to improve outcome.

Paradoxically, some findings suggest that especially-aggressive phenotypes of IBC are characterised by a high level of NF kappaB target gene expression, which can be, under laboratory conditions, successfully modulated by estrogen, but not by tamoxifen.

==Staging==

Staging is designed to help organize the different treatment plans and to understand the prognosis better. Staging for IBC has been adapted to meet the specific characteristics of the disease. IBC is typically diagnosed in one of these stages:
*Stage IIIB - at least 1/3 of the skin of the breast is affected, and cancer may have spread to tissues near the breast, such as the chest skin or chest wall, including the ribs and muscles in the chest. The cancer may have spread to lymph nodes near the breast or under the arm.
*Stage IIIC - N3 nodal involvement with an inflamed breast will upgrade the disease from Stage IIIB to Stage IIIC.
*Stage IV means that the cancer has spread to other organs. These can include the bones, lungs, liver, and/or brain.

==Treatment==
The standard treatment for newly diagnosed inflammatory breast cancer is to receive systemic therapy prior to surgery, followed by the radiation therapy. Achieving &quot;no disease [pathological complete response (pCR)]&quot; in the surgical samples gives the best prognosis. Surgery is modified radical mastectomy. Lumpectomy, segmentectomy, or skin sparing mastectomy are not recommended. Immediate reconstructive surgery is not recommended. Immediate,&quot;upfront&quot; surgery is contraindicated, as results are better using neoadjuvant chemotherapy first. Contralateral prophylactic mastectomy is not recommended because it can delay the other systemic adjuvant treatment or adjuvant radiation therapy. After surgery, all cases are recommended for radiation therapy unless it is contraindicated.

Due to the aggressive nature of the disease, it is highly recommended that people with IBC be seen by an IBC specialist and by a multidisciplinary team of health workers. Exploring whether clinical trials are available is very important. 

In patients with newly diagnosed IBC with metastatic diseases, it is essential to discuss whether palliative surgery of the breast is indicated after the systemic treatment. In the non-IBC setting, palliative surgery is not recommended; however, for IBC, palliative surgery to improve the QOL and to improve the long-term outcome is explored in certain medical conditions. 

It is critical for people with IBC to seek novel targeted therapy in a clinical trial setting. Three-modality combination therapy: surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation, was, in 2014, reported as being under-utilized in the USA. Estrogen and progesterone receptor-positive cases of IBC have not been shown to have a better prognosis than hormone receptor-negative cases. Pathological complete response to preoperative chemotherapy imparts a more favorable prognosis than a pathological complete response to surgery. Loss of diploidy (heterozygosity) and extensive breast inflammation upon first clinical examination are associated with a significantly worse IBC prognosis. A premenopausal occurrence of IBC has a significantly worse prognosis than a postmenopausal diagnosis. In postmenopausal cases, lean women have a significantly better prognosis than obese women. Among breast cancer patients with distant metastasis at diagnosis (stage IV disease), the overall survival (OS) is worse in patients with IBC than in those with non-IBC breast cancers.

<text>Chen Hong (; born November 28, 1979, in Changting County, Fujian) is a former Chinese badminton player.

==Career==
During the first several years of the 21st century Chen rated among the world&#x27;s leading singles players, achieving a number one world ranking in 2002–2003. He won the Swedish Open and the Asian Championships in 1999 as a nineteen-year-old. His subsequent titles included the Dutch (2000), Singapore (2002, 2003), Denmark (2002, 2006), Malaysia (2003), China (2005, 2006), and Thailand (2007) Opens. He twice captured the prestigious All-England Championships, 2002 and 2005, defeating his very formidable fellow countryman Lin Dan in the final on the second occasion. He played in the All England 6 consecutive times between 2001 and 2006, his first All England reached the final, losing out to Indian player Pullela Gopichand, 15–12 15–6. His performances at IBF World Championships and at the 2004 Olympic Games were not among his finest. He was a bronze medalist (semifinalist) at the 2001 and 2006 World Championships and was eliminated in the quarterfinals of the Games in Athens. At the 2006 IBF World Championships Chen recorded a 303 km/h jump smash against Taufik Hidayat. Chen retired from competitive play in 2007.

<doc id="907318" wikidata="Q4868864" url="?curid=907318" title="Batey (game)">
<text>Batéy was the name given to a special plaza around which the Caribbean Taino built their settlements. It was usually a rectangular area surrounded by stones with carved symbols (petroglyphs).

The &quot;batey&quot; was the area in which &quot;batey&quot; events (e.g. ceremonies, the ball game, etc.) took place. The &quot;batey&quot; ceremony (also known as &quot;batu&quot;) can be viewed from some historical accounts as more of a judicial contest rather than a game. Because historical accounts of the game and court space come from (mostly Spanish) European explorers, the true nature, history, and function of the &quot;batey&quot; is still contested. Neighboring tribes may have used batey matches to resolve differences without warfare.

==Distribution==

Bateys are found in Turks, Caicos, St. Croix, Dominican Republic, The Bahamas, eastern Cuba, Haiti, and &quot;the largest number of known ball courts are to be found in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands&quot;.

==Batey origins==
There is no consensus as to whether the &quot;batey&quot; ball game in the Caribbean was independently developed in different regions of the New World or whether it diffused from one or more locations. The large centrally located cemeteries in Saladoid villages served as plazas like those seen in the lowland communities of South America.

The ceremonial and religious significance of the later-developed ball game appears to indicate a connection with the Mesoamerican ball-game, and it has been argued that the &quot;batey&quot; ball-game of the Caribbean is a simplified version of the Maya &quot;pok ta pok&quot;, specified to the culture and religion of the Taino. It is possible that the route of diffusion of the game of &quot;pok ta pok&quot; and other elements of Mayan culture was not a direct one from the Yucatan to the Caribbean, but an indirect one by way of South America, because the Otomacos in South America also played a similar game.

Ethnographer Ralph Beals reported in the early 1930s that the Acaxee tribe from western Mexico played a ball game called &quot;&quot;vatey&quot; [or] &quot;batey&quot;&quot; on &quot;a small plaza, very flat, with walls at the sides&quot;.

The majority of the documented information about the ball game specific to the Caribbean islands comes from the historic accounts of Gonzalo Fernández de Oviedo y Valdés and Bartolomé de las Casas (see picture to the right). The native name for the ball court and game was &quot;batey&quot;. Oviedo&#x27;s description of the balls is reminiscent of rubber or some kind of resin with rubber-like qualities; in all sources, some kind of reference is made to the unfamiliar bounciness of the balls.

The game was played by two teams, each team consisting anywhere from ten to thirty players. Normally, the teams were composed of only men, but occasionally women played the game as well. Oviedo noted that sometimes men and women would play on mixed teams, men and women against each other, and the married women against unwed female virgins. Married women wore a shawl wrapped around their bodies while the men and virgin women went bare. Archaeologists have noted a connection between the ball courts and the stone “elbow” and “neck” collars prominent in Puerto Rico around the ball court sites. The function of these collars is not evident or explicitly detailed in historic accounts. Caribbean stone collars and the Mexican stone yokes that were worn by Mesoamerican ball game players as ceremonial belts are similar.

&quot;Faltas&quot; (errors or faults) were made when the ball came to a halt on the ground or if it had been thrown out of bounds (outside the stone boundary markers). The ball could only be struck from the shoulder, the elbow, the head, the hips, the buttock, or the knees and never with the hands. Las Casas noted that when women played the game they did not use their hips or shoulders, but their knees. Points were earned when the ball failed to be returned from a non-faulted play (similar to the earning of points in today&#x27;s volleyball). Play continued until the number of predetermined points was earned by a side. Often, players and chiefs made bets or wagers on the possible outcome of a game. These wagers were paid after a game was concluded.

==Ball court petroglyphs==
Petroglyphs have been found on river boulders, walls of caves and rock shelters, and on upright stone slabs outlining ball court plazas. Unfortunately, many of these artifacts have been stolen by collectors or looters. There are two main types of petroglyphs: 1) geometric designs and 2) images representing human or animal forms (especially the “swaddled infant”). Rouse has described the petroglyphs as “human-like bodies and heads, of faces, and of geometric designs, several of which suggest the sun and the moon”.

The most common geometric designs are concentric circles, spirals and double spirals (clockwise and counterclockwise with three to five rings), single and double hooks, two triangles set together resembling butterfly wings, horseshoe-like symbols, and series of pits loosely grouped together. There are also multi-rayed solar emblems, lizards, iguanas, birds, animistic heads with rays emanating from the neck, mask-like “faces,” and a variety of other heads or faces (human and animal ranging from simple circles with three pits or rings for the eyes and mouth to stylized loops resembling petals or feathers). These petroglyphs can be directly compared in design and style with the petroglyphs seen in Northwest Brazil and Venezuela.

The other most common image in the petroglyphs are grinning or grimacing, large eared, primarily zoomorphic “swaddled infants.” Although they appear to us as &quot;swaddled infants&quot;, they actually represent ancestors who were wrapped in hammocks upon death. The images have limbless, rounded bodies that are sack-like at the bottom. Their ears are often exaggeratedly large and are presented in varying positions and shapes.

In Puerto Rico, the “infant” type and the geometric/curvilinear type tend to occupy separate village sites. Current archaeological data is inconclusive as to whether the designs were from two different time periods (the spiral groups are mostly in the mountainous interior where the infant type is much rarer) or if the designs represent a difference in religious symbolism.

<doc id="907320" wikidata="Q7017832" url="?curid=907320" title="Newfoundland Senior Hockey League (1962–1989)">
<text>The Newfoundland Hockey League or Newfoundland Senior Hockey League (NSHL) was an island-wide league of senior hockey teams in Newfoundland that was founded in 1962. James J. Tobin was awarded the position of Honorary Secretary by the league for his contributions to hockey and sport in general, and held this position for more than 40 years. Champions are awarded the Herder Memorial Trophy.

The league was disbanded after the 1988–89 season with teams deep in debt and American Hockey League teams flooded the market.

On September 10, 2011, it was announced that a re-incarnation of the Newfoundland Senior Hockey League would start in the fall of 2011, seeing two teams from the AESHL (Conception Bay North Cee Bee Stars and Mount Pearl HJ Bartlett Electric Blades) combining with three teams from the WCSHL (Clarenville Caribous, Grand Falls-Windsor Cataracts and Corner Brook Royals).

Currently there are two regional senior A leagues, the Central West Senior Hockey League (CWSHL) and the Avalon East Senior Hockey League (AESHL).

<text>Walter Ferguson Smith (24 February 1948 – 26 October 2021) was a Scottish football player, manager and director, primarily associated with his two spells as manager of Glasgow club Rangers.

A defender, Smith&#x27;s playing career consisted of two spells with Dundee United, split by a short time at Dumbarton. A pelvic injury caused his retirement from playing and Smith moved into coaching at Dundee United, working for manager Jim McLean. Smith also took charge of the Scotland under-18 and under-21 teams, and assisted Scotland manager Alex Ferguson at the 1986 FIFA World Cup in Mexico, after it had been announced that he would be moving to Rangers as assistant to Graeme Souness.

Smith became the manager of Rangers in 1991, succeeding Souness. He won thirteen major trophies in seven years, including seven league titles in succession. After leaving Rangers at the end of the 1997–98 season, he was appointed manager of English Premier League club Everton. He was in charge at Goodison Park for four seasons before he was sacked in 2002.

After a brief stint as assistant manager to Alex Ferguson at Manchester United, Smith was appointed Scotland manager in December 2004. He presided over a revival in their fortunes, taking the national team seventy places up the FIFA World Rankings. After a UEFA Euro 2008 qualifying, he resigned as Scotland manager in January 2007 to return to Rangers. He won eight trophies during his second spell as Rangers manager and guided the team to the 2008 UEFA Cup final, before retiring from management in 2011. Smith is the second-most-successful manager in the history of Rangers, behind Bill Struth.

==Early life==
Smith was born in Lanark, but grew up in the Carmyle district in the East End of Glasgow, and was a boyhood fan of Rangers. He was employed by the South of Scotland Electricity Board, and played youth football for Drumchapel Amateurs, before launching his football career in the 1960s with Junior League team Ashfield.

==Playing career==

===Dundee United===
Smith was one of three Ashfield players signed by Dundee United manager Jerry Kerr in 1966, joining the club in November shortly after teammates Jim Cameron and Gerry Hernon. A versatile player, Smith appeared for the reserve team in a number of positions, initially as a right-half. He made his first team debut in a Scottish Football League match against Kilmarnock on 20 March 1967. He continued to play regularly for the reserves, but made only a handful of first-team appearances for Dundee United over the next four years until establishing himself in the latter part of the 1970–71 season. He also played for the Dallas Tornado in the United Soccer Association in 1967, when their roster was supplemented with Dundee United players.

Smith remained a regular first-team player for United until 1974, often in central defence. His future coaching mentor Jim McLean became manager in December 1971, and the following month his future managerial assistant Archie Knox became a teammate. In September 1973, Smith scored the only goal of the game as United defeated Dundee in the Dundee derby; he celebrated by kissing his boot, a gesture which he was later embarrassed by. He played in the 1974 Scottish Cup Final against Celtic, Dundee United&#x27;s first appearance in a major final, but finished with a runners-up medal following a 3–0 defeat.

Smith played less regularly the following season, and in September 1975 was sold to Dumbarton. He had played in 108 league games, scoring two goals, between 1966 and 1975.

===Dumbarton and return to Dundee United===
Smith was brought to Dumbarton for a fee of £8,000 by the management team of Alex Wright and former Rangers player Davie Wilson, who was one of Smith&#x27;s heroes as a teenage supporter. Wilson worked alongside Smith&#x27;s father at a local steelworks in the village of Westburn, Cambuslang, and was a senior teammate at Dundee United. During his spell with Dumbarton, the club made a rare appearance at the semi-final stage of the Scottish Cup in 1976, losing to Hearts after a replay, with Smith scoring an early own goal.

He played in 44 league games for Dumbarton before McLean paid a fee of £4,000 to bring him back to Dundee United in February 1977. Shortly afterwards, however, a serious pelvic injury effectively curtailed Smith&#x27;s playing career at the age of 29.

Thereafter, he played mainly in the reserve team, helping to develop younger players. His final first-team appearance was in September 1980, by which time he was embarking on a coaching career. He appeared in 26 league matches during his second spell and, in total, made 183 senior appearances for Dundee United, scoring three goals. Additionally, he set a club record by making approximately 360 reserve-team appearances.

==Managerial career==

===Coaching Dundee United and Scotland===
He developed his coaching skills as assistant manager to Jim McLean, at a time when Dundee United were Scottish champions and European Cup semi-finalists. While working with McLean, a notoriously hard-bitten manager, Smith developed a reputation for being a strict disciplinarian. According to Kevin Gallacher, who was an apprentice of the club at the time in the early 1980s, Smith could become ferociously angry and was known to deal out punches to enforce discipline. He joined Dundee United&#x27;s board of directors in 1986.

In 1978, he was appointed coach of the Scotland Under-18 team, and helped them to win the European Youth Championship in 1982. He became coach of the Under 21 team, and was Alex Ferguson&#x27;s assistant manager during the 1986 Mexico World Cup. Ferguson commented on Smith by saying: &quot;There are few people in the game with his experience, knowledge and technical ability.&quot;

===Rangers===
In late February 1986, Smith attended a meeting the Gleneagles Hotel at which he was informed that Graeme Souness was to be appointed player-manager of Rangers, and the latter wanted Smith as his assistant. Smith accepted the offer and within a few weeks Rangers made an official approach to Dundee United, who demanded £50,000 in compensation. The then Rangers chief executive David Holmes duly paid that amount, and Smith was allowed to join Rangers on 16 April. Smith was initially placed in temporary charge of the first team whilst Souness negotiated his own release from his playing contact with Italian side Sampdoria. He took sole charge of two Scottish Premier Division matches, on 19 and 26 April, both away, to St Mirren and Aberdeen respectively.

Smith helped Souness guide Rangers to Premier Division and League Cup glory in 1986–87, another League Cup in 1987–88, the Premier Division and League Cup again in 1988–89, a second successive league title in 1989–90 and another League Cup in 1990–91.

With Souness continuing to play regularly until 1988, Smith was the principal figure in the dugout for many matches. In addition, Smith took sole charge of the team in the 1987 Scottish League Cup Final as Souness was suspended. Souness was subject to an extensive touchline ban from February 1989, although he frequently circumvented this by naming himself as a substitute.

When Souness left for Liverpool in April 1991, Smith was appointed interim manager. This was made permanent in May 1991, after the club clinched its fourth title in five seasons. Six more league titles in succession followed under Smith&#x27;s tenure, including a domestic treble in 1992–93. He also won the Scottish Cup and the League Cup three times each. Smith took Rangers to the brink of the final of the Champions League in season 1992–93, going ten games without defeat in that campaign and 44 matches unbeaten in all competitions.

This success was achieved at a cost, as Smith spent over £50m on transfer fees in his six years in charge – more than any other club in Great Britain over the same period – although in terms of net spend, particularly due to the sales of Trevor Steven in 1991 for £5.5 million and Duncan Ferguson in 1994 for £4.3 million, it was comparable for much of that time to the type of support offered across the city to Tommy Burns at Celtic.

Rangers equalled Celtic&#x27;s record of nine successive championships in 1996–97. In an effort to secure a record-breaking tenth success in 1997–98, Rangers spent £13m on eight new players. In European competition, Rangers were beaten 4–1 by IFK Gothenburg in the 1997–98 UEFA Champions League preliminary round and 4–2 by Strasbourg in the first round of the 1997–98 UEFA Cup. There was growing pressure on Smith because of poor European results, and it was announced in October 1997 that he would leave Rangers at the end of the season. Rangers lost the league title to Celtic on the final day and then lost the 1998 Scottish Cup final to Hearts.

===Everton===
After success in his native Scotland, Smith&#x27;s retirement lasted a month as he took the manager&#x27;s job at Premier League club Everton in June 1998. Initially Smith had been linked with the manager&#x27;s job at Sheffield Wednesday, but false promises made to him by the Everton chairman of massive transfer funds and unlimited ambition lured Smith to Goodison Park. Smith spent money on players only to discover that it was money the club did not have. When Duncan Ferguson was sold behind Smith&#x27;s back, he was tempted to quit. The remainder of his time at Everton revolved around selling the club&#x27;s better players such as John Collins, Olivier Dacourt, Don Hutchison, Marco Materazzi, Nick Barmby, Francis Jeffers and Michael Ball to balance the books.

Under Smith, Everton finished in the bottom half of the table for three consecutive seasons. The Everton board finally ran out of patience with Smith and he was sacked in March 2002 after an &quot;abject&quot; 3–0 FA Cup sixth-round defeat to Middlesbrough, with Everton in some danger of relegation from the Premier League. He was replaced by David Moyes, who managed Everton to a safe finish in fifteenth place.

===Manchester United===
In March 2004, Smith returned to football when he had a short spell as assistant manager to Alex Ferguson at Manchester United at the end of the 2003–04 season. During this time Manchester United won the 2004 FA Cup Final, beating Millwall at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff.

===Scotland national team===
Smith was appointed manager of the Scottish national team on 2 December 2004, succeeding Berti Vogts. Despite a revival of fortunes under Smith, including a home draw with Italy and an away win against Norway, hopes of reaching the 2006 World Cup were ended by a 1–0 home defeat against Belarus.

Scotland&#x27;s world ranking improved by seventy places during his tenure. Scotland recorded a famous victory against World Cup runners-up France in a UEFA Euro 2008 qualification match at Hampden and temporarily led their group by three points. A 2–0 defeat against Ukraine on 11 October 2006 was the first of the campaign.

===Return to Rangers===
On 5 January 2007, press outlets reported that Rangers had spoken to Smith with a view to hiring him to manage Rangers again, with Ally McCoist as assistant manager. The Scottish FA initially rebuffed Rangers&#x27; approach for Smith, but his return as Rangers manager was announced on 10 January 2007. He succeeded Paul Le Guen, who had left the club by mutual consent after Rangers had been knocked out of the 2006–07 Scottish League Cup by First Division side St Johnstone and fallen 17 points behind Celtic in the 2006–07 Scottish Premier League; caretaker manager Ian Durrant (who had previously played under him) was retained on the coaching staff.

Smith&#x27;s first match in his second spell at Ibrox was a 5–0 win against Dundee United on 13 January, with two goals from Kris Boyd and one each from Barry Ferguson, Chris Burke and Charlie Adam. Smith&#x27;s first final since his return was secured with a 2–0 win over Hearts in the 2007–08 Scottish League Cup. Rangers played Dundee United in the 2008 Scottish League Cup Final; the game was drawn 1–1 after normal time, and 2–2 after extra time. The winners were decided by penalty kicks. Rangers won 3–2, with Kris Boyd scoring the winning penalty (as well as the goals for Rangers in normal time and extra time).

In the 2007–08 UEFA Cup, Smith booked Rangers&#x27; first European final for 36 years, after an exit in the UEFA Champions League group stage on the final day after good results against VFB Stuttgart, Olympique Lyonnais and FC Barcelona. In the quarter-final, after a 0–0 home draw with Sporting, Rangers went on to win the away leg 2–0. In the semi-final they drew 0–0 in both legs against Fiorentina and after extra time, they won 4–2 on penalties, taking Rangers to the UEFA Cup Final in Manchester, which they lost 0–2 to Zenit St. Petersburg. Rangers also narrowly missed out on the league title, partly attributable to an end-of-season fixture backlog due to their cup runs. They added the 2007–08 Scottish Cup with a win over Queen of the South in what was their 68th match of the campaign; afterwards, Smith revealed that assistant McCoist had been controlling the team in the Scottish Cup run.

In the 2008–09 UEFA Champions League second qualifying round, Rangers drew 0–0 with Lithuanian side FBK Kaunas at Ibrox on 30 July 2008 and lost the return leg 2–1. The loss against Kaunas meant Rangers made an early exit from European competition. Rangers went on to claim the SPL title – the club&#x27;s 52nd championship – on 24 May 2009. Smith followed this up with the Scottish Cup a week later to end the season with a League and Cup double.

In December 2009, it was revealed that Smith was to continue as Rangers manager without a contract when it expired the following month. In March 2010, he guided Rangers to win the League Cup after they had been reduced to nine men in the final. On 25 April 2010, Rangers clinched their 53rd league title with a 1–0 win away to Hibernian.

On 25 May 2010, Smith signed a new one-year deal to continue as Rangers manager throughout the 2010–11 campaign. He stated that it would be his last as Rangers manager, with McCoist to take control thereafter. In this final season as manager, Smith led Rangers to another domestic double, winning the League Cup and their 54th league championship. The league title was secured on the final day of the season, with a 5–1 win against Kilmarnock at Rugby Park.

==After management==
Rangers entered administration in February 2012. An attempt to take the club out of administration by means of a creditors voluntary arrangement was rejected by HM Revenue &amp; Customs, the largest creditor, putting the club into liquidation in June 2012. The administrator, Duff &amp; Phelps, sold the assets of Rangers to a consortium led by Charles Green. Smith said that he was leading a consortium offering a deal to buy the assets from Green, but this offer was withdrawn days later. On 11 November 2012, Smith returned to Ibrox taking on a role with the new Rangers company as a non-executive director. Smith was appointed non-executive chairman in May 2013, but he resigned from the board in August.

Smith was linked with a return to management as Scotland manager in February 2018, but he withdrew his name from consideration after discussions with the Scottish FA.

==Personal life==
Smith was married to Ethel, with whom he had two sons, Neil and Steven.

Smith was a close friend of former Celtic player and manager Tommy Burns. He was a pallbearer at Burns&#x27;s funeral in 2008.

Politically, Smith described himself as a socialist and said he was brought up with &quot;socialist principles&quot;.

During the 2014 Scottish independence referendum Smith was a supporter of the Better Together campaign against Scottish independence.

He underwent an unspecified medical operation in March 2021 that required him to stay in hospital.

== Death ==

Smith died from cancer on the morning of 26 October 2021, aged 73. A private family funeral was held on 3 November, followed by a public memorial service at Glasgow Cathedral on 19 November.

=== Legacy ===
On 25 May 2024, a statue of Smith was unveiled in front of Ibrox&#x27;s Copland Road Stand.

<text>Kenneth Jonassen (born 3 July 1974) is a Danish badminton coach and former player, who won Danish national and international titles during the first decade of the 21st century. The big, hard fighting Dane was often ranked among the top few singles players of that era, but was rather overshadowed by his fellow countryman Peter Gade. He has served the singles head coach of the Malaysia national badminton team since 4 January 2025.

He played badminton at the 2004 Summer Olympics in men&#x27;s singles, losing in the round of 32 to Chen Hong of China. Jonassen reached the quarterfinals of several Badminton World Championships but never quite made it to the medal rounds.

He won the gold medal at the 2008 European Badminton Championships, late in his career. This, along with victories in the 2003 Korea Open and the 2004 Singapore Open were perhaps his most impressive achievements.

==History==

The earliest records of human settlement date back to the early 1800s when Dharug Aborigines inhabited the region. Governor Arthur Phillip is said to be the first European to have visited the Hills in 1788. The Hills Shire started developing gradually with its new road systems and farming as more Europeans settled here. The first school started in 1840 followed by a general store and a post office. In 1902, the tram from Parramatta to Baulkham Hills was inaugurated and telephone links were established by 1907. The population rose steadily over the years along with infrastructure development of the Hills Shire.

A 2015 review of local government boundaries by the NSW Government Independent Pricing and Regulatory Tribunal (IPART) recommended that The Hills Shire merge with adjoining councils. The government considered two proposals. The first proposed a merger of parts of The Hills with the Hawkesbury City Council to form a new council with an area of and support a population of approximately 224,000. The second proposed a merger of parts of Parramatta, Auburn, The Hills, Hornsby, and Holroyd to form a new council with an area of and support a population of approximately 215,725. Following an independent review, on 12 May 2016 the Minister for Local Government announced that the merger of parts of The Hills Shire suburbs south of the M2 Motorway (North Rocks, Northmead and part of Baulkham Hills) with the City of Parramatta to form a revised City of Parramatta Council, with immediate effect. Other proposals impacting The Hills Shire were rejected by the Government.

In June 2020, Councillor Brooke Collins made national news for controversially objecting to the Welcome to Country, reportedly stating &quot;How do you know they didn’t wipe out another race when they arrived here 70,000 years ago?&quot;.

== Heritage listings ==
The Hills Shire has a number of heritage-listed sites, including:
* Baulkham Hills, Seven Hills Road: Pearce Family Cemetery
* Bella Vista, Elizabeth Macarthur Drive: &quot;Bella Vista&quot; (homestead)
* Box Hill, 10 Terry Road: Box Hill House
* Box Hill, Windsor Road: Box Hill Inn
* Castle Hill, Gilbert Road: Third Government Farm
* Castle Hill, 221 Old Northern Road: St Paul&#x27;s Anglican Church, Castle Hill (former)
* Cattai, Wisemans Ferry Road: Cattai Estate
* Maroota South, Wisemans Ferry Road: Great Drain
* Rouse Hill, The Water Lane: Hunting Lodge, Rouse Hill
* Rouse Hill, Windsor Road: Royal Oak Inn, Rouse Hill

==Recent controversies==
In 2020, the Hills Shire Council, whose local government area covers Darug land, caused controversy by rejecting requests to include an Acknowledgment of Country at its meetings. The Hills Shire Council is the only Sydney local council that does not include an Acknowledgment of Country at its meetings. This was later overturned with support from a new Mayor.

In 2022, allegations were made of branch stacking in the Council in collusion with property developers, namely &quot;...serious allegations of collusion between members of the Liberal party and a developer to replace elected members of The Hills Shire Council with new councillors who would be more amenable to that developer&#x27;s interests&quot;. The New South Wales Parliament Legislative Council Portfolio Committee found illegal meetings had taken place between councillors and a developer, but recommended the matter be escalated in 2023, given the deliberate non-cooperation of key witnesses and councillors in giving evidence.

<text>Northmead is a suburb of Greater Western Sydney, in the state of New South Wales, Australia. Northmead is located 26 kilometres west of the Sydney central business district, in the local government area of the City of Parramatta.

Northmead is a hilly suburb with low to medium density houses, townhouses and apartment buildings, and a large light industrial area. It is located to the northeast of the junction of Darling Mills Creek and Toongabbie Creek, which combine to form the beginnings of the Parramatta River.

==History==
Traditional owners of the land are believed to be the Dharug peoples.

With the British colonization of Parramatta, this area was originally part of the domain of Government House. What is left of this domain, including Government House, forms Parramatta Park.

The name Northmead is derived from the location of the north &quot;mead&quot;, or meadow, of the governor&#x27;s domain. It was an area of orchards and poultary farms prior to being subdivided. The suburb is bordered by the waterways of the Darling Mills and Toongabbie Creeks.

The land was subdivided between 1859 and 1889 and the Northern Meadow and Western Meadow of the domain were split off and called Northmead and Westmead. From this time, orchards were established by many new settlers, including some whose names were well known in the Parramatta area - George Oakes, Nat Payten and William Fullagar among them.

== Heritage listings ==
Northmead has a number of heritage-listed sites, including:
* 64 Windsor Road: 1850 sandstone house, originally used as the manager&#x27;s residence of a grain mill.

==Schools==
* Northmead Public School - Moxhams Road.

==Transport==
The North West T-Way connecting the Hills with Parramatta runs through Northmead.
Northmead&#x27;s public transport needs are only catered by buses, namely those of the CDC NSW, Northmead being one of the suburbs to have a CDC NSW depot. This results in highly operational bus services in the Hills District - an area that is one of the fastest growing in Australia.

The major roads are Windsor Road and the Cumberland Highway.

==Transport history==

Northmead once featured a train line known as the Rogans Hill railway line. Long underperforming due to an increasing preference for faster and more modern motor buses, it was decided in 1929 under conservative (United Australia Party) Premier Bertram Stevens that the line should be decommissioned, which eventually took place on 31 January 1932.

Currently, there is no train line that services Northmead with the closest being the Main Western Railway Line that runs through Westmead and Parramatta.

==Population==
According to the conducted by the Australian Bureau of Statistics, Northmead had a population of 11,261. This was a significant increase from the 2006 census, which showed a population of 6,969. This increase went hand in hand with an increase in apartments in the suburb from 9.9% to 31.5% over the period.

61.5% of people were born in Australia. The most common countries of birth were India 5.2%, China 3.1%, Iran 2.2%, South Korea 1.8% and Philippines 1.8%. 62.8% of people only spoke English at home. Other languages spoken at home included Mandarin 3.6%, Arabic 3.0%, Korean 2.5%, Persian (excluding Dari) 2.4% and Cantonese 2.3%. The religious affiliation responses were Catholic (26.9%), No Religion 25.8% and Anglican (10.4%).

<text>Thomas Smith (1745 – March 31, 1809) was a politician and jurist from Pennsylvania.

==Formative years==
Born near Cruden, Aberdeenshire, Scotland in 1745, Smith attended the University of Edinburgh, and then immigrated to the United States, where he settled in Bedford, Pennsylvania on February 9, 1769. He became a deputy surveyor that same year. Smith then studied law, was admitted to the bar, and began practicing as a lawyer in 1772.

==Career==
In 1773, Smith became a deputy register of wills and prothonotary, and a justice of the peace in 1774.

When the Revolutionary War broke out, Smith served as a deputy colonel of a militia unit.

In 1776, he was appointed as a delegate to Pennsylvania&#x27;s constitutional convention and was then elected to the Pennsylvania House of Representatives, serving in that capacity from 1776 until 1780. Smith was then chosen to be a delegate to the Continental Congress from 1781 to 1782.

Appointed as a judge of the Pennsylvania court of common pleas in 1791, Smith was subsequently appointed to the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, a post he held from 1794 until 1809.

==Death and interment==
Smith died in Philadelphia on March 31, 1809 and was buried in Christ Church Burial Ground.

==Controversy==
While serving as a justice on the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, Smith was impeached on March 23, 1804 by the Democratic–Republican-led Pennsylvania House of Representatives, along with two other Federalist justices of the Supreme Court, Edward Shippen IV and Jasper Yeates. The sole Democratic–Republican member of the court, who had been not in attendance on the day the court heard the case central to the impeachment, was not impeached. The justices were not removed, being acquitted in their impeachment trial before the Pennsylvania Senate in the vote held on January 28, 1805.

<doc id="907335" wikidata="Q1352276" url="?curid=907335" title="Robin Hahnel">
<text>Robin Eric Hahnel (born March 25, 1946) is an American economist and professor emeritus of economics at American University. He was a professor at American University for many years and traveled extensively advising on economic matters all over the world. He is best known for his work on participatory economics with &quot;Z Magazine&quot; editor Michael Albert.

Politically, Hahnel considers himself a product of the New Left and is sympathetic to libertarian socialism. He has been active in many social movements and organizations for forty years, notably as a participant in student movements opposed to the American invasion of South Vietnam, more recently with the Southern Maryland Greens, a local chapter of the Maryland Green Party, and the Green Party of the United States. Hahnel&#x27;s work in economic theory and analysis is informed by the work of Marx, Keynes, Piero Sraffa, Michał Kalecki, and Joan Robinson, among others. He has served as a visiting professor or economist in Cuba, Peru, and England.

==Early critiques: Orthodox Marxism and welfare economics==
Hahnel was an undergraduate at Harvard when he met Albert, who was studying at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Over the course of roughly three decades the duo would produce seven books together. Among the early writings was &quot;Marxism and Socialist Theory&quot; an evaluation of Marxist and Marxist–Leninist theory that emphasized what they believed were serious flaws. Albert and Hahnel argued that while those aspects of Marxist theory rejecting the institutions of private property and markets were well-founded, other aspects of Marxist and Marxist–Leninist doctrine, including its economistic bias, dialectical methodology, historical materialism, class concepts, labour theory of value, crises theory and rejection of visionary thinking, and authoritarian values and tendencies, were either partially or wholly flawed; and often constituted obstacles in the struggle for social justice. Subsequently, they produced &quot;Socialism, Today and Tomorrow&quot;, which was an analysis of socialism in the Soviet Union, China and Cuba, as well as a sketch of an alternative theoretical framework for socialism.

Their technical study of mainstream welfare economics, &quot;A Quiet Revolution in Welfare Economics&quot;, was originally published by Princeton, but did not receive wide distribution. The underground interest in the book prompted its being made available online. They argued that traditional welfare economic theory was in an intractable crisis. The core approach that competitive markets produce social efficiency was yielding diminishing returns and &quot;has thwarted, rather than facilitated, advances in analyses of the labour process, externalities, public goods, preference development and institutional structures.&quot; The traditional socialist solution of public enterprise combined with centrally planned allocation was found equally lacking. In conclusion they argued that in clarifying the reasons why traditional models were deficient they had cleared a path that suggested probable directions for an alternative paradigm. The significant social and ecological inefficiencies of private enterprise market economies, public enterprise centrally planned economies, and related variants, necessitated both the re-organization of production and consumption institutions and the search for compatible &quot;allocative mechanisms that allow informed individual rationality to be fully consistent with social rationality.&quot; Their next step, the formulation of a relatively detailed &quot;full&quot; vision of an economy based upon participatory democratic planning was their attempt to provide an answer to this challenge.

==Participatory economics==
In 1991, as the Soviet bloc crumbled and capitalism emerged triumphant Albert and Hahnel published &quot;The Political Economy of Participatory Economics&quot;, a model of an economy based upon allocation by participatory democracy within an integrated framework of nested production and consumption councils that was proposed as an alternative to contemporary capitalism, centralized state socialism and market socialism. In ensuing years Hahnel and Albert fleshed out the gaps in their vision, discussed possible complementary political and cultural institutions, and replied to many of their critics.

==Ecological economics==
Throughout much of this time Hahnel had been teaching advanced courses in ecological economics at American University. His ecological economic vision seeks to incorporate the ecological and social costs entailed in production, consumption, and distribution in the price signals for each good. Because of the widely recognized difficulties of quantifying ecological and social costs, Hahnel emphasized the necessity of utilizing qualitative data in addition to quantitative data to ensure accurate price signals. Qualitative data can best be elucidated through the mechanisms of an inclusive and participatory democratic informational framework.

In terms of the current day ecological problems Hahnel acknowledges that green and pollution taxes are likely to be more effective than alternative schemes such as the marketization of natural resources using permit systems or regulatory &quot;command and control&quot; methods. An optimally efficient green tax requires taxing polluters an amount equal to external costs. Corporations can be expected to try to pass the extra costs on to consumers by raising prices; however, Hahnel notes that &quot;part of the reason pollution taxes improve efficiency in a market economy is that they discourage consumption of goods whose production requires pollution precisely by making those products more expensive for consumers.&quot; He recommends linking tax increases related to &quot;bads&quot; such as pollution to tax decreases on &quot;goods&quot; related to productive work, as exemplified by social security taxes. (The ABC&#x27;s of Political Economy, 272)

From an international strategic perspective however, he has thrown his support behind a cap and trade system. He argues that progress has been made toward a cap and trade system and should not be discarded, that such a system would foreground scientific and climatological expertise rather than economic expertise, and that such a system is much more achievable on an international level.

==Corporate-sponsored globalization, criticism and activism==
As the nineties wore on, Hahnel became increasingly immersed in analysis of corporate-sponsored globalization, and actively participated in movements opposed to it. As disparate oppositional groups planned and unified for what were to be momentous demonstrations against the World Trade Organization meetings in Seattle in 1999, Hahnel was among the leading economic analysts educating popular movements.

His first major book authored without Michael Albert was &quot;Panic Rules&quot;. The book features concise analysis of crises due to financial liberalization in the era of globalization, a critique of the ideology and practices of global institutions such as the WTO, IMF, and World Bank, and a tightly argued explanation of the conditional insights and much overlooked limitations of international trade theory based upon Ricardo&#x27;s theory of comparative advantage.

Hahnel acknowledged core insights within comparative advantage theory, noting that &quot;if opportunity costs of producing goods are different in different countries there are potential gains from specialization and trade.&quot; However, he explained that the potential gains are realized only under specific conditions, and expounded on the many real world factors that can account for significant efficiency losses. Among the most significant factors for efficiency losses from trade are &quot;inaccurate prices&quot; due to significant externalities that cause misidentification of comparative advantages, unstable international markets that create macro inefficiencies, and adjustment costs of moving people in and out of industries that can be considerable. Moreover, in spite of Ricardo&#x27;s theory, international trade usually aggravates global inequality because terms of trade are set inequitably as a result of the dominant bargaining positions of northern countries, and thanks to class structures that ensure the costs and benefits of trade are distributed unfairly within countries. (see ABC&#x27;s of Political Economy, 176–207)

==Theory and practice of economic justice and democracy==
In recent years Hahnel has stopped publishing books with Michael Albert on participatory economics. He has done much work in academic oriented political economic theory. Notably, he wrote an essay analysing the works of Amartya Sen that was published in the anthology &quot;Understanding Capitalism: Critical Analysis from Karl Marx to Amartya Sen&quot;. There is a noticeable turn in his recent work towards consideration of mid-term strategies such as global Keynesianism and living wage reforms while maintaining his long-term sights on a libertarian socialist economy based on equitable cooperation. He has also written extensively on environmental economic issues, such as carbon trade and the formal Coase theorem. Links between his work on participatory economics and his research of economic justice and democracy, as well as environmental issues, are prevalent in the books &quot;Economic Justice and Democracy: From Competition to Cooperation&quot; (2005) and &quot;Of the people, By the people – The Case for a Participatory Economy&quot; (2012)&quot;.&quot;

<doc id="907340" wikidata="Q234758" url="?curid=907340" title="Federica Pellegrini">
<text>Federica Pellegrini (; born 5 August 1988) is an Italian retired swimmer. A native of Mirano, in the province of Venice, she won a gold medal at the 2008 Beijing Olympics. At the 2009 World Championships in Rome (long course swimming pool, 50 m), Pellegrini became the first woman ever to break the 4-minute barrier in the 400 m freestyle with a time of 3:59.15. She also held the women&#x27;s 200 meters freestyle world record (long course, 50 m).

Pellegrini is the only swimmer − male or female − to have won eight medals in a row in the same event (200 meters freestyle) at the World Championships. She is also the first female Olympic swimming champion from Italy and the only Italian swimmer to have set world records in more than one event. At the 2020 Summer Olympics, she became the first female swimmer to qualify for five consecutive Olympic finals in the same specialty (200 m freestyle). She is a member of the International Olympic Committee (IOC). Pellegrini retired from active competition in 2021. She was nicknamed &quot;La Divina&quot; (&quot;The Divine&quot;) by Italian sport journalists.

==Biography==
===Career===
====2004 Olympics====
Pellegrini&#x27;s first international podium was at the 2004 Olympic Games in Athens, where she won the silver medal in the 200 m freestyle at the age of 16, becoming the youngest Italian athlete ever to win an Olympic medal in an individual event.

====2005–2007====
Pellegrini competed at the 2005 Montreal, where she got a silver in the 200 m freestyle, just behind Solenne Figuès, after being the favourite in the event, because of setting previously the best time of the season in the distance. Two years after, she took part of the 400 m freestyle, her first attempt in the event, where she finished fifth. Then she competed also at the 200 m freestyle, where, in the semi-finals, she set her first world record of her career, with a time of 1:56:47, beating the previous one belonging to Franziska van Almsick. But it was beaten the day after in the final by her rival Laure Manaudou, who got the gold medal and immediately broke her world record, while she got just the bronze, behind Annika Lurz too.

====2008 ====
Pellegrini&#x27;s first long course (50 meters) gold medal came at the 2008 European Championships in Eindhoven, where she won the 400 m freestyle setting a world record (4:01.53). She was disqualified in the heats of 200 m freestyle for a wrong start.

At the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing, she arrived as the world-record holder and favourite for the gold medal in the 400 m freestyle, having set the Olympic record in the heats (4:02.19), but only finished 5th in the final. On the same day, she recovered from that disappointment by setting a world record (1:55.45) in the heats of the 200 m freestyle; in the final, she broke her own world record (1:54.82) and won her first Olympic gold medal.

Pellegrini also proved her strength in short course events at the 2008 European Short Course Championships in Rijeka, when she won the gold medal in the 200 m freestyle at a world-record pace (1:51.85). At the 2009 Mediterranean Games in Pescara, Pellegrini broke the world record in the 400 m freestyle with a time of 4:00.41 to better Joanne Jackson&#x27;s record of 4:00.66.

====2009 World Championships====

At the 2009 World Championships in Rome, Pellegrini broke the world record again in the 400 m freestyle with a time of 3:59.15, winning the gold medal and in doing so becoming the first female swimmer to break the 4-minute barrier in the event; she won the gold medal also in the 200 m freestyle and she broke her own world record with a time of 1:52.98. At 2009 European Short Course Championships in Istanbul she broke the world record in the 200 m freestyle with a time of 1:51.17. At the 2010 European Championships in Budapest Pellegrini won the bronze medal in the 800 m freestyle, behind Lotte Friis and Ophélie-Cyrielle Étienne, and the gold medal in the 200 m freestyle with a time of 1:55.45; in the same year, she announced that she would be working with Laure Manadou&#x27;s former coach, Philippe Lucas.

====2011 World Championships====
At the 2011 World Championships in Shanghai, Pellegrini won the gold medal in the 400 m freestyle with a time of 4:01.97, becoming the second female swimmer after Laure Manaudou to win the gold medal in this event at two consecutive World Aquatics Championships. Two days later, she won the gold medal in the 200 m freestyle too with a time of 1:55:58, becoming the first female swimmer ever to win this title at two consecutive editions of the World Aquatics Championships; after the success in Shanghai, she parted ways with her French coach and began working with Federico Bonifacenti.

====2012====
In May 2012, she was surprisingly excluded from the final of the 400 m freestyle at the 2012 European Aquatics Championships, after winning two gold medals in other events (200-metre freestyle and 4 × 200 m freestyle relay) and a bronze medal in 4 × 100 freestyle relay.

At the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, Pellegrini finished fifth in the 400 metres freestyle with a time of 4:04.50 and the 200 metres freestyle with a time of 1:56.73.

====2013 World Championships====
After the Olympics, Pellegrini declared she wouldn&#x27;t take part to 200 and 400 metres freestyle at 2013 World Aquatics Championships to take a gap year. She chose to prepare herself for 200 metres backstroke competition to compete for Italy at World Championships. Anyway, with a last-minute decision, Pellegrini took part to 200 metres freestyle event at the 2013 World Championships and eventually won a silver medal with a time of 1:55.14, her best since Rome. Pellegrini won the silver medal behind Missy Franklin.

====2014====
At the 2014 European Aquatics Championships she repeated herself, winning the two gold medals of the previous championship, in the 200-metre freestyle (preceding Hosszú and Heemskerk) and in the 4 × 200 m freestyle relay, this one with an exceptional vamp over the Swedish team. She took part of 400-metre freestyle too, finishing fourth in the final, and this was her last international competition in that event.

====2015 World Championships====

At the World Aquatics Championships held in Kazan (Russia) in 2015, she won the silver medal in 200 metres freestyle behind Katie Ledecky and ahead of Missy Franklin with a time of 1:55.32, and the silver medal in the 4 × 200 meter freestyle relay behind the United States. By winning the silver medal in the individual 200 metres freestyle, she became the first female swimmer in history to get a medal in the same event at six consecutive World Championships.

====2016====

In May 2016, she competed in European Championships in London and won the 200m freestyle with a time of 1:55.93, beating Femke Heemskerk from Holland.
At the Settecolli, in June, she set the Italian record in the 100 freestyle (53:18), and she made a very interesting time in the 200 freestyle (1:54:55), her personal best with the textile suit.

At the 2016 Summer Olympics, Pellegrini was flagbearer for Italy, and competed in the following disciplines: 200m freestyle, and in the 4 × 100 and 4 × 200 m freestyle relays.

Pellegrini missed the podium during the competition, ranking fourth during the 200 m final. Eventually, she stated that failing to win an Olympic medal in the women&#x27;s 200 metres freestyle final in Rio de Janeiro was so devastating for her that she may consider &quot;making changes to her life&quot;.

Nevertheless, she got a prime redemption at the World Short Course Championships in Windsor (Ontario), because she won her first gold medal in the 200 freestyle, beating Katinka Hosszú.

====2017====
Pellegrini competed in a Milan meet on 12 March 2017 and finished first in 100 m freestyle with 54.77 and second in 100 m backstroke with 1:01.59. She competed in Indiana 2017 Arena Pro Swim Series in 2–4 March 2017 and won gold in 200 m freestyle with a time of 1:56.07.
At the World Aquatics Championships held in Budapest, she won the gold medal in 200 metres freestyle ahead of both Katie Ledecky and Emma McKeon with a time of 1:54.73. This was Ledecky&#x27;s first loss at a major event. By winning the gold medal in the individual 200 metres freestyle, she became the first swimmer ever to get a medal in the same event at seven consecutive World Championships.
She competed in the 100 metres freestyle too.

====2018, the sabbatical year====
After winning her seventh consecutive medal at the World championships of Budapest 2017 Pellegrini decides to allow herself a sabbatical with milder training and partial abandonment of her beloved 200m freestyle. And this is how at the European Championships in Copenhagen in December 2017 as individual competitions she participates in the 100 m freestyle which she finishes in seventh position in the final, and in the 100 m backstroke where she does not qualify for the final swimming only the tenth time of the semifinals. The only satisfaction of this review is the bronze medal in the 4 × 50 mixed freestyle relay.

We continue on this path also at the European Long Course Championships in Glasgow of the following season where there is only a fifth place in the final of the 100 m freestyle and several placings at the foot of the podium in the relays, but also in this case Pellegrini seemed do not show up for the appointment in optimal conditions.

====2019====
Pellegrini won the gold medal (her fourth overall) in the 200 m freestyle race at the 2019 World Aquatics Championships held at Gwangju, with a time of 1:54.22, before Ariarne Titmus and Sarah Sjöström, taking advantage of Katie Ledecky, Emma McKeon and Taylor Ruck&#x27;s withdrawals in the event, and so improving her record of being the one, among female and male swimmers, to achieve eight podiums in the same event during eight consecutive editions of the World Championships earning the title of 9th-most decorated swimmer history with individuals medals alone.
She didn&#x27;t go beyond the heats in the 50 metres freestyle and in the 100 metres freestyle. She took part in the finals of the 4×100-metre mixed freestyle relay and the medley relay.

====2021====
In May, Pellegrini competed at the European Championships in Budapest, where she won double silver medal respectively in the 200m freestyle and in the mixed freestyle, and a triple bronze medal in the freestyle, in the mixed freestyle and in the medley.

At the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo, she qualified for the final of the 200 metre freestyle. This made her the second swimmer in history (after Michael Phelps) to qualify for the final of the same event five times.

Pellegrini announced that she would retire at the conclusion of her third ISL season. Her final race as a professional was in her home country in Riccione on 30 Nov 2021.

== Celebrity ==
In August 2015 a section of the Lungomare delle Stelle of Jesolo was named after Federica Pellegrini and, as per tradition, the cast of the athlete&#x27;s hands was made, preserved in the museum Kursaal of the city.

== Television ==
From 2019 to 2022 she was a judge on the talent show &quot; Italia&#x27;s Got Talent &quot;, broadcast on TV8 and Sky Uno. Since October 2021 she has hosted some episodes of &quot;Le Iene&quot; with Nicola Savino.
In October 2022 she was one of the contestants in the tenth edition of &quot;Peking Express&quot;, paired with her husband Matteo Giunta.

<text>A gunny sack, also known as a gunny shoe, burlap sack, hessian sack or tow sack, is a large sack, traditionally made of burlap (Hessian fabric) formed from jute, hemp, sisal, or other natural fibres, usually in the crude spun form of tow. Modern-day versions of these sacks are often made from synthetic fabrics such as polypropylene.

The word &quot;gunny&quot;, meaning coarse fabric, is of Indo-Aryan origin. Reusable gunny sacks, typically holding about , were traditionally used, and continue to be to some extent, for transporting grain, potatoes and other agricultural products. In Australia, these sacks, made of Indian jute, were known traditionally as &quot;hessian sacks&quot;, &quot;hessian bags&quot; or &quot;sugar bags.&quot;

Gunny sacks are sometimes used as sandbags for erosion control, especially in emergencies. Up until the latter part of the twentieth century, when they became less common, the sacks were one of the primary tools for fighting grass fires in rural areas, used while soaked with water when available. Gunny sacks are also popular in the traditional children&#x27;s game of sack racing.

==Size==
A gunny sack holds approximately of potatoes, and measures by . Although gunny sacks are no longer used to carry them, the common measurement unit of potatoes is still the &quot;sack&quot; among farmers in Idaho.

<text>Stickle Bricks are a construction toy primarily intended for toddlers invented by Denys Fisher in 1969. The brand is owned by Hasbro, and as of 2016 is sub-licensed to Flair Leisure Products plc.

==Description==
An individual stickle brick is a colourful plastic shape a few centimeters long which has a &quot;brush&quot; of small plastic &quot;fingers&quot; on one or more surfaces. The fingers of adjacent stickle bricks can interlock, allowing them to be joined in various ways. Standard sets of stickle bricks contain triangular, square and rectangular pieces. Many recent sets also include other types of pieces such as heads, wheels and teddy bear shapes.

==History==
Stickle Bricks were invented in 1969 by Denys Fisher.

From 2001 to 2008, GP Flair was the British distributor of the bricks. In October 2015, Flair licensed the bricks along with Mr. Frosty from Hasbro starting in 2016.

<doc id="907348" wikidata="Q7965149" url="?curid=907348" title="Walter Hinton">
<text>Walter T. Hinton (10 November 1888 – 28 October 1981) was a United States aviator.

Hinton was born in Pleasant Township of Van Wert County, Ohio. He was raised on a farm in Tully Township of the same county near the town of Convoy. Seeing a poster urging young men to &quot;Join the Navy and See the World&quot;, he joined the United States Navy. He saw action in the 1914 United States occupation of Veracruz, Mexico. Hinton had a great fascination with early aircraft, and soon went into naval aviation.

Hinton achieved fame as one of the two pilots, along with Elmer F. Stone, of the Curtiss NC flying boat &quot;NC-4&quot;, the first aircraft to make a transatlantic flight, in May 1919. After the successful completion of this journey, he was made a knight of the Order of the Tower and Sword by the Portuguese government on 3 June 1919. As a member of the NC-4 crew, he was awarded the Navy Cross and later received a Congressional Gold Medal in 1929.

Hinton&#x27;s aeronautic adventures during the 1920s include exploring the Arctic by balloon, and a wayward flight on Navy balloon A-5598 from Rockaway Naval Air Station to Moose Factory, Ontario in the winter, which caused a month-long hike to civilization. Hinton and Kloor wrote letters home which their families sold to newspapers describing the flight, which prompted the Navy to start enforcing rarely used censorship rules. Hinton made the first flight from North America to South America (on the second try—he floated on a wing in shark infested waters off Cuba for a while at the end of the first try), and explored the Amazon rainforest by hydroplane.

He spent years touring as a speaker promoting aviation.

Walter Hinton married first to Sallie Adeline Fenner in New Orleans, Louisiana on November 17, 1917. They were divorced by 1930. Walter then married another divorcee, Carrie Susan (Muller) Knapp, in a church near Times Square in New York City on New Year&#x27;s Eve, 1931. He was 43 years old and she was 36. There were no children born of either marriage.

An airport in the county of his birth was rededicated as the Van Wert County Airport: Honorary Walter Hinton Field on July 7, 1985. The 100-year anniversary of his transatlantic flight was celebrated on Walter Hinton Day at the Van Wert County Regional Airport (KVNW) on May 18, 2019.

Hinton spent his retirement in Pompano Beach, Florida, where he delighted in sharing his memories with local children. One of his happiest events of his later years was being a special guest on an early supersonic transatlantic flight of the Concorde, making the trip which had first taken Hinton 19 days in less than four hours.

Hinton was president and founder of the Aviation Institute of U.S.A Washington D.C. in 1927 and 1928, where he published several periodicals on aviation. Periodicals included &quot;Opportunities in Aviation&quot;, &quot;The Wright Whirlwind Motor&quot;, &quot;Pioneers in Aviation&quot;, &quot;Aviation Progress&quot;, and &quot;Wings of Opportunity&quot;.

After his death in 1981, his ashes were interred at Arlington National Cemetery.

<text>The men&#x27;s 200 metre [[butterfly swimming|butterfly]] event at the 2004 Olympic Games was contested at the Olympic Aquatic Centre of the Athens Olympic Sports Complex in Athens, Greece on August 16 and 17.

After finishing fifth in Sydney four years earlier, U.S. swimmer Michael Phelps added a second gold to his collection. He touched the wall first in 1:54.04, just 0.11 of a second under his own world record. Japan&#x27;s Takashi Yamamoto earned a silver medal in an Asian record of 1:54.56. Stephen Parry ended Great Britain&#x27;s 8-year medal drought with a bronze in 1:55.52. Parry also put his teammate Melanie Marshall on the spot to fulfill her promise of shaving her head if the Brits won a single swimming medal in Athens.

Meanwhile, Poland&#x27;s Paweł Korzeniowski pulled off a fourth-place effort in a national record of 1:56.00. Defending Olympic champion Tom Malchow rounded out the final to eighth place in 1:57.48, matching his semifinal time in the process.

Other notable swimmers missed the top 8 final, featuring Denys Sylantyev (Ukraine), Justin Norris (Australia), Franck Esposito (France), and Anatoly Polyakov (Russia).

<text>Thomas Smith (May 1, 1799 – April 12, 1876) was an American tradesman who served three terms as a member of the United States House of Representatives from Indiana from 1839 to 1841, and again from 1843 to 1847. He was a Democrat.

== Early life and education ==
Smith was born in Fayette County, Pennsylvania.

== Career ==
In 1818, he moved to Rising Sun, Indiana, where he learned the trade of tanning. He then moved to Versailles, Indiana in 1821 and established a tanyard.

Smith eventually became a colonel in the state militia, and member of the Indiana House of Representatives in 1829, 1830, and from 1833 to 1836. He also served in the state senate from 1836 to 1839.

Smith was elected as a Democratic Representative for Indiana&#x27;s 4th congressional district to the Twenty-Sixth Congress, which lasted from March 4, 1839 until March 3, 1841. He was an unsuccessful candidate for election in 1840 to the Twenty-seventh Congress, but was elected in Indiana&#x27;s 3rd congressional district to the Twenty-eighth and Twenty-ninth Congresses (March 4, 1843 – March 3, 1847). He was not a candidate for renomination in 1846.

While serving in Congress, Smith voted in favor of the United States going to war against Mexico.

Smith was a delegate to the Indiana constitutional convention in 1850.

Smith died in Versailles, Indiana aged 76 and was interred in Cliff Hill Cemetery.

<text>Atlético Nacional S. A., best known as Atlético Nacional, is a Colombian professional football club based in Medellín. The club is one of only three clubs to have played in every first division tournament in the country&#x27;s history, the other two being Millonarios and Santa Fe.

Atlético Nacional was founded in 1947 as &quot;Club Atlético Municipal de Medellín&quot; by Luis Alberto Villegas López, a former president of the football league of Antioquia. The team adopted its current name in 1950. The current owner, Organización Ardila Lülle, officially acquired the team in 1996. According to CONMEBOL, Atlético Nacional is the club with the largest fan following in Colombia, with more than 15 million fans.

Atlético Nacional plays its home games at the Atanasio Girardot stadium, which has a capacity of 40,043. They share the stadium with their local rivals, Independiente Medellín. The teams face each other in a local derby known as &quot;El Clásico Paisa&quot;, which is considered one of the most important local derbies in the country. Atlético Nacional also has rivalries with Millonarios and América de Cali, two of the most important rivalries in Colombian football and South America.

Considered to be one of the strongest clubs from Colombia, it is one of the most consistent clubs in the country. Nacional is the only Colombian club that has won the two domestic short-format tournaments in a single year, Apertura and Finalización, since the format was established in 2002, winning the titles of the 2007 and 2013 seasons. The club has won 18 league championships, seven Copa Colombia and four Superliga Colombiana titles, for a total of 29 domestic titles, making it the most successful team within Colombia. It was also the first Colombian club to win the Copa Libertadores in 1989 and, after winning the title again in 2016, the most successful Colombian side in that tournament. It also has the most international titles of any Colombian club, having also won the Copa Merconorte twice, the Copa Interamericana twice, and the Recopa Sudamericana once, for a total of seven international trophies and 36 overall.

In 2016, Atlético Nacional was ranked by IFFHS as the best football club in the world, becoming the first South American club, and the first outside Europe, to receive such an honor in that ranking. It ranks 58th in the world ranking of the best clubs of all time according to the IFFHS, being the second-best-ranked Colombian team on the list. It is also ranked as the second-best Colombian club of the 20th century and as the best Colombian club so far in the 21st century. Nacional is also credited as the best Colombian team in CONMEBOL club tournaments and ranks 17th in the official club ranking of the Copa Libertadores.

As of 1 January 2021, Atlético Nacional had 9.39 million followers on social media, making it the most-followed club in Colombia and one of the most-followed clubs in South America.

==History==
Atlético Nacional was founded as &quot;Club Atlético Municipal de Medellín&quot; on 7 March 1947 by a partnership led by Luis Alberto Villegas López, former president of the football league of Antioquia. The club was created to promote sports in the city, especially football and basketball. It was based on &quot;Unión Indulana Foot-Ball Club&quot;, an amateur club from the &quot;Liga Antioqueña de Fútbol&quot;, the local amateur football league. Officially, the founding members were: Luis Alberto Villegas Lopera, Jorge Osorio, Alberto Eastman, Jaime Restrepo, Gilberto Molina, Raúl Zapata Lotero, Jorge Gómez Jaramillo, Arturo Torres Posada and Julio Ortiz.

Atlético Nacional joined the professional league for its first edition in 1948. For that tournament, each club had to pay a fee of 1,000 pesos (at that time, approximately US$1,050). Atlético Nacional played the first match of the history of the tournament, a 2–0 victory over Universidad. The tournament had ten participants that season and Atlético Nacional was 6th with seven victories, four draws and seven defeats.

Atlético Municipal changed to its current name, Atlético Nacional, for the 1951 season. The name change was made as a way to reflect the main philosophy of the club: to encourage the national sportsman. That philosophy was also reflected in the club&#x27;s policy of signing only national players, which held special meaning during Colombia&#x27;s El Dorado period, a time when most Colombian clubs were aggressively pursuing foreigners. It was not until 1953 that the club signed their first foreign player, Argentine Atilio Miotti.

Atlético Nacional won its first league title in 1954. Manager Fernando Paternoster (who managed the team from 1948 to 1951 and from 1954 to 1957) guided the team through a season in which they lost just once (to Boca Juniors de Cali). The star was Argentine striker Carlos Gambina, who led the league with 21 goals.

Economic troubles plagued the team in the late 1950s, and during 1958 the club was briefly forced to merge with crosstown rivals Independiente Medellín. These financial problems and occasional returns to the club&#x27;s policy of only signing Colombian players hampered results, and the club failed to win another title for nineteen years.

The drought was finally broken in 1973. The revival had actually started after the 1970 season, with the hiring of manager José Curti and the signing of midfielder Jorge Hugo Fernández. In 1971, Nacional won the Apertura title and only narrowly lost the national championship to Santa Fe (they fell 3–2 in a second replay of a bitterly fought championship playoff). Following a strong finish in 1972, Nacional won its second league title in 1973. They qualified for the final stage by winning the &quot;Torneo Finalización&quot; with 34 points, then finished first in a three-way round robin against Millonarios and Deportivo Cali. This championship was followed up by a runner-up finish in 1974.

1976 saw a new era for the club begin, with the hiring of Argentine manager Osvaldo Zubeldia. With his strong emphasis on conditioning and physical play, Zubeldia was able to manage the club to two further titles, 1976 and 1981, as well as regular finishes towards the top of the table. During the Zubeldia era, the heart of the team was César Cueto, central midfielder and team captain from 1979 to 1983. During the 1981 championship season, Cueto was voted the league&#x27;s player of the year. This successful era ended with Zubeldia&#x27;s sudden death of a heart attack in January 1982. Nacional remained a power in Colombia, but the death of their manager, the departure of Cueto, and the rise of América de Cali (the Red Devils won five straight championships in the 1980s) left its fans dissatisfied, and began a decade-long trophy drought.

Determined to break their stranglehold, the club made a significant change in 1987. First, they appointed Francisco Maturana as manager. A regular in the team&#x27;s defense during the 1970s, Maturana was considered a rising star in Colombian football management and had just been named manager of the national team. Maturana was thus simultaneously trying to lead the club to a domestic title and assemble a national side that could qualify for the World Cup. The two goals were complementary; Atlético Nacional&#x27;s traditional preference for Colombians over foreigners made them a natural base for Maturana to build his national team upon. However, there was also another development of more questionable legality; in the 1980s, Nacional was linked to the Medellín Cartel. Its leader, Pablo Escobar, who was also the most prominent of Colombia&#x27;s drug lords, was a fan of both football and betting, and also wanted to invest in a local club and find a way to launder his drug money. Although Escobar never took a public role, the money he poured into the club made a major impact. In Maturana&#x27;s words, &quot;The introduction of drug money into soccer allowed us to bring in great foreign players. It also kept our best players from leaving. Our level of play took off. People saw our situation and said Pablo was involved. But they couldn&#x27;t prove it&quot;.

Regardless of how the club was assembled, by 1987 they certainly had a strong roster featuring a collection of Colombian internationals. In goal was René Higuita, the flamboyant keeper known for his tendency to leave his area. In defense they had the cool, calm, and collected Andrés Escobar and veteran Luis Fernando Herrera. The midfield featured Leonel Álvarez (capped over 100 times for Colombia) and Alexis García (team captain and Medellín native). In the attack, the club could count on John Jairo Tréllez, one of the country&#x27;s most prolific goal-scorers. This lineup was good enough to finish second in both the Apertura and Finalización, qualifying for the championship round, in which they finished fourth.

The 1988 season was even better, as the club qualified for the championship round again, finishing as runners-up behind Millonarios. That result was good enough to qualify the team for the 1989 Copa Libertadores. The entire focus of the 1989 campaign was on the Copa Libertadores, which Atlético Nacional hoped to become the first Colombian club to win the competition. In the group stage, &quot;Los Verdolagas&quot; were placed with fellow Colombian side Millonarios, as well as Ecuadorian clubs Deportivo Quito and Emelec. Two wins and three draws allowed Nacional to advance out of the group stages for the first time in five attempts. In the round of 16, they defeated Racing Club of Argentina by an aggregate score of 3–2. That sent them into the quarterfinals for an all-Colombian matchup with Millonarios, their group stage opponent. Nacional won the first leg 1–0, then held out for a 1–1 draw in a controversial match in Bogotá, advancing to the semifinals. In the semifinals the team faced Danubio of Uruguay. The away match ended in a 0–0 draw, but four goals from Albeiro Usuriaga sparked a 6–0 rout in the return match to send the club into the finals. In the finals, they faced Paraguay&#x27;s Olimpia, who had already played two Libertadores finals in their history. The first leg, played in Asunción, saw Olimpia grab a 2–0 win. Nacional answered in the second leg (played in Bogotá on the grounds that the Estadio Atanasio Girardot in Medellín was too small) with a 2–0 win of their own. The tie went into penalty kicks, where Nacional won 5–4, giving the club its first Copa Libertadores title, while becoming the first Colombian club to win the competition as well.

Whilst the club hit that milestone abroad, the domestic league season was cancelled due to the assassination of referee Álvaro Ortega on 1 October after a match between Independiente Medellin and America de Cali. Although Pablo Escobar did not murder the referee himself, it is believed that one of Escobar&#x27;s hitmen did. Later that month, the team played the Supercopa Libertadores and were eliminated in the quarterfinals by Independiente.

On 17 December, Nacional played the 1989 Intercontinental Cup against Milan, champion of the 1988–89 European Cup. The result was a 1–0 defeat with a 119-minute free kick goal from Alberigo Evani. As champion of the Copa Libertadores, Nacional also played the 1989 Copa Interamericana against Pumas UNAM, winner of the 1989 CONCACAF Champions&#x27; Cup. It was played over two legs, and Nacional won it with an aggregate score of 6–1. They also played the 1990 Recopa Sudamericana against Boca Juniors, which finished in a 1–0 defeat.

The involvement of Pablo Escobar in the club remained strong. Some referees were threatened in the league and even in the Copa Libertadores, for which CONMEBOL banned Colombian clubs from the 1990 Copa Libertadores, with the exception of Nacional who was admitted as champion of the previous edition. However, the team had to play its home matches in Chile. Juan Daniel Cardellino, an Uruguayan referee, confessed to receiving death threats and $20,000 during the 1990 Copa Libertadores match between Nacional and Vasco da Gama. Nacional had won the match 2–0, but the result was annulled. A replay was ordered to be played in Santiago, and Nacional won 1–0. However, all Colombian clubs were banned from playing at their home venues for the 1991 Copa Libertadores as a result. Nacional were later eliminated in the semi-finals by their rival in the 1989 Libertadores final: Olimpia. Nacional was banned from playing the Supercopa Libertadores in 1990 and 1991 due to the incidents in the match against Vasco da Gama. They returned for the 1992 edition, but performed very badly, and were eliminated in the first round with a humiliating 8–0 defeat to Cruzeiro.

In the 1991 Libertadores, Nacional were once again eliminated in the semi-finals by Olimpia, while in that same year they won their fifth Primera A title after placing first in the final round against América, Junior and Santa Fe. The &quot;Verdolagas&quot; won two more domestic titles in the 1990s: in 1994 they won their sixth league title after topping the championship round against Millonarios, América, and Independiente Medellín, whilst in 1999 they won their seventh title after beating América on penalties in the final.

In 1995, Nacional made the Copa Libertadores finals again, losing to Gremio. In 1996, Atlético Nacional was bought by the Organización Ardila Lülle, becoming the first Colombian football club with corporate backing. In 2002, Nacional made the Copa Sudamericana finals, losing to Argentine club San Lorenzo 4–0 on aggregate.

Nacional left again the practise of a team with no foreign players in 2004, when the team signed the Venezuelan winger Jorge Rojas and the Argentine midfielder Hugo Morales. That season, Nacional made the final in both the Apertura and Finalización tournaments, but lost to rivals Independiente Medellín and Junior, respectively. In 2007, Nacional won both tournaments of the year: in the Apertura they beat Atlético Huila, and in the Finalización, they defeated La Equidad in the finals.

In 2009, Nacional played the worst season of its history, where the team placed 17th in the Torneo Apertura with three victories in eighteen matches. In the Torneo Finalización, the team did a lot better, finishing seventh in the regular season and qualifying to the playoffs, where they finished second and failed to qualify for the finals.

In 2011, Atlético Nacional won their eleventh championship after beating La Equidad over two legs in the finals of the Apertura tournament, but in the Finalización, Nacional finished 12th in the Torneo Apertura and failed to qualify to the next round, with the same thing occurring in the 2012 Apertura. During the Apertura, they were knocked out by Vélez Sársfield in the Copa Libertadores round of 16. Due to this, the team signed manager Juan Carlos Osorio in May, even though Osorio was coming off a poor spell with his previous club Puebla, winning only twice in eleven matches. For the Torneo Finalización, Nacional placed fifth and qualified to the next round. The team was unable to advance to the finals, placing second in their group behind city rivals Independiente Medellín. However, Nacional won its first Copa Colombia title that year, beating Deportivo Pasto with an aggregate score of 2–0. The team also won the first edition of the Superliga Colombiana, defeating Junior with an aggregate score of 6–1.

The next year, Nacional won for the second time the two tournaments of the league, Apertura and Finalización. In the Apertura, Nacional beat Santa Fe in the finals. In the Finalización, they defeated Deportivo Cali. In total, the team got 29 victories, 16 draws and 7 defeats that year. The team also won its second Copa Colombia title defeating Millonarios with an aggregate score of 3–2, completing a domestic double in the process.

Nacional began the 2014 season with the 2014 Superliga Colombiana, where the team lost 4–3 on penalties to Deportivo Cali after a 2–2 draw on aggregate. In the 2014 Copa Libertadores, Nacional was eliminated in the quarterfinals by Defensor Sporting 3–0 on aggregate. Three days later, they lost 1–0 to Junior in the first leg of the finals. However they came back in dramatic fashion in the second leg; with the score tied at 1–1 Junior was just minutes away from lifting the Colombian title, but a goal from Jhon Valoy in the 94th minute sent the game to penalties, where Nacional won the shootout and lifted their third consecutive title, becoming the first Colombian club to win three consecutive short tournaments. Nacional followed this championship with a good performance in the 2014 Copa Sudamericana, and although they were almost eliminated at the hands of Paraguayan minnows General Díaz in the second stage, they made the finals, where they faced River Plate. The first leg, played in Medellín, was a 1–1 draw. The second leg, played in Buenos Aires, was won by River Plate with a 2–0 score, making this the second runner-up finish for the club after losing the final in 2002.

In the 2015 Torneo Apertura, Nacional was eliminated in the quarterfinals by eventual champion Deportivo Cali. After the tournament ended, Osorio left the team after getting signed by São Paulo, being replaced by Reinaldo Rueda, who previously managed the Ecuador national team and got them to the 2014 FIFA World Cup, doing the same with the Honduras national team in 2010. In the Torneo Finalización, Nacional achieved 45 points in the regular season, winning 14 out of 20 games. They qualified to the playoffs as the first seed and later beat crosstown rivals Independiente Medellín on their path to the finals, where they defeated Junior on penalties after a 2–2 draw on aggregate. Jefferson Duque was the top goalscorer of the team and the tournament with 15 goals. With this title, Nacional became the team with the most league titles with fifteen and a total of twenty-five titles including international tournaments.

The start of 2016 brought a second Superliga Colombiana title, beating Deportivo Cali, thus qualifying for the 2016 Copa Sudamericana. Nacional placed second in the 2016 Torneo Apertura with 39 points, just one point behind rivals Independiente Medellín. The club was eliminated by Junior in the semifinals, losing 4–2 on penalties.

In the 2016 Copa Libertadores, Nacional topped its group, winning five of its six matches while conceding no goals. Nacional faced Huracán again in the round of 16. In the first leg in Buenos Aires the teams got a 0–0 draw, while in the second leg at home, Nacional won 4–2, conceding its first goals of the tournament. In the quarterfinals, they faced Rosario Central. The first leg ended with Nacional&#x27;s first defeat, with Walter Montoya scoring the lone goal of the match. In the second leg in Medellín, Marco Ruben scored a penalty goal in the eighth minute, thus forcing Nacional to score at least three goals to advance, something they accomplished. The first goal was scored by Macnelly Torres in injury time of the first half. In the second half Alejandro Guerra scored in the 50th minute and Orlando Berrío scored the goal to eliminate Rosario in the last minute of the match, shortly before a huge brawl began which eventually extended the match up to the 100th minute. In the semifinals, Nacional faced Brazilian club São Paulo. The team won both matches; the first a 2–0 win in the Estádio do Morumbi with a brace from Miguel Borja, who was bought by Nacional after becoming the top goalscorer of the Torneo Apertura with 19 goals in 21 matches for Cortuluá, and was playing his first match with the team. The second leg was a 2–1 win, with an early Jonathan Calleri goal for the Brazilians and again with a brace from Miguel Borja for the local team. The victory meant Nacional reached the finals of the Copa Libertadores for the first time since 1995, and their fifth international final overall. In the finals, they beat Independiente del Valle 2–1 on aggregate, winning their second cup and becoming the very first Colombian club to win the competition multiple times. In 2016, Nacional also won its third Copa Colombia title after beating Junior in the finals with an aggregate score of 3–1, becoming the most successful club in the tournament.

The participation of Nacional in the 2016 Copa Sudamericana began in August, with Nacional eliminating Peruvian club Deportivo Municipal 6–0 on aggregate. In the next round they beat Bolívar 2–1 on aggregate, thanks to goals from Borja in each leg. In the round of 16, Nacional eliminated Paraguayan club Sol de América 3–1 on aggregate. In the quarterfinals, the team faced Brazilian club Coritiba, with the first leg ending in a draw. In the second leg at home, Nacional turned a 1-0 deficit at halftime as Coritiba started winning the match with a free kick goal from César González, but the &quot;Verdolagas&quot; came back in the second half and secured a 3-1 victory with a hat-trick from Borja, who became the top goalscorer of the tournament with six goals. In the semifinals, Nacional faced Paraguayan club Cerro Porteño, who had eliminated two Colombian sides in the previous rounds, Santa Fe (the winner of the previous edition) and Independiente Medellín. Nacional advanced to the finals for the third time in its history, eliminating Cerro Porteño on away goals.

For the finals, Nacional had to face Brazilian team Chapecoense. It was the first final in an international competition for the Brazilian side, who had eliminated Cuiabá, Independiente, Junior and San Lorenzo to reach that round. The matches for the finals were scheduled to be played on 30 November in Medellín and 7 December in Curitiba. However, on 28 November, two days before the first leg, LaMia Flight 2933 crashed in Cerro Gordo, La Unión, just a few kilometres from Medellín, with the Chapecoense team on board. 71 people died, including 19 Chapecoense players, and the finals were suspended as a result. Two days later, Atlético Nacional requested CONMEBOL to award Chapecoense with the title. On the planned date of the match, Nacional and the City Council of Medellín organised a memorial to honor the victims of the tragedy. About 45,000 people were present inside the stadium and thousand more in the streets. On 5 December, CONMEBOL awarded Chapecoense the title of the 2016 Copa Sudamericana, as requested by Atlético Nacional, who received the &quot;CONMEBOL Centenario Fair Play&quot; award for their gesture.

In the 2016 Torneo Finalización, Nacional placed first with 37 points and qualified for the quarterfinals. The team was eliminated in the semifinals by Santa Fe: the first match ended in a 1–1 draw but the second was a 0–4 defeat, with Nacional playing with its youth squad due to its first-team squad competing in the Club World Cup. Nacional qualified to the 2016 FIFA Club World Cup as the champion of the 2016 Copa Libertadores, representing South America in the competition. The team began its participation in the semifinals, facing Japanese team Kashima Antlers, who defeated Nacional 3–0 and became the first AFC team to reach the final. Nacional got third place after beating CONCACAF Champions League winner Club América 4–3 on penalties after a 2–2 draw in regulation time.

Atlético Nacional got its first title of 2017 after beating Brazilian team Chapecoense in the Recopa Sudamericana. The Brazilian side won the first leg with a 2–1 score; however, Atlético Nacional got a 4–1 victory in the second leg, achieving a 5–3 win on aggregate and winning the tournament.

In the 2017 Copa Libertadores, Nacional was left with no chance to advance to the round of 16 after a 1–0 defeat to Botafogo. Although Nacional won their last match against Barcelona 3–1, it was not enough for the Copa Sudamericana and Nacional crashed out of the competition in the group stage, with six points. Despite the early elimination, the team fared much better in the local tournament, winning its sixteenth league championship in the 2017 Apertura. After a 2–0 defeat to Deportivo Cali in the first leg, Nacional had a sensational comeback in the second leg and won the title after a 5–1 victory at Estadio Atanasio Girardot. Shortly after the final, Reinaldo Rueda left his post as manager, being replaced by Spanish manager Juan Manuel Lillo. Lillo resigned after Nacional were eliminated from the 2017 Finalizacion playoffs by Deportes Tolima on penalties.

==Rivalries==

Atlético Nacional has had a long rivalry with local team Independiente Medellín, known under the name of &quot;El Clásico Paisa&quot;, with the word &quot;Paisa&quot; referring to something originating in the Antioquia Department. It is considered one of the most important rivalries in Colombia, and recognised by FIFA as one of the most important match-ups in the country, mainly due to the frequent brawls in between both fanbases. Nacional currently leads this rivalry in terms of wins, with a 30+ win margin. They also lead in accolades won, with 33 to Medellín&#x27;s 9. However, Independiente Medellín beat them in the first final series in which they faced each other in the 2004 Apertura, which is regarded as a great achievement by Medellín given that throughout history Nacional&#x27;s squads have almost always had a larger market value than that of Medellín&#x27;s.
The rivalry between Atlético Nacional and Millonarios is one of the most important matches in Colombia, with the two clubs holding the most league titles in Colombia (17 and 16, respectively). Dubbed by Colombian media as well as CONMEBOL as one of the most important &quot;clásicos&quot; or a &quot;superclásico&quot; of Colombian football, this rivalry is also considered one of the greatest classic matches in South America by the international press. The rivalry is fueled by a social, cultural and regional character, since it evokes the historical rivalry between two of the most developed regions of Colombia: the Antioquia Department (specifically its capital city Medellín) and the nation&#x27;s capital Bogotá.

Atlético Nacional also has a strong rivalry with América de Cali which involves the two Colombian clubs with the largest fanbases, and has been called by Colombian and international media as one of the most important &quot;clásicos&quot; or a &quot;superclásico&quot; of Colombian football, just like the rivalry with Millonarios. This rivalry is considered as an extension of the historical sociocultural and sporting rivalry between the Antioquia and Valle del Cauca departments, represented by Atlético Nacional and América, respectively. This match gained importance starting from the decade of the 1980s, when both América de Cali and Atlético Nacional began to stand out in local competition and continental tournaments. The two teams have faced each other in final stages 15 times and have played five league title-deciders between them: in 1981, 1984, 1991, 1999, and the 2002 Apertura, with Nacional winning three of these (1981, 1991, 1999) and América the remaining two.

==Brand==

=== Colours and uniform ===
The flagship colors of the team, green and white, are derived from the flags of the Antioquia Department and its capital city of Medellín, and the team is known as the &quot;cuadro verdes&quot;. Black is often also used as a secondary colour by the team. The team previously also utilized red but discontinued it due to its association with the rival team Independiente Medellín.

The team&#x27;s uniform at home is primarily green while its away colours are white with green accents. The team also has a third jersey utilizing its black secondary colour. The team&#x27;s main global sponsor featured on its jersey since 2024 is the global betting operator Betsson.

=== Badge ===
Atlético Nacional&#x27;s current badge was adopted in 2000. The badge consists of a rectangle elongated downward, with the initials A and N inside, and the tower of a castle above symbolizing &quot;grandeur, tradition, strength and hierarchy&quot;, similar to the city&#x27;s coat of arms.

The club&#x27;s main nickname, &quot;Verdolagas&quot; (purslanes) was coined in the 1950s, when the club began using green kits. This plant is endemic to the Paisa region since pre-Columbian times. The plant blooms a diminutive yellow, white or red flower; the white variety is the most common in the region, giving the color scheme to the team. It is also noteworthy that Antioquia has a great tradition regarding the cultivation of flowers, displayed annually during the Festival of Flowers.

==Stadium==

Atlético Nacional plays its local games at the Atanasio Girardot Stadium, which is part of the Atanasio Girardot Sports Complex and is owned by the Municipality of Medellín. The stadium is shared with crosstown rivals Independiente Medellín. It is located in the northwestern part of the city and has a capacity of 45,087 spectators. It was inaugurated on 19 March 1953 with a game between Nacional and Alianza Lima, which finished in a 2–2 draw.

Before 1948, when the team was known as &quot;Unión Indulana Foot-Ball Club&quot;, they played its local games at Los Libertadores Racecourse. With the creation of the professional league, they moved to San Fernando Racecourse in Itagüí, where they played until the inauguration of the Atanasio Girardot in 1953.

<text>Illinois County, Virginia, was a political and geographic region, part of the British Province of Quebec, claimed during the American Revolutionary War on July 4, 1778, by George Rogers Clark of the Virginia Militia as a result of the Illinois Campaign. Though part or all of the area was also claimed by Connecticut and Massachusetts, it was formally organized by the Commonwealth of Virginia later that year. The County was accorded official governmental existence, including legally defined boundaries and a formal governmental structure under the laws of the Commonwealth. The county seat was the old Illinois Country French village of Kaskaskia. John Todd was appointed by Governor Patrick Henry to head the county&#x27;s government. The county was abolished in January 1782, and Virginia ceded the land to the new United States Confederation government in 1784. The area later became the Northwest Territory by an Act of Congress in 1787.

Geographically, the county was bordered to the southeast by the Ohio River, in the west by the Mississippi River, and in the north by the Great Lakes at the time of its existence. It included all of what were known as eastern Illinois Country under French sovereignty and Ohio Country. Politically, its effective reach extended only to the old French settlements of Vincennes, Cahokia, and Kaskaskia.

<doc id="907372" wikidata="Q23938225" url="?curid=907372" title="Train reporting number">
<text>A train reporting number in Great Britain identifies a particular train service. It consists of:

* A single-digit number, indicating the class (type) of train, followed by
* A letter, indicating the destination area, followed by
* A two-digit number, identifying the individual train or indicating the route (the latter generally for suburban services).

The train reporting number is often called the headcode, a throwback to when the number was physically displayed at the head of a train.

==History==
===Headcodes===

Headcodes were introduced circa 1850 and were shown by oil lamps facing forward on the front of the locomotive. The position of these lamps on the locomotive denoted the class of train, which assisted the signalmen to determine the gaps between trains required in the interval-based signalling system that was used at the time. The lamps were lit at night and were usually painted white to assist with sighting by day. On some lines white discs were used by day in the place of lamps.

With the advent of absolute block signalling, the class-based headcodes allowed signallers to identify and regulate trains properly. On some busy lines, particularly busy suburban ones, the headcode denoted the route of the train rather than the class of train. In these areas junctions were complex and timetables were intense: it was more important that signallers routed the trains correctly than regulated trains by class. This was prevalent in the south of England, where companies used six headlamp positions to show the route of train.

Some companies had their own code format which led to some confusion where trains from one company ran onto other companies&#x27; lines. The Railway Clearing House intervened to standardise headcodes, based on four lamp positions, and they were adopted by the majority of lines outside the south of England. At the time of the 1923 Grouping, the standard headcodes were simplified so that normally only two lamps were used at any one time, and these codes were adopted by the London Midland and Scottish Railway, the Great Western Railway (GWR) and the London and North Eastern Railway. The Southern Railway (SR) retained a route-based headcode system, with up to four lamps in six positions. Notable exceptions were former Glasgow and South Western Railway and the Somerset and Dorset Joint Railway lines, which continued with their own headcodes on internal trains. The Caledonian Railway maintained a completely different route-based headcode system consisting of a pair of semaphore arms mounted on the locomotive – the angle of the two arms and their position (on the buffer beam or smokebox) indicated the routing.

===Train reporting numbers===
Historically train reporting numbers were used to denote trains in the internal working timetable. These contained one or more letters or numbers to either uniquely identify a particular train, or denote its route (particularly on busier lines). Not all lines used these and the details and extent of the practice varied widely between companies. Although these numbers were in many places confined to timetables and other documentation, in some busier areas they were actually shown at the head of the train.

On the SR, a single alphabetic character system of denoting routes used on suburban lines grew into a two-character route-based system. This was developed at the same time as a significant programme of electrification and the consequent introduction of a large number of multiple unit trains. Many of these trains were fitted with display devices to show the route code instead of a lamp or disc-based headcode. Originally this was a back-lit stencil with the single letter code, later a two-character roller-blind system was used. The code system had equivalence with the lamp or disc route-based headcodes in assisting signallers with routing trains.

On the other railways, the reporting number was on occasion displayed at the head of the train along with the lamp headcode. This happened more often than not with special trains or other unusual trains (e.g. summer Saturday timetables), to allow signallers to identify unfamiliar trains and route them correctly. This code was sometimes either chalked onto the locomotive front or pasted as paper characters onto a headcode disc. The GWR sometimes used a three-character frame mounted on the locomotive smokebox in which the train reporting number could be displayed.

After nationalisation, British Railways continued with these headcodes and the new diesel and electric locomotives and multiple units were built either with a disc/lamp system (now powered by electricity) or a two to four character roller-blind display system depending on what part of the network they were to work.

===1960 headcode/reporting number merger===

In 1960, the current format was introduced where train class, route and reporting number information are combined in four characters. All diesel and electric locomotives and multiple units built after that date were fitted with a roller-blind display that could display the full reporting number, except locomotives and multiple units destined for the Southern Region, which continued its long-standing practice of two-character alpha-numeric displays.

By 1976, the replacement of the huge number of manual signal boxes with centralised power-signalling coupled with computer-based train control and more modern telecommunications systems meant that it was no longer necessary to display headcodes throughout the railway network. Outside the Southern Region blinds were set to &quot;00&quot; or &quot;0000&quot;, and discs/lamps to the former express passenger code. Roller blinds were later blanked or plated over to show two dots and new trains introduced for service outside the Southern Region after this time usually had no train reporting number display equipment. Many trains intended to run over Southern Region lines were designed to display the numeric route-code portion of the train reporting number, which they still display, usually as a dot-matrix display.

==Components==
The main purpose of the headcode is to assist the signaller in routing and regulating the train correctly, and it is especially useful if services are disrupted. After the introduction of the four-character codes, originally it was intended for signallers to visually note the train by the number displayed on its front; with the coming of automated systems the number has been retained internally within timetables and signalling systems but with some exceptions detailed above is no longer displayed on trains. Technically, every train has an 8 digit code which is unique to it, but this is often shortened to the 4 digit codes shown below.

===Train classes===

For operational reasons, certain trains have priority in running. To help operating staff, they are grouped into classes; these were formerly identified using letters. When the letter groups were replaced by numerals on 18 June 1962, the classifications became:
#(formerly A) Express passenger, newspaper, or breakdown train; express diesel car; snow plough on duty; light engine proceeding to assist disabled train.
#(B) Ordinary passenger, branch passenger or &quot;mixed&quot; train; rail motor (loaded or empty); ordinary passenger or parcels diesel car; breakdown train not on duty.
#(C) Parcels, fish, fruit, livestock, milk or other perishable train composed entirely of vehicles conforming to coaching stock requirements; empty coaching stock (not specially authorised to carry Class A code).
#(C) Express freight, livestock, perishable or ballast train pipe-fitted throughout with the automatic vacuum brake operative on 90 per cent of the vehicles.
#(D) Express freight, livestock, perishable or ballast train with not less than 50 per cent vacuum braked vehicles piped to the engine.
#(E) Express freight, livestock, perishable or ballast train with 20 per cent vacuum braked vehicles piped to the engine.
#(F) Express freight, livestock, or ballast train not fitted with continuous brake.
#(H) Through freight or ballast trains not running under C, D, E or F conditions.
#(J) Mineral or empty wagon train.(K) Pick-up branch freight, mineral or ballast train.

The classes are periodically revised, and , the classes have been:

# Express passenger train; nominated postal or parcels train; breakdown or overhead line equipment train going to clear the line (headcode 1Z99); traction unit going to assist a failed train (1Z99); snow plough going to clear the line (1Z99)
# Ordinary passenger train; Officers&#x27; special train (2Z01)
# Freight train if specially authorised; a parcels train; autumn-railhead treatment train; empty coaching stock train if specially authorised
# Freight train which can run up to 75 mph (120 km/h)
# Empty coaching stock train
# Freight train which can run up to 60 mph (95 km/h)
# Freight train which can run up to 45 mph (70 km/h)
# Freight train which can run up to 35 mph (55 km/h)
# train; other passenger train if specially authorised

===Destination letters===

For long-distance trains, the country is divided into areas based upon the old British Rail regions. Each one is assigned a letter as follows:

*E: Eastern
*L: Anglia
*M: Midland
*O: Southern
*S: Scotland
*V: Western

A train going from one region to another is given the letter of the destination region in its headcode. Prior to 1967 N was used to signify trains destined for the erstwhile North Eastern region.

For trains internal to a region, the remaining letters can be used to indicate either:

* A destination zone inside that region, or
* A route within that region.

Other regions can use these letters for different areas, but the inter-regional codes have the same meaning throughout the country.

In 2007, a special letter Q was introduced for track recording trains, such as the Network Rail New Measurement Train. This emphasises to signallers that the train is to run its booked route as it is recording, not to be diverted without the prior knowledge of the controller. Prior to this, trains operated by British Rail Research Division used the letter T.

The letters X and Z are generally reserved for special use – see Special numbering.

===Individual identifier===
Because there are many trains of the same type heading for similar destinations (for example, most expresses to Scotland have headcodes beginning with 1S) the last two digits are used to separate individual services or to indicate the route (generally for suburban services).

Every train has an 8 digit code assigned to it which is used to ensure that every train has a unique ID within TRUST. This is subdivided into 3 parts. For example, a headcode for the 05:56 East Midlands Railway Sheffield - St Pancras service would be written thus: &quot;251C11M5&quot;. This is divided into 3 parts. The part at the beginning (25) shows the origin for this service. In this case, 25 = Sheffield. Start locations have a 2 digit location code. 1C11 is the train reporting number that is visible to the signaller and the train crew. The final component (M5) is the version of this service being run. This will vary for a planned change of route or a planned change in timings. This tells what version of the timetable the service is booked to run on and is used in delay recording and performance management.

==Examples==

*The 06:09 CrossCountry service from Bath Spa to Glasgow Central is an express passenger service, so it is a class 1 train. It is going from the Western to the Scottish region, so it is given the letter S for its destination. It is one of the first services in the day, and so its headcode is 1S35.
*The 09:00 London North Eastern Railway service from London King&#x27;s Cross to Edinburgh Waverley is an express passenger service, so is a class 1 train. It is going to the Scottish region, so is given the letter S. Its headcode is 1S09.
*The 22:00 Avanti West Coast service from London Euston to Crewe is internal to the Midland region, so it uses the Crewe (and Stoke) letter K for its destination. As it is a late evening service, the two digits on the end of the headcode are higher. Its headcode is 1K77.
*In some areas, more particularly with local services, some services will recycle headcodes. For example, the 06:11 Arriva Rail North Colne to Preston service has the headcode 2N81, followed by the 07:09 service which has the headcode 2N82. Subsequent services are numbered consecutively up to 2N89, before the numbers are recycled with the 16:11 departure also having the headcode 2N81.
*The china clay train from Cliffe Vale to St Blazey is limited to 60 mph, so it is a class 6 train. It is going to the Western region, and its headcode is 6V70.
*However, if 6V70 ran with a different, slower set of wagons restricted to 45 mph, it could run as 7V70, and if no wagons needed to be moved, it could run as 0V70 (engine only).

==Special numbering==
It is common practice for empty coaching stock (class 5) trains on the way to form a service or returning to depot having completed a service to run with the same code as that service, with the 1 or 2 prefix altered to 5 – hence, 5P23 is the empty stock to form express passenger service 1P23. Similarly, locomotives on the way to pick up or having dropped off a train, or running round to change the direction of travel, are given the train number but with the prefix altered to 0.

An unusual situation arose with the opening of the Channel Tunnel: many continental train reporting numbers are all numeric. Eurostar trains therefore have a 9Oxx or 9Ixx reporting number in Britain and a corresponding 90xx or 91xx number in Europe, neatly utilising the similarity between the letters O and I and the numbers 0 and 1 to unite the two reporting number systems.

Some passenger services operate with class 9s to differentiate them from other services.

Trains with some specific requirements, such as out-of-gauge loads or the Royal Train, run with the letter X, and special trains not in the regular train service (e.g. charters, railtours, emergency trains or as-required locomotive moves) have Z. Automatic Route Setting code prevents the automatic routing of trains with the letter X in their headcode and signallers must route these trains manually. The GNER &quot;White Rose&quot; service from London King&#x27;s Cross to Leeds formed of a 16 carriage Regional Eurostar set ran with a prefix of 1X due to the train&#x27;s unusually long length.

Rail replacement bus services are run under the headcode 0B00. In a similar manner, shipping services run on behalf of or in tandem with rail services are given headcode 0S00.

Tyne &amp; Wear Metro trains have three-digit numbers which are displayed in the driver&#x27;s cab window. Those on the Sunderland line are generally in the range 101 – 112, and the set operates all day on the Newcastle Airport to South Hylton route with this number. When on Network Rail metals (i.e. south of Pelaw to South Hylton) the initial digit &#x27;1&#x27; is replaced by &#x27;2I&#x27; to give a four-digit TOPS Train Reporting Number, e.g. train 104 becomes 2I04, although the three-digit number in the cab remains unaltered.

<text>Fawcett Comics, a division of Fawcett Publications, was one of several successful comic book publishers during the Golden Age of Comic Books in the 1940s. Its most popular character was Captain Marvel, the alter ego of radio reporter Billy Batson, who transformed into the hero whenever he said the magic word &quot;Shazam!&quot;.

Other characters published by Fawcett include Captain Video, Hopalong Cassidy, Ibis the Invincible, Bulletman and Bulletgirl, Spy Smasher, Captain Midnight, Phantom Eagle, Mister Scarlet and Pinky, Minute-Man, Commando Yank and Golden Arrow.

Aside from the better known superhero books, Fawcett also published a short-lived line of horror comics during the early 1950s, a string of titles which included &quot;This Magazine Is Haunted&quot;, &quot;Beware! Terror Tales&quot;, &quot;Worlds of Fear&quot;, &quot;Strange Suspense Stories,&quot; and &quot;Unknown World&quot;. Other genres included teenage humor &quot;(Ozzie and Babs),&quot; cartoon animal &quot;(Hoppy the Marvel Bunny),&quot; romance &quot;(Sweethearts),&quot; war &quot;(Soldier Comics)&quot; and Western &quot;(Six Gun Heroes).&quot; Fawcett also produced comics based on contemporary movie stars &quot;(Tom Mix, Lash LaRue, Monte Hale)&quot; and matinee serials &quot;(Nyoka the Jungle Girl).&quot; The entire line was dropped in 1953, when Fawcett closed down their comics publishing wing (though many titles were picked up by Charlton Comics).

==History==

Fawcett Publications was founded by Wilford Fawcett in 1919 with the magazine &quot;Captain Billy&#x27;s Whiz Bang&quot; and eventually expanded into a line of periodicals with a combined circulation of ten million a month. The company joined in the explosion of comic book publications in the United States in the late 1930s and early 1940s. Its initial entry, developed by writer Bill Parker and artist C. C. Beck, was &quot;Thrill Comics&quot; #1 (January 1940), a single issue of which was published only as an ashcan copy. The content was then reworked (for example, the lead character of Captain Thunder was renamed to Captain Marvel) and published as &quot;Whiz Comics&quot; #2 (February 1940).

In addition to Beck, the line-up of artists who contributed to Fawcett Comics include Al Allard, Harry Anderson, Ken Bald, Phil Bard, Al Bare, Dan Barry, John Belfi, Dave Berg, Jack Binder, Alex Blum, Bob Boyajian, Bob Butts, Al Carreno, Joe Certa, Nat Champlin, Pete Costanza, Greg Duncan, Leonard Frank, Bob Fujitani, Till Goodson, Ray Harford, Bob Hebberd, John Jordan, H. C. Kiefer, Jack Kirby, Andre Le Blanc, Charles Nicholas, Carl Pfeufer, Mac Raboy, Pete Riss, Ed Robbins, John Rosenberger, Kurt Schaffenberger, Joe Simon, Jon Small, Ed Smalle, Jack Sparling, John Spranger, Chic Stone, Charles Sultan, Marc Swayze, Ben Thompson, George Tuska, Bill Ward, Clem Weisbecker, Burt Whitman, Reuben Zubofsky and Nick Zuraw.

The whimsical adventures of Captain Marvel and the Marvel Family (which included Captain Marvel, Jr., Mary Marvel, the Lieutenants Marvel, etc.) eventually outsold those of &quot;Superman&quot;. National Comics (as DC Comics was then known) sued Fawcett, claiming that the Captain infringed on the copyright of their original costumed superhero. National Comics&#x27; 1941 copyright hearing against Fawcett was dismissed on a technicality; the McClure Newspaper Syndicate had failed to include the proper copyright notice on many of the &quot;Superman&quot; daily newspaper strips. On appeal, however, Judge Learned Hand ruled that this was not an indication of intent to abandon the Superman property, and since it had been revealed that certain Captain Marvel stories were copies of certain Superman stories, National Comics would be able to seek damages for the violation of the copyrights of those specific stories.

Facing a declining comics market, in 1953 Fawcett Comics ceased publication of its superhero titles and settled the ongoing case (the non-comic book divisions of Fawcett continued to publish). Several of Fawcett&#x27;s completed stories and artwork, as well as a few characters, were sold to Charlton Comics. Fawcett returned to publishing comics in the 1960s, mainly publishing &quot;Dennis the Menace&quot; and other such titles.

In 1967 Marvel Comics gained the trademark &quot;Captain Marvel&quot; with the publication of an unrelated character&#x27;s series. In 1972 DC licensed — and in 1994, purchased — Captain Marvel and his related characters. Because of Marvel&#x27;s trademark, DC has instead used the trademark Shazam! as the title of their Captain Marvel-related comic books and thus the name under which they market and promote the character. In 1973, Shazam and the Marvel family became an additional Earth (to the Pre-Crisis DC continuity), known for a period of time as Earth-S.

===Fawcett Movie Comic===

Fawcett also published several comic book adaptations of Hollywood films under the banner &quot;Fawcett Movie Comic&quot;. The publications ranged from 1949 to 1952 and were released bi-monthly. Early issues were simply labeled with &quot;A Fawcett Publication&quot; on the covers with no numbering nor date (other than the copyright year inside). It was not until issue No. 7 (actually the eighth adaptation) that the series started numbering each comic book and using the &quot;Fawcett Movie Comic&quot; series title. Starting with issue No. 9, the series also printed the month of publication on the covers.

The majority of the comic books were adapted from westerns, with few known exceptions; &quot;Ten Tall Men&quot; was a French Foreign Legion story taking place in the African desert, &quot;The Brigand&quot; was a Napoleonic-era swashbuckler and &quot;Destination Moon&quot; and &quot;The Man from Planet X&quot; were science fiction space stories.

The Le Moyne Channel separates it from Notre Dame Island. Saint Helen&#x27;s Island and Notre Dame Island together make up Jean-Drapeau Park (formerly Parc des Îles).

It was named in 1611 by Samuel de Champlain in honour of his wife, Hélène de Champlain, née Boullé. The island belonged to the Le Moyne family of Longueuil from 1665 until 1818, when it was purchased by the British government. A fort (Saint Helen Island Fort), powderhouse and blockhouse were built on the island as defences for the city, in consequence of the War of 1812.

==History==
In 1838 plans were in place by the British Ordnance Department to establish an observatory, but it was moved to Toronto instead.

The newly formed Canadian government acquired the island in 1870; it was converted into a public park in 1874. The public used it as a beach and swam in the river.

In the 1940s, during World War II, Saint Helen&#x27;s Island, along with various other regions within Canada, such as the Saguenay–Lac-Saint-Jean and Hull, Quebec had prisoner-of-war camps. St. Helen&#x27;s prison was number 47 and remained unnamed just like most of Canada&#x27;s other war prisons. The prisoners of war (POWs) were sorted and classified into categories, including their nationality and civilian or military status. In this camp, POWs were mostly of Italian and German nationality. Also, prisoners were forced into hard labour which included farming and lumbering the land. In 1944, the camp was closed and shortly afterwards destroyed because of an internal report on the treatment of prisoners.

The archipelago of which Saint Helen&#x27;s Island is a part was chosen as the site of Expo 67, a World&#x27;s Fair on the theme of &quot;Man and His World&quot;, or in French, &quot;Terre des Hommes&quot;. In preparation for Expo 67, the island was greatly enlarged and consolidated with several nearby islands, using earth excavated during the construction of the Montreal Metro. The nearby island, Notre Dame Island, was built from scratch.

After Expo 67, the site continued to be used as a fairground, now under the name Man and His World or &quot;Terre des Hommes&quot;. Most of the expo installations were dismantled and the island was returned to parkland.

==Visitor attractions==
Several important attractions are found on the island, including the Saint Helen Island Fort, the La Ronde amusement park, the Biosphere (an interpretative museum about the Saint Lawrence River installed in the former American Pavilion from Expo), and an Aquatic Complex (French: &quot;Complexe aquatique de l&#x27;île Sainte-Hélène&quot;) that includes three exterior pools. The park is a primary recreational site for Montrealers and hosts frequent concerts and shows, including the L&#x27;International des Feux Loto-Québec international fireworks competition and the annual Osheaga music festival. As of 2022, it will be the home of Lasso Montreal, a brand new country music themed festival that was originally intended to debut in 2020 but was postponed to 2022 due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Montreal.

During the summer season, on Sundays, there are live DJs at the Piknic Elektronic event. The Circuit Gilles Villeneuve, a 4,361-metre long car-racing track, is also located on the island. It has played host to the Canadian Grand Prix since 1978. 

==Transportation==
The island can be accessed by public transit, by car, by bicycle or by foot. The Concordia Bridge links St. Helen&#x27;s Island to Montreal&#x27;s Cité du Havre neighbourhood on the Island of Montreal as well as Notre Dame Island (which itself is connected to Saint-Lambert on the south shore by bicycle paths). The island is also accessible via the Jacques Cartier Bridge from both the Island of Montreal and Longueuil on the south shore. The Yellow Line of the Montreal Metro has a stop on St. Helen&#x27;s Island: Jean-Drapeau station.

<text>Thomas Smith (1773January 29, 1846) was a Federalist member of the United States House of Representatives who served Pennsylvania&#x27;s 1st congressional district from 1815 to 1817.

A native of Pennsylvania, Smith lived in Tinicum Township in the state&#x27;s Delaware County when, in 1806, he was elected to the Pennsylvania House of Representatives, serving through 1807. A Federalist Party candidate in the Election of 1814, he won the first district seat to represent Pennsylvania in the Fourteenth United States Congress from March 4, 1815, to March 3, 1817.

In 1815, the first year of his one-term Congressional service, Smith moved to Darby Township (later Darby Borough). Three decades later, at the time of his death, he was still in public service, as a justice of the peace in Darby. Although the year of his birth has remained undocumented, his record as a state politician in the first decade of the 19th century indicates that he lived at least into his mid- to late sixties. The interment was in St. James&#x27;s (Old Swedes) Cemetery in Paschall in present-day Philadelphia.

Among his descendants was Aubrey Henry Smith (1814–1891), a lawyer, U.S. district attorney, and early officer of the Philadelphia, Wilmington and Baltimore Railroad.

<text>Carmen Lombardo (July 16, 1903 – April 17, 1971) was lead saxophonist and featured vocalist for his brother Guy Lombardo&#x27;s orchestra. He was also a successful composer. In 1927, Carmen Lombardo was the vocalist of the hit record Charmaine, performed by Guy Lombardo and His Royal Canadians.

==Early years==
Lombardo was born in London, Ontario, Canada. As a child, he took flute lessons, and later learned to play saxophone. 

He had three brothers who also became musicians: Guy, Lebert, and Victor.

==Career==
As a young man played in the Lombardo Brothers Concert Company with Guy on violin and another brother, Lebert, on trumpet or piano. As the band grew, Guy became conductor, and the band developed into The Royal Canadians in 1923, in which Carmen both sang and wrote music. 

He frequently collaborated with American composers and his music was recorded by Louis Armstrong, Bing Crosby, and others. Many of his compositions have also been used in Woody Allen films. When singing songs like &quot;Alone at a Table for Two&quot; he would allow his voice to tremble, and seem nearly to break into tears- he was caricatured in Warner Brothers cartoons as &quot;Cryman&quot; Lombardo.

In the late 1960s, actor-raconteur Tony Randall made several TV appearances on &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot; in which he sang songs written by Carmen Lombardo in a voice imitating (and somewhat exaggerating) Lombardo&#x27;s style. On one appearance, Lombardo and Randall performed a duet of Lombardo&#x27;s &quot;Boo Hoo (You&#x27;ve Got Me Crying for You)&quot;, which was one of the songs that Randall typically included in his Lombardo routine.

==Death==
Lombardo died of cancer in Miami in 1971, aged 67.

==Compositions by Carmen Lombardo==

Lombardo&#x27;s popular compositions included:
*The 1928 classic &quot;Sweethearts on Parade&quot;, which was number one for three weeks in 1929 on the U.S. pop charts of the day. 
*&quot;A Lane in Spain&quot;, a popular recording by Jean Goldkette and His Orchestra in 1927.
*&quot;Ridin&#x27; Around in the Rain&quot;, written with Gene Austin in 1934. Popular versions were by Austin, Bing Crosby and Earl Burtnett. 
*&quot;Coquette&quot;, 

*&quot;Boo Hoo (You&#x27;ve Got Me Crying For You)&quot;, a major hit for the Guy Lombardo orchestra.
*&quot;A Sailboat in the Moonlight&quot; (1937) with John Jacob Loeb, 
*&quot;Seems Like Old Times&quot;, 
*&quot;Get Out Those Old Records&quot;, 
*&quot;Return to Me&quot; (1957) with Danny Di Minno.
*&quot;You&#x27;re Beautiful To-Night, My Dear&quot;. 
*&quot;Powder Your Face with Sunshine (Smile, Smile, Smile)&quot;, written with Stanley Rochinski in 1948–49.
Lombardo and John Jacob Loeb&#x27;s 1942 song &quot;There Won&#x27;t Be a Shortage of Love&quot; was the first song written in response to American government rationing in World War II.

He wrote five songs for the 1934 film &quot;Many Happy Returns&quot;, in which the orchestra appeared.

Lombardo wrote the words and music with John Jacob Loeb for Guy Lombardo&#x27;s stage productions of &quot;Arabian Nights&quot; (1954, 1955), &quot;Paradise Island&quot; (1961, 1962), and &quot;Mardi Gras&quot; (1965, 1966) at Jones Beach Marine Theater, New York.

<doc id="907415" wikidata="Q2063458" url="?curid=907415" title="Presidential dollar coins">
<text>Presidential dollar coins (authorized by ) are a series of United States dollar coins with engravings of relief portraits of U.S. presidents on the obverse and the Statue of Liberty (&quot;Liberty Enlightening the World&quot;) on the reverse.

From 2007 to 2011, presidential dollar coins were minted for circulation in large numbers, resulting in an ample stockpile of unused $1 coins. From 2012 to 2016, new coins in the series were minted only for collectors. A new coin was released on December 4, 2020, to honor George H. W. Bush, who died after the original program ended.

==Legislative history==
, the Presidential $1 Coin Act of 2005, was introduced on May 17, 2005, by Senator John E. Sununu with over 70 cosponsors. It was reported favorably out of the U.S. Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs without amendment on July 29, 2005. The Senate passed it with a technical amendment (), by unanimous consent on November 18, 2005. The House of Representatives passed it (291–113) on December 13, 2005 (a similar bill, H.R. 902, had previously passed in the House, but it was the Senate bill which was passed by both chambers). The enrolled bill was presented to president George W. Bush on December 15, 2005, and he signed it into law on December 22, 2005.

==Program details==
The program began on January 1, 2007, and, like the 50 State quarters program, was not scheduled to end until every eligible subject was honored. The program was to issue coins featuring each of four presidents per year on the obverse, issuing one for three months before moving on to the next president in chronological order by term in office. To be eligible, a president must have been deceased for at least two years prior to the time of minting. The United States Mint called it the Presidential $1 Coin Program.

The reverse of the coins bears the Statue of Liberty (formally &quot;Liberty Enlightening the World&quot;), the inscription &quot;$1&quot; and the inscription &quot;United States of America&quot; in all caps, in the font ITC Benguiat. Inscribed along the edge of the coin is the year of minting or issuance of the coin, the mint mark, 13 stars, and also the legend in the following arrangement: ; before 2009, the national motto &quot;In God We Trust&quot; was also part of the edge lettering. The word &quot;Liberty&quot; is absent from the coin altogether, since the decision was made that the image of the Statue of Liberty on the reverse of the coin was sufficient to convey the message of liberty. The text of the act does not specify the color of the coins, but per the U.S. Mint &quot;the specifications will be identical to those used for the current Golden dollar&quot;. The George Washington $1 coin was first available to the public on February 15, 2007, in honor of Washington&#x27;s Birthday, which was observed on February 19.

This marked the first time since the St. Gaudens Double Eagle (1907–1933) that the United States had issued a coin with edge lettering for circulation. Edge-lettered coins date back to the 1790s. The process was started to discourage the shaving of gold coin edges, a practice which was used to cheat payees. In December 2007, Congress passed , moving &quot;In God We Trust&quot; to either the obverse or reverse of the coins.
This is the same bill that created a program that included quarters for Washington, D.C., Puerto Rico, Northern Mariana Islands, Guam, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and American Samoa.

The act had been introduced because of the failure of the Sacagawea $1 coin to gain widespread circulation in the United States. The act sympathized with the need of the nation&#x27;s private sector for a $1 coin, and expected that the appeal of changing the design would increase the public demand for new coins, as the public generally responded well to the state quarter program. The program was also intended to help educate the public about the nation&#x27;s presidents and their history. In case the coins did not catch on with the general public, then the mint leaders hoped that collectors would be as interested in the dollars as they were with the state quarters, which generated about $6.3 billion in seigniorage (&quot;i.e.,&quot; the difference between the face value of the coins and the cost to produce them) between January 1999 and December 2008.
Unlike the state quarter program and the Westward Journey nickel series, which suspended the issuance of the current design during those programs, the act directed the Mint to continue to issue Sacagawea dollar coins during the presidential series. The law states that at least one in three issued dollars must be a Sacagawea dollar. Furthermore, the Sacagawea design was required to continue after the presidential coin program ended. These requirements were added at the behest of the North Dakota congressional delegation to ensure that Sacagawea, whom North Dakotans consider to be one of their own, ultimately remains on the dollar coin.

However, Federal Reserve officials indicated to Congress that &quot;if the Presidential $1 Coin Program does not stimulate substantial transactional demand for dollar coins, the requirement that the Mint nonetheless produce Sacagawea dollars would result in costs to the taxpayer without any offsetting benefits.&quot; In that event, the Federal Reserve indicated that it would &quot;strongly recommend that Congress reassess the one-third requirement.&quot; The one-third requirement was later changed to one-fifth by the Native American $1 Coin Act, passed on September 20, 2007.

Previous versions of the act called for removing from circulation dollar coins issued before the Sacagawea dollar, most notably the Susan B. Anthony dollar, but the version of the act which became law merely directs the Secretary of the Treasury to study the matter and report back to Congress. The act required federal government agencies (including the United States Postal Service), businesses operating on federal property, and federally funded transit systems to accept and dispense dollar coins by January 2008, and to post signs indicating that they do so.

=== Minting errors ===
On March 8, 2007, the United States Mint announced, that on February 15, 2007, an unknown number of George Washington presidential $1 coins were released into circulation without their edge inscriptions (the U.S. mottos, &quot;In God We Trust&quot; and &quot;&quot;, the coin&#x27;s mint mark, and its year of issuance; i.e. (where is either  or )). Ron Guth, of the Professional Coin Grading Service, estimated at least 50,000 coins were released without the edge inscriptions. The first such coin discovered was sold on eBay for , while later coins were selling for , as of late March 2007. Because one of the inscriptions missing from the coins is the motto &quot;In God we trust&quot;, some articles on the subject have referred to them as &quot;godless dollars&quot;. Fake &quot;godless dollars&quot; have been produced with the edge lettering filed off.

Also, John Adams presidential dollars have been discovered with plain edges. They are fewer in quantity than George Washington plain-edge dollars, making them rarer, thus more expensive. A more frequently encountered edge lettering error for the John Adams dollar is a coin with doubled edge lettering. This error occurs when a coin passes through the edge lettering machine twice. Most examples of the doubled-edge-letter John Adams dollar are from the Philadelphia Mint; Denver Mint issues are comparatively scarce. They are seen in two varieties: 1) with both edge lettering inscriptions reading in the same direction, called &quot;overlapped&quot;, and 2) with the two inscriptions running in opposite directions—i.e., inverted or upside-down relative to one another—called &quot;inverted&quot;.

In early March 2007, a Colorado couple found a dollar coin which had not been struck with a die pair (missing the portrait of the president and the Statue of Liberty), but with edge lettering on the otherwise-blank planchet.

Some of the coins have the words on the rim struck upside down (president face up). These are not minting errors, but rather a variation created by the minting process. Such upside-down coins have been sold on auction websites like eBay and Amazon for greater than their face value, though they represent roughly 50% of the minted population.

===Stockpile and suspension of production===

By 2011, 1.4 billion uncirculated $1 coins were stockpiled, which, if laid flat, could reach from Los Angeles to Chicago. By 2016, this number might have reached two billion if the minting had continued unchanged.

Rep. Jackie Speier of California circulated a &quot;Dear Colleague&quot; letter recommending that the U.S. not produce any dollar coins. She was planning to introduce legislation calling for the immediate halting of all dollar coin programs.

The United States Government Accountability Office has stated that discontinuing the dollar bill in favor of the dollar coin would save the U.S. government about $5.5 billion over 30 years.

On December 13, 2011, Vice President Joe Biden and Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner announced that the minting of presidential $1 coins for circulation would be suspended. Future entries in the program, beginning with those of Chester A. Arthur, would be issued in reduced quantities, only for collectors.

By the end of 2022, the stockpile of $1 coins was reduced to 888 million. The inventory was estimated to last for nearly 16 more years (i.e. until 2038).

===The program&#x27;s end and continuation===
The act specifies that for a former president to be honored, they must have been deceased for at least two years before issue. Hence, former presidents George H. W. Bush, Jimmy Carter, Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, and then-current president Barack Obama were ineligible to have a dollar coin issued in their honor when the series ended in 2016, after honoring Ronald Reagan, the last president who was eligible.

Since the program has terminated, producing coins for those presidents not yet honored would require another Act of Congress. On February 12, 2019, Senator John Cornyn introduced a bill to authorize a presidential dollar honoring George H. W. Bush and an accompanying first spouse gold coin for Barbara Bush, which was signed into law by President Donald Trump on January 28, 2020.

==Collecting==
Despite not seeing widespread use in circulation, the series has seen a few lower-mintage issues, mostly in specially marketed sets. Reverse proof issues were made for the coins depicting Harry S. Truman, Dwight D. Eisenhower, John F. Kennedy, Lyndon B. Johnson, Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush from 2015 to 2020. These issues had mintages between 16,000 and 48,000, depending on the issue.

==Coin details==
Dollar coins were issued bearing the likenesses of presidents, as follows:
==First spouse program==

The United States has honored the spouses of each of the presidents honored by the Presidential $1 Coin Act by issuing half-ounce $10 gold coins featuring their images, in the order they served as first spouse, beginning in 2007. All first spouses have been women (often called first ladies).

The obverse of these coins feature portraits of the nation&#x27;s first spouses, their names, the dates and order of their terms as first spouse, as well as the year of minting or issuance, and the words &quot;In God We Trust&quot; and &quot;Liberty&quot;. The United States Mint issued the first spouse gold coins on the same schedule as the presidential $1 coins issued honoring the presidents. Each coin has a unique reverse design featuring an image emblematic of that spouse&#x27;s life and work, as well as the words &quot;The United States of America&quot;, &quot;E Pluribus Unum&quot;, &quot;$10&quot;, &quot;1/2 oz.&quot;, and &quot;.9999 fine gold&quot;.

When a president served unmarried, as four presidents did, a gold coin was issued bearing an obverse image emblematic of Liberty as depicted on a circulating coin of that era, and bearing a reverse image emblematic of themes of that president. One exception is the coin depicting suffragist Alice Paul which represents the era of the Chester A. Arthur presidency, as Arthur was a widower.

The act, as written, explicitly states that the first spouse coins are to be released at the same time as their respective $1 presidential coins. Because the act links a first spouse&#x27;s eligibility for a coin to that of the presidential spouse, it means that a living first spouse could have appeared on a coin; this did not happen, though Nancy Reagan died only a few months before the release of her coin.

The United States Mint launched these coins officially at 12 pm EDT on June 19, 2007.
They provided two versions of the coin: a proof version for $429.95 and an uncirculated version for $410.95.

The United States Mint also produces and makes available to the public bronze medal duplicates of the first spouse gold coins which are not legal tender. In February 2009 &quot;Coin World&quot; reported that some 2007 Abigail Adams medals were struck using the reverse from the 2008 Louisa Adams medal. These pieces, called mules, were contained within the 2007 first spouse medal set.

Although the First Spouse program ended in 2016, it was continued in 2020 to honor Barbara Bush.

A full listing of the coins is:

* Due to volatility in the gold market, the U.S. Mint lowered the price to $549.95 on November 12, 2008, to more accurately reflect the current spot price of gold. This however constantly changed as the price of gold changed. The mint used pricing range tables to adjust pricing of gold coin: 2016 Pricing Grid

† Chester A. Arthur&#x27;s wife Ellen died before he succeeded to the presidency. Since there was no first lady during his presidency, the act explicitly states that Alice Paul, who was born during his term, would appear on this coin. Since Paul was never first lady, the coin does not have a served date.

==Other provisions==
The act also has two other provisions, for the following:
* Issuance of a $50 bullion coin reproducing the 1913 buffalo nickel designed by James Earle Fraser. See American Buffalo (coin)
* Redesign of the reverse of the Lincoln cent in 2009 to show four different scenes from Abraham Lincoln&#x27;s life in honor of the bicentennial of his birth. These four scenes are:
*# his birth and early childhood in Kentucky
*# his formative years in Indiana
*# his professional life in Illinois
*# his presidency in Washington, D.C.

In 2009, numismatic cents that have the metallic copper content of cents minted in 1909 were issued for collectors.

Since 2010, another redesigned reverse for the Lincoln cent is being minted; this &quot;shall bear an image emblematic of President Lincoln&#x27;s preservation of the United States of America as a single and united country&quot;, and replaced the Lincoln Memorial reverse in use from 1959 to 2008.

<doc id="907431" wikidata="Q5240395" url="?curid=907431" title="The Apprentice (American TV series) season 1">
<text>The first season of &quot;The Apprentice&quot; aired on NBC in the winter and spring of 2004. It featured 16 candidates.

This season had high ratings, ranking at No. 7 in the average weekly Nielsen Rankings, with an average viewership of 20.7 million viewers each week. The final episode of the season was seen by an estimated 28.05 million viewers and ranked as the No. 1 show of the week, beating out a new episode of &quot;&quot;. It was the most popular new show of 2004.

==Summary==
Season one had real estate magnate Donald Trump as the show&#x27;s executive producer and host.

The season started with 16 contestants, eight men and eight women from around the United States. Each had been successful in various enterprises, including real estate, restaurant management, political consulting, and sales. During the show, the contestants lived communally in a suite on the fourth floor at Trump Tower in Manhattan. Elimination took the form of one contestant being &quot;fired&quot; by Trump at the conclusion of each week&#x27;s episode. Filming the entire season took three months.

The contestants were originally divided into two &quot;corporations&quot; by gender. The men chose to name their company &quot;Versacorp&quot;, and the women chose to name their company &quot;Protégé Corporation&quot;.

Each week, Trump assigned the teams a task. Each team selected a &quot;project manager&quot; to lead them in the week&#x27;s assigned task. The winning team received a reward, while the losing team faced a boardroom showdown with Trump and two of his associates in order to determine which team member would be fired.

Elimination proceeded in two stages. In the first stage, Trump confronted the losing team and required the week&#x27;s project manager to select two additional team members which the project manager believed were most responsible for the loss.

The rest of the team was dismissed (allowed to go back up to the suite, because they were safe to stay for the next round), and the project manager and the two other selected members faced a final confrontation several minutes later in which Trump fired one of the three. Trump is now well known for his catchphrase &quot;You&#x27;re fired!&quot;, and he sought to trademark the phrase in 2004. George Ross and Carolyn Kepcher, executive vice presidents for the Trump Organization, observed the teams during each task, and advised Trump on who needed to be fired each episode during boardroom sessions.

==Candidates==
Both teams, or &quot;corporations&quot;, were divided by their gender.

==Weekly results==
==Elimination table==

: The candidate was on the winning team for this task / they passed the Interviews stage.
: The candidate was on the losing team.

==Weekly summary==

===Week 1: &quot;Meet the Billionaire&quot;===
*Air date: January 8, 2004
*Task: Starting with seed money of $250, purchase supplies and sell lemonade on the streets of New York.
*Judges: Donald Trump; Carolyn Kepcher; George H. Ross
*Monologue: &quot;Location, Location, Location&quot; – Any product sales depends on the location, it has to reach the right target demographic.
*Protégé project manager: Ereka
*Versacorp project manager: Troy
*Winning team: Protégé
**Reasons for win: The women nearly quintupled their money. They stay in Midtown and use the promises of kisses to sell lemonade for five dollars a glass, giving them a total of over $1,200.
**Reward: Visit Donald Trump in his penthouse suite, taking in the pleasures of true fortune.
*Losing team: Versacorp
**Reasons for loss: Versacorp only doubled their money, giving them a total of $500, as they chose a bad location, by the Fulton Fish Market, and priced their lemonade too low. While they eventually found a better location and started selling the lemonade at a slightly higher price, it was far too late to have any hope of recovering the task. In addition, David and Sam proved to be extremely poor salesmen, selling less than $10 between them.
*Dramatic tension: Versacorp member Sam begins to get on the other&#x27;s nerves by his crazy antics, including fruitlessly trying to sell a single glass of lemonade for $1,000, even though he nearly succeeded.
*Sent to boardroom: Troy, Sam, and David
*Fired: David Gould – for selling the least on the team, admitting in the boardroom that sales was not his forte and for not stepping up or taking initiative as Troy and Sam had. Despite criticizing Troy&#x27;s leadership and his decisions along with Sam&#x27;s strange behavior, Trump felt that they had at least showed some initiative, while David had been very passive and otherwise demonstrated no skills that would be of any use to Trump.
*Notes:
**Episode recap from NBC.com
**Though originally 90 minutes long, the repeated airing of the episode was cut to 60 minutes.
**18.5 million people watched this episode&#x27;s initial airing, fulfilling NBC&#x27;s expectations for the much-anticipated premiere. In fact, the series premiere came in 7th place for the week it aired.
**When Versacorp enters the boardroom, Trump is already sitting in his chair. This is the only Apprentice episode ever where Trump arrives in the boardroom before the candidates.
**While Sam&#x27;s attempt to sell a glass of lemonade for $1,000 alienated his team-mates and was a big factor in his being brought back to the boardroom by Troy, such attempts to sell everyday goods for vastly inflated prices would become commonplace in the later &quot;Celebrity Apprentice&quot; editions of the show.
This episode&#x27;s task is introduced at the New York Stock Exchange Building on Wall Street.

===Week 2: &quot;Sex, Lies and Altitude&quot;===
*Air date: January 15, 2004
*Task sponsor: Marquis Jet Card
*Task: Both teams are to design an advertising campaign to sell private jet service, which they must pitch to the owner of the company and Donny Deutsch.
*Judges: Donald Trump; Carolyn Kepcher; George H. Ross
*Monologue: &quot;Do Not Deal With Underlings&quot; – Trump learned early in his career making deals can be tough and you have to work with the boss where ever possible.
*Protégé project manager: Amy
*Versacorp project manager: Jason
*Winning team: Protégé
**Reasons for win: Amy and Ereka personally met with Marquis Jet&#x27;s president and learned that nothing was off limits for their ad. This led to Tammy headlining their campaign with heavy sexual undertones, while depicting parts of the aircraft in black and white artistic shots. The women also pitched their ads while wearing flashy flight attendant outfits.
**Reward: A trip to Boston in a private jet and dinner at a fancy restaurant.
*Losing team: Versacorp
**Reasons for loss: Due to Jason&#x27;s decision not to meet with the president, the men chose to create a conventional campaign, complete with photos of the cockpit and passengers designed to illustrate the utility and convenience of the service. While Donny Deutsch and the Marquis Jet executives felt that the campaign was generally executed competently, they dismissed it as being completely unoriginal.
**Dramatic tension: Sam further aggravates his team members and is excoriated for taking a nap on the floor during the task. This was a negative brought up by both Jason and Trump itself, but was also noted clearly that this was not the reason Versacorp lost the challenge.
**Sent to boardroom: Jason, Sam, and Nick
**Trump&#x27;s Thoughts: Nick strongly defended Jason during the internal review, but was brought back into the final boardroom, in what Trump suspected was an attempt to have Nick advocate for Jason to stay. In any event, the move backfired when Nick angrily demanded to know why he was in the final boardroom, and Jason was unable to justify his decision, lamely telling Nick that it had to be &quot;someone&quot; alongside his clear target Sam. Trump told Sam he&#x27;s been a disaster and no one on his team respects him. In the end, Trump considered Jason&#x27;s failure to meet with the client too fatal an error to be ignored.
*Fired: Jason Curis – for not meeting with the president at the start of the task, which caused the team to lose. Also, Trump did not like the fact that Nick, the &quot;one guy&quot; that defended Jason, was brought back into the boardroom.
*Notes:
**Jason did not see the point of meeting the client for their campaign, while several of his teammates did, and Trump himself was aghast that Jason did not meet with company&#x27;s owner at the beginning and thereby learn that Deutsch and the executives wanted a flashier campaign.
**The women&#x27;s reward became short-lived from a heat of tension that Omarosa instigated with Ereka. After Omarosa called Ereka emotionally unstable, Ereka stated that this was a case of &quot;[the pot] calling the kettle black&quot;, which Omarosa interpreted as racism. After the season ended Omarosa tried to imply that Ereka and another candidate had used even stronger racist insults off-camera, though no evidence of this was ever found during a review of the production tapes. Vetrini has stated that contestants are almost always on camera or being audio-recorded during production, and that such an event, if it occurred, would have been aired to garner ratings.
**This episode is the first time that the project manager has the words &quot;Project Manager&quot; in their name at the bottom of the screen instead of their actual occupation.
**20.2 million people watched this episode&#x27;s initial airing.

===Week 3: &quot;Respect&quot;===
*Air date: January 22, 2004
*Task: The teams are given a scavenger list of items which they are required to purchase during the day at the lowest possible total price.
*Judges: Donald Trump; Carolyn Kepcher; George H. Ross
*Monologue: &quot;The Art of Negotiation&quot; – Buying the right thing at your price, fitting it into the budget.
*Protégé project manager: Jessie
*Versacorp project manager: Sam
**In a &quot;put up or shut up&quot; maneuver, Sam is appointed project manager by the men, as Bill states Sam will either do well and redeem himself or do poorly and get fired. He splits the men into two teams, with him and two others staying back at the suite to perform research by phone and over the web while the &quot;field team&quot; would take that research and use it to make great deals.
*Winning team: Protégé
**Reasons for win: The women also split into two groups, but they had everyone in the field (unlike the men) and each team deployed into a different part of the city. While some of the women attempted to use their sex appeal to seduce the sellers into selling items at a nice discount, Amy was able to find a huge bargain when buying a golf club. They negotiated an average saving of 22% on the list price of their items.
**Reward: Dinner at the 21 Club restaurant.
*Losing team: Versacorp
**Reasons for loss: The men only negotiated an average saving of 9%, largely because they had to carry out most of their deals at the last minute and didn&#x27;t have time to properly negotiate the prices. In addition, Sam&#x27;s obsession with buying the gold first at the expense of other items and his poor research skills (he got a phone number for a store that didn&#x27;t sell golf clubs and then sent them to a store that wasn&#x27;t amenable to bargaining to a lower price) doomed the men.
**Sent to boardroom: Sam, Kwame, and Bowie
*Trump&#x27;s comments: Trump is displeased at the men&#x27;s failure for the third week in a row. In particular, he felt that Sam&#x27;s decision to send his team members away from other tasks to buy the gold bar (which would have a very small discount compared to the other items on the list) was one of the primary reasons the team did not succeed. He also wasn&#x27;t happy about Sam bringing Bowie and Kwame (who were the most critical of Sam, with Kwame bluntly saying he did not respect Sam and needed to be fired if lack of respect for Sam was a sticking point) instead of Nick (who was the nicest to Sam and was also equally responsible for poor research) back into the boardroom. Sam&#x27;s desperate declarations that the team didn&#x27;t respect him, which seemed designed to have Trump aim his anger at the team for being mean to Sam, didn&#x27;t work because Trump saw the disrespect not as bullying but a legitimate reaction to Sam&#x27;s crummy performance as the PM.
*Fired: Sam Solovey – for being in the final boardroom three weeks in a row, being incredibly difficult to work with, having no respect from his team as a leader and not being any good as a follower either, negotiating for the gold bar instead of other items that would have been easier to bargain for, bringing Kwame back instead of Nick and for letting his emotions affect his decision-making. 
*Dramatic tension: Ereka and Omarosa fought in the previous episode, and it continues in this episode, and Katrina stepped in and tried to make them reconcile, unsuccessfully. Amy said it might be worth losing a task at some point to get rid of Omarosa.
*Notes:
**Episode recap from NBC.com
**Sam&#x27;s firing in this episode was named number 96 on TV Guide / TV Land&#x27;s 100 Most Memorable TV Moments in December 2004. Trump says his trademark dismissal quote, &quot;You&#x27;re fired!&quot; three times to Sam, who famously stared for an extended duration of time until Trump further prompts them to leave.

===Week 4: &quot;Ethics Schmethics&quot;===
*Air date: January 29, 2004
*Task sponsors: Planet Hollywood
*Task: The teams are required to collectively manage the Planet Hollywood restaurant in Times Square on successive evenings, with the performance judged by the increase in profits over the same day the previous year.
*Judges: Donald Trump; Carolyn Kepcher; George H. Ross
*Monologue: &quot;A Deal is a Deal&quot; – Once the handshake has been made, it has to be honored.
*Protégé project manager: Katrina
*Versacorp project manager: Kwame
*Dramatic tension: During the women&#x27;s day at Planet Hollywood, Katrina felt saddened that Jessie was frustrated that she wasn&#x27;t leading, which she felt it was misleading. Then after resolving the conflict, the managers from the restaurant were a little upset as they felt women &quot;selling shots&quot; was too much. And warned them that if any of the guests leave the Planet Hollywood and pass out, then they&#x27;re in a liability. The men kept several of their members on the sidewalk hawking coupons and selling basketballs autographed by Kwame, under the assumption that he was a celebrity. Nick strongly disagrees with this ploy and therefore contributed less in the task. His lack of enthusiasm was strongly criticized by the members of his team, as well as Trump. Bill later argued with Troy and Kwame and felt their actions fell into &quot;a grey area&quot;.
*Winning team: Protégé
**Reasons for win: The women (who went first) again used their sexual appeal to increase sales. Heidi identified that focusing on selling liquor would have the largest profit margin, which led to the team earning about $16,000 of profit, increasing the restaurant&#x27;s sales by 31%.
**Reward: Protégé won a trip to a top-notch golf course where they enjoyed the driving range and the course. There, Donald Trump and Carolyn informed the ladies that they have more to show than just their sex appeal and that he would like to see more of that.
*Losing team: Versacorp
**Reasons for loss: Despite having a day more to plan than the women, the men went into the task without any real sales strategy. Only late in the day did they decide to focus on selling merchandise, the profit margin of which paled in comparison to the liquor that the women focused on. They only got $14,000 in profit, only raising the sales by 6%.
**Sent to boardroom: Kwame, Bowie, and Nick
**Trump&#x27;s comments: Increasing alcohol into sales was the goal, which the men missed the mark.
*Fired: Bowie Hogg – for failing to effectively push the merchandise at Planet Hollywood, but also because he did not present himself as a leader to the same extent as the other two candidates in the boardroom. Trump was disappointed in Kwame, but nonetheless allowed him to stay for another task. He was also critical of Nick, but wanted to see him perform as the project manager for the next task.
*Notes:
**Episode recap from NBC.com
**18.9 million people watched this episode&#x27;s initial airing, which came in 6th place for the week.
**While everyone else was overjoyed when Sam was voted out, Nick was disgusted by their reactions and stated that Sam would get vengeance through him.
**This is Versacorp&#x27;s fourth loss in a row. After this episode, Versacorp has lost half of its members within the first four weeks, and therefore the team is now down to four members (Bill, Kwame, Nick, Troy) and has lost four members (David, Jason, Sam, Bowie).

===Week 5: &quot;Trading Places&quot;===
*Air date: February 5, 2004
*Corporate reshuffle: Because the men lost 4 tasks in a row and lost four players, the teams are reorganized, with the names retained but now mixed by sex. For Versacorp, Nick begins by selecting Amy, then takes Bill, Katrina, Ereka and Tammy. For Protégé, Kristi begins by selecting Troy, then takes Jessie, Kwame, Heidi, and Omarosa by default as the last person left.
*Task: Starting with seed money, the teams are required to purchase items and sell them at the greatest profit return at an open-air flea market.
*Judges: Donald Trump; Carolyn Kepcher; Bernie Diamond
*Monologue: &quot;Stand Up for Yourself&quot; – No one else is going to fight for you.
*Protégé project manager: Kristi
*Versacorp project manager: Nick
*Winning team: Versacorp
**Reasons for win: Despite waiting for weather issues of having the location outdoors, they yielded a profit of over $600, whereas Protégé finished in the red. Nick, with help from Katrina, decided to go &quot;dumpster diving&quot; finding objects such as a clothes rack for free.
**Reward: A tour of the Yankee Stadium.
*Losing team: Protégé
**Reasons for loss: Kristi decided on what she called a &quot;divide and conquer&quot; strategy, which involved buying up huge amounts of different items in an attempt to appeal to everyone. However, the strategy ended in disaster when the team was unable to sell enough to overcome their large initial spend. On top of that, $183 in cash also went missing, and its location could not be accounted for, resulting in a net loss of $75.78, though Protégé would have still lost the task (with a profit of just $107.22) even if the missing cash had been found.
**Sent to boardroom: Kristi, Heidi, and Omarosa
*Fired: Kristi Frank – for having questionable leadership qualities, along with the severe failure of her &quot;divide and conquer&quot; plan, bringing Heidi back instead of Jessie and for not making any case as to why she should be allowed to stay.
*Notes:
**Episode recap from NBC.com
**Protégé&#x27;s first loss ends Versacorp&#x27;s 4-week losing streak.
**Donald Trump warns the new teams sex appeal will not cut it in the real world in reorganizing the teams, following up the discussion he had with all-female Protégé in Week 4.
**This episode marks the first time that female candidates were in the final boardroom. Kristi chooses to bring Heidi and Omarosa into the final boardroom, where Kristi becomes the first woman fired on The Apprentice.
**Shortly after the final boardroom began, Trump jokingly implied that he was about to fire Omarosa, who Kristi had blamed for losing the $183. Despite criticizing Heidi for her negativity in the task, Trump also indicated that Kristi should have brought back Jessie instead, as she was behind a lot of the ideas which resulted in the team&#x27;s high expenditure.
**George Ross does not appear in this episode because of a business trip. He is replaced (temporarily) by Bernie Diamond.

===Week 6: &quot;Tit for Tat&quot;===
*Air date: February 12, 2004
*Task: This week&#x27;s task is to raise money for charity at a Sotheby&#x27;s celebrity auction. The teams are told to sign up celebrities for an auction to benefit the Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation. The celebrities that took part in the auction were Regis Philbin, Rocco DiSpirito, Carson Daly, Tiki Barber, Ed Bernero (an Executive Producer of &quot;Third Watch&quot;), Russell Simmons, Kate White (the editor of &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot; magazine), Nicole Miller, the cast of &quot;Queer Eye for the Straight Guy&quot; and Isaac Mizrahi.
*Judges: Donald Trump; Carolyn Kepcher; George H. Ross
*Monologue: – &quot;Know What You&#x27;re Up Against&quot; – In order to compete you must be aware of your competition.
*Protégé project manager: Omarosa
*Versacorp project manager: Bill
*Winning team: Versacorp
**Reasons for win: The team raised $40,000 which included strong returns from packages involving Daly and DiSpirito. Also, Versacorp won because they were able to minimize the numerous gaffes that Tammy made throughout the task.
**Reward: None – as this was a charity event, Trump decided that the feeling of raising money for a charity was reward enough.
*Losing team: Protégé
**Reasons for loss: Protégé did well on balance but did not have the bigger-money items that Versacorp did, losing with a final total of $35,000.
**Sent to boardroom: Omarosa, Heidi, and Jessie
*Fired: Jessie Connors – for being the weakest negotiator on the team and for not defending herself after being harshly criticized by Omarosa.
*Notes:
**Episode recap from NBC.com
**A show-mance began between Nick and Amy.
**Omarosa harshly criticized both Heidi and Jessie, stating she had not found Heidi to be professional or have much class before this event (where she did praise Heidi&#x27;s performance), and calling Jessie an &quot;airhead&quot; and a &quot;bystander.&quot; Donald Trump was disgusted with Omarosa&#x27;s comments, but seemed just as angry that Heidi and Jessie initially said they liked Omarosa after being so strongly insulted, which he found hard to believe. When the trio returned for the final boardroom, Omarosa made even more harsh criticisms of the other two, this time offending Heidi and spurring her into a rather angry self-defense. Jessie on the other hand still refused to say anything bad about Omarosa, which Trump felt showed a fatal lack of strength on her part. Trump told Heidi that she was tougher than Jessie.
**For the second week in a row, Omarosa, Heidi and the woman who would be fired are brought into the final boardroom.

===Week 7: &quot;Dupe-lex&quot;===
*Air date: February 19, 2004
*Task: The teams restore and rent out apartments.
*Judges: Donald Trump; Carolyn Kepcher; Bernie Diamond
*Trump Monologue &quot;God Is In The Details&quot; – Trump believes that customers look at the detail a small flaw such as selling an unwashed used car can cost you a loss for $200 whereas it would only cost $10 to get it washed.
*Protégé project manager: Troy
*Versacorp project manager: Katrina
*Winning team: Protégé
**Reasons for win: Protégé Corporation finally won after leasing their apartment with a 27% rent increase.
**Tension: After the task result was announced, Katrina criticised Troy, accusing him of being out of control and having an unethical personality. After Trump revealed that Troy successfully duped Katrina, the other members of Versacorp agreed with Katrina, but Tammy dissented by saying: &quot;I think we got duped, to be honest.&quot; Trump and the others initially assumed this to be a humorous off-the-cuff remark, but in the initial boardroom Tammy said that she meant what she said which caused outrage among her teammates, especially Katrina and Ereka, and accused Katrina of being a poor negotiator and unable to handle herself in the business world.
**Reward: A trip to Donald Trump&#x27;s mansion in Bedford for a picnic.
*Losing team: Versacorp
**Reasons for loss: Versacorp only gained 10% in the rent. Katrina decided having Bill doing the negotiations of the price in the apartment, but he did not negotiate a better or higher price of the apartment.
**Sent to boardroom: Katrina, Bill, and Tammy
**Initial boardroom: Trump was unimpressed with the lousy efforts Tammy, Katrina, &amp; Bill performed throughout the entire task. While Trump strongly called out Bill for being a lousy negotiator on not negotiating the better price, he ultimately decided he could not hold Bill responsible for the loss given that Katrina only brought in one potential customer. Trump felt that without a doubt Katrina was the most to blame for the team&#x27;s failure, for her shoddy leadership and numerous questionable decisions throughout the task. However, he also felt that she had demonstrated potential on the previous tasks, and that Tammy&#x27;s disloyal remarks and far weaker history than the other two outweighed Katrina&#x27;s mistakes, leading to Tammy&#x27;s firing.
*Fired: Tammy Lee – for her having been generally ineffectual throughout the season, never living up to the early promise shown by her outstanding work on the second task, and for showing her disloyalty by claiming &quot;We&#x27;ve been duped.&quot;
*Notes:
**Ereka, Katrina and Tammy were on the losing team for the first time, breaking their six-week winning streak. It was also the second time the candidates were fired after its winning streak. This also means that Amy is now the only candidate who has won every task to date.
**Heidi finds out her mother has colon cancer. Trump says she can leave the game to be with her mom if she wants, but she says she wants to stay and compete.
**Amy, who was originally reshuffled onto Versacorp, is selected to come back to Protégé Corporation because of the initial 6 vs. 4 deficit.
**Troy and Kwame are finally on a winning team.
**George Ross was absent for unexplained reasons, and Bernie Diamond filled in for the second time this season.
**Omarosa accidentally got hit in her head after the task began from the construction building. She initially shrugged this off, though as the task went on she began to complain about nausea and headaches, and would continue to complain about her &quot;injury&quot; in the tasks that followed.

===Week 8: &quot;Ice Escapades&quot;===
*Air date: February 26, 2004
*Task: Both teams sell bottled water called &quot;Trump Ice&quot; with Donald Trump&#x27;s photo on each bottle.
*Judges: Donald Trump; Carolyn Kepcher; George H. Ross
*Trump Monologue &quot;Beggars Can&#x27;t Be Choosers&quot; – Never beg in front of a customer, you have to sell a product to an interested customer, begging a customer to buy something will not get you a good deal.
*Protégé project manager: Heidi
*Versacorp project manager: Ereka
*Winning team: Protégé
**Reasons for win: They sold over $6,000 worth of water. Troy devised a plan where the Trump Ice could be purchased in bunches over a period of several weeks, thus allowing businesses with limited storage space to not be swamped with too much product, thus securing large sales.
**Reward: A helicopter tour of New York City in Mr. Trump&#x27;s private chopper.
*Losing team: Versacorp
**Reasons for loss: Nick did poorly as a salesperson, claiming that he would be a superstar at selling the water, then delivering poor results. Also, Ereka&#x27;s leadership was sorely lacking giving little direction and strategy. They only sold over $4,000 worth of water, $2,000 less than Protégé.
**Sent to boardroom: Ereka, Bill, and Nick
*Fired: Ereka Vetrini – for letting her emotions influence her decision-making, bringing Bill back instead of Katrina and for not having a strong defence when Nick and Bill jointly listed her deficiencies as a leader.
*Notes:
**Episode recap from NBC.com
**20.0 million people watched this episode&#x27;s initial airing. Despite the big numbers, the instalment came in at No. 11 on the weekly charts.
**Ereka made the fatal mistake of letting her friend, Katrina, go back up to the suite and fight in the boardroom against Nick, incorrectly believing that Bill would support her in this decision. While George wanted to dismiss Ereka, Carolyn preferred to fire Nick. Ereka also lost her temper during the argument against Bill and Nick, which did not help her case against getting fired.
**This is the first task of the season (and the series) where both project managers were of the same sex.
**In Ereka&#x27;s exit interview she called Bill a chicken for defending Nick.

===Week 9: &quot;DNA, Heads and the Undead Kitty&quot;===
*Air date: March 4, 2004
*Task: This week&#x27;s task is to pick one artist from an array of controversial and strange painters, sculptors, and other kinds of artists. Then they must sell this art in a showing at a gallery. Protégé picks a surrealist artist named Meghan Boody, while Versacorp sticks with a more mainstream artist named Andrei Petrov, who specializes in abstract paintings.
*Judges: Donald Trump; Carolyn Kepcher; George H. Ross
*Trump Monologue: &quot;You&#x27;ve Gotta Believe&quot; – A seller has to have faith in what is being sold.
*Protégé project manager: Kwame
*Versacorp project manager: Nick
*Task tension: On Protege, Heidi butted heads with Omarosa when Omarosa said she was hungry and then demanded they have a sit-down lunch, while Heidi wanted to get take-out sandwiches and eat the food while they were working. Omarosa once again claimed her head was badly injured, and Heidi lost her patience and used expletives while screaming how sick she was of dealing with Omarosa.
*Winning team: Versacorp
**Reasons for win: Versacorp sold 8 pieces for $13,600, blowing Protégé out of the water. Nick made an executive decision for his deadlocked team to go with an artist whose work was a smash hit at the gallery.
**Rewards: Nick is awarded with 10 minutes alone with Mr. Trump, talking about the tricks of the trade. Trump told Nick that &quot;even when you weren&#x27;t, in theory, doing well, I thought you were doing well.&quot;
*Losing team: Protégé; they had only sold one piece with only $869 in sales.
**Reasons for loss: Protégé chose an artist with a bizarre body of work that the gallery patrons did not like. Members of Protégé did not even like the artwork themselves, and were therefore unable to sell any of their pieces with conviction. They also apparently were unable to connect with Meghan&#x27;s fanbase and get them to come to the show and buy her art.
**Sent to boardroom: Kwame, Heidi, and Omarosa
*Fired: Omarosa Stallworth - for making too many excuses for herself, being difficult to work with, inability to take responsibility for her failures, and not delivering on her promises. While this was the second time Kwame had led his team to a crushing defeat, and Trump noted that Heidi was driving people &quot;a little nuts&quot;, Trump considered Omarosa too much of a loose cannon to be given any more chances.
*Notes:
**Episode recap from NBC.com
**Omarosa breaks down after a highly emotional boardroom because of her alleged &quot;concussion&quot;.
**Nick chooses Amy to come to his side, Versacorp, for this task. Trump half-jokingly says that with Amy always being chosen to join new teams so often, maybe he should hire her right away.
**Midway through Trump&#x27;s discussion with Carolyn and George, Omarosa walks in and complains. This marks the first time a candidate has interrupted Trump and his viceroys midway through a discussion. When she heads out to dry her teary eyes, Heidi remains at the table and makes a sarcastic expression that leads to a sardonic grin from Trump.
**This was the fifth consecutive week that a woman was fired, and the number of men remaining is now greater than the women.

===Week 10: &quot;Wheeling and Dealing&quot;===
*Air date: March 11, 2004
*Task: The teams take over a pedicab shift. Protégé Corporation sells prepaid punch cards, modeled after Troy&#x27;s phased-sales plan that was the winner on the Trump Ice task. Versacorp sells advertising on the rickshaws that they ride. Amy uses previous contacts made in the game to quickly amass a large amount of advertising commitments. Kwame spends much of the afternoon as a driver but without being able to land a single fare. After one of the ads (for a restaurant) is found to have fallen off one of Versacorp&#x27;s pedicabs, Nick irritated his teammates by going back to the restaurant owner and returning the full amount paid. When Troy sees Versacorp&#x27;s pedicab advertising, he realizes Protégé is sunk and in a rare moment of humility states, &quot;It was a great idea. I didn&#x27;t come up with it.&quot; With Protégé&#x27;s victory disappearing into thin air, Heidi begins swearing under her breath at passersby when she is unable to convince them to buy rides.
*Judges: Donald Trump; Carolyn Kepcher; George H. Ross
*Trump Monologue &quot;Think OutSide The Box&quot; – Do not stick with the tried and tested and make room for creativity and innovation.
*Protégé project manager: Troy
*Versacorp project manager: Bill
*Winning team: Versacorp
**Reasons for win: Amy had the bold idea of selling ads to put on their Pedicabs (inspired by NASCAR) and as a result raised $3,680.
**Rewards: A ride around Manhattan on a yacht named Calypso.
*Losing team: Protégé
**Reasons for loss: Protégé&#x27;s sales ideas could not match the ad revenue Versacorp brought in. They only got $382.68 in sales.
**Sent to boardroom: Troy and Heidi
*Fired: Heidi Bressler – Trump personally liked her (something Kwame noted before the Boardroom and Trump said himself post-firing) but felt she hadn&#x27;t stepped up as a leader and was not contributing enough as a follower. Carolyn called out Heidi for under-performing, later interviewing that she was trying to get Heidi to defend herself.
*Notes:
**Episode recap from NBC.com
**There are ethical battles and morale-boosting schemes.
**A new rule is imposed in this episode: when a team is down to 3 members, the Project Manager sends 1 person up to the suite, and goes into the final boardroom with the other.
**One of Versacorp&#x27;s ads was Marquis Jets, which both teams worked with in episode 2.

===Week 11: &quot;A Look Back&quot;===
*Air date: March 18, 2004
*Notes:
*Recap of first ten weeks, along with previously unaired footage.
*Among other new scenes: the men respond to their first two losses by having an amusing awkward visit to a spa that includes Troy painfully getting a leg waxing; Omarosa and Ereka&#x27;s week two reward argument includes Omarosa&#x27;s insinuation (later proven false) that Ereka made racist comments; Sam amuses the guys when he calls his dad for a pep talk after his week three PM loss and does not get any specifically useful information; and Nick and Bill have dinner the night before the week eight Boardroom where they agree to back each other up if Ereka targets either of them instead of Katrina to be fired by Trump.
*No new task, no firing.
*This episode was added because NBC did not want the show to compete against CBS&#x27; coverage of the NCAA Men&#x27;s Division I Basketball Championship first-round games, knowing how the ratings of the tournament, would be too hard to compete against because of the heavily regionalised coverage of the tournament. Likewise, Mark Burnett Productions refuses to let The Apprentice compete head-to-head against CBS&#x27; Survivor, which is also a Mark Burnett production.
*One particularly humorous outtake was the one featuring Omarosa calling in the doctor to get advice on her &quot;terrible head injury&quot;. When the doctor said it was nothing serious, she was not satisfied, and proceeded to check into the hospital.

===Week 12: &quot;Circus, Circus&quot;===
*Air date: March 25, 2004
*&quot;Corporate Reshuffle&quot;: Protégé Corporation is down to two candidates against four on Versacorp. As in the past when the teams have become overly uneven, Trump has the smaller team choose a player from the winning team. Kwame and Troy select Bill, breaking with the &quot;tradition&quot; of picking Amy, as Troy said she had already received enough kudos. Versacorp now consists of Amy, Katrina and Nick.
*Task: The teams head to Atlantic City, New Jersey where they will be responsible for registering gamblers at the Trump Taj Mahal Resort and Casino, and coming up with a promotion to incentivise them to stay at the casino to maximise the money they spent. The team whose registered gamblers wager the most money wins. Protégé&#x27;s priority was to get the people to gamble as much as possible, rather than to attract as many gamblers as possible. In a bid to get people to stay, Protégé decided to raffle off $1,000 cash late in the evening. Versacorp also raffled off a prize at the end of the night where the lucky winner could either have a drive in an expensive sports car or collect $300; this prize however was far less effective of making the people stay. Protégé then decided to send in a caged tiger where the people gambling for Versacorp were to distract them from gambling. At the end of the night, Protégé attracted significantly fewer gamblers than Versacorp (776 vs 1,337), but crucially those gamblers of Protégé wagered on average double the amount of their rivals ($159 vs $79 per person).
*Judges: Donald Trump; Carolyn Kepcher; Mark Brown
*Trump Monologue &quot;It&#x27;s Easier To Think Big&quot; – A personal reflection of Trump on how it has been always practical for Trump to take the next step.
*Protégé project manager: Kwame
*Versacorp project manager: Amy
*Winning team: Protégé
**Reasons for win: Protégé is able to earn $123,159, thanks to Bill&#x27;s plan to target high rollers (VIPs).
**Reward: Protégé stayed overnight at the best suite in The Trump Taj Mahal with $3000 in gambling money.
*Losing team: Versacorp
**Reasons for loss: At the end of the task, Versacorp takes in $105,362. At some point, Amy did something that took people off the floor and hurt Versacorp&#x27;s numbers, but no specifics were given.
*Sent to boardroom: Amy and Katrina
*Fired: Katrina Campins – for a lack of contributions to the task and in the process overall by comparison to the other members of the team. This was the first task where Amy lost, and despite both her and Katrina making a significant number of mistakes between them during this task, Trump ultimately decided that he could not fire Amy given her past successes.
*Notes:
**Episode recap from NBC.com
**This is the first time Amy has been on a losing team, breaking her ten-week streak. She currently holds the record for longest time ever without losing a challenge.
**Bill is not happy to be chosen by Kwame to join Protégé, saying that he is not a fan of Troy and does not respect the way he does business. In the Season 1 DVD, Bill refers to his new teammates as &quot;Dumb and Dumber&quot;. The DVD extra includes a music video.
**George Ross does not appear in this episode. Mark Brown replaces him while he is away.
**Katrina tried to use her sexuality to convince the Chrysler executive into letting them auction off the Chrysler Crossfire.
**22.8 million people watched this episode&#x27;s initial airing, rebounding from last week and building upon the recap episode by five million viewers, pushing it far enough to take second place for the week.
**This week&#x27;s winning team configuration (Bill, Kwame, Troy) is the only one to both win a task and lose a task. Every prior winning team configuration won multiple tasks until being modified by a corporate reshuffle, and the following task&#x27;s winning team configuration (Nick, Amy) only competed once in that form due to the end of the team tasks.

===Week 13: &quot;The Price is Height&quot;===
*Air date: April 1, 2004
*Task: This week&#x27;s task is to rent out a luxurious penthouse for one evening at Trump World Tower for no less than $20,000 for one night.
*Judges: Donald Trump; Carolyn Kepcher; Bernie Diamond
*Protégé project manager: Troy
*Versacorp project manager: Nick
*Trump Monologue &quot;Passion&quot; – If you don&#x27;t have passion for what you&#x27;re doing, you won&#x27;t be successful.
*Winning team: Versacorp
**Reasons for win: Versacorp took in $40,800 for the win, thanks to a deal at the very last minute.
**Reward: A flight and lunch to Trump&#x27;s Mar-a-Lago private club in Palm Beach, Florida. Amy&#x27;s sister and Nick&#x27;s father surprised them on the plane.
*Losing team: Protégé
**Reasons for loss: Protégé took in $35,001. Troy&#x27;s sales style annoyed one prospective customer who walked away from the penthouse.
**Sent to boardroom: Troy and Kwame
**Firing verdict: During the boardroom, Bill, Kwame, and Troy were asked about their education. Troy only held a high school diploma, while Kwame held a Master&#x27;s degree from Harvard, and Bill has a college degree from Loyola University, both schools Trump knew well. Troy would fire Kwame, so Bill was not nominated for the final Boardroom. Troy and Kwame would face the final wrath of Trump after Trump took time to review the performance of the Boardroom Nominees.
*Fired: Troy McClain – for sometimes using unethical business practices throughout the duration of the interview process, horrible Project Manager Record of 1–3, and partly due to lacking the education of the other two contestants. Although Kwame was spared, and this was Troy&#x27;s third failure as project manager, Trump actually felt Troy was more of a leader than Kwame, but it was Kwame&#x27;s education that spared him from getting the axe.
*Notes:
**Episode recap from NBC.com
**20.2 million people watched this episode&#x27;s initial airing, just edging into the top five for the week.
**This was the first time in eight weeks that a man was fired.
**George Ross was away on a business trip, and was filled in for by Bernie Diamond once again. This was Bernie&#x27;s third and final appearance as a boardroom judge, though he continued to make occasional cameo appearances (mostly in the &quot;Trump&#x27;s Lesson&quot; montages) throughout the following seasons.
**After their loss, the men of Protege went out to dinner and &quot;ordered like kings&quot;, having a nice and ultimately respectful evening in which they got along better than they previously had. Kwame tells them that the competition will be won by one of them, which ends up being true.

===Week 14: &quot;Down to The Wire&quot;===

====Semifinal====
*Air date: April 8
*Task: Face an interview with four of Trump&#x27;s executives. Two people will be fired.
*Fired:
**Nick Warnock – for not gaining the respect of his peers and for lacking leadership, despite an impeccable record as project manager (3–0) and being a respected sales representative. In addition to a general agreement among the executives, all three remaining candidates unanimously recommended that Trump should fire him.
**Amy Henry – for not earning the respect of Trump&#x27;s executives. Although she had a near perfect team record (losing only one of the twelve tasks), the executives did not like her whatsoever, and one of them even remarked that &quot;she reminded me of a stepford wife&quot;.

====Final====
*Trump Monologue &quot;Dog Does Not Eat Dog&quot; – Surround yourself with those loyal to you. Don&#x27;t give the disloyal a second chance.
*Finalists: Bill Rancic and Kwame Jackson
*Teams:
**Protégé: Kwame, Heidi, Omarosa, and Troy
**Versacorp: Bill, Amy, Katrina, and Nick
*Tasks:
**Protégé: Manage a Jessica Simpson concert at the Trump Taj Mahal in Atlantic City, New Jersey
**Versacorp: Manage a golf tournament at Trump National Golf Club Westchester in Briarcliff Manor, New York
*Judges: Donald Trump; Carolyn Kepcher; George H. Ross
*Notes:
**Amy&#x27;s firing marks the end of the original team Protégé, as both finalist are from the same team (Versacorp).
**Bill Rancic was only 5–7 (with a 2–0 Project Manager Record) and Kwame Jackson was 3–9 (1–2 as Project Manager) in the 13 weeks. It is the only time in Apprentice history where the final two each had a losing record in all of the episodes throughout the season, because of all of the switching of members of teams (plus the men&#x27;s four-week losing streak at the start of the season).
**Omarosa does not fulfill her duties, and Jessica Simpson ends up being lost. Kwame&#x27;s uncertainty about how to deal with her led to confusion about whether he could have fired her. During the season-three finale, George Ross clarified this point, saying that the project managers could use their employees in &quot;any&quot; way they wanted, a situation where Kwame would have been free to fire Omarosa from the task.
**A mix-up involving a coin flip for which final tasks Bill and Kwame would take (which Bill won) led to Bill also having the #1 overall pick from the group of six fired contestants who returned to be tasked to a finalist&#x27;s mission. Kwame selected Omarosa as his 2nd team member (after Troy) because Bill had already drafted Amy and Katrina and made it clear he would NOT have Omarosa on his team. Kwame also did not want Nick on his team—and knew that Bill would draft his friend and former teammate Nick with his last choice anyway—and chose Omarosa instead of Heidi because he felt Heidi would work hard as the last person standing and Omarosa was unlikely to do that if she was angry.
**Episode recap from NBC.com

===Week 15: &quot;Season Finale&quot;===
*Air Date: April 15
*Jessica Simpson booked her own transportation, without informing Kwame, and arrived at the hotel safely with her band. At the golf tournament, Bill lost track of some of the inventory.
*Omarosa broke orders and took Jessica Simpson away when she was supposed to meet with Donald Trump. Trump gets impatient as Kwame is unable to locate Ms. Simpson.
*Omarosa continues to make attacks concerning Kwame&#x27;s handling of the Jessica Simpson concert.
*Both tasks are successful. Trump introduced Simpson at her concert, and donated $25,000 to Operation Smile, an organization which Simpson sponsors.
*Trump&#x27;s comments: Trump was aghast when he found out that Kwame did not fire Omarosa for excessive false testimony and felt that his explanations for not dismissing her were unsatisfactory.
*Fired: Kwame Jackson – for his inability to control Omarosa and her insubordination on several occasions throughout the concert.
*Hired: Bill Rancic – because Trump thought Bill did a very good job and Carolyn had nothing but positive comments about him. He gets to choose from two jobs, and has only three minutes to decide. He selects the project of overseeing the building of Trump International Hotel and Tower in Chicago, Illinois, on the site of the present Chicago Sun-Times Building. The other option he had was to oversee and manage a new Trump National Golf Course and resort in Los Angeles.
*Part of this episode is taped at the same time as the &quot;&quot;&#x27; second season premiere. Only footage with Donald Trump introducing Jessica at the concert is seen, as footage featuring Kwame and his team had to be removed so there would be no spoilers prior to the airing of &quot;The Apprentice&quot;.
*Kwame said during the task he would have fired Omarosa from the task for her incompetence but didn&#x27;t think he had the option of doing so, and did not simply sideline her because he would have overstretched himself, Troy and Heidi with the many tasks involved in his event. In season three, George Ross issued a long-sought clarification that the final two contestants were free to handle their teams any way they saw fit, including firing them or giving them nothing to do if necessary.

<text>Terence Rogers Tiller (19 September 1916 – 24 December 1987) was an English poet and radio producer.

==Early life, poet==
Tiller was born in Truro, Cornwall and educated at Latymer Upper School in Hammersmith. He studied history at Jesus College, Cambridge, where he graduated with a starred first-class BA degree in 1937 and won the Chancellor&#x27;s Medal for English Verse. He then lectured in medieval history at Cambridge from 1937 to 1939. But then, just before the war, he accepted an academic position in Cairo, where he remained stranded. For the next six years he taught English literature at what was then the King Fuad I University. 

While there he became associated with the Personal Landscape group of poets that also included Keith Douglas, Lawrence Durrell, Robin Fedden and Bernard Spencer. His enigmatic poems about wartime Egypt, showing the influence of Wilfred Owen, gained attention through the publication of his &quot;Poems&quot; in 1941, followed by &quot;The Inward Animal&quot; in 1943. His most acclaimed poetry collection was &quot;Unarm, Eros&quot; (1947), containing poems of “strong formal pattern, heraldic imagery, and striking sensuousness”.

==BBC==
In 1946 he joined the BBC Features Department, where he was responsible for hundreds of plays and feature broadcasts on a wide range of subjects, but mainly on history, literature and mythology. His contemporaries in the department included fellow poets Rayner Heppenstall, Louis MacNeice and W R Rodgers. During this period, Tiller became a noted Fitzrovian. He collaborated with the composer Elizabeth Poston on features such as &quot;The Shepherds&#x27; Play&quot; (1947), &quot;The Death of Adam&quot; (1949), &quot;Lilith&quot; (1950), and &quot;The Holy Child&quot; (1952). In 1955 he adapted and produced the first BBC radio series of J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; (which did not please the author). He adapted and modernized Chaucer&#x27;s &quot;The Parlement of Foules&quot; in 1958.

In 1964 he moved to the Drama Department. His work on the weekly chess programme on the Third Programme led to his book &quot;Chess Treasury of the Air&quot; in 1966. In 1969 he completed the posthumous story &quot;After Ten Years&quot; by C. S. Lewis for broadcast, and in 1973 he brought Mervyn Peake&#x27;s &quot;The Rhyme of the Flying Bomb&quot; to the airwaves.

Tiller retired from the BBC in 1976, but continued working on some projects. In 1979 he dramatized Vladimir Nabokov&#x27;s novel &quot;The Defence&quot;.

<text>This is a list of the extreme points and extreme elevations in Russia.

The northernmost and easternmost points of Russia coincide with those of Eurasia (both for the mainland and including the islands).

The extreme points of the Soviet Union were identical, except that the southernmost point of the Soviet Union was Kushka in Turkmenistan, and the extreme elevation was the Communism Peak in Tajikistan, at . The other extreme points of Russia are the same as those of the Soviet Union.

From 1799 until 1867 the easternmost point of the Russian Empire was located in North America, on the border between Russian Alaska and British North America, which superimposed on the then International Date Line. The westernmost point of the Empire was located at Ruda Komorska in Congress Poland from 1815 until its occupation by German and Austro-Hungarian troops in 1915. Kushka in present-day Turkmenistan had been the southernmost point of the Empire since 1885. Again, until the Alaska Purchase, the peak of Bolshaya was the extreme point of elevation in the Empire, at 6,194 m above sea level.

<doc id="907471" wikidata="Q4038378" url="?curid=907471" title="Evan Williams (bourbon)">
<text>Evan Williams is a brand of Kentucky straight bourbon whiskey bottled in Bardstown, Kentucky, by the Heaven Hill company. The product is aged for a minimum of four years (which is more than the two year minimum to be called &#x27;straight&#x27; bourbon, but is the minimum requirement for a straight whiskey that does not have an age statement on the label). It has been ranked as one of the world&#x27;s best selling whiskey brands.

Their product line includes flavored variations, about which The New York Times, citing Nielsen&#x27;s data, wrote &quot;now represent 3 percent of the $1.4 billion whiskey category.&quot;

==Production==
Although bottled in Bardstown, the product is distilled at the Heaven Hill distillery in Louisville, Kentucky.

The &quot;standard issue&quot; Evan Williams bourbon is sold as the mass-market &quot;Black Label&quot; variety. The company also bottles several other varieties, including a &quot;White Label&quot; that is bottled in bond, an &quot;Evan Williams 1783&quot; bourbon that is produced in more limited quantities, and a 7–8 year old single barrel bourbon sold in vintage-dated bottles sealed with black wax. Occasionally available in some regions is a &quot;Green Label&quot; variety that is 80 proof and represents a younger, lighter-bodied version of the bourbon found in &quot;Black Label&quot; bottles at a more affordable price.

As of 2010, Evan Williams was the second largest-selling brand of Kentucky straight bourbon (following the market-leading Jim Beam brand) and had the fastest-growing market share among the top-volume American whiskey brands (with a 12.4% sales growth rate), according to a press release issued by the producer citing A.C. Nielsen Scantrack 2010 data.

Evan Williams Black is 43% alc/vol (86 U.S. proof), unlike some popular whiskeys which are bottled at the statutory minimum of 40% alc/vol (80 proof).

==Origin of the name==

Evan Williams, a Welsh immigrant to North America, was born in Dale, Pembrokeshire, and emigrated to the United States towards the end of the 18th century. Williams settled in Kentucky and began distilling in 1783, in what is now Louisville, Kentucky. A historical marker in Louisville marks the site as Kentucky&#x27;s first commercial distillery. Williams was elected to serve as the first wharf master of Louisville in 1797.

The bottle label of the best-selling variant, the black label, emphasizes this heritage — it bears the inscriptions &quot;Since 1783&quot; and &quot;Kentucky&#x27;s 1st distiller&quot;. However, the inscriptions should not be construed as indicating that the brand has continuously existed since the time of the historic distillery. The modern whiskey brand was introduced by the Heaven Hill company in 1957.
Historian Michael Veach of the Filson Historical Society has stated that key details of the historical claims about Williams appear to be false. Veach said that the assertion that Williams was Kentucky&#x27;s first distiller did not appear until an 1892 publication by Reuben Durrett, more than a century after the fact. He also said that the dating is disproved by a record of Williams traveling from London to Philadelphia in May 1794, showing that Williams could only have begun his distillery substantially later. Veach indicated that the true identity of Kentucky&#x27;s first distiller may never really be known, since record-keeping about such matters was poor, and there are others that seem more likely as candidates for &quot;first distiller&quot;, including Jacob Myers and the brothers Joseph and Samuel Davis. Records reportedly indicate that Myers and the Davis brothers both arrived in 1779.

The New York Times wrote that &quot;popular brands such as Elijah Craig and Evan Williams were actually created by Jewish distillers adept in marketing.&quot; The Shapira brothers were co-founders of Heaven Hill, the company that acquired &quot;Evan Williams;&quot; Max Shapira and other descendants are the company&#x27;s owners and continue to operate it. The name &quot;Evan Williams&quot; was patented in the 1960s.

==Varieties==
Varieties of whiskey using the Evan Williams brand name include the following:
* Evan Williams Green Label, 80 proof
* Evan Williams White Label, 100 proof (bottled in bond)
* Evan Williams Black Label, 86 proof, designated as 7-year aged prior to dropping this designation in the early 2000s

* Evan Williams 1783, 86 proof, designated as 10-year aged prior to dropping this designation in the early 2000s
* Evan Williams 12 Year Red Label, 101 proof
* Evan Williams 23 year old blue label, 107 proof
Several liqueurs are also produced under the Evan Williams brand, including:

* Evan Williams Honey Reserve, 70 proof, introduced in 2009
* Evan Williams Cherry Reserve, 70 proof, introduced in 2010
* Evan Williams Kentucky Cider, 34 proof

==Evan Williams Bourbon Experience==

The whiskey and its history are featured in the &quot;Evan Williams Bourbon Experience&quot;, a tourist attraction in Louisville that is part of the Kentucky Bourbon Trail.

==Awards, reviews and sponsorships==
On February 16, 2011, the &quot;Black Label&quot; expression tied with 100 proof Very Old Barton as &quot;Best Buy Whisk(e)y of the Year&quot; in the 17th Annual Malt Advocate Whiskey Awards.

The company sponsors sporting events and tournaments.

<text>Heaven Hill Distilleries, Inc. is a private family-owned and -operated American distillery, founded in 1935 and headquartered in Bardstown, Kentucky, that produces and markets the Heaven Hill brand of Kentucky Straight Bourbon Whiskey and a variety of other distilled spirits. 

Its current distillery facility, called the Heaven Hill Bernheim distillery, is in Louisville, Kentucky. It is the seventh-largest alcohol supplier in the United States, the second-largest holder of bourbon whiskey inventory in the world, the largest independent family-owned and -operated producer and marketer of distilled spirits in the United States, and the only large family-owned distillery company headquartered in Kentucky (not counting Brown-Forman Corporation, which is publicly traded but more than two-thirds family-controlled; or Sazerac Company, which is family-owned but headquartered in Louisiana).

==History==
Heaven Hill was founded by several investors shortly after the repeal of Prohibition in 1935, including a prominent distiller, Joseph L. Beam, and a member of the Shapira family. As the company developed, the five brothers of the Shapira family bought out the other investors. Joe Beam remained as Master Distiller, along with his youngest son, Harry. Descendants of the Shapira brothers own and operate the company today.

All of the Master Distillers at Heaven Hill since its founding have been members of the Beam family. The original Master Distiller was Joseph L. Beam, Jim Beam&#x27;s first cousin. He was followed by his son, Harry, who was followed by Earl Beam, the son of Jim Beam&#x27;s brother, Park. Earl Beam was succeeded by the current Master Distillers, Parker Beam and his son, Craig Beam.

The original name was &quot;Old Heavenhill Springs&quot; distillery. The company was founded as a bourbon distillery, with a model focused on providing bulk whiskey for third parties on a basis of futures (a buyer would purchase fresh whiskey, to be held in Heaven Hill&#x27;s warehouses until the buyer paid the government tax to have it released). It also focused on its flagship bourbon labels, Evan Williams and Elijah Craig. In the past two decades the company has expanded its portfolio, acquiring brands or obtaining import rights for gins, malt whiskey, vodkas, and other drinks.

On November 7, 1996, Heaven Hill&#x27;s production plant (registered plant DSP-KY-31) was almost completely destroyed by fire. The fire started in an aging warehouse and spread to other buildings and vehicles. 90,000 barrels (approximately 7.7 million gallons) of flammable bourbon were consumed. A &quot;river of fire&quot; flowed from the warehouses. From one account of the fire: &quot;Flames leapt hundreds of feet into the air and lit the sky throughout the night. Witnesses reported seeing whiskey barrels explode and rocket across the sky like shooting stars ... a two-mile long stretch of the creek that supplied process water to the distillery was set ablaze for a brief time.&quot;

The company survived the next several years through the provision of production capacity by its fellow local bourbon labels, Brown–Forman and Jim Beam, until its purchase and adaptation of the Bernheim distillery in Louisville (registered plant DSP-KY-1) from Diageo in 1999. While fermenting, mashing, and distilling occurs at the new distillery, aging, bottling, and shipping still occur in Bardstown.

With the 2003 acquisition of distribution rights to Hpnotiq, Heaven Hill greatly expanded their product base beyond bourbon. Hpnotiq is now the fourth-highest-selling imported liqueur in the US. While bourbon is still its main focus, Heaven Hill now distributes a wide variety of different products.

The Heaven Hill company strongly emphasizes the history and traditions of bourbon in its public relations, highlighting the company&#x27;s location in the historical home of bourbon-making and its status as the only such company still under local ownership. In 2004, the Heaven Hill Distilleries Bourbon Heritage Center was opened on the old distillery grounds, providing historical exhibits and guided tours of the plant. The company also hosts the annual Kentucky Bourbon Festival, and several of the company&#x27;s brands are named after famous local distillers.

Since 2010, Heaven Hill has invested more than $100m in distillery expansions, warehouse construction, and bourbon tourism. In November 2018, Heaven Hill announced a $65m multi-year investment into expanding operations, which includes a renovation of the Bourbon Heritage Center.

In September 2021, about 420 workers, all members of the United Food and Commercial Workers union, went on strike due to disagreements over the terms of a new labor contract.

In February 2022, Heaven Hill acquired Samson &amp; Surrey, the owner of Widow Jane and Few.

In 2023, Heaven Hill Brands settled a legal dispute with Log Still Distillery over Log Still&#x27;s use of the &quot;J.W. Dant&quot; name. Heaven Hill had originally purchased the trademark in 1993, and had sued Log Still for trademark infringement in 2021, after the distillery claimed on its website that it was &quot;reviving the Dant legacy&quot;.

==Production process==
Heaven Hill Bourbon is made from a mash composed of 78% corn, 10% rye, and 12% malted barley. The barrels used for aging have a #3 char. Prior to bottling, the whiskey is chill filtered through charcoal at .

<text>Dziady ( &quot;grandfathers, eldfathers&quot;, sometimes translated as Forefathers&#x27; Eve) is a term in Slavic folklore for the spirits of the ancestors and a collection of pre-Christian rites, rituals and customs that were dedicated to them. The essence of these rituals was the &quot;communion of the living with the dead&quot;, namely, the establishment of relationships with the souls of the ancestors, periodically returning to their headquarters from the times of their lives. The aim of the ritual activities was to win the favor of the deceased, who were considered to be caretakers in the sphere of fertility. The name &quot;dziady&quot; was used in particular dialects mainly in Belarus, Poland, Polesia, Russia, and Ukraine (sometimes also in border areas, e.g. Podlachia, Smoleńsk Oblast, Aukštaitija), but under different other names (&quot;pomynky&quot;, &quot;przewody&quot;, &quot;radonitsa&quot;, &quot;zaduszki&quot;) there were very similar ritual practices, common among Slavs and Balts, and also in many European and even non-European cultures.

== Etymology ==
In the context of the pagan holiday of the dead, the most popular name is &quot;dziady&quot;. The word &quot;dziad&quot; comes from the Proto-Slavic word &quot;*dědъ&quot; (pl. &quot;*dědi&quot;) meaning primarily &quot;grandfather&quot;, &quot;an old man with an honorable position in the family&quot;, &quot;ancestor&quot; and &quot;old man&quot;. The second meaning is &quot;spirit, demon&quot; (compare Polish &quot;dziadzi&quot; (adjective) considered a euphemism from &quot;diabli&quot; (adjective of &quot;devil&quot;), Kashubian. &quot;dżôd&quot; &quot;evil spirit, which threaten children, domestic spirit&quot;, Czech &quot;děd&quot; &quot;domestic deity&quot;, Russian &quot;died&quot; (dialect) „chort, domestic spirit&quot;, Pskov, Smolensk: &quot;diedý&quot; (pl.) &quot;ritual to honor the dead&quot;, Ukrainian &quot;didý&quot; (pl.) &quot;shadows in the corners of the room (at dusk)&quot; (colloquially), &quot;a day of remembrance of the dead, All Souls&#x27; Day&quot;, Belarusian &quot;dzied&quot;, &quot;dziadý&quot; (pl.) &quot;ritual to honor the dead, a day of remembrance of the dead, All Souls&#x27; Day&quot;). Related words are associated with the second meaning, i.e. Proto-Slavic &quot;*dedъka&quot;: Russian &quot;diedka&quot; (dialect) &quot;devil, chort, domestic spirit&quot;, &quot;diedia&quot; &quot;devil&quot; (e.g. &quot;lesnoj diedia&quot; &quot;forest devil&quot;), Proto-Slavic &quot;*dedъko&quot;: Russian &quot;diedko&quot; &quot;chort, domestic spirit&quot;, Slovak &quot;dedkovia&quot; (pl.) &quot;domestic deities, souls of the ancestors, guardian spirits of the house&quot;, Ukrainian &quot;didko&quot; &quot;chort, devil, impure/evil power&quot; or Proto-Slavic &quot;*dědъkъ&quot;: Lower Sorbian &quot;źědki&quot; (pl.) &quot;gnomes&quot;, Czech &quot;dedek&quot; &quot;domestic deity&quot;.

== Dates ==
In the Slavic tradition, depending on the region, the feast of the deceased was celebrated at least twice a year. The main dziady were the so-called &quot;spring dziady&quot; and &quot;autumn dziady&quot;:
* Spring dziady were celebrated around 1 and 2 May (depending on lunar phase)
* Autumn dziady were celebrated on the night from October 31 to November 1, also known as All Saints Day, which was a preparation for the autumn day of the dead, celebrated around November 2.(depending on lunar phase)

== Rituals of the dziady ==

Within the framework of grandfather&#x27;s rituals, the souls coming to &quot;this world&quot; had to be hosted in order to secure their favour and at the same time help them to achieve peace in the hereafter. The basic ritual form was feeding and watering of souls (e.g. honey, groats, eggs, forge and vodka) during special feasts prepared in houses or cemeteries (directly on graves). A characteristic feature of these feasts was that the people who ate them dropped or poured some of their food and drinks on the table, floor or grave for the souls of the deceased. In some areas, however, the ancestors also had to be given the opportunity to bathe (a sauna was prepared for this) and warm up. This last condition was fulfilled by lighting fires, whose function is sometimes explained differently. They were supposed to light the way for wandering souls so that they would not get lost and could spend the night with their loved ones. The remnants of this custom are contemporary candles lit on graves. However, fire – especially the one kindled on crossroads – could also have had another meaning. The idea was to prevent demons (souls of people who died suddenly, suicides, drowning, etc.) from being born, which were believed to have been extremely active during this period. In some regions of Poland, e.g. Podhale, in the place of someone&#x27;s violent death, every passer-by was obliged to throw a sprig at the stake, which was then burned every year.

A special role in suffragette rites was played by beggars, who in many regions were also called dziady. This coincidence of names was not accidental, because in the folklore of itinerants, the beggars-dziady were seen as mediation figures and connectors with the &quot;other world&quot;. Therefore, people asked them to pray for the souls of their deceased ancestors, offering food (sometimes special ritual bread prepared for the occasion) or cash donations in return. The passing on of food to beggars as part of soul rituals is sometimes interpreted as a form of feeding the souls of ancestors, which is confirmed by the fact that in some areas they were given their favorite dishes of the deceased.

During this holiday, there were numerous prohibitions concerning the performance of various works and activities that could disturb or even threaten the peace of the souls on earth. The following were prohibited: loud behaviour at the table and suddenly getting up (which could frighten souls), cleaning from the table after supper (so that souls could feed), pouring water after washing dishes through the window (so as not to pour over the souls staying there) smoking in the oven (this way – as it was believed – souls would sometimes get home), sewing, weaving or spinning (so as not to sew or tie up a soul that could not return to &quot;that world&quot;) or working on flax.

=== Rite in literature ===

The folk ritual of the dziady became an inspiration for the Adam Mickiewicz&#x27;s &quot;Dziady&quot;, the central motif of which are the scenes of summoning souls during the village congregation, taking place in the abandoned chapel at the cemetery. The ritual is presided over by the Guślarz (Koźlarz, Huslar), who preaches ritual formulas and evokes the souls of the dead in purgatory. They are to tell them what they need to achieve salvation and to eat the food they have carried for them.

Ethnological and literary studies clearly show that in Mickiewicz&#x27;s work we deal with stylization. The author took numerous elements from Belarusian folklore, processed them artistically and created an original image. In fact, the rituals of the dziady took place in christian times, either in houses, or in cemeteries by the graves of their ancestors, or in places connected archetypically (and often also locally) with former centers of worship – on hills, under sacred trees, in places considered sacred (sometimes actually by chapels, which were often built on former places of pagan worship). Mickiewicz&#x27;s references to terms such as &quot;purgatory&quot; and &quot;salvation&quot; are the result of combining pagan and Christian customs.

=== Contemporary celebration ===

To this day, in some regions of eastern Poland, Belarus, Ukraine and part of Russia, it is cultivated to carry on the graves of the dead a symbolic meal in clay pots. The majority of Slavic neo-pagan and rodnover movements also cultivate the dziady. Every year in Krakow, a traditional is held, directly related to the ancient custom of spring ancestors&#x27; holiday.

In Belarus, dziady began to gain in importance in the late 1980s and were particularly important for Belarusian Catholics, for whom this day became a symbol of memory of the victims of the communist regime. On October 30, 1988, the first mass gathering was organized, not by the authorities but by activists, to commemorate the victims in 20th century Belarus. The authorities of that time, which did not like it, dispersed the assembly with the help of the militsiya. The dziady ceased to be a day off in 1996, when the holiday began to be associated with the democratic opposition. Nowadays, hundreds of thousands of Belarusians are taking leave on demand to honor their ancestors on November 1 and 2. In 2017, the President of the Episcopal Conference of Belarus, Tadeusz Kondrusiewicz, said that the dziady should be a day off from work, instead of the October Revolution on November 7. He also supported the Internet petition for granting the status of a day off from work to grandfathers, which has now collected over 2500 signatures.

== Dziady and Christianity ==
Christianity, on the one hand, fought against pagan rituals, successfully banning them, and on the other hand, it tried to adapt some of them in an attempt to christianize them. In the case of the dziady, both the Catholic and the Orthodox Church tried to marginalize and then eliminate pagan festivals by introducing into their squares (at the same or similar moments of the annual cycle) Christian festivals and practices (respectively, the counselor subots and the suffragettes). A different strategy was adopted in the Uniate Church, which obliged the priests to go with the rural population to their dziady and pray the Angelus, the Hail Mary and other christian prayers. In some regions, the Uniate priests celebrated special processions at the cemeteries, during which they consecrated individual graves and collected food and money left on them.

<doc id="907480" wikidata="Q7714054" url="?curid=907480" title="The Apprentice (American TV series) season 2">
<text>The Apprentice 2 is the second season of The Apprentice, which began on September 9, 2004, on NBC. Although this season did not match the ratings of the first and dropped out of the Top 10 Nielsen, it still performed strongly overall, ranking  11 with an average of 16.14 million viewers.

==Season changes==
This season featured 18 candidates, whereas the first season only had 16.

Three new twists were introduced to &quot;The Apprentice&quot; this season. First, each team was unexpectedly forced at the season&#x27;s outset to make a 1-for-1 player swap, resulting in a male on the female team (Bradford), and a female on the male team (Pamela). The traded members then became the project managers for the first task. Second, it was revealed that a project manager for the winning team would be immune from being fired the following week, even though in the season&#x27;s second episode Bradford Cohen decided to waive his exemption that he got on the episode prior and was subsequently fired for making that ill-advised decision.

Finally, the losing project manager could choose either two or three people to bring to the boardroom to be considered for firing. The option to take three people to the boardroom was only used twice, with the first person (Ivana Ma) who did so making the decision after pressure to do so from Donald Trump.

==Weekly summary==

=== Week 1: Toying with Disaster ===
* Air date: September 9, 2004
* Apex project manager: Bradford
* Mosaic project manager: Pamela
* Task: Develop a new toy for Mattel. The product deemed most viable would be the winner.
* Judges: Donald Trump; Carolyn Kepcher; George H. Ross
* Trump monologue: &quot;Be Quick But Be Careful&quot; – To be quick and not careful is a bad decision. Trump prefers when his employees carefully take their time and make the right decision; but a good decision made quickly is the best combination.
* Result: The team with mostly men (Mosaic) developed a line of mutated animal Transformers called &quot;Crustacean Nation&quot;. The team with mostly women (Apex) developed a radio controlled car called the &quot;Meta-morpher&quot; with parts that interchange. 
* Winning Team: Apex
** Reasons for win: The Mattel executives felt that Apex&#x27;s product was more innovative, and would generate more money over time due to potential sales of add-on packs containing new parts.
** Reward: Dinner with Trump and Melania Knauss.
* Dramatic tension: When deciding on corporation names, Raj clearly disliked his team&#x27;s name (Mosaic), as he wanted to name the team &quot;Empire,&quot; and thought Mosaic was a &quot;fruity toot&quot; name; the name was also criticized by Trump. Trump was also puzzled that Raj decided to carry a cane during the first task. On Apex, Bradford struggled to fit in with his otherwise all-female team, and Stacie J. completely alienated the members of her team during the wait before a winning team was decided. On Mosaic, Pamela makes fun of the weight and haircuts of the children in the focus group, which offended Carolyn.
* Losing Team: Mosaic
** Reasons for loss: Trump felt that their toy was generic and lacked a unique selling point, and that their presentation was inferior to Apex&#x27;s.
* Sent to boardroom: Pamela, Rob, Andy
** Firing Verdict: 
***Several team members claimed that Rob did not contribute as much as he could have, but Rob claimed he was underutilized. He also curtly cut off Carolyn in the boardroom when she interrupted him to ask a question.
***Although he came up with the &quot;Crustacean Nation&quot; concept, Andy insisted that he was brought into the final boardroom simply because of his youth. 
***Ultimately Trump was not impressed with Rob feeling he could&#x27;ve contributed even though he wasn&#x27;t asked and decided he would be the first to be fired
* Fired: Rob Flanagan – for not being assertive in the task, not coming forward with his ideas, and being very disrespectful towards Carolyn. While Pamela lead the team to defeat with the poor presentation, and he questioned Andy&#x27;s youth, he felt both had potential and decided Rob&#x27;s failure to step up and contribute along with his poor enthusiasm were enough to justify his dismissal.
* Notes:
** On September 14, 2004, Mattel announced that they would produce the winning toy under the name Morph Machines. It debuted in early 2005 at a retail price of $30.

===Week 2: Scoop Dreams===
* Air date: September 16, 2004 (a special 2-hour cut later aired on September 18)
* Apex project manager: Ivana
* Mosaic project manager: Kelly
* Task: Create, develop and market a new flavor of ice cream with the Ciao Bella Gelato Company for the Trump Ice Cream Parlour.
* Judges: Donald Trump; Carolyn Kepcher; George H. Ross
* Trump Monologue: &quot;Get Organized&quot; – A lack of organization is a lack of leadership and without leadership, success is impossible.
* Result: Mosaic developed a flavor made of various types of doughnuts. Apex&#x27;s flavor was based on Red velvet cake.
* Dramatic tension: Although both teams initially struggled to find a place to market their ice cream, Mosaic made a critical error when they left their business plan in the open for Apex to read. The men also struggled dealing with John, after he demanded that the team forgo any sort of lunch or snack breaks so that they could sell ice cream all day and not spend any profit. When Raj stated that he had hypoglycemia, which would be grievously aggravated by not eating anything during the day, John started yelling at Raj, accusing him of being lazy and making up excuses. Kelly then told the team that every man would get $5 to buy some food during the day, and when John tried to argue against this, Kelly simply told him &quot;Got it. It&#x27;s noted,&quot; and then gave everyone (including John) the petty cash.
* Winning Team: Mosaic
** Reasons for win: They made almost $250 more than the other team. Although they had to buy their own ingredients (namely doughnuts), they opted to give a portion to the Leukemia-Lymphoma Society as a marketing gimmick, which successfully boosted their sales. Kelly also selected a good location, which was near the Times Square branch of Toys &quot;R&quot; Us (the briefing location in the previous task), because he remembered Trump describing it as the country&#x27;s busiest toy store. Raj also suggested that the men wear bowties in the style of old-fashioned ice cream men. After they won, project manager Kelly asked Trump if their entire winnings could be donated to the charity, to which Trump agreed.
* Reward: Dinner at the Petrossian
* Losing Team: Apex
** Reasons for loss: Apex started somewhat later than Mosaic, and were forced to move from their original sales location near the TKTS center when existing street vendors demanded to see their permit (it was not clear that they actually needed one for the task). In the process, Apex became separated, and their carts lost contact with each other for several hours. Apex tried to bring the carts back together, but Stacie J. misidentified their location as the junction with 7th Avenue, when they were actually standing at the junction with Broadway. Though they eventually got the carts back together, and Jennifer C. made a bulk sale to a restaurant near the end of the day, the time lost when the carts were separated ultimately proved too much to overcome.
* Initial Boardroom: Ivana was castigated for her disorganization and loose leadership. Bradford mispronounced Carolyn&#x27;s name, which visibly irked her. Ivana stated that Stacie J. was responsible for losing the cart for as long as they did and that she needed supervision. George was puzzled that the team couldn&#x27;t see each other, as 7th Avenue and Broadway are only half a block apart. Trump asked Bradford to be frank about Ivana&#x27;s performance, noting that he was the only person in a position to do so, thanks to his immunity. This led to Bradford offering to waive his exemption, and he stated that because he felt like he performed to the best of his abilities, he did not need his immunity. Even though Apex collectively agreed that Ivana was a poor leader, they unanimously decided that Stacie J. presented a bigger liability.
*Sent to boardroom: Ivana, Stacie J., Jennifer C., and Bradford. Ivana selected Jennifer C. and Bradford to go into the boardroom so they could advocate against Stacie J., and believed that because they had been the strongest performers on the task, this would give Trump no choice but to fire Stacie.
**Firing Verdict:
***While Bradford was happy to advocate for Ivana, Jennifer C. became angry at being brought back, and focused most of her criticism on Ivana rather than Stacie.
***Trump didn&#x27;t like Ivana&#x27;s indecision, particularly about which contestants she would bring to the boardroom.
***Trump also felt that Jennifer C. should not have been brought to the boardroom, given her help in securing sales, but became annoyed, and considered firing her, when she repeatedly interjected.
***Despite her error over the cart&#x27;s location, Trump did not hold Stacie J. accountable for the loss, and heavily implied that Ivana would have been fired had Bradford not surrendered his immunity, as Carolyn repeatedly criticized Ivana&#x27;s leadership.
***Overall, Trump was especially concerned with Bradford (whom he explicitly identified as the strongest contestant in the final boardroom), and that his impulsive decision outweighed Ivana&#x27;s bad leadership, Jennifer&#x27;s interruptions, and Stacie not working well with the team, because Trump believed that Bradford would be able to instantly destroy a business with a careless decision such as his.
* Fired: Bradford Cohen – for his rash decision to waive his exemption and volunteering to come back to the Final Boardroom, despite being deemed the strongest on the team.
* Notes:
** Bradford became the first candidate to ever leave Trump Tower without his luggage, not having packed his bags due to his exemption. He presumably received his luggage from crew members sometime after his firing.
** As a result of his firing, Bradford has the dubious honor of lasting the shortest amount of time of any successful first-episode project manager (in any incarnation of the show).

===Week 3: Send in the Crowns===
* Air date: September 23, 2004
* Prologue: There was a massive argument among the women before the task even began, with Maria, Ivana, Sandy and Stacy R. openly telling Stacie J. that they considered her mentally unstable and did not wish to continue working with her. Elizabeth and both the Jennifers did not question Stacie J.&#x27;s state of mind, but still considered her the weakest on the team.
* Apex project manager: Elizabeth
* Mosaic project manager: Kevin
* Task: Develop a launch promotion for Crest&#x27;s newest flavor of toothpaste. Each team has a budget of $50,000, and the winner will be chosen by executives from Procter &amp; Gamble, Crest&#x27;s parent company.
* Judges: Donald Trump; Carolyn Kepcher; George H. Ross
* Trump Monologue &quot;A Penny Saved is a Penny Saved&quot; – Trump is basically quite critical of the budget that is set. This could possibly be a typo, because the saying is typically &quot;A Penny Saved is a Penny Earned&quot;.
* Dramatic tension: Stacie J. did little to help win over her teammates when she suggested giving away over a thousand tubes of toothpaste, only for it to turn out that this amount was far more than they could feasibly carry, forcing them to spend much of the morning of their event transporting it to their location. On Mosaic, Andy came up with an idea to purchase an insurance policy for a million dollar giveaway, intending to set the giveaway up so that in all likelihood nobody would win, but that the policy would protect them in case anyone did. However, Procter &amp; Gamble forbade Mosaic to have the giveaway, saying that there were too many legal problems. The team were forced to come up with a new idea at the last minute, and a dejected Andy realized he would almost certainly be fired if the team lost.
* Result: Apex selects Mike Piazza to endorse the toothpaste at a cost of $20,000. Mosaic, after an abortive attempt to have a million dollar contest, gives away several smaller $5,000 prizes, with circus performers entertaining the crowds.
* Winning Team: Mosaic
** Reasons for win: The Procter &amp; Gamble executives felt that Mosaic&#x27;s event was actually inferior to Apex&#x27;s, and that it lacked any big idea or central theme. Despite this, the event still went well and raised enough buzz that, combined with Apex&#x27;s fatal blunder, the team were still awarded the win.
** Reward: Dinner on 
* Losing Team: Apex
** Reasons for loss: Despite feeling that Apex clearly had the better event (mostly due to Piazza&#x27;s involvement), the team made a fatal error by exceededing their budget by over $5,000, which the executives felt was too much for them to be awarded the win. Elizabeth blamed Maria because of her sloppy contract negotiations, which allowed the company in charge of producing their publicity material to invoke an overtime clause and inflated their original $1,850 estimate to a final price of $6,950.
* Sent to boardroom: &quot;All of Apex.&quot; - Initially Elizabeth chose Maria and Stacie J. for the Final Boardroom, but Trump became concerned with Apex&#x27;s feelings concerning Stacie. He called everyone from Apex back to the boardroom to discuss their feelings about Stacie J.&#x27;s behavior during the first task.
* Firing Verdict: 
**At first, Trump didn&#x27;t understand why Ivana was not brought back into the boardroom, because she was responsible for monitoring the budget and only allotted $500 (1% of the total budget) for overspend, which wasn&#x27;t nearly enough to handle a major budgetary crisis. Elizabeth disagreed and said that Maria and Stacie J. were both more responsible for the loss than Ivana (although Elizabeth had the opportunity to bring Ivana back). 
**Trump felt that Elizabeth was a poor leader for not even knowing Apex had exceeded their budget until the task result was announced, and that Maria should have taken accountability for the bad deal she made.
**Trump asked why Stacie J. was brought back, and Maria then brought up the incident with Stacie J. in the first task and how everyone on the team was very frightened by it resulting in &quot;Trump requesting all of Apex to come to the Final Boardroom&quot;. 
**When &quot;All of Apex&quot; brought back, all the women agreed that Stacie J. acted very odd, Ivana went as far as calling Stacie J.&#x27;s actions &quot;borderline schizophrenic,&quot; and Sandy and Stacy R. in particular viciously attacked Stacie J., saying they didn&#x27;t feel comfortable being in the same room as her and would not even trust her with menial work. 
**Although Stacie J. insisted that she wasn&#x27;t crazy, and Jennifer M. pointed out that Stacie hadn&#x27;t displayed any more strange behavior in the previous two tasks, Trump told her that something must have happened because her entire team was concerned with her behavior.
* Fired: Stacie Jones Upchurch – for being a distraction within her team and due to fears that she is mentally unstable based on her behavior from the first task and Apex&#x27;s reaction to it. Although Elizabeth was a poor leader and Maria made a horrible deal with Mike Piazza, Trump didn&#x27;t want to have someone who is out of control working for The Trump Organization. 
* Notes:
** For the first time in the American version of &quot;The Apprentice&quot;, the entire team is called back into the boardroom by Trump.

===Week 4: The Last Supper===
* Air date: September 29
* Prologue: Kevin and Raj, along with Jennifer M., lambasted the women for their treatment of Stacie J., and Elizabeth is attacked for choosing her to go to the boardroom in the previous episode, much to Elizabeth&#x27;s annoyance, as she had actually brought Stacie back for wasting the team&#x27;s time with the bulk delivery, rather than her past behavior despite being told consistently that was not why they lost.
* Apex project manager: Jennifer C.
* Mosaic project manager: Raj
* Task: Open a new restaurant in 24 hours. Each team would be given an empty space in Manhattan. They would be responsible for chef selection, decor and stocking the restaurant. The winner would be the team that scored the highest on the Zagat Survey of customers.
* Judges: Donald Trump; Carolyn Kepcher; Bill Rancic
* Result: Apex chose an Asian fusion theme while Mosaic went with standard American.
* Trump Monologue: &quot;Be Respected&quot; – There are several varied traits of a leader, however respect is the common trait in all of them, without respect one can not be a leader.
* Dramatic tension: Stacy R. and Jennifer M. met with Zagat&#x27;s people beforehand and tried to convince Jennifer C. that going with the complicated Asian fusion concept was a bad idea, but Jennifer C. stuck with it anyway. Apex continued to struggle throughout the task, and Elizabeth even had a breakdown when she felt that she was being set up for failure. Stacy R. took offense at Jennifer C.&#x27;s judgment of two Jewish women who were over-critical of their restaurant, and they clashed over this before the boardroom.
* Winning Team: Mosaic
** Reasons for win: Their restaurant received a very positive review from the survey and a score of 61 points, outscoring Apex in all aspects except, ironically, the actual food. They mostly won out due to the strong scores in the customer service and décor areas.
** Reward: A meeting with Rudy Giuliani.
* Losing Team: Apex
** Reasons for loss: They got a score of 57 points, losing by just 4 points, but did particularly worse in the decor and service category than the men did. The women were also reprimanded for the overall appearance, for although they had chic style clothing and a nice modern look to their restaurant, it did not fit with their middle-class locale. Guest judge Bill Rancic also noted that Apex did not have a lot of energy throughout their service and seemed very tense, which the women blamed on Jennifer C&#x27;s abrasive leadership.
* Sent to boardroom: Jennifer C., Elizabeth, Stacy R.
** Firing Verdict: Trump felt Apex should have hired a cleaning crew the night before like Mosaic to avoid fatigue the next day. He was also surprised that Sandy was not called back to the boardroom, because she was responsible for the poor design in the restaurant. Jennifer C. was suspected of bringing Elizabeth and Stacy R. mainly for personal reasons, because Trump and his advisors knew that Sandy was primarily responsible for the loss, because she produced the restaurant decor that scored poorly.
* Fired: Jennifer Crisafulli – for her bad leadership and terrible decision making, which included not bringing in Sandy for the boardroom, bringing in Elizabeth and Stacy R. for personal reasons, and for her comments on the Jewish women. Trump saw no reason to fire Elizabeth or Stacy R. and called Jennifer C.&#x27;s firing &quot;easy&quot;.
* Notes:
** This episode is moved to this day due to the US presidential debate.
** Bill Rancic, last season&#x27;s winner, fills in for George Ross on this task.
** During the initial boardroom, the women got into a huge argument about many aspects of the tasks, prompting Carolyn to step in a berate them for their unprofessional behavior, especially Jennifer C., who constantly interrupted despite being asked many times. Carolyn would state she was embarrassed as a woman seeing the ladies behave like they did.
** Jennifer Crisafulli was fired from her job at a real estate agency in Manhattan the day after this episode aired. The firm cited her comments regarding the Jewish women as the reason for her dismissal.
** When the men were briefing about customer service, it seemed Chris was the only one who had expertise in customer service. He used numerous curse words when talking about how to be a server and told the men he &quot;hates the public&quot; to their laughter. Raj later said he hoped Chris could put his grudge behind him.

===Week 5: Lights! Camera! Transaction!===
* Airdate: October 7
* Corporate shuffle: Trump sent Pamela over to Apex and he appointed her as the project manager for this task, setting up the &quot;battle of the sexes&quot; once again.
* Apex project manager: Pamela
* Mosaic project manager: Chris
* Task: Select a product from the QVC inventory and sell it on-air. The winner would be the team that has the most gross sales.
* Judges: Donald Trump; Carolyn Kepcher; George H. Ross
* Trump Monologue: &quot;Price is Right&quot; – The right price is extremely important, if the price is marginally high it can kill the marketed products or restaurant, if it is marginally lower it can do wonders, pricing is very important.
* Result: Apex chose a cleaning product called &quot;It Works!&quot;. Mosaic went with a more costly electric sandwich maker.
* Dramatic tension: Pamela begins her leadership of Apex with a speech where she admonishes the team for their behavior, and during her speech, Pamela criticizes them for interrupting and not paying attention to people when they are speaking. Raj and Kelly disagreed over the price of the sandwich maker; Raj argued that setting it at a slightly lower price might lead more people to buy it, but Kelly insisted that it should be sold over the $70 price point. Chris, the project manager, accepted Kelly&#x27;s idea, and although it annoyed Raj, it was key in getting the victory for Mosaic.
* Winning Team: Mosaic
** Reasons for win: Mosaic barely squeaked by, winning by only $10, even though they sold far fewer units.
** Reward: Tennis practice at the Arthur Ashe Stadium with John McEnroe and Anna Kournikova. During the reward, Raj tempts the fates and makes a pass at Anna, who agrees to date him if he can return any of her serves. He fails, and is forced to run around the Arthur Ashe Stadium in his boxers while John, Anna and the rest of the men hit tennis balls at him.
* Losing Team: Apex
** Reasons for loss: Despite an overall strong effort, the team just fell short. Trump felt that if they had dropped their price a little lower, it would have boosted their sales by enough to carry them to victory.
* Sent to boardroom: Pamela, Stacy R., Maria
** Firing Verdict: Trump expressed admiration for Pamela for being able to switch over to Apex and become the project manager, but he was also concerned that she couldn&#x27;t admit she lost. Pamela kept saying it was a tie, but both Trump and his advisors strongly disagreed, and they felt that it was the price of the item which caused Apex to lose. Pamela, however, believed that Apex would have won if their item was priced even higher. Stacey R. also criticized Pamela&#x27;s laid-back approach to the legal work involved in the task leading to tell Trump, &quot;If you want another Enron on your hands Mr. Trump, here&#x27;s Pamela.&quot;
* Fired: Pamela Day – for her overconfident leadership skills, lack of assessment skills, and for setting the price of the item too high, which ultimately caused her team to fail. Trump also felt that she couldn&#x27;t admit she was wrong, that she was a poor judge of her team&#x27;s skills, and assigned them to the wrong jobs.
* Episode Five recap at NBC.com
* Read the Episode 5 Recap at Yahoo!&#x27;s Apprentice 2 Website
* This is the fourth week in a row that Apex has lost a task, and the fourth week in a row that Mosaic won a task.

===Week 6: Crimes of Fashion===
* Airdate: October 14
* Apex project manager: Maria
* Mosaic project manager: John
* Task: Select a designer, develop a clothing line to present at a fashion show for buyers from several upscale department stores. The team with the highest revenue from orders wins.
* Judges: Donald Trump; Carolyn Kepcher; George H. Ross
* Trump Monologue: &quot;Know Your Market&quot; – Trump reflects on all his endeavors, and discusses the importance of the demographic the product is catered towards.
* Result: The women&#x27;s team worked very smoothly, completing the task without any major problems and had a designer who accommodated them by walking them through most of the steps. The men&#x27;s team floundered throughout the task, partly because their designer was not helpful.
* Dramatic tension: Several women on Apex believed that Elizabeth was a distraction, and Maria had to divert her away from the group in order to get the task done more efficiently. On the men&#x27;s team, Kelly rose to occasion by organizing the team, even though Raj was slowing the team down and John was the project manager. Mosaic&#x27;s designer also failed to complete production of the clothes. Part of this was attributed to Raj constantly getting information, wasting time, and leading to an argument with Kelly during completion.
* Winning Team: Apex with $22,060.
** Reasons for victory: Apex made roughly triple the sales revenue of Mosaic. While their overall execution of the task was virtually flawless, Maria was widely credited as having been the perfect choice to lead the team due to her knowledge of the industry.
** Reward: A celebrity party with Cirque du Soleil
* Losing Team: Mosaic with only $7,735.
** Reasons for loss: In stark contrast to the other team, Mosaic&#x27;s execution of the task was an absolute disaster. The team&#x27;s products were priced too high and unanimously condemned as unappealing by the buyers due to their fabric choices. John proved an extremely ineffective leader, with Kelly taking more of a leadership role in John&#x27;s stead.
* Sent to boardroom: John, Kevin, Andy
** Firing Verdict: Trump felt that Mosaic set their prices too high, which resulted in lower sales. Pricing fell under Kevin and Wes&#x27; responsibility, but John chose to let Wes go back to the suite and bring Andy with Kevin instead. This decision baffled Trump and his advisors, especially since John had the option to bring back both Kevin and Wes along with Andy.
* Fired: John Willenborg – for making a variety of fatal mistakes throughout the task as Project Manager/Team Leader, which included choosing a bad designer, not being involved in the pricing decisions, allowing Kelly to lead the men over him, and for not bringing Wes back to the boardroom after him and Kevin both were responsible for the bad pricing.

===Week 7: Barking Up the Wrong Tree===
* Airdate: October 21
* Apex project manager: Jennifer M.
* Mosaic project manager: Wes
* Corporate restructuring: After the project managers were chosen, Trump told both of them to select three players that they did not want on their team. The chosen players would go to the opposing team, leaving them with three men and three women each. Jennifer M. chose Sandy, Maria, and Stacy R. to go to Mosaic. Wes chose Raj, Chris, and Kevin to go to Apex.
* Task: Create a dog service business in the Central Park area and organize a sales event, with the winning team being the one that makes the most profit.
* Judges: Donald Trump; Carolyn Kepcher; Allen Weisselberg
* Trump Monologue: &quot;Sell Your Ideas&quot; – Similar to last season&#x27;s monologue &quot;Believe in Your Product&quot;, Trump talks about the necessity to have faith in one&#x27;s products or ideas in order to sell them successfully.
* Winning Team: Apex, with nearly triple the sales revenue of Mosaic.
** Reasons for victory: Apex was able to expand their services beyond washing by offering dog massages and nail clippings. As a result, they earned $307.41 in sales revenue.
** Reward: A meeting with Michael Bloomberg.
* Losing Team: Mosaic
** Reasons for loss: Mosaic got off to a late start and was unable to come up with a solid business plan. Andy also left the team&#x27;s cellphone in a taxicab, leaving the team unable to coordinate between different locations. Wes struggled dealing with Stacy R., who spent most of task arguing with Wes when he shot down her ideas. Their total was $122.12 in sales revenue.
* Sent to boardroom: Wes, Andy, and Stacy R.
** Firing Verdict: 
***Trump was astounded that Andy could make such a basic mistake as losing the team&#x27;s cellphone, but Andy was able to make an eloquent defense of himself. 
***Wes was accused of having been a follower rather than a leader on many of the tasks, with Andy stating that Kelly had led this task more than Wes did. 
***Stacy R. came under criticism by Carolyn for having no stand-out skills after seven tasks and for failing to make any significant positive contributions to any task. Stacy blaming Wes for not listening to her, and also claimed that the biggest problem was that no one listens to her. Trump rebutted that Stacy had a responsibility to communicate more effectively, putting the onus on her. 
* Fired: Stacy Rotner – for being unable to sell her ideas, making too many excuses for her shortcomings, and for being a weak contributor throughout the interview process. Despite Andy and Wes&#x27;s critical mistakes on the task, Trump saw more potential in them over Stacy R., who was widely deemed as ineffective and distracting throughout the process.

===Week 8: A Tale of Two Leaders===
* Airdate: October 28
* Apex project manager: Elizabeth
* Mosaic project manager: Andy
* Task: Create a recruiting ad campaign for the New York Police Department with Donny Deutsch&#x27;s advertising firm.
* Judges: Donald Trump; Carolyn Kepcher; George H. Ross
* Trump Monologue: &quot;You Have to Love It&quot; – In order to work for Trump, he needs to see a genuine drive and dedication that is visible by how much potential employees love what they do.
* Winning Team: Mosaic
** Reasons for win: Despite constantly battling with Maria (who wanted more sexuality in the ad) and Kelly (who felt they should go with a more militaristic theme), Andy stuck to his original concept of aiming for the heart and made an advert asking viewers when the last time that they saved a life or made their family proud. Donny Deutsch felt it wasn&#x27;t even close, and awarded the win to Mosaic
** Reward: Watching their ad played on a large screen in Times Square.
* Losing Team: Apex
** Reasons for loss: The team went with a theme promoting the idea of the NYPD as a military force battling terrorism, which was heavily pushed by Chris and Raj. Not only did this not fit the original brief, but the execution also made it look like New York City was a police state, which Donny said would more likely deter potential recruits than encourage them to join. Elizabeth constantly rejected ideas and wavered on the ones she did have, only opting for the military theme at the last possible moment and proved to be such a weak leader that both Chris and Kevin threatened to take control via plotting a coup from her at various points in the task.
* Sent to boardroom: No final boardroom – During the initial boardroom, the entire team blamed Elizabeth for the loss. The entire team attacked Elizabeth for her poor performance including Raj &amp; Chris in which they told Trump the military theme for the commercial was the only direction they went in as a result of her terrible leadership in which Jennifer M. commended them. In an &quot;Apprentice&quot; first, After Elizabeth chose to bring back Chris &amp; Raj (who was responsible for promoting the military idea in the video), Trump decided there was no need and fired Elizabeth on the spot, due to her actions being the crux of the team&#x27;s failure. George felt the same result would happen should a final boardroom take place and Trump said that was a &quot;no brainer&quot; and didn&#x27;t want to waste the team&#x27;s time. 
* Fired: Elizabeth Jarosz – for producing a horrid commercial, her terrible, weak, ineffective, and incompetent leadership on this task, as well as the previous one in Week 3, two failures as Project Manager/Team Leader, inability to control the team, being too indecisive, horrible decision making, and losing the respect of her team as a result. Elizabeth mentioned early in the episode she was a crappy leader on the previous task she has lead.
* Notes:
** This is the first time in the history of &quot;The Apprentice&quot; that a candidate was fired without the need of a final boardroom.
** After Elizabeth&#x27;s elimination, Trump rarely said &quot;sorry&quot; to the people who was still sitting without a final boardroom.

===Week 9: Bringing Down the House===
* Airdate: November 4
* Apex project manager: Raj
* Mosaic project manager: Sandy
* Task: With a $20,000 budget (and the help of 2 previously fired candidates), each team would renovate a home in the suburbs of Long Island. The team who has increased the value of their home by the highest percentage and raised by increase profit would win. Rob and Jennifer C. joined Mosaic and Stacie J. and Bradford were assigned to Apex.
* Judges: Donald Trump; Carolyn Kepcher; Matthew Calamari
* Trump Monologue: &quot;Control Your Contractor&quot; – Trump talks about contractors and he states that although they may not have gone to Harvard, they aren&#x27;t inferior. They are tough, smart and can steal inconspicuously.
* Dramatic tension: Stacie J. went on the offensive, attacking Ivana and the other women for labeling her crazy weeks ago. Ivana was unapologetic however, and said that she stood by every word she had said about Stacie J., even going so far as to say she should not have been invited back for a task of this sort.
* Winning Team: Mosaic
** Reasons for win: The team focused on improving and modernizing the existing infrastructure of the house. Despite initial problems caused by their contractor working slowly in the beginning, Andy found a second contractor who brought in many members of his family to get the job finished in time. Mosaic&#x27;s original house was praised $390,000 to an increase of $430,000 by 10.26%. Trump was very impressed with Rob&#x27;s work and enthusiasm even though he was previously fired.
** Reward: A trip to a country house with a private beach.
* Losing Team: Apex
** Reasons for loss: While Apex&#x27;s plan was more ambitious, there were two fatal flaws. Firstly, Raj decided to knock out a wall and combine two of the bedrooms, turning it from a four bedroom into a three bedroom house, which cancelled out much of the value increase made by the other improvements. Secondly, their contractor proved lazy and ineffective, and left the downstairs rooms in a mess, and the new upstairs bathroom nowhere being finished. As a result, their house was originally praised $385,000 into $412,500 with only a value increase of just 7.14%.
** Initial Boardroom: He didn&#x27;t like Ivana&#x27;s cattiness toward Stacie J., although it seemed Ivana&#x27;s anger was aimed mostly at Jennifer M. for politicking on Stacie J.&#x27;s behalf. When Trump released Chris and Jennifer M. from the initial boardroom, Chris turned to Trump and said that he didn&#x27;t think Apex had any chance of winning another task due to the poor atmosphere within the team. Trump was outraged by this act of disloyalty and offered Raj the chance to bring Chris back into the final boardroom, but Raj refused to do this, saying that Chris wasn&#x27;t to blame for the loss, and on prompting from Matthew, Chris volunteered to lead the team the following week. 
* Sent to boardroom: Raj, Ivana, Kevin
*Firing Verdict: 
**Trump questioned the wisdom of making a four bedroom house into three bedrooms, pointing out that this may have cost them the win.
**Jennifer M. and Raj decide to target Ivana in the boardroom, but their efforts misfire when Trump says that Ivana didn&#x27;t belong in the final boardroom. 
**Trump told Raj that he would absolutely have fired Chris had he been brought back for his stupid interjections by making disloyal negative remarks about this team. 
* Fired: Raj Bhakta - for making numerous mistakes throughout the task as Project Manager/Team Leader, including unable to finish the task, ruining the house&#x27;s value by knocking down one of the bedrooms(making a 4-bedroom house a 3-bedroom house instead), and for not bringing Chris back to the final boardroom after he made disloyal comments about his team prior to being released from the initial boardroom session. While Ivana&#x27;s behavior towards Stacie J was questionable and Kevin was responsible for hiring the lousy contractor, Trump felt that Raj&#x27;s mistakes were the most critical for Apex&#x27;s failure and cited that Raj making so many mistakes is a detriment to The Trump Organization.
* Notes:
** Matthew Calamari is the sub judge for George Ross.
** Jennifer M. told Raj she would support him in the Boardroom and that they should focus on getting Ivana fired. Unfortunately, Jen attacked Ivana in the suite stating &quot;you&#x27;re not good for anything but filling out spreadsheets&quot; and mocking the idea that the &quot;barely producing&quot; Ivana would bring down someone as great as herself; this alerted Ivana to defend herself, which she did strongly and led to the quick focus for potential firing on either Raj or Chris.
** Trump wore a tuxedo to the boardroom meeting as he was giving out an award at a hotel later that night, and remarked that it would be a &quot;formal firing.&quot;
** After Raj is eliminated, he asked Robin Himmler for her phone number; while she didn&#x27;t give him the number at the time, she later revealed she and Raj did go out for coffee after the show was over.

===Week 10: Runaway Pride===
* Airdate: November 11
* Prologue: Following Apex&#x27;s previous boardroom session, Chris becomes the Project Manager for Apex&#x27;s next task at Matt&#x27;s &amp; Trump&#x27;s discretion after making disloyal comments about his team. 
* Apex project manager: Chris
* Mosaic project manager: Kelly
* The task: Open a bridal shop and sell dresses. The winning team would conclude as to who earns the most profit in their final sales.
* Judges: Donald Trump; Carolyn Kepcher; George H. Ross
* Trump Monologue: &quot;Believe In Yourself&quot; – Echoing the age old theme of a positive attitude and self-confidence.
* Dramatic tension: Maria and Wes failed to include the telephone number on Mosaic&#x27;s appointment flyer, frustrating the rest of the team. Sandy was worried about Kelly&#x27;s leadership relying too much on her expertise and the team&#x27;s ability to attract the customers into the store. On Apex, Chris struggled throughout the task as he couldn&#x27;t figure out a way to market wedding dresses to public, and felt it was pointless considering their opponents had someone who was an expert on their side. Ivana and Kevin jointly ignored Jennifer M. throughout the task and left her with menial work following her attacks on them in the previous boardroom.
* Winning team: Mosaic 
** Reasons for win: Mosaic had a huge advantage in having Sandy, who owned a bridal shop prior to joining the process. They began their marketing plan earlier than Apex and composed successful email blasts, despite that the fact that their appointment document did not include a telephone number. Their sales stood at $12,788.94 and sold 27 dresses. 
** Reward: $50,000 jewelry shopping spree at Graff with Melania Trump. Trump bought Melania&#x27;s engagement ring from there. 
* Losing team: Apex
**Reasons for Loss: Apex&#x27;s sales were only $1,060.47 and they only sold two dresses. Feeling outmatched due to Mosaic&#x27;s edge with Sandy, Chris was unable to create any kind of effective marketing strategy, with their only marketing strategy was handing out flyers at Penn Station and Grand Central and window artwork promoting the bridal sale. 
* Sent to boardroom: Chris, Kevin, Ivana
**Firing Verdict: Trump and his advisors felt that Penn Station or Grand Central were not good locations to promote marriage or wedding dresses. He also disliked that Chris didn&#x27;t back Jennifer M., saying she was just as responsible for the loss, even though Jennifer being responsible for stocking the vendors. Trump also felt that Chris mentally checked out of the task early on and lost the drive he had in previous tasks.
* Fired: Chris Russo - for mentally checking out at the beginning of the task, leading his team to a crushing defeat, losing his drive to continue in the process, having no real sales strategy throughout the task, unable to make delegations, not bringing Jennifer M. back to the Final Boardroom, maintaining a terrible attitude, and his disloyal, negative, offensive comments to his team last week.

===Week 11: The Butt Stops Here===
* Airdate: November 18, 2004
* Apex project manager: Kevin
* Mosaic project manager: Wes
* Task: The teams are asked to create an in-store advertising catalog for Levi&#x27;s Jeans, judged by Levi&#x27;s president.
* Judges: Donald Trump, Carolyn Kepcher and Bill Rancic
* Corporate Shuffle: Kelly is transferred to Apex to even the teams.
* Trump Monologue: &quot;Never Lose Your Cool&quot; – Trump discusses the importance of maintaining composure, noting that it can be used to inspire employees.
* Dramatic tension: Once again, Ivana and Kevin isolated Jennifer M. with busywork while they create the bulk of the catalog with Kelly. Sensing she was being sabotaged, Jennifer would later insert herself into the campaign presentation, making herself appear responsible for the wheel which was Ivana&#x27;s concept. The Levi&#x27;s president tells Trump that Jennifer did the best job, angering Ivana. On Mosaic, Maria shuts Wes out of the photo shoot and refuses to let the rest of the team see their catalog. At one point during the task, Maria snapped at Wes to &quot;back off&quot; while pointing her finger in his face.
* Winning team: Apex
** Reasons for Win: Apex had a campaign revolving around &quot;The Perfect Fit&quot; and a circular wheel helping customers pick the style of pants that&#x27;s right for them.
** Reward: Billy Joel concert
* Losing team: Mosaic 
** Reasons for Loss: Mosaic did not clearly communicate the fit range nor the sponsor&#x27;s brand message that Levi&#x27;s have a fit for everyone.
* Sent to boardroom: Wes, Andy, Maria, Sandy - Project Manager Wes wanted &quot;All&quot; of Mosaic to return for Final Boardroom. 
** Firing Verdict: Trump was peeved at both Maria and Wes for their errors throughout the task. He called out Andy for being quiet in the boardroom, but accepted his smooth response. Carolyn felt that Sandy wasn&#x27;t getting her point across and that Wes was a poor leader. Due to bad leadership and poor performance from Maria, Trump fire both Maria and Wes. 
* Fired: In an &quot;Apprentice&quot; first, Trump fired &quot;more than one person&quot; outside of the interview process. Maria Boren and Wes Moss were fired for the following reasons: 
** Maria Boren – for her blatant disrespect towards her team, lashing out at Wes, the project manager, being completely unmanageable, giving a terrible presentation, and being the most responsible for the unsuccessful campaign after taking too much control of the project.
** Wes Moss – for lousy leadership on this task and the previous one in week 7, being too feeble, two failures as Project Manager/Team Leader, being a follower rather than a leader, losing control of Maria, and making no attempt to alleviate the tension that she caused throughout the task.
* Notes:
** Carolyn angrily chastised Maria by saying if any one of her employees had told her to &quot;back off&quot;, they would not be working for her and would be fired immediately.
** This was the first multi-firing (outside the interview stage) in the series. Because the dual departure was not planned, Maria and Wes shared a single taxi, with Wes stating in the exit interview: &quot;I would have at least liked to have my own cab&quot;.

===Week 12: The Pepsi Challenge===

* Airdate: November 25, 2004
* Apex project manager: Kelly
* Mosaic project manager: Andy
* Task: The teams are asked to create a new bottle for Pepsi Edge, and present it to Pepsi&#x27;s entire advertising team.
* Judges: Donald Trump; Carolyn Kepcher; George H. Ross
* Corporate shuffle: Jennifer M. is transferred onto Mosaic to even out the teams, which Ivana refers to as a tumor being lifted from the team.
* Trump Monologue: &quot;Form Your Own Opinion&quot; - As a leader Trump listens to his team, but in the end forms his own opinion. The leader that wants to be popular or to be loved, that leader ultimately is not going to make it.
* Dramatic tension: Andy refused to let Pepsi employees eat their pizza when it was delivered, because they hadn&#x27;t finished part of the task. He also gave cash incentives to the Pepsi employees, because he thought it would motivate them. Despite Sandy&#x27;s clear objections, Andy gave the cash anyway.
* Winning team: Apex
**Reasons for Win: Apex develops a bottle that has the letters D and G carved out of plastic, providing the grounds for a theme of hiding things in the inside of the D (referred to by the team as &quot;What&#x27;s in the box?&quot;). Their bottle represents &quot;What Pepsi Edge is all about.&quot;
** Reward: Racing Lamborghini Gallardos around a track.
* Losing team: Mosaic
**Reasons for Loss: Mosaic develops a theme of &quot;The Best of Both Worlds&quot;, designed to appeal to the &quot;dual users&quot; of both diet and regular colas. The bottle is shaped like a regular Pepsi bottle with two halves of a globe on the bottom and top. A contest revolving around collecting areas of a continent to win a &quot;Trip to the Edge&quot; is also proposed. Although the Pepsi Advertising Team liked the label of the team&#x27;s bottle, their bottle was unappealing for having a design of the bottle with blobs in it and felt like lifting a dumbbell (one of the advertising executives stated he didn&#x27;t remember &quot;when the last time geography was cool&quot;).
* Sent to boardroom: Andy, Jennifer M., Sandy
** Firing Verdict: 
***Trump agreed with the ad executive&#x27;s decision that the bottle was too boring, lifting it as a dumbbell at one point. 
***George was impressed with Sandy&#x27;s defense and felt Andy wasn&#x27;t strong enough to have a winning concept. 
***Carolyn questioned why Jennifer M. gets defended by a project manager every time she&#x27;s in the boardroom. 
***Before the boardroom, Andy approaches Jennifer M. and proposes that they gang up on Sandy. Over the course of the initial boardroom, Sandy figures this out and begins to deride both of them for their actions. Showered with a debate raging on both sides of him, Andy appeared helpless as Jennifer and Sandy scream at each other constantly until Trump bangs on the table to get their attention.
***Trump got upset at Andy for his performance in the task, as well as getting outdebated by both women in the boardroom.
* Fired: Andy Litinsky - for coming up with a terrible idea for the bottle and for his unprofessional behavior to the Pepsi employees. He also let himself get bombarded by Sandy and Jennifer during the boardroom, which did not show any of his abilities as a debate champion. Trump said afterwards he had planned initially to fire Sandy but her impressive defense in the Boardroom changed his mind.
Notes:
* When Sandy and Jennifer left the boardroom and got on the elevator Sandy continued to argue with Jennifer over the conversation she and Andy had before the boardroom

===Week 13: Sweet &amp; Lowdown===
* Airdate: December 2
* Apex project manager: Ivana
* Mosaic project manager: Sandy
* Task: The two teams are assigned to produce and sell the M-AZING candy bar, a new product from M&amp;M Mars. The team that makes the most profit from selling the candy bars is the winner.
* Judges: Donald Trump; Carolyn Kepcher; George H. Ross
* Trump Monologue: &quot;Know Your Enemy&quot; - Trump says, the worst thing one can do is to underestimate one&#x27;s opponent. Though an opponent may seem weak, they could be the toughest, smartest person in the world.
* Result: Apex produces about 323 candy bars, while Mosaic produces only about 290 candy bars.
* Winning team: Mosaic
** Reasons for win: Despite making fewer candy bars, Jennifer M. and Sandy priced their candy bars $5 higher than Apex did, which gave them a greater overall revenue. The women also wore flashy outfits as part of their marketing material, which attracted them to more buyers. They made their total profit of $1,023.11.
** Reward: Flying to Chicago to meet Bill Rancic at the Trump International Hotel and Tower Chicago.
* Losing team: Apex
** Reasons for loss: Apex&#x27;s price point was too low, with Kevin selling his candy bars even lower after being initially unsuccessful with the set price. In a desperate attempt to sell a candy bar to a man for $20 on Wall Street, Ivana dropped her skirt in public. They only made a total profit of $560.75.
* Sent to boardroom: Ivana, Kevin, Kelly
** Firing Verdict: Apex was grilled for the loss, given that they had more candy bars in stock and their opponents were a duo who could barely stand each other. Ivana had virtually no defense in the boardroom, as both Kelly and Kevin had superior track records in both the tasks and as project managers. At one point, Ivana angrily exclaimed that Jennifer M. had the same number of task losses, but Jennifer wasn&#x27;t even in the boardroom. George felt Kelly and Kevin were more liable for the loss after setting the price too low, but Carolyn found Ivana&#x27;s stripping gimmick reprehensible and couldn&#x27;t even think of one good contribution that Ivana had made throughout the entire process.
* Fired: Ivana Ma - for stripping in public to upsell the candy bars in an act of desperation, her terrible track record including her bad team record of 5-8 and two failures as Project Manager/Team Leader, and poorly defending herself in the boardroom. While Kevin&#x27;s decision to set the price low was arguably the biggest factor in Apex&#x27;s loss, Trump felt Ivana had been a far poorer performer compared to Kevin who had a far better track record. 
* Episode Thirteen recap at NBC.com
* Read the Episode 13 Recap at Yahoo!&#x27;s Apprentice 2 Website
* Notes:
** Ironically, Ivana had said in task 2 that she&#x27;d rather lose with dignity than resort to using her sexuality to sell something. This would completely contradict her performance in this task, when she was willing to drop her skirt to anyone who would give her $20 for her candy bar.
** Kelly&#x27;s exemption from the previous week meant that he was not in danger of being fired, but Trump nevertheless had him come back to the final boardroom to help decide whether Ivana or Kevin should be fired.
** Right before he fired Ivana, Trump stated that it was because he did not want to hire a stripper. In her exit interview, Ivana defended her actions, claiming that she was wearing more than Mosaic (which was arguably untrue) and that she had worn even less at the gym, and saying that albeit it wasn&#x27;t her proudest moment, she was able to successfully sell her item.

=== Week 14: Intellectual Horsepower ===
* Airdate: December 9
* Prologue: Teams, rewards, and project managers no longer apply per the final four candidates, and Trump showed the final four a preview on how he views the life of The Apprentice.
* Trump Monologue: &quot;Winning Is Everything&quot; - There&#x27;s no better feeling than being a winner. In order to be a winner, one has to be positive and think like a winner with no intention of giving up.
* Task scope: The candidates will go for one-on-one interviews with four prolific executives. These executive will personally interview the final four candidates and then advise Trump on which two candidates should be fired. The interviewers are as follows:
** Alan Jope, Chief Operating Officer of Unilever
** Dawn Hudson, President of Pepsi-Cola North America
** Alan &quot;Ace&quot; Greenberg, Chairman of Bear Stearns
** Robert Kraft, Owner of the NFL&#x27;s New England Patriots.
* Boardroom details: The executives unanimously liked Kelly, even though one felt he was a bit stiff, as they felt he was good as both a leader and a follower and liked that he had a military history. The interviewers liked Kevin, but found him to be aimless, and stressed to Trump that they would not hire anyone with excessive uncertainty. Although the interviewers liked Jennifer M., they felt that she was just giving them what they wanted to hear, rather than what she really had to say. The executives did like Sandy, but they deemed her unworthy of working for Trump, mainly because they were unsure of her ability to transition into a corporate environment and worried about her lack of a college degree.
* Fired:
** Kevin Allen - for excessive procrastination and failure to pursue a strong professional career path due to his lengthy educational efforts.
** Sandy Ferreira - for unmet skills in the corporate world.

===Final Task: The Task of All Tasks===
* Airdate: Part one was televised on December 9, and part two was televised on December 16
* Tasks:
** Jennifer M.: an NBA Charity Task, involving professional basketball players, including Chris Webber
** Kelly: a polo match which would be followed by a concert starring Tony Bennett
* Teams:
** Mosaic: Jennifer M. with Chris, Pamela, and Stacy R.
** Apex: Kelly with Elizabeth, John, and Raj
* Judges: Donald Trump; Carolyn Kepcher; George H. Ross
* Kelly said that the last two candidates he had to pick from to round out his team (Raj and Stacy R.) had identical abilities, and that he chose Raj because Raj&#x27;s preppy outfit was a &quot;good fit&quot; for their polo match task.
* Jen didn&#x27;t want Stacy R. on her team and made a quiet comment to that effect to Pamela after the teams gathered, but Stacy R. overheard the remark and shocked Jen by informing her that she didn&#x27;t belong in the Final 2 at all (she said that Sandy should have gotten the other spot) and that if Jen didn&#x27;t want to be completely embarrassed by Kelly she needed to stop being an asshole and start leading for once. Jen apologized and took Stacy R.&#x27;s work seriously for the rest of the task.
* Kelly was so pissed off about Raj and John&#x27;s lazy, unproductive actions that he considered firing or sidelining them, but ultimately kept them in place (and they ended up working hard and doing a good job for him on the tasks). Like the Kwame-Omarosa fiasco in Season 1, fans were left wondering without clarification if Kelly actually COULD have fired them, or if he had no choice but to manage them no matter how badly they performed. In Season 3, George Ross finally made it explicit by telling the Final 2 that &quot;bosses are free to use employees any way they want to.&quot;
* In spite of what the episode showed, it was revealed that Chris Webber never even heard of the event, and his name was included to give Jen&#x27;s team the responsibility of figuring out how to &quot;replace&quot; him at the charity task. Webber later said he would have appeared if he had been given notice or asked directly by Donald Trump.

=== Decision Time ===
* Airdate: December 16, the conclusion to the Season Finale was televised live from Alice Tully Hall at Lincoln Center, New York City with Regis Philbin as event emcee.
* Decision: Sandy, Kevin, Ivana, Wes, and Chris felt that Kelly should win. Andy and Pamela felt that Jennifer M. should win.
* Hired: Kelly Perdew - for his proven record and expertise was preferred over Jennifer M.&#x27;s, even though Trump cited that Kelly couldn&#x27;t bring a military background to business and had doubts over Kelly&#x27;s leadership style (despite his 3–0 record as project manager).
* Fired: Jennifer Massey - for excessive losses in the tasks (5–8) and for her unpopularity with most of the other candidates. It was also the first time a runner-up was told in the finale: &quot;You&#x27;re fired&quot;.
* What is next for Kelly: Kelly decided to oversee a project in New York City over the other choice on the Las Vegas Strip.

<doc id="907481" wikidata="Q154039" url="?curid=907481" title="Zaduszki">
<text>Zaduszki () or Dzień Zaduszny () is a Polish name for the Commemoration of All the Faithful Departed (All Souls&#x27; Day) on 2 November. The word &quot;Zaduszki&quot; originating from &quot;Dzień Zaduszny&quot;, can be roughly translated into English as &quot;the day of prayers for the souls&quot;. On this day people visit cemeteries to light candles and pray for the souls of their faithful departed, especially those believed to be in purgatory.

The annual celebration in the liturgical year of All Souls&#x27; day was standardized and put on 2 November by St. Odilo of Cluny by the end of the 10th century. In 1311, by the decision of the Holy See, All Souls&#x27; Day was introduced into the Roman Rite and the General Roman Calendar. 

In folk understanding, All Saints&#x27; Day was viewed as the eve of the main commemoration of &quot;Dzień Zaduszny&quot;, when most folk customs and rituals took place.

It was believed that during the days of Zaduszki in the autumn, the spirits of deceased relatives visited their old homes by gathering near the windows or on the left side of the main doorway. Eventually, it was believed that as they entered the house, they would warm themselves by the home&#x27;s hearth and search for the commemoration meal prepared for them. Prior to returning to the Otherworld, the souls went to church for a special nighttime mass by the dead priest&#x27;s soul. The living were not allowed to watch the dead; those who broke this rule would be punished severely.

The ritual of Zaduszki began with caring for the cemeteries: people tidied the graves of their relatives, decorated them with flowers, lit the candles; a collective prayer for the dead was organized, and concluded with having the priest bless the graves with prayers and holy water. Homeowners in Eastern Poland prepared to meet the dead by cleaning and preparing the house for the visit; covering the floor with sand, leaving the door or window open, moving a bench closer to the hearth. And on this bench, a dish of water, a comb, and a towel were placed, so that the souls could wash themselves and comb their hair.

Women would traditionally bake special bread for souls on the Zaduszki holiday. The bread was brought to the cemetery and given to the poor, children, clerics, or simply left on the graves in a similar vein to modern-day &#x27;trick-or-treating&#x27;. Families have traditionally tried to give out as much as possible (in some places, they baked and gave out up to 200–300 buns of bread), believing that this would help to bring in wealth and prosperity.

During Zaduszki days, people followed many taboos: by not working in the field, not doing any important household work, and by not starting a trip. According to Polish beliefs, on Zaduszki Eve, one had to go to bed as early as possible, in order not to distract the dead from celebration of their holiday. The remains of the commemorative dinner were not allowed to be removed from the table until morning; going outside and taking out trash or water were tabooed, as well. All the dogs should remain on their chains that night. If someone needed to take out the trash or pour the water out next to the house, he/she would say a special warning by-word: &quot;Move over, soul, or I&#x27;ll spill my trash/water on you!&quot; Whitening of the oven or walls of the house was also prohibited, in order not to spray the dead with clay and lime.

== In other Slavic countries ==
Similar observances exist not just in Poland, but in other Slavonic countries as well, such as Serbia, Slovenia, North Macedonia, Bulgaria, Croatia and Slovakia. These are known by a variety of names: 
* 
* 
* / &quot;Zadušnice&quot;

However, unlike Roman Catholic Poland, in Orthodox Slavonic countries there are four of these events in a calendar year: the one on the first Saturday in November, like All Hallow&#x27;s Eve / All Saints in Roman Catholic, Anglican, and some Lutheran communities, called The St Demetrius Day &quot;Zadušnice&quot;/&quot;Zadušnica&quot;, but also the one before the start of the Great Lent (as a rule in March), the one before the Pentecost, and the one before Michaelmas.

<doc id="907484" wikidata="Q448493" url="?curid=907484" title="Virtual sit-in">
<text>A virtual sit-in is a form of electronic civil disobedience deriving its name from the sit-ins popular during the civil rights movement of the 1960s. The virtual sit-in attempts to recreate that same action digitally using a distributed denial-of-service attack (DDOS). During a virtual sit-in, hundreds of activists attempt to access a target website simultaneously and repetitively. If performed correctly, this will cause the target website to run slowly or even collapse entirely, preventing anyone from accessing it.

== Examples ==
On December 21, 1995, the first world Virtual sit-in, conceived by Tommaso Tozzi, was created by the Florentine group Strano Network against the French government to protest against the nuclear tests in Mururoa and was defined as a &quot;Netstrike&quot;.
On Thursday May 1, 1998, Ricardo Dominguez (co-founder of Electronic Disturbance Theater) and Stefan Wray held a virtual sit-in in which they decided to attack the World Economic Forum (WEF). They did this to support their particular beliefs against anti-globalization. With over 160,000 people who attended the virtual sit-in for reasons that they could not take to the streets of New York City protest. More than 40,000 also downloaded software which made a DDOS attack easier was also recorded. The attack lasted all of Thursday and Friday night.

<doc id="907486" wikidata="Q2061707" url="?curid=907486" title="Wild Turkey (bourbon)">
<text>Wild Turkey is a brand of Kentucky straight bourbon whiskey produced at Wild Turkey Distillery, in Lawrenceburg, Kentucky by the Campari Group. 

The distillery offers tours and is part of the American Whiskey Trail and the Kentucky Bourbon Trail.

==History ==
In 1891, Thomas Ripy built the Old Hickory Distillery in Tyrone, Kentucky, near Lawrenceburg, on the former site of the Old Moore Distillery. After Prohibition, the Ripy family (Thomas had died in 1902) rebuilt the distillery and began to again produce bourbon. The Ripys sold the bourbon produced at this distillery to various wholesalers who bottled bourbon under their own brands. Austin Nichols was one of these wholesalers.

The &quot;Wild Turkey&quot; brand is said to have arisen after an Austin Nichols executive, Thomas McCarthy, took some warehouse samples on a wild turkey hunting trip in 1940. The bourbon proved so popular among his friends they continued to ask him for &quot;that wild turkey bourbon.&quot; Austin Nichols began to bottle Wild Turkey in 1942.

The Ripys were bought out in 1949 by Robert and Alvin Gould.

For the next three decades, Austin Nichols remained a non-distiller producer—bottling bourbon purchased on the open market under the Wild Turkey brand. Much of this whiskey was purchased from the Ripys/Gould distillery in Tyrone. In 1971, Austin Nichols purchased the facility, then known as the Boulevard Distillery, and changed the name to the Wild Turkey Distillery.

In 1980, the distillery and the Wild Turkey brand were purchased by Pernod Ricard.

On May 9, 2000, a fire destroyed a seven-story aging warehouse at the company in Anderson County, Kentucky. It contained more than 17,000 wooden barrels of whiskey. Burning whiskey flowed from the warehouse, setting the surrounding woods on fire. Firefighters saved Lawrenceburg&#x27;s water treatment plant from destruction. However, an estimated 20% of the whiskey flowed into the Kentucky River. The river contamination required the temporary shutdown of the water treatment plant. Officials ordered water usage restrictions. Businesses and schools were closed because of the water shortage. The alcohol spill also depleted the oxygen in the river, killing an estimated 228,000 fish along a 66-mile stretch. The EPA and the Coast Guard&#x27;s Gulf Strike Team aerated the river using equipment mounted on barges. The company paid $256,000 to the Kentucky Department of Fish and Wildlife in an effort to restore the fish population in the river.

In 2009, the Campari Group acquired the distillery and the Wild Turkey brand from Pernod Ricard.

In 2011, Wild Turkey began to be distilled at a newly constructed facility near the old distillery. The new distillery sits where the old bottling facility was previously located. 

In 2013, Campari opened a new bottling facility at the Wild Turkey Distillery. For the previous 13 years Wild Turkey had been bottled offsite in Indiana and, later, Arkansas. In addition to the Wild Turkey products, Campari&#x27;s SKYY vodka is also bottled there after being shipped from the Illinois distillery.

==Production==
Wild Turkey uses a mash consisting of a relatively lower percentage of corn than most bourbons and attempts are made to counteract the alkaline environment of the company&#x27;s limestone-rich water. Additionally, the raw whiskey is distilled to about 55% alcohol by volume, much lower than the legally allowed maximum to be considered bourbon. Barrels used to be rotated in open houses (Rick House) to allow more even maturation, being aged until at least one third of the contents are lost to evaporation before they are considered for bottling.

==Products==
The Lawrenceburg distillery bottles its bourbon and rye under the brands of &quot;Wild Turkey&quot; and &quot;Russell&#x27;s Reserve&quot;.

===Awards===

In 2012, Wild Turkey 101 earned an &#x27;Editor&#x27;s Choice&#x27; award from &quot;Whisky Magazine&quot;. An aggregator from various &quot;expert&quot; body reviews places the 101 Single Barrel in the 97th percentile of all rated bourbons.

==Advertising campaigns==
===&quot;Give &#x27;em the Bird&quot; ===
In 2011, an advertisement video called &quot;Give &#x27;em the Bird&quot; was featured on the product&#x27;s web site, Facebook page, and YouTube page that prominently included a middle finger gesture and referred to other (non-existing) advertising videos featuring a nun and an adult blow-up doll.
In August 2011, the review board of the Distilled Spirits Council of the United States (DISCUS), of which Campari USA is a member, ruled that the advertisement violated the council&#x27;s code of ethical practices and said that &quot;the gesture is indecent and the advertisement fails to meet contemporary standards of good taste&quot;. According to DISCUS, the company disagreed with the board&#x27;s interpretation but agreed to withdraw the advertisement.

Since then, the company has continued to use the &quot;Give &#x27;em the Bird&quot; slogan and middle finger gesturing in additional advertising and promotional activities. In November 2012, Jimmy Russell, the Wild Turkey Master Distiller, publicly called for U.S. President Barack Obama to &quot;Give us the bird&quot;, as a way of offering to provide a home for that year&#x27;s White House Thanksgiving Day turkey (which is traditionally &quot;pardoned&quot; by the president) – saying the turkey would become the brand&#x27;s official &quot;spokesbird&quot;.

===Matthew McConaughey ===
In 2016, Matthew McConaughey was hired as creative director and celebrity spokesman for Wild Turkey&#x27;s latest campaign, to bring in more women and international customers.

<text>Irvin Shortess &quot;Shorty&quot; Yeaworth Jr. (February 14, 1926 – July 19, 2004) was a German-born American film director, producer, screenwriter and theme park builder. He began his career singing at age 10 at KDKA in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. He later became a radio producer. He directed more than 400 films for motivational, educational, and religious purposes, including television specials for evangelist Billy Graham. As an impresario, he directed the Wayne (Pa.) Concert Series from 1979 to 2003. However, he is best known for directing the classic film &quot;The Blob&quot; which depicts a growing, devouring alien slime.

He was married to Jean Yeaworth for 59 years, and the two had five children together. Jean worked on most of his films as music supervisor or writer, including &quot;The Blob&quot;. She died in 2019.

In the 1970s Yeaworth began leading American Christians on tours of Israel and Jordan which he continued to do up until his death in 2004. While in these countries he designed and produced World&#x27;s Fair and theme park pavilions for local enterprises. At the time of his death in a road accident, he was building a theme park called Jordanian Experience at the Aqaba Gateway.

In 2007, The Colonial Theatre in Phoenixville, Pennsylvania (the filming location of the famous &quot;Running Out&quot; scene in &quot;The Blob&quot;) honored Irvin Yeaworth and &quot;The Blob&quot; by holding a film contest in which amateur film-makers competed for the &quot;Shorty&quot; award, named after Yeaworth&#x27;s nickname.
