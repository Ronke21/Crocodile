<text>Dames is a 1934 Warner Bros. musical comedy film directed by Ray Enright with dance numbers created by Busby Berkeley. The film stars Ruby Keeler, Dick Powell, Joan Blondell, Guy Kibbee, ZaSu Pitts, and Hugh Herbert. Production numbers and songs include &quot;When You Were a Smile on Your Mother&#x27;s Lips (and a Twinkle in Your Daddy&#x27;s Eye)&quot;, &quot;The Girl at the Ironing Board&quot;, &quot;I Only Have Eyes for You&quot;, &quot;Dames&quot; and &quot;Try to See It My Way&quot;.

==Plot==
Eccentric multimillionaire Ezra Ounce (Hugh Herbert), whose main purpose in life is raising American morals through a nationwide campaign, wants to be assured that his fortune will be inherited by upstanding relatives. He visits his cousin Matilda Hemingway (ZaSu Pitts) in New York City, in Horace&#x27;s view the center of immorality in America. What Ounce finds most offensive are musical comedy shows and the people who put them on, and it just so happens that Matilda&#x27;s daughter Barbara (Ruby Keeler) is a dancer and singer in love with a struggling singer and songwriter, her 13th cousin, Jimmy Higgens (Dick Powell). On Ezra&#x27;s instructions, Jimmy the &quot;black sheep&quot; has been ostracized by the family, on pain of not receiving their inheritance.

Matilda&#x27;s husband Horace (Guy Kibbee) meets a showgirl named Mabel (Joan Blondell), who&#x27;s been stranded in Troy when her show folds, and connives her way into sleeping in Horace&#x27;s train compartment as a way to get back home. Terrified of scandal, he leaves her some money and his business card, along with a note telling her to not mention their meeting to anyone; but when Mabel discovers that Horace is Barbara&#x27;s father, she blackmails him into backing Jimmy&#x27;s show.

==Cast==
===Supporting cast===
===Cast notes===
* Songwriter Sammy Fain, who contributed to the music used in the film, has a small role as Buttercup Balmer, a songwriter. This character&#x27;s name, along with Johnny Harris, came from two men who owned movie theatres in Pennsylvania - this was done at the behest of producer Hal Wallis.
* Veteran bit-part actor Milton Kibbee, brother of Guy Kibbee, has a bit-part as a reporter.
* Jean Rogers, who later played Dale Arden, Flash Gordon&#x27;s girlfriend, in 1930s serials, is in the chorus.

==Musical numbers==
The musical sequences in &quot;Dames&quot; were designed, staged and directed by Busby Berkeley - the Warner Bros. publicity office invented the phrase &quot;cinematerpsichorean&quot; to describe Berkeley&#x27;s creations. By this time, after the success of &quot;42nd Street&quot;, &quot;Footlight Parade&quot; and &quot;Gold Diggers of 1933&quot;, Berkeley had his own unit at Warners under his total control as supervised by producer Hal Wallis.

* &quot;Dames&quot; - by Harry Warren (music) and Al Dubin (lyrics)
* &quot;I Only Have Eyes for You&quot; - by Harry Warren (music) and Al Dubin (lyrics). At one point in this number, sung by Dick Powell to Ruby Keeler, all the girls in the chorus wear Ruby Keeler masks as they move around the stage, but in just about every shot, the &quot;real&quot; Keeler passes by the camera briefly. In 1989, this song won an ASCAP Award as the &quot;Most Performed Feature Film Standard&quot;.
* &quot;The Girl at the Ironing Board&quot; - by Harry Warren (music) and Al Dubin (lyrics). Joan Blondell was seven months pregnant at the time this number was filmed, and care had to be taken by her husband, cinematographer George Barnes, not to show her condition. Also, at one point in the number, a property man can be seen in the background, hanging up clotheslines.
* &quot;When You Were a Smile on Your Mother&#x27;s Lips and a Twinkle in Your Daddy&#x27;s Eye&quot; by Sammy Fain (music) and Irving Kahal lyrics
* &quot;Try to See It My Way&quot; - by Allie Wrubel (music) and Mort Dixon (lyrics)

One of the effects of the Production Code on this film is a musical number that never made it to the screen. Berkeley had planned one featuring Joan Blondell about a fight between a cat and a mouse that ended with Blondell inviting everyone to &quot;come up and see my pussy sometime&quot;. Producer Hal Wallis removed this number from the script before it even got to the censors of the Hays Office.

==Production==
The director originally slated to do the film was Archie Mayo, and then a second director, before Ray Enright got the job a week before filming began. Some early casting considerations had Ruth Donnelly playing Mathilda instead of ZaSu Pitts, and Hobart Cavanaugh as Ellsworthy Todd. At one point, it was suggested that Eleanor Powell do a specialty number, but she declined to do so.

&quot;Dames&quot; began production at the Warner Bros. studios in Burbank, California on March 28, 1934. Ray Enright completed the dramatic scenes in mid-April of that year, and Busby Berkeley continued working on the musical numbers until July 3. The film had its premiere on August 16, 1934 and went into general release on September 1 of that year.

==Box office==
According to Warner Bros., the film earned $1,057,000 in the U.S. and $456,000 in other markets.

==Accolades==
The film is recognized by American Film Institute in these lists:
* 2006: AFI&#x27;s Greatest Movie Musicals – Nominated

<doc id="923533" wikidata="Q2926445" url="?curid=923533" title="Bruce McCulloch">
<text>Bruce Ian McCulloch (born May 12, 1961) is a Canadian actor, comedian, writer, musician and film director. McCulloch is best known for his work as a member of the comedy troupe The Kids in the Hall, including starring in the TV series of the same name. He was also a writer for &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; for one season, 1985-1986. McCulloch has appeared on other series including &quot;Twitch City&quot; and &quot;Gilmore Girls&quot;. He directed the films &quot;Dog Park&quot;, &quot;Stealing Harvard&quot; and &quot;Superstar&quot;.

He also wrote and directed the romantic comedy &quot;Comeback Season,&quot; which toured film festivals before its release on DVD in 2007. He was the creator and head writer of the 2007-2008 ABC sitcom &quot;Carpoolers&quot;.

== Early life ==
McCulloch was born in Edmonton, Alberta, on May 12, 1961. He attended Strathcona Composite High School in Edmonton and competed in both track-and-field and swimming, winning two individual provincial titles. He moved to Calgary and attended Dr. E.P. Scarlett High School. McCulloch is a graduate of Mount Royal University in Calgary. He got his start in performing sketch comedy in a troupe called The Audience, where he met longtime friend and collaborator Mark McKinney.

== Career ==

=== The Kids in the Hall ===
As a member of The Kids in the Hall comedy troupe, McCulloch starred in the 1989-1995 sketch comedy series &quot;The Kids in the Hall&quot;, which aired for five seasons in Canada and the United States. For the show, he frequently wrote surreal monologues, films and songs. He also directed several of the filmed sketches. Memorable characters included the Flying Pig, Cabbage Head, talkative schoolchild Gavin, pop starlet Tammy, secretary Kathie, and grumpy middle-aged man Gordon.

McCulloch appeared in the Kids in the Hall&#x27;s movie &quot;Kids in the Hall: Brain Candy&quot;, released in 1996. McCulloch drew controversy with his Cancer Boy character, introduced on the series&#x27; final episode, in which he plays a dying young cancer patient who relates otherwise depressing news, in monotone, with a cheerful smile, and even releases a hit single entitled &quot;Whistle When You&#x27;re Low.&quot; Paramount Pictures fought to edit out the offending scenes, yet they were kept in. Among other characters, McCulloch also appeared as Grivo, a depressed rock star who becomes upbeat when he starts taking the drug.

He co-wrote, starred in, and was executive producer of the Kids in the Hall 2010 reunion project &quot;Death Comes to Town&quot;.

=== Music ===
McCulloch has released two albums: 1995&#x27;s &quot;Shame-Based Man,&quot; produced by Bob Wiseman (praised by AllMusic as the &quot;most remarkable of comedy albums: one that bears (frequent) repeated listenings&quot;) and 2002&#x27;s &quot;Drunk Baby Project&quot;. He released a video for the song &quot;The Daves I Know&quot;.

McCulloch also directed the music video for the Tragically Hip&#x27;s song &quot;My Music at Work,&quot; for which he won the award of &quot;Best Director&quot; at the 2000 MuchMusic Video Awards. McCulloch was close friends with Tragically Hip frontman Gord Downie. The video shares much in common with many &quot;The Kids in the Hall&quot; sketches, including its office setting, camera angles, and some thematic elements. McCulloch also starred in and co-directed the music video for 1997&#x27;s &quot;Make You Mad&quot; by the Canadian band Odds.

=== Movies ===
McCulloch played Fred Wright in the 1987 TV mini-series &quot;Anne of Avonlea&quot;. He also had a role in the 1999 comedy film &quot;Dick&quot;.

McCulloch also co-wrote and had a bit part in &quot;Superman&#x27;s 50th Anniversary: A Celebration of the Man of Steel&quot; (1988). In the CBS prime-time special (also featuring Dana Carvey, Al Franken, Jan Hooks, and others), he played a patron of a store that, among other things, sold counterfeit Kryptonite. He also played a Royal Canadian Mounted Police officer in the movie &quot;Super Troopers 2&quot;.

=== Publishing ===
McCulloch&#x27;s memoir -- &quot;Let&#x27;s Start a Riot: How a Young Drunk Punk Became a Hollywood Dad&quot; () -- was published by HarperCollins in 2014.

===Television===
McCulloch played the judge in &quot;To Kill a Chupacabraj&quot; in season 3 of &quot;Workaholics&quot;, Father Marsala in season 4 of &quot;Arrested Development&quot;, and Tobin on &quot;Gilmore Girls&quot;. He created and starred in the sitcom &quot;Young Drunk Punk&quot;, which debuted in 2015, and wrote and played a small part in the 2018 web series &quot;This Blows&quot;.

In 2019, he signed on as a producer of the Canadian sketch comedy series &quot;TallBoyz&quot;. In 2023, he was an executive producer of the sketch comedy series &quot;The Dessert&quot;.

==Commemorative coins==

The Republic, just like the other European states who have the right to issue euro coins, issues commemorative coins, of which the most notable denomination is €2. The Republic has also issued commemorative euro coins in other denominations, such as the 2014 €5 coin dedicated to three-time Formula One World Champion Ayrton Senna in 2014, being 20 years from Senna&#x27;s fatal crash at the San Marino Grand Prix. This coin was also complemented by a commemorative €2.50 stamp.

<text>In mathematics, specifically in homotopy theory, a classifying space &quot;BG&quot; of a topological group &quot;G&quot; is the quotient of a weakly contractible space &quot;EG&quot; (i.e., a topological space all of whose homotopy groups are trivial) by a proper free action of &quot;G&quot;. It has the property that any &quot;G&quot; principal bundle over a paracompact manifold is isomorphic to a pullback of the principal bundle formula_1. As explained later, this means that classifying spaces represent a set-valued functor on the homotopy category of topological spaces. The term classifying space can also be used for spaces that represent a set-valued functor on the category of topological spaces, such as Sierpiński space. This notion is generalized by the notion of classifying topos. However, the rest of this article discusses the more commonly used notion of classifying space up to homotopy. 

For a discrete group &quot;G&quot;, &quot;BG&quot; is a path-connected topological space &quot;X&quot; such that the fundamental group of &quot;X&quot; is isomorphic to &quot;G&quot; and the higher homotopy groups of &quot;X&quot; are trivial; that is, &quot;BG&quot; is an Eilenberg–MacLane space, specifically a &quot;K&quot;(&quot;G&quot;, 1).

==Motivation==
An example of a classifying space for the infinite cyclic group &quot;G&quot; is the circle as &quot;X&quot;. When &quot;G&quot; is a discrete group, another way to specify the condition on &quot;X&quot; is that the universal cover &quot;Y&quot; of &quot;X&quot; is contractible. In that case the projection map

:formula_2

becomes a fiber bundle with structure group &quot;G&quot;, in fact a principal bundle for &quot;G&quot;. The interest in the classifying space concept really arises from the fact that in this case &quot;Y&quot; has a universal property with respect to principal &quot;G&quot;-bundles, in the homotopy category. This is actually more basic than the condition that the higher homotopy groups vanish: the fundamental idea is, given &quot;G&quot;, to find such a contractible space &quot;Y&quot; on which &quot;G&quot; acts &quot;freely&quot;. (The weak equivalence idea of homotopy theory relates the two versions.) In the case of the circle example, what is being said is that we remark that an infinite cyclic group &quot;C&quot; acts freely on the real line &quot;R&quot;, which is contractible. Taking &quot;X&quot; as the quotient space circle, we can regard the projection π from &quot;R&quot; = &quot;Y&quot; to &quot;X&quot; as a helix in geometrical terms, undergoing projection from three dimensions to the plane. What is being claimed is that π has a universal property amongst principal &quot;C&quot;-bundles; that any principal &quot;C&quot;-bundle in a definite way &#x27;comes from&#x27; π.

==Formalism==
A more formal statement takes into account that &quot;G&quot; may be a topological group (not simply a &quot;discrete group&quot;), and that group actions of &quot;G&quot; are taken to be continuous; in the absence of continuous actions the classifying space concept can be dealt with, in homotopy terms, via the Eilenberg–MacLane space construction. In homotopy theory the definition of a topological space &quot;BG&quot;, the classifying space for principal &quot;G&quot;-bundles, is given, together with the space &quot;EG&quot; which is the total space of the universal bundle over &quot;BG&quot;. That is, what is provided is in fact a continuous mapping

:formula_3

Assume that the homotopy category of CW complexes is the underlying category, from now on. The &quot;classifying&quot; property required of &quot;BG&quot; in fact relates to π. We must be able to say that given any principal &quot;G&quot;-bundle

:formula_4

over a space &quot;Z&quot;, there is a classifying map φ from &quot;Z&quot; to &quot;BG&quot;, such that formula_5 is the pullback of π along φ. In less abstract terms, the construction of formula_5 by &#x27;twisting&#x27; should be reducible via φ to the twisting already expressed by the construction of π.

For this to be a useful concept, there evidently must be some reason to believe such spaces &quot;BG&quot; exist. The early work on classifying spaces introduced constructions (for example, the bar construction), that gave concrete descriptions of &quot;BG&quot; as a simplicial complex for an arbitrary discrete group. Such constructions make evident the connection with group cohomology. 

Specifically, let &quot;EG&quot; be the weak simplicial complex whose &quot;n-&quot; simplices are the ordered (&quot;n&quot;+1)-tuples formula_7 of elements of &quot;G&quot;. Such an &quot;n-&quot;simplex attaches to the (n−1) simplices formula_8 in the same way a standard simplex attaches to its faces, where formula_9 means this vertex is deleted. The complex EG is contractible. The group &quot;G&quot; acts on &quot;EG&quot; by left multiplication, 
:formula_10 
and only the identity &quot;e&quot; takes any simplex to itself. Thus the action of &quot;G&quot; on &quot;EG&quot; is a covering space action and the quotient map formula_11 is the universal cover of the orbit space formula_12, and &quot;BG&quot; is a formula_13.

In abstract terms (which are not those originally used around 1950 when the idea was first introduced) this is a question of whether a certain functor is representable: the contravariant functor from the homotopy category to the category of sets, defined by

:&quot;h&quot;(&quot;Z&quot;) = set of isomorphism classes of principal &quot;G&quot;-bundles on &quot;Z.&quot;

The abstract conditions being known for this (Brown&#x27;s representability theorem) ensure that the result, as an existence theorem, is affirmative and not too difficult.

==Examples==
#The circle formula_14 is a classifying space for the infinite cyclic group formula_15 The total space is formula_16
#The &quot;n&quot;-torus formula_17 is a classifying space for formula_18, the free abelian group of rank &quot;n&quot;. The total space is formula_19
#The wedge of &quot;n&quot; circles is a classifying space for the free group of rank &quot;n&quot;. 
#A closed (that is, compact and without boundary) connected surface &quot;S&quot; of genus at least 1 is a classifying space for its fundamental group formula_20
#A closed (that is, compact and without boundary) connected hyperbolic manifold &quot;M&quot; is a classifying space for its fundamental group formula_21.
#A finite locally connected CAT(0) cubical complex is a classifying space of its fundamental group.
#The infinite-dimensional projective space formula_22 (the direct limit of finite-dimensional projective spaces) is a classifying space for the cyclic group formula_23 The total space is formula_24 (the direct limit of spheres formula_25 Alternatively, one may use Hilbert space with the origin removed; it is contractible).
#The space formula_26 is the classifying space for the cyclic group formula_27 Here, formula_28 is understood to be a certain subset of the infinite dimensional Hilbert space formula_29 with the origin removed; the cyclic group is considered to act on it by multiplication with roots of unity.
#The unordered configuration space formula_30 is the classifying space of the Artin braid group formula_31, and the ordered configuration space formula_32 is the classifying space for the pure Artin braid group formula_33
#The (unordered) configuration space formula_34 is a classifying space for the symmetric group formula_35 
#The infinite dimensional complex projective space formula_36 is the classifying space for the circle thought of as a compact topological group.
#The Grassmannian formula_37 of &quot;n&quot;-planes in formula_38 is the classifying space of the orthogonal group . The total space is formula_39, the Stiefel manifold of &quot;n&quot;-dimensional orthonormal frames in formula_40

==Applications==
This still leaves the question of doing effective calculations with &quot;BG&quot;; for example, the theory of characteristic classes is essentially the same as computing the cohomology groups of &quot;BG&quot;, at least within the restrictive terms of homotopy theory, for interesting groups &quot;G&quot; such as Lie groups (H. Cartan&#x27;s theorem). As was shown by the Bott periodicity theorem, the homotopy groups of &quot;BG&quot; are also of fundamental interest. 

An example of a classifying space is that when &quot;G&quot; is cyclic of order two; then &quot;BG&quot; is real projective space of infinite dimension, corresponding to the observation that &quot;EG&quot; can be taken as the contractible space resulting from removing the origin in an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space, with &quot;G&quot; acting via &quot;v&quot; going to −&quot;v&quot;, and allowing for homotopy equivalence in choosing &quot;BG&quot;. This example shows that classifying spaces may be complicated.

In relation with differential geometry (Chern–Weil theory) and the theory of Grassmannians, a much more hands-on approach to the theory is possible for cases such as the unitary groups that are of greatest interest. The construction of the Thom complex &quot;MG&quot; showed that the spaces &quot;BG&quot; were also implicated in cobordism theory, so that they assumed a central place in geometric considerations coming out of algebraic topology. Since group cohomology can (in many cases) be defined by the use of classifying spaces, they can also be seen as foundational in much homological algebra.

Generalizations include those for classifying foliations, and the classifying toposes for logical theories of the predicate calculus in intuitionistic logic that take the place of a &#x27;space of models&#x27;.

<doc id="923559" wikidata="Q275787" url="?curid=923559" title="Vatican euro coins">
<text>Vatican euro coins are issued by the Philatelic and Numismatic Office of the Vatican City State and minted by Istituto Poligrafico e Zecca dello Stato (IPZS), in Rome, Italy. The euro is the official currency of the Vatican City, although Vatican City is not a member of the Eurozone or the European Union. The euro has been the official currency of Vatican City since 2002. Before that, the Vatican lira was the official currency.

==Vatican euro design==
For images of the common side and a detailed description of the coins, see euro coins.

===First series (2002–2005)===
The initial series of Vatican euro coins featured an effigy of Pope John Paul II. They were issued only in collector sets and bore an extreme markup with the 2002 collector set costing well over a thousand euro.

===Second series (2005)===
Following the death of Pope John Paul II in April 2005, Vatican City issued special coins during the period of Sede vacante depicting the emblem of the Apostolic Chamber (i.e. two crossed keys beneath an umbraculum, or umbrella) and the coat of arms of the Camerlengo of the Holy Roman Church, at the time Cardinal Eduardo Martínez Somalo.

===Third series (2006–2013)===
When the new pope was elected, the third series of Vatican euro coins were issued on 27 April 2006 and feature the effigy of Pope Benedict XVI. The coins carry an inscription &quot;Città del Vaticano&quot; and the twelve stars of Europe. The details of this design are published in the Official Journal of the European Union.

===Fourth series (2014–2016)===
A series of Vatican euro coins featuring effigies of Pope Francis was released in March 2014. Three different images of Francis were used.

===Fifth series (2017–present)===
As a result of Pope Francis no longer permitting that his effigies be used on coins, starting March 2017, the eight denominations of Vatican euro coins no longer bore the Pope&#x27;s image and now feature his papal coat of arms.

==Circulating Mintage quantities==
==Future changes to national sides==
The Commission of the European Communities issued a recommendation on 19 December 2008, a common guideline for the national sides and the issuance of euro coins intended for circulation. One section of this recommendation stipulates that:

:Article 5. Changes to the national sides of regular euro coins intended for circulation:
::&quot;... the designs used for the national sides of the euro coins intended for circulation denominated in euro or in cent should not be modified, except in cases where the Head of State referred to on a coin changes ... A temporary vacancy or the provisional occupation of the function of Head of State should not give the right to change the national sides of the regular euro coins intended for circulation.&quot;

This change means that there will be no more &quot;Sede Vacante&quot; series of the &quot;regular&quot; Vatican euro coins, although the issue of &quot;commemorative&quot; &quot;Sede Vacante&quot; series (usually gold and silver coins), having legal tender in Vatican City only, remains possible. Circulating €2 commemorative Sede Vacante coins would also be possible, if the Sede Vacante period occurs in a year in which Vatican City has not already released two €2 commemorative coins of another subject. Such a coin was indeed minted for the Sede Vacante of 2013.

<doc id="923562" wikidata="Q2893092" url="?curid=923562" title="USS George Washington (1798)">
<text>The first USS &quot;George Washington&quot; was a frigate in the United States Navy. She was named after United States Founding Father and President George Washington.

&quot;George Washington&quot; was built as a merchant vessel at Providence, R.I., in 1793; purchased by the Congress at Providence 12 October 1798 from John Brown and John Francis for $10,400 in cash and $30,000 in 6 percent navy stock, for use in the developing undeclared naval war (the so-called Quasi-War) with France, and converted to a warship under the supervision of Captain Silas Talbot with Captain Patrick Fletcher in command.

==Service==
&quot;George Washington&quot; proceeded in early December to Dominica, in the West Indies, to join Commodore John Barry&#x27;s squadron for the protection of American commercial against the many French privateer&#x27;s preying on US shipping and commerce. She rendezvoused with Barry in the and the USS &quot;Constitution&quot; at sea 29 December and arrived Dominica next day. For the next few months, she convoyed Americas in the West Indies, sailing from St. Christopher&#x27;s Island to Tobago. During this time, with revenue cutter Pickering, she recaptured two American ships from the French: the brig &quot;Fair American&quot; 29 April 1799, and the schooner &quot;Francis&quot; on 1 May 1799. &quot;Francis&quot; was Captained by Joshua Preble, Lieutenant Edward Preble&#x27;s brother (Capt. of USRC Pickering).

She departed the Caribbean in mid-1799, arriving Newport, Rhode Island, 12 June 1799, and after a short stay sailed again 2 July. Secretary of the Navy Benjamin Stoddert considered her a dull sailer so she wasn&#x27;t sent back to the Caribbean immediately, instead on this cruise, she searched the coast for French privateers as far south as Charleston, S.C., and then took station off Santo Domingo protecting American commerce. The &quot;George Washington&quot; returned to the United States, in October 1799, for extensive repairs. On 19 October 1799, she arrived at and was ordered to sail from Marcus Hook to Newport, Rhode Island where her current crew was to be discharged. Extensive repairs were done to her bottom &amp; her bottom was recoppered.

She was taken to Philadelphia in April 1800 and there was outfitted and prepared for sea. In May 1800, Captain William Bainbridge was given command of the &quot;George Washington&quot;. She sailed from Newport on 13 June. Lacking a strong navy, the United States accepted the questionable alternative of trying to protect its commerce from the Barbary pirates by paying an annual tribute (extortion). Bainbridge sailed with a load of stores and timber for the Dey of Algiers on 8 August. The &quot;George Washington&quot; arrived safely 17 September, the first American warship to enter the Mediterranean. However, the ship did not contain enough tribute to satisfy the Dey&#x27;s demands. The Dey demanded the use of the ship and its crew, claiming he owned them since they pay tribute. Unhappily, Bainbridge had to accede to threats and carry the Dey&#x27;s presents to the Sultan at Constantinople. He protested vigorously but, in the face of concentrated guns ashore and credible threats of retaliation against American shipping, plus threats of seizure, enslavement, and a state of war between the U.S. and Algiers if demands weren&#x27;t met, he departed 19 October. She arrived at Constantinople on 11 November, 1800. She departed Constantinople on 30 December. She returned to Algiers on 21 January 1801, departing 31 January, and after a visit to Alicant arrived back in the United States on 19 April 1801. In a letter dated 20 February to Josiah Parker, chairman of the Committee on Naval Affairs, Navy Secretary Stoddert recommended selling her. On 4 May 1801, Captain William Bainbridge was relieved of command, and was succeeded by Lt. John Shaw as her Captain.

The ship underwent repairs and was again fitted to carry stores and timber to Algiers. Manned with only a partial crew and reduced armament, she sailed 20 July 1801, escorting the merchantman &quot;Peace &amp; Plenty&quot;, both loaded with goods from the U. S. government for the Bey of Tunis, and arrived in Algiers via Málaga, Spain, on 5 October 1801. After calling at Italian and French ports, she returned to Philadelphia about 15 April 1802. &quot;George Washington&quot; was sold in May 1802 by the Navy agent in Philadelphia, George Harrison.

<doc id="923564" wikidata="Q5085664" url="?curid=923564" title="Charlie Waller (American musician)">
<text>Charles Otis Waller (January 19, 1935 – August 18, 2004) was the lead singer and guitarist for the bluegrass band The Country Gentlemen. Waller was involved with The Country Gentlemen for 47 years. As a member of The Country Gentlemen, Waller was inducted into the International Bluegrass Music Hall of Honor in 1996 and the Southern Gospel Museum and Hall of Fame in 2009.

==Biography==
Waller was born in Joinerville, Texas and moved to Lake Charles, Louisiana at the age of 2 with his family. He began to play guitar at the age of 10 and moved with his mother to Baltimore, Maryland. In 1952, Waller joined Earl Taylor&#x27;s bluegrass band, the Stoney Mountain Boys. He returned to Louisiana in 1956 as a guitar player with Buzz Busby and the Bayou Boys, making appearances on television. In 1957 he and Busby returned to the Washington, D.C. area, where Waller met mandolinist John Duffey and banjo player Bill Emerson. When Busby was injured in an auto accident in July 1957, Emerson formed a temporary band with Waller and Duffey to fulfill Busby&#x27;s bookings. The temporary band soon became permanent, and The Country Gentlemen would continue for more than fifty years.

The Country Gentlemen achieved fame across the United States and internationally even touring Japan in 1971. While more than 100 musicians have been members at one time, Waller was always an original member of the group and has many famous songs to his credit. Waller was held in high regard for his singing ability especially on songs like Legend of the Rebel Soldier, Two Little Boys, House of the Rising Sun and many others. Though Charlie usually played rhythm guitar, he flatpicked lead on some songs such as Under the Double Eagle, Spanish Two Step and Electricity among others. The band released a new album, &quot;Songs of the American Spirit&quot;, in September 2004.

On August 18, 2004 Charlie Waller suffered a heart attack at his Gordonsville, Virginia home. A month before his death Charlie Waller told his bus driver, Kenny Wurzburger, that he had a pain in his liver. An autopsy would reveal that Charlie was in the early stages of liver cancer at the time of his death.

<doc id="923575" wikidata="Q47328" url="?curid=923575" title="Gryllidae">
<text>The family Gryllidae contains the subfamilies and genera which entomologists now term true [[Cricket (insect)|crickets]]. Having long, whip-like antennae, they belong to the Orthopteran suborder Ensifera, which has been greatly reduced in the last 100 years (&quot;e.g.&quot; Imms): taxa such as the tree crickets, spider-crickets and their allies, sword-tail crickets, wood or ground crickets and scaly crickets have been moved or elevated to family level. The type genus is &quot;Gryllus&quot; and the first use of the family name &quot;Gryllidae&quot; was by Francis Walker.

They have a worldwide distribution (except Antarctica). The most familiar field crickets (Gryllinae) are characteristically robust brown or black insects; the largest members of the family are the -long bull crickets (&quot;Brachytrupes&quot;) which excavate burrows a metre or more deep. 
== Subfamilies ==
The family is divided into these subfamily groups, subfamilies, and extinct genera (not placed within any subfamily):
* Subfamily group Gryllinae – common or field crickets
** Gryllinae (now includes Sclerogryllini )
** Gryllomiminae monotypic: &quot;Gryllomimus&quot; (Africa)
** Gryllomorphinae 
** †Gryllospeculinae 
***†&quot;Araripegryllus&quot; Martins-Neto 1987 Crato Formation, Brazil, Aptian ?Weald Clay, United Kingdom, Hauterivian
***†&quot;Brontogryllus&quot; Martins-Neto 1991 Crato Formation, Brazil, Aptian
***†&quot;Gryllospeculum&quot; Gorochov 1985 Dzun-Bain Formation, Mongolia, Aptian
***†&quot;Mongolospeculum&quot; Gorochov 1985 Dzun-Bain Formation, Mongolia, Aptian
***†&quot;Proararipegryllus&quot; Gorochov &amp; Coram, 2022
** Gryllinae &quot;incertae sedis&quot;
# &quot;Capillogryllus&quot; 
# †&quot;Cratogryllus&quot; Crato Formation, Brazil, Aptian
# &quot;Neogryllodes&quot; 
# &quot;Rhabdotogryllus&quot; 
# †&quot;Sharovella&quot; 
# &quot;Spinogryllus&quot; 
# †&quot;Trichogryllus&quot; 
** Itarinae 
** Landrevinae 
* Subfamily Eneopterinae – bush crickets (American usage), not to be confused with the Tettigoniidae (katydids or bush crickets)
* Subfamily unplaced: most extinct
** genus †&quot;Achetomorpha&quot; Bembridge Marls, United Kingdom, Priabonian
** genus †&quot;Eneopterotrypus&quot; – monotypic Bembridge Marls, United Kingdom, Priabonian
** genus †&quot;Fanzus&quot; – monotypic Fur Formation, Denmark, Ypresian
** genus †&quot;Gryllidium&quot; 
** genus †&quot;Lithogryllites&quot; Florissant Formation, United States, Eocene
** genus &quot;Menonia&quot; – monotypic &quot;M. cochinensis&quot; (tentative placement)
** genus †&quot;Nanaripegryllus&quot; – monotypic Crato Formation, Brazil, Aptian
** genus †&quot;Pherodactylus&quot; – monotypic Burmese amber, Myanmar, Cenomanian
** genus †&quot;Proeneopterotrypus&quot; – monotypic †&quot;P. danicus&quot; Fur Formation, Denmark, Ypresian

<text>The Camp is the term used in the Falkland Islands to refer to any part of the islands outside the islands&#x27; only significant town, Stanley, and often the large RAF base at Mount Pleasant. It is derived from the Spanish word , for &quot;countryside&quot;.

The Camp contains various small settlements, such as Fox Bay, Goose Green, Darwin, and Port Howard, which are usually little more than several houses. Port Louis in the north of East Falkland is the oldest permanent settlement in the islands, established by the French in 1764. Port Egmont on Saunders Island, now abandoned, is the oldest British settlement. The majority of the Camp population lives on East Falkland, followed by West Falkland. Outlying islands such as Pebble, Sea Lion, West Point, Weddell and Carcass Island are inhabited as well. Camp is used in formal contexts: e.g. the Falkland Islands Legislative Assembly has Stanley and Camp constituencies.

There are also some British military installations such as RAF Mount Pleasant, Mare Harbour, and Mount Alice, and there is also the Bodie Suspension Bridge, the southernmost of its kind in the world. Many parts were landmined from the time of the Falklands War, particularly just outside Stanley. As of November 2020, the Falklands were declared clear of all landmines.

Officially, the Falklands use UTC-3 year-round (before September 2010, only in the summer months), but many residents of Camp use UTC-4 all year, known on the Falklands as &quot;Camp Time&quot;. This caused confusion in 2009 when a team of Royal Engineers working in Hill Cove did not realise West Falkland was on a different time zone from Stanley.

Sheep farming is the main industry. Others include fishing, and tourism, particularly wildlife or war-related tours. The Camp is represented by three members of the Legislative Assembly of the Falkland Islands, currently Teslyn Barkman, John Birmingham and Jack Ford.

<text>The Rohonc Codex () is an illustrated manuscript book by an unknown author, with a text in an unknown language and writing system, that surfaced in Hungary in the early 19th century. The book&#x27;s origin and the meaning of its text and illustrations have been investigated by many scholars and amateurs, with no definitive conclusion, although many Hungarian scholars believe that it is an 18th-century hoax.

The name of the codex is often spelled &#x27;Rohonczi&#x27;, according to the old Hungarian orthography that was reformed in the first half of the 19th century. This spelling has become widespread, likely due to a book published on the codex by V. Enăchiuc in 2002. Today, the name of the codex is often written in Hungarian as .

==History==
The codex was named after the city of Rohonc, in Western Hungary (now Rechnitz, Austria), where it was kept until 1838, when it was donated to the Hungarian Academy of Sciences by Gusztáv Batthyány, a Hungarian count, together with his entire library.

The origin of the codex is unknown. A possible trace of its past may be an entry in the 1743 catalogue of the Batthyánys&#x27; Rohonc library, which reads (&quot;Hungarian prayers in one volume, size duodecimo&quot;). Both the size and the assumed content of the volume described fit the codex, but no further information is given in the catalogue, rendering an exact match to the codex impossible.

==Location and accessibility==
The Rohonc Codex is located in the Library of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences. Special permission is needed to study the codex. However, a microfilm copy is available.

In 2015, the codex was rescanned by Hamburg University, but only eight higher resolution pages were published.

==Features==
The codex has 448 paper pages measuring , with each page having between 9 and 14 rows of symbols, which may or may not be letters. Besides the text, there are 87 illustrations that include religious, laic, and military scenes. The crude illustrations seem to indicate an environment where Christian, pagan, and Muslim religions coexist, as the symbols of the cross, crescent, and sun/swastika are all present.

The number of symbols used in the codex is about ten times higher than any known alphabet, with Némäti (1889) having counted 792, but most symbols are used with little repetition, so the symbols in the codex might not be an alphabet, but instead a syllabary, or be logographic in nature, such as Chinese characters. The justification of the right margin would seem to imply the symbols were written from right to left.

Study of the paper on which the codex is written shows that it is most probably a Venetian paper made in the 1530s. This does not provide certainty as to the date of the text, however, since it may have been transcribed from an earlier source, or the paper could have been used long after it was produced. Taking a clue from the illustrations, Láng speculates it was most likely created sometime in the 16th-17th centuries.

==Analysis==
As the existence of the codex has become more widely known, since the 19th Century, the codex has been studied by many scholars and amateurs. However, there is no widely accepted and convincing translation or interpretation of the text.

=== Language hypotheses ===
No hypothesis as to the language of the codex has been backed as a universal solution, though a number – such as Hungarian, Dacian, early Romanian or Cuman, and even Hindi – have been proposed.

In 1892, Némäti discussed the codex&#x27;s authenticity to the Hungarian language and the possibility that it is a paleo-Hungarian script. It has been proposed that there are resemblances to the Old Hungarian script, also referred to as &#x27;Hungarian runes&#x27; (). 

In 2004, Singh and Bárdi discussed the possibly of it being a version of the Brahmi script.

It has been proposed that similar characters or symbols are engraved in the caves of the Scythian monks in the Dobruja region of Romania. It has also been proposed that there is a resemblance of some letters of the Greek charter of the Veszprémvölgy Nunnery (Hungary). 

=== 19th Century ===
The codex was studied by Hungarian scholar Ferenc Toldy around 1840, and later by Pál Hunfalvy and by Austrian paleography expert Albert Mahl. Josef Jireček and his son, Konstantin Josef Jireček, both university professors in Prague, studied 32 pages of the codex in 1884–1885. In 1885, the codex was sent to Bernhard Jülg, a professor at Innsbruck University. Mihály Munkácsy, the celebrated Hungarian painter, also took the codex with him to Paris in the years 1890–1892 to study it.

In 1866, Hungarian historian Károly Szabó (1824–1890) proposed that the codex was a hoax by Sámuel Literáti Nemes (1796–1842), a Transylvanian-Hungarian antiquarian, and co-founder of the National Széchényi Library in Budapest. Nemes is known to have created many historical forgeries (mostly made in the 1830s) which deceived even some of the most renowned Hungarian scholars of the time. Since then, this opinion of forgery has been maintained by mainstream Hungarian scholarship, even though there is no evidence connecting the codex to Nemes specifically.

=== Systematic and computer analysis ===
A strictly methodical investigation of the symbols was first done in 1970 by Ottó Gyürk, who examined repeated sequences to find the direction of writing, arguing for a right-to-left, top-to-bottom order, with pages also ordered right-to-left; Gyürk also identified numbers in the text. His later remarks suggest that he also has many unpublished conjectures, based on a large amount of statistical data.

Miklós Locsmándi did some computer-based research on the text in the mid-1990s. His research findings were consistent with the work published by Gyürk. Locsmándi added several others conjectures. 

He claimed the symbol &quot;i&quot; to be a sentence delimiter (but also the symbol of 11 (eleven), and possibly also a place value delimiter in numbers). He studied the diacritics of the symbols (mostly dots), but found no peculiar system in their usage. As he could see no traces of case endings (which are typically characteristic to the Hungarian language), he assumed that the text was probably in a language different from Hungarian. He could not prove that the codex is not a hoax; however, seeing the regularities of the text, he rejected that it be pure gibberish.

===Sumero-Hungarian hypothesis===
Attila Nyíri of Hungary proposed a solution in 1996 after studying two pages of the codex. He turned the pages upside down, identified a Sumerian ligature, and then associated Latin alphabet letters to the rest of the symbols by resemblance. However, he sometimes transliterated the same symbol with different letters, and conversely, the same letter was decoded from several symbols. Even then he had to rearrange the order of the letters to produce meaningful words.

The text, if taken as meaningful, is of religious, perhaps liturgical character. Its beginning, according to Nyíri, reads:

Nyíri&#x27;s proposition was immediately criticised by Ottó Gyürk, pointing to the fact that with such a permissive deciphering method one can get anything out of the code. Also, the mere fact that Nyíri makes an uncritical allusion to the fringe theory that the Hungarian language descended from Sumerian discredits his enterprise.

===Daco-Romanian hypothesis===
A proposed translation was published in 2002 by Romanian philologist Viorica Enăchiuc. Enăchiuc claimed that the text had been written in the Dacian dialect of vulgar Latin, and the direction of writing is right-to-left, bottom-to-top. The alleged translation indicates that the text is an history of the Blaki (Vlachs) people in their fights against Hungarians and Pechenegs. Toponyms and hydronyms appear as Arad, Dridu, Olbia, Ineu, Rarău, Nistru (Dniester) and Tisa (Tisza). Diplomatic contacts between a certain 11th century &quot;voivode&quot; (prince) named  Vlad and following rulers are also mentioned (regnal years in brackets): Constantine Doukas (1059–1067), Alexios I Komnenos (1081–1118) and Robert of Flanders (which one, Robert I (1071–1093) or Robert II (1093–1111)?).

Quotations from Enăchiuc&#x27;s translation include:

On the one hand, Enăchiuc&#x27;s proposition can be criticized for the method of transliteration. Symbols that characteristically appear in the same context throughout the codex are regularly transliterated with different letters, so that the patterns in the original code are lost in the transliteration. On the other hand, Enăchiuc is criticized as a linguist and historian. She provided the only linguistic source of a hitherto unknown state of the Romanian language, and her text (even with her glossary) raises such serious doubts both in its linguistic and historic authenticity that they render her work unscientific.

There is no relation between the illustrations of the manuscript (of clear Christian content) and Enăchiuc&#x27;s translation.

===Brahmi-Hindi hypothesis===
Another alleged solution was made in 2004 by the Indian Mahesh Kumar Singh. He claims that the codex is written left-to-right, top-to-bottom with a so far undocumented variant of the Brahmi script. He transliterated the first 24 pages of the codex to get a Hindi text which was translated to Hungarian. His solution is mostly like the beginning of an apocryphal gospel (previously unknown), with a meditative prologue, then going on to the infancy narrative of Jesus.

According to Mahesh Kumar Singh, the upper two rows of page 1 read:

Singh&#x27;s attempt was immediately criticized in the next issue of the same journal. His transliteration lacks consistency.

=== 2010 to present ===
Benedek Láng summarized the previous attempts and the possible research directions in a 2010 article and in a 2011 book-sized monograph. He argued that the codex is not a hoax (as opposed to mainstream Hungarian academic opinion), but instead is a consciously encoded or enciphered text. It may be: a cipher, a shorthand system, or a constructed language.

Láng assessed these possibilities systematically in his publications with the help of historical analogies.

In 2010, Gábor Tokai published a series of three short articles in the Hungarian popular science weekly, . Tokai tried to date the codex by finding historical analogies of the imagery of the drawings. Tokai could not rule out the possibility of a hoax, but he (like Locsmándi) insisted that whatever be the case, the text has regularities that strongly suggest a meaning. Several months later Tokai also published two further short articles in which he started to give meaning to specific code chunks. He based his arguments mainly on character strings that appear in pictures (such as the INRI inscription on the cross). He claimed to have identified the codes of the four evangelists in biblical references, built up of an evangelist&#x27;s name and a number, possibly some kind of chapter number. Based on Gyürk&#x27;s and Locsmándi&#x27;s work he also showed that many of the four-digit numbers in the text are year numbers, using presumably a peculiar Anno Mundi epoch.

Simultaneous with, and independently from Tokai, Levente Zoltán Király made significant progress in describing some structural elements of the code. In 2011 he demonstrated a method for cutting down the text into sentences with a good probability. He identified a 7-page section split by numbered headings, with the whole section preceded by its table of contents. Like Tokai, Király also discovered the codes of the four evangelists, and in addition he provided a persuasive argument for a &quot;chapter heading system&quot; in the codex that contains biblical references. He also dealt with the overall structure of the codex, showing that the chapter structure is not present in the first fourth of the book, partly because that part contains the long, continuous narration of the passion of Jesus Christ.

In 2018, Tokai and Király published the paper &quot;Cracking the code of the Rohonc Codex.&quot; The paper claimed the writing was not a substitution cipher, or an ancient alphabet, but is in fact a &#x27;code system&#x27;. According to Tokai and Király, the code system does not indicate the inner structure of words. They claim that the codex contains the date as a probable reference to its writing. They also state that by character it is an ordinary Catholic reader or breviary of the time, mostly containing paraphrases of New Testament texts (primarily from the Gospels), but also some non-Biblical material, like e.g. Seth returning to the gate of Paradise, or prayers to the Virgin Mary.

<text>Eurofurence (commonly abbreviated EF) is a furry convention, initially held in changing places in Europe every year, but staying in Germany since 2004. It was originally started in 1995 as a private gathering by nineteen European furry fans who met on the Internet. Attendance has been steadily rising since then, to 5,241 at Eurofurence 28 (held in 2024), making it the second largest furry convention outside the United States and ninth largest worldwide. The name of the convention derives from its then-contemporary American counterpart ConFurence, emphasising the European nature of the gathering.

Since the year 2000, Eurofurence is no longer organized by individual persons but rather by the German Verein &quot;Eurofurence e.V.&quot;, which serves as an administrative body for the convention.

Contrary to most American furry conventions, Eurofurence traditionally took place at youth hostels. In 2007, Eurofurence was first held at a hotel (the Hotel Ringberg in Suhl).
== Eurofurence by year ==
Below is a table of statistics regarding each year Eurofurence has been held. Since 1999 (possibly except for 6 and 9), the convention has had at least one guest of honour yearly. Since 2002, the convention has had a &quot;theme&quot; every year, with T-shirt designs and venue &quot;dressing&quot; to reflect the theme.


== Main events ==
*Pawpet show - Furry handpuppet story with custom plot, music and effects
* Enter the Arena - Fursuit dance contest
* Big Blue Dance - Disco with live DJ, light effects and live mixed background animations
* Group Photo
* Fursuit parade
* Art Auction - Bidding for art
* Dealers&#x27; Den - Possibility to sell/buy merchandise and art
* DDR Tournament

<doc id="923594" wikidata="Q240389" url="?curid=923594" title="Craniometry">
<text>Craniometry is measurement of the cranium (the main part of the skull), usually the human cranium. It is a subset of cephalometry, measurement of the head, which in humans is a subset of anthropometry, measurement of the human body. It is distinct from phrenology, the pseudoscience that tried to link personality and character to head shape, and physiognomy, which tried the same for facial features. 

Today, physical and forensic anthropologists use craniometry to study the evolution of human populations, determining the origin of ancient remains such as the Kennewick Man.

There is a rift between forensic and biological anthropologists in the use of race in craniometry, with biological anthropologists attempting to disprove any theory of biological race, compared to how many forensic anthropologists make inquiries based on societally-created racial categories. It was once intensively practised in physical anthropology in the 19th and the first part of the 20th century. Theories attempting to scientifically justify the segregation of society based on race became popular at this time, one of their prominent figures being Georges Vacher de Lapouge (1854–1936), who divided humanity into various, hierarchized, different &quot;races&quot;, spanning from the &quot;Aryan white race, dolichocephalic&quot; (from the Ancient Greek &quot;kephalê&quot;, head, and &quot;dolikhos&quot;, long and thin), to the &quot;brachycephalic&quot; (short and broad-headed) race. On the other hand, craniometry was also used as evidence against the existence of a &quot;Nordic race&quot; and also by Franz Boas who used the cephalic index to show the influence of environmental factors. Charles Darwin used craniometry and the study of skeletons to demonstrate his theory of evolution first expressed in &quot;On the Origin of Species&quot; (1859). A few studies claim that forensic anthropologists can correctly identify the perceived social race of an individual with rates from 81-99% accuracy depending on the craniometric data, the number of variables used, the populations, and the type of analysis.

Quite separately, certain artists from the 15th century onward made measurements of heads and skulls with a view to attaining greater accuracy in their representation of those parts of the human frame. Bernard Palissy and Albrecht Dürer were pioneers in such researches.

== The cephalic index ==

Swedish professor of anatomy Anders Retzius (1796–1860) first used the cephalic index in physical anthropology to classify ancient human remains found in Europe. He classified brains into three main categories, &quot;dolichocephalic&quot; (from the Ancient Greek &quot;kephalê&quot;, head, and &quot;dolikhos&quot;, long and thin), &quot;brachycephalic&quot; (short and broad) and &quot;mesocephalic&quot; (intermediate length and width).

A similar classification was the vertical cephalic index, the categories of which were &quot;chamaecranic&quot; (low-skulled), &quot;orthocranic&quot;, (medium high-skulled), and &quot;hypsicranic&quot; (high-skulled).

These terms were then used by Georges Vacher de Lapouge (1854–1936), one of the controversial founders of theories in this area and a theoretician of eugenics, who in &quot;L&#x27;Aryen et son rôle social&quot; (1899 – &quot;The Aryan and his social role&quot;) divided humanity into various, hierarchized, different &quot;races&quot;, spanning from the &quot;Aryan white race, dolichocephalic&quot;, to the &quot;brachycephalic&quot; &quot;mediocre and inert&quot; race, best represented by the population of &quot;France, Spain, Italy, all of Asia, and most of the Slavic countries&quot;.

Between these, Vacher de Lapouge identified the &quot;&quot;Homo europaeus&quot; (Teutonic, Protestant, etc.), the &quot;Homo alpinus&quot; (Auvergnat, Turkish, etc.), and finally the &quot;Homo mediterraneus&quot; (Napolitano, Andalus, etc.). &quot;Homo africanus&quot;&quot; (Congo, Florida) was even excluded from the discussion. Vacher de Lapouge became one of the leading inspirations of Nazi antisemitism and Nazi ideology. His classification was mirrored in William Z. Ripley in &quot;The Races of Europe&quot; (1899).

== Craniometry and anthropology ==
In 1784, Louis-Jean-Marie Daubenton, who wrote many comparative anatomy memoirs for the Académie française, published the &quot;Mémoire sur les différences de la situation du grand trou occipital dans l&#x27;homme et dans les animaux&quot; (which translates as &quot;Memoir on the Different Positions of the Occipital Foramen in Man and Animals&quot;).

Six years later, Pieter Camper (1722–1789), distinguished both as an artist and as an anatomist, published some lectures containing an account of his craniometrical methods. These laid the foundation of all subsequent work.

Pieter Camper invented the &quot;facial angle&quot;, a measure meant to determine intelligence among various species. According to this technique, a &quot;facial angle&quot; was formed by drawing two lines: one horizontally from the nostril to the ear; and the other perpendicularly from the advancing part of the upper jawbone to the most prominent part of the forehead.

Camper claimed that antique statues presented an angle of 90°, Europeans of 80°, Black people of 70° and the orangutan of 58°, thus displaying a hierarchic view of mankind, based on a decadent conception of history. This scientific research was continued by Étienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire (1772–1844) and Paul Broca (1824–1880), founder of the Anthropological Society in 1859 in France.

In 1856, workers found in a limestone quarry the skull of a Neanderthal man, thinking it to be the remains of a bear. They gave the material to amateur naturalist Johann Karl Fuhlrott, who turned the fossils over to anatomist Hermann Schaaffhausen. The discovery was jointly announced in 1857, giving rise to paleoanthropology.

Measurements were first made to compare the skulls of men with those of other animals. This wide comparison constituted the first subdivision of craniometric studies. The artist-anatomist Camper developed a theory to measure the facial angle, for which he is chiefly known in later anthropological literature.

Camper&#x27;s work followed 18th-century scientific theories. His measurements of facial angle were used to liken the skulls of non-Europeans to those of apes.

&quot;Craniometry&quot; also played a role in the foundation of the United States and the ideologies or racism that would become ingrained in the American psyche. As John Jeffries articulates in &quot;The Collision of Culture&quot; the Anglo-American hegemony present in America during the eighteenth and nineteenth century helped establish &quot;The American School of Craniometry&quot; which helped establish the American and Western concept of race. As Jeffries points out the rigid establishment of race in eighteenth-century American society came from a new school of sciences which sought to distance Anglo-Saxons from the African American population. The distancing of the African population in American society through craniometry helped greatly in the efforts to scientifically prove they were inferior. The ideologies set forth by this new &quot;American School&quot; of thought were then used to justify maintaining an enslaved population to sustain the increasing number of slave plantations in the American South during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.

In the 19th century the names of notable contributors to the literature of craniometry quickly increased in number. While it is impossible to analyse each contribution, or even record a complete list of the names of the authors, notable researchers who used craniometric methods to compare humans to other animals included T. H. Huxley (1825–1895) of England and Paul Broca.

By comparing skeletons of apes to man, Huxley backed up Charles Darwin&#x27;s theory of evolution and developed the &quot;Pithecometra principle&quot;, which stated that man and ape were descended from a common ancestor.

Ernst Haeckel (1834–1919) became famous for his now outdated &quot;recapitulation theory&quot;, according to which each individual mirrored the evolution of the whole species during his life. Although outdated, his work contributed then to the examination of human life.

These researches on skulls and skeletons helped liberate 19th-century European science from its ethnocentric biases. In particular, Eugène Dubois&#x27; (1858–1940) discovery in 1891 in Indonesia of the &quot;Java Man&quot;, the first specimen of &quot;Homo erectus&quot; to be discovered, demonstrated mankind&#x27;s deep ancestry outside Europe.

== Cranial capacity, races and 19th–20th-century scientific ideas ==
Samuel George Morton (1799–1851), one of the inspirers of physical anthropology, collected hundreds of human skulls from all over the world and started trying to find a way to classify them according to some logical criterion. Influenced by the common theories of his time, he claimed that he could judge the intellectual capacity of a race by the cranial capacity (the measure of the volume of the interior of the skull).

After inspecting three mummies from ancient Egyptian catacombs, Morton concluded that Caucasians and other races were already distinct three thousand years ago. Since the Bible indicated that Noah&#x27;s Ark had washed up on Mount Ararat, only a thousand years ago before this, Morton claimed that Noah&#x27;s sons could not possibly account for every race on Earth. According to Morton&#x27;s theory of polygenism, races have been separate since the start.

Morton claimed that he could judge the intellectual capacity of a race by the skull size. A large skull meant a large brain and high intellectual capacity, and a small skull indicated a small brain and decreased intellectual capacity. Morton collected hundreds of human skulls from all over the world. By studying these skulls he claimed that each race had a separate origin. Morton had many skulls from ancient Egypt, and concluded that the ancient Egyptians were not African, but were White. His two major monographs were the &quot;Crania Americana&quot; (1839), &quot;An Inquiry into the Distinctive Characteristics of the Aboriginal Race of America&quot; and &quot;Crania Aegyptiaca&quot; (1844).

Based on craniometry data, Morton claimed in &quot;Crania Americana&quot; that the Caucasians had the biggest brains, averaging 87 cubic inches, Indians were in the middle with an average of 82 cubic inches and Negroes had the smallest brains with an average of 78 cubic inches.

Stephen Jay Gould (1941–2002), an American paleontologist, evolutionary biologist and historian of science, studied these craniometric works in &quot;The Mismeasure of Man&quot; (1981) and claimed Samuel Morton had fudged data and &quot;overpacked&quot; the skulls with filler in order to justify his preconceived notions on racial differences. A subsequent study by the anthropologist John Michael found Morton&#x27;s original data to be more accurate than Gould describes, concluding that &quot;[c]ontrary to Gould&#x27;s interpretation... Morton&#x27;s research was conducted with integrity.&quot;

In 2011, physical anthropologists at the University of Pennsylvania, which owns Morton&#x27;s collection, published a study that concluded that almost every detail of Gould&#x27;s analysis was wrong and that &quot;Morton did not manipulate his data to support his preconceptions, contra Gould.&quot; They identified and remeasured half of the skulls used in Morton&#x27;s reports, finding that in only 2% of cases did Morton&#x27;s measurements differ significantly from their own and that these errors either were random or gave a larger than accurate volume to African skulls, the reverse of the bias that Gould imputed to Morton.

Morton&#x27;s followers, particularly Josiah C. Nott and George Gliddon in their monumental tribute to Morton&#x27;s work, &quot;Types of Mankind&quot; (1854), carried Morton&#x27;s ideas further and backed up his findings which supported the notion of polygenism.

Charles Darwin opposed Nott and Glidon in his 1871 &quot;The Descent of Man&quot;, arguing for a monogenism of the species. Darwin conceived the common origin of all humans (the single-origin hypothesis) as essential for evolutionary theory.

Furthermore, Josiah Nott was the translator of Arthur de Gobineau&#x27;s &quot;An Essay on the Inequality of the Human Races&quot; (1853–1855), which is one of the founding works of the group of studies that segregates society based on &quot;race&quot;, in contrast to Boulainvilliers&#x27; (1658–1722) theory of races. Henri de Boulainvilliers opposed the &quot;Français&quot; (French people), alleged descendants of the Nordic Franks, and members of the aristocracy, to the Third Estate, considered to be indigenous Gallo-Roman people who were subordinated by the Franks by right of conquest. Gobineau, meanwhile, made three main divisions between races, based not on colour but on climatic conditions and geographic location, and which privileged the &quot;Aryan&quot; race.

In 1873, Paul Broca (1824–1880) found the same pattern described by Samuel Morton&#x27;s &quot;Crania Americana&quot; by weighing brains at autopsy. Other historical studies alleging a Black-White difference in brain size include Bean (1906), Mall, (1909), Pearl, (1934) and Vint (1934).
Furthermore, Georges Vacher de Lapouge&#x27;s racial classification (&quot;Teutonic&quot;, &quot;Alpine&quot; and &quot;Mediterranean&quot;) was re-used by William Z. Ripley (1867–1941) in &quot;The Races of Europe&quot; (1899), who even made a map of Europe according to the alleged cephalic index of its inhabitants.

In Germany, Rudolf Virchow launched a study of craniometry, which gave surprising results according to contemporary theories on the &quot;Aryan race&quot;, leading Virchow to denounce the &quot;Nordic mysticism&quot; in the 1885 Anthropology Congress in Karlsruhe.

Josef Kollmann, a collaborator of Virchow, stated in the same congress that the people of Europe, be them German, Italian, English or French, belonged to a &quot;mixture of various races&quot;, furthermore declaring that the &quot;results of craniology&quot; led to &quot;struggle against any theory concerning the superiority of this or that European race&quot; on others.

Virchow later rejected measure of skulls as legitimate means of taxonomy. Paul Kretschmer quoted an 1892 discussion with him concerning these criticisms, also citing Aurel von Törok&#x27;s 1895 work, who basically proclaimed the failure of craniometry.

== Craniometry, phrenology and physiognomy ==

Craniometry was also used in phrenology, which purported to determine character, personality traits, and criminality on the basis of the shape of the head and thus of the skull. At the turn of the 19th century, Franz Joseph Gall (1758–1822) developed &quot;cranioscopy&quot; (Ancient Greek &quot;kranion&quot;: skull, &quot;scopos&quot;: vision), a method to determine the personality and development of mental and moral faculties on the basis of the external shape of the skull.

Cranioscopy was later renamed to phrenology (&quot;phrenos&quot;: mind, &quot;logos&quot;: study) by his student Johann Spurzheim (1776–1832), who wrote extensively on the &quot;Drs. Gall and Spurzheim&#x27;s physiognomical System&quot;. Physiognomy claimed a correlation between physical features (especially facial features) and character traits.

It was made famous by Cesare Lombroso (1835–1909), the founder of anthropological criminology, who claimed to be able to scientifically identify links between the nature of a crime and the personality or physical appearance of the offender. The originator of the concept of a &quot;born criminal&quot; and arguing in favor of biological determinism, Lombroso tried to recognize criminals by measurements of their bodies.

He concluded that skull and facial features were clues to genetic criminality, and that these features could be measured with craniometers and calipers with the results developed into quantitative research. A few of the 14 identified traits of a criminal included large jaws, forward projection of jaw, low sloping forehead; high cheekbones, flattened or upturned nose; handle-shaped ears; hawk-like noses or fleshy lips; hard shifty eyes; scanty beard or baldness; insensitivity to pain; long arms, and so on.

== Criticisms and revival of past cranial theories in the 20th century ==

After being a main influence of US white nationalists, William Ripley&#x27;s &quot;The Races of Europe&quot; (1899) was eventually rewritten in 1939, just before World War II, by Harvard physical anthropologist Carleton S. Coon.

J. Philippe Rushton, psychologist, head of the Pioneer Fund, an organization founded in 1937 to promote eugenics, and author of the controversial work &quot;Race, Evolution and Behavior&quot; (1995), reanalyzed Gould&#x27;s retabulation in 1989, and argued that Samuel Morton, in his 1839 book &quot;Crania Americana&quot;, had shown a pattern of decreasing brain size proceeding from East Asians to Europeans to Africans.

In his 1995 book &quot;Race, Evolution, and Behavior&quot;, Rushton alleged an average endocranial volume of 1,364 cm3 for East Asians, 1,347 for white caucasians and 1,268 for black Africans. Other similar claims were previously made by Ho et al. (1980), who measured 1,261 brains at autopsy, and Beals et al. (1984), who measured approximately 20,000 skulls, finding the same East Asian → European → African pattern. However, in the same article Beals explicitly warns against using the findings as indicative of racial traits, &quot;If one merely lists such means by geographical region or race, causes of similarity by genogroup and ecotype are hopelessly confounded&quot;. Rushton&#x27;s findings have also been criticized for questionable methodology, such as lumping in African-Americans with equatorial Africans, as people from hot climates generally have slightly smaller crania. Rushton also compared equatorial Africans from the poorest and least educated areas of Africa against Asians from the wealthiest and most educated areas of Asia and areas with colder climates which generally induce larger cranium sizes in evolution. According to Zack Cernovsky, from one of Rushton&#x27;s own study it emerges that the average cranial capacity for North American blacks is similar to the average for Caucasians from comparable climatic zones. Per Cernovsky, people from different climates tend to have minor differences in brain size, but these do not necessarily imply differences in intelligence; for instance, though women tend to have smaller brains than men they also have more neural complexity and loading in certain areas of the brain than men.

== Modern use ==
More direct measurements involve examinations of brains from corpses, or more recently, imaging techniques such as MRI, which can be used on living persons. Such measurements are used in research on neuroscience and intelligence.

Brain volume data and other craniometric data are used in mainstream science to compare modern-day animal species, and to analyze the evolution of the human species in archaeology.

Measurements of the skull based on specific anatomical reference points are used in both forensic facial reconstruction and portrait sculpture.

<text>Philippine Internet eXchange (PhIX) is the first Internet Exchange Point in the Philippines.

It is a joint project of Philippine Internet Service Providers (ISPs) to interconnect through a common backbone or Internet Exchange Point (IX) for efficient infrastructure.

 it was interconnecting eight (8) ISPs namely: Pacific Internet, Tridel, Evoserve, WorldTel, Moscom, IPhil, Infocom and Virtualink. G-Net, Globe Telecom’s ISP, was in the process of joining the Philippine Internet eXchange.

==History==
The idea to connect all the Internet Service Providers in the Philippines was first suggested in mid-1995 during the Internet Society (ISOC)-sponsored Internet Workshop held in Hawaii. Uniting competing ISPs posed a difficulty even though the benefits of an IX were obvious.

In August 1995, exploratory discussions started within PLDT on the setting-up of the infrastructure for an Internet hub. In May 1996 it was decided to proceed with the network access point project, called Philippine Internet eXchange (PhIX). PhIX pilot operations started in January 1997.

On 29 October 1996, PLDT formally presented its PhIX project to the 15 local ISPs which have their own gateway connections to other countries. Of the 15 ISPs who attended PLDT&#x27;s presentation, the 5 largest ISPs signified their intention to join the PhIX project by signing the Multi-Lateral Peering Agreement on 19 November 1996, namely: Infocom, IPhil, Moscom, Virtualink and WorldTel Phil.

The pilot operation of the PhIX was started in January 1997 and was completed in June 1997, and since then the 5 pioneering ISPs have successfully been exchanging Philippine-Centric New World Hotel on July 3, 1997 which is when PHIX was formally launched.

==Objectives==
* To improve the efficiency of internet routing in the Philippines.
* To enhance the overall quality and reliability of Philippine Internet services.
* To maximize existing and future bandwidth capacities of ISPs in the Philippines
* To reduce the size of the routing tables worldwide.
* To create a truly Philippine-centric Internet.

==Updates==

===G-Net to Join PhIX===
Globe Telecom’s Internet Service Provider (ISP), G-Net, is in the process of joining the Philippine Internet eXchange. Globe Telecom is a member of the Ayala Group of companies. G-Net is one of its services.

G-Net would be peering via an E1 connection.

===Tridel and Moscom Upgrades Bandwidth===
Member ISPs are seeing the benefit of exchanging local Internet traffic. Due to the increase in usage of the Philippine Internet eXchange service, Tridel Technologies upgraded its bandwidth to 512 kbit/s from a 64 kbit/s leased line.

Meanwhile, Moscom Internet is in the process of upgrading its connection to E1.

<doc id="923608" wikidata="Q1046612" url="?curid=923608" title="Tom Chaplin">
<text>Thomas Oliver Chaplin (born 8 March 1979) is an English musician, best known as the co-founder and lead singer of the British alternative rock band Keane.

==Early life==
Thomas Oliver Chaplin was born in Hastings, East Sussex, to Sally and David Chaplin OBE, a month apart from future bandmate Tim Rice-Oxley&#x27;s brother, also called Tom. Their mothers became friends and he started a friendship with the two brothers that endures today.

Chaplin&#x27;s father was headmaster of Vinehall School in Robertsbridge, so both friends were schooled there along with Richard Hughes, who would later be their bandmate.
With Rice-Oxley and Hughes, Chaplin then attended Tonbridge School. Studying there, they met Dominic Scott (who was a founding member of Keane but left in 2001). During his time at Vinehall, Chaplin acted in several school plays and was part of the school&#x27;s choral group. He also played the flute while at school. Chaplin attended the University of Edinburgh, prior to dropping out to pursue a career in music.

Meanwhile, in 1995, the trio of Scott, Rice-Oxley and Hughes started their first band, The Lotus Eaters (not to be confused with the 1980s chart band of the same name). It was a cover band that played U2, Oasis and The Beatles at Sussex pubs. Tim Rice-Oxley invited Chaplin to join the band as an acoustic guitar player. A short time later, in 1997, the band&#x27;s name changed to Keane and Chaplin became the lead singer.

==Keane==
Chaplin was invited to join the band by Rice-Oxley, after he finally convinced the other two, in 1997, when the name The Lotus Eaters was changed to Cherry Keane, after a friend of Chaplin&#x27;s mother. &#x27;Cherry&#x27; was later removed from the name.

During their stint in London, Chaplin shared a flat with Rice-Oxley in Stoke Newington and they tried to get money for rehearsal time. Chaplin worked at a publishing company where his chief responsibility was to carry boxes.

With Scott in the line-up as the lead guitarist, Chaplin had to play the acoustic guitar. Since Scott left in 2001, he primarily takes lead vocals, but also plays the organ on &quot;Hamburg Song&quot; during some live gigs, as well as a distorted piano on some tracks from their second album.
He also took part in Band Aid 20&#x27;s re-recording of &quot;Do They Know It&#x27;s Christmas?&quot; in November 2004 doing a solo on the line &quot;feed the world&quot;, something that had not been done on previous versions where all artists sang.

==Solo career==
Having said that he intended to make a solo record during Keane&#x27;s hiatus, Chaplin stated in January 2016 that he was recording his debut solo album in Los Angeles, California, with 40 songs written and whittled down to an album&#x27;s worth. He announced in late June that the album was complete and that it would be out soon.

===2016–2017: &quot;The Wave&quot;===

The album name &quot;The Wave&quot; was announced via Twitter and Facebook on 10 August 2016. The same day, Hardened Heart was released with a music video. On 26 August 2016, &quot;Quicksand&quot; was released as the first single from the album. On 6 September 2016, Chaplin announced he would be playing eight intimate solo shows across the UK in October 2016. These were his first solo gigs for four years. &quot;The Wave&quot; was released on 14 October 2016 by Island Records. Four singles were released from the album: &quot;Quicksand&quot;, &quot;Still Waiting&quot;, &quot;Solid Gold&quot; (of which the single release is a collaboration with JONES, rather than the solo version which appears on the album), and &quot;See It So Clear&quot;. The release of &quot;The Wave&quot; was followed by the announcement of the Carried by the Wave Tour, a longer set of dates running between January and September 2017. The tour consisted of four legs: first in the United States and Canada, then across Europe, a third leg in the UK during May 2017 and a last leg in Latin America.

===2017–present: &quot;Twelve Tales of Christmas&quot; and &quot;The Masked Singer&quot;===

On 13 October 2017, Chaplin announced that he had recorded his first solo Christmas album, entitled &quot;Twelve Tales of Christmas&quot;, to be released on 17 November 2017. Simultaneously the first single from the album was released, entitled &quot;Under a Million Lights&quot;. The album consists of eight original tracks and four cover versions: &quot;Walking in the Air&quot; (written by Howard Blake), &quot;2000 Miles&quot; (originally by The Pretenders), &quot;River&quot; (originally by Joni Mitchell) and &quot;Stay Another Day&quot; (originally by East 17). It was also announced that Chaplin would be performing three gigs to accompany the release of the album; at the Palace Theatre in Manchester on 10 December 2017, at The Forum in Bath on 11 December and at the Royal Festival Hall in London on 12 December.

In January 2022, Chaplin appeared on the third series of &quot;The Masked Singer&quot; as &quot;Poodle&quot;. He was fifth to be unmasked. Following that event, he said in an interview that he was working on his third solo album, that would be coming out later in 2022.

In July 2022, he announced that his third album, &quot;Midpoint&quot;, would be released on 2 September 2022.

==Equipment==
Chaplin uses a Hammond XK2 organ for &quot;Hamburg Song&quot; and &quot;Nothing in My Way&quot;. Since May 2006, he has used a Yamaha CP60M for live piano parts in &quot;A Bad Dream&quot;, &quot;The Frog Prince&quot; and &quot;Crystal Ball&quot;.

He has played acoustic guitar in such songs as &quot;Your Eyes Open&quot; since the 2006 UK tour, and during 2007 played acoustic solos of &quot;Broken Toy&quot; and &quot;The Frog Prince&quot;. He played guitar on Keane&#x27;s third album, &quot;Perfect Symmetry&quot; and has been the lead guitarist in live shows for the album. Tom plays three different Fender Telecaster guitars: one red, one white and one light blue.

In an interview with Keane Backline, Rice-Oxley stated that Chaplin had been interested in learning to play the theremin, but &quot;couldn&#x27;t be bothered to learn how to use it&quot;, also stating that the theremin &quot;might be the only way of reproducing the musical saw sound&quot; used in some tracks of &quot;Perfect Symmetry&quot;.

==Personal life==
Chaplin married his girlfriend Natalie Dive in June 2011. He has a daughter born on 20 March 2014 and a son born in 2020. The family lives in Wittersham, Kent.

Chaplin is a keen golfer, supporter of Ipswich Town and of the England cricket team. He identifies as an agnostic.

===Drug rehabilitation===
On 22 August 2006, Chaplin stated that he was receiving treatment for drug abuse problems. He and his bandmates cancelled their North American tour for his rehabilitation after he left their hotel in Japan with no warning, choosing to fly back to Britain alone. He left the Priory clinic in London on 6 October, but continued to receive treatment after leaving.

In August 2016, Chaplin said in an interview with music critic Neil McCormick that he began using drugs again before the release of his solo album, and mentioned that anxiety over the album caused him to get &quot;back to shovelling coke up (his) nose&quot;. Chaplin said he nearly died one night in 2015. He said people began to give up on him, and his wife once told him she loved him in case she never saw him again. Chaplin recovered by seeing a psychoanalyst. He also stated that the past 12 months had been the happiest of his life with his wife and daughter.

<text>Vas (, ; ; or ; ) is an administrative county (comitatus or &quot;vármegye&quot;) of Hungary. It was also one of the counties of the former Kingdom of Hungary. It is part of the Centrope Project.

==Geography==
Vas County lies in western Hungary. It shares borders with Austria (Burgenland), Slovenia (Mura Statistical Region), and the Hungarian counties of Győr-Moson-Sopron, Veszprém, and Zala. The capital of Vas County is Szombathely. Its area is 3,336 km².

==History==
Vas is also the name of a historic administrative county (comitatus) of the Kingdom of Hungary. Its territory is now in western Hungary, eastern Austria, and eastern Slovenia. The capital of the county was Szombathely.

Vas County arose as one of the first comitatus of the Kingdom of Hungary.

In 1920, by the Treaty of Trianon the western part of the county became part of the new Austrian land Burgenland, and a smaller part in the southwest, known as Vendvidék, became part of the newly formed Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (later renamed to Yugoslavia). In the Vendvidék in 1919 was founded an unrecognized state the Prekmurje Republic, similar to Burgenland the Lajtabánság. The remainder stayed in Hungary, as the present Hungarian county Vas. After World War II due to Communist reforms, a small part of the former Sopron county went to Vas County, some villages north of Zalaegerszeg went to Zala county, and a small region west of Pápa went to Veszprém county.

Since 1991, when Slovenia became independent from Yugoslavia, the Yugoslav part of the former Vas County (around Murska Sobota) is part of Slovenia.

Vas County is home to a small Slovene minority, which lives in the area between the town of Szentgotthárd and the Slovenian border (see Hungarian Slovenes).

<text>Kangaroo Point is an inner southern suburb in the City of Brisbane, Queensland, Australia. In the , Kangaroo Point had a population of 9,689 people.

The suburb features two prominent attractions, the Story Bridge and Kangaroo Point Cliffs. At the western margins, the Captain Cook Bridge marks the start of the Pacific Motorway. The Kangaroo Point Green Bridge connects the suburb to the central business district.

== Geography ==
Kangaroo Point is located directly east across the Brisbane River from the Brisbane central business district, but being on the south side of the river is normally regarded as a southern suburb.

Kangaroo Point is located on a peninsula formed of harder rhyolite rock which the Brisbane River flows around. On the northern tip of the peninsula the Story Bridge connects it to the central business district and the suburb of Fortitude Valley. The suburb of Woolloongabba is located to the south. The six-lane Main Street runs from Story Bridge to Woolloongabba. The landscape of Kangaroo Point is predominantly high-rise apartments towards the tip of the peninsula while the southern end is predominantly low-medium density apartments and Queenslander type houses.

At the northern tip of the peninsula is Captain Burke Park () with the Holman Street ferry wharf (), barbeques, picnic facilities, playground, and outdoor fitness facilities.

== History ==
Before British settlement, Kangaroo Point was settled by the Turrbal people. It is one of the earliest suburbs settled in Brisbane and subsequently, is one of Brisbane&#x27;s oldest suburbs, rich in history and character. It had a reputation for violent and rowdy street gangs around the 1900s, with a number of street riots.

In 1823, explorer John Oxley described Kangaroo Point as a &quot;jungle, fringed with mangroves with the higher land open forest, covered with grass&quot;. During the time of the subsequent convict settlement (1825–1841), Kangaroo Point was cleared and used for cultivation of crops. Subsequently, the area was opened up for free settlement, the first land sales taking place on 13 December 1843. Among the early purchasers was Captain John Clements Wickham, the Police Magistrate and later Government Resident. Surveyor James Warner built the first house at Kangaroo Point in 1844.

Kangaroo Point&#x27;s first school was opened in 1861 by the Church of England. It came under the control of the Board of Education in 1867 and consisted of a boys department and a girls department. A separate Girls and Infants school opened on 2 March 1874. This was replaced by the Kangaroo Point Girls School and the Kangaroo Point Infants School which both opened on 20 January 1890. The Kangaroo Point Boys School, Girls School and Infants School closed on 28 April 1950 and amalgamated to become the Kangaroo Point State School. The Kangaroo Point State School closed on 30 June 1965. The site was subsequently redeveloped as a TAFE college, on the corner of River Terrace and Main Street. In January 2010 this site was redeveloped into parkland extending the Kangaroo Point Cliffs Park ().

In September 1865, 42 allotments of portion 35 of Kangaroo Point were advertised to be auctioned for sale by Arthur Martin &amp; Co. A map advertising the auction contained a diagram of subdivisions 1 to 31 situated between Ipswich Road and the Brisbane River.

St Joseph&#x27;s Catholic Primary School was founded by Mary MacKillop and opened on 19 March 1870 in Hubert Street in One Mile Swamp (now Woolloongabba) with 70 students. In January 1871, the school relocated to Leopold Street (not Leopard Street) at Kangaroo Point into an unlined timber building with a shingle roof on land provided by James Toohey. In 1879 the Sisters of Mercy took over the operation of the school, following a dispute between MacKillop and the Catholic Bishop of Brisbane.

In 1887, the Yungaba Immigration Centre was built on Main Street at Kangaroo Point to replace the poor facilities at the existing centre in William Street.

In June 1888, six allotments, being subdivisions 1 to 6 of subdivisions 7 to 11 of portions 68 in the Parish of Kangaroo Point, on Walmsley Street between the Garden Point Ferry and Main Street were advertised to be auctioned for sale by Simon Fraser &amp; Son. A map advertising the auction contained a local sketch by the surveyors, Hamilton &amp; Raff.

In 1911–1912, St John&#x27;s College of the University of Queensland opened in three Queenslander houses on River Terrace (). At that time, the university was located at Gardens Point just across the Brisbane River. In 1956, the college relocated to the university&#x27;s St Lucia campus.

In September 1928, 19 subdivisions adjacent to the Brisbane River and titled &quot;Town Reach River Sites&quot; were advertised to be auctioned for sale by Isles, Love &amp; Co Limited. A map advertising the auction includes an aerial photograph and a panoramic photograph of the area.

For many years the suburb was dominated by the factories of heavy engineering businesses, particularly those involved in the maritime industry, such as Evans Deakin, Buzzacott &amp; Co and Evans, Anderson, Phelan &amp; Co. Evans Deakin built the largest ship ever constructed on the Brisbane River, the 66,000 tonne oil tanker &quot;Robert Miller&quot;, which became adrift in the river during the 1974 Brisbane flood. The last vessel to be built by Evans Deakin was an oil rig called &quot;Southern Cross&quot;. The company vacated the site in 1976, with it later being redeveloped for high-rise accommodation.

Stone was quarried from the cliffs and used as building material. Until the 1930s, Evans Anderson &amp; Phelan built steam locomotives at their Kangaroo Point works for Queensland Railways, however their works were not located near a railway, so the completed locomotives were delivered along Main Street on temporary track.

Until the federation of the Australian colonies in 1901, the Queensland Navy&#x27;s main storage facility was located in the suburb. The first ship-based radio transmission in Australia was made between HMAS &quot;Gayundah&quot; and the buildings in 1903. The naval stores buildings were occupied by the Royal Australian Navy until 1959, and then by the Australian Army until 1984. The heritage-listed buildings are now used by an adventure company focussing on river activities and rock climbing.

The opening of the Story Bridge () in July 1940 was a significant development in the suburb. Trolleybuses operated by the Brisbane City Council linked the suburb with Fortitude Valley via the Story Bridge from 1953 to 1969, running along Main Street from Woolloongabba and other eastern suburbs. At the time of the Story Bridge project, both the eastern and western riverfronts of Kangaroo Point were industrial areas and docks; these were gradually replaced by large residential developments and recreation space up to the 1980s. 

On 20 July 1998, the LDS Church announced that its Brisbane temple would be built in Kangaroo Point. There were delays due to negotiations with the Brisbane City Council over concerns about the temple&#x27;s height, floodlighting and parking arrangements. On 26 May 2001, Kenneth Johnson presided at the
groundbreaking ceremony and site dedication. Construction of the temple began in November 2001 and took 18 months. A public open house was held from 10 May through 7 June 2003 allowing local residents to view the temple prior to its dedication (after which it was open only to church members). The temple was dedicated on 15 June 2003 by LDS Church president Gordon B. Hinckley. The temple features two ordinance rooms and two sealing rooms.

== Attractions ==
Kangaroo Point is a popular recreation spot, conveniently close to the city and the South Bank Parklands. The Kangaroo Point Cliffs, situated on the east bank of the city bend of the Brisbane River north of the Maritime Museum, opposite Riverstage and the Queensland University of Technology at Gardens Point. Kangaroo Point is also home to one of less than 200 Mormon temples in the world {as of August 2015}. Kangaroo Point is also home to Ellis Street, one of the 20 steepest hills in Brisbane according to Brisbane City Council. Kangaroo Point is also home to the more-than-160-year-old St Mary&#x27;s Anglican Church.
The cliffs are a popular picnic, rock climbing and abseiling site. The steepness of the cliffs was increased by quarrying operations which mined the volcanic rock or rhyolite lava flows which form the cliffs. The lava was deposited in the Triassic Period about 230 million years ago and filled up an ancient river valley. They currently form the banks of the Brisbane River.

The Story Bridge is a prominent landmark. It is able to be climbed with authorised tourist groups and provides the main means of access to the north of Brisbane. Directly under the bridge is the Story Bridge Hotel, and Yungaba, one of Brisbane&#x27;s most unusual and iconic landmarks.

The &quot;Kangaroo Point Natural History Project&quot; was implemented by the council in 2013 to recognise the contribution by some of Queensland&#x27;s pioneering scientists and researchers from the area. Along a heritage trail through the CT White and James Warner parks are a series of signs and sculptures to commemorate their lives and work: Cyril Tenison White (government botanist), Frederick Manson Bailey (colonial botanist), Silvester Diggles (naturalist), Oscar Werner Tiegs (entomologist and zoologist), James Warner (surveyor), and Harry Oakman (landscape artist).

== Transport ==
By bus, the suburb is serviced by the South East Busway transit line and buses along Main Street and Shafstons Avenue. By road, Kangaroo Point residents rely on the Story Bridge and Captain Cook Bridge for access to the north, and the Southeast Freeway for access to the south. Main Street connects the Story Bridge through the suburb to the South East Freeway. Bicycle paths run along the Brisbane River from South Bank to and over the Story Bridge. The bicycle paths are heavily used by cyclists, roller skaters and pedestrians.

Cross River and CityHopper ferry services operate from the Riverside wharf in the CBD to Holman Street ferry wharf near the peak of Kangaroo Point. CityCat services do not directly service Kangaroo Point.

The M7 Clem Jones Tunnel, a toll tunnel, which opened in March 2010, has a connection on Shafston Avenue. It diverts some traffic travelling through the suburb while providing an additional transport route for residents.

The Kangaroo Point Green Bridge was proposed in 2010 to connect Kangaroo Point to the Brisbane central business district. Construction of the bridge began in 2021. The Cross River Rail tunnel is planned to connect under the Kangaroo Point Cliffs from Woolloongabba railway station to Albert Street railway station.

== Education ==
St Joseph&#x27;s Primary School is a Catholic primary (Prep–6) school for boys and girls at 26–36 Leopard Street (). In 2017, the school had an enrolment of 318 students with 24 teachers (18 full-time equivalent) and 16 non-teaching staff (9 full-time equivalent).

There are no government schools in Kangaroo Point. The nearest government primary school is East Brisbane State School in East Brisbane. The nearest government secondary school is Coorparoo Secondary College in Coorparoo.

For tertiary studies, Kangaroo Point is host to Shafston International College and the Aboriginal Centre for the Performing Arts (ACPA) (which has now moved to the Judith Wright Arts Centre in Fortitude Valley) and was host to a Southbank Institute of TAFE campus until its demolition in 2009. Directly across the river from the cliffs is the Queensland University of Technology (Gardens Point campus) and in an adjacent suburb, the main campus for TAFE Queensland Brisbane (South Bank).

<text>Abraham Z. Joffe (1909–2000) was Professor of Mycology and Mycotoxicology at the Hebrew University, Jerusalem. 

Joffe&#x27;s professional interests were centered primarily in toxigenic fungi associated with production of mycotoxins (aflatoxins, trichothecenes, and other toxins); ecology and environmental factors favoring formation and distribution of Fusarium mycotoxins in cereal grains, feeds and foods; and phytotoxic action of Fusarium strains, and their toxicity in animals and humans.

Joffe is the author of over 130 scientific papers, reviews and monographs. He was a member of several professional associations, a participant in numerous International Conferences and Symposia, and holds two Certificates of Merit from the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the Ministry of Health of the USSR.

Joffe received his PhD in Mycology and Mycotoxicology at the Institute of Botany, U.S.S.R Academy of Science in Leningrad (1950). He is a member of the Joffe family.

<text>Phaeodarea or Phaeodaria is a group of amoeboid cercozoan organisms. They are traditionally considered radiolarians, but in molecular trees do not appear to be close relatives of the other groups, and are instead placed among the Cercozoa. They are distinguished by the structure of their central capsule and by the presence of a phaeodium, an aggregate of waste particles within the cell.

The term &quot;Radiozoa&quot; has been used to refer to radiolaria when Phaeodarea is explicitly excluded.

Phaeodarea produce hollow skeletons composed of amorphous silica and organic material, which rarely fossilize. The endoplasm is divided by a cape with three openings, of which one gives rise to feeding pseudopods, and the others let through bundles of microtubules that support the axopods. Unlike true radiolarians, there are no cross-bridges between them. They also lack symbiotic algae, generally living below the photic zone, and do not produce any strontium sulfate.

== Characteristics ==

=== Cell structure ===

Phaeodarea are unicellular protists that grow a capsule with a thick, double-layered wall containing two kinds of pores or openings: the large type, known as &quot;astropylum&quot; or oral pore, from which a massive strand of cytoplasm protrudes; and the smaller type, known as &quot;parapylae&quot; or lateral pores, from which thinner strands of cytoplasm protrude. External to the capsule there is a large, often darkly pigmented, mass of granular cytoplasm called &quot;phaeodium&quot; which contains undigested or partially digested food or debris. Their mitochondrial cristae are tubular.

Most Phaeodaria have a siliceous skeleton composed of amorphous silica joined by organic matter. They may contain more organic matter than Polycystinea (Radiolaria). Skeletons of some species are composed of hollow bars, instead of solid rods as in Polycystinea. Others have ornate spicules scattered through the external cytoplasm in a variety of forms, including geodesic frameworks, spheres or polyhedra. Other species have porous shells that are either bivalved, resembling clams, or vase-like with ornamentations around the opening. Other species have highly branched antler-llike spines stemming from a central shell. Unlike Polycystinea, the capsular wall surrounding the denser endoplasm of Phaeodarea lacks fusules.

Their cell size ranges from hundreds of micrometres to a few millimetres, roughly depending on the family. For example, species of Tuscaroridae exceed 3 mm, while Challengeriidae are generally smaller than a few hundred μm. Some phaeodarians with spherical skeletons are similar to Polycystinea and Acantharea (Radiolaria), although they are more porous and fragile. Some species of the family Challengeriidae resemble marine dinoflagellates, but can be correctly distinguished by the presence of a phaeodium and absence of grooves.

=== Nutrition ===

The continuous, massive strand of cytoplasm in the astropyle of Phaeodarea provides a pathway to carry digested prey matter into the endoplasm, similarly to some testate amoebae and foraminifera. Among the limited evidence of phaeodarian predation, it was reported in 1986 that a mesopelagic phaeodarian had absorbed microflagellate and metazoan prey. When introduced in the laboratory cultures, copepods and salps also were snared by phaeodaria.

=== Reproduction ===

Sexual reproduction of Phaeodaria has not been confirmed, but the release of motile swarmers that are likely gametes is widely documented. In the species &quot;Coelodendrum ramosissimum&quot;, dispersal starts with the disappearance of the phaeodium, followed by the dissolution of the capsule and the creation of small plasmodial spheres in the ectoplasm; each of the spheres produces hundreds of multinucleated amoebae that eventually form swarmers with two undulipodia (flagella).

== Ecology ==

Phaeodaria are exclusively marine, holoplanktonic unicellular protists that play an important role in marine ecosystems. They are heterotrophic plankton (zooplankton) that chiefly live in pelagic open oceans, from the surface to the deep sea. They have not been reported from brackish and high-salinity environments, but they are present in all oceans.

Very little is known about their role in the trophic web and about their predators. Dinoflagellate necrotrophs are reported to infect species of Phaeodaria, such as &quot;Syndinium nucleophaga&quot;.

==Systematics==

=== History ===

As a protist group often broken by normal sampling methods and not very abundant in comparison with other organisms in the euphotic zone, Phaeodaria have attracted little attention from plankton researchers. The majority of taxonomic and ecological information regarding Phaeodaria, studied by German scientists, ended after World War I, and it has been little updated until today. Because of the presence of an organic central capsule and &quot;ray-like pseudopodia&quot;, Phaeodaria were historically regarded as Radiolaria, along with Polycystinea and Acantharea. The marine Radiolaria were, along with the freshwater Heliozoa, assigned to the phylum Actinopoda due to their elaborate siliceous skeletons surrounding the central capsule with pores from which axopodia emerge.

Through molecular phylogenetics, Actinopoda was rendered invalid due to being polyphyletic, not a natural group. Phaeodaria are now classified as a subclass of the phylum Cercozoa, while the ecologically different &quot;true&quot; Radiolaria belong to the related phylum Retaria, both within the higher Rhizaria supergroup. The following cladogram shows the phylogenetic position of all groups of &quot;Actinopoda&quot; (highlighted).

=== Phylogeny ===

Through phylogenetic analyses it has been discovered that Phaeodarea is a monophyletic clade, but the historical orders and families comprising it aren&#x27;t. Instead, the clade consists of 11 subclades defined by morphological and phylogenetic values that do not correspond with the traditional orders and families:

Despite this, the current taxonomy by Cavalier-Smith maintains the original classification of suborders divided between two new orders:

*Eodarida, containing phaeodarea with no silica skeleton or with a skeleton made of simple radiating spicules. Contains two suborders: Phaeogymnocellina and Phaeocystina.
*Opaloconchida, containing phaeodarea with a highly perforated, shell-like opaline silica skeleton. Contains the remaining five suborders: Phaeosphaeria, Phaeocalpia, Phaeogromia, Phaeoconchia and Phaeodendria.

===Modern classification===
The modern classification is the following, with the subclass containing a total of 2 orders, 7 suborders, 16 families and 39 genera. 

*Order Eodarida 
**Suborder Phaeogymnocellina (=Phaeogymnocellida)

<text>HK-47 is a fictional droid in the &quot;Star Wars&quot; franchise. Introduced in the 2003 video game &quot;Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic&quot;, he is an extremely efficient assassin droid constructed by Revan to assist them in hunting Jedi, until both have their memories wiped and made to serve the Jedi themselves. Voiced by Kristoffer Tabori, HK-47 reappears in the 2004 sequel, &quot;Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords&quot;, the &quot;Trials of Obi-Wan&quot; 2005 expansion pack to the massively multiplayer online game &quot;Star Wars Galaxies&quot;, and the 2011 MMORPG &quot;Star Wars: The Old Republic&quot;, as well as various other novels, short stories, comics, and video games in the &quot;Star Wars&quot; Expanded Universe.

Lucasfilm rebranded the Expanded Universe works as &quot;Star Wars Legends&quot; in 2014 and declared them non-canon to the franchise; however in the 2017 Chuck Wendig novel &quot;Star Wars: Aftermath: Empire&#x27;s End&quot;, the recurring character of B-1 (Mister Bones) is revealed to have been built from parts of HK-47 to help the fledging New Republic against the leaderless Galactic Empire, briefly taking over the droid with their &quot;strange, hard-angle&quot; accent.

==Development==
A BioWare developer posted to the company&#x27;s forum that HK-47 is named in homage of a dropship in &quot;Shattered Steel&quot;. However, &quot;Knights of the Old Republic&quot; lead writer Drew Karpyshyn claimed the name derived from his billiards team&#x27;s name, which in turn was partially derived from the AK-47; the &quot;Mister Bones&quot; nickname provided to the character&#x27;s B-1 battle droid form introduced in Chuck Wendig&#x27;s &quot;Star Wars: Aftermath&quot; trilogy is derived from how &quot;B-dash-O-N-E, looks like Bone or Bones.&quot;

==Appearances==
In &quot;Knights of the Old Republic&quot;, the player&#x27;s character purchases HK-47 on Tatooine. Dialogue establishes that Revan built the bloodthirsty droid, which characteristically refers to organic lifeforms as &quot;meatbags&quot;.

HK-47 is disabled at the beginning of &quot;The Sith Lords&quot;; the player&#x27;s character recovers material from damaged droids to repair HK-47. Dialogue in &quot;The Sith Lords&quot; expands on the droid&#x27;s backstory and purpose, establishing that Revan used the droid to kill people who destabilized or weakened the galaxy.

In the time frame of the &quot;Trials of Obi-Wan&quot; expansion to &quot;Star Wars Galaxies&quot;, HK-47&#x27;s artificial intelligence has transferred into a computer on a Galactic Republic cruiser that later crashed on Mustafar. The droid calls on players to complete several quests to return him to a droid body.

HK-47 was included as an action figure in the &quot;Champions of the Force&quot; line of &quot;Star Wars&quot; figures.

HK-47 returns in &quot;Star Wars: The Old Republic&quot; as a boss battle in two separate flashpoints and as a mini boss in a level 60 operation.

HK-47 is an unlockable character in the mobile game &quot;Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes&quot;.

The B-1 battle droid known as &quot;Mister Bones&quot;, rebuilt by New Republic supporter Temmin &quot;Snap&quot; Wexley from droid parts from a scrapyard, is revealed to have been built from parts of HK-47 in the 2017 Chuck Wendig novel &quot;Star Wars: Aftermath: Empire&#x27;s End&quot;, with HK-47 briefly taking over Bones after they &quot;glitch&quot; and their voice &quot;warps&quot;, causing their &quot;strange, hard-angle&quot; accent to return and say &quot;COMMENTARY: I SAY WE BLAST THE MEATBAG AND SAVE YOU THE TROUBLE, MASTER&quot;. Following Bones&#x27; destruction at the end of the novel, their programming briefly reappears in Marvel Comics&#x27; &quot;Star Wars: Poe Dameron&quot; #13 in before being destroyed again; the character previously appeared in &quot;Star Wars: Aftermath&quot; (2015) and &quot;Star Wars: Aftermath: Life Debt&quot; (2016).

==Promotion and reception==
At the 2004 Game Developers Choice Awards, the HK-47 character won the category of &quot;Original Game Character of the Year&quot;. The character also won &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot;″s 2003 &quot;NPC of the Year&quot; award. GameSpot called the character one of the coolest characters of 2003, saying he was possibly the most original &quot;Star Wars&quot; character in years. GamesRadar listed HK-47 as the 3rd best conceived character in video gaming, calling him &quot;cheerfully insane&quot; and saying he was &quot;[e]asily the highlight of the [&quot;Knights of the Old Republic&quot;] series&quot;. IGN chose the character as the 13th top &quot;Star Wars&quot; hero. GameDaily&#x27;s Robert Workman called HK-47 one of his favourite characters from &quot;Star Wars&quot; video games. GameDaily&#x27;s Chris Buffa also listed the assassin droid as one of their top 25 video game robots, praising its humour and in-game value. UGO Networks listed the character as one of the top 50 &quot;Star Wars&quot; expanded universe characters, noting his sarcastic personality made him unique among droids. &quot;GamesRadar&#x27;s&quot; identified HK-47 as an example of BioWare&#x27;s &quot;Kickass Robot&quot; character archetype, and listed it as one of the 25 best new characters of the decade, stating that &quot;Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic&quot; and HK-47 had some of the best characterization in &quot;Star Wars&quot; history, adding that HK-47 was one of the most memorable characters in the game.

&quot;Empire&quot; listed HK-47 as the 43rd greatest video game character, calling him &quot;brilliantly twisted&quot;. Dakota Grabowski of GameZone listed HK-47 as the second top BioWare created teammate, commenting that he delivered some of the best lines in &quot;Knights of the Old Republic&quot;. &quot;Game Informer&quot;″s Kimberley Wallace considered him to be one of the best BioWare characters, saying that &quot;While BioWare&#x27;s games have always had comic-relief characters, none have come close to the simple wisdom and mean-spiritedness of HK-47.&quot; Matt Miller from the same magazine called HK-47 the second top AI character of the decade, commenting that if the player chose to go light-side, then &quot;he is a perfect counter to your heroic actions&quot;. In 2010, &quot;Game Informer&quot; ranked HK-47 at #15 in &quot;The Top 30 Characters who Defined a Decade&quot; list, who called him the best character in &quot;Knights of the Old Republic&quot;. The magazine noted that his personality and humour &quot;[held] a mirror to Revan&#x27;s dual history with both sides of the Force&quot;, saying that he highlighted the overarching &quot;Star Wars&quot; theme of everyone having both good and evil in them. HK-47 was also voted as the 18th top character of the decade by &quot;Game Informer&quot;&#x27;s readers. GameSpy&#x27;s Mike Sharkey called HK-47 a noticeable omission from the 2011 &quot;Guinness World Records Gamer&#x27;s Edition&quot;″s top 50 video game characters. A reader&#x27;s poll published by IGN in December 2014 for their top ultimate RPG party choices, drawing from characters of several disparate RPG video game franchises, placed HK-47 at #13 under the &quot;Reserves&quot; section. &quot;Gamestm&quot; named HK-47&#x27;s one of BioWare’s 8 most memorable companion characters. Evan Lahti from &quot;PC Gamer&quot; named HK-47 as his personal favorite Bioware companion, commenting &quot;For all the well-rounded, nonarchetypal, and sensitive characters BioWare has thrown at us, I delight in the silliest, most murderous, and one-dimensional partner they&#x27;ve written.&quot; In a 2017 article, &quot;PC Gamer&quot; staff included HK-47 in their definitive list of the best RPG squad mates around. HK-47 placed second on &quot;App Trigger&#x27;s&quot; list of the 10 Best BioWare Companions.

<doc id="923669" wikidata="Q587585" url="?curid=923669" title="Lust for Life (Iggy Pop album)">
<text>Lust for Life is the second solo studio album by the American musician Iggy Pop, released on September 9, 1977, through RCA Records. It was his second collaboration with David Bowie after &quot;The Idiot&quot;, released in March the same year. Shortly after Bowie released his own album &quot;Low&quot; in January, Pop went on a tour to support &quot;The Idiot&quot; with Bowie as his keyboardist. At the tour&#x27;s conclusion, Pop and Bowie regrouped in Berlin to record the former&#x27;s next solo album.

&quot;Lust for Life&quot; was recorded at Hansa Studio by the Wall in West Berlin from May to June 1977, with production being handled by Bowie, Pop, and the engineer Colin Thurston. The touring band of Pop, Bowie, the guitarist Ricky Gardiner, and brothers Tony Fox and Hunt Sales on bass and drums, respectively, comprised the primary lineup for the album. After &quot;The Idiot&quot; was mostly composed by Bowie, Pop was adamant about having more control over &quot;Lust for Life&quot;, often composing his own arrangements, including for &quot;Sixteen&quot;. This resulted in a hard rock and proto-punk sound more akin to his older style with the band the Stooges. Pop would use Bowie&#x27;s arrangements for some songs, including the well-known title track.

Upon release, &quot;Lust for Life&quot; received little promotion from RCA but nevertheless peaked at number 28 on the UK Albums Chart and remained Pop&#x27;s highest-charting album there until 2016&#x27;s &quot;Post Pop Depression&quot;. It also peaked at number 8 in the Netherlands and number 120 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Top LPs &amp; Tape chart. Critically, &quot;Lust for Life&quot; was well-received, with many praising Pop&#x27;s energetic performance throughout and his greater role compared to &quot;The Idiot&quot;; the former would later be regarded as one of his best works and has appeared on several best album lists. It was Pop and Bowie&#x27;s final collaboration until the mid-1980s.

==Background==

After a period of drug addiction, Iggy Pop joined his friend David Bowie on his 1976 Isolar Tour and afterwards, moved to Europe with him in hopes of getting sober. After moving into the Château d&#x27;Hérouville in Hérouville, France, Bowie decided to produce Pop&#x27;s first solo album. Recorded from June to August 1976, &quot;The Idiot&quot; was Pop&#x27;s first release since the breakup of his former band the Stooges in 1974. The majority of the music was composed by Bowie, while Pop wrote most of the lyrics, often in response to the music being composed. Due to Bowie&#x27;s major influence on its creation, &quot;The Idiot&quot; marked a departure from the proto-punk sound of the Stooges, in favor of a style more akin to art rock. After the album&#x27;s completion, Bowie recorded his own album, &quot;Low&quot;, in a style reminiscent of &quot;The Idiot&quot;. Bowie&#x27;s label RCA Records released &quot;Low&quot; in January 1977 and due to its unexpected commercial success, Bowie persuaded RCA to release &quot;The Idiot&quot; in March. The album became the biggest commercial success involving Pop up to that point, reaching the top 40 in both the US and the UK charts.

Bowie declined to promote &quot;Low&quot;, opting instead to support Pop on a tour of his own. With himself on keyboards, Bowie assembled a band that included Ricky Gardiner on guitar, with brothers Tony Fox and Hunt Sales on bass and drums, respectively. Rehearsals began in mid-February 1977 and the tour began at the start of March.
Songs played included popular Stooges numbers, a couple of tracks from &quot;The Idiot&quot;, and tracks that would appear on &quot;Lust for Life&quot;, including &quot;Tonight&quot;, &quot;Some Weird Sin&quot;, and &quot;Turn Blue&quot;. Bowie was adamant about not taking the spotlight away from Pop, often staying behind his keyboard and not addressing the audience. The tour ended on April 16. The success of &quot;The Idiot&quot; and the tour earned Pop fame and success greater than he ever achieved with the Stooges. However, during interviews, he was often asked about Bowie more than his own work. This frustrated Pop and led to him realizing that for their next collaboration, he would have to take more control.

==Recording==

At the end of the tour, Pop and Bowie returned to Berlin to start writing. To further achieve his own identity, Pop moved out of the apartment he was sharing with Bowie and his assistant Coco Schwab, relocating to his own place in the same building. The two continued writing for a few weeks before they were joined by Gardiner in May 1977, who recalled that &quot;quite a few ideas were already present&quot;. The trio spent a small number of weeks writing, devising tracks such as &quot;The Passenger&quot; and &quot;Lust for Life&quot;. At the end of May, they moved to the Hansa Studio by the Wall to begin recording. The rhythm section of Hunt and Tony Sales on drums and bass, respectively, returned from the tour, along with guitarist Carlos Alomar who was brought in by Bowie as a musical director. Bowie reduced his role significantly from &quot;The Idiot&quot;, solely contributing keyboards like the tour. Gardiner recalled that because they were already a &quot;tour-hardened band&quot;, there was a more &quot;live&quot; feel to the tracks than &quot;The Idiot&quot;. For the impromptu &quot;Fall in Love with Me&quot;, the band swapped instruments: Hunt played bass, Tony Fox played guitar, and Gardiner played drums.

Bowie, Pop, and producer-engineer Colin Thurston produced &quot;Lust for Life&quot; under the pseudonym &quot;Bewlay Bros.&quot;, named after the final track on Bowie&#x27;s 1971 album &quot;Hunky Dory&quot;. Pop did not sleep much during its making, commenting &quot;See, Bowie&#x27;s a hell of a fast guy ... I realized I had to be quicker than him, otherwise whose album was it gonna be?&quot; He worked frequently with the Sales brothers and Gardiner, even rejecting some musical arrangements Bowie provided him for a few tracks, including &quot;Success&quot;. Pop prepared only fragments of lyrics before singing, and essentially improvised at the microphone. This spontaneous lyrical method inspired Bowie to improvise his own words on his next studio album &quot;&quot;Heroes&quot;&quot; (1977). According to Pop, the entire album was written, recorded, and mixed in eight days, starting in May and finishing in June.

==Music and themes==
&quot;Lust for Life&quot; is generally considered to be more of a pop record than the Bowie-dominated &quot;The Idiot&quot;, being less experimental and having more of a rock and roll flavor. Overall, reviewers have characterized &quot;Lust for Life&quot; as garage rock, hard rock, proto-punk and new wave. However, some of its themes are similarly dark, as in &quot;The Passenger&quot;, cited by &quot;NME&quot; editors Roy Carr and Charles Shaar Murray as one of Pop&#x27;s &quot;most haunting&quot; tracks, and &quot;Tonight&quot; and &quot;Turn Blue&quot;, both of which deal with heroin abuse. In contrast were more upbeat songs such as &quot;Success&quot; and &quot;Lust for Life&quot;, the latter of which was described by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; as Pop&#x27;s &quot;survivor message to the masses&quot;.

According to Pop, Bowie&#x27;s celebrated riff on &quot;Lust for Life&quot; was inspired by the Morse code opening to the American Forces Network news in Berlin. At various points in the song, the melody is doubled by the entire band; in Alomar&#x27;s words, &quot;You can&#x27;t play a counter-rhythm to that, you just had to follow.&quot; Joy Division drummer Stephen Morris declared, &quot;On &quot;Lust for Life&quot; the drums sound not huge but massive! The loudest cymbals known to man, that riff! I wanted to sound like that, still do.&quot;

&quot;The Passenger&quot; was inspired by a Jim Morrison poem that saw &quot;modern life as a journey by car&quot;, as well as rides on the Berlin S-Bahn, according to Pop&#x27;s former girlfriend Esther Friedmann. The lyrics have also been interpreted as &quot;Iggy&#x27;s knowing commentary on Bowie&#x27;s cultural vampirism&quot;. The music, a &quot;laid-back ... springy groove&quot;, was composed by Gardiner. Characterized by AllMusic as &quot;a glorious throwaway&quot; and by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; as &quot;an infectious throwaway&quot;, &quot;Success&quot; is a light-hearted track of the call and response variety.

At just under seven minutes, &quot;Turn Blue&quot;, the longest song on &quot;Lust for Life&quot;, was a sprawling confessional that dated back to an abortive recording session by Bowie and Pop in May 1975, when the latter was in the depths of his drug addiction. Originally titled &quot;Moving On&quot;, it was composed by Bowie, Pop, Walter Lacey, and Warren Peace. It was the only set of lyrics that did not appear on the original vinyl record sleeve. The album&#x27;s remaining tracks included &quot;Sixteen&quot;, the only piece written entirely by Pop; &quot;Some Weird Sin&quot;, a hard rock number featuring a &quot;lost-boy lyric&quot;; the &quot;neo-punk&quot; &quot;Neighborhood Threat&quot;; and &quot;Fall in Love with Me&quot;, which grew from an impromptu jam by the band to which Pop composed lyrics apparently evoking Friedmann.

==Artwork and release==
The cover photo was by Andy Kent, who also shot the cover for &quot;The Idiot&quot;. It was taken in Pop&#x27;s dressing room while he was preparing to talk to an interviewer during his UK tour. Kent stated: &quot;It was a lucky great shot. This was Jimmy. The nice guy, a guy you&#x27;d like to hang out with.&quot; Nicholas Pegg writes that the cover provides a stark contrast to &quot;The Idiot&quot;, in that Pop&#x27;s healthy appearance and smiling gaze represent &quot;Lust for Life&quot;″s overall positive tone compared to its predecessor.

&quot;Lust for Life&quot; was released through RCA on September 9, 1977, with the catalog number RCA PL-12488. It received little promotion from RCA, primarily due to the death of Elvis Presley two weeks earlier, whose catalog the label was adamant on reissuing. Although RCA had pressed decent quantities of the album, once the first pressings were sold out, there were none left. Tony Sales recalled: &quot;&quot;Lust for Life&quot; just disappeared from the shelves, and that was it.&quot; Paul Trynka notes that whereas &quot;The Idiot&quot; had received a decent amount of press coverage, &quot;Lust for Life&quot;, which he calls &quot;the most overtly commercial album of Iggy Pop&#x27;s career&quot;—and the record that marked his &quot;return to health and happiness&quot;—received little, contributing to its poor performance.

Despite little promotion and lack of vinyl pressings, &quot;Lust for Life&quot; managed to peak at number 28 on the UK Albums Chart and remained Pop&#x27;s highest-charting release in the UK until 2016&#x27;s &quot;Post Pop Depression&quot;. It also peaked at number 120 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Top LPs &amp; Tape chart, and performed well in the Netherlands, peaking at number 8. &quot;Success&quot;, backed with &quot;The Passenger&quot;, was released on September 30, 1977, as a single from the album, but failed to chart.

===Tour===
With little promotion from the label, Pop continued touring. The Sales brothers were brought back for the tour, while the Canadian guitarist Stacy Heydon, who worked with Bowie on his 1976 Isolar Tour, replaced Gardiner on guitar. Bowie, promoting &quot;Heroes&quot;, was replaced on keyboards by former Stooges member Scott Thurston. The band performed 40 gigs in almost nine weeks and received positive reviews. The critic Lester Bangs of &quot;NME&quot;, who gave negative assessments for both &quot;The Idiot&quot; and &quot;Lust for Life&quot;, praised Pop&#x27;s on-stage energy. Thurston recalled Pop being more professional than his days touring with the Stooges; he attributed this to him turning 30 years old. Thurston and Pop became good friends during the tour, although Pop still suffered from bouts of alcohol and cocaine use, as well as financial troubles. Pop fired the Sales brothers at the end of the tour.

==Critical reception==
On release, &quot;Lust for Life&quot; was met with positive reviews from music critics. In a contemporary review, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; critic Billy Altman considered that &quot;purely on its own terms, &quot;Lust for Life&quot; is a successful album&quot;, but complained that Pop&#x27;s &quot;new stance is so utterly unchallenging and cautious&quot;. By contrast, Robert Christgau of &quot;The Village Voice&quot; refuted the critical opinion that Pop&#x27;s &quot;creative power has dissipated&quot;, finding &quot;The Idiot&quot; and &quot;Lust for Life&quot; to be more consistent than Pop&#x27;s albums with the Stooges. He later noted that of the two, he preferred &quot;Lust for Life&quot; &quot;because it&#x27;s faster and more assertive—which means, among other things, that the nihilistic satire is counteracted by the forward motion of the music itself&quot;.

Kris Needs of &quot;ZigZag&quot; felt &quot;Lust for Life&quot; is not as &quot;consistent&quot; as its predecessor. He nevertheless considered the album one of his favorite albums of 1977, finding it to be more of a &quot;day&quot; record with its predecessor being a &quot;night&quot; record. In &quot;Sounds&quot;, Pete Makowski praised the record, calling it &quot;excellent&quot;. He complimented the band&#x27;s performance and Pop&#x27;s vocals, labeling them &quot;a bit jagged but powerful&quot;. Writing for &quot;NME&quot;, Max Bell gave the record a positive review, calling it &quot;quite good&quot;. He praised Pop&#x27;s greater role compared to &quot;The Idiot&quot;, as well as his vocal performance. However, he was critical of some tracks, including &quot;Some Weird Sin&quot;, &quot;Tonight&quot;, and &quot;Success&quot;, the last of which he considered &quot;&#x27;Fame&#x27; revisited&quot;. &quot;Lust for Life&quot; was ranked the eighth best album of the year by &quot;NME&quot; in their end-of-year list.

Retrospectively, &quot;Lust for Life&quot; has continued to receive positive reviews. Writing for AllMusic, Mark Deming called &quot;Lust for Life&quot; Pop&#x27;s best solo work, stating that with the record, he &quot;managed to channel the aggressive power of his work with the Stooges with the intelligence and perception of &quot;The Idiot&quot;, and the result was the best of both worlds&quot;. Trynka calls &quot;Lust for Life&quot; Pop&#x27;s &quot;most effervescent, optimistic album&quot;, praising Pop&#x27;s greater contribution to the record over its predecessor. Reviewing the album as part of the 2020 box set &quot;The Bowie Years&quot;, Sasha Geffen of &quot;Pitchfork&quot; praised Pop&#x27;s performance, writing that he managed to put more of himself into the record than &quot;The Idiot&quot;.

==Aftermath and legacy==

At the end of the tour, Pop became fed up with RCA and decided he was going to quickly finish his contract with a live album. The album, assembled from soundboard tapes from the two prior tours and given quick touch-ups by Edu Meyer at Hansa, was released as &quot;TV Eye Live&quot; in May 1978. It earned him a decent payout from RCA. Prior to its release, recordings Pop had made with former Stooges member James Williamson in 1975 were released in November 1977 through Bomp! Records as &quot;Kill City&quot;, credited jointly to Pop and Williamson. After leaving RCA, Pop signed with Arista Records; his first album for them, &quot;New Values&quot;, was produced by Williamson and released in the fall of 1979.

Although Bowie had told interviewers that he planned to do a third collaboration with Pop in 1978, &quot;Lust for Life&quot; would be the two&#x27;s last official collaboration until the mid-1980s. Pop co-wrote tracks with Bowie for the latter&#x27;s 1984 album &quot;Tonight&quot;, while Bowie would co-write and co-produce Pop&#x27;s 1986 album &quot;Blah-Blah-Blah&quot;. For &quot;Tonight&quot;, Bowie covered three of Pop&#x27;s tracks, including two off &quot;Lust for Life&quot;: &quot;Neighborhood Threat&quot; and &quot;Tonight&quot;, which he dueted with singer Tina Turner and removed the opening drug-related lines, and &quot;Don&#x27;t Look Down&quot; from &quot;New Values&quot;. Siouxsie and the Banshees recorded a cover of &quot;The Passenger&quot; with brass instruments on their 1987 album &quot;Through the Looking Glass&quot;. Pop praised it, commenting: &quot;She threw a little note in when she sings it that I wish I had thought of, it&#x27;s kind of improved it [...] The horn thing is good.&quot; Bowie reconnected with the Sales brothers in 1989 when they formed their hard rock band Tin Machine.

The title track gained renewed popularity in the late 1990s after being featured in the 1996 British comedy film &quot;Trainspotting&quot;. The song was heavily featured in the film&#x27;s marketing campaign and subsequent soundtrack album, resulting in a new UK chart peak of number 26 after being reissued as a single. The single&#x27;s success inspired Pop&#x27;s then-label Virgin Records to issue a greatest hits compilation titled &quot;Nude &amp; Rude&quot;. Joe Ambrose writes that it gained the same level of resurgence as the Doors&#x27; &quot;The End&quot; (1967) after the latter&#x27;s inclusion in Francis Ford Coppola&#x27;s 1979 film &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot;. In 1999, Pop reflected on the song&#x27;s renewed popularity:

&quot;Lust for Life&quot; has appeared on several best-of lists by multiple publications. &quot;Sounds&quot; and &quot;Mojo&quot; ranked the album 21st and 44th in their lists of the 100 greatest albums of all time in 1986 and 1995, respectively. &quot;Pitchfork&quot; ranked &quot;Lust for Life&quot; number 64 in its list of the 100 Best Albums of the 1970s in 2004. In 2013, &quot;NME&quot; ranked the album 217th in their list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. It was also included in the 2018 edition of Robert Dimery&#x27;s book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;.

===2020 deluxe edition===
On April 10, 2020, Pop released an alternate mix of &quot;China Girl&quot; from &quot;The Idiot&quot; in promotion of then-upcoming album &quot;The Bowie Years&quot;, a seven-disc deluxe box set featuring expanded remastered versions of &quot;The Idiot&quot; and &quot;Lust for Life&quot;. The box set, released on May 29, includes remastered versions of both albums along with outtakes, alternate mixes, and a 40-page book. The two original albums were also re-released individually, each paired with an additional album of live material to create separate stand-alone two-disc deluxe editions.

<doc id="923678" wikidata="Q454834" url="?curid=923678" title="Amaran (band)">
<text>Amaran was a Swedish metal band. Their music can be described to have heavy metal guitars combined with the clear voice of singer Johanna DePierre.

==History==
=== Formation ===
The band was named after a Hindi term for &quot;undying&quot; or &quot;everlasting&quot;. Amaran started out as a band in the spring of 2000, in Stockholm, Sweden, and then developed a dynamic and original way of writing songs, combining heavy metal guitars with clear female vocals. Guitarists Kari Kainulainen and Ronnie Backlund started writing some music together and decided to form a band. They found the rest of the band members in bass player Mikael Andersson, vocalist Johanna DePierre and drummer Robin Bergh. All of the members came from different musical backgrounds and were eager to produce music together.

=== &quot;Promo&quot; (2001) ===
Before they had even found a drummer Amaran recorded their first &quot;Promo&quot; using a drum machine and sent it to various zines, magazines and record labels. It received excellent reviews in many well-acclaimed contexts, and also ended up landing them a record deal with the French record label, Listenable Records.

=== &quot;A World Depraved&quot; (2002) ===
The band set out to record their debut album &quot;A World Depraved&quot; in February 2002 in Aabenraa Studio in Denmark together with Jacob Hansen. The album was released over Europe and was highly recommended by critics and fans all over. The album was often described as somewhat original, in the sense that the combination of heavy guitars and intense drums and the clear female vocals was not something that people were used to hearing.

===&quot; Pristine In Bondage&quot; (2004)===
Amaran was eager to write new songs after the release of the debut and developed a whole lot in this process and as a band during 2002. Since the band was pretty young when they landed the record deal they went through a whole lot both on a personal and professional level, and became tighter as a band. The band finished about 14 songs that they wanted to record and agreed with Listenable to record the follow-up in April 2003. The new material was oriented in a heavier direction as to accentuate the dynamics between the instrumental and the vocals further. The album was recorded in Studio Underground, Sweden with Pelle Saether and was entitled &quot;Pristine in Bondage&quot;. Shortly after finishing the recording of the second album, bass player Mikael decided that he wanted to leave the band for personal reasons. Fortunately they quickly found someone to replace him in Ronnie Bergerståhl, an experienced bass player and drummer who was a personal friend and had filled in for Mikael before.

&quot;Pristine in Bondage&quot; was set to be released through Listenable Records on 17 December in Japan (containing three bonus tracks) and, in January, in Europe and the US containing 11 tracks. Amaran has also recorded a video for the song &quot;Inflict&quot; on the new album, and was set to go on promotion tours in the fall and in January connected the release of the album.

=== Break up ===
Drummer Robin Bergh left the band for personal reasons in 2004, he was replaced with Pär Hjulström. 2005 saw a parade of new members pass through Amaran, culminating in December with the dissolution of the band. Primary among the reasons for this is the departure of lead singer Johanna DePierre, and the band&#x27;s inability to find a suitable replacement (Amaran&#x27;s sole focus as a band was heavy riffs with clean female vocals). Amaran officially broke up on December 28, 2005.

<text>Paul Albert &quot;Mousie&quot; Garner (July 31, 1909 – August 8, 2004) was an American actor. Garner earned his nickname by assuming the role of a shy, simpering jokester. He was one of the last actors still doing shtick from vaudeville, and has been referred to as &quot;The Grand Old Man Of Vaudeville.&quot;

==Biography==
He was born on July 31, 1909, in Washington, D.C.

In addition to big-time vaudeville, Mousie Garner appeared on Broadway and in major national touring companies; in short subjects, feature films and documentaries; on network television, cable and radio shows; and in nightclubs, auditoriums and concert halls.

Mousie Garner made his stage debut as a child in 1913, singing, dancing and imitating Al Jolson in a family musical-comedy act developed by his father. While still a child, Garner entertained soldiers during World War I. By the time he was a teenager in the 1920s, he had already decided upon a career on the vaudeville stage.

==Mousie Garner and the Three Stooges==

Stage star Ted Healy worked with three rowdy stooges (showbiz slang for &quot;assistants&quot;): Moe Howard, Larry Fine, and Shemp Howard (and later Curly Howard). When Howard, Fine, and Howard chose to work on their own, first in 1930 and later in 1934 as &quot;The Three Stooges&quot;, Healy promptly replaced them with three new stooges. Mousie Garner worked alongside his cousin, Jack Wolf (father of Warner Wolf) and Richard &quot;Dick&quot; Hakins between 1922 and 1936. Mousie Garner continued working on stage and on screen with Dick Hakins, and either his cousin Jack Wolf or Wolf&#x27;s replacement, Sammy Wolfe, in a musical comedy trio known as The Gentlemaniacs (aka: Garner, Wolf [or Wolfe] and Hakins) throughout the 1920s and &#x27;30s. The Gentlemaniacs starred in several feature films and short subjects including &quot;After the Show&quot; (1929), &quot;Swing It, Professor&quot; (1937), &quot;The Hit Parade&quot; (1937), &quot;Murder with Reservations&quot; (1938) and &quot;Radio and Relatives&quot; (1940). Garner, however, &quot;almost&quot; became one of the Three Stooges on two occasions.

According to Garner&#x27;s autobiography, after Shemp Howard died suddenly in November 1955, Moe Howard and Larry Fine wanted Garner to join them in 1956, but Garner was then under contract to Spike Jones as a musical comedian with Jones&#x27;s band, the City Slickers. Despite Moe Howard pleading his case to Jones personally, Jones would not release Garner; Joe Besser would eventually replace Shemp in 1956. The claim in Garner&#x27;s autobiography cannot be accepted as a whole truth since a similar story can be found in Moe&#x27;s autobiography, but with Joe DeRita as the protagonist instead of Garner and Harold Minsky instead of Jones. After Besser quit the act in 1958, Larry suggested Garner again as a potential replacement and he and Moe would later rehearse with Garner. However, based on his tryout performance, Moe later remarked that Garner was &quot;completely unacceptable&quot; for the act. Joe DeRita would instead become the &quot;third stooge&quot; in October 1958. Nevertheless, in the early 1970s, DeRita, with Moe&#x27;s blessing, would invite Garner and Frank Mitchell to join the &quot;New Three Stooges&quot; act, filling in for the ailing Larry and Moe, respectively.

==Entertaining the troops==
Serving in the U.S. Army during World War II, Garner was shipped overseas and he achieved the rank of technical sergeant before completing his term. He participated in the Allied forces&#x27; North African campaign, and was injured twice on duty. He received several commendations and after recovering from his wartime injuries, Garner joined the U.S.O. to star in Ole Olsen and Chic Johnson&#x27;s &quot;Sons O&#x27; Fun&quot;, the touring version of &quot;Hellzapoppin&#x27;&quot;. The show was staged for servicemen throughout Europe during the Allies&#x27; postwar occupation. Garner&#x27;s service in the U.S.O. would continue throughout both the Korean and Vietnam conflicts, as he continued to entertain the troops throughout the 1950s and &#x27;60s.

While living in Los Angeles in the 1950s and 1960s, Garner continued to work as a comic with the U.S.O., as a touring solo and ensemble stage comedian and as a television performer.

==Television==
Garner appeared on &quot;The Colgate Comedy Hour&quot;, &quot;The Jack Benny Program&quot;, &quot;Cavalcade of Stars&quot;, &quot;The Jackie Gleason Show&quot;, &quot;The NBC Comedy Hour&quot;, and &quot;Perry Como&#x27;s Kraft Music Hall&quot; throughout the 1950s.

By the 1960s, Garner was a popular character actor on such television programs as &quot;Maverick&quot;, &quot;Alcoa Presents: One Step Beyond&quot;, &quot;Lock Up&quot;, &quot;Surfside 6&quot;, &quot;The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis&quot;, &quot;77 Sunset Strip&quot;, &quot;Wendy and Me&quot;, &quot;The Munsters&quot;, &quot;Petticoat Junction&quot;, &quot;No Time For Sergeants&quot;, &quot;Mister Roberts&quot;, &quot;Honey West&quot;, &quot;Mr. Terrific&quot;, &quot;I Dream of Jeannie&quot;, &quot;Get Smart&quot;, and &quot;Julia&quot;. Throughout the 1970s, Garner continued to appear on television variety shows like &quot;The Red Skelton Show&quot; and &quot;The Bobby Vinton Show&quot;. In the 1980s, Garner continued to accept bit roles on such television programs as &quot;CHiPs&quot;, &quot;Brothers&quot;, and Emmy Award winning &quot;Amazing Stories&quot;.

In 1964, Garner appeared in the film &quot;For Those Who Think Young&quot; and also played a bit part in &quot;Last of the Red Hot Lovers&quot; in 1972. That same year, Garner appeared in the made-for-TV movie &quot;Goodnight, My Love&quot; which was followed by his appearance in &quot;Frasier, the Sensuous Lion&quot; (1973) and &quot;American Raspberry&quot; (1977). In 1980, Garner appeared in the made-for-TV movie &quot;The Dream Merchants&quot; as well as &quot;Cheech and Chong&#x27;s Next Movie&quot; (1980). In 1981, Garner was featured in the Richard Benjamin film &quot;Saturday the 14th&quot; and would go on to play bit parts in &quot;Rhinestone&quot; (1984) and &quot;Avenging Angel&quot; (1985). Garner also played Billy Crystal&#x27;s Uncle Lou in &quot;Billy Crystal: A Comic&#x27;s Line&quot; (1984) and a zany cameraman in David Lee Roth&#x27;s &quot;Just a Gigolo&quot; (1985) music video. In 1985, Garner played a bit part in the film &quot;Stoogemania&quot;. In 1988, Garner appeared with Sid Caesar, Danny Thomas and Milton Berle in the made-for-TV film &quot;Side By Side&quot;. In 1994 he appeared in the film &quot;Radioland Murders&quot; as an homage to his work with Spike Jones and His City Slickers. He also appeared as Uncle Smackers, a character in &quot;The Onion Movie&quot;, a feature film produced by David Zucker, renowned for &quot;Airplane!&quot; and the &quot;Naked Gun&quot; series, which was released in 2008.

Garner enjoyed a successful 75-year career as a comedian and show business professional.

Mousie Garner appears in several entertainment biographies including &quot;Spike Jones and His City Slickers: An Illustrated Biography&quot;, &quot;Moe Howard &amp; The Three Stooges&quot;, &quot;The Stooge Chronicles&quot;, and &quot;The Stoogephile Trivia Book&quot;, and in 2002 he wrote the introduction to &quot;The Three Stooges: The Triumphs and Tragedies of The Most Popular Comedy Team of All Time&quot;. His autobiography, entitled &quot;Mousie Garner: Autobiography of a Vaudeville Stooge&quot;, was published in 1999. His nephew, Stephen Garner, a professional magician from Maryland, supplied most of the pictures for the book.

==Death==
After suffering from kidney problems, Garner died on August 8, 2004, at Verdugo Hills Hospital in Glendale, California, just over a week after his 95th birthday. Garner was interred with his family at the Bnai Israel Cemetery in Oxon Hill, Maryland. He was the last major celebrity associated with Ted Healy and the Three Stooges to die.

<doc id="923685" wikidata="Q9086" url="?curid=923685" title="Jeremy Wariner">
<text>Jeremy Matthew Wariner (born January 31, 1984) is a retired American track athlete specializing in the 400 meters. He has won four Olympic medals (three gold, one silver) and six World Championships medals. He is the joint sixth fastest competitor in the history of the 400 m event with a personal best of 43.45 seconds, behind Wayde van Niekerk (43.03 WR, 2016), Michael Johnson (43.18 WR, 1999) and Butch Reynolds (43.29 WR, 1988) and the fifth fastest all-time mark when he set it in 2007.

Wariner was born in Irving, Texas. A successful college athlete at Baylor University, he won the 400 m and 4 × 400 m relay gold medals at his first Olympics in Athens 2004. He followed this with two gold medals at the 2005 World Championships in the same events. He remained undefeated in the 400 m event during the 2006 ÅF Golden League, earning him the $250,000 jackpot. He remained World Champion in the 400 m individual and relay events at the 2007 Osaka World Championships, earning him the 2007 Best Male Track Athlete ESPY Award. He won the 4×400 m relay gold medal at the 2008 Beijing Olympics, but took silver in the 400 m, finishing behind countryman LaShawn Merritt. Wariner picked up the silver medal in the 2009 World Championships, again finishing second to Merritt.

==Early career==
Jeremy Wariner attended Lamar High School in Arlington, Texas, participating in multiple sports and being recognized for his outstanding speed. Under the coaching of Mike Nelson, who also coached 110 meters hurdler Reggie Harrell at Lamar High School, he was the 2002 Texas 5A state sprint champion at both 200 meters and 400 meters, setting high school bests of 20.41 seconds (wind assisted) and 45.57 seconds, respectively. Enrolling at Baylor University, he quickly established himself as a collegiate sprint talent under the guidance of Clyde Hart, who was also coach of Baylor alumnus and four-time Olympic 400 m gold medal winner and two-time world champion Michael Johnson. Somewhat hampered by injuries late in his freshman year, Wariner regained form as a sophomore, winning both the 2004 NCAA Division I indoor and outdoor 400 metres titles. Later that year, he claimed the national 400 m title at the USATF Championships making him the favorite for the gold medal at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens.

Wariner then made his first appearance on the world athletic stage at the 2004 Summer Olympics. He won two Olympic gold medals, the first in the 400 m in a personal best 44.00 seconds and the second as the third leg of the U.S. 4 × 400 m relay team. Following his Olympic successes, he turned professional, forgoing the rest of his collegiate eligibility, though he remained at his parents&#x27; house and continued to be coached by Clyde Hart.

==Professional career==
The next year, Wariner won the 400 m at the 2005 USATF championship with a time of 44.20 s. At the Helsinki World Championships on a cold and rainy day he won the 400 m in 43.93 seconds. He would then anchor the American team in the 4 × 400 m relay for the gold medal.

Early in 2006, Wariner competed in the 200 m lowering his personal best to 20.19 s. Later that year he would set a new personal best of 43.62 seconds at 400 m at the Golden Gala Meet in Rome. Together with Asafa Powell (100 m) and Sanya Richards (women&#x27;s 400 m) he won his sixth out of six Golden League events (400 m) in the same season, which earned him a total of $250,000.

In 2007 he filled a summer with dominating 400 m performances culminating with the Osaka World Championships where on August 31, 2007 he would win the 400 m in 43.45 s thereby improving his personal best to become the then-third-fastest of all time (only Michael Johnson and Butch Reynolds had run faster).

===Rivalry with Merritt===
In 2008, Wariner left long-time coach Clyde Hart in favor of working with Baylor assistant coach Michael Ford. This was an unexpected move as Wariner had much success under Hart, who had also coached his agent Michael Johnson. Wariner stated that he needed a change as Hart was nearing retirement, although the coach said that the split was due to a pay dispute. By the time of the 2008 USATF championship Wariner and Johnson had to face many probing questions regarding the reasons for such a change in an Olympic year. He finished second to LaShawn Merritt in the 400 m final of the USATF championship and secured his place on the U.S. Olympic team in the 400 m event and the 4×400 m relay team.

In the 2008 Olympics, Wariner qualified for the final with a time of 44.12 s, in a run which he slowed down considerably in the final fifty meters. This led to much anticipation that he could beat Michael Johnson&#x27;s world record in the final, but instead he took the silver, losing to LaShawn Merritt by nearly a second. David Neville came in third completing a United States sweep of the 400 m.

Following his disappointment with the silver medal at the Olympics, Wariner admitted he had made a mistake in sacking Hart. He apologized to the emeritus coach after Johnson advised him that his new workout programme with Ford was lacking in some areas and took him back on as coach. The emergence of Merritt had left Wariner as the second-best athlete for the first time in his professional career.

In the 2009 World Championships, Wariner won the silver medal in the 400 m, again finishing behind LaShawn Merritt, and the gold medal in the 4 × 400 m relay.

===2012 London Olympics===
Wariner was named to his third Olympic team as part of the Team USA 4 × 400 m relay squad. The two-time Olympic medalist in the 400m had failed to make the individual 400m event after starting poorly and finishing sixth in 45.24 seconds in the US Olympic Trials in Eugene, Oregon on June 24, 2012. At the Olympics as part of the relay squad, Wariner pulled out of the team due to a torn hamstring.

===2013 comeback===
In March 2013, Wariner returned to victory by becoming the National Champion at 400 m at the USA Indoor Track &amp; Field Championships. However at the 2013 USA Outdoor Track and Field Championships, Wariner was unable to get out of the qualifying round, finishing dead last in his qualifying heat and the field. He ran 44.96 at the 2016 Mt. SAC Relays to qualify for the 2016 United States Olympic Trials. At the time it was the #2 time in the world behind only Martyn Rooney&#x27;s 44.92 set a few minutes earlier on the same track. But at the trials, he pulled up 250 meters into the semifinal race.

=== Accolades and awards ===

In 2014, Wariner was inducted into the Baylor Bears Hall of Fame.

He was Inducted into the Texas Track and Field Coaches Hall of Fame, Class of 2016.

===Track records===

As of 19 September 2024, Wariner holds the following track records for 400 metres.

==Personal bests==
==Personal life==
Wariner married attorney Sarah Nichols (now Wariner) in 2011. Together, the couple raises three children: Isabella, Lincoln, and Elijah. Outside of their personal careers, the Wariners own a Jimmy John&#x27;s franchise in Dallas, Texas, where Jeremy also serves as general manager.

Wariner was previously head track coach at Parish Episcopal School in Dallas. In July 2023, he moved to Liberty Christian School (Argyle, Texas) to be their head track and cross country coach, along with becoming their sports information and media coordinator.

In the summer of 2018, Wariner was a &quot;flex&quot; player for Godspeed, a flag football team made mostly of former professional American football players that participated in the American Flag Football League (AFFL). The team was crowned the champion of participating pro teams but lost in the final match to the amateur champion team.

His maternal great-great-great-grandmother was Cherokee.

==Rankings==
Wariner was ranked among the best in the US and the world in the 400 m sprint event in the period 2004 to 2013, according to the votes of the experts of &quot;Track and Field News&quot;.

<doc id="923686" wikidata="Q60392" url="?curid=923686" title="Lothar von Richthofen">
<text>Lothar Siegfried Freiherr von Richthofen (27 September 1894 – 4 July 1922) was a German First World War fighter ace credited with 40 victories. He was a younger brother of top-scoring ace Manfred von Richthofen (the &quot;Red Baron&quot;) and a distant cousin of Luftwaffe Field Marshal Wolfram von Richthofen, who also became a flying ace.

Following the war, Lothar worked for a while on a farm before taking an industrial position. He married in June 1919 and had two children. Yearning for aviation, he accepted a position as a pilot, conveying passengers and postal mail between Berlin and Hamburg.

He died aged 27 on 4 July 1922 in a flying accident at Fuhlsbüttel.

== Early career ==
Richthofen was born on 27 September 1894. He and his brothers, Manfred and Bolko, hunted wild boar, elk, birds, and deer.

Like his brother Manfred, Lothar began the war as a cavalry officer with the 4th Dragoon Regiment. He had remained in the public Gymnasium (high school), he was enrolled in compulsory military training at the Kriegsschule in Danzig (Gdańsk, Poland) when war began. On his own initiative Lothar returned to his unit. Lothar was nearly cut down by sniper fire while on patrol. In mid-October 1914, while stationed at Attigny, he was awarded the Iron Cross 2nd Class for valour. It was the only decoration that Lothar received during his cavalry service. The following month, his regiment was transferred to the Eastern Front.

== &quot;Jagdstaffel 11&quot; ==
In February 1915 Manfred &quot;rescued&quot; his brother Lothar from the boredom of training new troops in Luben and encouraged him to also transfer to the &quot;Fliegertruppe&quot;.

Richthofen joined the German Army Air Service (&quot;Luftstreitkräfte&quot;) in late 1915. He served from January 1916 as an observer with &quot;Jasta&quot; 23, sometimes observing for Otto Creutzmann and saw action during the Battle of Verdun. He won the Iron Cross 1st Class in December and then began training as a pilot.
His first posting as a pilot was to his brother&#x27;s &quot;Jasta 11&quot; on 6 March 1917. An impulsive and aggressive pilot, unlike his coolly calculating brother Manfred, Lothar&#x27;s first victory claim followed on 28 March for an FE 2b of No. 25 Squadron, Royal Flying Corps. The German high command appreciated the propaganda value of two Richthofens fighting together to defeat the enemy in the air.

Taking part in the period of German dominance called Bloody April by the British, Lothar had won 15 more victories by the beginning of May. When his brother went on leave, Lothar von Richthofen assumed command of the squadron.

== Albert Ball ==
During the first week of May 1917, Lothar von Richthofen scored three more victories. On the evening of 7 May near Douai, he led a flight of 5 Albatros D.III&#x27;s from &quot;Jasta 11&quot; that encountered 11 S.E.5s from the &quot;elite&quot; No. 56 Squadron RFC, including the top English ace of the time, Captain Albert Ball, as well as a SPAD S.VII from No. 19 Squadron, and a Sopwith Triplane of No 8 (Naval) Squadron. In a running battle in deteriorating visibility in the middle of a thunderstorm over Bourlon Wood, both sides became scattered. Richthofen engaged in single combat with the British Triplane. At about the same time, Ball was seen by fellow 56 Squadron pilot Cyril Crowe chasing a red Albatros into a thundercloud. Ball lost control of his plane and crashed fatally. Though forced to land his damaged aircraft, Richthofen escaped injury. The British Sopwith Triplane involved in the action returned to base undamaged.

Richthofen posted a claim for shooting down the Sopwith Triplane. However, the propaganda value of Ball&#x27;s death under the guns of a German pilot was obvious, and the German High Command awarded a victory over Ball to Lothar. The fallacy of the award was readily apparent. The idea that an experienced pilot such as Richthofen would confuse a triplane with a biplane was ludicrous. &quot;Leutnant&quot; Hailer, a German pilot on the ground who witnessed the crash and was the first German at the crash scene saw no battle damage to Ball&#x27;s plane. The doctor who autopsied Ball reported massive injuries to Ball from the crash, but no bullet wounds. Nevertheless, the official line was that Lothar von Richthofen shot down Albert Ball. Later research suggests that Ball became disoriented by vertigo, accidentally entering an inverted dive which choked his plane&#x27;s carburetor and stopped the engine, causing him to crash.

== Pour le Mérite ==
Richthofen raised his total to 24 by 13 May, when, after shooting down a BE.2, he was wounded in the hip by anti-aircraft fire and crash-landed; his injuries kept him out of combat for five months. On 14 May he was awarded the Pour le Mérite, and he resumed command of Jasta 11 in September 1917. In early 1918 he suffered a severe ear infection and was hospitalised in Berlin.

Returning to his unit in February, he claimed 3 Bristol Fighter F2.Bs on 11 and 12 March, before he was again forced down on 13 March by a Sopwith Camel flown by Captain Augustus Orlebar of No. 73 Squadron. Nursing his crippled Fokker Dr1 Triplane into a landing, Richthofen clipped a high-tension wire and crashed heavily, suffering serious head injuries. He was still recovering when he learned of his brother&#x27;s death.

Lothar returned to service with Jasta 11 in July 1918. He scored his final victory (a DH-9a) on 12 August 1918, flying a Fokker D.VII. The next day he was again wounded in action against Sopwith Camels, probably by Captain Field E. Kindley of the 148th Aero Squadron USAS. Lothar may also have been forced down by Canadian RAF pilot William Stephenson, later known as the World War II spymaster code-named &quot;Intrepid&quot;. Lothar was promoted to Oberleutnant, and saw no further combat before the war ended in November.

Considering the amount of time Lothar von Richthofen spent on the front and in hospitals, he was one of the most combat efficient and prolific flying aces of the war, perhaps even more so than his brother Manfred. Of his total of 40 confirmed victories, Lothar scored 33 in just three months: 15 in April 1917, 8 in May 1917, and 10 in August 1918.

== Post war ==
With the return of peace, Lothar von Richthofen worked briefly on a farm before accepting an industrial position. He married Countess Doris von Keyserlingk in Cammerau in June 1919, fathering a daughter, Carmen Viola (1920–1971), and a son, Wolf-Manfred (1922–2010), before the marriage was dissolved. He then became a commercial pilot, carrying passengers and mail between Berlin and Hamburg.

== Death ==
On 4 July, 1922 Richthofen died in a crash of his LVG C VI at Hamburg due to an engine failure. Also on board were actress Fern Andra and her director Georg Bluen. Both Bluen and Andra survived, Andra spending a year recovering from her injuries.

Lothar von Richthofen was interred next to his father at the Garrison Cemetery in Schweidnitz, but the cemetery was levelled by the Poles when the city was transferred to Poland after World War II. Today the area is a football field, although von Richthofen&#x27;s headstone still exists.

A plaque to Lothar&#x27;s memory is next to his brother Manfred von Richthofen&#x27;s grave on the Südfriedhof in Wiesbaden.

<text>Latimer Road () is a London Underground station in North Kensington, in the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea. It is on the Circle and Hammersmith &amp; City lines, between Wood Lane and Ladbroke Grove stations. It is in Travelcard Zone 2.

==Location==
Unusually, Latimer Road and the station that bears its name are not geographically close, being approximately 500 metres apart and on opposite sides of the Westway Flyover (A40 road) – the road being to the north and the station to the south. Prior to the construction of the Westway and the elevated roundabout that joins it to the West Cross Route (A3220), Latimer Road ran further south and closer to the station. The construction of the elevated road required the demolition of the central section of Latimer Road and the truncated and isolated southern end of the road was renamed as part of Freston Road. Despite the renaming of the southern part of the road, the station retained its original name. The road was named after Edward Latymer, who bequeathed the land to build the road in order to help fund the school in Hammersmith that he founded, Latymer Upper School. Freston is the name of the ancestral village in Suffolk of the Latymer family.

==History==

The station opened on 16 December 1868 at a junction formed between two existing railway lines – the Hammersmith &amp; City Railway (owned by the Great Western Railway and running between Westbourne Park and Hammersmith stations) and the West London Railway (WLR) (between Willesden Junction and Addison Road (now Kensington (Olympia)) stations). Services to Addison Road were originally provided via the junction to the WLR tracks but these were discontinued in 1940 and the junction no longer exists. The line between Latimer Road and Uxbridge Road was then closed and the raised train track demolished. The remains of that stretch of track can be seen from the west end of the eastbound platform, which now houses a secure Relay Room.

In July 2010, the westbound platform 2 was closed to begin refurbishment and extension work, in preparation for the new S Stock, to be introduced on the Circle and Hammersmith &amp; City lines from 2012, which consists of 7 cars instead of the current 6-car configuration. Volker Rail has been contracted by TfL to demolish and rebuild both the east- and westbound platforms, starting with the westbound platform and then moving over to the eastbound. Reportedly it had been paid 7 million pounds to carry out the work laid out in the original plans. However the plans changed due to the poor conditions of the arches underneath the platforms, the poor condition of the lattice girders on the bridge over Bramley Road, and subsidence at ground level in the ticket hall.

The station closed completely on Monday 17 January 2011 for 14 weeks. The westbound platform re-opened first, and the eastbound platform&#x27;s re-opening on Monday 1 August 2011 heralded the station&#x27;s full return to service. A new station entrance is to be built next to the disused kiosk after underpinning work has been carried out to the station&#x27;s green painted wall facing Bramley Road.

From 5 October 2014 to 3 November the same year, eastbound trains did not stop at the station to allow for refurbishment work on the staircase between the ticket hall and the eastbound platform.

==The station today==
===Design===
The station ticket hall at Latimer Road is located at ground level within the arches of the viaduct carrying the tracks above. The platforms are accessed by stairs and retain much of their original character with simple open timber canopies.

===Station facilities===

The station has a ticket hall and 2 passenger-operated machines (or POMs). The larger POM, called a Multi Fare Machine (MFM) accepts UK Sterling notes, up to £20 and gives change of 10p, 50p, £1 and £2 coins. The smaller machine, known as an Advance Fare Machine (AFM), does not give change and accepts overpayment up to 30p. Both machines accept most major credit and debit cards; however, to help combat fraud, individual cards can only be used once a day. These machines are the standard London Underground installation at all LU operated stations.

The station also has Electric Service Update Boards or ESUBS. These large screens advertise service information which is updated from the Network Operations Centre, located at London Underground&#x27;s head office above St James&#x27;s Park tube station.

There are 5 Customer Help Points on the station, 1 in the ticket hall at ground level and 2 on each platform. These communication devices are connected to the Station Control Room at Ladbroke Grove station. They are mostly used by customers to find out where or when their next train is due, but can be used to contact staff or the police in an emergency. There are also 3 payphones at the station and waiting room on the platforms.

The station kiosk has been closed for many years. It is now used by London Underground as a storage area.

===Proximity to Grenfell Tower===
Grenfell Tower, which was destroyed in a fire on 14 June 2017, killing 72 people, stands behind the station, and there is a clear view of the tower from the Paddington-bound platform. Automated announcements asking passengers waiting for trains not to take photos of the fire-damaged building are made by Transport for London, mainly as a mark of respect to those who died or were otherwise affected by the disaster, but also so that any flashes from smartphones or cameras do not distract train drivers looking at signals &quot;en route&quot;. The UK government has requested that the station be renamed as a tribute to Grenfell Tower, a process that will need to be explored by Transport for London.

==Connections==
London Bus routes 295 and 316 serve the station.

<text>William James Skardon (1904–1987) was a Special Branch officer who joined MI5 in 1940 and became an interrogator and head of &quot;The Watchers&quot; (physical surveillance teams). He was intimately involved with the investigation of the Cambridge Five and the interrogation of Klaus Fuchs.

After rapidly and non-coercively eliciting a confession from Fuchs, Skardon acquired a reputation as a very skilful interrogator. However his own report of the Fuchs interrogation indicates that Fuchs – apparently in a condition of considerable mental stress – volunteered his entire confession with very little prompting. Peter Wright also claimed that the success of that interrogation depended mainly on the detailed brief supplied to Skardon, plus the &quot;listeners&quot; who picked Fuchs&#x27;s lies to pieces. Skardon&#x27;s subsequent record in interrogations was considerably less successful, and his success with Fuchs led to these negative results being given too much credence. Some of Skardon&#x27;s subsequent failures include:
* Kim Philby – interrogated ten times without result (although Skardon was apparently never given a free hand).
* Anthony Blunt – interviewed and cleared 11 times between 1951 and 1964. Finally confessed in 1964 when confronted with incontrovertible evidence.
* John Cairncross – interviewed and cleared in 1952, despite strong circumstantial evidence being found in Burgess&#x27; flat. Left the country very soon after the interrogation but returned in 1967 and confessed when confronted with Blunt&#x27;s confession.
* Jim Hill – liaison officer in the Australian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, access was restricted to classified information in 1949 on the basis of Venona project material, interrogated three times by Skardon in 1959, cleared and access restored. Almost certainly an NKVD agent.

<doc id="923698" wikidata="Q2399786" url="?curid=923698" title="Ted Hawkins">
<text>Ted Hawkins (October 28, 1936 – January 1, 1995) was an American singer-songwriter born in Biloxi, Mississippi. He split his time between his adopted hometown of Venice Beach, California, where he was a mostly anonymous street performer, and Europe and Australia, where he and his songs were better known and well received in clubs and small concert halls.

==Life and career==
Hawkins was born in Biloxi, Mississippi. His mother was a prostitute and he never knew the identity of his father. He was sent to a reform school when he was 12 years old. As a teenager Hawkins drifted, hitchhiked, and stole his way across the country for the next dozen years, earning several stays in prison, including a three-year stint for stealing a leather jacket as a teenager. Along the way, he picked up a love of music and a talent for the guitar. &quot;I was sent to a school for bad boys called Oakley Training School in 1949,&quot; he wrote in a brief piece of autobiography. &quot;There I developed my voice by singing with a group that the superintendent&#x27;s wife had got together.&quot; After reform school, he ended up in the state penitentiary and was released at 19. &quot;Then I heard a singer whose name was Sam Cooke. His voice did something to me.&quot;
For the next ten years or so he drifted in and out of trouble around the country, living in Chicago, Buffalo, Philadelphia, and Newark. In the middle of the mid-1960s folk music boom Hawkins set out for California to try for a professional singing career. He recorded several tunes without commercial success, worked at odd jobs, and took up busking along the piers and storefronts of Venice Beach as a way to supplement his income. Hawkins made ends meet by developing a small following of locals and tourists who would come to hear this Southern black man, sitting on an overturned milk crate, play blues and folk standards and a few original songs in his signature open guitar tuning and raspy vocal style. Hawkins claimed the rasp in his voice came from the damage done by years of singing in the sand and spray of the boardwalk.

A series of record producers and promoters &quot;discovered&quot; Hawkins over the years, only to be thwarted by circumstance and Hawkins&#x27;s unconventional life. The first was the musicologist and blues producer Bruce Bromberg, who approached Hawkins about a recording contract in the early 1970s. Hawkins tentatively agreed and recorded some dozen songs for Bromberg, but Hawkins faced legal trouble and spent much of the next decade in prison and addicted to heroin. Bromberg lost contact with Hawkins until 1982, when was able to get him to agree to release the previously recorded songs as an album, &quot;Watch Your Step&quot;, which was released by Rounder Records in 1982. This debut album was a commercial failure but received rave reviews (notably a rare five-star rating in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;).

In December 1984, Hawkins was released from the California State Medical Facility at Vacaville, after serving 18 months of a three-year sentence on a child molestation charge (due to indecent exposure in the midst of suffering nervous breakdowns). Hawkins reunited with Bromberg in 1985 for a second album, &quot;Happy Hour&quot;. This album featured more original songs by Hawkins and was again ignored in the U.S.; however, it won acclaim and sales in Europe. English radio DJ Andy Kershaw encouraged Hawkins to come to the United Kingdom, and he moved to the resort town of Bridlington in 1986 and enjoyed his first taste of commercial musical success, touring Europe and Asia. However, after four years in England, in 1990 he was deported back to the United States by the British Government, ostensibly on drug-related charges, although Hawkins later dismissed this by saying the reason was simply &quot;I was having visa problems...they deported me. My time ran out. England is a good place. It’s just that I had a lot of bills back home and I hadn’t seen my family. I had to get back home.&quot;

During this period Hawkins refined his musical style, a mixture of folk music, country music, Deep South spirituals, and soul music. His style was informed by but did not resemble traditional blues music (Hawkins claimed he could not play the blues because with his damaged fretting hand—he wore a leather glove to protect his fingers—he was unable to bend notes).

In 1987, the documentary filmmaker Nick Shaw approached Hawkins about producing a profile of his life and times, for which he followed Hawkins closely for the next two years. The documentary was eventually taken up by the Arts Council of Great Britain, but it has never been formally released. Some of the footage was included in the film &quot;Amazing Grace&quot;, produced by David Geffen.

Despite the recognition and fame he received in Europe, Hawkins was restless and moved back to California in the early 1990s and again took on the role of a street performer. Several musicians and promoters encouraged Hawkins to record, but he did so only on occasion and without much enthusiasm, until he agreed to record a full album for Geffen Records and producer Tony Berg. For this first major-label release, &quot;The Next Hundred Years&quot;, Berg added session musicians to Hawkins&#x27;s typical solo guitar-and-vocal arrangements for the first time, and brought national attention and respectable sales to Hawkins (though Hawkins, in typically contrary fashion, claimed to dislike the result, preferring his unaccompanied versions). Hawkins began to tour on the basis of this success, commenting that he had finally reached an age where he was glad to be able to sing indoors, out of the weather, and for an appreciative crowd. He died of a stroke at the age of 58, just a few months after the release of his breakthrough recording.

His widow, Elizabeth Hawkins, sold the rights for a film version of Hawkins&#x27;s life story.

Hawkins is the subject of Mick Thomas&#x27;s song &quot;57 Years&quot;. In the novel &quot;The Island&quot; (2010), by R J Price (better known as the poet Richard Price), the fictional Graham and Linda are brought together at a concert by Hawkins in Glasgow, Scotland.

&quot;Cold and Bitter Tears: The Songs of Ted Hawkins&quot; was released in late 2015 by Eight 30 Records, based in Austin, Texas. The album was produced by Kevin Russell, Jenni Finlay and Brian T. Atkinson and features James McMurtry (&quot;Big Things&quot;), Kasey Chambers (&quot;Cold and Bitter Tears&quot;), Mary Gauthier (&quot;Sorry You&#x27;re Sick&quot;), Shinyribs (&quot;Who Got My Natural Comb&quot;) and several others singing songs by Hawkins.

In 2014, in cooperation with his family, the Killer Blues Headstone Project placed a headstone for Ted Hawkins at Ingelwood Park Cemetery in Inglewood, California.

==Discography==
Hawkins also appears on the Geffen Records 1996 compilation &quot;Just Say Noël&quot;.

<text>Soldier is the fourth studio album by American rock singer Iggy Pop. It was released in February 1980 by record label Arista.

== Recording ==

For the album Iggy collaborated with ex-Sex Pistols bassist Glen Matlock.

Ex-member of The Stooges James Williamson was originally hired to produce the album, but a conflict between Williamson and David Bowie (who was assisting as a friend of Pop) over recording techniques led to Williamson walking out on the project.

Bowie and Simple Minds provide backing vocals on &quot;Play It Safe&quot;.

There has been some debate over the lack of lead guitar on the final mix, which has been criticized by Glen Matlock. In Pop&#x27;s biography, Matlock claims that the lead guitar was stripped after Bowie was punched by Steve New for hitting on his girlfriend of that time, Patti Palladin.

== Release ==

&quot;Soldier&quot; was released in February 1980 by record label Arista. The album peaked at number 125 on the Billboard charts. Videos were made for the songs &quot;Loco Mosquito&quot;, &quot;Knocking &#x27;Em Down (In the City)&quot; and &quot;Dog Food&quot;.

== Critical reception ==

&quot;Soldier&quot; has received a mixed-to-favorable reception from critics.

In her retrospective review, Charlotte Robinson of &quot;PopMatters&quot; wrote &quot;Instead of a punk masterpiece, [...] &quot;Soldier&quot; turned out to be an uneven and sometimes plain silly recording.&quot;

&quot;Rolling Stone&quot;&#x27;s David Fricke reviewed the album positively, calling attention to Iggy Pop&#x27;s successful weathering of his own self-destructive persona. Of the album, Fricke wrote: &quot;Soldier, like all of his albums, is a hard-fought battle in a war that Iggy Pop is determined to win. Call him Ig noble.&quot;

<text>Sainte-Foy-lès-Lyon (, literally &quot;Sainte-Foy near Lyon&quot;) is a commune in the Metropolis of Lyon in Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes region in eastern France.

== Geography ==
It is a suburb of the city of Lyon, located to the west of the city.

It is located only from the center of Lyon, but is a community in its own right. The town grew as a haven from the industry of Lyon, as it is set high above the city, and there are some panoramas of Lyon and the surrounding area, notably from a park known as the &#x27;Esplanade de Lichfield&#x27;.

Lyon is said to be the city of three rivers – the Rhône and Saône rivers which converge there – and the Beaujolais wine. Sainte Foy&#x27;s finest historic asset is remains of a Roman aqueduct and there is a fine seminary, steep narrow walled streets, parks and gardens, and squares in the town center.

==Population==

<text>The Charles Connell House is the present name of the residence of the Hon. Charles Connell (1810–1873). It is located at 128 Connell Street, Woodstock, New Brunswick. The house was designated a National Historic Site in 1975.

== History ==
This house was built by an unknown person circa 1839 for Connell. It represents the peak of classicism in local architecture. It was built in the Greek Revival style, where wood is used to imitate the look of stone.

=== Past use ===

In the late 19th and early 20th century, it was divided into apartments. It was made into a double tenement in the 1890s, and further subdivided into three apartments circa 1920, with a fourth created about 1960.

=== Current use ===
The house was purchased by the Carleton County Historical Society in 1975, and is currently used to house the society&#x27;s archives, artifacts and office. A restoration of the layout of the house, before it was broken up into apartments, was completed in 2008.

The Connell House is also available for business meetings, weddings, receptions, and parties for a small fee. The Connell House is fully licensed and has a fully stocked caterer&#x27;s kitchen.

<doc id="923708" wikidata="Q568372" url="?curid=923708" title="Edmond Noel">
<text>Edmund Favor Noel (March 4, 1856 – July 30, 1927) was an American attorney and politician who served as governor of Mississippi from 1908 to 1912. The son of an early planter family in Mississippi, he became a member of the Democratic Party.

Noel was elected to the state house, as a district attorney, and to the state senate before winning an election as governor in 1907. As governor, he achieved gains in support for farmers, labor legislation, and public education, while also establishing a state charity hospital. After his tenure, he was re-elected to the state senate.

==Early life, family and education==
Edmund Favor Noel was born on March 4, 1856, on his family&#x27;s farm in Holmes County, Mississippi. Edmund was named after his paternal grandfather, Edmund Faver Noel.

During the American Civil War, Noel&#x27;s father served in the Confederate States Army and was eventually imprisoned. After the war, Noel moved to Louisville, Kentucky, to live with his maternal uncle, attorney David Sanders. After finishing high school, Noel read law under Sanders before returning to Mississippi in 1877. He passed the state bar and opened law practice in Lexington.

==Political career==
In 1881, Noel was elected to a seat in the Mississippi House of Representatives. In 1887, he was elected as a district attorney.

In 1890 the Democratic-dominated legislature passed a new constitution with provisions that disenfranchised most African Americans by raising barriers to voter registration. White Democrats maintained this exclusion of blacks from politics through much of the 1960s in the state. These actions crippled the Republican Party in the state, whose members had been primarily made up of newly enfranchised African-American freedmen after the Civil War.

In 1895 Noel was elected to the Mississippi State Senate. He served in the U.S. Army in the Spanish–American War (1898). He was re-elected to the state senate in 1899. By the turn of the 20th century, Mississippi was a &quot;de facto&quot; one-party state under the firm control of the Democratic Party. With no meaningful opposition in general elections from the Republican Party, who held public office was effectively determined by who was nominated by the Democratic Party. Such nominations were decided in party conventions, which tended to be dominated by wealthy planters, bankers, and traders. Upon joining the State Senate, Noel began advocating for a law requiring party&#x27;s to employ primary elections to select their candidates, as such a reform would ensure more popular participation in the political process. He also later stated that he feared public discontent with the convention system would destabilize white supremacy in Mississippi&#x27;s political system.

In 1899, Andrew H. Longino was elected governor of Mississippi. He advocated for the adoption of a primary law in 1900, and while a bill to that effect passed the Senate, it did not succeed in the House. At the beginning of the 1902 legislative session, Noel introduced a bill which required all party nominations to be determined by primary elections, and called for a run-off contest to be held in the instance of no contender garnering a majority of the votes on the first ballot. The bill was successful and signed into law in March. The law also allowed a party&#x27;s leadership to determine who was eligible to vote in their primaries, and in 1903, the Mississippi Democratic Party&#x27;s Executive Committee voted to restrict eligibility to include only white voters. Accordingly, the law led to the exclusion of blacks from meaningful input in Mississippi&#x27;s politics while also driving future candidates to appeal more to regular white voters.

In 1903, Noel retired from the State Senate and launched a campaign for the office of governor. In the Democratic primary he faced F. A. Critz, a Civil War veteran, and James K. Vardaman, a newspaper editor. Vardaman and Critz advanced to the primary run-off, which the former won.

In 1907, Noel won the Democratic primary and was elected Governor of Mississippi. He achieved numerous progressive reforms, including in education. These reforms included consolidation of the state&#x27;s rural school districts, the establishment of agricultural high schools for whites, and the founding of a teacher&#x27;s college in Hattiesburg (restricted to white students). Noel&#x27;s administration also gained passage of laws regulating child labor, establishing statewide prohibition of alcohol, founding of a state charity hospital, and establishing pure food laws.

The business community in Jackson had recommended that both the 66-year-old Governor&#x27;s Mansion and the Old Capitol be demolished and the sites redeveloped for commercial use. Noel and his wife Alice worked together to promote the preservation and renovation of the mansion. Through their efforts, it received its first major renovation and was updated for continued use.

After the end of his term, Noel continued to be active in state politics. In 1918, he was unsuccessful in his run for the United States Senate, which was newly based on popular voting. Since the adoption of the 17th Amendment in 1913, U.S. senators were elected for the first time that year by popular vote rather than by state legislatures. Noel ranked third; both he and the incumbent, populist U.S. Senator James K. Vardaman, lost to Pat Harrison. Blacks were still effectively disenfranchised and excluded from voting.

In 1920, Noel was elected again to the Mississippi State Senate, serving until he died in 1927.

==Personal life and death==
Noel married Loula Hoskins in 1890. They had children together, including sons, before her death.

He married again in 1905 to Alice Josephine Tye Neilson, who had two sons from a previous marriage. She served as First Lady when Noel was governor. She aided him in working to preserve and renovate the Governor&#x27;s Mansion.

After his death in July 1927, Noel was buried at Odd Fellows Cemetery in Lexington, Mississippi. His wife, Alice Noel, was buried there after her death in 1933.

<doc id="923713" wikidata="Q1931347" url="?curid=923713" title="Party (Iggy Pop album)">
<text>Party is the fifth solo studio album by American rock singer Iggy Pop. It was released in June 1981 by record label Arista. For this record, Pop collaborated with Ivan Kral, who is best known as the guitar and bass player for Patti Smith in the 1970s.

== Recording ==

When Arista heard the album, they brought in former Monkees producer Tommy Boyce to remix &quot;Bang Bang&quot;. According to Iggy Pop&#x27;s autobiography &quot;I Need More&quot;, he wrote &quot;Bang Bang&quot; because Arista Records wanted a single and he promised them a commercial album. He originally wanted Phil Spector or Mike Chapman to produce the song. Iggy claimed he got the idea for the song from reading &quot;The Right Stuff&quot; at a local bookstore. &quot;Eggs On Plate&quot; was originally known as &quot;Don&#x27;t Put the Brakes On Tonight&quot; and was originally written for Mick Ronson.

== Release ==

&quot;Party&quot; was released in June 1981. The album peaked at number 166 in the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top 200. &quot;Bang Bang was released as a single the same month, charting at number 35 on the Billboard Club Play Singles Chart.

&quot;Party&quot; is the last of Pop&#x27;s three albums with Arista Records, following &quot;New Values&quot; and &quot;Soldier&quot;. Buddha reissued the album in 2000 with two bonus tracks: &quot;Speak to Me&quot; and a cool jazz rendition of the standard &quot;One for My Baby (and One More for the Road)&quot;.

== Critical reception ==
&quot;Party&quot; has been poorly received by critics.

Charlotte Robinson of &quot;PopMatters&quot; called it &quot;a bizarre train wreck of an album&quot;. Mark Deming of AllMusic wrote: &quot;Part of Iggy Pop&#x27;s unique sort of integrity is that the man doesn&#x27;t seem to know how to sell out, even when he tries, and &quot;Party&quot;, one of the strangest albums of his career, is living proof.&quot;

== Tour ==

The &quot;Party&quot; tour was documented on the &quot;Live in San Fran 1981&quot; CD (released in 1983) and DVD (released in 2005). This performance was filmed on November 25, 1981 at the Warfield Theatre on Market Street in San Francisco.

<text>Antiaromaticity is a chemical property of a cyclic molecule with a π electron system that has higher energy, i.e., it is less stable due to the presence of 4n delocalised (π or lone pair) electrons in it, as opposed to aromaticity. Unlike aromatic compounds, which follow Hückel&#x27;s rule ([4&quot;n&quot;+2] π electrons) and are highly stable, antiaromatic compounds are highly unstable and highly reactive. To avoid the instability of antiaromaticity, molecules may change shape, becoming non-planar and therefore breaking some of the π interactions. In contrast to the diamagnetic ring current present in aromatic compounds, antiaromatic compounds have a paramagnetic ring current, which can be observed by NMR spectroscopy.

 Examples of antiaromatic compounds are pentalene (A), biphenylene (B), cyclopentadienyl cation (C). The prototypical example of antiaromaticity, cyclobutadiene, is the subject of debate, with some scientists arguing that antiaromaticity is not a major factor contributing to its destabilization.
Cyclooctatetraene is an example of a molecule adopting a non-planar geometry to avoid the destabilization that results from antiaromaticity. If it were planar, it would have a single eight-electron π system around the ring, but it instead adopts a boat-like shape with four individual π bonds. Because antiaromatic compounds are often short-lived and difficult to work with experimentally, antiaromatic destabilization energy is often modeled by simulation rather than by experimentation.

==Definition==
The term &#x27;antiaromaticity&#x27; was first proposed by Ronald Breslow in 1967 as &quot;a situation in which a cyclic delocalisation of electrons is destabilising&quot;. The IUPAC criteria for antiaromaticity are as follows:

#The molecule must be cyclic.
#The molecule must be planar.
#The molecule must have a complete conjugated π-electron system within the ring.
#The molecule must have 4&quot;n&quot; π-electrons where &quot;n&quot; is any integer within the conjugated π-system.

This differs from aromaticity only in the fourth criterion: aromatic molecules have 4&quot;n&quot; +2 π-electrons in the conjugated π system and therefore follow Hückel’s rule. Non-aromatic molecules are either noncyclic, nonplanar, or do not have a complete conjugated π system within the ring.

Having a planar ring system is essential for maximizing the overlap between the &quot;p&quot; orbitals which make up the conjugated π system. This explains why being a planar, cyclic molecule is a key characteristic of both aromatic and antiaromatic molecules. However, in reality, it is difficult to determine whether or not a molecule is completely conjugated simply by looking at its structure: sometimes molecules can distort in order to relieve strain and this distortion has the potential to disrupt the conjugation. Thus, additional efforts must be taken in order to determine whether or not a certain molecule is genuinely antiaromatic.

An antiaromatic compound may demonstrate its antiaromaticity both kinetically and thermodynamically. As will be discussed later, antiaromatic compounds experience exceptionally high chemical reactivity. Being highly reactive is not &quot;indicative&quot; of an antiaromatic compound, but merely suggests that the compound could be antiaromatic. An antiaromatic compound may also be recognized thermodynamically by measuring the energy of the cyclic conjugated π electron system. In an antiaromatic compound, the amount of conjugation energy in the molecule will be significantly higher than in an appropriate reference compound.

In reality, it is recommended that one analyze the structure of a potentially antiaromatic compound extensively before declaring that it is indeed antiaromatic. If an experimentally determined structure of the molecule in question does not exist, a computational analysis must be performed. The potential energy of the molecule should be probed for various geometries in order to assess any distortion from a symmetric planar conformation. 
This procedure is recommended because there have been multiple instances in the past where molecules which appear to be antiaromatic on paper turn out to be not truly so in actuality. The most famous (and heavily debated) of these molecules is cyclobutadiene, as is discussed later.

Examples of antiaromatic compounds are pentalene (A), biphenylene (B), cyclopentadienyl cation (C). The prototypical example of antiaromaticity, cyclobutadiene, is the subject of debate, with some scientists arguing that antiaromaticity is not a major factor contributing to its destabilization. Cyclooctatetraene appears at first glance to be antiaromatic, but is an excellent example of a molecule adopting a non-planar geometry to avoid the destabilization that results from antiaromaticity. Because antiaromatic compounds are often short-lived and difficult to work with experimentally, antiaromatic destabilization energy is often modeled by simulation rather than by experimentation.

==NMR spectroscopy==
The paramagnetic ring current resulting from the electron delocalization in antiaromatic compounds can be observed by NMR. This ring current leads to a deshielding (downfield shift) of nuclei inside the ring and a shielding (upfield shift) of nuclei outside the ring. [12]annulene is an antiaromatic hydrocarbon that is large enough to have protons both inside and outside of the ring. The chemical shift for the protons outside its ring is 5.91 ppm and that for the protons inside the ring is 7.86 ppm, compared to the normal range of 4.5-6.5 ppm for nonaromatic alkenes. This effect is of a smaller magnitude than the corresponding shifts in aromatic compounds.

Many aromatic and antiaromatic compounds (benzene and cyclobutadiene) are too small to have protons inside of the ring, where shielding and deshielding effects can be more diagnostically useful in determining if a compound is aromatic, antiaromatic, or nonaromatic. Nucleus Independent Chemical Shift (NICS) analysis is a method of computing the ring shielding (or deshielding) at the center of a ring system to predict aromaticity or antiaromaticity. A negative NICS value is indicative of aromaticity and a positive value is indicative of antiaromaticity.

==Examples==
While there are multitudes of molecules in existence which would appear to be antiaromatic on paper, the number of molecules that are antiaromatic in actuality is considerably less. This is compounded by the fact that one cannot typically make derivatives of antiaromatic molecules by adding more antiaromatic hydrocarbon rings, etc. because the molecule typically loses either its planar nature or its conjugated system of π-electrons and becomes nonaromatic. In this section, only examples of antiaromatic compounds which are non-disputable are included.

Pentalene is an antiaromatic compound which has been well-studied both experimentally and computationally for decades. It is dicyclic, planar and has eight π-electrons, fulfilling the IUPAC definition of antiaromaticity. Pentalene’s dianionic and dicationic states are aromatic, as they follow Hückel’s 4&quot;n&quot; +2 π-electron rule.&lt;ref name=&quot;10.1002/poc.1907&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hexadehydro-[12]annulene===
Like its relative [12]annulene, hexadehydro-[12]annulene is also antiaromatic. Its structure has been studied computationally via ab initio and density functional theory calculations and is confirmed to be antiaromatic.

===Cyclobutadiene===

Cyclobutadiene is a classic textbook example of an antiaromatic compound. It is conventionally understood to be planar, cyclic, and have 4 π electrons (4&quot;n&quot; for &quot;n&quot;=1) in a conjugated system.

However, it has long been questioned if cyclobutadiene is genuinely antiaromatic and recent discoveries have suggested that it may not be. Cyclobutadiene is particularly destabilized and this was originally attributed to antiaromaticity. However, cyclobutadiene adopts more double bond character in two of its parallel bonds than others and the π electrons are not delocalized between the two double-bond-like bonds, giving it a rectangular shape as opposed to a regular square. As such, cyclobutadiene behaves like two discrete alkenes joined by two single bonds, and is therefore non-aromatic rather than antiaromatic.

Despite the lack of this π-antiaromatic destabilization effect, none of its 4&quot;n&quot; π-electron relatives (cyclooctatetraene, etc.) had even close to as much destabilization, suggesting there was something more going on in the case of cyclobutadiene. It was found that a combination of angle strain, torsional strain, and Pauli repulsion leads to the extreme destabilization experienced in this molecule.

This discovery is awkward in that it contradicts basic teachings of antiaromaticity. At this point of time, it is presumed that cyclobutadiene will continue to be used to introduce the concept of antiaromaticity in textbooks as a matter of convenience, even though classifying it as antiaromatic technically may not be accurate.

===Cyclopentadienyl cation===
The cyclopentadienyl cation is another textbook example of an antiaromatic compound. It is conventionally understood to be planar, cyclic, and have 4 π electrons (4&quot;n&quot; for &quot;n&quot;=1) in a conjugated system.

However, it has long been questioned if the cyclopentadienyl cation is genuinely antiaromatic and recent discoveries have suggested that it may not be. The lowest-energy singlet state is antiaromatic, but the lowest-energy triplet state is aromatic due to Baird&#x27;s rule, and research in 2007 showed the triplet state to be the ground state.

===Cyclooctatetraene===
Cyclooctatetraene is another example of a molecule which is not antiaromatic, even though it might initially appear to be so. Cyclooctatetraene assumes a tub (i.e., boat-like) conformation. As it is not planar, even though it has 4&quot;n&quot; π-electrons, these electrons are not delocalized and conjugated. The molecule is therefore non-aromatic.

==Effects on reactivity==
Antiaromatic compounds, often being very unstable, can be highly reactive in order to relieve the antiaromatic destabilization. Cyclobutadiene, for example, rapidly dimerizes with no potential energy barrier via a 2 + 2 cycloaddition reaction to form tricyclooctadiene. While the antiaromatic character of cyclobutadiene is the subject of debate, the relief of antiaromaticity is usually invoked as the driving force of this reaction.

Antiaromaticity can also have a significant effect on p&quot;K&quot;a. The linear compound propene has a p&quot;K&quot;a of 44, which is relatively acidic for an sp3 carbon center because the resultant allyl anion can be resonance stabilized. The analogous cyclic system appears to have even more resonance stabilized, as the negative charge can be delocalized across three carbons instead of two. However, the cyclopropenyl anion has 4 π electrons in a cyclic system and in fact has a substantially &quot;higher&quot; p&quot;K&quot;a than 1-propene because it is antiaromatic and thus destabilized. Because antiaromatic compounds are often short-lived and difficult to work with experimentally, antiaromatic destabilization energy is often modeled by simulation rather than by experimentation.

Some antiaromatic compounds are stable, especially larger cyclic systems (in which the antiaromatic destabilization is not as substantial). For example, the aromatic species 1 can be reduced to 2 with a relatively small penalty for forming an antiaromatic system. The antiaromatic 2 does revert to the aromatic species 1 over time by reacting with oxygen in the air because the aromaticity is preferred.

The loss of antiaromaticity can sometimes be the driving force of a reaction. In the following keto-enol tautomerization, the product enol is more stable than the original ketone even though the ketone contains an aromatic benzene moiety (blue). However, there is also an antiaromatic lactone moiety (green). The relief of antiaromatic destabilization provides a driving force that outweighs even the loss of an aromatic benzene.

<text>″Tis is a memoir written by Frank McCourt of his time learning how to live in New York City. Published in 1999, it begins where McCourt ended &quot;Angela&#x27;s Ashes&quot;, his Pulitzer Prize winning memoir of his impoverished childhood in Ireland and his return to America.

==Synopsis==

The book begins as McCourt lands upriver from New York City, and quickly makes his way to New York City with an Irish-American priest on the ship. Friendless and clueless about American customs, he struggles to integrate himself into American blue-collar society, working at laboring jobs while spending his free time reading books. The New York City public library is a wonder to him, with its welcoming ways. He spends time there and checks out books from the start.

He is drafted into the US Army because of the Korean War; he is sent to Europe, and rises to the rank of corporal. During his time in southern Germany, he meets men from all over the U.S. When serving as company clerk, he delivers laundry to U.S. Army facilities at Dachau, a haunting experience, both for a Jewish soldier with him and for Frank, who heard all the news of World War II growing up in Limerick. Soldiers are always looking for women, trading their cigarette and coffee allotments for sex, even with refugees from WWII who are still not settled, which the Army disapproves of. Frank has a troubling encounter with a poor and hungry girl in a refugee camp. The people in the Army teach him a lot about American ways, so different from his upbringing in the lanes of Limerick. While in the Army in Germany, he gets two weeks leave to visit his family in Ireland, seeing his mother and youngest brothers Michael and Alphie in Limerick, and for one day, his father and paternal grandmother in Toome. He has been sending part of his Army wages to his mother, and she has gained a home with all the modern advantages of plumbing, a refrigerator and space for a garden in the Janesboro neighborhood; she does not move out of the slum house shared with her brother, where she was raised, until Frank arrives. His emotions while in Limerick are strongly mixed, between pride in his U.S. Army status, pleasure at the better life of his youngest brother who attends secondary school, and the hard memories of his own life there, the &quot;dark clouds&quot; in his mind. 

Because he has a girlfriend, Emma, in New York City, he leaves the army at his earliest opportunity, being commended for his exceptional service as a clerk-typist by his superior officers. 

He returns to New York City, where he breaks up with Emma, preferring to be single in New York, going out drinking with his pals. He attends New York University – despite never having graduated from high school. The G.I. Bill pays for university tuition, but he needs to work to pay for food and lodging. He takes jobs at warehouses at the docks, and then office jobs from a temporary job service, using his typing skills gained in the Army, continuing to meet many friends and interesting characters. He has some friends who are recent immigrants from Ireland as well as many friends born in the U.S. He falls in love with beautiful, middle-class American-born Alberta Small (nicknamed Mike), whom he meets at university.

While never forgetting the songs of Ireland, he picks up a taste for American jazz music of the 1950s.

His brother Malachy is in New York; he opts to serve in the U.S. Air Force. Malachy and then younger brother Michael send part of their Air Force wages to their mother, so Frank has only himself to support while he finishes his courses at NYU. 

After graduating from NYU, he teaches English and social studies at McKee Vocational and Technical High School on Staten Island. He continues to drink with fellow teachers. After eight years there and some time as a substitute at a few colleges and high schools, he moves on to teaching English and creative writing at the prestigious Stuyvesant High School. At Stuyvesant, he revises his teaching style to end his reliance on textbooks and other teaching resources, to become an effective teacher of these bright students. 

His brothers Malachy and Michael became well known in New York while Frank is teaching at McKee; Malachy has a bar, and a knack for attracting the rich and famous to it with his stories and easy laughter. Michael has similar talents. Frank&#x27;s students ask him why he is not on television being interviewed, like his entertaining brothers. When someone at Malachy&#x27;s bar asks him when he will join Malachy and Michael in the bar, he says, when my brothers become teachers; showing his sense of humor to the world, even when the dark clouds are on his mind. He flies to Ireland in the summer to see his mother and his youngest brother.

His mother comes to New York for Christmas of 1959, 10 years after Frank arrived, wanting to see her first grandchild, Malachy&#x27;s daughter. Her youngest son Alphie is in America for the first time, 19 years old. They both stay in New York, the five of them together in New York, their dream for so long. Frank and Alberta are living together in Brooklyn, and they marry in the summer of 1961.

In 1971, Frank and his wife have a daughter, Margaret Ann, called Maggie. Frank names her after his sister who died in infancy, and his two grandmothers, who are described in &quot;Angela&#x27;s Ashes&quot;. He takes care of her as an infant, spending as much time as he can with her as she grows up, sharing early mornings with her, as he had shared early mornings with his father. The family lives in a house in Brooklyn, which Frank and Alberta have fixed up in modern style, with both of them working as teachers.

Frank&#x27;s father comes to New York once, in 1963, promising he is a new man, sober, but he arrives drunk on the ship that brings him. His three-week visit is long enough, and he returns to Northern Ireland. Eventually, Frank&#x27;s relationship with his wife turns sour. Frank leaves when their daughter is 8 years old, an action he compares to that of his father leaving his family. Frank, however, keeps seeing his daughter as she grows up, and he always has a job.

Frank&#x27;s mother, Angela McCourt, is in increasingly poor health due to emphysema and dies in New York in 1981. For his daughter Maggie, her first experience of death is losing her grandmother. Frank had lost three young siblings, many school friends, and his own grandmother by his daughter&#x27;s age.

Frank&#x27;s father, Malachy McCourt, Sr., dies in Northern Ireland in early 1985. Frank goes to Belfast with Alphie to bury their father. In August that year, Frank and his family went to Dublin and Limerick to scatter his mother&#x27;s ashes. The book ends after Frank and his brothers scatter Angela&#x27;s ashes over the graves of her family.

==Book titles==
&quot;&#x27;Tis&quot; was the final and only word of the last chapter of &quot;Angela&#x27;s Ashes&quot;, while &quot;″Tis&quot; ends with the spreading of Angela McCourt&#x27;s ashes in Ireland. Frank McCourt has remarked in several interviews, perhaps jokingly, that he originally intended for each book to have the other&#x27;s title.

Frank McCourt followed this book with another memoir, &quot;Teacher Man&quot;.

==Character list==
*Frank McCourt: The narrator and author of the book and an immigrant from Ireland, he has a deep love for literature. He marries Alberta after attending NYU. He taught as a school teacher for the latter part of his life, despite many offers to work for higher pay in the auto industry and loading docks.

*Alberta Small: Also known as &quot;Mike&quot; during her college years. She and Frank meet in college during one of their classes together. Frank is in love with her from first meeting. She studies to become a teacher. She has trouble dealing with Frank&#x27;s frequent drinking, but they eventually marry.

*Tom Clifford: Frank&#x27;s roommate and workmate after his time in the Army. Tom eventually leaves for Detroit to work in an auto factory, and urges Frank to join him. Frank declines, citing his desire to go to college as reason to stay in New York.

*Margaret Ann: Frank and Alberta&#x27;s daughter, she is named after Frank&#x27;s deceased baby-sister, Margaret.

*Andy Peters: A man Frank meets at NYU, who tells him of a good late shift job at a bank, typing loan application paperwork. Andy changes approvals for loans when he sees the day shift clearly erred in turning a person down. Andy is an NYU student in philosophy, age 31, who got a dishonorable discharge from the Army in World War II for dubious reason at age 19, which bars him from a normal job. Frank meets him again in the summer of 1959, where Andy is working at a restaurant, having given up on NYU, and still unable to get any job requiring an application form asking about his military discharge. Andy moves on a week later.

*Horace: A black Jamaican who befriends Frank at the warehouse where they work. Horace has a son in college in Canada; he encourages Frank to finish college, giving Frank the support his own father is not supplying.

== Content and structure ==
The title of the book comes from the last sentence of the previous memoir, &quot;Tis&quot;, McCourt&#x27;s answer to the rhetorical question, &quot;Isn&#x27;t this a great country altogether ?&quot; asked of him following his first night in America.

The story is told mainly in chronological order, while adding some incidents from his childhood, as they are the topics of essays for his college classes or stories he tells his students.

== Critical reception ==
L.S. Keep of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, described the memoir as a good successor of &quot;Angela&#x27;s Ashes,&quot; concluding that &quot;this book has the same clairvoyant eye for quirks of class, character, and fate, and also a distinct picaresque quality. It&#x27;s a quest for an America of wholesome Hollywood happiness that doesn&#x27;t exist, and it&#x27;s about the real America — rendered with comic affection — that McCourt discovers along the way. &quot; Similarly, Margo Hammond of the &quot;St. Petersburg Times&quot; found the memoir a good read, though McCourt was unable to provide a satisfactory narrative arc to the work. Commenting for the public radio station WKMS, Jacque Day called the memoir &quot;an exercise in humanity by a man with a rare gift for a story, and a brogue that sings on.&quot; A review of &quot;″Tis: A Memoir&quot;, first published in 1999, in the &quot;Tampa Bay Times&quot; noted the difference in McCourt&#x27;s clear insight into his parents&#x27; choices compared to his understanding of his own motives, said that &quot;McCourt&#x27;s memoir actually is all the more human for this peculiar lack of reflection from an author that has seemed so uncannily perceptive in so many other areas. It reminds us once again that poverty doesn&#x27;t necessarily ennoble people. We can only hope that the scars are few for those fortunate enough to survive it as successfully as Frank McCourt.&quot;

Terry Golway opens his review with the statement that &quot;You have to be Irish to hate Frank McCourt.&quot; That reflects the candor, brutal candor, of Frank McCourt&#x27;s writing on his life in New York city, following his first memoir on his life in Ireland. Golway compares McCourt&#x27;s effect on Irish-Americans to that of Philip Roth on Jewish-Americans: &quot;Mr. McCourt is to the Irish of the late 1990&#x27;s what Philip Roth was to Jewish Americans in the late 1960&#x27;s.&quot; His review in &quot;The New York Observer&quot; goes on to state that &quot;&quot;Tis&quot; is a remarkable and brutally candid exploration of one man&#x27;s life in New York, and Mr. McCourt is as tough on himself as he is on the racists and drunks and lost souls he meets along the way.&quot;

The memoir has been criticized for ignoring McCourt&#x27;s marriage to psychotherapist Cheryl Floyd, which followed his divorce from Alberta.

<text>Homer Price is the central character in two children&#x27;s books written and illustrated by Robert McCloskey, and title character of the first. &quot;Homer Price&quot; was published in 1943, and &quot;Centerburg Tales&quot; in 1951.

==Characters==
Homer lives in Centerburg, Ohio. He is a mild-mannered boy who enjoys fixing radios, and who somehow gets involved in a series of outrageous incidents, such as tending an inexplicably unstoppable doughnut-making machine in his uncle&#x27;s diner, or caring for mystery plants that turn out to be a giant form of allergy-inducing ragweed. He does odd jobs like raking leaves, and sweeping up the diner or the nearby barber shop. Sometimes he is also hired by his uncle to tend to the labor-saving devices in his cafe and mix doughnut batter. His main job is helping out in his father&#x27;s business, a motor court, where Homer also resides.

James Daugherty said of &quot;Homer Price&quot;, &quot;It is America laughing at itself with a broad and genial humanity, without bitterness or sourness or sophistication.&quot;

One of Homer Price&#x27;s adventures, &quot;The Case of the Cosmic Comic&quot;, parodies the Superman phenomenon, with Homer and his best friend Freddy attending the local personal appearance of Freddy&#x27;s favorite superhero. Freddy is unable to understand that &quot;The Super-Duper&quot; is an ordinary actor in a costume, and expects him to be capable of super feats. Homer, however, quietly displays a more mature view of the hero.

Another adventure of Homer&#x27;s is when an adult friend of his in Centerburg wins a contest for composing an advertising jingle for shaving lotion, but the prize money is stolen on the air in an armed robbery. By chance, the robbers are staying at the same motor court, and Homer sees it as his chance to stop them and claim a cash reward in order to build all sorts of radios and an (at the time) expensive television. Although Homer is eager to profit from the reward, he is also genuinely interested in bringing the robbers to justice, as they stole from a man he knew.

Flim-flam merchants and larger-than-life paraphernalia appear in several stories. One features a snake-oil salesman—Professor Atmos P. H. Ear—offloading an odorless, colorless, tasteless chemical called &quot;Ever-So-Much-More-So&quot; that when sprinkled on things, supposedly enhances everything, making a soft bed softer, a fast car faster, and so on.

Many of the male residents of Centerburg share first names with classical figures; &quot;Grandpa Hercules&quot;, &quot;Uncle Ulysses&quot;, &quot;Uncle Telemachus&quot;, and Homer himself.

Miss Terwilliger is a comely and likeable spinster who loves to knit. Both the sheriff and Uncle &quot;Telly&quot; Telemachus want to marry Miss Terwilliger, but she is unable to decide which of them she likes better. Eventually the two suitors hold a contest to see who has the largest ball of string, with the winner getting to marry Miss Terwilliger. She ends up beating them both by secretly unwinding the string in her skirt when her formal collection of string runs out, but still marries Uncle Telly, who came in second. The sheriff, however, accepts his loss with dignity, as he was best man at their wedding and they will invite him to dinner every Thursday night.

African-American characters appear in the books, portrayed benignly as ordinary citizens. During a centennial celebration of Centerburg, a chorus from the African Baptist Church provides vocal harmony for the show. A black boy wins $100 for finding a lost bracelet inside a doughnut, although he announces his find as &quot;I gawt it!&quot; and the illustration of this shows him wearing markedly tattered clothes.

==Stories==
===Homer Price===
1. &quot;The Case of the Sensational Scent&quot;

The first thing Homer hears upon assembling his new homemade radio is news of a robbery. He and his pet skunk meet the robbers the next day, and the encounter leads to their identification.

2. &quot;The Case of the Cosmic Comic&quot;

Homer and Freddy meet their comic book hero, the Super-Duper (a pastiche of Superman), when he appears in person at the Centerburg movie theater, but unintentionally learn an uncomfortable truth about him.

3. &quot;The Doughnuts&quot;

Uncle Ulysses installs a new doughnut maker at his lunchroom in downtown Centerburg. While his uncle is out and most of the town is at the movies, Homer is waiting on a hobo who works as a &quot;sandwich man&quot; in advertising and a wealthy woman who shows Homer how to make delicious doughnuts using an old family recipe of hers. However, Homer comments on the tremendous amount of batter, which makes the machine provide more than enough for everyone in town.

4. &quot;Mystery Yarn&quot;

Homer&#x27;s Uncle Telly and the local sheriff are rivals for two things: the hand of a local widow, and the title of World&#x27;s Greatest String Saver. The contest becomes a County Fair event, heightened when the widow herself enters with a ball of scrap yarn.

5. &quot;Nothing New under the Sun (Hardly)&quot;

A stranger with the proverbial &quot;better mousetrap&quot; arrives in Centerburg, offering his services to the town.

6. &quot;Wheels of Progress&quot;

Centerburg holds its yearly pageant, as the locals celebrate both their history and a new, modern subdivision of prefabricated houses. Each are threatened when a promised set of street signs are not posted on time, leaving the residents lost on their way home.

=== Centerburg Tales ===
1. &quot;Grandpa Hercules&quot;

Homer&#x27;s Grandpa Herc tells stories of the frontier, such as &quot;The Hide-a-Ride&quot;, &quot;Sparrow Courthouse&quot; and &quot;The Gravity-Bitties&quot;.

2. &quot;Experiment 13&quot;

Local ne&#x27;er-do-well Dulcy Dooner inherits a greenhouse from his late uncle, a famous botanist, and literally plants the seeds of trouble, when Dulcy discovers an unfinished experiment.

3. &quot;Ever-So-Much-More-So&quot;

A traveling salesman peddles cans of an invisible product which he guarantees will enhance one&#x27;s life experiences.

4. &quot;Pie and Punch and You-Know-Whats&quot;

A new record on the jukebox in Uncle Ulysses&#x27;s lunchroom has a song whose catchiness is such that nobody who hears it is able to stop singing.

<doc id="923751" wikidata="Q252293" url="?curid=923751" title="Iowa Stars">
<text>The Iowa Stars, later known as the Iowa Chops, were a professional ice hockey team in the American Hockey League. The club was based in Des Moines, Iowa at the Wells Fargo Arena.

==History==
The Stars were founded by Howard Baldwin, of Hockey Holdings &amp; Management Group, and Dallas businessman Bob Schlegel, who took the dormant Louisville Panthers AHL franchise and resurrected it for the 2005–06 season as the Iowa Stars (the same name as an earlier team in 1969–70 in the Central Hockey League). They had a five-year affiliation agreement with the Dallas Stars and a one-year agreement with the Anaheim Ducks.

In their inaugural season, the Stars made it to the Calder Cup playoffs first round, where they were defeated by the Milwaukee Admirals. The Stars won their first playoff series the following season, defeating the Omaha Ak-Sar-Ben Knights in six games.

In February 2008, the Dallas Stars announced they would be affiliating with the future Texas Stars pending the 2009 completion of the Cedar Park Entertainment Center in Cedar Park, Texas. After the 2007–08 AHL season, the Dallas Stars left the Iowa scene, and the Anaheim Ducks announced an affiliation with the team.

On July 9, 2008, the team unveiled its new name and logo, featuring a &quot;vicious boar’s head in the team colors of crimson, grey and black&quot;.

Portland Pirates assistant Gord Dineen was named head coach of the Iowa Chops on August 19, 2008.

On May 9, 2009, the Anaheim Ducks dropped their affiliation with the Chops, leaving Iowa to look for their third NHL affiliate in four seasons.

On July 7, 2009, the Iowa Chops franchise was suspended by the AHL&#x27;s board of governors for the 2009-10 AHL season for being &quot;unable to remedy certain violations of the provisions of the league’s Constitution and By-Laws.&quot; While the AHL declined further comment on the reasons for the suspension, the &quot;Des Moines Register&quot; reported in June, 2009, that the Chops had violated league rules by pledging the team as collateral for a $1.99 million loan from Wachovia. The &quot;Register&quot; also reported that the Ducks had dropped their affiliation with the Chops after the Chops missed payments on their affiliation contract.

After several months of speculation as to their future, the AHL announced on May 4, 2010, that the Texas Stars had acquired the Chops franchise. This transaction finalized the Stars&#x27; contractual obligation to acquire a permanent franchise in the league, as they operated in 2009–10 as an expansion team under a provisional agreement to obtain an existing franchise license.

<text>The Toyota RAV4 EV is an all-electric version of the popular RAV4 SUV produced by Toyota until 2014. Two generations of the EV model were sold in California, and to fleets elsewhere in the US, with a gap of almost ten years between them.

The first generation was leased from 1997 to 2003, and at the lessees&#x27; request, many units were sold after the vehicle was discontinued. A total of 1,484 were leased and/or sold in California to meet the state&#x27;s mandate for zero-emissions vehicle. A small number were sold or leased in fleet sales in other states. As of mid-2012, there were almost 500 vehicles still in use in California. Production of the second generation EV was limited to 2,600 units during a three-year run, with sales limited to California beginning in 2012. Production ended in September 2014. A total of 2,489 units of the second generation model were sold in California through April 2015.

Toyota worked together with Tesla Motors and Panasonic to develop the second generation RAV4 EV, and the electric SUV was released in the United States in September 2012. The US Environmental Protection Agency rated the second generation RAV4 EV with a range of and a combined fuel economy rating of 76 miles per gallon gasoline equivalent ().

==First generation (1997)==
The first fleet version of the RAV4 EV became available on a limited basis in 1997. In 2001 it was possible for businesses, cities or utilities to lease one or two of these cars. Toyota then actually sold or leased 328 RAV4 EVs to the general public in 2003, at which time the program was terminated despite waiting lists of prospective customers. Overall, approximately 1,900 units were sold or leased through 2003, of which approximately 1,500 in the U.S. and 400 in Japan.

The RAV4 EV closely resembles the regular internal combustion engine (ICE) version - without a tailpipe - and has a governed top speed of with an EPA rated range of . The 95 amp-hour nickel–metal hydride battery (NiMH) has a capacity of , charges inductively and has proven to be very durable. Some RAV4 EVs have been driven more than using the original battery pack. It was also one of the few vehicles with a single speed gearbox when introduced to the market.

Beyond the unusual power train (batteries, controller and motor), the remaining systems in the RAV4 EV are comparable to the gasoline-powered RAV4. The power brakes, power steering, tire wear and suspension components are similar except that they use electric power sources. The power brakes use an electric pump to provide vacuum instead of deriving vacuum from the engine manifold. The power steering use an electric motor instead of mechanical energy delivered by fan belts. The passenger compartment is heated and cooled electrically using a heat pump (the first fleet application of a heat pump in a road vehicle).

===Performance===
The RAV4 EV production has a governed top speed of , a tested 0 to time of around 18 seconds (depending on state-of-charge on the batteries). Its EPA rated driving range is with an EPA combined fuel economy rating of 43 kW·h/100 mi (equivalent to 78 MPGe). Actual fuel economy and range depends on the same factors as a traditional gasoline-powered vehicle including rolling resistance and average speed (aerodynamic drag).

The RAV4 EV battery pack uses 24 12-volt, 95Ah NiMH batteries capable of storing 27 kWh of energy.

===Charging===
Production vehicles use the Magne Charge connector, a inductive charging paddle produced by General Motors subsidiary Delco Electronics also used on other electric vehicles of the time including the EV1 and Chevy S10 EV. The inlet was mounted on the front grille of the vehicle. When using a 6kW charging unit on a 240-volt, 30-amp circuit, the RAV4 EV&#x27;s batteries can be recharged from being fully depleted to fully charged in about five hours, the process monitored by a passive battery balancing system.

Some RAV4 EV prototypes were charged via a front fender mounted conductive charger coupling made by Yazaki Corporation.

===Mileage costs===
Charging a RAV4 EV from full-dead to full-charge uses approximately 30 kW·h of electricity; the excess above the battery pack capacity is used by the charging system. At a rate of per kilowatt-hour, this costs around . As of May 2008, based on a gasoline price-per-gallon cost of and up and the non-EV 2003 RAV4 2-wheel-drive gasoline fuel efficiency of , the RAV4 EV costs approximately 5 times less a per mile basis, and makes mileage in the RAV4 EV the cost equivalent to a small SUV.

In addition, the RAV4 EV has a charge timer built into the dashboard that enables the vehicle to start charging at a specific time. As the RAV4 EV easily becomes the main cost of electricity in an average-sized home, this enables the owner to use a Time-Of-Day Meter to reduce electricity costs. This configuration is a standard practice with RAV4 EV owners. The price of electricity at night depends on the carrier, but is usually in the range of 60% of the normal rate. In the use of charging the RAV4 EV, this equates to a cheaper cost-per-mile, roughly equivalent to a vehicle capable of , based on a price of per gallon.

The United States Environmental Protection Agency listed mileage ratings for the RAV4 EV in its yearly Fuel Economy Guide from 2000 through 2003. The 2003 model recorded fuel efficiency of 39 kW·h/100 mi city, 49 kW·h/100 mi highway; the city mileage rating was equivalent to , and on the highway. The EPA rated combined mileage was .

In 2007, the EPA updated its rating system and revised the ratings to a city equivalent of , highway equivalent of , and a combined equivalent of .

===Consumable items===
The RAV4 EV&#x27;s battery system is a consumable item. Toyota reports that battery pack replacement costs are currently higher than the value of the used vehicle. Toyota tested the RAV4 EV in Japan for over two years before introducing the vehicle in the United States. The economies of scale are affecting the replacement cost of the RAV4 EV.

===Prototyping===

RAV4 EV pre-production prototypes were first released in a confidential evaluation program with electric utilities throughout the U.S. These prototypes were based on the smaller, shorter, two-door version of the RAV4. The prototypes included some versions fitted with Panasonic NiMH batteries, and others with high-performance Panasonic lead–acid PbA batteries (the same ones that eventually found their way into the EV1 and other production GM electric vehicles). The RAV4 EV prototypes also were equipped with on-board level 2 chargers and connected via a front fender conductive charger coupling made by Yazaki Corporation. Both prototypes were well accepted.

The utility employee evaluators did not have to personally pay for the more costly and advanced NiMH batteries, and the NiMH RAV4 EV prototype received better reviews, due to its increased range. Its energy efficiency, however, was not as good as the PbA version. Due to the impracticality of developing two battery types for a limited volume program, Toyota opted for the higher-performance, higher-cost NiMH RAV4 EV. This resulted in a greater manufacturing cost, and higher purchase price.

A number of electric vehicle advocates voiced disappointment that the choice was made to manufacture only the NiMH version. Many electric vehicle advocates claimed that automaker&#x27;s choice of the NiMH battery worked against the 1990s deployment of cost-effective electric vehicles based on PbA batteries, and that further development of lead–acid technology could result in performance equal to NiMH, but at a substantially lower price. Their argument was that a usable electric vehicle is possible at a substantially lower price, and that the lower purchase price would foster greater acceptance of electric vehicles. In fact, lithium-ion batteries soon displaced both nickel and lead from electromobiles.

===Corporate purchasing===
Initially, RAV4 EVs were only available for three-year fleet lease, not for sale and not for lease to the public, at a few dealerships beginning in 1997. From 2001, leases were made available to small &quot;fleets of one&quot; purportedly run by small businesses.

===Public availability===
In March 2002, due to a shift in corporate policy, the Toyota RAV4-EV was made available for sale to the general public. All 328 that Toyota made were sold. No one knows for certain what prompted Toyota to change their position on the RAV4-EV, since they had long since fulfilled their obligations under the MOA with the California Air Resources Board&#x27;s zero-emissions vehicle (ZEV) mandate via its fleet lease program.

The MSRP was ; but in California, ZIP-grant rebates of , decreasing in 2003 to , and a credit from the Internal Revenue Service brought the price down to a more palatable ( for some 2003 deliveries), including the home charger.

More RAV4-EVs were sold than had been planned for manufacture through standard assembly line techniques. Toyota filled every order despite the fact that the last few dozen vehicles had to be assembled from spare parts due to a shortfall of production components (a significantly more expensive way of building a vehicle). This unexpected development caused deliveries to trickle on into September 2003. It also caused variations in the vehicles such as heated seats, retractable antennae, mats, etc.

The last of the 328 EVs was sold in November 2002.

===Sales===
In the eight years up to 2003, the RAV4 EV achieved a sales performance of approximately 1,900 units, of which 1,484 were leased and/or sold in California.

===Chevron patent encumbrance===

Whether or not Toyota wanted to continue production, it was unlikely to be able to do so because the battery was no longer available. Chevron had inherited control of the worldwide patent rights for the NiMH battery when it merged with Texaco, which had purchased them from General Motors. Chevron&#x27;s unit won a settlement from Toyota and Panasonic, the manufacturer of the battery, and the production line for the large NiMH batteries was closed down and dismantled. This case was settled in the ICC International Court of Arbitration, and not publicized due to a gag order placed on Toyota. Only smaller NiMH batteries, incapable of powering an electric vehicle or plugging in, were allowed by Chevron-Texaco.

== Second generation (2012) ==
The second generation RAV4 EV was released in September 2012 starting at a price of before any government incentives. Toyota also offered a 36-month lease option at per month with down payment of . The RAV4 EV was sold only in California, and sales began in the San Francisco Bay Area, Los Angeles/Orange County and San Diego. Production was limited to 2,600 during three years. The RAV4 EV was available to individual consumers and fleet customers. Due to the capacity of its battery pack the RAV4 EV qualified for the maximum federal tax credit and also was eligible for a rebate in California. A total of 192 units were sold during 2012 and 1,096 during 2013. A total of 2,489 units were sold in the U.S. through April 2015. The production run ended in September 2014.

===History===
The first prototype was built in just three weeks after the signing of a joint development agreement where Toyota helped the then fledgling electric automaker Tesla start production in the NUMMI factory Toyota was vacating in Fremont, California. Toyota&#x27;s partner Panasonic was also involved in the development, just as when Toyota developed the first generation of the RAV4 EV. The electric SUV was developed by Tesla and Toyota Technical Center U.S.A. in Michigan. Testing began in July 2010.

A demonstrator was unveiled at the November 2010 Los Angeles Auto Show. Toyota built 35 of these converted RAV4s (Phase Zero vehicles) for a demonstration and evaluation program that ran through 2011. The lithium metal-oxide battery and other power train components were supplied by Tesla. These prototypes had a lithium-ion battery pack with a 50 kWh total capacity (37 kWh usable) and achieved a range of between . The prototypes used components from the Tesla Roadster (first generation).

On July 15, 2011, Tesla entered into a supply and services agreement with Toyota for the supply of a validated electric powertrain system, including a battery, charging system, inverter, motor, gearbox and associated software.

The re-engineered RAV4 EV production version (Phase One vehicle) was unveiled at the May 2012 International Electric Vehicle Symposium in Los Angeles. Production models use the SAE J1772 charging standard. The battery pack, electronics and powertrain components in the production version are similar to those in used in the Tesla Model S sedan launched in June 2012.

===Powertrain===
The second generation RAV4 EV combines an electric powertrain from Tesla and a battery produced by Panasonic in a chassis built by Toyota.

The electric motor supplied by Tesla is an AC induction motor, a departure from Toyota&#x27;s practice of using synchronous permanent-magnet motors in their hybrid electric vehicles. A fixed-gear open-differential transaxle has a gear ratio of 9.73. The RAV4 EV weighs , heavier than a front-wheel drive RAV4 Limited with the V-6 engine.

The RAV 4 offers two drive modes: Normal and Sport. Peak power output of the motor is , with peak torque in normal mode of , and peak torque in sport mode of . Maximum vehicle speed in Normal mode is , and maximum in Sport mode, which also has a more aggressive accelerator pedal feel, is . The US Environmental Protection Agency rated the RAV4 EV combined economy at , with in city driving and on highways. While the quarter mile time is not officially rated from Toyota, the RAV4 EV (FWD) Facebook community has posted dragslip results of 15.71s at . This is only marginally slower than the RAV4 V6 AWD (with 269HP) which has published quarter mile times of 14.8-14.9 at .

===Battery and range===
The battery pack is a 386 V lithium-ion battery pack comprising about 4,500 cells and rated at 41.8 kW·h of usable energy at full charge, with a maximum power output of 129 kW. The RAV4 EV features a 10 kW onboard charger (SAE J1772 240 V, 40 A input). The battery pack is located below the floorpan, reducing the ground clearance as compared with the gasoline-powered version by a couple of inches, but the electric SUV&#x27;s cargo space of is the same as its gasoline sibling. The battery pack weighs and because it is located in the lowest part of the vehicle, the lower center of gravity provides a better handling than the conventional Toyota RAV4.

The RAV4 EV has two charge modes: Standard and Extended. In standard mode, the high voltage battery charges only up to 35 kWh and Toyota expected the electric SUV to achieve an EPA driving range rating of for this charging mode. Extended mode allows the battery to charge to its full usable capacity of 41.8 kWh, providing an expected EPA driving range of according to Toyota estimates. The EPA rated just one range of . Standard mode is designed to optimize battery life over range; however, the 8-year, 100,000-mile battery warranty cover the packs regardless of the mix of charge modes over the pack&#x27;s life. However, due to EPA&#x27;s procedures, Toyota expects the Monroney label to show the combined range of .

Charging time with a 40 A/240 V charging station is 5 hours in Standard Mode and 6 hours for Extended Mode; the onboard charger delivers 9.6 kW. Toyota had arranged with Leviton to offer a custom level 2 charging station priced at including basic installation. On the other end of the scale, and due to its large battery pack, charging at 120 volts with the cord that comes standard under the rear deck takes 44 hours for Standard Mode and 52 hours for Extended Mode.
An aftermarket company called Quick Charge Power has come up with a way to add 48 kW CHAdeMO DC Quick Charging to the RAV4ev which dramatically shortens charge times for the 41.8 kWh battery. This can make the car tremendously more useful in areas where this charging infrastructure exists.

===Production===
The RAV4 EV began assembly in 2012 at Toyota Motor Manufacturing Canada in Woodstock, Ontario alongside the regular gasoline version. Tesla built the electric powertrain at its plant at Toyota&#x27;s old NUMMI facility, now the Tesla Fremont Factory, in Fremont, California, and then shipped them to Canada. About 2,500 RAV4 EV vehicles were built between 2012 and 2014. The battery supply deal between Toyota and Tesla concluded with the end of production in August 2014. In 2017, Toyota sold all its shares in Tesla.

<doc id="923756" wikidata="Q5593854" url="?curid=923756" title="Grammy Award for Best Performance by a Vocal Group">
<text>The Grammy Award for Best Performance by a Vocal Group was awarded from 1961 to 1968. In its first year, the award specified that a &quot;vocal group&quot; contains two to six artists. This award was presented alongside the award for Best Performance by a Chorus. Before 1961 these awards were combined into the Grammy Award for Best Performance by a Vocal Group or Chorus.

Although in the &quot;pop&quot; field the award did not specify pop music performances and, in some years, ran alongside the award now presented as the Grammy Award for Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal.

Years reflect the year in which the Grammy Awards were presented, for works released in the previous year.

<text>The Grammy Award for Best Performance by a Chorus was awarded from 1961 to 1968. In its first year, the award specified that a &quot;chorus&quot; contains seven or more artists. This award was presented alongside the award for Best Performance by a Vocal Group. Before 1961 these awards were combined into the Grammy Award for Best Performance by a Vocal Group or Chorus.

Although in the &quot;pop&quot; field the award did not specify pop music performances. In 1969 and 1970 a pop-specific award was presented for Best Contemporary Performance by a Chorus.

<text>Rounders is a 1998 American drama film about the underground world of high-stakes poker, directed by John Dahl and starring Matt Damon and Edward Norton. The story follows two friends who need to win at high-stakes poker to quickly pay off a large debt. The term &quot;rounder&quot; refers to a person traveling around from city to city seeking high-stakes card games.

&quot;Rounders&quot; opened to mixed reviews and was moderately successful at the box office. Following the poker boom in the early 2000s, the film became a cult hit. A novelization of the film was written by Kevin Canty and released by Hyperion Books.

== Plot ==
New York City law student and gifted poker player Mike McDermott dreams of winning the World Series of Poker. At an underground Texas hold &#x27;em game run by Russian mobster Teddy &quot;KGB&quot;, an overconfident Mike loses his entire $30,000 bankroll in a single hand. Shaken, he promises his girlfriend and fellow student Jo he has quit poker, and concentrates on law school. His mentor Joey Knish offers to stake him to rebuild his bankroll but Mike declines and accepts a part-time job to make money.

Months pass and Mike stays true to his promise until his childhood friend Lester &quot;Worm&quot; Murphy is released from prison. While Mike is an honest player, Worm is a hustler and unapologetic cheat. To help Worm pay off a debt, Mike sets him up with games across town and reluctantly sits in on one, interfering with his studies and his relationship with Jo. Mike allows Worm to play on his credit at the Chesterfield Club. After being loaned $2,000, Worm gets up to $10,000 and cashes out for the full amount which starts a tab in Mike&#x27;s name. Worm runs into Grama, a dangerous pimp, who reveals he is working for KGB and has bought Worm&#x27;s debt, now totaling $25,000 with interest. Grama takes Worm&#x27;s $10,000, threatening him to pay the rest. As Mike returns to his poker lifestyle and friends, Jo ends their relationship.

Mike learns from Petra at the Chesterfield that Worm has racked up a $7,000 debt in Mike&#x27;s name. Worm tells Mike about Grama but withholds the KGB connection. Mike vouches for Worm to Grama but Worm and Grama insult each other and nearly come to blows. Grama gives them five days to pay the remaining $15,000. Mike decides to help Worm win the money by playing in several games in and around the city.

Mike wins $7,200 in three days, but still needs to more than double it in forty-eight hours. Worm drives Mike to Binghamton for a game hosted by New York state troopers, where he comes close to winning the $7,800 needed before Worm unexpectedly joins the game. Soon after, a trooper catches Worm base-dealing to help Mike; they are beaten up and relieved of their entire bankroll. Worm confesses that Grama is working for KGB and decides to flee; Mike returns to the city alone.

Mike asks Grama for more time, to no avail. He asks Knish for the money but is refused out of principle. Knish chastises him for poor decisions and Mike finally reveals why he took the ill-fated risk at KGB&#x27;s club: he once beat poker legend Johnny Chan at a single hand in Atlantic City and thinks he can compete and possibly win the World Series of Poker. Desperate, Mike goes to his law professor, Petrovsky, who loans him $10,000. Mike challenges KGB to a second heads-up no-limit Texas hold &#x27;em game for the remaining debt, with winner-take-all stakes, which KGB accepts. Mike beats KGB in the first session, winning $20,000. KGB offers to let Mike&#x27;s winnings &quot;ride&quot; and continue the game, but Mike – with enough to pay off most of his debts – declines. As he is about to leave, KGB taunts that he is paying Mike with the money that he won from their previous game. Mike changes his mind and decides to continue playing.

Mike doubles the blinds at the risk of losing everything, and possibly his life, to KGB. As the night wears on, he spots KGB&#x27;s tell and folds a crucial hand. Irate at missing a chance to bust Mike, KGB begins to play on &quot;tilt&quot;. In the final hand, Mike baits a boastful KGB into going all-in and defeats him with a nut straight. KGB throws a tantrum at having been lured into a mistake. The rattled KGB calls off his goons and admits that Mike won fairly, allowing him to leave with his winnings.

With over $60,000, Mike settles Worm&#x27;s $15,000 debt to Grama, the Chesterfield&#x27;s $6,000 credit, his professor&#x27;s $10,000 loan, and restores his original bankroll of &quot;three stacks of high society&quot;. He drops out of law school, bids Jo goodbye, and leaves for Las Vegas to play in the World Series of Poker.

==Cast==


== Production ==
Principal photography for &quot;Rounders&quot; began in December 1997; it took place mostly in New York City. Exceptions include the law school scenes (filmed at Rutgers School of Law-Newark) and the State Trooper poker game and parking lot scenes (filmed at the B.P.O Elks Lodge in Ridgefield Park, New Jersey).

== Soundtrack ==
The soundtrack features the song &quot;Baby, I&#x27;m a Big Star Now&quot; by Counting Crows. The song plays during the end credits, and appeared as a bonus track in the UK version of the album Saturday Nights &amp; Sunday Mornings.

== Reception ==

=== Box office ===
&quot;Rounders&quot; was released on September 11, 1998, in 2,176 theaters and grossed $8.5 million during its opening weekend. It went on to make $22.9 million domestically.

=== Critical response ===
On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 64% based on 81 reviews, with an average score of 6.2/10. The site&#x27;s critical consensus reads: &quot;Richly atmospheric and colorful performances contributed to the movie&#x27;s entertainment value.&quot; Metacritic gives the film a weighted average score of 54 out of 100 based on 32 reviews, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;B−&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave the film three stars out of four and wrote: &quot;&quot;Rounders&quot; sometimes has a noir look but it never has a noir feel, because it&#x27;s not about losers (or at least it doesn&#x27;t admit it is). It&#x27;s essentially a sports picture, in which the talented hero wins, loses, faces disaster, and then is paired off one last time against the champ.&quot; In her review for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Janet Maslin wrote: &quot;Though John Dahl&#x27;s &quot;Rounders&quot; finally adds up to less than meets the eye, what does meet the eye (and ear) is mischievously entertaining.&quot; &quot;USA Today&quot; gave the film three out of four stars and wrote: &quot;The card playing is well-staged, and even those who don&#x27;t know a Texas hold-&#x27;em (&#x27;the Cadillac of poker&#x27;) from a Texas hoedown will get a vicarious charge out of the action.&quot; &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; gave the film a &quot;B&quot; rating and Owen Gleiberman wrote, &quot;Norton, cast in what might have once been the Sean Penn role (hideous shirts, screw-you attitude), gives Worm a shifty, amphetamine soul and a pleasing alacrity ... Norton&#x27;s performance never really goes anywhere, but that&#x27;s okay, since the story is just an excuse to lead the characters from one poker table to the next.&quot;

Peter Travers, in his review for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; said of John Malkovich&#x27;s performance: &quot;Of course, no one could guess the extent to which Malkovich is now capable of chewing scenery. He surpasses even his eyeballrolling as Cyrus the Virus in &quot;Con Air&quot;. Munching Oreo cookies, splashing the pot with chips (a poker no-no) and speaking with a Russian accent that defies deciphering (&quot;Ho-kay, Meester sum of a beech&quot;), Malkovich soars so far over the top, he&#x27;s passing Pluto.&quot; In his review for the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot;, Mick LaSalle said of Damon&#x27;s performance: &quot;Mike should supply the drive the film otherwise lacks, and Damon doesn&#x27;t. We might believe he can play cards, but we don&#x27;t believe he needs to do it, in the way, say, that the 12-year-old Mozart needed to write symphonies. He&#x27;s not consumed with genius. He&#x27;s a nice guy with a skill.&quot; In his review for &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot;, Liam Lacey wrote: &quot;The main problem with &quot;Rounders&quot; is that the movie never quite knows what it is about: What is the moral ante?&quot;

Despite an unremarkable theatrical release, &quot;Rounders&quot; has a following, particularly among poker enthusiasts.

There are pro poker players who credit the film for getting them into the game. The film drew in successful players such as Brian Rast, Hevad Khan, Gavin Griffin, and Dutch Boyd. Vanessa Rousso has said of the film&#x27;s influence: &quot;There have been lots of movies that have included poker, but only &quot;Rounders&quot; really captures the energy and tension in the game. And that&#x27;s why it stands as the best poker movie ever made.&quot;

<text>The Grammy Awards in the Best Contemporary (R&amp;R) Performance categories were awarded in 1966, 1967 and 1968. They appeared in different guises at the Grammys, aimed at male and female soloists and duos/groups. The Recording Academy used these categories to distinguish contemporary or rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll recordings from traditional pop recordings, which had their own Best Pop Vocal Performance categories for male and female soloists and for duos or groups.

==Winners and nominees==
After 1968, the contemporary/rock and roll categories and the pop vocal categories merged into the Best Contemporary/Pop Vocal Performance categories. The fact that in 1968, the three winners in the Male, Female and Group categories of the Best Contemporary Performance were identical to the winners of the Best Vocal Performance categories (Bobbie Gentry, Glen Campbell and The Fifth Dimension), had shown that the distinction between the two category groups was difficult to recognise.

The Best Contemporary Single category returned in 1970 and 1971, when it was renamed Best Contemporary Song.

<doc id="923779" wikidata="Q1655688" url="?curid=923779" title="Uncrewed spaceflights to the International Space Station">
<text>Uncrewed spaceflights to the [[International Space Station]] (ISS) are made primarily to deliver cargo, however several Russian modules have also docked to the outpost following uncrewed launches. Resupply missions typically use the Russian Progress spacecraft, European Automated Transfer Vehicles, Japanese Kounotori vehicles, and the American Dragon and Cygnus spacecraft. The primary docking system for Progress spacecraft is the automated Kurs system, with the manual TORU system as a backup. ATVs also use Kurs, however they are not equipped with TORU. The other spacecraft — the Japanese HTV, the SpaceX Dragon (under CRS phase 1) and the Northrop Grumman Cygnus — rendezvous with the station before being grappled using Canadarm2 and berthed at the nadir port of the Harmony or Unity module for one to two months. Progress, Cygnus and ATV can remain docked for up to six months. Under CRS phase 2, Cargo Dragon docks autonomously at IDA-2 or 3 as the case may be. As of February 2025
, Progress spacecraft have flown most of the uncrewed missions to the ISS.

To avoid confusion, this list includes Soyuz MS-23, which was launched uncrewed and landed crewed, but does not include Soyuz MS-22 and Boeing Crewed Flight Test, which was launched crewed and landed uncrewed, which is listed at List of human spaceflights to the International Space Station.

== Current and completed spaceflights ==

This is a list of uncrewed spaceflights to the International Space Station. 

Key to box background colors:
* Module launch
* Launch failure, spacecraft did not reach orbit
* Partial failure, spacecraft reached orbit but did not rendezvous with ISS

&quot;Note&quot;: Russia has delivered cargo via the uncrewed missions of Progress since the launch of the ISS, while the U.S. had used Space Shuttles for hybrid human/cargo missions, resulting in a greater number of Russian uncrewed flights to the ISS. Since the discontinuation of the Space Shuttle program in 2011, the numbers of crewed and uncrewed flights by the U.S. and Russia are more closely matched.


== Future spaceflights ==
Scheduled future flights are shown below:

==Spaceports==

===Baikonur Cosmodrome===
Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan is the oldest and busiest spaceport. The first module of the ISS was launched from Baikonur Cosmodrome Site 81 as the uncrewed spacecraft Zarya in 1998 and flew uncrewed for about two years before the first crew arrived. The Progress spacecraft is the most frequent cargo ship sent from Baikonur to the station, bringing supplies such as food, fuel, gas, experiments, and parts. Its light payload is offset by its ability to deliver critical replacement parts at short notice. Fresh fruit and vegetables from the earth are an important part of the crew&#x27;s diet.

===Tanegashima Space Center===
Located in Japan on an island south of Kyūshū, the Tanegashima Space Center (TCS) is the launch site for H-II Transfer Vehicle (HTV), called , used to resupply the &quot;Kibō&quot; Japanese Experiment Module (JEM) and the ISS. The name &quot;Kounotori&quot; was chosen for the HTV by JAXA because &quot;a white stork carries an image of conveying an important thing (a baby, happiness, and other joyful things), therefore, it precisely expresses the HTV&#x27;s mission to transport essential materials to the ISS&quot;.

White Kounotori can carry of cargo in total, about of which is accessible by the crew in the pressurized section, the remainder is unpressurised cargo on Exposed Pallet to be handled by the ISS&#x27;s robotic arm.

=== Guiana Space Centre ===
The European Space Agency (ESA) uses the Guiana Space Centre near Kourou in French Guiana. Operational since 1968, it is particularly suitable as a location for a spaceport due to its proximity to the equator, and that launches are in a favorable direction over water. The near-equatorial launch location provides an advantage for launches to low-inclination (or geostationary) Earth orbits compared to launches from spaceports at higher latitude, the eastward boost provided by the Earth&#x27;s rotation is about at this spaceport.

The ESA&#x27;s Automated Transfer Vehicle weighs at launch and has a cargo capacity of including of dry cargo, up to of gases (water, nitrogen, oxygen, air), with up to two gases per flight, and up to of propellant for boosting and refueling the station.

===Cape Canaveral Space Force Station===
Cape Canaveral Space Force Station, located in Florida, United States, has been operational since 1950 with its first orbital launch occurring in 1958. All of NASA&#x27;s crewed Mercury and Gemini missions were launched from the Cape, along with some of the earlier Apollo missions. Cape Canaveral is adjacent to the Kennedy Space Center, where the majority of Apollo missions and all the Space Shuttle missions were launched from. Under contract with NASA, SpaceX launches the Dragon 2 Cargo variant spacecraft to resupply the American portion of the ISS. The Dragon can transport of pressurized and unpressurized cargo and can return to Earth. It is the only uncrewed resupply vehicle capable of returning a payload.

===Mid-Atlantic Regional Spaceport===
The Mid-Atlantic Regional Spaceport, located at Wallops Island, Virginia, United States, is the launch site for the Northrop Grumman Cygnus spacecraft for resupplying the American portion of the ISS.

<text>The Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Performance by a Chorus was awarded in 1969 (as Best Contemporary Pop Performance, Chorus) and in 1970. In some years, the Grammy Award for Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal also included performances by a chorus.

A similar award for Best Performance by a Chorus was awarded from 1961 to 1968. This was also in the pop field, but did not specify pop music.

Years reflect the year in which the Grammy Awards were presented, for works released in the previous year.

<doc id="923781" wikidata="Q691203" url="?curid=923781" title="Grammy Award for Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals">
<text>The Grammy Award for Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals was an honor presented at the Grammy Awards, a ceremony that was established in 1958 and originally called the Gramophone Awards, to recording artists for quality pop songs on which singers collaborate. Awards in several categories are distributed annually by the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences of the United States to &quot;honor artistic achievement, technical proficiency and overall excellence in the recording industry, without regard to album sales or chart position.&quot;

The award for Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals was first presented to Al Green and Lyle Lovett at the 37th Grammy Awards (1995) for the song &quot;Funny How Time Slips Away&quot;. According to the category description guide for the 52nd Grammy Awards, the award was presented to artists that performed &quot;newly recorded collaborative pop performances&quot; that &quot;do not normally perform together.&quot;

In 1997, the father-daughter duo of Nat King Cole and Natalie Cole won the award for &quot;When I Fall in Love&quot;, a &quot;virtual duet&quot; remake of one of his signature hits, using a recording of his vocals more than 30 years after his death in 1965.

There have been five instances in which an artist was nominated for more than one song in the same year, with different collaborators. In 1998, Barbra Streisand received nominations for the songs &quot;I Finally Found Someone&quot; (with Bryan Adams) and &quot;Tell Him&quot; (with Celine Dion). Santana was nominated in 2000 for the songs &quot;Love of My Life&quot; (with Dave Matthews) and &quot;Smooth&quot; (with Rob Thomas). In 2002, Christina Aguilera was nominated for the songs &quot;Nobody Wants to Be Lonely&quot; (Ricky Martin) and &quot;Lady Marmalade&quot; (with Lil&#x27; Kim, Mýa and Pink). In 2005, Ray Charles earned nominations for the songs &quot;Sorry Seems to Be the Hardest Word&quot; (with Elton John) and &quot;Here We Go Again&quot; (with Norah Jones). In 2010, Colbie Caillat was nominated for the songs &quot;Breathe&quot; (with Taylor Swift) and &quot;Lucky&quot; (with Jason Mraz). Four of the five won the award with one of their two nominations (Santana&#x27;s &quot;Smooth&quot;; Aguilera&#x27;s &quot;Lady Marmalade&quot;; Charles&#x27;s &quot;Here We Go Again&quot;; and Caillat&#x27;s &quot;Lucky&quot;).

Two-time award recipients include Van Morrison, Pink, Santana, Alison Krauss, and Robert Plant. Krauss and Plant are the only duo to win more than once, as well as the only consecutive winners. Christina Aguilera and Stevie Wonder share the record for the most nominations, with six each.

The award was discontinued in 2012 in a major overhaul of Grammy categories. At that point, all duo or group performances in the pop category were shifted to the newly formed Best Pop Duo/Group Performance category. The 2011 award for a cover version of &quot;Imagine&quot; was the last one to be awarded in the Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals category.

<text>The European Movement International is a lobbying association that coordinates the efforts of associations and national councils with the goal of promoting European integration, and disseminating information about it.

==History==
The origins of the European Movement date to July 1947, when the cause of a united Europe was being promoted by Duncan Sandys in the form of the Anglo-French United European Movement (UEM). The UEM acted as a platform for the co-ordination of the organisations created in the wake of World War II. As a result of their efforts, the congress of The Committee for the Co-ordination of the European Movements took place in Paris on 17 July 1947 incorporating &quot;La Ligue Européenne de Coopération Economique&quot; (LECE), &quot;l&#x27;Union Européenne des Fédéralistes&quot; (UEF), &quot;l&#x27;Union Parlementaire Européenne&quot; (UPE) and the Anglo-French United European Movements. They met again on 10 November 1947 and changed their name to The Joint International Committee for European Unity. They retained this name until after the 1948 Congress of The Hague.

From 7 to 11 May 1948, 800 delegates from Europe and observers from Canada and the United States gathered in The Hague, the Netherlands for the Congress of Europe. Organised by the International Committee of the Movements for European Unity and presided over by Winston Churchill, the Congress discussed ideas about the development of the European Union. Politicians such as Konrad Adenauer, Winston Churchill, Harold Macmillan, Bertrand Russell, François Mitterrand, Paul-Henri Spaak, Albert Coppé and Altiero Spinelli took an active role in the congress and a call was launched for a political, economic and monetary Union of Europe. This conference had a profound influence on the shape of the European Movement, which was created soon afterwards.

The European Movement was formally created on 25 October 1948, when the Joint International Committee for European Unity decided to change its name. Duncan Sandys was elected President and Léon Blum, Winston Churchill, Alcide De Gasperi and Paul-Henri Spaak were elected as Honorary Presidents. The U.S. policy was to promote a United States of Europe, and to this end the American Committee on United Europe committee was used to discreetly funnel CIA funds to such organisations as this.

Initially the European Movement in the 1940s brought together &quot;federalists and European unionists&quot;. The federalists, organised mainly in the European Union of Federalists, sought &quot;an abatement of national sovereignty&quot; whilst the unionists aimed &quot;at creating an association of states as close as is compatible with the retention of national sovereign independence.&quot;

In May 1949, the European Movement played a significant role in encouraging ten European states to create the Council of Europe, and to begin work on drafting a charter of rights, which eventually became the European Convention on Human Rights. The European Movement was also responsible for the creation of the College of Europe in Bruges and the European Center of Culture in Geneva. One of its major functions during the 1950s through to the 1990s was the setting up of think-tanks and a network of discussion groups across Europe, in countries both democratic and Communist.

Since 1948, the European Movement has lobbied for further integration, on numerous subjects. It worked in favour of the direct election of the European Parliament by all European citizens, in favour of the Treaty on the European Union (the Maastricht Treaty) and also for a European Constitution.

===Presidents===
===Secretaries General===
==Activities==
The Movement&#x27;s various Councils and Associations, under the co-ordination of the European Movement International (EMI), work to influence European decision-makers - associations, governments, politicians, political parties, enterprises, trade unions and individual lobbyists - to promote European integration.

The EM also works as a study and information group operating through various projects and activities, and publishes information on European affairs and activities.

==Organisation==
The Movement&#x27;s central office, located at Place de Luxembourg in Brussels, is headed up by a President and six Vice-Presidents. Honorary Presidents, generally prominent European politicians, are also elected, but hold no executive powers.

The current President of the EMI is Guy Verhofstadt MEP. The management of the organisation is drawn from across Europe.

===International associations===
The EMI has several International Member Associations. These include civil society organisations, business and trade unions, NGOs, political parties, local authorities and academia.

===Supporting members===
* College of Europe
* Foundation Euractiv
* The Kosovar Civil Society Foundation - KCSF

===National Councils===
At national level there are National Councils in 39 countries, organized in a very diverse way. In principle national councils of all countries which are members of the Council of Europe can join the European Movement. Only on national level the EM has youth branches.

===Board===
Policy is formulated by a Board, the chairmanship of which is held by the President. A &#x27;Federal Assembly&#x27;, made up of delegates from all member organisations foments policies for the EMI and is in charge of the organisation&#x27;s Auditors. Several specialist committees, devoted to the discussion of individual policies exist as well. The current Political Committees are: More Democracy, Citizens&#x27; Rights and Freedom; Jobs, Competitiveness and Sustainable Growth; and Europe in the World. Day-to-day office-work is performed by the staff, which is led by a Secretary General, who since 2015 has been Petros Fassoulas.

Current members of the Board are:

President - Guy Verhofstadt; Secretary General - Petros Fassoulas; Vice-presidents - Brando Benifei, Yves Bertoncini, Tobias Köck, Noelle O&#x27;Connell, Valeria Ronzitti, Frédéric Vallier; Treasurer - Nataša Owens; Board members - Aku Aarva, Francisco Aldecoa Luzárranga, Antonio Argenziano, Veronika Chmelárová, Marco Cilento, Sina Frank, Monica Frassoni, Patrizia Heidegger, Olivier Hinnekens, Zvezdana Kovač, Roselyne Lefrançois, Richard Morris.

<text>The great storm of 1987 was a violent extratropical cyclone that occurred on the night of 15–16 October, with hurricane-force winds causing casualties in England, France, and the Channel Islands as a severe depression in the Bay of Biscay moved northeast. Among the most damaged areas were Greater London, Kent, the East Anglian coast, the Home Counties, the west of Brittany, and the Cotentin Peninsula of Normandy, all of which weathered gusts typically with a return period of 1 in 200 years.

Forests, parks, roads, and railways were strewn with fallen trees and schools were closed. The British National Grid suffered heavy damage, leaving thousands without power. At least 22 people were killed in England and France. The highest measured gust of was recorded at Pointe Du Roc, Granville, France and the highest gust in the UK of was recorded at Shoreham, West Sussex. The storm has been termed a weather bomb due to its rapid development.

That day&#x27;s weather reports had failed to indicate a storm of such severity, an earlier, correct forecast having been negated by later projections. The apparent suggestion by the BBC&#x27;s Michael Fish of a false alarm is celebrated as a classic gaffe, though he claims he was misquoted. As a result of this storm, major improvements were later implemented in atmospheric observation, relevant computer models, and the training of forecasters.

==Development==
On the Sunday before the storm struck, the farmers&#x27; forecast had predicted bad weather on the following Thursday or Friday, 15–16 October. By midweek, however, guidance from weather prediction models was somewhat equivocal. Instead of stormy weather over a considerable part of the UK, the models suggested that severe weather would reach no farther north than the English Channel and coastal parts of southern England.

During the afternoon of 15 October, winds were very light over most parts of the UK. The pressure gradient was slack. A depression was drifting slowly northwards over the North Sea off eastern Scotland. A trough lay over England, Wales, and Ireland. Over the Bay of Biscay, a depression was developing.

=== First warnings ===

The first gale warnings for sea areas in the English Channel were issued at 0630 UTC on 15 October and were followed, four hours later, by warnings of severe gales. At 1200 UTC on 15 October, the depression, which originated in the Bay of Biscay, was centred near 46° N, 9° W and its depth was . By 1800 UTC, it had moved north-east to about 47° N, 6° W, and deepened to .

At 2235 UTC, winds of Force 10 were forecast. By midnight, the depression was over the western English Channel, and its central pressure was . At 0140 on 16 October, warnings of Force 11 were issued. The depression now moved rapidly north-east, filling a little as it did, reaching the Humber Estuary at about 0530 UTC, by which time its central pressure was . Dramatic increases in temperature were associated with the passage of the storm&#x27;s warm front.

In some sea areas, warnings of severe weather were both timely and adequate, although forecasts for land areas left much to be desired.
During the evening of 15 October, radio and TV forecasts mentioned strong winds, but indicated that heavy rain would be the main feature, rather than wind. By the time most people went to bed, exceptionally strong winds had not been mentioned in national radio and TV weather broadcasts.

Warnings of severe weather had been issued, however, to various agencies and emergency authorities, including the London Fire Brigade. Perhaps the most important warning was issued by the Met Office to the Ministry of Defence (MoD) at 0135 UTC, 16 October. It warned that the anticipated consequences of the storm were such that civil authorities might need to call on assistance from the military.

===Winds===

A highest gust of is estimated from satellite data at Quimper, Brittany, with the highest measured gust at at Pointe du Roc, Granville, Normandy.

In south-east England, where the greatest damage occurred, gusts of or more were recorded continually for three or four consecutive hours.
During this time, the wind veered from southerly to south-westerly. To the north-west of this region, there were two maxima in gust speeds, separated by a period of lower wind speeds. During the first period, the wind direction was southerly. During the latter, it was south-westerly. Damage patterns in south-east England suggested that tornadoes accompanied the storm.

In the UK, winds at Shoreham-by-Sea, Sussex reached before the anemometer failed. Many anemometers were reliant on mains power, and ceased recording as the south east of the United Kingdom was blacked-out by power cuts, thus losing much valuable data.
Winds with an estimated 200-year return period hit the counties of Kent, Sussex, Berkshire, Hampshire, and along the coastal strip of Essex, Suffolk, and south-eastern Norfolk. North of a line from Portland Bill, Dorset to Cromer, Norfolk the return period of the respective gusts were under 10 years.

Sustained winds speeds greater than were recorded for over an hour in southern Britain. According to the Beaufort scale of wind intensities, this storm had winds of hurricane force 12 ( or greater); as the term &quot;hurricane&quot; refers to tropical cyclones originating in the North Atlantic or North Pacific, the descriptor &quot;great storm&quot; has tended to be reserved for those storms in recent years reaching this velocity. Hurricanes have a very different wind profile and distribution from storms, and significantly higher precipitation levels.

==Impact==

===England===
The storm made landfall in Cornwall, and tracked north-east towards Devon and then over the Midlands, going out to sea via The Wash. The strongest gusts, of up to , were recorded along the south-eastern edge of the storm, hitting mainly Berkshire, Hampshire, Sussex, Essex, and Kent. The Royal Sovereign lighthouse off Eastbourne recorded the highest hourly-mean wind speed in the UK on its instruments at . The counties of Dorset and Surrey were also heavily affected.

The storm caused substantial damage over much of England, felling an estimated 15 million trees (including six of the seven eponymous oaks in Sevenoaks, historic specimens in Kew Gardens, Wakehurst Place, Nymans Garden, Hyde Park in London, and Scotney Castle and most of the trees making up Chanctonbury Ring). At Bedgebury National Pinetum, Kent almost a quarter of the trees were brought down. There have been many claims that the damage to forestry was made worse by broadleaf trees still being in leaf at the time of the storm, though this was not borne out by an analysis by the Forestry Commission.

Fallen trees blocked roads and railways, and left widespread structural damage primarily to windows and roofs. More than 5,000 trees fell on railway tracks in the Southern Region, and the Midland and West Coast main lines were blocked. Beach huts were blown onto tracks at Leigh-on-Sea. The roofs and canopies at Limehouse and Benfleet stations were destroyed, and £300,000 of damage was caused to construction work on a new train ferry pier at Dover Western Docks station.

Several hundred thousand people were left without power, not fully restored until more than two weeks later. Local electric utility officials later said they lost more wires in the storm than in the preceding decade. At sea, as well as many small boats being wrecked, a Sealink cross-channel ferry, the MV &quot;Hengist&quot;, was driven ashore at Folkestone and the bulk carrier MV &quot;Sumnea&quot; capsized at Dover, Kent. The Radio Caroline ship MV &quot;Ross Revenge&quot; weathered the storm in the north sea, being one of the few ships to be in the North Sea during the storm; it being a radio ship, it also provided radio broadcasts to thousands while most stations were offline.

The National Grid sustained heavy damage during the event, as crashing cables short-circuited, which in some cases overheated the main system. Its headquarters faced the choice of keeping the grid online to help London as the storm approached but risk an incremental system breakdown, failure and burnout, or to shut down most of South East England including London and avert that risk. The headquarters made the decision, the first one like it since before World War II: to shut down the South East power systems to maintain the network as soon as signs of overheating began.

At Clayton, West Sussex, one of the village&#x27;s recently restored windmills, &quot;Jill&quot;, sustained severe damage to its mechanisms and caught fire during the storm. The mill&#x27;s brakes had been applied prior to the storm&#x27;s arrival, but the high winds were able to rotate the sails and overcome the brakes, creating friction which set the mill&#x27;s antique timbers on fire. Members of the Jack and Jill Windmills Society were able to put the fire out, carrying water up the hill to douse the flames.

In London, many of the trees lining streets, particularly plane trees, were blown down overnight, blocking roads and crushing parked cars. Building construction scaffolding and billboards collapsed in many places, and many buildings were damaged. The following morning, the BBC&#x27;s Current Affairs Production Centre at the former Lime Grove Studios in Shepherd&#x27;s Bush, was unable to function due to a power failure – ITV&#x27;s TV-am and BBC1&#x27;s &quot;Breakfast Time&quot; programmes were broadcast from different emergency facilities in emergency formats. TV-am broadcast from Thames Television&#x27;s Euston Road studios, while BBC newsreader Nicholas Witchell had to broadcast from the BBC1 continuity studio at BBC Television Centre, with the wall decorations used for Children&#x27;s BBC hastily taken down. Much of the public transport in the capital was not functioning, and people were advised against trying to go to work. TV-am host Anne Diamond did go back to the regular TV-am studio with reporter Kay Burley, whilst Richard Keys remained in the Thames Television studio in case the power supply situation became even worse, and indeed, power did go back down at around 8:15 am.

===France===
The départements of Finistère, Morbihan, Côtes-d&#x27;Armor, and Ille-et-Vilaine in Brittany, and the Cotentin Peninsula (Manche and part of Calvados) in Normandy were the areas in France most affected by the storm, which followed a line from Morbihan and Rennes to Deauville. 1.79 million homes were left without electricity supply and water, and a quarter of Brittany&#x27;s forest was destroyed. The total damage was estimated at ₣23 billion.

Météo France announced &quot;&quot; (a little storm coming in from the Azores), which reached Brittany&#x27;s coast at about 18:00, later than expected. This depression caused little damage, with only winds. A much deeper depression hit Ushant on the extreme western tip of Brittany at midnight. It was measured at at the Brest-Guipavas weather station, the lowest reading in its records dating back to 1945.

Weather stations on the coast at pointe du Raz, pointe Saint-Mathieu and Penmarch gave no readings, as they were damaged by the high winds. The wind speed measured at Brest was . The centre of the storm crossed Brittany from Penmarch to Saint-Brieuc at , with gusts of wind up to at Quimper, at Ushant, and at la pointe de Penmarch and Granville. Waves were measured at off Ushant and Belle Île.

Similar strength storms in France since 1960: 
*Tempête Vivian in 1990 (generally milder)
*Cyclones Lothar and Martin in December 1999, which claimed 140 lives, equally severe in Germany, more southern neighbouring countries also saw multiple deaths.
*Cyclone Klaus which struck worse southern France and northern Spain in 2009 and claimed 26 lives.

The church at Concarneau was damaged but never rebuilt, and was finally demolished a few years later.

The MS &quot;Herald of Free Enterprise&quot; was caught in the storm off Cape Finisterre as it was making its way for scrapping in Taiwan. The ship was cast adrift after its tow rope parted, finally resuming its journey on 19 October 1987.

==Aftermath==
The storm cost the insurance industry £2 billion, making it the second most expensive UK weather event on record to insurers after the Burns&#x27; Day Storm of 1990. Peak wind velocities were in the early hours of the morning, which may have helped reduce the death toll. 
The storm hit the Isle of Wight at 02:00. Shanklin Pier, a central landmark in the seaside resort of Shanklin on the south-east coast of the island, was broken into three pieces as a result of mountainous waves in Sandown Bay that struck the structure. Plans to rebuild the pier were soon abandoned as the company supervising the pier&#x27;s refurbishment prior to the storm went bankrupt, and the rest of the pier was demolished by contractors shortly afterwards. A monument now stands in front of what used to be the pier entrance.

A great deal of effort and money was put into the post-storm clean-up of forests and wooded areas. The writer Oliver Rackham and the charity Common Ground were active in trying to prevent unnecessary destruction of trees which, although fallen, were still living. Some landowners, such as the National Trust, did not attempt complete clearing and replanting, realising that there was a unique opportunity to study the patterns of natural regeneration after such an event.

A number of wild boar may have escaped from captivity during the storm, after enclosures were damaged by falling trees. These boar have since bred and established populations in woods across southern England.

A more positive aspect could be found among some British gardeners; as Heather Angel wrote in the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s &quot;Journal&quot;:
In some places this natural disaster has resulted in splendid vistas- views long since forgotten by some and never before seen by a whole new generation. Because of gaps left by fallen trees, visitors to Arundel Castle, the ancestral home of the Dukes of Norfolk, can now look out over the picturesque town... At the renowned woodland rhododendron garden at Leonardslee, Sussex, the gale... opened magnificent views by removing about a thousand trees which owner Robin Loder said he would never have had the courage to thin out himself.

===Criticism of the Met Office===
The Met Office was severely criticised by most of the national press for failing to forecast the storm correctly.

The Met Office conducted an internal inquiry, scrutinised by two independent assessors, and a number of recommendations were made. Chiefly, observational coverage of the atmosphere over the ocean to the south and west of the UK was improved by increasing the quality and quantity of observations from ships, aircraft, buoys and satellites. Continued refinements were made to the computer models used in forecasting, and changes were made in the training of forecasters. In addition, reforms in the way the Met Office reports warnings of severe weather were implemented, leading to substantially more warnings being issued in the future. Further deployment of improved tracking devices and improvements in the computer model simulations were supported by the purchase of an additional Cray supercomputer. Warnings for the Burns&#x27; Day Storm just over two years later were accurate and on time, although the model forecast hinged on observations from two ships in the Atlantic near the developing storm the day before it reached the UK.
BBC meteorologist Michael Fish drew particular criticism for reporting several hours before the storm hit: Earlier on today, apparently, a woman rang the BBC and said she heard there was a hurricane on the way; well, if you&#x27;re watching, don&#x27;t worry, there isn&#x27;t, but having said that, actually, the weather will become very windy, but most of the strong winds, incidentally, will be down over Spain and across into France.

Fish has subsequently claimed that his comments about a hurricane had nothing to do with the UK; they referred to Florida, USA, and were linked to a news story immediately preceding the weather bulletin, but had been so widely repeated out of context that the British public remains convinced that he was referring to the approaching storm. According to Fish, the woman in question was actually a colleague&#x27;s mother who was about to go on holiday in the Caribbean, and had called regarding Hurricane Floyd to see if it would be safe to travel. Fish went on to warn viewers that it would be &quot;very windy&quot; across the south of England, but predicted that the storm would move further south along the English Channel and the British mainland would escape the worst effects. The remainder of his warning has frequently been left out when this forecast has been repeated on television, which only adds to the public&#x27;s misconception of that day&#x27;s forecasting. His analysis has been defended by weather experts. In particular, the lack of a weather ship in the Southwest Approaches, due to Met Office cutbacks, meant the only manner of tracking the storm was by using satellite data, as automatic buoys had not been deployed at the time.

Ironically, earlier forecasts as far back as the preceding weekend had correctly identified that gale-force winds would affect Southern England. However, later runs of the model had indicated a more southerly track for the low pressure system, incorrectly indicating that the strongest winds would be confined to Northern and Central France. The French meteorological office used a different computer weather model to the British, and the French model proved more accurate in predicting the severity of the storm in the Channel.

The French meteorological service did correctly predict and warn for the storm and its intensity, but it might have been otherwise. Indeed, the ECMWF model forecast from 14 October 12 UTC failed to predict the strong winds and the storm position (although previous runs were closer to reality), and this could have led to inadequate warnings. This unusual inconsistency of ECMWF could have been a data assimilation issue, or came from poor data. In contrast, the French large scale model EMERAUDE made better predictions, while still underestimating the winds. It is recognised that without the experience of the forecasters, the exceptional aspects of the storm would have been missed.

In the wake of the storm, the Met Office set up the National Severe Weather Warning Service.

It has been said that as 15–16 October 1987 approached, shipping weather forecasts warned of storm movements in the North Atlantic, with the result that ships stayed away from North Atlantic storm tracks, depriving North Atlantic meteorology of a major necessary source of weather report data.

===New understandings===

Following the storm, meteorologists at the University of Reading led by Professor Keith Browning developed the sting jet concept. During reanalysis of the storm they identified a mesoscale flow where the most damaging winds were shown to be emanating from the evaporating tip of the hooked cloud head on the southern flank of the cyclone. This cloud, hooked like a scorpion&#x27;s tail, gives the wind region its name the &quot;sting jet&quot;.

===Climatological context===
It is sometimes claimed that this storm was the worst since the Great Storm of 1703, but this has been challenged as ignoring storms outside the south-east of England. Storms of this strength regularly form over the North Atlantic, where they typically track to the north of Scotland. Storms of such a strength have a return period of 30 to 40 years. The unusual aspect of the storm was that it struck the densely populated southeast of England. That winds in the South East had return periods of 1 in 200 years does not mean the winds of this strength occur once every 200 years, but that the winds have a 0.5% probability of happening in a given year.

Following this storm 1.3 million incidents of damage were reported, which is only exceeded by the Gale of January 1976 where destruction covered a wider area of the UK, with 1.5 million incidents of damage reported. The Burns&#x27; Day storm hit the United Kingdom in January 1990, less than three years later and with comparable intensity. The Great Storm of 1968 (Hurricane Low Q) had crossed Great Britain between the Pennines and Perthshire with the highest-ever recorded peak wind speeds (134 mph). At the time this was the strongest wind gust ever recorded in the United Kingdom, though this was superseded in 1986 when a 173 mph (278 km/h) gust was recorded at Cairn Gorm. The 1968 storm, for which no warning was given, devastated agriculture and 5% of forestry in Scotland, toppled shipbuilding cranes on the Clyde, and left almost 2000 people homeless in the Central Belt.

==Wider impacts==

===Black Monday===
Following the storm, few dealers made it to their desks, and stock market trading was suspended twice; the market closed early at 12:30. The disruption meant the City was unable to respond to the late trading at the beginning of the Wall Street fall-out on Friday 16 October, when the Dow Jones Industrial Average recorded its greatest-ever one-day slide at the time, a fall of 108.36. City traders and investors spent the weekend, 17–18 October, repairing damaged gardens in between trying to guess market reaction and assessing the damage. 19 October, Black Monday, was memorable as being the first business day of the London markets after the Great Storm.

<text>John L. Daly (31 March 1943 – 29 January 2004) was an Australian teacher and self-declared &quot;Greenhouse skeptic.&quot; He was known for speaking out publicly against what he called the &quot;Global Warming scare,&quot; and authored the book &quot;The greenhouse trap: Why the greenhouse effect will not end life on earth&quot;, published in 1989 by Bantam Books. After his death until 2008, his website, &quot;Still Waiting for Greenhouse&quot; was maintained by Jerry Brennan.

Daly investigated various studies by scientists which support global warming scenarios and raised objections to them. For example, he denied that the average sea level is rising, on the basis the &#x27;Isle of the Dead&#x27; mean ocean level benchmark.

== Beliefs ==

Daly argued that observed warming in the years leading up 2003 could be explained by the combination of a maximum in the sunspot cycle and two successive severe El Nino climatic cycles. As a result, he predicted:

:But it will pass. These things always do. The solar cycle is now heading down towards its expected solar minimum around 2006, while the current El Nino is expected to wane in the next few months, possibly being replaced by its cooling counterpart, La Nina.

:The greenhouse industry has thrived off Nature&#x27;s climatic drama of the last 4 years, using a combination of public hysteria and bent statistics, but the pickings will be leaner in the months and years ahead - until we reach the next El Nino or the next solar maximum expected around 2012 (the same year the Kyoto Protocol expires).

Fle3 is a Zope product, written in Python. Fle3 is open-source and free software released under the GNU General Public Licence (GPL).

==Origin of the name==

The abbreviation FLE comes from the words Future Learning Environment. The number 3 in the name refers to the number of times the software has been built from scratch.

==Components==

Fle3 provides various tab-accessed screens affording functionality considered important for progressive inquiry.

Fle3 WebTops the interface that scaffolds students&#x27; storing, organizing and sharing their own knowledge resources including documents, files, links and notes.

Fle3 Knowledge Building the interface that scaffolds students&#x27; knowledge building (and associated) discourse. Knowledge Building tool provides Knowledge Types to scaffold and structure the process.

Fle3 Jamming tool is the interface that scaffolds members of a group to collaboratively construct and improve digital artifacts such as pictures, text, audio and videos. Key features of this include the ability of a user to upload the artifact, assign sharing permission and finally the graphical representation of the versioning history of the artifact.

There are also interfaces that scaffold teachers and administrators to manage users and analyze student/project activity.

==Knowledge type sets==
An important feature of the Knowledge Building tool is the knowledge type sets that are scaffolding and structuring the discussions. For instance, for a progressive inquiry learning teachers may use knowledge type set designed for this purpose. Progressive Inquiry knowledge type set contains the following five knowledge types: &quot;Problem&quot;, &quot;My Explanation&quot;, &quot;Scientific Explanation&quot;, &quot;Evaluation of the Process&quot; and &quot;Summary&quot;. Every time a pupil is posting something to the discussion, she must choose what knowledge type her note represents.

The knowledge types guides pupils to think adequate and important things related to the process, and this way helps them to write more substantial notes to the discussion forum. As an aid for users to follow the knowledge building discourse, users may take different views to the knowledge building discussion by sorting the notes as a discussion thread, by writer, by knowledge type, or by date.

The Knowledge Building tool contains two default knowledge type sets: (1) Progressive Inquiry, and (2) Design Thinking. Depending on the selected knowledge types set, users get guidelines and a checklist on how to write their notes to the discussion forum. Each knowledge type is also color-coded making them fast to recognize and learn.

==History==
Development of Fle3 software was started in 1998 in a Future Learning Environment research and development project in Media Lab, Helsinki, Finland. Fle3 software is based on the Future Learning Environment concept promoting learning process, which differs from traditional teacher and didactic-based teaching by emphasising students active role in a learning process.

The objective was to study alternative approaches of using information and communication technologies (ICT) in teaching and learning, and to design alternative learning practices and tools. At that time, the strong e-learning movement was seen to promote rather naïve conception of human learning. The acquisition metaphor of learning, which emphasizes learning as a process where students are supplied with pieces of knowledge, was getting stronger.

The researchers of the FLE project brought to the discussion more advanced conceptions of learning, such as participation metaphor and knowledge creation metaphor . However, the objective of the FLE project was not only to bring new theoretical approaches to the discussion, but also to design learning practices and technology based on the theories. The results of this work culminated in the progressive inquiry learning model and in the Fle3 software.

The history of virtual learning environments shows how the e-learning and Learning Management Systems (LMS), with course-centred outlook and focus on delivery of learning content, was, and is probably still, the mainstream approach to use of ICT in education. Although in mid-2000 the growing popularity of blogs and wikis and the consideration how they could be used in teaching and learning has led the mainstream research and development community of virtual learning to re-consider the existing e-learning paradigms.

===Fle-Tools (1998–1999)===
In the late 1990s the research, development and design team members of the first FLE project were greatly influenced by the work of Carl Bereiter and Marlene Scardamalia, and their concept of Knowledge building. In the design of FLE software, Bereiter&#x27;s and Scardamalia&#x27;s Computer-Supported Intentional Learning Environment (CSILE) was used as a reference.

However, there are also many differences between the two software. For instance, already in the early design specifications of FLE there was the idea of shared artefacts that are collaboratively constructed alongside the knowledge building activities. In FLE vocabulary the activity, and the tool supporting it, is called “jamming”. Also the idea of archiving the results of the study work and to make them then available for other study groups makes FLE very different from the CSILE, which was primary designed to be a system used in a classroom. Another difference is related to the Web. From the very beginning FLE has been web-based system, and has taken in use all the advantages the flexible platform is offering, whereas the original CSILE was a client-server system.

The first prototype server with FLE software was set up in 1998 and announced in early 1999. The software was named to be Fle-Tools. The software was designed in Media Lab in Helsinki but programmed by a Finnish company called NSD Consulting Oy.

Fle-Tools was developed in a Future Learning Environment project funded by Tekes - the National Technology Agency of Finland. The project partners were Media Lab of the University of Art and Design Helsinki (coordinator), Centre for Research on Networked Learning and Knowledge Building in the Department of Psychology of the University of Helsinki, Finnish Ministry of Education, Finnish new media company Grey Interactive, Finnish teleoperator Sonera, and Finnish educational publisher SanomaWSOY.

Fle-Tools was described to be: (1) www-based service for computer supported collaborative learning (CSCL); (2) on-line learning community and teamwork environment; (3) collection of server-based applications and databases and (4) cross-platform for end users (www-browser in Linux, Mac, Win PC, WebTV, Nokia Communicator, etc.). The tools of Fle3-Tools were:

* WebTop: Personal open desk top in the web to store and share digital materials;
* Knowledge Building: Asynchronous conferencing system with &#x27;Categories of Inquiry&#x27; and different searching capabilities (by date, person, category of inquiry, users own notes, answers to own notes);
* Jam Session: Asynchronous multi-user environment for collaborative design, writing, software development, etc.;
* Library: Adaptive medium to publish and browse multimedia course materials
* Administration: Tools for administer users, groups, courses and course materials.

In 1999 Fle-Tools was tested in several university course at the University of Helsinki and the University of Art and Design Helsinki. The results form the pilots were published in scientific conferences and journals.

In the end of 1999, The Finnish operator Sonera, who was a key partner in the Future Learning Environment project, decided to draw back from the project and started to develop their own product based on Fle-Tools. This resulted as a breakdown of the original Future Learning Environment research and development project.

===Fle2 (1999–2001)===
 The next generation FLE software was developed during the years 1999–2001. Because of the collapse of the original Future Learning Environment project consortium in 1999 the research and design partners felt that they must continue the FLE development on their own.

In 2000 the Fle2 project got funding from the Nordic Council of Ministers NordUnet 2 program. The partners of the project were Media Lab in Helsinki, Department of Communication, Journalism and Computer Science of Roskilde University in Denmark, and Department of Psychology of the University of Helsinki.

The new software was named Fle2 and released online for free downloading in April 2001. Fle2 was based on the design of Fle-Tools, but this time the software development and programming was carried-out in Media Lab Helsinki. The Fle2 was built on top of the BSCW - Basic Support for Cooperative Work software developed by the Fraunhofer Society in Germany.

The tools of Fle2 were personal WebTops and Knowledge Building. Th Fle2 did not have Jam Session or Library tools of the earlier Fle-Tools. In the Fle2 WebTop there were two new features compared to the earlier Fle-Tools: (1) &quot;yellow notes&quot; made it possible to add notes to other people WebTops when visiting them, and (2) chat with whiteboard for chatting and drawing with other users online.

In 2002 the design and development team in Helsinki realized that BSCW was not the right platform for developing the FLE software. The main reason for giving up the development of Fle2 on top of the BSCW was the fact that BSCW was not an Open Source / Free Software.

===Fle3 (2002–2006)===
Fle3 is the third and the latest version of FLE software. The first version of Fle3 was released on February 15, 2002. The latest version 1.5 was released in April 2005.

Fle3 was largely developed in the Innovative Technology for Collaborative Learning and Knowledge Building (ITCOLE) project, funded by the European Commission in the Information Society Technologies (IST) framework&#x27;s &#x27;School of Tomorrow&#x27; program.

The ITCOLE project was coordinated by the Media Lab in Helsinki. The technical development partners included the developers of BSCW – Basic Support for Cooperative Work in Fraunhofer Society and Department of Computer Science of the University of Murcia in Spain. Testing of different software in schools was coordinated by Helsinki City Education Department and pedagogical research was carried out by researcher from University of Helsinki, University of Amsterdam, University of Salerno, University of Rome La Sapienza, University of Athens and University of Utrecht.

In the ITCOLE project there were several parallel software development projects. At first Fle3 was developed in Media Lab in Helsinki as a user interface and interaction demonstration for the main software development taking place in Fraunhofer and based on their BSCW system. The University of Murcia&#x27;s main task was to develop the synchronous communications tools, which were then integrated experimentally to BSCW and Fle3. The software based on BSCW was named at first Synergeia and later BSCL (Basic Support for Collaborative Learning).

During the course of the project Fle3 was found user friendly, accessible, and technically reliable for a wider use. This way it ended up to be not only a UI and interaction prototype but also software of its own. Finally Fle3 became one of the main results of the ITCOLE project.

There has been no noticeable development in the Fle3 project since 2006.

===Fle4 (2009–2015)===

The core component of FLE3, the scaffolded knowledge-building discussion board, was re-created as a simple plugin in WordPress
, the ubiquitous open source web server system. FLE4 was not intended to be a new system, but instead a re-implementation of the most important element of the previous system in a very user-friendly technology. Two sets of scaffolds are available in FLE4: Knowledge Building with its 5 knowledge types and de Bono&#x27;s Six Hat Thinking with its 6 knowledge types.

In 2013, a map view was added, providing an automatically generated 2D view of the discussion in which users can both view and post. While FLE4 is not under active development (2015), occasional updates and bug fixes are released.

<doc id="923807" wikidata="Q852564" url="?curid=923807" title="Bács-Bodrog County">
<text>Bács-Bodrog County (, , ) was an administrative county () of the Kingdom of Hungary from 1802 to 1920. Most of its territory is currently part of Serbia, while a smaller part belongs to Hungary. The capital of the county was Zombor (present-day Sombor).

==Name==

The county was named after two older counties: Bács and Bodrog. Bács county was named after the town of Bács (present-day Bač) and Bodrog county was named after the historical town of Bodrog (which was located near present-day Bački Monoštor), which itself was named after the Slavic tribe of Abodrites (or Bodrići in Slavic) that inhabited this area in the Middle Ages. The Abodrites were originally from northwest Germany, but after their homeland fell to the Germans, some had moved to Pannonia.

==Geography==

Bács-Bodrog county shared borders with several other counties of the Kingdom of Hungary: Baranya, Pest-Pilis-Solt-Kiskun, Csongrád, Torontál, Syrmia, and Virovitica (the latter two counties were part of the autonomous Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia). The river Danube formed its western and southern border. The river Tisza formed its eastern border, down to its confluence with the Danube. Its area was around 1910.

==History==

Bács county arose as one of the first counties of the medieval Kingdom of Hungary, in the 11th century. Bodrog county was also formed in the 11th century. The area was taken by the Ottoman Empire in the 16th century and the two counties were abolished. During the Ottoman administration, the area of the former counties was part of the Sanjak of Segedin. The Bács and Bodrog counties were established again after the Bácska region was captured by the Habsburg monarchy in 1699; later, the two counties were joined into a single county in 1802. Some (mostly eastern) parts of Bácska were incorporated into the Theiß-Marosch section of the Military Frontier. After this part of the Military Frontier was abolished in 1751, these parts of the Batschka were also included into Bács-Bodrog county. The only part of the Batschka region which remained within the Military Frontier was Šajkaška, but it too came under civil administration in 1873.
In 1848/1849, the area of the county was claimed by the self-proclaimed Serbian Voivodeship, while between 1849 and 1860 it was part of the Voivodeship of Serbia and Banat of Temeschwar, an official crown land of the Empire. During this time the county did not exist since the area was divided into districts. The county was recreated in 1860, when the Voivodeship of Serbia and Banat of Temeschwar was abolished and the area was again incorporated into the Habsburg Kingdom of Hungary.

By the Treaty of Trianon of 1920, the territory of the county was divided between the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes and Hungary. Most of the county (including Sombor, Subotica, and Novi Sad) was assigned to the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (renamed to Yugoslavia in 1929), while the northernmost part (approximately 15% of the county), including town of Baja, was assigned to Hungary.

===Aftermath===
Until 1922, the southern part of the former Bács-Bodrog county was a &quot;de facto&quot; province of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes with the seat in Novi Sad. The capital of the smaller Hungarian county of Bács-Bodrog was Baja.

The former Yugoslav part of the pre-1920 Bács-Bodrog county was occupied and annexed by Hungary in 1941 and Bács-Bodrog county was extended to its historic boundaries. After World War II, the border between Yugoslavia and Hungary was restored in 1947 by the Paris Peace Treaties and the county&#x27;s territory was reduced again. The Yugoslav part of the former Bács-Bodrog county was later divided into 3 districts and is currently part of the Serbian autonomous region of Vojvodina.

In 1950, Bács-Bodrog was united with the southern part of the former Pest-Pilis-Solt-Kiskun county to form the Bács-Kiskun county.

==Demographics==

During the 18th century, the Habsburgs carried out an intensive colonisation of the area, which had low population density after the last Ottoman wars. The new settlers were primarily Serbs, Hungarians, and Germans. Because many of the Germans came from Swabia, they were known as , or Danube Swabians. Some Germans also came from Austria, and some from Bavaria and Alsace. Lutheran Slovaks, Rusyns, and others were also colonized, but to a much smaller extent. According to the Austrian census from 1715, Serbs, Bunjevci, and Šokci comprised 97.6% of the county&#x27;s population.

The 1720 census recorded 104,569 citizens in the county. Of those, there were 98,000 Serbs (divided into 76,000 Orthodox and 22,000 Roman Catholics, or Bunjevci and Šokci), 5,019 Magyars and 750 Germans. The Serbs (73%) and Bunjevci and Šokci (21%) had an overwhelming majority in the county at that time.

There was also an emigration of Serbs from the eastern parts of the region, which belonged to Military Frontier until 1751. After the abolishment of the Theiß-Maros section of Military Frontier, many Serbs emigrated from north-eastern parts of Batschka. They moved either to Russia (notably to New Serbia and Slavo-Serbia) or to Banat, where the Military Frontier was still in place.

By 1820, the county had grown to 387,914 in total population. The Serb (including Croats, Bunjevci and Šokci) share had dropped to 44% or 170,942, with the number of Hungarians rising to 121,688 and Germans to 91,016, or 31% and 23%, respectively.



As for the geographical distribution of the four largest ethnic groups in 1910, Hungarians mainly lived in the northern parts of the county, Germans in the western parts, Croats (including Bunjevci and Šokci) around Szabadka and Serbs in the southern parts. The city of Újvidék in the southern part of the county was the cultural and political centre of the Serbs in the 18th and 19th centuries.

==Subdivisions==
In the early 20th century, the subdivisions of Bács-Bodrog county were:

The towns of Baja and Bácsalmás are now in Hungary; the other towns mentioned are now in Serbia.

=== Earlier subdivisions ===

In the early 19th century Bács-Bodrog County was divided into:
* or (&quot;upper district&quot;): the north-western part of the county, including Baja
* or (&quot;middle district&quot;): the western part, centred on Zombor (Sombor), which also included Apatin and Bezadán (Bezdan)
* or (&quot;lower district&quot;): the southern part, including Bács (Bač), Neoplanta (Uj-Vidék/Novi Sad/Neusatz) and Ó-Futak (Futog)
* or (&quot;Tisza district&quot;): the eastern part, including Maria Theresianopolis (Szabatka/Subotica), as well as Ó-Becse (Bečej), Temerin, Zenta (Senta) and Kis-/Magyar-Kanizsa (Kanjiža)
Šajkaška was part of the Military Frontier at this time.

<text>In the railway system of Great Britain, a train operating company (TOC) is a railway undertaking operating passenger trains under the collective National Rail brand. TOCs have existed since the privatisation of the network under the Railways Act 1993.

There are two types of TOC: most hold franchises let by the Department for Transport (DfT) through a tendering system, to operate services on certain routes for a specified duration, while a small number of open-access operators hold licences to provide supplementary services on chosen routes. These operators can run services for the duration of the licence validity. The franchised operators have changed considerably since privatisation: previous franchises have been divided, merged, re-let to new operators, or renamed. Some privately-operated franchises have been taken over by a government-owned operator of last resort, due either to failing expectations or to events on the rail system as a whole.

The term is also sometimes used to describe companies operating passenger or freight rail services over tracks owned by another company or a national network owner.

==Management==
Franchises were initially let by the Office of Passenger Rail Franchising (OPRAF). This was in turn replaced by the Strategic Rail Authority, which has since been abolished. For England, franchising is now the responsibility of the Department for Transport in the majority of cases. In Scotland, it is the responsibility of Transport Scotland. In Wales, since 2017, the responsibility for the specification and procurement of the Wales &amp; Borders franchise belongs to Transport for Wales. In two parts of England, local government agencies are responsible: in Merseyside, the Merseyside Passenger Transport Executive lets the Merseyrail franchise, while in London, Transport for London (TfL) oversees the new London Overground and Elizabeth line concessions. (London Underground, a wholly owned subsidiary of Transport for London, operates trains nearly all on its own network serving mostly its own stations: It is not a Train Operating Company by the definition here.)

The Rail Delivery Group (RDG) (formerly the Association of Train Operating Companies) provides a commonality for the TOCs and provides some centralised co-ordination. Its activities include the provision of a national timetable and online journey planner facility, and the operation of the various Railcard discount schemes. Eurostar is also a member of the RDG, though it is not itself a TOC.

==Organisation==
For historical and geographical reasons the railway network of the United Kingdom is split into two independent systems: one in Great Britain (including the Isle of Wight), and one in Northern Ireland, which is closely linked to the railway system of the Republic of Ireland.

=== Great Britain ===
In Great Britain, passenger train services are operated by a number of companies, referred to as &quot;Train Operating Companies&quot; or TOCs, normally on the basis of regional franchises awarded by the DfT Rail Group. Until 2005 this role was performed by the Strategic Rail Authority. The infrastructure of the railways in England, Scotland, and Wales – including tracks and signalling – is owned and operated not by the train companies but by Network Rail, which took over responsibility from Railtrack in 2002. Most passenger trains are owned by a small number of rolling stock companies (ROSCO) and are leased to the individual TOCs. However, a handful of TOCs own and maintain some of their own rolling stock. Train operating companies also operate most of the network&#x27;s stations, in their role as station facility owners (SFO), in which they lease the buildings and associated land from Network Rail. Network Rail manages some major railway stations and several stations are operated by London Underground or other companies.

Most passenger TOCs in Great Britain are privately owned. The majority of these hold franchises to operate rail services on specific parts of the railway and come under the auspices of the National Rail brand. In addition, companies are able to bid for &quot;paths&quot; (specific parts of the overall National Rail timetable) to operate their own services, which the franchises do not operate – these operators are classed as open-access operators and are not franchise holders. Currently in Great Britain, there are three open-access operators: Hull Trains, which runs services between London King&#x27;s Cross and Hull, Grand Central, which operates between King&#x27;s Cross and Sunderland and between King&#x27;s Cross and Bradford, and Lumo, which operates between King&#x27;s Cross and Edinburgh Waverley. In addition, there are operators that fall outside the purview of National Rail, which operate specific services which are recent additions to Britain&#x27;s railways. The main examples are Eurostar, which operates to continental Europe via the Channel Tunnel, and Heathrow Express, which runs fast services from London to Heathrow Airport.

A number of metropolitan railways on the network are operated by the local franchise holder in conjunction with the passenger transport executive or other civic body responsible for administering public transport. One of these bodies, the Merseyside Passenger Transport Executive (Merseytravel) is responsible for one of three National Rail franchises not awarded by central government, namely the Merseyrail franchise, while certain National Rail services in North London came under the control of TfL in November 2007 as London Overground. Two other franchises, the Scottish national franchise, currently operated by ScotRail, and the Welsh domestic franchise, operated by Transport for Wales, are awarded by the devolved governments of the two constituent nations.

The Rail Delivery Group is the coordinating body of the train operating companies in Great Britain and owns the National Rail brand, which uses the former British Rail double-arrow logo and organises the common ticketing structure. Many of the train operating companies are in fact parts of larger companies which operate multiple franchises.

===Current operators===
=== Northern Ireland ===
The railway network in Northern Ireland is managed differently from that of the rest of the UK. The sole company in Northern Ireland that operates trains is NI Railways, which is a subsidiary of Translink, the publicly owned transport corporation, which also runs the Metro buses in Belfast and Ulsterbus coaches around the country. NIR is not a TOC under the terms of the Railways Act 1993, which applies only to Great Britain. The cross-border service &quot;Enterprise&quot; (Belfast–Dublin) is jointly operated with Iarnród Éireann, the publicly owned national railway company of the Republic of Ireland.

==Changes==
Upon privatisation in 1994, the three passenger-operating sectors of British Rail (InterCity, Network SouthEast and Regional Railways) were divided, and their existing operations were let as 25 franchises:

===19901999===
====1994====
The privatisation process began when BR&#x27;s passenger sectors were divided into 25 train operating units which were gradually incorporated as publicly owned subsidiaries of the British Railways Board. They acted as shadow franchises prior to being put to tender:

;InterCity

;Network SouthEast

;Regional Railways

The opening of the Channel Tunnel saw operations by Eurostar begin from London Waterloo to Paris and Brussels.

====1996/97====
The franchising process was implemented, with various private companies taking over the shadow franchises. Three were awarded to management buyouts. The Great Western Holdings&#x27; management also were awarded the North West Regional Railways franchise. The remainder were divided between a handful of major transport operators:
In Northern Ireland, NIR stopped using its own branding on the &quot;Enterprise&quot; service between Belfast and Dublin when it purchased new rolling stock in conjunction with IÉ, instead launching Enterprise as a separate brand name.

====1998====
Great Western Holdings, which operated Great Western Trains and North West Trains, became a 100% FirstGroup subsidiary when the 24.5% shareholder bought out its partners. The TOCs were renamed First Great Western and First North Western.

Go-Ahead Group bought the remaining 35% share in Thames Trains.

Virgin Group sold a 49% share in Virgin Rail Group that operated the CrossCountry and West Coast franchises to Stagecoach.

The completion of the rail link to Heathrow Airport led to Heathrow Express, an open-access operator outside the franchising system, beginning its services from London Paddington to Heathrow with operating rights until 2023.

==== 1999 ====
The shareholdings of M40 Trains were restructured with John Laing owning 84% of the company with the remaining 16% held by former BR managers.

===20002009===
====2000====
MTL which operated Merseyrail Electrics and Northern Spirit and Prism Rail that operated c2c (renamed from LTS Rail earlier in the year), Valley Lines Trains, Wales &amp; West, and West Anglia Great Northern were purchased by Arriva and National Express respectively, resulting in the latter owning nine franchises. The two companies transferred to Arriva were renamed Arriva Trains Merseyside and Arriva Trains Northern.

The first open access operator using the National Rail brand, Hull Trains, commenced running its services between King&#x27;s Cross and Hull.

====2001====
In 2001, Connex, which had operated two franchises in the south-east of England, were replaced as the operator of the Network SouthCentral franchise by Govia, who began operating it under the name South Central.

Also in 2001, a new franchise, the Wales &amp; Borders franchise was created by the amalgamation of Valley Lines and the majority of services in Wales and the Borders held by Wales &amp; West. The new franchise was initially operated under the name Wales &amp; Borders. The remainder of Wales &amp; West&#x27;s services in the west of England were renamed Wessex Trains.

==== 2002 ====
John Laing bought out its partners in M40 Trains.

====2003====
Connex, having already lost the South Central franchise in 2001, was removed as franchisee of the South Eastern franchise in 2003 on the grounds of poor financial management. It was replaced as the franchise holder by South Eastern Trains, a company wholly owned by the Strategic Rail Authority, which would operate the franchise until it could be tendered again. New franchise holders Arriva Trains Wales and Merseyrail began operating. FirstGroup purchased GB Railways which owned the Anglia Railways and Hull Trains businesses.

====2004====
A policy where the majority of services (both long-distance and commuter) from each London terminal would all be operated by the same franchise was partially enacted. In April 2004, One commenced operating the Greater Anglia franchise that combined the Anglia Railways and First Great Eastern franchises with the West Anglia Great Northern services radiating out from Liverpool Street. The remainder continuing to be operated as WAGN.

In the North of England, prior to 2004 there were two regional franchises, the North East Regional franchise and the North West Regional franchise. In 2004, these were altered into the TransPennine franchise, for intercity services, and the Northern franchise, for local services that were awarded to First TransPennine Express and Northern Rail respectively. Some North West services were transferred to the Arriva Trains Wales franchise.

In the same year, Thames Trains was superseded by First Great Western Link and ScotRail (National Express) by First ScotRail.

====2005====
A new operator, Heathrow Connect, jointly run by BAA and First Great Western, began operating stopping services between London Paddington and Heathrow Airport complementing the Heathrow Express.

====2006====
Three new integrated franchises began operating in April 2006:
*First Capital Connect, began operating the Thameslink/Great Northern franchise, on the cross-London Thameslink route and suburban services from London King&#x27;s Cross and London Moorgate.
*First Great Western began operating the Greater Western franchise that combined express and local services from London Paddington to the West of England by amalgamating it with First Great Western Link and Wessex Trains.
*Southeastern commenced operating the Integrated Kent franchise taking over services from London Victoria, London Charing Cross, London Cannon Street and London Blackfriars to south-east London and Kent; responsibility for high speed domestic services operated on High Speed 1 from London St Pancras was included in the franchise.

====2007====
Further integrations occurred in 2007. The first of these was the South Western franchise; this merged the original South West Trains franchise with the Island Line Trains franchise on the Isle of Wight and began operating in February 2007 under the name South West Trains, with Island Line retained as a separate brand.

In November 2007, three new integrated franchises began operating:
*CrossCountry, took over from Virgin CrossCountry and parts of Central Trains, and operates regional inter-city services that bypass the major London terminals.
*East Midlands Trains replaced Midland Mainline and parts of Central Trains encompassing inter-city services from London St Pancras as well as local services in the East Midlands
*London Midland began operating the West Midlands franchise replaced Silverlink County and parts of Central Trains and operates stopping services between London Euston and Northampton, in addition to local services in the West Midlands

In addition to these three, a further new operator, London Overground Rail Operations, took control of the routes operated by Silverlink in London, which were combined with the extended East London line in 2011. Services are controlled directly by TfL, with running of the trains themselves contracted to a private company as an operating concession. This is different from an ordinary franchise, as the train operator is not given control of the strategic aspects of the operation, such as pricing, timetabling and rolling stock procurement.

In December 2007, National Express East Coast took over the running of the InterCity East Coast franchise from GNER. Grand Central also began operating its services between London and Sunderland as an open access operator.

====2008====
In January 2008, Laing Rail which owned M40 Trains and a 50% shareholding in London Overground Rail Operations was sold to Deutsche Bahn, becoming part of the DB Regio Group.

In February 2008, One was re-branded by National Express as National Express East Anglia to bring it into line with the East Coast franchise.

In April 2008, Wrexham &amp; Shropshire began operating open access services between Wrexham and London Marylebone.

In June 2008, the Gatwick Express franchise was integrated with the South Central franchise operated by Southern.

====2009====
The government announced that National Express East Coast would have its franchise to operate intercity services along the ECML terminated, and that the franchise would pass into the hands of public-sector company, Directly Operated Railways, which acted as the parent for East Coast.

===20102019===
====2010====
Grand Central open-access services from London to Bradford began on 23 May 2010.

====2011====
DB Regio&#x27;s operations in the UK were integrated into those of Arriva following the acquisition of the latter by Deutsche Bahn in the previous year.

Owing to continuing losses, Wrexham &amp; Shropshire ceased operating on 28 January 2011.

====2012====
Abellio Greater Anglia began operating the Greater Anglia franchise on 5 February 2012.

In September 2012, FirstGroup was awarded the right to operate the West Coast franchise which provoked a backlash from incumbent Virgin Trains West Coast. As a result of the Department for Transport having provided incorrect information during the bid process, the offer was withdrawn in October 2012 and £40 million of bid costs refunded.

====2014====
In September 2014, Govia Thameslink Railway took over services formerly operated by First Capital Connect as part of the Thameslink, Southern &amp; Great Northern franchise and branded them as Thameslink and Great Northern. Services operated by Southern, another Govia subsidiary, were merged into the new franchise in the following year.

Hull Trains became a 100% subsidiary of FirstGroup when the 80% shareholder bought out its partners.

====2015====
In March 2015, a Stagecoach and Virgin joint venture trading as Virgin Trains East Coast commenced operating the InterCity East Coast franchise.

In April 2015, the ScotRail franchise was split with the Caledonian Sleeper services becoming a stand-alone franchise operated by Serco while the remaining services remained as the Abellio ScotRail franchise.

In May 2015, a number of metro routes run by Abellio Greater Anglia from London Liverpool Street were transferred to TfL to run as a concession similar to both London Overground and Crossrail (under the name, TfL Rail). The routes transferred were those to , , , , and .

====2016====
In April 2016, FirstGroup trading as TransPennine Express commenced operating the TransPennine Express in its own right, previously having done so in a joint venture with Keolis. On the same date, Arriva Rail North commenced operating the Northern franchise.

In November 2016, Arriva Rail London took over the London Overground concession from London Overground Rail Operations.

====2017====
In February 2017, National Express sold its subsidiary c2c to Trenitalia.

In March 2017, Abellio sold a 40% share in Abellio Greater Anglia to Mitsui.

In August 2017, a FirstGroup/MTR joint venture trading as South Western Railway commenced operating the South Western franchise.

In December 2017, an Abellio, East Japan Railway Company and Mitsui joint venture trading as West Midlands Trains commenced operating the West Midlands franchise.

====2018====
In May 2018, the Government announced that Virgin Trains East Coast&#x27;s contract would be terminated early due to financial difficulties. In June 2018, the company was replaced by the government-owned operator of last resort London North Eastern Railway.

In May 2018, TfL Rail took over the Heathrow Connect services, which led to the introduction of Oyster and Contactless payment to Heathrow Airport for the first time on National Rail.

In October 2018, Transport for Wales took over the Wales &amp; Borders franchise from Arriva Trains Wales.

====2019====
In August 2019, East Midlands Railway took over the East Midlands franchise from East Midlands Trains.

In December 2019, Avanti West Coast began operating the new West Coast Partnership replacing Virgin Trains West Coast.

===2020 onwards===
====2020====
On 1 March 2020, operation of the Northern franchise transferred from Arriva Rail North to the UK government-owned Northern Trains.

Because the COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom caused passenger numbers to reduce to near zero, the UK government took emergency action to support train operating companies by assuming their financial risks. The companies were not allowed to make timetable or staffing changes without government approval. The Office for National Statistics reclassified the companies as public non-financial corporations so borrowing and employees are counted in the public-sector. They were viewed as effectively temporarily renationalised.

====2021====
On 7 February 2021, the day-to-day operations of the Wales &amp; Borders franchise were transferred to the Welsh-government-owned operator of last resort, Transport for Wales Rail, a subsidiary of Transport for Wales.

On 17 October 2021, the South Eastern franchise was taken over from London &amp; South Eastern Railway by government-owned operator of last resort Southeastern.

On 25 October 2021, Lumo commenced operating open-access services on the East Coast Main Line between London King&#x27;s Cross and Edinburgh.

====2022====
On 1 April 2022, ScotRail, owned by Scottish Rail Holdings for the Scottish Government, commenced operating the ScotRail franchise.

On 24 May 2022, TfL Rail, operated by MTR, was rebranded as Elizabeth line, following the opening of the core section between Paddington and .

In December 2022, Grand Union, an open access operator, was authorised by the Office of Rail and Road to operate trains between London Paddington and starting in December 2024.

====2023====
On 28 May 2023, after months of continued cancellations and service disruptions, FirstGroup&#x27;s TransPennine Express contract was not renewed. DfT OLR Holdings&#x27;s TransPennine Express took over the service.

On 25 June 2023, Scottish Rail Holdings took over the Caledonian Sleeper service from Serco.

====2024====
On 3 December 2024, after the Starmer government passed legislation to re-nationalise passenger rail in Great Britain, the government announced that the South Western rail area would be taken back into public ownership following the expiry of South Western Railway&#x27;s contract in May 2025. The South Western area will be the first area to be re-nationalised.

==Railtours==

The privatisation of British Rail allowed the introduction of open-access operators, in which companies, upon payment of a fee, could purchase individual slots on the mainline. This has led to the growth in companies offering charter trains, and to the railtour. Most railtour operators run services in part of the country; however, there are a handful that operate services nationwide. Usually, these will see a train made up of ex BR rolling stock pulled by a hired locomotive from one of the freight companies. Occasionally, a preserved ex BR locomotive that is certified to run on the mainline will be made available for such charters.

==Sea links==
A number of coastal railway stations in the United Kingdom serve to provide connections to ferry services to a number of destinations. 

Most of the ferry operators in these cases set their timetable to run in conjunction with the arrivals and departures of rail services from the stations serving the ferry terminals. 

A handful of these even offer integrated pricing for both rail and ferry travel – because the Island Line is part of the National Rail network, passengers can purchase tickets for travel to any of the stations on the Isle of Wight from any other station in Great Britain. This ticket also covers the cost of passage on the Wightlink catamaran from Portsmouth Harbour to Ryde Pier Head. It is also possible to purchase ferry inclusive tickets from any station in Great Britain to Cowes or East Cowes on the Isle of Wight using Red Funnel ferries, although there are no rail connections from these towns. 

==International operators==
There are two main international services which operate on the railways in the United Kingdom:
*Eurostar – runs between London St Pancras, Paris Gare du Nord, Bruxelles Gare du Midi/Brussel Zuidstation / Brussels South and Amsterdam Centraal through the Channel Tunnel.
*Enterprise – operates on the Irish network between Belfast Grand Central and Dublin Connolly.

A third service which is worth mentioning is Dutchflyer (GoLondon in the Netherlands). This is not a separate rail service in itself as the others are, but a collaboration between Greater Anglia, Stena Line and Nederlandse Spoorwegen to provide an integrated rail/sea/rail service between eastern England (London Liverpool Street, Cambridge, Norwich) and The Netherlands (Amsterdam Centraal) using a single ticket.

A further international service is provided by Venice Simplon Orient Express. Although this is primarily a railtour operator with special trains to various locations in the United Kingdom, it also operates the scheduled Orient Express service to destinations in Europe. This involves two separate trains; the &quot;Belmond British Pullman&quot; departs from London Victoria and terminates at Folkestone West, where passengers transfer by coach through the Channel Tunnel to Calais; at Gare de Calais-Ville, they then join the &quot;Orient Express&quot; which then calls at various destinations including Paris, Vienna, Innsbruck, Venice and Rome.

== In other countries ==
The differentiation between train operating companies and railway infrastructure companies was enforced by European Union legislation and can be found in all EU member countries.

In Germany, train operating companies (&quot;Eisenbahnverkehrsunternehmen&quot; – EVU) are defined by General Railways Act 1993, s. 2(1) (Allgemeines Eisenbahngesetz (AEG), enacted 27 December 1993) as companies providing train services. They are distinct from &quot;Eisenbahninfrastrukturunternehmen&quot; (EIU), which own and maintain the railway infrastructure. While there are many private EVU, that have obtained regional franchises, only a handful of long-distance EVU exist (the largest by fare being DB Fernverkehr); the infrastructure is also almost completely owned by Deutsche Bahn subsidiaries.

<text>Brandon Richard Flowers (born June 21, 1981) is an American musician. He serves as the co-founder, lead vocalist, primary songwriter, keyboardist, and occasional bassist of the Las Vegas-based rock band the Killers, which he formed with Dave Keuning in 2001.

In addition to his work with the Killers, Flowers has released two solo albums, &quot;Flamingo&quot; (2010) and &quot;The Desired Effect&quot; (2015). He has reached number one on the UK Albums Chart ten times, and on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 once (top ten, eight times), including work with the Killers.

== Early life ==
Brandon Richard Flowers, the youngest of six children, was born on June 21, 1981, in the Las Vegas suburb of Henderson, Nevada, to Jean Yvonne (née Barlow; 1945–2010) and Terry Austin Flowers. He has an older brother and four older sisters. His parents met as teenagers, and he wrote the song &quot;A Dustland Fairytale&quot; as a tribute to their marriage and lifelong romance. His grandmother was from Lithuania, and his cousin is Craig Barlow, an inductee to the Las Vegas Golf Hall of Fame.

Flowers&#x27;s family lived in Henderson until Flowers was eight, when they moved to Payson, Utah, for two years before moving to Nephi, Utah, when he was in the sixth grade. Flowers lived in Nephi until his junior year at Juab High School, when in 1997, at 16, he moved back to Las Vegas to live with his aunt. He graduated from Chaparral High School in 1999.

Flowers said that growing up in Las Vegas as a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) helped prepare him for the world of rock and roll: &quot;Really, being a Mormon in Las Vegas prepared me for the lion&#x27;s den. It is Sin City. The things that go on, the lights, it&#x27;s the ultimate rock and roll stage. Without Las Vegas, I would be a wreck.&quot;

== Career ==
=== The Killers (2001–present) ===

Flowers responded to an ad that Dave Keuning had placed in the &quot;Las Vegas Weekly&quot; in late 2001, whereupon they became the Killers. After several short-lived bassists and drummers, Flowers and Keuning were joined by bassist Mark Stoermer and drummer Ronnie Vannucci, and the line-up became official in August 2002. Between 2003 and 2017, they released five consecutive chart-topping studio albums and have sold over 22 million records worldwide. The Killers are among those artists who have spent more than 1,000 weeks on the UK music charts during their career. Flowers wrote the lyrics to the single &quot;All These Things That I&#x27;ve Done&quot; that numbered among the &quot;100 Greatest Songs of All Time&quot; by &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; and earned one of the band&#x27;s seven Grammy nominations. He is also the author of the lyrics of &quot;Mr. Brightside,&quot; which is the third biggest selling/streaming song of all time in the United Kingdom and also holds the record for most weeks spent on the UK Singles Chart, at over 408 weeks. Their second album &quot;Sam&#x27;s Town&quot;, paid homage to Flowers&#x27; hometown and family, and earned the band their first BRIT Awards (Best International Album and Group), and included the chart-topping single &quot;When You Were Young&quot;. Before releasing their first &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 No.1 album &quot;Wonderful Wonderful&quot; (2017) and chart topping single &quot;The Man&quot;, the band took a one-year hiatus during which Flowers released his second and most favorably reviewed solo album to that date.

On July 4, 2010, the Killers headlined the &quot;Salute to the Military&quot; USO Concert at the White House. They performed &quot;God Bless America&quot; and favorites from their catalogue. On June 22, 2013, the Killers headlined the 90,000-capacity Wembley Stadium, their biggest solo show to date.

=== Solo career (2010–present) ===
==== &quot;Flamingo&quot; (2010–11) ====

Flowers debuted his solo act at the Shimmer Showroom in Las Vegas on August 15, 2010. &quot;Spin&quot; named it one of the &quot;15 Best Shows of the Summer&quot; before listing the Flamingo Road Tour as one of the &quot;25 Best Fall Tours&quot;/&quot;Must-See Fall Tours&quot;.

Flowers&#x27; debut solo album, &quot;Flamingo&quot;, was released worldwide and charted in the top ten albums in ten countries including the UK where it charted at number one. The album drew heavy influence from Flowers&#x27; hometown of Las Vegas, Nevada, and earned Flowers a Q Award nomination for Best Male Artist (2010). The first single from &quot;Flamingo&quot;, &quot;Crossfire&quot;, was released on June 21. It became Flowers&#x27; first top ten single in the UK as a solo artist and was certified silver by the BPI. The video for &quot;Crossfire&quot; featured actress Charlize Theron and was nominated for Best Video at the NME Awards. &quot;Flamingo&quot; was Flowers&#x27; fourth consecutive studio album to reach no. 1 on the UK charts, including work by the Killers, who subsequently earned another two consecutive UK No. 1&#x27;s.

==== &quot;The Desired Effect&quot; (2015) ====

After some of the band members wanted &quot;to take a break from touring and the rat race,&quot; Flowers decided to keep it going and record a second solo album. &quot;The Desired Effect&quot; was released on May 15, 2015. The album debuted at number one on the UK Albums Chart, making it Flowers&#x27; second consecutive solo number one album. Flowers stated that the album was &quot;definitely going to be different&quot; from his last album, and he referred to producer Ariel Rechtshaid (Vampire Weekend, Haim, Taylor Swift) as his &quot;co-captain&quot;. The album featured performances by artists including Bruce Hornsby, Tony Levin (Peter Gabriel), Joey Waronker (Beck), Carlos Alomar (David Bowie), and Kenny Aronoff (John Mellencamp). &quot;The Desired Effect&quot; is Flowers&#x27; highest yet ranked album on Metacritic and honored as the Album of the Year (2015) by &quot;The San Francisco Examiner&quot;. Reviews positively described the album as Flowers&#x27; finest work since &quot;Hot Fuss&quot;. The album was preceded by positively reviewed singles &quot;Can&#x27;t Deny My Love&quot;, &quot;Still Want You&quot;, &quot;Lonely Town&quot;, and &quot;I Can Change&quot;. Multiple tracks from the album were listed on Best Songs of 2015 So Far lists by publications including SPIN, NPR, and Mashable. Halfway through 2015, &quot;USA Today&quot; listed the album as one of the top five best albums of 2015 so far.

The Desired Effect Tour included performances in Europe and North America; it ran through October 1, 2015. MTV rated Flowers&#x27; tour stop at London&#x27;s Brixton Academy five stars. Flowers performed for President Barack Obama in 2015 at the National Clean Energy Summit. Flowers also performed at the Royal Variety Performance (2015) at Royal Albert Hall for members of the British Royal Family.

Flowers was one of two favorite artists asked to perform &quot;Be Still&quot; and &quot;Home Means Nevada&quot; at the funeral of former U.S. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid on January 8, 2022. As of December 2023, Brandon Flowers is working on a new solo album.

=== Collaborations ===
In addition to his work with the Killers, Flowers has collaborated with Alex Cameron, Avicii, New Order, and Robbie Williams.

In 2023, he performed alongside Elton John at the Glastonbury Festival wearing a red suit, black shoes with a pale blue shirt.

== Personal life ==

Flowers married Tana Mundkowsky in 2005 and lives in Las Vegas, Nevada, and Park City, Utah. He wrote the song &quot;Some Kind of Love&quot; for his wife who suffers from PTSD. He and his wife have three sons, born in 2007, 2009, and 2011. Their sons attended their first Killers concert in July 2017, at London&#x27;s Hyde Park.

Flowers is a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. In 2012, he discussed his religion on Scandinavian television show &quot;Skavlan&quot;, where he debated Richard Dawkins on the subject. He and his family are featured in a promotional video on the church&#x27;s website.

His portrait was painted by British artist Joe Simpson for his &quot;Musician Portraits&quot; series that was exhibited at the Royal Albert Hall in 2012.

== Philanthropy ==
From 2006 to 2016, the Killers released annual Christmas-themed singles and videos in aid of the charity Product Red, supporting The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. The singles later formed the charity compilation album &quot;Don&#x27;t Waste Your Wishes&quot; (2016). Sir Elton John listed Flowers as one of his top five heroes while editing &quot;The Independent&quot; World Aids Day special edition. The Killers have also contributed songs for cover albums with proceeds going to charities supporting natural disaster relief (&quot;Rhythms del Mundo Classics&quot;) and famine-stricken areas (&quot;AHK-toong BAY-bi Covered&quot;). The Killers co-organized a benefit concert in December 2017 for those affected by the 2017 Las Vegas shooting, raising more than $700,000.

== Artistry ==
=== Influences ===
Flowers has listed Bruce Springsteen, Oingo Boingo, Duran Duran, Pet Shop Boys, the Smiths, the Cars, and Depeche Mode among his musical influences.

===Musical style and vocals===
Flowers is regarded as a prominent frontman of the new wave revival in the 2000s. As a solo artist, Flowers first exhibited elements of heartland rock as well as new-wave-style alternative rock. On his second album, Flowers exhibited greater pop tendencies, prompting &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; to dub &quot;The Desired Effect&quot; &quot;the best straight-up pop album made by a rock star in recent memory.&quot; Flowers is a tenor.

U2&#x27;s lead singer Bono praised Flowers&#x27; voice to &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; in 2015, saying &quot;We need him on the radio ... His voice!&quot;

<doc id="923814" wikidata="Q1027891" url="?curid=923814" title="Grammy Award for Best Pop Vocal Album">
<text>The Grammy Award for Best Pop Vocal Album is an honor presented at the Grammy Awards, a ceremony that was established in 1958 and originally called the Gramophone Awards, to recording artists for quality vocal pop music albums. Awards in several categories are distributed annually by the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences of the United States to &quot;honor artistic achievement, technical proficiency and overall excellence in the recording industry, without regard to album sales or chart position.&quot;

The honor was first presented in 1968 at the 10th Grammy Awards as Best Contemporary Album to The Beatles for &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot;. The category was then discontinued until 1995 where it emerged with the new name Best Pop Album. In 2001, the category became known as Best Pop Vocal Album. According to the category description guide for the 52nd Grammy Awards, the award is presented to artists that perform &quot;albums containing at least 51% playing time of newly recorded pop vocal tracks.&quot;

Until 2000, the award was given to the performing artist. Since 2001, the Grammy has also been awarded to the producer and engineer/mixer, provided they worked on more than 50% of playing time on the album. A producer or engineer/mixer who worked on &quot;less&quot; than 50% of playing time, as well as other personnel (e.g. the mastering engineer) do not win an award, but can apply for a Winners Certificate.

Adele, Kelly Clarkson and Taylor Swift are the only two-time winners of this award, and Clarkson was the first to win twice. Clarkson, Swift, and Ariana Grande lead all performers with six nominations.

<doc id="923831" wikidata="Q3136717" url="?curid=923831" title="History of Goa">
<text>The present-day state of Goa was established in 1987. Goa is India&#x27;s smallest state by area. It shares a lot of similarities with Indian history, especially with regard to colonial influences and a multi-cultural aesthetic.

The Usgalimal rock engravings, belonging to the Upper Paleolithic or Mesolithic periods, exhibit some of the earliest traces of human settlement in India. The Mauryan and Satavahana Empires ruled modern-day Goa during the Iron Age.

During the medieval period, Goa was ruled by the Kadamba kingdom, Vijayanagara Empire, Bahmani Sultanate and Bijapur Sultanate. 

It was ruled by the Kadamba dynasty from the 2nd century CE to 1312 and by the Deccan from 1312 to 1367. The city was then annexed by the Kingdom of Vijayanagara and was later conquered by the Bahmanī sultanate, which founded Old Goa on the island in 1440.

The Portuguese invaded Goa in 1510, defeated the Bijapur Sultanate. The Portuguese rule lasted for about 450 years, and heavily influenced Goan culture, cuisine, and architecture.

In 1961, India took control over Goa after a 36-hour battle and integrated it into India. The area of Goa was incorporated into Goa, Daman and Diu, which included the Damaon territory in the north of the Konkan region. In 1987, following the Konkani language agitation Goa was granted statehood. Goa has one of the highest GDP per capita and Human Development Index among Indian states.

== Earliest history ==
There is evidence of the tectonic origins of Goa dating back to 10,000 BC. Further, evidence of human occupation of Goa dates back at least to the Lower Paleolithic Age, indicated by the archaeological findings of Acheulean bifaces in the Mandovi-Zuari basin. However, evidence suggesting the region&#x27;s ancient foundation is obscured by the legend of Goa&#x27;s creation by the Hindu sage Parashurama.

=== Geological origins ===
Some parts of present-day Goa appear to have been uplifted from the sea due to geological tectonic plate movement. There is evidence to support this theory as indicated by the presence of marine fossils, buried seashells, and other features of reclaimed topography in the coastal belt. fossilized branches have been found later in many villages on the foothills of the Sahyadri dating back more than 10,000 BC. Thus the geologists concluded that Goa has risen from the seabed as a result of violent tectonic movements. At the decline of the intensity of &quot;population&quot; in the last &quot;Pleistocene age&quot; around 10000 BC, the bottom of Deccan plateau was lifted up and out of sea-waters by the tectonic movements, formed the West-coast of India, Goa being a part thereof.

==Prehistory==

===Paleolithic and Mesolithic era===
Until 1993 the existence of humans in Goa during the Paleolithic and Mesolithic period was highly debated. The discovery of rock art engravings on lateritic platforms and granite boulders from &quot;Usgalimal&quot; on the banks of west-flowing river Kushavati River, has shed light on the prehistory of Goa. The rock shelter at Usgalimal has enough space for 25 to 30 people. The perennial stream in the vicinity which might have served Stone Age man for centuries as a source of water. An anthropomorphic figure of Mother goddess and tectiforms resembling tree-like motifs have been found. This site was discovered by Dr P.P.Shirodkar. Exploration of several Mesolithic sites of the Mandovi-Zuari basin, at other sites such as Keri, Thane, Anjuna, &quot;Mauxim&quot;, &quot;Kazur&quot; in Quepem, &quot;Virdi&quot;, has led to the discovery of several scrapers, points, bores, cones, etc. A hand axe has also been found at Usgalimal. Further &quot;unifacial&quot; choppers were recovered on a flat-based pebble of quartzite from a pebble conglomerate at &quot;Shigaon&quot; on the Dudhsagar River. Shirodakar made a detailed study of the rock engravings and dated them to Upper Paleolithic and Mesolithic phases, or to 20,000-30,000 BC. These discoveries have demonstrated that the region had been supporting a population of hunter-gatherers well before the advent of agriculture.
Evidence of Palaeolithic cave existence can be seen at Dabolim, Adkon, Shigaon, Fatorpa, Arli, Maulinguinim, Diwar, Sanguem, Pilerne, Aquem-Margaon et cetera. Difficulty in carbon dating the laterite rock compounds has posed a problem in determining the exact time period.
====Kushavati Shamanic culture====
The prehistoric engravings at Usgalimal were discovered by PP Shirodkar in the early 1990s and subsequently studied by the Institute of Oceanography in Goa. More than 125 forms were found scattered on the banks of river Kushavati in south-eastern Goa. According to Kamat, these are evidence of a prehistoric Goan shamanistic practice. For hundreds of years, the Kushavati rock art of Goa was known locally as &quot;goravarakhnyachi chitram,&quot; or pictures made by cowherds. But people did not know how ancient the works were, nor could anyone interpret them. After thorough study of these forms, scholars have concluded that these petroglyphs differ from those found elsewhere in Goa. Deeper studies and analysis over a period of ten years showed these petroglyphs were an exquisitely carved &quot;ocular labyrinth&quot;, one of the best in India and Asia. Its ocular nature added to the evidence of prehistoric shamanism.

The studies have shown that the Kushavati culture was a hunter-gatherer culture with deep knowledge of local natural resources and processes – water, fish, plants, game, animal breeding cycles, seasons and natural calamities. The Kushavati culture was greatly concerned with water security, so they set up camps near the streams. The Kushavati found food security in the jungle near the streams. Like every culture, its members confronted the mysteries of illness, death and birth. Kamat believes that this culture dated to 6,000 to 8,000 years ago. On basis of recent DNA-based work on human migration, Dr. Nandkumar Kamat has ruled out the possibility of Kushavati shamans belonging to the first wave of humans to arrive in Goa. They were not negritoes or austrics. Most probably they were the earliest Mediterraneans who had descended the Western Ghats, probably in their search for sea salt on Goa&#x27;s coast. As the Kushavati transitioned into a Neolithic society, they began the domestication of animals and were in the last phase of using stone tools. The entire realm of shamanism underwent a radical transition. Today evidence of the metamorphosis in masked dance drama &quot;Perni jagor&quot; can be seen in the same cultural region.

===Neolithic period===
Archaeological evidence in the form of polished stone axes, suggest the first settlements of Neolithic man in Goa. These axes have been found in Goa Velha. During this period tribes of Austric origin such as the &quot;Kols&quot;, &quot;Mundaris&quot; and &quot;Kharvis&quot; may have settled Goa, living on hunting, fishing and a primitive form of agriculture since 3500 BC. According to Goan historian Anant Ramakrishna Dhume, the Gauda and Kunbi and other such castes are modern descendants of ancient Mundari tribes. Dhume notes several words of Mundari origin in the Konkani language. He describes the deities worshipped by the ancient tribes, their customs, methods of farming, and its overall effect on modern-day Goan culture. The Negroids were in a Neolithic stage of primitive culture and were food-gatherers. Traces of Negroid physical characteristics can be found in parts of Goa, up to at least the middle of the first millennium.

The Proto-Australoid tribe known as the &quot;Konkas&quot;, from whom is derived the name of the region, &quot;Kongvan or Konkan,&quot; with the other mentioned tribes, reportedly made up the earliest settlers in the territory. Agriculture had not fully developed at this stage and was being developed. The Kol and Mundari may have been using stone and wood implements, as iron implements were used by the megalithic tribes as late as 1200 BC. The Kol tribe is believed to have migrated from Gujarat.

During this period, the people began worship of a mother goddess in the form of anthill or &quot;Santer&quot;. The Anthill is called &quot;Roen&quot;(Konkani:रोयण), which is derived from the Austric word &quot;Rono,&quot; meaning with holes. The later Indo-Aryan and Dravidian settlers also adopted anthill worship, which was translated into Prakrit &quot;Santara&quot;. They also worshipped the mother earth by the name of &quot;Bhumika&quot; in Prakrit. Anthill worship still continues in Goa.

== Iron Age (from 16th century BCE) ==
===The Formations of Gaumkaris and the self rule===
The theocratic democracy of Sumer was transformed into the oligarchic democracy of village-administration in Goa known as &quot;Gaumkari&quot;, when it overlapped with the practices of the locals. The agricultural land was jointly owned by the group of villagers, they had right to auction the land, this rent was used for development, and the remainder was distributed amongst the &quot;Gaukars&quot;. Sumerians view that the village land must belong to the village god or goddess, this was the main feature of the &quot;Gaumkari&quot; system where the village&#x27;s preeminent deity&#x27;s temple was the centre of all the activities. It consisted of definite boundaries of land from village to village with its topographic detail, its management and social, religious and cultural interaction. Gaumkari thus were in existence long before constitution of the state of Goa itself.

Thus even before any king ruled the territory, oligarchic democracy in the form of Gaumkari existed in Goa. This form of village-administration was called as &quot;Gaumponn&quot; (Konkani:गांवपण), and despite the periodic change of sovereigns, the Gaumponn always remained, hence the attachment and fidelity of the Goans to their village has always surpassed their loyalty to their rulers (most of them were extraterritorial). This system for governance became further systematised and fortified, and it has continued to exist ever since. Even today 223 comunidades are still functioning in Goa, though not in the true sense.

===The later migrations===
The second wave of migrants arrived sometime between 1700 and 1400 BC. This second wave migration was accompanied by southern Indians from the Deccan plateau. A wave of &quot;Kusha&quot; or Harappan people moved to Lothal probably around 1600 BC to escape submergence of their civilization which thrived on sea-trade. With the admixture of several cultures, customs, religions, dialects and beliefs, led to revolutionary change in early Goan society.

=== Maurya Empire ===

Chandragupta Maurya incorporated the west coast of India in his province of Aparanta, and the impact of Magadhan Prakrit, the official language of the Mauryan Empire, on the local dialects resulted in the formation of early Konkani, as was the case with other Aryan vernaculars. During this era Buddhism was introduced to Goa. Similarly a native Goan named Purna, also known as Punna in Pali, who traveled to Sarnath is considered a direct disciple of Buddha, who popularised Buddhism in Goa in the 5th century BC.

===The Satavahanas (c. 2nd century BCE to 2nd CE)===

The Satavahana dynasty ruled Goa through their coastal vassals, the Chutus of Karwar. This period is estimated to have lasted from around the 2nd century BC to 100 AD. The Satavahanas had established maritime power and their contacts with Roman Empire from the coastal trade from Sindh to Saurashtra, from Bharuch to Sopara to Goa, where Greek and Roman ships would halt during voyages. The Bhojas fortified themselves after the end of Satavahana Empire. With the fall of the Satavahanas, the lucrative seaborne trade declined. Many Greek converts to Buddhism settled in Goa during this period. Buddha statues in Greek styles have been found in Goa. It can be seen that they ruled a very small part of Goa. Maharashtri &quot;prakrit&quot; was their language of administration, which influenced medieval Konkani to a great extent.

;Goa under the Western Kshatrapas
In the year 150AD, Vashishtiputra Satakarni was defeated by his son-in-law, the Kshatrapa King Rudradaman I who established his rule over Goa. This dynasty ruled the territory until 249AD. Thereafter the dynasty&#x27;s power seems to have been weakened by their generals, the Abhiras

===The Mauryas of Puri ===

The history of the Mauryas is almost non-existent. The existing records disclose the names of only three of the dynasty&#x27;s kings, namely &quot;Suketavarman&quot;, who ruled some time in the 4th or 5th centuries, &quot;Chandravarman&quot; in the 6th century, and &quot;Ajitavarman&quot; in the 7th century, who ruled from &quot;Kumardvipa&quot; or modern &quot;Kumarjuve&quot;, but beyond that the records provide no clue as to their mutual relationship. These dates were determined by comparing the style of the Nagari script in which these records are written with the evolution of this script, which may be dated fairly accurately. It is possible to infer from the places mentioned in these records and their discovery locations that at its zenith, the Western Maurya Kingdom comprised the Lata or South Gujarat, coastal Maharashtra, Goa, and approximately half of the North Kanara district. After the Maurya Empire had passed its meridian in the 2nd century BC its satrap in Aparanta made himself independent. A scion of the imperial Mauryas, he founded a dynasty that ruled over the west coast for nearly four centuries from its capital &quot;Shurparaka&quot; or modern Sopara. This dynasty was known as the &quot;Konkan Mauryas&quot;. Goa was called &quot;Sunaparant&quot; by the Mauryas.

===Bhojas (c. 2nd century BCE to 4th CE)===

First existing as vassals of the Mauryas and later as an independent kingdom, the Bhojas ruled Goa for more than 500 years, annexing the entirety of Goa. The earliest known record of the Bhojas from Goa dates from the 4th century, it was found in the town of Shiroda in Goa. According to Puranik, by tradition the Bhojas belonged to the clan of Yadavas, who may have migrated to Goa via Dwaraka after the Mahabharata war. Two Bhoja copperplates grants dating back to the 3rd century BC were unearthed from Bandora village, written by King Prithvimallavarman. Ancient &quot;Chandrapur&quot;, modern day Chandor, was the capital of the Bhoja Empire.

From the Bhoja inscriptions found in Goa and Konkan, it is evidenced that the Bhojas used Sanskrit and Prakrit for administration.
According to Vithal Raghavendra Mitragotri, many Brahmins and Vaishyas arrived with Kshatriyas Bhojas from the north. The Kshatriya Bhojas patronised Buddhism and employed many Buddhist converts of Greek and Persian origin.

== Kingdoms to Late Medieval period (1st century CE to 16th) ==
===Table of dynasties (to 16th century)===
Goa was ruled by several dynasties of various origins from circa the beginning of the common era to 1500. Since Goa had been under the sway of several dynasties, there was no organised judicial or policing system in those days, except for traditional arrangements governed by absolute rulers and local chieftains. There may have been more order under Muslim rule.
During this time, Goa was not ruled as a singular kingdom. Parts of this territory were ruled by several different kingdoms. The boundaries of these kingdoms were not clearly defined and the kings were content to consider their dominions as extending over many villages, which paid tribute and owed them allegiance.
===Shilaharas (755 – 1000)===
The Shilaharas of South Konkan ruled Goa from 755 until 1000 AD. Sannaphulla, the founder of the dynasty, was a vassal of the Rashtrakutas. Their copper-plate inscriptions suggest that they ruled from Vallipattana (there is no unanimity amongst the scholars regarding identification of Vallipattana, some identify it with Balli in Goa, or it may either be Banda or Kharepatan in the modern-day state of Maharashtra), Chandrapura and Gopakapattana. This was a tumultuous period in Goan history. As the Goa Shilahara power waned during the 11th century, the Arab traders gained increasing control of the overseas trade. They enjoyed autonomy from the Shilaharas. In order to control this decline, Kadamba King Guhalladeva I, ruling from Chandor, established secular, political, and economic partnerships with these Arab states. After the Chalukyas defeated the Rashtrakutas, exploiting this situation to their advantage, the Kadamba King, Shashthadeva II, firmly established his rule in Goa.

===Kadambas (10th century to 14th)===

The Kadambas ruled Goa between the 10th and 14th centuries. In the beginning, the Kadambas ruled only Sashti present day Salcette, a small part of Konkan. They ruled from Chandor, over a large part of Goa, but the port of Gopakapattana was not included in the early years.

====Port of Gopakapattana (10th century to 1345)====
Later King Shashthadeva conquered the island of Goa, including the ports of Gopakapattana and Kapardikadvipa, and annexed a large part of South Konkan to his kingdom. He made Gopakapattana as his secondary capital. His successor, King Jayakeshi I&quot;,&quot; expanded the Goan kingdom. The Sanskrit Jain text &quot;Dvayashraya&quot; mentions the extent of his capital. Port Gopakapattana had trade contacts with Zanzibar, Bengal, Gujarat and Sri Lanka (mentioned as Zaguva, Gauda, Gurjara, and Simhala in the Sanskrit texts). The city has been described in the contemporary records not only as aesthetically pleasing, but spiritually cleansing as well. Because it was a trading city, Gopakapattana was influenced by many cultures, and its architecture and decorative works showed this cosmopolitan effect. The capital was served by an important highway called Rajvithi or Rajpath, which linked it with Ela, the ruins of which can still be seen. For more than 300 years, it remained a centre for intra-coastal and trans-oceanic trade from Africa to Malaya. Later in the 14th century, the port was looted by the Khalji general Malik Kafur. The capital was transferred to Chandor and then back to Gopakapattana because of Muhammad bin Tughluq&#x27;s attack on Chandor.

Guhalladeva III, Jayakeshi II, Shivachitta Paramadideva, Vinshuchitta II and Jayakeshi III dominated Goa&#x27;s political scene in the 12th century. During the rule of Kadambas, the name and fame of Goapuri had reached it zenith. Goa&#x27;s religion, culture, trade and arts flourished under the rule of these kings. The Kings and their queens built many Shiva temples as they were devout Shaivites. They assumed titles like Konkanadhipati, Saptakotisha Ladbha Varaveera, Gopakapura varadhishva, Konkanmahacharavarti and Panchamahashabda. The Kings had matrimonial relationships with the Kings of Saurashtra, and even the local chieftains. The Kings patronised Vedic religion and performed major fire sacrifices like &quot;the horse sacrifice&quot; or Ashvamedha. They are also known for patronising Jainism in Goa.

Though their language of administration was Sanskrit and Kannada, Konkani and Marathi were also prevalent. They introduced Kannada language to Goa, which had a very profound influence on the local tongue. Nagari script, Kadamba script, Halekannada script and Goykanadi scripts were very popular. Kadamba Tribhuvanamalla, inscribed a record, dated saka 1028 or AD 1106, that he established a Brahmapuri at Gopaka. Brahmapuris were ancient universities run by the Brahmins where the Vedas, astrology, philosophy, medicine, and other subjects were studied. Such Brahampuris were found in many places in Goa such as Savoi verem and Gauli moula.

Kadambas ruled Goa for more than 400 years. On 16 October 1345 Goa Kadamba King Suriya Deva was assassinated by Muslim invaders.

===Bahmani Sultanate (1350-1370, 1469-1492)===
From 1350 to 1370, Goa was ruled by the Bahmani Sultanate. In 1469 Goa was again conquered by the Bahmani Sultans of Gulbarga. This Sultanate broke up in 1492.

===Vijayanagara Empire (14th century to 15th)===
In 1370, the Vijayanagara Empire had reconquered Goa. Vijayanagara was a resurgent Hindu state controlling much of south India; its capital was located at modern day Hampi, in Karnataka. The Vijayanagara rulers then held Goa for nearly a century. During that time its harbours were important ports of arrival for Arabian horses destined for the Vijayanagara cavalry.

===Bijapur Sultanate (1492-1510)===
In 1492, Goa became a part of Adil Shah&#x27;s Bijapur Sultanate, which established Goa Velha as its second capital. The former Secretariat building in Panaji is a former Adil Shahi palace. It functioned for the Portuguese as the official residence of their Viceroys.

== Portuguese rule (1510–1961) ==

===Portuguese arrival===
Vasco da Gama commanded the first circumnavigation of Africa, relying on stories and maps from earlier Portuguese voyages. His fleet of four ships set off from Lisbon in 1497. After island stops at Tenerife and Cape Verde, the ships made landfall on the West African coast. They then steered southwest into the vast South Atlantic Ocean. Near Brazil, by making an eastward turn, they headed toward the southern cape of Africa which they rounded. After passing by the Rio do Infante described earlier by a fellow explorer, a northward course was set. The ships stopped at the East African ports of Mozambique, Mombasa and Malinda. An Arab pilot, or an Indian, then guided their remaining course across the Arabian Sea. A year out from Lisbon, de Gama&#x27;s fleet landed in Calicut, India. Their arrival signalled the end of Muslim monopoly over the region&#x27;s maritime trade.

Before the Portuguese ships came to India, the seas to the east had been dominated by the thalassocratic Chola Empire of the Tamils, followed by their Shailendra dynasty successors and other Indianized seafaring states of Java and Sumatra. &quot;Indian ship-building had a high reputation at the time&quot;. Yet &quot;by the fifteenth century the navigation of Indian waters was in the hands of the Arabs&quot; both toward the east and westward toward the Gulf and the Red Sea.

===Afonso de Albuquerque===
When Francisco de Almeida arrived to serve as the first Portuguese viceroy of the East (1505-1509), already there was a regional war on the Malabar coast. In 1505 the Estado da India was established there, in Cochin considerably south of Goa. Almeida ended his tenure with a naval victory fought off Diu, far to the north in Gujarat.

The admiral Afonso de Albuquerque became second viceroy (1509-1515). In 1510 Timoji requested the Portuguese to take over Goa. The offer was welcomed. The city then was quickly seized from Ismail Adil Shah, ruler of the Bijapur Sultanate, but as quickly lost. Albuquerque, however, returned in force on 25 November. In a day the gunnery of the Portuguese ships, and armed parties landing on shore, regained possession. Ismail Adil Shah and his Egyptian Mamluk allies formally surrendered Goa on 10 December. An estimate held that 6,000 of the 9,000 Muslim defenders died, in the battle on the streets or trying to flee. Albuquerque gained direct support from the Hindu people, which frustrated Timoji. He had expected to take autocratic command of the city. Albuquerque appointed him instead chief Aguazil, an administrative office whose role included being the Hindu representative. Timoji was a learned interpreter of local customs.

By eliminating the jizya tax, Albuquerque secured his victory. &quot;Most of the population of Goa were Konkani-speaking Hindus [and] Albuquerque had the good sense to cut their taxes in half&quot;. In spite of frequent attacks by raiders, Goa became the centre of Portuguese India. The conquest drew deference from several neighboring kingdoms: the Sultan of Gujarat and the Zamorin of Calicut dispatched embassies, offering alliances and local concessions, e.g., to build fortifications.

Albuquerque started a Portuguese mint in Goa. Local merchants and Timoji had complained about the scarcity of currency. The new coin served to announce the recent conquests. Its value was pegged to existing coins. An additional mint was built in Portuguese Malacca.

Albuquerque and his successors left the customs and constitutions of the thirty village communities on the island almost untouched, abolishing only the rite of &quot;sati&quot;, in which widows were burned on their husband&#x27;s funeral pyre. A register of these customs (&quot;Foral de usos e costumes&quot;) was published in 1526; it is among the most valuable historical documents pertaining to Goan customs.

Goa was the base for Albuquerque&#x27;s conquest of Malacca in 1511 and Hormuz in 1515. Albuquerque intended it to be a colony and a naval base, distinct from the fortified factories established in certain Indian seaports. Goa was made capital of the Portuguese Vice-Kingdom in Asia, and the other Portuguese possessions in India, Malacca and other bases in Indonesia, East Timor, the Persian Gulf, Macau in China and trade bases in Japan were under the suzerainty of its Viceroy. By mid-16th century, the area under occupation had expanded to most of present-day limits.

===The new Goan polity===

;Civil government, jurisdiction
An initial aim of the rulers of Goa was military security, especially from the threat posed by the Bijapur sultanate. Goa&#x27;s head of state, often titled the Viceroy, was appointed directly by the Portuguese King. The viceroy might consult the finance council, the captain of the armed forces, the &quot;fidalgos&quot;, the Archbishop of Goa, the chief of judiciary, the &quot;Vereador da Fazenda&quot; (superintendent of finance), the merchants, and others in informal councils. Commercial success was a primary objective, the purchase in quantity of fine spices to carry back to Europe. Ancillary objectives were creation of a spice-trade monopoly with control over merchant competitors, and levying duties on the cargoes of merchant vessels. Scores of commercial posts and stations were established, not only throughout India, but from Mozambique (Africa) and Hormuz (the Gulf) to Malacca (Malaya) and Macau (China).

Portuguese rule in Goa endured for four and a half centuries. Its Senate or municipal chamber maintained direct communications with the King and paid a special representative to attend to its interests at Court. In 1563 the Governor proposed to make Goa the seat of a parliament representing all parts of the Portuguese east, but this was rejected by the King. Eventually Goa was granted the same civic privileges as Lisbon.

The Portuguese rulers in Goa were either Viceroys or Governors. Their original jurisdiction included those possessions of the Portuguese from east Africa to south Asia and east Asia. The first viceroy to serve located himself in Kochi to the south of Goa on the Malabar coast; in 1510 this Portuguese seat of government was then established at Velha Goa.

;Control of navigation

Chief among the rivals of Portuguese Goa were the traders of the Zamorin, ruler of Calicut (Kozhikode) on the Malabar coast (northern Kerala). The Zamorin&#x27;s merchant ships regularly sailed on the Arabian Sea, also venturing in the Bay of Bengal. Other formidable sea traders were of Gujarat to the north. Opponents of the Portuguese in India could then effectively convert their merchant vessels into warships. Early naval battles were Chaul (1508), and a decisive one off Diu (1509) won by the Portuguese.

Naval combat worked to decide the status of the rivals. The distinct advantage of the Portuguese was the cannon mounted on their ships. Vasco de Gama&#x27;s flagship &quot;San Gabriel&quot; alone carried twenty guns of quality manufacture. Their mostly Muslim antagonists, lacking ship cannon, could not compete in the sea battles. Although Babur&#x27;s invasion of India in 1526 used cannon, their use &quot;on ships at sea was not known&quot; before the Portuguese. Further, the well-made sailing ships of India had hulls sewn together not nailed, better in some weather, but unable to absorb the recoil from discharge of onboard cannon. &quot;India was, on most criteria, one of the advanced countries of the world.&quot; Yet regarding naval cannon, gunnery, ship design, and nautical skill, the Portuguese had the edge.

The Ottoman Turks also disputed control of the Indian Ocean. At Suez overland by camel they transported Mediterranean galleys in pieces for reassembly on the Red Sea, to reinforce their naval forces. From 1538 to 1553 the Turks sent battle fleets against the Portuguese. In several key engagements, however, the transoceanic caravels and galleons outmaneuvered the Turkish galleys.

Hence, from Goa the Portuguese were able to command the Indian Ocean. They instituted a system to tax its trade. Portuguese cartazes (permits for navigation) were issued to owners of merchant vessels. The &quot;cartaza&quot; obliged the captain to keep to his ship&#x27;s declared route and stop at the named Portuguese fort to pay duties on merchandise. &quot;Any ship sailing without their &quot;cartas&quot; was treated as a pirate and was liable to capture and confiscation. . . . The Arab sea trade with India... passed into the hands of the Portuguese.&quot; During the sixteenth century &quot;some eight hundred Portuguese galleons&quot; sailed in Indian waters, which became &quot;virtually a Portuguese monopoly.&quot;

;The spice trade
Portuguese control of the waters off South Asia enabled them to master the lucrative spice trade during the 16th century. 
They coordinated and consolidated their operations from their base at Goa. At first their merchants, called factors, were unfamiliar with the local produce markets, and with appraising the quality of different spices. They learned how not to overpay for poor quality. For storage until seasonal ships left for Portugal, they set up warehouses called factories. At strategic positions on many coasts of the Indian Ocean, the Portuguese established well-guarded, fortified factories.

At the bazaars of Goa, goods from all parts of the East were displayed. Separate streets were designated for the sale of different classes of goods: Bahrain pearls and coral, Chinese porcelain and silk, Portuguese velvet and piece-goods, and drugs and spices from the Malay Archipelago. Fine peppers came from the nearby Malabar coast. Goa was then called &quot;Goa Dourada&quot;, i.e., &quot;Golden Goa&quot;.

Especially the Portuguese enjoyed the great rewards to be made by shipping spice cargoes around Africa to Lisbon. The ever increasing demand of Europe meant ready buyers willing to pay top prices. &quot;Arab and Venetian merchants remained in the spice trade throughout the century of Portuguese power in Asia&quot; but the &quot;trade has shifted dramatically&quot;. The middle-merchant carriers had been short-circuited by the ships direct to Lisbon.

;Life in Goa 
In 1542, St. Francis Xavier mentions the architectural splendour of the city. Goa reached the height of its prosperity between 1575 and 1625. Travellers marvelled at &quot;Goa Dourada&quot;, i.e., &quot;Golden Goa&quot;. A Portuguese proverb said, &quot;He who has seen Goa need not see Lisbon.&quot; The houses of the rich were surrounded by gardens and palm groves; they were built of stone and painted red or white. Instead of glass, their balconied windows had thin polished oyster-shells set in lattice-work. The social life of Goa&#x27;s rulers befitted the capitol of the viceregal court, the army and navy, and the church; luxury and ostentation became a byword before the end of the 16th century. Nonetheless, according to Portuguese records there was a Cholera epidemic in 1543, &quot;It is said that deaths from the disposal of the disease were so numerous that the disposal of bodies was a formidable task&quot;

In the main street, African and Indian slaves were sold by auction. Almost all manual labour was performed by slaves. The common soldiers assumed high-sounding titles, and even the poor noblemen who congregated in boarding-houses subscribed for a few silken cloaks, a silken umbrella and a common man-servant, so that each could take his turn to promenade the streets, fashionably attired and with a proper escort.

In 1583, Christian missionary activity in the village of Cuncolim led to conflicts, culminating in the Cuncolim Revolt. The first massacre happened when kshatriya villagers killed five Catholic priests (including an Italian nobleman) and fourteen native Christians. The Portuguese authorities then destroyed orchards and attacked the Hindu villagers. Cuncolim village had sixteen chieftains, one for each ward or &quot;vado&quot; of the village. The sixteen were called to Assolna Fort, ostensibly to discuss a peace pact. At the fort the Portuguese executed the chieftains, except for one who jumped into the Assolna River and presumably swam to Karwar. The Hindus of Cuncolim then refused to pay taxes, and the Portuguese confiscated their land. In 1560 the Goa Inquisition began, ending in 1812. The Hindu villagers who did not want to become Christian then left their villages with their idols before their temples were demolished. Most of these Hindus then settled in the neighbouring areas that were ruled by Bijapur, and again had to pay the jizya tax.
;Printing press, medical college
In 1556 a printing press was first installed India at Saint Paul&#x27;s College in Goa. Through publications made on the printing press, Goa opened a window on the knowledge and customs of Europe. The Jesuits brought this European-style, metal movable type technology to Macau in China in 1588 and to Japan in 1590. The Jesuits also founded the University of Santo Tomas in the Philippines, the oldest existing European-style university in the Far East. In the same period, Goa Medical College was established as the first European medical college in Asia.

Garcia da Orta (1501-1568) wrote in Goa a treatise in Portuguese on the medicinal plants of India, Colóquios dos simples e drogas da India. It was published in 1563 in Goa on the new printing press, which contained many errors in its type-setting. The author was a physician, an herbalist, a pioneer in pharmacognosy, and originally a Sephardic Jew. As a &quot;Cristão Novo&quot; (New Christian) he had escaped the Inquisition; but one of his sisters was not as fortunate.

===Christianity in Goa===

The Crown in Lisbon undertook to finance missionary activity; missionaries and priests converted large numbers of people in all spheres of society, especially in Goa. St Francis Xavier in Goa, pioneered the establishment of a seminary, called Saint Paul&#x27;s College. It was the first Jesuit headquarters in Asia. St Francis founded the college to train Jesuit missionaries. He went to the Far East, traveling towards China. Missionaries of the Jesuit Order spread out through India, going as far north as the court of the great Mughal Emperor Jallaluddin Akbar. Having heard about the Jesuits, he invited them to come and teach him and his children about Christianity.

From Goa, the Jesuit order was able to set up base almost anywhere in Asia for evangelistic missions, including the founding of Roman Catholic colleges, universities and faculties of education. Jesuits are known for their work in education, intellectual research, and cultural pursuits, and for their missionary efforts. Jesuits also give retreats, minister in hospitals and parishes, and promote social justice and ecumenical dialogue.; Saint Paul&#x27;s College Goa was a base for their evangelisation of Macau, and then for their important missionary campaigns into China and Japan. Macau eventually superseded St Paul&#x27;s College, Goa. They built St Paul College in 1594 (now the University of Macau), known in Latin as the college of &quot;Mater Dei&quot;. Due to his personal enmity with the Jesuits, the Marquês de Pombal expelled the order from Portuguese territories in 1762. The Macau university combined evangelisation with education.

In the year 1600 António de Andrade made the long voyage from Lisbon to Goa, where he pursued his higher studies at St. Paul&#x27;s College and was ordained a Jesuit priest. He eventually became rector of the same college. He made a landmark missionary expedition from Goa, across the length of India and into Tibet. He overcame incredible hardships in the journey as the first European to cross the Himalaya mountains into Tibet. There he founded churches and a mission in 1625. The body of the co-founder of the Society of Jesus, Francis Xavier, whose example many Goan missionaries tried to emulate by engaging in evangelizing work in Asia, was shipped to Goa on 11 December 1553. Goa has also produced its own saints: the martyrs of Cuncolim; St. Joseph Vaz, whose missionary exploits in Sri Lanka are remembered with gratitude in that country; and the Venerable Agnelo de Souza.

The 16th-century monument, the cathedral or Sé, was constructed during Portugal&#x27;s Golden Age, and is the largest church in Asia, as well as larger than any church in Portugal. The church is 250 ft in length and 181 ft in breadth. The frontispiece stands 115 ft high. The cathedral is dedicated to St. Catherine of Alexandria and is also known as St. Catherine&#x27;s Cathedral. It was on her feast day in 1510 that Afonso de Albuquerque defeated the Muslim army and took possession of the city of Goa.

The Goa Inquisition was the office of the Inquisition acting within the Indian state of Goa and the rest of the Portuguese empire in Asia. It was established in 1560, briefly suppressed from 1774 to 1778, and finally abolished in 1812. Based on the records that survive, H. P. Salomon and I. S. D. Sassoon state that between the Inquisition&#x27;s beginning in 1561 and its temporary abolition in 1774, some 16,202 persons were brought to trial. Of this number, only 57 were sentenced to death and executed; another 64 were burned in effigy. Most were subjected to lesser punishments or penances.

The Inquisition was established to punish New Christians who continued practicing their ancestral religion in secret. Many Sephardic Jews (as falsely-converted Catholics) had immigrated to Goa from the Iberian peninsula. Due to persecution by the Inquisition, most left and migrated to Fort St. George (later Madras/Chennai) and Cochin, where the English and the Dutch allowed them to be openly Jewish.
In Goa the Inquisition also scrutinised Indian converts from Hinduism or Islam who were thought to have returned to their original ways. It prosecuted non-converts who broke prohibitions against the observance of Hindu or Muslim rites, or interfered with Portuguese attempts to convert non-Christians to Catholicism. Goan Inquisition was abolished in 1812.

===Relations with neighboring powers===
;Bijapur 

When the Portuguese arrived in Goa, they encountered the established regime of the Sultanate of Bijapur under Yusuf Adil Shah (1450-1510). The Adil Shah (written &quot;Hidalcão&quot; by the Portuguese) controlled Goa (and significant territory of the Sultanate) from his distant, inland capital. Led by Afonso de Albuquerque, in alliance with Timoji, their 1510 attack ended in Portuguese victory. Bijapur lost Goa, but continued as a large, local power. In 1565 Bijapur and other Deccan Sultanates in a jihad destroyed the capital of the Hindu Empire Vijayanagara, an ally of the Portuguese. From the spoils Bijapur doubled its size. In 1571 Bijapur in an alliance of mostly Muslim sultanates (Ahmadnagar, Bijapur, Calicut, Aceh) launched determined attacks on Goa, which failed. The defeat of this siege of Goa proved decisive.

;Kanara
The Kanara coastal regions lay immediately south of Goa. Many small principalities, largely autonomous, were under Vijayanagara, then Bijapur. Timoji, who played a role in the 1510 capture of Goa, was from Kanara, e.g., Honavar. Goa traded with various Kanara rulers, which was an important source of rice for domestic consumption; other goods were pepper for export and timber for ships building. The Portuguese had built a fort and ran a factory in Kanara, and were often in effective local control. The Nayak rulers of the Keladi ruling family, however, began to dispute with Goa over the prices paid for trade goods, and other issues. Goa was not able to pay the increases demanded. A series of treaties were nonetheless negotiated. Then hostile Dutch influence increased and Arabs from Muscat began to compete with Goa for the Kanara trade. 
;Mughal
When Akbar (r. 1555–1605) ruled the Mughal Empire, he endeavored to harmonize the empire&#x27;s conflicting religions. At Akbar&#x27;s court, rival Muslim clerics had heated debates. At his new capital Fatehpur Sikri, meetings at his Ibadat Khana [&quot;House of Worship&quot;] more variously included &quot;Muslim scholars, Hindu pandits, Parsi mobeds, and Jain sadhus&quot;. Akbar &quot;invited Jesuits from Goa&quot; but no Buddhists were in proximity. Conferring privately with Jesuits, Akbar discussed Christianity and Abrahamic theology. In 1682 Akbar promulgated a syncretic Din-i-Ilahi [&quot;Divine Faith&quot;]. &quot;The crucial question about Akbar&#x27;s religious activity is whether he established a new religion or new spiritual order.&quot; Either way, his efforts came to nought.

Goa enjoyed a flourishing trade with Gujarat, when Akbar annexed it in 1573. Agreeable relations were worked out, however, allowing the Portuguese at Diu to continue to issue cartazes and collect duties on the sea trade. In 1602 the English arrived in Asia and pirated a loaded Portuguese merchant ship off Malacca. In 1608 with 25,000 pieces of gold an English captain arranged for rights at Surat, the Mughal Empire&#x27;s principle trading port. This led to a two-year war between the Mughals and the Portuguese, ending with a feckless treaty in 1615. The Mughals, then dominate in India but weak at sea, began to play the Europeans off against each other. Under Emperor Aurangzeb (r. 1658–1707), the Mughals became frustrated by their war against the Marathas. Goa remained neutral, but once praised Shivaji&#x27;s valor.

;Dutch

In 1595 there first appeared in Indian waters ships of the Dutch United East India Company (Dutch: &quot;Vereenigde Oostindische Compagnie or VOC&quot;). Until then, for almost a century, the Portuguese had managed to keep secret their &quot;more detailed information about India,&quot; especially their &quot;priceless Portuguese navigation maps&quot;. Yet Jan Huygen van Linschoten, who had worked in Goa, in 1592 came away with the coveted knowledge which &quot;taught the Dutch how to use the monsoon winds to their best advantage.&quot; Also unfortunately for Portugal, Spain had initiated the Iberian Union, which united the two countries. Additionally, the Dutch and the Spanish were then fighting their Eighty Years&#x27; War. In 1600 against Goa the Dutch allied with regional Muslim forces (the Sultanate of Bijapur); then the Dutch made war on Goa. The long-term result of these hostilities was the undoing of Portuguese naval dominion in the Indian Ocean and a loss of its preeminence in sea trade. In 1603 and 1639, the city was blockaded by Dutch fleets, though never captured. The Dutch East India Company were defeated at the Travancore–Dutch War, which stifled their influence in the region.

;Vijayanagara
The Vijayanagara Empire (1336-1646) ruled vast lands in South India when the Portuguese arrived in Goa. The empire&#x27;s rise as a great power was said to encompass a &quot;mission of upholding the Hindu cause against Islam.&quot; Vijayanagara had earlier governed Goa; its ruler Vira Narasimha Raya (r. 1505–1509) contemplated retaking it, but soon died. Krishna Deva Raya (r. 1509–1529) then succeeded as ruler, said to be the empire&#x27;s best. The Portuguese then were aggressively establishing control of maritime trade routes and coastal ports in Cochin and Goa. The regional political rivalries developed so that Vijayanagara and Goa remained aligned as friendly powers. The Portuguese supplied Vijayanagara with Persian horses. A Portuguese engineer improved irrigation for lands of Krishna Deva Raya. Vijayanagara was ultimately defeated in 1646 by an alliance of Deccan sultanates. So vital was this alliance to Goa, that Goa lost much of its importance after the fall of Vijayanagara.

There began a gradual drop in Goa&#x27;s prosperity. In 1635 Goa was ravaged by an epidemic. Jean de Thévenot in 1666, Baldaeus in 1672, and Fryer in 1675 described Goa in decline.
;Maratha
The Maratha Empire (1674-1818) to the north grew steadily in strength, far surpassing that of the Mughal Empire, let alone Goa. After his escape from Aurangzeb in Agra, the Maratha ruler Chhatrapati Shivaji (1627-1680) started a counterattack to recoup lands lost to the Mughals through the Treaty of Purandar (1665). Against Goa, Chhatrapati Shivaji mounted an invasion that subdued the region adjoining the Old Conquestas. He captured Pernem, Bicholim, Sattari, Ponda, Sanguem, Quepem and Canacona from the Portuguese. Sawantwadi Bhonsale and Saudekar Rajas became his vassals.

The Maratha Chhatrapati Sambhaji (1657-1689), the son of C. Shivaji, tried in 1683 to conquer all of Goa. Chh. Sambhaji almost ousted the remaining Portuguese, but suddenly a Mughal army appeared which prevented the Maratha from completing their conquest, resulting in the culmination of the Deccan wars. In 1739-1740 the territory of Bardez in north Goa was attacked by the Marathas, in order to pressure the Portuguese at Vasai. The plan of conquest, however, was forestalled with &quot;the payment of a large war indemnity.&quot;

In June 1756 a Maratha Army invading Goa killed in action Luís Mascarenhas, Count of Alva (Conde de Alva), the Portuguese Viceroy. The Marathas, however faced an invasion from Afghan, resulting in their defeat at the Third Battle of Panipat (1761). The Maratha Peshwa&#x27;s overall control slackened throughout India. The Portuguese then defeated the regional Rajas of Sawantwadi and the Raja of Sunda to reconquer an area from Pernem to Canacona. This territory formed the Novas Conquistas, within the boundaries of present-day Goa. Following the Battle of Panipat, the Mughals retained their friendly relationship with the Portuguese.

;English
The long Dutch war described above led Portugal to seek an alliance with the English, which proved costly. The Dutch war did finally end in 1663. In 1665 the English demanded in payment the cession of Bombay. Officially it was part of the dowry of Catherine of Braganza on her ill-starred marriage to Charles II. Though at first active rivals in India after the English East India Company arrived in 1601, the two latter attempted to coordinate against common enemies. The Maratha-derived &quot;pirate&quot; fleet led by the independent Kanhoji Angre inspired such an uneasy alliance. The 1721 Anglo-Portuguese naval attack on Culaba, the Angria stronghold, was repulsed. It was a fiasco that then embittered the partnership.

===Estado da India: 18th and 19th centuries===
In 1757, King Joseph I of Portugal issued a decree, developed by his minister Marquês de Pombal, granting Portuguese citizenship to all subjects in the Portuguese Indies, with the right to be represented in the Portuguese Parliament. Pombal (1699-1782), an anti-Catholic Freemason, served the King as the &quot;de facto&quot; leader of Portugal, 1750–1777. The enclaves of Goa, Damão, Diu, Dadra and Nagar Haveli became collectively known as the &quot;Estado da Índia Portuguesa&quot;. The first election was held in Goa on 14 January 1822. Three local citizens were elected as members of the Portuguese parliament. From their first arrival, the Portuguese intermarried among the converted natives of Goa. They produced Luso-Indian offspring, who were also Catholic.

In 1787, some disgruntled priests attempted a rebellion against Portuguese rule. It was known as the Conspiracy of the Pintos.

Goa was peacefully occupied by the British between 1812 and 1815 in line with the Anglo-Portuguese Alliance during the Napoleonic Wars.

The viceroy transferred his residence from the vicinity of Goa city to New Goa (in Portuguese &quot;Nova Goa&quot;), today&#x27;s Panaji. In 1843 this was made the official seat of government; it completed a move that had been discussed as early as 1684. Old Goa city&#x27;s population fell steeply during the 18th century as Europeans moved to the new city. Old Goa has been designated a World Heritage Site by UNESCO because of its history and architecture.

The Goa civil code was introduced in 1869 after Portuguese Goa and Damaon were elevated from being mere Portuguese colonies to the status of a Província Ultramarina (Overseas possession).

===Second World War===
Goa was neutral during the conflict like Portugal. As a result, at the outbreak of hostilities a number of Axis ships sought refuge in Goa rather than be sunk or captured by the British Royal Navy. Three German merchants ships, the &quot;Ehrenfels&quot;, the &quot;Drachenfels&quot; and the &quot;Braunfels&quot;, as well as an Italian ship, took refuge in the port of Mormugao. The &quot;Ehrenfels&quot; began transmitting Allied ship movements to the U-boats operating in the Indian Ocean, an action that was extremely damaging to Allied shipping.

But the British Royal Navy was unable to take any official action against these ships because of Goa&#x27;s stated neutrality. Instead the Indian mission of SOE backed a covert raid using members from the Calcutta Light Horse, a part-time unit made up of civilians who were not eligible for normal war service. The Light Horse embarked on an ancient Calcutta riverboat, the &quot;Phoebe&quot;, and sailed round India to Goa, where they sunk the &quot;Ehrenfels&quot;. The British then sent a decrypted radio message announcing it was going to seize the territory. This bluff made the other Axis crews scuttle their ships fearing they could be seized by British forces.

The raid was covered in the book &quot;Boarding Party&quot; by James Leasor. Due to the potential political ramifications of the fact that Britain had violated Portuguese neutrality, the raid remained secret until the book was published in 1978. In 1980 the story was made into the film, &quot;The Sea Wolves&quot;, starring Gregory Peck, David Niven and Roger Moore.

===Independence Movement===

When India became independent in 1947, Goa remained under Portuguese control. The Indian government of Jawaharlal Nehru demanded that Goa, along with a few other minor Portuguese holdings, be turned over to India. However, Portugal refused due to Goa being an integral part of Portugal since 1510. By contrast, France, which also had small enclaves in India (most notably Puducherry), surrendered all its Indian possessions relatively quickly.

In 1954, a horde of armed Indians flooded into and took over the tiny land-locked enclaves of Dadra and Nagar Haveli. This incident led the Portuguese to lodge a complaint against India in the International Court of Justice at The Hague. The final judgement on this case, given in 1960, held that the Portuguese had a right to the enclaves, but that India equally had a right to deny Portugal access to the enclaves over Indian territory.

In 1955 a group of unarmed civilians, the Satyagrahis, demonstrated against Portugal. At least twenty-two of them were killed by Portuguese gunfire.

Later the same year, these non-Goan Satyagrahis took over a fort at Tiracol and hoisted the Indian flag. They were driven out of Goa by the Portuguese with a number of casualties. On 1 September 1955, the Indian consulate in Goa was closed using this incident as an excuse; Nehru declared that his government would not tolerate the Portuguese presence in Goa. India then instituted a blockade against Goa, Damão, and Diu in an effort to force a Portuguese departure. Goa was then given its own airline by the Portuguese, the Transportes Aéreos da Índia Portuguesa, to overcome the blockade.

== Indian annexation of Goa ==
On 27 February 1950, the Government of India asked the Portuguese government to open negotiations about the future of Portuguese colonies in India. Portugal asserted that its territory on the Indian subcontinent was not a colony but part of metropolitan Portugal and hence its transfer was non-negotiable, and that India had no rights to this territory because the Republic of India did not exist at the time when Goa came under Portuguese rule. On 18 December 1961, Indian troops crossed the border into Goa and annexed it. Operation Vijay involved sustained land, sea and air strikes for more than thirty-six hours; it resulted in the unconditional surrender of Portuguese forces on 19 December 1961 by Manuel António Vassalo e Silva.

A United Nations resolution condemning the invasion was proposed by the United States and the United Kingdom in the United Nations Security Council, but it was vetoed by the USSR. Goa celebrates Liberation Day on 19 December every year, which is also a state holiday.

== Post-Annexation (1961 – present) ==
=== As a Union Territory (1961-1987) ===

The territory of Goa, Daman and Diu was a union territory of India from 19 December 1961 to 30 May 1987. Its official language was declared to be Marathi, much to the anger of the majority of the native Goans.

After a brief period of military rule, on 8 June 1962, military rule was replaced by civilian government when the Lieutenant Governor Kunhiraman Palat Candeth nominated an informal Consultative Council of 29 nominated members to assist him in the administration of the territory. Dayanand Bandodkar of the Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party was elected as the first Chief Minister of Goa, Daman and Diu. He attempted to merge Goa with Maharashtra by importing Marathi immigrants from the neighbouring state (Goa&#x27;s population increased by almost 35% in the 1960s due to heavy immigration of Marathi people), but his plans were foiled by the Goa Opinion Poll.

=== State of Goa (1987 -present) ===
In February 1987, the Indian government finally recognized Konkani as the official language of Goa. Goa was later admitted to Indian statehood in May 1987. Pratapsingh Rane, who had previously served as Chief Minister of Goa, Daman and Diu, was elected as the first Chief Minister of the newly formed state.

Goa has a high GDP per capita and Human Development Index compared to most Indian states.

<text>Marineland of the Pacific was a public oceanarium and tourist attraction located on the Palos Verdes Peninsula coast in Los Angeles County, California. Architect William Pereira designed the main structure. It was also known as Hanna-Barbera&#x27;s Marineland during the late 1970s and early 1980s. Marineland operated from 1954 until 1987, when it was purchased by the owners of SeaWorld San Diego. The new owners moved the popular killer whales and other animals to their San Diego facility and abruptly closed Marineland.

==History==

===Marineland===
When it opened in 1954, one year before Disneyland, Marineland of the Pacific was the world&#x27;s largest oceanarium. The park was designed by William Pereira, whose work, which included the Transamerica Pyramid, the Los Angeles International Airport, and Geisel Library helped define the architectural look of mid-20th century California.

Marineland was best known for its performing orcas. One tourist guide in 1974 stated, “Entertainment is the first purpose of this well-known Palos Verdes show place. Here’s a rare opportunity to see a ‘killer whale’ leaping 18 feet out of the water to grab a fish from the teeth of its trainer, a dolphin jumping through a fire-ringed hoop, or a sea lion crooning a tune.”

Marineland was home to Orky and Corky, two of the most famous orcas on exhibit at any oceanarium at the time. They were the second pair of orcas at the facility with these names; the original &quot;Orky&quot; and &quot;Corky&quot; did not live long in captivity and had no calves. Marineland was also home to the first pilot whales (&quot;Bubbles&quot; and &quot;Bimbo&quot;) ever captured for display, as well as dolphins, sea lions, harbor seals, sharks, and a variety of other related sea creatures.

Other attractions included the Sky Tower, “a circular elevator ride 344 feet above the sea,” and hourly boat tours of the coastline.

Marineland was also noteworthy for its Baja Reef concept, a first-of-its-kind swim-through aquarium featuring “many brightly colored fish.” Visitors could enter the winding aquarium wearing a swim mask and snorkel and swim with the fish and sharks. The tour lasted seven minutes in 1979. Special admission tickets to this attraction cost $4 in 1985 .

Circa 1979 there was a “new macaw show,” strolling cartoon characters and a “marine animal care center” at the park.

===Closing===

Harcourt Brace Jovanovich (the owner of the SeaWorld theme park group) purchased the facility in December 1986 from a Hong Kong developer. At the time, the park was run down and was just breaking even. Restoration plans were canceled on January 30, 1987 as Harcourt claimed that the park was in more disrepair than expected. Yearly losses of $2 million were projected unless improvements costing $25 million were undertaken.

Orky and Corky were moved to SeaWorld&#x27;s San Diego park a few weeks after the purchase, supposedly for mating. Although Orky died in September 1988, Corky remains alive as of March 2024. Rancho Palos Verdes city council passed an ordinance requiring Harcourt to maintain the park and allow public access to its beach. Although the company had promised to keep Marineland open, it was suddenly closed on February 11, 1987, six weeks after the sale was completed. Harcourt said it received bomb threats after announcing its change of heart, prompting it to lock the gates three weeks before the announced closing. The animals were trucked out in the middle of the night, and the new owners poured concrete into the drains so the park could not be reopened. Many local residents complained about the sudden closure. On March 1, 1987, the company announced that the park would stay closed.

===Abandonment===

Much of the infrastructure was left abandoned for nearly 20 years. Marineland&#x27;s most visible landmark, the high tower, remained standing until 1995. The Marineland Restaurant continued operating through 2004 as the &quot;Catalina Room&quot; (Catalina Island was visible on a clear day). Several other structures remained through 2006.

===Redevelopment===
In 1995, developer York Long Point purchased of coastal land that included the Marineland location for $24 million.

After several false starts, development began in 2007 on a new $450 million resort, a project by Lowe Destination Development, which was planned to include a hotel, privately owned &quot;casitas&quot;, and full spa and resort facilities. Originally projected to include an 18-hole golf course, the plan was changed to include only an &quot;Executive Par 3&quot; golf course on the resort property.

In early 2006, two small temporary sales offices replaced the abandoned gas station at the park entrance, and the large concrete sign along Palos Verdes Drive South (with a tower resembling a whale&#x27;s tail) was altered to feature the logo and artist&#x27;s impression of the resort. In July 2007, principal construction commenced, starting with the demolition of the remains of Marineland. The resort was completed in 2009. Today, the Terranea Resort occupies the site, but pays tribute to the history of the location, including Marineland.

The Point Vicente Interpretive Center, located a half-mile north on the same road, reopened in July 2006 after extensive remodeling, and it has a number of items related to Marineland in an exhibit, including a &quot;Save Marineland&quot; pin and various publications from the park. One of the original dolphin statues that formerly adorned the entrance to Marineland is also on display.

==Historical Society==

The Marineland of the Pacific Historical Society was formed in 2003 &quot;to provide information and access to historical information and images of the park to students, researchers, industry professionals, and interested parties&quot;.

== LA&#x27;s Own Marineland Podcast ==
In 2022, writer and podcaster Tod Perry, launched a ten-hour podcast, &quot;LA&#x27;s Own Marineland&quot; covering the park&#x27;s 33-year history, abandonment and the lives of the animals after its closure. The show includes interviews with 20 people intimately involved with the park including management, marine mammal trainers, and guest services employees.

==Television, film and music==
While still in operation, the park was prominently featured in several television shows, including two episodes of &quot;The Beverly Hillbillies&quot;, &quot;Mannix&quot;, &quot;The Munsters&quot;, &quot;The Partridge Family&quot;, &quot;Mutual of Omaha&#x27;s Wild Kingdom&quot;, &quot;Hart to Hart&quot;, &quot;The Six Million Dollar Man&quot;, &quot;Emergency!&quot;, &quot;The Colbys&quot;, &quot;Wonder Woman&quot;, &quot;Sea Hunt&quot;, and later, &quot;Simon &amp; Simon&quot; and an &quot;A Team&quot; episode a year before the park closed. Two episodes of The Chevy Show were taped there with Roy Rogers and Dale Evans featuring an &quot;Aquarodeo&quot; on May 1, 1960 and January 15, 1961. The fifth episode of the first season of The Invaders was filmed at Marineland. In an episode of the &quot;Lucy Show&quot; titled &quot;Lucy at Marineland&quot;, Lucille Ball falls into a Marineland animal exhibit which was featured on the August 28, 1965 cover of TV Guide. In 1958, Dixieland jazz artist Red Nichols recorded a live album at Marineland. In an episode of &quot;Wonderbug&quot;, titled Fish Story, Marineland was integral to the plot. Marineland was also briefly featured in the Charles Bronson film, &quot;The Mechanic&quot;, the Elvis Presley film, &quot;Live a Little, Love a Little&quot;, and the John Carradine film &quot;Blood of Dracula&#x27;s Castle&quot;. The &quot;Poor Little Kangaroo Rat&quot; episode of &quot;Route 66&quot; starring Martin Milner and George Maharis was filmed there with guest stars Ronny Howard, Leslie Nielsen, Maggie Pierce, and Joanne Linville which was in season 3 and episode 10 and originally aired on 11-23-62.

Since its closing, scenes for several feature films have been shot at the location, including &quot;Mermaids of Tiburon&quot;, the first three &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean&quot; films, &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels&quot;, &quot;Hot Shots!&quot;, &quot;Inspector Gadget&quot;, &quot;Fun with Dick and Jane&quot;, &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot;, &quot;The Aviator&quot;, &quot;Hidalgo&quot;, and &quot;Life As A House&quot;. For the latter, the suburban neighborhood exterior was entirely constructed from scratch on the site, as it was for &quot;Fun with Dick and Jane&quot;. Mel Gibson&#x27;s trailer was parked at the bottom of the cliff for Lethal Weapon 2. Beastmaster 2 was filmed there as well.

Several TV shows have also used the site for their filming needs, including regular use by NBC&#x27;s &quot;Fear Factor&quot; and one episode of &quot;Viper&quot;. The location was also used for MTV&#x27;s &quot;Motel California&quot;.

<doc id="923845" wikidata="Q742723" url="?curid=923845" title="Jean Joseph Dessolles, 1st Marquis Dessolles">
<text>Jean Joseph Dessolles, 1st [[Marquis]] Dessolles (born Jean Joseph Paul Augustin Dessolles; 3 July 1767 – 3 November 1828) was a French soldier and statesman. He was the Prime Minister of France from 29 December 1818 to 18 November 1819.

==Early life==
Born in Auch, in 1767, he was educated under the direction of his uncle, Irénée-Yves de Solle, who was the Bishop of Digne and later Chambéry.

==Military career==

===French Revolutionary Wars===
Having entered into military service in 1792, he became an Adjutant-General under the command of Napoléon Bonaparte during the Italian campaign of the War of the First Coalition. He soon rose to the rank of Brigadier-General on 31 May 1797.

During the War of the Second Coalition, he served as Chief of Staff to Jean Victor Marie Moreau in the Italian theatre, where he distinguished himself at Noir in 1799. He defeated the Austrians in the Valtellina in 1800, where under his command, French forces killed 1,200, captured 4,000 men, and eighteen pieces of cannon.

He assisted at the Battle of Novi, at the Battles of Sainte-Marie (where he was named Major-General on 13 April 1799, and also at Lodi, where he was honoured with the nickname &#x27;Decius français&#x27; (French Decius). He contributed to the French victory of Hohenlinden in 1801, and remained in service up to the Peace of Lunéville.

===Napoleonic Wars===
He was named a State Councillor (Conseiller d&#x27;État) in ordinary service, attached to the War section, on 30 Frimaire of the year X. In the Year XII, he entered into extraordinary service, and remained a member of the Council of Administration of War (Conseil d&#x27;Administration de la Guerre) until 1805.

On 12 Pluviôse of the year XIII, he was named Governor of the Palace of Versailles, and Grand Officer of the Legion of Honour in 1805. He received the provisional command of the Army of Hanover, until he was replaced by Bernadotte. He was then on standby until 1808.

He was disgraced in 1806 for having held hostile intentions against the Emperor, and was taken off the Council List (Liste du Conseil) on 2 February 1806. Napoléon wrote to Fouché on the subject:Je vous dirais que le général Desolles a tenu en confidence des propos fort extraordinaires qui montreraient l&#x27;existence d&#x27;une petite clique aussi envenimée que lâche. (I would like to say to you that the general Desolles has taken into confidence very extraordinary intentions which would show the existence of a little clique as poisoned as it is cowardly.) - &quot;Correspondence&quot;, XI, n° 9088He thereafter retired to a property that he owned near Auch, the Chartreuse du Pastisse at Preignan.

Eventually winning back imperial favour, he did not return to the State Council (Conseil d&#x27;État), and from 1808 to 1810 he commanded a division in Spain, during the Peninsular War. 

Prior to the Battle of Talavera (27–28 July 1809), King Joseph left Madrid 23 July, at the head of some 5,800 troops, to meet up with Victor&#x27;s 23,000 troops, and Sebastiani&#x27;s 17,500, to take the offensive against Cuesta at Torrijos, rather than letting him advance on Madrid. Left behind was only one brigade of Dessolles&#x27;s division, with a few Spanish levies, with which Augustin Daniel Belliard, the governor of the city, was expected to hold the capital; some 4,000 men, in all. Belliard had to be prepared to retreat into the Citadel of Madrid, in the Retiro, with his troops and the whole body of the &quot;Afrancesados&quot; and their families, if there was an insurrection, or if Venegas managed to reach the city from the east, or possibly Wilson, whose column was at Escalona (Toledo), just thirty-eight miles from Madrid, with a force that was believed to be much larger than it actually was.

Dessolles later distinguished himself at the Battle of Ocaña, at the Passage of Sierra Morena, and at Despena-Perros. He also captured Cordoba, where he governed in a manner &quot;to reconcile hearts&quot;.

He returned to France in February 1811, and remained until March 1812, when he was named Chief of Staff to Eugène de Beauharnais. In 1812, upon arrival in Smolensk, his health obligated him to return to Paris.

==Political career under the Bourbons==
On the first restoration of Louis XVIII, in 1814, the provisional government named him Commander-in-Chief of the National Guard and all troops of the 1st Division; the Comte d&#x27;Artois named him a member of the Provisional State Council (Conseil d&#x27;État provisoire); and the King named him Minister of State, a Peer of France, Major-General of all the National Guards of the Kingdom, Commander of Saint-Louis, and Grand Cordon of the Legion of Honour. These favours were rewards for his efforts convincing Emperor Alexander I of Russia to reject the proposed Habsburg-Bonaparte regency of Empress Marie-Louise, and instead supporting the restoration of the French Bourbons.

He was opposed to the return of Napoléon during the Hundred Days, and pronounced himself in favour of the Bourbons in 1814.

Under the Second Restoration, he pursued a political career. He was appointed Minister of Foreign Affairs and President of the Council (Prime Minister) with the formation of a liberal ministry in December 1818. In November 1819, he retired, disgusted by the demands of the reactionaries. He received public recognition as &#x27;Ministre Honnête Homme&#x27; (Gentleman Minister), and was thereafter a supporter of civil liberties.

He died in November 1828, at the Chateau de Monthuchet at Saulx-les-Chartreux (Essonne). He was buried at the Père-Lachaise Cemetery (28th division).

== Family ==

From his marriage with Anne Émilie (1777-1852), daughter of General Auguste Marie Henri Picot de Dampierre, he had one daughter, Hélène-Charlotte-Pauline (17 July 1805 – 10 July 1864), who married Alexander Jules de La Rochefoucauld (1796-1856), Duc d&#x27;Etissac. He has two grandsons : Roger, duc d’Estissac and Arthur, Comte de La Rochefoucauld (issues the Prince de La Rochefoucauld-Montbel (Dominique and his son Gabriel)). His grand daughter Thérèse married her cousin prince Marcantonio Borghese.

== Honors ==
* He is among the 660 people to have their names engraved under the Arc de Triomphe. It appears on the 15th column as DESSOLES.
* The principal pedestrian road of the historic centre of Auch is named in his honour (Rue Dessoles).

<doc id="923863" wikidata="Q675717" url="?curid=923863" title="Clactonian">
<text>The Clactonian is the name given by archaeologists to an industry of European flint tool manufacture that dates to the early part of the Hoxnian Interglacial (corresponding to the global Marine Isotope Stage 11 and the continental Holstein Interglacial) around 424–415,000 years ago. Clactonian tools were made by &quot;Homo heidelbergensis&quot;. The Clactonian is primarily distinguished from the (globally) contemporaneous Acheulean industry by its lack of use of handaxe tools.

It is named after finds made by Samuel Hazzledine Warren in a palaeochannel at Clacton-on-Sea in the English county of Essex in 1911. The artifacts found there included flint chopping tools, flint flakes and the tip of a worked wooden shaft, the Clacton Spear. Further examples of the tools have been found at sites including Barnfield Pit and Rickson&#x27;s Pit, near Swanscombe in Kent and Barnham in Suffolk; similar industries have been identified across Northern Europe. The Clactonian industry involved striking thick, irregular flakes from a core of flint, which was then employed as a chopper. The flakes would have been used as crude knives or scrapers. Unlike the Oldowan tools, some were notched, implying that they were attached to a handle or shaft. Retouch is uncommon and the prominent bulb of percussion on the flakes indicates use of a hammerstone.

Although in modern literature the term almost exclusively refers to finds in Britain, the term was historically used broadly for finds across much of the Old World. The distinctiveness of the Clactonian industry has been questioned, because its techniques are very similar to those of the Acheulean industry, and the use of handaxes is known in Britain both before (such as at the Boxgrove site) and after the Clactonian, with handaxes also suggested to be found at a number of Clactonian sites.

== Description ==
The Clactonian is described as a &quot;flake and core&quot; industry distinguished from the Acheulean from its lack of use of handaxes. The cores were used as choppers. The shapes of the lithic flakes do not follow a standard pattern. While historically the Clactonian industry was thought to have used stone only to create lithic artifacts, recent evidence has been found supporting the use of animal bones as soft hammers for stone knapping.

== History and controversy ==

The industry was first defined by Samuel Hazzledine Warren in 1926 based on finds at Clacton-on-Sea, England. In the early 20th century, the Clactonian and Acheulean industry were thought to be produced by two different lineages of humans, due to the perceived primitive nature of Clactonian stoneknapping. While some authors in the 1950s connected the Clactonian to the African Oldowan industry, this was later discarded once radiometric dating made it clear that Oldowan was far older than the Clactonian. 1950s authors suggested that the Clactonian may have been ancestral to the Acheulean industry in Britain. While some modern authors have supported this assertion, this has been disputed by other authors, who suggest that end of the Clactionian in Britain and the return of the use of handaxes was the result of a migration of a new population of hominins from the continent replacing the Clactonian producing hominins. It has been suggested by some authors that Clactonian may have originated from populations of hominins in the adjacent Rhineland area, who also did not use handaxes. Some authors have regarded the Clactonian as simply a regional variant of the Acheulean.

== Lifestyle ==
The Clactonian dates to the early part of the Hoxnian Interglacial (which correlates with the mainland European Holstein interglacial and the global Marine Isotope Stage 11), when Britain had a temperate deciduous forest environment and climate similar to that of Britain during the contemporary Holocene period. One of the most important Clactonian sites was found near Ebbsfleet, Kent, where a large straight-tusked elephant (&quot;Palaeoloxodon antiquus&quot;) skeleton was found associated with Clactonian stone tools, which are suggested to have been used to butcher the elephant. Evidence has also been found for the Clactonian butchery of fallow deer (&quot;Dama clactoniana&quot;).

<doc id="923868" wikidata="Q521823" url="?curid=923868" title="Hot Buttered Soul">
<text>Hot Buttered Soul is the second studio album by American soul musician Isaac Hayes. Released in June 1969, it is recognized as a landmark recording in soul music. Recorded with The Bar-Kays, the album features four lengthy tracks, including a 12-minute version of the Burt Bacharach/Hal David cover &quot;Walk On By&quot; and an almost 19-minute long version of Jimmy Webb&#x27;s &quot;By the Time I Get to Phoenix;&quot; both songs were edited significantly and released as a double A-side single in July 1969.

==Background==
Hayes&#x27; 1968 solo debut, &quot;Presenting Isaac Hayes&quot;, had been a poor seller for the record label Stax Records, and Hayes was about to return to his behind-the-scenes role as a producer and songwriter, when the label suddenly lost its entire back catalog after splitting with Atlantic Records in May 1968.

Stax executive Al Bell decided to release an almost-instant back catalog of 27 albums and 30 singles at once, and ordered all of Stax&#x27;s artists to record new material, encouraging some of Stax&#x27;s prominent creative staff, including Hayes and guitarist Steve Cropper, to record solo albums.

After feeling burned by the retail and creative flop of his first album, Hayes told Bell that he would not record a follow-up or any other album unless he was granted complete creative control. Since Bell had encouraged Hayes to record &quot;Presenting...&quot; in the first place, he readily agreed.

==Production==
Produced by Al Bell with Allen Jones and Marvell Thomas, the record was tracked by engineer Terry Manning at the Ardent Studios location on National Street in Memphis. The Bar-Kays were the tracking band, supplemented by pianist and co-producer Marvell Thomas (son of Rufus Thomas). Isaac Hayes played Hammond organ and sang the vocals live while conducting the tracking band at the same time. Much of the later production was done as part of the package of products brought to Detroit by producer Don Davis to expedite the production process. The strings and horns were arranged by Detroit arranger Johnny Allen and were recorded at United Sound Studios by engineer Ed Wolfrum with vocals and final mix at Tera Shirma by engineer Russ Terrana. The producers were looking for a sweeping orchestral sound that would enhance the rhythm tracks. The pre-delay reverberation technique, recorded in part by Terry Manning on the tracking session, had been used at Artie Fields productions in Detroit in late 1950s, and at Columbia Records; it was also used by Wolfrum and others for numerous productions and commercials previous and after the release of this project including Marvin Gaye&#x27;s &quot;What&#x27;s Going On&quot; project, with orchestration also recorded at United. Russ Terrana went on to the engineering staff of Motown Records and was responsible for the recording and mixing of many hits on that label.

==Reception==
The album was released in June 1969 and peaked at number 1 on the top R&amp;B chart, and at number 8 on the &quot;Billboard 200&quot;. The edited single version of &quot;Walk On By&quot; reached #30 on the &quot;Billboard Hot 100&quot;, and the edited single version of &quot;By The Time I Get To Phoenix&quot; reached #37 on the same chart.

Contemporary and retrospective reviews of the album were highly positive. AllMusic ranks &quot;Hot Buttered Soul&quot; as one of the best records of Hayes&#x27;s career, perhaps second only to 1971&#x27;s &quot;Black Moses&quot;, and said the album pioneered new developments in R&amp;B music for the 1970s. In 2020, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked the album at number 373 in their list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time.

American punk rock musician Henry Rollins has frequently referred to &quot;Hot Buttered Soul&quot; as one of his favorite albums. Rollins interviewed Hayes for his book &quot;Do I Come Here Often?&quot;

<doc id="923872" wikidata="Q1543947" url="?curid=923872" title="Quern-stone">
<text>Quern-stones are stone tools for hand-grinding a wide variety of materials, especially for various types of grains. They are used in pairs. The lower stationary stone of early examples is called a saddle quern, while the upper mobile stone is called a muller, rubber, or handstone. The upper stone was moved in a back-and-forth motion across the saddle quern. Later querns are known as rotary querns. The central hole of a rotary quern is called the eye, and a dish in the upper surface is known as the hopper. A handle slot contained a handle which enabled the rotary quern to be rotated. They were first used in the Neolithic era to grind cereals into flour.

== Design of quern-stones ==
The upper stones were usually concave while the lower ones were convex. Quern-stones are frequently identifiable by their grooved working surfaces which enabled the movement of flour. Sometimes a millrind was present as a piece of wood (or other material), which allowed the cereal etc. to be added but still acted as a centering device. The upper stone sometimes had a cup-shaped area around the hopper hole with a raised edge. Most handstones have a handle hole on the upper surface, but one class of quern-stones have a slot handle which indicates that a piece of wood was placed horizontally and protruded out from the edge so that the operator could turn the stone by standing and using a rod vertically. One class of upper quern-stones has from two to three sockets for the rod used to turn them and this is thought to reflect the need to reduce wear and tear by having alternative points of contact when in active use.

== Grain ==
Quern-stones have been used by numerous civilizations throughout the world to grind materials, the most important of which was usually grain to make flour for bread-making. They were generally replaced by millstones once mechanised forms of milling appeared, particularly the water mill and the windmill, although animals were also used to operate the millstones. However, in many non-Westernised, non-mechanised cultures they are still manufactured and used regularly and have only been replaced in many parts of the world in the last century or so.

The use of grinding stones for vegetal food processing, and possibly the production of flour, was widespread across Europe from at least 30,000 years ago.

In early Maya civilizations the process of nixtamalization was distinctive in that hard, ripe kernels of maize (corn) were boiled in water and lime, thus producing nixtamal which was then made into unleavened dough for flat cakes by grinding with a handstone on a quern (&quot;metate&quot;).

Quern stones were used in China at least 10,000 years ago to grind wheat into flour. The production of flour by rubbing wheat by hand took several hours. Due to their form, dimensions, and the nature of the treatment of the surfaces, they reproduce precisely the most ancient implements used for grinding cereal grain into flour. Saddle querns were known in China during the Neolithic Age but rotary stone mills did not appear until the Warring States Period. A prehistoric quern dating back to 23,000 BCE was found at the Longwangchan archaeological site, in Hukou, Shaanxi in 2007. The site is located in the heartland of the northern Chinese loess plateau near the Yellow River.

== Other materials ==
As well as grain, ethnographic evidence and Mesopotamian texts show that a wide range of foodstuffs and inorganic materials were processed using stone querns or mortars, including nuts, seeds, fruit, vegetables, herbs, spices, meat, bark, pigments, temper and clay. Moreover, one study analysing quern-stones noted that a number of querns had traces of arsenic and bismuth, unlike their source rocks, and had levels of antimony which were ten times higher than those of the rocks. The authors concluded that this was probably due to the use of these querns in the preparation of medicines, cosmetics, dyes or even in the manufacture of alloys.

Querns were widely used in grinding metals ores after mining extraction. The aim was to liberate fine ore particles which could then be separated by washing for example, prior to smelting. They were thus widely used in gold mining in antiquity.

In Shetland, tobacco was not smoked when first introduced, but instead was ground up into snuff, and inhaled up the nose. Snuff-querns consisted of an upper and lower stone, fixed together by a central iron pivot. The quern was held on the user&#x27;s lap, the eye of the quern was filled with dried tobacco leaves, and then the upper-stone was turned using the handle. The friction caused by the turning ground the leaves into a fine powder that built up around the edge of the lower-stone. Many snuff-querns had a small hole or cut made near the edge of the upper-stone, into which a pointed end of a lamb&#x27;s horn was placed in order to turn the stone; an alternative to using a handle.

== Incidental uses ==

Quern stones’ ubiquity led to ancillary uses. For example, DeBoer, in his review of the traditional gambling games of North American tribes, reports that one of the games involved bouncing a group of split canes off a quern.

Quern stones may have been used as improvised weapons, as mentioned in the Bible: &quot;But a certain woman threw an upper-millstone on Abimelech&#x27;s head, and crushed his skull.&quot; (Judg. 9:53 NRSV)

==Manufacture of quern-stones==
The best type of stone from which to manufacture quern-stones are igneous rocks such as basalt. These have naturally rough surfaces, but grains do not detach easily, so the material being ground does not become gritty. However, such rocks are not always available, meaning that quern-stones have been manufactured from a wide variety of rocks, including sandstone, quartzite and limestone. Quernmore Crag near Lancaster in England is named after the quarrying of millstone grit used to make quern stones in these parts. The names of the mountains of Whernside and Great Whernside in the Yorkshire Dales have the same origin.

Rutter was able to show, for the southern Levant, that basalt quern-stones were preferred to those manufactured from other rock types. Basalt quern-stones were therefore transported over long-distances, leading him to argue that, despite their everyday, utilitarian function, they were also used as a status symbol.

Research in Scotland has indicated that to a degree regional styles existed.
==Evolution of quern-stones==
Knocking stones were used in the preparation of small quantities of cereal, however the earliest forms of quern were the saddle and trough querns. The earliest quern so far discovered dates to and was found at Abu Hureyra, Syria. A later development was the rotary quern, which takes several forms.

===Saddle quern===
The saddle quern is produced by rocking or rolling the muller using parallel motions (i.e., pushing and pulling the handstone), which forms a shape looking like a saddle. These are the most ancient and widely used type of quern-stone and were superseded around the 5th to the 4th century BC by the more efficient rotary quern. The handstones for saddle querns are generally either roughly cylindrical (not unlike a rolling pin) and used with both hands, or rough hemispheres and used with one hand. This provides a crushing motion, not a grinding action and is more suitable for crushing malted grain. It is not easy to produce flour from a saddle quern with unmalted grain. The muller is also referred to as a &#x27;rubber&#x27; or &#x27;mouler&#x27;. Some pictorial examples may be found in the metate article.

===Rotary quern===

As the name implies, the rotary quern used circular motions to grind the material, meaning both the upper and lower quern were generally circular. The handstone of a rotary quern is much heavier than that of saddle quern and provides the necessary weight for the grinding of unmalted grain into flour. In some cases the grinding surfaces of the stones fit into each other, the upper stone being slightly concave and the lower one convex.
====Beehive quern====

In this type, the upper stone is hemispherical, or bun-shaped, with a central conical hopper to hold the grain that falls down a hole to the grinding surface. It is held in position with a pivot that fits into a central hole in the bottom stone. The upper stone also has a deep horizontal socket in its steep side in which to place the wooden peg used as a handle to rotate or oscillate the upper stone. This was the earliest type of rotary quern to appear in the British Isles. It arrived in Britain in the middle of the Iron Age (about 400–300 BC) and spread into the northern half of Ireland, probably from Scotland, some time after the 2nd century BC.

====Disc quern====
Disc querns consist of two flat disc-shaped stones, an upper stone with a cylindrical perforation for containing a handle and a lower stone with a central spindle hole. The adjustable, discoid rotary quern has larger, flatter and more discoid stones than the beehive type. The lower stone was completely perforated. The long handle rotated in a shallow socket in the upper surface of the upper stone. They are thought to have originated in Spain 2,500 years ago and appear to have arrived in maritime Scotland from about 200 BC with people who built the defensive homes known as brochs. This Iron Age type closely resembles the adjustable Highland quern still in use in historic times. In Ireland, disc querns were the dominant type of querns in use between the years 500 CE–1500 CE, and usually had a diameter of 30–60 cm.

Garnett in his 1800 tour of Scotland describes the use of a hand quern as follows:

====Miniature quern====
Under in diameter and varying from roughly dressed to carefully worked, often with vertical handle sockets, a new class of querns has been identified having been overlooked in the past as weights, etc. In all respects they are like full sized quern stones and they show the typical wear signs that indicate that they were used for grinding small amounts of seeds, minerals or herbs. A suggestion that they may have been made as toys is thought to be unlikely.

===Other types of quern stones===
Other forms of quern-stone include hopper-rubbers and Pompeian mills, both used by the Romans. The larger rotary mills were usually worked by a donkey or horse via an extension arm of wood attached to the upper stone.
Querns utilizing crank-and-connecting rods were used in the Western Han Dynasty.

==Laws against use==
There was a legal requirement in Scotland for tenants to pay for use of the baron&#x27;s mill. Early leases of mills gave to the miller the legal right to destroy quern-stones which were being used in defiance of thirlage agreements.

The obligations of thirlage eventually ceased to apply, but thirlage in Scotland was only formally and totally abolished on 28 November (Martinmas) 2004 by the Abolition of Feudal Tenure etc. (Scotland) Act 2000.

A similar obligation (the manorial right of mulcture) existed in England, established by custom only and not by statute. This was actively enforced using common law provisions. Among many recorded adjudications, the 1274 case of the abbot of St Albans Abbey, Cirencester, who owned as lord of the manor the exclusive milling rights for the whole town, is notable: he instructed his bailiffs to search townspeople&#x27;s homes and seize any quern-stones they found. Eventually the town brought a case against the abbott at the town assizes. They lost, and were ordered to pay the abbot 100 marks in compensation for defaming him. To celebrate his victory, the abbot then used the stones to pave the floor of his private parlour. 

Exercising the prerogative fell into gradual disuse and the last instance was in Wakefield, Yorkshire, when in 1850 the town bought out the owner of Soke Mill for .

==Ornament and inscription==

A number of handstones have been found with extra carving, however it is not always straightforward to separate decoration from practical functional purposes. The designs invest in the appearance of the handstone when it is in circular motion, and the ability of the quern-stones to change seeds into flour may invoke a feeling of transformative magic that attracted both reverence and status to these household objects. Three beehive querns found in Ireland have inscribed ornament of La Tène type, as do examples from England and Wales. Many of the horizontal slot-handled quern-stones have decoration that usually follows the basic pattern of motifs that encircle the hopper and/or the handle slot. One type though has an irregular pattern of cup marks that encircle the hopper.

A quern was discovered at Dunadd in Scotland that has a cross carved into the upper stone. The cross has expanded terminals and ultimately derives its form from Roman and Byzantine predecessors of the fifth and sixth centuries. This example has a high quality of finishing which reflects its &#x27;cost&#x27; and enhances its symbolic value and social significance. The cross is likely to have &#x27;protected&#x27; the corn and the resultant flour from evil, such as fungal rust or ergot. Various legends give miraculous power to mill-stones and several have been found which have been re-used in the construction of burial cists or as tomb stones. The association between quern stones and burial may be because they are used in the process of making bread, the staple of life. A broken or disused quern therefore can be seen as symbolic of death. In Clonmacnoise, near Athlone in County Offaly in Ireland, a quern stone was found which had been made into a tombstone, having been ornamented and the name Sechnasach, who died in 928 AD, inscribed onto it. A large quern was discovered on the Lough Scur crannog in Ireland.

==The Wondrous Mauchline Quern==
In the 9th century the Welsh monk Nennius wrote a history of Britain, the &quot;Historia Brittonum&quot;, in which he lists the thirteen wonders of Britain, and included in it is the wondrous &#x27;Mauchline Quern&#x27; that ground constantly, except on Sundays. It could be heard working underground and the local placename &#x27;Auchenbrain&#x27; may celebrate it, translating from the Gaelic as &#x27;field of the quern&#x27;.

<text>Otis Harris Jr. (born June 30, 1982, in Edwards, Mississippi) is an American track and field athlete. He won the silver medal in the 400 meters at the 2004 Summer Olympics.

Harris attended Hinds Agricultural High School in Utica, Mississippi, and collected several honors during his high school career, being named first team All-American just being one of them. He twice won the 400 meters in the junior Olympics and led his team to three state championships. In 2000 he enrolled at the University of South Carolina. As a Gamecock, he was a member of their 2002 NCAA championship relay team and finished as the runner-up in the 400 m in 2003.

At the 2004 Summer Olympics Harris won the silver medal in the 400 meters. He came in second in both of his qualifying runs before placing second to fellow US team member Jeremy Wariner in the final. Derrick Brew came in third and all three athletes together with Darold Williamson won a gold medal in the relay for the United States. One month later Harris finished third at the World Athletics Final.

Harris trains with his college coach Curtis Frye in Columbia, South Carolina. He has not run under 45 seconds since 2004, nor has he competed in a major international championship.

<text>The Château de Montségur (English: Castle of Montsegur; Languedocien: ) is a former fortress near Montségur, a commune in the Ariège department in southern France. Its ruins are the site of a razed stronghold of the Cathars. The present fortress on the site, though described as one of the &quot;Cathar castles,&quot; is actually of a later period. It has been listed as a by the French Ministry of Culture since 1862.

== Geography ==
The ruins of Montségur are perched at a precarious altitude in the south of France near the Pyrenees. Located in the heart of France&#x27;s Languedoc-Occitanie regions, southwest of Carcassonne, Montségur dominates a rock formation known as a &quot;pog&quot; — a term derived from the Languedocien dialect of Occitan — , meaning &quot;peak, hill, mountain.&quot; The top of the ruin is reached by a path and is 170 m above the road.

== History ==
The earliest signs of human settlement in the area date back to the Stone Age. Evidence of Roman occupation such as Roman currency and tools have also been found in and around the site. The name comes from Latin , which evolved into in Occitan, which means &quot;safe hill&quot;. In the Middle Ages the Montsegur region was ruled by the Counts of Toulouse, the Viscounts of Carcassonne and finally the Counts of Foix. Little is known about the fortification until the time of the Albigensian Crusade.

=== Cathar castle ===
In about 1204, Raymond de Péreille, one of the two lords of Montségur, the other being his cousin Pierre-Roger de Mirepoix, decided to rebuild the castle that had been in ruins for 40 years or more. Refortified, the castle became a center of Cathar activities, and home to Guilhabert de Castres, a Cathar theologian and bishop. In 1233 the site became &quot;the seat and head&quot; () of the Cathar church. It has been estimated that the fortified site housed about 500 people when in 1241, Raymond VII besieged Montsegur without success. The murder of representatives of the inquisition by about fifty men from Montsegur and faidits at Avignonet, on 28 May 1242, was the trigger for the final military expedition to conquer the castle, the siege of Montségur.

In 1242 Hugues de Arcis led the military command of about 10,000 royal troops against the castle that was held by about 100 fighters and was home to 211 Perfects (who were pacifists and did not fight) and civilian refugees. The siege lasted nine months, until in March 1244, the castle finally surrendered. Approximately 220 Cathars were burned en masse in a bonfire at the foot of the pog when they refused to renounce their faith. Some 25 actually took the ultimate Cathar vow of in the two weeks before the final surrender. Those who renounced the Cathar faith were allowed to leave and the castle itself was destroyed.

In the days prior to the fall of the fortress, several Cathars allegedly slipped through the besiegers&#x27; lines. This led to legends that they escaped with a secret treasure or esoteric knowledge. In 1906, esoteric French writer Joséphin Péladan proposed that the treasure was really the Holy Grail, arguing that Montségur was the Munsalväsche (or Montsalvat) of Wolfram von Eschenbach&#x27;s 13th-century Grail romance &quot;Parzival&quot;. This idea was followed and expanded upon by various later writers, especially in France, and has inspired legends, conspiracy theories, and fictional works associating the Cathars and Montségur with the Holy Grail.

===The later fortress===

The present fortress ruin at Montségur is not from the Cathar era. The original Cathar fortress of Montségur was entirely pulled down by the victorious royal forces after its capture in 1244. It was gradually rebuilt and upgraded over the next three centuries by royal forces. The current ruin so dramatically occupying the site, and featured in illustrations, is referred to by French archeologists as &quot;Montsegur III&quot; and is typical of post-medieval royal French defensive architecture of the 17th century. It is not &quot;Montsegur II,&quot; the structure in which the Cathars lived and were besieged, of which few traces remain today.
Montségur&#x27;s solar alignment characteristics, visible on the morning of the summer solstice in particular, are part of what set this castle apart as an architectural wonder. This often mentioned solar phenomenon, occurring in an alignment of two windows in the fortress wall, has been observed by hundreds of students, astronomers, spiritual pilgrims and locals alike who come to the chateau specifically to view it every year and has been recorded and included in the documentary &quot;The Otherworld,&quot; (by Richard Stanley) in 2013.
The Groupe de Recherches Archéologiques de Montségur et Environs (GRAME) (Archeological Research Group of Montsegur and Vicinity), which conducted a 13-year archeological excavation of Montségur with minimal funds and the technology available at the time in 1964–76, concluded in its final report, which was not widely published, is not viewed as solid archeological research, and is hotly disputed by many, that:

There remains no trace within the present-day ruins, neither of the first fortress which was abandoned before the 13th century (Montsegur I), nor of the one which was built by Raymond de Péreille around 1210 (Montsegur II)...&quot; (&quot;Il ne reste aucune trace dans les ruines actuelles ni du premier château qui était à l&#x27;abandon au début du XIIIe siècle (Montségur I), ni de celui que construisit Raimon de Pereilles vers 1210 (Montségur II)...&quot;)

This small quote is all that can be found of this study, and no other study has been done. Despite its questionable veracity and ethics, it has been repeated and quoted in virtually every document to be found on the subject.

The small ruins of the terraced dwellings, immediately outside the perimeter of the current fortress walls on the north-eastern flank are, however, confirmed to be traces of authentic former Cathar habitations.
