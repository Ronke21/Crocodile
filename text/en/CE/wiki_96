<text>The 1951 Asian Games, officially known as the First Asian Games (), was a multi-sport event celebrated in New Delhi, India from 4 to 11 March 1951. The Games received names like First Asiad, 1951 Asiad, and New Dehli 1951 (). A total of 489 athletes representing 11 Asian National Olympic Committees (NOCs) participated in 57 events from eight sports and discipline. The Games was the successor of the Far Eastern Games and the revival of the Western Asiatic Games. The 1951 Asiad were originally scheduled to be held in 1950, but postponed until 1951 due to delays in preparations. On 13 February 1949, the Asian Games Federation was formally established in Delhi, with Delhi unanimously announced as the first host city of the Asian Games.

The games were managed by a strong Organizing Committee (see Organization below).

Countries invited included almost all the independent Asian countries of the time except Soviet Union (as they were part of the European Olympic Committees) and Vietnam, due to the political structure of those nations.

National Stadium was the venue for all events. The official logo of the First Asiad depicted a bright sun in red with 16 rays and a white circle in the middle of the disc of the sun and eleven rings, representing each participating nation, on a white background, symbolising peace.

Japanese athletes won the 24 gold, 21 silver, and 15 bronze medals, respectively; while the host nation India had 15 golds and 51 overall medals with most bronzes (20) and finished at second spot in a medal table. The next Asian Games organised by India were the 1982 Asian Games, some 31 years later.

== History ==

The 1951 Asian Games are considered to be a successor of a small-scale multi-sport event known as the Far Eastern Games, held in between a period of 1913 to 1938 in the different cities of Japan, Philippines, and mainland China. The First Far Eastern Games took place in Manila, Philippines in 1913, after the efforts made by the Philippine Amateur Athletic Federation (PAAF). The Games were successfully organized for the next nine terms, but in September 1937, Japan invaded China after the Marco Polo Bridge Incident and started the Second Sino-Japanese War (which later became part of the World War II), thus the originally planned Games of 1938 in Osaka was cancelled and the Far Eastern Games were discontinued thereafter.

During the starting years of the 1930s, efforts were made to organize a multi-sport event to include the countries of West Asia too, this gave a birth to &quot;Orient Championship Games&quot;, which later renamed as Western Asiatic Games before its first inception. The scope of the Games comprised all the countries east of Suez and west of Singapore. The First Western Asiatic Games was celebrated in Delhi in 1934 at the Irwin Amphitheater, in which four countries—Afghanistan, British India, Palestine Mandate and Ceylon—participated. The decision was made to hold these Games once in four years at midpoint between the two successive Summer Olympics. The 1938 Western Asiatic Games were scheduled to be held in Tel Aviv, Palestine Mandate. However, the Games was cancelled due to the outbreak of World War II, and abandoned until 1951 Games, which also considered as the revival of Western Asiatic Games.

== Host city selection ==

On 12 and 13 February 1949, a meeting was organized at the Patiala House, in Delhi, in between the representatives of nine Asian National Olympic Committees. The framework of the meeting was set up in another meeting held on 8 August 1948 during the Second London Olympics, which was called by the Indian Olympic Committee&#x27;s representative Guru Dutt Sondhi. The meeting was chaired by Yadavindra Singh, president of the Indian Olympic Association. On the last day, Asian Games Federation (AGF) was formalized and a draft constitution was accepted. HRH Yadavindra Singh and Guru Dutt Sondhi were respectively elected as the first president and the secretary of the federation. The five charter members forming the federation were Afghanistan, Burma, India, Pakistan, and the Philippines. The decision was made to organize the Asian Games Championships in four-year intervals since the inception of the Games in Delhi in February, 1950. HRH Yadavindra Singh, who also became the president of the organization committee of Games sent the formal invitation to several other Asian countries to participate in the 1950 Asian Games.

== Venues ==

The venue for the 1951 Asian Games was the Irwin Amphitheater, a multi-purpose sport complex, the same venue which had hosted the 1934 Western Asiatic Games. Before the opening ceremony of the Games, the stadium was re-christened as the &quot;National Stadium&quot; and renovated for the facilities of different events of the Games. Every event with the exception of swimming and water polo was hosted under the premises of the main stadium only, the events of swimming and water polo were organised at the adjacent swimming pool within the premises of the complex.

The stadium was designed by Anthony S. DeMello and five-hundred thousand (500,000) rupees were required for the full construction, which was completed on 13 February 1933. The stadium was named after the Lord Irwin, 30th viceroy of India and the then Secretary of State for War.

== Events ==
The Games featured six sports: Athletics, aquatics—broken into Diving, swimming, and water polo disciplines—basketball, cycling—road cycling and track cycling—football, and weightlifting. The sports were broken down into 57 events. Many member countries of Asian Games Federation requested for the inclusion of boxing as a medal sport, but due to various reasons, boxing did not make the final list for the Games. Except athletics, women did not participate in any other event.

In the Games, &quot;Mr. Asia of 1951&quot; was also contested as the non-medal event. The contingents were judged on the basis of their physical development, looks, and personality. Parimal Roy of India won the event ahead of Mahmoud Namjoo of Iran, who won gold medal in the bantamweight category of weightlifting.

=== Aquatics ===
==== Diving ====
In diving, two medal events—3 m springboard and 10 m platform—were included. India and Iran were the only nations that achieved medals. Indian diver, K. P. Thakkar won both the golds and overall India won 4 medals. Iran bagged only one silver and one bronze.

==== Swimming ====
In swimming, five nations sent their swimmers to participate in 8 events, 5 of freestyle (100 m, 400 m, 800 m, 1500 m, and 4 × 100 m relay) and one of each backstroke (100 m), breaststroke (200 m) and medley (3 × 100 m). After these Games, 800 m freestyle and 3 × 100 m medley relay were removed from the swimming calendar of Asian Games. Singapore bagged half of gold medals and 2 silvers, while Philippines earned half of total medals including 3 golds, India finished with 6 total medals including one gold of Sachin Nag in 100 m freestyle, which was the first gold of India in Asian Games; two nations left without any medal.

In water polo, only two teams—India and Singapore—participated. The only match of the tournament decided the winner, in which the Indian team defeated Singapore with a goal difference of 6 to 4.

=== Athletics ===

Athletics was the only sport in which all the eleven participating nations sent their athletes. The Games featured 24 medal events for men and 9 for women. Japanese women won all the 9 golds of their events and just lost four silvers to India and Singapore, two for each. In men&#x27;s events, again Japan achieved highest number of golds with count of 11, but here Indian athletes finished just one medal behind to Japan with 10 golds. Toyoko Yoshino, a Japanese woman athlete, won all the golds in three throwing sports— shot put, discus throw, and javelin throw. Lavy Pinto of India was the only man who achieved multiple gold medals, he finished at the top podium in men&#x27;s 100 m and 200 m sprint running events.

=== Basketball ===

In basketball, five Asian teams—Burma, India, Iran, Japan, and Philippines—participated. In the matches, the round-robin format was employed and on the basis of final points table top three podium places were decided. Philippines team without losing a single match topped the points table and grabbed a gold medal, Japan team finished behind it and won a silver medal, Iranian team with two wins finished third and won a bronze. Host nation India, finished fourth with only single win over Burma, which came last without winning a single match.

Track cycling included—1000 m sprint, 1000 m time trial, and 4000 team-pursuit; for road cycling, 180 km individual road race was contested. The event was widely perceived as being dominated by Japan, who claimed 8 medals in total, including all the four golds out of 11 total overall medals and 4 golds. Indian cyclists won all the rest 3 medals as Burma and Iran failed to achieve a single one.

=== Football ===

In football, six Asian teams—Afghanistan, Burma, India, Indonesia, Iran, and Japan—participated. The gold medal was won by the Indian team, who defeated Iran 1–0 in the final. Japan defeated Afghanistan, 2–0 to win the bronze medal.

== Opening ceremony ==

On 4 March 1951, the First Asian Games were officially opened. The list of the guests included— India&#x27;s first President Rajendra Prasad, first Prime Minister of India Jawaharlal Nehru, cabinet members of Indian Government, diplomatic corps and representatives of participating Asian NOCs. The National Stadium was filled with an estimated 40,000 spectators. A 31-gun salute was fired from the ramparts of the Purana Quila, adjacent to the National Stadium, in the honour of guests and participants of first Asian Games. After a speech by the president of Asian Games Federation, HRH Yadavendra Singh, President Rajendra Prashad officially opened the Games.

Prime Minister Nehru presented his speech from which organisers of the Games adopted the official motto of the Games— &quot;Play the game, in the spirit of the game&quot;. Fifteen of the Indian army&#x27;s trumpeters with flags of eleven participating countries on their mastheads gave their performance. In an alphabetical order of English, athletes of the participating countries of the 1951 Asiad entered in the stadium with a march past, by following the custom of Olympics; India entered last as the host nation. The Lighting of the Cauldron was done by the 1924 Olympian of India, Dalip Singh with the help of Asian Games torch, which had been lit by the sun&#x27;s rays in the Red Fort. Afterwards, Baldev Singh, a member of the Indian athletics squad, recited the athlete&#x27;s oath on behalf of all competitors at the Games.

== Participating nations ==
The 1951 Asiad featured athletes representing 11 National Olympic Committees. The Organising Committee of the Games sent the formal invitations to almost all the Asian countries. China was invited, but did not respond before the closing dates for entries. Pakistan declined to participate because of the Kashmir conflict with India. South Korea attended the meeting of Olympic representatives of Asian countries, held on 8 August 1948, during the London Olympics and agreed to send athletes for Games to participate but did not send any because of the Korean War. The Soviet Union and Vietnam were not invited because of their political systems. Japan was neither invited to the 1948 Summer Olympics nor to attend the founding meeting of Asian Games Federation held in February 1949 in Delhi, but allowed to participate in these Games. Japan sent a 72-member strong team, the second largest after the host, and participated in all except aquatics events. Burma and India sent their contingents in all the events. Iran participated in all events, but did not send any female athletes.
Below is a list of all the participating NOCs; the number of competitors per delegation is indicated in brackets:

== Medal table ==
Athletes from eight participating NOCs won at least one medal, five of them winning at least one gold medal. Athletes from Japan earned the highest number of gold medals (24) and the most overall medals (60). Host nation India finished second with 15 golds and 51 overall medals as well as the most bronzes (20). Through 2010, it would be the best rank achieved by India in medal table in all succeeding Asian Games. Iran finished third with 8 golds and 16 overall medals. Three NOCs, Afghanistan, Nepal, and Thailand failed to earn any medals.
Singaporean swimmer Neo Chwee Kok earned the honour of winning the first gold medal in the history of the Asian Games. He won a total of four golds, all in the free style events (400m, 800m, 1500m, and 4 × 100m relay); becoming the most medalled athlete in this Games.

The ranking in this table is consistent with International Olympic Committee convention in its published medal tables. By default, the table is ordered by the number of gold medals the athletes from a nation have won (in this context, a nation is an entity represented by a National Olympic Committee). The number of silver medals is taken into consideration next, and then the number of bronze medals. If nations are still tied, equal ranking is given; they are listed alphabetically by IOC country code.

A total of 169 medals (57 gold, 57 silver and 55 bronze) were awarded. The total number of bronze medals is less than the total number of gold or silver medals because bronze medals were not awarded in water polo and the team pursuit event of track cycling.

<text>Santos Alomar Velázquez (, ; born June 18, 1966), known as Sandy Alomar Jr., is a Puerto Rican former professional baseball player, coach, and manager. He played in Major League Baseball as a catcher between 1988 and 2007, most notably as a member of the Cleveland Indians where he was a six-time All-Star player and won two American League pennants. Alomar was inducted into the Cleveland Indians Hall of Fame in 2009.

He also played for the San Diego Padres, Chicago White Sox, Colorado Rockies, Texas Rangers, Los Angeles Dodgers, and the New York Mets. He is the son of former major league player Sandy Alomar Sr. and the brother of Hall of Fame second baseman Roberto Alomar.

==Major league career==
Alomar was a highly regarded catcher in the San Diego organization after being named &quot;Baseball America&quot; Minor League Player of the Year in both 1988 and 1989, but he was blocked behind Benito Santiago at the Major League level. After two short call-ups with the Padres, he finally got his chance at an everyday job after being traded to Cleveland after the 1989 season along with Carlos Baerga and Chris James, in exchange for power-hitter Joe Carter. Once in Cleveland, he established his reputation as a skilled defensive player by becoming the first rookie catcher to start an All-Star game, as well as winning both Rookie of the Year honors and a Gold Glove Award. He became the third catcher in Major League history to win a Gold Glove Award in his rookie season, joining Johnny Bench and Carlton Fisk.
Alomar was selected as an All-Star in 1991 and 1992. However, his 1991 season was largely lost due to injuries, and he finished the year with no home runs and only seven RBIs in 199 at-bats. Over the next few years, Alomar suffered several injuries and failed to realize his potential. He came back strong in the first half of 1996 to make his fourth All-Star team, but then faded in the second half.

In 1997, everything finally came together for Alomar. He batted .324 and was the MVP of the All-Star game in his home ballpark (Jacobs Field), hitting a game-deciding two-run home run off Shawn Estes to the left field bleachers in the bottom of the seventh inning of a 3–1 American League win; he was the first player to hit an All-Star game home run in his home stadium since Hank Aaron in 1972. He also put together a 30-game hitting streak (one short of Nap Lajoie&#x27;s franchise record and four short of his former teammate Benito Santiago&#x27;s record for catchers), and helped lead Cleveland to their third straight postseason appearance. In the Division Series against the New York Yankees, Alomar hit .316 with two home runs, including a game-tying shot off Mariano Rivera in the eighth inning of Game 4. Though he was less effective against the Baltimore Orioles in the ALCS, he still provided a game-winning hit in the ninth inning of Game 4. The Indians lost the World Series to the Florida Marlins, but not on account of Alomar, who hit .367 with two home runs.

Although Alomar was selected to his sixth All-Star team in 1998, he turned in a mediocre season overall and then had injury problems again in 1999. Alomar was the unofficially recognized team leader of the Indians during their 1995–99 run when they won two pennants. He left the Indians as a free agent after the 2000 season and played in a limited role with the Chicago White Sox, Colorado Rockies, Texas Rangers, Los Angeles Dodgers, and New York Mets. On August 1, 2009, the Indians inducted Alomar to the organization&#x27;s Hall of Fame.

==Coaching career==

On February 15, 2008, Alomar was named the catching instructor for the New York Mets organization. He spent the 2008 and 2009 seasons in that role.

Alomar was hired in November 2009 as the first base coach on manager Manny Acta&#x27;s staff of the Cleveland Indians.

During the 2010 offseason, Alomar was rumored to be one of four finalists, along with Brian Butterfield, DeMarlo Hale, and John Farrell, for the Toronto Blue Jays managerial job.

During the end of the 2011 season, Alomar was rumored to be on the shortlist of candidates for the vacant Chicago Cubs and Boston Red Sox managerial positions. On September 28, 2011, Alomar was promoted by the Indians to the position of bench coach for the 2012 season. On September 27, 2012, the Indians promoted him to interim manager after firing Acta. He finished his interim reign with a record of three wins and three losses. On October 6, 2012, the Indians announced that the club had hired Terry Francona to take over as manager.

On October 31, 2012, the Cleveland Indians announced that Alomar would be back as the bench coach for the 2013 season under Francona. Alomar was replaced by Brad Mills as the bench coach and became their first base coach.

On August 2, 2020, Francona left the team due to gastrointestinal trouble and Alomar served as acting manager until Francona returned on August 9. Francona left the team again on August 18 to have surgery and Alomar served as the acting manager for the remainder of the season. In 46 games with Alomar acting as manager, the Indians went . The Indians were swept by the New York Yankees in the Wild Card Series.

<doc id="935302" wikidata="Q131672" url="?curid=935302" title="Fusarium">
<text>Fusarium (; ) is a large genus of filamentous fungi, part of a group often referred to as hyphomycetes, widely distributed in soil and associated with plants. Most species are harmless saprobes, and are relatively abundant members of the soil microbial community. Some species produce mycotoxins in cereal crops that can affect human and animal health if they enter the food chain. The main toxins produced by these &quot;Fusarium&quot; species are fumonisins and trichothecenes. Despite most species apparently being harmless (some existing on the skin as commensal members of the skin flora), some &quot;Fusarium&quot; species and subspecific groups are among the most important fungal pathogens of plants and animals.

The name of &quot;Fusarium&quot; comes from Latin &quot;fusus&quot;, meaning a spindle.

== Taxonomy ==
The taxonomy of the genus is complex. A number of different schemes have been used, and up to 1,000 species have been identified at times, with approaches varying between wide and narrow concepts of speciation (lumpers and splitters).

Phylogenetic studies seven major clades within the genus.

There is a proposed conceptwidely subscribed by specialiststhat would include essentially the genus as it now stands, including especially all agriculturally significant &quot;Fusaria&quot;. There is a counterproposal (unrelated to ) that goes far in the other direction, with seven entirely new genera.

=== Subdivision ===
Various schemes have subdivided the genus into subgenera and sections. There is a poor correlation between sections and phylogenetic clades.

Sections previously described include:

* &quot;Arachnites&quot;
* &quot;Arthrosporiella&quot;
* &quot;Discolour&quot;
* &quot;Elegans&quot;
* &quot;Eupionnotes&quot;
* &quot;Gibbosum&quot;
* &quot;Lateritium&quot;
* &quot;Liseola&quot;
* &quot;Martiella&quot;
* &quot;Ventricosum&quot;
* &quot;Roseum&quot;
* &quot;Spicarioides&quot;
* &quot;Sporotrichiella&quot;
=== Species ===
Selected species include:

* &quot;Fusarium acaciae&quot;
* &quot;Fusarium fujikuroi&quot;
* &quot;Fusarium acaciae-mearnsii&quot;
* &quot;Fusarium acuminatum&quot;
* &quot;Fusarium acutatum&quot;
* &quot;Fusarium aderholdii&quot;
* &quot;Fusarium acremoniopsis&quot;
* &quot;Fusarium affine&quot;
* &quot;Fusarium arthrosporioides&quot;
* &quot;Fusarium avenaceum&quot;
* &quot;Fusarium bubigeum&quot;
* &quot;Fusarium circinatum&quot;
* &quot;Fusarium crookwellense&quot;
* &quot;Fusarium culmorum&quot;
* &quot;Fusarium graminearum&quot;
* &quot;Fusarium incarnatum&quot;
* &quot;Fusarium langsethiae&quot;
* &quot;Fusarium mangiferae&quot;
* &quot;Fusarium merismoides&quot;
* &quot;Fusarium oxysporum&quot;
* &quot;Fusarium pallidoroseum&quot;
* &quot;Fusarium poae&quot;
* &quot;Fusarium proliferatum&quot;
* &quot;Fusarium pseudograminearum&quot;
* &quot;Fusarium redolens&quot;
* &quot;Fusarium sacchari&quot;
* &quot;Fusarium solani&quot;
* &quot;Fusarium sporotrichioides&quot;
* &quot;Fusarium sterilihyphosum&quot;
* &quot;Fusarium subglutinans&quot;
* &quot;Fusarium sulphureum&quot;
* &quot;Fusarium tricinctum&quot;
* &quot;Fusarium udum&quot;
* &quot;Fusarium venenatum&quot;
* &quot;Fusarium verticillioides&quot;
* &quot;Fusarium virguliforme&quot;
* &quot;Fusarium xyrophilum&quot;
== Pathogen ==

The genus includes a number of economically important plant pathogenic species.

&quot;Fusarium graminearum&quot; commonly infects barley if there is rain late in the season. It is of economic impact to the malting and brewing industries, as well as feed barley. &quot;Fusarium&quot; contamination in barley can result in head blight, and in extreme contaminations, the barley can appear pink. The genome of this wheat and maize pathogen has been sequenced. &quot;F. graminearum&quot; can also cause root rot and seedling blight. The total losses in the US of barley and wheat crops between 1991 and 1996 have been estimated at $3 billion.

&quot;Fusarium oxysporum&quot; f.sp. &quot;cubense&quot; is a fungal plant pathogen that causes Panama disease of banana (&quot;Musa&quot; spp.), also known as fusarium wilt of banana. Panama disease affects a wide range of banana cultivars, which are propagated asexually from offshoots and therefore have very little genetic diversity. Panama disease is one of the most destructive plant diseases of modern times, and caused the commercial disappearance of the once dominant Gros Michel cultivar. A more recent strain also affects the Cavendish cultivars which commercially replaced Gros Michel. It is considered inevitable that this susceptibility will spread globally and commercially wipe out the Cavendish cultivar, for which there are currently no acceptable replacements.

&quot;Fusarium oxysporum&quot; f. sp. &quot;narcissi&quot; causes rotting of the bulbs (basal rot) and yellowing of the leaves of daffodils (&quot;Narcissi&quot;).

In 2021 it was discovered that &quot;Fusarium xyrophilum&quot; was able to hijack a South American species of yellow-eyed &quot;Xyris&quot; grass, creating fake flowers, fooling bees and other pollinating insects into visiting them, taking fungal spores to other plants.

=== In humans ===
Some species may cause a range of opportunistic infections in humans. In humans with normal immune systems, fusarial infections may occur in the nails (onychomycosis) and in the cornea (keratomycosis or mycotic keratitis). In humans whose immune systems are weakened in a particular way, (neutropenia, i.e., very low neutrophils count), aggressive fusarial infections penetrating the entire body and bloodstream (disseminated infections) may be caused by members of the &quot;Fusarium solani&quot; complex, &quot;Fusarium oxysporum&quot;, &quot;Fusarium verticillioides&quot;, &quot;Fusarium proliferatum&quot; and, rarely, other fusarial species.

== Research ==
The isolation medium for &quot;Fusaria&quot; is usually peptone PCNB agar (peptone pentachloronitrobenzene agar, PPA). For &quot;F. oxysporum&quot; specifically, Komada&#x27;s medium is most common. Differential identification is difficult in some strains. Vegetative compatibility group analysis is best for some, is one usable method for others, and requires such a large number of assays that it is too complicated for yet others.

== Use as human food ==
&quot;Fusarium venenatum&quot; is produced industrially for use as a human food by Marlow Foods, Ltd., and is marketed under the name Quorn in Europe and North America.

&quot;Fusarium strain flavolapis&quot; is also produced as a human food by Nature&#x27;s Fynd under the name Fy in North America. It is used as a part of Le Bernardin menu in several dishes.

Some consumers of fusarium products have shown food allergies similar in nature to peanut and other food allergies. People with known sensitivities to molds should exercise caution when consuming such products.

== Biological warfare ==
Mass casualties occurred in the Soviet Union in the 1930s and 1940s when &quot;Fusarium&quot;-contaminated wheat flour was baked into bread, causing alimentary toxic aleukia with a 60% mortality rate. Symptoms began with abdominal pain, diarrhea, vomiting, and prostration, and within days, fever, chills, myalgias and bone marrow depression with granulocytopenia and secondary sepsis occurred. Further symptoms included pharyngeal or laryngeal ulceration and diffuse bleeding into the skin (petechiae and ecchymoses), melena, bloody diarrhea, hematuria, hematemesis, epistaxis, vaginal bleeding, pancytopenia and gastrointestinal ulceration. &quot;Fusarium sporotrichoides&quot; contamination was found in affected grain in 1932, spurring research for medical purposes and for use in biological warfare. The active ingredient was found to be trichothecene T-2 mycotoxin, and it was produced in quantity and weaponized prior to the passage of the Biological Weapons Convention in 1972. The Soviets were accused of using the agent, dubbed &quot;yellow rain&quot;, to cause 6,300 deaths in Laos, Kampuchea, and Afghanistan between 1975 and 1981. The &quot;biological warfare agent&quot; was later purported to be merely bee feces, but the issue remains disputed.

==Pest==
Fusarium has posed a threat to the ancient cave paintings in Lascaux since 1955, when the caves were first opened to visitors. The caves subsequently closed and the threat subsided, but the installation of an air conditioning system in 2000 caused another outbreak of the fungus which is yet to be resolved.

==Microbiota==
Fusarium may be part of microbiota including digestive as well as oral/dental, there have been rare cases of Fusariosis presenting as a necrotic ulceration of the gingiva, extending to the alveolar bone has been reported in a granulocytopenic patient.

<doc id="935303" wikidata="Q1042011" url="?curid=935303" title="Night Watch (Lukyanenko novel)">
<text>Night Watch () is a fantasy novel by the Russian author Sergei Lukyanenko, the first to feature his fictional world of &quot;The Others&quot;. The book was first published in Russia by AST in 1998. The story revolves around a confrontation between two opposing supernatural groups (known as &quot;Others&quot;): the Night Watch, an organization dedicated to policing the actions of the Dark Others—and the Day Watch, which polices the actions of the Light Others.

The novel is first in a cycle that continues with &quot;Day Watch&quot;, &quot;Twilight Watch&quot; (also known as &quot;Dusk Watch&quot;), &quot;Last Watch&quot; (also known as &quot;Final Watch&quot;), &quot;New Watch&quot;, and &quot;Sixth Watch&quot;. The first story of the novel, &quot;Destiny&quot;, was made into a successful Russian film, &quot;Night Watch&quot;, which, although keeping the characters and many of the events of the original novel, alters some significant elements of the story.

==Background==
In the story&#x27;s worldline, there exists a magical realm beneath the surface of all things—referred to as the Twilight (or &quot;Gloom&quot; in other translations). The action in the novel centers on a group of people referred to as &quot;the Others&quot; —human beings who tapped into the Twilight and gained supernatural abilities. &quot;The Others&quot; were the humans (shamans, soothsayers, and wisemen) from long ago who figured out how to step into the Twilight. However, &quot;the Others&quot; are different from humans, they are born as &quot;Others&quot;. Humans are not able (at least in the first part of the cycle) to become &quot;Others&quot;. The Twilight does not offer its gifts freely; it feeds off the strength of those &quot;Others&quot; who enter it. If sufficiently weakened, they are consumed, never to return to the ordinary world. The aura of any Other, or emotional state at the time of their first entry into the Twilight, determines whether or not the Other will become a &#x27;Light&#x27; or &#x27;Dark&#x27; Other. Furthermore, once determined either Light or Dark, an Other must choose what specific powers they will borrow from the Twilight. Variations such as vampires, magicians, and healers are all possible, each with their own benefits and restrictions. Often, the choice is made by the state of mind but if choosing Light or Dark during Initiation, a Watch can attempt to steer the powers of someone into what they need at the time. &quot;Initiation&quot; refers to the process of an Other choosing not Light or Dark but choosing to officially be a part of the Night Watch (Light Others) or Day Watch (Dark Others). An Other can exist without being initiated as part of a Watch, still independently capable of entering the Twilight and becoming Light or Dark. The choice of becoming light or dark, even what specific powers you gain is usually final.

The division of Light and Dark had always existed between &quot;the Others&quot;. Those of the Light believed it was their duty to help the weak and the helpless. Those of the Dark shunned all obligations. They did what they wanted, regardless of morals and consequences. For many millennia, the two sides fought a vicious battle. Both were willing to use any means necessary to achieve victory. Eventually they realized that if they continued their battle, neither side would survive. The leaders of both sides forged the Grand Treaty—a set of laws to govern the way &quot;the Others&quot; used their powers. The Light Others created the Night Watch, the Dark Others the Day Watch, to ensure that neither side would violate the Treaty. The Inquisition, a group composed of both Dark and Light Others, was created to arbitrate.

If they spend them too quickly, &quot;the Others&quot; can use the feelings and emotions of the humans surrounding them to recharge their powers. &quot;The Dark Others&quot; use negative emotions such as pain or anger, &quot;the Light Others&quot; use positive emotions such as joy. Feeding on pain causes pain to increase, feeding on joy causes joy to wane. Because negative emotions are much easier to achieve in humans, this arrangement creates a situation where the powers of the Dark Others are easier to recharge and are much more readily available than those of the Light Others.

Since the signing of the Treaty, the Night Watch and the Day Watch have kept their eyes on each other, diligently policing every violation. The old leaders continue to plot, using humanity and the Others as their pawns. Only time will tell which side will prevail.

==Structure and style==
The novel is divided into three stories - &quot;Destiny&quot;, &quot;Among His Own Kind&quot;, and &quot;All for My Own Kind&quot;. Each story is subdivided into a prologue followed by eight chapters in the first story, and seven chapters in each of the following stories. Except for the prologues, the majority of the events in each story are written in a first person narrative using the voice of the Light Magician character Anton Gorodetsky, a member of the Night Watch. Events in each of the prologues, as well as intermittent other events in the stories, are written in a third person narrative and take place entirely outside of Gorodetsky&#x27;s presence. The entire novel is written in the past tense.

==Plot==

=== Destiny ===
A Mage, recently reassigned to field work in the Night Watch, Anton Gorodetsky, is tasked with tracking vampires who have been hunting and killing humans without a licence. As he follows a young boy (Egor), who has been magically lured by two vampires through the Metro, he notices a young woman, Svetlana, who has a huge vortex of damnation above her. Trying to free her from the vortex he uses up the power of an amulet he has been given to use against the vampires, but only succeeds in temporarily reducing the curse upon her. He finds the vampires who have been calling Egor, and in the struggle to arrest them, because he has used up the amulet trying to do good elsewhere, is forced to kill one while the other (a female) gets away.

He returns to the Night Watch headquarters, where his boss, Boris Ignatievich, informs him that he could be in danger as Zabulon (head of the Day Watch) might want revenge for his actions in killing Dark Others and gives him an owl called Olga, to be his Watch partner. Anton initially rejects the offer, then finds Olga in his apartment and reluctantly agrees. The next day he carelessly and illegally uses his powers for good (by changing a person&#x27;s morality, a spell called &quot;remoralization&quot;) and clashes with a Dark Other from the Day Watch, Alisa Donnikova. They agree that Alisa can use her power to do a minor evil act of her choice in compensation for his own act of goodness. As events unfold he discovers that Olga can speak and appear briefly as a human, and is a sorceress trapped in an owl&#x27;s body as a punishment.

Anton goes to Egor&#x27;s apartment to protect him from the vampire, then nearly loses him as Egor inadvertently slips into the Twilight for the first time. It transpires he is also an Other, with the potential for magical powers himself. Meanwhile, Boris Ignatievich sends an incubus, Ignat, to the cursed woman, Svetlana Nazarova, as an undercover agent to try to help her and discover who could have cursed her, but to no avail. Anton, who is still involved in trying to calm Egor and persuade him to join the forces of light, is urgently called away to assist with Svetlana, and in the meantime, the vampiress again calls to Egor who joins her on the roof.

Anton manages to find out that Svetlana is another unaware Other who had unknowingly cursed herself because of guilt for something she did to her mother, and manages to defuse the situation. He returns to Egor&#x27;s roof to find the vampiress and Egor, as well as other Light and Dark operatives, including Anton&#x27;s neighbour, Kostya Saushkin, who is a vampire. Zabulon joins them and attacks Anton. But when he does, one of the minor Light Mages, Ilya, reveals himself to be Boris, who&#x27;d swapped their bodies, and blocks Zabulon&#x27;s efforts. While Zabulon&#x27;s plans seem compromised, and Egor is still considering his choice for Light or Dark, Alisa uses her agreement with Anton to perform a spell on him making him tell Egor everything. Anton reveals to Egor that he was a pawn used by both Boris Ignatievich and Zabulon in their intrigues. Angered, Egor leaves the roof, feeling misused but veering towards the dark.

=== Among His Own Kind ===

A Dark Other, Galina Rogova, is killed by Maxim, a mysterious murderer using an enchanted wooden dagger, referring to himself as &quot;The Judge&quot;. Boris Ignatievich announces that the Day Watch suspects one of the Night Watch operatives of this and previous murders. Everyone seems to have an alibi except Anton. Boris Ignatievich thinks that Anton has been set up by the Day Watch, and uses his powers to swap Anton and Olga&#x27;s bodies so that anyone tracking him will be misled about his true whereabouts, and ensure any future murders will take place when he has a firm alibi. In Olga&#x27;s body, Anton then goes with Svetlana to her apartment to hide, where he reveals that he is in fact Anton, making Svetlana furious as she just told &quot;Olga&quot; she loved Anton.

They go to a restaurant so as to have clear witnesses of their whereabouts and there spot an inoffensive Dark Other with his family. The Dark Other goes to the toilet, where Maxim was waiting and kills him. Anton, curious why the Dark Other had not returned from the toilet, briefly leaves Svetlana and discovers the body. An investigation ensues involving police and both Dark and Light forces, where Svetlana is able to give Boris a telepathic image of Maxim&#x27;s wife&#x27;s aura, but is unable to recall Maxim, who had also been dining in the restaurant. Zabulon recognises Anton in Olga&#x27;s body, charging him with the murder. Anton flees, pursued by Zabulon and grabs a lift from a passing car whose driver sees the magical events as a gangland shooting. What Anton doesn&#x27;t know is that the couple in the car are Maxim and his wife. Walking home, Anton calls Olga and asks to switch back bodies.

Waiting in the subway for Olga, Anton stumbles upon Egor and has a brief conversation with him. Olga arrives and Anton and Olga switch bodies using an incantation that reveals Boris&#x27;s real name as Gesar. While talking to Olga, Anton realizes that the Day Watch is only chasing him in order to make Svetlana angry and use her powers illegally, which would allow them to use the law to neutralize her as an agent of Light. There is no crime in the Dark eliminating its own agents, only if the light does so. Anton then takes a ride in the metro where he is chased by a dark other. An apparition indicates that he should go to the Ostankino Tower, but Anton cannot tell whether it means to help or harm him. He kills the Dark mage chasing him and disguises himself as the mage. Arriving at the tower he finds that the Day Watch has established their temporary headquarters there. Secretly penetrating inside, he sees a bunch of incompetent Dark mages directing the search for him. Suspicious that Zabulon is taking revenge on him by setting him up still more, he leaves the tower and goes to Egor&#x27;s house.

Meanwhile, Maxim feels the presence of a Dark being and goes on a hunt. He finally finds the Dark being and is astonished when he discovers it is young Egor. Anton spots them and talks with Maxim, explaining the Treaty between Light and Dark, but Maxim doesn&#x27;t comply, pointing out that Egor will grow up to be a dark mage, and it&#x27;s better to kill him now. Anton intervenes when Maxim tries to kill Egor, and they fight in the Twilight. Anton realizes that killing Maxim would mean that all witnesses proving his innocence would be dead, and is stabbed by Maxim. Gesar then comes over and suggests that Maxim should become a member of the Inquisition, and when Anton brags about how he outwitted Zabulon again, Gesar reveals that Zabulon has nothing to do with it and that all of this was planned by the Night Watch to raise Svetlana&#x27;s magical level.

=== All for My Own Kind ===
An old man arrives from Uzbekistan and is intercepted by a team of Dark Others led by Alisa, who attacks him thinking he possesses a coveted artifact. As they fight, his son slips away unnoticed with the artifact.

All of the Night Watch operatives go to Tiger Cub&#x27;s house to relax, but Anton doesn&#x27;t manage to have fun, as he is concerned with Svetlana&#x27;s growing powers influencing their relationship and the reason Gesar sent them off. He finally leaves, and when he gets back to his apartment, he discovers Zabulon calmly reading a newspaper and waiting for him. Zabulon reveals that Alisher, the young man from Uzbekistan, brought with him an artifact, a piece of chalk. Anton&#x27;s research suggests that it is the Chalk of Fate and that it could be used by the Light to rewrite destiny, allowing someone to change the world to establish a new world order. Discussions with Olga and later Gesar reveal that Svetlana in fact is to use the Chalk to rewrite a destiny.

Walking outside, Anton drains the Light power from all of the passers-by he sees, taking their joy away. Anton joins Gesar, Svetlana, Zabulon, Egor, and Maxim on a rooftop where Svetlana prepares to rewrite a destiny, while a storm is gathering around them. Svetlana then opens the book of destiny. Gesar supposes Anton could use all the energy he has drained to stop the storm, but Anton uses it instead on himself via a simple remoralization spell. Astonished, Svetlana stops rewriting Egor&#x27;s destiny and asks Anton for advice, but Anton says that she must decide what to write herself. The Book disappears, and Gesar notices she didn&#x27;t write anything, she only erased things. Egor reverts from a potential Dark Other back to an unaffiliated state. Zabulon notices that their planned operation failed because of Svetlana&#x27;s indecisiveness and, triumphant, leaves. Anton then notices the Chalk Svetlana used is not whole. Gesar reveals that Svetlana rewriting Egor&#x27;s destiny was just a distraction, and in the meantime, Olga rewrote the destiny of someone later revealed. Gesar reveals the true nature of this plan was to save his love of Olga. Without her full powers, their love was doomed.

== Races ==
Within the Night Watch universe there are several different races with different characteristics and levels of power.

*Magicians Magicians of low levels are very common among both the Light side and Dark Others. Magicians may specialize in the power of Foresight, Healing, Cursing and Hexing, Battle Magic, or any number of other abilities. Powerful magicians are known to live abnormally long lives. Gesar, Anton, Semyon, Alisher, Ilya, Garik, Tolik and Zabulon are magicians of various levels.
*Enchantress/Sorceress Terms for a female magician, such as Olga, Svetlana and Yulia. Svetlana comments that the difference between enchantresses and witches lies in the way their powers manifest – witches use charms, rhymes and various external aids to work their magic, whereas enchantresses use gestures and incantation to direct Twilight power. A witch is harmless if she is stripped naked and her body is shaved, whereas to render an enchantress harmless requires gagging her and tying her hands.
*Shapeshifters Shapeshifters can change into animal form, often used for magical battle. Shapeshifters seem to choose one animal type for their transformations, such as a cat, lizard, bear, etc. Shapeshifters are found in both Light and Dark Others, although the term shapeshifter is usually used for Dark Others, whereas many Light Others prefer the term &#x27;transformer magician&#x27;. They can only shapeshift into one specific species of their chosen animal unlike Bear and Tiger Cub who are magicians that turn into any species of bear and tiger respectively. There is essentially little difference between shapeshifters and transformer magicians, other than the side they are on – Semyon remarks that if Tiger Cub had been in a different mood the day she first entered the Twilight, she would have become a Dark Shapeshifter rather than a Light Battle Magician.
*Vampires Vampires are considered Low Others, and especially disrespected among their fellow Dark Others. Vampires can be born or turned, but all are undead and soul-less. All vampires are born with a hunger for blood; some choose to drink only donated blood but hunting licenses for humans can be obtained. They are able to eat normal human food, but it is tasteless to them. They can go out in daylight, but they do not like strong sunlight. Male vampires can only father one child. Kostya and his parents are vampires.
*Werewolves The Dark subspecies of Shapeshifters. Large, hairy canine forms of human legend, they possess a brutal strength and formidable teeth and claws. Their abilities are not impacted by the full moon, but they receive high increases in power in intervals of roughly one month (the onset of which they are said to be able to &#x27;sense&#x27; around twelve or so hours before it happens). During this time, they are much more susceptible to the Twilight and may refuse to revert to human form, a condition known as Lunacy.
*Incubus/Succubus A type of Other who possess extreme charisma and sexual appeal, which is their main ability. Ignat is an incubus, although as a Light Other, he uses his ability on Gesar&#x27;s orders.
*Witch Witches differ from magicians in that they do not draw power directly from the Twilight, instead they create artifacts which slowly accumulate large amounts of power over time. This is an advantage and a disadvantage. If a witch wishes to move to the higher levels of power, she must sacrifice the youthful appearance enchantresses maintain (though they may use illusion to appear however they wish).
*Devona A human of extremely low intelligence whom a powerful magician invests with large amounts of power in order to make them a servant. Alisher&#x27;s father was a devona created by Gesar. It is not a socially acceptable status for the individual concerned, who often finds himself shunned and rejected.
*Golem Creature created from various materials (e.g. clay, wood, metal) by a magician for a particular purpose, such as guarding.
*Warlock A male Witch (Dark Other).

== The Twilight (The Gloom) ==
Note: Bromfield&#x27;s English translation translates the Russian word &quot;sumrak&quot; as &quot;twilight&quot;, although &quot;sumrak&quot; actually refers to a state of coming darkness in singular (visible in one place, not the whole sky); &quot;sumerki&quot;, which would usually be translated as &quot;twilight&quot;, is its plural form. &quot;The gloom&quot; is the translation used in the movies based on the novel. Note that the Russian word sumrak does not have the negative emotional connotation of the English word gloom; sumrak has a lighter connotation, characterised by Nabokov as a &quot;not infrequently pleasurable and poetical gloom.&quot; One can only assume why the translator dismissed closer in connotation the &quot;dusk&quot; and &quot;dim&quot; .

=== Properties ===
The Twilight, although a realm of existence beneath the human or ordinary world and therefore not sentient, indiscriminately absorbs energy from whoever enters it. An Other enters the Twilight by stepping into their own shadow, it then starts to drain their strength. The only way to survive in the Twilight is to slowly feed it energy. The skill required to stay (or even enter) into the Twilight for an extended period of time is acquired through formal training. Others who lack this skill yet still manage to enter the Twilight are at an increased risk of being completely drained of their life and energy.

The nature of Twilight is not fully elucidated in the first novel. It is composed of seven levels, each layer requires geometrically more power to enter and remain in. Each layer is quite different from the layer above it. Most powerful Others can&#x27;t make it past the 3rd layer, a higher magician can penetrate down to the 5th layer. A Magician beyond classification such as Gesar or Zabulon can get to the 6th layer. Only a zero point magician can get to the 7th. Zero point magicians have come into being only once every thousand years or so.

There are stories of magicians who have been lost to the Twilight either because they exhausted their energy in battle (within the Twilight), or because they were careless. Novices have also been lost to the Twilight because they have allowed it to take too much energy; they lack the skill to &quot;feed&quot; the Twilight. Some greatly powerful Others decide to fade into Twilight when they have grown tired of the world.

&quot;Regular&quot; laws of physics, that is, the laws of physics present in the ordinary (human) world do not apply in the Twilight. Unless enchanted, physical objects can only affect beings on the first level. A nuclear blast extends all the way down, through every level. This is why the Watches have done everything in their power to prevent nuclear wars.

Others&#x27; auras have color in the Twilight as do their emotions and the magic that they manifest. The colors present in or around an Other in the Twilight can be read in order to gauge their feelings.

The Twilight imbues the Others with most of their magical powers. It is also responsible for giving them their unnaturally (in human terms) long lives. Due to the Twilight, Others can live to be hundreds, possibly even thousands, of years old. This is because, unlike regular humans, they absorb rather than produce magic. The process of absorbing magic also extends their life. The more powerful the Other the less magic they produce, and the more they must absorb from regular humans.

The Others have a twilight form that they can take on in or out of the Twilight. Most Dark Others take on the form of a demon like figure. Zabulon takes on the form of a red, rock-skinned demon with horns and a tail, also with slits for eyes and a forked tongue. Many Light Others take the form of white glowing Angels.

=== Levels ===
The Twilight itself is divided into several levels. Each level is harder to get to and accessible only to powerful Others; this is due in large part to the fact that the Twilight drains energy much more quickly and greedily in deeper levels. In order to access the lower levels of the Twilight, an Other must step through their shadow at each successive level.

At the first level the Twilight is a gray or sepia-toned version of the human world where time runs much more slowly than in the human world; this means that you can do more in the Twilight in less time than it would take in the human world. In this level remnants of the human world still exist and can be seen. For instance, humans can be seen but they are sepia-toned and are moving at a much slower rate due to the time difference between the two realms. This level is inhabited by a parasite, a blue moss feeding on energy, which doesn&#x27;t seem to do any harm to those who enter the Twilight, and is easy to eradicate. Contrary to what we see in the movie, there are no mosquitoes in this level of Gloom.

The second level is even less like the human world—all human buildings and people disappear, but all magically built buildings change into a different version of itself. It is described as being darker, and having a consistency that is comparable to clouds. There are also three moons.

The third and deeper levels are not explored in the first book.

=== Inhabitants ===
The Twilight is accessible only to Others (both living and dead), particular magical objects, and certain animals. Others access the Twilight by raising their shadow, increasing its volume and density, then stepping through it.

As mentioned before, particular magical objects can enter the Twilight. However, it is not so much that they can enter the Twilight as that they exist on multiple levels of reality. For example, a copper amulet in the human world may be seen existing in the Twilight as a small ball of fire.

&quot;Night Watch&quot; hinted that animals do not always follow the same rules as humans or Others when it comes to the Twilight. In the first book of &quot;Night Watch&quot; entitled &quot;Story One: Destiny&quot;, Anton explains that &quot;For cats there is no [human] world or Twilight—they live in all the worlds at once.&quot;

There is only one natural inhabitant in the Twilight, a dark blue moss that grows along many surfaces of the sepia-toned human world in the first level of the Twilight. It feeds off of the emotional energy of Others who enter into the Twilight and of humans in the ordinary world. There is a theory mentioned in the books that states that large colonies of dark blue moss can unbalance the human psyche and cause psychosis but it has not been proven. Nonetheless, the protagonist of the &quot;Night Watch&quot;—Anton—occasionally feels compelled to utilize magic to burn off the blue moss at points in the story.

=== Mysteries ===
The Twilight is still largely an unknown. This may be because there are very few truly powerful magicians who can successfully navigate its levels. &quot;Night Watch&quot; mentions that the deepest levels have been navigated by Zabulon (see character descriptions below) but at the cost of great energy expenditure even to him.

When an Other dies of natural causes, is killed, or dematerialised (executed) their &quot;soul&quot; or &quot;essence&quot; is passed into the Twilight where it remains for all eternity. Since Others are &#x27;born&#x27; in the Twilight it would make sense for them to return there upon their death but the reason for this is never stated in &quot;Night Watch&quot;. They become spectral-like figures, cloudy silhouettes of their former physical selves. It remains a mystery whether or not they retain any memory or feeling as they hardly communicate with living Others who enter the Twilight.

In the second part of the Night Watch, what is assumed to be a dematerialised Other in the Twilight seemingly communicates with Anton as it points him towards the TV tower where the Day Watch has set up its field headquarters as it searches for Anton (who is being framed for killing Dark Others). Anton is unsure if it is a dematerialised Other, or if it is simply a part of a trap put into place by Zabulon.

== Characters ==

=== Light Others ===
*Anton Gorodetsky (Light Mage): the main character of the novel (most of the novel is written in the first-person from his point of view), he is a reluctant member of the Night Watch. In the beginning of the first book, he prefers mundane, technical jobs to actual field work. The events of the series force him to step up and become a full-fledged operative. They also make him considerably more cynical about the cause of the Light Others. His favorite pastime is listening to randomly arranged custom mini-discs. He is a fifth level mage at the beginning of the first novel, but later becomes a second level magician and eventually a Grand Mage. He possesses a pistol with silver bullets for protection from vampires and werewolves.
*Boris Ignatievich/Gesar (Grand Light Mage): an ancient mage of Tibetan descent who taught a number of heroes and philosophers during his lifetime. He moved to Europe during the early 15th century. Although he has had many opportunities to advance to high-level posts within Night Watch, he chose to remain a Regional Director of the Moscow division (the Moscow division is the de facto head of all other former USSR divisions). Gesar is a battle-hardened tactician who has been known to turn devastating defeats into small victories. He cares a great deal about his subordinates, though he does not hesitate to put them in harm&#x27;s way for the sake of the greater good. His mage level is Beyond Classification (i.e. does not fit into the 1–7 scale).
*Svetlana (Grand Light Sorceress): a young doctor who is not aware of her powers at the beginning of the novel, a victim of a plot by Zabulon to kill her before she joins the Night Watch. Her power is discovered when she inadvertently curses herself; Svetlana&#x27;s powers are so strong that the curse develops into an enormous vortex that threatens to unleash the Inferno and destroy Moscow. She enters into a relationship with Anton which becomes strained as Svetlana&#x27;s powers continue to increase exponentially.
*Olga (Grand Light Sorceress): an old friend and an occasional lover of Geser who was turned into an owl for breaking obligations she had to the Light. She was allowed to change back to her human form during wartime, for half an hour every day. Thanks to Geser&#x27;s manipulations, she was restored to her human form and regained her powers by the end of &quot;Night Watch&quot;.
*Semyon (Light Mage): a crusty, experienced mage with a wryly cynical outlook on the world. Unlike many of his fellow mages, he is a capable fighter even without his magic. Unlike most mages, he is capable of &quot;reading&quot; people the same way a normal person would—by body language, as opposed to magic.
*Tiger Cub/Katya (Shifter-Mage): a young, playful mage with a penchant for jewels and amulets. She is highly regarded both by Dark and Light Others. It is said that she can charm anyone. As the name implies, she shapeshifts to tiger as her preferred animal form. She has a large house riddled with secret passages and guarded by dogs trained to attack Others (normally animals are afraid of Others). She can be rather impulsive, which gets her in trouble on several occasions.
*Bear (Shifter-Mage): a reclusive, quiet mage known for his calculated, brutal tactics. It has been continuously speculated that he was originally a Dark Other, despite the well-known fact that once the choice is made, the Others can not change sides. His preferred animal form is a large polar bear. He is frequently partnered with Tiger Cub.
*Ignat (Light Incubus/Succubus): a self-absorbed mage with &quot;[the] face of a Hollywood actor and [the] body of a Greek god&quot;. He prides himself on being able to bed any woman (or man). As a result, he takes failure very hard.
*Garik (Light Mage): a shy mage infamous for his bad luck with women. His father is a Dark Other.
*Igor (Light Mage): an idealistic mid-level mage. Despite his youthful appearance, he was born in the late 1920s. He is dedicated to the cause of Light Others, though his refusal to compromise his principles has occasionally caused problems.
*Yulia (Light Mage): a smart young girl who works at the Night Watch as an analytical sorceress. Yulia admires Tiger Cub.
*Ilya (Light Mage): a first-level mage who swapped bodies with Geser in &quot;Story One: Destiny&quot; to trick Zabulon. He is said to be a powerful mage. He wears glasses.

=== Dark Others ===
*Zabulon (spelled Zavulon in the English subtitles in the film version; the spelling &quot;Zabulon&quot; reflects the Old Testament source of the name) (Grand Dark Mage): an ancient schemer about the same age as Gesar. He runs the Day Watch in Moscow and his plans frequently involve misdirection and hidden agendas. His power seems to rival that of Gesar, but he is often outwitted, if not overpowered, by Gesar. His true form has taken on demonic characteristics because he has spent a great deal of time in the Twilight. His chosen human appearance is often misleading, as he appears as a thin intellectual who does not seem to be a threat to those who do not know him.
*Alisa Donnikova (Dark Witch): a young witch with a penchant for mischief and discreet mind manipulation. She was Zabulon&#x27;s lover until the end of the novel.
*Kostya (Konstantin Saushkin) (young Vampire): a young, idealistic vampire living above Anton, whose family Anton befriended even before he had become an Other. Anton&#x27;s actions during the first part of &quot;Night Watch&quot; drive a wedge between them.

=== Unaffiliated ===
*Maxim (Inquisitor): a middle-class Light Other whose powers emerged before Night Watch could find him. Feeling compelled to seek out evil, he hunted and killed low-level Dark Others. Upon discovering the truth about the Others, he was recruited into the Inquisition.
*Egor (spelled Yegor in the English subtitles of the film version): a shy, seemingly ordinary young boy. He was ambushed by a pair of renegade vampires in the beginning of &quot;Night Watch&quot;. Egor is a very rare case, having a &#x27;clean slate&#x27;. His aura shows his fate to be undetermined. In the second part of &quot;Night Watch&quot;, it is revealed that Yegor is destined to join the side of the Dark. However, at the very end of the novel his destiny is partially re-written and he remains unaffiliated. His potential mage level is very low (6 or 7).

== Film, TV or theatrical adaptations ==
Two films based on the novel, 2004&#x27;s &quot;Night Watch&quot; and the 2006 follow-up &quot;Day Watch&quot;, have been produced. (The &quot;Day Watch&quot; film is based on the second and the third part of the novel, not the follow-up novel &quot;Day Watch&quot;.) In 2005, Nival Interactive released the video game &quot;Night Watch&quot;, based on both the novel and film adaptation.

== Cultural references ==
*When talking to Olga about earlier &#x27;Light Other&#x27; social experiments like Communism, Anton asks if the next attempt would be a &quot;Brave New World?&quot;
*During their first conversation, Olga says to Anton &quot;You&#x27;re kidding, young man&quot; (in Russian: &quot;Шутишь, парниша&quot;), which is a memorable quote from Twelve Chairs. Anton then wonders whether she does any reading in owl form.

<doc id="935305" wikidata="Q100152" url="?curid=935305" title="Bastar district">
<text>Bastar is a district in the state of Chhattisgarh in Central India. Jagdalpur is the district headquarters. Bastar is bounded on the northwest by Narayanpur District, on the north by Kondagaon district, on the east by Nabarangpur and Koraput Districts of Odisha State, on the south and southwest by Dantewada and Sukma. The district possesses a unique blend of tribal and Odia culture.

Bastar and Dantewada districts were formerly part of the princely state of Bastar. Bastar was founded in the early 14th century, by Annama Deva, the brother of Kakatiya King Pratapa Rudra Deva of Warangal in Telangana. After India achieved independence in 1947, the princely states of Bastar and Kanker acceded to the Government of India, and were merged to form Bastar district of Madhya Pradesh. The district, which had an area of , was one of the largest in India when formed.

In 1999, the district was divided into the present-day districts of Bastar, Dantewada, and Kanker. In 2000, Bastar was one of the 16 Madhya Pradesh districts that formed a part of the new state of Chhattisgarh. In 2012, it was divided again to form Kondgaon district. These four districts are part of Bastar Division.

Bastar is known for its traditional Dussehra festival. The Chitrakoot and Teerathgarh waterfalls are situated close to Jagdalpur.

The district is a part of the Red Corridor. Gondi and Halbi are the two main languages, while Chhattisgarhi and Hindi are also spoken. It has been a tourist attraction for decades for its rich diversity of flora and fauna.

==Administration==
There are 12 taluks in the Bastar district according to the Census of India, 2011. The district has one municipality, Jagdalpur Nagar Nigam. Jagdalpur, the administrative headquarters, is a city with a population of about 
3,50,000. Transport railway stations- 11; RTc deposits – 03; Airports- Jagdalpur.

==Demographics==

According to the 2011 census, Bastar District had a population of 1,413,199 before its split into Kondagaon and Bastar, after the split having a population of 834,375. This gives it a ranking of 348th in India (out of a total of 640). The district has a population density of . Its population growth rate over the decade 2001-2011 was 17.83%. Bastar has a sex ratio of 1024 females for every 1000 males, and a literacy rate of 54.94%.

After the splitting of Kondagaon district, the district&#x27;s population is 834,375 of which 135,511 (16.24%) live in urban areas. Bastar has a sex ratio of 1017 females per 1000 males and a literacy rate of 53.15%. Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes make up 14,759 (1.77%) and 520,779 (62.42%) of the population respectively.

In 1981, Bastar had a population of 1,842,854 with 1,249,197 of the residents being members of scheduled tribes. This represented about 68% of the population. However, these figures are for the pre-1999 Bastar District, which had the same boundaries as the modern Bastar Division. In 2011, still approximately two thirds of those in the division were tribals.

===Languages===

At the time of the 2011 Census of India, 38.42% of the population in the district spoke Halbi, 25.88% Bhatri, 14.56% Gondi, 10.75% Hindi, 2.99% Duruwa, 2.63% Chhattisgarhi and 1.14% Odia as their first language. There is also a large number of Bengali speakers.

== Economy ==

===Agriculture===

Rice is grown predominantly during kharif season as the rain fed crop across a 2.38.9 million hectare area. However, the productivity of this crop is low, with only 08.53 qt/ha. The irrigated area (1.67%) and fertilizer use (4.6 kg/ha.) in the Bastar district is less than in other places of Chhattisgarh, and is insufficient to supply nutrients to the crop.

The pattern of livelihood in Bastar continues to be dictated by tradition. Even today, agricultural practices are traditional. Use of wooden ploughs is common while the number of iron ploughs is negligible. The same is true of bullock carts. The number of tractors is negligible while the bullock carts are all pervasive.

The usage of traditional agricultural implements has lowered the production of agriculture. The kharif crops grown here are paddy, urad, arhar, jowar and maize. The rabi crops include til, alsi, moong, mustard and gram. Forest-related work, including collection and sale of forest produce, supplements the meagre agricultural income of the population.

Most people do not find employment all year round. The cycle of floods and droughts makes livelihoods extremely vulnerable. People are often forced to seek help from moneylenders in times of crisis, which usually means a life of continued indebtedness. The absence of alternate employment opportunities leads to rampant poverty in the area. In the Bastar plateau, irrigation coverage is only 1.2 percent.

Exceptionally fortunate in its water resources, the region has good rainfall and rapid runoff due to the undulating terrain. There is potential for rainwater harvesting in the district.

===Forest produce===
Forests play an important role in the lives of the people, providing food and livelihood by way of minor forest produce and employment as casual labour in the Forest department. They provide for consumer needs such fuel, firewood, medicines, food, beverages, and housing materials, among others.



===Industry===

====Nagarnar Steel Plant====
National Mineral Development Corporation (NMDC) is setting up a 3 MTPA capacity greenfield Integrated Steel Plant in Nagarnar, located 16 km from Jagdalpur, with an estimated outlay of Rs 210 billion. The land for the plant has already been acquired as of August 2010 and, as of February 2012, five major packages of the steel plant have already been awarded to internationally acclaimed companies at a cost of around Rs. 65 lakh crore.

====Tata Steel Plant====
Tata Steel had inked the deal with the Chhattisgarh Government in June 2008 to set up a green field integrated steel plant at Lohandiguda, about 20 km from Jagdalpur. The proposed 5.5-million-tonne per annum plant has an estimated outlay of Rs 195 billion.

An environment ministry panel has recommended the diversion of forest land for the steel plant in a decision that was taken in the meeting of a Forest Advisory Committee (FAC) of the Ministry of Environment and Forests (MoEF), Government of India.

==Livelihood==
Forty percent of livelihoods are forest-based, 30 percent are agriculture based and 15 percent of livelihoods are dependent on animal husbandry. Another 15 percent of the income comes from wage labour.

===Agriculturists===
People of Bastar with land depend almost entirely on cultivation, either on their own holdings or on the holdings of others. They supplement their income with animal husbandry, and sundry labour at times. Some of them have also diversified into small services or small manufacturing activities.

===Labourers===
People without their own land or with very little land survive by working as farm and casual labour. They also work in the non-farm sector, in mines, small shops, on construction sites and as part of the urban work force.

===Agriculturists and forest gatherers===
Those with some land, and living in the vicinity of forests, typically become agriculturists and forest gatherers. A major part of the household consumption and income is based on forest gathering, with agricultural activities providing supplementary income.

===Forest gatherers and labourers===
People living close to the forests but who have no land or very little land become forest gatherers and/or labourers. They are heavily dependent on forest produce, which they gather and sell or directly consume. At times, this leads to conflicts with the forest administration, due to differences between the customary and official use patterns of the forest. Occasional labour on fields or in the forest supplements their income. Migrant labour is also prevalent among the tribal population of Bastar, especially among the Bison Horn Maria.

===Manufacturers===
These are traditional occupation-based producers. These include weavers, blacksmiths, carpenters, chattai (woven mats of bamboo or other grasses) weavers and tailors, bamboo craftsmen, and potters. They operate in the cottage or household sectors, in tiny units, which may be family-owned and rented. They may also employ some workers. Some people have taken to modern manufacturing, operating electrical repair or lathe shops. These are located in the big villages or along main roads. Nowadays in bastar everyone is involved in social media so everyone know about the business ideas. When nagarnar steel plant established in bastar then local peoples are get works and now many peoples of bastar are employed.

==Culture==

Bastar is well known for its tribal population, which comprises around 63% of the total. The major tribes of the Bastar region are the Gond, bhanj ,Abhuj Maria, Bhatra. The Bhatra tribe is believed to have originated through the King of Bastar. Bhatra are divided into subcastes San Bhatra, Pit Bhatra and Amneet Bhatra. Amneet Bhatra hold Highest Status, Halba, Dhurvaa, Muria, and Bison Horn Maria. The Maria are known for their unique Ghotul system. Gonds are also the largest tribal group of central India in terms of population.

The tribes of Bastar region are known for their unique and distinctive tribal culture and heritage. Each tribal group in Bastar has their own distinct culture and enjoys their own unique traditional living styles. Each tribe has developed its own dialects and differs from other tribes in their costumes, eating habits, customs, and traditions. They may even worship different gods and goddesses.

A large number of Bastar tribals still live in deep forests and avoid mingling with outsiders in order to protect their own unique culture. The tribes of Bastar are also known for their colorful festivals and arts and crafts. The main festival of the area is the Bastar Dusshera. The tribals of Bastar were among the earliest to work with metal and have expertise in making figurines of tribal gods, votive animals, oil lamps, and animal carts .

===Arts and crafts===
An area where handicraft is most widely practiced in Bastar is Kondagaon. Vessels, jewellery, images of the local deities, and some decorative works of art are made through a process called the lost wax technique, which is notable for its simplicity, is particularly well-suited to tribal settings. 

The Bastar district specializes in the preparation of items from Dhokra and unique woodcraft styles. The artifacts prepared from Dhokra technique of this art use beeswax, cow dung, paddy husk and red soil in the preparation. In addition to being used for contouring, wax wires are also used to touch up artifacts for a more polished finish.

The Dhokra and Bell Metal Handicraft are exported all over the world, and some of the handicraft items are purchased by tourists as souvenirs.

== Politics ==
Bastar is part of Bastar Lok Sabha constituency, whose MP is Mahesh Kashyap from the Bharatiya Janata Party. Bastar has three assembly constituencies: Bastar, Jagdalpur and Chitrakot. Bastar and Chitrakot are reserved for Scheduled Tribes. The MLAs for these constituencies are Lakheshwar Baghel (Indian National Congress) and Kiran Singh Deo and Vinayak Gotay (Bharatiya Janata Party) respectively.

<text>Hilarion (291–371), also known by the bynames of Thavata, of Gaza, and in the Orthodox Church as the Great was a Christian anchorite who spent most of his life in the desert according to the example of Anthony the Great (c. 251–356). While Anthony is considered to have established Christian monasticism in the Egyptian Desert, Hilarion, who lived in the coastal area near Gaza, is considered by his biographer Jerome (c. 342/347 – 420), to be the founder of Palestinian monasticism - regarding this claim see also Hilarion&#x27;s contemporary, Chariton (mid-3rd century – c. 350), founder of monasticism in the Judaean Desert. Hilarion is venerated as a saint exemplifying monastic virtues by the Eastern Orthodox Church, Oriental Orthodox Church and the Roman Catholic Church.

==Biography==
===Origin and life as a hermit===
Hilarion was born around 291 to pagan parents in Tabatha, a village five miles north of Gaza. Hilarion was at least bilingual, speaking both Greek as well as Aramaic which was common around Gaza. His pagan parents sent him in his youth to study with a grammarian in Alexandria, where he gave, according to Jerome, a remarkable proof of his ability and character and became an accomplished speaker. While in Alexandria, he heard of the hermit Anthony and set off to study with him. After two months of learning the ascetic life from Anthony, Hilarion started to feel that the many visitors who came to Anthony for healing or exorcism were too much to bear and he decided to set off in the wilderness of Palestine to live alone as a hermit.

Hilaron returned to Gaza where he found his parents dead and subsequently gave away his goods to his brothers and the poor. He then established himself as a hermit in the desert inland from the coastal road, seven miles from Maiuma, the port of Gaza. Though he went on one occasion to Jerusalem to venerate the holy sites, he chose not to live in the Judaean Desert as he did not wish to appear to confine God within prescribed limits, believing he could be close to God anywhere. Around 308, he built a hut where he lived in solitude for 22 years and which survived into the time of Jerome. Hilarion wove baskets as he had learned in Egypt where this was a common monastic occupation. Here he also struggled against fleshly desires and Jerome said that the devil tempted Hilarion by igniting the &quot;flames of lust&quot; in the young man. Hilarion fought this sexual desire by mortifying his body with hunger, thirst and strenuous labour.

===Life in Gaza and attributed miracles===
After the 22 years he lived in his solitary hut, Hilarion was approached by a brave woman who sought a cure for her sterility. First, he resisted, but soon he prayed for her upon which she was healed. From then on, Hilarion spent his life surrounded by disciples and people in need of healing and exorcism. Jerome reports several episodes in which Hilarion heals people, drives out demons, foresees the future, performs miracles and speaks divinely inspired words of wisdom. In one instance, Hilarion was able to heal the three children of Helpidius, who would later become praetorian prefect In Bethelea, Hilarion healed miraculously a certain Alaphion, which led to the conversion of the prominent family of the historian Sozomen.

As there were no monasteries in Palestine or Syria at the time (questionable, cf. Chariton and the lavra of Pharan), people begun to flock to Hilarion for spiritual training. Sozomen, possibly due to his local sources, singles out Epiphanius and Hesyach as the two most outstanding in the circle around Hilarion. Epiphanius, who is known by the bynames &#x27;of Eleutheropolis&#x27; and &#x27;of Salamis&#x27;, became his disciple after returning from Egypt and would later go to Cyprus where he introduced monasticism and was elected bishop of Salamis around 367/368. With many more people seeking his guidance, Hilarion established a monastery during the reign of emperor Constantius (337–361) which, by the time he was sixty-three, consisted of a large community with many visitors.

===Final years and death===
Hilarion remained in Gaza until three years after the death of Anthony (around 356), upon which he went to the place where Anthony had died in Egypt in order to escape the crowds that visited him. While he was there, the pagan Julian became emperor of the East in the winter of 361/362 and the city authority of Gaza attempted to arrest Hilarion who then had to flee. Jerome&#x27;s and Sozomen&#x27;s account differs slightly as Jerome writes that Hilarion escaped arrest in Egypt and lived there until Julian&#x27;s death before travelling to Sicily, Hilarion went according to Sozomen directly to Sicily. From there, he went soon to Epidauros in Dalmatia where he was said to have stilled the sea during the tsunami of 21 July 365 by drawing three crosses in the sand. Immediately after that, he went to Cyprus.

Hilarion was welcomed in Cyprus by his old disciple Epiphanius who encouraged him to stay. He initially settled near Paphos but later retired to a more remote place twelve miles away. Here, Hilarion died at the age of eighty and was buried. Ten months after Hilarion&#x27;s death, his disciple Hesyach stole his body, which was perfectly preserved and smelled sweetly, and interred it in his own monastery at Maiuma.

==Veneration and relics==
Sozomen reports that after Hilarion&#x27;s body was interred at his monastery, the local population started to celebrate an annual festival at the place. His relics continued to be venerated and are also mentioned by the anonymous Piacenza Pilgrim around the year 570.

Hilarion was venerated from early time in both East and West as an example of monastic holiness. Bede included him in his martyrology and he appeared frequently in Pre-Conquest English monastic calendars before his feast was ousted by those of Ursula and Dunstan&#x27;s ordination. Charlemagne is said to have brought the relics of Hilarion to Moissac Abbey from where they were transferred to the church of Duravel in 1065.

Hilarion is the patron saint of Caulonia, a southern Italian town in Calabria, under the name Sant&#x27;Ilario.

On icons, Hilarion is depicted as an old man with a brown, rush-like beard divided into three points and he holds sometimes a scroll which reads: &quot;The tools of a monk are steadfastness, humility, and love according to God.&quot;

==Sources==
Upon Hilarion&#x27;s death, Epiphanius announced his death in a laudatory letter which served as primary source for both Jerome and Sozomenus who wrote subsequent hagiographies about Hilarion. Jerome wrote his &quot;Life of Hilarion&quot; in Latin around 390 in the monastery of Paula in Bethlehem. Jerome&#x27;s work was translated into Greek by contemporary writer Sophronius upon whose translation Jerome looked favourably. Jerome was inspired by reading the &quot;Life of Anthony&quot; which also served as a literary model with regard to its content and ecclesiastic function of the text. There are two major themes Jerome focuses on, one being Hilarion&#x27;s search for a life of solitary prayer and contemplation and the other being Hilarion&#x27;s role as successor to Anthony. Jerome&#x27;s goal was not so much to write a historical exact account but rather a hagiographic composition focusing on the life and deeds of Hilarion. Though Jerome&#x27;s historical accuracy has been occasionally questioned, there can be no doubt that Hilarion was a historical figure and that Gaza became during his time a center of monasticism. 

Hilarion&#x27;s life is mentioned in the third, fifth and sixth book of Sozomen&#x27;s &quot;Ecclesiastical history&quot;, which was written in the 440s. Whereas in the third book no new information to Jerome&#x27;s Life of Hilarion is added and is in parts less detailed, Sozomen adds new information in the fifth and sixth books, possibly thanks to his local sources and own family history. Sozomen&#x27;s own origin and literary aims as a historian therefore result in a different historical sketch of Hilarion&#x27;s life than that of Jerome.

Hilarion is also mentioned twice in the Sayings of the Desert Fathers.

==In literature==
Johann Gottfried Herder wrote the poem &quot;The Paradise in the desert&quot; about the teacher-disciple relation between Anthony and Hilarion in 1797. This motif was also taken up by Gustave Flaubert in his &quot;The Temptation of Saint Anthony&quot;, though changed, as Hilarion attempts to tempt Anthony away from his faith by creating doubt. Hermann Hesse adapted a biography of Hilarion as one of the three &quot;Lives of Joseph Knecht&quot;, making his Nobel Prize–winning novel &quot;The Glass Bead Game&quot; (also known as &quot;Magister Ludi&quot;).

<text>Mary L. Wiseman (born November 17, 1961) is an American lawyer and judge from Ohio. On October 22, 2007, Ohio Governor Ted Strickland appointed her to the Ohio Courts of Common Pleas for Montgomery County.

==Early life and education==
Wiseman was born in Chillicothe, Ohio and spent most of her childhood in Greenfield, Indiana. She received her bachelor&#x27;s degree from Ball State University in 1984 and a Juris Doctor from the University of Arkansas at Little Rock School of Law in 1988.

== Career ==
In 1991, Wiseman became a partner at the law firm of Faruki Ireland and Cox P.L.L. A Democrat, Wiseman was elected in 1998 to the Dayton City Commission, serving until 2002 when she declined to run for a second term. A lesbian, she was the first openly gay person elected to public office in Dayton. In 2005, she became a shareholder at Coolidge Wall Co. LPA.

=== Ohio Court of Common Pleas ===
Upon her 2007 appointment to the bench, Wiseman became the first openly gay judge in the history of the state of Ohio.

During her first year as a judge, Wiseman presided over the high-profile trial of China P. Arnold, a mother found guilty of burning her month-old baby to death in a microwave oven. Wiseman sentenced Arnold to life in prison without the possibility of parole.

Wiseman sought election to the post in 2008. She looked set to face a challenge in the Democratic primary from District Court judge [[, but he withdrew in January 2008 following a controversy over allegedly homophobic comments he had made during the campaign. She faced Margaret M. Quinn, a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] but ended up winning by 53% to 47%.

Wiseman is [[Admission to the bar in the United States|admitted to the bar]] in Ohio, Arkansas, the [[United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio]], the [[United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio]], and the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit]], [[United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit|Sixth Circuit]], [[United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit|Seventh Circuit]], [[United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit|Eighth Circuit]] and [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit|Ninth Circuit]], as well as the [[Supreme Court of the United States]]. She is a member of the Ohio State Bar Association and the [[American Bar Association]].

=== Consideration for federal judicial nomination ===
In 2009, Wiseman was shortlisted for a vacancy on the [[U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Ohio]]. Ohio&#x27;s two U.S. Senators – [[Sherrod Brown]] (D–Lorain) and [[George Voinovich]] (R–Cleveland) – convened a bipartisan commission to recommend candidates for the vacancy, with Wiseman emerging as one of three finalists. In July 2009, Brown and Voinovich recommended [[U.S. Magistrate Judge]] [[Timothy Black]] to [[Barack Obama]] for appointment to the seat.

<doc id="935328" wikidata="Q259930" url="?curid=935328" title="Fusidic acid">
<text>Fusidic acid, sold under the brand name Fucidin among others, is a steroid antibiotic that is often used topically in creams or ointments and eyedrops but may also be given systemically as tablets or injections. , the global problem of advancing antimicrobial resistance has led to a renewed interest in its use.

==Medical uses==
Fusidic acid is active &quot;in vitro&quot; against &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot;, most coagulase-positive staphylococci, Beta-hemolytic streptococci, &quot;Corynebacterium&quot; species, and most clostridium species. Fusidic acid has no known useful activity against enterococci or most Gram-negative bacteria (except Neisseria, Moraxella, &quot;Legionella pneumophila&quot;, and &quot;Bacteroides fragilis&quot;). Fusidic acid is active &quot;in vitro&quot; and clinically against &quot;Mycobacterium leprae&quot; but has only marginal activity against &quot;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&quot;.

One use of fusidic acid is its activity against methicillin-resistant &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot; (MRSA). Although many strains of MRSA remain sensitive to fusidic acid, there is a low genetic barrier to drug resistance (a single point mutation is all that is required), fusidic acid should never be used on its own to treat serious MRSA infection and should be combined with another antimicrobial such as rifampicin when administering oral or topical dosing regimens approved in Europe, Canada, and elsewhere. However, resistance selection is low when pathogens are challenged at high drug exposure.

Topical fusidic acid is occasionally used as a treatment for acne vulgaris. As a treatment for acne, fusidic acid is often partially effective at improving acne symptoms. However, research studies have indicated that fusidic acid is not as highly active against &quot;Cutibacterium acnes&quot; as many other antibiotics that are commonly used as acne treatments. Fusidic acid is also found in several additional topical skin and eye preparations (e.g., Fucibet), although its use for these purposes is controversial.

== Side effects ==

Fucidin tablets and suspension, whose active ingredient is sodium fusidate, occasionally cause liver damage, which can produce jaundice (yellowing of the skin and the whites of the eyes). This condition will almost always get better after the patient finishes taking Fucidin tablets or suspension. Other related side-effects include dark urine and lighter-than-usual feces. These, too, should normalize when the course of treatment is completed.

==Pharmacology==
Fusidic acid acts as a bacterial protein synthesis inhibitor by preventing the turnover of elongation factor G (EF-G) from the ribosome. Fusidic acid is effective primarily on Gram-positive bacteria such as &quot;Staphylococcus&quot;, &quot;Streptococcus&quot; and &quot;Corynebacterium&quot; species.

Fusidic acid is a tetracyclic, naturally occurring steroid derived from the fungus &quot;Fusidium coccineum&quot;. It was first isolated in 1960 and developed by Leo Pharma in Ballerup, Denmark, being used clinically from 1962 onwards. It has also been isolated from &quot;Mucor ramannianus&quot;, an &quot;Acremonium&quot; species, and &quot;Isaria kogana&quot;. The drug is licensed for use as its sodium salt sodium fusidate, and it is approved for use under prescription in Australia, Canada, Colombia, the European Union, India, Japan, New Zealand, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, and the United Kingdom.

== Mechanism of action ==
Fusidic acid binds to EF-G after translocation and GTP (guanosine-5&#x27;-triphosphate) hydrolysis. This interaction prevents the necessary conformational changes for EF-G release from the ribosome, effectively blocking the protein synthesis process. Fusidic acid can only bind to EF-G in the ribosome after GTP hydrolysis.

Since translocation is a part of elongation and ribosome recycling, fusidic acid can block either or both steps of protein synthesis.

==Dose==
Fusidic acid should not be used on its own to treat &quot;S. aureus&quot; infections when used at low drug dosages. However, it may be possible to use fusidic acid as monotherapy when used at higher doses.
The use of topical preparations (skin creams and eye ointments) containing fusidic acid is strongly associated with the development of resistance, and there are voices advocating against the continued use of fusidic acid monotherapy in the community. Topical preparations used in Europe often contain fusidic acid and gentamicin in combination, which helps to prevent the development of resistance.

===Cautions===

There is inadequate evidence of safety in human pregnancy. Animal studies and many years of clinical experience suggest that fusidic acid is devoid of teratogenic effects (birth defects), but fusidic acid can cross the placental barrier.

==Resistance==
In vitro susceptibility studies of US strains of several bacterial species such as &quot;S. aureus&quot;, including MRSA and coagulase negative &quot;Staphylococcus&quot;, indicate potent activity against these pathogens.

Mechanisms of resistance have been extensively studied only in &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot;. The most studied mechanism is the development of point mutations in &quot;fusA&quot;, the chromosomal gene that codes for EF-G. The mutation alters EF-G so that fusidic acid is no longer able to bind to it. Resistance is readily acquired when fusidic acid is used alone and commonly develops during the course of treatment. As with most other antibiotics, resistance to fusidic acid arises less frequently when used in combination with other drugs. For this reason, fusidic acid should not be used on its own to treat serious &quot;Staph. aureus&quot; infections. However, at least in Canadian hospitals, data collected between 1999 and 2005 showed rather low rate of resistance of both methicillin-susceptible and methicillin-resistant to fusidic acid, and mupirocin was found to be the more problematic topical antibiotic for the aforementioned conditions.

Some bacteria also display &#x27;FusB-type&#x27; resistance, which has been found to be the most prevalent in &quot;Staphylococcus spp.&quot; in many clinical isolates. This resistance mechanism is mediated by fusB, fusC, and fusD genes found primarily on plasmids, but have also been found in chromosomal DNA. The product of fusB-type resistance genes is a 213-residue cytoplasmic protein which interacts in a 1:1 ratio with EF-G. FusB-type proteins bind in a region distinct from fusidic acid to induce a conformational change which results in liberation of EF-G from the ribosome, allowing the elongation factor to participate in another round of ribosome translocation.

== Interactions ==

Fusidic acid should not be used with quinolone antibiotics, with which it is antagonistic. Although clinical practice over the past decade has supported the combination of fusidic acid and rifampicin, a recent clinical trial showed that there is an antagonistic interaction when both antibiotics are combined.

On 8 August 2008, it was reported that the Irish Medicines Board was investigating the death of a 59-year-old Irish man who developed rhabdomyolysis after combining atorvastatin and fusidic acid, and three similar cases. In August 2011, the UK&#x27;s Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency issued a Drug Safety Update warning that &quot;systemic fusidic acid (Fucidin) should not be given with statins because of a risk of serious and potentially fatal rhabdomyolysis.&quot;

<text>ManpowerGroup (formerly known as Manpower Inc.) is an American multinational corporation headquartered in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Founded in 1948 by Elmer Winter and Aaron Scheinfeld, ManpowerGroup is the third-largest staffing firm in the world behind Swiss firm Adecco and Dutch firm Randstad NV. The company provides administrative &amp; support services, professional services, and business services through its four primary brands: Manpower (contingent staffing and permanent recruitment), Experis (resourcing and project management), Right Management (career management, workforce consulting, and training and development), and ManpowerGroup Solutions (managed services and outsourcing).

== History ==
=== Founding and expansion (1948–1961) ===

In one version of the founding story, Elmer Winter and his law partner Aaron Scheinfeld co-founded Manpower in 1948. The pair was inspired when they found themselves looking for secretarial help to file a brief on a tight deadline with the Wisconsin Supreme Court. They raised $7,000 and opened their first storefront in Milwaukee with the name Manpower suggested by a friend.

In his book “A History of Manpower, Inc. 1948–1976”, James D. Scheinfeld writes a different version: Aaron Scheinfeld worked with a company on contracts to mothball military equipment at the close of World War II, and envisioned a temporary help service. By this account, in 1948, Scheinfeld conceived of Manpower, arrived at the name and early logo over lunch with friend and advertiser Marvin Frank, and invited Winter to invest as a minority stockholder and co-founder. The two incorporated the company in Delaware, and in June 1948, opened offices in downtown Milwaukee and Chicago.

By 1952, Manpower had expanded in the US to Minneapolis, Cleveland, Cincinnati, New York, Pittsburgh, and Boston; in 1954, the company offered its first franchise; in 1956, the company went international with offices in Montreal, Toronto, and the UK; and in 1957, Manpower established operations in France.

Historian Louis Hyman says Manpower started supplying workers to replace unexpected absences like people calling in sick. Due to the limited size of this market, it then attempted to expand to replacing full-time workers wholesale with rented talent, but found resistance in an era when corporations valued stability, and subscribed to the notion that married white men needed stable jobs to be breadwinners for their families.

=== The White Glove Girl and public offering (1966–1975) ===

The growing temporary employment category has been said to be a new category of work intentionally exempt from union protections. “To avoid union opposition, they developed a clever strategy, casting temp work as “women&#x27;s work,” and advertising thousands of images of young, white, middle-class women doing a variety of short-term office jobs.” In 1961, Manpower spent $1 million to place advertisements in Sunday papers across the country featuring their “White Glove Girls”. Winter described the company&#x27;s strategy: &quot;We chose white gloves as a symbol … because they seem to represent everything that is feminine, neat, and proper. They symbolize quality and efficiency.” A 1962 advertisement from TIME features model Judy Newton who was the public face of Manpower in the 1960s as “The Girl in the White Gloves”. It cites Manpower&#x27;s 240 offices in the US and Canada and 15 offices in Europe. It also specifies that the company offered the following divisions: Office Services, Industrial Help, Salespower, Inc., and Technical Services.

In “The Temp Economy: From Kelly Girls to Permatemps in Postwar America”, Hatton posits that the images in these advertisements were carefully curated to be “respectable sex symbols” and very purposefully not displaying images of men or nonwhites and emphasizing that the White Glove Girls were “specially certified” as code for white &amp; middle-class and not recent immigrants or black migrants. A 1964 advertisement claims that the White Glove Girl carries an official training certificate that she is trained in: adapting quickly to new office routine, advanced telephone technique, dictation technique, transcribing services, good filing technique, fine points of electric typing, care of office equipment, keeping work confidential, starting the work day right, office etiquette, wardrobe and grooming, and dealing with office emergencies. The ad bills Manpower as the world&#x27;s largest temporary help service with over 300 offices globally.

In 1962, Manpower went public, listing shares on the New York Stock Exchange.

By 1967, Manpower advertising claimed the company has over 500 offices throughout the world. The company opened its 100th foreign office and 500th office globally in Istanbul, Turkey on February 7, 1967. On March 31, 1967, Manpower registered 300,000 shares of common stock offered for sale at $28 per share. In 1968, Manpower Technical is established, expanding to offer specialized temporary employees outside office clerical and industrial settings.

=== Parker Pen Company (1975–1985) ===

On August 18, 1975, upon the retirement of co-founder Elmer Winter, the Parker Pen Company announced its acquisition of Manpower for $28.2 million. A new subsidiary of Parker would own 80% of the common stock, with the remaining 20% purchased by Mitchell S. Fromstein, Manpower Chairman of the Board.

In January 1985, Fromstein became President of Parker Pen; in October of the same year, Fromstein announced the private sale of the pen business as Manpower had grown to represent 90% of Parker&#x27;s sales while the pen business struggled. Upon the completion of the sale, Parker Pen renamed itself Manpower Inc. and the sold Pen business retained the Parker Pen name.

=== Return to public company; takeover by Blue Arrow (1986–1990) ===

On June 27, 1986, Manpower went public once again, registering 300,000 shares of common stock with the SEC. On August 4, 1987, British firm Blue Arrow made a surprise bid to purchase Manpower for $1.2 billion in cash, or $75 a share for all 16 million outstanding shares. Blue Arrow intended to change Manpower into a full-service firm by adding permanent placement and executive recruiting services, cutting costs, and adding performance bonuses to employee compensation as they had done successfully with their 1985 purchase of Brook Street Bureau At the time, Manpower was virtually tied with Kelly Services for position as the largest American temporary services firm, each with 11%-12% market share. Blue Arrow was about 10% the size of Manpower; some analysts considered their takeover offer too low.

Manpower&#x27;s board rejected the initial takeover offer, only to receive a new offer of $1.33 billion (or $82.50 a share) that they accepted on August 22. Along with the increased offer price, Blue Arrow agreed that the company would operate as a subsidiary retaining the Manpower name in the US, the Milwaukee office would remain open, and that Fromstein would stay on.
In the intervening weeks before accepting the Blue Arrow offer, Fromstein attempted to negotiate a joint venture with Adia S.A. to blunt the takeover; however, the Swiss employment firm decided not to proceed. Adia later went on to merge with French firm Ecco in 1996 to form Adecco.

The company resumed trading on the NYSE as MAN on October 3, 1988.

On December 7, 1988, Fromstein resigned as President and Chief Executive of Manpower, publicly stating that the decision was mutual. However, it was Blue Arrow CEO and Chairman Antony Berry who convinced the board to oust Fromstein, forcing him out of the company. In response, Fromstein mounted an effort backed by Manpower franchises in the US to replace Berry. Just a month later in January 1989, the board removed Berry as CEO and appointed Fromstein in the Blue Arrow chief executive role while Berry remained company chairman. Berry&#x27;s removal came amid poor stock performance and a scandal as the British Department of Trade and Industry investigated NatWest bank, Blue Arrow&#x27;s investment bank advisor for the Manpower purchase, over &quot;an alleged stock-price support operation following the failure of the stock flotation.&quot; Charges were later filed in what became known as the Blue Arrow Affair in November 1989.

In April 1989, Fromstein consolidated his hold on Blue Arrow when the board removed Berry completely, appointing Fromstein as chairman. Later that year, Fromstein announced the intent to rename Blue Arrow PLC to Manpower PLC, commenting &quot;since Manpower Inc represents over 75% of the company&#x27;s revenues and profits and is the multinational brand among the company&#x27;s holdings, it is appropriate to make this change.&quot; Ultimately, Manpower moved the head office from Britain back to Milwaukee.

=== Reorganization as Manpower Inc (1990–2005) ===

On January 31, 1990, Blue Arrow PLC announced its intent to re-incorporate in the United States as Manpower Inc. and to return its corporate headquarters to Milwaukee. This process completed in 1991 with the incorporation of Manpower Inc, a new publicly traded holding company that acquired Manpower PLC (the renamed Blue Arrow), which indirectly owned Manpower International Inc.

In 1999, Fromstein retired as president, CEO, and chairman of the board and is named chairman emeritus. Jeffrey Joerres was named the new president and CEO. The company rebranded Manpower Technical as Manpower Professional.

In January 2000, Manpower acquired Elan Group Ltd., a provider of IT staffing solutions based in the UK with operations in the Netherlands, Ireland, Switzerland, Germany, and Hong Kong, for $146.2 million. The company merged its IT staffing operations across Europe under the Elan brand. During 2000, Manpower launched The Empower Group, an independent operating division providing consulting services to multinational corporations in the UK, Australia, New Zealand, and the US. On July 9, 2001, Manpower closed on its acquisition of Jefferson Wells International, Inc., a provider of professional accounting and tax services in the US and Canada, for $174 million. On December 11, 2003, Manpower announced an agreement to acquire Right Management Consultants for $488 million or $18.75 per share, into which they merged Empower.

=== Global rebrand (2006–2011) ===

In 2006, the company announced a new global brand identity with a new logo, marketing materials, and advertising campaigns. The new brand was developed by the London office of Wolff Olins, with advertising developed by WPP&#x27;s Grey Worldwide in New York and media strategy and planning by sister agency MediaCom.

According to the press release, “As part of the re-branding process, Manpower has streamlined its brand architecture from over 200 brands worldwide down to only five brands that now represent its total service offering. These brands are Manpower, Manpower Professional, Elan, Jefferson Wells and Right Management… The new Manpower logo consists of five oval shapes in five different colors, which comprise the initials &quot;MP&quot; and reflect the range of services that Manpower now offers.”

By 2007, under the name Manpower Business Solutions (MBS), the company provided task outsourcing, vendor management, onsite HR services, and Recruitment Process Outsourcing (RPO). In February 2010, Manpower agreed to acquire COMSYS IT Partners, Inc for $17.65 per share or a total of $431 million in half cash and half stock. The COMSYS acquisition included their Tapfin brand, expanding Manpower&#x27;s investment in RPO and Managed Service Provider (MSP) offerings. On April 5, 2010, Manpower completed the COMSYS acquisition and integrated the company with Manpower Professional IT. Tapfin MSP and RPO offerings were integrated with Manpower Business Solutions.

=== Rebranding as ManpowerGroup (since 2011) ===

In 2011, the company rebranded itself to ManpowerGroup and organized itself into four primary brands: Manpower, Experis (formed from the combination of Manpower Professional, Elan, and Jefferson Wells), Right Management, and ManpowerGroup Solutions (formerly Manpower Business Solutions). The new corporate name was part of an effort to become known as a workforce solutions company versus a traditional employment agency. The new brand name Experis was intended to emphasize the concepts of experience and expertise. New corporate and brand logos derived from the current corporate logo with work from The Martin Agency of Richmond, VA.

On September 22, 2011, ManpowerGroup acquired 70% of Proservia SA, a French IT and systems engineering company. The remaining shares were acquired by November 2011 for a total of $29.4 million.

On May 1, 2014, Jonas Prising replaced Joerres as CEO and Joerres assumed the role of executive chairman. Joerres retired on December 30, 2015, and Prising replaced him as chairman while retaining his role as CEO.

On June 1, 2015, ManpowerGroup announced the acquisition of the Australian and Singapore divisions of Greythorn and its subsidiary Marks Sattin. In August, 2015, the Experis division announced the acquisition of a majority stake in Veritaaq, a Canadian IT consulting firm. On September 3, 2015, ManpowerGroup acquired 7S Group GmbH, a German HR services firm, for $140.4 million. In 2016, and 2017, ManpowerGroup purchased several divisions of Ciber in Europe: Ciber Netherlands, Ciber Norway, and Ciber Spain. In August 2021, Manpower acquired IT resourcing and services provider Ettain Group for $925 million.

== Subsidiaries ==
ManpowerGroup owns hundreds of subsidiary companies around the world, the majority of which operate under the company&#x27;s four primary brands: Manpower, Experis, Right Management, or ManpowerGroup Solutions. The company does, however, operate several independent brands and joint ventures.

<doc id="935344" wikidata="Q7324974" url="?curid=935344" title="Richard Cromwell (actor)">
<text>Richard Cromwell (born LeRoy Melvin Radabaugh; January 8, 1910 – October 11, 1960) also known as Roy Radabaugh, was an American actor. His career was at its pinnacle with his work in &quot;Jezebel&quot; (1938) with Bette Davis and Henry Fonda and again with Fonda in John Ford&#x27;s &quot;Young Mr. Lincoln&quot; (1939). Cromwell&#x27;s fame was perhaps first assured in &quot;The Lives of a Bengal Lancer&quot; (1935), with Gary Cooper and Franchot Tone.

That film was the first major effort directed by Henry Hathaway and it was based upon the popular novel by Francis Yeats-Brown. &quot;The Lives of a Bengal Lancer&quot; earned Paramount Studios a nomination for Best Picture in 1935, though &quot;Mutiny on the Bounty&quot; instead took the top award at the Academy Awards that year.

Leslie Halliwell in &quot;The Filmgoer&#x27;s Companion&quot;, summed up Cromwell&#x27;s enduring appeal when he described him as &quot;a leading man, [the] gentle hero of early sound films.&quot;

==Early life==
Radabaugh enrolled as a teenager in the Chouinard Art Institute in Los Angeles on a scholarship. He ran a shop in Hollywood where he sold pictures, made lampshades, and designed colour schemes for houses, including &quot;decorating a bathroom for Colleen Moore and designing a house that he rented to Cole Porter.&quot;

==Career==

Radabaugh can be seen in &quot;King of Jazz&quot; (1930), along with the film&#x27;s star, Paul Whiteman and his orchestra. On a whim, friends encouraged him to audition in 1930 for the remake of the Richard Barthelmess silent: &quot;Tol&#x27;able David&quot; (1930). Radabaugh won the role over thousands of hopefuls. In storybook fashion, Harry Cohn gave him his screen name and launched his career. Cromwell earned $75 per week for his work on &quot;Tol&#x27;able David&quot;. Noah Beery Sr. and John Carradine co-starred in the film. Later, Cohn signed Cromwell to a multi-year contract based on the strength of his performance and success in his first venture at the box-office. Amidst the flurry of publicity during this period, Cromwell toured the country, even meeting President Herbert Hoover in Washington, D.C. 

Cromwell by then had maintained a deep friendship with Marie Dressler, which continued until her death from cancer in 1934. Dressler was nominated for a second Best Actress award for her 1932 portrayal of the title role in &quot;Emma&quot;. With that film, Dressler personally insisted that her studio bosses cast Cromwell on a loan-out in the lead opposite her. This was another break that helped sustain his rising status in Hollywood. &quot;Emma&quot; also starred Myrna Loy in one of her earlier screen performances. 

Cromwell&#x27;s next role in 1932 was as Mike in Gregory La Cava&#x27;s, &quot;The Age of Consent&quot;, co-starring Eric Linden and Dorothy Wilson. Cromwell is also remembered during this period in &quot;Hoop-La&quot; (1933), where he is seduced by Clara Bow. Next, the much in demand Cromwell starred in &quot;Tom Brown of Culver&quot;.

Next up was an early standout performance by Cromwell as the leader of the youth gang in Cecil B. DeMille&#x27;s now cult-favorite, &quot;This Day and Age&quot; (1933). To ensure that Cromwell&#x27;s character used current slang, DeMille asked high school student Horace Hahn to read the script and comment. He starred with Jean Arthur in 1934, in &quot;The Most Precious Thing in Life.&quot;

Cromwell&#x27;s many early pictures were made at Columbia Pictures and elsewhere. Cromwell starred with Will Rogers in &quot;Life Begins at 40&quot; for Fox Film Corporation in 1935 and appeared in &quot;Poppy&quot; in 1936 as the suitor of W.C. Fields&#x27; daughter, Rochelle Hudson. In 1937, he portrayed the young bank-robber in love with Helen Mack and on the lam from Lionel Atwill in &quot;The Wrong Road&quot;.

===1940s and military service===

In the early 1940s, Universal Pictures released &quot;Enemy Agent&quot; starring Cromwell as a draftsman who thwarts the Nazis. In 1942, he went on to appear in marginal but still watchable fare such as &quot;Baby Face Morgan&quot;, which co-starred Mary Carlisle.

Cromwell enjoyed a career boost, if not a critically acclaimed performance, in the film adaptation of the hit radio serial: &quot;Cosmo Jones, Crime Smasher&quot; (1943), opposite Gale Storm. Next up at Monogram Pictures, he was cast as a doctor working covertly for a police department to catch mobsters in the forgettable though endearing &quot;Riot Squad&quot;, wherein his &quot;fiancée&quot;, Rita Quigley, breaks their engagement.

==Personal life==
Back in California for good, Cromwell was married once, briefly (1945–1946), to actress Angela Lansbury, when she was 19 and Cromwell was 35. 

Cromwell made just one statement to the press regarding his wife of nine months and one of her habits: &quot;All over the house, tea bags. In the middle of the night she&#x27;d get up and start drinking tea. It nearly drove me crazy.&quot;

According to the biography: &quot;Angela Lansbury, A Life on Stage and Screen&quot;, Lansbury stated in a 1966 interview that her first marriage, &quot;was a mistake&quot; and that she learned from it. She stated, &quot;I wouldn&#x27;t have &quot;not&quot; done it&quot;, and, &quot;I was too young at 19. [The marriage] shouldn&#x27;t have happened.&quot; Articles based on interviews with Lansbury have stated that Cromwell was gay. Cromwell and Lansbury remained friends until his death in 1960.

==Death and legacy==
In July 1960, Cromwell signed with producer Maury Dexter for 20th Century Fox&#x27;s planned production of &quot;The Little Shepherd of Kingdom Come&quot;, co-starring Jimmie Rodgers, Bob Dix (son of Richard Dix), and Neil Hamilton who replaced Cromwell in the film. Cromwell became ill and died on October 11, 1960, in Hollywood of liver cancer, at the age of 50. He is interred at Fairhaven Memorial Park in Santa Ana, California.

Cromwell&#x27;s legacy is preserved today by his nephew Dan Putnam, and his cousin Bill Keane IV, both of the Conejo Valley in Southern California, as well as the family of his late niece, Joan Radabaugh, of the Central Coast. In 2005, Keane donated materials relating to Cromwell&#x27;s radio performances to the Thousand Oaks Library&#x27;s Special Collection, &quot;The American Radio Archive&quot;. In 2007, Keane donated memorabilia relating to Cromwell&#x27;s film career and ceramics work to the AMPAS Margaret Herrick Library in Beverly Hills. 

Cromwell was mentioned in Gore Vidal&#x27;s satirical novel &quot;Myra Breckinridge&quot; (1968) as &quot;the late Richard Cromwell, so satisfyingly tortured in &quot;Lives of a Bengal Lancer&quot;&quot;.

<text>Steyr-Daimler-Puch () was a large manufacturing conglomerate based in Steyr, Austria, which was broken up in stages between 1987 and 2001. The component parts and operations continued to exist under separate ownership and new names.

==History==

The company, initially known as Josef und Franz Werndl and Company was founded in 1864 as a rifle manufacturer. The company began producing bicycles in 1894. It grew rapidly during the First World War, by the end of which it employed 14,000 people. Steyr automobiles were made after 1918. In September 1917 Steyr recruited Hans Ledwinka, now remembered as one of the great automobile engineers of the twentieth century, but then relatively unknown, to the position of &quot;Chefkonstrukteur&quot;, to lead the creation of their automobile manufacturing business.

The first Steyr car, the six cylinder Type II &quot;12/40&quot; appeared in 1920. It was heavy and well-built, if a little cumbersome. It spawned sports versions with an impressive list of international achievements. The small but luxurious 1.5 L six Type XII of the late twenties won international motor press acclaim.

The company changed its name to Steyr-Werke AG in 1926. In 1934, Steyr merged with Austro-Daimler-Puch to form Steyr-Daimler-Puch. The range produced in these years mainly consisted of very modern designs, sporting partially or complete unit construction bodies in streamlined livery, from the one-litre Steyr 50 to the 2.3 L Steyr 220 &quot;six&quot;.

During World War II, when Austria was part of the Third Reich, Steyr-Daimler-Puch&#x27;s Generaldirektor Georg Meindl de became one of the first German industrialists to suggest the use of slave labour from concentration camps to boost manpower at Steyr. The request was approved and prisoners were brought by guarded train from the Mauthausen-Gusen camp complex at Gusen 30 km distant. Later, on 5 January 1942, Meindl wrote a letter to SS Gruppenführer Ernst Kaltenbrunner recommending a new &#x27;satellite&#x27; prison camp be constructed to house prisoners nearer the Steyr factory complex, explaining how this would reduce the time and loss of prisoners in transit to and from work while also reducing security and transport overhead costs.

This was approved and prisoners were used for facilities construction (bomb shelters, etc.), and to supplant manufacturing labor. This practice was not yet common at other larger German companies, though others followed suit including Mercedes-Benz and MAN. The vehicle range was for military use, including the Steyr RSO Raupenschlepper Ost with an air-cooled 3.5 L V8 engine designed by Ferdinand Porsche, who worked for the company at that time. War-time production there included small arms, assault rifles, machine guns, and aircraft engines.

After the war, Steyr-Daimler-Puch built diesel engined trucks and buses, small and heavy tractors and resumed passenger car production. First, Steyr assembled the FIAT 1100E, then put their own engine in a Fiat 1400, renaming the car the &quot;Steyr 2000&quot;. From 1957 through to the early 1970s it produced the tiny Puch 500 under license from FIAT, again with an engine of Austrian design.

Most prominent was its range of off-road cars, from the two-cylinder Haflinger and the 4 x 4 or 6 x 6 Pinzgauer, the Fiat Panda 4x4 (999 cc) to the Mercedes-Puch G. SDP was the initial designer and manufacturer of these utility vehicles. The Haflinger was produced from 1959 to 1974, the Pinzgauer from 1971 to 2000, and the Puch G (also known as Mercedes G-Class) from 1979.

The company&#x27;s Puch division produced a line of motorcycles, mopeds, and motor scooters marketed in the United States through Sears Roebuck including the Puch 250 SGS which was delivered in a cardboard crate box to the customer&#x27;s home. The Austro-Daimler branch built heavy tractors and trucks for the imperial Austrian army (before 1915). The main Steyr civil agricultural tractor production started in 1947.

After the war Steyr-Daimler-Puch resumed manufacturing bicycles and mopeds, gradually establishing distributors in several countries to manage their sales. Steyr made bicycles for sale for other retailers, most notably Sears. In the mid-1970s &quot;Steyr-Daimler-Puch America&quot; was incorporated in Connecticut to manage importation and distribution of bicycles and mopeds. Puch Austro-Daimler bicycles remained in production at Graz in Austria until the motorcycle and bicycle fabrication portions of the company there were sold in the mid 1987 to Piaggio &amp; C. S.p.A. of Italy.

==Gradual dissolution==
In 1987, Steyr-Daimler-Puch AG began selling portions of its different production lines to form separate companies, which included Steyr Nutzfahrzeuge AG (&quot;Steyr Commercial Vehicles&quot;, SNF; still based in Steyr) for truck manufacturing, Steyr Bus GmbH (in Vienna) for bus manufacturing, Steyr-Daimler-Puch Fahrzeugtechnik AG (SFT) and the EUROSTAR joint venture in Graz-Liebenau for assembly of automobiles and, in 1990, Steyr Tractor (Steyr Landmaschinentechnik AG).

Other production lines were spun off or sold outright to form independent companies, including Puch&#x27;s motorcycle division going to Piaggio and Steyr Mannlicher producing weapons. In 1990, the diesel engine division was spun off into Steyr Motorentechnik GmbH, which in 2001 became an independent company, renaming itself Steyr Motors GmbH. Steyr Landmaschinentechnik AG (Steyr Tractor) was sold to Case Corporation in 1996 and renamed Case Steyr Landmaschinentechnik (and is part of CNH since 1999).

Automobile production remained with Steyr-Daimler-Puch Fahrzeugtechnik (SFT) until Magna International acquired a majority holding in 1998. In 2001–2002 SFT was absorbed fully by Magna, becoming Magna Steyr.

In 1998, the production of military vehicles was sold to an Austrian investor company, which named it Steyr-Daimler-Puch Spezialfahrzeug GmbH (SSF). In 2003, SSF was sold to the U.S. company General Dynamics, a defence-equipment manufacturer and into General Dynamics Land Systems.

==Steyr trucks==
Steyr&#x27;s first truck was the Typ III, presented in 1920. Steyr built traditional bonneted trucks in the post war years. In 1968 the distinctive cab over Steyr 90 series was introduced. This was followed by the 91 and the 92 series, built until MAN took over Steyr&#x27;s truck production in 1990. A version of the 92 series is still built as the 12M18/12S18 for a number of military users, and was sold by Britain&#x27;s ERF as the ES-series.

Some MAN trucks are still available with &quot;Steyr&quot; branding for the Austrian market. The smaller 590/690-series of trucks utilized the cabin of the Hanomag-Henschel F-series; they were facelifted in 1982 and became the 591/691.

Beginning in 1994, Steyr used MAN&#x27;s F2000 cab for the NSK series (&quot;Neue Schwere Klasse&quot;, or &quot;new heavy class&quot;), while the light and medium duty trucks were the NLK and NMK (&quot;Neue Leichte Klasse&quot; and &quot;Neue Mittlere Klasse&quot;), based on MAN&#x27;s similarly situated L2000 and M2000 ranges respectively. The NLK ranged from the 6S10 (6.5 tons, 102 PS) to the 11S23 (11 tons, 233 PS). The NMK range was from 12 tonners up to the three-axle 25S26. These cabins were referred to as &quot;Typ 152&quot; in Steyr&#x27;s internal parlance.

36 Ophiuchi (or Guniibuu for component A) is a triple star system 19.5 light-years from Earth in the constellation Ophiuchus.

==Characteristics==
The primary and secondary stars (also known as HD 155886) are nearly identical orange main-sequence dwarfs of spectral type K2/K1. This binary is unusual because its eruptions do not seem to conform to the Waldmeier effect; that is, the strongest eruptions of HD 155886 are not the ones characterized by the fast eruption onset. The tertiary star is an orange main-sequence dwarf of spectral type K5.

Star C is separated from the A-B pair by 700 arcseconds, compared to a minimum of 4.6 arcseconds for A-B, so its effect on the movements of the A-B pair is small. A and B have active chromospheres.
At present the distance between the stars forming the AB-pair is 5.1 arcseconds and the position angle is 139 degrees, while star C is 731.6 arcseconds away from the A-component and situated at a position angle of 74 degrees.

==Nomenclature==

In the beliefs of the Kamilaroi and Euahlayi Aboriginal peoples in New South Wales, Australia, the star is called &quot;Guniibuu&quot; that represents the robin red-breast bird (&quot;Petroica boodang&quot;). In 2016, the IAU organized a Working Group on Star Names (WGSN) to catalog and standardize proper names for stars. The WGSN approved the name &quot;Guniibuu&quot; for the star A on 10 August 2018 and it is now so included in the List of IAU-approved Star Names.

==Hunt for substellar objects==
The McDonald Observatory team has set limits to the presence of one or more planets around 36 Ophiuchi A with masses between 0.13 and 5.4 Jupiter masses and average separations spanning between 0.05 and 5.2 astronomical units (AU), although beyond 1.5 AU orbits are inherently unstable around either 36 Ophiuchi A or 36 Ophiuchi B.

The star C (or namely HD 156026) is among five nearby paradigms as K-type stars of a type in a &#x27;sweet spot’ between Sun-analog stars and M stars for the likelihood of evolved life, per analysis of Giada Arney from NASA&#x27;s Goddard Space Flight Center.

==Observation==

On 26 October 2021, it was occulted by Venus as viewed from the Indian Ocean.

<doc id="935363" wikidata="Q422243" url="?curid=935363" title="Lynn Canal">
<text>Lynn Canal is an inlet (not an artificial canal) into the mainland of southeast Alaska.

Lynn Canal runs about from the inlets of the Chilkat River south to Chatham Strait and Stephens Passage. At over in depth, Lynn Canal is the deepest fjord in North America (outside Greenland) and one of the deepest and longest in the world.

The northern portion of the canal braids into the respective Chilkat, Chilkoot, and Taiya Inlets.

The Tlingit are the indigenous people of the Lynn Canal&#x27;s shores and waterways. The inlet was explored for the Royal Navy by Joseph Whidbey in 1794 and named by George Vancouver for his birthplace, King&#x27;s Lynn, Norfolk, England.

Lynn Canal was frequently visited by maritime fur traders from at least 1800. The &quot;Atahualpa&quot; visited in 1801 and its log mentions an earlier trading visit by an unidentified ship.

In April 1811 the American maritime fur trader Samuel Hill, captain of &quot;Otter&quot;, battled the Chilkat Tlingit in the Chilkat Inlet of Lynn Canal. Two of Hill&#x27;s crew were killed, including his second mate and journal keeper Richard Kemp, his boatswain. Six more were wounded. According to Captain Hill, the Tlingit suffered 40 killed, including 13 chiefs. Hill blamed both his first mate and the Tlingit, but he was notoriously violent and frequently attacked indigenous people unprovoked.
For several years after the 1811 battle fewer trade ships visited. By 1821 it was again a regular trading site, with visits by ships such as the &quot;Mentor&quot; in 1821.

==Transportation==
Lynn Canal&#x27;s location as a penetrating waterway into the interior connects Skagway and Haines, Alaska, to Juneau and the rest of the Inside Passage thus making it a major route for shipping, cruise ships, and ferries.

During the Klondike Gold Rush it was a major route to the boom towns of Skagway and Dyea and thence to the Klondike gold fields. The worst maritime disaster in the history of the Pacific Northwest occurred in Lynn Canal during October 1918, when SS &quot;Princess Sophia&quot;, steaming southbound from Skagway, grounded on the Vanderbilt Reef and later sank, with the loss of all 343 passengers and crew.

After the gold rush and the creation of the White Pass and Yukon Route railroad, ore and other freight from the Yukon Territory was transported on the railroad to Skagway and its deepwater port and then shipped through Lynn Canal. However, in the 1970s and 1980s the freight subsided as mining activity curtailed in the interior and today very little freight is actually shipped in the Lynn Canal.

Currently, transportation in the canal is provided by Alaska Marine Highway ferries. There are also several other entrepreneurial water taxis and ferries available, but the AMHS is far and away the most frequently used. A project of uncertain future is the Lynn Canal Highway.

Because of Lynn Canal′s high use, the United States Coast Guard installed several lighthouses in the early 20th century including Eldred Rock Light, Sentinel Island Light, and Point Sherman Light.

Historically, Lynn Canal proved to be a waterway involved in the Alaska boundary dispute, over the strip of land running down the Pacific coast between British Columbia and Alaska. Of particular value was the fact that Lynn Canal provided access to the Yukon, where gold was found in 1896. The dispute was fought between the United Kingdom, which then controlled Canada&#x27;s foreign relations, and the United States, and finally settled in 1903 by arbitration. The arbitrators ruled that the canal was part of Alaska, not British Columbia.

<doc id="935372" wikidata="Q5326611" url="?curid=935372" title="Early Childhood Education Act">
<text>The Early Childhood Education Act is the name of various landmark laws passed by the United States Congress outlining federal programs and funding for childhood education from pre-school through kindergarten. The first such act was introduced in the United States House of Representatives by Congresswoman Patsy Mink of Hawaii in the 1960s. The theory behind the act is that the years before a child reaches kindergarten are the most critical to influence learning. Many children do not have access to early education before entering kindergarten. The goal of the act is to provide a comprehensive set of services for children from birth until they enter kindergarten.

==Legislative history==
Since the Early Childhood Education Act was initiated in the 60s, various laws have been passed and continue to be passed as part of the Early Childhood Education Act to better prepare young children for school. These programs were intended to help children in the pre-kindergarten years to be more successful once starting school.

=== Head start ===
Founded in 1965 by Jule Sugarman, Head start was one of the first programs initiated as a result of the Early Childhood Education Act. Its goal is to enhance the social and cognitive development of children offering services in the area of education, health, social and nutrition. This program was originally intended to be a &quot;catch up summer school&quot; that would teach the children from low-income families everything that they need to know before starting school in only a few weeks span. The program has since been redefined and acts have been passed for Head Start programs to keep progressing towards providing better services to pre-kindergarten children from low-income families.

=== National Academy of Early Childhood Programs ===
In 1985 the National Association for the Education of Young Children established the National Academy of Early Childhood Programs for voluntary accreditation according to health, safety and education standards. This program was intended to create a more reliable standard of accreditation for early childhood education programs. The program&#x27;s goal is to promote quality and excellence in early childhood programs across the United States. There are NAECP located all across the country that offer classes in order to become an accredited ECE program.

=== Even Start Program ===
In 1988, The U.S. Department of Education established the Even Start Program to improve parent and family literacy at home. This program was designed to improve parents literacy so they can ultimately help their children become literate and reach their full potential as learners. It integrates early childhood education, adult education and family literacy.

=== No Child Left Behind Act ===
The No Child Left Behind Act was proposed by George W. Bush and passed by United States House of Representatives in 2001. The Act requires that all public schools receive federal funding to administer a standardized test annually to assess if students have made Adequate Yearly Progress (AYP). Schools must provide services to students who do not meet AYP in order to help them succeed and pass AYP the following year.

=== Preschool for All Initiative ===
In 2013, President Obama proposed the Preschool for All initiative. The goal of this program is to expand funding in all fifty states to allow low and mid-income families the opportunity to provide their four-year-old children with high quality preschool.

==Provisions of the act==
Laws under the Early Childhood Education Act offer comprehensive services for children from birth through age five. Programs should meet one the following goals: 
·Provide access to high-quality infant and toddler care 

·Expand voluntary home visit early learning program s

·Develop partnerships with states to provide high-quality preschool for low and middle-income families 

==Current programs==

Early Reading First was established as part of the No Child Left Behind Act. It provides competitive grants to fund the development of model programs that aim to prepare children for school. The Special Education Preschool Grants program provides grants to states to fund special educational services to children 3 to 5 with disabilities. The Special Education Grants for Infants and Families grant program assists states in implementing services for children with disabilities from birth to 2 years old. The Early Childhood Educator Professional Development Program is a competitive grant program that gives the opportunity to professionally develop skills to educators and caregivers working in low-income areas.

==Research and evaluations==

=== Research ===
The Preschool Curriculum Evaluation Research program evaluates the efficiency of current preschool curricula in order to address the lack of systematic evaluations currently used. The data collected includes child assessments, parent interviews, teacher interviews and classroom observations. Evaluations were made to commonly assess the types of assessments that preschool programs across the country were giving their children before they left and went to kindergarten. These evaluations were focused on the fact that preschools were not assessing children on a rigorous scale that efficiently prepared them to enter grade school. What children learn and the skills they gain in Pre-Kindergarten and Kindergarten determine how well they will succeed academically in the next few years that follow.

The National Institute for Early Childhood Research is an institute that concentrates on using research to support and enhance Early Childhood programs in the United States. This institute has been using research to promote a higher education for young children since 2002. They are currently doing research on several projects.

=== Evaluations ===
The &#x27;Even Start Classroom Literacy Interventions and Outcomes Study is a controlled study that assesses the contribution of the enhanced parenting component of the program. This program was created in 1989. The focus of this program was to help the parents of low-income families in order to improve the literacy skills of their children. By increasing the parents&#x27; knowledge and skills needed for reading and writing, the literacy skills of their young children would most likely increase as well. It focuses on evaluating whether focused literacy instruction combined with parent education will provide better outcomes than current programs.

The Early Reading First National Evaluation assesses the impact of the program on children&#x27;s language, literacy outcomes and preschools’ literacy instruction. The main focus of this study was to give the children of low-income families the opportunity to gain the necessary academic skills need to succeed in school. The study compares schools’ programs who received funding from the Early reading grant and those who did not.

<text>SS &quot;Normandie&quot; was a French ocean liner built in Saint-Nazaire, France, for the French Line &quot;Compagnie Générale Transatlantique&quot; (CGT). She entered service in 1935 as the largest and fastest passenger ship afloat, crossing the Atlantic in a record 4.14 days, and remains the most powerful steam turbo-electric-propelled passenger ship ever built.

&quot;Normandie&quot;″s novel design and lavish interiors led many to consider her the greatest of ocean liners. Despite this, she was not a commercial success and relied partly on government subsidy to operate. During service as the flagship of the CGT, she made 139 westbound transatlantic crossings from her home port of Le Havre to New York City. &quot;Normandie&quot; held the Blue Riband for the fastest transatlantic crossing at several points during her service career, during which was her main rival.

During the Second World War, &quot;Normandie&quot; was seized by U.S. authorities at New York and renamed USS &quot;Lafayette&quot;. In 1942, while being converted to a troopship, the liner caught fire and capsized onto her port side and came to rest, half submerged, on the bottom of the Hudson River at Pier 88 (the site of the current Manhattan Cruise Terminal). Although salvaged at great expense, restoration was deemed too costly and she was scrapped in October 1946.

==Origins==
The origins of &quot;Normandie&quot; can be traced to the 1920s, when the U.S. put restrictions on immigration, greatly reducing the traditional market for steerage-class passengers from Europe, and placing a new emphasis on upper-class tourists, largely Americans, many of them wanting to escape prohibition. Companies like Cunard and the White Star Line planned to build their own superliners to rival newer ships of the day; such vessels included the record-breaking and , both German. The French Line &quot;Compagnie Générale Transatlantique&quot; (CGT) began to plan its own superliner.
The CGT&#x27;s flagship was the , which had modern Art Deco interiors but a conservative hull design. The designers intended their new superliner to be similar to earlier French Line ships. Then they were approached by Vladimir Yourkevitch, a former ship architect for the Imperial Russian Navy who had emigrated to France after the 1917 revolution. Yourkevitch&#x27;s ideas included a slanting clipper-like bow and a bulbous forefoot beneath the waterline, in combination with a slim hydrodynamic hull. His concepts worked wonderfully in scale models, confirming the design&#x27;s performance advantages. The French engineers were convinced by Yourkevitch and asked him to join their project. He also approached Cunard with his ideas, but was rejected because the bow was deemed too radical.

The CGT commissioned artists to create posters and publicity for the liner. One of the most famous posters was by Adolphe Mouron Cassandre, another Russian emigrant to France. Another poster, by Albert Sébille, showed the interior layout in a cutaway diagram long. This poster is displayed in the &quot;Musée national de la Marine&quot; in Paris.

==Construction and launch==
Work by the &quot;Société Anonyme des Chantiers de Penhoët&quot; began on the unnamed flagship on 26 January 1931 at Saint-Nazaire, soon after the stock market crash of 1929. While the French continued construction, the competing White Star Line&#x27;s planned &quot;Oceanic&quot; was cancelled and Cunard&#x27;s put on hold. French builders also ran into difficulty and had to ask for government money; this subsidy was questioned in the press. Still, the ship&#x27;s construction was followed by newspapers and national interest was deep, as she was designed to represent France in the nation-state contest of the great liners and was built in a French shipyard using French parts.

The growing hull in Saint-Nazaire had no formal designation except &quot;T-6&quot; (&quot;T&quot; for &quot;Transat&quot;, an alternate name for the French Line, and &quot;6&quot; for &quot;6th&quot;), the contract name. Many names were suggested including &quot;Doumer&quot;, after Paul Doumer, the recently assassinated President of France; and originally, &quot;La Belle France.&quot; Finally &quot;Normandie&quot; was chosen. In France, boat prefixes properly depend on the boat name&#x27;s gender, but non-sailors mostly use the masculine form, inherited from the French terms for boat, which can be &quot;&quot;paquebot&quot;, &quot;navire&quot;, &quot;bateau&quot;, or &quot;bâtiment&quot;&quot;. British and Germans refer to boats as feminine (&quot;she&#x27;s a beauty&quot;). The CGT called their ship simply &quot;Normandie&quot;, preceded by neither &quot;le&quot; nor &quot;la&quot; (French masculine/feminine for &quot;the&quot;) to avoid any confusion.
On 29 October 1932 – three years to the day after the stock market crash – &quot;Normandie&quot; was launched in front of two-hundred thousand spectators. The 27,567-ton hull that slid into the river Loire was the largest launched and the wave washed up the shoreline and over several hundred spectators, but with no injury. She was dedicated by Madame Marguerite Lebrun, wife of Albert Lebrun, the president of France. The ship was outfitted until early 1935, her interiors, funnels, engines, and other fittings put in to make her into a working vessel. Finally, in May 1935, &quot;Normandie&quot; was ready for trials, which were watched by reporters. The superiority of Yourkevitch&#x27;s hull was visible; hardly a wave was created off the bulbous bow. The ship reached a top speed of and performed an emergency stop from that speed in .

In addition to hull design which let her attain speed at far less power than other big liners, &quot;Normandie&quot; had a turbo-electric transmission, with turbo-generators and electric propulsion motors built by Alsthom of Belfort. The CGT chose turbo-electric transmission as it removed the need for astern turbines to be installed, had the ability to use full power in reverse, and because, according to CGT officials, it was quieter and more easily controlled and maintained. The engine installation was heavier than conventional turbines and slightly less efficient at high speed but allowed all propellers to operate even if one engine was not running. This system also made it possible to eliminate astern turbines. An early form of radar was installed to prevent collisions. The rudder frame, including the 125-ton cast steel connecting rod, was produced by Škoda Works in Czechoslovakia.

&quot;Normandie&quot; had a significant cost. By the time of her maiden voyage, she had cost 812 million francs, then equal to $53.5 million (equivalent to $ million in ).

==Interior==
&quot;Normandie&quot;″s luxurious interiors were designed in Art Déco and Streamline Moderne style by architect Pierre Patout, one of the founders of the Art Deco style. Many sculptures and wall paintings made allusions to Normandy, the province of France for which the ship was named. Drawings and photographs show a series of vast public rooms of great elegance. Her voluminous interior spaces were made possible by having the funnel uptakes split to pass along the sides of the ship, rather than straight upward. French architect Roger-Henri Expert was in charge of the overall decorative scheme.

Most of the public space was devoted to first-class passengers, including the dining room, first-class lounge, grill room, first-class swimming pool, theatre and winter garden. The first-class swimming pool featured staggered depths, with a shallow training beach for children. The children&#x27;s dining room was decorated by Jean de Brunhoff, who covered the walls with Babar the Elephant and his &quot;entourage&quot;.

The interiors were filled with grand perspectives, spectacular entryways, and long, wide staircases. First-class suites were given unique designs by select designers. The most luxurious accommodations were the Deauville and Trouville apartments, featuring dining rooms, baby grand pianos, multiple bedrooms, and private decks.
&quot;Normandie&quot;″s first-class dining hall was the largest room afloat. At , it was longer than the Hall of Mirrors at the Palace of Versailles, wide, and high. Passengers entered through doors adorned with bronze medallions by artist Raymond Subes. The room could seat 700 at 157 tables, with &quot;Normandie&quot; serving as a floating promotion for the most sophisticated French cuisine of the period. As no natural light could enter it was illuminated by twelve tall pillars of Lalique glass flanked by 38 matching columns along the walls. These, with chandeliers hung at each end of the room, earned the &quot;Normandie&quot; the nickname &quot;Ship of Light&quot; (similar to Paris as the &quot;City of Light&quot;).

A popular feature was the café grill, which would be transformed into a nightclub. Adjoining the café grill was the first-class smoking room, which was paneled in large murals depicting ancient Egyptian life. The ship also had indoor and outdoor pools, a chapel, and a theatre which could double as a stage and cinema.

The machinery of &quot;Normandie&quot;″s top deck and forecastle was integrated within the ship, concealing it and releasing nearly all the exposed deck space for passengers. As such it was the only ocean liner to have a regulation-sized open air tennis court on board. The air conditioner units were concealed along with the kennels inside the third, dummy, funnel.

==Career==

&quot;Normandie&quot;″s maiden voyage was on 29 May 1935. At Le Havre she took aboard 812 Passengers: 467 First Class Passengers, 244 Tourist Class and 101 Third Class. 50,000 people saw her off at Le Havre on what was hoped would be a record-breaking crossing. At Southampton she took aboard an additional 195 Passengers: 122 First Class Passengers, 53 Tourist Class and 20 Third Class. Her combined total was 1,007 passengers. First Class was booked at two-thirds capacity with 589, Tourist Class was half booked at 293, while Third Class was at less than a quarter capacity with only 121.

She reached New York City after four days, three hours and two minutes, taking away the Blue Riband from the Italian liner . This brought great pride for the French, who had not won the distinction before. Under the command of Captain René Pugnet, &quot;Normandie&quot;″s average on the maiden voyage was and on the eastbound crossing to France, she averaged over , breaking records in both directions.
During the maiden voyage, the CGT refused to predict that their ship would win the Blue Riband. However, by the time the ship reached New York, medallions of the Blue Riband victory, made in France, were delivered to passengers and the ship flew a blue pennant. An estimated 100,000 spectators lined New York Harbor for &quot;Normandie&quot;″s arrival. All passengers were presented with a medal celebrating the occasion on behalf of the CGT.

&quot;Normandie&quot; had a successful year but &quot;Queen Mary&quot;, Cunard White Star Line&#x27;s superliner, entered service in May 1936. At 80,774 gross registered tons, she was larger than &quot;Normandie&#x27;s&quot; 79,280 gross registered tons, and captured the title of the world&#x27;s largest passenger ship. In response, CGT increased &quot;Normandie&quot;″s size, mainly through the addition of an enclosed tourist lounge on the aft boat deck. Following these and other alterations, she measured 83,423 GRT. When the &quot;Normandie&quot; reentered service, she exceeded &quot;Queen Mary&quot; by 2,000 tons, reclaiming the title of world&#x27;s largest ship. &quot;Normandie&quot; retained the title until Cunard White Star Line&#x27;s RMS Queen Elizabeth at 83,673 gross registered tons formally entered service in 1946.

On 22 June 1936, a Blackburn Baffin, &quot;S5162&quot; of A Flight, RAF Gosport, flown by Lt Guy Kennedy Horsey on torpedo-dropping practice, buzzed &quot;Normandie&quot; off Ryde Pier and collided with a derrick which was transferring a motor car belonging to Arthur Evans, MP, onto a barge alongside the ship. The aircraft crashed onto &quot;Normandie″&quot;s bow. The pilot was taken off by tender, but the wreckage of the aircraft remained on board &quot;Normandie&quot; as she had to sail due to the tide. It was carried to Le Havre. A salvage team from the Royal Air Force later removed the wreckage. Horsey was court-martialled and found guilty on two charges, and Evans&#x27; car was wrecked in the accident.

In August 1936, &quot;Queen Mary&quot; captured the Blue Riband, averaging , starting a fierce rivalry. To recapture the speed record, CGT modified &quot;Normandie&quot; to reduce vibration and increase her speed. CGT replaced her three-bladed propellers with four-bladed ones, and made structural modifications to her lower aft section. These modifications reduced vibration at speed. In July 1937, she regained the Blue Riband, but &quot;Queen Mary&quot; took it back in 1938. After this, the captain of &quot;Normandie&quot; sent a message: &quot;Bravo to the &quot;Queen Mary&quot; until next time!&quot; This rivalry could have gone on into the 1940s, but was ended by the Second World War.

&quot;Normandie&quot; carried distinguished passengers, including the authors Colette and Ernest Hemingway; the wife of French president Albert Lebrun; songwriters Noël Coward and Irving Berlin; and Hollywood celebrities such as Fred Astaire, Marlene Dietrich, Walt Disney, Douglas Fairbanks, Jr, conductor Arturo Toscanini and James Stewart. She also carried the von Trapp family singers (later immortalized in &quot;The Sound of Music)&quot; from New York to Southampton in 1938; from Southampton, the family toured Scandinavia before returning to the United States.

==Planned running mate – SS &quot;Bretagne&quot;==
While &quot;Normandie&quot; rarely was occupied at over 60% of her capacity, her finances were such that she did not require government subsidies every year. She never repaid any of the loans that made her construction possible. The CGT considered a sister ship, SS &quot;Bretagne&quot;, which was to be longer and larger. There were two competing designs for this ship one conservative, one radical. The conservative design was essentially &quot;Normandie&quot; with two funnels, possibly larger as well. The radical one was from &quot;Normandie&quot;″s designer, Vladimir Yourkevitch, and was super-streamlined with twin, side-by-side funnels just aft of the bridge. The more conservative design won, but the outbreak of the war halted the plan indefinitely.

==Popularity==
Although &quot;Normandie&quot; won praise for her design and decor, ultimately North Atlantic passengers flocked to the more traditional &quot;Queen Mary&quot;. Two of the ship&#x27;s greatest attributes, in reality, turned out to be two of her biggest faults.

Part of &quot;Normandie&quot;″s problem lay in the fact that the majority of her passenger space was devoted to first class, which could carry up to 848 people. Less space and consideration were given to second and tourist class, which numbered only 670 and 454 passengers, respectively. As a result, the consensus among North Atlantic passengers was that she was primarily a ship for the rich and famous. In contrast, in &quot;Queen Mary&quot;, Cunard White Star had placed just as much emphasis on décor, space, and accommodation in second and tourist class as in first class. Thus &quot;Queen Mary&quot; accommodated American tourists, who had become numerous in the 1920s and 1930s. Many of these passengers could not afford first-class passage yet wanted to travel in much of the same comfort as that experienced in first. As a result, second and tourist class became a significant source of cash for shipping companies at that time. &quot;Queen Mary&quot; would accommodate these trends and subsequently the liner achieved greater popularity among North Atlantic travellers during the late thirties.

Another of the CGT&#x27;s greatest triumphs also turned out to be one of &quot;Normandie&quot;″s greatest flaws: her décor. The ship&#x27;s slick and modern Art Deco interiors proved to be somewhat intimidating and uncomfortable for her travellers, with some claiming that interiors gave them headaches. It was also here that &quot;Queen Mary&quot; triumphed over her French rival. Although also decorated in an Art Deco style, &quot;Queen Mary&quot; was more restrained in her appointments and was not as radical as &quot;Normandie&quot;, and proved ultimately to be more popular with travellers.
As a result, &quot;Normandie&quot; at many times throughout her service history carried less than half her full complement of passengers. Her German rivals &quot;Bremen&quot; and &quot;Europa&quot;, and Italian rivals &quot;Rex&quot; and also suffered from this problem; despite their innovative designs and luxurious interiors, they made little profit for their respective companies. Contributing to this were international boycotts against Germany and Italy as the European geopolitical situation deteriorated through the 1930s. The Italian liners relied heavily on government subsidies, while the German Lloyd liners never received funding. In comparison, &quot;Normandie&quot; did not require government subsidies in service, with her income covering not only her operating expenses but generating revenue of 158,000,000 francs.

In contrast, Cunard White Star&#x27;s &quot;Britannic III&quot;, &quot;Georgic II&quot;, and much older &quot;Aquitania&quot;, along with the Holland America Line&#x27;s , were among the few North Atlantic liners to make a profit, carrying the lion&#x27;s share of passengers in the years preceding the Second World War.

Sometime in 1939, the famous Von Trapp Family Singers stayed in third class and traveled to Southampton aboard the Normandie. In Part 2, chapter 5 of &quot;The Story of the Trapp Family Singers&quot;, the autobiography of Maria Augusta Trapp, Maria describes the Trapp Family&#x27;s experience aboard the Normandie. She states, &quot;The &quot;Normandie&quot;! What a noble boat, and what a wonderful crew! although we were only third-class passengers, the French-line went out of its way to make our stay as enjoyable as possible ... On board the Normandie we were treated as celebrated artists. People knew about our Town Hall concert and we were asked to give a gala performance on the last evening together with Rene Le Roy, the flutist. Champagne was served free of charge afterwards. The boat itself was a dream of beauty ... But four days was not too short to create a warm feeling for the boat and its crew, and when, years later, we learned of the dreadful disaster the Normandie had suffered in New York, we felt as if something terrible had happened to a close friend of ours.&quot;

==World War II==

The outbreak of the war found &quot;Normandie&quot; in New York Harbor. Looming hostilities in Europe had compelled &quot;Normandie&quot; to seek haven in the U.S. The federal government interned her on 3 September 1939, the same day France declared war on Germany. Soon &quot;Queen Mary&quot;, later refitted as a troopship, moored nearby. Then, two weeks later, &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot; joined &quot;Queen Mary&quot;. For five months, the three largest liners in the world were tied up side by side. &quot;Normandie&quot; remained in French hands, with French crewmembers on board, led by Captain Hervé Lehuédé, into the spring of 1940.

On 15 May 1940, during the Battle of France, the U.S. Treasury Department detailed about 150 agents of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to go aboard the ship and Manhattan&#x27;s Pier 88 to defend it against possible sabotage. (At the time, U.S. law mandated the Coast Guard as part of the Treasury during peacetime.) When the USCG became a part of the United States Navy on 1 November 1941, &quot;Normandie&quot;″s USCG detail remained intact, mainly observing while the French crew maintained the vessel&#x27;s boilers, machinery, and other equipment, including the fire-watch system. On 12 December 1941, five days after the attack on Pearl Harbor, the USCG removed Captain Lehuédé and his crew and took possession of &quot;Normandie&quot; under the right of angary, maintaining steam in the boilers and other activities on the idled vessel. However, the elaborate fire-watch system which ensured that any fire would be suppressed before it became a danger was abandoned.

===&quot;Lafayette&quot; conversion===

On 20 December 1941, the Auxiliary Vessels Board officially recorded President Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s approval of &quot;Normandie&quot;″s transfer to the U.S. Navy. Plans called for the vessel to be turned into a troopship (&quot;convoy unit loaded transport&quot;). The Navy renamed her USS &quot;Lafayette&quot;, in honor of both Marquis de la Fayette, the French general who fought on the Colonies&#x27; behalf in the American Revolution, and the alliance with France that made American independence possible. The name was a suggestion of J. P. &quot;Jim&quot; Warburg, advisory assistant to Colonel William J. Donovan, Coordinator of Information, which was passed through multiple channels including Secretary of the Navy Frank Knox; Admiral Harold R. Stark, Chief of Naval Operations (CNO); and Rear Adm. Randall Jacobs, Chief of the Bureau of Navigation. The name &quot;La Fayette&quot; (later universally and unofficially contracted to &quot;Lafayette&quot;) was officially approved by the secretary of the navy on 31 December 1941, with the vessel classified as a transport, AP-53.

Earlier proposals included turning &quot;Lafayette&quot; into an aircraft carrier, but this was dropped in favor of immediate troop transport. The ship remained moored at Pier 88 for the conversion. A contract for her conversion to a troop transport was awarded to Robins Dry Dock and Repair Company, a subsidiary of Todd Shipyards, on 27 December 1941. On that date, Capt. Clayton M. Simmers, the 3rd Naval District Materiel Officer, reported to the Bureau of Ships (BuShips) his estimate that the conversion work could be completed by 31 January 1942, and planning for the work proceeded on that basis.

Capt. Robert G. Coman reported as &quot;Lafayette&quot;″s prospective commanding officer on 31 January 1942, overseeing a skeleton engineering force numbering 458 men. The complicated nature and enormous size of the conversion effort prevented Coman&#x27;s crew from adhering to the original schedule; crew familiarization with the vessel was an issue, and additional crew members were arriving to assist the effort. On 6 February 1942, a request for a two-week delay for the first sailing of &quot;Lafayette&quot;, originally scheduled for 14 February, was submitted to the Assistant Chief of Naval Operations. On that day, a schedule extension was granted due to a design plan change: elements of the superstructure were to be removed to improve stability, in work that was expected to take another 60 to 90 days. However, on 7 February, orders came from Washington that the reduction of the top-hamper had been abandoned and &quot;Lafayette&quot; was to sail on 14 February as planned. This abrupt reversal necessitated a frantic resumption of conversion work, and captains Coman and Simmers scheduled 9 February meetings in New York and Washington to lobby for further clarification of conversion plans; ultimately, these meetings would never take place.

===Fire and capsizing===

At 14:30 on 9 February 1942, sparks from a welding torch used by workman Clement Derrick ignited a stack of life vests filled with flammable kapok that had been stored in &quot;Lafayette&quot;″s first-class lounge. The flammable varnished woodwork had not yet been removed, and the fire spread rapidly. The ship had a very efficient fire protection system, but it had been disconnected during the conversion and its internal pumping system was deactivated. The New York City Fire Department&#x27;s hoses did not fit the ship&#x27;s French inlets. Before the fire department arrived, approximately 15 minutes after fire broke out, all onboard crew were using manual means in a vain attempt to stop the blaze. A strong northwesterly wind blowing over &quot;Lafayette&quot;″s port quarter swept the blaze forward, eventually consuming the three upper decks of the ship within an hour of the start of the conflagration. Capt. Coman, along with Capt. Simmers, arrived about 15:25 to see his huge prospective command in flames.
As firefighters on shore and in fire boats poured water on the blaze, &quot;Lafayette&quot; developed a dangerous list to port due to water pumped into the seaward side by fireboats. Vladimir Yourkevitch, the ship&#x27;s designer, arrived at the scene to offer expertise but was barred by harbor police. Yourkevitch&#x27;s suggestion was to enter the vessel and open the sea-cocks. This would flood the lower decks and make her settle the few feet to the bottom. With the ship stabilised, water could be pumped into burning areas without the risk of capsizing. The suggestion was rejected by the commander of the 3rd Naval District, Rear Admiral Adolphus Andrews.

Between 17:45 and 18:00 on 9 February 1942, authorities considered the fire under control and began winding down operations until 20:00. Water entering &quot;Lafayette&quot; through submerged openings and flowing to the lower decks negated efforts to counter-flood, and her list to port gradually increased. Shortly after midnight, Rear Adm. Andrews ordered &quot;Lafayette&quot; abandoned. The ship continued to list, a process hastened by the 6,000 tons of water that had been sprayed on her. New York fire officials were concerned that the fire could spread to the nearby buildings. &quot;Lafayette&quot; eventually capsized during the mid watch (02:45) on 10 February, nearly crushing a fire boat, and came to rest on her port side at an angle of approximately 80 degrees. Recognising that his incompetence had caused the disaster, Rear Adm. Andrews ordered all pressmen barred from viewing the moment of capsize in an effort to lower the level of publicity.
One man died in the incident – Frank &quot;Trent&quot; Trentacosta, 36, of Brooklyn, a member of the fire watch. Some 94 USCG and Navy sailors, including some from &quot;Lafayette&quot;″s pre-commissioning crew and men assigned to the receiving ship &quot;Seattle&quot;, 38 fire fighters, and 153 civilians, were treated for various injuries, burns, smoke inhalation, and exposure.

====&quot;Saboteur&quot; (film)====
The ruined &quot;Lafayette&quot; after the fire can be seen briefly in the film &quot;Saboteur&quot; (1942). The ship is not identified in the film, but the antagonist smiles when he sees it, suggesting that he was responsible. The film&#x27;s director, Alfred Hitchcock, later said that &quot;the Navy raised hell&quot; about the implication that their security was so poor.

===Investigation and salvage===
Enemy sabotage was widely suspected, but a congressional investigation in the wake of the sinking, chaired by Representative Patrick Henry Drewry (D-Virginia), concluded that the fire was accidental. The investigation found evidence of carelessness, rule violations, lack of coordination between the various parties on board, lack of clear command structure during the fire, and a hasty, poorly planned conversion effort.

Members of organized crime retrospectively claimed that they had sabotaged the vessel. It was alleged that arson had been organized by mobster Anthony Anastasio, who was a power in the local longshoremen&#x27;s union, to provide leverage for the release of mob boss Charles &quot;Lucky&quot; Luciano from prison. Luciano&#x27;s end of the bargain would be to ensure that there would be no further &quot;enemy&quot; sabotage in the ports where the mob had strong influence with the unions.

In one of the largest and most expensive salvage operations of its kind, estimated at $5million at the time (equivalent to $million in ), the ship was stripped of superstructure and righted on 7 August 1943. She was renamed &quot;Lafayette&quot; and reclassified as an aircraft and transport ferry, APV-4, on 15 September 1943 and placed in drydock the following month. However, extensive damage to her hull, deterioration of her machinery, and the necessity for employing manpower on other more critical war projects prevented resumption of the conversion program, with the cost of restoring her determined to be too great. Her hulk remained in the Navy&#x27;s custody through the end of the war.

&quot;Lafayette&quot; was stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 11 October 1945 without having ever sailed under the U.S. flag. President Harry Truman authorized her disposal in an Executive Order on 8 September 1946, and she was sold as scrap on 3 October 1946 to Lipsett, Inc., an American salvage company based in New York City, for US$161,680 (approx. $1,997,000 in 2017 value). After neither the Navy nor French Line offered a plan to salvage her, Yourkevitch, the ship&#x27;s original designer, proposed to cut the ship down and restore her as a mid-sized liner. This plan also failed to draw backing. She was sent for scrapping beginning in October 1946 at Port Newark, New Jersey, and completely scrapped by 31 December 1948.

==Legacy==
The silhouette of &quot;Normandie&quot; influenced ocean liners over the decades, including &quot;Queen Mary 2&quot;. The ambience of classic transatlantic liners like &quot;Normandie&quot; and &quot;Queen Mary&quot; was the source of inspiration for Disney Cruise Line&#x27;s matching vessels, &quot;Disney Magic,&quot; &quot;Disney Wonder&quot;, &quot;Disney Dream&quot;, and &quot;Disney Fantasy&quot;.
&quot;Normandie&quot; also inspired the architecture and design of the Normandie Hotel in San Juan, Puerto Rico. The hotel&#x27;s roof sign is one of the two signs that adorned the top deck of &quot;Normandie&quot; but were removed from it during an early refitting. It also inspired the nickname &#x27;The Normandie&#x27; given to the International Savings Society Apartments in Shanghai, one of the most fashionable residential buildings during the city&#x27;s pre-revolutionary heyday and home to several stars of China&#x27;s mid-20th century film industry. &quot;Normandie&quot; name also may have inspired that of The Normandy apartment building in New York City.

Items from &quot;Normandie&quot; were sold at a series of auctions after her demise, and many pieces are considered valuable Art Deco treasures today. The rescued items include the ten large dining-room door medallions and fittings, and some of the individual Jean Dupas glass panels that formed the large murals mounted at the four corners of her Grand Salon. One entire corner is preserved at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. The dining room door medallions are now on the exterior doors of Our Lady of Lebanon Maronite Cathedral in Brooklyn.
Also surviving are some examples of the 24,000 pieces of crystal, some from the massive Lalique torchères that adorned her dining salon. Also extant are some of the room&#x27;s table silverware, chairs, and gold-plated bronze table bases. Custom-designed suite and cabin furniture as well as original artwork and statues that decorated the ship, or were built for use by the CGT aboard &quot;Normandie&quot;, also survive today.

The , bronze figural sculpture of a woman named &quot;&quot;La Normandie&quot;, which was at the top of the grand stairway from the first class smoking room up to the grill room café, was found in a New Jersey scrapyard in 1954 and was purchased for the then-new Fontainebleau Hotel in Miami Beach, Florida. It was first displayed outside in the parterre gardens near the formal pool and later indoors near the then-Fontainebleau Hilton&#x27;s spa. In 2001, the hotel sold the statue to Celebrity Cruises, which placed it in the main dining room of their new ship &quot;Celebrity Summit&quot;. The cruise ship also had a separate Normandie Restaurant, designed to reflect the interiors of the liner, and containing gold lacquered panels from the Normandie&#x27;s First Class Smoking Room. The Normandie Restaurant and associated ocean liner decor was removed in 2015. The statue &quot;La Paix&quot;&quot;, which stood in the First Class Dining Room, now stands in the Pinelawn Memorial Park, a cemetery in New York.

The three-note chime steam whistle, after salvage, was sent to the Bethlehem Steel factory in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, where it was used to announce shift changes. It later resided in the Pratt Institute in Brooklyn and was used in their New Year&#x27;s Eve steam whistle ceremony until 2014. This whistle is now at SUNY Maritime Fort Schuyler.

Pieces from &quot;Normandie&quot; occasionally appear on the BBC television series &quot;Antiques Roadshow&quot; and also on its American counterpart. A public lounge and promenade was created from some of the panels and furniture from &quot;Normandie&quot; in the Hilton Chicago. The dining room &quot;Normandie&quot; on the Carnival Cruise ship &quot;Carnival Pride&quot; was also inspired by the ocean liner, per the ship&#x27;s designer Joseph Farcus.

Though not shown explicitly, &quot;the majestic form of the &quot;Normandie&quot;&quot; appears in the Tintin story, &quot;The Broken Ear&quot;.

<doc id="935379" wikidata="Q516255" url="?curid=935379" title="George Graham Vest">
<text>George Graham Vest (December 6, 1830August 9, 1904) was an American politician. Born in Frankfort, Kentucky, he was known for his skills in oration and debate. Vest, a lawyer as well as a politician, served as a Missouri Congressman, a Confederate Congressman during the Civil War, and finally a U.S. Senator.

Vest was best known during his lifetime for his a &quot;man&#x27;s best friend&quot; closing arguments from the trial in which damages were sought for the killing of a dog named Old Drum on October 18, 1869.

==Early life and career==
Vest graduated from Centre College, Danville, Kentucky, in 1848 and from the law department of Transylvania University, Lexington, Kentucky, in 1853. He was admitted to the bar in 1853 and planned to move to California. However, while en route, he stopped in Pettis County, Missouri, where he defended a young African-American man accused of murder. Vest&#x27;s client was acquitted but soon burned at the stake by an angry mob. Vest&#x27;s own life was also threatened, but he nonetheless decided to stay in Missouri permanently, settling in Georgetown. In 1854 he married Sallie Sneed of Danville, Kentucky. They had three children, two sons and a daughter.

==Initial public service==
In 1860, after moving to Boonville, Missouri, he was elected to the Missouri House of Representatives and served as a Democratic presidential elector. As a Missouri representative he was chairman of the Committee on Federal Relations. Vest served in the House until late 1861 during which he wrote the Vest Resolutions in which he denounced coercion of the South.

When the Civil War broke out Vest was a strong advocate of maintaining slavery during the Missouri secession crisis, and eventually sided with the Confederacy. He proposed the Secession Ordinance that was passed by the Missouri legislature in October 1861. The following year, he briefly served as judge advocate with the Army of Missouri, commanded by former Governor Sterling Price. He served in the House of Representatives of the Confederate Congress from February 1862 to January 12, 1865, when he resigned, having been appointed to fill a vacancy in the Confederate Senate.

==Old Drum==


After the war he returned to Pettis County moving to Sedalia, Missouri, and resumed his law practice. It was at this time in 1869 that Vest was asked to represent Charles Burden and Old Drum in the case that would make him famous, &quot;Burden v. Hornsby&quot;.

Vest took the case tried on September 23, 1870, in which he represented a client whose hunting dog, a foxhound named Drum (or Old Drum), had been killed by a sheep farmer, Leonidas Hornsby. The farmer (Burden&#x27;s brother-in-law) had previously announced his intentions to kill any dog found on his property; the dog&#x27;s owner was suing for damages in the amount of
$150 (), the maximum allowed by law.

During the trial, Vest stated that he would &quot;win the case or apologize to every dog in Missouri&quot;. Vest&#x27;s closing argument to the jury made no reference to any of the testimony offered during the trial, and instead offered a eulogy of sorts. Vest&#x27;s &quot;Eulogy of the Dog&quot; is one of the most enduring passages of purple prose in American courtroom history (only a partial transcript has survived):

Vest won the case (the jury awarded $50 to the dog&#x27;s owner) and also won its appeal to the Missouri Supreme Court. A bust of the dog resides in the Missouri Supreme Court building in Jefferson City, Missouri. In 1958, a statue of the dog was erected on the Johnson County Courthouse lawn containing a summation of Vest&#x27;s closing speech, &quot;A man&#x27;s best friend is his dog&quot;.

===Movie depictions===
The speech has been used in movies which are set in Missouri and involve sheep owners who allegedly shoot the dog but are then shot themselves by the dog&#x27;s owners, who are then tried for murder.

* &quot;Tribute to the Dog&quot;, episode 9, season 13 of &quot;Death Valley Days&quot; (TV series), featuring Ronald Reagan in the role of George Vest – 1964
* &quot;The Trial of Old Drum&quot; – 2000

==U.S. Senate==
In 1877, Vest moved to Kansas City, Missouri, where he was elected two years later in 1879 to the United States Senate. He was chairman on the Committee on Public Buildings and Grounds (Fifty-third Congress) and served on the Committee on Epidemic Diseases (Fifty-fourth Congress), Committee on Public Health and National Quarantine (Fifty-fourth through Fifty-seventh Congresses). He was re-elected for three more terms in 1885, 1891 and 1897 and remained a US Senator until March 4, 1903, when he retired from public life due to ill health.

===Defender of Yellowstone===
In 1882, Vest became aware of concession abuses and outright attempts at uncontrolled monopolies being proposed for Yellowstone National Park concessions by the railroads and other businessmen. He introduced and eventually helped pass legislation that required the Secretary of Interior to submit concession and construction contracts to the Senate for oversight thus stifling potential corruption and abuses. Throughout the remainder of his Senate career, Vest was considered the &quot;Self-appointed Protector of Yellowstone National Park&quot;.

==Death==
On August 9, 1904, Vest died at his summer home in Sweet Springs, Missouri, the last living Confederate States Senator. He was buried at Bellefontaine Cemetery in St. Louis, Missouri.

<text>Stuart Island is one of the San Juan Islands, north of San Juan Island and west of Waldron Island in the U.S. state of Washington. The island is home to two communities of full and part-time residents, a state park, a one-room schoolhouse, and two airstrips. 

==History==
Stuart Island was named by Charles Wilkes during the Wilkes Expedition of 1838–42, to honor Frederick D. Stuart, the captain&#x27;s clerk of the expedition.

Prevost Harbor is named for James Charles Prevost, captain of . Nearby Prevost Island in British Columbia is also named after Prevost, while Satellite Island is named after his ship.

==Arts and culture==

===Parks and recreation===

Two sites, both part of Stuart Island State Park, are on public lands. One is located near the center of the island, and another is on the western coast, the site of the Turn Point Light Station, a lighthouse guiding shipping in the busy waters of Boundary Pass to the island&#x27;s north. Turn Point Light Station is on land administered by the Bureau of Land Management&#x27;s Spokane District, Wenatchee Resource Area, Lopez Island Office.

Sheltered anchorages for boaters can be found in Reid Harbor and Prevost Harbor, with public state park facilities in each.

Satellite Island, which lies in Prevost Harbor on the northeast side of the island, is used by YMCA Camp Orkila as a basecamp for teen expeditions and for field trips by campers.

==Infrastructure==
Two airstrips are located on the island. Stuart Island Airstrip (7WA5) is a grass runway, and Stuart Island West (2WA3) is a dirt runway).

<text>The Chilkoot River is a river in Southeast Alaska, United States, that extends about from its source and covers a watershed area of . The source of the river is in the Takshanuk Mountains to the west and the Freebee glacier and unnamed mountains to the east. From its source, the upper reach of the river extends approximately to the point where it enters Chilkoot Lake. From the downstream end of the lake, the lower reach of the river flows for about until it enters the Chilkoot Inlet, a branch at the northern end of the Lynn Canal.

At the head of the lower reach of the river, on the shore of the lake, lies a prehistoric village which was a Chilkoot Indian settlement. The names of the village — Tschilkut, Tananel, or Chilcoot — have been given to the river and also to the lake.
The river and its precincts, known as the Chilkoot River Corridor, have been brought under the monitoring of the Chilkoot River Corridor Strategic Planning Project (CRC) to preserve its ecological and historical heritage. A fishing weir has also been constructed on the river to monitor and count fish moving from the lake into the lower reaches of the Chilkoot River and the Chilkoot Inlet.

==Topography==
The Chilkoot River near Haines has a short length of about from the source covering a watershed area of . The source of the river is in the Takshanuk Mountains to the west and the Ferebee glacier and unnamed mountains to the east.

There are three stretches of the river from its source. These are: the &quot;Upper Reach of the Chilkoot River&quot; from the lake&#x27;s mouth upstream to the glacier head, which is about ; the &quot;Chilkoot Lake&quot; fed by the upper reach of the river extends to about length followed by the &quot;Chilkoot Lower reach&quot;, which is till it joins the Lynn Canal.

The Upper Chilkoot River originates from the glacier fields and flows in a southeasterly direction. It is a braided river and has a bed slope of 1 ft in 50 ft in the first stretch from the lake and about 1 ft in 100 ft in the balance reach of the river. The river is blocked with debris, rifles, log jams and boulders. Hence, the upper reach of the river is not navigable. The upstream reaches of the Chilkoot River and all other streams which flow into the lake are barred for fishing.

The Chilkoot Lake, which forms the middle stretch of the Chilkoot River, is marked on the quadrant map of the Skagway B 2 USGS in the Heines County at an altitude of . The lake is about long (3.6 miles is also mentioned in one source), and about in width and maximum depth of water in the lake is about . It has been declared as navigable. The land around the lake () is mostly under the control of the State. The lake area is generally windy. Canoes are the best form of boating facility for fishing on the lake as the shore line is considered difficult.

The lower reach of the Chilkoot River below the outlet from the Chilkoot Lake at is 1.5 miles (a figure of is also mentioned in some sources) long till it meets the Lynn Canal of the Chilkoot Inlet. The river runs in northwest-northeast direction and is really only a small stream. It has a width of about and has a depth of on an average. It is navigable up to about upstream of the Lynn Canal, extending to the fish and game weir site (established by the Department of Fish and Game to enumerate the fishes), when under the influence of tides. The river, in its first one eighth mile (below the lake) has formed a pool, and then flows through a number of rapids strewn with boulders covered with moss in some stretches and the remaining part is flat but with rocky bed. The estimated average discharge in the river varies widely from a minimum of per second in February to a maximum of per second in August. 
The river, the recreation area on the southern shores of the Chilkoot Lake and the Lake are approached by road along the Lukat-Chilkoot River Roads, also popularly known as the &#x27;Bear Highway&#x27;, as brown bears frequent this road in search of pink and coho salmon. The Chilkoot Lake and the Chilkoot River outlet are about away from the town of Haines. The river stretch is popular for coho fishing during September–October, pink salmon fishing during late July and August, and fish species of chum salmon, Dolly Varden and sockeye all through the summer and fall.

==History==
The L’uknax Adi clan of Tlingit Indians, whose principal symbol is the red salmon or sockeye, traditionally owned the Chilkoot River and the Chilkoot Lake.

Another group of inhabitants of the Heines/Chilkoot River area are the Jilkoot Kwaan (Kwaan is Tlingit word meaning “to dwell”). They are a clan of the Tlingits who also owned land in the vicinity.

The history of the Chilkoot River and the Chilkoot Lake is directly linked to the Chilkoot village, where the Tlingits lived, after which the river and the lake are named. This village existed near the outlet of the Chilkoot River and was divided into two parts by the river; the western part was inhabited by Raven clan Tlingits while the Eagle Clan Tlingits lived on the eastern part. It was an important location for the southeast Alaskan Tlingits who reportedly settled here during pre-historic days when they became occupied in salmon and hooligan fishing. They used hooligan fish to make fish oil, their cooking medium, by cooking the fishes in a canoe lined with hot rocks.

&quot;Chilkoot&quot; is a Tlingit phrase which means &quot;without a storehouse&quot;. The Chilkoot band at one time stored fish packed in snow between alder or willow branches, instead of in storehouses.

The population of the village dwindled over the years from a figure of 127 people (in 1880 census), just to 2 houses with 7 people in June 1990, and was finally abandoned. Another factor for desertion of the village is attributed to the cannery industries that got established in the area for processing salmons that were fished from the river and the lake, in Haines and other places in the late 19th and early 20th century; the last Tlingit reportedly left the place in the early 1940s and most of the families now live in Haines. The fishing tools that the Tlingits used for fishing in the river and the lake in the past, which were mostly nets and gaff hooks, have also since been replaced with modern fishing rods and reels.

The biologists of Alaska Department of Fish and Game (ADF&amp;G) constructed a fishing weir across the Lower Chilkoot River in 1976 to enumerate the movement of Sockeye fishes from the Chilkoot lake downstream.

The road from the Lynn Canal to the outlet of the lake was extended and improved over a period from 1953 to 1956 by the Alaska Road Commission; the intended purpose was to have access to the recreation area for quality fishing and access to small boats to the river shores for extracting timber from the area for commercial purposes. The road on the upstream side of the lake known as &#x27;Cox Road&#x27; (named after a homestead owner in the upper reach of the river) on the west side of the lake was built in 1968.

Use of boats on the Chilkoot River and the lake from the Tlingit village was in the form of canoes rowed to the “Glory Hole,” at the upper end of the lake for harvesting salmons and also for hunting wild life in the hills. However, in the mid 20th century boats were used to transport construction materials and to the homestead built by Cox in the upper reach of the river. Now, commercial ships operate in the lake, catering to tourism for fishing, sightseeing and for hunting expeditions.

==Aqua fauna==
The aqua fauna found in abundance in the Chilkoot River, as one approaches along the Lynn Canal and the outlet stream from the Chilkoot Lake, are Bald eagles, harbor seals, bears feeding on salmon and mountain goats on the hill slopes. The aqua fauna found in the Chilkoot River moves down from the Chilkoot Lake. These are mostly Sockeye Salmon or red salmon found in profusion. According to the studies carried out by the Alaska Department of Fish and Game, 25% spawn of sockeye is from the sensitive habitat of the upper watershed in the upper reaches of the river, above the Chilkoot Lake. These studies also indicated that anadromous fish, coho, Dolly Varden, and an occasional chum salmon were found above the Chilkoot Lake in the spawning and rearing grounds.
Bald Eagles are seen on trees, on rocks and in flight, which are a popular sight during May through September. Apart from the bald eagles, Brown Bears are seen feeding in the river on salmons, mostly in spring and early summer. A plaque displayed on the right bank of the Chilkoot River, near the Deer Rock monument, reads &#x27;Salmon Forest&#x27;. The importance of the ecosystem has been briefly explained in this plaque highlighting the role of salmons in the food chain of eagles, bears, gulls, crows, ravens, other mammals and birds that carry it to the forests, which in turn enhance the forest and promote plant growth.

;Fishing tools and tackles
The aqua fauna found in the Chilkoot River are caught by the Tlingit Alaskan tribes by using long-handled scoop nets known as &quot;go qtc (gukwC),&quot; which is wide at the mouth and deep. Fireweed fiber, also called nettle or sinew, is wound round this device and the mesh is formed by tying it with mesh sticks with a double strand cord. A pole with two extended arms is used to hang the net, and as hung, it forms a quadrangular shape. The net is then immersed right up to the bed of the river from the bow end of the canoe (when its broadside drifts along the flow). The net is then drawn up swiftly against the current and with a quick turn of the wrist the contents are tipped into the boat. Semi conical baskets made of spruce rods are used in the fishing weirs built across the river to capture eulachon.

Another method adopted by the Chilkoot Tlingit for capturing salmon in the rocky shallows of the Chilkoot River was by channelizing the stream by constructing walls made of rock parallel to the river. At the upstream head of these short channels (less than ) they erected a small wooden platform. A single man would then stand on the platform and using a gaft hook capture the salmon fish that traveled up the artificial channel. However, in recent years modern tools of hook and rod have been widely adopted.

;Fishing weir

The fish species that are found in the Chilkoot River below the lake outlet are generally the sockeye salmon and Oncorhynchus nerka. In order to enumerate the salmon that pass down the river, the Alaska Department of Fish and Game, Division of Commercial Fisheries established a weir on the river, in 1976, a few hundred yards downstream from the outlet of the river from the lake, to carry out visual count of “the total sockeye escapement (postseason).” A report for the period 1996-2003 gives the counts done at the weir and also quantity estimates of the sockeye fishes.

==Chilkoot Lake State Recreation Site==
Chilkoot Lake State Recreation Site was established and managed by the Alaska Department of Natural Resources; Division of Parks and Outdoor Recreation. The recreation site sits amidst a forest of Sitka trees at the head of the Chilkoot River on the southern shore of Chilkoot Lake.) The lake is northeast of Haines following the Lutak and Chilkoot River roads, or ) past the ferry terminal. The site has ) of land with 32 campsite, 32 picnic shelters, and a boat launch. The precincts of the river and the lake provide some of the sites for salmon fishing during mid-June and ending in mid-October when large number of brown bears frequent the river and the lake to feed on spawning salmon. Consequently, the road along the river is sometimes called the ‘bear highway’.

===Campgrounds===
The prehistoric Chilkoot village has been converted into a camping area developed by the State Parks and Outdoor Recreation Division of the Alaska Department of Natural Resources.

===Other recreation===
A popular raft race known as the “Mad Raft Race” is an annual feature in the Lower Chilkoot River starting from the Chilkoot Lake. It is held during Fourth of July celebrations observed in Haines. Homemade rafts are plied during the race due to their light weight and ease of transportation across the fishing weir.

==Preservation issues==
Conflicts have arisen in the Chilkoot River Corridor (CRC) between humans and Alaskan brown bears, which frequent this region in large numbers during the months of August–September in search of spawning salmon. Consequently, a large number of visitors travel to the area to watch bears and bald eagles harvesting salmon along the river. To minimize human activities that disrupt the feeding bears, the Haines Chamber of Commerce, the Lynn Canal Conservation, Inc., and the Chilkoot Indian Association jointly launched the Chilkoot River Corridor Strategic Planning Project (CRC). The basic objective of this project was to develop and enact a plan for the longterm sustainable management of the existing natural, cultural, historical, and socio-economic resources of the Chilkoot River Corridor. After several meetings, the CRC has identified for action the following, as a guide to the Alaska Chilkoot Bear Foundation to act upon:

;Management issues
These issue relate to enhancing capability of the State Agency to Manage Recreational Use, create a self-help program for the visitors to avoid interference; minimize use of overnight camping along the CRC, create more spacious parking space and avoid incidence of damage to the lake from use of motorized transport; minimize, respect and preserve Chilkoot Historical Resources; launch &#x27;Public Awareness Programs&#x27; of the cultural significance of the area and help existence of the Chilkoot Culture Camp.

;Wildlife issues
Wildlife issues of concern are: avoidance of ‘Human-Wildlife Conflicts’ by monitoring and improving visitor activity with adequate interaction; to enhance habitat and scenic values, and to ensure that exclusive corridors are maintained for the Brown Bears to access/egress their feeding areas in the Chilkoot River, totally unhampered.

;Future planning
This essential planning is a continuing process to identify and interpret &#x27;Brown Bear Habitat and Use Patterns&#x27; so that the Agency could take appropriate further development decisions.

===Statutes===
Considering the large number of visitors recorded in recent years to visit the Chilkoot River Corridor and which has generated large commercial operations, a working Group of the &#x27;Stake Holders&#x27; formulated guidelines for use of the River Corridor. These guidelines have been published in the form of &#x27;Statutes and Regulations&#x27; made applicable throughout the state of Alaska including the Chilkoot River Corridor. These Acts relate to the Feeding of Bears under “Act 5AAC 92.230” with exceptions to trapping of wild Black Bears under “Act 5AAC 84-AAC92”, and Harassment of Wild Life under “Alaska Statute 16.05.920” with exception under Act 5AAC 92.440 with regard to “Taking game in defense of life and property”. A plaque has been displayed at the visitor center on the right bank of the Chilkoot River near the heritage monument of the Tlingits, the “Deer Rock.” A summary of the statute regulations is recorded as:

<text>The Cobweb is a 1996 novel written by Neal Stephenson with J. Frederick George, a pseudonym for Stephenson&#x27;s uncle, historian George Jewsbury. It was originally published under the collective pseudonym &quot;Stephen Bury&quot;, as was their earlier novel &quot;Interface&quot; (1994).

==Setting==
During the first Gulf War, Iraq fired missiles at Israel in an attempt to draw it into the conflict. This strategy was intended to lose the support of Arab/Muslim countries for the US-led military coalition.

In reality, Iraq did not use biological or chemical warheads in these missiles. The story fictionalizes that this was because the story&#x27;s protagonists foiled an Iraqi scheme to develop a biological toxin.

Much of the novel takes place in the fictional Iowan twin towns of Wapsipinicon-Nishnabotna, named for the Wapsipinicon and Nishnabotna rivers. These towns are based on Ames, Iowa, home of Iowa State University (represented by &quot;Eastern Iowa University&quot; in the story), and also where Stephenson attended Ames High School.

==Plot==
Betsy Vandeventer, a CIA analyst in Washington D.C., discovers irregularities in federal spending which point towards Eastern Iowa University. There, her academic brother Kevin has been corralled into working for corporate interests, including unknowingly assisting Iraqi intelligence agents to be admitted to the U.S. under the guise of Jordanian research students.

Clyde Banks, a Deputy Sheriff of Wapsipinicon-Nishnabotna, is assigned mostly night shifts after announcing he will run against his boss for the position of Sheriff. With his military nurse wife having been dispatched to the Gulf to prepare for war, he has time to contemplate connections between some odd events - including the death of a Middle-Eastern student, a horse with botulism, and the sudden change in fortunes of his real estate broker.

Vandeventer is stymied by Millikan, an American diplomat who has been misled by (a fictional version of) Tariq Aziz that Saddam Hussein will not invade Kuwait. She is then unwittingly co-opted by CIA agent Hennessy, who has a rivalry with Millikan and has formed a group to weed out moles but needs to act domestically, i.e. out of the agency&#x27;s remit, to do so.

Kevin Vandevanter correctly predicts he will be murdered and had asked Banks, who has been contacted by Hennessy&#x27;s group as &quot;eyes on the ground&quot;, to look more closely into the circumstances. This eventually leads Banks to conclude that the Iraqi agents have been synthesizing and testing botulinum toxin at the university, and storing it in a warehouse they have purchased near the airport (along with a large number of decoy warehouses purchased around the town). However, by this time the toxin has been covertly loaded onto a cargo plane which will be hijacked by the agents for transport to Iraq.

In the course of his police duties and investigation, Banks had befriended a Wakhi (called &quot;Vakhan Turks&quot; in the text) whose network has a mole in the CIA and has also been monitoring the phony students. Together, they sneak on board to try and prevent the plane reaching the Iraqi military. As Banks had the foresight to, with the help of an emeritus professor, immunize himself against botulinum, the Iraqis fail to kill him with the toxin and Banks convinces the pilots to land in Canada.

Millikan takes credit for the operation&#x27;s success.

<doc id="935388" wikidata="Q4636157" url="?curid=935388" title="39th Infantry Division (India)">
<text>39th Indian Infantry Division (originally the 1st Burma Division) was an infantry division of the Indian Army during World War II, which became a training division in 1943 after its recovery into India from Burma. The division was re-raised after independence and 39 Mountain Division is presently located in Palampur, Himachal Pradesh under XVI Corps. 

==History==
The 1st Burma Infantry Division was formed 14 July 1941 at Toungoo in Burma. The division was part of the British Burma Army.

On the outbreak of war, the division was commanded by Major-General James Bruce Scott. It consisted of the 1st and 2nd Burma Infantry Brigades, and the 13th Indian Infantry Brigade. Throughout the Japanese conquest of Burma, the division interchanged many units with its fellow Burma Corps component, 17th Indian Infantry Division. At various times the 7th Armoured Brigade, 16th Indian Infantry Brigade, 48th Indian Infantry Brigade, and 63rd Indian Infantry Brigade came under command of the division, though only the original three brigades finally entered India as part of the division at the end of the arduous retreat, reduced to fractions of their original strength.

The 1st Burma Division changed to an Indian formation at the end of the 1942 campaign. While the majority of the Burma Army was reconstituted elsewhere in India, the division headquarters was retained at the front.

The 39th division was soon re-roled as a light division with two infantry brigades and Mule and jeep transport companies. However this change happened more in name than in anything else as it never actually began to convert to an entirely mule and jeep based transport and supply system.

The decision to convert the division to a training role was undertaken in June 1943 after the poorly executed Arakan offensive when it was realised that the troops being sent into the field, both British and Indian, while not lacking conventional military fighting skills, lacked the necessary knowledge and training to operate in the Burmese jungle. The 39th was joined in its training role by the 14th Indian Infantry Division which had been the main operational unit during the Arakan offensive and had suffered badly both in terms of casualties and morale as a result.

Post World War II, the division was disbanded between January and March 1946 as part of the demobilisation policy.

The 39 Infantry Division was re-raised at Jhansi under the command of Major General ML Thapan on 15 July 1966. At formation, the division had an independent parachute brigade and an artillery brigade. The 87 Infantry Brigade (Shakargarh Brigade) and 323 Infantry Brigade (Dalhousie Brigade) joined the division in January 1966. The Parachute Brigade was replaced by the 33 Infantry Brigade (Thanpir Brigade) in October 1967. The division moved from Jhansi to Yol, Himachal Pradesh in March 1970 and was converted to a mountain division in January 1986. The division was moved to Poonch and Rajouri border districts in 1994 following the rise of terrorism in the state of Jammu and Kashmir. It was withdrawn to its base in Palampur in Himachal Pradesh in 2009. The division presently has the following brigades -
*33 Mountain Brigade at Dharamshala
*87 Mountain Brigade at Udhampur
*323 Mountain Brigade at Dalhousie Cantonment
*39 Mountain Artillery Brigade at Alhilal

===Operations===
;Indo-Pakistani War of 1971
The division was under the command of Major General BR Prabhu during the 1971 war. It was initially placed under the XV Corps in a defensive role. It then moved to I Corps in the Shakargarh sector. Its task was to move along the Mawa-Dehlra axis and capture Shakargarh. The division had shed two of its three integral brigades and was allotted 72 Infantry Brigade from 36 Infantry Division, 2 Independent Armoured Brigade (less one regiment) and one mechanised battalion. 33 Infantry Division was sent to reinforce Poonch and 323 Infantry Division to &#x27;X Sector&#x27; west of Degh Nadi.

The order of battle of the division was -
*87 Infantry Brigade (moved to 36 Division after 12 December 1971)
**3/9 Gorkha Rifles
*72 Infantry Brigade (from 36 Infantry Division) (Brigadier JM Vohra)
**1 Mahar (from 115 Brigade of 36 Infantry Division)
**15 Grenadiers
**22 Punjab
**3 Sikh Light Infantry
*2 Independent Armoured Brigade (Brigadier RN Thumby)
**1st Horse (Skinner&#x27;s Horse)
**7 Light Cavalry 
**14 Horse (Scinde Horse)
**1 Dogra (Mechanised)
**91 Independent Reconnaissance Squadron (from 14 Horse)
*39 Artillery Brigade (Brigadier Gurbachan Singh)
**92 Field Regiment
**101 Field Regiment (Self Propelled) 
**36 Light Regiment (less a battery)
**186 Light Regiment (less a battery)
**77 Medium Regiment (one battery)
**45 AD Regiment (one troop)

The divisional offensive started on the morning of 5 December 1971, with 92 Field Regiment knocking out the Pakistani Artillery Observation Post (OP) at Sukhmal. At night, 72 Infantry Brigade captured the Pakistani border posts. They faced heavy artillery fire, slowing the advance. 1 Dogra came in contact with the enemy at Harar Kalan on the noon of 7 December 1971. The battalion launched a frontal attack the same night, but faced heavy enemy fire leading to 25 killed and 65 wounded and the attack was called off. During the same time, 15 Grenadiers, 22 Punjab and 3 Sikh Light Infantry captured Khaira, Chak Amru and Parni respectively. The setback at Harar Kalan though affected the division’s speed of advance. 

72 Infantry Brigade with better preparation and planning and supported well by the artillery subsequently attacked and captured Harar Kalan on the night of 10 December 1971. At the same time, 15 Grenadiers, 22 Punjab and 3 Sikh Light Infantry captured Harar Khurd, Shahbazpur and Munam respectively. 

Because of the slow advance of the division compared to the 54 Infantry Division, there was a change in strategy and regrouping of forces. The division was assigned a defensive role in the Ramgarh-Samba gap. 87 Infantry Brigade, Headquarters 2 Independent Armoured Brigade and 1 Horse were moved to reinforce 36 Infantry Brigade. 72 Infantry Brigade and 7 Light Cavalry were moved to form the fourth brigade under 54 Infantry Division.

101 Field Regiment (Self Propelled) which had provided accurate and effective artillery fire during the offence was subsequently awarded the honour title &quot;Harar Kalan&quot;.

<text>Mark Simon Peter Robinson (born 12 May 1959) is a Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) politician, who was a  Member of the Northern Ireland Assembly (MLA) for Belfast South from 1998 to 2007. He served two terms, from the inception of the Assembly in 1998 until 2007.

==Political career==
In 1998 he was elected to the Northern Ireland Assembly from Belfast South. He increased his vote in the 2003 election and was returned in second place. He ran for re-election in 2007 but was defeated by Jimmy Spratt.

He also served two terms on Castlereagh Borough Council, being elected in 2001.

He has come under fire in the media for running up one of the highest travel expenses of any of the 108 MLAs, despite representing a constituency neighbouring that which Parliament Buildings is in. A party source said that he was living outside his constituency for family reasons. He declared part-time employment with Marks and Spencer in the Register of Members&#x27; Interests in 2006 on top of his Assembly salary.

<doc id="935395" wikidata="Q8030878" url="?curid=935395" title="Women's Educational Equity Act">
<text>The Women&#x27;s Educational Equity Act (WEEA) of 1974 is one of the several landmark laws passed by the United States Congress outlining federal protections against the gender discrimination of women in education (educational equity). WEEA was enacted as Section 513 of P.L. 93-380. Introduced in the United States House of Representatives by Congresswoman Patsy Mink of Hawaii, the legislation was conceived and drafted by Arlene Horowitz, a staff assistant to the education subcommittee on which Mink served. WEEA was intended to combat sex-role stereotyping in elementary and secondary schools.

== Passage ==
The legislation was first proposed by Rep. Mink in response to efforts by other legislators to weaken Title IX, a statute prohibiting sex discrimination in federally funded education programs and activities that had passed in 1972.

Billie Jean King, a female professional tennis player, used her sports celebrity to speak in favor of the Women&#x27;s Educational Equity Act of 1973 (WEEA) before it became a law. On November 9, 1973, King testified before the United States Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions and spoke about problems in women&#x27;s sports. King stated that the benefit of sports was denied to women in educational programs, such as budgets for women&#x27;s sports being less than men&#x27;s sports. King&#x27;s testimony brought attention to issues in women&#x27;s sports and helped with the consideration of the Women&#x27;s Educational Equity Act. 

Mink&#x27;s bill was defeated in the House, but Senator Walter Mondale attached the bill to the broader Elementary and Secondary Education Act (H.R. 69) being debated in the Senate, and Mink worked to have this version approved in the cross-chamber conference committee. The WEEA was passed as part of the Elementary and Secondary Education Amendments and was signed into law on August 21, 1974.

== Content ==
The Women&#x27;s Educational Equity Act authorizes grants “…to develop nonsexist curricula, personnel training programs, and vocational and career counseling.” In addition to these grants, the improvement of physical education programs is also included. These funds helped education facilities to meet the requirements of Title IX.

== Implementation ==
In 1982, Leslie Wolfe, WEEA&#x27;s director when Ronald Reagan was elected to the U.S. presidency, was transferred out of that position and people aligned with Phyllis Schlafly&#x27;s Eagle Forum were brought in to review grant proposals being considered for WEEA funds. In 1984, Congress rewrote the WEEA legislation making its mission and purpose more explicit and therefore keeping its actions true to its original goal.

During the Reagan Administration, the assistant secretary of education, Jean Benish, implemented a review process which included all walks of people and provided a fair and equitable grant review process which was all-inclusive of women&#x27;s issues. In 1984, Congress rewrote the WEEA legislation making its mission and purpose more explicit.

In 2003, the George W. Bush administration ended federal funds for WEEA&#x27;s Resource Center, a mechanism for collection and sharing of information about gender equity programs.

The last documented funding for WEEA was in 2010. For the fiscal year 2018, the President&#x27;s budget does not request funding for WEEA.

<text>BeForU was a Japanese pop girl group that performed music primarily for the Bemani series of rhythm games. Their 2000 debut song &quot;Dive&quot; was particularly notable as being the first Japanese-language pop song in the &quot;Dance Dance Revolution&quot; series. BeForU was produced by Naoki Maeda, one of the lead Konami musical producers. In 2006, the group made their major label debut under Avex Trax.

==Biography==

===The first generation===
BeForU formed via a competition held on November 20, 2000, for a new J-pop group singing for Konami and their bemani series of video games, namely Dance Dance Revolution. The four winners chosen for their talent, ability and emphasis were Riyu Kosaka (then aged 15; born January 17, 1985), Noria Shiraishi (then aged 19; born September 12, 1981), Yoma Komatsu (then aged 26; born December 30, 1974) and Shiyuna Maehara (then aged 21; born November 30, 1979). Their first single &quot;Dive&quot;, promoted widely throughout the J-Pop community, appeared in the 2001 French film &quot;Wasabi&quot;, made its first appearance on &quot;DDR Extra Mix&quot;, and its official debut on &quot;DDR 5th Mix&quot;.

The group name &quot;BeForU&quot;, the winning result of a contest to name the group, is both a reference to the song &quot;B4U&quot; from &quot;DDR 4th Mix&quot; (composed and produced by Naoki Maeda) and a play on the words &quot;before you.&quot; In another play on words, when BeForU originally formed, they had four members. In &quot;DDRMAX 6th Mix&quot;, BeForU released another song entitled &quot;Firefly&quot;. Riyu also performed two solos which were then released on her first solo single, &quot;true...&quot;. By &quot;DDR -Max 2- 7th Mix&quot;, Shiyuna was the only member of the group that had not received a solo in any Bemani game. As a group, they released another song entitled &quot;Break Down!&quot;, that was later re-arranged for Guitar Freaks and DrumMania. Yoma debuted as a soloist with her song &quot;ever snow&quot;, her only solo song at her time she was in the group. Their eponymous first album &quot;BeForU&quot; was released on November 28, 2003. In 2004, Shiyuna, the only BeForU member without any solos, left the group to pursue other venues.

===New members and Avex label===
After Shiyuna&#x27;s departure, BeForU had another contest for two new members. Somewhere along the line, there was a tie for either first or second place, so the grand total became six instead of five. The additions were Miharu Arisawa (born October 12, 1989), Sayaka Minami (born December 24, 1983), and Risa Sotohana (born January 28, 1988). These girls would form the second generation of BeForU known as &quot;BeForU NEXT&quot;. This new generation of BeForU debuted with their single &quot;KI・SE・KI&quot;, released on November 18, 2004. This song was released as a CD-single and was featured in DDR Festival, both released on the same day. BeForU released a new album, &quot;BeForU II&quot;, on February 14, 2006. They also performed live for the first time, which was released later that year, on DVD as BeForU FIRST LIVE at ZeppTokyo 2006.

From that point, there were no releases on CD until a Bemani secret live event in which Riyu Kosaka and Noria revealed that they had signed onto the Avex label and would subsequently release a single each. In the following month, BeForU soon followed and released the single &quot;Red Rocket Rising&quot; on November 1, 2006. On December 22, 2006, BeForU released &quot;Get set Go!! BeForU Astronauts Set&quot;, which contained the song &quot;Get set GO!!&quot;. Their single &quot;Strike Party!!!&quot; followed, and was released on January 17, 2007. &quot;Strike Party!!!&quot; is featured during the ending credits of the 3rd season of the anime MAJOR. They also released an EP called &quot;6Notes&quot; on March 3 that was under their Be+Wings Records label. Each of the 6 songs is a solo by each member. This CD was only available at live events and on their website and as of February 29, 2008, is no longer available.

BeForU&#x27;s third album, &quot;BeForU III: Breaking Into the Probability Changes&quot; was released on March 14, 2007, under the Avex label. Following this, BeForU returned to Zepp Tokyo and performed live for &quot;BeForU LIVE 2007 at Zepp Tokyo&quot; and a DVD was released later. The next single released by the group was &quot;Yoru Hanabi&quot;, released on July 11, 2007. Following its release, the group was quiet for the rest of that year, though Riyu continued to release solo singles.

On December 12, 2007, Riyu announced on her blog that due to illness, Miharu Arisawa would retire from the group. Similarly, Yoma Komatsu had chosen to depart for personal reasons. Their departures were effective immediately, and as such, these two members would be unable to perform at a scheduled concert on December 30, where a &quot;graduation&quot; took place for Noria and Risa Sotohana. These two members planned to move on to solo careers.

===Third generation and Indefinite hiatus===
On February 15, 2008, the Be+Wings site was reopened and it was announced that three new members would be joining the group: Ayano Tachibana (born March 8, 1988), Hiromi Nishiuchi (born March 8, 1989) and Megumi Fukushita (born April 24, 1984). A new song entitled &quot;Kimi to Sora to Zutto&quot; was announced at Riyu&#x27;s Carnival and the 3rd Generation performed it, without Sayaka due to illness. Sayaka later announced that her recuperating was not going well, and that she had left the group.

The debut of the third generation, as well as Riyu&#x27;s solo concert was filmed and released on DVD as &quot;BeForU/Four Piece Riyu Kosaka/Live 2008&quot;. The first official single from the group followed on September 10, 2008, but not on the Avex label. Instead, it released on their new label, Gambit (Sheeps Eyes). This single, &quot;Shangri-La&quot; was a cover of a Denki Groove song of the same name. Their next album, also titled &quot;Shangri-La &quot; but written in katakana (シャングリラ) this time, followed on October 8, 2008. There have been no recent news or updates about the group since 2009 and their website no longer exists. There has also been no mention of BeForU on members&#x27; blogs. It is assumed that BeForU was disbanded shortly after the release of シャングリラ.

With the release of &quot;Dance Dance Revolution X&quot; on December 24, 2008, in Japan, and worldwide in June 2009, &quot;Chikara&quot; is the only song from BeForU available in the game. In contrast, both &quot;SuperNova&quot; games featured a total of nine BeForU songs, plus many solo songs. With the release of &quot;Dance Dance Revolution X2&quot; on July 7, 2010, in Japan, four of the group&#x27;s songs returned: &quot;Chikara&quot; is available by default, while the remainder must be unlocked with the Enjoy Level system in Asia. All four songs are available by default on February 23, 2011, in Asia, and on the release date in North America and Europe, including in all subsequent &quot;Dance Dance Revolution&quot; games worldwide. This also applies to &quot;Tears&quot; and &quot;Under the Sky&quot;, which are solo songs by Noria Shiraishi and Sayaka Minami, respectively.

* &quot;BeForU&quot;
* &quot;BeForU II&quot;
* &quot;BeForU III&quot;
* &quot;Shangri-La&quot; (&quot;シャングリラ&quot;)

===Video games===
BeForU has a total of 9 songs and one remix in the &quot;Dance Dance Revolution&quot; series.
In addition, two songs featuring a BeForU solo member other than Riyu Kosaka are present in the series.
 This song is credited to Naoki Underground featuring EK. EK refers to BeForU member Noria Shiraishi.
 This song is credited to Sayaka Minami (BeForU) with platoniX.

<doc id="935407" wikidata="Q603314" url="?curid=935407" title="Bobby Previte">
<text>Bobby Previte (born July 16, 1951 in Niagara Falls, New York) is a drummer, composer, and bandleader. He earned a degree in economics from the University at Buffalo, where he also studied percussion. He moved to New York City in 1979 and began professional relationships with John Zorn, Wayne Horvitz, and Elliott Sharp.

==Composer==
Previte has received critical acclaim for his &quot;exceptional abilities as a composer and orchestrator.&quot; A review of his 1988 album &quot;Claude&#x27;s Late Morning&quot; reports that &quot;Perhaps most striking is Previte&#x27;s skill in composing music that fully integrates these disparate instruments — including drums and drum machine, electric guitar and keyboards, trombone, harp, accordion, banjo, pedal steel guitar, tuba, and harmonica — while emphasizing each instrument&#x27;s unique, individual sound.&quot; Another critic notes Previte&#x27;s &quot;driving and propulsive compositions, featuring both fiery jazz expressionism and layered counterpoint that suggested elements of contemporary minimalism.

In 1991, he wrote the score for &quot;Cirk Valentin&quot; (Moscow Circus on Stage), a stage show consisting of circus acts created by Valentin Gneushev that performed at the Gershwin Theatre on Broadway.

Recent large-scale compositional works as of Spring 2007 include:
*&quot;The Constellations Ensemble,&quot; a chamber group touring the multi-media show, &quot;The 23 Constellations of Joan Miró&quot;.
*&quot;The Separation&quot;, a collaboration with writer/director Andrea Kleine &quot;dealing with the role of religion in society. Based on the 15th-century composer Guilliaume Dufay&#x27;s Missa Sancti Jacobi and written for early music pioneers the Rose Ensemble with electric band.&quot;
==Performer==
Previte has received excellent reviews and full articles in major newspapers such as &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, and &quot;The Guardian&quot; for playing a wide range of genres and venues and for qualities as diverse as his intellectual aesthetic to his ability &quot;to groove.&quot; Recent and current projects as of Spring 2007 include :
*&quot;Dialed In,&quot; a solo electronic drum show collaboration with video artist Benton C Bainbridge.
*The Coalition of the Willing, a guitar quartet featuring Charlie Hunter, Steven Bernstein and Jamie Saft.
*&quot;Strike&quot;, a new quartet with organist Marco Benevento and two saxophones.
*&quot;Groundtruther&quot;, a duo with Hunter.
*&quot;The Beta Popes&quot;, a power trio with Skerik and Saft.
*&quot;Swami LatePlate,&quot; a duo with Jamie Saft.

Much of Previte&#x27;s work is also improvisational. One of Previte&#x27;s own favorite recorded improvisational collaborations was with John Zorn, &quot;Euclid&#x27;s Nightmare&quot; (Depth of Field 1997). 

In the 1990s, he performed with the Seattle-based 100% improvisational musical collective Ponga with Wayne Horvitz, Skerik, and Dave Palmer. Previte has collaborated with Jamie Saft as &quot;Swami Late Plate&quot;. Previte appeared in the movie &quot;Short Cuts&quot;, directed by Robert Altman.

In 1997, he founded the record company and label Depth of Field.

<text>Interface is a 1994 novel by Neal Stephenson and J. Frederick George (a pseudonym of George Jewsbury) and originally published under the joint pseudonym Stephen Bury. Reprints of the novel have credited the work to Stephenson and George. It is a thriller, set in the then-future year of 1996 when a shadowy coalition bent on controlling the world economy attempts to manipulate a candidate for president of the United States through the use of a computer biochip brain implant. It was described by writer Cory Doctorow in 2007 as an &quot;underappreciated masterpiece&quot;.

==Story==
Illinois governor William Cozzano suffers a stroke. Meanwhile, in a separate subplot, African-American Eleanor Richmond, unemployed and living in a trailer park, discovers that her husband has committed suicide in their repossessed former home. An underground business coalition called the Network arranges for Cozzano to have a biochip implanted and for him to run for President of the United States. The Network is made up of a number of large fictional companies, with parallels in real business entities.

Richmond, after verbally humiliating a local racist cable TV Public-access television talk show personality who was running for Senate, has since found herself working in the offices of a Republican Colorado senator. After an event where she accused the citizens of Colorado of being welfare queens, she finds herself in the public eye as a candidate for Cozzano&#x27;s running mate.
The Network&#x27;s ability to perceive public opinion, skewed on the night of the vice presidential debate by a twist of fate, makes them select Richmond as vice presidential candidate. Their canny act of public relations work enables Cozzano to save his Presidential campaign. President-elect Cozzano is shot at his inauguration by a psychotic former factory worker who has learned of almost the entirety of the Network&#x27;s plans. He dies almost instantly. Richmond becomes the first black and the first female President of the United States.

==Characters==
* Eleanor Richmond, unemployed, protagonist
* William Cozzano, governor of Illinois
* Mary Catherine Cozzano, his daughter and a neurologist
* Cy Ogle, campaign manager
* Dr. Radhakrishnan, neurosurgeon

<text>Manderlay is a 2005 avant-garde drama film written and directed by Lars von Trier, the second and most recent part of von Trier&#x27;s projected &quot;USA – Land of Opportunities&quot; trilogy. Unlike von Trier&#x27;s other trilogies, the films&#x27; stories are connected and it is a direct sequel to Dogville. It stars Bryce Dallas Howard, who replaces Nicole Kidman in the role of Grace Mulligan. The film co-stars Willem Dafoe, replacing James Caan. Lauren Bacall, Željko Ivanek, Jeremy Davies, and Chloë Sevigny return portraying different characters from those in &quot;Dogville&quot;.
Only John Hurt, Udo Kier, and Jean-Marc Barr reprise their roles. The film was internationally co-produced with seven different European countries.

The staging is very similar to &quot;Dogville&quot;, which was shot on a sparsely dressed sound stage akin to black box theater. As in the case of &quot;Dogville&quot;, &quot;Manderlay&quot;″s action is confined to a small geographic area, in this case a plantation. The film is dedicated in memory of a French film producer, Humbert Balsan (1954-2005).

==Plot==
The film is told in eight straight chapters:

Set in 1933, the film takes up the story of Grace and her father after burning the town of Dogville at the end of the previous film. Grace and her father travel in convoy with a number of gunmen through rural Alabama where they stop briefly outside a plantation called Manderlay. As the gangsters converse, a black woman emerges from Manderlay&#x27;s front gates complaining that someone is about to be whipped for stealing a bottle of wine.

Grace enters the plantation and learns that within it, slavery persists, roughly 70 years after the American Civil War and the Emancipation Proclamation. Grace is appalled and insists on staying at the plantation with a small contingent of gunmen and her father&#x27;s lawyer, Joseph, in order to guarantee the slaves&#x27; safe transition to freedom. Shortly after Grace&#x27;s father and the remaining gangsters depart, Mam, the master of the house, dies, but not before asking Grace to burn a notebook containing &quot;Mam&#x27;s Law,&quot; an exhaustive code of conduct for the entire plantation and all its inhabitants, free and slave. She reads the descriptions of each variety of slave that can be encountered, which include:
* Group 1: Proudy Nigger
* Group 2: Talkin&#x27; Nigger
* Group 3: Weepin&#x27; Nigger
* Group 4: Hittin&#x27; Nigger
* Group 5: Clownin&#x27; Nigger
* Group 6: Losin&#x27; Nigger
* Group 7: Pleasin&#x27; Nigger (also known as a chameleon, a person of the kind who can transform himself into exactly the type the beholder would like to see)

The principal seven divisions are each populated by a single adult slave at Manderlay, who congregate daily and converse on a &quot;parade ground,&quot; with Roman numerals of the numbers 1 through 7 designating where each slave stands. &quot;Mam&#x27;s Law&quot; contains further provisions against the use of cash by slaves, or the felling of trees on the property for timber.

All of this information disgusts Grace and inspires her to take charge of the plantation in order to punish the slave owners and prepare the slaves for life as free individuals. In order to guarantee that the former slaves will not continue to be exploited, no longer as slaves but instead as sharecroppers, Grace orders Joseph to draw up contracts for all Manderlay&#x27;s inhabitants, institutionalizing a form of cooperative living in which the white family works as slaves and the blacks collectively own the plantation and its crops. Throughout this process, Grace lectures all those present about the notions of freedom and democracy, using rhetoric entirely in keeping with the ideology of racial equality which most contemporary Americans had yet to embrace.

However, as the film progresses, Grace fails to embed these principles in Manderlay&#x27;s community in a form she considers satisfactory. Furthermore, her suggestions for improving the conditions of the community backfire on several occasions, such as using the surrounding trees for timber, which leaves the crops vulnerable to dust storms. After a year of such tribulations, the community harvests its cotton and successfully sells it, marking the high point of Grace&#x27;s involvement. Subsequently, she un-enthusiastically has sex with one of the ex-slaves who also steals and gambles away all of the cotton profits. Finally admitting her failure, Grace contacts her father and attempts to leave the plantation only to be stopped by the plantation&#x27;s blacks. At this point it is revealed that &quot;Mam&#x27;s Law&quot; was not conceived and enforced by Mam or any of the other whites, but instead by Wilhelm, the community&#x27;s eldest member, as a means of maintaining the status quo after the abolition of slavery, protecting the blacks from a hostile outside world. The people of Manderlay then tell Grace to punish Timothy for what he did by whipping him. Grace then finds a letter from her father, explaining that he came to get her while she was whipping Timothy. He assumed that this was what she meant by claiming that Manderlay had come upon new times and that she had accepted them as slaves. Grace then runs away to another unrevealed place. As in many von Trier films, the idealistic main character becomes frustrated by the reality he or she encounters.

==Cast==
==Production==

Nicole Kidman and James Caan, who had appeared in earlier chapter of the trilogy, did not return for this film; Kidman was unable to return due to scheduling conflicts, while Caan disapproved of the film&#x27;s depiction of anti-American culture and slavery.

Fearful about her sex scene, Bryce Dallas Howard said she approached it in a hypnotic state. After the first take, she excused herself and went to the bathroom to collect her thoughts, then started to think of it as a sort of comedic scene. &quot;Just in my head. And interestingly enough, Lars kind of felt that. The scene wasn&#x27;t written funny at all, but there are some really eccentric and absurd moments in that scene that people tend to chuckle at.&quot;

=== Donkey killing ===
During production, a donkey was slaughtered for dramatic purposes resulting in John C. Reilly, the actor originally cast as Dr. Hector, quitting in protest. The scene was cut from the film before it was released.

==Reception==

===Critical reception===
&quot;Manderlay&quot; received mixed reviews from critics. , the film holds a 50% approval rating on review aggregation site Rotten Tomatoes, based on 103 reviews with an average rating of 5.70/10. The website&#x27;s critics consensus reads: &quot;&quot;Manderlay&quot; may work better as a political statement than as a film, making its points at the expense of telling a compelling story.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 46 out of 100, based on 29 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;.

Anthony Lane of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; said, &quot;Von Trier is not so much a filmmaker as a misanthropic mesmerist, who uses movies to bend the viewer to his humorless will,&quot; while Josh Kun of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; added, &quot;Trier gets lost in his own rhetoric.&quot;

Conversely, &quot;The Guardian&quot; film critic Peter Bradshaw and Roger Ebert both gave the film mildly positive reviews. While noting, &quot;Many moviegoers are likely to like the film less than the discussion it drags them into,&quot; Ebert opined, &quot;The crucial difference between &quot;Manderlay&quot; and the almost unbearable &quot;Dogville&quot; is not that [von Trier&#x27;s] politics have changed, but that his sense of mercy for the audience has been awakened.&quot; Peter Bradshaw claimed that &quot;Manderlay&quot; &quot;is a wind-up, but an effective wind-up,&quot; and wrote of von Trier&#x27;s Land of Opportunities trilogy, &quot;My guess is you can throw away the first and third movies and keep this one.&quot;

===Box office===
The film took a total of $674,918 from 12 countries.

===Accolades===
&quot;Manderlay&quot; was entered into the 2005 Cannes Film Festival.

<text>The Chilkat River is a river in British Columbia and southeastern Alaska that flows southward from the Coast Range to the Chilkat Inlet and ultimately Lynn Canal. It is long. It begins at Chilkat Glacier, in Alaska, flows west and south in British Columbia for , enters Alaska and continues southwest for another . It reaches the ocean at the abandoned area of Wells, Alaska and deposits into a long delta area.

The river was named by the Russians for the Chilkat group of Tlingit, called /t͡ʃiɬqut/ in their own language, who lived in the region. The name means &quot;salmon storehouse&quot;.

Near the Chilkat River is the Alaska Chilkat Bald Eagle Preserve, where thousands of bald eagles appear between October and February, to take advantage of late salmon runs. Nearby Haines, the nearest town, is the most common organization spot for birdwatchers.

==Threats==

The Chilkat was listed as one of America&#x27;s Most Endangered Rivers in 2019 and again in 2023 due to threats from the Palmer Project, a proposed underground copper and zinc mine sited upstream from the Tlingit village of Klukwan. If built, the project is feared to result in pollution from acidic wastewater laced with heavy metals and hydrocarbons.

<doc id="935448" wikidata="Q380267" url="?curid=935448" title="Valeri Kharlamov">
<text>Valeri Borisovich Kharlamov (, ; 14 January 1948 – 27 August 1981) was a Russian ice hockey forward who played for CSKA Moscow in the Soviet League from 1967 until his death in 1981. Although small in stature, Kharlamov was a speedy, intelligent, skilled and dominant player, being named the Soviet Championship League most valuable player in 1972 and 1973. An offensive player who was considered very creative on the ice, he also led the league in scoring in 1972. He was also a gifted skater who was able to make plays at top speed. Kharlamov was considered one of the best players of his era, as well as one of the greatest players of all time.

In international play, Kharlamov represented the Soviet Union at 11 World Championships, winning 8 gold medals, 2 silvers and 1 bronze. He participated in three Winter Olympics, 1972, 1976 and 1980, finishing with two gold medals and one silver, and participated in the 1972 Summit Series against Team Canada. He spent most of his career playing on a line with Vladimir Petrov and Boris Mikhailov, and this trio is considered one of the best in the history of ice hockey.

Kharlamov was killed in a car accident in 1981. After his death, Kharlamov was elected to the International Ice Hockey Federation Hall of Fame, the Hockey Hall of Fame, the Russian Hockey Hall of Fame and was selected as one of the forwards on the IIHF Centennial All-Star Team. The Kharlamov Trophy is presented annually to the best Russian hockey player in the National Hockey League, as chosen by his peers. The Kharlamov Cup is presented to the champion of the Minor Hockey League playoffs, and the Kontinental Hockey League named one of their four divisions after him.

==Early life==
Kharlamov was born in Moscow to Boris and Begoñita Kharlamov. Boris was a mechanic at a factory, Kommunar, while Begoñita worked with Aeroflot. Begoñita, who was born Carmen Orive Abad, was Basque and originally from Bilbao, Spain, but moved to the Soviet Union in 1937 as a child refugee from the Spanish Civil War (see Niños de Rusia). Kharlamov&#x27;s parents were factory workers from Moscow. He was named after Valery Chkalov, a pioneering Soviet pilot. He also had a younger sister, Tatiana. In 1956, when he was eight-years-old, Kharlamov moved to Spain with his mother, though they both returned to the Soviet Union after several months. Due to his mother&#x27;s heritage, Kharlamov would be nicknamed &quot;The Spaniard&quot; throughout his career.

At age five, Kharlamov first started to skate, fastening his father&#x27;s blades onto his own shoes. He was trained by Boris, who had played hockey himself. However, Kharlamov, who enjoyed playing football as well, was quite sickly as a youth; in 1961, he was diagnosed with rheumatic fever and doctors ordered him to cease any physical activity, and spent several months in hospital, though he ultimately recovered with no apparent cause nor lingering effects.

==Playing career==
===Soviet League===
Kharlamov successfully tried-out for CSKA Moscow when he was 12, and joined their sports school. He joined the senior team for the 1967–68 season, and made his debut with CSKA on 22 October 1967 against HC Sibir. However, Anatoly Tarasov, the coach of the team, felt Kharlamov was not good enough for the team, so after 15 matches with CSKA he sent Kharlamov to join Zvezda Chebarkul, who played in the third division. He would lead the team in scoring with 34 goals in 32 games.

The following season Kharlamov was brought back to CSKA full-time. In 42 games he scored 37 goals and had 12 assists and finished third in the league in scoring with 49 points; it was during a match in October 1968 that he was first put on a line with Vladimir Petrov and Boris Mikhailov; the three of them would play together for the next years both with CSKA and internationally, forming one of the most famous lines in hockey history. In the off-season he and his linemates Petrov and Mikhailov were awarded the title of Merited Master of Sport in recognition of winning an international tournament (which would become the Izvestia Cup). Kharlamov scored a further 33 goals in 1969–70, and had placed fifth overall in points with 43, as CSKA won the league championship once again. He led the league in scoring for the first time in 1970–71, with 40 goals, and finished second overall in scoring with 52, and CSKA repeated as champions.

Although Kharlamov never played in North America, he was drafted by the Calgary Broncos of the World Hockey Association, along with Soviet teammates Petrov and Alexander Maltsev in early 1972.

==International play==

===World Championships===

Kharlamov&#x27;s career in Soviet hockey was well established by the time he came to greater attention through his play in international hockey. His first tournament for the Soviet Union was the 1969 World Championship, where he helped the team capture the gold medal. Kharlamov was a fixture on the Soviet national team roster for the next decade. He played in eleven World Championships in total, capturing 8 gold medals, 2 silvers and 1 bronze. He was named to the tournament All-Star team four times (1971, 1972, 1973 and 1976). He played a total of 105 games in the World Championships, scoring 74 goals and adding 82 assists (156 points).

===Summit Series===
As World Championships were commonly played in Europe, and National Hockey League (NHL) players were not allowed to participate in the Olympics either, Kharlamov and his teammates were still a somewhat unknown quantity when the 1972 Summit Series was played. The eight game series, with four games played in Canada, and four in the Soviet Union was one of the first opportunities for the two countries to put their best hockey players against each other. Most pundits thought Canada would win convincingly.

In the first game of the series, the Soviet Union stunned Canada with a 7–3 victory. Kharlamov scored two goals on Ken Dryden during the second period, and was named the game&#x27;s Most Valuable Player. Fresh observers of Kharlamov&#x27;s play were universally impressed. Summit Series defenceman Serge Savard ranked him as one of the top five players of all time. Team Canada head coach Harry Sinden would later say of Kharlamov, &quot;He had the skill and the ability of any player in the NHL at the time.&quot;

In the sixth game of the series, Bobby Clarke slashed Kharlamov, fracturing a bone in his ankle. He would miss the seventh game of the series, and returned to the lineup for the final game, but at much reduced effectiveness. At the time, many felt the slash was intentional. Assistant coach John Ferguson would later say &quot;I called (Bobby) Clarke over to the bench, looked over at Kharlamov and said, &#x27;I think he needs a tap on the ankle&#x27;.&quot; As for Kharlamov himself, he had little doubt that an attempt had been made to limit his effectiveness, &quot;I&#x27;m convinced that Bobby Clarke was given the job of taking me out of the game.&quot; Kharlamov&#x27;s injury, and his diminished play in the aftermath have been regarded as a turning point for the series in Canada&#x27;s favour, who won the series in the eighth and final game.

Two years later Kharlamov was in the Soviet lineup again during the 1974 Summit Series, playing against the best Canadian players from the World Hockey Association. The Soviets were victorious in this series, with four wins, one loss and three ties. Kharlamov scored two goals and added six assists in the series.

===Olympics===
Kharlamov helped the Soviet national ice hockey team to win gold medals at the 1972 and 1976 Winter Olympics. In five games during the 1972 tournament, Kharlamov scored nine goals and added seven assists. He won his second gold medal with the Soviet Union in 1976, contributing three goals and six assists. Kharlamov was also part of the silver medal-winning Soviet team at the 1980 Winter Olympics, which was his last international tournament. Overall, Kharlamov won two gold medals and one silver at the Olympics, scoring 36 points in 22 career games.

Kharlamov never played in a Canada Cup tournament. He missed the 1976 Canada Cup due to the injuries he sustained in his first major car accident, and was left off the roster for the 1981 Canada Cup just prior to his fatal car accident, as Tikhonov felt he was too old and not in good enough shape for the team. According to his mother-in-law, Kharlamov had been planning to announce his retirement after playing in the 1981 tournament.

==Death==

Kharlamov was still active with CSKA when he was killed in a car accident on 27 August 1981. Prior to the accident, Kharlamov had been informed that he would not be a member of the Soviet team playing in the 1981 Canada Cup. Coach Viktor Tikhonov said that Kharlamov was left off the team over concerns about his conditioning. Irina, Kharlamov&#x27;s wife, was driving back to Moscow from the family&#x27;s cottage when she lost control and crossed into opposing traffic, hitting a truck head-on. Irina did not have a driver&#x27;s license at the time of the crash. When the bodies were recovered, Kharlamov was reaching over from his seat, holding onto the steering wheel. Irina&#x27;s cousin was also killed. Fans lined the streets during his funeral procession in Moscow, and they filed past his casket which rested at centre ice of CSKA&#x27;s arena. Near the scene of the crash, a memorial stone in the shape of a hockey puck is inscribed, &quot;The star of Russian hockey fell here.&quot;

==Legacy==
After his death, Kharlamov&#x27;s teammates with CSKA decided that no one at any level of the organization would wear Kharlamov&#x27;s #17 sweater, until his son Alexander was old enough to wear it. Alexander wore #17 until he was a teenager, but later switched to #22, feeling that the expectations that went along with his father&#x27;s sweater number were too great. When he found himself playing for Tikhonov with the CSKA in 1992, the decision was taken away from him, and he was issued the #17 sweater. After initially being reluctant, Alexander said &quot;Now I am used to it. I felt an additional burden on my shoulders. But now I don&#x27;t feel anything like that.&quot; The #17 is not worn by any member of the Russian national team at senior international competitions. Ilya Kovalchuk usually wears #17 in honor of Kharlamov in club competitions, his father&#x27;s favorite player.

In his memory, &quot;Sovetsky Sport&quot; newspaper established the Kharlamov Trophy in 2002; it is awarded annually to the best Russian player in the National Hockey League, as selected by the Russian players in the league. The annual winner of the playoffs in Russia&#x27;s Junior Hockey League is awarded the Kharlamov Cup. The trophy features a figure modeled after Kharlamov at the top. One of the divisions in the Eastern Conference of the Kontinental Hockey League is named in his honor as well. In 2013, director Nikolay Lebedev released the biopic &quot;Legend No. 17&quot;, with Danila Kozlovsky portraying Kharlamov for most of the film. &quot;Legend No 17&quot; was nominated for 11 Golden Eagle Awards in 2013, and captured six of them, including Best Screenplay. The movie has been described as a personal favorite of Vladimir Putin.

Kharlamov was posthumously inducted into the International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF) Hall of Fame in 1998. The Milestone Award is given by the IIHF Hall of Fame to teams that have made significant contributions to international hockey. In 2012, Kharlamov&#x27;s 1972 Summit Series Soviet Union team was given this honor. To celebrate the 100th anniversary of the IIHF in 2008, a panel of experts named Kharlamov to the Centennial All-Star Team, along with three other Soviet stars, Vladislav Tretiak, Viacheslav Fetisov and Sergei Makarov. Kharlamov was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 2005. His induction was met with praise from one of the players who idolized him, Ilya Kovalchuk. Kharlamov was the second Soviet trained player, after Tretiak, to be inducted into the Hall of Fame. Upon hearing the news of his father&#x27;s induction, Alexander Kharlamov said &quot;I want to say thank you for remembering my father.&quot; In 2014, Kharlamov was part of the inaugural class inducted into the Russian Hockey Hall of Fame.

==Playing style==
Small in stature (he was measured as and during the Summit Series), Kharlamov was a gifted offensive player. During his prime, he was one of the dominant players in Soviet hockey, and he maintained this reputation during international tournaments. Kharlamov loved the creative opportunities his sport provided saying &quot;I like to score beautiful goals.&quot; Some compared Kharlamov&#x27;s play to Wayne Gretzky, in the sense that their overall play was greater than their individual skills, such as skating or shooting would indicate. He was very popular with his fans and teammates.

==Personal life==
Kharlamov and Irina had two children, a son, Alexander, commonly known as &quot;Sasha&quot; and a daughter, Begonita. Valeri married Irina in 1975, after Alexander was born. At that time Kharlamov was unaware he had a son, until he received a phone call from Irina telling him he was the baby&#x27;s father. After their parents&#x27; death, the children went to live with their maternal grandmother in Moscow. Alexander was only five years old when his father died, and does not remember him well, although he has seen recordings of his games. Alexander would also become an ice hockey player, and was selected fifteenth overall by the Washington Capitals in the 1994 NHL Entry Draft, though he never played in the NHL, playing in the North American minor leagues where he made a significant contribution to the Hampton Roads Admirals winning the Kelly Cup, and back in Russia before retiring in 2004. Alexander&#x27;s son is named Valeri, after his grandfather, although his sport of choice is football, rather than hockey. After his death, Kharlamov was buried in the Kuntsevo Cemetery in the Kuntsevo District of Moscow.

<doc id="935451" wikidata="Q6547272" url="?curid=935451" title="Likelihood ratios in diagnostic testing">
<text>In evidence-based medicine, likelihood ratios are used for assessing the value of performing a diagnostic test. They use the sensitivity and specificity of the test to determine whether a test result usefully changes the probability that a condition (such as a disease state) exists. The first description of the use of likelihood ratios for decision rules was made at a symposium on information theory in 1954. In medicine, likelihood ratios were introduced between 1975 and 1980.

==Calculation==

Two versions of the likelihood ratio exist, one for positive and one for negative test results. Respectively, they are known as the &#x27; (LR+, likelihood ratio positive, likelihood ratio for positive results) and &#x27; (LR–, likelihood ratio negative, likelihood ratio for negative results).

The positive likelihood ratio is calculated as

:formula_1

which is equivalent to

:formula_2

or &quot;the probability of a person who has the disease testing positive divided by the probability of a person who does not have the disease testing positive.&quot;
Here &quot;&quot;T&quot;+&quot; or &quot;&quot;T&quot;−&quot; denote that the result of the test is positive or negative, respectively. Likewise, &quot;&quot;D&quot;+&quot; or &quot;&quot;D&quot;−&quot; denote that the disease is present or absent, respectively. So &quot;true positives&quot; are those that test positive (&quot;T&quot;+) and have the disease (&quot;D&quot;+), and &quot;false positives&quot; are those that test positive (&quot;T&quot;+) but do not have the disease (&quot;D&quot;−).

The negative likelihood ratio is calculated as

:formula_3

which is equivalent to

:formula_4

or &quot;the probability of a person who has the disease testing negative divided by the probability of a person who does not have the disease testing negative.&quot;

The calculation of likelihood ratios for tests with continuous values or more than two outcomes is similar to the calculation for dichotomous outcomes; a separate likelihood ratio is simply calculated for every level of test result and is called interval or stratum specific likelihood ratios.

The pretest odds of a particular diagnosis, multiplied by the likelihood ratio, determines the post-test odds. This calculation is based on Bayes&#x27; theorem. (Note that odds can be calculated from, and then converted to, probability.)

==Application to medicine==
Pretest probability refers to the chance that an individual in a given population has a disorder or condition; this is the baseline probability prior to the use of a diagnostic test. Post-test probability refers to the probability that a condition is truly present given a positive test result. For a good test in a population, the post-test probability will be meaningfully higher or lower than the pretest probability. A high likelihood ratio indicates a good test for a population, and a likelihood ratio close to one indicates that a test may not be appropriate for a population.

For a screening test, the population of interest might be the general population of an area. For diagnostic testing, the ordering clinician will have observed some symptom or other factor that raises the pretest probability relative to the general population. A likelihood ratio of greater than 1 for a test in a population indicates that a positive test result is evidence that a condition is present. If the likelihood ratio for a test in a population is not clearly better than one, the test will not provide good evidence: the post-test probability will not be meaningfully different from the pretest probability. Knowing or estimating the likelihood ratio for a test in a population allows a clinician to better interpret the result.

Research suggests that physicians rarely make these calculations in practice, however, and when they do, they often make errors. A randomized controlled trial compared how well physicians interpreted diagnostic tests that were presented as either sensitivity and specificity, a likelihood ratio, or an inexact graphic of the likelihood ratio, found no difference between the three modes in interpretation of test results.

== Estimation table ==
This table provide examples of how changes in the likelihood ratio affects post-test probability of disease.

*These estimates are accurate to within 10% of the calculated answer for all pre-test probabilities between 10% and 90%. The average error is only 4%. For polar extremes of pre-test probability &gt;90% and &lt;10%, see section below.

=== Estimation example ===
# Pre-test probability: For example, if about 2 out of every 5 patients with abdominal distension have ascites, then the pretest probability is 40%.
# Likelihood Ratio: An example &quot;test&quot; is that the physical exam finding of bulging flanks has a positive likelihood ratio of 2.0 for ascites.
# Estimated change in probability: Based on table above, a likelihood ratio of 2.0 corresponds to an approximately +15% increase in probability. 
# Final (post-test) probability: Therefore, bulging flanks increases the probability of ascites from 40% to about 55% (i.e., 40% + 15% = 55%, which is within 2% of the exact probability of 57%).

==Calculation example==

A medical example is the likelihood that a given test result would be expected in a patient with a certain disorder compared to the likelihood that same result would occur in a patient without the target disorder.

Some sources distinguish between LR+ and LR−. A worked example is shown below.
Confidence intervals for all the predictive parameters involved can be calculated, giving the range of values within which the true value lies at a given confidence level (e.g. 95%).

==Estimation of pre- and post-test probability==

The likelihood ratio of a test provides a way to estimate the pre- and post-test probabilities of having a condition.

With &quot;pre-test probability&quot; and &quot;likelihood ratio&quot; given, then, the &quot;post-test probabilities&quot; can be calculated by the following three steps:

: formula_5
: formula_6
In equation above, &quot;positive post-test probability&quot; is calculated using the &quot;likelihood ratio positive&quot;, and the &quot;negative post-test probability&quot; is calculated using the &quot;likelihood ratio negative&quot;.

Odds are converted to probabilities as follows:

:formula_7 

multiply equation (1) by (1 − probability)

:formula_8

add (probability × odds) to equation (2)

:formula_9

divide equation (3) by (1 + odds)

:formula_10

hence

* Posttest probability = Posttest odds / (Posttest odds + 1)

Alternatively, post-test probability can be calculated directly from the pre-test probability and the likelihood ratio using the equation: 
*P&#x27; = P0 × LR/(1 − P0 + P0×LR), where P0 is the pre-test probability, P&#x27; is the post-test probability, and LR is the likelihood ratio. This formula can be calculated algebraically by combining the steps in the preceding description.

In fact, &quot;post-test probability&quot;, as estimated from the &quot;likelihood ratio&quot; and &quot;pre-test probability&quot;, is generally more accurate than if estimated from the &quot;positive predictive value&quot; of the test, if the tested individual has a different &quot;pre-test probability&quot; than what is the &quot;prevalence&quot; of that condition in the population.

===Example===
Taking the medical example from above (20 true positives, 10 false negatives, and 2030 total patients), the &quot;positive pre-test probability&quot; is calculated as:

*Pretest probability = (20 + 10) / 2030 = 0.0148
*Pretest odds = 0.0148 / (1 − 0.0148) = 0.015
*Posttest odds = 0.015 × 7.4 = 0.111
*Posttest probability = 0.111 / (0.111 + 1) = 0.1 or 10%

As demonstrated, the &quot;positive post-test probability&quot; is numerically equal to the &quot;positive predictive value&quot;; the &quot;negative post-test probability&quot; is numerically equal to (1 − &quot;negative predictive value&quot;).

<text>Stephens Passage is a channel in the Alexander Archipelago in the southeastern region of the U.S. state of Alaska. It runs between Admiralty Island to the west and the Alaska mainland and Douglas Island to the east, and is about 170 km (105 mi) long. Juneau, the capital of Alaska, is near the north end, on Gastineau Channel.

Stephens Passage was named in 1794 by George Vancouver, probably for Sir Philip Stephens. It was first charted the same year by Joseph Whidbey, master of HMS &quot;Discovery&quot; during Vancouver&#x27;s 1791-95 expedition. In 1920, a more detailed survey of the passage followed, by the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey ship USC&amp;GS &quot;Explorer&quot; and two smaller vessels.

<text>David Higginbottom (14 October 1923 – 10 May 2016) was a British author who published under the pen name Nicholas Fisk. He was a writer of science fiction books, mainly for children. His works include &quot;Grinny&quot;, &quot;You Remember Me&quot;, &quot;Space Hostages&quot;, and &quot;Trillions&quot;. He also wrote the &quot;Starstormers&quot; series of novels.

Fisk died in May 2016 at the age of 92.

== Early life ==
Fisk was born in London. His father, William, author of &quot;Frightfulness in Modern Art&quot; (1928), was an artist and art teacher. His mother was the sister of the Irish actor Micheál Mac Liammóir. He was educated at Ardingly College, West Sussex.

== Books ==

=== &quot;Space Hostages&quot; ===
A group of children are kidnapped by a critically ill Flight Lieutenant aboard a top secret spacecraft. Left to command the ship alone, they struggle to return safely home. The book explores the dynamics of the global cold war and interpersonal relationships between the children. Published in 1967.

=== &quot;Trillions&quot; ===
A mysterious shower of tiny crystals fall all over Earth. No-one knows where they came from, or what their purpose is, but they certainly behave strangely. Bonding together they mimic strange, and sometimes threatening, shapes. A boy with a microscope is just as likely to find out the answers as all the scientific pundits. Published 1971.

=== &quot;Grinny&quot; ===
&quot;Grinny&quot; deals with a normal family in middle England whose lives change when they are visited by aliens. The alien takes the form of an apparently benign elderly relative who can play mind tricks on the adults in the family but decides not to use this method on the children (although the sequel You Remember Me has the second alias used by these aliens, &#x27;Lisa Treadgold&#x27; announcing that this decision was for the purposes of studying human children in what her race deemed to be a natural unaltered state. They do not bother with this process in their second attempt). This Granny-esque figure is eventually caught out by the children&#x27;s ingenuity (they realise she is no normal human being when she expects what they describe to her as a &quot;cast-iron conker&quot; to be made of cast iron). Published 1973. Animated as an episode of &quot;CBS Storybreak&quot;, and briefly serialised on an episode of &quot;The Book Tower&quot;.

=== &quot;You Remember Me&quot; ===
In &quot;You Remember Me&quot;, the same breed of aliens from the previous book, &quot;Grinny&quot;, return to Earth and make another attempt to take over the planet, this time by inhabiting an attractive television presenter who can apply her mind tricks to many thousands as she presents her TV shows. Once again, she is thwarted by the children. Published 1984.

=== &quot;Wheelie In The Stars&quot; ===
Drone workers on a grim industrial settlement on a distant planet dream of assembling a smuggled motorbike, and taking to the open spaces. But petrol and combustion engines are banned and their attempts are sure to land them in trouble with the all-seeing authorities. Published 1976.

=== &quot;Time Trap&quot; ===
A teenager in the late 21st century discovers he can time-travel using a drug supplied by his &quot;Uncle&quot; Lipton, a man who has already lived over 130 years and likely to live at least 100 more. Together they escape the horrors of their mindless present to experience life in the past. But time travel has its own dangers, and Uncle Lipton isn&#x27;t totally honest about his motivations. Published 1976.

This book was adapted into a film released in Denmark.

===&quot;Monster Maker&quot;===
This book was adapted into a 45-minute television special of the same name, directed by Giles Foster and starring Harry Dean Stanton.

=== Starstormers Series ===
Published between 1980 and 1983 by Hodder, &quot;Starstormers&quot; consisted of five books; &quot;Starstormers&quot;, &quot;Sunburst&quot;, &quot;Catfang&quot;, &quot;Evil Eye&quot; and &quot;Volcano&quot;. Fed up of being left in a boarding school on Earth while their parents colonize a new planet, a group of children decide to build their own spaceship out of obsolete equipment in order to join their parents, but in order to get there they will first have to deal with the mysterious Octopus Emperor.

<text>Paul Brophy (April 27, 1937 – October 23, 1986) was a firefighter in Massachusetts who entered a persistent vegetative state with no believed chance of recovery. Opposing viewpoints between his family and his doctors on how to deal with his condition sparked an early legal case on the right to die.

On March 22, 1983, Paul Brophy sustained a basilar artery aneurysm rupture with very destructive neurologic consequences. Following the rupture he entered a persistent vegetative state with no chance of recovery. As he was unable to chew or swallow, a gastric feeding tube was eventually inserted into him to allow for nutrition and hydration.

Later, when it became obvious that there was no hope for even a modest degree of higher brain function recovery, his family requested that his gastrostomy feedings be terminated, a request based on the fact that Brophy had verbally indicated that he would not want to exist in such a degraded state. However, the hospital, New England Sinai Hospital, denied the request, leading to a series of legal actions.

While the first court to hear the case agreed that Brophy would have wanted the gastrostomy tube removed, it refused to authorize its removal, principally because he was not terminally ill. However, when the case went on further to the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts, transfer of Brophy to another hospital facility that was agreeable to removal of the gastrostomy tube was authorized.

Brophy died a number of days later, making him the first American to die after court-authorized discontinuation of artificially supplied nutrition and hydration to a person in a persistent vegetative state.

== Ethical concerns over death by dehydration==
Judge Lynch of the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court argued that death by dehydration symptoms was &quot;cruel and violent&quot; in his opinion on this case because such a death involved:

* The mouth would dry out and become caked or coated with thick material. 
* The lips would become parched and cracked. 
* The tongue would swell, and might crack. 
* The eyes would recede back into their orbits and the cheeks would become hollow. 
* The lining of the nose might crack and cause the nose to bleed. 
* The skin would hang loose on the body and become dry and scaly. 
* The urine would become highly concentrated, leading to burning of the bladder. 
* The lining of the stomach would dry out and the sufferer would experience dry heaves and vomiting. 
* The body temperature would become very high. 
* The brain cells would dry out, causing convulsions. 
* The respiratory tract would dry out, and the thick secretions that would result could plug the lungs and cause death. 
* At some point within five days to three weeks, the major organs, including the lungs, heart, and brain, would give out and the patient would die.

<doc id="935478" wikidata="Q384696" url="?curid=935478" title="Eng (letter)">
<text>Eng, agma, or engma (capital: Ŋ, lowercase: ŋ) is a letter of the Latin alphabet, used to represent a voiced velar nasal (as in English &quot;sii&quot;) in the written form of some languages and in the International Phonetic Alphabet.

In Washo, lower-case represents a typical sound, while upper-case represents a voiceless sound. This convention comes from Americanist phonetic notation.

==History==
The &quot;First Grammatical Treatise&quot;, a 12th-century work on the phonology of the Old Icelandic language, uses a single grapheme for the eng sound, shaped like a g with a stroke .
Alexander Gill the Elder uses an uppercase G with a hooked tail and a lowercase n with the hooked tail of a script g for the same sound in &quot;Logonomia Anglica&quot; in 1619. William Holder uses the letter in &quot;Elements of Speech: An Essay of Inquiry into the Natural Production of Letters&quot;, published in 1669, but it was not printed as intended; he indicates in his errata that “there was intended a character for Ng, viz., n with a tail like that of g, which must be understood where the Printer has imitated it by n or y”.
It was later used in Benjamin Franklin&#x27;s phonetic alphabet, with its current phonetic value. It was supposed to be in English but failed.

==Appearance==
Lowercase eng is derived from n, with the addition of a hook to the right leg, somewhat like that of j. Nowadays, the uppercase has two main variants: it can be based on the usual uppercase N, with a hook added (or &quot;N-form&quot;); or it can be an enlarged version of the lowercase (or &quot;n-form&quot;). The former is preferred in Sami languages that use it, the latter in African languages, such as in Shona from 1931 to 1955, and several in west and central Africa currently. In Isaac Pitman’s Phonotypic Alphabet, the uppercase had a reversed-N form.

Early printers, lacking a specific glyph for eng, sometimes approximated it by rotating a capital G, or by substituting a Greek letter η (&quot;eta&quot;) before modified to present form for it (encoded in Unicode as the Latin letter n with long leg: Ƞ ƞ).

==Pronunciation of words containing eng sound==
In most languages eng is absent in the Latin alphabet but its sound can be present in the letter n in words. In English, it is heard in the potential digraphs nc (hard c), ng (hard g), nk, nq and nx, often at the end of words. For the pronunciation of ng with eng, it can be in words such as &quot;singer&quot; and &quot;hanged&quot; and when it is in final position or in words such as &quot;finger&quot; and &quot;angle&quot;.

In British English, n is pronounced eng in the prefixes en- and in- when they are followed by c, g and q, as in &quot;encroachment&quot;, &quot;engagement&quot;, &quot;enquiry&quot;, &quot;incursion&quot;, &quot;ingredient&quot;, &quot;inquiry&quot; and others. In other English dialects, the n is pronounced instead. In many British dialects, the ng in &quot;strength&quot; and &quot;length&quot; is simply pronounced , with g a silent letter, and the ng is otherwise pronounced in those words.

==Usage==

===Technical transcription===
*Americanist phonetic notation, where it may also represent a uvular nasal.
*Sometimes for the transcription of Australian Aboriginal languages
*International Phonetic Alphabet
*Uralic Phonetic Alphabet including 
*Teuthonista phonetic transcription system uses 
*Rheinische Dokumenta, a phonetic alphabet for many West Central German dialects, Low Rhenish, and few related languages.

==Computer encoding==

Eng is encoded in Unicode as U+014A and U+014B , part of the Latin Extended-A range. In ISO 8859-4 (Latin-4) it&#x27;s located at BD (uppercase) and BF (lowercase).

In African languages such as Bemba, &quot;ng&quot;&#x27; (with an apostrophe) is widely used as a substitute in media where eng is hard to reproduce.

<doc id="935484" wikidata="Q1203852" url="?curid=935484" title="Riyu Kosaka">
<text>is a Japanese pop singer and lyricist. She is best known as a member of the Konami-produced Japanese teen pop girl group BeForU.

== Biography ==

=== Early life ===
Kosaka was born in Yokohama, Kanagawa Prefecture, Japan on January 17, 1985.

=== Career ===

=== Discovery by Konami ===
On November 20, 2000, Konami and Toshiba-EMI staff held auditions to form a J-pop group, which would eventually become BeForU; Riyu, who was then fifteen years old, was one of four who went on to join the group. The group, produced by Naoki Maeda, originally made songs specifically for Bemani games—their first song, &quot;Dive&quot;, was promoted intensely in the time leading up to the release of Dance Dance Revolution 5thMix.

=== &quot;True...&quot; ===
After &quot;Dive&#x27;s&quot; success in 5thMix, BeForU produced more tracks for inclusion in DDRMAX Dance Dance Revolution 6thMix, including &quot;Dive: More Deep and Deeper Style&quot; and &quot;Firefly&quot;. This is where Kosaka got her first solo track, &quot;True...&quot;. Two different versions were included in the game, &quot;True... (radio edit)&quot; and &quot;True...: Trance Sunrise Mix&quot;. For the first time for any member of BeForU, a CD single was released. including a long version of both the radio edit and the trance sunrise mix, as well as a remix of a solo performance of &quot;Dive&quot;, renamed &quot;Dive to the Night&quot;. &quot;True...&quot; was a success in the DDR community, and Kosaka continued to release other songs for use in Bemani both with BeForU and as a solo singer.

=== Breaking out from Bemani ===
While they continued to make music for Konami, BeForU began to put more emphasis on themselves as legitimate musicians, and this included Kosaka. In 2004, the band&#x27;s first CD was released, containing some solo work by Kosaka; in the same year, her first full solo album, &quot;Begin&quot;, was released. &quot;Begin&quot; contained three original songs, as well as eleven re-recorded Bemani songs, some of which were covers of other artists. A year later, she released &quot;Riyu Kosaka First Live at O-EAST 2005&quot;, a CD+DVD set of her first full-blown concert. (This cannot actually be considered her first live performance, as she did limited performances to promote her single &quot;True...&quot;. ) Since that time, Kosaka has released a number of singles both on her own and with BeForU, as well as a new album with BeForU.

In 2005 and 2006, she also collaborated with Ryo Horikawa as a radio personality for Pakedio Channel, and her song &quot;Little Wings&quot; is available on the album &quot;Pakedio Channel Vol. 1&quot;.

In 2007, Riyu Kosaka recorded a song for the film Kamen Rider The Next, &quot;Platinum Smile&quot;. The song is an insert song for the movie with Kosaka providing the singing voice for Erika Mori, who portrays Chiharu Kazami, the younger sister of Shiro Kazami/Kamen Rider V3. In December 2007, Riyu released her sixth single, Kokoro no ato. The song was used as the introduction song in the anime Mokke.

In 2008, Riyu released her second studio album, Every Struggle, which was also her debut album on a major record label. The album contained her four most recent singles at the time and 7 new tracks, for a total of 11 tracks overall. Due to the break-up of BeForU in late 2008, Riyu did not produce any solo works for some time.

In 2010, Riyu announced the release of her song &#x27;キミが聞こえる&#x27; which would be featured on &#x27;あまつみそらに!&#x27; as the ending theme and was also released as part of the soundtrack in June 2010. This release, however, was not on avex trax but on 5pb. which may indicate she has switched labels. Kosaka will also be performing at the &#x27;Live5pb.2010&#x27; concert.

In 2018, she provided vocals on the &quot;Dynamite Dynamite Rev -NAOKI SPECIAL ALBUM-&quot;. In 2019, she provided vocals for the opening song of the mobile game &quot;Seven&#x27;s Code&quot;.

In 2021, the song &quot;12&quot; by Naoki and Riyu Kosaka that was in &quot;Seven&#x27;s Code&quot; reappears on the game StepManiaX.

<text>Futile medical care is the continued provision of medical care or treatment to a patient when there is no reasonable hope of a cure or benefit.

Some proponents of evidence-based medicine suggest discontinuing the use of any treatment that has not been shown to provide a measurable benefit. Futile care discontinuation is distinct from euthanasia because euthanasia involves active intervention to end life, while withholding futile medical care does not encourage or hasten the natural onset of death.

== Definition ==
Many controversies surrounding the concept of futile care center around how futility is assessed differently in specific situations rather than on arguments in favor of providing futile care &quot;per se&quot;. It is difficult to determine when a particular course of action may fall under the definition of futile medical care because it is difficult to define the point at which there is no further benefit to intervention (varying from case to case). For instance, a cancer patient may be willing to undergo more chemotherapy with a very expensive medication for the benefit of a few weeks of life, while medical staff, insurance company staff and close relatives may believe this is a futile course of care.

A 2010 survey of more than 10,000 physicians in the United States found respondents divided on the issue of recommending or giving &quot;life-sustaining therapy when [they] judged that it was futile&quot;, with 23.6% saying they would do so, 37% saying they would not, and 39.4% selecting &quot;It depends&quot;.

== Futile medical care and euthanasia ==
The difficulty with the issue of non-treatment lies in the borderline with euthanasia, which is punishable by law in most countries. Euthanasia designates a practice (action or omission) whose aim is to intentionally bring about the death of a person, in principle suffering from an incurable disease which inflicts intolerable suffering, particularly by a doctor or under his or her control. In France, the situation of Vincent Lambert, for example, has been qualified as unreasonable obstinacy by his doctor and by several court rulings, but has remained a source of legal proceedings and societal debate for several years over whether stopping treatment would be euthanasia or not.

In France, the Code of Medical Ethics rejects the practice of &quot;acharnement thérapeutique&quot;, while advocating palliative care. The aim of palliative care is not to hasten a patient&#x27;s death, but to relieve pain, even if, to do so, caregivers sometimes use doses of analgesics or painkillers that risk bringing the moment of death closer.

Denmark recognizes patients right to refuse treatment.

==Issues in futile care considerations==

The issue of futile care in clinical medicine generally involves two questions. The first concerns the identification of those clinical scenarios where the care would be futile. The second concerns the range of ethical options when care is determined to be futile.

===Assessment of futility in a clinical context===
Clinical scenarios vary in degrees and manners of futility. While scenarios like providing ICU care to the brain-dead patient or the anencephalic patient when organ harvesting is not possible or practical are easily identifiable as futile, many other situations are less clear.

A study in the United Kingdom with more than 180,000 patients aimed to define a timeframe for quantitative futility in emergency laparotomy and investigate predictors of futility using the United Kingdom National Emergency Laparotomy Audit (NELA) database. A two-stage methodology was used; stage one defined a timeframe for futility using an online survey and steering group discussion; stage two applied this definition to patients enrolled in NELA December 2013–December 2020 for analysis. Futility was defined as all-cause mortality within 3 days of emergency laparotomy. Results showed that quantitative futility occurred in 4% of patients (7442/180,987) and median age was 74 years. Significant predictors of futility included age, arterial lactate and cardiorespiratory co-morbidity. Frailty was associated with a 38% increased risk of early mortality and surgery for intestinal ischaemia was associated with a two times greater chance of futile surgery. These findings suggest that quantitative futility after emergency laparotomy is associated with quantifiable risk factors available to decision-makers preoperatively and should be incorporated into shared decision-making discussions with extremely high-risk patients.

Another practical clinical example that often occurs in large hospitals is the decision about whether or not to continue resuscitation when the resuscitation efforts following an in-hospital cardiac arrest have been prolonged. A 1999 study in the &quot;Journal of the American Medical Association&quot; has validated an algorithm developed for these purposes.

As medical care improves and affects more and more chronic conditions, questions of futility have continued to arise. A relatively recent response to this difficulty in the United States is the introduction of the hospice concept, in which palliative care is initiated for someone thought to be within about six months of death. Numerous social and practical barriers exist that complicate the issue of initiating hospice status for someone unlikely to recover.

===Options for futile care and futile care as a commodity ===

Another issue in futile care theory concerns the range of ethical options when care is determined to be futile. Some people argue that futile clinical care should be a market commodity that should be able to be purchased just like cruise vacations or luxury automobiles, as long as the purchaser of the clinical services has the necessary funds and as long as other patients are not being denied access to clinical resources as a result. In this model, Baby K would be able to get ICU care (primarily ventilatory care) until funding vanished. With rising medical care costs and an increase in extremely expensive new anti-cancer medications, the similar issues of equity often arise in treatment of end-stage cancer.

=== Options with regard to futile care ===
If futile care is not desired, a signed and notarized do not resuscitate (DNR) order can prevent these futile actions and treatments from being performed.

If futile care is desired, an advance directive can express wishes to receive any and all care that has a chance of prolonging life.

<doc id="935490" wikidata="Q662889" url="?curid=935490" title="Ice hockey at the 1948 Winter Olympics">
<text>The men&#x27;s [[ice hockey]] tournament at the [[1948 Winter Olympics]] in St. Moritz, Switzerland, was the sixth Olympic Championship, also served as the 15th World Championships and the 26th European Championships. Canada won its fifth Olympic gold medal and 12th World Championship, represented by the Ottawa RCAF Flyers team of Canadian Armed Forces personnel. The highest-finishing European team Czechoslovakia, won the silver medal and its eighth European Championship. Bibi Torriani played for Switzerland which won the bronze medal, and became the first ice hockey player to recite the Olympic Oath on behalf of all athletes.

The hockey tournament was in jeopardy of not being played due to disagreements between the Ligue Internationale de Hockey sur Glace and the International Olympic Committee, and a threatened boycott by the United States Olympic Committee when two American hockey teams showed up to play. Writer Jack Sullivan referred to the 1948 Winter Olympics as &quot;the most controversial, name-calling, complaint-filled, Winter Olympic Games ever held&quot;.

==Changes in world hockey since 1936==
After the 1936 Winter Olympics, the Canadian Amateur Hockey Association (CAHA) revised its definition of amateur when it failed to win the gold medal in hockey, and broke away from the Amateur Athletic Union of Canada despite the possibility that its players may no longer be eligible for Olympic hockey. In August 1937, Eastern Amateur Hockey League president Tommy Lockhart broke away from the Amateur Athletic Union of the United States over disagreements on Canadian-born players in his league, then reached a co-operative agreement directly with the CAHA. He then founded the Amateur Hockey Association of the United States (AHAUS) as a rival governing body of ice hockey.

The CAHA and the AHAUS joined to form the International Ice Hockey Association in 1940. Former CAHA president W. G. Hardy was elected its president, and sought for acceptance by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) on terms acceptable to the CAHA. CAHA president George Dudley subsequently threatened to withdraw Canada from the Olympics over the definition of amateur. An IOC decision on the matter was postponed when the 1940 Winter Olympics and 1944 Winter Olympics were cancelled due to World War II.

In 1946, the Ligue Internationale de Hockey sur Glace (LIHG) held its first congress since 1939. The LIHG expelled Germany and Japan, and memberships of Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia were consolidated into the Soviet Union. Austria was readmitted to the LIHG, and Denmark was welcomed as a new member. Paul Loicq stepped down as after 25 years as LIHG president, and was succeeded by Fritz Kraatz in 1947. The LIHG also agreed to a merger with the International Ice Hockey Association, and recognized AHAUS as the governing body of hockey in the United States instead of the AAU.

==Choice of the Canadian team==
Canada did not participate in the 1947 Ice Hockey World Championships and the CAHA had decided not to participate in the 1948 Winter Olympics in disagreement with the definition of amateur by the IOC. CAHA president Al Pickard felt Canada was obliged to send a Canada men&#x27;s national ice hockey team truly representative of the &quot;greatest hockey country&quot; in the world, and honestly take the Olympic Oath as amateurs. He stated that Canada would have been misunderstood, &quot;if we had refused to participate because we did not get our own way&quot;. The Canadian Olympic Association indicated it would accept any team nominated by the CAHA which met amateur eligibility. Pickard announced the Ottawa RCAF Flyers were chosen to represent the country and appeal to patriotic support for the Royal Canadian Air Force, but still continued to press for international recognition of the CAHA&#x27;s definition of amateur. He also confirmed that the CAHA would pay the national team&#x27;s expenses for the Olympics, and provide support to use the best Canadian players available.

==Rival American organizations==

The LIHG met in September 1947 to decide on whether to have an ice hockey tournament at the Winter Olympics, or host a separate Ice Hockey World Championships elsewhere in Switzerland in 1948. Prior to the meeting, Avery Brundage of the United States Olympic Committee (USOC) reportedly campaigned to delegates to vote against inclusion of the AHAUS in the upcoming Olympics. George Dudley and Bunny Ahearne felt that the Swiss Olympic organizing committee would agree to either definition of amateur as long as hockey would be included, since it would be the most profitable event at the Olympics. The LIHG passed a resolution that its teams would only play against teams approved by the CAHA and the AHAUS, which was accepted by the Swiss Olympic organizing committee.

In November 1947, Ahearne reported that the AAU still planned on sending a team to the Olympics. Brundage threatened that the USOC would boycott the Olympics if the AHAUS team was recognized. The LIHG met again in December regarding United States participation in the Olympics. Ahearne suggested organizing Ice Hockey World Championships in Zürich and Basel instead of during the Olympics. He felt the Brundage threat was a bluff and an attempt to sabotage Olympic ice hockey. Ahearne reiterated that LIHG teams would not play against an AAU representative.

The idea of hosting a separate Ice Hockey World Championships surfaced again in January, and Ahearne stated that such a tournament could be arranged on 48 hours&#x27; notice. The Swiss Olympic organizing committee insisted on the AHAUS team being recognized, despite persistent charges by Brundage that the AHAUS team was &quot;tainted with professionalism&quot;. Brundage and the AAU supported a National Collegiate Athletic Association team instead. After bitter negotiations which were not resolved until the night before the Olympics, the AHAUS team was allowed to play in the tournament, but the IOC declared those games would not count in the standings. The winner of the hockey tournament would be recognized as an Olympic champion, except for the United States team.

==Final tournament==
The tournament was run in a round-robin format with nine teams participating. The Canadians had seven wins and one tie against the team from Czechoslovakia. Czechoslovakia also won seven games. The tournament was decided on goal average. Canada outscored their opponents 69:5 (a 13.8 goal average). The Czechoslovakia team outscored their opponents 80:18 (a 4.44 goal average). On the final day the Swiss watched the Czechoslovaks beat the Americans dashing their gold medal aspirations, and then lost their opportunity for silver in a loss to Canada, finishing with a bronze.

Because this tournament was also the LIHG World Championship, the United States earned a fourth-place ranking in the LIHG standings. George Dudley stated that the 1948 Olympic hockey tournament was played in &quot;ridiculous weather conditions&quot; with poor refereeing.

<text>Human is a death metal band from Christchurch, New Zealand.

Human was originally formed on 8 March 1992 by brothers Paul and Scott Harrison (on drums and guitars respectively), and vocalist / guitarist Nathan Ballard. The bassist Vaughn Richardson joined them in May of that year.

Human entered Nga Matuaka Studios in May and recorded a 3 track demo cassette titled &quot;Organ Splatters&quot; which was distributed freely throughout the heavy metal underground / tape swapping networks around at the time. The band later appeared on a September 1992 addition of New Zealand&#x27;s 60 Minutes programme on TV3 as part of a documentary that focused on suicide and depression, and the connection to heavy metal music.

Human has toured and recorded several times since then and continues today.

After Flynn and Green performed &quot;Unchained Melody&quot; on the programme, ITV was inundated by people looking to buy the song, and the pair were persuaded by record producer Simon Cowell to record it and release it as a single, a double A-side with White Cliffs of Dover. The single was released under the name Robson &amp; Jerome and reached number one in the UK chart in 1995. It stayed at No.1 for 7 weeks in the UK Singles Chart, selling more than 1.9 million copies, and making it the best-selling single of the year, and winning the duo the Music Week Awards in 1996 for best single and best album.

<doc id="935493" wikidata="Q4862013" url="?curid=935493" title="Barnum (musical)">
<text>Barnum is an American musical with a book by Mark Bramble, lyrics by Michael Stewart, and music by Cy Coleman. It is based on the life of showman P. T. Barnum, covering the period from 1835 through 1880 in America and major cities of the world where Barnum took his performing companies. The production combines elements of traditional musical theater with the spectacle of the circus. The characters include jugglers, trapeze artists and clowns, as well as such real-life personalities as Jenny Lind and General Tom Thumb.

The original Broadway production ran for 854 performances and was followed by a London production, among others.

==Synopsis==
In the middle of the 19th century, Phineas Taylor (P.T.) Barnum introduces his circus acts as he stands in front of a tent, proclaiming (&quot;There Is a Sucker Born Ev&#x27;ry Minute&quot;). He loves spectacle and excitement, using hype and &quot;humbug&quot; to promote his exhibits. His wife Charity disagrees with his use of &quot;humbug&quot; but loves him and aims to keep him grounded. Barnum then introduces the oldest woman alive, Joice Heth, and thanks to some Barnum humbug she becomes a success (&quot;Thank God I&#x27;m Old&quot;). His wife Charity (&quot;Chairy&quot;) urges him to get a job in a factory, but Barnum refuses (&quot;The Colors of My Life [Part One]&quot;) and Charity wryly admits and accepts the disparity between their views (&quot;The Colors of My Life [Part Two]&quot;). Barnum enlists clowns to help in building a museum to house his attractions (with expected comical results) and it&#x27;s up to Charity to encourage him to keep going (&quot;One Brick at a Time&quot;), with the result that &quot;everything about [his] museum was spectacular&quot; (&quot;Museum Song&quot;); however, the museum burns down accidentally. Barnum finds two new star attractions, Tom Thumb, who appears to advise that &quot;Bigger Isn&#x27;t Better&quot;, and Jumbo the elephant. Barnum then becomes manager of the famous Swedish opera singer Jenny Lind (&quot;Love Makes Such Fools of Us All&quot;). Barnum becomes enamored of her and sees the attraction of going on tour with her (&quot;Out There&quot;). He accompanies Jenny on tour, leaving Charity behind, as a marching band greets them (&quot;Come Follow the Band&quot;). Although all seems to be going well for Barnum, he finds that without Charity in his life he is miserable, and he decides to break ties with Jenny and return home to the woman he loves (&quot;Love Makes Such Fools of Us All [Reprise]&quot;). Upon his return to Charity, he promises to live the more sedate life she desires for him, in &quot;Black and White.&quot; After a failed stint running a clockworks factory and a failed attempt to build his own city, he turns to politics; when his campaign looks doomed to fail due to lack of interest, Charity realizes how important his talents and passion are in his life and allows him to inject color and life into his campaign. He is elected Mayor of Bridgeport, and the two of them recognize the value in each other&#x27;s approach to life and how they complement one another (&quot;The Colors of My Life [Reprise]&quot;). Barnum is prepared to run for Senator, but his beloved Charity dies suddenly, leaving Barnum bereft and alone. When Barnum finds himself cheated of the Senatortial nomination by his political party, he laments his position, realizes that his talent for Humbug will never leave him and wishes to &quot;make it right, shoot a rocket, shine a light&quot; (&quot;Prince of Humbug&quot;). James Anthony Bailey arrives and offers him the chance to &quot;Join the Circus&quot;. Initially resisting, he relents (thanks in part to Charity&#x27;s two-headed coin, which she has used to humbug him throughout the show) and joins Bailey, and they form the famous circus Barnum and Bailey.

In &quot;a princely final attraction&quot;, Barnum appears before the audience (&quot;The Final Event: There is a Sucker Born Ev&#x27;ry Minute&quot; [Reprise]&quot;) and reflects on his past:

==Production history==
===Original Broadway production (1980-82)===
The original production opened at the St. James Theatre on Broadway, on April 30, 1980, and closed on May 16, 1982, after 854 performances and 26 previews. It was directed and choreographed by Joe Layton, with scenic design by David Mitchell, costume design by Theoni V. Aldredge, and lighting design by Craig Miller. The musical starred Jim Dale as P.T. Barnum, Glenn Close as Charity Barnum, Marianne Tatum as Jenny Lind, Terri White as Joice Heth, and Terrence Mann as Chester Lyman (he also understudied Dale as Barnum). During Jim Dale&#x27;s vacation in May 1981, the part of Barnum was played by Tony Orlando, and when Dale left the production in October 1981, Mike Burstyn assumed the role for the remainder of the show&#x27;s run.

===Original London production and UK tours (1981-86)===
The show made its West End debut on June 11, 1981, at the London Palladium, where it ran for 655 performances. The London cast included Michael Crawford as P.T. Barnum, Deborah Grant as Charity Barnum and Sarah Payne as Jenny Lind. Crawford reprised his role opposite Eileen Battye in a UK Tour of the show which ran between 1984 and 1986, stopping off at various venues including the Manchester Opera House and a West End revival at the Victoria Palace Theatre. The tour was recorded for television and broadcast by the BBC in 1986. It was later released on VHS and DVD.

There was a further revival in London at the Dominion Theatre, starring Paul Nicholas and another in a circus tent in Battersea Park (where circuses run by David Smart had previously been held) starring &quot;Blue Peter&quot; presenter Peter Duncan. Another UK tour ran from 1995 to 1996 starring Andrew O&#x27;Connor in the title role.

===Chichester revival (2013) and UK tour (2014-15)===
Two-time Tony Award-nominee Christopher Fitzgerald starred in Cameron Mackintosh&#x27;s new production of the show at the Chichester Festival Theatre from 15 July to 31 August 2013. The show was not performed at the Festival Theatre due to its refurbishment. Instead, it was performed in the Theatre in the Park, which is near the Festival Theatre. It was directed by Timothy Sheader, co-directed and choreographed by Liam Steel and co-choreographed by Andrew Wright, set design by Scott Pask, costume design by Paul Wills, lighting design by Paule Constable, sound design by Mick Potter and circus consultancy by Vicki Amedume. Alongside Christopher Fitzgerald as P. T. Barnum was Tamsin Carroll as Charity Barnum, Anna O&#x27;Byrne as Jenny Lind, Aretha Ayeh as Joice Heth and Jack North as Tom Thumb.

The production was revised by Cameron Mackintosh and Mark Bramble with a new number, &quot;Barnum&#x27;s Lament&quot;, replacing &quot;The Prince of Humbug&quot;, slight revisions elsewhere and new orchestrations by William David Brohn.

The national tour of Cameron Mackintosh and Chichester Festival Theatre&#x27;s production opened at Curve, Leicester in September 2014 and ran until August 2015. The tour starred Brian Conley in the title role, alongside Linzi Hateley as Charity.

=== London revival (2017-18) ===
The show received a further London revival at the Menier Chocolate Factory from 5 December 2017, with previews from 25 November to 3 March 2018. Gordon Greenberg directed it, with choreography by Rebecca Howell, design by Paul Farnsworth and musical direction by Alex Parker. The production starred Marcus Brigstocke in the title role, Laura Pitt-Pulford as Charity, Celinde Schoenmaker as Jenny Lind, Tupele Dorgu as Joice Heath and Harry Francis as Tom Thumb.

=== Newbury revival (2024) ===
A new production will open at the Watermill Theatre, Newbury, Berkshire from 2 July to 8 September 2024, directed by Jonathan O’Boyle and choreographed by Oti Mabuse. Cast and further creative team will be announced at a later date.

===Other productions===
Stacy Keach played Barnum in a June 1981 production at the Kennedy Center with Dee Hoty as Charity and Terri White reprising her Broadway role as Joice Heth.

Other productions were staged in France (1981) starring Jean-Luc Moreau, Australia (1982) starring Reg Livermore, Italy (1983) starring Massimo Ranieri, Madrid (1984) starring Emilio Aragón, The Netherlands (1988) starring Mike Burstyn, Florida, USA (2008) starring Brad Oscar, and Melbourne, Australia (2019) starring Todd McKenney.

==Recording==
The Original Broadway Cast recording was released in 1980 and issued on CD in 1986. The London cast album &quot;Michael Crawford in Barnum&quot; was released on January 1, 1994, by Musicrama, Inc. The original Madrid cast album (starring Emilio Aragón) was released in 1984 by BAT Discos S.A. Now a collector&#x27;s item, this Spanish language recording has never been released on CD. A French cast album (ZL 37467) starring Jean-Luc Moreau was released in 1981; it is unknown at this time if a CD version has been released.

An Australian cast recording was released starring Reg Livermore by RCA Victor.

==Response==
According to Don Wilmeth, &quot;Barnum&quot; &quot;was blessed with a brilliant production by director-choreographer Joe Layton, who turned the theatre into a circus, and a memorable performance by Jim Dale.&quot;

Thomas Hischak wrote: &quot;Joe Layton directed and choreographed with inventive and colorful theatrics, and [Jim] Dale endeared himself to audiences by singing, dancing, walking a tightrope, clowning, and riding a unicycle, most of which had nothing to do with anything. Critics carped but playgoers knew a fun show when they saw one so the show ran for 854 performances.&quot;

<text>Figure skating at the [[1948 Winter Olympics]] took place at the Olympic Ice Rink in St. Moritz, Switzerland. Three figure skating events were contested: men&#x27;s singles, ladies&#x27; singles, and pair skating.

==Event summary==
Barbara Ann Scott became the first Canadian to win the figure skating gold medal while Dick Button became the first American to win a figure skating title for the United States. Button also became the first figure skater to perform a double Axel in competition. The pair of Micheline Lannoy and Pierre Baugniet became the first Belgians to win the figure skating gold medal, as well as the first Belgians to win a gold medal at the Winter Olympics.

The competition began with the men&#x27;s compulsory figures on 2 February. However, the next day, competition was postponed in the midst of the ladies&#x27; figures event due to a thaw that left puddles of water on the outdoor ice surface. On 5 February competition had to be resumed, regardless of poor ice conditions, in order to allow the Games to finish on schedule. The pairs event on 7 February was skated in a heavy snowstorm, with the ice having to be scraped after each program.

<text>The men&#x27;s [[ice hockey]] tournament at the [[1924 Winter Olympics]] in Chamonix, France, was the second Olympic Championship, also serving as the second World Championships. The competition was held from Monday, January 28, 1924, to Sunday, February 3, 1924. Canada, represented by the Toronto Granites, defended its championship from the 1920 Summer Olympics. The United States and Great Britain took the silver and bronze respectively, while other contenders included Czechoslovakia, France, and Sweden.

The Bergvall system used in the 1920 Olympics was discarded in favor of a two-level round-robin tournament. Qualifying teams were placed in pools for the opening round, with the top two teams in each pool advancing to the final round. The medals were awarded based on the record in the final round. This format would remain in use until the 1992 Winter Olympics, when the final round-robin was replaced with a medal-round single-elimination tournament.

The Canadian Amateur Hockey Association (CAHA) chose the Toronto Granites as the 1923 Allan Cup champions to represent Canada, and W. A. Hewitt was chosen oversee the national team&#x27;s finances at the Olympics. Hewitt was empowered by the CAHA to name replacement players as needed, and recruited Harold McMunn and Cyril Slater as replacements when four players from the Granites were unable to travel to the Olympics. In his weekly report to the &quot;Toronto Daily Star&quot;, Hewitt wrote that the Granites would face multiple changes in conditions compared to hockey games in Canada. He did not feel the team would be affected by playing outdoors on natural ice in the morning or afternoon, despite that the team was accustomed to playing indoors with electric lighting on artificial ice. He also felt that the larger ice surface and lack of boards around the sides of the rink would mean more stick handling and less physical play.

Austria was eligible to compete after having been excluded in 1920, but they withdrew just before the tournament due to the ineligibility of three international players.

==Medalists==
==Participating nations==

A total of 82&quot;(*)&quot; ice hockey players from eight nations competed at the Chamonix Games:

==Final round==


Note: The CAN v SWE and USA v GBR games were carried forward from the previous round.

When the Olympics organizers wanted to select hockey referees by drawing names out of a hat, Hewitt and United States Amateur Hockey Association president William S. Haddock agreed to a coin toss to decide on the referee for the game between Canada and the United States men&#x27;s national team. Hewitt feared having an inexperienced referee for the game, and his suggested to have Ligue Internationale de Hockey sur Glace (LIHG) president Paul Loicq officiate the game was confirmed by the coin toss. The Granites defeated the United States team by a 6–1 score, and won all six games played to be the Olympic gold medallists.

==Statistics==
===Average age===
Team Czechoslovakia was the oldest team in the tournament, averaging 31 years and 5 months. Team Belgium was the youngest team in the tournament, averaging 24 years and 1 months. Gold medalists Canada averaged 25 years and 2 months. Tournament average was 27 years and 11 months.

<text>Yang Wei (; born February 8, 1980, in Xiantao, Hubei) is a Chinese gymnast.

==Career==
Yang Wei won the silver medal in the individual all-around competition and won the gold in the team event at the 2000 Olympics in Sydney.

In 2003, he again won the gold in the team event and silver in the all-around competition at the 2003 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships in Anaheim.

At the 2004 Olympics in Athens, his world championship winning team finished fifth after many of them fell. Wei was also the favorite to win the gold medal at the Individual All-Around in Athens as well, but a fall from the high bar earned him a low score of 8.975 and put him out of medal contention. He placed seventh that night. The Chinese team redeemed itself by taking gold in the 2008 Olympics in Beijing, beating out Japan and the United States.

Yang returned to form at the 2006 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships in Aarhus, by winning gold in the team event, individual all-around and parallel bars competitions. He also won gold medal in the team event, individual all-around, rings and parallel bars competitions at the 2006 Asian Games.

He successfully defended his team and all-around titles at the 2007 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships in Stuttgart, and won the all-around and rings at the Chinese National Championships in 2007 and 2008.

Yang Wei won gold in the individual all-around and the team final at the 2008 Olympics in Beijing. He also won a silver in the rings event final and placed fourth in the pommel horse event final.

Yang Wei is best known for his impressive difficulty scores across the six events.

==Personal life==
Yang Wei has a long-time relationship with former gymnast, Yang Yun, who is an Olympic bronze medalist (uneven bars) for China, and now a CCTV reporter. In June 2006, Yang Wei invited Yang Yun to a news conference, which turned out to be a ploy for him to surprise her with a proposal. While he trained for the Beijing Olympic Games, the two had very few chances to be together, and kept in touch through text messaging. After his Olympic gold in the All-Around in Beijing on Thursday, Yang Wei faced the camera and mouthed the words, &quot;I love you,&quot; to his fiancée. Yang Yun, who watched his victory on television, shouted &quot;I love you, too!&quot; back to the screen. Yang Wei: &quot;Gold Medal for my Love!&quot; The two married on November 6, 2008. Their son, Yang Wenchang (), was born November 2009. Their twin daughters were born in 2017.

<text>The men&#x27;s [[ice hockey]] tournament at the [[1928 Winter Olympics]] in St. Moritz, Switzerland, was the third Olympic Championship, also serving as the third World Championships and the 13th European Championships. Canada, represented by the University of Toronto Graduates, won its third consecutive gold medal. Highest finishing European team Sweden won the silver medal and its third European Championship.

Conn Smythe coached the Graduates to the 1927 Allan Cup championship during the Ontario Hockey Association season, but refused to go to the Olympics due to disagreements on which players were added to the team by the Canadian Olympic Committee. The Graduates went without Smythe, led by team captain Red Porter. Canadian Olympic Committee member W. A. Hewitt was opposed to the format of the hockey tournament, which saw the Canadian team receive a bye into the second round. He wanted the team to have more games, rather than be idle for a week. Despite the wait to play, the Graduates won all three games by scoring 38 goals and conceding none, to win the gold medal.

==Medalists==
==Participating nations==
A total of 128&quot;(*)&quot; ice hockey players from eleven nations competed at the St. Moritz Games:
* 
* 
* 
* 
* 

Defending champion Canada, which outscored its opponents 132–3 in the previous competition, was granted a bye to the medal round, after officials realised how superior they were to all of the other teams. The other 10 teams were placed in three groups for the first round.

==First round==

===Group A===

===Group B===

===Group C===


==Final round==
The top teams from each of the three groups were joined by defending champion Canada in the medal round, playing a 3-game round-robin to determine the medal winners.

The match between Canada and Sweden was refereed by Paul Loicq, president of the International Ice Hockey Federation.

==Statistics==
===Average age===
Team Hungary was the oldest team in the tournament, averaging 31 years and 6 months. Team Belgium was the youngest team in the tournament, averaging 21 years and 6 months. Gold medalists Canada averaged 24 years and 10 months. Tournament average was 26 years and 9 months.

<text>The men&#x27;s [[ice hockey]] tournament at the [[1932 Winter Olympics]] in Lake Placid, United States, was the fourth Olympic Championship, also serving as the sixth World Championships. Canada, represented by the Winnipeg Hockey Club, won its fourth consecutive Olympic gold medal and sixth consecutive World Championship. The United States secured the silver medal and Germany claimed one of its three all-time hockey medals by taking the bronze (West Germany would win a bronze medal in 1976, and Germany&#x27;s men&#x27;s team would win silver in 2018). Overall, four teams participated, with only two European associations (Germany and Poland) making the trip due to the worldwide Great Depression.

<doc id="935515" wikidata="Q1541178" url="?curid=935515" title="Contingency table">
<text>In statistics, a contingency table (also known as a cross tabulation or crosstab) is a type of table in a matrix format that displays the multivariate frequency distribution of the variables. They are heavily used in survey research, business intelligence, engineering, and scientific research. They provide a basic picture of the interrelation between two variables and can help find interactions between them. The term &quot;contingency table&quot; was first used by Karl Pearson in &quot;On the Theory of Contingency and Its Relation to Association and Normal Correlation&quot;, part of the &quot;Drapers&#x27; Company Research Memoirs Biometric Series I&quot; published in 1904.

A crucial problem of multivariate statistics is finding the (direct-)dependence structure underlying the variables contained in high-dimensional contingency tables. If some of the conditional independences are revealed, then even the storage of the data can be done in a smarter way (see Lauritzen (2002)). In order to do this one can use information theory concepts, which gain the information only from the distribution of probability, which can be expressed easily from the contingency table by the relative frequencies.

A pivot table is a way to create contingency tables using spreadsheet software.

==Example==
Suppose there are two variables, sex (male or female) and handedness (right- or left-handed). Further suppose that 100 individuals are randomly sampled from a very large population as part of a study of sex differences in handedness. A contingency table can be created to display the numbers of individuals who are male right-handed and left-handed, female right-handed and left-handed. Such a contingency table is shown below.
The numbers of the males, females, and right- and left-handed individuals are called marginal totals. The grand total (the total number of individuals represented in the contingency table) is the number in the bottom right corner.

The table allows users to see at a glance that the proportion of men who are right-handed is about the same as the proportion of women who are right-handed although the proportions are not identical. The strength of the association can be measured by the odds ratio, and the population odds ratio estimated by the sample odds ratio. The significance of the difference between the two proportions can be assessed with a variety of statistical tests including Pearson&#x27;s chi-squared test, the &quot;G&quot;-test, Fisher&#x27;s exact test, Boschloo&#x27;s test, and Barnard&#x27;s test, provided the entries in the table represent individuals randomly sampled from the population about which conclusions are to be drawn. If the proportions of individuals in the different columns vary significantly between rows (or vice versa), it is said that there is a &quot;contingency&quot; between the two variables. In other words, the two variables are &quot;not&quot; independent. If there is no contingency, it is said that the two variables are &quot;independent&quot;.

The example above is the simplest kind of contingency table, a table in which each variable has only two levels; this is called a 2 × 2 contingency table. In principle, any number of rows and columns may be used. There may also be more than two variables, but higher order contingency tables are difficult to represent visually. The relation between ordinal variables, or between ordinal and categorical variables, may also be represented in contingency tables, although such a practice is rare. For more on the use of a contingency table for the relation between two ordinal variables, see Goodman and Kruskal&#x27;s gamma.

== Standard contents of a contingency table ==
* Multiple columns (historically, they were designed to use up all the white space of a printed page). Where each row refers to a specific sub-group in the population (in this case men or women), the columns are sometimes referred to as &quot;banner points&quot; or &quot;cuts&quot; (and the rows are sometimes referred to as &quot;stubs&quot;).
* Significance tests. Typically, either &quot;column comparisons&quot;, which test for differences between columns and display these results using letters, or, &quot;cell comparisons&quot;, which use color or arrows to identify a cell in a table that stands out in some way.
* &quot;Nets&quot; or &quot;netts&quot; which are sub-totals.
* One or more of: percentages, row percentages, column percentages, indexes or averages.
* Unweighted sample sizes (counts).

==Measures of association==
The degree of association between the two variables can be assessed by a number of coefficients. The following subsections describe a few of them. For a more complete discussion of their uses, see the main articles linked under each subsection heading.

===Odds ratio===
The simplest measure of association for a 2 × 2 contingency table is the odds ratio. Given two events, A and B, the odds ratio is defined as the ratio of the odds of A in the presence of B and the odds of A in the absence of B, or equivalently (due to symmetry), the ratio of the odds of B in the presence of A and the odds of B in the absence of A. Two events are independent if and only if the odds ratio is 1; if the odds ratio is greater than 1, the events are positively associated; if the odds ratio is less than 1, the events are negatively associated.

The odds ratio has a simple expression in terms of probabilities; given the joint probability distribution:
:formula_1
the odds ratio is:
:formula_2

===Phi coefficient===

A simple measure, applicable only to the case of 2 × 2 contingency tables, is the phi coefficient (φ) defined by

: formula_3

where is computed as in Pearson&#x27;s chi-squared test, and &quot;N&quot; is the grand total of observations. φ varies from 0 (corresponding to no association between the variables) to 1 or −1 (complete association or complete inverse association), provided it is based on frequency data represented in 2 × 2 tables. Then its sign equals the sign of the product of the main diagonal elements of the table minus the product of the off–diagonal elements. φ takes on the minimum value −1.0 or the maximum value of +1.0 if and only if every marginal proportion is equal to 0.5 (and two diagonal cells are empty).

===Cramér&#x27;s &quot;V&quot; and the contingency coefficient &quot;C&quot;===

Two alternatives are the &quot;contingency coefficient&quot; &quot;C&quot;, and Cramér&#x27;s V.

The formulae for the &quot;C&quot; and &quot;V&quot; coefficients are:

: formula_4 and

: formula_5

&quot;k&quot; being the number of rows or the number of columns, whichever is less.

&quot;C&quot; suffers from the disadvantage that it does not reach a maximum of 1.0, notably the highest it can reach in a 2 × 2 table is 0.707 . It can reach values closer to 1.0 in contingency tables with more categories; for example, it can reach a maximum of 0.870 in a 4 × 4 table. It should, therefore, not be used to compare associations in different tables if they have different numbers of categories.

&quot;C&quot; can be adjusted so it reaches a maximum of 1.0 when there is complete association in a table of any number of rows and columns by dividing &quot;C&quot; by formula_6 where &quot;k&quot; is the number of rows or columns, when the table is square , or by formula_7 where &quot;r&quot; is the number of rows and &quot;c&quot; is the number of columns.

===Tetrachoric correlation coefficient===

Another choice is the tetrachoric correlation coefficient but it is only applicable to 2 × 2 tables. Polychoric correlation is an extension of the tetrachoric correlation to tables involving variables with more than two levels.

Tetrachoric correlation assumes that the variable underlying each dichotomous measure is normally distributed. The coefficient provides &quot;a convenient measure of [the Pearson product-moment] correlation when graduated measurements have been reduced to two categories.&quot;

The tetrachoric correlation coefficient should not be confused with the Pearson correlation coefficient computed by assigning, say, values 0.0 and 1.0 to represent the two levels of each variable (which is mathematically equivalent to the φ coefficient).

=== Lambda coefficient ===

The lambda coefficient is a measure of the strength of association of the cross tabulations when the variables are measured at the nominal level. Values range from 0.0 (no association) to 1.0 (the maximum possible association).

Asymmetric lambda measures the percentage improvement in predicting the dependent variable. Symmetric lambda measures the percentage improvement when prediction is done in both directions.

=== Uncertainty coefficient ===

The uncertainty coefficient, or Theil&#x27;s U, is another measure for variables at the nominal level. Its values range from −1.0 (100% negative association, or perfect inversion) to +1.0 (100% positive association, or perfect agreement). A value of 0.0 indicates the absence of association.

Also, the uncertainty coefficient is conditional and an asymmetrical measure of association, which can be expressed as
:formula_8.
This asymmetrical property can lead to insights not as evident in symmetrical measures of association.

*Kendall&#x27;s tau: Adjustment for ties.
**Tau-b: Used for square tables.
**Tau-c: Used for rectangular tables.

<text>The men&#x27;s [[ice hockey]] tournament at the [[1936 Winter Olympics]] in Garmisch-Partenkirchen, Germany, was the fifth Olympic Championship, also serving as the tenth World Championships and the 21st European Championships.

The British national ice hockey team pulled off a major upset when they won the gold medal, marking a number of firsts in international ice hockey competition. Great Britain made history as the first team ever to win an Olympic, World, and European (its second) Championships and the first to win all three in the same year. They were the first team to stop Canada from winning the Olympic ice hockey gold, following Canada&#x27;s four consecutive gold medals.

==Tournament summary==
In previous Olympics, the Great Britain team had finished third (1924), and fourth (1928) but with teams that were, &quot;largely composed of Canadian Army officers and university graduates living in the U.K.&quot; It was decided that their team must be British-born this time, and while only one player on the team was born in Canada, nine of the thirteen players on the roster grew up in Canada, and eleven had played previously in Canada.


The Ligue Internationale de Hockey sur Glace (LIHG) which oversaw ice hockey at the Olympics, met before the games started and ruled that Jimmy Foster and Alex Archer were ineligible to compete for Great Britain since the players were under suspension by the Canadian Amateur Hockey Association (CAHA) for not seeking permission to transfer internationally. Great Britain&#x27;s manager Bunny Ahearne contested that international rules stated a player could leave a country without seeking permission, and the CAHA suspensions should not apply. CAHA president E. A. Gilroy had lodged a complaint with the LIHG in September 1935, but the LIHG had not held a meeting until the eve of the Olympics. Gilroy denied making a last-minute protest for fear of Canada (represented by 1935 Allan Cup runners-up Port Arthur Bearcats) losing to Great Britain. He chose not to object to the two players participating as a gesture of sportsmanship towards Great Britain. The Canadian Press reported that Canadian officials agreed to lift the suspensions on Foster and Archer after &quot;considerable pressure had been brought to bear on Canadian officials by British Olympic higher-ups&quot;.

Still unhappy with the state of affairs were the Americans, who did not believe the rules were being followed, and the French, who were very angry that Canada did not repeal their protest with them. Before the second round of games began, other participating hockey nations threatened to protest the victories by Great Britain due to the use of CAHA players, and called for an emergency meeting.

Yugoslavia was to have competed, but dropped out on short notice. For the opening round, the 15 teams were drawn into three groups of four and one group of three. The top four finishers of the 1935 World Championships (Canada, Switzerland, Great Britain, Czechoslovakia) were guaranteed placement in separate groups. And despite the non-participation of the United States the previous year, the organizers recognized the relative strength of the American team, and guaranteed their placement would not be in World Champion Canada&#x27;s group. 

The tournament itself featured very close play for the medals. It was played in three rounds beginning with four groups, where the two best teams of each group moved on to two groups of four, where again the two best moved on to a final round robin group of four, to determine the medals.

The major upset occurred in the semi-finals, when Britain&#x27;s Edgar Brenchley scored late in the third to defeat Canada two to one, setting up the eventual gold medal outcome. The format at these Olympics was to have head-to-head results from the semi-finals carried forward, so that the finals could be a four team round robin with only two additional games per team. The British team&#x27;s shock victory over the Canadians, plus the win by the USA over Czechoslovakia, both counted in the tables for the final round.

Before the final round began, Canada threatened to withdraw from Olympic hockey when it learned that the playoffs format would carry over the loss to Great Britain past the second round-robin series, since the tournament format stated that teams did not have to play one another more than once. Gilroy was unaware of the playoff format in advance of the Olympics, and took objection to the sportsmanship of Canadian officials being questioned, after a special meeting decided not to alter the format.

In the final round, the British team beat Czechoslovakia, then played six scoreless periods against the USA before the game was called a tie, ensuring a silver or gold for the British. In the tournament&#x27;s final game, Canada could win silver, and Britain gold, if Canada defeated the US. The Americans could still have deprived Britain of the gold with a win over Canada by a score that matched or bested Britain&#x27;s goal ratio, for example 1-0 or 5-1. The Americans were very tired from the marathon scoreless tie, and lost one to nothing. The 1936 tournament was the first time in which Canada did not win the gold medal in ice hockey at the Olympic Games, which led to the CAHA and Gilroy being heavily scrutinized by media in Canada.

Another story of this Olympic hockey tournament was the participation of Rudi Ball. The German leadership allowed this top player to lead their hockey team at these German hosted Olympics, making him the only Jew to represent Germany at these Olympic Games.

N.B. – Tournament rules stated that relevant results from the semi-final round would be carried over to the final round. After the semi-final round, the Canadian Amateur Hockey Association and the German organizers appealed against this rule and asked that in the final stage all four teams should play each other with the semi-final results ignored. This appeal was overwhelmingly rejected by the Olympic authorities. Thus, the 11 February games of Canada vs. Great Britain and the United States vs. Czechoslovakia were counted as games in the final round, hence their replication in both tables.

Team Belgium was the oldest team in the tournament, averaging 29 years and 2 months. Team Germany was the youngest team in the tournament, averaging 23 years and 1 months. Gold medalists Great Britain averaged 25 years and 4 months. Tournament average was 25 years and 2 months.

===Top scorer===

There is some disagreement as to the totals of Farquharson, both the IOC and IIHF maintain that he scored ten goals. Assist totals were not officially tabulated at the time, and sources indicate anywhere from five to ten.

<doc id="935530" wikidata="Q519443" url="?curid=935530" title="Orphism (art)">
<text>Orphism or Orphic Cubism, a term coined by the French poet Guillaume Apollinaire in 1912, was an offshoot of Cubism that focused on pure abstraction and bright colors, influenced by Fauvism, the theoretical writings of Paul Signac, Charles Henry and the dye chemist Michel Eugène Chevreul. This movement, perceived as key in the transition from Cubism to Abstract art, was pioneered by František Kupka, Robert Delaunay and Sonia Delaunay, who relaunched the use of color during the monochromatic phase of Cubism. The meaning of the term Orphism was elusive when it first appeared and remains to some extent vague.

==History==

The Orphists were rooted in Cubism but tended towards a pure lyrical abstraction. They saw art as the unification of sensation and color. More concerned with sensation, they began with recognizable subjects, depicted with abstract structures. Orphism aimed to vacate recognizable subject matter by concentrating exclusively on &quot;form&quot; and &quot;color&quot;. The movement also strove toward the ideals of Simultanism: endless interrelated states of being.

The decomposition of spectral light in Neo-Impressionist color theory of Paul Signac and Charles Henry played an important role in the development of Orphism. Robert Delaunay, Albert Gleizes, and Gino Severini all knew Henry personally. A mathematician, inventor, and esthetician, Charles Henry was a close friend of the Symbolist writers Félix Fénéon and Gustave Kahn. He also knew Seurat, Signac and Pissarro, whom he met during the eighth and last Impressionist exhibition in 1886. Henry brought &quot;emotional associational theory&quot; into the realm of art: something that ultimately influenced the Neo-Impressionists. Henry and Seurat agreed that the basic elements of art—line, color and form—like words, could be treated independently, each with its own abstract quantity, independent of one another, or in unison, depending on the intention of the artist. &quot;Seurat knows well&quot; wrote Fénéton in 1889, &quot;that the line, independent of its topographical role, possesses an assessable abstract value&quot; in addition to the particles of color, and the relation to emotion of the viewer. The underlying theory behind Neo-Impressionsim had a lasting effect on the works of Delaunay. The Neo-Impressionists had succeeded in establishing an objective scientific basis for their painting in the domain of color, but only as regards the spectrum of light (for paint pigments the result was less scientific). The Cubists ultimately employed the theory to some extent in color, form and &quot;dynamics&quot;.

The Symbolists perceived Orpheus of Greek mythology as the ideal artist. In 1907 Apollinaire wrote &quot;Bestiaire ou cortège d&#x27;Orphée&quot;, symbolizing Orpheus as a mystic and influential poet and artist, just as the Symbolists. &quot;The voice of light&quot; that Apollinaire mentioned in his poems was a metaphor for &quot;inner experiences&quot;.

==Apollinaire==
Apollinaire mentioned the term Orphism in an address at the Salon de la Section d&#x27;Or in 1912, referring to the &quot;pure painting&quot; of František Kupka. In his 1913 &quot;Les Peintres Cubistes, Méditations Esthétiques&quot; Apollinaire described Orphism as &quot;the art of painting new totalities with elements that the artist does not take from visual reality, but creates entirely by himself. [...] An Orphic painter&#x27;s works should convey an &#x27;untroubled aesthetic pleasure&#x27;, a meaningful structure and sublime significance.&quot; Orphism represented a new art-form, much as music was to literature. These analogies could be seen in the titles of paintings such as Kupka&#x27;s &quot;Amorpha: Fugue in Two Colors&quot; (1912); Francis Picabia&#x27;s &quot;Dance at the Source&quot; (1912) and Wassily Kandinsky&#x27;s &quot;Über das Geistige in der Kunst&quot; (1912). Kandinsky described the relationships between sound and color. Robert Delaunay was concerned with color and music, and exhibited with the Blaue Reiter at the request of Kandinsky. The increasingly abstract paintings of Fernand Léger, and Marcel Duchamp were also treated as Orphists by Apollinaire.

==Exhibitions==
The Salon de la Section d&#x27;Or in 1912 was the first exhibition that presented Orphism to the general public. In March 1913 Orphism was exhibited at the Salon des Indépendants in Paris. Reviewing the salon in &quot;Montjoie&quot; (29 March 1913) Apollinaire argued for the abolition of Cubism in favor of Orphism: &quot;If Cubism is dead, long live Cubism. The kingdom of Orpheus is at hand!&quot;

The Autumn salon (Erster Deutscher Herbstsalon, Berlin) of 1913, organized by Herwarth Walden of Der Sturm, exhibited many works by Robert and Sonia Delaunay, Jean Metzinger&#x27;s &quot;L&#x27;Oiseau bleu&quot; (1913, Musée d&#x27;Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris), Albert Gleizes&#x27; &quot;Les Joueurs de football&quot; (1912–13, National Gallery of Art), paintings by Picabia, and Léger, along with several Futurist works. From this exhibition Apollinaire&#x27;s relation with R. Delaunay cooled, following remarks with Umberto Boccioni about the ambiguity of &#x27;simultaneity&#x27;. Apollinaire no longer used the term Orphism in his subsequent writings and began instead promoting Picabia, Alexander Archipenko, and Futurist concepts.
==The Delaunays==
Robert Delaunay and his wife Sonia Terk Delaunay remained the main protagonists of the Orphic movement. Their earlier works focused on Fauvist colors, variously abstract; such as Sonia&#x27;s 1907 &quot;Finnish Girl&quot; and Robert&#x27;s 1906 &quot;Paysage au disque&quot;, the former relying on pure colors, the latter on color and mosaic-like brushstrokes painted under the influence of Jean Metzinger, also a Neo-Impressionist (with highly Divisionist and Fauve components) at the time.

Delaunay officially broke with cubism in 1912, faulting Picasso for restricting the palette of his still lifes to muted, monkish tones of brown and gray, and for retaining traces of figurative imagery.

Even though Orphism was effectively dissolved before World War I, American painters Patrick Henry Bruce and Arthur Burdett Frost Jr., two of R. Delaunay&#x27;s pupils, embarked on a similar form of art from 1912 onward. The Synchromists Morgan Russell and Stanton Macdonald-Wright wrote their own manifestos in an attempt to differentiate themselves from the Orphism of the Delaunays.

<doc id="935534" wikidata="Q277450" url="?curid=935534" title="Aceh War">
<text>The Aceh War (), also known as the Dutch War or the Infidel War (1873–1904), was an armed military conflict between the Sultanate of Aceh and the Kingdom of the Netherlands which was triggered by discussions between representatives of Aceh and the United States in Singapore during early 1873. The war was part of a series of conflicts in the late 19th century that consolidated Dutch rule over modern-day Indonesia.

The campaign drew controversy in the Netherlands as photographs and accounts of the death toll were reported. Isolated bloody insurgencies continued as late as 1914 and less violent forms of Acehnese resistance continued to persist until World War II and the Japanese occupation.

==Background==
For much of the 19th century, Aceh&#x27;s independence had been guaranteed by the Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1824. During the 1820s, Aceh became a regional political and commercial power, supplying half of the world&#x27;s pepper, which increased the revenues and influence of local feudal rajas. Growing European and American demand for pepper led to a series of diplomatic skirmishes between the British, French and Americans. During the reign of Sultan Alauddin Ibrahim Mansur Syah (1838–1870), the Aceh Sultanate brought the regional rajas under its control and extended its domain over the east coast. However, this southward trend clashed with the northwards expansion of Dutch colonialism in Sumatra.

Following the 1869 opening of the Suez Canal and changing shipping routes, the British and Dutch signed the 1871 Anglo-Dutch Treaty of Sumatra which ended British territorial claims to Sumatra, allowing the Dutch a free hand within their sphere of influence in Maritime Southeast Asia while handing them the responsibility to check piracy. In return, Britain gained control of the Dutch Gold Coast in Africa and equal commercial rights in Siak. Dutch territorial ambitions in Aceh were fuelled by a desire to exploit its natural resources, especially black pepper and oil, and to eliminate an independent native state player. The Dutch also sought to ward off rival colonial powers that had ambitions in Southeast Asia, particularly the British and the French.

==Combat operations==

===Strategies===
The Dutch tried several strategies over the course of the war; single rapid attacks in 1873 failed, which then led them to pursue a naval blockade, reconciliation efforts, concentration within a line of forts, and finally passive containment. This all had scant success. The operations costs were 15 to 20 million guilders a year, which nearly bankrupted the colonial government.

===First Dutch offensive===

In 1873, negotiations took place in Singapore between representatives of the Aceh Sultanate and the local American Consul over a potential bilateral treaty. The Dutch saw this as a violation of a prior agreement with the British in 1871 and used this as an opportunity to annex Aceh militarily. An expedition under Major General Johan Harmen Rudolf Köhler was sent out on 26 March 1873, which bombarded the capital Banda Aceh and was able to occupy most of the coastal areas by April. It was the intention of the Dutch to attack and take the Sultan&#x27;s palace, which would also lead to the occupation of the entire country. The Sultan requested and possibly received military aid from Italy and the United Kingdom in Singapore. In any case the Aceh army was rapidly modernised and enlarged with figures ranging from 10,000 to 100,000. Underestimating the military abilities of the Acehnese, the Dutch made some tactical errors and sustained losses including the deaths of Köhler and 80 troops. These defeats undermined Dutch morale and prestige.

After deciding to retreat, the Dutch imposed a naval blockade of Aceh. In an attempt to preserve Aceh&#x27;s independence, Sultan Mahmud appealed to the other Western powers and the Ottoman Empire for direct help but to little avail. While the American Consul was sympathetic, the American government remained neutral. Due to its weak position in the international political stage, the Ottoman Empire was impotent and the British refused to intervene due to their relations with the Dutch. Only the French agreed to respond to Mahmud&#x27;s appeal.

===Second Dutch offensive===

In November 1873, a second expedition consisting of 13,000 troops led by General Jan van Swieten was dispatched to Aceh. The invasion coincided with a cholera outbreak which killed thousands on both sides. By January 1874, deteriorating conditions forced Sultan Mahmud Syah and his followers to abandon Banda Aceh and retreat to the interior. Meanwhile, Dutch forces occupied the capital and captured the symbolically important &quot;dalam&quot; (sultan&#x27;s palace), leading the Dutch to believe that they had won. The Dutch occupiers then abolished the Acehnese Sultanate and declared Aceh to be annexed to the Dutch East Indies proper.

Following Mahmud&#x27;s death from cholera, the Acehnese proclaimed a young grandson of Alauddin Ibrahim Mansur Syah, named Tuanku Muhammad Daud, as Alauddin Muhammad Da&#x27;ud Syah II (r. 1874–1903) and continued their struggle in the hills and jungle territory for ten years, with heavy casualties on both sides. Around 1880 the Dutch strategy changed, and rather than continuing the war, they now concentrated on defending areas they already controlled, which were mostly limited to the capital city (modern Banda Aceh), and the harbour town of Ulee Lheue. Dutch naval blockades succeeded in forcing the &quot;uleebelang&quot; or secular chiefs to sign treaties that extended Dutch control along the coastal regions. However, the uleebelang then used their newly restored revenues to finance the Acehnese resistance forces.

The Dutch intervention in Aceh cost the lives of thousands of troops and was a severe drain on the colonial government&#x27;s financial expenditure. On 13 October 1880 the colonial government declared the war was over and installed a civilian government, but continued spending heavily to maintain control over the areas it occupied. In an attempt to win the support of the local Acehnese, the Dutch rebuilt the Masjid Raya Baiturrahman or Great Mosque in Banda Aceh as a gesture of reconciliation.

===Holy war===
War began again in 1883, when the British ship &quot;Nisero&quot; was stranded in Aceh, in an area where the Dutch had little influence. A local leader asked for ransom from both the Dutch and the British, and under British pressure the Dutch were forced to attempt to liberate the sailors. After a failed Dutch attempt to rescue the hostages, where the local leader Teuku Umar was asked for help but he refused, the Dutch together with the British invaded the territory. The Sultan gave up the hostages, and received a large amount of cash in exchange.

The Dutch Minister of Warfare August Willem Philip Weitzel again declared open war on Aceh, and warfare continued with little success, as before. Facing a technologically superior foe, the Acehnese resorted to guerrilla warfare, particularly traps and ambushes. Dutch troops retaliated by wiping out entire villages and murdering both prisoners and civilians. In 1884, the Dutch responded by withdrawing all their forces in Aceh into a fortified line around Banda Aceh. The Dutch now also tried to enlist local leaders: the aforementioned Umar was bought with cash, opium, and weapons. Umar received the title &quot;panglima prang besar&quot; (Great war commander).

Umar instead called himself &quot;Teuku Djohan Pahlawan&quot; (Johan the Heroic). On 1 January 1894 Umar even received Dutch aid to build an army. However, two years later Umar attacked the Dutch with his new army, rather than aiding the Dutch in subjugating inner Aceh. This is recorded in Dutch history as &quot;Het verraad van Teukoe Oemar&quot; (The Treason of Teuku Umar). From the mid-1880s, the Acehnese military leadership was dominated by religious ulema, including Teungku Chik di Tiro (Muhamma Saman), who propagated the concept of a &quot;holy war&quot; through sermons and texts known as &quot;hikayat&quot; or poetic tales. Acehnese fighters viewed themselves as religious martyrs fighting &quot;infidel invaders&quot;. By this stage, the Aceh War was being used as a symbol of Muslim resistance to Western imperialism.

In 1892 and 1893 Aceh remained independent, despite the Dutch efforts. Major J. B. van Heutsz, a colonial military leader, then wrote a series of articles on Aceh. He was supported by Dr. Christiaan Snouck Hurgronje of the University of Leiden, then the leading Dutch expert on Islam. Hurgronje managed to get the confidence of many Aceh leaders and gathered valuable intelligence for the Dutch government on the activities of Indonesian Hajj pilgrims. His works remained an official secret for many years. In Hurgronje&#x27;s analysis of Acehnese society, he minimised the role of the Sultan and argued that attention should be paid to the hereditary chiefs and nobles, the &quot;Ulee Balang&quot;, who he felt could be trusted as local administrators. However, he argued, Aceh&#x27;s religious leaders, the &quot;ulema&quot;, could not be trusted or persuaded to co-operate, and must be destroyed. As part of a policy of divide-and-conquer, Hurgronje urged the Dutch leadership to widen the existing gulf between the Acehnese nobility and the religious leaders.

Hurgronje was a friend of the Arab Grand Mufti of Batavia, Habib Usman bin Yahya, who issued a fatwa to support the Dutch war against Aceh.

In 1894, the &quot;penghulu&quot; or judge Hasan Mustafa also helped bring a stop to the fighting by issuing a fatwa, telling the Muslims to submit to the Dutch colonial government.

===Pacification===

In 1898 Van Heutsz was proclaimed governor of Aceh, and with his lieutenant, later Dutch Prime Minister Hendrikus Colijn, would finally conquer most of Aceh. They followed Hurgronje&#x27;s suggestions, finding cooperative &quot;uleebelang&quot; that would support them in the countryside and isolating the resistance from their rural support base. The Dutch formulated a new strategy of counter-insurgency warfare by deploying light-armed Marechaussee units and using scorched earth tactics. Van Heutsz charged Colonel Gotfried Coenraad Ernst van Daalen with breaking remaining resistance. 
In 1903, the main secular Acehnese resistance leaders including Sultan Alauddin Muhammad Da&#x27;ud Syah II, Tuanku Raja Keumala, Mahmud and Muda Perkasa capitulated. During the 1904 campaign, Colonel van Daalen destroyed several villages, killing at least 2,922 Acehnese, among which were 1,149 women and children during the 1904 campaign. Dutch losses numbered 26, and Van Daalen was promoted. Episodes of marked Dutch military cruelty occurred during this period. Photographs of a June 1904 Dutch massacre in Kuta Reh village of the Alas people taken during the Dutch military expedition in Aceh&#x27;s Gayo and Alas regions, for example, indicate that killings of large groups of civilians occurred on some occasions. By the end of 1904 most of Aceh was under Dutch control, and had an indigenous government that cooperated with the colonial state. The Dutch consolidated their control over Aceh by practising a policy of religious tolerance as a means of dissuading the Acehnese from taking up an armed struggle. According to Historian Adrian Vickers, during the entire Aceh war, 50,000 to 60,000 Acehnese died from violence and disease, approximately 2,000 European and allied indigenous soldiers were killed in combat, and more than 35,000 soldiers and labourers died from disease. The destruction of entire communities also caused 10,000 Acehnese to flee to neighbouring Malaya.
In the Netherlands at the time, Van Heutsz was considered a hero, named the &#x27;Pacifier of Aceh&#x27; and was promoted to become governor-general of the entire Dutch Indies in 1904. A still-existent monument to him was erected in Amsterdam, though his image and name were later removed, to protest his violent legacy. The Dutch establishment defended its actions in Aceh by citing a moral imperative to liberate the masses from the oppression and backward practices of independent native rulers that did not meet accepted international norms. The Aceh War also encouraged Dutch annexation of other independent states in Bali, Moluccas, Borneo and Sulawesi between 1901 and 1910.

Colonial influence in the remote highland areas of Aceh was never substantial, however, and limited guerrilla resistance led by religious ulema persisted until 1942. Unable to dislodge the Dutch, many of the ulema gradually discontinued their resistance. The region of Gayo remained a centre of resistance as late as 1914. One intellectual Sayyid Ahmad Khan advocated discontinuing the &quot;jihad&quot; against the Dutch.

===Suicide attacks===
Muslim Acehnese from the Aceh Sultanate performed &quot;holy war&quot; known as &quot;Parang-sabil&quot; against invaders such as on the Americans in the attack on Joseph Peabody&#x27;s ship &quot;Friendship&quot;, during the First Sumatran expedition and the Second Sumatran expedition, and against the Dutch in the Dutch expedition on the west coast of Sumatra and most notably during the Aceh War, where they performed suicide attacks as part of &quot;parang sabil&quot;. It was considered as part of personal jihad in the Islamic religion of the Acehnese. The Dutch called it &quot;Atjèh-moord&quot;, (&quot;Acehmord&quot;, &quot;Aceh mord&quot;, &quot;Aceh-mord, Aceh Pungo&quot;). The Acehnese work of literature, the &quot;Hikayat Perang Sabil&quot; provided the background and reasoning for the &quot;Aceh-mord&quot; – Acehnese suicide attacks upon the Dutch. The Indonesian translations of the Dutch terms are &quot;Aceh bodoh&quot; (Aceh pungo) or &quot;Aceh gila&quot; (Aceh mord).

The original Acehnese-language work &quot;Hikayat Prang Sabi&quot; (see also: ) written with the Jawi script has been transliterated into the Latin alphabet and annotated by Ibrahim Alfian which was published in Jakarta. Perang sabi was the Acehnese word for jihad, a holy war and Acehnese language literary works on perang sabi were distributed by Islamic clerics (&quot;ulama&quot;) such as Teungku di Tiro to help the resistance against the Dutch in the Aceh War. The recompense awarded by the fighters in paradise (detailed in Arabic texts) and mentions of Dutch atrocities were expounded on in the Hikayat Perang Sabil which was communally read by small cabals of ulama and Acehnese who swore an oath before going to achieve the desired status of &quot;martyr&quot; by launching suicide attacks on the Dutch. Perang sabil was the Malay equivalent to other terms like Jihad, Ghazawat for &quot;Holy war&quot;.

Fiction novels like Sayf Muhammad Isa&#x27;s &quot;Sabil: Prahara di Bumi Rencong&quot; on the war by Aceh against the Dutch include references to Hikayat Perang Sabil. Mualimbunsu Syam Muhammad wrote the work titled &quot;Motives for Perang Sabil in Nusantara&quot; (&quot;Motivasi perang sabil di Nusantara: kajian kitab Ramalan Joyoboyo, Dalailul-Khairat, dan Hikayat Perang Sabil&quot;) on Indonesia&#x27;s history of Islamic holy war. Children and women were inspired to engage in suicide attacks by the Hikayat Perang Sabil against the Dutch. The hikayat is considered as an important part of 19th century Malay literature. In Dutch-occupied Aceh, the hikayat was confiscated from Sabi&#x27;s house during a police raid on 27 September 1917.

Dutch soldiers were attacked with blades wielded by Acehnese fighters on their feet.

&quot;Atjèh-moord&quot; was also used against the Japanese by the Acehnese during the Japanese occupation of Aceh. The Acehnese Ulama (Islamic clerics) fought against both the Dutch and the Japanese, revolting against the Dutch in February 1942 and against Japan in November 1942. The revolt was led by the All-Aceh Religious Scholars&#x27; Association (PUSA). The Japanese suffered 18 dead in the uprising while they slaughtered up to 100 or over 120 Acehnese. The revolt happened in Bayu and was centred around Tjot Plieng village&#x27;s religious school. During the revolt, the Japanese troops armed with mortars and machine guns were charged by sword wielding Acehnese under Teungku Abduldjalil (Tengku Abdul Djalil) in Buloh Gampong Teungah and Tjot Plieng on 10 and 13 November. In May 1945 the Acehnese rebelled again.

==Aftermath==
Following the Aceh War, local &quot;uleebelang&quot; (aristocracy) assisted the Dutch in maintaining control over Aceh through indirect rule. Despite the end of open conflict, popular Acehnese resistance against Dutch rule continued until the Japanese invasion of the Dutch East Indies in 1942. Throughout the early 20th century, Dutch citizens and personnel were targeted by sporadic suicide attacks by the Acehnese who were influenced by the &quot;Hikayat Perang Sabil&quot; and other proscribed texts. This phenomenon was known as the &quot;Atjeh-moord&quot; or &quot;Aceh murders&quot; and forced the Dutch government to maintain substantial forces within the province. During the early 20th century, Standard Oil and Royal Dutch Shell developed oil refineries to profit from the province&#x27;s substantial oil reserves.

Acehnese resentment was further stoked by a system of forced corvee labour where subjects were required to work on government roadwork projects for 24 days a year. By the mid-1920s, Aceh had reverted to a state of full-scale guerrilla warfare. Following the Japanese invasion, the occupying Japanese forces were initially welcomed by Acehnese nationalists as liberators though differences led to protracted resistance by Islamic-inspired rebels, culminating in a rebellion at Bayu.

The Acehnese &quot;ulama&quot; (Islamic clerics) fought against both the Dutch and the Japanese, revolting against the Dutch in February 1942 and against Japan in November 1942. The revolt was led by the Pan-Aceh Religious Scholars&#x27; Association (PUSA). The Japanese suffered 18 dead in the uprising while they slaughtered up to 100–120 Acehnese. The revolt happened in Bayu and was centred around Tjot Plieng village&#x27;s religious school. During the revolt, the Japanese troops armed with mortars and machine guns were charged by sword wielding Acehnese under Teungku Abduldjalil (Tengku Abdul Djalil) in Buloh Gampong Teungah and Tjot Plieng on 10 and 13 November. In May 1945 the Acehnese rebelled again. During the Indonesian National Revolution following the Japanese surrender in August 1945, the aristocracy were targeted for retribution due to their collaboration with the Dutch and the region became a stronghold for Sukarno&#x27;s Republicans. Due to the entrenched anti-colonial sentiment, the Dutch bypassed Aceh during their police actions from 1947 to 1948.

Following the Dutch transfer of sovereignty to Indonesia in August 1949, many Acehnese became dissatisfied with the policies of the Javanese-dominated central government in Jakarta and began agitating for autonomy. Grievances included Aceh&#x27;s incorporation into the predominantly Christian Batak province of North Sumatra, its poor financial and political rewards within the unitary Indonesian Republic and the failure to implement sharia law. In 1953, Sukarno stated that he opposed Aceh&#x27;s plan to enact sharia law, stating that &quot;Indonesia is a nation state with the ideology of Pancasila, not a theocratic country with a certain religious orientation.&quot; As told by Sajoeti, who also accompanied Sukarno, some of the Acehnese militant groups did not welcome Sukarno&#x27;s visit and even suspected that he had a secularizing agenda. These factors led to a short-lived rebellion by the Darul Islam movement under Daud Bereueh which was suppressed by the Indonesian armed forces. Despite this, many Acehnese and other Sumatrans resented key government and military positions being dominated by Javanese. The resulting rebellion led by the Free Aceh Movement raged in the province until a peace treaty was signed between the Acehnese movement and the Indonesian government following the Great Aceh tsunami.

===Dutch Kerkhof Poucut Cemetery===
Numerous Dutch casualties of the Aceh War are buried in the Kerkhof Peucut Cemetery (also called &quot;Peutjoet&quot; or &quot;Peutjut&quot; Cemetery), the Dutch military cemetery is located near the centre of Banda Aceh next to the Aceh Tsunami Museum. The Kerkhoff Poucut is recorded as the largest Dutch military cemetery outside of the Netherlands. There are around 2,200 graves of Dutch soldiers as well as recruits from Ambon, Manado and Java, as well as several Dutch generals.

<text>Messier 3 (M3; also NGC 5272) is a globular cluster of stars in the northern constellation of Canes Venatici. 

== Discovery ==
It was discovered on May 3, 1764, and was the first Messier object to be discovered by Charles Messier himself. Messier originally mistook the object for a nebula without stars. This mistake was corrected after the stars were resolved by William Herschel around 1784. Since then, it has become one of the best-studied globular clusters. Identification of the cluster&#x27;s unusually large variable star population was begun in 1913 by American astronomer Solon Irving Bailey and new variable members continue to be identified up through 2004.

== Visibility ==
Many amateur astronomers consider it one of the finest northern globular clusters, following only Messier 13. M3 has an apparent magnitude of 6.2, making it a difficult naked eye target even with dark conditions with averted vision. However, with a moderate-sized telescope, the cluster can be seen as a cloudy smudge even in severely light-polluted skies, and can be further defined in darker conditions. It can be found by looking almost exactly halfway along the north-west line that would join Arcturus (α Boötis) to Cor Caroli (α Canum Venaticorum). Using a telescope with a aperture, the cluster has a bright core with a diameter of about 6 arcminutes and spans a total of double that.

== Characteristics ==
This cluster is one of the largest and brightest, and is made up of around 500,000 stars. It is estimated to be 11.4 billion years old. It is centered at 32,600 light-years (10.0 kpc) away from Earth.

Messier 3 is quite isolated as it is above the Galactic plane and roughly from the center of the Milky Way. It contains 274 known variable stars, by far the most found in any globular cluster. These include 133 RR Lyrae variables, of which about a third display the Blazhko effect of long-period modulation. The overall abundance of elements other than hydrogen and helium, what astronomers term the metallicity, is in the range of −1.34 to −1.50 dex. This value gives the logarithm of the abundance relative to the Sun; the actual proportion is 3.2–4.6% of the solar abundance. Messier 3 is the prototype for the Oosterhoff type I cluster, which is considered &quot;metal-rich&quot;. That is, for a globular cluster, Messier 3 has a relatively high abundance of heavier elements.

Current glaciers cover an area and accounts for 27% of the Park area. Up until the early 1700s the area was a large single glacier of solid ice. It has since retreated and evolved into the largest protected water area park in the world. Glacier Bay, on the Gulf of Alaska, was known as the Grand Pacific Glacier, about thick and around in width. Over the last 200 years the glaciers have retreated, exposing of ocean, and in this process left 20 separate other glaciers in its trail. In 1890, the name &quot;Glacier Bay&quot; as such was given to the bay by Captain Lester A. Beardslee of the U.S. Navy. It was first proclaimed a U.S. National Monument on February 25, 1925, by President Calvin Coolidge.

The Glacier Bay has many branches, inlets, lagoons, islands, and channels that holds prospects for scientific exploration and visual treat. Thus, the area is popular as a cruise ship destination during summer season. However, there are restrictions imposed by the National Park Service on the numbers of vessels that can operate in a day to 2 cruise ships, 3 tour boats, 6 charter vessels, and 25 private vessels. The bay received an average of about 443,975 recreational visitors annually from 2012 to 2021, with 89,768 visitors in 2021.

==History==

Geologists believe that Glacier Bay existed during a minimum of four Glacial periods ending with the Little Ice Age, which has a 4,000-year-old record, as the latest period. All glaciers in the park today are said to be remnants of this glacial period.

The earliest recorded history of the Glacier Bay area starts with the 1741 Russian expedition of Vitus Bering and Aleksei Chirikov. La Perouse (after whom one of the glaciers in the bay was named subsequently) established contact with the local inhabitants, the Tlingits at Lutya Bay, in 1786, though traditionally the Tlingit lived in the area before the last glacial advance forced them out. This was followed by the Russians staking their claim to the region.

In 1794, Joseph Whidbey, master of the &quot;Discovery&quot; during George Vancouver&#x27;s 1791–95 expedition, reported that his exploration of this part of the coast was blocked by a wall of width and ) thick. Vancouver claimed the land for Britain in conflict with an earlier Russian claim, which was resolved by the Anglo-Russian Convention of 1825. The United States purchased Alaska from the Russians in 1867 with a claim under that treaty of owning all lands up to &quot;the summit of the mountains situated parallel to the coast&quot;. The United States and Canada agreed that an arbitration board would draw the exact boundary. The arbitration award given in 1903 resolved the Alaska boundary dispute by drawing a line that linked the mountain peaks in this area. Because the agreement froze the exact boundary in 1903, further retreat of the glacier does not alter the boundary as the coast extends northward. As a result, the northern edge of Tarr Inlet is approaching the boundary.

With the discovery of gold in the area, gold rush brought miners to the area. In 1890, Willoughby Island in Glacier Bay was the scene of a meeting of the miners, which was followed by the establishment of the Berry mining district. In the 1890s, a salt mine was established at Bartlett Cove. Fox farms and a cannery were also established; however, the cannery was abandoned in 1935.

John Muir, the naturalist, conservationist and scientist, pioneered the focus of the world on the Glacier Bay phenomenon. During his research Muir had witnessed the glaciers in action. He had noted that the ice had retreated almost all the way up. In 1888 (1889 is also mentioned in some references) when John Muir first visited the Bay, this wall was and retreated from the sea by . Now, it stands retreated to , as a remnant of the old wall of the glacier system and has 16 major tidewater glaciers (10, 12 and 15 are also mentioned in some references).

In 1899, wealthy railroad magnate Edward Harriman arranged for a maritime expedition called the Harriman Alaska Expedition to Alaska comprising an elite community of scientists, artists, photographers, and naturalists to explore and document the Alaskan coast. The voyagers, spent two months traveling from Seattle, along the coast of Alaska, to Siberia, and back again. In many ways, the expedition was an intersection of 19th-century science and 20th-century science. The expedition claimed to have discovered some 600 species that were new to science, including 38 new fossil species. They charted the geographic distribution of many species. They discovered an unmapped fiord and named several glaciers. John Muir and his friend Harriman who were members of this expedition were instrumental in governmental lobbying on National Park legislation says. The Harriman expedition was instrumental in documenting the extent of the glacier&#x27;s retreat in 1899.

John Muir was seeking corroboration of the continental glaciation theories of Louis Agassiz, whose controversial &quot;Etudes sur les Glaciers&quot; was published in 1840. The year 1893 recorded the arrival of the first tourist ship at the entrance to the Bay, at Bartlett Cove, which over the years has become central to the tourist trade in the Glacier Bay. By 1916, the Grand Pacific Glacier was at the head of Tarr Inlet, about from Glacier Bay&#x27;s mouth. This is the fastest documented glacial retreat ever. In 1925, Glacier Bay was declared a national monument.

For centuries, the Glacier Bay has been the home land of the Huna Tlingit native tribes of Alaska. Their oral traditions indicate being displaced by the last advance of the glacier. They continue to be part of the Bay residents and it is woven into the &quot;tapestry of their lives&quot;.

==Geography==

Glacier Bay is subsumed within the larger about National Park and Preserve. The preserve, which is a spectacular ensemble of marine and terrestrial life, is delimited by: The Tongass National Forest borders on the east and north east; by the international boundary with Tatshenshini-Alsek Wilderness Provincial Park in British Columbia, Canada on the north; by the waters of Cross Sound and Icy Strait border on the south; and by the Pacific Ocean on the west. When President Calvin Coolidge declared the Glacial Bay to be a national monument, in 1925, the objective clearly stated was:

The Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act of 1980 changed its status to a National Park and Reserve covering an area of including as a preserve: However, have been declared as Wilderness. The Glacier Bay also encompasses about of two mining claim groups, and about allotted to Alaska Natives; some small private tracts are also reported within the limits of the Glacier Bay.

The Glacier Bay Basin is now a myriad combination of tidewater glaciers, snow-capped mountain ranges, ocean coastlines, deep fjords, and freshwater rivers and lakes that provide widely varying land and seascape and &quot;hosts a mosaic of plant communities and a variety of marine and terrestrial wildlife.&quot;

Glacier Bay is covered with of glaciers which accounts for 27% of the Park area with most glaciers originating in mountains with elevation range of . There are over 50 named glaciers (both tidewater and terrestrial glaciers); 10 tide water glaciers – one on the east arm of the bay and all others on the west arm reach shorelines and calved) (literal meaning: &quot;breaking off&quot;) to produce icebergs. Seven of these glaciers are reported to be active tidewater glaciers, which depict the calving phenomenon, which means that they break into icebergs and fall into the sea with thundering noise raising large waves. The McBride Glacier is the only tidewater glacier in the eastern arm at a distance of from Bartlett Cove. Of the other glaciers on the western arm, Johns Hopkins Glacier is at the farthest end – from the entrance to the bay while the Margerie Glacier is about away.

The National Park Service manages a total of of marine waters of the Glacier Bay. It covers a coastline of including some reach of the coast outside the Bay. Glacier Bay Basin as such has a coast line of including all islands; the coast line without counting islands accounts for statute . The deepest point in the bay is below sea level with the diurnal tides occurring every 6 hours, with a tide range of (upper limit of the range is reported to be .

According to the recorded findings, most glaciers are retreating except the Johns Hopkins Glacier, which is advancing and the Margerie Glacier which is stable. The glacier thinning or retreating process is attributed to lesser incidence of snowfall on the hills, raising temperatures in the winter season followed by decrease in cloud cover and precipitation during the summer season.
Post Little Ice Age Rebound in the Glacier Bay Basin has been studied by researchers of the Geophysical Institute, University of Alaska Fairbanks, Alaska in association with National Park and Preserve Service, under a National Science Foundation grant using GPS geodesy combined with studies of raised shorelines and tide gauges. The studies have established that the fastest rates of glacier rebound in the world are now taking place in the Glacier Bay region. The studies have also reported that &quot;these adjustments to LIA loading and unloading are producing significant stresses on the earth&#x27;s crust which can affect seismicity and regional tectonics. The rising land also is continually changing the geomorphic texture of shoreline throughout the Park and causing changes in hydrologic patterns, erosion, and sedimentation. All these changes have a direct impact on the ecosystems of the Park.&quot;

Glacier Bay can be approached only by boats or ships and partly by hiking along three trails () and by kayaking along ) of shore line. The nearest road head and airport are in the small town of Gustavus, which is known as the southern gateway to the Glacier Bay. However, Gustavus as such is approachable only by air and sea. Juneau, the capital of Alaska, is about ). The approximate distance between Anchorage and Juneau is .

The advancing and retreating characteristics of the glaciers in the Glacier Bay are explained in simple terms as a steady state of snow getting converted into ice on the hills. Ice, as a lens of water on the base of bedrock, slides by gravity downwards. The good moraine of rock and rubble insulates it from water erosion. As a result, during freezing temperatures that exists all the year, the glacier advances. When the insulation and erosion effect of the hills gets reduced erosion sets in and along with rising temperatures the glaciers start retreating. Another unpredictable phenomenon that is observed in many glaciers in the Glacier Bay is that of calving. Calving is a process in which blocks of ice get detached or break off from the glacier, irrespective of weather conditions, all the year round, and crash into the sea with thundering noise creating a boiling like turbulence.

The Glacier Bay was closed for ships almost a decade after the 1899 earthquake (magnitude 8.4 on the Richter Scale). This was on account of the shattered ice blocks which filled the Bay consequent to the earthquake. Even though the Bay is in volcanic activity region of the Pacific &quot;Rim of Fire&quot;, active volcanoes have not been recorded within the Glacier Bay Basin. However, these two factors have been inferred to have effects on the environmental changes occurring in the Glacier Bay.

===Archeological findings===
Archaeological findings have been unearthed at two sites in the Glacier Bay, which links the region to Holocene period. On the Baranoff Island, a prehistoric finding dates occupation of the region between 3200 and 4600 BP. Another finding in the form of a house, microlithic tools and heavy wood working tools at Ground Hog Bay has been dated to about 2000 BP. This is stated to be &quot;towards the end of the Hypsithermal (thermal maximum climatic fluctuation) and the beginning of the Little Ice Age&quot;. Thus, it has been interpreted by comparison with similarly placed locations in the region, such as the southern coast of British Columbia, that the type of culture seen here is comparable to the culture that existed during historic times on the Northwest Coast. The potential for finding more such sites are stated to be high.

===Ethnographic aspects===
The Tlingits regard Glacier Bay as their sacred homeland. The National Park Service takes the view that &quot;Glacier Bay National Park is the spiritual homeland of the Huna Tlingit, and Glacier Bay National Preserve is the homeland of the Ghunaaxhoo Kwaan unit of the Yakutat Tlingit Tribe&quot;. The tribes&#x27; oral history supports that they were pushed out and migrated south when the glacier advanced. They moved back to the area when the Glacier retreated in the 1880s. There are 60 odd proto-historic or historic sites in the Glacier Bay, which are identified with Tlingit Indians or European Americans. They are an integral part of Northwest Coast people inferred to be belonging to Haida, Tlingit or Eyak clans. Their settlements existed even in the 1880s in Dry Bay, Excursion Inlet, Point Couverden and the Port Frederick area (now known as Hoonah) and Dundas Bay. A Tlingit cemetery of the period has also been located in the park area. Seasonal hunting, gathering and fishing was their way of life, woven around a central village, with shifting fishing and hunting camps. The food source of the natives was the rich Salmon fish resources of the area. A complex society evolved with rich artistic traditions. Tlingits claimed their fishing-dependent lifestyle was helped during the National Monument years, which kept out commercial fishing. After the area became a National Park, their fishing and hunting activities were curtailed except for certain religious exemptions. However, the National Park administration is closely interacting with the Tlingits to foster their cultural heritage. They are allowed access to the park to &quot;harvest berries, a variety of seafoods, and traditional use items such as spruce roots and mountain goat hair (for weaving traditional blankets)&quot;. In addition the park is planning to establish a Tlingit longhouse near its main office, where Tlingit culture would be fully highlighted and also facilitate holding of cultural events.

===Climate===
The bay has a cool wet, coastal temperate rainforest climate. Three climatic zones have been discerned in the Glacier Bay; the outer coast along the Gulf of Alaska, which records mild temperatures and higher precipitation. However, it experiences less snowfall, the upper Glacier Bay where it is much colder and heavy snowfall occurs, and the lower Glacier Bay, which experiences heavy rainfall throughout the year.

In the Bay as a whole, the summer temperatures vary between ) and , while the winter temperatures lie in the range of , with minimum going up to .

Annual precipitation is in the form of rainfall and snowfall. On an average, 228 days are recorded as precipitation days per year, and precipitation is in the range of including of annual snowfall; the highest recorded snowfall is of the order of in the Fairweather Mountains.

==Flora and fauna==

The environment of Glacier Bay has been categorized under four main land ecosystems namely, the wet tundra, the coastal western hemlock/Sitka spruce forest, the alpine tundra, and the glaciers and ice fields; within the Bay proper, further break up into three major marine ecosystems are marked namely, &quot;within in and around continental shelf, wave-beaten coasts, and fjord estuaries.&quot;

Plants progressively moved in as the glacier retreated, so a 200-year-old spruce and hemlock forest presently exists at the entrance, grading up to more primitive plants such as mosses and lichens at the head of the bay. Because of current local climate change some glaciers are now retreating at a rate of up to a quarter of a mile per year.

The retreat of the glaciers exposed land areas and as a result &quot;Plant communities and animal populations ranging from &quot;pioneer species&quot; in areas recently exposed by receding glaciers to climax communities in older coastal and alpine ecosystems&quot; have emerged.

;Wild life
In general, wild life in Glacier Bay, has been identified under aqua fauna, avifauna and fauna; 160 marine and estuarine fish species, 242 bird species and 41 species of mammals have been recorded.

;Bears

Bears, both black and brown, are seen in Glacier Bay in the intertidal zone which they frequent for foraging. They are also seen &quot;scraping barnacles off of rocks and munching mussels.&quot; Invariably they are spotted wandering alone along the beaches of the Glacier Bay in search of salmon. The habitats of the black bears are generally the southern forested areas of the bay. However, the brown bears are mostly found in the northern, more recently glaciated zones of the Glacier Bay. Occasionally, black bears are sighted near the glaciers or near Gustavus town. Black bears with black dots and brown bears with brown dots have been seen over the last 10 years. Their travel routes have been identified as along the easy tracks such as along beaches, stream beds and river valleys. The most commonly identified locations for sighting bears in the Glacier Bay are: The Bartlett Cove, the Bartlett River, the Beardslee Islands and North and South Sandy Cove locations for black bears, while brown bears are seen to the north of Tidal Inlet in the west arm of glacier and north of Adams Inlet in the east arm. They are also seen swimming in the Bay, crossing from one bank to the other. Salmon are their favorite food, apart from bumblebees, sand fleas, bird eggs, birds, voles and marine mammal carcasses.

;Whale

Humpback whales have been sighted in the lower region of Glacier Bay; also in Sitakaday Narrows, Whidbey Passage and the waters around South Marble Island. For kayakers, Hugh Miller Inlet and the Beardslee Islands are good locations to see humpback whales from a safe distance of about a quarter mile. Other marine whales sighted are grey, minke, fin, and killer whales (orcas).

;Seals and porpoise
Harbor seals, northern fur seals, sea otters, harbor porpoises, Dall&#x27;s porpoises and Steller sea lions are also seen in Glacier Bay.

;Other fauna
Land mammals sighted in Glacier Bay are: blue bears (glacier), moose, Sitka black-tailed deer, mountain goat, wolf, coyote, lynx, wolverine, marmots, land and river otters, weasels, ermine, mink, squirrels, beaver and red fox. Porcupines, voles, shrews, hares, and bats are also found.

;Avifauna

200 species of birds have been recorded in the Bay. These include: the bald eagle, golden eagle, raven, northern hawk owl, sandhill crane, loon, Steller&#x27;s jay, murre, cormorant, puffin, murrelet, oystercatchers, herons, geese, ducks, ptarmigan, crow, osprey, blue grouse, woodpecker, pigeon guillemot, sparrow, sandpiper, plover, Arctic tern, kittiwake and gulls.

;Fish
Fish species found in the bay are: Chinook, chum, sockeye, pink and coho salmon, halibut, trout, steelhead, Dolly Varden, lingcod, whitefish, blackfish, char and herring. As for shellfish, there are Dungeness crabs, scallops, shrimp and clams. Salmon are very important food of bears, particularly in the late summer and fall. In the southern part of the bay, there are streams which abound in salmon. They are also seen colonizing in the northern bay, consequent to the retreat of many glaciers and the streams emerging. These salmon food sources are expected to support more bear populations in the years ahead.

;Vegetation
Plant recolonization and succession has occurred in Glacier Bay as a result of the retreat of the glacier bay in the last about 300 years. The succession, which occurred in the new wilderness of Glacier Bay, started on the raw landscape. The Park is now home to the longest running successional study in the world, started in 1916 by William S. Cooper. A simile given is that &quot;It was like seeing an owl with no feathers&quot;. A vegetative wilderness has been created, which has resulted in the coastal forest. 333 Vascular plant species of individual taxa have been recorded in the Glacier Bay. Dense thickets of Sitka alder and devil&#x27;s club abound along the shoreline.

==Landmarks==

There are 50 odd glaciers identified in the Glacier Bay, which are both terrestrial and tidewater type. Some of the major inlets, glaciers and the mountains in the order of their location from the entry have been identified from the National Park Service Map. At the entry to the Bay there are (as read from the map): The small Gustavus town and then the Visitor Center of the National Park Service and the Glacier Bay Lodge followed by several islands within the main channel. On the western side of the channel, the first inlet is the Muir Inlet which has several inlets and glaciers such as Adam&#x27;s Inlet, Casement Glacier, McBride Glacier, Riggs Glacier, Muir Glacier followed by the Wachusett Inlet. Coming out of the Muir inlet and entering and cruising toward the north along the main Bay, on the west shore are the Gelkie Inlet, Reid Glacier and Lamplugh Glacier fed by Brady Ice field and Brady Glacier, followed by Johns Hopkins Glacier, Margerie Glacier and the Great Pacific Glacier at the head of the Bay. The east shore line has the Queen Inlet with its Carroll Glacier, and the Rendu Inlet with its Rendu Glacier. The Fairweather Range of hills which feeds the Johns Hopkins and Margerie Glaciers form the western boundary of the Glacier Bay and the highest mountains seen here are the Mt. Fairweather (), Mt. Quincy Adams (), Mt. Salisbury (), Mt. Crillon (), Mt. Bertha (), Mt. Abbe () and Mt. Cooper (). The major island, opposite to the Johns Hopkins Inlet, is the Russel Island in the midst of the main channel.

===Muir Glacier===
The Muir Glacier was named after John Muir, the naturalist, who identified it in 1889. The Muir Glacier was once a tide water glacier with a width of , a length of , and a height of . It has now turned into terrestrial glacier; it has receded and does not flow into the sea. Its retreat has been very rapid and well-documented since its Little Ice Age maximum position at the mouth of Glacier Bay around 1780. During its retreating stage which began in 1889, calving was intense. The flow was at the rate of about per year or about per day until 1979 and as a result the glacier became terrestrial by 1993. The flow was reported to be per day between 1999 and 2001. The glacier is now only in width, in height, and extends for . Morse Glacier is its tributary and is also retreating faster than the Muir. Further, during this process of retreat, glacial till left behind two large deltas extending to a width of about at the water edge during low tide.

===Reid Glacier===
The Reid Glacier was named by the members of the Harriman Alaska Expedition for Harry Fielding Reid (1859–1944), professor of geology at Johns Hopkins University, who was well known for his studies of glacier flow and stratification in Alaska and the Alps. The glacier has its origin in Brady Icefield and has a flow rate of per day. At the water edge, its width is , rises to a height of and stretches to a length of and flows into Bigourdan Fjord. In view of fast rate of retreat, this glacier has turned from tide water to terrestrial glacier, particularly on its eastern and western one third widths. Sediment deposits from the glacier have gradually filled the eastern and western margins at its inlet, as seen during low tides. The central one third of the glacier, however, touches water edge with a recorded depth of of water, during high tide. The walls of the fjord of the glacier, however, also show marks of lateral deposits of the glaciers right up to rock faces.

===Lamplugh Glacier===
The Lamplugh Glacier was named by Lawrence Martin of the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) around 1912 for the English geologist George William Lamplugh (1859–1926), who visited the Glacier Bay in 1884. The Glacier originates in the Brady Icefield to the east of Fairweather Range. The glacier has a width of about at the water face. Its rises to height of with depth of at the waterline. It stretches to over . The ice flow rate from the glacier is estimated at per year and is noted to be receding in the central and eastern part of the ice face due to calving; the western part is, however, seen mostly grounded except during the high tide range. In the central part, a subglacial stream has developed which is seen to shift its position laterally. This phenomenon is attributed to the deposition of fluvial sediment in the embayment. It forms a delta, as observed during low tide. It also results in water turning from brown to tan milky.

===Johns Hopkins Inlet===

The Johns Hopkins Inlet is a stunning long fjord, which has several tide water glaciers. The Lamplugh Glacier is about away from the inlet and further inside is the Johns Hopkins Glacier, which is now the largest tidewater glacier in Glacier Bay and adjacent to it is the Gilman Glacier followed by the Hoonah Glacier further up. All these glaciers are tidewater glaciers. Ice blocks float in the inlet and it is quite hazardous for boating or kayaking; both activities have to be done with great caution. Johns Hopkins Inlet is closed to boats in May and June in order to protect unweaned harbor seal pups.

===Johns Hopkins Glacier===

The Johns Hopkins Glacier rises from the Fairweather Range on the east slopes of Lituya Mountain and Mount Salisbury and has an easterly flow towards the head of Johns Hopkins Inlet, southwest of the terminus of Clark Glacier and northwest of Hoonah. Its rock, ice and snow depict a variety of impressive colors such as grey, blue and white. It was named in 1893 by H.F. Reid after the Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland, which sponsored an expedition to this glacier. It is the only advancing tidewater glacier now (its advance started in 1924 when Grand Pacific Glacier started receding towards Tarr Inlet) and is combined with Gilman Glacier (first got attached to Hopkins in the 1990s, broke off and rejoined several times and once again it appears joined since 2000); both are advancing as one single ice block, and at the waterfront, has a width of with a depth of , rises to a height of and stretches to about upstream. Submarine calving has also been recorded.

The Johns Hopkins Glacier, for example, cannot be approached any nearer than about by sea because of the volume of the ice blocks that break loose from its cliffs. Most visitors to the park come by cruise ship and thus view the glaciers from the water.
===Gilman Glacier===

Gilman Glacier got attached to Johns Hopkins Glacier sometime in 1990. In the following decade, the two glaciers merged and de-merged several times. However, in 2000 it was again attached to Johns Hopkins glacier and the two together are stated to be advancing along the steep ice face.

===Tarr Inlet===
The Tarr Inlet at the head of the Glacier Bay is a scene of ice and snow, and &quot;sits cater-corner to Johns Hopkins Inlet&quot;. This inlet provides excellent views of the Grand Pacific Glacier to its north and the Margerie Glacier to its west. The west shore line of this inlet is steep and rocky, extends to up to a small stream where a beach has been formed. A further along the channel, a glacier knob is seen in the center of the west shore of the inlet. A cove formation here provides for good camping grounds, where strong winds and ice flows are experienced. This location also provides a panoramic view of the Tarr Inlet. Two miles north of this location is the Margerie Glacier. Grand Pacific Glacier is located to the east side of the Margerie Glacier at the head of the Tarr Inlet where extensive gravel outwash is seen. From Grand Pacific, the Tarr Inlet continues for with steep gravel shore line interspersed with minor streams separated by gravel outwash.

===Margerie Glacier===
The Margerie Glacier is a long tide water glacier that begins on the south slope of Mount Root, at the Alaska-Canada border in the Fairweather Range (elevation above ), and flows southeast and northeast to Tarr Inlet, north of the terminus of Grand Pacific Glacier and northwest of Hoonah. It was named for famed French geographer and geologist Emmanuel de Margerie (1862–1953), who visited Glacier Bay in 1913. Located at the deep end of the Glacier Bay, Margerie Glacier extends over a width of about and extends upstream for a length of till its source on the southern slopes of the hill of Mount Root, at the Alaska-Canada border. Mount Root (elevation ), named Boundary Peak 165, is a mountain in Alaska and British Columbia, is part of the Fairweather Range of the Saint Elias Mountains.

===Grand Pacific Glacier===

The Grand Pacific Glacier, at the head of the Tarr Inlet on the north, has a streaked face covered with gravel and stones (more than ) thick in many areas). Landslides and medial moraines cover much of eastern side of the glacier extending to about two-thirds width of the ice face. It is not an active glacier. In the earlier 18th century, it was a one single block of ice at the Gulf of Alaska, when Captain Vancouver first saw it, which has receded to the present location that is ) from the Glacier Bay inlet. At the present site, Grand Pacific Glacier has a width of ) with a water depth of ) and with an average height of ) and stretches to ). It calves into the Tarr Inlet and its western two thirds part is formed by the tributary Ferris Glacier. Its flow rate is reported to be about ) per year or about ) per day. However, the eastern part of the Glacier is reportedly moving at the rate of about ) per year. Margerie Glacier had merged with this glacier in 1992. As the glacier started receding it got demerged from Margerie and only a small stream separates the two glaciers now.

===Fairweather Range===
The Fairweather Range is the unofficial name for a mountain range located in the U.S. state of Alaska and the Canadian province of British Columbia. It is the southernmost range of the Saint Elias Mountains. The northernmost section of the range is situated in Tatshenshini-Alsek Provincial Park while the southernmost section resides in Glacier Bay National Park in the Hoonah-Angoon Census Area. In between, it goes through the southeastern corner of Yakutat Borough. Peaks of this range include Mount Fairweather, the highest point in British Columbia and Mount Quincy Adams .

Between the bay and the coast, snow-clad peaks of the Fairweather Range capture the moisture coming in off the Gulf of Alaska and, in turn, spawn the park&#x27;s largest glaciers. Mt. Fairweather is the tallest peak in the Fairweather Range and is very much unlike its name as it has a very harsh terrain.

;Mt. Fairweather
The Mt. Fairweather (officially gazetted as Fairweather Mountain in Canada but referred to as Mount Fairweather), is located east of the Pacific Ocean in the Glacier Bay region. While most of the mountain lies within the City and Borough of Yakutat, the summit is also in Tatshenshini-Alsek Provincial Park, British Columbia (Canada), making it the highest point in that province. It is also designated as Boundary Peak 164 or as &quot;US/Canada Boundary Point #164&quot;. The mountain was named on May 3, 1778, by Captain James Cook, apparently for the unusually good weather encountered at the time. The name has been variously translated. It was called &quot;Mt. Beautemps&quot; by La Perouse (1786, atlas), &quot;Mte. Buen-tiempo&quot; by Galiano (1802, map 3), &quot;Gor[a]-Khoroshy-pogody&quot; on Russian Hydrographic Service Chart 1378 in 1847, and &quot;G[ora] Fayerveder&quot; by Captain Tebenkov (1852, map 7), Imperial Russian Navy. It was called &quot;Schonwetterberg&quot; by Constantin Grewink in 1850 and &quot;Schonwetter Berg&quot; by Justus Perthes in 1882. Mt. Fairweather was first climbed in 1931 by Allen Carpé and Terris Moore.

<text>Robson Golightly Green (born 18 December 1964) is an English actor, singer-songwriter, and television presenter.

His first major TV role was as hospital porter Jimmy Powell in BBC drama series &quot;Casualty&quot; in 1989. He then went on to portray Fusilier Dave Tucker in the ITV military drama series &quot;Soldier Soldier&quot;, between 1991 and 1995. In 1997 he played a young doctor, ‘Owen Springer’, who is having an affair with the wife (Francesca Annis) of his adulterous surgeon boss (Michael Kitchen) in the TV series “Reckless”. Between 2002 and 2008 he played Dr. Tony Hill in the ITV crime drama series &quot;Wire in the Blood&quot;.

As a TV presenter he has fronted shows such as &quot;Extreme Fishing&quot;, &quot;Extreme Fishing Challenge&quot;, and &quot;Tales from Northumberland&quot;. He currently plays Detective Inspector Geordie Keating on ITV&#x27;s &quot;Grantchester&quot;. He was one half of the singing duo Robson &amp; Jerome, along with fellow &quot;Soldier Soldier&quot; actor Jerome Flynn, who had several No. 1 singles in the 1990s.

== Early life ==
Robson Golightly Green was born on 18 December 1964 in Dilston Hospital in Hexham, Northumberland, and grew up in Dudley, a small mining village south of Cramlington. His father, also named Robson Green, was a miner, and his mother Anne was a cleaner and shopkeeper. He was named in the Northeast tradition of naming the first son after family surnames: Robson was his paternal grandmother&#x27;s maiden name, while his middle name, Golightly, is the surname of his maternal grandmother, Cissie Golightly, daughter of William Golightly, a miner and well-known trade union leader in the 1920s.

Green attended Dudley Middle Comprehensive School. After being inspired by jets flying overhead, he decided he wanted to join the Royal Air Force, and at the age of 16, he joined the Air Training Corps, though he decided against a career in the RAF after two weeks at an officer training camp. He also learned to play the guitar, later forming his first band, Solid State, in 1982. He also spent one night a week at the Backworth Drama Centre, and appeared in a series of productions at both school and Backworth.

Green left school aged 16 with five O-levels, and joined Swan Hunter&#x27;s shipyard as a draughtsman. On one occasion, he also tried his hand at professional boxing. He attended three boxing training sessions for the play &quot;Francie Nichol&quot;, in which he played a boxer. After two years at Swan&#x27;s, Green decided on a career in acting. After auditioning, he began training with Live Theatre under the tutelage of artistic director Max Roberts, his previous director at Backworth. During training he continued his musical career as a member of a successful local band, the Workie Tickets.

== Career ==

Growing up in Tyneside, Green was chosen to be the lead in a film made by Amber Films that narrated the contemporaneous social problems faced by working-class people in Thatcher&#x27;s Britain. Each episode examined one aspect of living in a harsh and embittered environment. The soap opera gave Green his big break in film. It was quickly followed by offers of work. Green first made his name as an actor in the BBC series &quot;Casualty&quot; but, after three series, moved to national prominence as fusilier Dave Tucker in the drama series &quot;Soldier Soldier&quot;.

In 1995, one episode called for Green and co-star Jerome Flynn to sing &quot;Unchained Melody&quot;. Subsequently, ITV was inundated by people wanting to buy the song and the pair were persuaded by Simon Cowell to release it as a single – a double A-side with &quot;White Cliffs of Dover&quot;. It stayed at No. 1 for seven weeks in the UK Singles Chart, selling more than 1.8 million copies and making it the best-selling single of the year and winning the duo the Music Week Awards in 1996 for best single and best album. Subsequently, they had two further No. 1 singles and two No. 1 albums, all remakes of standards.

The song gave Green the opportunity to sign a long-term deal with ITV to star in several of the network&#x27;s dramas, including &quot;Touching Evil&quot;, &quot;Grafters&quot; and &quot;Reckless&quot;. In 1996, he set up an independent production company, Coastal Productions, with business partner Sandra Jobling to give youngsters from the North East the opportunities he struggled for. The company has since produced or co-produced most of Green&#x27;s television work, as well as local productions at the Theatre Royal in Newcastle upon Tyne. In 2002, Green starred as clinical psychologist Dr. Tony Hill in the crime drama &quot;Wire in the Blood&quot;.

Green&#x27;s production company has brought at least four new dramas to the small screen in recent years, including the massive ratings hit &quot;Christmas Lights&quot;. The success of this one-off drama led to a series being commissioned under the name &quot;Northern Lights&quot;, which was followed by a sequel called &quot;City Lights&quot;. Coastal also produces drama series, including &quot;Hereafter&quot; starring Stephen Tompkinson and Dervla Kirwan.

In 1995, Green won the Smash Hits Poll Winner&#x27;s Party award for Favourite TV Actor. In 1997, Green starred in the TV film, &quot;The Student Prince&quot; which is no relation to either the Romberg operetta or the 1954 MGM film.

In July 1998, Green received an honorary degree from the University of Northumbria and, in September 2006, he was voted by the UK general public at No. 35 in a poll of TV&#x27;s greatest stars.

In 2000, Green starred with James Bolam, Susan Jameson, Kerry Ann Christiansen and Jamie Bell in the ITV drama &quot;Close and True&quot;. In 2001, he starred in the six-part ITV drama &quot;Take Me&quot;.

In 2002, Green starred with Caroline Goodall in the TV movie &quot;Me and Mrs. Jones&quot;. In December 2002, he released his first solo album, &quot;Moment in Time&quot;, which was composed of cover versions (including the song &quot;Me and Mrs. Jones&quot;). However, unlike his releases with Jerome Flynn, the album was a commercial failure, peaking at No. 49 in the UK.

In 2003, Green starred in the ITV mini-series &quot;Unconditional Love&quot; and in the BBC television series &quot;Trust&quot;. In 2005, he starred in two series, &quot;Like Father Like Son&quot;, and &quot;Rocket Man&quot; in which he played a widower trying to build a rocket to send his dead wife&#x27;s ashes into space.

Green presents his own series &quot;Extreme Fishing with Robson Green&quot; and the spin-off &quot;Robson&#x27;s Extreme Fishing Challenge&quot;, where he travels over the world investigating and participating in the sport, coining fishing catchphrases such as &quot;get in&quot; and &quot;we&#x27;re in&quot;. During 2009, while promoting the second series on &quot;BBC Breakfast,&quot; Green claimed that 90% of all coarse fish caught by anglers die. This rapidly caused an angry response from coarse fishing anglers in the UK who believed this comment to be unsubstantiated and potentially damaging to the sport.

In December 2009, ITV presented the documentary &quot;Robson Green&#x27;s Wild Swimming Adventure&quot;, a tour of swimming locales around the UK.

In 2010 Green had a major role in the television film &quot;Joe Maddison&#x27;s War&quot;. Directed by Patrick Collerton, it presented a view of World War II through the eyes of shipyard workers and World War I veterans who served in the Home Guard during the Blitz.

In July 2010, Green began filming the seventh series of BBC drama &quot;Waterloo Road&quot; appearing from May 2011 to July 2011.

In 2011, Green starred in the third series of the BBC Three show &quot;Being Human&quot; in which he played a werewolf named McNair.

In 2013 and 2015, Green starred in the fourth and fifth series of the war-drama series &quot;Strike Back&quot;, as Lt Colonel Philippe Locke, a former SAS operative.

In October 2013, Green began presenting &quot;Tales from Northumberland with Robson Green&quot; on ITV, a factual series about his home county of Northumberland. A second series began airing in February 2015 and a third in February 2016.

Since 2014, he has portrayed Geordie Keating in the ITV drama series &quot;Grantchester&quot;, starring alongside James Norton and later Tom Brittney. A second series began in March 2016 and a third in April 2017.

In March 2016, during an appearance on &quot;The One Show&quot;, Green confirmed he would present a new series for ITV called &quot;Tales from the Coast with Robson Green&quot;, which began airing in January 2017. In April 2016, he presented a one-off documentary &quot;The Flying Scotsman with Robson Green&quot;. He also presented a one-off documentary &quot;Robson Crusoe: A Surprising Adventure&quot; and a six-part series called &quot;Robson Green&#x27;s Coastal Lives&quot;, both for ITV.

In 2020, Green began recording &quot;Hadrian&#x27;s Wall with Robson Green&quot; a 3-part documentary following him walking the 80 miles from Wallsend west to Bowness. The series was commissioned by &quot;Channel 5&quot; and made by &quot;Firecracker Films&quot;.

It is being rumoured as of 2022 that Green alongside Mark Benton will be reuniting as Colin and Howie for another series of &quot;Northern Lights&quot;.

==Politics==
Green is a supporter of higher taxes on the wealthy and protecting the NHS, saying &quot;Anybody who tells me they’re not going to pay tax… we’ve got an NHS system on its knees… I tell you what, my son was in real trouble when he was young and we took him to the hospital, there were four specialists waiting for him. That’s why you pay your taxes. We’ve got a police system who protect us, we’ve got firemen who put out fires. We’ve got defence, man. That’s what tax is for.&quot; He then went on to claim &quot;I’m proud to be a 50 per cent tax-payer&quot;. He has also been an outspoken critic of Jimmy Carr for using a tax avoidance scheme in 2012. He said of Carr, &quot;Wanker. I mean, just wanker. No, he’s not getting away with it for me&quot;.

== Personal life ==
Green is a life-long Newcastle United fan.

Green was introduced to occupational therapist Alison Ogilvie by his close friend, television director Andrew Gunn. Green and Ogilvie married on 22 June 1991, but separated eight years later. Green met his second wife, former Page 3 model Vanya Seager, while recording &quot;Unchained Melody&quot; at BMG Records in 1995. They later had a son, Taylor Seager-Green (born 2000). In 2001, the couple married at Cliveden House in Buckinghamshire after a family celebration in Mauritius. On 30 October 2011, the couple issued a statement saying that their marriage had &quot;irretrievably broken down&quot; and that they were separating. In April 2016 it was reported that Green was involved in an affair causing the break-down of a marriage between a vicar and his wife.

<text>Lon Tomohisa Horiuchi (born June 9, 1954) is an American former Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Hostage Rescue Team (HRT) sniper and former United States Army officer who was involved in the 1992 Ruby Ridge standoff and 1993 Waco siege. In 1997, Horiuchi was charged with manslaughter for killing Vicki Weaver at Ruby Ridge; the charges were later dropped due to Constitutional supremacy, granting federal officers immunity from actions taken in the scope of their practice.

==Early life and education==
Horiuchi was born in Hawaii on June 9, 1954 as the son of a U.S. Army officer. He later attended the United States Military Academy at West Point and graduated in 1976. He served as an infantry officer in the U.S. Army and subsequently joined the FBI.

==Ruby Ridge==

In 1992, while working at sniper position &quot;Sierra 4&quot; for the FBI Hostage Rescue Team at Ruby Ridge, Horiuchi fired two shots at armed targets, first at Randy Weaver, then Weaver&#x27;s friend Kevin Harrisbut this second shot killed the unarmed Vicki Weaver, Randy&#x27;s wife.

After his first shot hit and wounded Randy Weaver, Horiuchi fired a second shot at Harris as he retreated into a cabin. This shot wounded Harris and killed Vicki Weaver, who was standing in the doorway holding her 10-month-old child.

Following the conclusion of the trial of Randy Weaver and Kevin Harris in 1993, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) created a &quot;Ruby Ridge Task Force&quot; to investigate allegations made by Weaver&#x27;s defense attorney Gerry Spence. On June 10, 1994, the Task Force delivered its 542-page report to the DOJ Office of Professional Responsibility. The Report stated: &quot;With regard to the two shots fired on August 22, we concluded that the first shot met the standard of &#x27;objective reasonableness&#x27; the Constitution requires for the legal use of deadly force but that the second shot did not satisfy that standard.&quot;

In 1995, the surviving members of the Weaver family received million (equivalent to $ million in ) to settle their civil suit brought against the U.S. government for wrongful deaths of Vicki Weaver and 14-year-old Samuel Weaver, who was killed the day before during an encounter with U.S. Marshals. In the out-of-court settlement, the government did not admit any wrongdoing. In a separate suit, settled by the U.S. government in 2000, Harris received $380,000 (equivalent to $650,000 in ).

===Manslaughter charge===

In 1997, Boundary County, Idaho Prosecutor Denise Woodbury, with the help of special prosecutor Stephen Yagman, charged Horiuchi in state court with involuntary manslaughter over his killing of Vicki Weaver. The U.S. Attorney filed a notice of removal of the case to federal court, which automatically took effect under the statute for removal jurisdiction where the case was dismissed by U.S. District Judge Edward Lodge on May 14, 1998, who cited the supremacy clause of the Constitution which grants immunity to federal officers acting in the scope of their employment.

The decision to dismiss the charges was reversed by an &quot;en banc&quot; panel of the Ninth Circuit, which held that enough uncertainty about the facts of the case existed for Horiuchi to stand trial on state manslaughter charges. Ultimately, the then-sitting Boundary County prosecutor, Brett Benson, who had defeated Woodbury in the 2000 election, decided to drop the charges, because he felt it was unlikely the state could prove the case and too much time had passed. Yagman, the special prosecutor, responded that he &quot;could not disagree more with this decision&quot; than he did.

The Ninth Circuit granted Boundary County&#x27;s motion to dismiss the case against Horiuchi on September 14, 2001.

==Waco==
On September 13, 1993, Charles Riley, a fellow FBI sniper deployed with Horiuchi during the Waco Siege, claimed that he had heard Horiuchi shooting from sniper position number one (Sierra One), an FBI-held house in front of the compound holding eight snipers, on April 19, 1993. Riley later retracted his statement, saying that he had been misquoted, and that he had only heard snipers &quot;at&quot; Sierra One announce that shots had been fired &quot;by&quot; Branch Davidians. Riley later clarified that he had heard a radio report from Sierra One that someone at that position had witnessed gunfire from within the compound.

The Committee on Government reform notes that &quot;There is no evidence that HRT snipers stationed at a house (designated the Sierra One sniper position) across the Double EE Ranch Road from the compound fired shots on April 19, 1993.&quot;

Three of the twelve expended .308 caliber casings that the Texas Rangers reported finding in the house were at Horiuchi&#x27;s position. However, officials maintained that they were left behind from the earlier use of the house by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives snipers on February 28, 1993. The recovered casings at the house were tested and identified by the Texas Rangers and the Office of Special Counsel, matching them to weapons used by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms on February 28, 1993 and not those used by the FBI.

For the five months following the Waco inferno, Timothy McVeigh worked at gun shows and handed out free cards printed with Horiuchi&#x27;s name and address, &quot;in the hope that somebody in the Patriot movement would assassinate the sharpshooter&quot;. He wrote hate mail to the sniper, suggesting that &quot;what goes around, comes around&quot;. McVeigh considered targeting Horiuchi, or a member of his family, before settling on the Oklahoma City bombing.

==Later life==
Horiuchi retired from the FBI in October 2006, with the job title of FBI Program Manager and COTR.

<text>Loyset Compère ( – 16 August 1518) was a Franco-Flemish composer of the Renaissance. Of the same generation as Josquin des Prez, he was one of the most significant composers of motets and chansons of that era, and one of the first musicians to bring the light Italianate Renaissance style to France.

==Life==

His exact place of birth is not known, but documents of the time assign him to a family from the province of Artois (in modern France), and suggest he may have been born in Hainaut (in modern Belgium). At least one source from Milan indicates he described himself as coming from Arras, also in Artois. Both the date and probable place of birth are extremely close to those of Josquin des Prez; indeed the area around the current French-Belgian border produced an astonishing number of excellent composers in the 15th and 16th centuries, composers whose fame spread throughout Europe. Often these composers are known as the Franco-Flemish or Netherlandish School).

In the 1470s Compère worked as a singer in Milan at the chapel of Duke Galeazzo Maria Sforza, during the time that composers such as Johannes Martini and Gaspar van Weerbeke were also singing there. The chapel choir in the early 1470s grew into one of the largest and most famous singing ensembles in Europe. After the murder of the duke in 1476, Compère appears to have been &quot;laid off&quot; from the chapel, and he may have returned to France at this time. Sometime during the next ten years he began to work at the French court, and he accompanied Charles VIII on his invasion of Italy in 1494 (in what capacity is not known). He was in Rome in early 1495 during the occupation of the city by Charles and his army.

Next he had a series of church positions. By 1498 Compère was at Cambrai, and from 1500 to around 1504 he was at Douai; his final appointment was at the collegiate church of Saint-Quentin. Throughout this time he seems to have been in part-time service to the French court, as evidenced by his many compositions for official and ceremonial occasions. He died at Saint-Quentin.

==Works==

Unlike his contemporaries, Compère seems to have written few masses (at least very few survive). By temperament he seems to have been a miniaturist, and his most popular and numerous works were in the shorter forms of the day—primarily chansons and motets. Two stylistic trends are evident in his music: the style of the Burgundian School, which he seems to have learned in his early career before coming to Italy, and the lighter style of the Italian composers current at the time, who were writing frottolas (the light and popular predecessor to the madrigal). Compère had a gift for melody, and many of his chansons became popular; later composers used several as cantus firmi for masses. Occasionally he seems to have given himself a formidable technical challenge and set out to solve it, such as writing quodlibets (an example is &quot;Au travail suis&quot;, which combines no less than six different tunes written to the same text by different composers).

Compère wrote several works in a unique form, sometimes called a free motet, which combines some of the light elegance of the Italian popular song of the time with the contrapuntal technique of the Netherlanders. Some mix texts from different sources, for instance a rather paradoxical &quot;Sile fragor&quot; which combines a supplication to the Virgin Mary with a drinking song dedicated to Bacchus. His choice of secular texts tended towards the irreverent and suggestive.

His chansons are his most characteristic compositions, and many scholars of Renaissance music consider them to be his best work. They are for three or four voices, and are in three general categories: Italianate, light works for four a cappella voices, very much like frottolas, with text set syllabically and often homophonically, and having frequent cadences; three-voice works in the Burgundian style, rather like the music of Dufay; and three-voice motet-chansons, which resemble the medieval motet more than anything else. In these works the lowest voice usually sings a slow-moving cantus firmus with a Latin text, usually from chant, while the upper voices sing more animated parts, in French, on a secular text.

Many of Compère&#x27;s compositions were printed by Ottaviano Petrucci in Venice, and disseminated widely; obviously their availability contributed to their popularity. Compère was one of the first composers to benefit from the new technology of printing, which had a profound impact on the spread of the Franco-Flemish musical style throughout Europe.

Compère also wrote several settings of the Magnificat (the hymn of praise to the Virgin Mary, from the first chapter of the Gospel of Luke), as well as numerous short motets.

==Works list==

===Masses and mass fragments===

# Missa alles regretz;
# Missa de tous bien plaine; based on the chanson by Hayne van Ghizeghem. The partial manuscript was lost in Berlin during WWII and rediscovered in the early 1990s in Kraków. This allowed identification of sources of the complete mass in medieval copies found in choirbooks in Cividale and Dresden.

<text>Robert Erickson (March 7, 1917 – April 24, 1997) was an American modernist composer and influential music teacher. He was one of the first American composers to explore the twelve tone technique and to compose tape music.

==Education==
Erickson was born in Marquette, Michigan. He learned both piano and violin as a child, and studied composition with Ernst Krenek at Hamline University in Saint Paul, Minnesota, graduating in 1943. He returned to Hamline after three years in the US Army, and earned a Master of Arts in music in 1947.

==Career==
===Teaching===
He taught at the College of St. Catherine in Saint Paul, Minnesota, San Francisco State College, the University of California, Berkeley, and chaired the composition department of the San Francisco Conservatory from 1957 to 1966. With composer Will Ogdon, he founded the music department at the University of California, San Diego (UCSD) in 1967: &quot;We decided we wanted a department where composers could feel at home, the way scholars feel at home in other schools.&quot; While there he met faculty performers such as bassist Bertram Turetzky, trumpeter Edwin Harkins, flutist Bernhard Batschelet, and singer Carol Plantamura: &quot;I could go to Bert, or Ed, with something I&#x27;d written down and ask &#x27;Hey, can you do this?&#x27; And I&#x27;d get an immediate answer. It was a fabulous time for cross-feeding.&quot; 

His notable students are Morton Subotnick, Pauline Oliveros, Terry Riley, Louise Spizizen, Ramón Sender, Loren Rush, Betty Ann Wong, Terry Jennings, Allen Strange, and Paul Dresher. Many of these composers became interested in improvisation under Erickson’s influence. 

Oliveros, among others, praises his teaching:
===As a composer===
Erickson was one of the first American composers to compose twelve tone system music (&quot;I had already studied—and abandoned—the twelve tone system before most other Americans had taken it up.&quot;) and to create tape music: &quot;If you get right down to the bottom of what composers do, I think that what composers do now and have always done is to compose their environment in some sense. So I get a special little lift about working with environmental sounds.&quot; He also has used invented instruments such as stroking rods, used in &quot;Taffy Time&quot;, &quot;Cardinitas 68&quot;, and &quot;Roddy&quot;, tube drums, used in &quot;Cradle&quot;, &quot;Cradle II&quot;, and &quot;Tube Drum Studies&quot;, and the Percussion Loops Console designed with Ron George, used in &quot;Percussion Loops&quot;.

Many University of California San Diego faculty performers appear on his 1991 CRI release &quot;Robert Erickson: Sierra &amp; Other Works&quot; (CD 616), playing works written for and with them:
#&quot;Kryl&quot; (1977), Harkins, named after the travelling cornet player Bohumir Kryl. The piece from time to time creates a hocket between the singing and playing.
#&quot;Ricercar À 3&quot; (1967), Turetzky. For bass soloist live and on two tape tracks.
#&quot;Postcards&quot; (1981), Carol Plantamura and lutenist Jürgen Hübscher
#&quot;Dunbar&#x27;s Delight&quot; (1985), timpanist Dan Dunbar. Virtuoso solo piece for timpani.
#&quot;Quoq&quot; (1978), flutist John Fonville. Named after &quot;Finnegans Wake&quot;.
#&quot;Sierra&quot; (1984), baritone Philip Larson, SONOR Ensemble conducted by Thomas Nee. Commissioned by Thomas Buckner.

He also has an album &quot;Pacific Sirens&quot; on New World Records.

He wrote &quot;Ricercar a 5 for Trombones&quot; for Stuart Dempster. The piece uses baroque imitation as well as singing, whistling, fanfares, slides, and other extended techniques.

His final work is &quot;Music for Trumpet, Strings, and Tympani&quot; (1990).

===Other activities===
He is the author of the book &quot;The Structure of Music: A Listener&#x27;s Guide&quot;, which he claimed helped him overcome a &quot;contrapuntal obsession&quot;, and &quot;Sound Structure in Music&quot; (1975), an important early attempt to systematically study timbre in music.

Erickson also served as Music Director of KPFA radio in Berkeley from 1955 to 1957 and as a director of the Pacifica Foundation, KPFA&#x27;s parent body, for several years thereafter. 

==Recognition and awards==
He received several Yaddo fellowships in the fifties and sixties, a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1966, a Ford Foundation fellowship, was elected as a fellow of the Institute for Creative Arts of the University of California in 1968, and his string quartet &quot;Solstice&quot; won the 1985 Friedham Award for Chamber Music. He also received awards from the National Endowment for the Arts and the American Academy.

There are two books about Erickson&#x27;s life and music: &quot;Thinking Sound Music: The Life and Work of Robert Erickson&quot; by Charles Shere and &quot;Music of Many Means: Sketches and Essays on the Music of Robert Erickson&quot; by Robert Erickson and John MacKay.

==Illness and death==
He suffered from a wasting muscle disease, polymyositis, and was bedridden and in pain for fifteen years before his death. He died in San Diego in 1997, California, aged 80.

<text>The Ohio Credit Union System is an Ohio-based American trade association for credit unions. The Ohio Credit Union System is composed of the Ohio Credit Union League (a credit union league), the Ohio Credit Union Foundation (a non-profit organization), OCULPAC (a lobbying organization), and OCUL Services Corp., a service &amp; solutions supplier for credit unions. OCUS credit unions have over 2.6 million members and $16.9 billion in deposits and include both federal credit unions and credit unions chartered by Ohio.

OCUS is governed by a board of directors elected by its member credit unions. OCUS headquarters have been in Cincinnati, Ohio (1934-1945), Columbus, Ohio (1945-1998), Dublin, Ohio (1998-2008), and moved back to Columbus, Ohio, in 2008. Under OCUS, the State of Ohio is divided into thirteen chapters, with affiliated credit unions assigned to the chapters based on their geographic location.

In 2006, OCUS entered a four-year partnership with World Council of Credit Unions (WOCCU) and Bolivian credit unions. The partnership seeks to create an electronic banking network in Bolivia with funding from USAID Bolivia. Employees of the Ohio Credit Unions are providing expertise and sharing technologies with Bolivian credit unions.

The Ohio Credit Union Foundation (OCUF) funds financial literacy programs and disaster relief efforts. The foundation granted $60,000 to the PBS television program Biz Kid$.

<text>Harold Hotelling (; September 29, 1895 – December 26, 1973) was an American mathematical statistician and an influential economic theorist, known for Hotelling&#x27;s law, Hotelling&#x27;s lemma, and Hotelling&#x27;s rule in economics, as well as Hotelling&#x27;s T-squared distribution in statistics. He also developed and named the principal component analysis method widely used in finance, statistics and computer science.

He was associate professor of mathematics at Stanford University from 1927 until 1931, a member of the faculty of Columbia University from 1931 until 1946, and a professor of Mathematical Statistics at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill from 1946 until his death. A street in Chapel Hill bears his name. In 1972, he received the North Carolina Award for contributions to science.

== Statistics ==
Hotelling is known to statisticians because of Hotelling&#x27;s T-squared distribution which is a generalization of the Student&#x27;s t-distribution in multivariate setting, and its use in statistical hypothesis testing and confidence regions. He also introduced canonical correlation analysis.

At the beginning of his statistical career Hotelling came under the influence of R.A. Fisher, whose &quot;Statistical Methods for Research Workers&quot; had &quot;revolutionary importance&quot;, according to Hotelling&#x27;s review. Hotelling was able to maintain professional relations with Fisher, despite the latter&#x27;s temper tantrums and polemics. Hotelling suggested that Fisher use the English word &quot;cumulants&quot; for Thiele&#x27;s Danish &quot;semi-invariants&quot;. Fisher&#x27;s emphasis on the sampling distribution of a statistic was extended by Jerzy Neyman and Egon Pearson with greater precision and wider applications, which Hotelling recognized. Hotelling sponsored refugees from European anti-semitism and Nazism, welcoming Henry Mann and Abraham Wald to his research group at Columbia. While at Hotelling&#x27;s group, Wald developed sequential analysis and statistical decision theory, which Hotelling described as &quot;pragmatism in action&quot;.

In the United States, Hotelling is known for his leadership of the statistics profession, in particular for his vision of a statistics department at a university, which convinced many universities to start statistics departments. Hotelling was known for his leadership of departments at Columbia University and the University of North Carolina.

== Economics ==
Hotelling has a crucial place in the growth of mathematical economics; several areas of active research were influenced by his economics papers. While at the University of Washington, he was encouraged to switch from pure mathematics toward mathematical economics by the famous mathematician Eric Temple Bell. Later, at Columbia University (where during 1933-34 he taught Milton Friedman statistics) in the &#x27;40s, Hotelling in turn encouraged young Kenneth Arrow to switch from mathematics and statistics applied to actuarial studies towards more general applications of mathematics in general economic theory. Hotelling is the eponym of Hotelling&#x27;s law, Hotelling&#x27;s lemma, and Hotelling&#x27;s rule in economics.

Hotelling was influenced by the writing of Henry George and was an editorial adviser for the Georgist journal AJES.

=== Spatial economics ===

One of Hotelling&#x27;s most important contributions to economics was his conception of &quot;spatial economics&quot; in his 1929 article. Space was not just a barrier to moving goods around, but rather a field upon which competitors jostled to be nearest to their customers.

Hotelling considers a situation in which there are two sellers at point A and B in a line segment of size l. The buyers are distributed uniformly in this line segment and carry the merchandise to their home at cost c. Let p1 and p2 be the prices charged by A and B, and let the line segment be divided in 3 parts of size a, x+y and b, where x+y is the size of the segment between A and B, &quot;a&quot; the portion of segment to the left of A and &quot;b&quot; the portion of segment to the right of B. Therefore, a+x+y+b=l. Since the product being sold is a commodity, the point of indifference to buying is given by p1+cx=p2+cy. Solving for x and y yields:

:formula_1

:formula_2

Let q1 and q2 indicate the quantities sold by A and B. The sellers profit are:

:formula_3

:formula_4

By imposing profit maximization:

:formula_5

:formula_6

Hotelling obtains the economic equilibrium. Hotelling argues this equilibrium is stable even though the sellers may try to establish a price cartel.

Hotelling extrapolates from his findings about spatial economics and links it to not just physical distance, but also similarity in products. He describes how, for example, some factories might make shoes for the poor and others for the rich, but they end up alike. He also quips that, &quot;Methodists and Presbyterian churches are too much alike; cider too homogenous.&quot;

=== Market socialism and Georgism ===
As an extension of his research in spatial economics, Hotelling realized that it would be possible and socially optimal to finance investment in public goods through a Georgist land value tax and then provide such goods and services to the public at marginal cost (in many cases for free). This is an early expression of the Henry George theorem that Joseph Stiglitz and others expanded upon. Hotelling pointed out that when local public goods like roads and trains become congested, users create an additional marginal cost of excluding others. Hotelling became an early advocate of Georgist congestion pricing and stated that the purpose of this unique type of toll fee was in no way to recoup investment costs, but was instead a way of changing behavior and compensating those who are excluded. Hotelling describes how human attention is also in limited supply at any given time and place, which produces a rental value; he concludes that billboards could be regulated or taxed on similar grounds as other scarcity rents. Hotelling reasoned that rent and taxation were analogous, the public and private versions of a similar thing. Therefore, the social optimum would be to put taxes directly on rent. Kenneth Arrow described this as market socialism, but Mason Gaffney points out that it is actually Georgism. Hotelling added the following comment about the ethics of Georgist value capture: &quot;The proposition that there is no ethical objection to the confiscation of the site value of land by taxation, if and when the nonlandowning classes can get the power to do so, has been ably defended by [the Georgist] H. G. Brown.&quot;

=== Non-convexities ===
Hotelling made pioneering studies of non-convexity in economics. In economics, &quot;non-convexity&quot; refers to violations of the convexity assumptions of elementary economics. Basic economics textbooks concentrate on consumers with convex preferences and convex budget sets and on producers with convex production sets; for convex models, the predicted economic behavior is well understood. When convexity assumptions are violated, then many of the good properties of competitive markets need not hold: Thus, non-convexity is associated with market failures, where supply and demand differ or where market equilibria can be inefficient.

==== Producers with increasing returns to scale: marginal cost pricing ====
In &quot;oligopolies&quot; (markets dominated by a few producers), especially in &quot;monopolies&quot; (markets dominated by one producer), non-convexities remain important. Concerns with large producers exploiting market power initiated the literature on non-convex sets, when Piero Sraffa wrote about firms with increasing returns to scale in 1926, after which Hotelling wrote about marginal cost pricing in 1938. Both Sraffa and Hotelling illuminated the market power of producers without competitors, clearly stimulating a literature on the supply-side of the economy.

==== Consumers with non-convex preferences ====
When the consumer&#x27;s preference set is non-convex, then (for some prices) the consumer&#x27;s demand is not connected. A disconnected demand implies some discontinuous behavior by the consumer as discussed by Hotelling:
Following Hotelling&#x27;s pioneering research on non-convexities in economics, research in economics has recognized non-convexity in new areas of economics. In these areas, non-convexity is associated with market failures, where any equilibrium need not be efficient or where no equilibrium exists because supply and demand differ. Non-convex sets arise also with environmental goods and other externalities, and with market failures, and public economics.
Non-convexities occur also with information economics, and with stock markets (and other incomplete markets). Such applications continued to motivate economists to study non-convex sets.

<doc id="935629" wikidata="Q5451533" url="?curid=935629" title="Fire and Rain (song)">
<text>&quot;Fire and Rain&quot; is a song written and performed by American singer-songwriter James Taylor, released in August 1970 by Warner Bros. Records as the second single from Taylor&#x27;s second studio album, &quot;Sweet Baby James&quot;. The song follows Taylor&#x27;s reaction to the suicide of Suzanne Schnerr, a childhood friend, and his experiences with drug addiction and fame. After its release, &quot;Fire and Rain&quot; peaked at number two on &quot;RPM&quot; Canada Top Singles chart and at number three on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100.

==Background and composition==
On the VH1 series &quot;Storytellers&quot;, Taylor said the song was about several incidents during his early recording career. The second line, &quot;Suzanne, the plans they made put an end to you&quot;, refers to Suzanne Schnerr, a childhood friend of his who died by suicide while he was in London, England, recording his first album. In that same account, Taylor said he had been in a deep depression after the failure of his new band the Flying Machine to coalesce (the lyric &quot;Sweet dreams and Flying Machines in pieces on the ground&quot;; the reference is to the name of the band rather than a fatal plane crash, as was long rumored). Taylor completed writing the song while in rehab.

In 2005, during an interview on NPR, Taylor explained to host Scott Simon that the song was written in three parts:

*The first part was about Taylor&#x27;s friend Suzanne, who died while Taylor was in London working on his first album after being signed to Apple Records. Friends at home, concerned that it might distract Taylor from his big break, kept the tragic news from him, and he found out six months later.
*The second part details Taylor&#x27;s struggle to overcome drug addiction and depression.
*The third part deals with coming to grips with fame and fortune, looking back at the road that got him there. It includes a reference to James Taylor and the Flying Machine, a band he briefly worked with before his big break with Paul McCartney, Peter Asher, and Apple Records.

Carole King played piano on the song. Drummer Russ Kunkel used brushes rather than sticks on his drum kit, and Bobby West played double bass in place of a bass guitar to &quot;underscore the melancholy on the song&quot;.

==Reception==
&quot;Record World&quot; said that the release of Taylor&#x27;s version as a single after several cover versions had been released &quot;was bound to come along. With so many versions out there is no reason the excellent original will not be THE one.&quot; &quot;Cash Box&quot; similarly referred to Taylor releasing it as a single, saying: &quot;Now, the fourth or fifth to release his own &#x27;Fire &amp; Rain,&#x27; Taylor may have found his sought after single hit the hard way. The &#x27;original&#x27; comes in the wake of R. B. Greaves&#x27; sales and Johnny Rivers&#x27; current treatment (not to mention BS&amp;T&#x27;s album track getting further notice).&quot; &quot;Billboard&quot; described it as a &quot;poignant ballad.&quot;

Broadcast Music, Inc. ranked &quot;Fire and Rain&quot; at number 82 on its &quot;Top 100 Songs of the Century&quot; list, while voters for the National Endowment for the Arts and Recording Industry Association of America&#x27;s Songs of the Century list, which comprises 365 songs of &quot;historical significance&quot; recorded from 1900 to 2000, placed &quot;Fire and Rain&quot; at number 85. In April 2011, the song was named at number 227 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s list of 500 greatest songs of all time. In September 2021, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; updated their ranking of the 500 greatest songs of all time, moving the song up to number 146.

In 1998, the 1970 recording of &quot;Fire and Rain&quot; by James Taylor on Warner Bros. Records was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame.

==Cover versions==
R. B. Greaves and Johnny Rivers first released singles of &quot;Fire and Rain&quot; in 1970. Warner Brothers released Taylor&#x27;s original as a single later that year, in August 1970. Greaves&#x27; and Rivers&#x27; versions peaked at numbers 82 and 94 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, respectively.

&quot;Billboard&quot; predicted that Greaves&#x27; version would be a hit and said that &quot;The James Taylor song is a natural and the production matches the song in merit.&quot; &quot;Record World&quot; also predicted it to be a hit and said that Taylor and Greaves &quot;are perfect together.&quot;

&quot;Record World&quot; called Rivers&#x27; version &quot;top quality stuff.&quot; &quot;Cash Box&quot; said of Rivers&#x27; version that &quot;the tang of country pop and a top forty arrangement make this the most commercial single yet on &#x27;Fire &amp; Rain.&#x27;&quot;

John Denver covered the song on his breakthrough album &quot;Poems, Prayers &amp; Promises&quot;.

American singer-songwriter Tim Hardin (cited by James Taylor as a songwriting influence) included a &quot;heartwrenchingly moving&quot; rendition of &quot;Fire and Rain&quot; on his 1973 album &quot;Nine&quot;.

Marcia Hines covered &quot;Fire and Rain&quot; on her 1975 debut LP, &quot;Marcia Shines&quot;. Her version reached No. 17 in Australia. At the 1975 Australian Record Awards, the song won Hines Female Vocal Single of the Year.

==References in other works==

Taylor references the song in another of his compositions, &quot;That&#x27;s Why I&#x27;m Here&quot;, title track from his 1985 album, in which he writes, &quot;Fortune and fame&#x27;s such a curious game. Perfect strangers can call you by name. Pay good money to hear &#x27;Fire and Rain&#x27; again and again and again.&quot;

He also refers to the song in another composition, &quot;Money Machine&quot; (a cynical take on the financial aspects of the recording industry): &quot;When I began the game, see me singing &#x27;bout Fire and Rain; Lemme just sing it again – I&#x27;ve seen fives and I&#x27;ve seen tens.&quot;

Carole King has stated that her song &quot;You&#x27;ve Got a Friend&quot;, which Taylor recorded, was a response to the line in the refrain, &quot;I&#x27;ve seen lonely times when I could not find a friend.&quot;

Joni Mitchell&#x27;s song &quot;Cold Blue Steel and Sweet Fire&quot;, from the 1972 album &quot;For the Roses&quot;, picks up the theme of Fire and Rain and chronicles Taylor&#x27;s descent into heroin addiction (the sweet fire) at the expense of his songwriting (the cold blue steel).

The NFL Films highlight film for Super Bowl XIX features narrator Brad Crandall reference the &quot;sweet dreams and flying machines in pieces on the ground&quot; lyric during a segment showing the eventual Super Bowl champion San Francisco 49ers sacking Miami Dolphins quarterback Dan Marino.

In a live performance in New York City Madison Square Garden, Taylor Swift tells of her love for &quot;Fire and Rain&quot;, relays how she found out that she was named after James Taylor and sings it with him on stage. 

==Parodies==
Taylor performs &quot;Fire and Rain&quot; on &quot;The Simpsons&quot; in the episode &quot;Deep Space Homer&quot;. While singing the song for the crew of a Space Shuttle (including Homer Simpson and Buzz Aldrin), he changes the line &quot;Sweet dreams and flying machines in pieces on the ground&quot; to &quot;Sweet dreams and flying machines, flying safely through the air&quot; when he realizes that the original lyrics might upset the astronauts, who are in danger of crashing their shuttle.

In 2015, Taylor appeared on &quot;The Late Show with Stephen Colbert&quot;, where he sang a version including numerous references to post-1970 popular culture.

<text>The men&#x27;s [[ice hockey]] tournament at the [[1976 Winter Olympics]] in Innsbruck, Austria, was the 13th Olympic Championship. The Soviet Union won its fifth gold medal. Games were held at the Olympiahalle Innsbruck.

==Highlights==
The main rivalry in the tournament was between the USSR and Czechoslovak national teams. The Czechoslovak team suffered from influenza throughout the tournament, and they finished the game against Poland with only twelve players on the bench. A doping test of one of the players was positive and a loss was recorded for the Czechoslovak team, although Poland did not receive points.

In the deciding game, Czechoslovakia was up 2–0 after the first period. In the second, the score was tied by Vladimir Shadrin and Vladimir Petrov. Eight minutes before the end of the game Eduard Novák scored the third goal for the Czechoslovak team. But subsequent goals by Aleksandr Yakushev and one minute later by Valeri Kharlamov led to the victory of the USSR, 4–3. The Soviet team won their fourth consecutive gold medal and fifth title overall.

Heralded as one of the great moments in German ice hockey, the West German team won a surprising bronze. After beating the Americans on the final day the German team celebrated what they believed to be a fourth place finish. While in the locker room they were informed that they had actually come third. The three-way tie was broken by first comparing the teams&#x27; head-to-head goal differential, then the remaining tied teams&#x27; goal ratio.

Sweden, having several of their top players now playing in the NHL and WHA, chose to join Canada in protesting the amateur rules and boycotted the games. They were also dissatisfied with the fact that the Soviet and Czechoslovak state-funded players who were de facto professionals were allowed to participate, meaning that Eastern Bloc countries did have an ability to send their best players, but the Western nations did not.

<text>This article lists political parties in Cuba. Cuba is a single-party authoritarian regime, led by the Communist Party of Cuba, where political opposition is not permitted. No party is allowed to campaign or endorse candidates for election, including the Communist Party. Candidates for National Assembly of People&#x27;s Power elections are nominated by organizations that are firmly controlled by the Party. Candidates are elected on an individual referendum basis without formal party involvement, though elected assemblies predominantly consist of members of the dominant party alongside non-affiliated candidates. Elections in Cuba are neither free, nor democratic. As a result, political rallies by opposition parties occur only sporadically on the island.
Cuban law also stipulates that it is punishable to receive funds from a foreign government for purposes of a political organization.

<text>Carol Plantamura (born February 8, 1941, in Los Angeles, California) is an American soprano specializing in 17th and 20th century music.

She graduated from Occidental College and was an original member of the Rockefeller Foundation-funded Creative Associates at SUNY Buffalo, under the direction of Lukas Foss. She has collaborated with such composers as Luciano Berio, Pierre Boulez, Vinko Globokar, Pauline Oliveros, Lukas Foss, Betsy Jolas, Will Ogdon, Bernard Rands, Frederic Rzewski, and Robert Erickson. Beginning in 1966, she was an original member of the improvising electronic music collective Musica Elettronica Viva in Rome, Italy.

From 1971 to 1984, Plantamura was active as a founding member, along with countertenor-composer John Patrick Thomas, cellist Marijke Verberne, and harpsichordist William Christie, of The Five Centuries Ensemble. The group combined early music with contemporary works (many written expressly for the ensemble) in concerts and radio broadcasts throughout Europe and America and on tours in Australia and New Zealand. Plantamura appears in six recordings of 17th-century Italian vocal music that The Five Centuries Ensemble made for the Fonit Cetra/Italia label in Italy (including works by d&#x27;India, Monteverdi, Luzzaschi, Gagliano, Frescobaldi, and A. Scarlatti-other ensemble members on the recordings include soprano Martha Herr, countertenor Thomas, lutenist Jürgen Hübscher, viola da gambist Martha McGaughey, and harpsichordist Arthur Haas).

Plantamura joined the faculty of the University of California, San Diego in 1978 and is currently Professor Emerita. She also serves on the San Diego Early Music Society (SDEMS) Advisory Panel .

<text>Binomial test is an exact test of the statistical significance of deviations from a theoretically expected distribution of observations into two categories using sample data. 

==Usage==
A binomial test is a statistical hypothesis test used to determine whether the proportion of successes in a sample differs from an expected proportion in a binomial distribution. It is useful for situations when there are two possible outcomes (e.g., success/failure, yes/no, heads/tails), i.e., where repeated experiments produce binary data. If one assumes an underlying probability formula_1 between 0 and 1, the null hypothesis is

: formula_2

For a sample of size formula_3, we would expect formula_4 successes. The formula of the binomial distribution gives the probability of those formula_3 samples instead producing formula_6 successes:

: formula_7

Suppose that we want to test the alternative hypothesis

: formula_8

i.e., we suspect that the actual probability of success is lower than formula_1. Then our formula_10-value would be computed using a one-tailed test; specifically, we compute the probability of seeing an outcome as extreme as, or more extreme (i.e., less likely), than formula_6:

: formula_12

An analogous computation can be done if we&#x27;re testing if formula_13 using the summation of the range from formula_6 to formula_3 instead.

Calculating a formula_10-value for a two-tailed test is slightly more complicated, since a binomial distribution isn&#x27;t symmetric if formula_17. This means that we can&#x27;t just double the formula_10-value from the one-tailed test. Recall that we want to consider events that are as extreme, or more extreme, than the one we&#x27;ve seen, so we should consider the probability that we would see an event that is as, or less, likely than formula_19. Let formula_20 denote all such events. Then the two-tailed formula_10-value is calculated as,

: formula_22

==Common use==
One common use of the binomial test is the case where the null hypothesizes that two categories occur with equal frequency (formula_23), such as a coin toss. Tables are widely available to give the significance observed numbers of observations in the categories for this case. However, as the example below shows, the binomial test is not restricted to this case.

When there are more than two categories, and an exact test is required, the multinomial test, based on the multinomial distribution, must be used instead of the binomial test.

Most common measures of effect size for Binomial tests are Cohen&#x27;s h or Cohen&#x27;s g.

== Large samples ==
For large samples such as the example below, the binomial distribution is well approximated by convenient continuous distributions, and these are used as the basis for alternative tests that are much quicker to compute, such as Pearson&#x27;s chi-squared test and the G-test. However, for small samples these approximations break down, and there is no alternative to the binomial test.

The most usual (and easiest) approximation is through the standard normal distribution, in which a z-test is performed of the test statistic formula_24, given by

: formula_25

where formula_6 is the number of successes observed in a sample of size formula_3 and formula_28 is the probability of success according to the null hypothesis. An improvement on this approximation is possible by introducing a continuity correction:

: formula_29

For very large formula_3, this continuity correction will be unimportant, but for intermediate values, where the exact binomial test doesn&#x27;t work, it will yield a substantially more accurate result.

In notation in terms of a measured sample proportion formula_31, null hypothesis for the proportion formula_32, and sample size formula_3, where formula_34 and formula_35, one may rearrange and write the z-test above as

: formula_36

by dividing by formula_3 in both numerator and denominator, which is a form that may be more familiar to some readers.

==Example==
Suppose we have a board game that depends on the roll of one die and attaches special importance to rolling a 6. In a particular game, the die is rolled 235 times, and 6 comes up 51 times. If the die is fair, we would expect 6 to come up 

: formula_38 

times. We have now observed that the number of 6s is higher than what we would expect on average by pure chance had the die been a fair one. But, is the number significantly high enough for us to conclude anything about the fairness of the die? This question can be answered by the binomial test. Our null hypothesis would be that the die is fair (probability of each number coming up on the die is 1/6).

To find an answer to this question using the binomial test, we use the binomial distribution 

: formula_39 with pmf formula_40 .

As we have observed a value greater than the expected value, we could consider the probability of observing 51 6s or higher under the null, which would constitute a one-tailed test (here we are basically testing whether this die is biased towards generating more 6s than expected). In order to calculate the probability of 51 or more 6s in a sample of 235 under the null hypothesis we add up the probabilities of getting exactly 51 6s, exactly 52 6s, and so on up to probability of getting exactly 235 6s:

: formula_41

If we have a significance level of 5%, then this result (0.02654 &lt; 5%) indicates that we have evidence that is significant enough to reject the null hypothesis that the die is fair.

Normally, when we are testing for fairness of a die, we are also interested if the die is biased towards generating fewer 6s than expected, and not only more 6s as we considered in the one-tailed test above. In order to consider both the biases, we use a two-tailed test. Note that to do this we cannot simply double the one-tailed p-value unless the probability of the event is 1/2. This is because the binomial distribution becomes asymmetric as that probability deviates from 1/2. There are two methods to define the two-tailed p-value. One method is to sum the probability that the total deviation in numbers of events in either direction from the expected value is either more than or less than the expected value. The probability of that occurring in our example is 0.0437. The second method involves computing the probability that the deviation from the expected value is as unlikely or more unlikely than the observed value, i.e. from a comparison of the probability density functions. This can create a subtle difference, but in this example yields the same probability of 0.0437. In both cases, the two-tailed test reveals significance at the 5% level, indicating that the number of 6s observed was significantly different for this die than the expected number at the 5% level.

==In statistical software packages==
Binomial tests are available in most software used for statistical purposes. E.g.

* In R the above example could be calculated with the following code: 
** binom.test(51, 235, 1/6, alternative = &quot;less&quot;) (one-tailed test)
** binom.test(51, 235, 1/6, alternative = &quot;greater&quot;) (one-tailed test)
** binom.test(51, 235, 1/6, alternative = &quot;two.sided&quot;) (two-tailed test)

* In Java using the Apache Commons library: 
** new BinomialTest().binomialTest(235, 51, 1.0 / 6, AlternativeHypothesis.LESS_THAN) (one-tailed test)
** new BinomialTest().binomialTest(235, 51, 1.0 / 6, AlternativeHypothesis.GREATER_THAN) (one-tailed test)
** new BinomialTest().binomialTest(235, 51, 1.0 / 6, AlternativeHypothesis.TWO_SIDED) (two-tailed test) 

* In SAS the test is available in the Frequency procedure
PROC FREQ DATA=DiceRoll ;
 TABLES Roll / BINOMIAL (P=0.166667) ALPHA=0.05 ;
 EXACT BINOMIAL ;
 WEIGHT Freq ;
RUN;

* In SPSS the test can be utilized through the menu &quot;Analyze&quot; &gt; &quot;Nonparametric test&quot; &gt; &quot;Binomial&quot;
 npar tests 
 /binomial (.5) = node1 node2.

* In Python, use SciPy&#x27;s binomtest:
** scipy.stats.binomtest(51, 235, 1.0/6, alternative=&quot;greater&quot;) (one-tailed test)
** scipy.stats.binomtest(51, 235, 1.0/6, alternative=&quot;two-sided&quot;) (two-tailed test)
* In MATLAB, use myBinomTest, which is available via Mathworks&#x27; community File Exchange website. myBinomTest will directly calculate the p-value for the observations given the hypothesized probability of a success. [pout]=myBinomTest(51, 235, 1/6) (generally two-tailed, but can optionally perform a one-tailed test).
* In Stata, use bitest.
* In Microsoft Excel, use Binom.Dist. The function takes parameters (Number of successes, Trials, Probability of Success, Cumulative). The &quot;Cumulative&quot; parameter takes a boolean True or False, with True giving the Cumulative probability of finding this many successes (a left-tailed test), and False the exact probability of finding this many successes.

<doc id="935668" wikidata="Q40395" url="?curid=935668" title="Belait District">
<text>Belait District (; Jawi: دأيره بلأيت) or simply known as Belait (&quot;&quot;; ), is the largest as well as the westernmost district in Brunei. It has an area of and the population of 65,531 as of 2021. The administrative town is Kuala Belait, located at the mouth of the long Belait River. The district is commonly associated with the oil and gas industry of the country, mainly concentrated near the town of Seria.

== Geography ==
The South China Sea borders Belait District to the north, Tutong District to the northeast, and Sarawak, Malaysia to the west and south. The district&#x27;s lowlands are steep and below an elevation of . Areas along the shore, which are mostly characterised by marshy plains with slender alluvial valleys that extend to the major rivers, are the exception. Bukit Teraja, the district&#x27;s highest point, stands at 417 meters.

With multiple offshore installations and pipeline connections, the district is situated on the northwest coast of Borneo, is a vital hub for the nation&#x27;s oil and gas sector. The Belait River, the longest river in the nation&#x27;s four major river systems, has an impact on the district&#x27;s coastal waters as it empties into the South China Sea. The presence of oil and gas infrastructure, which are encircled by a buffer zone of one nautical mile prohibiting fishing, limits the area&#x27;s fishing opportunities in both shallow and deeper seas. The district covers . There are a few known groundwater reserves in the Sungai Liang and Seria regions.

As of 1992, 18,418 hectares of Brunei&#x27;s mangrove forests were being modestly exploited for firewood, charcoal, and commercially for building poles, with Belait District contributing 3% (). &quot;Ceriops tagal&quot; was cultivated only in Belait, while &quot;Rhizophora apiculata&quot; and &quot;Nypa fruticans&quot; were the most common species in Brunei–Muara, Belait, and Tutong. In Belait, &quot;Melastoma malabathricum&quot; was the most associated species, and &quot;Rhizophora apiculata&quot; had the highest regeneration rate with 3,540 seedlings per hectare. The Belait Swamp Forest has been identified by BirdLife International as an Important Bird Area.

== History ==
Following numerous similar cessions to Sarawak and the British North Borneo Company, the District of Sarawak was ceded to Sir James Brooke in 1841. As a result, the State of Brunei was reduced to approximately 2,226 square miles, with a pre-1947 population of 40,670 (based on preliminary census figures for 1947). The State was made up a few outlying districts, the most significant of which are Belait, Tutong, and Temburong. Brunei&#x27;s foreign affairs were taken over by the British government in 1888, and in 1905 the monarchy nominated a British Resident to help with management. The Assistant Resident post was reinstated in response to the oil discoveries in the Belait District in order to handle the region&#x27;s growing demand.

A British Resident, serving as the high commissioner under the Governor of Sarawak, is in charge of Bruneian government. Advice from the Resident was needed on all issues, with the exception of those pertaining to the Islamic faith. Under the direction of the British Resident, four administrative districts were overseen by Malay district officers. Heads of state departments, including agriculture, public works, and medicine, are European officials on secondment; the Assistant Resident oversees the department of education at the moment. Local sanitation and related issues are overseen by sanitary boards in Brunei Town, Tutong, and Kuala Belait.

== Administration ==
Starting at the intersection of Lorong Tengah and Jalan Tengah, the declaration of the 1959 Kuala Belait and Seria (Municipal Board Areas) Declaration, delineates the precise boundaries of the Seria Municipal Board Area. It then proceeds to follow a number of roads and crossroads, culminating in the formation of the municipality&#x27;s specified boundary. Furthermore, in accordance with the Third Schedule, prior notices concerning these limits are withdrawn. The boundaries of the Kuala Belait and Seria Municipal Board Areas have been redrawn by this decree. The region of Oil Well No. 22 is currently included in the Seria Municipal Board region.

The Kuala Belait Municipal Board Area&#x27;s limits have been altered by the Sultan-in-Council&#x27;s 1974 Declaration (Municipal Board Area) Amendment. It delineates the new region on the east bank of the Belait River and supersedes the First Schedule of the 1959 Declaration. The region starts from a position on the Belait River estuary, travels north toward the China Sea, and passes by certain locations, such as the Istana Manggalela and the sewage disposal facility owned by Brunei Shell Petroleum (BSP), before circling back along the Belait River to the beginning point.

The procedures for the board&#x27;s business conduct are outlined in the Kuala Belait and Seria Municipal Board (Standing Orders) By-Laws, 2014. Meeting procedures, such as notification requirements, quorum requirements, and the responsibilities of the chairman and secretary, are outlined in the bylaws. Members must adhere to certain voting and speaking procedures, and meetings must begin with a prayer. The chairman is in charge of the meeting, and every motion needs to be submitted in writing and seconded before it can be discussed. These bylaws guarantee the Municipal Board&#x27;s organised and orderly governance.

The district is administered by the Belait District Office (), a government department under the Ministry of Home Affairs. The district is subdivided into 8 mukims, namely:

These are further subdivided into 83 Kampongs (Villages).

According to the Constitution, the district is to be represented in the Legislative Council, the state legislature, by up to 3 members. As of 2023, two members have been appointed to represent the district in the legislature.

== Demographics ==
Malay, Chinese, and other indigenous communities like the Dusun and Murut make up its population. The majority of people live in Seria and the main town of Kuala Belait. Due to homes provided by BSP and the British Forces Brunei, as well as recreational amenities, the Panaga area in the district is home to a significant expat population.

Despite their varied cultural histories and original non-Muslim status, seven indigenous ethnic groups—including the Belait people—were merged into a single Malay identity in 1961 with the passage of the Nationality Act. Consequently, the Belait and other communities are now acknowledged as Malays by the government, adding to Brunei&#x27;s complex Malay identity. Some notable non-Muslim minorities including the Belait people maintain their historical customs in spite of Islam&#x27;s supremacy. In 2022, Eid al-Fitr and Adau Gayoh were jointly celebrated in Belait District, which represent the blending of national identity with ancient rituals and promote unity, have become more common in public settings in recent years.

==Transportation==
===Road===

The government has invested approximately B$600 million in the 2007–2012 National Development Plan (RKN) to enhance road networks, including highway projects, paving, maintenance, and resurfacing. Notable projects in Belait under the RKN include upgrading Jalan Tutong–Seria (Lumut) phase 2, Jalan Sungai Mau/Merangking/Buau, high-density roads, and wooden bridge replacements, along with the construction of the Seria By-Pass second lane and widening roads on Jalan Singa Menteri. 

The Rasau Bridge connects the district to Sungai Tujoh and Miri in Sarawak, Malaysia to the west, while the Seria/Lumut bypass connects it to the Muara–Tutong Highway to the east. By coastal highways, it takes over an hour to get from Bandar Seri Begawan to Belait District. As of 2022, the district&#x27;s road network consisted of , out of which were paved.

===Rail===

Built by the British Malayan Petroleum Company (now BSP) in the 1930s, a narrow gauge railway with a gauge connected Seria to Badas for the transportation of water and subsequently pipeline tubes. Significant portions of the railway were concealed during World War II to keep Japanese soldiers from utilising it. The railway was promptly reactivated to move artillery and ammunition after being freed in July 1945 by the Australian Army&#x27;s 9th Division. The path between Seria and Badas is now paved, while parts of the track may still exist.

===Water===

To get upriver towards Kuala Balai, tourists can rent a water taxi at the public dock next to the Kuala Belait market. Additionally, the Kuala Belait Boat Club arranges boat cruises to a number of neighbouring locations. around the past, Rasau had a timber jetty around 1930. One of Brunei&#x27;s three ports, Kuala Belait Port, features a portion near the river mouth that is administered by BSP and has limited public access. Further upriver in Kampong Sungai Duhon, the commercial port can only handle shallow draft vessels because to silting. At the mouth of the river, two breakwaters have been built to lessen this. The nearest deepwater port in Brunei is Muara Port in Brunei–Muara District.

===Air===
A privately owned airstrip at Anduki is mostly used for flights to BSP facilities located offshore. Travelers must go to the Miri Airport or the Brunei International Airport for commercial flights. Panaga Health Centre, BSP Headquarters, and Suri Seri Begawan Hospital all have helipads. Furthermore, military helicopter operations are supported by a heliport at the Medicina Lines&#x27; British Army Jungle Warfare Training School, which is run by No. 230 Squadron RAF. 

==Economy==
=== Agriculture ===
In 2022, the Belait District had 1,511.72 hectares of gazetted agricultural development areas, with 1,052.67 hectares allocated to farmers and 269.31 hectares used for stations or other purposes. The district hosts a variety of Agricultural Development Areas (KKP), with a total of 1,511.72 hectares gazetted for agriculture. Of this, 1,052.67 hectares have been allocated to farmers, while 269.31 hectares are used for stations or other purposes. Specific areas include KKP Buau and KKP Kenapol, both dedicated to agriculture stations. KKP Bukit Sawat supports agriculture stations and fruit cultivation, while KKP Sungai Liang is used for fruits and vegetables. KKP Kandol, the largest area, spans 710.00 hectares, with 505.00 hectares for paddy. KKP Labi Lama and KKP Lilas are dedicated to fruits, integrated crops, and miscellaneous farming. KKP Lot Sengkuang A and KKP Merangking focus on paddy cultivation. Additionally, KKP Mumong and KKP Sungai Petai are used for a mix of fruits, vegetables, and livestock activities.

In 2022, the district is the only producer of all local cut flowers. The market was dominated by &quot;Orchidaceae&quot;, with 48,996 cuts valued at B$41,325, representing 98.6% of the total quantity. &quot;Alpinia purpurata&quot;, &quot;Davallia mariesii&quot;, and &quot;Heliconia&quot; accounted for 0.4%, 0.5%, and 0.1% of the total quantity, respectively. The overall market totaled 49,681 cuts with a retail value of B$41,908.

=== Oil and gas ===

Being the location of Brunei&#x27;s main natural gas and oil resources, the district is an important area. There, Seria oil field was first found in 1929, and commercial production started in 1932. Rasau is dominated by one of Brunei&#x27;s two onshore oil fields, operated by BSP, discovered in 1979, and began production in 1983, with wells located primarily between the Rasau Bridge and Sungai Tujoh, as well as on the east side of the Belait River. The gas sector grew significantly as well, and at Lumut, where one of the biggest liquefied natural gas facilities in the world was established by Brunei LNG. In the natural gas sector, the Bruneian government, BSP, and Mitsubishi Corporation are partners, while the oil industry functions as a joint venture between the Bruneian government and the Royal Dutch Shell.

Over half of Brunei&#x27;s gas reserves and 60% of the company&#x27;s total production are found at the South West Ampa gas field, which is the oldest and most significant offshore field in the country. It is situated 13 kilometers offshore from Kuala Belait. Gas is routed 39 kilometers to the Brunei LNG facility at Lumut from its 56 wells. The field has 164 producing wells and significant oil reserves. The Gannet and Fairley fields, which are nearby, yield both gas and oil; Fairley has 22 gas wells and 29 oil wells. In addition, the 32 wells in the 60 kilometers northeast of Seria Magpie field have been producing 6,000 barrels of oil a day since 1977. Additionally, BSP shares output from the Fairley–Baram field, which is situated near Sarawak&#x27;s border. Located 45 km northwest of Seria, BSP found and is projected to produce an estimated 30 million barrels over the course of 15–20 years from the Egret oil field.

=== Petrochemical ===

The Sungai Liang Industrial Park (SPARK) has developed an industrial cluster that the Brunei Economic Development Board (BEDB) worked to transform into a premier petrochemical hub. Located on , the Brunei Methanol Company (BMC) operates a US$600 million methanol facility, which represents SPARK&#x27;s first significant investment. BEDB is also taking into account a number of international investors&#x27; ideas for further petrochemical projects in the park. Situated in SPARK, Brunei Fertilizer Industries (BFI) is a government-owned enterprise that produces 1,365,000 tons of urea yearly, making it one of the largest fertiliser plant in Southeast Asia.

=== Agrifood ===
In 2022, Belait District utilised 232.27 hectares for livestock, covering a variety of commodities. This included 22.98 hectares for broiler (chicken meat), 16.60 hectares for layer (eggs), 40.00 hectares for day-old chicks, and 0.00 hectares for fertilised eggs. Additionally, 16.37 hectares were used for buffalo, 27.24 hectares for cattle, 58.01 hectares for goats, and 38.75 hectares for sheep. Other livestock areas included 8.42 hectares for miscellaneous livestock. Slaughterhouses occupied 3.90 hectares. The egg industry in the district produced 81.44 million eggs, which accounted for 46.8% of the total production in Brunei. The retail value of these eggs was B$14.20 million. The district have 2 farms involved in the egg production industry.

=== Fisheries ===

In 2021, Belait District produced 0.17 metric tonnes of freshwater fish, with a retail value of B$0.002 million. This accounted for a small fraction of the total production in Brunei. The number of small-scale fishermen varied from 268 in 2015 to 189, with a total of 1,625 fishermen over the seven-year period. With meshes ranging from 4 to 26.5 cm, &quot;andang karan&quot; is used to catch fish in the open coastal waters near Belait District. Belait (20%), Tutong (15%), and Brunei-Muara District (65%) account for the majority of the licensed full-time fisherman. Currently, artisanal fishermen use seven primary landing locations, two of which are in the Belait District. These fish inhabit mangrove lining of river embankments, river channels, and the seaward edges of the mangrove fringes in the Brunei estuary, which includes the Belait River.

== Development ==
The National Housing Programme started in the 1950s with resettlement initiatives began a number of programs, such as the Infill Scheme (IS), Temporary Occupation-of-Land License (TOL), and Landless Indigenous Citizens&#x27; Housing Scheme (STKRJ). Similar housing projects have been carried out in the district at Kampong Pandan, Kampong Sungai Liang/Lumut, and Kampong Lorong Tengah Seria. The RKN 2007–2012 calls for further infrastructure development for Mumong.

Using one of three separate networks, the Department of Electrical Services is in charge of managing the production, distribution, and transmission of electricity in Brunei. Brunei–Muara, Tutong, and Belait Districts are covered by network one. In response to the increasing need for power, the government built the Seria power station and, in 1987, developed a cogeneration plant in Lumut in collaboration with BSP. New street lights were installed, the power supply for SPARK was improved, and existing power stations were revitalised. The RKN 2007–2012 calls for more infrastructure development in the district as well as modifications to the distribution network.

The nation has been increasing its piped water supply since the 1970s, and in the 1980s, a Master Plan was implemented to address the growing needs resulting from development and population expansion. 99.9% of people have access to potable water by the end of the RKN 8. Water from Sungai Badas is delivered to Belait and treated at the Labi and Seria water treatment plants. Enhancing treatment capacity, decreasing unaccounted water, raising water resources, and raising quality are the main objectives of the RKN 2007–2012. Important initiatives include building a new water treatment facility in Sungai Liang, building dams in Ulu Tutong and Kargo, and modernizing the current infrastructure to accommodate the increasing demand.

<doc id="935669" wikidata="Q2996302" url="?curid=935669" title="Fenian raids">
<text>The Fenian raids were a series of incursions carried out by the Fenian Brotherhood, an Irish republican organization based in the United States, on military fortifications, customs posts and other targets in Canada (then part of British North America) in 1866, and again from 1870 to 1871. A number of separate incursions by the Fenian Brotherhood into Canada were undertaken to bring pressure on the British government to withdraw from Ireland, although none of these raids achieved their aims.

In Canada, the incursions divided its burgeoning Irish-Canadian population, many of whom were torn between loyalty to their new home and sympathy for the aims of the Fenians. Protestant Irish immigrants were generally loyal to the British and fought with the pro-Union Orange Order against the Fenians.

While authorities in the United States arrested the men and confiscated the arms of the Fenian Brotherhood, there was speculation that some in the U.S. government ignored the preparations undertaken by the Fenians due to anger over British assistance to the Confederacy during the American Civil War. The Fenian raids were one of the factors that led to Canadian Confederation, as the provinces united to face the threat of invasions.

==Raids==
===Early raids (1866)===
====Dedham====
The Dedham, Massachusetts chapter of the Fenian Brotherhood, which had offices in the Norfolk House, hosted a meeting at Temperance Hall in which a raid into Canada was organized. John R. Bullard, a recent Harvard Law School graduate, was elected moderator of the meeting and, having been swept up in his own sudden importance and fever of the meeting, ended his animated speech by asking &quot;Who would be the first man to come forward and pledge himself to go to Canada and help free Ireland?&quot; The first of the roughly dozen men to sign the &quot;enlistment papers&quot; were Patrick Donohoe and Thomas Golden. Thomas Brennan said he could not participate, but donated $50 to the cause. The meeting ended with the group singing &quot;The Wearing of the Green.&quot; The raid was a failure. Some of the men got as far as St. Albans, Vermont, but none made it to Canada. A few were arrested and some had to send home for money.

====New Brunswick====
Led by John O&#x27;Mahony, this Fenian raid occurred in April 1866, at Campobello Island, New Brunswick. A Fenian Brotherhood war party of over 700 members arrived at the Maine shore opposite the island intending to seize Campobello from the British. Royal Navy officer Charles Hastings Doyle, stationed at Halifax, Nova Scotia, responded decisively. On 17 April 1866, he left Halifax with several warships carrying over 700 British soldiers and proceeded to Passamaquoddy Bay, where the Fenian force was concentrated. This show of force by Doyle discouraged the Fenians, and they dispersed. The invasion reinforced the idea of protection for New Brunswick by joining with the British North American colonies of Nova Scotia, and the United Province of Canada, formerly Upper Canada (now Ontario) and Lower Canada (Quebec), to form the Dominion of Canada.

====Canada West====
After the Campobello raid, the &quot;Presidential faction&quot; led by Fenian founders James Stephens and John O&#x27;Mahony focused more on fundraising for rebels in Ireland. The more militant &quot;Senate Faction&quot; led by William R. Roberts believed that even a marginally successful invasion of the Province of Canada or other parts of British North America would provide them with leverage in their efforts. After the failure of the April attempt to raid New Brunswick, which had been blessed by O&#x27;Mahony, the Senate Faction implemented their own plan for invading Canada. Drafted by the senate &quot;Secretary for War&quot; General T. W. Sweeny, a distinguished former Union Army officer, the plan called for multiple invasions at points in Canada West (now southern Ontario) and Canada East (now southern Quebec) intended to cut Canada West off from Canada East and possible British reinforcements from there. Key to the plan was a diversionary attack at Fort Erie from Buffalo, New York, meant to draw troops away from Toronto in a feigned strike at the nearby Welland Canal system. This was the only Fenian attack, other than the Quebec raid several days later, which was launched in June 1866.

About 1000 to 1300 Fenians crossed the Niagara River in the first 14 hours of June 1 under Colonel John O&#x27;Neill. Sabotaged by Fenians in its crew, the U.S. Navy&#x27;s side-wheel gunboat did not begin intercepting Fenian reinforcements until 2:15 p.m.—14 hours after Owen Starr&#x27;s advance party had crossed the river ahead of O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s main force. Once the USS &quot;Michigan&quot; was deployed, O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s force in the Niagara Region was cut off from further supplies and reinforcements.

After assembling with other units from Canada and travelling all night, Canadian troops advanced into a well-laid ambush by approximately 600–700 Fenians the next morning north of Ridgeway, a small hamlet west of Fort Erie. (The Fenian strength at Ridgeway had been reduced by desertions and deployments of Fenians in other locations in the area overnight.)

Canadian Militia troops at the Battle of Ridgeway consisted of inexperienced volunteers with no more than basic drill training but armed with Enfield rifled muskets equal to the armaments of the Fenians. A single company of the Queen&#x27;s Own Rifles of Toronto had been armed the day before on their ferry crossing from Toronto with state-of-the-art seven-shot Spencer repeating rifles, but had not had an opportunity to practise with them and were issued with only 28 rounds per man. The Fenians were mostly battle-hardened American Civil War veterans, armed with weapons procured from leftover war supplies, either Enfield rifled muskets or the comparable Springfield.

The opposing forces exchanged volleys for about two hours, before a series of command errors threw the Canadians into confusion. The Fenians took advantage of it by launching a bayonet charge that broke the inexperienced Canadian ranks. Seven Canadians were killed on the battlefield, two died shortly afterwards from wounds, and four later died of wounds or disease while on service; ninety-four more were wounded or disabled by disease. Ten Fenians were killed and sixteen wounded.

After the battle, the Canadians retreated to Port Colborne, at the Lake Erie end of the Welland Canal. The Fenians rested briefly at Ridgeway, before returning to Fort Erie. Another encounter, the Battle of Fort Erie, followed that saw several Canadians severely wounded and the surrender of a large group of local Canadian Militia who had moved into the Fenian rear. After considering the inability of reinforcements to cross the river and the approach of large numbers of Canadian Militia and British soldiers, the remaining Fenians released the Canadian prisoners and returned to Buffalo early in the morning of June 3. They were intercepted by the gunboat &quot;Michigan&quot; and surrendered to the United States Navy.

The traditional historical narrative alleges that the turning point in the Battle of Ridgeway was when Fenian cavalry was erroneously reported and the Canadian Militia ordered to form squares, the standard tactic for infantry to repel cavalry. When the mistake was recognized, an attempt was made to reform in column; being too close to the Fenian lines, it failed. In his 2011 history of Ridgeway, however, historian Peter Vronsky argues the explanation was not as simple as that. Prior to the formation of the square, confusion had already broken out when a unit of the Queen&#x27;s Own Rifles mistook three arriving companies from the 13th Battalion (Canadian Militia) for British troops. When the Queen&#x27;s Own Rifles began retiring to give the field to what they thought were British Army units, the 13th Battalion mistook this for a retreat and began withdrawing themselves. At this moment that the infamous &quot;form square&quot; order was given, completing the debacle that was unfolding on the field.

A board of inquiry determined that allegations over the alleged misconduct of Lieutenant-Colonel Alfred Booker (13th Battalion), on whom command of Canadian volunteers had devolved, had &quot;not the slightest foundation for the unfavourable imputations cast upon him in the public prints&quot;. Nevertheless, the charges dogged Booker for the rest of his life. A second board of inquiry into the battle at Fort Erie exonerated Lieutenant-Colonel J. Stoughton Dennis, Brigade Major of the Fifth Military District, although the President of the Board of Inquiry, Colonel George T. Denison, differed from his colleagues on several key points.

Five days after the start of the invasion, U. S. President Andrew Johnson issued a proclamation requiring enforcement of the neutrality laws, guaranteeing the Fenian invasion could not continue. Generals Ulysses S. Grant and General George Meade went to Buffalo, New York to inspect the situation. Following instructions from Grant, Meade issued strict orders to prevent anyone from violating the border. Grant then proceeded to St. Louis. Meade, finding that the battles were over and the Fenian army interned in Buffalo, went to Ogdensburg, New York, to oversee the situation in the St. Lawrence River area. The U.S. Army was then instructed to seize all Fenian weapons and ammunition and prevent more border crossings. Further instructions on 7 June 1866 were to arrest anyone who appeared to be a Fenian.

Fenian commander Brigadier-General Thomas William Sweeny was arrested by the United States government for violating American neutrality. He was soon released and served in the United States Army until he retired in 1870.

====Canada East====
After the invasion of Canada West failed, the Fenians concentrated their efforts on Canada East. However, the U.S. government began to impede Fenian activities and arrested many Fenian leaders. The Fenians&#x27; plans began to fade. General Samuel Spear of the Fenians escaped arrest, and, on June 7, 1866 Spear and his 1000 men marched into Canada and occupied Pigeon Hill, Frelighsburg, St. Armand and Stanbridge. Until this point the Canadian government had done little to defend the border, but on June 8 Canadian forces marched to Pigeon Hill and the Fenian force there, low on arms, ammunition and supplies, promptly surrendered. This ended the raid on Canada East.

Timothy O&#x27;Hea was awarded the Victoria Cross for actions he took at Danville, Canada East, on June 9, 1866, at about the time of the Pigeon Hill Raid. Although only about 23 years old, O&#x27;Hea, a private in the 1st Battalion of the Rifle Brigade, Prince Consort&#x27;s Own, of the British Regular Army, stationed in Canada, saw the threat posed by a burning railway car containing a large quantity of ammunition and fought the blaze single-handedly for an hour, saving the lives of many nearby.

===Later raids (1870–71)===
From 1870 to 1871, the Fenian Brotherhood conducted several raids into the Canadian provinces of Quebec and Manitoba.

In addition to organizing raids against those provinces, the Fenian Brotherhood also organized openly in the Northwestern United States in the 1870s, threatening the security of the Colony of British Columbia. Although the Fenians never launched a raid against British Columbia, tensions were sufficient that the Royal Navy sent several large warships to the new railhead at Vancouver, British Columbia, during celebrations for the completion of the Canadian Pacific Railway in 1886.

====Quebec====

Fenians conducted a raid into Canada on 25 May 1870. Canadian soldiers, acting on information supplied by Thomas Miller Beach, anticipated and turned back the attack at Eccles Hill.

In the Battle of Trout River, Canadians replused a Fenian raid on 27 May 1870 outside of Huntingdon, Quebec, near the international border about north of Malone, New York. (The location of this battle should not be confused with Trout River in the Northwest Territories.)

====Manitoba-Minnesota border====
John O&#x27;Neill, after the failed 1870 invasion, had resigned the Senate Wing and then joined the Savage Wing. In return he was given a seat on the Savage Wing governing council. In 1871 O&#x27;Neill and an odd character named W. B. O’Donoghue asked the Savage Wing Council to undertake another invasion of Canada across the Dakota Territory border. The Council, weary of Canadian adventures in general and O’Neill in particular, would have none of it. O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s idea was turned down, but the Council promised to loan him arms and agreed they would not publicly denounce him and his raid.

O&#x27;Neill resigned from the Fenians to lead the invasion, which was planned in Saint Paul, Minnesota, to invade Manitoba near Winnipeg. About 35 men, led by O&#x27;Neill, William B. O&#x27;Donoghue, and John J. Donnelly, hoped to join forces with Louis Riel&#x27;s French-Indian Métis. On October 5, O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s force managed to capture a Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company post and a Canadian customs house which they believed to be just north of the international border. A U.S. survey team had determined the border was two miles further north, placing the Hudson&#x27;s Bay post and the customs house both inside U.S. territory. O&#x27;Neill, J. J. Donnelly and ten others were taken prisoner near Pembina, Dakota Territory, by U.S. soldiers led Captain Loyd Wheaton.

The farcical raid was doomed from the very start. It actually took place inside the United States, and the Métis under Riel had signed a pact with the British just as the invasion began. Riel and his Métis captured O&#x27;Donoghue and gave him to U.S. authorities. In a somewhat muddled federal response, O&#x27;Neill was arrested twice – once in Dakota and once in Minnesota – but was released and never charged for &quot;invading&quot; U.S. territory. The men captured with him were released by the court as simply &quot;dupes&quot; of O&#x27;Neill and Donnelly.

==Aftermath==

Support for the Fenian Brotherhood&#x27;s invasion of Canada quickly disappeared and there was no real threat after the 1890s. Nevertheless, the raids had an important effect on all Canadians. Ironically, though they did nothing to advance the cause of Irish independence, the 1866 Fenian raids and the inept efforts of the Canadian Militia to repulse them helped to galvanize support for Confederation in 1867. Some historians have argued that the affair tipped the final votes of reluctant Maritime provinces in favour of the collective security of nationhood, making Ridgeway the &quot;battle that made Canada.&quot; Alexander Muir, a Scottish immigrant, author of &quot;The Maple Leaf Forever&quot; and member of the Orange Order, fought at Ridgeway with the Queen&#x27;s Own Rifles.

The raids also aroused a martial spirit among Canadians by testing the militia&#x27;s strength. Because of their poor performance, the militia took efforts to improve themselves. This was achieved without the huge cost of a real war. The militia possessed an authorised strength of 40,000 men, however, during the period of the 1866 raids, a total of 37,170 volunteers turned out. The greatest impact of the Fenian raids was in the developing a sense of Canadian nationalism and leading the provinces into Confederation. This was seen as necessary for survival and self-defence; the raids showed Canadians that safety lay in unity and were an important factor in creating the modern nation-state of Canada.

The Fenian raids caused increased anti-American sentiment in Canada and the Maritimes because of the U.S. government&#x27;s perceived tolerance of the Fenians when they were meeting openly and preparing for the raids. However, many Americans saw this as retribution against British-Canadian tolerance and aid to the Confederate Secret Service activities in Canada against the Union during the Civil War (such as the &quot;Chesapeake&quot; Affair and the St. Albans Raid). An estimated casualty figure for the Fenian Raids into Canada 1866, including deaths from disease while on service in both Canada West (Ontario) and Canada East (Quebec), was calculated by the Militia Department in 1868 as 31 dead and 103 wounded or struck by disease (including a female civilian accidentally shot by the militia.)

===Memory===
Several memorials were erected throughout Canada, commemorating those who volunteered with the Canadian Militia fought during the raids. These monuments include the Canadian Volunteers Monument in Queen&#x27;s Park, Toronto, and the Battle of Eccles Hill Monument in Frelighsburg, Quebec. In June 2006 Ontario&#x27;s heritage agency dedicated a plaque at Ridgeway on the commemoration of the 140th anniversary of the battle. Many members of the Queen&#x27;s Own Rifles of Canada return to the Ridgeway battle site on the weekend closest to the June 2 anniversary for a bicycle tour of the battle sites.

In Buffalo, a historic marker commemorates the June 1866 Fenian incursion into Fort Erie and Ridgeway, Ont. The marker is located in the Black Rock neighborhood in Tow Path Park on the west end of Hertel overlooking the Niagara River.

<text>The Arch Deluxe was a hamburger sold by the international fast food restaurant chain McDonald&#x27;s in 1996 and marketed specifically to adults.

It is considered one of the most expensive product flops of all time.

== Product description ==

The Arch Deluxe was a quarter pound of beef on a split-top potato flour sesame seed bun, topped with a circular piece of peppered bacon, leaf lettuce, tomato, American cheese, onions, ketchup, and Dijonnaise (a portmanteau of Dijon mustard and mayonnaise) sauce.

== History ==
In response to the demographic trend of longer lifespans and an expanding older market, and to its child-centered image, McDonald&#x27;s made a conscious decision to attempt to market its food to a more adult audience. Rather than change its existing menu items or marketing strategy, the company decided to create a new line of sandwiches with what would hopefully be perceived as more sophisticated ingredients. It commissioned Executive Chef Andrew Selvaggio to create the Deluxe line of burgers including the Fish Filet Deluxe, Grilled Chicken Deluxe, Crispy Chicken Deluxe, and the flagship Arch Deluxe.

The Arch Deluxe was first tested as a &quot;Taste of the Month&quot; burger in October 1995 at McDonald&#x27;s restaurants in Canada. Afterwards, the Arch Deluxe was officially released in May 1996 in one of the most expensive advertising campaigns to date. Customers were dissuaded, however, by the high price, which ranged from US$2.09 up to US$2.49 (equivalent to $ in ), and unconventional ads, and consumer groups were upset by the higher caloric content. The brand was still sold at select restaurants during 1998 and 1999. On August 18, 2000, the Arch Deluxe was finally discontinued, and is no longer found at McDonald&#x27;s stores.

McDonald&#x27;s is estimated to have spent over US$300 million (equivalent to $ million in ) on the research, production, and marketing for the Arch Deluxe. The company stated in 2003 that some of its initial research into adult marketing was recycled in the development of its successful line of salads.
