<text>The Motorcycle Diaries () is a 2004 biographical coming-of-age road movie directed by Walter Salles from a screenplay by José Rivera, based on Che Guevara&#x27;s 1995 memoir of the same name and Alberto Granado&#x27;s memoir &quot;Che Guevara: The Making of a Revolutionary&quot;. The film recounts the 1952 expedition, initially by motorcycle, across South America by Guevara and Granado, observing the life of the impoverished indigenous peasantry. Through the trip both of them witness the social classes struggle in Latin America.

It stars Gael García Bernal as Guevara (Gael had previously played Che in the 2002 miniseries &quot;Fidel&quot;), and Rodrigo de la Serna as Granado (Serna himself is second-cousin to Guevara on his maternal side).

The film had its world premiere at the Sundance Film Festival on 15 January 2004, and was later added into the main competition of the 57th Cannes Film Festival, where it won the Prize of the Ecumenical Jury. It was received with positive reviews from critics. At the 77th Academy Awards, Rivera was nominated for the Best Adapted Screenplay category, while Uruguayan singer Jorge Drexler won the Best Original Song category for &quot;Al otro lado del río&quot;.

==Plot==
In 1952, a semester before Ernesto &quot;Fuser&quot; Guevara is due to complete his medical degree, he and his older friend Alberto Granado, a biochemist, leave Buenos Aires to travel across South America. While there is a goal at the end of their journey – they intend to work in a leper colony in Peru – the main purpose is initially fun and adventure. They desire to see as much of Latin America as they can, more than in just four and a half months, while Granado&#x27;s purpose is also to bed as many women as will fall for his pickup lines. Their initial method of transport is Granado&#x27;s dilapidated Norton 500 motorcycle christened &quot;La Poderosa&quot; (&quot;The Mighty One&quot;).

Their planned route is ambitious, bringing them north across the Andes, along the coast of Chile, through the Atacama Desert and into the Peruvian Amazon in order to reach Venezuela just in time for Granado&#x27;s 30th birthday on 2 April. However, due to &quot;La Poderosa&#x27;s&quot; breakdown, they are forced to travel at a much slower pace, often walking, and do not make it to Caracas until July.

During their expedition, Guevara and Granado encounter the poverty of the indigenous peasants, and the movie assumes a greater seriousness once the men gain a better sense of the disparity between the &quot;haves&quot; (to which they belong) and the obviously exploited &quot;have-nots&quot; (who make up the majority of those they encounter) by travelling on foot. In Chile, for instance, they encounter a penniless and persecuted couple forced onto the road because of their communist beliefs. In a fire-lit scene, Guevara and Granado ashamedly admit to the couple that they are not out looking for work as well. The duo then accompanies the couple to the Chuquicamata copper mine, where Guevara becomes angry at the treatment of the workers.

However, it is a visit to the ancient Incan ruins of Machu Picchu in Peru that solidifies something in Guevara. His musings are then somberly refocused to how an indigenous civilization capable of building such beauty could be destroyed by the creators of the eventually polluted urban decay of nearby Lima.

Later, in Peru, they volunteer for three weeks at the San Pablo leper colony. There, Guevara observes both literally and metaphorically the division of society, as the staff live on the north side of a river, separated from the deprived lepers living across the river to the south. To demonstrate his solidarity, and his medical belief that leprosy is not contagious, Guevara refuses to wear rubber gloves during his visit as the head nun requires, choosing instead to shake bare hands and interact normally with the surprised leper patients.

At the end of the film, after his sojourn at the leper colony, Guevara confirms his nascent egalitarian, revolutionary impulses, while making a birthday toast, which is also his first political speech. In it, he calls for the unification of South America on the basis of the unity of the Mestizo people. These encounters with social injustice transform the way Guevara sees the world and his purposes in it, and by implication motivates his later political activities as a Marxist revolutionary.

Guevara makes his symbolic &quot;final journey&quot; at night when, despite the danger and his asthma, he swims across the river that separates the two societies of the leper colony, to spend the night in a leper shack, instead of in the doctors&#x27; cabins. Later, as they bid each other farewell at an airport, Granado reveals that his birthday was not 2 April, but rather 8 August, and that the aforementioned goal was simply a motivator: Guevara replies that he knew all along. The film closes with an appearance by the real 82-year-old Alberto Granado, along with pictures from the actual journey and a brief mention of Che Guevara&#x27;s eventual 1967 CIA-assisted execution in the Bolivian jungle.

==Cast==
==Development==

Gael García Bernal agreed to reprise his role as young Che Guevara having previously portrayed him in the television film Fidel. To prepare for the role, he went through six months of intense preparation. This groundwork included reading &quot;every biography&quot; about Guevara, traveling to Cuba to speak with Guevara&#x27;s family, and consulting with Guevara&#x27;s then still living travel partner Alberto Granado. Despite being in his eighties, Granado was also taken on as an adviser by Salles, and enthusiastically followed the film crew as they retraced his former journey.

Moreover, García Bernal (who is Mexican) adopted an Argentine accent and spent 14 weeks reading the works of José Martí, 
Karl Marx and Pablo Neruda (Guevara&#x27;s favorite poet). García Bernal told reporters &quot;I feel a lot of responsibility. I want to do it well because of what Che represents to the world. He is a Romantic. He had a political consciousness that changed Latin America.&quot; According to García Bernal, the role crystallized his &quot;own sense of duty&quot; because Guevara &quot;decided to live on the side of the mistreated, to live on the side of the people who have no justice – and no voice.&quot; In surmising the similarities between his transformation and Guevara&#x27;s, García Bernal posits that &quot;my generation is awakening, and we&#x27;re discovering a world full of incredible injustice.&quot;

Granado later stated that he appreciated the film&#x27;s effort &quot;to dig beneath the &quot;mythical Che&quot;, whose defiant image appears on T-shirts and posters around the world, &quot;to reveal the flawed, flesh-and-blood Ernesto beneath.&quot;

==Locations==
In a journey that lasts eight months, the partners travel over 14,000 kilometers (8,700 miles), from Argentina through Chile, Peru, and Colombia to Venezuela. Key locations along the journey described in the film include: in Argentina: Buenos Aires, Miramar, Villa Gesell, San Martín de los Andes, Lago Frías, Patagonia and Nahuel Huapi Lake; in Chile: Temuco, Los Angeles, Valparaíso, the Atacama Desert, and Chuquicamata; in Peru: Cuzco, Machu Picchu, Lima, The San Pablo Leper Colony; as well as Leticia, Colombia and Caracas, Venezuela.

Reviewer Nick Cowen of &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; described the scenery as &quot;visually stunning&quot; while remarking that &quot;the cinematography of fog-cloaked mountains, lush, green forests and sunburnt deserts is breathtakingly beautiful enough to serve as a travel advert for the entire continent.&quot;

===Tourist trails===

&quot;The Observer&quot; reported that shortly after the film&#x27;s release, tour operators in the region received a surge of inquiries, with some of them even offering Che Guevara-themed trips, where travellers could &quot;follow in the footsteps of the revolutionary icon.&quot;

The crew filmed in the same San Pablo Leper Colony that Guevara himself had visited. According to Bernal, 85% of the people suffering leprosy in the film were actual lepers, with some of them having lived there when Che and Granado worked at the colony. In fact, when Granado returned with the film crew to the leprosarium of San Pablo, he found some of the people he had treated half a century earlier, remarking that &quot;It was wonderful and amazing that they could still remember me.&quot; Granado was also pleased that buildings constructed for the scenes shot at the leprosarium were afterwards used by the patients themselves.

The scene which features Guevara&#x27;s character swimming across to the other side of the river was filmed during three nights in which Bernal swam across the actual Amazon River.

==Soundtrack==

The score for &quot;The Motorcycle Diaries&quot; was composed by Gustavo Santaolalla. The film&#x27;s soundtrack was released on the Deutsche Grammophon label in 2004.

==Release==
The film was first presented at the Sundance Film Festival on 15 January 2004. Granado had an invitation to the Sundance premiere, but he was refused an entry Visa by the United States. Later it was featured at the 2004 Cannes Film Festival on 19 May, and Granado was able to attend.

The film later screened at many other film festivals, including: the Auckland International Film Festival, New Zealand; the Copenhagen International Film Festival, Denmark; the Espoo Film Festival, Finland; the Telluride Film Festival, United States; the Toronto International Film Festival, Canada; the Vancouver International Film Festival, Canada; the Celebrating Literature in Cinema Film Festival Frankfurt, Germany; and the Morelia Film Festival, Mexico.

==Reception==
===Critical response===
&quot;The Motorcycle Diaries&quot; was released to very positive reviews by critics, and received a standing ovation at the 2004 Sundance Film Festival. &quot;The New York Times&quot; film critic, A.O. Scott, wrote that &quot;in Mr. Salles&#x27;s hands what might have been a schematic story of political awakening becomes a lyrical exploration of the sensations and perceptions from which a political understanding of the world emerges.&quot; Gregory Weinkauf of the &quot;Dallas Observer&quot; espoused that the film &quot;delivers as both biography and road movie, and proves itself a deceptively humble epic, an illuminating part of the Che legacy.&quot; Claudia Puig of &quot;USA Today&quot; postulated that &quot;the movie achieves an impressive blend of emotional resonance and light entertainment&quot; while describing it as &quot;more coming-of-age story than biopic&quot; and &quot;a transformative adventure well worth watching.&quot; Keri Petersen of &quot;The Gainesville Sun&quot; referred to the film as &quot;a gorgeous, poetic adventure.&quot;

Paula Nechak of the &quot;Seattle Post-Intelligencer&quot; praised director Salles by remarking that he &quot;presents the evolutionary course of a young man who coincidentally became the dorm-room poster boy for an idealistic generation, and captures the lovely, heart-and-eye-opening ode to youthful possibility with affection and compassion.&quot; &quot;Washington Post&quot; critic Desson Thomson lent praise for the film&#x27;s starring actor by observing that &quot;what Bernal and this well-wrought movie conveys so well is the charisma that would soon become a part of human history, and yes, T-shirts.&quot;

Among the film&#x27;s few detractors was Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;, who described the film&#x27;s positive reviews as &quot;a matter of political correctness, I think; it is uncool to be against Che Guevara.&quot; Ebert also criticized the film&#x27;s characterization: &quot;seen simply as a film, &quot;The Motorcycle Diaries&quot; is attenuated and tedious. We understand that Ernesto and Alberto are friends, but that&#x27;s about all we find out about them; they develop none of the complexities of other on-the-road couples... Nothing is startling or poetic.&quot; Jessica Winter of &quot;The Village Voice&quot; also criticized the film&#x27;s simplistic representation of the peasantry, describing &quot;the young men&#x27;s encounters with conscience-pricking, generically noble locals&quot; who are occasionally assembled &quot;to face the camera in a still life of heroic, art-directed suffering&quot;. The film also received criticism for its positive representation of Guevara as a youthful idealist. Anthony Daniels, an outspoken critic of Guevara&#x27;s, argued that the film helps to continue his wrongful glorification, noting &quot;The film is thus the cinematic equivalent of the Che Guevara T-shirt; it is morally monstrous and emotionally trivial.&quot; Frans Weiser agreed, saying that the film&#x27;s narrative is dominated by reductive images of Guevara as an idealistic, loveable rogue.

Online review aggregator Metacritic gives the film a score of 75 out of 100 based on 37 reviews, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;. Meanwhile, Rotten Tomatoes records an 83% approval rating based on 157 reviews, with an average rating of 7.5/10. The website&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;&quot;The Motorcycle Diaries&quot; is heartfelt and profound in its rendering of the formative experiences that turn Ernesto &quot;Che&quot; Guevara into a famous revolutionary.&quot; Furthermore, British historian Alex von Tunzelmann, who reviews films at &quot;The Guardian&quot; for historical accuracy, graded the film an A− in &quot;History&quot;, while giving the film a B in &quot;Entertainment&quot;. After comparing scenes from the film to the actual diaries, Tunzelmann posited that &quot;&quot;The Motorcycle Diaries&quot; gets a lot right, it&#x27;s an entertaining and accurate portrayal of the formative youth of a revolutionary icon.&quot;

====Oscars controversy====
The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences has very specific eligibility rules for (what was known at the time as) the Best Foreign Language Film Award. This film, being a co-production between many countries, was ruled ineligible because &quot;it didn&#x27;t have sufficient elements from any of the countries to qualify&quot;.

Focus Features co-president David Linde responded to the ruling by saying &quot;It&#x27;s a truly indigenous movie, but in this case that doesn&#x27;t mean one country, it means the world. The success of the film overseas affirms how audiences are loving it. We are moving ahead as planned when we bought it at Sundance.&quot; The film was campaigned for all the other categories it was eligible for, which was the majority of them.

<doc id="923270" wikidata="Q7708680" url="?curid=923270" title="Th' Dudes">
<text>Th&#x27; Dudes are a New Zealand rock band that was formed in the late 1970s in Auckland, New Zealand. Hits include &quot;Walking in Light&quot;, &quot;Right First Time&quot;, &quot;Be Mine Tonight&quot; and &quot;Bliss&quot;.

==History==
===1975–1980===
The band was formed by Morris, Urlich, Coleman and Dobbyn, students at Sacred Heart College in Auckland. The band name derived from the &quot;Lone Groover&quot; comic strip in the English music paper, &quot;NME&quot;. The band&#x27;s sound was heavily influenced by the British scene, especially The Beatles, David Bowie and The Rolling Stones, and later by the Punk and New Wave sounds of Iggy Pop, Elvis Costello, Nick Lowe, Roxy Music, The Stranglers and The Clash.

Starting off as a covers band that played surf clubs and private parties, Th&#x27; Dudes quickly earned a reputation as an energetic and skilful outfit featuring dual guitar work from Dobbyn and Morris, a tight no-nonsense rhythm section (Peter Coleman on bass, later replaced by Lez White, and drummer Bruce Hambling) and charismatic vocalist Urlich. Slowly the repertoire featured more originals and their status rose to the point where Th&#x27; Dudes were acclaimed NZ Group of the Year in 1979. The group disbanded in 1980.

===1990s-present===
The mid-1990s saw a resurgence of interest in Th&#x27; Dudes in New Zealand, when &quot;classic hits&quot; and &quot;classic rock&quot; radio became more prevalent, and the compositional, performance and production qualities of the band&#x27;s records endured. &quot;Bliss: 20 Essential New Zealand Classics&quot; and other compilations showcased New Zealand post-punk acts which epitomized the Kiwi rock genre. Th&#x27; Dudes&#x27;, &quot;Bliss&quot;, attained particular popularity and has since established itself as New Zealand&#x27;s unofficial national drinking song.

In October 2006, Th&#x27; Dudes embarked on a tour of New Zealand as part of Radio Hauraki&#x27;s 40th anniversary celebrations. The original tour was 11 dates, but quickly expanded to 17 shows due to demand. The band compiled a six-track album of demo and alternate versions of their biggest hits, culled from the band&#x27;s own collections. This CD was available only at shows on the tour and was called &quot;Pubs, Parks, Theatres, Clubs, Church Halls, Gardens, Lounges &amp; Band Rotundas&quot;.

In late 2007, Th&#x27; Dudes embarked on the &quot;Summer of Love&quot; tour.

In 2008, the band sued Stebbing Studios for non-payment of royalties. The band sought to show that they were not paid royalties for sales of their music due to their songs being recorded in downtime at Stebbing, but studio owner Eldred Stebbing claimed production costs had not been met. The dispute was resolved to both parties&#x27; mutual satisfaction in November 2008.

In 2019, the band announced a new tour of New Zealand, with dates from 9–25 April 2020, but it was postponed until November due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Ian Morris&#x27;s brother, Rikki Morris joined the group for the tour.

Ian Morris died suddenly in Napier on 7 October 2010. Prior to his death, Morris produced records and wrote advertising music, after having had a brief solo career under the stage name Tex Pistol. He is survived by his twin daughters, Julia and Maude.

<text>Ian Gordon Morris (22 January 1957 – 7 October 2010), also known by the stage name Tex Pistol, was a New Zealand musician, record producer, recording engineer and songwriter.

==Musical career==
Ian Morris and his brother Richard (who would also go on to become a successful singer, songwriter and sound engineer in New Zealand under the name Rikki Morris) were born in England but emigrated with their family to New Zealand in 1966. They attended Sacred Heart College, Auckland.

Ian was a founding member of iconic New Zealand band Th&#x27; Dudes, formed at Sacred Heart in 1975. He had chart hits as a solo artist under the name &quot;Tex Pistol&quot; (a name he took on because &quot;Ian Morris [didn&#x27;t] sound poppy enough&quot;), and in collaboration with his brother Rikki as &quot;Tex Pistol and Rikki Morris&quot;. As recording engineer and record producer, his production credits include a number of successful Kiwi artists: Hello Sailor, DD Smash, The Screaming Meemees, Naked Spots Dance, The Warratahs, When the Cat&#x27;s Away, Greg Johnson, Dave Dobbyn, and Southside of Bombay to name a few. Morris also wrote numerous jingles, arrangements, and orchestrations.

== Personal life ==
Morris was married to singer Kim Willoughby of New Zealand&#x27;s most successful all-female group &quot;When the Cat&#x27;s Away&quot;, with whom he had two daughters, Julia and Maude, and a stepson, James. He was separated from his wife at the time of his death.

===Death ===
Morris had been suffering from depression and died by suicide at Te Pania Hotel in Napier on 7 October 2010. Police noted that there were no suspicious circumstances to his death.

Morris was posthumously inducted into the New Zealand Music Hall of Fame.

<text>Peter Urlich (born 1956 in Auckland) is a New Zealand musician. He is the cousin of fellow New Zealand singer Margaret Urlich.

==Early years==
Urlich was educated at Sacred Heart College in the suburb of Glen Innes, Auckland.
Son of Daniel and Ruby Urlich, he is the youngest of six children.

==Th&#x27; Dudes==

In 1975, he and Dave Dobbyn formed Th&#x27; Dudes with Ian Morris. After Th&#x27; Dudes split in 1980, Urlich headed off to the UK where he was fascinated by the rise of club culture. Returning to New Zealand in 1981, he approached writer Mark Phillips and they opened their first club in a run down bar in Auckland&#x27;s Albert Street. Called &quot;A Certain Bar&quot;, it was an immediate success and over the next decade, he and Phillips ran a succession of successful clubs. These were hugely influential in establishing a contemporary club scene in Auckland.

In 1986 Urlich and Phillips were partners in Stimulant Records with Simon Grigg. The label released the album &quot;Eight Arms to Hold You&quot;, the first New Zealand club music collection.

==1990s==

In the 1990s Urlich returned to performing and had residencies in Auckland as the vocalist with The Lawrence Quintet. In 1995 he began a Saturday morning radio show on 95bFm. His initial partner was DJ Phil Clark, however he was replaced in 1996 by Bevan Keys and the show, &quot;Nice&#x27;n&#x27;Urlich&quot;, with its mix of Urlich&#x27;s chat and Key&#x27;s soulful house music selection, became a hit. Taking the show to clubs also proved hugely popular and for the next decade Nice&#x27;n&#x27;Urlich sold out increasingly larger venues. In 1999 the duo were signed to Simon Grigg&#x27;s Huh Records. The three Nice&#x27;n&#x27;Urlich albums sold over 60,000 albums in New Zealand.

In 1999 Urlich co-starred in a New Zealand reality show, &quot;Popstars&quot; (arguably the inspiration for the worldwide &quot;Idol&quot; phenomenon), which was a hunt for people to form a pop band, and to perform and produce an album (the winners formed a band named TrueBliss). His role in the show was that of manager.

==2000s==

In 2000 Urlich and Grigg released the first of their &quot;Room Service&quot; compilations of lounge music, once again for Huh. The three volumes sold in excess of 150,000 across Australia and New Zealand. The Room Service brand was also used on a 1970s soul collection, &quot;Soul Food&quot;, which went gold in 2003. The pair also compiled &quot;Welcome To&quot;, a collection of original New Zealand house music in 2001.

In 2002, Urlich launched The P.U.B.E. (Peter Urlich Breakfast Experience) on Auckland station George FM. In 2008, he appeared on New Zealand TV shows &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot; and &quot;Pop&#x27;s Ultimate Star&quot;. His album of covers of lounge classics, &quot;Between You &amp; Me&quot;, was released by Liberation Music, in May 2008.

Urlich hosted &quot;Nice n&#x27; Urlich&quot; Saturday mornings on Auckland station George FM, before leaving to establish The P.U.B.E. radio station exclusively on the Radio Schmadio mobile app. He is also the manager of the Pt Chev Pirates, a club in Auckland Rugby League&#x27;s Phelan Shield.

<doc id="923276" wikidata="Q6595972" url="?curid=923276" title="List of Royal Canadian Navy bases (1911–1968)">
<text>This is a list of shore-based facilities operated by the Royal Canadian Navy (RCN) from its creation in 1911 until unification into the Canadian Forces on February 1, 1968.

All RCN shore-based facilities in this period followed the naming tradition of the Royal Navy, whereby the prefix HMCS or Naval Radio Station (NRS), was affixed. This tradition is somewhat maintained under the RCN&#x27;s successor, Canadian Forces Maritime Command where certain facilities such as HMCS &quot;Trinity&quot; and NRS Aldergrove, are still formally referred to in this fashion, likely out of tradition, however the entire bases at the deep water ports of Victoria and Halifax are now referred to as a &quot;Canadian Forces Base&quot; or &quot;CFB&quot;. For Canadian Forces Bases operated by the modern Royal Canadian Navy see Canadian Forces Bases#Royal Canadian Navy.

<doc id="923283" wikidata="Q143431" url="?curid=923283" title="Chile at the 2004 Summer Olympics">
<text>Chile competed at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece, from 13 to 29 August 2004. 

Chilean Olympic Committee (, &quot;COCH&quot;) sent a total of 22 athletes to the Games, 16 men and 6 women, to compete in 11 sports; the nation&#x27;s team size was roughly smaller from Sydney by almost half of the athletes, due to the absence of the men&#x27;s football team. Six Chilean athletes had previously competed in Sydney, including tennis star and top medal favorite Nicolás Massú. Long-distance freestyle swimmer and Pan American Games bronze medalist Kristel Köbrich set a historic milestone as the nation&#x27;s first ever female flag bearer in the opening ceremony, wearing and parading with a traditional Chilean costume.

Chile left Athens with a remarkable historic milestone from tennis players Nicolás Massú and Fernando González, as they picked up the grand slam Olympic title for the Chilean team in the men&#x27;s doubles tournament. While Gonzalez collected a bronze in his match against U.S. tennis player Taylor Dent, Massu summoned his strength to defeat Dent&#x27;s teammate Mardy Fish with a striking effort to complete the Chilean party on the Olympic tennis court, and most significantly, to snatch his second gold medal in the men&#x27;s singles.

<text>DD Smash was a New Zealand pop/rock band formed in 1980 by Dave Dobbyn after the breakup of Th&#x27; Dudes. The band briefly used the name &quot;Dave Dobbyn&#x27;s Divers&quot; until drummer Peter Warren came up with &quot;DD Smash&quot;. Dobbyn says the name &quot;seemed to say everything about what we were into, which was having a jolly good time and blasting out music.&quot;

==History==
DD Smash formed in 1980. By late &#x27;81, DD Smash signed a recording deal and immediately set about recording their debut album, with Ian Morris as producer.

DD Smash released their debut album in 1982. Titled &quot;Cool Bananas&quot; it debuted at number 1 in New Zealand and was certified triple gold. 

DD Smash split during the mid-1980s when Dave Dobbyn began recording by himself.

In 2015, as part of the 40th anniversary celebrations of the New Zealand Music Charts, Recorded Music NZ honoured DD Smash&#x27;s debut album &quot;Cool Bananas&quot; as being the first album by a New Zealand artist to debut at No.1 on the album chart.

<doc id="923289" wikidata="Q5566392" url="?curid=923289" title="Gladys Brockwell">
<text>Gladys Brockwell (née Lindeman; September 26, 1894 – July 2, 1929) was an American actress whose career began during the silent film era.

==Early life and career==

Brockwell was born Gladys Lindeman in Brooklyn, New York, on September 26, 1894. Her father was H.R. Lindeman. Her mother, Lillian Lindeman ( Voltaire), a chorus girl turned actress, put her daughter on stage at an early age. By age 7, Brockwell was performing in dramatic productions with a stock company in Williamsport, West Virginia. By the time Gladys was 14, she played leading roles, and when she was 17 she had her own company. She took on the stage name Gladys Brockwell, and made her film debut in 1913 for Lubin Studios. Within a short time she was starring in a number of films. Developing her craft, she moved to Hollywood where she garnered a role in the acclaimed 1922 version of &quot;Oliver Twist&quot; and in &quot;The Hunchback of Notre Dame&quot; the following year.

Her mother Lillian took to the screen in 1914 and also adopted the surname Brockwell, first as Lillian Brockwell then as Billie Brockwell, achieving fame in her own right but after her daughter. The name Brockwell appears to be a corruption of Gladys&#x27; fiance&#x27;s surname, Broadwell but may stem from a remarriage of Lillian around 1907 or 1908, with both mother and daughter taking a new surname.

By the mid-1920s, she was past the age of 30 and although still given top female billing, Brockwell performed mainly in supporting roles. Regarded as one of the finest character actresses of the day who not only adapted to sound films but excelled in them, her first appearance in a &quot;talkie&quot; came in 1928 in &quot;Lights of New York&quot;. Her performance received strong reviews at the time of the film&#x27;s release as well as by present-day critics of the preserved film.

A Warner Bros. feature-length production, &quot;Lights of New York&quot; was filmed with microphones strategically hidden around the sets, creating the first motion picture released with fully synchronic dialogue. She was then signed by Warner Bros. and was looking forward to continued success in talkies. She died in an automobile accident in 1929.

==Personal life==
Brockwell married actor Robert B. Broadwell on March 3, 1915. They separated on September 1, 1915, due to &quot;Much quarreling and unpleasantness generally,&quot; as she told the court when she sought a divorce in March 1918. &quot;We never seemed to agree on anything,&quot; she added. Los Angeles Judge Jackson granted her divorce decree on March 13, 1918, on grounds of desertion.

On July 1, 1918, she married Harry Edwards, a film director, but the marriage was annulled the next year.

==Death==

Brockwell died in Hollywood Hospital in Los Angeles on July 2, 1929, of peritonitis that resulted from internal injuries from an automobile accident.

On June 27, 1929, Brockwell and a friend, Thomas Stanely Brennan, were involved in an automobile accident near Calabasas, California. Brennan, a Los Angeles advertising man, was driving when the automobile went over a embankment on the Ventura Highway near Calabasas. She was crushed beneath the automobile.

She underwent four blood transfusions as part of the effort to save her life, the last just before her death. Following a second blood transfusion, Brockwell appeared to improve until peritonitis set in from her internal injuries, particularly a puncture of her large intestine. Brennan recovered after sustaining serious injuries. He said a bit of dust had blown into his eye, temporarily blinding him. No negligence was placed on Brennan, who was still recovering in the hospital. Brockwell&#x27;s final film, &quot;The Drake Case&quot;, was directed by Edward Laemmle while she was on loan to Universal Pictures, and was released posthumously in September 1929.

Gladys Brockwell was cremated at Hollywood Cemetery and her ashes given to her mother. Her ashes now lie with her mother in the columbarium of Inglewood Park Cemetery.

<text>Léonard Joseph Léon Faucher (; 8 September 1803 – 14 December 1854) was a French politician and economist.

==Biography==
Faucher was born at Limoges, Haute-Vienne. When he was nine years old the family moved to Toulouse, where the boy was sent to school. His parents were separated in 1816, and Léon Faucher, who resisted his father&#x27;s attempts to put him to a trade, helped to support himself and his mother during the rest of his school career by designing embroidery and needlework. As a private tutor in Paris he continued his studies in the direction of archaeology and history, but with the revolution of 1830 he was drawn into active political journalism on the Liberal side. He was on the staff of the &quot;Temps&quot; from 1830 to 1833, when he became editor of the &quot;Constitutionnel&quot; for a short time. A Sunday journal of his own, &quot;Le Bien public&quot;, proved a disastrous financial failure; and his political independence having caused his retirement from the &quot;Constitutionnel&quot;, he joined in 1834 &quot;Le Courrier français&quot;, of which he was editor from 1839 until 1842, when the paper changed hands.
Faucher was an early member of the Société d&#x27;économie politique organized in 1842 by Pellegrino Rossi. He belonged in policy to the dynastic Left, and consistently preached moderation to the more ardent Liberals. On resigning his connection with the &quot;Courrier français&quot; he gave his attention chiefly to many economic questions. He advocated a customs union between the Latin countries to counterbalance the German Zollverein, and in view of the impracticability of such a measure narrowed his proposal in 1842 to a customs union between France and Belgium.He helped to organize the Bordeaux association for free-trade propaganda, and it was as an advocate of free trade that he was elected in 1847 to the chamber of deputies for Reims.

After the revolution of 1848 he entered the Constituent Assembly for the department of Marne, where he opposed many Republican measures – the limitation of the hours of labour, the creation of the national relief works in Paris, the abolition of the death penalty and others. Under the presidency of Louis Napoleon he became minister of public works, and then minister of the interior, but his action in seeking to influence the coming elections by a circular letter addressed to the prefects was censured by the Constituent Assembly, and he was compelled to resign office on 14 May 1849. In 1851 he was again minister of the interior until Napoleon declared his intention of resorting to universal suffrage. After the coup d&#x27;état of December he refused a seat in the consultative commission instituted by Napoleon. He had been elected a member of the Academy of Moral and Political Science in 1849, and his retirement from politics permitted a return to his writings on economics. He had been to Italy in search of health in 1854, and was returning to Paris on business when he was seized by typhoid at Marseille, where he died.

==Works==
In 1843 Faucher visited England to study the English social system, publishing the results of his investigations in a noted series of &quot;Etudes sur l&#x27;Angleterre&quot; (2 vols., 1845), published originally in the &quot;Revue des deux mondes&quot;.

His miscellaneous writings were collected (2 vols., 1856) as &quot;Mélanges d&#x27;economie politique et de finance&quot;, and his speeches in the legislature are printed in vol. ii. of &quot;&quot; (2 vols., 2nd ed., Paris, 1875).

<text>Seismic retrofitting is the modification of existing structures to make them more resistant to seismic activity, ground motion, or soil failure due to earthquakes. With better understanding of seismic demand on structures and with recent experiences with large earthquakes near urban centers, the need of seismic retrofitting is well acknowledged. Prior to the introduction of modern seismic codes in the late 1960s for developed countries (US, Japan etc.) and late 1970s for many other parts of the world (Turkey, China etc.), many structures were designed without adequate detailing and reinforcement for seismic protection. In view of the imminent problem, various research work has been carried out. State-of-the-art technical guidelines for seismic assessment, retrofit and rehabilitation have been published around the world – such as the ASCE-SEI 41 and the New Zealand Society for Earthquake Engineering (NZSEE)&#x27;s guidelines. These codes must be regularly updated; the 1994 Northridge earthquake brought to light the brittleness of welded steel frames, for example.

The retrofit techniques outlined here are also applicable for other natural hazards such as tropical cyclones, tornadoes, and severe winds from thunderstorms. Whilst current practice of seismic retrofitting is predominantly concerned with structural improvements to reduce the seismic hazard of using the structures, it is similarly essential to reduce the hazards and losses from non-structural elements. It is also important to keep in mind that there is no such thing as an earthquake-proof structure, although seismic performance can be greatly enhanced through proper initial design or subsequent modifications.



==Strategies==
Seismic retrofit (or rehabilitation) strategies have been developed in the past few decades following the introduction of new seismic provisions and the availability of advanced materials (e.g. fiber-reinforced polymers (FRP), fiber reinforced concrete and high strength steel).

*Increasing the global capacity (strengthening). This is typically done by the addition of cross braces or new structural walls.
*Reduction of the seismic demand by means of supplementary damping and/or use of base isolation systems.
*Increasing the local capacity of structural elements. This strategy recognises the inherent capacity within the existing structures, and therefore adopts a more cost-effective approach to selectively upgrade local capacity (deformation/ductility, strength or stiffness) of individual structural components.
*Selective weakening retrofit. This is a counter-intuitive strategy to change the inelastic mechanism of the structure, while recognising the inherent capacity of the structure.
*Allowing sliding connections such as passageway bridges to accommodate additional movement between seismically independent structures.
*Addition of seismic friction dampers to simultaneously add damping and a selectable amount of additional stiffness.
Recently more holistic approaches to building retrofitting are being explored, including combined seismic and energy retrofitting. Such combined strategies aim to exploit cost savings by applying energy retrofitting and seismic strengthening interventions at once, hence improving the seismic and thermal performance of buildings.

==Performance objectives==
In the past, seismic retrofit was primarily applied to achieve public safety, with engineering solutions limited by economic and political considerations. However, with the development of Performance-based earthquake engineering (PBEE), several levels of performance objectives are gradually recognised:

*Public safety only. The goal is to protect human life, ensuring that the structure will not collapse upon its occupants or passersby, and that the structure can be safely exited. Under severe seismic conditions the structure may be a total economic write-off, requiring tear-down and replacement.
*Structure survivability. The goal is that the structure, while remaining safe for exit, may require extensive repair (but not replacement) before it is generally useful or considered safe for occupation. This is typically the lowest level of retrofit applied to bridges.
*Structure functionality. Primary structure undamaged and the structure is undiminished in utility for its primary application. A high level of retrofit, this ensures that any required repairs are only &quot;cosmetic&quot; – for example, minor cracks in plaster, drywall and stucco. This is the minimum acceptable level of retrofit for hospitals.
*Structure unaffected. This level of retrofit is preferred for historic structures of high cultural significance.

==Techniques==
Common seismic retrofitting techniques fall into several categories:

===External post-tensioning===
The use of external post-tensioning for new structural systems have been developed in the past decade. Under the PRESS (Precast Seismic Structural Systems), a large-scale U.S./Japan joint research program, unbonded post-tensioning high strength steel tendons have been used to achieve a moment-resisting system that has self-centering capacity. 
An extension of the same idea for seismic retrofitting has been experimentally tested for seismic retrofit of California bridges under a Caltrans research project and for seismic retrofit of non-ductile reinforced concrete frames. Pre-stressing can increase the capacity of structural elements such as beam, column and beam-column joints. External pre-stressing has been used for structural upgrade for gravity/live loading since the 1970s.

===Base isolators===

&quot;Base isolation&quot; is a collection of structural elements of a building that should substantially decouple the building&#x27;s structure from the shaking ground thus protecting the building&#x27;s integrity and enhancing its seismic performance. This earthquake engineering technology, which is a kind of seismic vibration control, can be applied both to a newly designed building and to seismic upgrading of existing structures. 
Normally, excavations are made around the building and the building is separated from the foundations. Steel or reinforced concrete beams replace the connections to the foundations, while under these, the isolating pads, or base isolators, replace the material removed. While the base isolation tends to restrict transmission of the ground motion to the building, it also keeps the building positioned properly over the foundation. Careful attention to detail is required where the building interfaces with the ground, especially at entrances, stairways and ramps, to ensure sufficient relative motion of those structural elements.

===Supplementary dampers===
Supplementary dampers absorb the energy of motion and convert it to heat, thus damping resonant effects in structures that are rigidly attached to the ground. In addition to adding energy dissipation capacity to the structure, supplementary damping can reduce the displacement and acceleration demand within the structures. In some cases, the threat of damage does not come from the initial shock itself, but rather from the periodic resonant motion of the structure that repeated ground motion induces. In the practical sense, supplementary dampers act similarly to Shock absorbers used in automotive suspensions.

===Tuned mass dampers===
Tuned mass dampers (TMD) employ movable weights on some sort of springs. These are typically employed to reduce wind sway in very tall, light buildings. Similar designs may be employed to impart earthquake resistance in eight to ten story buildings that are prone to destructive earthquake induced resonances.

===Slosh tank===
A slosh tank is a large container of low viscosity fluid (usually water) that may be placed at locations in a structure where lateral swaying motions are significant, such as the roof, and tuned to counter the local resonant dynamic motion. During a seismic (or wind) event the fluid in the tank will slosh back and forth with the fluid motion usually directed and controlled by internal baffles – partitions that prevent the tank itself becoming resonant with the structure, &quot;see Slosh dynamics&quot;. The net dynamic response of the overall structure is reduced due to both the counteracting movement of mass, as well as energy dissipation or vibration damping which occurs when the fluid&#x27;s kinetic energy is converted to heat by the baffles. Generally the temperature rise in the system will be minimal and is passively cooled by the surrounding air. One Rincon Hill in San Francisco is a skyscraper with a rooftop slosh tank which was designed primarily to reduce the magnitude of lateral swaying motion from wind. A slosh tank is a passive tuned mass damper. In order to be effective the mass of the liquid is usually on the order of 1% to 5% of the mass it is counteracting, and often this requires a significant volume of liquid. In some cases these systems are designed to double as emergency water cisterns for fire suppression.

===Active control system===
Very tall buildings (&quot;skyscrapers&quot;), when built using modern lightweight materials, might sway uncomfortably (but not dangerously) in certain wind conditions. A solution to this problem is to include at some upper story a large mass, constrained, but free to move within a limited range, and moving on some sort of bearing system such as an air cushion or hydraulic film. Hydraulic pistons, powered by electric pumps and accumulators, are actively driven to counter the wind forces and natural resonances. These may also, if properly designed, be effective in controlling excessive motion – with or without applied power – in an earthquake. In general, though, modern steel frame high rise buildings are not as subject to dangerous motion as are medium rise (eight to ten story) buildings, as the resonant period of a tall and massive building is longer than the approximately one second shocks applied by an earthquake.

===Ad hoc addition of structural support/reinforcement===
The most common form of seismic retrofit to lower buildings is adding strength to the existing structure to resist seismic forces. The strengthening may be limited to connections between existing building elements or it may involve adding primary resisting elements such as walls or frames, particularly in the lower stories. Common retrofit measures for unreinforced masonry buildings in the Western United States include the addition of steel frames, the addition of reinforced concrete walls, and in some cases, the addition of base isolation.

====Connections between buildings and their expansion additions ====
Frequently, building additions will not be strongly connected to the existing structure, but simply placed adjacent to it, with only minor continuity in flooring, siding, and roofing. As a result, the addition may have a different resonant period than the original structure, and they may easily detach from one another. The relative motion will then cause the two parts to collide, causing severe structural damage. Seismic modification will either tie the two building components rigidly together so that they behave as a single mass or it will employ dampers to expend the energy from relative motion, with appropriate allowance for this motion, such as increased spacing and sliding bridges between sections.

==== Exterior reinforcement of building ====

====Exterior concrete columns====
Historic buildings, made of unreinforced masonry, may have culturally important interior detailing or murals that should not be disturbed. In this case, the solution may be to add a number of steel, reinforced concrete, or poststressed concrete columns to the exterior. Careful attention must be paid to the connections with other members such as footings, top plates, and roof trusses.

====Infill shear trusses====

Shown here is an exterior shear reinforcement of a conventional reinforced concrete dormitory building. In this case, there was sufficient vertical strength in the building columns and sufficient shear strength in the lower stories that only limited shear reinforcement was required to make it earthquake resistant for this location near the Hayward fault.

====Massive exterior structure====

In other circumstances, far greater reinforcement is required. In the structure shown at right – a parking garage over shops – the placement, detailing, and painting of the reinforcement becomes itself an architectural embellishment.

==Typical retrofit solutions==

===Soft-story failure===

This collapse mode is known as &quot;soft story collapse&quot;. In many buildings the ground level is designed for different uses than the upper levels. Low rise residential structures may be built over a parking garage which have large doors on one side. Hotels may have a tall ground floor to allow for a grand entrance or ballrooms. Office buildings may have retail stores on the ground floor with continuous display windows.

Traditional seismic design assumes that the lower stories of a building are stronger than the upper stories; where this is not the case—if the lower story is less strong than the upper structure—the structure will not respond to earthquakes in the expected fashion. Using modern design methods, it is possible to take a weak lower story into account. Several failures of this type in one large apartment complex caused most of the fatalities in the 1994 Northridge earthquake.

Typically, where this type of problem is found, the weak story is reinforced to make it stronger than the floors above by adding shear walls or moment frames. Moment frames consisting of inverted U bents are useful in preserving lower story garage access, while a lower cost solution may be to use shear walls or trusses in several locations, which partially reduce the usefulness for automobile parking but still allow the space to be used for other storage.

===Beam-column joint connections===

Beam-column joint connections are a common structural weakness in dealing with seismic retrofitting. Prior to the introduction of modern seismic codes in early 1970s, beam-column joints were typically non-engineered or designed. Laboratory testings have confirmed the seismic vulnerability of these poorly detailed and under-designed connections. Failure of beam-column joint connections can typically lead to catastrophic collapse of a frame-building, as often observed in recent earthquakes

For reinforced concrete beam-column joints – various retrofit solutions have been proposed and tested in the past 20 years. Philosophically, the various seismic retrofit strategies discussed above can be implemented for reinforced concrete joints. Concrete or steel jacketing have been a popular retrofit technique until the advent of composite materials such as Carbon fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP). Composite materials such as carbon FRP and aramic FRP have been extensively tested for use in seismic retrofit with some success. One novel technique includes the use of selective weakening of the beam and added external post-tensioning to the joint in order to achieve flexural hinging in the beam, which is more desirable in terms of seismic design.

Widespread weld failures at beam-column joints of low-to-medium rise steel buildings during the Northridge 1994 earthquake for example, have shown the structural defiencies of these &#x27;modern-designed&#x27; post-1970s welded moment-resisting connections. A subsequent SAC research project has documented, tested and proposed several retrofit solutions for these welded steel moment-resisting connections. Various retrofit solutions have been developed for these welded joints – such as a) weld strengthening and b) addition of steel haunch or &#x27;dog-bone&#x27; shape flange.

Following the Northridge earthquake, a number of steel moment -frame buildings were found to have experienced brittle fractures of beam to column connections. Discovery of these unanticipated brittle fractures of framing connections was alarming to engineers and the building industry. Starting in the 1960s, engineers began to regard welded steel moment-frame buildings as being among the most ductile systems contained in the building code. Many engineers believed that steel moment-frame buildings were essentially invulnerable to earthquake induced damage and thought that should damage occur, it would be limited to ductile yielding of members and connections. Observation of damage sustained by buildings in the 1994 Northridge earthquake indicated that contrary to the intended behavior, in many cases, brittle fractures initiated within the connections at very low levels of plastic demand. In September 1994, The SAC joint Venture, AISC, AISI, and NIST jointly convened an international workshop in Los Angeles to coordinate the efforts of various participants and to lay the foundation for systematic investigation and resolution of the problem. In September 1995 the SAC Joint Venture entered into a contractual agreement with FEMA to conduct Phase II of the SAC Steel project. Under Phase II, SAC continued its extensive problem-focused study of the performance of moment resisting steel frames and connections of various configurations, with the ultimate goal of developing seismic design criteria for steel construction. As a result of these studies it is now known that the typical moment-resisting connection detail employed in steel moment frame construction prior to the 1994 Northridge earthquake had a number of features that rendered it inherently susceptible to brittle fracture.

===Shear failure within floor diaphragm===
Floors in wooden buildings are usually constructed upon relatively deep spans of wood, called joists, covered with a diagonal wood planking or plywood to form a subfloor upon which the finish floor surface is laid. In many structures these are all aligned in the same direction. To prevent the beams from tipping over onto their side, blocking is used at each end, and for additional stiffness, blocking or diagonal wood or metal bracing may be placed between beams at one or more points in their spans. At the outer edge it is typical to use a single depth of blocking and a perimeter beam overall.

If the blocking or nailing is inadequate, each beam can be laid flat by the shear forces applied to the building. In this position they lack most of their original strength and the structure may further collapse. As part of a retrofit the blocking may be doubled, especially at the outer edges of the building. It may be appropriate to add additional nails between the sill plate of the perimeter wall erected upon the floor diaphragm, although this will require exposing the sill plate by removing interior plaster or exterior siding. As the sill plate may be quite old and dry and substantial nails must be used, it may be necessary to pre-drill a hole for the nail in the old wood to avoid splitting. When the wall is opened for this purpose it may also be appropriate to tie vertical wall elements into the foundation using specialty connectors and bolts glued with epoxy cement into holes drilled in the foundation.

===Sliding off foundation and &quot;cripple wall&quot; failure===
Single or two-story wood-frame domestic structures built on a perimeter or slab foundation are relatively safe in an earthquake, but in many structures built before 1950 the sill plate that sits between the concrete foundation and the floor diaphragm (perimeter foundation) or studwall (slab foundation) may not be sufficiently bolted in. Additionally, older attachments (without substantial corrosion-proofing) may have corroded to a point of weakness. A sideways shock can slide the building entirely off of the foundations or slab.

Often such buildings, especially if constructed on a moderate slope, are erected on a platform connected to a perimeter foundation through low stud-walls called &quot;cripple wall&quot; or &quot;pin-up&quot;. This low wall structure itself may fail in shear or in its connections to itself at the corners, leading to the building moving diagonally and collapsing the low walls. The likelihood of failure of the pin-up can be reduced by ensuring that the corners are well reinforced in shear and that the shear panels are well connected to each other through the corner posts. This requires structural grade sheet plywood, often treated for rot resistance. This grade of plywood is made without interior unfilled knots and with more, thinner layers than common plywood. New buildings designed to resist earthquakes will typically use OSB (oriented strand board), sometimes with metal joins between panels, and with well attached stucco covering to enhance its performance. In many modern tract homes, especially those built upon expansive (clay) soil the building is constructed upon a single and relatively thick monolithic slab, kept in one piece by high tensile rods that are stressed after the slab has set. This poststressing places the concrete under compression – a condition under which it is extremely strong in bending and so will not crack under adverse soil conditions.

===Multiple piers in shallow pits===
Some older low-cost structures are elevated on tapered concrete pylons set into shallow pits, a method frequently used to attach outdoor decks to existing buildings. This is seen in conditions of damp soil, especially in tropical conditions, as it leaves a dry ventilated space under the house, and in far northern conditions of permafrost (frozen mud) as it keeps the building&#x27;s warmth from destabilizing the ground beneath. During an earthquake, the pylons may tip, spilling the building to the ground. This can be overcome by using deep-bored holes to contain cast-in-place reinforced pylons, which are then secured to the floor panel at the corners of the building. Another technique is to add sufficient diagonal bracing or sections of concrete shear wall between pylons.

===Reinforced concrete column burst===

Reinforced concrete columns typically contain large diameter vertical rebar (reinforcing bars) arranged in a ring, surrounded by lighter-gauge hoops of rebar. Upon analysis of failures due to earthquakes, it has been realized that the weakness was not in the vertical bars, but rather in inadequate strength and quantity of hoops. Once the integrity of the hoops is breached, the vertical rebar can flex outward, stressing the central column of concrete. The concrete then simply crumbles into small pieces, now unconstrained by the surrounding rebar. In new construction a greater amount of hoop-like structures are used.

One simple retrofit is to surround the column with a jacket of steel plates formed and welded into a single cylinder. The space between the jacket and the column is then filled with concrete, a process called grouting. Where soil or structure conditions require such additional modification, additional pilings may be driven near the column base and concrete pads linking the pilings to the pylon are fabricated at or below ground level. In the example shown not all columns needed to be modified to gain sufficient seismic resistance for the conditions expected. (This location is about a mile from the Hayward Fault Zone.)

===Reinforced concrete wall burst===
Concrete walls are often used at the transition between elevated road fill and overpass structures. The wall is used both to retain the soil and so enable the use of a shorter span and also to transfer the weight of the span directly downward to footings in undisturbed soil. If these walls are inadequate they may crumble under the stress of an earthquake&#x27;s induced ground motion.

One form of retrofit is to drill numerous holes into the surface of the wall, and secure short L-shaped sections of rebar to the surface of each hole with epoxy adhesive. Additional vertical and horizontal rebar is then secured to the new elements, a form is erected, and an additional layer of concrete is poured. This modification may be combined with additional footings in excavated trenches and additional support ledgers and tie-backs to retain the span on the bounding walls.

===Damage to masonry (infill) walls ===
In masonry structures, brick building structures have been reinforced with coatings of glass fiber and appropriate resin (epoxy or polyester). In lower floors these may be applied over entire exposed surfaces, while in upper floors this may be confined to narrow areas around window and door openings. This application provides tensile strength that stiffens the wall against bending away from the side with the application. The efficient protection of an entire building requires extensive analysis and engineering to determine the appropriate locations to be treated.

In reinforced concrete buildings, masonry infill walls are considered non-structural elements, but damage to infills can lead to large repair costs and change the behaviour of a structure, even leading to aforementioned soft-storey or beam-column joint shear failures. Local failure of the infill panels due to in and out-of-plane mechanisms, but also due to their combination, can lead to a sudden drop in capacity and hence cause global brittle failure of the structure. Even at lower intensity earthquakes, damage to infilled frames can lead to high economic losses and loss of life.

To prevent masonry infill damage and failure, typical retrofit strategies aim to strengthen the infills and provide adequate connection to the frame. Examples of retrofit techniques for masonry infills include steel reinforced plasters, engineered cementitious composites, thin layers fibre-reinforced polymers (FRP), and most recently also textile-reinforced mortars (TRM).

===Lift===
Where moist or poorly consolidated alluvial soil interfaces in a &quot;beach like&quot; structure against underlying firm material, seismic waves traveling through the alluvium can be amplified, just as are water waves against a sloping beach. In these special conditions, vertical accelerations up to twice the force of gravity have been measured. If a building is not secured to a well-embedded foundation it is possible for the building to be thrust from (or with) its foundations into the air, usually with severe damage upon landing. Even if it is well-founded, higher portions such as upper stories or roof structures or attached structures such as canopies and porches may become detached from the primary structure.

Good practices in modern, earthquake-resistant structures dictate that there be good vertical connections throughout every component of the building, from undisturbed or engineered earth to foundation to sill plate to vertical studs to plate cap through each floor and continuing to the roof structure. Above the foundation and sill plate the connections are typically made using steel strap or sheet stampings, nailed to wood members using special hardened high-shear strength nails, and heavy angle stampings secured with through bolts, using large washers to prevent pull-through. Where inadequate bolts are provided between the sill plates and a foundation in existing construction (or are not trusted due to possible corrosion), special clamp plates may be added, each of which is secured to the foundation using expansion bolts inserted into holes drilled in an exposed face of concrete. Other members must then be secured to the sill plates with additional fittings.

===Soil===
One of the most difficult retrofits is that required to prevent damage due to soil failure. Soil failure can occur on a slope, a slope failure or landslide, or in a flat area due to liquefaction of water-saturated sand and/or mud. Generally, deep pilings must be driven into stable soil (typically hard mud or sand) or to underlying bedrock or the slope must be stabilized. For buildings built atop previous landslides the practicality of retrofit may be limited by economic factors, as it is not practical to stabilize a large, deep landslide. The likelihood of landslide or soil failure may also depend upon seasonal factors, as the soil may be more stable at the beginning of a wet season than at the beginning of the dry season. Such a &quot;two season&quot; &quot;Mediterranean climate&quot; is seen throughout California.

In some cases, the best that can be done is to reduce the entrance of water runoff from higher, stable elevations by capturing and bypassing through channels or pipes, and to drain water infiltrated directly and from subsurface springs by inserting horizontal perforated tubes. There are numerous locations in California where extensive developments have been built atop archaic landslides, which have not moved in historic times but which (if both water-saturated and shaken by an earthquake) have a high probability of moving &quot;en masse&quot;, carrying entire sections of suburban development to new locations. While the most modern of house structures (well tied to monolithic concrete foundation slabs reinforced with post tensioning cables) may survive such movement largely intact, the building will no longer be in its proper location.

===Utility pipes and cables: risks===
Natural gas and propane supply pipes to structures often prove especially dangerous during and after earthquakes. Should a building move from its foundation or fall due to cripple wall collapse, the ductile iron pipes transporting the gas within the structure may be broken, typically at the location of threaded joints. The gas may then still be provided to the pressure regulator from higher pressure lines and so continue to flow in substantial quantities; it may then be ignited by a nearby source such as a lit pilot light or arcing electrical connection.

There are two primary methods of automatically restraining the flow of gas after an earthquake, installed on the low pressure side of the regulator, and usually downstream of the gas meter.
*A caged metal ball may be arranged at the edge of an orifice. Upon seismic shock, the ball will roll into the orifice, sealing it to prevent gas flow. The ball may later be reset by the use of an external magnet. This device will respond only to ground motion.
*A flow-sensitive device may be used to close a valve if the flow of gas exceeds a set threshold (very much like an electrical circuit breaker). This device will operate independently of seismic motion, but will not respond to minor leaks which may be caused by an earthquake.

It appears that the most secure configuration would be to use one of each of these devices in series.

===Tunnels===
Unless the tunnel penetrates a fault likely to slip, the greatest danger to tunnels is a landslide blocking an entrance. Additional protection around the entrance may be applied to divert any falling material (similar as is done to divert snow avalanches) or the slope above the tunnel may be stabilized in some way. Where only small- to medium-sized rocks and boulders are expected to fall, the entire slope may be covered with wire mesh, pinned down to the slope with metal rods. This is also a common modification to highway cuts where appropriate conditions exist.

===Underwater tubes===
The safety of underwater tubes is highly dependent upon the soil conditions through which the tunnel was constructed, the materials and reinforcements used, and the maximum predicted earthquake expected, and other factors, some of which may remain unknown under current knowledge.

====BART tube====
A tube of particular structural, seismic, economic, and political interest is the BART (Bay Area Rapid Transit) transbay tube. This tube was constructed at the bottom of San Francisco Bay through an innovative process. Rather than pushing a shield through the soft bay mud, the tube was constructed on land in sections. Each section consisted of two inner train tunnels of circular cross section, a central access tunnel of rectangular cross section, and an outer oval shell encompassing the three inner tubes. The intervening space was filled with concrete. At the bottom of the bay a trench was excavated and a flat bed of crushed stone prepared to receive the tube sections. The sections were then floated into place and sunk, then joined with bolted connections to previously placed sections. An overfill was then placed atop the tube to hold it down. Once completed from San Francisco to Oakland, the tracks and electrical components were installed. The predicted response of the tube during a major earthquake was likened to be as that of a string of (cooked) spaghetti in a bowl of gelatin dessert. To avoid overstressing the tube due to differential movements at each end, a sliding slip joint was included at the San Francisco terminus under the landmark Ferry Building.

The engineers of the construction consortium PBTB (Parsons Brinckerhoff-Tudor-Bechtel) used the best estimates of ground motion available at the time, now known to be insufficient given modern computational analysis methods and geotechnical knowledge. Unexpected settlement of the tube has reduced the amount of slip that can be accommodated without failure. These factors have resulted in the slip joint being designed too short to ensure survival of the tube under possible (perhaps even likely) large earthquakes in the region. To correct this deficiency the slip joint must be extended to allow for additional movement, a modification expected to be both expensive and technically and logistically difficult. Other retrofits to the BART tube include vibratory consolidation of the tube&#x27;s overfill to avoid potential liquefying of the overfill, which has now been completed. (Should the overfill fail there is a danger of portions of the tube rising from the bottom, an event which could potentially cause failure of the section connections.)

==Bridge retrofit==
Bridges have several failure modes.

===Expansion rockers===
Many short bridge spans are statically anchored at one end and attached to rockers at the other. This rocker gives vertical and transverse support while allowing the bridge span to expand and contract with temperature changes. The change in the length of the span is accommodated over a gap in the roadway by comb-like expansion joints. During severe ground motion, the rockers may jump from their tracks or be moved beyond their design limits, causing the bridge to unship from its resting point and then either become misaligned or fail completely. Motion can be constrained by adding ductile or high-strength steel restraints that are friction-clamped to beams and designed to slide under extreme stress while still limiting the motion relative to the anchorage.

=== Deck rigidity ===

Suspension bridges may respond to earthquakes with a side-to-side motion exceeding that which was designed for wind gust response. Such motion can cause fragmentation of the road surface, damage to bearings, and plastic deformation or breakage of components. Devices such as hydraulic dampers or clamped sliding connections and additional diagonal reinforcement may be added.

===Lattice girders, beams, and ties===

Lattice girders consist of two &quot;I&quot;-beams connected with a criss-cross lattice of flat strap or angle stock. These can be greatly strengthened by replacing the open lattice with plate members. This is usually done in concert with the replacement of hot rivets with bolts.
===Hot rivets===
Many older structures were fabricated by inserting red-hot rivets into pre-drilled holes; the soft rivets are then peened using an air hammer on one side and a bucking bar on the head end. As these cool slowly, they are left in an annealed (soft) condition, while the plate, having been hot rolled and quenched during manufacture, remains relatively hard. Under extreme stress the hard plates can shear the soft rivets, resulting in failure of the joint.

The solution is to burn out each rivet with an oxygen torch. The hole is then prepared to a precise diameter with a reamer. A special &quot;locator bolt&quot;, consisting of a head, a shaft matching the reamed hole, and a threaded end is inserted and retained with a nut, then tightened with a wrench. As the bolt has been formed from an appropriate high-strength alloy and has also been heat-treated, it is not subject to either the plastic shear failure typical of hot rivets nor the brittle fracture of ordinary bolts. Any partial failure will be in the plastic flow of the metal secured by the bolt; with proper engineering any such failure should be non-catastrophic.

===Fill and overpass===
Elevated roadways are typically built on sections of elevated earth fill connected with bridge-like segments, often supported with vertical columns. If the soil fails where a bridge terminates, the bridge may become disconnected from the rest of the roadway and break away. The retrofit for this is to add additional reinforcement to any supporting wall, or to add deep caissons adjacent to the edge at each end and connect them with a supporting beam under the bridge.

Another failure occurs when the fill at each end moves (through resonant effects) in bulk, in opposite directions. If there is an insufficient founding shelf for the overpass, then it may fall. Additional shelf and ductile stays may be added to attach the overpass to the footings at one or both ends. The stays, rather than being fixed to the beams, may instead be clamped to them. Under moderate loading, these keep the overpass centered in the gap so that it is less likely to slide off its founding shelf at one end. The ability for the fixed ends to slide, rather than break, will prevent the complete drop of the structure if it should fail to remain on the footings.

===Viaducts===
Large sections of roadway may consist entirely of viaduct, sections with no connection to the earth other than through vertical columns. When concrete columns are used, the detailing is critical. Typical failure may be in the toppling of a row of columns due either to soil connection failure or to insufficient cylindrical wrapping with rebar. Both failures were seen in the 1995 Great Hanshin earthquake in Kobe, Japan, where an entire viaduct, centrally supported by a single row of large columns, was laid down to one side. Such columns are reinforced by excavating to the foundation pad, driving additional pilings, and adding a new, larger pad, well connected with rebar alongside or into the column. A column with insufficient wrapping bar, which is prone to burst and then hinge at the bursting point, may be completely encased in a circular or elliptical jacket of welded steel sheet and grouted as described above.

Sometimes viaducts may fail in the connections between components. This was seen in the failure of the Cypress Freeway in Oakland, California, during the Loma Prieta earthquake. This viaduct was a two-level structure, and the upper portions of the columns were not well connected to the lower portions that supported the lower level; this caused the upper deck to collapse upon the lower deck. Weak connections such as these require additional external jacketing – either through external steel components or by a complete jacket of reinforced concrete, often using stub connections that are glued (using epoxy adhesive) into numerous drilled holes. These stubs are then connected to additional wrappings, external forms (which may be temporary or permanent) are erected, and additional concrete is poured into the space. Large connected structures similar to the Cypress Viaduct must also be properly analyzed in their entirety using dynamic computer simulations.

==Residential retrofit==
Side-to-side forces cause most earthquake damage. Bolting of the mudsill to the foundation and application of plywood to cripple walls are a few basic retrofit techniques which homeowners may apply to wood-framed residential structures to mitigate the effects of seismic activity. The City of San Leandro created guidelines for these procedures, as outlined in the following pamphlet. Public awareness and initiative are critical to the retrofit and preservation of existing building stock, and such efforts as those of the Association of Bay Area Governments are instrumental in providing informational resources to seismically active communities.

===Wood frame structure===
Most houses in North America are wood-framed structures. Wood is one of the best materials for earthquake-resistant construction since it is lightweight and more flexible than masonry. It is easy to work with and less expensive than steel, masonry, or concrete. In older homes the most significant weaknesses are the connection from the wood-framed walls to the foundation and the relatively weak &quot;cripple-walls.&quot; (Cripple walls are the short wood walls that extend from the top of the foundation to the lowest floor level in houses that have raised floors.) Adding connections from the base of the wood-framed structure to the foundation is almost always an important part of a seismic retrofit. Bracing the cripple-walls to resist side-to-side forces is essential in houses with cripple walls; bracing is usually done with plywood. Oriented strand board (OSB) does not perform as consistently as plywood, and is not the favored choice of retrofit designers or installers.

Retrofit methods in older wood-frame structures may consist of the following, and other methods not described here.
*The lowest plate rails of walls (usually called &quot;mudsills&quot; or &quot;foundation sills&quot; in North America) are bolted to a continuous foundation, or secured with rigid metal connectors bolted to the foundation so as to resist side-to-side forces.
*&quot;Cripple walls&quot; are braced with plywood.
*Selected vertical elements (typically the posts at the ends of plywood wall bracing panels) are connected to the foundation. These connections are intended to prevent the braced walls from rocking up and down when subjected to back-and-forth forces at the top of the braced walls, not to resist the wall or house &quot;jumping&quot; off the foundation (which almost never occurs).
*In two-story buildings using &quot;platform framing&quot; (sometimes called &quot;western&quot; style construction, where walls are progressively erected upon the lower story&#x27;s upper diaphragm, unlike &quot;eastern&quot; or &quot;balloon framing&quot;), the upper walls are connected to the lower walls with tension elements. In some cases, connections may be extended vertically to include retention of certain roof elements. This sort of strengthening is usually very costly with respect to the strength gained.
*Vertical posts are secured to the beams or other members they support. This is particularly important where loss of support would lead to collapse of a segment of a building. Connections from posts to beams cannot resist appreciable side-to-side forces; it is much more important to strengthen around the perimeter of a building (bracing the cripple-walls and supplementing foundation-to-wood-framing connections) than it is to reinforce post-to-beam connections.

Wooden framing is efficient when combined with masonry, if the structure is properly designed. In Turkey, the traditional houses (bagdadi) are made with this technology. In El Salvador, wood and bamboo are used for residential construction.

===Reinforced and unreinforced masonry===
In many parts of developing countries such as Pakistan, Iran and China, unreinforced or in some cases reinforced masonry is the predominantly form of structures for rural residential and dwelling. Masonry was also a common construction form in the early part of the 20th century, which implies that a substantial number of these at-risk masonry structures would have significant heritage value. Masonry walls that are not reinforced are especially hazardous. Such structures may be more appropriate for replacement than retrofit, but if the walls are the principal load bearing elements in structures of modest size they may be appropriately reinforced. It is especially important that floor and ceiling beams be securely attached to the walls. Additional vertical supports in the form of steel or reinforced concrete may be added.

In the western United States, much of what is seen as masonry is actually brick or stone veneer. Current construction rules dictate the amount of &quot;tie–back&quot; required, which consist of metal straps secured to vertical structural elements. These straps extend into mortar courses, securing the veneer to the primary structure. Older structures may not secure this sufficiently for seismic safety. A weakly secured veneer in a house interior (sometimes used to face a fireplace from floor to ceiling) can be especially dangerous to occupants. Older masonry chimneys are also dangerous if they have substantial vertical extension above the roof. These are prone to breakage at the roofline and may fall into the house in a single large piece. For retrofit, additional supports may be added; however, it is extremely expensive to strengthen an existing masonry chimney to conform with contemporary design standards. It is best to simply remove the extension and replace it with lighter materials, with special metal flue replacing the flue tile and a wood structure replacing the masonry. This may be matched against existing brickwork by using very thin veneer (similar to a tile, but with the appearance of a brick).

<doc id="923307" wikidata="Q31221" url="?curid=923307" title="Evelyn Brent">
<text>Evelyn Brent (born Mary Elizabeth Riggs; October 20, 1895 – June 4, 1975) was an American film and stage actress.

== Early life ==

Brent was born in Tampa, Florida and known as &quot;Betty.&quot; When she was 10 years old, her mother Eleanor ( Warner) died, leaving her father, Arthur, to raise her alone. She moved to New York City as a teenager, and her good looks brought modeling jobs that led to an opportunity to become involved in movies.

She originally studied to be a teacher. While attending a normal school in New York, she visited the World Film Studio in Fort Lee, New Jersey. Two days later, she was working there as an extra, earning $3 per day.

== Career ==
She began her film career working under her own name at a New Jersey film studio, then made her major debut in the 1915 silent film production of the Robert W. Service poem &quot;The Shooting of Dan McGrew&quot;.

As Evelyn Brent, she continued to work in film, developing into a young woman with sultry looks. After World War I, she went to London for a vacation and met American playwright Oliver Cromwell, who urged her to accept an important role in &quot;The Ruined Lady&quot;. The production was presented on the London stage. She remained in England for four years, performing on stage and in films produced by British companies, then she moved to Hollywood in 1922.

Her career received a major boost the following year when she was chosen as one of the WAMPAS Baby Stars. Douglas Fairbanks Sr. signed her but failed to find a story for her; she left his company to join Associated Authors.
Brent made more than two dozen silent films, including three for director Josef von Sternberg. One of these was &quot;The Last Command&quot; (1928), an epic war drama featuring William Powell for which Emil Jannings won the first Academy Award for Best Actor. Brent was the film&#x27;s leading lady. 

Later that year, she starred opposite William Powell in her first sound movie. Brent played major roles in several features, most notably &quot;The Silver Horde&quot; and the Paramount Pictures all-star revue &quot;Paramount on Parade&quot; (both 1930).

By the early part of the 1930s, she was working in secondary roles in a variety of films as well as touring with vaudeville shows. In 1936, she played William Boyd&#x27;s love interest/femme fatale in &quot;Hopalong Cassidy Returns&quot;. However, by 1941, she was no longer in demand by major studios, and she found work at smaller, low-budget studios.

Evelyn Brent photographed attractively opposite leading men who were also at advanced ages and later stages in their careers: Jack Holt in the Columbia serial &quot;Holt of the Secret Service&quot;, Neil Hamilton in PRC&#x27;s production &quot;Dangerous Lady&quot;, and Lee Tracy in the same studio&#x27;s &quot;The Payoff&quot;. In the early 1940s, she worked in action features for Paramount, produced by Pine-Thomas Productions. Veteran director William Beaudine cast her in many productions as well, including &quot;Emergency Landing&quot; (1941), &quot;Bowery Champs&quot; (1944), &quot;The Golden Eye&quot; (1948), and &quot;Again Pioneers&quot; (1950). After performing in more than 120 films, she retired from acting in 1950 and worked for a number of years as an actor&#x27;s agent.

She returned to acting in television&#x27;s &quot;Wagon Train&quot; for one episode in 1960, &quot;The Lita Foladaire Story&quot;, starring Ward Bond and Diane Brewster. Brent played a housekeeper and her appearance had changed radically.

== Personal life and death ==
Evelyn Brent was married three times: to movie executive Bernard P. Fineman, to producer Harry D. Edwards, and finally to the vaudeville actor Harry Fox. They were married until he died in 1959.

Brent died of a heart attack in 1975 at age 79 in her Los Angeles home. She is interred in the San Fernando Mission Cemetery in Mission Hills, California.

==Legacy==
In 1960, Brent was inducted into the Hollywood Walk of Fame with a motion pictures star for her contributions to the film industry. Her star is located at 6548 Hollywood Boulevard.

<doc id="923314" wikidata="Q2026436" url="?curid=923314" title="Operation Tabarin">
<text>Operation Tabarin was the code name for a secret British expedition to the Antarctic during World War Two, operational 1943–46. Conducted by the Admiralty on behalf of the Colonial Office, its primary objective was to strengthen British claims to sovereignty of the British territory of the Falkland Islands Dependencies (FID), to which Argentina and Chile had made counter claims since the outbreak of war. This was done by establishing permanently occupied bases, carrying out administrative activities such as postal services and undertaking scientific research. The meteorological observations made aided Allied shipping in the South Atlantic Ocean.

Following Cabinet approval in January 1943, there was an intensive period of planning, recruitment and procurement, before the expedition left the UK in November 1943, led by Lieutenant-Commander James Marr. Two bases were established in early 1944 – firstly, Base B, at Deception Island, South Shetland Islands, and later the main base, Base A, at Port Lockroy, Wiencke Island. A variety of science and mapping work was carried out. 14 men over-wintered in 1944.

In the Antarctic summer of 1944/45, Captain Andrew Taylor became leader, following the resignation of Marr due to ill health. A base hut was built on Coronation Island, South Orkney Islands (Base C) but not occupied. Base D, Hope Bay, Trinity Peninsula, was established as the centre for the expedition&#x27;s second year. The resupply of the bases included men, supplies and equipment, together with 25 sled dogs to extend field work on the mainland of the Antarctic Peninsula. A full programme of science and mapping was undertaken. 21 men over-wintered in 1945.

The expedition was relieved in March 1946 by members of the newly formed Falkland Islands Dependencies Survey (FIDS). FIDS had been established in July 1945, following the end of the War in Europe, to put the work started by Operation Tabarin on a permanent footing. In 1962 FIDS was re-named the British Antarctic Survey (BAS), following Britain&#x27;s ratification of the Antarctic Treaty and the creation of British Antarctic Territory.

Operation Tabarin established the first British permanently-occupied stations in the Antarctic and, in commencing geology, biology and mapping, was the foundation for continuous British scientific research in Antarctica. The huskies provided the core of a British Antarctic husky population, used for survey journeys, that lasted until 1994.

==Background==
Following the outbreak of World War II, Allied shipping across the globe became vulnerable to attacks by German Navy commerce raiders and U-boats. The War also threatened to reignite the longstanding Falkland Islands sovereignty dispute with neutral Argentina.

The important trade routes round Cape Horn and the Cape of Good Hope made the waters of the South Atlantic Ocean a particular target, with a corresponding threat to the Falkland Islands and its Dependencies. In January 1941, the German cruiser attacked the unarmed and unescorted Norwegian whaling fleet. &quot;Pinguin&quot; seized a haul of 20,320 tons of whale oil, one of the largest prizes seized by a commerce raider during the war.

In response, the British authorities sent the armed merchant cruiser to patrol the area between South Georgia, the South Shetland Islands and Weddell Sea. On 5 March, &quot;Queen of Bermuda&quot; visited the abandoned Norwegian Hektor Whaling Station in Whalers Bay, Deception Island, which was a well known safe harbour, destroying stocks of coal and oil, and associated equipment, to prevent them from falling into enemy hands.

The entry of Japan into the war in December 1941 increased the threat, with fear that Japan might seek to seize the Falkland Islands as a base in the South Atlantic. The Islands&#x27; defences were minimal and approaches to the USA for support were unsuccessful, though endorsed by the British prime minister, Winston Churchill.

In January 1942, Argentina&#x27;s Comisión Nacional del Antártico dispatched the transport to Deception Island, afterwards sailing to the Melchior Islands, Palmer Archipelago and Winter Island. Argentine flags were raised in these locations and all territories south of 60° S and between 25° W and 68.34° W were declared annexed.

On 28 January 1943 a meeting of the War Cabinet, chaired by Clement Attlee considered Foreign Office proposals to address what were seen as mounting Argentine encroachments on British territory. These were to dispatch the armed merchant cruiser to the Dependencies to make landings, carry out administrative activities and remove marks of Argentine claims, and, crucially, to establish permanently occupied bases at strategic locations. Both were approved.

Upon reaching Deception Island, &quot;Carnarvon Castle&quot; replaced the Argentinian flag with the Union Jack and placed four British Crown Land signs. A month later &quot;Primero de Mayo&quot; returned and duly replaced the Union Jack with the Argentinian flag. The British concluded that occupation was indeed necessary to end these tit-for-tat tactics. 

===Planning and preparation===
In May 1943, following a number of interdepartmental meetings, planning started for an expedition to occupy sites in the Falkland Islands Dependencies (FID). A meeting on 27 May set the objective of establishing permanent bases on Deception Island, South Shetland Islands, and on Signy Island, South Orkney Islands, funded through sales of a new FID stamp issue to philatelists, though in the event most costs were met through the Admiralty. During the planning stage the priority for the location of the second base was changed to Hope Bay, since it was on the mainland, with an option to erect a hut on Signy Island if resources allowed. Final instructions were issued in November 1943, clarifying the physical and political objectives, importance of the issuing of stamps, appointment of magistrates and other acts of sovereignty. In the field the expedition was under the authority of the Governor of the Falkland Islands, who received instructions from the Secretary of State for the Colonies.

An Expedition Committee was established in June 1943, chaired by A.B. Acheson, Colonial Office Under-Secretary, with members from the Colonial Office, Foreign Office, Admiralty, Treasury, Crown Agents, Ministry of War Transport and Discovery Investigations.

It was agreed that scientific research and mapping should be undertaken by the expedition and three scientists with significant Antarctic experience were involved. Two joined the committee from the outset: geologist and polar explorer James Wordie, a member of Shackleton&#x27;s Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition and one of the founders of the Scott Polar Research Institute, and Neil Mackintosh, a zoologist and Director of the Discovery Investigations. The third, Brian Roberts, was an ornithologist on the British Graham Land Expedition, who was working with Wordie in the Admiralty Intelligence Department on cold-climate clothing and equipment. He was formally involved after February 1944, when he took up a post at the Foreign Office Research Department. Mackintosh prepared a detailed scientific programme for the shore parties.

The expedition code name &#x27;Tabarin&#x27; was acknowledged in October when departments within the Admiralty were informed, though it is likely to have been in use earlier. A hand-written note by Roberts explains that the name, after the Paris night club Bal Tabarin, was chosen because of the amount of night work required and the chaotic organisation. According to some sources the expedition was briefly code named Operation Bransfield, after Royal Navy officer Edward Bransfield. The Forces mail address Naval Party 475 was allocated for the bases to be established, and Naval Party 470 for the expedition ship. The expedition was considered top secret but by April 1944 news of it had leaked out, not least because of the philately work undertaken at the direction of the Colonial Office.

Marine biologist and polar explorer James Marr was selected as leader of the expedition. His experience included participation in Shackleton&#x27;s last expedition, during 1921–22, as an 18-year old; the British, Australian and New Zealand Antarctic Research Expedition (BANZARE) 1929–30; and as a scientist on the Discovery Investigations 1928–1929, 1931–1933, 1935–1937. At the time of his recall, Marr was serving as a lieutenant in the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve in the Far East. He arrived in the UK in July 1943 and joined the expedition committee. He was subsequently promoted to Lieutenant Commander.
Marr&#x27;s priorities were to find an expedition vessel and recruit suitably experienced volunteers. In the circumstances of war and time constraints it was difficult to find a ship built to navigate through sea ice and with sufficient cargo capacity. He flew to Iceland to inspect a Norwegian sealer &quot;Veslekari&quot;, built in 1918, that had been used on Arctic expeditions in the past. After further inspection by a surveyor, she was considered suitable, brought to Tilbury, London for a refit and requisitioned by the Admiralty under the name HMS &quot;Bransfield&quot;. Lieutenant Victor Marchesi, Royal Navy, was appointed as her captain and second-in-command of the expedition. Marchesi had served on the Discovery Investigations with Marr.

Potential recruits were identified by Marr, assisted by Wordie and Mackenzie, and interviewed by him at the Colonial Office in September. Most were serving in the armed forces or the merchant navy, but some were still in civilian roles. Several were well known to them through the Discovery Investigations, including the chief steward Thomas Berry, ship&#x27;s carpenter Lewis Ashton, senior wireless operator James Farrington, handymen John Matheson and Gwion Davies. Other specialists recruited were surveyor Andrew Taylor, a Canadian with cold-weather experience; medical officer Eric Back; meteorologist Gordon Howkins; botanist Ivan Mackenzie Lamb, then working at the British Museum of Natural History; and two geologists, William Flett, from Glasgow University and Buck, who withdrew from the expedition before it left the UK; and wireless operator Norman Layther, a New Zealander.

==Expedition==

By late October all the necessary equipment and stores were packed and assembled at the Royal Albert Docks, Tilbury. As the &quot;Bransfield&quot; was too small to carry the whole load, some of the cargo, including the prefabricated hut, had already been shipped ahead aboard SS &quot;Groix&quot; and &quot;Ragnhidsholm&quot;, and now more stores and two expedition members were allocated to SS &quot;Marquesa&quot;. &quot;Bransfield&quot; herself, with the rest of the expedition, was scheduled to sail on 6 November, but was delayed when leaking fresh water tanks had to be replaced.

===Journey south===
On 12 November 1943 &quot;Bransfield&quot; finally sailed from Tilbury, joining a small coastal convoy bound for Falmouth. Problems arose almost immediately and she had to put in to Portsmouth for repairs. She continued on 25 November but proved unseaworthy during a gale on the voyage west. Meanwhile, the &quot;Marquesa&quot;, on leaving Liverpool wharf, had grounded on a submerged wreck and the Tabarin contingent were ordered to re-join the rest of the expedition. Forced to abandon the &quot;Bransfield&quot;, the expedition was trans-shipped to the troop ship SS Highland Monarch at Avonmouth in Bristol on 8 December. She was taking a relief garrison to the Falkland Islands and sailed on 14 December, calling at Gibraltar and Montevideo before reaching Port Stanley on 26 January. Waiting for them, to replace &quot;Bransfield&quot;, was HMS . Built for whale marking work by the Discovery Investigations, she had been requisitioned by the Royal Navy for mine sweeping duties in the South Atlantic during the war. She had very limited cargo capacity but the Falkland Islands Company vessel SS &quot;Fitzroy&quot; had also been assigned to the expedition to transport cargo and most of the personnel. The &quot;Fitzroy&quot; had already collected the cargo carried to Montevideo on other vessels.

===1st year – Antarctic summer 1943/44 and winter 1944===

The two ships left Port Stanley on 29 January. In addition to the expedition, the &quot;Fitzroy&quot; carried Tim Hooley, his wife and 14-year-old daughter. Hooley was taking up a two-year post as wireless operator for the Government station on South Georgia, and the family were only landed there once the priority objectives of establishing two Tabarin bases was achieved. On 3 February 1944 the expedition arrived at Port Foster, Deception Island. This being the most likely place for Argentine or German vessels to shelter, they were relieved that there were no signs of recent occupation, other than an Argentine flag painted on a fuel tank, which was promptly erased. Few of the buildings were inhabitable, but one of the Hektor Station buildings was selected for Base B. Unloading commenced immediately and by 6 February the two ships were able to depart, leaving geologist Flett as leader of a five-man party.

The expedition sailed for Hope Bay, arriving on 7 February, to find that the approach to the bay from Antarctic Sound was through a 10-mile wide band of pack ice. This posed a risk to the safety of the &quot;Fitzroy&quot;, which was not ice-strengthened in any way. &quot;William Scoresby&quot; proceeded through the sea ice and landed a reconnoitering party, but, though urged to follow, the &quot;Fitzroy&quot;″s captain, Keith Pitt, and Captain David Roberts (a representative of the Falkland Islands Company), decided they could not risk the ship. The following day the attempt was reluctantly abandoned and the decision made to proceed south-west along the coast of the Antarctic Peninsula in search of an alternative mainland site. Due to thick fog, it was not until 10 February that the ships left Bransfield Strait and began the search. With &quot;Fitzroy&quot; now running low on coal and no suitable landing site having been found, Marr agreed that the expedition should make for Port Lockroy, Wiencke Island, a well known safe harbour with several low rocky islets where the base could be built. The two vessels arrived there on the afternoon of 11 February.
Although long-used by ships visiting the area, Port Lockroy&#x27;s location restricted the range of scientific activities possible because the Gerlache Strait rarely froze, so cutting off access to the mainland. In addition, as an island location, it was inferior to Hope Bay, on the Peninsula mainland, from the perspective of strengthening British sovereignty, though this was somewhat mitigated by it being so well known. Both these factors added to the pressure Marr was under. Nevertheless, a site for the hut was chosen on Goudier Island and Base A was established, discharging cargo beginning at once. Signs of Argentine territorial claims left by &quot;Primero de Mayo&quot; were removed.
The main hut, named Bransfield House in memory of their original expedition ship, was a prefabricated design by the Norwich firm of Boulton and Paul. On 15 February the generator was successfully installed, enabling wireless communication with Stanley and Base B to be established. Three extensions to the hut were added between February and April, using materials brought from Deception Island or found nearby, and also a Nissen hut for storage. Port Lockroy began postmarking mail on 12 February, indicating the importance given to philatelic duties. Falkland Island stamps overprinted with the inscription &quot;Graham Land, Dependency of&quot; were used. The &quot;William Scoresby&quot; and &quot;Fitzroy&quot; left the new base on 17 February for Base B, Deception Island, before visiting Signy Island, arriving on 20th. A landing was made and a Union flag nailed to a disused whaling hut. Mail was processed using South Orkney overprinted stamps. From there the vessels sailed to Grytviken, South Georgia, where the Hooley family disembarked, before returning to the Falkland Islands, taking official mail.

&quot;William Scoresby&quot; visited Base A twice more before winter set in. On 19 March she brought Falkland Islander John Blyth, who joined the team as a cook/handyman in place of Blair. On 17 April, she delivered a large quantity of mail to be stamped and cancelled. On 22 April Marr and others were aboard when the vessel visited Cape Renard to erect a Union Jack and British Crown Land sign. Port Stanley Town Hall, in which the Post Office was located, was destroyed by fire on 16 April. In addition to the loss of expedition mail, this compromised the expedition&#x27;s secrecy as correspondence now passed through Montevideo. Tabarin&#x27;s existence became known to the outside world through a BBC announcement and press releases on 24 April.

Both bases made meteorological observations, transmitted twice a day to the meteorological station in Stanley, and sea ice observations during the winter. At Deception Island upper air observations were made using meteorological balloons. A geological survey was also undertaken, and aspects of glaciology and physiography observed. At Port Lockroy scientific work began in early May with the collection of rock samples from the foot of Jabet Peak and Savoia Peak. A botanical survey was made by Lamb, mainly of lichens, that included the discovery of a number of unrecorded species, including &quot;Verrucaria serpuloides&quot;, the then only known true marine lichen, thus making a considerable contribution to the taxonomy of Antarctic lichens. During the winter the nine men practised skiing, prepared equipment for planned field trips and Taylor carried out local mapping work. In September a party of four, man hauling two sledges, undertook a topographic survey of Wiencke Island over 25 days, in challenging terrain and poor weather conditions. As spring advanced Lamb took advantage of the low tides and melting snow to conduct an ecological study of the local beaches, Marr encouraging the others to collect zoological specimens. On 18 November Lamb led a field party back to Blyth Point (on Wiencke Island) to complete his botanical collecting there. Bird and lichen specimens were gathered, the former for the needs of the British Museum (Natural History).

===2nd year – Antarctic summer 1944/45 and winter 1945===
On 6 December, &quot;William Scoresby&quot; returned to Station B bringing plants native to the Falklands and soil for Lamb to conduct a transplantation experiment, which ultimately failed due to low humidity and strong winds. On 3 February 1945, &quot;Fitzroy&quot; and the 550 ton sealer &quot;Eagle&quot; arrived at Port Lockroy, with Victor Russell and David James, Norman Bertram Marshall, Gordon Lockley, Frank White, Alan Reece, Thomas Donnachie and Norman Layther aboard. Stores, equipment and crew members destined for the erection of an unmanned Base E on Stonington Island moved into &quot;Eagle&quot;, others boarded &quot;William Scoresby&quot; and &quot;Fitzroy&quot; in order to build Station D on Hope Bay.

On 7 February, Marr resigned on account of poor health and later returned to the Falklands, with Taylor replacing him as expedition leader. Taylor abandoned the plan to build the Stonington Island station focusing his attention on Station D. On 13 February, Seal Point was selected as the most suitable location for Station D and the first steps for its erection were made, construction was completed on 20 March. On 23 February, a hut was built on Coronation Island to reinforce British claims to the area. Later on the British expedition paid the Argentine meteorological station on Laurie Island a courtesy visit.

A few fossil specimens were collected at Hope Bay in February, with systematic gathering of paleobotanical specimens from Mount Flora&#x27;s shale beginning on 8 June. A sledging expedition from Hope was launched in August. On 29 December, the sledging party returned to Base D, having visited Vortex Island, Duse Bay, James Ross Island and numerous small islands in its vicinity.

The trip resulted in of lichen, fossil and rock samples, meteorological and glaciological measurements as well as corrections to Otto Nordenskjöld&#x27;s maps.

===3rd year – Antarctic summer 1945/46===
On 14 January 1946, &quot;William Scoresby&quot;, &quot;Fitzroy&quot; and 300-ton sealer &quot;Trepassey&quot; began evacuating the members of the expedition to the Falklands. On 11 February, those serving in the military boarded , and the rest sailed home on &quot;Highland Monarch&quot;.

==Aftermath==

The end of World War II led to renewed interest in the Antarctic region. The United States refused to recognise any foreign territorial claims to Antarctica, initiating Operation Highjump. Argentina and Chile signed the Argentine-Chilean Agreement on Joint Defence of &quot;Antarctic Rights&quot;, a defence agreement that envisioned potential military action over disputed Antarctic lands. Chile organized its First Chilean Antarctic Expedition in 1947–1948.

Among other accomplishments, it brought Chilean President Gabriel González Videla to inaugurate one of its bases personally, and he thereby became the first head of state to set foot on the continent.

Britain, on the other hand, continued the operation of the bases built during Operation Tabarin by transferring them to the newly established Falkland Islands Dependencies Survey. Operation Tabarin veterans Reece, White and Russell remained at their bases and continued their work for the FIDS. Participants of Operation Tabarin were awarded the Polar Medal in 1953.

Port Lockroy made the first measurements of the ionosphere and the first recording of an atmospheric whistler (electronic waves). It was also a key monitoring site during the International Geophysical Year of 1957. Port Lockroy was designated a Historic Site or Monument (HSM 61) and is now a museum following a proposal by the United Kingdom to the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting.

<text>Nyitra County (; ; ; ) was an administrative county (comitatus) of the Kingdom of Hungary. Its territory lay in what is now western Slovakia.

==Geography==
Nyitra County shared borders with the Austrian land Moravia and Trencsén County, Turóc County, Bars County, Komárom County and Pozsony County. In its final phase, it was a strip of land between the Morava river in the north and the town of Érsekújvár (present-day Nové Zámky) in the south, plus an outlier around the town of Privigye (present-day Prievidza). The river Vág (present-day Váh) flowed through the county. Its area was 5519 km2 around 1910.

==Capitals==
The capital of the county was the Nitra Castle () and since the Late Middle Ages the town of Nyitra (present-day Nitra).

==History==
A predecessor to Nyitra county may have existed as early as in the 9th century at the time of Great Moravia. Around 1000, Nyitra county arose as one of the first comitatus of the Kingdom of Hungary. The southern part, including the town Nyitra, was ruled as Uyvar Province between 1663 and 1685 by Ottoman Empire. The county shortly ceased to exist as a separate administrative unit between 1850 and 1860, when it was split into Upper Nyitra County (including Bán district from Trencsén County) and Lower Nyitra County (including Oszlány district from Bars County).

After World War I, Nyitra county became part of newly formed Czechoslovakia. Nitra county (&quot;Nitrianska župa&quot;) continued to exist within its original borders until 1923, when it was replaced by so-called &quot;Nitra Great County&quot;, officially The County XIV. (Nitrianska). In 1928, Nitra County was abolished like all other counties in Slovakia. During the First Slovak Republic the county was shortly restored (1940-1945), however without southern parts became part of Hungary in November 1938, as a result of the First Vienna Award.

<text>Charles Guillaume Marie Appollinaire Antoine Cousin-Montauban, 1er Comte de Palikao (; 24 June 1796 – 8 January 1878) was a French general and statesman.

==Biography==
Montauban was born in Paris. As a cavalry officer he saw much service in Algeria, but he was still only a colonel when in 1847 he effected the capture of Abdel Kadir. Between January 1855 and November 1857, Montauban commanded the Division of Oran in western Algeria. In 1855 he was sent to fight in the Crimea. He was appointed in 1858 to a command at home, and at the close of 1859 was selected to lead the French troops in the Anglo-French expedition to China. His conduct of the operations did not escape criticism, but in 1862 he received from Napoleon III, the title of comte de Palikao (from the Battle of Palikao); he had already been made a senator. The allegation that he had acquired a vast fortune by the plunder of the Old Summer Palace in Peking seems to have been without foundation.

In 1865 he was appointed to the command of the IV army corps at Lyon, in the training of which he displayed exceptional energy and administrative capacity. In the Franco-Prussian War of 1870 he was not given a command in the field, but after the opening disasters had shaken the Ollivier ministry he was entrusted by the empress-regent with the portfolio of war, and became president of the council (10 August). He at once, with great success, reorganized the military resources of the nation. He claimed to have raised Marshal MacMahon&#x27;s force at Châlons to 140,000 men, to have created three new army corps, 33 new regiments and 100,000 gardes mobiles, and to have brought the defences of the capital to a state of efficiency – all this in 24 days. He conceived the idea of sending the &quot;Army of Châlons&quot; to raise the blockade of Metz. The scheme depended on a precision and rapidity of which the &quot;Army of Châlons&quot; was no longer capable, and ended with the disaster of Sedan. After the capitulation of the emperor the dictatorship was offered to Palikao, but he refused to desert the empire, and proposed to establish a council of national defence, with himself as lieutenant-general of government. Before a decision was made, the chamber was invaded by the mob, and Palikao fled to Belgium.

In 1871 he appeared before the parliamentary commission of inquiry, and in the same year established Un Ministre de la guerre de vingt-quatre jours. He died at Versailles.

<doc id="923331" wikidata="Q3453622" url="?curid=923331" title="Ruth Graves Wakefield">
<text>Ruth Jones Wakefield ( Graves; June 17, 1903 – January 10, 1977) was an American chef, known for her innovations in the baking field. She pioneered the first chocolate chip cookie recipe, an invention many people incorrectly assume was a mistake. Her new dessert, supposedly conceived of as she returned from a vacation in Egypt, is the inspiration behind the massively popular Toll House Chocolate Chip Cookie. Throughout her life, Wakefield found occupation as a dietitian, educator, business owner, and published author. She wrote a cookbook titled &quot;Ruth Wakefield’s, Toll House: Tried and True Recipes.&quot;

==Personal life==
Ruth Jones Graves was born on June 17, 1903, in East Walpole, Massachusetts, to Fred Graves and Helen Vest Jones. She was raised in Easton and attended the Framingham State School of Household Arts, currently Framingham State University. Upon graduation in 1924, Ruth taught home economics at Brockton High School, in addition to working as a hospital dietitian and a customer service representative at a utility company. Ruth married Kenneth Donald Wakefield, a meat packing executive, in 1928. Together, the couple had two children, Kenneth Donald Jr. and a daughter, Mary Jane. In 1930, the couple decided to purchase a historic building in Whitman, Plymouth County, which had allegedly been used as a toll house as early as 1709. Building on the tradition of the house, Kenneth and Ruth elected to turn the building into a lodge, fittingly naming the new business the Toll House Inn. The news of her cooking prowess quickly spread, as the inn grew from seven to over sixty tables.

==Toll House Inn==

Wakefield and her husband bought a tourist lodge that they called the Tollhouse Inn. They called it this because it was located on what used Bedford]]. Ruth cooked for the guests using her own recipes and some of her grandmother&#x27;s old recipes that became very successful and grew the Inn&#x27;s dining room from seven tables to sixty. Her recipes were so popular that she released multiple cookbooks, the most popular being a cookbook titled &quot;Ruth Wakefield&#x27;s Tried and True Recipes&quot; in 1931.

== Inventing the &quot;Toll House&quot; Chocolate Chip Cookie ==
Wakefield was looking to improve on the colonial-style desserts she had been serving to her customers. In 1938, Ruth, along with her cooking assistant Sue Brides, were experimenting with a thin butterscotch pecan cookie that had been incredibly popular with guests. Her intuition was to add melting squares of baking chocolate to the blond batter, but she realized her baking cabinet was out of the ingredient. The closest substitute at her disposal was semi-sweet chocolate bars from the Nestlé company. Continuing to improvise, Ruth used an icepick to break the chocolate into pea-sized bits, which today would be recognized as the cookie&#x27;s staple, chocolate &quot;chips.&quot; As opposed to melting and disseminating across the cookie, the bits maintained their chunky form as they baked. Inn visitors loved the revolutionary good and the novel dessert created an influx of visitors. It became so popular that it was featured in newspapers, and the Wakefields received countless letters from people requesting the recipe, and the Toll House Cookie became the most popular dessert of the time. 

In exchange for Wakefield offering Nestlé permission to print the recipe and market their semi-sweet chocolate as a key ingredient, Wakefield received a $1 payment for recipe rights, a lifetime supply of baking chocolate, and a consulting deal with Nestlé. In tribute to the origin story, Nestlé branded the products &quot;Toll House Cookies.&quot;

A myth holds that Wakefield accidentally developed the cookie, and that she expected the chocolate chunks would melt, making chocolate cookies. That is not the case; Wakefield stated that she deliberately invented the cookie. She said, &quot;We had been serving a thin butterscotch nut cookie with ice cream. Everybody seemed to love it, but I was trying to give them something different. So I came up with Toll House cookie.&quot;

== Toll House Cookies and World War II ==

The Toll House Cookies rose to popularity in 1940, during World War II. Ruth&#x27;s daughter (who worked as a cooking assistant) recalls days in the kitchen filled with packing care packages to send to the Massachusetts troops overseas. They soon began receiving letters from all over the country requesting that the packages including Toll House Cookies be sent to troops from other states.

==Death==
Ruth retired in 1966 and sold the Toll House, which later burned down in 1984. Ruth died on January 10, 1977, in Plymouth, Massachusetts, at the age of 73.

<text>American Notes for General Circulation is a travelogue by Charles Dickens detailing his trip to North America from January to June 1842. While there he acted as a critical observer of North American society, almost as if returning a status report on their progress. This can be compared to the style of his &quot;Pictures from Italy&quot; written four years later, where he wrote far more like a tourist. His American journey was also an inspiration for his novel &quot;Martin Chuzzlewit&quot;. Having arrived in Boston, he visited Lowell, New York, and Philadelphia, and travelled as far south as Richmond, as far west as St. Louis and as far north as Quebec. The American city he liked best was Boston – &quot;the air was so clear, the houses were so bright and gay. [...] The city is a beautiful one, and cannot fail, I should imagine, to impress all strangers very favourably.&quot; Further, it was close to the Perkins Institution and Massachusetts Asylum for the Blind where Dickens encountered Laura Bridgman, who impressed him greatly.

==Background==

On 3 January 1842, one month shy of his 30th birthday, Dickens sailed with his wife, Catherine, and her maid, Anne Brown, from Liverpool on board the steamship RMS &quot;Britannia&quot; bound for America.
Arriving in Boston on 22 January 1842, the author was at once mobbed. Dickens at first revelled in the attention, but soon the endless demands on his time began to wear on his enthusiasm. He complained in a letter to his friend John Forster:

I can do nothing that I want to do, go nowhere where I want to go, and see nothing that I want to see. If I turn into the street, I am followed by a multitude.

He travelled mainly on the East Coast and the Great Lakes area of both the United States and Canada, primarily by steamboat, but also by rail and coach. During his extensive itinerary, he made a particular point of visiting prisons and mental institutions and even took a quick glimpse at the prairie. 
Among his early visits to American institutions, Dickens visited Perkins School for the Blind near Boston, where he met Laura Bridgman, who is considered the first deaf-blind person to receive a significant education in English. His account of this meeting in &quot;American Notes&quot; would inspire Helen Keller&#x27;s parents to seek an education for their daughter.
He was particularly critical of the American press and the sanitary conditions of American cities. He also wrote merciless parodies of the manners of the locals, including, but not limited to, their rural conversations and practice of spitting tobacco in public (Ch. 8 – Washington):

As Washington may be called the headquarters of tobacco-tinctured saliva, the time is come when I must confess, without any disguise, that the prevalence of those two odious practices of chewing and expectorating began about this time to be anything but agreeable, and soon became most offensive and sickening.

In Washington, D.C., he called upon President John Tyler in the White House, writing that:

... he looked somewhat worn and anxious, and well he might; being at war with everybody – but the expression of his face was mild and pleasant, and his manner was remarkably unaffected, gentlemanly, and agreeable. I thought that in his whole carriage and demeanour, he became his station singularly well.

Although generally impressed by what he found, he could not forgive the continued existence of slavery in the United States, which he described as &quot;that most hideous blot and foul disgrace ...&quot; The final chapters of the book are devoted to a criticism of the practice. He was also unhappy about copyright issues. Dickens, by this time, had become an international celebrity, but owing to the lack of an international copyright law, bootleg copies of his works were freely available in North America and he could not abide losing money. Dickens called for international copyright law in many of his speeches in America, and his persistence in discussing the subject led some critics to accuse him of having travelled to America primarily to agitate for that cause.

Dickens&#x27;s letters home to his friends, including Forster and illustrator Daniel Maclise, helped to form the basis of the book.

==Critique of US society at the time==
Throughout the narrative, finding much to admire in Americans he met and in their way of life, he also notes what he sees as their faults, sometimes jocularly. Then, in a conclusion, he gives his considered analysis of what he views as major flaws in US society.

First and most serious is slavery. Apart from its corruption of both whites and blacks in slave states, the free states are complicit in the system. In particular, he is horrified by the physical violence vented on both male and female slaves.

Next, he places violence. The ideals of liberty and equality seem to include the freedom to shoot or knife any other American.

Third, he cites what he calls universal distrust, the extreme individualism that leads people to suspect others and to seek advantage over them. With a few exceptions, the scandal-seeking press contributes by undermining private life and destroying confidence in public life.

Allied to this is the overriding commercialism, with the urge to pull off a smart deal and the idolisation of successful businessmen. In this capitalist jungle, he finds most people far too serious and puritanical, lacking humour and a wider perspective.

Finally, in many places he finds standards of personal cleanliness and public health still very primitive and is particularly disgusted by the almost universal habit of spitting.

==Title==

According to Dickens&#x27;s biographer Michael Slater, the title &quot;American Notes for General Circulation&quot; may have been a joke at the expense of American currency. The end of the Second Bank of the United States and the ensuing Panic of 1837 led to widespread bank failures and rendered much paper currency worthless.

==Documentary (2005)==

The book formed the basis for &quot;Dickens in America&quot; (2005), an authored documentary series by Miriam Margolyes in which she followed Dickens&#x27;s journey through the United States, visiting many of the places mentioned by the author in his book.

<doc id="923342" wikidata="Q6540616" url="?curid=923342" title="Liberal Democrat frontbench team">
<text>The Liberal Democrats are a political party in the United Kingdom. While in opposition, the Leader of the Liberal Democrats appoints a frontbench team of members of Parliament (MPs), peers in the House of Lords, members of the Scottish Parliament (MSPs), and members of the Senedd (MSs) to speak for the party on different issues. Their areas of responsibility broadly corresponded to those of Government ministers. The frontbench team is divided into departmental sub-units, the principal ones being the economy, foreign policy, and home affairs. Sometimes the frontbench team consists of more than just the principal positions.

==Status==
Formerly, the Liberal Democrats&#x27; frontbench team did not use the term &#x27;Shadow Cabinet&#x27;, with assorted frontbench spokespeople covering areas (e.g., Defence and Foreign Affairs) rather than directly shadowing specific Cabinet portfolios. Under Charles Kennedy&#x27;s leadership, and with the number of Liberal Democrat MPs growing after the 1997 general election, the senior members of the frontbench team began referring to themselves as a Shadow Cabinet. This was controversial, because in the two-party political system that dominated UK politics in the 20th century, the term &#x27;Shadow Cabinet&#x27; referred to senior members of the frontbench team of the largest single opposition party in the House of Commons. This party, known as the Official Opposition, has constitutional status, although its Shadow Cabinet does not. Following Kennedy&#x27;s decision to change the nomenclature, the UK Parliament&#x27;s website used for a time the term &#x27;Liberal Democrat Shadow Cabinet&#x27; in place of the old term &#x27;Frontbench Team&#x27;.

This is not without contention, and was disputed by the Conservative Party, who were then the Official Opposition to a Labour government. However, the official listing at the Parliament website is explicit in using the term &#x27;Shadow Cabinet&#x27;. In 2001, Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown said the following in the House of Commons:

Later in his chancellorship, Brown returned to this theme, comparing his frosty relationship with the official Shadow Chancellor George Osborne with his apparently warm relationship with Vince Cable (whom he referred to as &quot;the Shadow Chancellor from Twickenham&quot;).

The Official Opposition receives support for its official function which is denied to smaller opposition parties, although they, along with every parliamentary party, do receive Short Money. While the Opposition Leader and Chief Whips draw salaries, their counterparts in smaller opposition parties do not. The Official Opposition also has the exclusive use of facilities within Parliament.

Following the 2010 general election and the confirmation of Conservative leader David Cameron as Prime Minister on 11 May 2010, a coalition cabinet was formed that included Liberal Democrat ministers, including Liberal leader Nick Clegg as Deputy Prime Minister and Lord President of the Council. Thus, the Liberal Democrats entered the Cabinet for the first time since the all-party War Government led by Winston Churchill in the early 1940s.

Following the 2015 general election, the Liberal Democrats were reduced to just eight seats in the House of Commons, falling into joint fourth place with the Democratic Unionist Party behind the Scottish National Party (SNP) for the first time. As a result of this, Parliament&#x27;s website listed the SNP&#x27;s frontbench team (in comparison with the Conservative Cabinet and Labour Shadow Cabinet) in lieu of the Liberal Democrat frontbench team. The Liberal Democrats returned as the third largest party following the 2024 general election, behind the Conservatives (the official opposition) and Labour (the governing party).

<doc id="923343" wikidata="Q2638294" url="?curid=923343" title="Ethnoarchaeology">
<text>Ethnoarchaeology is the ethnographic study of peoples for archaeological reasons, usually through the study of the material remains of a society (see David &amp; Kramer 2001). Ethnoarchaeology aids archaeologists in reconstructing ancient lifeways by studying the material and non-material traditions of modern societies. Ethnoarchaeology also aids in the understanding of the way an object was made and the purpose of what it is being used for. Archaeologists can then infer that ancient societies used the same techniques as their modern counterparts given a similar set of environmental circumstances.

One good example of ethnoarchaeology is that of Brian Hayden (1987), whose team examined the manufacture of Mesoamerican quern-stones, providing valuable insights into the manufacture of prehistoric quern-stones. Many other studies have focused on the manufacture and use of ceramics, architecture, food, fiber, and other types of material culture. In the best cases, these studies have involved long-term ethnographic fieldwork (for example, Herbich 1987, Kramer 1997, Deal 1998, Dietler &amp; Herbich 1998, Hinshaw 2000, Longacre &amp; Skibo 2000, Kohn 2010).

==Origins and development==
Although ethnography has long been used by archaeologists to draw analogies to the past, ethnographic data is not gathered with specifically archaeological goals in mind. Ethnoarchaeology developed as a response to the feeling among archaeologists that ethnography did not adequately answer their own specific research questions.

American archaeologist Jesse Walter Fewkes first mentioned the &quot;ethno-archaeologist&quot; in 1900, and encouraged archaeologists to conduct their own ethnographic fieldwork. Widespread acceptance of ethnoarchaeology as a true subdiscipline of archaeology did not emerge until the late 1950s and 1960s, as archaeologists began to explore the different scientific applications it might have.
Ethnoarchaeology today has become a widely accepted research practice, with a few archaeologists even identifying as &quot;ethnoarchaeologists&quot; rather than simply &quot;archaeologists.&quot;

==Analogy==
Analogy in archaeology is, essentially, applying observed behavior to non-observed behavior. It is perhaps one of the most used research tools in archaeological interpretation. Analogies can best be drawn between those cultures who share similar environments. More importantly, these cultures must interact with their habitats in ways that are comparable to one another.

It is important to keep in mind that analogies can only provide clues and not sound, definitive answers to research questions. For this reason, G.S. McCall calls for a comparative view for analysis in his cross-cultural study of the Gamo and Konso of southern and central Ethiopia, the Siberian Chukchi, highland New Guinea, highland Maya of Guatemala and Mexico, central, northern, and western arid regions of Australia, the Tjmba of northern Namibia, and the Xeta of Amazonia and their uses of lithics.

===Formal analogies===
Formal analogies are made with the assumption that, as Paul Lane describes, &quot;because two objects or contexts share a similar appearance or shape, they are likely to share other properties as well, typically that of function.&quot; One of the major issues with this approach is that often these objects or contexts that initially appeared similar may have been used for very different purposes or served different functions. Perhaps the different objects were even created differently. In a 1971 study, Gould and his team compared working edge angle of Mousterain Quina scrapers and modern Western Desert Aboriginal scrapers and found the Mousterain angles to be steeper. Gould reasoned this was due to the Western Desert Aborigines retouching the scrapers further than the Hominids of the Mousterian. Gould et al. concluded that this method of studying ethnographic tool use for comparison could be employed to determine what tools were used for.

===Relational analogies===
Relational analogies are opposite from formal analogies. Instead of just drawing the conclusions, one must prove the relationship, and both sides of the analogy are studied and a relationship must be demonstrated between the ethnographic object and the archaeological object.

==Direct historical approach==
One popular method in ethnoarchaeology is the use of the direct historical approach. This approach relies on living cultures that may be closely genetically or spatially related to the archaeological culture of interest in order to form analogies that may be used to explain findings. Gould and his team explains how archaeologists should be able to measure the degree of differences between the tools found with the ethnographic material and the artifacts However, while this technique may be useful it is important to note that it does not account for cultural change over time. The &quot;folk cultural approach&quot; is the Old World equivalent to this and the term may be used in place of the direct historical approach.

==Issues==
Ethnography can provide insights of value to archaeologists into how people in the past may have lived, especially with regard to their social structures, religious beliefs and other aspects of their culture. However, it is still unclear how to relate most of the insights generated by this anthropological research to archaeological investigations. This is due to the lack of emphasis by anthropologists on the material remains created and discarded by societies and on how these material remains vary with differences in how a society is organised.

This general problem has led archaeologists (for example, London [2000]) to argue that anthropological work is not adequate for answering archaeological problems, and that archaeologists should therefore undertake ethnoarchaeological work to answer these problems. These studies have focused far more on the manufacture, use and discard of tools and other artifacts and have sought to answer such questions as what kinds of objects used in a living settlement are deposited in middens or other places where they may be preserved, and how likely an object is to be discarded near to the place where it was used.

Another issue often faced in ethnoarchaeology is the potential for a single archaeological situation to have multiple possible analogies drawn from it. A process of elimination must take place to narrow down all of the possibilities until the best solution can be discovered.

<text>E. G. Marshall (born Everett Eugene Grunz; June 18, 1914 – August 24, 1998) was an American actor. One of the first group selected for the new Actors Studio, by 1948, Marshall had performed in major plays on Broadway.

Among his film roles Marshall is perhaps best known as the unflappable and analytical Juror 4 in Sidney Lumet&#x27;s courtroom drama &quot;12 Angry Men&quot; (1957). He starred in the CBS legal drama &quot;The Defenders&quot;, played the President of the United States in &quot;Superman II&quot; (1980), and Nazi collaborator Henri Denault on the CBS prime-time drama &quot;Falcon Crest&quot; in 1982. Marshall was also known as the host of the radio drama series &quot;CBS Radio Mystery Theater&quot; (1974–1982).

==Early life==
Marshall was born Everett Eugene Grunz in Owatonna, Minnesota, the son of Hazel Irene (née Cobb) and Charles G. Grunz. During his life, he chose not to reveal what &quot;E. G.&quot; stood for, saying that it stood for &quot;Everybody&#x27;s Guess.&quot; The U.S. Social Security Claims Index states that he was listed with the Social Security Administration in June 1937 as Everett Eugene Grunz, and in December 1975 as E.G. Marshall.

Marshall claimed in interviews in later life to have attended both Carleton College and the University of Minnesota, but there is no evidence that he ever attended either institution, or had attended college at all.

==Career==
He took the surname &quot;Marshall&quot; for his acting career. Although most familiar for his later television and movie roles, which gained wide audiences, Marshall also had a distinguished Broadway career. In 1948, having already performed in the original New York productions of &quot;The Skin of Our Teeth&quot; and &quot;The Iceman Cometh&quot;, Marshall joined Marlon Brando, Montgomery Clift, Julie Harris, Kim Stanley, and 45 others to make up the first group of actors granted membership in the newly formed Actors Studio. In subsequent years, he landed the leading roles in &quot;The Crucible&quot; and &quot;Waiting for Godot&quot;.

Marshall achieved perhaps his highest profile as top-billed star of the CBS-TV legal drama &quot;The Defenders&quot; (1961-5). Marshall portrayed Manhattan defense attorney Lawrence Preston, for which he won two Emmys. He later played Dr. David Craig in the television series &quot;The Bold Ones: The New Doctors&quot; (1969–73), and Nazi collaborator Henri Denault on the CBS prime-time drama &quot;Falcon Crest&quot; in 1982.

In 1973, Marshall returned to the live stage to play the title role in a well-received production of &quot;Macbeth&quot; at the Virginia Museum Theatre in Richmond, Virginia, under the direction of Keith Fowler. The production was highly praised by the &quot;New York Times&quot;. From January 1974 until February 1982, Marshall was an occasional participant and the original host of the popular nightly radio drama, &quot;The CBS Radio Mystery Theater&quot;.

In film, Marshall was known for playing Juror 4 in &quot;12 Angry Men&quot; (1957), District Attorney Harold Horn in &quot;Compulsion&quot; (1959), Colonel Jerome Pakenham in &quot;Town Without Pity&quot; (1961), Colonel Rufus S. Bratton in &quot;Tora! Tora! Tora!&quot; (1970), Arthur in &quot;Interiors&quot; (1978), the President of the United States in &quot;Superman II&quot; (1980), Arthur &quot;Art&quot; Smith (Ellen&#x27;s father) in &quot;National Lampoon&#x27;s Christmas Vacation&quot; (1989), John N. Mitchell in &quot;Nixon&quot; (1995), and Walter Sullivan in &quot;Absolute Power&quot; (1997). His final performance was a reprisal of his role as Lawrence Preston in two TV Movies based on &quot;The Defenders&quot;.

Marshall was selected as a Fellow of the American Bar Association and an officer of the American Judicature Society, a national organization of judges, lawyers, and lay persons devoted to promoting the effective administration of justice.

==Personal life==
Marshall was married twice. He married Helen Wolf in 1931. They had two daughters—Jill and Degen. Their marriage ended in divorce in 1953. He married Judith Coy in 1958. They had two sons and a daughter — Sam, Jud, and Sarah. They remained married until his death.

As a member of the Committee for National Health Insurance, Marshall was a long-time advocate of government-provided health care in the United States. During the 1968 United States presidential campaign, he filmed and narrated a political advertisement endorsing Democratic candidate Hubert Humphrey.

==Death==
Marshall died of lung cancer at his home in Bedford, New York, on August 24, 1998, at age 84.

<doc id="923353" wikidata="Q146629" url="?curid=923353" title="Slovenia at the 2004 Summer Olympics">
<text>Slovenia competed at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece, from 13 to 29 August 2004. This was the nation&#x27;s fourth consecutive appearance at the Summer Olympics since the post-Yugoslav era. The Slovenian Olympic Committee () sent the nation&#x27;s largest ever delegation to the Games in Olympic history. A total of 79 athletes, 56 men and 23 women, competed in 10 sports. For the second consecutive time, men&#x27;s handball was the only team-based sport in which Slovenia had its representation at these Games.

The Slovenian team featured three defending Olympic champions from Sydney: double sculls pair Iztok Čop and Luka Špik, and rifle shooter Rajmond Debevec, who became the first Slovenian to compete in six Olympic Games (including two appearances for Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia). Sprinter Merlene Ottey, who granted a dual citizenship in 2002, also set a historic milestone as the first female track and field athlete to participate in seventh Olympics, although she appeared for her native Jamaican team in previous editions. Handball team goalkeeper Beno Lapajne was appointed by the committee to carry the Slovenian flag in the opening ceremony.

Slovenia left Athens with a total of four medals, one silver and bronze, failing to achieve an Olympic gold for the first time since the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta. Unable to defend their Olympic rowing title from the previous Games, Čop and Špik managed to settle only for the silver after losing out to France by two seconds in the men&#x27;s double sculls. Meanwhile, the remaining medals were awarded to the athletes for the first time in women&#x27;s judo and sailing.

<text>Northern China () and Southern China () are two approximate regions that display certain differences in terms of their geography, demographics, economy, and culture.

== Extent ==
The Qinling–Daba Mountains serve as the transition zone between northern and southern China. They approximately coincide with the 0 degree Celsius isotherm in January, the isohyet, and the 2,000-hour sunshine duration contour. The Huai River basin serves a similar role, and the course of the Huaihe has been used to set different policies to the north and the south.

Historically, populations migrated from the north to the south, especially its coastal areas and along major rivers.

After the fall of the Han dynasty, The Southern and Northern Dynasties (420–589) ruled their respective part of China before re-uniting under the Tang dynasty.

During the Qing dynasty, regional differences and identification in China fostered the growth of regional stereotypes. Such stereotypes often appeared in historic chronicles and gazetteers and were based on geographic circumstances, historical and literary associations (e.g. people from Shandong, were considered upright and honest) and Chinese cosmology (as the south was associated with the fire element, Southerners were considered hot-tempered). These differences were reflected in Qing dynasty policies, such as the prohibition on local officials to serve their home areas, as well as conduct of personal and commercial relations. In 1730, the Kangxi Emperor made the observation in the &quot;Tingxun Geyan&quot; (庭訓格言):
During the Republican period, Lu Xun, a major Chinese writer, wrote:

== Today ==

=== Climate ===
Northern regions of China have long winters that are cold and dry, often below freezing, and long summers that are hot and humid. Transitional periods are short. The ecology is simple and not resilient to droughts.

Many southern regions are subtropical and green year round. The winters are short. They often experience typhoons and the East Asian monsoon in the summer. The ecology is complex, and floods are more common.

=== Diet and produce ===
The northern regions are easier to cultivate. Hardy crops such as corn, sorghum, soybeans, and wheat are grown, and one to two crops are produced each year. The growing season lasts four to six months. Wheat-based food such as bread, dumplings, and noodles are more common.

Cultivation of the southern regions began later in history. Warm temperatures and abundant rainfall help produce rice and tropical fruits. Two to three crops can be grown each year, and the growing season lasts nine to twelve months. Rice-based food is more common.

=== Language and people ===
Jones Lamprey, a British army surgeon in 1868, writes that northerners have lighter skin tones than southerners, although the shade can change greatly from season to season depending on an individual&#x27;s exposure to sunlight when performing manual labor outdoors. Northerners are often taller than southerners.

Variants of Mandarin are widely spoken in northern regions and often with a rhotic accent. Ethnic groups are comparatively more diverse in southern regions. Rhotic accent is usually absent from the Mandarin spoken there. Different dialects are less mutually intelligible, and additional languages such as Cantonese or Hokkien are spoken. Patrilineage organizations are larger and more integrated in rural southern regions, possibly due to merges and competition for territory.

A series of studies on regional differences in China suggest that people from places that grow wheat have different social styles and thought styles from those in rice-growing regions. Respondents from northern China are found to be more individualistic, think more analytically, and more open to strangers. Those from the southern regions are more likely to think holistically, interdependent, and draw a larger distinction between friends and strangers. The difference was attributed to the growing of rice, which often requires the sharing labor and managing shared irrigation infrastructure.

=== Transportation ===
Traveling between places tends to be easier in northern regions where the terrain is more even.

=== Economy ===
As China modernized, the north initially developed faster due to planned economic policies, Soviet aid, and its concentration of construction and resource extraction industries. After market reforms, however, the south took the lead due to manufacturing and eventually high-tech industries, as well as continued internal migration into the region.

===Health===
A research showed that life expectancy was slightly higher in Southern China compared to Northern China. In 2018, it was 76.66 years for North and 77.35 for South. According to the data from a survey in 2011, people in Southern China were 10.51% less likely to be obese and overweight compared to the North.

<text>North China () is a region of the People&#x27;s Republic of China. It consists of five provincial administrative regions, namely Beijing, Tianjin, Hebei, Shanxi, and Inner Mongolia.

Part of the larger region of Northern China (&quot;Beifang&quot;), it lies north of the Qinling–Huaihe Line, with its heartland in the North China Plain. Most inhabitants here speak variants of Northern Chinese languages such as Mandarin, which includes Beijing dialect and its cousin variants. The Beijing dialect is largely the basis of Standard Chinese (or Standard Mandarin), the official language of the People&#x27;s Republic of China. Jin Chinese and Mongolian are also widely spoken due to the political and cultural history of the area.

==History==

In prehistory, the region was home to the Yangshao and Longshan cultures. Peking Man was found near modern-day Beijing.

The main agricultural lands of China lay in the area known as the Central Plain, an area located bordered by the Yangtze River to its south and the Yellow River to its north. Further north of the Yellow River lies the Gobi Desert and steppe lands that extend west across Eurasia. This region has long, harsh winters. It has relatively little in the way of water resources.

Despite these challenges, some forms of agriculture have been successful in this region, especially animal husbandry, certainly of horse and camel, and possibly other types of animals. The crops &quot;Panicum miliaceum&quot; and &quot;Setaria italica&quot;, both types of millet grain, are believed to be indigenous to northern China. &quot;Panicum miliaceum&quot; is known from the Cishan culture in Hebei province, recovered as phytoliths from pits in stratigraphic sections. Sediments from the pits have radiocarbon dates from 8500 to 7500 BCE. Archaeological evidence of charred grains found in early Holocene layers in Hebei province at Nanzhuangtou and Cishan has led scholars to revise the earliest dates associated with millet by about two millennia. Millet sites are concentrated along the boundaries of the Loess and Mongolian Plateau, separated by a mountain chain from the Huabei plain and the Dongbei plain, North China&#x27;s main alluvial plains, located to the west. Millet cultivation was similarly situated relative to the Qinling mountains at Dadiwan, and the Yitai mountains at Yuezhuang. Macrofossil evidence (charred grains of foxtail and broomcorn millet) has been recovered from Xinglonggou in Inner Mongolia, Xinle in Liaoning, Cishan in Hebei, and Dadiwan in Gansu, among other sites in Eastern and Central China.

<text>The Kodiak National Wildlife Refuge is a United States National Wildlife Refuge in the Kodiak Archipelago in southwestern Alaska, United States.

==Description==
The Kodiak National Wildlife Refuge includes the southwestern two-thirds of Kodiak Island, Uganik Island, the Red Peaks area of Afognak Island and all of Ban Island in the archipelago. It encompasses . The refuge is administered from offices in Kodiak.

The refuge contains seven major rivers and about 100 streams. It is a spawning ground for all five species of Pacific Ocean salmon, steelhead, Dolly Varden, and several other fish species; as well as a nesting ground for 250 species of bird, many of which feed on salmon. The refuge has only six native species of mammals: Kodiak bear, red fox, river otter, ermine, little brown bat and tundra vole. The non-native mammals Sitka black-tailed deer, mountain goat, Roosevelt elk, caribou, marten, red squirrel, snowshoe hare, and beaver were introduced to the archipelago between the 1920s and 1950s and are now hunted and trapped. An estimated 2,300 brown bears inhabit the refuge, and an estimated 1200 bald eagles nest here every year.

The climate of the refuge is that of southern Alaska, mild and rainy. Many areas in the refuge are densely forested with Sitka spruce at lower elevations. There are grasslands in drier areas, shrub habitats dominated by dense alder, and alpine habitats at higher elevations. The refuge contains several small glaciers.

The refuge has no road access from the outside but contains part of a private road used for access to the Terror Lake hydroelectric facility. Public use of this road is prohibited.

== Holocene archaeology ==
&quot;The archaeological record contains several seemingly abrupt changes suggesting population replacements to some, but the current view, followed here, is that there has been long-term cultural continuity.&quot; (Ames et al., p. 61)

The Late Holocene contains four cultural periods: the &quot;Early Kachemak&quot;, the &quot;Late Kachemak&quot;, the &quot;Koniag&quot;, and the &quot;Alutiiq&quot;. Each period will be broken down by time period, also including the significance of each.

# Early Kachemak (1850–500 BC) = The period is marked by the shift in mobility patterns: residential foragers to logistical collectors. Dwellings were small in size. Technology and subsistence activities were made more efficient. More efficient ways of processing food were introduced. Material remains include toggling harpoons, netweights, ground slate points, nets, ulus (chopping knife). The Ocean Bay people were the first to inhabit the area. They were considered to be a maritime people, but exploited both marine and terrestrial resources, including mammals and fish. Their only hunting kit included hooks, lines, harpoons, and lances with chipped stone points. By the Middle Holocene, more specialized tool kits were introduced. Originally living in small, dispersed settlements, the small 2-3m tents were replaced by small pit houses around 2000 BC.
# Late Kachemak (500 BC – AD 1200) = The period is marked by large populations. Logistical patterns of mobility kept increasing, and community sizes increased, having up to ten dwellings. Storage facilities are also introduced. Mortuary practices are considered to be elaborate, and the finding of labrets suggest that social differentiation increased. Craft specialization increased as well. 
# Koniag (AD 1200 – European contact) = The population reached its peak. Houses and settlement sizes continued to increase, suggesting the development of social ranking. Architecture started to become more elaborate and storage features kept increasing in size. Shift in location toward the coast suggests better access to marine resources, specifically to whales. &quot;There is also evidence of intensified salmon fishing, food production and processing specializations, exchange, and investment in carpentry&quot;. (Ames et al., p. 62)
# Alutiiq (Modern) = These islands are the original or traditional homes of the Alutiiqu (previously Koniag) peoples. The coastal environment provided excellent productivity for these people, as the terrestrial environment seemed somewhat low or lacked natural resources.

<text>Pine Island Sound is located in Lee County, Florida, lying between Pine Island and the barrier islands of Sanibel Island, Captiva Island, North Captiva Island and Cayo Costa, which separate the Sound from the Gulf of Mexico. The Sound connects to Gasparilla Sound and Charlotte Harbor to the north, and to San Carlos Bay and the Caloosahatchee River to the south. The Sound is conterminous with the Pine Island Sound Aquatic Preserve, which was established in 1970 and consists of of submerged land. Important habitats in the Sound include mangroves, seagrasses, salt marshes, oyster communities, tidal flats and sponge beds. All animals in and around Pine Island sound, including mollusks, fish, birds and mammals, are affected by periodic outbreaks of red tide (&quot;Karenia brevis&quot;). The Sound is relatively shallow in many locations, and boaters are cautioned to utilize up-to-date charts and tide tables.

For thousands of years, the Sound was home to the Calusa Indians and their ancestors. The 67-acre Pineland Archeological District faces the Sound on the western shore of Pine Island. The Pineland site features several shell mounds, including a burial mound. The Mark Pardo Shellworks Site is on Cayo Costa Island, on the east side of the sound. Useppa Island, in the northern part of the sound, has a long history of occupation documented by archaeologists. In the 18th and 19th centuries Pine Island Sound was the site of seasonal camps used by Cubans catching fish for the Havana market.

The Sound is also centerpiece of the Great Calusa Blueway paddling trail, a 190-mile canoe and kayak trail.

<text>Count Aleksey Konstantinovich Tolstoy (; – ), often referred to as A. K. Tolstoy, was a Russian poet, novelist, and playwright. He is considered to be the most important nineteenth-century Russian historical dramatist, primarily on account of the strength of his dramatic trilogy &quot;The Death of Ivan the Terrible&quot; (1866), &quot;Tsar Fyodor Ioannovich&quot; (1868), and &quot;Tsar Boris&quot; (1870). He also gained fame for his satirical works, published under his own name (&quot;History of the Russian State from Gostomysl to Timashev&quot;, &quot;The Dream of Councillor Popov&quot;) and under the collaborational pen name of Kozma Prutkov. His fictional works include the novella &quot;The Family of the Vourdalak&quot;, &quot;The Vampire&quot; (1841), and the historical novel &quot;Prince Serebrenni&quot; (1862).

Aleksey was a member of the Tolstoy family, and a second cousin of Leo Tolstoy. Due to his mother&#x27;s closeness with the court of the Tsar, Aleksey was admitted to the future Alexander II&#x27;s childhood entourage and became &quot;a comrade in games&quot; for the young Crown Prince. As a young man Tolstoy traveled widely, including trips to Italy and Germany, where he met Johann Wolfgang von Goethe. Tolstoy began his education at home under the tutelage of his uncle the writer Antony Pogorelsky, under whose influence he first became interested in writing poetry, and a number of other teachers. In 1834 Tolstoy enrolled in the Moscow Foreign Ministry State Archive as a student. In December 1835 he completed exams (in the English, French, and German languages as well as in literature, Latin, World and Russian history, and Russian statistics) at the University of Moscow.

Throughout the 1840s, Tolstoy led a busy high society life, full of pleasure trips, salon parties and balls, hunting sprees, and fleeting romances. He also spent many years in state service as a bureaucrat and diplomat. In 1856, on the day of his Coronation, Alexander II appointed Tolstoy one of his personal aide-de-adjutants. Tolstoy served as an infantry major in the Crimean War. He eventually left state service in the early 1860s to pursue his literary career. He died in 1875 of a self-administered lethal dose of morphine at his Krasny Rog estate in the Chernigov Governorate.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Alexey Konstantinovich Tolstoy was born in Saint Petersburg to the famed family of Tolstoy. His father, Count Konstantin Petrovich Tolstoy (1780–1870), a son of the army general, was a Russian Assignation Bank councilor. His mother, Anna Alekseyevna Perovskaya (1796–1857), was an illegitimate daughter of Count Aleksey Kirillovich Razumovsky (1748–1822), an heir of the legendary Ukrainian hetman Alexey Razumovsky. A. K. Tolstoy&#x27;s uncle (on his father&#x27;s side) was Fyodor Tolstoy (1783–1873). His uncle on his mother&#x27;s side was Aleksey Perovsky (1787–1836), an author known under the pen name of Antony Pogorelsky. Aleksey Konstantinovich was a second cousin of Leo Tolstoy; Count Pyotr Andreyevich Tolstoy was their common great-grandfather.

Konstantin Tolstoy and Anna Perovskaya&#x27;s marriage was short-lived; they divorced in October 1817. With her six weeks old son, Anna moved first to her own Blistava estate in Chernigov Governorate, then to Krasny Rog , an estate belonging to her brother Aleksey Perovsky, who became Aleksey Konstantinovich&#x27;s tutor and a long-time companion. Common knowledge has it that Pogorelsky&#x27;s famous fantasy fairytale &quot;The Black Chicken or The People of the Underground&quot; was premiered at home, his young nephew being the only member of Pogorelsky&#x27;s audience. It was under the latter&#x27;s influence that Aleksey started to write poetry, as early as 1823, inspired by some old books he found at home. Aleksey had good teachers and at the age of six he fluently spoke French, German and English. Later he learned Italian as well.

As for the Tolstoys, Anna Perovskaya stopped seeing them altogether, only sending them postcards on major dates and holidays. Remembering those happy years, Aleksey later wrote: 
In early 1826 Anna Perovskaya returned to Saint Petersburg with her brother and son. Here, due to his mother&#x27;s closeness with the court of the Tsar, Aleksey was admitted to the future Tsar Alexander II&#x27;s childhood entourage and in August became what was officially termed &quot;a comrade in games&quot; for the young Crown Prince. Aleksey&#x27;s duties were not many: he had to visit the Crown Prince in Saint Petersburg and Tsarskoye Selo, take walks with him on Yelagin Island and participate in games, many of which were, in effect, small scale military exercises. They became friends and this friendship lasted for several decades, ending in the mid-1860s. In autumn of 1826 Aleksey met Aleksander Pushkin for the first time.

In summer 1827 the family visited Germany where in Weimar young Aleksey met Goethe. The great man greeted the boy very warmly and left him a fragment of a mammoth tusk with his own drawing (depicting a frigate) on it, for a present. Aleksey, having been awe-stricken, remembered little: &quot;Only his magnificent features and the way he took me upon his lap,&quot; according to his autobiography. The family spent the next ten years in continuous travel, both in Russia and abroad. An 1831 trip to Italy especially impressed the 13-year-old. &quot;Back in Russia I fell into a deep nostalgic depression, longing for Italy which felt like a real motherland; desperately mourning the loss, I cried at night when my dreams carried me off to this Paradise lost,&quot; he wrote in his autobiography decades later. In Italy the family met Karl Bryullov. On 10 May 1831, Aleksey wrote in his diary: &quot;Bryullov dined with us and left a sketch in my album.&quot; The painter promised Perovsky to make portraits of all three of them once he was back in Russia, but five years later he had finished only one, that of his nephew.

===Career===
In 1834 Tolstoy enrolled in the Moscow Foreign Ministry State Archive as a &quot;student&quot;, where he got his first taste of working with real historical documents. In December 1835 he completed exams (in English, French and German languages and literature, Latin, World and Russian history, and Russian statistics) at the University of Moscow for the formal 1st Grade State Bureaucrat certificate. He soon embarked on a career in the Economic Affairs and Statistics Department in Saint Petersburg. Before that, in July 1836, he had buried his uncle Aleksey Perovsky (who died in Warsaw of tuberculosis) and had become heir to his Krasny Rog estate. Also in 1835 Aleksey showed some of his new poems to Vasily Zhukovsky, who praised them. There&#x27;s evidence that Pushkin also approved of the young poet&#x27;s early works, giving him full moral support. Tolstoy wrote a lot, refining his technique, but wasn&#x27;t eager to get published. &quot;My first experiments were, no doubt, absurd, but at least metrically they were flawless. I went on training thus for many years, before I debuted... as a prose writer, not a poet,&quot; he remembered later. 

In January 1837 Tolstoy became attached to the Russian Embassy in Frankfurt where he spent the next two years. The assignment was rather formal; it did not demand Tolstoy&#x27;s presence in Germany and he spent most of his time in Saint Petersburg, leading a merry life, spending up to three thousand rubles per month, often traveling to Italy and France. It was during one of these visits that he wrote his first two &quot;gothic&quot; novellas – &quot;The Family of the Vourdalak&quot; and &quot;Three Hundred Years On&quot; (originally in German, later translated into Russian by Boleslav Markevich). Tolstoy showed great interest in all things macabre, influenced, again, by his late uncle who &quot;was obsessed with mysticism in every possible form&quot; and who, in turn, was influenced by E. T. A. Hoffmann whom he was personally acquainted with.

In late 1840 Tolstoy was transferred back to Russia to a position in the Tsar&#x27;s Imperial State Chancellery 2nd Department where he continued to work for many years, slowly rising in the hierarchy. As time went by, though, he showed less and less enthusiasm, for the demands of his position had come to feel like a major hindrance to his literary aspirations. In May 1841 Tolstoy debuted with &quot;The Vampire&quot; (a novella published under the pen name of &quot;Krasnorogsky&quot;, a reference to Krasny Rog, his residence). Complicated in structure, multi-layered and rich in counterpoints, featuring both the element of &quot;horror&quot; and political satire, it instantly caught the attention of Vissarion Belinsky who praised its &quot;obviously still very young, but undoubtedly gifted author,&quot; totally unaware of the latter&#x27;s real identity. Tolstoy himself saw the story as insignificant and made no attempt to include it in any of the subsequent compilations; it was only in 1900 that &quot;The Vampire&quot; was re-issued. In the autumn of 1843 Tolstoy debuted as a poet: his poem &quot;Serebryanka&quot; was published in the No.40 edition of &quot;Listok Dlya Svetskikh Lyudey&quot; (The Paper for Fashionable People).

It took another two years for him to see his second short story, &quot;Artyomy Semyonovich Bervenkovsky&quot;, a homage to the so-called &#x27;natural school&#x27; apparently written under the influence of Nikolai Gogol&#x27;s &quot;Dead Souls&quot;, published in the 1st volume of Count Vladimir Sollogub&#x27;s &quot;Yesterday and Today&quot; almanac. The 2nd volume featured &quot;Amena&quot;, a novella, described as an extract from a novel called &quot;Stebelovsky&quot; which remained unfinished. Belinsky responded negatively to this publication, describing the piece as &quot;rather dull&quot;, and an &quot;unfortunate manifestation of mental irritation picked from Chateaubriand&quot; (meaning apparently &quot;Les Martyrs&quot;, 1809).

Throughout the 1840s Tolstoy led a busy high society life, full of pleasure trips, salon parties and balls, hunting sprees and fleeting romances. He was described as &quot;a handsome young man with blonde hair and a freshly coloured face&quot; and was renowned for his physical strength, &quot;bending spoons, forks and horse-shoes and driving nails into walls with one finger.&quot; One notable business trip to Kaluga in 1850 led to a close friendship with Nikolai Gogol (whom he first met in Frankfurt and then in Rome). Tolstoy recited to Gogol many of his yet unpublished poems and fragments from what later became the novel &quot;Prince Serebryany&quot;. Gogol read him the second part of his novel &quot;Dead Souls&quot;. Among other friendships he struck up in the forties were those with Ivan Aksakov, Pavel Annenkov, Nikolai Nekrasov, Ivan Panaev and Ivan Turgenev.

In the early 1850s, in collaboration with the Zhemchuzhnikov brothers, Tolstoy created the fictional writer Kozma Prutkov, a petty bureaucrat with great self-esteem who parodied the poetry of the day and soon became famous for his utterly banal aphorisms. In 1851 Prutkov debuted with &quot;The Fantasy&quot; a comedy which was signed &quot;Y&quot; and &quot;Z&quot; and written by Tolstoy and Aleksey Zhemchuzhnikov. The play, mocking the then popular &quot;nonsense&quot; vaudeville premiered on 8 January in the Alexandrinsky Theatre. This spectacular farce (featuring at one point a dozen small dogs running about on stage) caused a huge scandal, was promptly banned by Nikolay I (who was among the audience) and remained unpublished until 1884.

It was also in 1851 that Tolstoy first met Sophia Andreyevna Miller (1827?–1892), the wife of a cavalry colonel (whom she later divorced with great difficulty) and an impressively well-educated woman who knew fourteen languages, at a Bolshoy Theater masquerade. Tolstoy fell in love with her but had to wait for another twelve years before they were able to marry. Miller had, apparently, a perfect artistic taste and Tolstoy later referred to her as his harshest and most objective critic, as well as the best friend he&#x27;d ever had. All of his love lyrics from 1851 onwards were written for and about Sophia. Many of his poems (&quot;My dear bluebells&quot;, &quot;Amidst the ball uproar&quot;, &quot;Brighter than the skylark&#x27;s singing&quot;, &quot;The wind from high up, it is not...&quot;) have been set to music by renowned composers and have become famous Russian romances.

In 1854 &quot;Sovremennik&quot; magazine published several of Tolstoy&#x27;s verses (&quot;My bluebells&quot;, &quot;Oh you haystacks...&quot; and others), which instantly got critics talking, and also the first of Kozma Prutkov&#x27;s humorously pompous poetic exercises. The latter was not so much a collective pseudonym, as a character who was making quite a point of coming across as a &quot;real&quot; creature, performing, among other things, obnoxious pranks, one of which involved a messenger visiting all the leading Saint Petersburg architects late at night with the urgent news of the Isaakiyevsky Cathedral having fallen down and urging them to appear early next morning at the court of Tsar Nikolay I, which they hastily did, to the Tsar&#x27;s utter annoyance.

As the Crimean War broke out, Tolstoy&#x27;s first intention was to gather a partisan fighting unit and lead it to the Baltic Sea, should the English decide to land there. Along with Count Aleksey Bobrinsky (future Minister of transport) he started to finance and equip two partisan squads, forty fighters each. He bought some ammunition from Tula and traveled all along the Baltic coastline, examining what was supposed to be his future theater of war, the Crown Prince being totally unaware of his plans. On 2 September the allies landed at Yevpatoria and Tolstoy headed South, to join the Imperial infantry regiment (under the command of Lev Perovsky, another of his uncles) as an army major, in March 1855. The regiment went only as far as Odessa where a thousand men were lost from typhoid. In February 1856 Tolstoy became one of the casualties. In Odessa he was nursed back to health by Sophia Miller. Alexander II was telegraphed daily on the subject of his old friend&#x27;s condition, at his personal request. In May 1855 Tolstoy was back on his feet, but the war was over for him; he instead embarked upon a Crimean journey with Sophia.

After the War, in 1856, on the day of his Coronation, Alexander II appointed Tolstoy as one of his personal aide-de-camp. It was only three years later that Tolstoy managed to get rid of this tiresome privilege which implied regular duties in the Palace, interfering with his now burgeoning literary career. &quot;You cannot imagine what a storm of rhymes rages in me, what waves of poetry are sweeping through me, longing to break free,&quot; he wrote in a letter to Sophia Miller. Two thirds of Tolstoy&#x27;s poetic legacy was created in the late 1850s. 1857 saw the publication of a large poem called &quot;The Sinner&quot;. It was followed by the more significant &quot;Ioann Damaskin&quot;, first published in &quot;Russkaya Beseda&quot; January 1859 issue. The poem, dealing with the nature of poetry and the poet&#x27;s position in society, but also hinting at the author&#x27;s personal plight, caused scandal. The head of the 3rd Department Prince Vasily Dolgorukov ordered the printing of the magazine to be stopped and for the poem to be removed. The Minister of Education Evgraf Kovalevsky personally permitted the publication, his rather daring decision causing a serious rift between the two departments.

Tolstoy&#x27;s poems were appearing in virtually all the major Russian magazines of the time, regardless of their ideological inclinations. Yet, in 1857 his relationship with the leftist &quot;Sovremennik&quot; group became strained. Tolstoy drifted towards the Slavophiles and their &quot;Russkaya Beseda&quot; magazine, becoming a close friend of Ivan Aksakov and Aleksey Khomyakov, but this liaison was short-lived too. In the 1860s he found himself in a strange position of being a highly popular author, criticized fiercely both from the left and from the right. As to the reasons for this, A.K. Tolstoy was never in doubt. In an autobiographical letter to Angelo de Gubernatis he wrote: 
Tolstoy caused much controversy with his scathing remarks aimed at contemporary government officials (Alexander Timashev, Vladimir Butkov, Ivan Veillot) whom he – a supporter of the monarch – considered real enemies of the State. He also criticized the activities of the 3rd Department, and in the wake of the Polish uprising was one of the very few people in the Court to openly denounce Muravyov the Hangman&#x27;s draconian methods of political repression.

A fierce opponent of xenophobia, he saw Russia as a European country, and Russians as Europeans. This clashed with the Slavophile doctrine of maintaining Russia&#x27;s &quot;special place&quot; in the world. &quot;[Speaking] of slavophiles, Khomyakov sickens me when he places [Russia] above the West just on the strength of our being Orthodox,&quot; Tolstoy wrote in a letter. All the while, well-publicized was his dispute with Turgenev, who saw the French state as Russia&#x27;s potential guiding light. &quot;What France is moving towards is the dictatorship of mediocrity,&quot; Tolstoy argued. Being neither a westernizer nor a slavophile, Tolstoy annoyed both parties by his infatuation with pre-Tatar Russian society which he idealized whole-heartedly, seeing it as an Eastern strain of European knighthood, based on the cult of the nobleman. Also causing controversy were Tolstoy&#x27;s critique of the West&#x27;s amoral pragmatism and socialist ideas, his dismissal of the Russian imperial ideals which he saw as tragically flawed, and his own doctrine of a centralized Russia, the vile Moscovia State being, in his view, at the root of all Russian political evil. This eclectic &quot;political romanticism&quot; appeared to be in conflict with every political and social trend of the time.

Tolstoy rejected some ecclesiastical teachings, calling them the &quot;church&#x27;s argo&quot; and believed in God as a &quot;higher being&quot; and cosmic mind. &quot;I believe God gave us the power of emotion so we could go further than our mind leads us. As a leading force, human emotion is preferable to a thought, just as music is more perfect than a spoken word,&quot; he wrote.

====1861–1875====

In 1861 Tolstoy quit the Court. &quot;For quite some time I was under the illusion that I&#x27;d be able to suppress my artistic nature but life taught me different; this struggle was futile. Service and the arts are incompatible,&quot; he wrote in a letter to disappointed Alexander II. &quot;Tolstoy represented a rare type of man who not only evaded by every possible means the favours and laurels that came his way, but had to go through painfully tedious battles with people who, driven by the best of intentions, were imposing every opportunity of making a brilliant career on him,&quot; wrote literary historian and BEED biographer Semyon Vengerov in 1903.

From then on the writer&#x27;s visits to the Palace became rare, but he used each one as an opportunity to &quot;speak the truth regardless,&quot; as he put it. In 1862 Tolstoy solicited for Ivan Aksakov who&#x27;d been banned from editing his &quot;Den&quot; (The Day) newspaper. A year later he helped Ivan Turgenev out of an exile the latter found himself in after having contacted the &quot;London propagandists&quot;, as Alexander Herzen and Nikolay Ogarev were then known. In 1864 Tolstoy tried to exert his influence upon Alexander II to make him alleviate the plight of the imprisoned Chernyshevsky. Asked by the Tsar for the latest news in the world of literature, Tolstoy said: &quot;The whole of Russia has gone into mourning for Chernyshevsky to whom an injustice has been done...&quot; - &quot;No, Tolstoy, I beg you never to remind me of Chernyshevsky, please,&quot; the monarch hastily retorted. This aborted conversation, as it happened, brought to an end a friendship that had lasted for forty years.

Tolstoy&#x27;s historical novel &quot;Prince Serebrenni&quot; (1862, &quot;Russky Vestnik&quot;), set during the time of Ivan the Terrible, was widely popular and was translated into many languages. The novel premiered at a recital evening in the Palace, and brought its author a book-trinket from the Empress consort Maria Aleksandrovna, who greatly admired Tolstoy, both as writer and a person. His poetic drama &quot;Don Juan&quot;, published the same year, was less successful: even if not officially banned, it wasn&#x27;t staged in its author&#x27;s lifetime and made its theatrical debut only in 1905, severely cut by censors. 
Kozma Prutkov aside, Tolstoy wrote satirical verses under his own name, the best known of which was the Karamzin-inspired &quot;History of the Russian State from Gostomysl to Timashev&quot; (1868), a parody on Russian history that focused on the vicious characteristics of Russian monarchs. Another satirical poem, &quot;The Dream of Councillor Popov&quot;, written in the summer of 1873, spread across Russia in hand-written form and became hugely popular. Both Leo Tolstoy and Ivan Turgenev expressed their delight at this personal swipe at the Interior Minister Pyotr Valuyev, and a mockery in general of a conservative bureaucrat trying to come across as a liberal. The poem came out in 1878, in Berlin, as a brochure, then six years later was reprinted by &quot;Russkaya Starina&quot; (No.12, 1884). 1867 saw the release of &quot;Poems&quot;, the vast collection of Tolstoy&#x27;s verse (all in all, 131 pieces), the only such compilation published in his lifetime.

Tolstoy&#x27;s lasting contribution to Russian literature was a trilogy of historical dramas (modelled after Alexander Pushkin&#x27;s &quot;Boris Godunov&quot;): &quot;The Death of Ivan the Terrible&quot;, &quot;Tsar Fyodor Ioannovich&quot;, and &quot;Tsar Boris&quot;. &quot;The Death of Ivan the Terrible&quot;, published in 1866 in &quot;Otechestvennye Zapiski&quot; magazine, was staged the following year in Saint Petersburg, Moscow, and some provincial theaters and enjoyed massive success, but after 1870 was virtually banned and got revived on stage only in the late 1890s. &quot;Tsar Fyodor Ioannovich&quot; (1868, &quot;Vestnik Evropy&quot;) was banned from being produced on stage personally by Interior minister Timashev; as late as 1907 censors deemed the play &quot;inappropriate.&quot; &quot;Tsar Boris&quot; (1870, &quot;Vestnik Evropy&quot;) received no official ban, but the Directorial council of the Imperial Theatres refused to sanction its production. In 1871 Tolstoy started his fifth and final play called &quot;Posadnik&quot; (set in the times when the Novgorod Republic prospered), which remained unfinished. Parts of it were published in &quot;Skladchina&quot;, an 1874 charity almanac, the rest appeared in &quot;Vestnik Evropy&quot; in 1876, after the author&#x27;s death.

===Later life===

Tolstoy was lenient land-owner, admired by his Krasny Rog peasants who were permitted to use his fields as common pastures and given free timber and primary education for their children in a school he built for them in 1859. In 1861 he personally gathered all of his peasants together, read them the Emancipation reform of 1861 decree, gave money to everybody present and participated in the grandiose drinking spree that followed. Being a lavish spender and having no knowledge of the practical side of life, by the end of the 1860s he found himself on the verge of bankruptcy, but loathed the idea of returning to the Tsar&#x27;s Court.

Ever since the mid-1860s Tolstoy had fallen more and more out of sync with Russian cultural life, feeling acutely his ideological and spiritual isolation. Referring to himself as an &#x27;anchorite&#x27;, he spent most of his time in Pustynka (near Saint Petersburg) and his Krasny Rog estate, worsening financial situation and deteriorating health adding to his troubles. Tired of fighting his many opponents, totally disillusioned with what he saw around him, A. K. Tolstoy wrote to his friend Boleslav Markevich in 1869:
A.K.Tolstoy entered the 1870s as a very sick man, suffering from asthma, angina pectoris, neuralgias and severe headaches. Regular visits to European medics only temporarily alleviated his conditions. In the spring of 1875 Tolstoy started taking morphine. &quot;Now I&#x27;m feeling much better, at least the neuralgia&#x27;s gone. But never before have I been so short of breath. Asthma fits are continuous,&quot; he complained in a letter to poet Karolina Pavlova (who was also a translator of his dramas) on 8 July 1875.

Aleksey Konstantinovich Tolstoy died on 28 September 1875, in Krasny Rog, Chernigov Governorate, after having given himself a lethal injection of morphine. He was buried in the family vault in the Uspenskaya Church in Krasny Rog.

== Legacy ==

Tolstoy represented the later period of Romanticism in Russian literature; art for him was a mystic link between the human world and the higher spheres where &quot;eternal ideas dwell.&quot; Along with Afanasy Fet, his artistic and spiritual ally, he saw Art as a higher science, man&#x27;s only instrument for a true and comprehensive understanding of the world. Romantic tendencies were best realised in Tolstoy&#x27;s poetry and in some of his dramas, notably &quot;Don Juan&quot; where the hero is on quest for a romantic ideal, looking everywhere for love &quot;that helps one penetrate into the wonderful universal laws, our world&#x27;s hidden beginnings,&quot; as he put it. &quot;Art can only be a &#x27;means&#x27; – all of the &#x27;ends&#x27;... it contains in itself,&quot; Tolstoy wrote in 1870, in the course of long dispute with those whom he labeled &quot;utilitarianists in literature&quot;. Such views automatically made him a &quot;conservative&quot; in the eyes of the revolutionary democrats who formed a large majority in the Russian literary circles of the 1850s and 1860s. Unlike Fet, though, Tolstoy insisted on the artist&#x27;s total independence from ideology and politics, and felt himself totally free to criticize and mock authorities, a trait that snubbed many people in high places.

Tolstoy&#x27;s poetry had certain qualities that made it unusual and even unique, one being the &quot;half-spoken&quot; nature of the verse. &quot;It&#x27;s good for poetry when a thought is only half-fulfilled, so that readers can complete it – each in their own way,&quot; he explained in a letter to Sophia Miller in 1854. This view translated into a technique of writing. One of the things Tolstoy was criticized and even jeered for were &quot;bad rhymes&quot; which he used consciously, as part of his &quot;poetic system&quot;. &quot;Imperfect rhyming, if kept in bounds of course, can be seen as corresponding to the Venetian school in painting which with little imperfections, or should I say, carelessnesses, could achieve the kind of effects which Raphael wouldn&#x27;t dream of for all of his precision,&quot; Tolstoy wrote in 1859. In fact, Tolstoy, as I. Yampolsky pointed out, was a master of versification. Consciously imposed &quot;careless&quot; rhyming gave his poems an improvisational tone (with &quot;an impression of thoughts being put to paper exactly in the form they were born&quot;) but behind it there was hard work and much editing. &quot;Tolstoy&#x27;s verse is so simple it hardly rises above prose, yet the poetic impression it carries is perfectly full,&quot; critic Nikolay Strakhov wrote in 1867. Another unusual feature of Tolstoy&#x27;s poems was the fact that, while rather salon-like and graceful both in nature and form, they were full of &#x27;simplistic&#x27; bits borrowed freely from common talk and traditional Russian folklore. Kept in perfect balance, these tinged his verse with a peculiar, musical quality. More than half of Tolstoy&#x27;s poems have been put to music by leading Russian composers like Tchaykovsky, Rimsky-Korsakov, Musorgsky, Mily Balakirev, Cesar Cui, Anton Rubinstein, Sergey Rakhmaninov and others. &quot;Tolstoy is the unfathomable well of poems crying for music. For me he is one of the most attractive poets,&quot; wrote Tchaykovsky.

Assessing Tolstoy&#x27;s poetry as a whole, D. S. Mirsky wrote: &quot;Even if they suffer from sentimentality and are occasionally banal, his lyrics retain their freshness and even now taste like a delightful morning dew,&quot; the critic wrote.

Innokenty Annensky saw Tolstoy&#x27;s poetry as being the perfect expression of &quot;pure love&quot;, the &quot;human soul&#x27;s inner beauty&quot; being the poet&#x27;s ideal. &quot;Tolstoy never wrote for children but his crystal clear idealism, tinged with mysticism, made his poetry resonate well with the period in adolescence when the human soul reaches out to something high and indescribable,&quot; Annensky wrote. Mentioning Nekrasov, who in his latter works created a strong image of the Russian mother, Annensky argued that what Tolstoy managed to create was an equally sublime portrait of the noble woman whose &quot;serene placidity belies unspeakable sadness… of the one who&#x27;s ashamed of her own happiness fearing that she, making the most of this world&#x27;s beauty, somehow takes it away from those who have no opportunity to enjoy such riches in abundance.&quot;

Tolstoy&#x27;s ballads and songs were close to traditional bylinas both in essence and form; in fact, the author himself made no distinction between the two genres. Critics argued that (unlike, say, Nekrasov) Tolstoy used folklorisms as a mere stylistic instrument, using stories from the history of the Russian Middle Ages as a means to convey his own ideas and theories (&quot;Zmei Tugarin&quot;), and to link historical utopias with relevant social comment (&quot;Boryvoi&quot;, &quot;Vasily Shibanov&quot;). Tolstoy tended to greatly idealise Russia&#x27;s pre-Mongol past which made the traditional bylina characters almost superheroes. &quot;It&#x27;s hard to recognize Alyosha Popovich, eyes-a-jealous, hands-a-grabbin&#x27;- as a romantic youth, speaking of love and devotion to his beloved,&quot; Semyon Vengerov remarked. Likewise, the fearsome Ilya Muromets who came across as a rather violent, dangerous and often sacrilegious type in folk bylinas, was portrayed by Tolstoy as a &quot;benign grandfather figure,&quot; rather gracious and well-spoken.

Critic Yuly Aykhenvald derided Tolstoy&#x27;s insistence on continuing with his &quot;nationalistic masquerade&quot; and quoted Anton Chekhov as commenting: &quot;[Tolstoy] has put the opera costume on and forgotten to take it off before leaving the theatre.&quot; According to Aykhenvald, Tolstoy failed to see that &quot;the national values, when taken to the extreme, become alien-looking.&quot; For Aykhenvald, though, it was Tolstoy&#x27;s humour that prevented him from turning into an &quot;archeology worshipper&quot;. The critic saw Tolstoy&#x27;s romanticism as universal and in a certain way religious (resulting in the fact that his most memorable character, Tsar Fyodor was &quot;an epitome of Christian meekness and grace&quot;). Yet, &quot;[Tolstoy] worshipped that kind of God who was devoid of stiffness... he was a free spirit and valued freedom most.&quot;

Tolstoy&#x27;s sense of humour was best realised in Kozma Prutkov&#x27;s extraordinary aphorisms, as well as in his own satirical poems. &quot;Tolstoy... without any doubt, is Russia&#x27;s greatest absurdist poet,&quot; wrote Mirsky. &quot;The Dream of Councillor Popov&quot; and &quot;History of the Russian State from Gostomysl to Timashev&quot;, his best known satires, were spread across Russia in manuscript, gaining huge popularity amongst all social strata. According to Mirsky, &quot;The Dream&quot; is &quot;the acme of Russian humorous poetry, mixing sharp, poignant satire... and pure delight in cheerful absurdity&quot;. It&#x27;s &quot;The Dream&quot; that can be seen as Aleksey Tolstoy&#x27;s most solid claim for immortality,&quot; the critic argued, mentioning &quot;The Uproar in the Vatican&quot; as another of his humorous masterpieces.

Tolstoy&#x27;s anti-leftist, pro-conservative sarcasm, on the other hand, received much stick from the &#x27;democratic&#x27; press. His &quot;Ballad With a Tendency&quot; was bitterly criticised by Saltykov-Schedrin while &quot;Iskra&quot; magazine parodied it in 1872 with a verse entitled &quot;A Ballad with a Pro-Police Tendency&quot;. Shchedrin, describing the current state of Russian literature as a &quot;kingdom of scoundrels&quot;, in a letter to Aleksey Zhemchuzhnikov wrote: &quot;Add to all this the fun-and-games-seeking &#x27;free artists&#x27; like Count A. K. Tolstoy who makes... our obscurantists&#x27; hearts beat faster with delight. I don&#x27;t know about you, but I find it painful to see how people whom I though honest, even if not very far-seeing, fight on the side of obscurantism, employing pseudo-folklorism as a weapon.&quot;

Tolstoy was a master of prose; both his novella &quot;The Vampire&quot; (praised by Vissarion Belinsky) and his novel &quot;Prince Serebrenni&quot; received a lot of good press. The latter, though, was criticised for being tendentious; many argued that both the main character and Yelena Morozova looked very much like people of the 19th, rather than 16th century. On the other hand, Ivan Grozny and the oprichnina horrors were depicted with great vividness and passion; the novel&#x27;s masterfully built structure, its rich musical language made it a perfect Walter Scott-type of book for adolescents, according to Vengerov. &quot;The novel is highly involving… finely structured and well-written,&quot; Ivan Turgenev wrote, recommending it to a French publisher. Still, as a prosaic Tolstoy made much less of an impact than as a poet. He’s been lauded as a classic of the 19th century Russian historical drama. D. S. Mirsky regarded Tolstoy as a dramatist superior to Aleksander Ostrovsky, describing his plays as &quot;full of intriguing ideas and brilliantly crafted characters. They impress us with intelligence and insight rather than with flights of imagination, but in &quot;Tsar Fyodor&quot; Tolstoy managed to create one of the most interesting characters in Russian literature: that of a kind and weak ruler who has a keen sense of justice but is unable to make his evil aids implement his good will.&quot;

Critics noted, though, that history as such was secondary to Tolstoy; he was driven mostly by his own personal views and feelings, tending to judge his 16th-century characters using mid-19th-century moral values. &quot;The life of today seeps through everywhere,&quot; Tolstoy himself admitted, speaking of his ballads. According to the author, historical drama had to be &quot;true&quot; only in a &quot;humanist way&quot;. &quot;A poet... has just one responsibility: to his own poetic self... human truth is his one law. Historical truth is something he is not bound to. If it fits into the concept, very good, if not, he can easily do without it,&quot; he wrote. So on the one hand, Tolstoy&#x27;s dramatic trilogy- &quot;The Death of Ivan the Terrible&quot;, &quot;Tsar Fyodor Ioannovich&quot; and &quot;Tsar Boris&quot;- was not historical in the strict sense of the word; on the other hand, it was far from being the brand of &quot;patriotic drama&quot; produced by Nestor Kukolnik or the imitation of the French &quot;tragedie des allusions&quot; which Aleksander Pushkin ridiculed. In fact, Pushkin&#x27;s attitude was the closest approximation to that of Tolstoy. The latter&#x27;s plays had their &quot;second levels&quot;, directly corresponding to contemporary political situations, but were driven mostly by the author&#x27;s historical views and theories which involved the glorifying of Russian &quot;noble men&quot; (he associated them with the boyarstvo) and the vilification Ivan Grozny whom the boyarstvo had fallen victim to.

Pavel Annenkov considered Ioann and Fyodor as &quot;loosely based upon&quot; characters, being perfectly fine but only in representing their era, not their own historical selves. &quot;They are as loose as King Lear or Hamlet were and, if they do belong more to Russian history than those two belong to English history, that is because no other reality than that of our Old Russia could have inspired [Tolstoy] in such a way, bringing him such colors, such an essence to freely draw from,&quot; the critic wrote. It was the generic closeness of Tolstoy&#x27;s plays to the Russia of old, Annenkov argued, that made them historic in the truest sense of the word, for &quot;their significance as living testimony to the spirit those people and their times is beyond doubt&quot;.

Common to the trilogy was a somewhat morbid look at the history of the Russian monarchy of the previous three centuries, where, as the author saw it, all the efficient rulers happened to be evil, and all the &#x27;good&#x27; ones proved to be inefficient. The three stories of three different historical figures had similarly didactic finales: &quot;God help you, Tsar Ivan, and God forgive us all! That&#x27;s the fate autocracy deserved! Here&#x27;s the result of our disintegration!&quot; (Zakharyin&#x27;s words over Ivan the Terrible&#x27;s dead body), &quot;I am to blame for all of this... Oh God, why did you make me Tsar?!&quot; (Tsar Fyodor), &quot;What Evil spawns is only more evil and nothing else.&quot; (Boris Godunov). All three parts of the trilogy, which, according to Nestor Kotlyarevsky, were &quot;united by the idea of tragedy being intrinsic to Tsarist power in Russia,&quot; had serious problems with the censorship. The trilogy continued to divide opinion in Russia up until 1917. Not long before the Revolution, in Alexandrinsky Theatre the public reacted to &quot;Tsar Boris&quot; in an overtly political fashion. Monarchists applauded Boris Godunov&#x27;s words, the left &quot;supported&quot; boyarin Sitsky, seeing in him a fighter of despotism.
All three plays became part of the repertoire of the leading Russian and Soviet theaters, notably the Maly Theatre, with stars like Ivan Moskvin, Pavel Olenev, Stepan Kuznetsov and Nikolai Khmelyov in the leading roles. According to I. Yampolsky, Tolstoy the dramatist, even if not on par with Pushkin, was high above his contemporaries; he created complex, multi-dimensional historical figures. &quot;In the arts, to be wary of showing weaknesses in your favourite characters is to pay them bad service... Thus one can only succeed in creating faceless dummies whom nobody would believe in,&quot; Tolstoy wrote.

In the mid-19th century Tolstoy was not taken very seriously, but his reputation started to grow after his death in 1875. Vladimir Korolenko called &quot;Tsar Fyodor Ioannovich&quot; &quot;a gem of Russian drama,&quot; that&#x27;s been shining especially bright next to &quot;the totally dismal theater repertoire of the late 19th century&quot;.

Tolstoy was highly valued by Aleksander Blok and Valery Bryusov; Ivan Bunin, otherwise harsh in his comments on fellow writers, rated him very high; Velemir Khlebnikov mentioned him among his all-time favourites and, most surprisingly (according to Korney Chukovsky), Vladimir Mayakovsky knew his poetry by heart and often recited it in public. Both Tolstoy&#x27;s poetry (the larger part of which has been transformed into classic romance) and his historical drama trilogy are regarded as an intrinsic part of the classic Russian literature of the 19th century.

<text>Avery Hayward Haines (born 28 November 1966) is an American-born Canadian television journalist, and currently managing editor, investigative journalist, and host of CTV newsmagazine series &quot;W5&quot;. Born in New Mexico, United States, Haines and her family then moved to India where they lived for six years before returning to North America. Her career as a reporter began with CFRB radio in Toronto.

==Career==

CTV Newsnet

In late 1999, Haines began to work as a fill-in anchor for CTV Newsnet.

City TV

Haines was hired by Citytv Toronto as a health reporter with &quot;CityNews&quot;. In fall 2001, she began hosting &quot;Health on the Line&quot;, which aired on Life Network and Discovery Health for five seasons.

On 15 September 2010, Haines returned to Citytv as a senior reporter and anchor. Beginning on 26 January 2012, Haines wrote and hosted the award-winning &quot;Inside Story&quot; on Citytv.

In 2016, Haines began to produce and shoot her own documentaries. Whilst volunteering on a medical humanitarian mission to post-Ebola Liberia, she produced a documentary highlighting the plight of chimpanzees that were abandoned following years of experimentation by a U.S. research laboratory. Haines also interviewed the former Warlord Charles G. Taylor&#x27;s wife and current vice-president of Liberia, Jewel Howard Taylor producing a documentary called &quot;My Penpal: The Warlord&#x27;s Wife&quot;. The following year, during the final offensive against the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIS) in West Mosul, Haines was embedded with the Iraqi Special Forces in an abandoned mosque that had previously served as an ISIS headquarters. Both documentaries were nominated for &quot;RTDNA awards&quot;, and, &#x27;Two Kilometres to Terror: Life and Death Under ISIS,&#x27; was awarded the &#x27;2018 RTDNA Dave Rogers Award for Long Feature (Large Market)&#x27;.&#x27;&#x27;

On 12 October 2017, during the 5pm newscast, &quot;CityNews&quot; Haines announced she would be leaving the organization.

CTV W5

On 12 October 2017, CTV announced on social media that Haines had accepted a job as a co-host and correspondent on its news magazine, &quot;W5&quot;. Since joining &quot;W5&quot;, Haines has won and been nominated for numerous awards for her national and international long-format investigative documentaries.

In 2019, W5 was awarded the RTDNA Dan McArthur Award for Investigative Journalism for her one-hour documentary, &quot;W5: No Witnesses&quot;,
an exposé of a global sex abuse cover-up within the Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses sect. In 2019, she was also awarded the &quot;Innocence Canada Tracey Tyler Award for Justice for the Wrongly Convicted&quot; for &quot;W5: An Indigenous man&#x27;s quest to clear his name&quot;.

In 2020, Haines won a Canadian Screen Award for &quot;Best Host or Interviewer, News or Information&quot; for the &quot;W5&quot; investigation &quot;The Narco Riviera&quot;. The academy described the documentary as &quot;A powerful investigation into drug cartel violence in Mexico and the risk posed to tourists, including Canadians, who travel south seeking sun and sand but may find their lives at risk. The documentary includes an exclusive, chilling interview with a cartel leader – a risky and difficult to organize a journalistic coup. Following the broadcast Mexican authorities stepped up their investigations, eventually arresting drug cartel members in the &#x27;Narco Riviera&#x27;&quot;. Haines was also awarded the 2020 Canadian Screen Award for &quot;Best News or Information Program&quot; for &quot;W5: The Baby in the Snow&quot;. This &quot;W5&quot; investigation into who left 11-month-old Dusty Bowers to die in the snow forced the Ontario Provincial Police to reopen this 30-year-old cold case.

In 2021, Haines was awarded the Canadian Screen Award for &quot;Best News or Information Program&quot; for the &quot;W5&quot; investigation &quot;The Invisible Man&quot;. This W5 documentary investigates romance fraud, finding victims who have been scammed out of their life&#x27;s savings but also tracks the schemes to a vast international cartel of criminals, stretching to a secretive Nigerian fraud ring.

In 2022, Haines won the Canadian Screen Award for &quot;Best News or Information Program&quot; for the &quot;W5&quot; investigation: A Town Divided. The documentary investigated a preacher who made headlines for defying public health laws during the COVID-19 pandemic, sending shockwaves through a small Ontario town. Pastor Henry Hildebrandt from the Christian Fundamentalist Church of God emerged as a hero to the anti-lockdown crowd, preaching against the government, police, and the medical community over public health restrictions. The W5 investigation uncovered former members who expose his church as a child-abusing cult with a prophecy about the looming apocalypse.

==Awards==
In 2002 and 2005, Haines&#x27; television programme &#x27;Health on the Line&#x27; won Gemini Awards for Best Talk Series. In 2005, she was personally nominated for a Gemini in a hosting/interviewer category.

In 2013, Haines&#x27; Inside Story was awarded the Media Award by the Tema Conter Memorial Trust, &#x27;Best In-depth Television Reporting&#x27; by The Radio Television Digital News Association (RTDNA) and the Canadian Medical Association Media Award a Special Mention &#x27;Excellence in Health Reporting for the Inside Story: &#x27;Dystonia&#x27;.

In 2014, the Inside Story was nominated for three Canadian Screen Awards including Best Local Reportage and Best News Information Segment.

In 2015, she received a Canadian Screen Awards nomination for Best Local Reportage for &#x27;When the Blue Line Flatlines&#x27;.

In 2018, Haines was nominated for two RTDNAs for documentaries shot by herself in Liberia and Iraq: &#x27;My Penpal: The Warlord&#x27;s Wife&#x27; and &#x27;Two Kilometres to Terror: Life and Death Under ISIS&#x27;. The latter documentary, filmed by Haines when she was embedded with the Iraqi Special Forces in West Mosul, went on to be awarded the RTDNA Dave Rogers Award for Long Feature (Large Market).

In 2019, Haines won the RTDNA Dan MCArthur Award for &#x27;Investigative Journalism&#x27; for &quot;W5: No Witnesses&quot;, and the &quot;Innocence Canada Tracey Tyler Award for Justice for the Wrongly Convicted&quot; for &quot;W5: An Indigenous man&#x27;s quest to clear his name&quot;.

In 2020, Haines won the Canadian Screen Awards for &#x27;Best Host or Interviewer, News or Information&#x27; for &quot;W5: The Narco Riviera&quot; and &#x27;Best News or Information Program&#x27; for &quot;W5: the Baby in the Snow&quot;.

In 2021,Haines was awarded the Canadian Screen Awards for &#x27;Best News or Information Program&#x27; for the &quot;W5&quot; investigation &quot;The Invisible Man&quot;.

In 2022, Haines won the Canadian Screen Awards for &#x27;Best Host or Interviewer, News or Information&#x27; for her work on the W5 documentary &quot;A Town Divided.&quot;

In 2023, Haines won the Canadian Screen Awards for &#x27;Best Host or Interviewer, News or Information&#x27;.&quot;

==Personal life==

Haines is the sister of Emily Haines, lead singer of the band Metric. Both Avery and Emily are daughters of Paul Haines, poet and librettist of &quot;Escalator over the Hill&quot;, which was co-written with Carla Bley.

Haines came out as being in a same-sex relationship following the 2016 Orlando nightclub shooting, which occurred eight weeks and one day after she married her partner, Mel.

==Controversy==

On 15 January 2000, Haines made a mistake with a line while taping a report introduction. After regaining her composure, she made a joke but the camera was still on. Haines retaped the segment, but later that day, a CTV technician mistakenly aired the tape that included the error and the comment. &quot;I kind of like the stuttering thing. It&#x27;s like equal opportunity right? We&#x27;ve got a stuttering newscaster. We&#x27;ve got the black, we&#x27;ve got the Asian, we&#x27;ve got the woman. I could be a lesbian-folk-dancing-black-woman stutterer. In a wheelchair ... with a gimping, rubber leg. Yeah, really. I&#x27;d have a successful career, let me tell you.&quot; On 17 January, Haines was fired from CTV Newsnet after her comments sparked controversy.

<doc id="923386" wikidata="Q2483178" url="?curid=923386" title="John Murray, 11th Duke of Atholl">
<text>John Murray, 11th Duke of Atholl (19 January 1929 – 15 May 2012), was a South African-born hereditary peer of the Peerage of Scotland, hereditary Clan Chief of Clan Murray, and Colonel-in-Chief of the Atholl Highlanders. As Duke of Atholl, he commanded the only legal private army in Europe. He acceded as the 11th duke on 27 February 1996, succeeding his second cousin, once removed, The 10th Duke of Atholl.

==Early life==
The Duke was born in Johannesburg, South Africa, as the only child of Major George Murray and his wife Joan Eastwood, a daughter of William Edward Eastwood. His father was killed on active service in the Second World War.

He was the paternal grandson of the Rev. Douglas Stuart Murray, Rector of Blithfield, Staffordshire, and his wife Harriet Georgina Isabel Bridgeman. Douglas Stuart Murray was a grandson of the Rt. Rev. George Murray, Bishop of Rochester, who himself was a grandson of John Murray, 3rd Duke of Atholl.

The young Murray was educated at Michaelhouse from 1941 to 1946, in what was then the midlands of Natal, and gained an appreciation for cricket and the outdoors. From there, he proceeded to the University of the Witwatersrand, from which he graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in engineering.

==Life==
After taking his degree, Murray worked as a land surveyor.
On 15 December 1956 in Pretoria, he married Margaret &quot;Peggy&quot; Yvonne Leach , the only daughter of Ronald Leonard Leach of Louis Trichardt, Transvaal, South Africa and wife Faith Kleinenberg.

They had three children: 
* Lady Jennifer Murray (born 8 February 1958), who has married and has children
* Bruce Murray, now 12th Duke of Atholl (born 6 April 1960), who has married and has children
* Lord Craig John Murray (born 1963), who has married and has children

In 1996, on the death of his kinsman, a second cousin, once removed, Iain Murray, 10th Duke of Atholl, Murray succeeded as 11th Duke at the age of 67. However, the day before the death of the 10th Duke, it was announced that he had given his ancestral seat of Blair Castle and most of his estates to a charitable trust, thus shielding the estate from a crippling 40% United Kingdom inheritance tax rate. The Daily Telegraph reported the 10th Duke had been unimpressed when his heir had indicated that he had no desire to leave South Africa for Scotland.

Atholl continued to live in South Africa, while making annual visits to Scotland. He died on 15 May 2012 in a South African hospital at the age of 83. He was succeeded in his titles by his elder son, Bruce Murray, Marquess of Tullibardine.

As Duke of Atholl, he commanded the only legal private army in Europe, the Atholl Highlanders. The army is based at Blair Castle, the ancestral home of the dukes of Atholl. The Duke did not inherit Blair Castle, which passed to a charitable trust. However, every year the Duke visited from South Africa to stay at Blair for the traditional display put on by his army.

The Duke was also the hereditary Clan Chief of Clan Murray.

==Wife&#x27;s Ancestry==
Margaret was the paternal granddaughter of Charles Ronald Leach and first wife Louise Adelaide Zeederberg and maternal granddaughter of Johannes Petrus Stephanus Kleinenberg and wife Letitia Pittendrigh Cooksley.

Charles Ronald Leach was son of Charles William Leach and first wife Agnes Mary Bell paternal grandson of John Leach and wife Sara Ann Hinds and maternal grandson of William Bell and wife Mary Ann Mason.

Louise Adelaide Zeederberg was daughter of Hans Jacobus Zeederberg, storekeeper in Pretoria in 1878, and wife Jessie Gray, paternal granddaughter of Petrus Hans Zeederberg and wife Sophia Margrita Ruisch, and maternal granddaughter of John Gray and wife Ann Young.

Johannes Petrus Stephanus Kleinenberg was son of Bauke Theunis Kleinenberg, who emigrated in 1852 to South Africa, teacher and lecturer in Piketberg and Calvinia, married firstly in Piketberg, Cape Colony, on 10 April 1854 Maria Susanna Theron, and second wife Maria Magdalena Margaretha Coetzee, paternal grandson of Teunis Kleinenberg, farmer and wife Gebke Kerkhof and maternal grandson of Dirk Johannes Coetzee and wife Johanna Sophia Boonzaaier.

Letitia Pittendrigh Cooksley was daughter of John Skinner Cooksley, a trader in South Africa, in Port Elizabeth in 1862, and wife Mary Pittindrigh.

<doc id="923389" wikidata="Q779901" url="?curid=923389" title="13 Ways to Bleed on Stage">
<text>13 Ways to Bleed on Stage is the second studio album by American rock band Cold, released on September 12, 2000. With four popular singles, it gained substantial commercial success, achieving gold status, and landed Cold in the mainstream rock scene.

==Background and recording==
About a year prior to recording &quot;13 Ways&quot;, the band enlisted guitarist Terry Balsamo; frontman Scooter Ward, who had sung and played guitar, wanted to focus solely on singing. After trying a few musicians from Los Angeles, Cold chose fellow Jacksonville native Balsamo, who&#x27;d played with its members since the age of 18.

The main song structures for &quot;13 Ways&quot; were written prior to entering the studio. Using C tuning (the main tuning used in Cold&#x27;s catalog), the band then experimented with various sounds and dynamics in the studio. Balsamo primarily used an Ibanez RG570 and Mesa Boogie Triple Rectifier.

It is often considered as Cold&#x27;s darkest record. The album has a Parental advisory on the cover art for strong language and dark graphic themes such as drug addiction and its consequences, relationship troubles, and social indifference. Guest vocalists include Aaron Lewis of Staind and Sierra Swan who would also appear on the band&#x27;s next album.

==Album art==
Cold&#x27;s second album marked the first appearance of the band&#x27;s spider logo and corresponding text. Its CD booklet design depicts a tattered old book held shut with rubber bands. The liner notes feature morbid figure illustrations and imagery of X-Acto knives and other cutting utensils.

==Touring and promotion==
Following the album&#x27;s release, Cold toured for a year and a half to promote it. They embarked on a three-week tour with 3 Doors Down and a month with Marilyn Manson before joining Limp Bizkit and DMX on the Anger Management Tour for a few weeks. Cold (along with the Offspring, Weezer, Social Distortion, Incubus and Adema) was on the bill for the first annual Inland Invasion, which took place on August 25, 2001, and was hosted by the Los Angeles radio station KROQ.

Singles for the album included &quot;Just Got Wicked&quot;, &quot;End of the World&quot;, &quot;No One&quot; and &quot;Bleed&quot;. All of the said tracks had music videos which saw moderate airplay on MTV2. The majority of singles from &quot;13 Ways&quot; also received significant radio play and were instrumental in launching Cold into the mainstream music scene.

&quot;Just Got Wicked&quot; appears on &quot;MTV: The Return of the Rock, Vol. 2&quot;, &quot;ECW: Extreme Music Vol. 2: Anarchy Rocks&quot;, and the soundtrack to the video game &quot;Jet Grind Radio&quot;. &quot;No One&quot; is featured on the soundtrack to the film &quot;A Walk to Remember&quot;.

== Commercial performance ==
The album debuted at #174 on the Billboard 200, selling 6,251 copies in its first week. It later peaked at #98, staying on the chart for 27 weeks. Five months after its release, it had sold 81,046 copies according to Nielsen Soundscan.

In February 2002, the album was certified gold by the RIAA for shipments of over 500,000 copies.

As of 2003, the album has sold 467,000 copies in the US.

<text>Thomas Vernon McGarity II (December 1, 1921 – May 21, 2013) was a United States Army soldier and a recipient of the United States Military&#x27;s highest decoration, the Medal of Honor, for his actions during the Battle of the Bulge in World War II.

==Biography==
Born in Hardin County, Tennessee on December 1, 1921, McGarity joined the army in November 1942.

By December 16, 1944, the first day of the Battle of the Bulge, he was serving near Krinkelt, Belgium as a technical sergeant in Company L of the 393rd Infantry Regiment, 99th Infantry Division. Wounded early in the battle, McGarity returned to his unit, and as squad leader, directed and encouraged his soldiers throughout the intense fight that ensued. He repeatedly braved heavy fire to rescue wounded men, attacked the advancing Germans, and retrieved supplies. Medics attempted to have McGarity evacuated after he was severely wounded on his face and legs, but he refused. After completely running out of ammunition, his squad and he were captured. For his actions during the battle, he was presented with the Medal of Honor a year later, on January 11, 1946, by President Harry S Truman. He left active service in 1947 to join the Tennessee Army National Guard, retiring as a Lieutenant Colonel in 1974.

McGarity died at the age of 91 in 2013.

<text>The Improv is a comedy club franchise. It was founded as a single venue in the Hell&#x27;s Kitchen neighborhood of New York City in 1963, and expanded into a chain of venues in the late 1970s.

==History==
Originally, it was a 50-seat single venue (which immediately prior, housed a Vietnamese restaurant) founded on 20 April 1963, by Budd Friedman and his future wife, Silver (née Schreck) Saundors, and located at 358 West 44th Street, at Ninth Avenue, in the Hell&#x27;s Kitchen neighborhood of New York City near the southeast corner of 9th Ave. The Improvisation was originally an after hours coffee house where Broadway performers could unwind after shows with an open mic inviting impromptu musical performances. In 1964, Dave Astor was its first comedian. Gradually comedians would use it as a venue to try out new material and talent scouts from &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot; and other New York-based television shows began frequenting the venue looking for new acts to book. After several years of alternating acts between singers and comics, by the 1970s it was a stand-up comedy venue. A second location was opened in 1974 at 8162 Melrose Avenue in the Fairfax District of Los Angeles, California (which immediately prior housed the Ash Grove, a folk music venue). In 1979, Mark Lonow became a general partner and with Budd Friedman ran the Melrose club and oversaw the expansion of the single room as it became a successful chain. When the Friedmans divorced in 1981, the divorce settlement gave Budd Friedman ownership of the LA Improvs and Silver Friedman was given ownership of the New York Improv. The original New York Improv closed in 1992.

In 1982, the L.A. Improv became the original site for the A&amp;E Network television series &quot;An Evening at the Improv&quot;, running from 1982 until 1996, and was produced by Larry O&#x27;Daly, created by O&#x27;Daly and Barbara Hosie-O&#x27;Daly, with Budd Friedman as a warm-up host. Other locations have opened since then, such as in Tampa, Florida, Fort Lauderdale, Florida, Atlantic City, New Jersey, and Louisville, Kentucky. In 2014, Friedman sold the Improv chain to Levity Entertainment Group, now known as Levity Live.

==Performances==
The Improv was the place to see Richard Pryor, Robert Klein, Steve Landesberg, Bette Midler, Lily Tomlin, Jay Leno, and others when they were just starting out. Dustin Hoffman played piano there. On any given night in the later 1970s, one could see Gilbert Gottfried, Joe Piscopo, Bruce Mahler, Robin Williams, Larry David, and many others. Often famous comedians would walk in to &quot;work out&quot; before appearances on &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;. It was not unusual to find celebrities in the audience.

Nearly every big name in comedy has played The Improv, including Richard Belzer, Milton Berle, Kevin Brennan, Drew Carey, George Carlin, Andrew Dice Clay, Bill Cosby, Billy Crystal, Rodney Dangerfield, Jeff Dunham, Bill Engvall, Dave Foley, Jeff Foxworthy, Bill Hicks, Andy Kaufman, Carol Leifer, David Letterman, Richard Lewis, Jon Lovett, Norm Macdonald, Bill Maher, Marc Maron, Steve Martin, Dennis Miller, Larry Miller, Liza Minnelli, Freddie Prinze, Ray Romano, Paul Reiser, Joan Rivers, Joe Rogan, Jerry Seinfeld, Bo Burnham and Ron White. Jeremy Ruder at 18, and Jim Carrey at 19.

Silver Friedman auditioned and rejected Eddie Murphy, a regular at The Comic Strip in New York City, for being &quot;too vulgar&quot;, and he eventually performed at the Improv in Los Angeles when he was only 15 years old. 

Karen Black, Debra Winger and Barry Manilow, among others, worked there as waiters, waitresses, hosts or musicians before becoming famous.

New and upcoming performers have performed there as well. Comedy Central&#x27;s Dave Attell frequents Improv locations in Tampa and Hollywood. Comics Lewis Black, Mike Birbiglia, Louis C.K. and Jimmy Fallon have performed at the Improv in Louisville, Kentucky.

<text>De Dannan (originally &quot;Dé Danann&quot;) is an Irish folk music group. It was formed in 1975 by Frankie Gavin (fiddle), Alec Finn (guitar, bouzouki), Johnny &quot;Ringo&quot; McDonagh (bodhrán) and Charlie Piggott (banjo) as a result of sessions in Hughes&#x27;s Pub in Spiddal, County Galway, Ireland, with Dolores Keane (vocals) subsequently being invited to join the band. The fiddler Mickey Finn (1951–1987) is also acknowledged to have been a founding member.

The band was named after the legendary Irish tribe Tuatha Dé Danann. In 1985 the spelling of the name was changed from &quot;Dé Danann&quot; to &quot;De Dannan&quot; for reasons that have never been made clear. Since 2010, however, Finn and McDonagh have recorded and performed with a line-up named &quot;De Danann&quot;, and, since 2012, Gavin has recorded and performed with another line-up named &quot;De Dannan&quot;.

==History==

The group&#x27;s debut album was &quot;Dé Danann&quot;, produced by Dónal Lunny and recorded at Eamonn Andrews Studios, Dublin, in 1975 and released on Polydor Records. In early 1976, Keane left to marry multi-instrumentalist John Faulkner, with whom she subsequently recorded three albums of folk music.

To fill the vacancy left after Keane&#x27;s departure, Dé Danann brought in Andy Irvine. Irvine never recorded on any full De Danann album but he can be heard on three tracks recorded with the band on 30 April 1976, during a folk festival in Germany. Irvine left soon thereafter because of scheduling conflicts but proposed as his replacement Johnny Moynihan, who participated in the recording of the band&#x27;s second album, &quot;Selected Jigs Reels &amp; Songs&quot;. This album featured a bodhrán solo by McDonagh on &quot;Over The Bog Road&quot; but the album has never been released on CD, reportedly because the master tapes were lost.

Moynihan left in 1978, being replaced by singer and accordion player Tim Lyons; for a short period in 1978, the band toured as a six-piece featuring both Moynihan and Lyons.

Their third album, &quot;The Mist Covered Mountain&quot;, was released in 1980 and featured various older traditional singers. That year, the group had a surprise hit single in Ireland with their instrumental cover of the Beatles&#x27; song &quot;Hey Jude&quot;, later re-released on their fourth album, &quot;Star-Spangled Molly&quot; in 1981; on this album, they were joined by Maura O&#x27;Connell.

As an indication of their diversity, they also recorded Handel&#x27;s &quot;Arrival of the Queen of Sheba&quot;, which they jokingly retitled &quot;The Arrival of the Queen of Sheba (in Galway)&quot;, on their 1983 album &quot;Song for Ireland&quot;. Later, they would also record Bohemian Rhapsody and Jewish klezmer tunes, learned from bluegrass and klezmer musician, Andy Statman.

When O&#x27;Connell left the band, they brought in Mary Black for two albums: &quot;Song for Ireland&quot; and &quot;Anthem&quot;. Like O&#x27;Connell and Keane before her, Black subsequently went on to explore country, blues and jazz, hopping backwards and forwards between Nashville and Dublin.

After Black&#x27;s departure, Keane returned to the fold for two albums: &quot;Anthem&quot; and &quot;Ballroom&quot;. Other singers with the group have included Eleanor Shanley (1988–1992), Tommy Fleming (1994–1997) and Andrew Murray (1997–2000).

On the instrumental side, Frankie Gavin and Alec Finn were the only constant members of the group. Jackie Daly (accordion) is a star in his own right and later went on to join the group Patrick Street. He was replaced on accordion in 1983 by Martin O&#x27;Connor until 1987, Aidan Coffey until 1995, and Derek Hickey until 2001. The fiddle-accordion-bouzouki combination became synonymous with the inspirational De Dannan instrumental sound. In 1988 Colm Murphy replaced Johnny McDonagh playing the bodhrán.

The band members went their separate ways in 2003, at which point the name De Dannan was copyrighted by Alec Finn. This led to a high-profile dispute with Frankie Gavin in 2009 when the latter used the name for his pre-existing Hibernian Rhapsody band.

In 2008 the original band (Johnny &quot;Ringo&quot; McDonagh, Charlie Piggott, Dolores Keane, Frankie Gavin and Alec Finn) were commemorated on an Irish 55c postage stamp. Attending the formal issue event, Piggott said, &quot;Having contributed to the promotion of Traditional Irish Music and as a keen philatelist, I consider it both an honour and a privilege to be celebrated on an Irish stamp.&quot;

In 2010 De Danann recorded &quot;Wonderwaltz&quot;, an album with a line-up of Finn (guitar, bouzouki, tenor guitar, mandola, mouth organ), McDonagh (bodhrán, bones), Eleanor Shanley (vocals), Brian McGrath (banjo, piano, tenor guitar, mandola), Derek Hickey (accordion) and Mick Conneely (fiddle, viola, whistle), with guest musicians Cian Finn (backing vocals) and Trevor Hutchinson (double bass).

<text>Daniel Mannix Petrie (November 26, 1920 – August 22, 2004) was a Canadian film, television, and stage director who worked in Canada, Hollywood, and the United Kingdom; known for directing grounded human dramas often dealing with taboo subject matter. He was one of several Canadian-born expatriate filmmakers, including Norman Jewison and Sidney J. Furie, to find critical and commercial success overseas in the 1960s due to the limited opportunities in the Canadian film industry at the time. He was the patriarch of the Petrie filmmaking family, with four of his children all working in the film industry.

Beginning his career in television, he made his critical and popular breakthrough directing the 1961 film version of the Lorraine Hansberry play &quot;A Raisin in the Sun&quot;, which won the Gary Cooper Award at the Cannes Film Festival. He directed over 90 films and television programs until his retirement in 2001, winning several accolades (including three Primetime Emmy Awards) in the process. His semi-autobiographical 1984 film &quot;The Bay Boy&quot; won the Genie Award for Best Motion Picture.

Throughout his life, Petrie maintained strong ties to the academic world, serving as the deputy chairman of the American Film Institute from 1986 to 1987.

==Early life and education==
Petrie was born in Glace Bay, Nova Scotia, Canada, the son of Mary Anne (née Campbell) and William Mark Petrie, a soft-drink manufacturer. He achieved a Bachelor of Arts in Communications at St. Francis Xavier University before completing a Masters in adult education at Columbia University. Petrie also served in the Canadian Army during World War II.

He moved to the United States in 1945, and began his career teaching at Northwestern University and Creighton University, where he was head of the theatre department until 1950. Although Petrie stopped teaching, he maintained a strong relationship with the academic world throughout his career, holding a faculty position at the American Film Institute, where he also acted as deputy chairman from 1986 to 1987.

==Career==
Petrie started working as a television director in 1950. His signature film &quot;A Raisin in the Sun&quot; (1961) was assigned to him after it was refused to its original director on Broadway, future National Medal of Arts honoree Lloyd Richards, because Richards was black. The movie maintained the award-winning cast and performances it had had on Broadway during its two-year successful run under Richards&#x27; direction, and the film version was nominated for the Palme d&#x27;Or award at the Cannes Film Festival. Petrie went on to have a fulfilling movie directing career because of the success of this movie; Richards did not get an opportunity to direct a movie again until 1995.

Petrie directed &quot;Buster and Billie&quot; (1974); the Academy Award-nominated &quot;Resurrection&quot; (1980); &quot;Fort Apache, The Bronx&quot; (1981); and &quot;&quot; (1988).

Petrie also directed television movies, such as &quot;Sybil&quot;, &quot;Eleanor and Franklin&quot;, &quot;Eleanor and Franklin: The White House Years&quot;, &quot;The Dollmaker&quot;, &quot;My Name Is Bill W.&quot;, &quot;Mark Twain and Me&quot;, &quot;Kissinger and Nixon&quot;, &quot;Inherit the Wind&quot;, and &quot;Wild Iris&quot;.

Petrie&#x27;s theatrical films were rarely box-office successes, but they often featured large, well-known casts, such as &quot;The Betsy&quot; (1978), starring Laurence Olivier, Tommy Lee Jones and Robert Duvall. His films feature the earliest starring screen appearances by such stars as Winona Ryder (&quot;Square Dance&quot; - she first appeared in a supporting role in &quot;Lucas&quot;) and Kiefer Sutherland (&quot;The Bay Boy&quot;). As a television director he won multiple Emmy and Directors Guild of America Awards.

==Death==
Petrie died of cancer in 2004 in Los Angeles, California, at the age of 83.

==The Petrie family==
Petrie was married for 57 years to Dorothea Grundy Petrie, an Emmy-winning film and television producer. Their sons were Daniel and Donald, both successful directors and screenwriters. Their twin daughters were former MGM executive June and actor/writer Mary. In 2002, the family as a whole was awarded the American Film Institute&#x27;s &quot;Platinum Circle Award&quot; to recognise their collective creative contributions.

<doc id="923402" wikidata="Q271639" url="?curid=923402" title="Bois de Vincennes">
<text>The Bois de Vincennes (), located on the eastern edge of Paris, France, is the largest public park in the city. It was created between 1855 and 1866 by Emperor Napoleon III.

The park is next to the Château de Vincennes, a former residence of the Kings of France. It contains an English landscape garden with four lakes; a zoo; an arboretum; a botanical garden; a hippodrome or horse-racing track; a velodrome for bicycle races; and the campus of the French national institute of sports and physical education. The park is known for prostitution after dark.

==Dimensions==
The Bois de Vincennes has a total area of 995 hectares (2,459 acres), making it slightly larger than the Bois de Boulogne, (846 hectares / 2,091 acres), the other great Parisian landscape park located at the western side of the city. It occupies ten percent of the total area of Paris, and is almost as large as the first six arrondissements in the center of the city combined. The Bois de Vincennes is about three times larger than Central Park in New York City (341 hectares / 843 acres), and is slightly larger than Richmond Park in London (955 hectares / 2,360 acres); but is smaller than Griffith Park in Los Angeles (1,170 hectares / 2891 acres). Only about half of the Bois de Vincennes is covered with trees.

==A royal hunting preserve==
The bois de Vincennes was part of the ancient forest that surrounded the ancient Roman town of Lutetia; at that time it was called &quot;Vilcena&quot;, the origin of the present name. In about 1150 King Louis VII (11371180) built a hunting lodge at the site of the present chateau. King Philippe-Auguste (11801223) enclosed the forest with a wall, stocked it with game, and began building a castle. King Louis IX, or Saint Louis (12261270) built a chapel next to the castle to house an important religious relic, which he believed to be the crown of thorns from the Crucifixion of Jesus. He was also famous for holding a royal court of justice under an oak near the chateau.

In 1336 King Philip VI of France (12931350) began construction of the imposing donjon of the Château de Vincennes. The work was continued by his successor, Jean II of France (13191364), and finished by Charles V of France (13381380), who surrounded the donjon with a rectangular wall flanked by nine towers. He also began to rebuild the chapel founded by Saint Louis. The new chapel was called La-Sainte Chapelle, modeled after the Saint-Chapelle in the Palais de la Cité in Paris. It was not finished until the 16th century. A hunting party in the forest is shown as the December scene in the &quot;Très Riches Heures du Duc de Berry&quot; (1412–1416), with the towers of the chateau visible in the background. The forest was also the home of a community of monks of the order of the Minimes; their presence is remembered by the name of the Lac des Minimes within the park.

In 1654 Cardinal Mazarin commissioned the royal architect Louis Le Vau to build a new palace for King Louis XIV next to the chateau. The new palace featured a pavilion for the King and another for the Queen, separated by a portico and by a wall connected by arcades to the medieval section of the chateau. The donjon had been transformed into prison in the 15th century. The palace was popular with the King for a time, but once Louis XIV established his residence at Versailles, the château of Vincennes was rarely used.

In the 18th century Louis XV (17101774) opened the park to the public, excepting servants in livery. He had hundreds of trees planted and laid out long straight alleys through the forest in the form of intersecting stars. In 1731 he constructed a pyramid-shaped monument to mark the meeting point of the two main alleys, which can still be seen.
==The creation of the park==
Beginning in 1794, large parts of the Bois de Vincennes were turned into a military training ground. Some of the structures of the old chateau were demolished, and a firing range was built. In 184043, a new fort was constructed in the park east of the chateau, and a 166 hectare section of the park was cleared and used for military parades and exercises.

In 1854 the Emperor Louis Napoleon, and his new Prefect of the Seine, Georges-Eugène Haussmann, decided to transform the Bois de Vincennes into a public park. Haussmann had three major projects for Paris; to improve the traffic circulation of the city, for both practical and military reasons; to build a new system to distribute water and take away sewage; and to create a network of parks and gardens all over the city. The purpose of the park was to provide green space and recreation to the large working-class population of eastern Paris, similar to the Bois de Boulogne, which Louis Napoleon had begun building in 1852 for the more affluent population of the west side of Paris.

To build the parks, in 1855 Haussmann created a new Service of Promenades and Plantations, led by an engineer, Jean-Charles Adolphe Alphand, who was already at work on the Bois de Boulogne. Alphand was a master organizer, the builder of the most famous Paris parks of the 19th century; besides the Bois de Boulogne and Bois de Vincennes, he built the gardens of the Champs-Élysées, the boulevard of the Paris Observatory, Parc Monceau and the Parc des Buttes Chaumont.

Alphand stated his philosophy of gardens very clearly in his memoir &quot;Les Promenades de Paris&quot;: &quot;When we say that a garden should preserve a natural appearance, we don&#x27;t mean that it should be an exact copy of the nature which is around us. A garden is a work of art.&quot; While nature and the site gave the general lines, the art consisted of the &quot;combinations of forms, colors, and light.&quot; Alphand carefully composed his picturesque landscapes out of lawns, groves of trees, flower beds, streams and lakes, visited by taking winding paths.

Alphand&#x27;s task was made much more difficult by the nature of the site. In the center of the park was an enormous military training field, completely cleared of trees. Around the base were firing ranges, a factory for making ammunition, and several forts and redoubts, which occupied large tracts of land. Even after the park was created, the Army continued to build; A new military shooting range was opened in 1860, and a school of pyrotechnics was built in 1864.

Alphand solved the problem by annexing addition sections of land at the edges of the park, and by creating three smaller parks around the Bois, each with its own artificial lake and picturesque landscape. Lake Daumesnil, designed like a romantic landscape painting, had two islands, and sloping green lawns. The Lac des Minimes to the north included some of the ruins of the original medieval monastery that once stood there; and the Lac de Saint-Mandė in the northwest completed the park. A fourth lake, the Lac de Gravelle in the south-east, was higher in elevation than the others, on the Plateau de Gravelle, and therefore provided water to the other lakes through artificial streams. Trees, lawns and flower beds were planted by Jean-Pierre Barillet-Deschamps, the chief horticulturist of the city, who had landscaped the Bois de Boulogne.

Alphand saw that the park had popular attractions and concessions to attract visitors and to help pay for the park. A large hippodrome, or horse-racing track, was built in the southeastern corner of the park, similar to the Longchamps hippodrome at the Bois de Boulogne. There were cafe-restaurants at the different lakes. The park was also decorated with picturesque architecture, mostly designed by Gabriel Davioud, the city architect. His works included the grandstands of the hippodrome and the Temple of Love, a round doric temple which was placed on a promontory on the Isle de Reuilly in Lac Daumesnil, above an artificial grotto. On the same island was a Swiss chalet (taken from the Paris Universal Exposition of 1867), a cafe, a bandstand, and buildings for vendors and game concessions. A swinging suspension bridge connected the two islands in the lake.
==The park in the 19th and 20th century==
In 1899, an experimental tropical garden had been established in the far eastern end of the park, where rubber trees, coffee trees, banana trees and other tropical plants were scientifically studied. In 1907, this garden became the site of the first Colonial Exposition held in Paris, designed to showcase the cultures and products of the French colonies. The exposition featured six villages, complete with inhabitants, from the different parts of the French Empire; an emcampment of Tuaregs from North Africa; a farm from Sudan; a village of Kanaks from New Caledonia; and villages from Madagascar, French Indochina, and the Congo. The Exposition was seen by two million visitors.

At the 1900 Summer Olympics in Paris, most of events took place in the Bois de Vincennes. The Velodrome, which seats forty thousand spectators, was built for the cycling events. The park hosted the first international cricket match between England and France; England unsurprisingly won.

During the First World War, the Dutch spy Mata Hari was imprisoned in the fortress of Vincennes and executed by firing squad in the moat of the fortress on 15 October 1917. Eyewitnesses reported that her hands were not bound, and that she refused a blindfold. According to the legend (not documented), she is said to have blown a kiss at the firing squad, and to have said, &quot;What a strange custom you French have, to shoot people at dawn.&quot;

In 1929, the Bois de Vincennes was officially annexed to the city of Paris and included in the city&#x27;s 12th arrondissement, similar to the Bois de Boulogne which was attached to its 16th arrondissement.

===The 1931 Paris Colonial Exposition===
For six months in 1931, the Paris Colonial Exposition took place in the Bois de Vincennes. Like the earlier 1907 exposition, It was designed to showcase the culture, products and resources of the French empire, but it was much larger. It occupied the side of the park along the length of the Avenue Daumesnil. The features of the exhibit included the Palace of the Colonies. In front of the palace was a large gilded bronze statue by Leon Drivier entitled &quot;France bringing peace and prosperity to the colonies&quot;. It had pavilions from each colony and from other nations, cafes and theaters, a Senegalese village complete with inhabitants, and a zoo.

The exposition featured eight spectacular fountains, fed with water from Lake Daumesnil. The Grand Signal was a centerpiece of the exposition, a tower forty-five meters high, which spouted water from the top and from jets at nineteen different levels. Two other fountains created a bridge of water forty meters long between the two islands in the lake. A third fountain, called the Theater of Water, was an arc of towers and spouts eighty meters long, which in evening performances produced cascades, jets and curtains of water colored with electric lights. These were early ancestors of today&#x27;s musical fountains in Dubai and Las Vegas.

Several vestiges of the fair can still be seen. The entrance gate is still standing. After the Fair closed, the Palace of the Colonies became the Museum of the Arts of Africa and the Oceania. In 1934 the zoo was moved to its present location, and embellished with a sixty-five meter high artificial mountain, which became the home of a collection of mountain goats and sheep. The pavilion of Cameroon was preserved and turned into a Buddhist temple and religious center.
During the Battle of France in 1940, the Chateau was the headquarters of the French General Staff. It was heavily damaged and not fully restored until the 1990s. At the end of World War II in 1945, the French army began to move out of the Bois de Vincennes.

==Features of the Bois de Vincennes==
===Lakes===
The Bois de Vincennes is home to four artificial lakes. The water for the lakes was originally pumped from the Marne River, but today comes from a pumping station near the Pont d&#x27;Austerlitz on the Seine.

* Lac Daumesnil (12 hectares), is located in the western end of the park, and has two islands. Its attractions include the Temple d&#x27;Amour and the Swiss Chalet on the Isle de Reuilly, and an artificial grotto. 
* Lac des Minimes (6 hectares), in the north-east, has three small islands. Its length is 500 meters and its width is 200 meters. Its attractions include the vestiges of a medieval monastery. 
* Lac de Saint-Mandé, in the northwest. 
* Lac de Gravelle (1 hectare), in the south-east, is the smallest lake in the park. At a higher elevation than the other lakes, it provides water to the other lakes through an artificial stream. 
===Gardens===
*The Parc floral de Paris, or Paris floral park, was established in 1969 on the former military training grounds in the park. It occupies 31 hectares, and is the largest garden built in Paris since the French Empire of Louis Napoleon. It is one of the four parts of the Botanical Garden of Paris, the others being the gardens of the Château de Bagatelle in the Bois de Boulogne; the Jardin des Serres d&#x27;Auteuil or greenhouses of Auteuil, and the Arboretum de l&#x27;École du Breuil, located in another part of Bois de Vincennes. The Japanese architecture within the garden was inspired by the 1964 Tokyo Olympics. The garden features hundreds of varieties of flowers, including 650 varieties of iris; twenty-pavilions and an exhibit hall; a sculpture garden with works of Alexander Calder, Alberto Giacometti and other international artists; a monumental fountain created by Francois Stahly; and an avenue of pines preserved from the early days of the park.

The Arboretum de l&#x27;École du Breuil, in the park&#x27;s southeast corner, is a municipal arboretum established at this location in 1936. It was created in 1867 by Baron Haussmann as the city&#x27;s school of horticulture and arboriculture. Today the arboretum contains about 2000 trees, as well as notable collections of shrubs, four hundred varieties of heritage apple and pear trees, and three hundred varieties of lilac.
*The Jardin tropical de Paris, of 4.5 hectares, was originally the Colonial Experimental Garden, opened in 1899 to study tropical plants. In 1907 it was the site of the first French Colonial Exposition, with pavilions and villages, complete with inhabitants, from different parts of the Empire. (See history above). The garden gradually fell into disrepair; the tropical plants were largely replaced by French plants, though bamboo, rubber trees and a few other exotic plants can still be found. The pavilions of the French Congo, French Guiana, French Indochina, Réunion, and Tunisia, mostly vandalized and in ruins, can still be seen, as well as vestiges of the old Indochinese garden. In 1916, the first-ever mosque built in France in more than a millennium was erected in the as part of a hospital complex that served Muslim soldiers. It was disaffected and demolished in 1919. The garden was taken over by the City of Paris in 2003, and it is gradually being redesigned and replanted. 
 
*The Paris Zoological Park, also known as Zoo of Vincennes, was opened in 1934, inspired by the popular zoo of the 1931 Colonial Exposition. It was modelled upon the Tierpark Hagenbeck in Hamburg, and was revolutionary for its time for putting the animals in open plateaus separated from the public by moats rather than in cages. The most prominent feature is a sixty-five meter high artificial mountain, which is the home of a herd of mouflon, or wild sheep. The zoo has a notable history of successfully breeding wild species, including Indian elephants. The park suffered from the crumbling of its concrete buildings in the 1980s, since they had been built to last only fifty years. It was closed in 2008 for major renovation, and reopened in 2014.
===Architecture===
*The Cartoucherie de Vincennes is a former ammunition factory which has been turned into a theater center, which hosts many small theater companies. It was converted in 1970 by the Théâtre du Soleil, led by stage director Ariane Mnouchkine and actor Philippe Léotard.
*The Hippodrome of Vincennes was opened on 29 March 1863, and is devoted largely to harness racing. it was badly damaged during the French-German War of 1870–71, and was rebuilt in 1983. The tribunes today hold 35,000 spectators. Between 1970 and 1992, it was a concert venue for performers including the Grateful Dead, Bruce Springsteen, Elton John and Michael Jackson.
*The Vélodrome Jacques-Anquetil is a cycling stadium, built in 1896 and used in the 1900 Summer Olympics and 1924 Summer Olympics. It can hold forty thousand spectators. It is popularly called &quot;La Cipale&quot;, short for &quot;Piste Municipale&quot;.
*The Ferme Georges-Ville, also known as the Farm of Paris, is a small farm located next to the Hippodrome of Vincennes, designed to show schoolchildren a real working farm. It features cows, pigs, sheep and other farm animals, and small fields of corn, wheat and other crops. It is named for the French agronomist George Ville (1824–1897), who, with the support of the Emperor Louis Napoleon, introduced the use of chemical fertilizer to French farming.
*The Fort neuf de Vincennes (New fort of Vincennes, located in the north of the park near the Chateau de Vincennes, is a military installation serving as a training center and the headquarters of the medical services of the French military and other military detachments. It was one of ring of fifteen forts built in a circle around Paris by King Louis Philippe I between 1841 and 1843. It is not open to the public.
*The Institut national du sport, de l&#x27;expertise et de la performance (National Institute of sport, expertise, and performance), or INSEP, is the national training school for physical education and sports, under the National Institute of Sport and Physical Education. Established in 1975, it includes facilities for training in swimming, gymnastics, tennis, shooting, archery, gymnastics, fencing, cycling and other sports, and has trained many French Olympic athletes. 
== Human trafficking ==

Several prostitution rings related to human trafficking in West Africa operate in the Bois de Vincennes. As explained by French senator Christian Cambon: 

Most prostitutes await customers along the &quot;Route de la Pyramide&quot; out on the sidewalk or in nearby vans on the curbside parking and signal their presence by illuminating their windshields. As they are intimidated into paying off their journey from Nigeria, they are often subject to sexual or physical violence from their customers.

<text>Baranya (, ; German: &quot;Branau&quot;; Croatian:&quot; Baranjska županija&quot;) is a county () in southern Hungary. It is part of the Southern Transdanubia statistical region and the historical Baranya region, which was a county (&quot;comitatus&quot;) in the Kingdom of Hungary dating back to the 11th century. Its current status as one of the 19 counties of Hungary was established in 1950 as part of wider Soviet administrative territorial reform following World War II. It is bordered by Somogy County to the northwest, Tolna County to the north, Bács-Kiskun County and the Danube to the east, and the border with Croatia (part of which is formed by the Drava River) to the south.

As of the 2011 census, it had a population of 386,441 residents. Of the 19 counties of Hungary (excluding Budapest), it is ranked 10th, both in terms of geographic area and population. Its county seat and largest city is Pécs.

== Etymology ==
In German, it is known as , and in Croatian as .

The county was probably named after its first comes &#x27;Brana&#x27; or &#x27;Braina&#x27;.

==Geography==
This county has a total area of – 4.76% of Hungary – which is divided in Upper Baranya and Lower Baranya.

The northern part of the county is a mountain area with large forests, the Mecsek Mountains. The central areas are shared between the Baranya Hills and Villány Mountains. The very eastern and southern parts are flat.

The highest point in the county is Zengő in the Mecsek Mountains, at 682 metres. This is also the highest point of the mountain range.

Baranya is rich in mineral and thermal water, and also in other resources. 98% of Hungary&#x27;s coal resources are found here.

===Neighbours===
* Tolna County in the North.
* Bács-Kiskun County in the East. (across the Danube river)
* Croatia in the south (across the Drava river) – Osijek-Baranja County and Virovitica-Podravina County
* Somogy County in the Northwest.

=== Climate ===
The climate of Baranya is a mix of continental and temperate, which makes it unique in Hungary, as the rest of the country is primarily continental. Its milder climate is due to its southern location and relative proximity to the Mediterranean Sea in comparison to other parts of the country, leaving it with warmer winters. It has the highest average annual rainfall of the Hungarian counties and a high amount of sunshine hours.

==History==

The area has been inhabited since ancient times. Before the Hungarian tribes conquered the area, it was inhabited by Slavs and Avars. Stephen I founded an episcopal seat here.

In 1526, the county was occupied by Ottomans and was freed in 1689. Its medieval borders remained unchanged until 1919. According to the peace treaty of Trianon, the southern part of the county () reverted to Slavic rule (present-day Croatia). The re-organizing of the counties (1950) brought only minor changes (town of Szigetvár got there).

Baranya has the largest number of minorities in Hungary (more than twice the country average), providing home to 34% of the German minority, the so-called Danube Swabians, and 32% of the Southern Slav minorities in Hungary.

The &quot;Stifolder&quot; or &quot;Stiffoller Shvove&quot; are a Roman Catholic subgroup of the so-called Danube Swabians. Their ancestors once came ca. 1717 - 1804 from the Hochstift Fulda and surroundings (Roman Catholic Diocese of Fulda), and settled in Baranya. They retained their own German dialect and culture, until the end of WW2. After WW2, the majority of Danube Swabians were expelled to allied-occupied Germany and allied-occupied Austria, in accordance with the 1945 Potsdam Agreement.

Only a few people can speak the old Stiffolerisch Schvovish dialect. Also a salami is named after these people.

<doc id="923406" wikidata="Q608613" url="?curid=923406" title="Fall of the Western Roman Empire">
<text>The fall of the Western Roman Empire, also called the fall of the Roman Empire or the fall of Rome, was the loss of central political control in the Western Roman Empire, a process in which the Empire failed to enforce its rule, and its vast territory was divided among several successor polities. The Roman Empire lost the strengths that had allowed it to exercise effective control over its Western provinces; modern historians posit factors including the effectiveness and numbers of the army, the health and numbers of the Roman population, the strength of the economy, the competence of the emperors, the internal struggles for power, the religious changes of the period, and the efficiency of the civil administration. Increasing pressure from invading peoples outside Roman culture also contributed greatly to the collapse. Climatic changes and both endemic and epidemic disease drove many of these immediate factors. The reasons for the collapse are major subjects of the historiography of the ancient world and they inform much modern discourse on state failure.

In 376, a large migration of Goths and other non-Roman people, fleeing from the Huns, entered the Empire. Roman forces were unable to exterminate, expel or subjugate them (as was their normal practice). In 395, after winning two destructive civil wars, Theodosius I died. He left a collapsing field army, and the Empire divided between the warring ministers of his two incapable sons. Goths and other non-Romans became a force that could challenge either part of the Empire. Further barbarian groups crossed the Rhine and other frontiers. The armed forces of the Western Empire became few and ineffective, and despite brief recoveries under able leaders, central rule was never again effectively consolidated.

By 476, the position of Western Roman Emperor wielded negligible military, political, or financial power, and had no effective control over the scattered Western domains that could still be described as Roman. Barbarian kingdoms had established their own power in much of the area of the Western Empire. In 476, the Germanic barbarian king Odoacer deposed the last emperor of the Western Roman Empire in Italy, Romulus Augustulus, and the Senate sent the imperial insignia to the Eastern Roman Emperor Zeno.

While its legitimacy lasted for centuries longer and its cultural influence remains today, the Western Empire never had the strength to rise again. The Eastern Roman, or Byzantine, Empire, survived and remained for centuries an effective power of the Eastern Mediterranean, although it lessened in strength. While the loss of political unity and military control is universally acknowledged, the fall of Rome is not the only unifying concept for these events; the period described as late antiquity emphasizes the cultural continuities throughout and beyond the political collapse.

== Historical approaches and modern syntheses ==
Since 1776, when Edward Gibbon published the first volume of his &quot;The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire&quot;, Decline and Fall has been the theme around which much of the history of the Roman Empire has been structured. &quot;From the eighteenth century onward,&quot; historian Glen Bowersock wrote, &quot;we have been obsessed with the fall: it has been valued as an archetype for every perceived decline, and, hence, as a symbol for our own fears.&quot;

=== Another paradigm of the period ===
From at least the time of Henri Pirenne (1862–1935), scholars have described a continuity of Roman culture and political legitimacy long after 476. Pirenne postponed the demise of classical civilization to the 8th century. He challenged the notion that Germanic barbarians had caused the Western Roman Empire to end, and he refused to equate the end of the Western Roman Empire with the end of the office of emperor in Italy. He pointed out the essential continuity of the economy of the Roman Mediterranean even after the barbarian invasions, and suggested that only the Muslim conquests represented a decisive break with antiquity.

The more recent formulation of a historical period characterized as &quot;Late Antiquity&quot; emphasizes the transformations of ancient to medieval worlds within a cultural continuity. In recent decades archaeologically based argument even extends the continuity in material culture and in patterns of settlement as late as the eleventh century. Observing the political reality of lost control (and the attendant fragmentation of commerce, culture, and language), but also the cultural and archaeological continuities, the process has been described as a complex cultural transformation, rather than a fall. The .

=== Timespan ===
A synthesis by Harper (2017) gave four decisive turns of events in the transformation from the height of the empire to the early Middle Ages:

* The Antonine Plague that ended a long period of demographic and economic expansion, weakening but not toppling the empire.
* The Crisis of the Third Century, in which natural climate change, renewed pandemic disease, and internal and external political instability led to the near-collapse of the imperial system. Its reconstitution included a new basis for the currency, an expanded professional government apparatus, emperors further distanced from their people, and, shortly, the rise of Christianity, a proselytizing, exclusive religion that anticipated the imminent end of the world.
* The military and political failure of the West, in which mass migration from the Eurasian steppe overcame and dismembered the western part of an internally-weakened empire. The eastern empire rebuilt itself again and began the reconquest of the West.
* In the lands around the Mediterranean the Late Antique Little Ice Age and the Plague of Justinian created one of the worst environmental cataclysms in recorded history. The imperial system crumbled in the next couple of generations and then lost vast territories to the armies of Islam, a new proselytizing, exclusive religion that also looked forward to an imminent end time. The diminished and impoverished Byzantine rump state survived amid perpetual strife between and among the followers of Christianity and Islam.

The loss of centralized political control over the West, and the lessened power of the East, are universally agreed, but the theme of decline has been taken to cover a much wider time span than the hundred years from 376. For Cassius Dio, the accession of the emperor Commodus in 180 CE marked the descent &quot;from a kingdom of gold to one of rust and iron&quot;. Since the age of humanism, the process of the Fall has been thought to have begun with Constantine the Great, or with the soldier emperors who seized power through command of the army from 235 through 284, or with Commodus, or even with Augustus.

Gibbon was uncertain about when decline began. &quot;In the first paragraph of his text, Gibbon wrote that he intended to trace the decline from the golden age of the Antonines&quot;; later text has it beginning about A.D. 180 with the death of Marcus Aurelius; while in chapter 7, he pushes the start of the decline to about 52 B.C., the time of Julius Caesar and Pompey and Cicero. Gibbon placed the western empire&#x27;s end with the removal of the man Gibbon referred to as &quot;the helpless Augustulus&quot; in 476.

Arnold J. Toynbee and James Burke argue that the entire Imperial era was one of steady decay of institutions founded in republican times. Theodor Mommsen excluded the imperial period from his Nobel Prize-winning &quot;History of Rome&quot; (1854–1856). As one convenient marker for the end, 476 has been used since Gibbon, but other key dates for the fall of the Roman Empire in the West include the Crisis of the Third Century, the Crossing of the Rhine in 406 (or 405), the sack of Rome in 410, and the death of Julius Nepos in 480.

===Causes, according to Gibbon (1776–1789)===
When Gibbon published his landmark work, it quickly became the standard. Peter Brown has written that . Gibbon was the first to attempt an explanation of causes of a fall of empire. Like other Enlightenment thinkers and British citizens of the age steeped in institutional anti-Catholicism, Gibbon held in contempt the Middle Ages as a priest-ridden, superstitious Dark Age. It was not until his own era, the &quot;Age of Reason&quot;, with its emphasis on rational thought, it was believed, that human history could resume its progress.

He began an ongoing controversy about the role of Christianity, but he gave great weight to other causes of internal decline and to attacks from outside the Empire. 
=== Contemporary views ===
Modern historiography diverges from Gibbon. While most of his ideas are no longer accepted in totality, they have been foundational to later discourse and the modern synthesis with archaeology, epidemiology, climatic history, genetic science, and many more new sources of history beyond the documentary sources that were all that was available to Gibbon.

While Alexander Demandt enumerated 210 different theories on why Rome fell, twenty-first century scholarship classifies the primary possibilities more concisely:

==== Climatic crisis ====
A recent summary interprets disease and climate change as important drivers of the political collapse of the empire. There was a Roman climatic optimum from about 200 BCE to 150 CE, when lands around the Mediterranean were generally warm and well-watered. This made agriculture prosperous, army recruitment easy, and the collection of taxes straightforward. From about 150, the climate became on average somewhat worse for most of the inhabited lands around the Mediterranean. After about 450, the climate worsened further in the Late Antique Little Ice Age that may have directly contributed to the variety of factors that brought Rome down.

The Roman Empire was built on the fringes of the tropics. Its roads and its pirate-free seas, which produced an abundance of trade, also unknowingly created an interconnected disease ecology that unleashed the evolution and spread of pathogens. Pandemics contributed to massive demographic changes, economic crises, and food shortages in the crisis of the third century. Heavy mortality in 165–180 from the Antonine Plague seriously impaired attempts to repel Germanic invaders, but the legions generally held or at least speedily re-instated the borders of the Empire.
==== Migrational crisis ====
From 376, massive populations moved into the Empire, driven by the Huns who themselves may have been driven by climate change in the Eurasian steppe. These barbarian invasions led ultimately to barbarian kingdoms over much of the former territory of the Western Empire. But the final blow came only with the Late Antique Little Ice Age and its aftermath, when Rome was already politically fragmented and materially depleted.

==== Political crisis ====
Aurelian reunited the empire in 274, and from 284 Diocletian and his successors reorganized it with more emphasis on the military. John the Lydian, writing over two centuries later, reported that Diocletian&#x27;s army at one point totaled 389,704 men, plus 45,562 in the fleets, and numbers may have increased later. With the limited communications of the time, both the European and the Eastern frontiers needed the attention of their own supreme commanders. Diocletian tried to solve this problem by re-establishing an adoptive succession with a senior (&quot;Augustus&quot;) and junior (&quot;Caesar&quot;) emperor in each half of the Empire, but this system of tetrarchy broke down within one generation and the hereditary principle re-established itself with generally unfortunate results. Thereafter civil war became again the main method of establishing new imperial regimes. Although Constantine the Great (in office 306 to 337) again re-united the Empire, towards the end of the fourth century the need for division was generally accepted. From then on, the Empire existed in constant tension between the need for two emperors and their mutual mistrust.

Until late in the fourth century, the united Empire retained sufficient power to launch powerful attacks against its enemies in Germania and in the Sasanian Empire. of barbarians became widely practised: imperial authorities admitted potentially hostile groups into the Empire, split them up, and allotted to them lands, status, and duties within the imperial system.
In this way many groups provided unfree workers for Roman landowners, and recruits () for the Roman army. Sometimes their leaders became officers. Normally the Romans managed the process carefully, with sufficient military force on hand to ensure compliance. Cultural assimilation followed over the next generation or two.
==== Financial crisis ====
The Empire suffered multiple serious crises during the third century. The rising Sassanid Empire inflicted three crushing defeats on Roman field armies and remained a potent threat for centuries. Other disasters included repeated civil wars, barbarian invasions, and more mass-mortality in the Plague of Cyprian (from 250 onwards). For a short period, the Empire split into a Gallic Empire in the West (260–274), a Palmyrene Empire in the East (260–273), and a central Roman rump state; in 271, Rome abandoned the province of Dacia on the north of the Danube. The Rhine/Danube frontier also came under more effective threats from larger barbarian groupings, which had developed improved agriculture and increased their populations. The average stature of the population in the West suffered a serious decline in the late second century; the population of Northwestern Europe did not recover, though the Mediterranean regions did.

The Empire survived the &quot;Crisis of the Third Century&quot;, directing its economy successfully towards defense, but survival came at the price of a more centralized and bureaucratic state. Excessive military expenditure, coupled with civil wars due to unstable succession, caused increased taxes to the detriment of the industry. Under Gallienus (Emperor from 253 to 268) the senatorial aristocracy ceased joining the ranks of the senior military commanders. Its typical members lacked interest in military service, and showed incompetence at command.
Under Constantine, the cities lost their revenue from local taxes, and under Constantius II (r. 337–361) their endowments of property. This worsened the existing difficulty in keeping the city councils up to strength, and the services provided by the cities were scamped or abandoned. Public building projects had declined since the second century. There is no evidence of state participation in, or support for, restoration and maintenance of temples and shrines. Restorations were funded and accomplished privately, which limited what was done. A further financial abuse was Constantius&#x27;s habit of granting to his immediate entourage the estates of persons condemned for treason and other capital crimes. This practice reduced future, though not immediate, income; those close to the emperor also gained a strong incentive to encourage his suspicion of conspiracies.

==== Social crisis ====
The new supreme rulers disposed of the legal fiction of the early Empire (seeing the emperor as but the first among equals); emperors from Aurelian (r. 270–275) onwards openly styled themselves as , &quot;lord and god&quot;, titles appropriate for a master-slave relationship. An elaborate court ceremonial developed, and obsequious flattery became the order of the day. Under Diocletian, the flow of direct requests to the emperor rapidly reduced, and soon ceased altogether. No other form of direct access replaced them, and the emperor received only information filtered through his courtiers. However, as Sabine MacCormack described, the court culture that developed with Diocletian was still subject to pressure from below. Imperial proclamations were used to stress the traditional limitations of the imperial office, while imperial ceremonies &quot;left room for consensus and popular participation&quot;.

Official cruelty, supporting extortion and corruption, may also have become more commonplace; one example being Constantine&#x27;s law that slaves who betrayed their mistress&#x27;s confidential remarks should have molten lead poured down their throats. While the scale, complexity, and violence of government were unmatched, the emperors lost control over their whole realm insofar as that control came increasingly to be wielded by anyone who paid for it. Meanwhile, the richest senatorial families, immune from most taxation, engrossed more and more of the available wealth and income while also becoming divorced from any tradition of military excellence. One scholar identifies a great increase in the purchasing power of gold, two and a half fold from 274 to the later fourth century. This may be an index of growing economic inequality between a gold-rich elite and a cash-poor peasantry. . However, Lucius Calpurnius Piso Frugi (consul 133 BC) had already dated the start of Rome&#x27;s moral decline to 154 BCE.

Within the late Roman military, many recruits and even officers had barbarian origins. Soldiers are recorded as using possibly-barbarian rituals, such as elevating a claimant on shields. Some scholars have seen this as an indication of weakness. Others disagree, seeing neither barbarian recruits nor new rituals as causing any problem with the effectiveness or loyalty of the army, at least while that army was effectively led, disciplined, trained, paid, and supplied by officers who identified as Roman.

==== Geography ====
A. H. M. Jones has pointed out that the earlier scholarly views are Western. Most of the weaknesses discussed by scholars were &quot;common to both halves of the empire&quot;, with Christianity even more prevalent in the East than the West. Religious disputes were bitter, bureaucracy corrupt and extortionate, it had a caste system, and land fell out of use in the East just as it had in the West. Yet the East stood its ground in the fifth century, fought back in the sixth, and even recovered some territory in the seventh. The East had only one apparent advantage: geography. It was less vulnerable, strategically, than the West. The narrowest sea crossing to its core territories was protected from the northern barbarians by the fortifications and the sea and land forces of Constantinople, while the European frontier from the mouth of the Rhine to that of the Danube is some 2000 kilometres great-circle distance and could be crossed with much less difficulty. .

== Height of power, systematic weaknesses as direct causes ==
The Roman Empire reached its greatest geographical extent under Trajan (r. 98–117), who ruled a prosperous state that stretched from Armenia to the Atlantic Ocean. The Empire had large numbers of trained, supplied, and disciplined soldiers, drawn from a growing population. It had a comprehensive civil administration based in thriving cities with effective control over public finances. The literate elite considered theirs to be the only worthwhile form of civilization, giving the Empire ideological legitimacy and a cultural unity based on comprehensive familiarity with Greek and Roman literature and rhetoric. The Empire&#x27;s power allowed it to maintain extreme differences of wealth and status. Its wide-ranging trade networks permitted even modest households to use goods made by professionals far away.

The empire had both strength and resilience. Its financial system allowed it to raise significant taxes which, despite endemic corruption, supported a large regular army with logistics and training. The , a standardized series of military and civil posts organised for ambitious aristocratic men, ensured that powerful noblemen had the opportunity to become familiar with military and civil command and administration. At a lower level within the army, connecting the aristocrats at the top with the private soldiers, a large number of centurions were well-rewarded, literate, and responsible for training, discipline, administration, and leadership in battle. City governments with their own properties and revenues functioned effectively at a local level; membership of city councils involved lucrative opportunities for independent decision-making, and, despite its obligations, became seen as a privilege. Under a series of emperors who each adopted a mature and capable successor, the Empire did not require civil wars to regulate the imperial succession. Requests could be submitted directly to the better emperors, and the answers had the force of law, putting the imperial power directly in touch with even humble subjects. The cults of polytheist religion were hugely varied, but none claimed that theirs was the only truth. Their followers displayed mutual tolerance, producing a polyphonous religious harmony. Religious strife was rare after the suppression of the Bar Kokhba revolt in 136, after which the devastated Judaea ceased to be a major centre for Jewish unrest.

Nevertheless, it remained a culture based on an early subsistence economy, with only ineffective inklings of a germ theory of disease. Despite its aqueducts, the water supply did not allow good hygiene. Sewage was disposed of on the streets, in open drains, or by scavenging animals. Even in the Roman Climatic Optimum, local harvest failures causing famines were always a possibility. And even in good times, Roman women needed to have, on average, six children each in order to maintain the population. Good nourishment and bodily cleanliness were privileges of the rich, advertised by their firm tread, healthy skin color, and lack of the . Infant mortality was very high, and diarrhoeal diseases were a major cause of death. Malaria was endemic in many areas, notably in the city of Rome itself, possibly encouraged by the enthusiasm of rich Romans for water features in their gardens.

=== Rise of Christianity, possible decline of the armed forces ===
In 313, Constantine the Great declared official toleration of Christianity. This was followed over the ensuing decades by the search for a definition of Christian orthodoxy all could agree upon. Creeds were developed, but Christianity has never agreed upon an official version of its Bible or its doctrine; instead it has had many different manuscript traditions. Christianity&#x27;s disputes may have effected decline. Official and private action was taken against heterodox Christians (heretics) from the fourth century up to the modern era. Limited action against pagans, who were mostly ignored, was based on the contempt that accompanied Christianity&#x27;s sense of triumph after Constantine. Christianity opposed sacrifice and magic, and Christian emperors made laws that favored Christianity. Constantine&#x27;s successors generally continued this approach, and by the end of the fourth century, Christianity had become the religion of any ambitious civil official.

The wealth of the Christian Church increased dramatically in the fifth century. Immense resources, both public and private, were used for building churches, storage barns for the grain used for charity, new hospitals for the poor, and in support of those in religious life without other income. Bishops in wealthy cities were thus able to offer patronage in the long-established manner of Roman aristocrats. Ammianus described some who .

But the move to Christianity probably had no significant effects on public finances. The large temple complexes, with professional full-time priests, festivals, and large numbers of sacrifices (which became free food for the masses), had also been expensive to maintain. They had already been negatively impacted by the empire&#x27;s financial struggles in the third century. The numbers of clergy, monks, and nuns increased to perhaps half the size of the actual army, and they have been considered as a drain on limited manpower.

The numbers and effectiveness of the regular soldiers may have declined during the fourth century. Payrolls were inflated, so that pay could be diverted and exemptions from duty sold. The soldiers&#x27; opportunities for personal extortion were multiplied by residence in cities, while their effectiveness was reduced by concentration on extortion instead of military exercises. However, extortion, gross corruption, and occasional ineffectiveness were not new to the Roman army. There is no consensus whether its effectiveness significantly declined before 376. Ammianus Marcellinus, himself a professional soldier, repeats longstanding observations about the superiority of contemporary Roman armies being due to training and discipline, not to individual size or strength. He also accuses Valentinian I of being the first emperor to increase the arrogance of the military, raising their rank and power to excess, severely punishing the minor crimes of the common soldiers, while sparing those of higher rank who felt able to commit shameful and monstrous crimes. Despite a possible decrease in the Empire&#x27;s ability to assemble and supply large armies, Rome maintained an aggressive and potent stance against perceived threats almost to the end of the fourth century.

== 313–376: civil and foreign wars ==
Constantine settled Franks on the lower left bank of the Rhine. Their communities required a line of fortifications to keep them in check, indicating that Rome had lost almost all local control. Under Constantius, bandits came to dominate areas such as Isauria, which were well within the empire. The tribes of Germania also became more populous and more threatening. In Gaul, which did not really recover from the invasions of the third century, there was widespread insecurity and economic decline in the 300s, perhaps worst in Armorica. By 350, after decades of pirate attacks, virtually all villas in Armorica were deserted. Local use of money ceased around 360. Repeated attempts to economize on military expenditure included billeting troops in cities, where they could less easily be kept under military discipline and could more easily extort from civilians. Except in the rare case of a determined and incorruptible general, these troops proved ineffective in action and dangerous to civilians. Frontier troops were often given land rather than pay. As they farmed for themselves, their direct costs diminished, but so did their effectiveness, and their pay gave much less stimulus to the frontier economy. However, except for the provinces along the lower Rhine, the agricultural economy was generally doing well.

On January 18 350, the imperial magister officiorum gave a banquet in Augustodunum while his master, Western Emperor Constans, was away hunting. During the feast Magnus Magnentius, commander of the imperial household troops, appeared in an imperial purple toga and announced himself to be the new Emperor. Constans was soon murdered and Magnentius took over most of his western domains. He made peace overtures to Constantius in the East, but these failed. In the ensuing bloody civil war Magnentius marched against Constantius with as many troops as he could mobilize, stripping the Rhine frontier of its most effective troops. Magnentius died and so did many of his men. Meanwhile, Constantius sent messages to the German tribes east of the Rhine, inviting them to attack Gaul, which they did. In the next few years a strip some 40 miles wide to the west of the Rhine was occupied by the Germans, and a further 120 miles into Gaul the surviving population and garrisons had fled.

Julian () won victories against Germans who had invaded Gaul. He launched a drive against official corruption, which allowed the tax demands in Gaul to be reduced to one-third of their previous amount, while all government requirements were still met. In civil legislation, Julian was notable for his pro-pagan policies. Julian lifted the ban on sacrifices, restored and reopened temples, and dismantled the privileged tax status and revenue concessions of the Christians. He gave generous tax remissions to the cities which he favored, and disfavor to those who remained Christian. Julian ordered toleration of varieties of Christianity banned as heretical by Constantius; possibly, he would not have been able to persecute effectively such a large and powerful group as Christians had now become.

Julian prepared for civil war against Constantius, who again encouraged the Germans to attack Gaul. However Julian&#x27;s campaigns had been effective and only one small Alemannic raid, speedily dealt with by Julian, resulted. Constantius died before any serious fighting and Julian was acknowledged as master of the entire Empire. He launched an expensive campaign against the Sasanian Persians. He succeeded in marching to the Sassanid capital of Ctesiphon, but, at the suggestion of a Persian agent, burned his boats and supplies to show resolve in continuing operations. The Sassanids then burned crops so the Roman army had no food. Finding himself cut off without supplies in enemy territory, Julian began a land retreat, and during the Battle of Samarra, he was mortally wounded.

Julian&#x27;s successor Jovian, acclaimed by a demoralized army, began his brief reign (363–364) while trapped in Mesopotamia without supplies. To purchase safe passage home, he had to concede areas of northern Mesopotamia, including the strategically important fortress of Nisibis. This fortress had been Roman since before the Peace of Nisibis in 299.

The brothers Valens () and Valentinian I () energetically tackled the threats of barbarian attacks on all the Western frontiers. They also tried to alleviate the burdens of taxation, which had risen continuously over the previous forty years; Valens in the East reduced the tax demand by half in his fourth year. Both of them were Christians, and re-confiscated the temple lands which Julian had restored. But they were generally tolerant of other beliefs. Valentinian in the West refused to intervene in Christian controversy. In the East, Valens had to deal with Christians who did not conform to his ideas of orthodoxy, and persecution formed part of his response. He tolerated paganism, even keeping some of Julian&#x27;s associates in their trusted positions. He confirmed the rights and privileges of the pagan priests, and confirmed the right of pagans to be the exclusive caretakers of their temples.

Valentinian died of an apoplexy while shouting at envoys of Germanic leaders. His successors in the West were children, his sons Gratian () and Valentinian II (). Gratian, , removed the Altar of Victory from the Senate House. He also rejected the pagan title of Pontifex Maximus.

== 376–395: invasions, civil wars, and religious discord ==
=== Battle of Adrianople ===
In 376, the East faced an enormous barbarian influx across the Danube, mostly Goths, who were fleeing from the Huns. They were exploited by corrupt officials rather than effectively relieved and resettled, and they took up arms and were joined by more Goths and some Alans and Huns. Valens was in Asia with his main field army preparing for an assault on the Sasanian Empire. Redirection of the army and its logistic support would have required time, and Gratian&#x27;s armies were distracted by Germanic invasions across the Rhine. In 378, Valens attacked the invaders with the Eastern field army, now perhaps 20,000 men, probably much fewer than the forces that Julian had led into Mesopotamia a little over a decade before, and possibly only 10% of the soldiers nominally available in the Danube provinces. In the Battle of Adrianople (9 August 378), Valens lost much of that army and his own life. All of the Balkan provinces were thus exposed to raiding, without effective response from the remaining garrisons who were . Cities were able to hold their own defensive walls against barbarians who had no siege equipment, therefore the cities generally remained intact, although the countryside suffered.

=== Partial recovery in the Balkans, internal corruption and financial desperation ===
Gratian appointed a new &quot;Augustus&quot;, a proven general from Hispania called Theodosius. During the next four years, he partially re-established the Roman position in the East. These campaigns depended on effective imperial coordination and mutual trust—between 379 and 380, Theodosius controlled not only the Eastern empire, but also, by agreement, the diocese of Illyricum. Theodosius was unable to recruit enough Roman troops, relying on barbarian warbands without Roman military discipline or loyalty. (In contrast, during the Cimbrian War, the Roman Republic, controlling a smaller area than the western Empire, had been able to reconstitute large regular armies of citizens after greater defeats than Adrianople. That war had ended with the near-extermination of the invading barbarian supergroups, each supposed to have more than 100,000 warriors.)

The final Gothic settlement was acclaimed with relief, even the official panegyrist admitting that these Goths could not be expelled or exterminated, nor reduced to unfree status. Instead they were either recruited into the imperial forces, or settled in the devastated provinces along the south bank of the Danube, where the regular garrisons were never fully re-established. In some later accounts, and widely in recent work, this is regarded as a treaty settlement, the first time that barbarians were given a home within the Empire, in which they retained their political and military cohesion. No formal treaty is recorded, nor details of whatever agreement was actually made. When the Goths are next mentioned in Roman records, they have different leaders and are soldiers of a sort. In 391, Alaric, a Gothic leader, rebelled against Roman control. Goths attacked the emperor himself, but within a year Alaric was accepted as a leader of Theodosius&#x27;s Gothic troops and this rebellion was over.

Theodosius&#x27;s financial position must have been difficult, since he had to pay for expensive campaigning from a reduced tax base. The business of subduing barbarian warbands also demanded substantial gifts of precious metal. At least one extra levy provoked desperation and rioting, in which the emperor&#x27;s statues were destroyed. Nevertheless, he is represented as financially generous as emperor, though frugal in his personal life. By the end of the 380s, Theodosius and the court were in Mediolanum, and northern Italy was experiencing a period of prosperity for the great landowners who took advantage of the court&#x27;s need for food, &quot;turning agrarian produce into gold&quot;, while repressing and misusing the poor who grew it and brought it in. Paulinus the Deacon, notary of Ambrose the bishop of Milan, described these men as creating a court where . Ambrose himself preached a series of sermons aimed at his wealthy constituents, asserting that avarice leads to a breakdown in society.

For centuries, Theodosius was regarded as a champion of Christian orthodoxy who decisively stamped out paganism. His predecessors Constantine, Constantius II, and Valens had all been semi-Arians, whereas Theodosius supported Nicene Christianity which eventually became the orthodox version of Christology for most later Christian churches—his Edict of Thessalonica described Arian Christians as &quot;foolish madmen&quot;. Therefore, as far as Ambrose and the Christian literary tradition that followed him were concerned, Theodosius deserved most of the credit for the final triumph of Christianity. Modern scholars see this as a Christian interpretation of history. Theodosius did not stamp out paganism, which continued into the seventh century.

=== Civil wars ===
Theodosius had to face a powerful usurper in the West; Magnus Maximus declared himself Emperor in 383, stripped troops from the outlying regions of Roman Britain (probably replacing some with federate chieftains and their war-bands) and invaded Gaul. His troops killed Gratian and he was accepted as Augustus in the Gallic provinces, where he was responsible for the first official executions of Christian heretics. To compensate the Western court for the loss of Gaul, Hispania, and Britannia, Theodosius ceded the diocese of Dacia and the diocese of Macedonia to their control. In 387 Maximus invaded Italy, forcing Valentinian II to flee to the East, where he accepted Nicene Christianity. Maximus boasted to Ambrose of the numbers of barbarians in his forces, and hordes of Goths, Huns, and Alans followed Theodosius. Maximus negotiated with Theodosius for acceptance as &quot;Augustus&quot; of the West, but Theodosius refused, gathered his armies, and counterattacked, winning the civil war in 388. There were heavy troop losses on both sides of the conflict. Later Welsh legend has Maximus&#x27;s defeated troops resettled in Armorica, instead of returning to Britannia, and by 400, Armorica was controlled by Bagaudae rather than by imperial authority.

Theodosius restored Valentinian II, still a very young man, as &quot;Augustus&quot; in the West. He also appointed Arbogast, a pagan general of Frankish origin, as Valentinian&#x27;s commander-in-chief and guardian. Valentinian quarreled in public with Arbogast, failed to assert any authority, and died, either by suicide or by murder, at the age of 21. Arbogast and Theodosius failed to come to terms and Arbogast nominated an imperial official, Eugenius (r. 392–394), as emperor in the West. Eugenius made some modest attempts to win pagan support, and with Arbogast led a large army to fight another destructive civil war. They were defeated and killed at the Battle of the Frigidus, which was attended by further heavy losses; especially among the Gothic federates of Theodosius. The north-eastern approaches to Italy were never effectively garrisoned again.

Theodosius died a few months later in early 395, leaving his young sons Honorius (r. 393–423) and Arcadius (r. 383–408) as emperors. In the immediate aftermath of Theodosius&#x27;s death, the Stilicho, married to Theodosius&#x27;s niece, asserted himself in the West as the guardian of Honorius and commander of the remains of the defeated Western army. He also claimed control over Arcadius in Constantinople, but Rufinus, on the spot, had already established his own power there. Henceforward the Empire was not under the control of one man, until much of the West had been permanently lost. Neither Honorius nor Arcadius ever displayed any ability either as rulers or as generals, and both lived as the puppet rulers of their courts. Stilicho tried to reunite the Eastern and Western courts under his personal control, but in doing so achieved only the continued hostility of all of Arcadius&#x27;s successive supreme ministers.

== Military, financial, and political ineffectiveness: the process of failure ==
The ineffectiveness of Roman military responses during Stilicho&#x27;s rule and afterwards has been described as &quot;shocking&quot;. There is little evidence of indigenous field forces or of adequate training, discipline, pay, or supply for the barbarians who formed most of the available troops. Local defence was occasionally effective, but was often associated with withdrawal from central control and taxes. In many areas, barbarians under Roman authority attacked culturally-Roman &quot;Bagaudae&quot;. The fifth-century Western emperors, with brief exceptions, were individuals incapable of ruling effectively or even of controlling their own courts. Those exceptions were responsible for brief, but remarkable resurgences of Roman power.

Corruption, in this context the diversion of finance from the needs of the army, may have contributed greatly to the Fall. The rich senatorial aristocrats in Rome itself became increasingly influential during the fifth century; they supported armed strength in theory, but did not wish to pay for it or to offer their own workers as army recruits. They did, however, pass large amounts of money to the Christian Church. At a local level, from the early fourth century, the town councils lost their property and their power, which often became concentrated in the hands of a few local despots beyond the reach of the law.

== 395–406: Stilicho ==
Without an authoritative ruler, the Balkan provinces fell rapidly into disorder. Alaric was disappointed in his hopes for promotion to after the battle of the Frigidus. He led armed Gothic tribesmen in a revolt and established himself as an independent power, burning the countryside as far as the walls of Constantinople. Alaric&#x27;s ambitions for long-term Roman office were never quite acceptable to the Roman imperial courts, and his men could never settle long enough to farm in any one area. They showed no inclination to leave the Empire and face the Huns from whom they had fled in 376. Meanwhile, the Huns were still stirring up further migrations, with migrating tribes often attacking the Roman Empire in turn. Alaric&#x27;s group was never destroyed nor expelled from the Empire, nor acculturated under effective Roman domination.

=== Stilicho&#x27;s attempts to unify the Empire, revolts, and invasions ===
Alaric took his Gothic army on what Stilicho&#x27;s propagandist Claudian described as a &quot;pillaging campaign&quot; that began first in the East. Alaric&#x27;s forces made their way along the coast to Athens, where he sought to force a new peace upon the Romans. His march in 396 passed through Thermopylae. Stilicho sailed from Italy to Roman Greece with his remaining mobile forces, posing a clear threat to Rufinus&#x27;s control of the Eastern empire. The bulk of Rufinus&#x27;s forces were occupied with Hunnic incursions in Asia Minor and Syria, leaving Thracia undefended. Claudian reports that only Stilicho&#x27;s attack stemmed the plundering, as he pushed Alaric&#x27;s forces north into Epirus. Burns&#x27; interpretation is that Alaric and his men had been recruited by Rufinus&#x27;s Eastern regime, and sent to Thessaly to stave off Stilicho&#x27;s threat. No battle took place. Zosimus adds that Stilicho&#x27;s troops destroyed and pillaged too, and let Alaric&#x27;s men escape with their plunder.

Many of Stilicho&#x27;s Eastern forces wanted to go home and he had to let them go (though Claudian claims that he did so willingly). Some went to Constantinople under the command of one Gainas, a Goth with a large Gothic following. On arrival, Gainas murdered Rufinus, and was appointed for Thrace by Eutropius, the new supreme minister and the only eunuch consul of Rome. Eutropius reportedly controlled Arcadius &quot;as if he were a sheep&quot;. Stilicho obtained a few more troops from the German frontier and continued to campaign ineffectively against the Eastern empire; again he was successfully opposed by Alaric and his men. During the next year, 397, Eutropius personally led his troops to victory over some Huns who were marauding in Asia Minor. With his position thus strengthened, he declared Stilicho a public enemy, and he established Alaric as . A poem by Synesius advises the emperor to display manliness and remove a &quot;skin-clad savage&quot; (probably Alaric) from the councils of power and his barbarians from the Roman army. We do not know if Arcadius ever became aware of the existence of this advice, but it had no recorded effect. Synesius, from a province suffering the widespread ravages of a few poor but greedy barbarians, also complained of 

The in the Diocese of Africa declared for the East and stopped the supply of grain to Rome. Italy had not fed itself for centuries and could not do so now. In 398, Stilicho sent his last reserves, a few thousand men, to re-take the Diocese of Africa. He strengthened his position further when he married his daughter Maria to Honorius. Throughout this period Stilicho, and all other generals, were desperately short of recruits and supplies for them. In 400, Stilicho was charged to press into service any &quot;laetus, Alamannus, Sarmatian, vagrant, son of a veteran&quot; or any other person liable to serve. He had reached the bottom of his recruitment pool. Though personally not corrupt, he was very active in confiscating assets; the financial and administrative machine was not producing enough support for the army.

In 399, Tribigild&#x27;s rebellion in Asia Minor allowed Gainas to accumulate a significant army (mostly Goths), become supreme in the Eastern court, and execute Eutropius. He now felt that he could dispense with Alaric&#x27;s services and he nominally transferred Alaric&#x27;s province to the West. This administrative change removed Alaric&#x27;s Roman rank and his entitlement to legal provisioning for his men, leaving his army—the only significant force in the ravaged Balkans—as a problem for Stilicho. In 400, the citizens of Constantinople revolted against Gainas and massacred as many of his people, soldiers and their families, as they could catch. Some Goths at least built rafts and tried to cross the strip of sea that separates Asia from Europe; the Roman navy slaughtered them. By the beginning of 401, Gainas&#x27; head rode a pike through Constantinople while another Gothic general became consul. Meanwhile, groups of Huns started a series of attacks across the Danube, and the Isaurians marauded far and wide in Anatolia.

In 401 Stilicho travelled over the Alps to Raetia, to scrape up further troops. He left the Rhine defended only by the &quot;dread&quot; of Roman retaliation, rather than by adequate forces able to take the field. Early in spring, Alaric, probably desperate, invaded Italy, and he drove Honorius westward from Mediolanum, besieging him in Hasta Pompeia in Liguria. Stilicho returned as soon as the passes had cleared, meeting Alaric in two battles (near Pollentia and Verona) without decisive results. The Goths, weakened, were allowed to retreat back to Illyricum where the Western court again gave Alaric office, though only as comes and only over Dalmatia and Pannonia Secunda rather than the whole of Illyricum. Stilicho probably supposed that this pact would allow him to put Italian government into order and recruit fresh troops. He may also have planned with Alaric&#x27;s help to relaunch his attempts to gain control over the Eastern court.

However, in 405, Stilicho was distracted by a fresh invasion of Northern Italy. Another group of Goths fleeing the Huns, led by one Radagaisus, started the War of Radagaisus and devastated the north of Italy for six months before Stilicho could muster enough forces to take the field against them. Stilicho recalled troops from Britannia, and the depth of the crisis was shown when he urged all Roman soldiers to allow their personal slaves to fight beside them. His forces, including Huns and Alans, may in the end have totalled rather less than 15,000 men. Radagaisus was defeated and executed, while 12,000 prisoners from the defeated horde were drafted into Stilicho&#x27;s service. Stilicho continued negotiations with Alaric; Flavius Aetius, son of one of Stilicho&#x27;s major supporters, was sent as a hostage to Alaric in 405.

In 406, Stilicho heard of new invaders and rebels who had appeared in the northern provinces. He insisted on making peace with Alaric, probably on the basis that Alaric would prepare to move either against the Eastern court or against the rebels in Gaul. The Senate deeply resented peace with Alaric.

In 407, Alaric marched into Noricum and demanded a large payment for his expensive efforts in Stilicho&#x27;s interests. The senate, &quot;inspired by the courage, rather than the wisdom, of their predecessors,&quot; preferred war. One senator famously declaimed &quot;Non est ista pax, sed pactio servitutis&quot; (&quot;This is not peace, but a pact of servitude&quot;). Stilicho paid Alaric four thousand pounds of gold nevertheless. Stilicho sent Sarus, a Gothic general, over the Alps to face the usurper Constantine III. Sarus lost this campaign and barely escaped, having to leave his baggage to the bandits who now infested the Alpine passes.

The empress Maria, daughter of Stilicho, died in 407 or early 408 and her sister Aemilia Materna Thermantia married Honorius. In the East, Arcadius died on 1 May 408 and was replaced by his son Theodosius II. Stilicho seems to have planned to march to Constantinople, and to install there a regime loyal to himself. He may also have intended to give Alaric a senior official position, and to send him against the rebels in Gaul. Before he could do so, while he was away at Ticinum at the head of a small detachment, a bloody coup d&#x27;état against his supporters took place at Honorius&#x27;s court. It was led by Stilicho&#x27;s own creature, one Olympius.

== 408–410: end of effective regular field armies, starvation in Italy, sack of Rome ==
=== Stilicho&#x27;s fall and Alaric&#x27;s reaction ===
Stilicho had news of the coup at Bononia, where he was probably waiting for Alaric. His army of barbarian troops, including a guard of Huns and many Goths under Sarus, discussed attacking the forces of the coup, but Stilicho prevented them when he heard that the Emperor had not been harmed. Sarus&#x27;s Gothic troops then massacred the Hun contingent in their sleep, and Stilicho withdrew from the quarreling remains of his army to Ravenna. He ordered that his former soldiers should not be admitted into the cities in which their families were billeted. Stilicho was forced to flee to a church for sanctuary, promised his life, and killed.

Alaric was again declared an enemy of the Emperor. The conspiracy then massacred the families of the federate troops (as presumed supporters of Stilicho, although they had probably rebelled against him), and the troops defected &quot;en masse&quot; to Alaric. The conspirators seem to have let their main army disintegrate, and had no policy except hunting down anyone they regarded as supporters of Stilicho. Italy was left without effective indigenous defence forces thereafter. Heraclianus, a co-conspirator of Olympius, became governor of the Diocese of Africa. He consequently controlled the source of most of Italy&#x27;s grain, and he supplied food only in the interests of Honorius&#x27;s regime.

As a declared &#x27;enemy of the Emperor&#x27;, Alaric was denied the legitimacy that he needed to collect taxes and hold cities without large garrisons, which he could not afford to detach. He again offered to move his men, this time to Pannonia, in exchange for a modest sum of money and the modest title of Comes. He was refused, as Olympius&#x27;s clique still regarded him as a supporter of Stilicho. He moved into Italy, probably using the route and supplies arranged for him by Stilicho, bypassing the imperial court in Ravenna which was protected by widespread marshland and had a port, and he menaced the city of Rome itself. In 407, there was no equivalent of the determined response to the catastrophic Battle of Cannae in 216 BCE, when the entire Roman population, even slaves, had been mobilized to resist the enemy.

Alaric&#x27;s military operations centred on the port of Rome, through which Rome&#x27;s grain supply had to pass. Alaric&#x27;s first siege of Rome in 408 caused dreadful famine within the walls. It was ended by a payment that, though large, was less than one of the richest senators could have produced. The super-rich aristocrats made little contribution; pagan temples were stripped of ornaments to make up the total. With promises of freedom, Alaric also recruited many of the slaves in Rome.

Alaric withdrew to Tuscany and recruited more slaves. Athaulf, a Goth nominally in Roman service and brother-in-law to Alaric, marched through Italy to join Alaric. A small force of Hunnic mercenaries led by Olympius killed some of Athaulf&#x27;s men on this journey. Sarus was an enemy of Athaulf, and on Athaulf&#x27;s arrival went back into imperial service.

=== Alaric besieges Rome ===
In 409 Olympius fell to further intrigue, having his ears cut off before he was beaten to death. Alaric tried again to negotiate with Honorius, but his demands (now even more moderate, only frontier land and food) were inflated by the messenger and Honorius responded with insults, which were reported &quot;verbatim&quot; to Alaric. He broke off negotiations and the standoff continued. Honorius&#x27;s court made overtures to the usurper Constantine III in Gaul and arranged to bring Hunnic forces into Italy, Alaric ravaged Italy outside the fortified cities (which he could not garrison), and the Romans refused open battle (for which they had inadequate forces). Late in the year, Alaric sent bishops to express his readiness to leave Italy if Honorius would only grant his people a supply of grain. Honorius, sensing weakness, flatly refused.

Alaric moved to Rome and captured Galla Placidia, sister of Honorius. The Senate in Rome, despite its loathing for Alaric, was now desperate enough to give him almost anything he wanted. They had no food to offer, but they tried to give him imperial legitimacy; with the Senate&#x27;s acquiescence, he elevated Priscus Attalus as his puppet emperor, and he marched on Ravenna. Honorius was planning to flee to Constantinople when a reinforcing army of 4,000 soldiers from the East disembarked in Ravenna. These garrisoned the walls and Honorius held on. He had Constantine&#x27;s principal court supporter executed and Constantine abandoned plans to march to Honorius&#x27;s defence. Attalus failed to establish his control over the Diocese of Africa, and no grain arrived in Rome where the famine became even more frightful. Jerome reports cannibalism within the walls. Attalus brought Alaric no real advantage, failing also to come to any useful agreement with Honorius (to whom Attalus offered mutilation, humiliation, and exile). Indeed, Attalus&#x27;s claim was a marker of threat to Honorius, and Alaric dethroned him after a few months.

In 410 Alaric took Rome by starvation, and sacked it for three days. He invited its remaining barbarian slaves to join him, which many did. There was relatively little destruction. In some Christian holy places, Alaric&#x27;s men even refrained from wanton violence, and Jerome tells the story of a virgin who was escorted to a church by the invaders, after they had given her mother a beating from which she later died. The city of Rome was the seat of the richest senatorial noble families and the centre of their cultural patronage. To pagans it was the sacred origin of the empire, and to Christians the seat of the heir of Saint Peter. At the time, this position was held by Pope Innocent I, the most authoritative bishop of the West. Rome had not fallen to an enemy since the Battle of the Allia, over eight centuries before. Refugees spread the news and their stories throughout the Empire, and the meaning of the fall was debated with religious fervour. Both Christians and pagans wrote embittered tracts, blaming paganism or Christianity respectively for the loss of Rome&#x27;s supernatural protection and all attacking Stilicho&#x27;s earthly failures. Some Christian responses anticipated the imminence of the Last Judgment. Augustine of Hippo in his book &quot;City of God&quot; ultimately rejected the pagan and Christian idea that religion should have worldly benefits. He instead developed the doctrine that the City of God in heaven, undamaged by mundane disasters, was the true objective of Christians. More practically, Honorius was briefly persuaded to set aside the laws forbidding pagans to be military officers, so that one Generidus could re-establish Roman control in Dalmatia. Generidus did this with unusual effectiveness. His techniques were remarkable for this period, in that they included training his troops, disciplining them, and giving them appropriate supplies even if he had to use his own money. The penal laws were reinstated no later than 25 August 410, meaning that the overall trend of repression of paganism continued.
Procopius mentions a story in which Honorius, on hearing the news that Rome had &quot;perished&quot;, was shocked. The emperor thought that the news was in reference to his favorite chicken, which he had named &quot;Roma&quot;. On hearing that Rome itself had fallen, he breathed a sigh of relief:

=== The Goths move out of Italy ===
Alaric then moved south, intending to sail to Africa. His ships were wrecked in a storm, and he shortly died of fever. His successor Athaulf, still regarded as an usurper and given only occasional and short-term grants of supplies, moved north into the turmoil of Gaul. In this region, there was some prospect of food. His supergroup of barbarians are called the Visigoths in modern works: they may now have been developing their own sense of identity.

== 405–418: In the Gallic provinces; barbarians and usurpers, loss of Britannia, partial loss of Hispania and Gaul ==
The Crossing of the Rhine in 405/6 brought unmanageable numbers of Germanic and Alan barbarians (perhaps some 30,000 warriors, 100,000 people) into Gaul. They may have been trying to get away from the Huns, who about this time advanced to occupy the Great Hungarian Plain. For the next few years these barbarian tribes wandered in search of food and employment, while Roman forces fought each other in the name of Honorius and a number of competing claimants to the imperial throne.

The remaining troops in Britannia elevated a succession of imperial usurpers. The last, Constantine III, raised an army from the remaining troops in Britannia, invaded Gaul and defeated forces loyal to Honorius led by Sarus. Constantine&#x27;s power reached its peak in 409 when he controlled Gaul and beyond, he was joint consul with Honorius and his magister militum Gerontius defeated the last Roman force to try to hold the borders of Hispania. It was led by relatives of Honorius; Constantine executed them. Gerontius went to Hispania, where he may have settled the Sueves and the Asding Vandals. Gerontius then fell out with his master and elevated one Maximus as his own puppet emperor. He defeated Constantine and was besieging him in Arelate when Honorius&#x27;s general Constantius arrived from Italy with an army (possibly, composed mainly of Hun mercenaries). Gerontius&#x27;s troops deserted him, and he committed suicide. Constantius continued the siege, defeating a relieving army. Constantine surrendered in 411 with a promise that his life would be spared, and was then executed.

In 410, the Roman civitates of Britannia rebelled against Constantine and evicted his officials. They asked for help from Honorius, who replied that they should look to their own defence. While the British may have regarded themselves as Roman for several generations, and British armies may at times have fought in Gaul, no central Roman government is known to have appointed officials in Britannia thereafter. The supply of coinage to the Diocese of Britannia ceases with Honorius.

In 411, Jovinus rebelled and took over Constantine&#x27;s remaining troops on the Rhine. He relied on the support of Burgundians and Alans, to whom he offered supplies and land. In 413, Jovinus also recruited Sarus. Athaulf destroyed their regime in the name of Honorius, afterwards both Jovinus and Sarus were executed. The Burgundians were settled on the left bank of the Rhine. Athaulf then operated in the south of Gaul, sometimes with short-term supplies from the Romans. All usurpers had been defeated, but large barbarian groups remained un-subdued in both Gaul and Hispania. The imperial government was quick to restore the Rhine frontier. The invading tribes of 407 moved into Hispania at the end of 409; the Visigoths left Italy at the beginning of 412 and settled themselves around Narbo.

Heraclianus was still in command in the diocese of Africa. He was the last member of the clique which had overthrown Stilicho to retain power. In 413 he revolted and led an invasion of Italy, and lost to a subordinate of Constantius. He then fled back to Africa, where he was murdered by Constantius&#x27;s agents.

In January 414 Roman naval forces blockaded Athaulf in Narbo, where he married Galla Placidia. The choir at the wedding included Attalus, a puppet emperor without revenues or soldiers. Athaulf famously declared that he had abandoned his intention to set up a Gothic empire, because of the irredeemable barbarity of his followers, and instead he sought to restore the Roman Empire. He handed Attalus over to Honorius&#x27;s regime for mutilation, humiliation, and exile. He also abandoned Attalus&#x27;s supporters. One of them, Paulinus Pellaeus, recorded that the Goths considered themselves merciful because they allowed him and his household to leave destitute, but alive, without being raped. Athaulf moved out of Gaul, to Barcelona where his infant son by Galla Placidia was buried, and where he was assassinated by one of his household retainers, possibly a former follower of Sarus. His ultimate successor Wallia had no agreement with the Romans; his people had to plunder in Hispania for food.

=== Settlement of 418; barbarians within the empire ===
In 416 Wallia reached agreement with Constantius; he sent Galla Placidia back to Honorius and received provisions, six hundred thousand &quot;modii&quot; of wheat. From 416 to 418, 
Wallia&#x27;s Goths campaigned in Hispania on Constantius&#x27;s behalf, exterminating the Siling Vandals in Baetica and reducing the Alans to the point where the survivors sought the protection of the king of the Asding Vandals. (After retrenchment they formed another barbarian supergroup, but for the moment they were reduced in numbers and effectively cowed.) In 418, by agreement with Constantius, Wallia&#x27;s Goths accepted land to farm in Aquitania. Constantius also reinstituted an annual council of the southern Gallic provinces, to meet at Arelate. Although Constantius rebuilt the western field army to some extent, he did so only by replacing half of its units (vanished in the wars since 395) by re-graded barbarians, and by garrison troops removed from the frontier. The gives a list of the units of the western field army . It does not give strengths for these units, but A. H. M. Jones used the Notitia to estimate the total strength of the field armies in the West at 113,000 : Gaul, &quot;about&quot; 35,000; Italy, &quot;nearly&quot; 30,000; Britain 3,000; in Spain, 10–11,000, in the diocese of Illyricum 13–14,000, and in the diocese of Africa 23,000.

Constantius had married the princess Galla Placidia (despite her protests) in 417. The couple soon had two children, Honoria and Valentinian III. Constantius was elevated to the position of Augustus in 420. This earned him the hostility of the Eastern court, which had not agreed to his elevation. Nevertheless, Constantius had achieved an unassailable position at the Western court, in the imperial family, and as the able commander-in-chief of a partially restored army.

This settlement represented a real success for the Empire – a poem by Rutilius Namatianus celebrates his voyage back to Gaul in 417 and his confidence in a restoration of prosperity. But it marked huge losses of territory and of revenue; Rutilius travelled by ship past the ruined bridges and countryside of Tuscany, and in the west the river Loire had become the effective northern boundary of Roman Gaul. In the east of Gaul the Franks controlled large areas; the effective line of Roman control until 455 ran from north of Cologne (lost to the Ripuarian Franks in 459) to Boulogne. The Italian areas which had been compelled to support the Goths had most of their taxes remitted for several years. Even in southern Gaul and Hispania large barbarian groups remained, with thousands of warriors, in their own non-Roman military and social systems. Some occasionally acknowledged a degree of Roman political control, but without the local application of Roman leadership and military power they and their individual subgroups pursued their own interests.

== 421–433: Renewed dissension after the death of Constantius, partial loss of the Diocese of Africa ==
Constantius died in 421, after only seven months as Augustus. He had been careful to make sure that there was no successor in waiting, and his own children were far too young to take his place. Honorius was unable to control his own court, and the death of Constantius initiated more than ten years of instability. Initially Galla Placidia sought Honorius&#x27;s favour in the hope that her son might ultimately inherit. Other court interests managed to defeat her, and she fled with her children to the Eastern court in 422. Honorius himself died, shortly before his thirty-ninth birthday, in 423. After some months of intrigue, the patrician Castinus installed Joannes as Western Emperor, but the Eastern Roman government proclaimed the child Valentinian III instead, his mother Galla Placidia acting as regent during his minority. Joannes had few troops of his own. He sent Aetius to raise help from the Huns. An Eastern army landed in Italy, captured Joannes, cut his hand off, abused him in public, and killed him with most of his senior officials. Aetius returned, three days after Joannes&#x27; death, at the head of a substantial Hunnic army which made him the most powerful general in Italy. After some fighting, Placidia and Aetius came to an agreement; the Huns were paid off and sent home, while Aetius received the position of .

Galla Placidia, as Augusta, mother of the Emperor, and his guardian until 437, could maintain a dominant position in court, but women in Ancient Rome did not exercise military power, and she could not herself become a general. She tried for some years to avoid reliance on a single dominant military figure, maintaining a balance of power between her three senior officers, Aetius ( in Gaul), Count Boniface (governor in the Diocese of Africa), and Flavius Felix (&quot;magister militum praesentalis&quot; in Italy). Meanwhile, the Empire deteriorated seriously. Apart from the losses in the Diocese of Africa, Hispania was slipping out of central control and into the hands of local rulers and Suevic bandits. In Gaul the Rhine frontier had collapsed, the Visigoths in Aquitaine may have launched further attacks on Narbo and Arelate, and the Franks, increasingly powerful although disunited, were the major power in the north-east. Armorica was controlled by Bagaudae, local leaders not under the authority of the Empire. Aetius at least campaigned vigorously and mostly victoriously, defeating aggressive Visigoths, Franks, fresh Germanic invaders, Bagaudae in Armorica, and a rebellion in Noricum. Not for the first time in Rome&#x27;s history, a triumvirate of mutually distrustful rulers proved unstable. In 427, Felix tried to recall Boniface from Africa. Boniface refused, and overcame Felix&#x27;s invading force. Boniface probably recruited some Vandal troops among others.

In 428 the Vandals and Alans were united under the able, ferocious, and long-lived king Genseric; he moved his entire people to Tarifa near Gibraltar, divided them into 80 groups nominally of 1,000 people (perhaps 20,000 warriors in total), and crossed from Hispania to Mauretania without opposition. They spent a year moving slowly to Numidia, defeating Boniface. He returned to Italy where Aetius had recently had Felix executed. Boniface was promoted to and earned the enmity of Aetius, who may have been absent in Gaul at the time. In 432 the two met at the Battle of Ravenna, which left Aetius&#x27;s forces defeated and Boniface mortally wounded. Aetius temporarily retired to his estates, but after an attempt to murder him he raised another Hunnic army (probably by conceding parts of Pannonia to them) and in 433 he returned to Italy, overcoming all rivals. He never threatened to become an Augustus himself and thus maintained the support of the Eastern court, where Valentinian&#x27;s cousin Theodosius II reigned until 450.

== 433–454: ascendancy of Aetius, loss of Carthage ==
Aetius campaigned vigorously, somewhat stabilizing the situation in Gaul and in Hispania. He relied heavily on his forces of Huns. With a ferocity celebrated centuries later in the , the Huns slaughtered many Burgundiones on the middle Rhine, re-establishing the survivors as Roman allies, the first Kingdom of the Burgundians. This may have returned some sort of Roman authority to Trier. Eastern troops reinforced Carthage, temporarily halting the Vandals, who in 435 agreed to limit themselves to Numidia and leave the most fertile parts of North Africa in peace. Aetius concentrated his limited military resources to defeat the Visigoths again, and his diplomacy restored a degree of order to Hispania. However, his general Litorius was badly defeated by the Visigoths at Toulouse, and a new Suevic king, Rechiar, began vigorous assaults on what remained of Roman Hispania. At one point Rechiar even allied with Bagaudae. These were Romans not under imperial control; some of their reasons for rebellion may be indicated by the remarks of a Roman captive under Attila who was happy in his lot, giving a lively account of 

Vegetius&#x27;s advice on re-forming an effective army may be dated to the early 430s, (though a date in the 390s has also been suggested). He identified many deficiencies in the military, especially mentioning that the soldiers were no longer properly equipped:

A religious polemic of about this time complains bitterly of the oppression and extortion suffered by all but the richest Romans. Many wished to flee to the Bagaudae or even to foul-smelling barbarians. 

Gildas, a 6th-century monk and author of , wrote that Nevertheless, effective imperial protection from barbarian ravages was eagerly sought. About this time authorities in Britannia asked Aetius for help: 

The Visigoths passed another waymark on their journey to full independence; they made their own foreign policy, sending princesses to make (rather unsuccessful) marriage alliances with Rechiar of the Sueves and with Huneric, son of the Vandal king Genseric.

In 439, the Vandals moved eastward, temporarily abandoning Numidia. They captured Carthage, where they established the Vandal Kingdom, an independent state with a powerful navy. This brought immediate financial crisis to the Western Empire. The diocese of Africa was prosperous, normally required few troops to keep it secure, contributed large tax revenues, and exported wheat to feed Rome and many other areas. Roman troops assembled in Sicily, but the planned counter-attack never happened. Huns attacked the Eastern empire, and Attila&#x27;s invasions of the East were stopped by the Theodosian Walls; at this heavily fortified Eastern end of the Mediterranean there were no significant barbarian invasions across the sea into the rich southerly areas of Anatolia, the Levant, and Egypt. Despite internal and external threats, and more religious discord than the West, these provinces remained prosperous contributors to tax revenue; despite the ravages of Attila&#x27;s armies and the extortions of his peace treaties, tax revenue generally continued to be adequate for the essential state functions of the Eastern empire.

Genseric settled his Vandals as landowners. In 442, he was able to negotiate very favourable peace terms with the Western court. He kept his latest gains and his eldest son Huneric was honoured by betrothal to Valentinian III&#x27;s daughter Eudocia. She carried the legitimacy of the conjoined Valentinianic and Theodosian dynasties. Huneric&#x27;s Gothic wife was suspected of trying to poison her father-in-law Genseric; he sent her home without her nose or ears, and his Gothic alliance came to an early end. The Romans regained Numidia, and Rome again received a grain supply from Africa.

The losses of income from the Diocese of Africa were equivalent to the costs of nearly 40,000 infantry or over 20,000 cavalry. The imperial regime had to increase taxes. Despite admitting that the peasantry could pay no more, and that a sufficient army could not be raised, the imperial regime protected the interests of landowners displaced from Africa and allowed wealthy individuals to avoid taxes.

=== 444–453: attacks by the empire of Attila the Hun ===
In 444, the Huns were united under Attila. His subjects included Huns, outnumbered several times over by other groups, predominantly Germanic peoples. His power rested partly on his continued ability to reward his favoured followers with precious metals, and he continued to attack the Eastern Empire until 450, by when he had extracted vast sums of money and many other concessions.

Attila may not have needed any excuse to turn West, but he received one in the form of a plea for help from Honoria, the Emperor&#x27;s sister, who was being forced into a marriage which she resented. Attila claimed Honoria as his wife, and half of the Western Empire&#x27;s territory as his dowry. Faced with refusal, he invaded Gaul in 451 with a huge army. In the bloody battle of the Catalaunian Plains, the invasion was stopped by the combined forces of the barbarians within the Western empire. They were coordinated by Aetius, and supported by what troops he could muster. The next year, Attila invaded Italy and proceeded to march upon Rome. An outbreak of disease in his army, lack of supplies, reports that Eastern Roman troops were attacking his noncombatant population in Pannonia, and, possibly, Pope Leo I&#x27;s plea for peace induced him to halt this campaign. Attila unexpectedly died a year later (453) and his empire crumbled as his followers fought for power. The life of Severinus of Noricum gives glimpses of the general insecurity, and ultimate retreat of the Romans on the Upper Danube in the aftermath of Attila&#x27;s death. The Romans were without adequate forces; the barbarians inflicted haphazard extortion, murder, kidnap, and plunder on the Romans and on each other. 

In 454, Aetius was personally stabbed to death by Valentinian. Valentinian himself was murdered by the dead general&#x27;s supporters a year later. A rich senatorial aristocrat, Petronius Maximus, who had encouraged both murders, then seized the throne. He broke the engagement between the princess Eudocia and Huneric, heir to the Vandal throne. This amounted to a declaration of war with the Vandals. Petronius had time to send Avitus to ask for the help of the Visigoths in Gaul before a Vandal fleet arrived in Italy. Petronius was unable to muster any effective defence, tried to flee the city, and was torn to pieces by a mob who paraded the bits around on a pole. The Vandals entered Rome, and plundered it for two weeks. Despite the shortage of money for the defence of the state, considerable private wealth had accumulated since the previous sack in 410. The Vandals sailed away with large amounts of treasure and also with the princess Eudocia. She became the wife of one Vandal king and the mother of another, Hilderic.

The Vandals conquered Sicily. Their fleet became a constant danger to Roman sea trade, and to the coasts and islands of the western Mediterranean.

== 455–456: failure of Avitus, further losses in Gaul, rise of Ricimer ==
Avitus, at the Visigothic court in Burdigala, declared himself Emperor. He moved on Rome with Visigothic support. He gained acceptance by Majorian and Ricimer, commanders of the remaining army of Italy. This was the first time that a barbarian kingdom had played a key role in the imperial succession. Avitus&#x27;s son-in-law Sidonius Apollinaris wrote propaganda to present the Visigothic king Theoderic II as a reasonable man with whom a Roman regime could do business. Theoderic&#x27;s payoff included precious metal from stripping the remaining public ornaments of Italy, and an unsupervised campaign in Hispania. There he not only defeated the Sueves, executing his brother-in-law Rechiar, but he also plundered Roman cities. The Burgundians expanded their kingdom in the Rhône valley, while the Vandals took the remains of the Diocese of Africa. In 456, the Visigothic army was too heavily engaged in Hispania to be an effective threat to Italy. Ricimer had just destroyed a pirate fleet of sixty Vandal ships. Majorian and Ricimer marched against Avitus, and defeated him near Placentia. He was forced to become Bishop of Placentia, and died (possibly murdered) a few weeks later.

== 457–467: resurgence under Majorian, attempt to recover Africa, control by Ricimer ==
Majorian and Ricimer were now in control of Italy. Ricimer was the son of a Suevic king, and his mother was the daughter of a Gothic one, so he could not aspire to an imperial throne. After some months, allowing for negotiation with the new emperor of Constantinople and the defeat of 900 Alamannic invaders of Italy by one of his subordinates, Majorian was acclaimed as Augustus.

Majorian is described by Gibbon as . He rebuilt the army and navy of Italy with vigour and set about recovering the remaining Gallic provinces, which had not recognized his elevation. He defeated the Visigoths at the Battle of Arelate, reducing them to federate status and obliging them to give up their claims in Hispania; he moved on to subdue the Burgundians, the Gallo-Romans around Lugdunum (who were granted tax concessions and whose senior officials were appointed from their own ranks), and the Suevi and Bagaudae in Hispania. Marcellinus, magister militum in Dalmatia and the pagan general of a well-equipped army, acknowledged him as emperor and recovered Sicily from the Vandals. Aegidius also acknowledged Majorian and took effective charge of northern Gaul. (Aegidius may also have used the title &quot;King of the Franks&quot;). Abuses in tax collection were reformed and the city councils were strengthened. Both were actions necessary to rebuild the strength of the Empire, but disadvantageous to the richest aristocrats. Majorian prepared a fleet at Carthago Nova for the essential reconquest of the Diocese of Africa.

The fleet was burned by traitors, and Majorian made peace with the Vandals and returned to Italy. Here Ricimer met him, arrested him, and executed him five days later. Marcellinus in Dalmatia and Aegidius around Soissons in northern Gaul rejected both Ricimer and his puppets and maintained some version of Roman rule in their areas. Ricimer later ceded Narbo and its hinterland to the Visigoths in exchange for their help against Aegidius; this made it impossible for Roman armies to march from Italy to Hispania. Ricimer was then the effective ruler of Italy (but little else) for several years. From 461 to 465 the pious Italian aristocrat Libius Severus reigned. There is no record of anything significant that he even tried to achieve, he was never acknowledged by the East whose help Ricimer needed, and he died conveniently in 465.

== 467–472: Anthemius; an emperor and an army from the East ==
After two years without a Western emperor, the Eastern court nominated Anthemius, a successful general who had a strong claim to the Eastern throne. He arrived in Italy with an army, supported by Marcellinus and his fleet. Anthemius married his daughter Alypia to Ricimer, and he was proclaimed Augustus in 467. In 468, at vast expense, the Eastern empire assembled an enormous force to help the West retake the Diocese of Africa. Marcellinus rapidly drove the Vandals from Sardinia and Sicily, and a land invasion evicted them from Tripolitania. The commander in chief with the main force defeated a Vandal fleet near Sicily, and landed at Cape Bon. Here Genseric offered to surrender, if he could have a five-day truce to prepare the process. He used the respite to prepare a full-scale attack preceded by fireships, which destroyed most of the Roman fleet and killed many of its soldiers. The Vandals were confirmed in their possession of the Diocese of Africa. They soon retook Sardinia and Sicily. Marcellinus was murdered, possibly on orders from Ricimer. The Praetorian prefect of Gaul, Arvandus, tried to persuade Euric the new king of the Visigoths to rebel, on the grounds that Roman power in Gaul was finished anyway; the king refused.

Anthemius was still in command of an army in Italy. Additionally, in northern Gaul, a British army led by one Riothamus, operated in imperial interests at the battle of Déols. Anthemius sent his son Anthemiolus over the Alps, with an army, to request the Visigoths to return southern Gaul to Roman control. This would have allowed the Empire land access to Hispania again. The Visigoths refused, and defeated the forces of both Riothamus and Anthemius at the battle of Arles; with the Burgundians, they took over almost all of the remaining imperial territory in southern Gaul.

Ricimer then quarreled with Anthemius, and besieged him in Rome, which surrendered in July 472, after more months of starvation. Anthemius was captured and executed (on Ricimer&#x27;s orders) by the Burgundian prince Gundobad. In August, Ricimer died of a pulmonary haemorrhage. Olybrius, his new emperor, named Gundobad as his patrician, then shortly died himself.

== 472–476: final emperors, puppets of the warlords ==
After the death of Olybrius there was a further interregnum until March 473, when Gundobad proclaimed Glycerius emperor. He may have made some attempt to intervene in Gaul; if so, it was unsuccessful. In 474 Julius Nepos, nephew and successor of the general Marcellinus, arrived in Rome with soldiers and authority from the eastern emperor Leo I. By that time, Gundobad had left to contest the Burgundian throne in Gaul. Glycerius gave up without a fight, retiring to become bishop of Salona in Dalmatia. Julius Nepos ruled Italy and Dalmatia from Ravenna, and appointed Orestes, a former secretary of Attila, as magister militum.

In 475, Orestes promised land in Italy to various Germanic mercenaries, Heruli, Scirian and Torcilingi, in exchange for their support. He drove Julius Nepos out of Ravenna and proclaimed his own son Flavius Momyllus Romulus Augustus (Romulus Augustulus) as Emperor, on October 31. His surname &#x27;Augustus&#x27; was given the diminutive form &#x27;Augustulus&#x27; by rivals, because he was still a minor. Romulus was never recognized outside Italy as a legitimate ruler.

In 476, Orestes refused to honour his promises of land to his mercenaries, who revolted under the leadership of Odoacer. Orestes fled to the city of Pavia on August 23, 476, where the city&#x27;s bishop gave him sanctuary. Orestes was soon forced to flee Pavia, when Odoacer&#x27;s army broke through the city walls and ravaged the city. Odoacer&#x27;s army chased Orestes to Piacenza, where they captured and executed him on August 28, 476.

On September 4, 476, Odoacer forced Romulus Augustulus, whom his father Orestes had proclaimed to be Rome&#x27;s Emperor, to abdicate. The &quot;Anonymus Valesianus&quot; wrote that Odoacer, &quot;taking pity on his youth&quot; (he was then 16 years old), spared Romulus&#x27; life and granted him an annual pension of 6,000 solidi before sending him to live with relatives in Campania. Odoacer installed himself as ruler over Italy, and sent the Imperial insignia to Constantinople.

== From 476: last emperor, rump states ==
By convention, the Western Roman Empire is deemed to have ended on 4 September 476, when Odoacer deposed Romulus Augustulus and proclaimed himself ruler of Italy. This convention is subject to many qualifications. In Roman constitutional theory, the Empire was still simply united under one emperor, implying no abandonment of territorial claims. In areas where the convulsions of the dying Empire had made organized self-defence legitimate, rump states continued under some form of Roman rule after 476. Julius Nepos still claimed to be Emperor of the West, and controlled Dalmatia until his murder in 480. Syagrius son of Aegidius ruled the Domain of Soissons until his murder in 486. The indigenous inhabitants of Mauretania developed kingdoms of their own, independent of the Vandals, and with strong Roman traits. They again sought imperial recognition with the reconquests of Justinian I, and they later put up effective resistance to the Muslim conquest of the Maghreb. The civitates of Britannia continued to look to their own defence as Honorius had authorized; they maintained literacy in Latin and other identifiably Roman traits for some time although they sank to a level of material development inferior even to their pre-Roman Iron Age ancestors.

Odoacer began to negotiate with the East Roman (Byzantine) emperor Zeno, who was busy dealing with unrest in the East. Zeno eventually granted Odoacer the status of patrician and accepted him as his own viceroy of Italy. Zeno, however, insisted that Odoacer had to pay homage to Julius Nepos as the Emperor of the Western Empire. Odoacer never returned any territory or real power, but he did issue coins in the name of Julius Nepos throughout Italy. The murder of Julius Nepos in 480 (Glycerius may have been among the conspirators) prompted Odoacer to invade Dalmatia, annexing it to his Kingdom of Italy. In 488 the Eastern emperor authorized a troublesome Goth, Theoderic (later known as &quot;the Great&quot;) to take Italy. After several indecisive campaigns, in 493 Theoderic and Odoacer agreed to rule jointly. They celebrated their agreement with a banquet of reconciliation, at which Theoderic&#x27;s men murdered Odoacer&#x27;s, and Theoderic personally cut Odoacer in half.

The mostly powerless, but still influential Western Roman Senate continued to exist in the city of Rome under the rule of the Ostrogothic kingdom and, later, the Byzantine Empire for at least another century, before disappearing at an unknown date in the early 7th century.

== Legacy ==
The Roman Empire was not only a political unity enforced by the use of military power; it was also the combined and elaborated civilization of the Mediterranean Basin and beyond. It included manufacture, trade, and architecture, widespread secular literacy, written law, and an international language of science and literature. The Western barbarians lost much of these higher cultural practices, but their redevelopment in the Middle Ages by polities aware of the Roman achievement formed the basis for the later development of Europe.

Observing the cultural and archaeological continuities through and beyond the period of lost political control, the process has been described as a complex cultural transformation, rather than a fall.

<text>Marcel Caux (1 March 1899 – 22 August 2004), born Harold Katte, was an Australian First World War veteran and the last known survivor of the Battle of Pozières.

== Military service ==
Lying about his age, he enlisted on 6 September 1915, aged 16, and on 20 January 1916 embarked for France aboard HMAT &quot;Runic&quot; with the 9th Reinforcements of the 17th Battalion, Australian 2nd Division. He was transferred to the 20th Battalion with which he fought in the Battle of the Somme. He was wounded in the left ankle during the Battle of Pozières in 1916. He was absent without leave on two occasions. He was wounded twice more, eventually being hurt so badly in 1918 that he was unable to bend his left leg for the rest of his life. He returned to Australia on 16 March 1919.

After the war he was refused an invalid pension, because the physician insisted that if he could stand up, he did not need one. Disillusioned with the army over this experience, he tore up all of his army photographs, moved into the Australian bush and became a carpenter. He claimed until 1998 that he had been wounded in the Second World War, refusing to acknowledge his service during the First World War. He married Doris and they had one son named Marcus, but never told them about his past.

== Honours ==
His secret was discovered in 1998, when he was made a &quot;Chevalier&quot; (Knight) of the &quot;Légion d&#x27;Honneur&quot; by the French government. After this he was able to come to terms with his past and began attending Anzac Day ceremonies.

The centenarian Caux spent his final days in a nursing home in Chatswood, a suburb of Sydney. He remained opposed until he died to Australian involvement in foreign wars, in particular the 2003 invasion of Iraq. He died peacefully in his sleep.

In 2007, it was revealed that Marcel had led a complex and deceptive life. Allegations were made that he deserted his first wife, then married again without a proper divorce.

== Death ==
Following Caux&#x27;s death there were only four surviving Australian veterans of the First World War.

== Honours and awards ==
* British War Medal
* Victory Medal
* 80th Anniversary Armistice Remembrance Medal (awarded on 21 April 1999)
* Centenary Medal (awarded on 1 January 2002)
* &quot;Chevalier&quot; (Knight) of the Légion d&#x27;honneur (awarded on 4 July 1998)

<text>Fejér (, ) is an administrative county in central Hungary. It lies on the west bank of the river Danube and nearly touches the eastern shore of Lake Balaton. It shares borders with the Hungarian counties Veszprém, Komárom-Esztergom County, Pest, Bács-Kiskun County, Tolna and Somogy. The capital of Fejér county is Székesfehérvár.

==Geography==
Geographically, Fejér County is very diverse; its southern part is similar (and adjacent) to the Great Hungarian Plain, and other parts are hilly (Bakony, Vértes, Gerecse mountains). Lake Velence, a popular resort, is also located within the county.

==History==

===Early history===
The area was already inhabited 20,000 years ago. When this part of Hungary formed a Roman province called &quot;Pannonia&quot;, several settlements stood here: the capital was Gorsium, but there were other significant towns too, where present-day Baracs and Dunaújváros are (the towns were called &quot;Annamatia&quot; and &quot;Intercisa&quot;, respectively). In the early medieval period Huns and Avars lived in the area. After 586 several nomadic people inhabited in the area, until Hungarians conquered it in the late 9th century.

===From the Roman conquest until the Ottoman occupation===

Hungarians arrived in the area between 895 and 900. The high prince and his tribe settled down in this area. The town of &quot;Fehérvár&quot; (modern-day Székesfehérvár) became significant as the seat of Prince Géza. Under the reign of his son, King Stephen, the town became the county seat of the newly formed county. Kings of Hungary were crowned and buried in the town until the 16th century.

====Fejér under Ottoman rule====
Fejér county was occupied by Ottomans between 1543 and 1688. Several of the villages were destroyed, the population dramatically decreased. After being freed from Ottoman rule, local administration was reorganized in 1692. Székesfehérvár got back its town status only in 1703.

<doc id="923414" wikidata="Q471830" url="?curid=923414" title="Johnny Chan">
<text>Johnny Chan (; (born 1957) is an American professional poker player. He has won 10 World Series of Poker bracelets, including the 1987 and 1988 World Series of Poker main events consecutively.

==Early life==
Chan moved with his family in 1962 from Guangzhou to Hong Kong, then in 1968 to Phoenix, Arizona, and later in 1973 to Houston, Texas, where his family owned restaurants. He started playing cards with the staff of the restaurant.

When he was 21, Chan dropped out of the University of Houston, where he was majoring in hotel and restaurant management, and moved to Las Vegas to become a professional gambler.

However, his first live casino experience was before his 21st birthday. During a visit in Las Vegas at the age of 16, Chan managed to buy in for a cash game, allegedly turning $500 into $20,000 in one night, before losing the whole $20,000 the next day.

==Poker tournaments==

===World Series of Poker===
Chan won his first WSOP bracelet in 1985 in a Limit Hold&#x27;em event. Chan won the World Series of Poker (WSOP) in 1987 and 1988 becoming the first foreign national to win the main event. A videotape of the 1988 WSOP final heads-up match is featured in the 1998 movie &quot;Rounders&quot;, in which Chan makes a cameo appearance. He almost won a third consecutive title, but finished as the runner-up in 1989 to Phil Hellmuth. He is the last player to win back-to-back WSOP Main Events.

Chan added bracelets with victories at the WSOP in 1994, 1997, 2000, and 2002.

In 2003, Chan won his eighth and ninth bracelets in Pot Limit Omaha and No Limit Hold&#x27;em events, both with a $5,000 buy-in.

In 2005, Chan became the first player to win ten World Series of Poker bracelets, defeating Phil Laak in a $2,500 Pot Limit Texas hold &#x27;em event. He is currently tied with Doyle Brunson, Erik Seidel, and Phil Ivey for second place with 10 World Series of Poker bracelets, behind Phil Hellmuth (17). He was inducted into the Poker Hall of Fame in 2002.

In 2008, Chan cashed for the first time in the Main Event since 1992, earning $32,166 for his 329th-place finish.

In 2010, Chan cashed in the Main Event taking 156th place for $57,102.

Chan&#x27;s last recorded cash dates back to 2019, when he had a fairly deep run in the WSOP Main Event, eventually busting in 560th place.

====World Series of Poker Bracelets====
===Poker Superstars===
Chan competed in the $400,000 Poker Superstars Invitational Tournament in February 2005. He came back from having $20,000 chips out of $3,200,000 in play to finish in second place to Gus Hansen. Chan later competed in Poker Superstars II during the summer of 2005. He defeated 22 players to make it to the finals. He defeated Todd Brunson in the finals after three matches to win the $400,000 first prize. Chan appeared in Poker Superstars III where he made it as far as the semi-finals but was defeated by Todd Brunson after three matches.

=== Poker After Dark ===
On NBC&#x27;s late-night show &quot;Poker After Dark&quot;, a six-person $20,000 buy-in winner-takes-all tournament, Johnny Chan has the most victories to date with four wins in six appearances. He came in second and fifth when he did not win.

His appearances in which he made it to heads-up were:

*WSOP Champions — originally aired January 15–20, 2007 — Won heads-up against Chris Moneymaker
*Champions Week — originally aired June 11–16, 2007 — Lost heads-up against Joe Hachem
*World Champions — originally aired February 11–16, 2008 — Won heads-up against Phil Hellmuth
*International — originally aired February 25 – March 1, 2008 — Won heads-up against Patrik Antonius
*Dream Table III — originally aired March 23–27, 2009 — Won heads-up against Jennifer Tilly

===Other tournaments===
Chan won Bob Stupak&#x27;s 1981 American Cup poker tournament. He defeated all 9 other players at the final table in less than an hour. As a result, Stupak gave Chan the nickname &quot;the Orient Express&quot;.

Chan won the $10,000 No Limit Hold&#x27;em tournament at the America&#x27;s Cup of Poker in consecutive years in 1982 and 1983.

Chan played in the 2004 and 2005 World Series of Poker Tournament of Champions events and the National Heads-Up Poker Championship in the same years.

As of 2023, his total live tournament winnings exceed $8,700,000. His 54 WSOP cashes account for $4,715,015 of those winnings.

== Personal life ==
In addition to playing poker, Chan owns a fast-food franchise in the Las Vegas Stratosphere Hotel and is a consultant for casinos and game makers. Chan has written for &quot;Card Player&quot; magazine. He appeared in the first (2006) and 2011 seasons of the GSN series &quot;High Stakes Poker&quot;.

In 2005, Chan collaborated with Mark Karowe to release &quot;Play Poker Like Johnny Chan&quot; (), an instructional book on several different types of poker. On November 28, 2006, the follow-up titled: &quot;Million Dollar Hold&#x27;em: Winning Big in Limit Cash Games&quot; (), which focuses on limit hold&#x27;em strategy, was released.

In 2007, Chan launched an online poker room, ChanPokerOnline.com. It closed in August 2008.

Chan is a former smoker who also does not drink alcohol.

Chan wrote a regular article in the bi-monthly magazine &quot;Trader Monthly&quot;.

===In popular culture===
Johnny Chan portrayed himself in the 1998 film &quot;Rounders&quot;. In a flashback scene, Chan is bluffed out of a pot by the main character Mike McDermott (Matt Damon).

He also appeared in the 2009 Hong Kong movie &quot;Poker King&quot; as himself.

<doc id="923416" wikidata="Q13644755" url="?curid=923416" title="List of spacewalks and moonwalks 1965–1999">
<text>This list contains all spacewalks and moonwalks performed from 1965 to 1999 where an astronaut has fully or partially left a spacecraft. Entries for moonwalks are shown with a gray background while entries for all other EVAs are uncolored.

All spacewalks have had the astronauts tethered to their spacecraft except for seven spacewalks by the United States (six in 1984 using the Manned Maneuvering Unit, and one in 1994 testing the SAFER rescue device). All moonwalks were performed with astronauts untethered, and some of the astronauts traveled far enough to lose visual contact with their craft (they were up to 7.6 km away from it using the Lunar Roving Vehicle). One lunar EVA was not a moonwalk, but rather a stand-up EVA partially out the top hatch of the LM, where it was thought that the extra height would help with surveying the area prior to conducting the moonwalks. Only three deep-space EVAs have ever been conducted, where the activity was neither on the lunar surface nor in low Earth orbit, but far away from both the Moon and the Earth.

==1965–1969 spacewalks and moonwalks==

He was able to control his movements and restrict his workload using techniques developed using underwater zero gravity simulations. Aldrin also benefited from the experiences of the previous American EVAs. Aldrin was able to move around the outside of the craft, deploy and recover various experimental packages, install and remove cameras, and practice work techniques using a ratchet-type wrench.

== Commemorative stamps==

The first spacewalk, that of the Soviet cosmonaut Alexei Leonov was commemorated in several Eastern Bloc stamps (see the stamps section in the Alexei Leonov article). Since the Soviet Union did not distribute diagrams or images of the Voskhod 2 spacecraft at the time, the spaceship depiction in the stamps was purely fictional. In 1967 the U.S. Post Office issued a pair of postage stamps commemorating the first American to float freely in space while orbiting the Earth. The engraved image has accurate depictions of the Gemini IV spacecraft and the space suit worn by astronaut Ed White.
Two Forever Stamps were issued in 2019 to commemorate the first spacewalk&#x27;s 50th anniversary. One features an iconic image of Buzz Aldrin performing an EVA, and the other an image of the Moon as viewed from Apollo 11 in space.

<text>Nicholas Close (died 1452) was an English priest.

Close is widely regarded as having been born in Westmorland, in Birkbeck Fells, but may have been of Flemish descent. He was educated at King&#x27;s College, Cambridge, being elected a fellow in 1443, one of the first six fellows on the foundation. He held the curacy of St John Zachary, a church demolished to make way for King&#x27;s College Chapel, the construction of which he was appointed overseer by Henry VI.

He served as a commissioner to Scotland in 1449. He was provided to the see of Carlisle in January 1450, and consecrated on 15 March 1450. On 19 March he was granted an indult from the King &quot;for life and as long as he is bishop of Carlisle, to visit his city and diocese by deputy (he being hindered so much by the service of Henry, king of England that he cannot conveniently do so in person).&quot;

Also in 1450 he was elected to the then annual position of Chancellor of the University of Cambridge. He was Bishop of Carlisle from 1450 to 1452, and was then translated to Bishop of Coventry and Lichfield on 30 August 1452, serving for a short time before his death in late October 1452.

<text>The 71st Infantry Division was a unit of the United States Army in World War II.

==World War II==
===Early history===

Being activated on 15 July 1943 at Camp Carson, Colorado, the division was first organized as the 71st Light Division (Pack, Jungle), intended for use in the mountainous jungle areas of the Pacific theater. Smaller than the standard 14,000-man infantry division, at about 9,000 personnel, its primary means of transport was hundreds of horses and mules controlled by several quartermaster pack companies of muleteers, and for artillery several battalions of 75 mm pack howitzers, instead of the standard M2A1 105 mm howitzer, which could be broken down into several loads and carried by mule train. 

The 5th and 14th Infantry Regiments, Regular Army units which had been stationed in the Panama Canal Zone for several years prior to the war and had received extensive training in jungle operations during that time, were assigned to the division to provide the nucleus of jungle expertise. The 66th Infantry Regiment was constituted in the Regular Army on 10 July 1943, and activated and assigned to the division on 15 July 1943 as its third regiment.

After training at Camp Carson, Colorado, the division was sent to Hunter Ligget Military Reservation in the mountains inland from Big Sur, California, where it maneuvered against the 89th Light Division as a test of the light division concept. As a result of the test, it was decided that the light divisions had insufficient manpower and firepower to be effective, and the concept was abandoned. The 71st Division was sent to Fort Benning, Georgia, where it was reorganized and retrained as a standard infantry division, although it remained unusual in having Regular Army infantry regiments assigned to a division raised in the Army of the United States.

===Combat chronicle===

The 71st Infantry Division departed United States on 26 January 1945, arriving at Le Havre, France, on 6 February 1945, and training at Camp Old Gold with headquarters at Limesy. The division moved east, relieved the 100th Infantry Division at Ratswiller and saw its first action on 11 March 1945. Their ouster of the Germans from France began on 15 March. The division moved through outer belts of the Siegfried Line, captured Pirmasens on 21 March, and crossed the Rhine at Oppenheim on 30 March. The 71st continued the advance, taking Coburg without resistance, cutting the Munich-Berlin autobahn on 13 April, and capturing Bayreuth after fierce opposition on 16 April. Moving south, the Division destroyed Schönfeld on 18 April, took Rosenberg, 
crossed the Naab River at Kallmünz on 24 April and the Danube to the east of Regensburg on the night of 25 April (the city fell on 27). Straubing was taken on 28 April. As resistance crumbled, the division crossed the Isar on 29 April and entered Austria on 2 May.

The division participated in the liberation of concentration camps including one in Austria called Gunskirchen Lager, a subcamp of Mauthausen, on 4 May. A pamphlet was produced by the US Army after they liberated the camp, called &quot;The Seventy-First came to Gunskirchen Lager.&quot; The book recounts in detail, and with graphic photos, the tragedy they found in the camp. The complete booklet is available for free on-line.

The 71st organized and occupied defensive positions along the Enns River and contacted Russian forces east of Linz, 8 May, the day before hostilities ceased, having gone further east than any other U.S. Army unit.

In January 1946, Colonel William Westmoreland was appointed commander, and was responsible for leading the units that had not yet been deactivated back to the United States so they could be demobilized. The division was assigned occupational duties until it left for home in March 1946, arriving on 10 and being inactivated on 12 at Camp Kilmer, New Jersey.

During the last several weeks of the war, the 761st Tank Battalion, an African-American unit, was attached to the 71st Division and fought with it. The 71st Division is also the formation in which Lt. John D. Eisenhower, General Dwight Eisenhower&#x27;s son, served.

==Post War==
In 1954 the 71st Infantry Division was reactivated in the northwest United States and Alaska as the division headquarters for several geographically separated units, to include the 53d Infantry Regiment headquartered at Fort Richardson, Alaska, with additional units stationed at Fort Greely, and the 4th and 5th Infantry regiments at Fort Lewis, Washington. The 723rd Tank Battalion was also withdrawn from the Army Reserve and activated at Camp Irwin and assigned to the 71st. In this status the division was known as a &quot;static division&quot; not capable of or intended for deployment. (A second &quot;static&quot; unit, the 23d Infantry Division, was activated in the Caribbean region.)

Units of the reactivated 71st Infantry Division included the following:
* Headquarters
* Headquarters Company
* Medical Detachment, Division HQ
* 71st Infantry Division Band
* 71st Military Police Company
* 771st Ordnance Battalion
* 71st Quartermaster Company
* 71st Replacement Company
* 71st Signal Company
* 71st Reconnaissance Company
* 723d Tank Battalion (120mm Gun)
* 371st Medical Battalion
* 271st Engineer Battalion (Combat)
* 4th Infantry Regiment
* 5th Infantry Regiment
* 53d Infantry Regiment
* Headquarters and Headquarters Battery, 71st Division Artillery
* Medical Detachment, 71st Division Artillery
* 555th Field Artillery Battalion (105mm Howitzer, Towed)

* 167th Antiaircraft Artillery Battalion (AW)(SP)
* 274th Armored Field Artillery Battalion (105mm Howitzer, SP)
* 607th Armored Field Artillery Battalion (105mm Howitzer, SP)

The division lasted in this status for less than two years, being inactivated at Fort Lewis on 15 September 1956.

<text>Homer E. &quot;Pete&quot; Abele (November 21, 1916 – May 12, 2000) was an American lawyer, jurist, and politician from the Republican Party. He was active in Ohio politics, and represented the state in the House of Representatives for one term from 1963 to 1965.

== Early life and education ==
Homer &quot;Pete&quot; Abele graduated from Wellston High School in his birthplace of Wellston, Ohio in 1934. From 1935 to 1936, he served in the Civilian Conservation Corps. From 1938 to 1941, he lived in Lancaster, Ohio and McArthur, Ohio, working for the Anchor Hocking Glass Corp. and the Austin Powder Co.

In 1948, he earned a degree in pre-law from Ohio University in Athens, Ohio. In 1953, he received a law degree from Ohio State University in Columbus, Ohio.

== Career ==
In 1941, Abele joined the Ohio State Highway Patrol and worked as a state trooper from 1941 to 1946, except for a stint in the Army Air Corps from 1943 to 1946.

In 1949, while still a student in law school, Abele was elected to the Ohio House of Representatives, where he served from 1949 to 1952. In 1952, Abele joined the unsuccessful presidential campaign of Robert A. Taft.

From 1953 to 1957, Abele was a lobbyist for railroad interests. In 1956, he was appointed solicitor of the village of McArthur, Ohio. In 1952, Abele attended the Republican National Convention. In 1956, he was a delegate to the convention. From 1954 to 1957, Abele was the chairman of the Vinton County, Ohio, Republican Executive Committee.

=== Congress ===
In 1958, Abele was the Republican nominee for U.S. Representative from Ohio&#x27;s 10th congressional district. He lost to incumbent Walter H. Moeller. Abele challenged Moeller again in 1962, and unseated him; he began his service in 1963 in the 88th United States Congress. Abele voted in favor of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. He served only one term and in 1964, Moeller won the seat back from Abele.

=== Judge ===
In 1966, Abele was elected to the office of judge of the Ohio Court of Appeals for the Fourth District. He was re-elected in 1972, 1978, and 1984. He retired at the end of his fourth term in 1991. During his tenure, he was presiding judge from 1977 to 1978 and from 1983 to 1984. In 1978, Abele was chief justice of the Ohio Court of Appeals. Abele also occasionally sat as a visiting judge on the Ohio Supreme Court.

Abele remained a member of the Ohio State Highway Patrol Auxiliary, maintaining the rank of major. From 1967 to 1991, every graduating class of the State Highway Patrol Academy was administered its oath of office by Abele.

== Death ==
He died in Hamden, Ohio at age 83 after suffering from Alzheimer&#x27;s disease.

== Personal life ==
Abele&#x27;s son Peter B. Abele is currently a judge on the Fourth District Appeals Court.

==Activation and training==

The 70th Infantry Division was activated on 15 June 1943. The division&#x27;s nickname, &quot;Trailblazers,&quot; originated from the pioneers moving west into Oregon and &quot;blazing&quot; trails through the thick evergreen forests of the Pacific Northwest. The enlisted fillers represented all forty-eight states, the District of Columbia, the territories, and forty foreign countries, including every Axis power. The states of the original Oregon Country (California, Idaho, Montana, Oregon, and Wyoming), contributed around 1,200 men combined, however, the largest number of men from any one state (1,165) came from Missouri, while Minnesota, Illinois, Pennsylvania, and Texas contributed over 1,000 men each.

==Combat chronicle==
The three infantry regiments of the 70th Infantry Division, the 274th, 275th and 276th, landed at Marseille, France, 10–15 December 1944, and were formed into Task Force Herren under command of deputy division commander, Thomas W. Herren, before the arrival of the remainder of the division on 18 January 1945. Task Force Herren took over defensive positions along the west bank of the Rhine, 28 December 1944, in the vicinity of Bischwiller, south of Haguenau Forest. Elements took part in the fight to stop the German Operation Nordwind, and struck at the enemy at Philippsbourg and at Wingen between Bitche and Hagenau. In mid-January 1945, the task force moved to an area directly south of Saarbrücken, where it carried out reconnaissance and combat patrols, and improved its defensive positions. Upon the arrival of the remainder of the division, Task Force Herren was dissolved.

The division continued patrolling and combat raids as it made preparations for an offensive drive in mid-February. On 17 February 1945, the division attacked just below the Saar River. The 70th drove onto high ground overlooking Saarbrücken, smashed into Forbach, took Stiring-Wendel, and continued across the Saar to take Saarbrücken, 20 March 1945. Pushing through Siegfried Line defenses along the north bank of the Saar, the division took Völklingen and other Saarland cities and towns. On 31 March it was reassigned to the Third Army. In April it took part in the reduction of the Saar Basin, and after VE-day was engaged in occupational duties, with command posts at Otterberg, Bad Kreuznach, Frankfurt, and Oranienstein in Germany.

==Cold War==

In 1952 it was allotted to the Organized Reserve Corps, now known as the Army Reserve. Later the same year the 70th was redesignated as the 70th Division (Training). It remained in Detroit until 1968, when it was moved to Livonia, Mich. The 70th Division (Training) was formally inactivated in Michigan on 15 Nov. 1996. The very next day, the 70th Regional Support Command was activated at Fort Lawton, Wash., bringing the name of the 70th back to the Northwest

In 1979 the command was redesignated as the 70th Regiment (Infantry One Station Unit Training), 70th Division (Training). During Desert Storm in 1991 the 70th took over Infantry School operations at Fort Benning, Georgia. The command was formally inactivated in Michigan on 15 Nov. 1996 and the 124th Army Reserve Command (ARCOM) adopted the division title and history the next day. In 2000 the 70th Regional Support Command became the 70th Regional Readiness Command and began developing a history and relationship with the 70th ID soldiers and association.

Based upon the 2005 BRAC recommendations, Fort Lawton was closed and the 70th Regional Support Command inactivated in 2009.

<text>Abigail Wahiikaahuula Campbell Kawānanakoa (also known as Princess David Kawānanakoa, January 1, 1882 – April 12, 1945) was a politician and Princess of Hawaii.

== Life ==

Abigail Campbell was born January 1, 1882, in Honolulu. She was born in the same bedroom of the Emma Street mansion which had been the birthplace of Princess Kaʻiulani. Her father was James Campbell, one of the wealthiest industrialists in the Kingdom of Hawaii. Her mother was part-Hawaiian Abigail Kuaihelani Maipinepine Bright.

She graduated from the College of Notre Dame in Belmont, California, in 1900, where she converted from Anglicanism, religion of her parents, to Roman Catholicism.
On January 6, 1902, by virtue of her marriage to Prince David Laʻamea Kahalepouli Kawānanakoa Piʻikoi, she became known as Princess Abigail.

Prince David was one of the heirs of David Kalakaua, monarch of the Kingdom of Hawaiʻi along with Princess Victoria Kaʻiulani and Kalakaua&#x27;s sister, then Crown Princess Liliuokalani. Prince David died of pneumonia in 1908. She and Prince David had three children; David Kalākaua Kawānanakoa, Abigail Helen Kapiʻolani Kawānanakoa, and Lydia Liliʻuokalani Kawānanakoa.

Upon the death of her brother-in-law, Prince Jonah Kūhiō Kalanianaʻole in 1922, Princess Abigail effectively became the leader of all native Hawaiians and took an active part in Hawaiʻi&#x27;s politics as their advocate. She also assumed the role of heir to the throne as native Hawaiians continued to pray for the return of their sovereignty. Unlike her brother-in-law Prince Kūhiō, Princess Abigail was a devoted Republican and worked to develop its platforms and pursue its ideals. In 1924 she became the Republican national committeewoman for Hawaii and served in that capacity for twelve years. Her prominence on the national stage made Princess Abigail a role model for women in Hawaii.

She died at her Honolulu home on April 12, 1945.

==Fiction==
She has a short role in Harry Turtledove&#x27;s novel in &quot;Days of Infamy&quot; where she is offered the throne of a restored Kingdom of Hawaii. She refuses, not wishing to be a puppet monarch of the Japanese.

In the 1986 Television movie drama &quot;Blood &amp; Orchids&quot; inspired by the 1932 Massie Trial, a character based on Abigail Campbell Kawānanakoa is not considered historically accurate.

<doc id="923434" wikidata="Q721915" url="?curid=923434" title="Jack Churchill (1880–1947)">
<text>Major John Strange Spencer-Churchill (4 February 1880 – 23 February 1947), known as Jack Churchill, was the younger son of Lord Randolph Churchill and his wife Jennie, and the brother of former Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Sir Winston Churchill.

==Early life==

He was born at Phoenix Park, Dublin, Ireland, where his father, Lord Randolph, was secretary to Jack&#x27;s grandfather, the 7th Duke of Marlborough, then Viceroy of Ireland.

John was educated at Harrow School in England. Jennie&#x27;s sisters believed that John&#x27;s actual biological father was Evelyn Boscawen.

==Career==

Spencer-Churchill was commissioned into the Queen&#x27;s Own Oxfordshire Hussars in 1898. He served in the South African Light Horse alongside his war correspondent brother in the Second Boer War in 1899–1900. He was shot through the leg in February 1900, during the Battle of the Tugela Heights, part of the campaign for the relief of Ladysmith. The following month he returned for duty. For his service, he was mentioned in dispatches.

He fought in World War I, where he was again mentioned in dispatches. He served on the staff of Field Marshal Lord French, General Sir Ian Hamilton (serving as Naval Liaison Officer for the Mediterranean Expeditionary Force) and Field Marshal Lord Birdwood (serving as Camp Commandant, 1st Anzac Corps, and then as Assistant Military Secretary at the headquarters of the Fifth Army).

He reached the rank of major and was awarded the French decorations of the Croix de guerre and the Légion d&#x27;honneur and the British Distinguished Service Order in 1918. After the war, he became a businessman in the City of London firstly as a partner at stockbrokers Nelke, Phillips &amp; Bendix from 1906 and then at Vickers, da Costa, making partner in 1921.

During World War II, after the widowed John lost his house during the Blitz, he lived in 10 Downing Street (where he used the bedrooms on the top floor formerly used by Churchill and his wife) or in the No 10 Annex.

==Personal life==
 He married, in Oxford on 8 August 1908, Lady Gwendoline Theresa Mary Bertie, known as Goonie (20 November 1885 – 7 July 1941), the daughter of Montagu Bertie, 7th Earl of Abingdon, and Gwendoline Mary Dormer. Lady Gwendoline had been raised as a Roman Catholic. John and his wife had three children:

* John George Spencer-Churchill (1909–1992)
* Henry Winston (known as Peregrine) Spencer-Churchill (1913–2002), who married Yvonne Henriette Mary Jehannin (1924–2010).
* (Anne) Clarissa Spencer-Churchill, later Countess of Avon (1920–2021), the wife of prime minister Anthony Eden

Jack died on 23 February 1947, aged 67, of heart disease. He is buried near his parents and brother (who outlived him for 18 years) at St Martin&#x27;s Church, Bladon, near Woodstock, Oxfordshire.

<doc id="923435" wikidata="Q209626" url="?curid=923435" title="Bois de Boulogne">
<text>The Bois de Boulogne (, &quot;Boulogne woodland&quot;) is a large public park that is the western half of the 16th arrondissement of Paris, near the suburb of Boulogne-Billancourt and Neuilly-sur-Seine. The land was ceded to the city of Paris by the Emperor Napoleon III to be turned into a public park in 1852.

It is the second-largest park in Paris, slightly smaller than the Bois de Vincennes on the eastern side of the city. It covers an area of 845 hectares (2088 acres), which is about two and a half times the area of Central Park in New York, slightly larger than Phoenix Park in Dublin, and slightly smaller than Richmond Park in London.

Within the boundaries of the Bois de Boulogne are an English landscape garden with several lakes and a cascade; two smaller botanical and landscape gardens, the Château de Bagatelle and the Pré-Catelan; a zoo and amusement park in the Jardin d&#x27;Acclimatation; GoodPlanet Foundation&#x27;s Domaine de Longchamp dedicated to ecology and humanism, the Jardin des Serres d&#x27;Auteuil, a complex of greenhouses holding a hundred thousand plants; two tracks for horse racing, the Hippodrome de Longchamp and the Auteuil Hippodrome; Stade Roland Garros where the French Open tennis tournament is held each year, the Louis Vuitton Foundation art museum and cultural center, and other attractions.

==History==
===A hunting preserve, royal châteaux, and a historic balloon flight===
The Bois de Boulogne is a remnant of the ancient oak forest of Rouvray, which included the present-day forests of Montmorency, Saint-Germain-en-Laye, Chaville, and Meudon. Dagobert I hunted bears, deer, and other game in the forest. His grandson, Childeric II, gave the forest to the monks of the Abbey of Saint-Denis, who founded several monastic communities there. Philip Augustus (1180–1223) bought back the main part of the forest from the monks to create a royal hunting reserve. In 1256, Isabelle de France, sister of Saint-Louis, founded the Abbey of Longchamp at the site of the present hippodrome.

The Bois received its present name from a chapel, Notre Dame de Boulogne la Petite, which was built in the forest at the command of Philip IV of France (1268–1314). In 1308, Philip made a pilgrimage to Boulogne-sur-Mer, on the French coast, to see a statue of the Virgin Mary which was reputed to inspire miracles. He decided to build a church with a copy of the statue in a village in the forest not far from Paris, in order to attract pilgrims. The chapel was built after Philip&#x27;s death between 1319 and 1330, in what is now Boulogne-Billancourt.

During the Hundred Years&#x27; War, the forest became a sanctuary for robbers and sometimes a battleground. In 1416–17, the soldiers of John the Fearless, the Duke of Burgundy, burned part of the forest in their successful campaign to capture Paris. Under Louis XI, the trees were replanted, and two roads were opened through the forest.

In 1526, King Francis I of France began a royal residence, the Château de Madrid, in the forest in what is now Neuilly and used it for hunting and festivities. It took its name from a similar palace in Madrid, where Francis had been held prisoner for several months. The Château was rarely used by later monarchs, fell into ruins in the 18th century, and was demolished after the French Revolution.

Despite its royal status, the forest remained dangerous for travellers; the scientist and traveller Pierre Belon was murdered by thieves in the Bois de Boulogne in 1564.

During the reigns of Henry II and Henry III, the forest was enclosed within a wall with eight gates. Henry IV planted 15,000 mulberry trees, with the hope of beginning a local silk industry. When Henry annulled his marriage to Marguerite de Valois, she went to live in the Château de la Muette, on the edge of the forest.

In the early 18th century, wealthy and important women often retired to the convent of the Abbey of Longchamp, located where the hippodrome now stands. A famous opera singer of the period, Madmoiselle Le Maure, retired there in 1727 but continued to give recitals inside the Abbey, even during Holy Week. These concerts drew large crowds and irritated the Archbishop of Paris, who closed the Abbey to the public.

Louis XVI and his family used the forest as a hunting ground and pleasure garden. In 1777, the Comte d&#x27;Artois, Louis XVI&#x27;s brother, built a charming miniature palace, the Château de Bagatelle, in the Bois in just 64 days, on a wager from his sister-in-law, Marie Antoinette. Louis XVI also opened the walled park to the public for the first time.

On 21 November 1783, Pilâtre de Rozier and the Marquis d&#x27;Arlandes took off from the Château de la Muette in a hot air balloon made by the Montgolfier brothers. Previous flights had carried animals or had been tethered to the ground; this was the first manned free flight in history. The balloon rose to a height of 910 meters (3000 feet), was in the air for 25 minutes, and covered nine kilometers.

Following the defeat of Napoleon Bonaparte in 1814, 40,000 soldiers of the British and Russian armies camped in the forest. Thousands of trees were cut down to build shelters and for firewood.

From 1815 until the French Second Republic, the Bois was largely empty, an assortment of bleak ruined meadows and tree stumps where the British and Russians had camped and dismal stagnant ponds.

===Design===

The Bois de Boulogne was the idea of Napoleon III, shortly after he staged a coup d&#x27;état and elevated himself from the President of the French Republic to Emperor of the French in 1852. When Napoleon III became Emperor, Paris had only four public parks - the Tuileries Gardens, the Luxembourg Garden, the Palais-Royal, and the Jardin des Plantes - all in the center of the city. There were no public parks in the rapidly growing east and west of the city. During his exile in London, he had been particularly impressed by Hyde Park, by its lakes and streams and its popularity with Londoners of all social classes. Therefore, he decided to build two large public parks on the eastern and western edges of the city where both the rich and ordinary people could enjoy themselves.

These parks became an important part of the plan for the reconstruction of Paris drawn up by Napoleon III and his new Prefect of the Seine, Baron Georges-Eugène Haussmann. The Haussmann plan called for improving the city&#x27;s traffic circulation by building new boulevards; improving the city&#x27;s health by building a new water distribution system and sewers; and creating green spaces and recreation for Paris&#x27; rapidly growing population. In 1852, Napoleon donated the land for the Bois de Boulogne and for the Bois de Vincennes, which both belonged officially to him. Additional land in the plain of Longchamp, the site of the Château de Madrid, the Château de Bagatelle, and its gardens were purchased and attached to the proposed park, so it could extend all the way to the Seine. Construction was funded out of the state budget, supplemented by selling building lots along the north end of the Bois, in Neuilly.

Napoleon III was personally involved in planning the new parks. He insisted that the Bois de Boulogne should have a stream and lakes, like Hyde Park in London. &quot;We must have a stream here, as in Hyde Park,&quot; he observed while driving through the Bois, &quot;to give life to this arid promenade&quot;.

The first plan for the Bois de Boulogne was drawn up by the architect Jacques Hittorff, who, under King Louis Philippe, had designed the Place de la Concorde, and the landscape architect Louis-Sulpice Varé, who had designed French landscape gardens at several famous châteaux. Their plan called for long straight alleys in patterns crisscrossing the park, and, as the Emperor had asked, lakes and a long stream similar to the Serpentine in Hyde Park.

Varé bungled the assignment. He failed to take into account the difference in elevation between the beginning of the stream and the end; if his plan had been followed, the upper part of the stream would have been empty, and the lower portion flooded. When Haussmann saw the partially finished stream, he saw the problem immediately and had the elevations measured. He dismissed the unfortunate Varé and Hittorff, and designed the solution himself; an upper lake and a lower lake, divided by an elevated road, which serves as a dam, and a cascade which allows the water to flow between the lakes. This is the design still seen today.

In 1853, Haussmann hired an experienced engineer from the corps of Bridges and Highways, Jean-Charles Adolphe Alphand, whom he had worked with in his previous assignment in Bordeaux, and made him the head of a new Service of Promenades and Plantations, in charge of all the parks in Paris. Alphand was charged to make a new plan for the Bois de Boulogne. Alphand&#x27;s plan was radically different from the Hittorff-Varé plan. While it still had two long straight boulevards, the Allée Reine Marguerite and the Avenue Longchamp, all the other paths and alleys curved and meandered. The flat Bois de Boulogne was to be turned into an undulating landscape of lakes, hills, islands, groves, lawns, and grassy slopes, not a reproduction of but an idealization of nature. It became the prototype for the other city parks of Paris and then for city parks around the world.

===Construction===

The building of the park was an enormous engineering project which lasted for five years. The upper and lower lakes were dug, and the earth piled into islands and hills. Rocks were brought from Fontainbleau and combined with concrete to make the cascade and an artificial grotto.

The pumps from the Seine could not provide enough water to fill the lakes and irrigate the park, so a new channel was created to bring the water of the Ourcq River, from Monceau to the upper lake in the Bois, but this was not enough. An artesian well 586 meters deep was eventually dug in the plain of Passy which could produce 20,000 cubic meters of water a day. This well went into service in 1861.

The water then had to be distributed around the park to water the lawns and gardens; the traditional system of horse-drawn wagons with large barrels of water would not be enough. A system of 66 kilometers of pipes was laid, with a faucet every 30 or 40 meters, a total of 1600 faucets.

Alphand also had to build a network of roads, paths, and trails to connect the sights of the park. The two long straight alleys from the old park were retained, and his workers built an additional 58 kilometers of roads paved with stones for carriages, 12 kilometers of sandy paths for horses, and 25 kilometers of dirt trails for walkers. As a result of Louis Napoléon&#x27;s exile in London and his memories of Hyde Park, all the new roads and paths were curved and meandering.

The planting of the park was the task of the new chief gardener and landscape architect of the Service of Promenades and Plantations, Jean-Pierre Barillet-Deschamps, who had also worked with Haussmann and Alphand in Bordeaux. His gardeners planted 420,000 trees, including hornbeam, beech, linden, cedar, chestnut, and elm, and hardy exotic species, like redwoods. They planted 270 hectares of lawns, with 150 kilograms of seed per hectare, and thousands of flowers. To make the forest more natural, they brought 50 deer to live in and around the Pré-Catelan.

The park was designed to be more than a collection of picturesque landscapes; it was meant as a place for amusement and recreation, with sports fields, bandstands, cafes, shooting galleries, riding stables, boating on the lakes, and other attractions. In 1855, Gabriel Davioud, a graduate of Ecole des Beaux-Arts, was named the chief architect of the new Service of Promenades and Plantations. He was commissioned to design 24 pavilions and chalets, plus cafes, gatehouses, boating docks, and kiosks. He designed the gatehouses where the guardians of the park lived to look like rustic cottages. He had a real Swiss chalet built out of wood in Switzerland and transported to Paris, where it was reassembled on an island in the lake and became a restaurant. He built another restaurant next to the park&#x27;s most picturesque feature, the Grand Cascade. He designed artificial grottoes made of rocks and concrete, and bridges and balustrades made of concrete painted to look like wood. He also designed all the architectural details of the park, from cone-shaped shelters designed to protect horseback riders from the rain to the park benches and direction signs.

At the south end of the park, in the Plain of Longchamp, Davioud restored the ruined windmill which was the surviving vestige of the Abbey of Longchamp, and, working with the Jockey Club of Paris, constructed the grandstands of the Hippodrome of Longchamp, which opened in 1857.

At the northern end of the park, between the Sablons gate and Neuilly, a 20-hectare section of the park was given to the Societé Imperiale zoologique d&#x27;Acclimatation, to create a small zoo and botanical garden, with an aviary of rare birds and exotic plants and animals from around the world.

In March 1855, an area in the center of the park, called the Pré-Catelan, was leased to a concessionaire for a garden and amusement park. It was built on the site of a quarry where the gravel and sand for the park&#x27;s roads and paths had been dug out. It included a large circular lawn surrounded by trees, grottos, rocks, paths, and flower beds. Davioud designed a buffet, a marionette theater, a photography pavilion, stables, a dairy, and other structures. The most original feature was the Théâtre des fleurs, an open-air theater in a setting of trees and flowers. Later, an ice skating rink and shooting gallery were added. The Pré-Catelan was popular for concerts and dances, but it had continual financial difficulties and eventually went bankrupt. The floral theater remained in business until the beginning of the First World War, in 1914.

===In the 19th and 20th centuries===
The garden-building team assembled by Haussmann of Alphand, Barrillet-Deschamps and Davioud went on to build The Bois de Vincennes, Parc Monceau Parc Montsouris, and the Parc des Buttes-Chaumont, using the experience and aesthetics they had developed in the Bois de Boulogne. They also rebuilt the Luxembourg gardens and the gardens of the Champs- Elysees, created smaller squares and parks throughout the center of Paris, and planted thousands of trees along the new boulevards that Haussmann had created. In the 17 years of Napoleon III&#x27;s reign, they planted no less than 600,000 trees and created a total 1,835 hectares of green space in Paris, more than any other ruler of France before or since. By 1867 the Baedeker Guide described it as &quot;once a forest abounding with game, the resort of duellists and suicides and the haunt of bandits ... now a delightful park&quot;. 

During the Franco-Prussian War (1870–71), which led to the downfall of Napoleon III and the long siege of Paris, the park suffered some damage from German artillery bombardment, the restaurant of the Grand Cascade was turned into a field hospital, and many of the park&#x27;s animals and wild fowl were eaten by the hungry population. In the years following, however, the park quickly recovered.

The Bois de Boulogne became a popular meeting place and promenade route for Parisians of all classes. The alleys were filled with carriages, coaches, and horseback riders, and later with men and women on bicycles, and then with automobiles. Families having picnics filled the woods and lawns, and Parisians rowed boats on the lake, while the upper classes were entertained in the cafes. The restaurant of the Pavillon de la Grand Cascade became a popular spot for Parisian weddings. During the winter, when the lakes were frozen, they were crowded with ice skaters.

The activities of Parisians in the Bois, particularly the long promenades in carriages around the lakes, were often portrayed in French literature and art in the second half of the 19th and the beginning of the 20th centuries. Scenes set in the park appeared in &quot;Nana&quot; by Émile Zola and in &quot;L&#x27;Éducation sentimentale&quot; by Gustave Flaubert. In the last pages of &quot;Du côté de chez Swann&quot; in &quot;À la recherche du temps perdu&quot; (1914), Marcel Proust minutely described a walk around the lakes taken as a child. The life in the park was also the subject of the paintings of many artists, including Édouard Manet, Pierre-Auguste Renoir, and Vincent van Gogh, and Mary Cassatt.

In 1860, Napoleon opened the Jardin d&#x27;Acclimatation, a separate concession of 20 hectares at the north end of the park; it included a zoo and a botanical garden, as well as an amusement park. Between 1877 and 1912, it also served as the home of what was called an ethnological garden, a place where groups of the inhabitants of faraway countries were put on display for weeks at a time in reconstructed villages from their homelands. They were mostly Sub-Saharan Africans, North Africans, or South American Indians, and came mostly from the French colonies in Africa and South America, but also included natives of Lapland and Cossacks from Russia. These exhibitions were extremely popular and took place not only in Paris, but also in Germany, England, and at the Chicago Exposition in the United States; but they were also criticized at the time and later as being a kind of &quot;human zoo&quot;. Twenty-two of these exhibits were held in the park in the last quarter of the 19th century. About ten more were held in the 20th century, with the last one taking place in 1931.

In 1905, a grand new restaurant in the classical style was built in the Pré-Catelan by architect Guillaume Tronchet. Like the cafe at the Grand Cascade, it became a popular promenade destination for the French upper classes.

At the 1900 Summer Olympics, the land hosted the croquet and tug of war events. During the 1924 Summer Olympics, the equestrian events took place in the Auteuil Hippodrome.

The Bois de Boulogne hosted all rowing teams participating in the Inter-Allied Games, held in Paris in 1919 following the end of World War One.

The Bois de Boulogne was officially annexed by the city of Paris in 1929 and incorporated into the 16th arrondissement.

Soon after World War II, the park began to come back to life. In 1945, it held its first motor race after the war: the Paris Cup. In 1953, a British group, Les Amis de la France, created the Shakespeare Garden on the site of the old floral theater in the Pré-Catelan.

From 1952 until 1986, the Duke of Windsor, the title granted to King Edward VIII after his abdication, and his wife, Wallis Simpson, the Duchess of Windsor, lived in the Villa Windsor, a house in the Bois de Boulogne behind the garden of the Bagatelle. The house was (and still is) owned by the City of Paris and was leased to the couple. The Duke died in this house in 1972, and the Duchess died there in 1986. The lease was purchased by Mohamed al-Fayed, the owner of the Ritz Hotel in Paris. The house was visited briefly by Diana, Princess of Wales and her companion, Dodi Fayed, on 31 August 1997, the day that they died in a traffic accident in the Alma tunnel.

==Public park==

On weekends, the Bois de Boulogne is full of activities such as biking, jogging, boat rowing, horseback and pony rides, and remote control speed boats. Picnics are permitted in most parts of the park, but barbecues are not allowed.

The Bois de Boulogne hosts several races, like the of Boulogne and the Boulogne half marathon. Since its creation, the last part of the Paris marathon ends by crossing the Bois de Boulogne from . Boulogne Wood is an important place of running in Paris.

The Bois holds a three-day weekend party in the month of July, with over 50 bands and singers, attended mostly by students who camp out overnight.

Though soliciting for prostitution is illegal in France, at night-time parts of the Bois de Boulogne are a popular rendezvous place for prostitutes, usually working in vans parked by the side of the road. The practice persists despite some French government efforts to eliminate this business from the park.

Bois de Boulogne is home to many red squirrels. They are protected by law in France, and dogs are required to be kept on leads in the park to ensure the safety of the squirrels.

==Features==
===Lakes and streams===

The Bois de Boulogne contains two artificial lakes and eight artificial ponds, connected by three artificial streams. They receive their water from a canal drawn from Ourq River and from artesian wells in Passy. The water arrives in the Lac Superieur (Upper Lake), built in 1852 and located near the Hippodrome de Auteil, then flows by gravity to the Grand Cascade and then to the Lac Inferieur, or Lower Lake.
*The Lac Inferieur (1853) is the largest lake in the park, near the large lawns of Muette. The area is very popular with joggers, and boats can be rented on the lower lake from 15 February to the end of October. The lake is the home to many swans and ducks. An island in the lake, accessible by boat, contains the city&#x27;s only monument to the Park&#x27;s builder, Napoleon III; a small wooden kiosk at the end of the island, called the Kiosk of the Emperor.
*The Grand Cascade (1856) was built out of four thousand cubic meters of rocks from Fontainebleau, and two thousand cubic meters of cement. In addition to the picturesque waterfall, it has two artificial grottoes, one over the other, which can be visited.
*The Etang de Reservoir holds the water before it falls in the Grand Cascade.
*The Ruisseau de Longchamp (1855) is the major artificial stream in the park. It flows through the Pré-Catelan, under the alley of Reine Marguerite, then to the Mare des Biches, one of the oldest natural ponds in the park, then to the Etang de Reservoir and the Grand Cascade.
*The Mare de Saint-James is located next to the Jardin d&#x27;Acclimatation, and was formerly a quarry for sand and gravel. It has two islands which are a sanctuary for birds and small animals.

===Gardens===
Within the Bois de Boulogne, there are several separate botanical and floral gardens, and gardens of amusement.
*The Château de Bagatelle. Following the French Revolution, the miniature château and English landscape garden of the Bagatelle was restored to the Bourbon family. They sold it in 1835 to an English nobleman, Francis Seymour-Conway, 3rd Marquess of Hertford. It remained separate and outside the Bois de Boulogne until 1905, when it was purchased by the City of Paris and attached to the park. The garden was enlarged and redesigned by Jean-Claude Nicolas Forestier, the new Superintendent of Parks of Paris, a pupil of Alphand. He preserved many elements of the old garden, and added sections of botanical garden, including an iris garden and a pond for Nymphaeaceae, or water lilies, popularized at the time by the paintings of Claude Monet. He also built one of the most popular features of the Bagatelle today, the rose garden. The rose garden today has more than nine thousand plants, and is the site of the Concours international de roses nouvelles de Bagatelle, held each June, one of the major competitions of new roses in the world. Since 1983, the Festival of Chopin in Paris is held in the Orangerie, next to the rose garden. The garden also hosts regular exhibits of sculpture and art.

*The Jardin d&#x27;Acclimatation, opened in 1860 as a zoo and pleasure garden, still has many of the traditional features of a children&#x27;s amusement park, including an archery range, a miniature train ride, pony ride and Guignol puppet theater, but it underwent several changes in its theme in the last decade. A science museum for children, the Exploradome, opened in 1999. It also now includes a section with an Asian theme, with a teahouse, a lacquered bridge, and a Korean garden. In October 2014, a major new museum opened, the Louis Vuitton Foundation, in a building designed by architect Frank Gehry.
*The Jardin des Serres d&#x27;Auteuil is a large complex of greenhouses in the southern part of the park. They stand on the site of a botanical garden founded in 1761 by King Louis XV. The present greenhouses were built in 1895–98, and now house about one hundred thousand plants. In 1998 the greenhouses officially became part of the Botanical Garden in Paris, which also includes the Bagatelle in the Bois de Boulogne and the Parc Floral de Paris and the Arboretum de l&#x27;Ecole de Breuil in the Bois de Vincennes.
*The Pré-Catelan still has a few vestiges of its early days; a majestic copper beech planted in 1782; a giant sequoia tree planted in 1872; the old buffet built by Gabriel Davioud; the grand restaurant built by Guillaume Tronchet in 1905; and the Shakespeare Garden, created in 1953 on the site of the old floral theater. Five different natural settings contain all of the trees, bushes and flowers mentioned in Shakespeare&#x27;s plays.

===Sports===
*The Hippodrome de Longchamp, opened in 1857, is built on the site of the old Abbey of Longchamp. A restored windmill, the only building left of the Abbey, is located on the grounds of the track. The major annual racing event at the Hippodrome de Longchamp is the Prix de l&#x27;Arc de Triomphe, held every October.
*The Auteuil Hippodrome, covering 33 hectares, opened in 1873. It is used exclusively for steeplechase racing.
*The Stade Roland Garros is a tennis complex which hosts the annual French Open tournament in early June. It was opened in 1928 for the first defense of the Davis Cup tennis tournament, and is named for the French aviator Roland Garros, who was the first pilot to fly solo across the Mediterranean and a First World War ace. The 8.5 hectare complex has twenty courts. The famous red clay courts are actually made of white limestone, dusted with a few millimeters of powdered red brick dust.
*A weekly 5 km Parkrun takes place within the park.

===Recreation===
There is a seven-hectare campground in the Bois de Boulogne, Camping Indigo Paris, with five hundred and ten sites (&quot;pitches&quot;) for travellers with tents, caravans and camping cars. Reservations can be made in advance, online. Mobile home rentals are also available by reservation.

==Combat chronicle ==

The 69th Infantry Division arrived in England, on 12 December 1944, where it continued its training.

It landed in Le Havre, France, on 24 January 1945, and moved to Belgium to relieve the 99th Division, on 12 February, and hold defensive positions in the Siegfried Line. The division went over to the attack, on 27 February, capturing the high ridge east of Prether to facilitate use of the Hellenthal-Hollerath Highway.

In a rapid advance to the east, the 69th took Schmidtheim and Dahlem, 7 March. The period from 9 to 21 March was spent in mopping up activities and training. The division resumed its forward movement to the west bank of the Rhine, crossing the river and capturing the fortress of Ehrenbreitstein, on 27 March.

It relieved the 80th Division in Kassel, 7 April, seized Hannoversch Münden on the 8th and Weissenfels on the 14th against sharp opposition, and captured Leipzig, 19 April, following a fierce struggle within the city. Eilenburg fell, 23 April, and the east bank of the Mulde River was secured.

Two days later, division patrols in the area between the Elbe and the Mulde Rivers contacted elements of the Soviet 5th Guards Army at Strehla, in the vicinity of Riesa and again at Torgau on Elbe Day. Until VE-day, the 69th patrolled and policed its area. Occupation duties were given to the division until it left for home and inactivation on 7 September.

<text>Steyr (; ) is a statutory city, located in the Austrian federal state of Upper Austria. It is the administrative capital, though not part of Steyr-Land District. Steyr is Austria&#x27;s 12th most populated town and the 3rd largest city in Upper Austria.

The city has a long history as a manufacturing center and has given its name to several manufacturers headquartered there, such as the former Steyr-Daimler-Puch conglomerate and its successor Steyr Motors.

==Geography==
The city is situated in the Traunviertel region, with the two rivers Steyr and Enns flowing through it and meeting near the town centre beneath Lamberg Castle and St Michael&#x27;s Church. This prominent location has made it prone to severe flooding through the centuries until the present, one of the worst cases being recently in August 2002. To the south of the town rises a series of hills that climb in altitude and stretch out to the Upper Austrian Prealps. To the north, the hills roll downward towards the confluence of the Enns with the Danube River, where the town of Enns is situated. In the east, the municipal area borders with Lower Austria.

Steyr is an ancient town with modern amenities, marketing its rich cultural and architectural heritage in tourism like Vienna and many other well preserved Austrian historic towns. It marked its 1,000th anniversary in 1980, after undergoing extensive restoration of its historic architecture which has made it one of the best preserved old towns in the country. The famous historic town centre built around the &quot;Stadtplatz&quot; (town square) was largely restored following World War II. Its best-known piece of architecture is called the Bummerlhaus which is considered one of the finest examples of Gothic architecture for its size in Central Europe.

The city comprises the cadastral communities of Christkindl, Föhrenschacherl, Gleink, Hinterberg, Jägerberg, Sarning, Stein, and Steyr.

==History==

Celts settled the area from about 600 BC, the name of the &quot;Stiria&quot; River is of Celtic origin. Their kingdom of Noricum became part of the Roman Empire in 15 BC. A settlement named &quot;Gesodunum&quot; noted by the ancient geographer Claudius Ptolemy (c. 90 – c. 168) was possibly located in the Steyr region. Here the Roman &quot;Iron Road&quot; led from the Erzberg mine along the Enns River to the castra of &quot;Lauriacum&quot; (at present-day Enns) on the Danube.

In the 6th century, Slavic settlers moved into the area, but when they were defeated by Duke Tassilo III of Bavaria, who granted the land to nearby Kremsmünster Abbey in 777, the area was resettled with Bavarians. During the Hungarian invasions of Europe, a fortress was erected above the Steyr River by the local Traungau counts, first mentioned as &quot;Styraburg&quot; in a 980 deed. From 1055 Steyr Castle in the Bavarian Traungau as well as the adjacent &quot;March of Styria&quot; were ruled by the mighty Otakar dynasty. The Otokars controlled the iron mining at Erzberg and made their residence at Steyr a centre of medieval courtly culture and Middle High German poetry. 

In 1180, Emperor Frederick Barbarossa elevated Margrave Ottokar IV to a Duke of Styria; however, the line became extinct upon his death in 1192 and, according to the 1186 Georgenberg Pact, his Styrian lands fell to the Babenberg dukes of Austria.

Steyr, already named a town (&quot;urbs&quot;) by then, lost its importance as a ducal residence but retained its status as a centre of ironworking. The Babenberg rulers promoted its economic development as a site of blacksmithing, mainly knife making and armament industry. After the extinction of the Babenbergs in 1246, Steyr together with the Duchy of Austria was occupied by the Přemyslid king Ottokar II of Bohemia and finally taken over by the Habsburg king Rudolf I of Germany upon his victory at the 1278 Battle on the Marchfeld. The town privileges and market rights were confirmed by Rudolf&#x27;s son King Albert I in 1287 and the citizens further on benefitted of Steyr&#x27;s preferred position within the iron trade all over the Holy Roman Empire and especially with the Republic of Venice.

In the 13th and 14th century, Steyr was a centre of the Christian Waldensian movement and a location of the inquisitorial persecutions led by the Catholic cleric Petrus Zwicker (d. 1403). Likewise, the Protestant Reformation quickly spread among the citizens about 1525, fiercely opposed by the Habsburg rulers in the course of the Counter-Reformation. 

The economic situation changed for the worse, as the iron trade decayed during the Thirty Years&#x27; War, when Upper Austria was pawned to Duke Maximilian I of Bavaria, and the Peasants&#x27; War in Upper Austria of 1626. In 1727 the medieval &quot;Styraburg&quot; was devastated by a blaze and replaced by the Baroque Lamberg Castle. The resurgence of Steyr began under the conditions of late 18th century Josephinism and continued in the course of the succeeding industrialisation. During the Napoleonic Wars Steyr was occupied by French troops several times. On 25 December 1800, the Armistice of Steyr was signed there.

In 1830 the blacksmith Leopold Werndl founded an armory at Steyr, which his sons Josef and Franz Werndl re-established as a stock company in 1864, named the &quot;Österreichische Waffenfabriksgesellschaft&quot; (ÖWG) from 1869. Including the Steyr automobile branch from 1915 it was renamed &quot;Steyr-Werke AG&quot; in 1926 and formed a large industrial conglomerate by the merger with Austro-Daimler and Puch in 1934. However, the Steyr industry was hit hard by the 1929 Great Depression. 

In 1934, the town became one of several battlegrounds between Social Democratic &quot;Schutzbund&quot; paramilitary forces and Christian Social &quot;Heimwehr&quot; militias in the Austrian Civil War, which brought about the fascist corporate Federal State of Austria that ruled the country until the 1938 &quot;Anschluss&quot; to Nazi Germany.

The Nazi authorities incorporated the armament industry into the vast &quot;Reichswerke Hermann Göring&quot; conglomerate, including the construction of the Steyr-Münichholz subcamp of forced labourers, part of the Mauthausen network. A major producer of arms and military vehicles during World War II, Steyr became a target of Allied bombing raids to knock out its factories. In two major attacks by the US Fifteenth Air Force during the &quot;Big Week&quot; on 23 and 24 February 1944, much of the town was badly damaged, but the factories continued to function until near the end of the war. 

The city was a meeting point on 9 May 1945, when units of the 5th Guards Airborne of the Red Army and black troops of the US 761st Tank Battalion along with the 71st Infantry Division contacted each other on the bridge over the Enns River. Steyr was occupied by the U.S. Army—the Soviet Army moved east behind the demarcation line of the province of Lower Austria. The troops remained until 1955 when Austria officially declared neutrality by the Austrian State Treaty.

<text>A roster bonus is a feature that may be included in a professional sports player contract.

A roster bonus is conditional, unlike a signing bonus. The latter is received upon the initial signing of the contract and is generally the player&#x27;s regardless of future events. The roster bonus, however, is paid only if a player is still on the active roster of the team at a specific future date. This feature is mostly used in North America in National Football League contracts. Most NFL roster bonuses have trigger dates of either March 1 or June 1 of a specific future year. If the player is on the team&#x27;s roster as of that date, the entire amount of the bonus must be paid, even if he is released the next day.

The roster bonus has a very specific effect on a team&#x27;s &quot;salary cap,&quot; the amount of its payroll that counts toward the money permitted by league agreement. Unlike a signing bonus, the amount of a roster bonus is not prorated over the lifetime of a player&#x27;s contract. Thus, roster bonuses are often used by teams that prefer to front-load the salary cap impact of a contract and lessen the impact on future years. In other cases, large roster bonuses are not truly intended by the parties to be paid, but rather to create a virtual deadline by which a team will either cut the player or renegotiate their contract.

<text>Edward Story (or Storey; died 1503) was an English priest, Bishop of Carlisle, 1468–1477, and Bishop of Chichester, 1477–1503.

Story was educated at Pembroke Hall, Cambridge, where he was elected a fellow about 1444. In 1450, he was appointed Master of Michaelhouse, Cambridge, a post he held together with his later preferments until 1477. Advanced to the see of Carlisle by papal provision on 18 July 1468, he was consecrated a bishop on 2 October 1468. He was translated to Chichester on 11 February 1478. He served as chaplain to Elizabeth Woodville and as Chancellor of Cambridge University. He founded the Prebendal School in Chichester, and he is reputed to have had the Chichester Cross erected.

Story died on 16 March 1503. His death is recorded in the Lewkenor Hours (Lambeth Palace Library MS 545), the book of hours once owned by the wealthy Lewkenor family of Tratton and Tangmere (Sussex).

<doc id="923453" wikidata="Q352483" url="?curid=923453" title="Dynamic routing">
<text>In computer networking, dynamic routing (DR), also called adaptive routing (AR),
is a process where a router can forward data via a different route for a given destination based on the current conditions of the communication circuits within a system. The term is most commonly associated with data networking to describe the capability of a network to &#x27;route around&#x27; damage, such as loss of a node or a connection between nodes, as long as other path choices are available. Dynamic routing allows as many routes as possible to remain valid in response to the change.

Systems that do not implement dynamic routing are described as using static routing, where routes through a network are described by fixed paths. A change, such as the loss of a node, or loss of a connection between nodes, is not compensated for. This means that anything that wishes to take an affected path will either have to wait for the failure to be repaired before restarting its journey, or will have to fail to reach its destination and give up the journey.

==All protocols==
There are several routing protocols that can be used for dynamic routing. Routing Information Protocol (RIP) is a distance-vector routing protocol that prevents routing loops by implementing a limit on the number of hops allowed in a path from source to destination. Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) uses a link state routing (LSR) algorithm and falls into the group of interior gateway protocols (IGPs). Intermediate System to Intermediate System (IS-IS) determines the best route for data through a packet-switched network. Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (IGRP) and its advanced form Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (EIGRP) are used by routers to exchange routing data within an autonomous system.

== Alternate paths ==
Many systems use some next-hop forwarding protocol—when a packet arrives at some node, that node decides on-the-fly which link to use to push the packet one hop closer to its final destination.

Routers that use some adaptive protocols, such as the Spanning Tree Protocol, in order to &quot;avoid bridge loops and routing loops&quot;, calculate a tree that indicates the one &quot;best&quot; link for a packet to get to its destination.
Alternate &quot;redundant&quot; links not on the tree are temporarily disabled—until one of the links on the main tree fails, and the routers calculate a new tree using those links to route around the broken link.

Routers that use other adaptive protocols, such as grouped adaptive routing, find a group of &quot;all&quot; the links that could be used to get the packet one hop closer to its final destination.
The router sends the packet out any link of that group which is idle.
The link aggregation of that group of links effectively becomes a single high-bandwidth connection.

==Outside of computer networks==
Dynamic routing in found the brain in relation between sensory and mnemonic signals and decision making, and is a subject of studies in neuroscience.

<text>Frederick C. Murphy (July 27, 1918 – March 19, 1945) was a recipient of the Medal of Honor during World War II while serving as a medic in the US 65th Infantry Division.

==Background==
Murphy was born in Boston, Massachusetts, and lived in Quincy and attended the Thayer Academy in Braintree from where he graduated in 1939. He entered the University of Pennsylvania later that year. The Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941 caused him to attempt to enlist with the U.S. Army. He was denied after failing two physical examinations and classified IV-F. After surgery to correct back problems, he successfully enlisted in November 1943 at Weymouth where he then lived. He became a medic in the U.S. Army 259th Infantry of the 65th Infantry Division. His basic training was at Camp Shelby, Mississippi, and his medical and surgical technician training was at the Fitzsimons General Hospital in Aurora, Colorado.

==Medal of Honor citation==
*Rank and organization: Private First Class, U.S. Army, Medical Detachment, 259th Infantry, 65th Infantry Division.
*Place and date: Siegfried Line at Saarlautern, Germany, March 18, 1945.
*Entered service at: Weymouth, Mass.
*Birth: Boston, Mass.
*G.O. No.: 21, February 26, 1946.
*Citation:An aid man, he was wounded in the right shoulder soon after his comrades had jumped off in a dawn attack 18 March 1945, against the Siegfried Line at Saarlautern, Germany. He refused to withdraw for treatment and continued forward, administering first aid under heavy machinegun, mortar, and artillery fire. When the company ran into a thickly sown antipersonnel minefield and began to suffer more and more casualties, he continued to disregard his own wound and unhesitatingly braved the danger of exploding mines, moving about through heavy fire and helping the injured until he stepped on a mine which severed one of his feet. In spite of his grievous wounds, he struggled on with his work, refusing to be evacuated and crawling from man to man administering to them while in great pain and bleeding profusely. He was killed by the blast of another mine which he had dragged himself across in an effort to reach still another casualty. With indomitable courage, and unquenchable spirit of self-sacrifice and supreme devotion to duty which made it possible for him to continue performing his tasks while barely able to move, Pfc. Murphy saved many of his fellow soldiers at the cost of his own life.

PFC Murphy is buried at Lorraine Cemetery north of Saint-Avold, Lorraine, France. He left a wife and a daughter born two months after his death.

==Namesakes==
A victory ship, hull number 821, (VC2-S-AP2/WSAT) the USAT &quot;Private Frederick C Murphy&quot;, was named in his honor. The ship had originally been named SS &quot;Maritime Victory&quot; when it launched in 1945. It displaced 7,607 gross tons, and had an overall length of 455 feet, and beam of 62 feet. This ship was moored at Beaumont Reserve (Texas) and was sold for scrap in 2008.

Murphy Barracks in Stuttgart Germany was named for Pvt. Murphy.

The National Archives facility in Waltham, Massachusetts was named the Frederick C. Murphy Federal Center to honor Murphy.

Frederick C. Murphy Primary school in Weymouth, MA.

Murphy was honored by his alma mater and University of Pennsylvania Class of 1943 classmates at their 55th reunion in 1998 by (a) featuring his name as the most prominent name on the rebuilt University of Pennsylvania War Memorial on South 33rd Street, at the gateway to The Palestra and Franklin Field, and (b) dedicating to Murphy their class gift by naming the revamped circulation area at Penn&#x27;s main Van Pelt Library as the Frederick C. Murphy circulation area.

<doc id="923461" wikidata="Q1179339" url="?curid=923461" title="Moson County">
<text>Moson (German: Wieselburg, Slovak: Mošon) was an administrative county (comitatus) of the Kingdom of Hungary, situated mostly on the right (south) side of the Danube river. Its territory is now divided between Austria and Hungary, except a small area which is part of Slovakia. Moson is also the name of a town, nowadays part of the city Mosonmagyaróvár, Hungary.

==Geography==
Moson county shared borders with the Austrian land Lower Austria and the Hungarian counties Pozsony, Győr and Sopron. The river Danube runs along the north of the county, and the Lake Neusiedl (Hungarian: Fertő tó) lies partly in the county. Its area was 2013 km2 around 1910.

==Capitals==
The capital of the county was the town of Moson initially. The capital was moved to nearby Magyaróvár in the Middle Ages. Moson and Magyaróvár merged in 1939 to form the city of Mosonmagyaróvár.

==History==
The Moson comitatus arose as one of the first comitatuses of the Kingdom of Hungary.

In 1920 by the Treaty of Trianon a tiny part of Moson county close to Pressburg (Pozsony, today&#x27;s Bratislava) became part of newly formed Czechoslovakia. The eastern part stayed in Hungary and merged with Győr county and a very small part of Pozsony county to form Győr-Moson-Pozsony county. The western part became part of the new Austrian land Burgenland (formed in 1921). Three villages – Dunacsún, (Čunovo), Horvátjárfalu (Jarovce), and Oroszvár (Rusovce) – became part of Czechoslovakia.

After World War II, Győr-Moson-Pozsony county merged with Sopron County to form Győr-Sopron county. This county was renamed to Győr-Moson-Sopron county in the early 1990s.

<doc id="923467" wikidata="Q5743340" url="?curid=923467" title="Heroic measure">
<text>In the context of medicine, heroic measures refer to any courses of treatment or therapy aimed at saving or prolonging a person&#x27;s life, despite the potential harm those treatments may cause. Heroic measures are almost always used in the scenario of life-threatening situations, when all other viable treatment options have failed, or there is no better treatment option available. The term is not explicitly defined, but rather associated with other umbrella terms, such as advanced care planning and end-of-life care. In conversations, people may use other terms depending on the context, such as &quot;a Hail Mary situation&quot; to emphasize the desperate needs for such treatment. 
== Examples ==
=== CPR ===
Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) serves as a popular example of a heroic measure. CPR is a potentially life-saving emergency procedure involving chest compressions and rescue breathing, used when a person&#x27;s heart stops beating or they are not breathing. While CPR can be considered a standard of care in the healthcare setting, it is often seen as a last-ditch attempt to save a person&#x27;s life in an emergency. If a person suffers cardiac arrest and is not near adequate medical attention, CPR can be seen as the only viable option to revive the person. Potential consequences of CPR include sternum fracture, rib fracture, lung contusion, artery rupture and hemorrhage, but nevertheless, CPR may be medically necessary when the alternative option is death.

=== Amputations ===
Amputations of limbs may be considered heroic measures, but necessary in situations which call for drastic measures. In the event that a limb gets physically crushed or is damaged beyond repair, the only way to save the patient may be to remove the affected limb. For example, persons with diabetes are at risk of nerve damage if they consistently have high blood sugar. This leaves the affected area at risk for infection, and if severe infection occurs and the infected limb is not removed, it can infect the rest of the body, which will most often lead to death. This is also the case with people who leave dangerous infections untreated: the tissue of that limb will begin to die, leaving amputation as the only way to save the person from sepsis as the infection spreads to the rest of the body. However, one can argue the use of a prosthesis after amputation would disqualify this method as an heroic measure, but there are also limitations and negative consequences to prosthesis use. This is more prevalent in isolated areas, where medical attention is very far away.

=== Cancer and end-of-life planning ===
Oftentimes, treatments like chemotherapy and radiation are also considered examples of heroic measures. Chemotherapy is a treatment that uses drugs to target and destroy rapidly-growing cells, like cancer cells. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill cancer cells. In medicine, chemotherapy and radiation are commonly used to treat cancer. Though it can be a very effective treatment for cancer, it does not come without its side effects—some of which are more serious than others. For example, some common side effects of chemotherapy and radiation include: fatigue, hair loss, nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, skin changes, and more. These side effects occur because chemotherapy and radiation kill not only cancer cells, but also normal, healthy cells in the body as well. Some more serious side effects that can also occur as a result of these treatments is damage to other organs in the body like the lungs, kidneys, nerves, heart, or reproductive organs. It is even possible for a second cancer to develop many years after chemotherapy. Although chemotherapy and radiation are commonly used as cancer treatments, there is potential harm to the body that can occur as a result of these treatments. However, sometimes there are no other treatment options available to treat the cancer and it is necessary to use chemotherapy or radiation in attempts to treat a person with cancer and save their life despite the side effects that can occur.

Often when people with cancer find that experimental chemotherapies are unsuccessful, end-of-life planning begins to start since that is usually the last line of resort for the person. Although there are arguments on whether end of life planning should be considered heroic since it does not prolong or save a person&#x27;s life, similar to throwing the surrender flag up in the air. However, the topic is still relevant as unsuccessful heroic measures will usually lead to certain death as they are last resort. There has been concern for Oncology providers preferring to introduce end-of-life planning later after attempting all heroic measures when others argue that it should be emphasized before experimental chemotherapy starts Many palliative care advocates argue that more emphasis should be placed offering this care as a viable option for people when deciding whether to try riskier experimental treatments or opt for a safer route of care.

== Ethical considerations ==
Often, the use of heroic measures is considered when a person is nearing the end of their life. Many healthcare providers try to work with individuals nearing the end of life to discuss ‘end of life planning”, also known as advanced care planning, to get a better understanding of the treatment that person would like to receive. There are many factors that individuals, families, and healthcare teams must consider when choosing a treatment plan for end-of-life care. The topic of a person&#x27;s end of life can be a very difficult subject for these individuals, family members, and healthcare providers to discuss, so there can often be misunderstanding between these parties on what type of treatment is best for the person nearing end-of-life. Advanced care planning may be difficult for individuals to consider, but it can be a useful tool for families and healthcare providers when determining treatment and the use of heroic measures in the case when the individual is no longer able to make a decision themselves. Generally, taking a heroic measure in attempts to save someone&#x27;s life towards the end is more costly than pursuing non-heroic measures for treatment. Overall, this raises questions and concerns regarding the cost of a person&#x27;s life and if this is a factor that should be taken into consideration during end-of-life planning. Additionally, heroic measures taken during end-of-life tend to be more aggressive and raises concerns about quality of life after and if that is worth being compromised to save a life. Given that the use of heroic measures can also be challenging for healthcare providers to discuss, many institutions now have training and certificate programs specially designed to help healthcare providers overcome barriers associated with end-of-life decision-making.

The considerations regarding the use of heroic measures can be even more difficult to decide on when the individual receiving care is a child. Since this can be a very challenging time for all parties involved, healthcare providers and parents need to have a mutual understanding of what care will be provided for the child. In cases where a minor is old enough and competent, they should be involved in the decision-making process to the best of their ability with parents and healthcare providers respecting the decisions of the child. When making the decision over the use of heroic measures, caregivers and providers should consider treatments in which the benefits to the child outweigh the potential burdens treatment will cause. If there is discourse on whether a potential treatment may be the best choice for the child, providers, and caregivers should consider whether the treatment they will be performing is being done “for the child” or “to the child”. Nevertheless, when facing the potential end-of-life of a child, it is important for healthcare teams to still leave room for hope for recovery as this can improve quality-of-life for children and their families at end-of-life.

<text>Bright Promise is an American daytime soap opera that ran on NBC from September 29, 1969 to March 31, 1972.

==Synopsis==
The show revolved around students and faculty at the fictional Bancroft College, located in the community of Bancroft, somewhere in the American Midwest. The name of the show reflected the overarching theme of the bright promise that the leaders of tomorrow graduating from Bancroft would ostensibly bring. At first, the main character was College president Thomas Boswell (Dana Andrews). Later, the focus shifted from the College, to the town of Bancroft at large, and focused mainly on the Pierce and Jones families. The main character by this time was Sandra Jones, who had been a student at Bancroft College, and married herself into the wealthy Pierce family.

&quot;Bright Promise&quot; was created by the husband-and-wife writing team of Frank and Doris Hursley, who had previously created &quot;General Hospital&quot;, and was their last project prior to their retirement. Bing Crosby Productions (under the name Frandor Productions) was the packager, with assistance from Cox Broadcasting. The title and closing sequences were filmed at UCLA.

Having replaced the game show &quot;You Don&#x27;t Say!,&quot; &quot;Bright Promise&quot; would give way to another serial, &quot;Return to Peyton Place,&quot; on the NBC daytime schedule; the serial had been soundly defeated in the Nielsen ratings by CBS&#x27; &quot;The Edge of Night&quot; and ABC&#x27;s &quot;One Life to Live&quot;. Actress Gail Kobe, a regular on &quot;Bright Promise,&quot; would become &quot;Return&#x27;s&quot; executive producer.

==Cast==
Original cast members included the show&#x27;s star, Dana Andrews, with Susan Brown, Paul Lukather, Ruth McDevitt, Ivor Francis, Forrest Compton, Richard Eastham, Betsy Jones-Moreland, Coleen Gray, Gary Pillar, Peter Hobbs, Peter Ratray, Pat Woodell, Susannah Darrow, Cheryl Miller, and Eric James. Later additions included David Lewis, Annette O&#x27;Toole, Dabney Coleman, Marion Brash, Anne Seymour, Anthony Geary, Gail Kobe, John Considine, Philip Carey, Anne Jeffreys and Sherry Alberoni.

==History==
The first organised inhabitation of the area was recorded in 1263 as &quot;Kaseg&quot; or &quot;Kasezi&quot;. The name &quot;Gospić&quot; is first mentioned in 1604, which likely originates from the Croatian word for &quot;lady&quot; (&quot;gospa&quot;) or another archaic form, &quot;gospava&quot;.

During the Ottoman wars in Europe, Gospić was for a time ruled by the Ottoman Empire as part of Sanjak of Lika initially in Rumeli Eyalet (1528–1580), later in Bosnia Eyalet (1580–1686). Today&#x27;s town was built around two Ottoman forts (the towers of Aga Senković and of Aga Alić).

The Turkish incursion was repelled by the end of the 17th century and Gospić became an administrative centre of the Lika region within the Military Frontier, a section of the Habsburg monarchy organized as defense against the Ottomans. Before 1850, there are references to the town as &quot;Gospich&quot; in German. Since this time, there&#x27;s been a significant population of ethnic Serbs in the Gospić region.

Scientist and inventor Nikola Tesla, of Serb descent, was born in the nearby village of Smiljan and grew up in Gospić between 1862 and 1870, when he moved to Karlovac. He again lived in Smiljan between 1873 and 1879, when he briefly returned to Gospić until 1880 when he went to Graz.

In the 19th century, Gospić was the headquarters of Military Frontier &quot;Likaner Regiment&quot; N° I. Following the compromise of 1867, it became part of the Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia. In the late 19th century and early 20th century, Gospić was part of the Lika-Krbava County.

During the Genocide of Serbs in the Independent State of Croatia in WWII, the district of Gospić experienced the first large-scale massacres which occurred in the Lika region, as some 3,000 Serb civilians were killed between late July and early August 1941. A concentration camp was established in Gospić in which (together with other camps that belonged to the same complex) the Ustaše might have killed between 24,000-42,000 people, most of them being Serbs and Jews, but some of the prisoners were also Croatian.

In the 1990s, during the course of the Croatian War of Independence, Gospić suffered greatly during the Battle of Gospić. The town was held by Croatian government forces throughout the war, while the rebel Serb forces of the Republic of Serbian Krajina occupied positions directly to the east and often bombarded the town from there. In late 1991, the town was the site of the Gospić massacre, where between 100-120 predominantly Serb civilians were killed by Croatian military units. In February 1992, a statue of Nikola Tesla in downtown Gospić was destroyed in an explosion. The perpetrators were never apprehended. Control of the area finally devolved to the Croatian government with the success of Operation Storm in August 1995.

Gospić is the third smallest seat of a county government in Croatia. Its status as the county capital helped to spur some development in it, but the town as well as the entire region have suffered a constant decrease in population over the last several decades. 

Gospić is also the site of one of the regional branches of the Croatian State Archives, the &quot;Državni arhiv Gospić&quot;, at Kaniška 17. It was founded 30 September 1999 and officially opened 1 September 2000 in a renovated building and now houses historical documents of relevance to the Lika-Senj region which were formerly housed in the Regional Archive at Karlovac.

In 2013, Croatian Prime Minister Zoran Milanović urged the town&#x27;s authorities to allow for a replica of the Tesla statue that had been destroyed in 1992 to be reinstated. The mayor of Gospić at the time, Milan Kolić, refused to give his approval for such a move and instead vowed to erect a statue of wartime Croatian President Franjo Tuđman on the spot where the Tesla statue had once stood. In 2021, under mayor Karlo Starčević, the town renamed a square after Tesla, and the Croatian Ministry of Culture sponsored a new statue on the square, a replica of the Frano Kršinić original.

<doc id="923496" wikidata="Q242101" url="?curid=923496" title="Kató Lomb">
<text>Kató Lomb (8 February 19099 June 2003) was a Hungarian interpreter, translator and one of the first simultaneous interpreters in the world. 
Originally educated in chemistry and physics, her interest soon led her to languages. Native in Hungarian, she could interpret fluently in nine or ten languages (in four, without preparation), translated technical literature, and read belles-lettres in six languages. She understood journalism in a further 11 languages. She stated that she worked professionally with 16 languages (Bulgarian, Chinese, Danish, English, French, German, Hebrew, Italian, Japanese, Latin, Polish, Romanian, Russian, Slovak, Spanish and Ukrainian), which she learnt from self-study due to her interest in them.

According to her own account, her life was highlighted not primarily by her use of languages, but her study of them. This was described in her books, conversations and interviews. As an interpreter, she visited 40 countries on five continents, and documented her experiences in her book (&quot;Egy tolmács a világ körül&quot;, &quot;An Interpreter Around the World&quot; ).

==Languages==
In her interview with the &quot;Hetek&quot; newspaper (1998), Lomb listed the following 16 languages as those she worked in professionally:
:Bulgarian, Chinese, Danish, English, French, German, Hebrew, Italian, Japanese, Latin, Polish, Romanian, Russian, Slovak, Spanish, Ukrainian

In the foreword to the first edition of her book &quot;How I Learn Languages&quot; (1970), she wrote:
:&quot;I only have one mother tongue: Hungarian. Russian, English, French, and German live inside me simultaneously with Hungarian. I can switch between any of these languages with great ease, from one word to the next.
:Translating texts in Italian, Spanish, Japanese, Chinese, and Polish generally requires me to spend about half a day brushing up on my language skills and perusing the material to be translated.
:The other six languages I know only through translating literature and technical material.&quot;

In the fourth edition of &quot;How I Learn Languages&quot; (1995), she wrote:
:&quot;I would simply like to tell how I, over 25 years, got to the point of being able to speak 10 languages, translate technical documents and enjoy fiction in six more, and understand written journalism in 11 more or so.&quot;

In her book &quot;Harmony of Babel&quot; (1988), she wrote:
:&quot;How many languages do I speak? I have only one mother tongue: Hungarian. I speak Russian, German, English, and French well enough to be able to interpret or translate between any of them extemporaneously. I have to prepare a bit for Spanish, Italian, Japanese, Chinese, and Polish. At such times I leaf through the parts of my diaries written in these languages. I can read Swedish, Norwegian, Romanian, Portuguese, Dutch, Bulgarian, and Czech literature; I can translate their written—political or technical—texts.&quot;

Lomb cited Danish, Hebrew, Latin, Slovak and Ukrainian only in the &quot;Hetek&quot; interview, and Czech, Dutch, Norwegian, Portuguese and Swedish only in the &quot;Harmony of Babel.&quot; Altogether, she classified her languages as follows:
* Hungarian, English, German, French, and Russian, in which she felt truly proficient
* Italian, Spanish, Japanese, Chinese and Polish, in which she was able to interpret after some preparation
* Romanian and Bulgarian, at lower levels of proficiency
* Five more languages, mentioned in both places (see above)
…for a total of 22 languages.

In &quot;Polyglot: How I Learn Languages,&quot; she referred to more languages she also understood. Including these, she claimed to know at least 28 languages (including Hungarian) at least at a level enabling her to comprehend written texts, out of which she was able to interpret in ten.

According to her account, she acquired the languages above in this order: French (at elementary school, at the age of approx. 10–14); Latin (before and/or partly during her university studies); English (from 1933, on her own; this was when she developed her subsequent method of learning languages); Russian (from 1941, on her own; enabled her to understand Ukrainian, as well as Bulgarian to some extent); Romanian (on her own); Chinese (approx. from 1950, in two years, at a university course); Polish (around 1955, at a course); Japanese (from 1956, on her own); Czech (1954, on her own; similar to Slovak); Italian (on her own, after some antecedents in the 1940s); Spanish (in the second half of the 1960s, on her own); German.

==Learning method and principles==
Lomb&#x27;s guiding principle was &quot;interest&quot;: The word, coming from Latin &quot;interesse&quot; (originally meaning &quot;to be between&quot;), has a double meaning, referring to the material profit or the mental attraction, together: &quot;motivation&quot;. She wrote, &quot;This means that I can answer these questions: How much am I interested in it? What do I want with it? What does it mean for me? What good is it for me?&quot; She didn&#x27;t believe in natural &quot;language talent&quot;. She tended to express the language skill and its fruitfulness with a fraction, with &quot;motivation&quot; in the numerator (as well as &quot;invested time—&quot;although, as she wrote, &quot;If there is true motivation, one can pinch off some ten minutes a day even with the busiest job&quot;), and &quot;inhibition&quot; in the denominator (the fear of starting to speak, of being clumsy, of being laughed at). In her conviction, the stronger the motivation, and the more one could put aside inhibition, the sooner one could possess a language.

As she put it, she drove three &quot;auto&quot;s in the world of languages, namely autolexia, autographia and autologia. (from Greek, &quot;auto-&quot; meaning &quot;self&quot;, and &quot;-lexia&quot;, &quot;-graphia&quot; and &quot;-logia&quot; referring to reading, writing and speaking respectively.) &quot;Autolexia&quot; means reading for myself: the book I discover by myself, which provides novelties again and again, which I can take with me anywhere, which won&#x27;t get tired of being asked questions. &quot;Autographia&quot; means writing for myself, when I try to write about my thoughts, experiences, everyday things in the very language I&#x27;m just learning, no matter if it&#x27;s silly, no matter if it&#x27;s incorrect, no matter if a word or two is left out. &quot;Autologia&quot; means speaking with myself, when I try to express my thoughts or what I see on the street in the language I&#x27;m studying, when I keep on chatting to myself.

Even she was bored with the fabricated dialogues of coursebooks, so her favourite method was to obtain an original novel in a language completely unknown to her, whose topic she personally found interesting (a detective story, a love story, or even a technical description would do), and that was how she deciphered, unravelled the basics of the language: the essence of the grammar and the most important words. She didn&#x27;t let herself be set back by rare or complicated expressions: she skipped them, saying: what is important will sooner or later emerge again and will explain itself if necessary. (&quot;It&#x27;s much more of a problem if the book becomes flavourless in our hands due to the many interruptions than not learning if the inspector watches the murderer from behind a blackthorn or a hawthorn.&quot;) So we don&#x27;t really need to look up each and every word in the dictionary: it only spoils our mood from the joy of reading and discovering the texts. In any case, what we can remember is what we have figured out ourselves. For this purpose, she always bought her own copies of books, since while reading she wrote on the edge of the pages what she had understood from the text by herself. This way one cannot avoid picking up something of a language—as one can&#x27;t rest until one has learnt who the murderer is, or whether the girl says yes in the end. (This method was, incidentally, applied successfully even before her, by a Hungarian writer, Dezső Kosztolányi as well: according to his account, he studied Portuguese practically exactly the same way during a holiday of his.)

Another keyword of hers was &quot;&quot; (she was playfully called &quot;Kati Kontext&quot; herself): on the one hand, in understanding a text (be it a book or a heard text) the context is relevant, it can help us several times if we don&#x27;t understand something; on the other hand, she never studied words separately, isolated, but they either remained in her mind based on the text she read or the context she encountered, or she memorized them embedded in phrases (e.g. &quot;high wind&quot;, &quot;keen wind&quot;), so if one comes to forget one of them, the other word often used together with it will trigger the former. From adjectival phrases we can even recall the gender in many cases. Kató Lomb recommended using patterns, templates, &quot;shoemaker&#x27;s lasts&quot; or &quot;cookie-cutters&quot; elsewhere as well: these are simple, skeletonized sample sentences for a structure or an idiom, elements which can be inserted into the speech like prefabricated slabs (generally in the first person singular), by applying them we can more easily construct even fairly complicated structures.

She didn&#x27;t let herself be put off from her set objective by mistakes, failures or the ceaseless demand of perfection, but she always clung to the joyful, enjoyable side of language studies—maybe that&#x27;s where her success lay. She besieged the fortress of language again and again in a thousand and one ways. Her saying may be useful for those less confident of themselves: &quot;Language is the only thing worth knowing even poorly&quot; (in Hungarian: &quot;A nyelv az egyetlen, amit rosszul is érdemes tudni&quot;).

==Quotes==

Szilard Kato, the daughter of a prominent local physician, was born and raised in Pecs, where she went to the University to earn her degrees. She moved to Budapest after age 21, where she met and married Laub (later the family changed the name to Lomb) Frigyes, an engineer from a prominent family of electrical engineers. As a young adult, she became interested in other languages while in the family&#x27;s bomb shelter as Russian troops were advancing on Budapest. She was quoted by her family as having said the following: &quot;Kids, we are going to have to learn Russian now...&quot;. She managed to acquire a Russian typewriter and started learning the language. This single step started her on the road to a long and illustrious career in languages. As the Russian liberation unfolded, she served for a time as the translator for the Russian Commander of Budapest. In later years she became a professional interpreter. She acquired high levels of proficiency in 17 languages without extended stays in the countries where the languages were spoken. I interviewed Dr. Lomb (her PhD was in Chemistry) in depth ten years ago in Budapest. She attributed her success to massive amounts of comprehensible input, mostly through recreational reading. She was personally very interested in grammar and linguistics but felt they played a small role in language acquisition, loved dictionaries but looked up words when she read only if the word re-appeared several times and she still did not understand it, and hated to be corrected: &quot;Error correction makes you sick to your stomach.&quot;

About six years ago I met a woman in Hungary named Lomb Kato, a professional translator who had acquired 17 languages. At the time we met she was 86. Her last words to me changed my life: &quot;Stephen, you are so young. So many years left, so many languages to acquire!&quot; (I was 54 at the time.) What an inspiration! Since then I have plunged back into second language acquisition.

<doc id="923497" wikidata="Q15040823" url="?curid=923497" title="Revolt in the Stars">
<text>Revolt in the Stars is a science fiction film screenplay written by Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard in 1977. It tells the space opera story of how an evil galactic dictator, named Xenu, massacres many of his subjects by transporting them to Earth and killing them with atomic bombs. L. Ron Hubbard had already presented this story to his followers, as a true account of events that happened 75 million years ago, in a secret level of Scientology scripture called Operating Thetan, Level III. The screenplay was promoted around Hollywood circles in 1979, but attempts at fundraising and obtaining financing fell through, and the film was never made. Unofficial copies circulate on the internet.

==Plot==
In the screenplay&#x27;s story, which takes place 75 million years before modern times, an evil galactic ruler, named Xenu, massacres millions of people with assistance from Chu, the Executive President of the Galactic Interplanetary Bank, and Chi, the Galactic Minister of Police. Xenu&#x27;s psychiatric advisers, Stug and Sty, help him gather &quot;unwanted&quot; beings from all of the planets in his control and transport them to Earth. The beings are stacked around the bases of Earth&#x27;s volcanoes including Loa, Mount Vesuvius, Mount Shasta, Mount Fuji, Mount Etna and others, and exterminated by detonating planted charges of atomic bombs. In his script, Hubbard wrote: &quot;great winds raced simultaneously across the face of Earth, spreading tales of destruction...&quot; Xenu&#x27;s massacre of these beings is called &quot;Phase III.&quot; A character named Mish is one of the only &quot;Loyal Officers&quot; who survives Xenu&#x27;s organized massacre, and other characters include Lady Min and a hero figure, Rawl.

==Connection to Scientology teachings==
The story of &quot;Revolt in the Stars&quot; provides a dramatized account of events which Hubbard said took place 75 million years ago. In Scientology space opera theology, the villain Xenu (or &quot;Xemu&quot;) addressed an over-population problem in his Galactic Confederacy by trapping beings, flying them to the volcanoes of Earth, then known as &quot;Teegeeack&quot;, and exterminating all of them by detonating hydrogen bombs. The spirits, which Hubbard refers to as &quot;thetans,&quot; were trapped in frozen alcohol and glycol and implanted with bizarre imagery. According to the story, they subsequently became attached to present-day human beings, in the form of &quot;body thetans.&quot; Scientology teachings identify this event as &quot;Incident II.&quot; Scientologists learn from OT III that by removing body thetans, they can progress spiritually and free themselves of problems. Belief in the reality of Xenu and body thetans is a condition for progressing beyond OT III along Scientology&#x27;s Bridge to Total Freedom.

==Development==
Hubbard wrote the screenplay in 1977, while living in seclusion in Sparks, Nevada with three members of the Commodore&#x27;s Messenger Organization from the Church of Scientology. He went into seclusion in July 1977, and by December of that year, he had finished his work on the 140-page screenplay and was ready to begin the production of a film version. &quot;Revolt in the Stars&quot; was registered as a screenplay with the United States Copyright Office in November 1977, with Diana Meredith DeWolf Hubbard, Hubbard&#x27;s daughter, listed as copyright claimant, and registered for release as a novel in May 1978, with Hubbard himself as the claimant. A former Scientologist and Sea Org member told the &quot;Los Angeles Business Journal&quot; that Hubbard intended to distribute the film publicly so that people inhabited with thetans would become &quot;restimulated and upset,&quot; and be motivated to learn more about Scientology. Hubbard moved to the Scientology facilities at La Quinta, California and began production on Scientology training films which demonstrated the practice of auditing. A ranch in Indio, California was purchased in addition to a ranch called Silver. The Tech films were produced at the Silver location, and by 1980 Hubbard had made plans to film &quot;Revolt in the Stars&quot; and publicize the Scientology OT III theology.

Hubbard&#x27;s screenplay for &quot;Revolt in the Stars&quot; was passed around Hollywood in 1978. A production company called &quot;A Brilliant Film Company&quot; and also called &quot;Brilliant Films&quot; announced plans, in October 1979, to produce &quot;Revolt in the Stars&quot; as an independent film production. The &quot;New York Post&quot; reported that the film had a $49 million budget, and was described as &quot;a science fiction thriller.&quot; Bent Corydon writes in &quot;L. Ron Hubbard: Messiah or Madman?&quot; that millions of dollars in funding for film production of &quot;Revolt in the Stars&quot; was raised from investors, but he adds: &quot;highly questionable methods of fund raising brought the project to a halt.&quot; Efforts to promote the screenplay and get it developed as a film were unsuccessful, and Hubbard focused on writing &quot;Man, the Endangered Species&quot; which later became the novel &quot;Battlefield Earth.&quot; This &quot;was&quot; produced as a feature film in 2000, starring John Travolta as one of the villains, but it drew hostile critical response and performed poorly at the box office.

Author Services Inc., the for profit subsidiary company of the Church of Spiritual Technology, controls development of &quot;Revolt in the Stars&quot; in addition to Hubbard&#x27;s other writings. In a 1983 press release announcing that the independent feature film company Salem Productions Inc. had acquired motion picture and ancillary rights to &quot;Battlefield Earth&quot; in a deal with Author Services Inc., &quot;Revolt in the Stars&quot; is listed as one of Hubbard&#x27;s &quot;classics.&quot; Copyright was transferred in 1993 with the Church of Spiritual Technology and trustee for L. Ron Hubbard, Norman F. Starkey, listed as parties. Scientologist and actor John Travolta was involved in developing &quot;Battlefield Earth&quot; into a film of the same name, and in 1996 &quot;New York Daily News&quot; wrote of reports that he also wanted to develop &quot;Revolt in the Stars&quot; into a film. According to the website Operation Clambake, a synopsis of the screenplay was posted to the newsgroup alt.religion.scientology in 1995. Scientology critic Grady Ward published a summary of the material. &quot;The Oxford Handbook of New Religious Movements&quot; notes that &quot;Revolt in the Stars&quot; remains one of Hubbard&#x27;s unpublished science fiction works but unofficial copies circulate on the internet, and this is confirmed in &quot;The Encyclopedic Sourcebook of UFO Religions&quot; and &quot;New Religions: A Guide&quot;.

==Analysis==
In &quot;The Encyclopedic Sourcebook of UFO Religions&quot;, James R. Lewis cites &quot;Revolt in the Stars&quot; when comparing Hubbard&#x27;s science fiction works to Scientology. &quot;Scientology in itself would also be an interesting case for studying &#x27;ufological&#x27; strands - e.g., the relation between L. Ron Hubbard&#x27;s science fiction novels and the Whole Track mythology, which is probably most evident in the case of Hubbard&#x27;s unpublished novel &quot;Revolt in the Stars,&quot;&quot; writes Lewis. &quot;Revolt in the Stars&quot; is cited in &quot;New Religions: A Guide,&quot; in a subsection on &quot;Non apocalyptic ufology&quot;: &quot;According to Scientology, a fierce intergalactic ruler named &#x27;Xenu&#x27; carried the thetans to Earth.&quot; The author finds it interesting that L. Ron Hubbard explored the story of the &quot;ancient ruler Xenu&quot; further in the form of &quot;Revolt in the Stars.&quot;

&quot;The Washington Post&quot; reported that &quot;The plot of &#x27;Revolt&#x27; mirrors a sacred Scientology text called &#x27;OT III.&#x27;&quot; Former Scientologist Gerry Armstrong said that the screenplay story is identical to the Scientology space opera theology, and in his book &quot;Bare-faced Messiah&quot; author Russell Miller described &quot;Revolt in the Stars&quot; as &quot;...a dramatization of high-level Scientology training about events which happened seventy-five million years ago when an evil ruler by the name of Xenu massacred the populations of seventy-six planets, transported their frozen spirits back to earth and exploded them in volcanoes.&quot;

Jim Emerson, editor of the Roger Ebert website previously hosted by the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times,&quot; compared elements of the Xenu story and &quot;Revolt in the Stars&quot; to the 2005 film remake &quot;War of the Worlds&quot; starring Scientologist Tom Cruise. Emerson noted that some critics drew parallels between &quot;War of the Worlds&quot; and Scientology mythology. In a January 2008 article in &quot;Frankfurter Rundschau,&quot; Christian Schlüter commented on the screenplay and recounted the Xenu story. Schlüter wrote that the Scientology mythology was appropriate for cinema and fit into the environment of Hollywood.

<text>Acquanetta (born July 17, 1921 – August 16, 2004), nicknamed &quot;The Venezuelan Volcano&quot;, was an American B-movie actress during the 1940s and 1950s. Acquanetta was most known for her &quot;exotic&quot; beauty.

==Early years==
The facts of Acquanetta&#x27;s origins are not known with certainty. Although accounts differ (some giving her birth-name as Mildred Davenport, from Norristown, Pennsylvania), Acquanetta claimed she was born Burnu Acquanetta, meaning &quot;Burning Fire/Deep Water&quot;, in Ozone, Wyoming. Orphaned from her Arapaho parents when she was two (or three), she lived briefly with another family before being taken in by an artistic couple with whom she remained until she made the choice to live independently at the age of fifteen. Other accounts suggest she was a light-skinned African American who concealed her heritage due to the racial discrimination of the era. Her career was followed closely by the African American press. In 1942, &quot;Life&quot; magazine noted her mysterious origins, but reported that she had lived with a Spanish family in Spanish Harlem posing as a Venezuelan before moving to Mexico, then Venezuela to obtain citizenship. The article suggests that the Arapaho orphan story was invented because she was unable to produce any identification for the Screen Actors Guild.

According to the 1940 US Census, she had five siblings, including a sister, Kathryn Davenport, and a brother, Horace Davenport, who was, according to the Pennsylvania Bar Association, &quot;the first African-American judge in Montgomery County.&quot;

==Film career==
Acquanetta started her career as a model in New York City with Harry Conover and John Robert Powers. She signed with Universal Studios in 1942 and acted mostly in B-movies, including &quot;Arabian Nights&quot;, &quot;The Sword of Monte Cristo&quot;, &quot;Captive Wild Woman&quot; and &quot;Jungle Woman&quot;, in which Universal attempted to create a female monster movie series with Acquanetta as a transformative ape. After her contract with Universal expired, Acquanetta signed on with Monogram Pictures but did not appear in any movies; she then signed with RKO where she acted in her only big-budget movie, &quot;Tarzan and the Leopard Woman&quot;.

==Personal life==
In 1947, Acquanetta and &quot;Mexican-Jewish millionaire&quot; Luciano Baschuk had a son, Sergei (variously Sergio), who died of cancer in 1952 at age five, after the couple&#x27;s bitter divorce in 1950, where she lost her suit for half his fortune when no record of their marriage could be produced. In 1950, Acquanetta married painter and illustrator Henry Clive, who was 40 years her senior, and returned to acting. The couple were divorced in 1953. That year she retired from films and became a disk jockey for radio station KPOL (AM) in Los Angeles.

By 1955 she had married Jack Ross, a car dealer who later ran for governor of Arizona in 1970 and 1974. The couple settled in Mesa, Arizona, and she returned to a degree of celebrity by appearing with Ross in his local television advertisements, and also by hosting a local television show called &quot;Acqua&#x27;s Corner&quot; that accompanied the Friday late-night movies. The couple were prominent citizens, donating to the Phoenix Symphony and the construction of Mesa Lutheran Hospital and founding Stagebrush Theatre. She and Ross had four sons together, Lance, Tom, Jack Jr. and Rex, before divorcing in the early 1980s. In 1987, Acquanetta sold the Mesa Grande ruins to the city of Mesa. An apocryphal Phoenix legend has Acquanetta, upon learning of her husband&#x27;s infidelity, filling the interior of his Lincoln Continental convertible with concrete.

Acquanetta wrote a book of poetry, published in 1974, titled &quot;The Audible Silence&quot;. She did not smoke, and did not drink alcohol, tea, or coffee.

Acquanetta succumbed to complications of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease on August 16, 2004, at Hawthorn Court in Ahwatukee, Arizona. She was 83. She is buried in Paradise Memorial Gardens in East Shea, Scottsdale, Arizona.

==In popular culture==

In 1987, the all-female band The Aquanettas adopted (and adapted) their name from hers.

Acquanetta&#x27;s obituary inspired the composer Michael Gordon to collaborate with librettist Deborah Artman on the opera &quot;Acquanetta&quot; (2005/2017). Produced by Beth Morrison Projects, the chamber version received its world premiere at the Prototype Festival in Brooklyn, New York, in January 2018.

== Opera ==

&quot;Acquanetta&quot;, based on her life, premiered as a Grand Opera in 2006 in Aachen, Germany. The chamber version of &quot;Acquanetta&quot; had its world premiere at the 2018 Prototype Festival, followed by a subsequent run at Bard SummerScape in 2019.

<text>On the International Space Station (ISS), extravehicular activities are major events in the building and maintaining of the orbital laboratory, and are performed to install new components, re-wire systems, modules, and equipment, and to monitor, install, and retrieve scientific experiments.

Due to the complexity of building a station in space, space agencies train astronauts extensively, preparing them to encounter surprises during spacewalks, teaching them how to assemble special tools and equipment, and carefully coordinating every activity during spacewalks. From 1998 to 2005, thirty-seven Space Shuttle missions were scheduled to assemble, outfit and begin experiments and research aboard the station.

The initial spacewalk to begin the assembly of the International Space Station was held on 7 December 1998, following the launch of the first section of the station, &quot;Zarya&quot;, from Baikonur Cosmodrome, Kazakhstan, on 20 November 1998. The spacewalk attached the U.S.-built &quot;Unity&quot; node to &quot;Zarya&quot;. The longest spacewalk was performed on 11 March 2001, when STS-102 crew members Susan J. Helms and James S. Voss conducted a full spacewalk, and then returned to the airlock, but remained in their suits ready to exit the airlock again in case the robotics operations ran into problems. The total time for that spacewalk was eight hours and fifty-six minutes.

As of 2 December 2021, there have been 245 spacewalks devoted to assembly and maintenance of the International Space Station totaling 1548 hours and 26 minutes. Thirty-seven of those spacewalks were performed from a shuttle, ninety-three from the Quest Joint Airlock, thirty-two from the &quot;Pirs&quot; docking compartment, and two from the transfer compartment at the forward end of the &quot;Zvezda&quot; service module.
