<text>Ion Creangă (; March 1, 1837 – December 31, 1889), also known as Nică al lui Ștefan a Petrei and Ioan Ștefănescu, was a Moldovan nationalist, writer, raconteur and schoolteacher. A main figure in 19th-century Romanian literature, he is best known for his &quot;Childhood Memories&quot; volume, his novellas and short stories, and his many anecdotes. Creangă&#x27;s main contribution to fantasy and children&#x27;s literature includes narratives structured around eponymous protagonists (&quot;Harap Alb&quot;, &quot;Ivan Turbincă&quot;, &quot;Dănilă Prepeleac&quot;, &quot;Stan Pățitul&quot;), as well as fairy tales indebted to conventional forms (&quot;The Story of the Pig&quot;, &quot;The Goat and Her Three Kids&quot;, &quot;The Mother with Three Daughters-in-Law&quot;, &quot;The Old Man&#x27;s Daughter and the Old Woman&#x27;s Daughter&quot;). Widely seen as masterpieces of the Romanian language and local humor, his writings occupy the middle ground between a collection of folkloric sources and an original contribution to a literary realism of rural inspiration. They are accompanied by a set of contributions to erotic literature, collectively known as his &quot;corrosives&quot;.

A defrocked Romanian Orthodox priest with an unconventional lifestyle, Creangă made an early impact as an innovative educator and textbook author, while pursuing a short career in nationalist politics with the Free and Independent Faction. His literary debut came late in life, closely following the start of his close friendship with Romania&#x27;s national poet Mihai Eminescu and their common affiliation with the influential conservative literary society &quot;Junimea&quot;. Although viewed with reserve by many of his colleagues there, and primarily appreciated for his records of oral tradition, Creangă helped propagate the group&#x27;s cultural guidelines in an accessible form. Later critics have often described him, alongside Eminescu, Ion Luca Caragiale and Ioan Slavici, as one of the most accomplished representatives of &quot;Junimist&quot; literature.

Ion Creangă was posthumously granted several honors, and is commemorated by a number of institutions in both Romania and neighboring Moldova. These include the &quot;Bojdeuca&quot; building in Iași, which, in 1918, was opened as the first memorial house in Romania. His direct descendants include Horia Creangă, one of the leading Romanian architects during the interwar period.

==Biography==

===Background and family===
Ion Creangă was born in Humulești in the Principality of Moldavia, a former village which has since been incorporated into Târgu Neamț city, the on of Orthodox trader Ștefan sin Petre Ciubotariul and his wife Smaranda. His native area, bordering on heavily forested areas, was in the Eastern Carpathian foothills, and included into what was then the Principality of Moldavia. The surrounding region&#x27;s population preserved an archaic way of life, dominated by shepherding, textile manufacturing and related occupations, and noted for preserving the older forms of local folklore. Another characteristic of the area, which left an impression on Creangă&#x27;s family history, was related to the practice of transhumance and the links between ethnic Romanian communities on both sides of the mountains, in Moldavia and Transylvania: on his maternal side, the writer descended from Maramureș-born peasants, while, according to literary historian George Călinescu, his father&#x27;s origin may have been further southwest, in Transylvania-proper.

The family had reached a significant position within their community: Ștefan sin Petre had made a steady income from his itinerant trade in wool, while his wife was the descendant of the Creangăs of Pipirig, a family of community leaders. The latter&#x27;s members included Moldavian Metropolitan Iacob Stamati, as well as Smaranda&#x27;s father, &quot;Vornic&quot; David, and her uncle Ciubuc Clopotarul, a monk at Neamț Monastery. Proud of this tradition, she insisted that her son pursue a career in the Church. According to his own recollection, the future writer was born on March 1, 1837—a date which has since been challenged. Creangă&#x27;s other statements mention March 2, 1837, or an unknown date in 1836. The exactitude of other accounts is equally unreliable: community registers from the period gave the date of June 10, 1839, and mention another child of the same name being born to his parents on February 4, 1842 (the more probable birth date of Creangă&#x27;s younger brother Zahei). The imprecision also touches other aspects of his family life: noting the resulting conflicts in data, Călinescu decided that it was not possible for one to know if the writer&#x27;s parents were married to each other (and, if so, if they were on their first marriage), nor how many children they had together. At a time when family names were not legally required, and people were primarily known by various nicknames and patronymics, the boy was known to the community as &quot;Nică&quot;, a hypocorism formed from &quot;Ion&quot;, or more formally as &quot;Nică al lui Ștefan a Petrei&quot; (&quot;Nică of Ștefan of Petru&quot;, occasionally &quot;Nic-a lui Ștefan a Petrei&quot;).

===Childhood, youth and ordination===

After an idyllic period, which is recounted in the first section of his &quot;Childhood Memories&quot;, Ion Creangă was sent to primary school, an institution then in the care of Orthodox Church authorities, where he became noted for his rebellious attitude and appetite for truancy. Among his colleagues was a female student, Smărăndița popii (known later as Smaranda Posea), for whom he developed an affection which lasted into his adult life, over decades in which the two no longer saw each other. He was taught reading and writing in Cyrillic alphabet through peer tutoring techniques, before the overseeing teacher, Vasile Ilioaiei, was lassoed off the street and conscripted by the Moldavian military at some point before 1848. After another teacher, whom the &quot;Memories&quot; portray as a drunk, died from cholera in late 1848, David Creangă withdrew his grandson from the local school and took him to a similar establishment in Broșteni, handing him into the care of a middle-aged woman, Irinuca. Ion Creangă spent several months at Irinuca&#x27;s remote house on the Bistrița River, before the proximity of goats resulted in a scabies infection and his hastened departure for Pipirig, where he cured himself using birch extract, a folk remedy mastered by his maternal grandmother Nastasia.

After returning to school between late 1849 and early 1850, Creangă was pulled out by his financially struggling father, spent the following period working in wool-spinning, and became known by the occupational nickname &quot;Torcălău&quot; (&quot;Spinster&quot;). He only returned in third grade some four years later, having been sent to the Târgu Neamț public school, newly founded by Moldavian Prince Grigore Alexandru Ghica as part of the &quot;Regulamentul Organic&quot; string of reforms. A colleague of future philosopher Vasile Conta in the class of priest and theologian Isaia &quot;Popa Duhu&quot; Teodorescu, Creangă was sent to the Fălticeni seminary in 1854. After having been registered as &quot;Ioan Ștefănescu&quot; (a variant of his given name and a family name based on his patronymic), the adolescent student eventually adopted his maternal surname of &quot;Creangă&quot;. According to Călinescu, this was done either &quot;for aesthetic reasons&quot; (as his new name, literally meaning &quot;branch&quot; or &quot;bough&quot;, &quot;sounds good&quot;) or because of a likely discovery that Ștefan was not his real father. Dan Grădinaru, a researcher of Creangă&#x27;s work, believes that the writer had a special preference for the variant &quot;Ioan&quot;, generally used in more learned circles, instead of the variant &quot;Ion&quot; that was consecrated by his biographers.

Having witnessed, according to his own claim, the indifference and mundane preoccupations of his peers, Creangă admitted to having taken little care in his training, submitting to the drinking culture, playing practical jokes on his colleagues, and even shoplifting, while pursuing an affair with the daughter of a local priest. According to his own statement, he was a philanderer who, early in his youth, had already &quot;caught the scent&quot; of the &quot;catrință&quot; (the skirt in traditional costumes). In August 1855, circumstances again forced him to change schools: confronted with the closure of his Fălticeni school, Creangă left for the Central Seminary attached to Socola Monastery, in Moldavia&#x27;s capital of Iași. Ștefan sin Petre&#x27;s 1858 death left him without means of support, and he requested being directly ordained, but, not being of the necessary age, was instead handed a certificate to attest his school attendance. He was soon after married, after a brief courtship, to the 15-year-old Ileana, daughter of Priest Ioan Grigoriu from the church of the Forty Saints, where he is believed to have been in training as a schoolteacher. The ceremony took place in August 1859, several months after the personal union between Moldavia and its southern neighbor Wallachia, effected by the election of Alexandru Ioan Cuza as &quot;Domnitor&quot;. Having been employed as a cantor by his father in law&#x27;s church, he was ordained in December of the same year, assigned to the position of deacon in Holy Trinity Church, and, in May 1860, returned to Forty Saints.

Relations between Creangă and Grigoriu were exceptionally tense. Only weeks after his wedding, the groom, who had probably agreed to marriage only because it could facilitate succeeding Grigoriu, signed a complaint addressed to Metropolitan Sofronie Miclescu, denouncing his father in law as &quot;a killer&quot;, claiming to have been mistreated by him and cheated out of his wife&#x27;s dowry, and demanding to be allowed a divorce. The response to this request was contrary to his wishes: he was ordered into isolation by the &quot;Dicasterie&quot;, the supreme ecclesiastical court, being allowed to go free only on promise to reconcile with Grigoriu.

===Beginnings as schoolteacher and clash with the Orthodox Church===

In 1860, Creangă enlisted at the Faculty of Theology, part of the newly founded University of Iași, and, in December 1860, fathered a son, Constantin. His life still lacked in stability, and he decided to move out of Grigoriu&#x27;s supervision and into Bărboi Church, before his position as deacon was cut out of the budget and his belongings were evicted out of his temporary lodging in 1864. He contemplated leaving the city, and even officially requested a new assignment in the more remote Bolgrad. Since January 1864, when the Faculty of Theology had been closed down, he had been attending Iași&#x27;s Trei Ierarhi Monastery normal school (&quot;Trisfetite&quot; or &quot;Trei Sfetite&quot;), where he first met the young cultural figure Titu Maiorescu, who served as his teacher and supervisor, and whence he graduated as the first in his class (June 1865). Embittered by his own experience with the education system, Creangă became an enthusiastic promoter of Maiorescu&#x27;s ideas on education reform and modernization, and in particular of the new methods of teaching reading and writing. During and after completing normal school, he was assigned to teaching positions at Trisfetite. While there, he earned the reputation of a demanding teacher (notably by accompanying his reports on individual students with characterizations such as &quot;idiot&quot;, &quot;impertinent&quot; or &quot;envious&quot;). Accounts from the period state that he made use of corporal punishment in disciplining his pupils, and even surpassed the standards of violence accepted at the time.

In parallel, he was beginning his activities in support of education reform. By 1864, he and several others, among them schoolteacher V. Răceanu, were working on a new primer, which saw print in 1868 under the title &quot;Metodă nouă de scriere și cetire pentru uzul clasei I primară&quot; (&quot;A New Method of Writing and Reading for the Use of 1st Grade Primary Course Students&quot;). It mainly addressed the issues posed by the new Romanian alphabetical standard, a Romanization replacing Cyrillic spelling (which had been officially discarded in 1862). Largely based on Maiorescu&#x27;s principles, &quot;Metodă nouă ...&quot; became one the period&#x27;s most circulated textbooks. In addition to didactic texts, it also featured Creangă&#x27;s isolated debut in lyric poetry, with a naïve piece titled &quot;Păsărica în timpul iernii&quot; (&quot;The Little Bird in Wintertime&quot;). The book was followed in 1871 by another such work, published as &quot;Învățătoriul copiilor&quot; (&quot;The Children&#x27;s Teacher&quot;) and co-authored by V. Răceanu. It included several prose fables and a sketch story, &quot;Human Stupidity&quot;, to which later editions added &quot;Poveste&quot; (&quot;A Story&quot;) and &quot;Pâcală&quot; (a borrowing of the fictional folk character better known as &quot;Păcală&quot;).

In February 1866, having briefly served at Iași&#x27;s Pantelimon Church, he was welcomed by &quot;hegumen&quot; Isaia Vicol Dioclias into the service of Golia Monastery. Around 1867, his wife Ileana left him. After that moment, Creangă began losing interest in performing his duties in the clergy, and, while doing his best to hide that he was no longer living with his wife, took a mistress. The marriage&#x27;s breakup was later attributed by Creangă himself to Ileana&#x27;s adulterous affair with a Golia monk, and rumors spread that Ileana&#x27;s lover was a high-ranking official, the protopope of Iași. Creangă&#x27;s accusations, Călinescu contends, are nevertheless dubious, because the deacon persisted in working for the same monastery after the alleged incident.
By the second half of the 1860s, the future writer was also pursuing an interest in politics, which eventually led him to rally with the more nationalist group within the Romanian liberal current, known as Free and Independent Faction. An agitator for his party, Creangă became commonly known under the nickname &quot;Popa Smântână&quot; (&quot;Priest Sour Cream&quot;). In April 1866, shortly after &quot;Domnitor&quot; Cuza was toppled by a coup, and just before Carol I was selected to replace him, the Romanian Army intervened to quell a separatist riot in Iași, instigated by Moldavian Metropolitan Calinic Miclescu. It is likely that Creangă shared the outlook of other Factionalists, according to which secession was preferable to Carol&#x27;s rule, and was probably among the rioters. At around the same time, he began circulating antisemitic tracts, and is said to have demanded that Christians boycott Jewish business. He is thought to have coined the expression &quot;Nici un ac de la jidani&quot; (&quot;Not even a needle from the kikes&quot;). He was eventually selected as one of the Factionalist candidates for an Iași seat in the Romanian Deputies&#x27; Chamber, as documented by the memoirs of his conservative rival, Iacob Negruzzi. The episode is supposed to have taken place at the earliest during the 1871 suffrage.

By 1868, Creangă&#x27;s rebellious stance was irritating his hierarchical superiors, and, according to Călinescu, his consecutive actions show that he was &quot;going out of his way for scandal&quot;. He was initially punished for attending a Iași Theater performance, as well as for defiantly claiming that there was &quot;nothing scandalous or demoralizing&quot; in what he had seen, and reportedly further antagonized the monks by firing a gun to scare off the rooks nesting on his church. The latter incident, which some commentators believe fabricated by Creangă&#x27;s detractors, was judged absurd by the ecclesiastical authorities, who had been further alarmed by negative reporting in the press. When told that no clergyman other than him had been seen using a gun, Creangă issued a reply deemed &quot;Nasreddinesque&quot; by George Călinescu, maintaining that, unlike others, he was not afraid of doing so. Confronted by Metropolitan Calinic himself, Creangă allegedly argued that he could think of no other way to eliminate rooks, being eventually pardoned by the prelate when it was ruled that he had not infringed on canon law.

===Defrocking and the &quot;Bojdeuca&quot; years===

Creangă eventually moved out of the monastery, but refused to relinquish his key to the church basement, and, in what was probably a modernizing intent, chopped off his long hair, one of the traditional marks of an Orthodox priest. The latter gesture scandalized his superiors, particularly since Creangă explained himself using an ancient provision of canon law, which stipulated that priests were not supposed to grow their hair long. After some assessment, his superiors agreed not to regard this action as more than a minor disobedience. He was temporarily suspended in practice but, citing an ambiguity in the decision (which could be read as a banishment in perpetuity), Creangă considered himself defrocked. He relinquished his clerical clothing altogether and began wearing lay clothes everywhere, a matter which caused public outrage.

By then a teacher at the 1st School for Boys, on Română Street, Creangă was ordered out of his secular assignment in July 1872, when news of his status and attitude reached Education Minister Christian Tell. Upset by the circumstances, and objecting in writing on grounds that it did not refer to his teaching abilities, he fell back on income produced by a tobacconist&#x27;s shop he had established shortly before being dismissed. This stage marked a final development in Creangă&#x27;s conflict with the church hierarchy. Summoned to explain why he was living the life of a shopkeeper, he responded in writing by showing his unwillingness to apologize, and indicated that he would only agree to face secular courts. The virulent text notably accused the church officials of being his enemies on account of his &quot;independence, sincerity, honesty&quot; in supporting the cause of &quot;human dignity&quot;. After the gesture of defiance, the court recommended his defrocking, its decision being soon after confirmed by the synod.

In the meantime, Creangă moved into what he called &quot;Bojdeuca&quot; (or &quot;Bujdeuca&quot;, both being Moldavian regional speech for &quot;tiny hut&quot;), a small house located on the outskirts of Iași. Officially divorced in 1873, he was living there with his lover Ecaterina &quot;Tinca&quot; Vartic. A former laundress who had earlier leased one of the &quot;Bojdeuca&quot; rooms, she shared Creangă&#x27;s peasant-like existence. This lifestyle implied a number of eccentricities, such as the former deacon&#x27;s practice of wearing loose shirts throughout summer and bathing in a natural pond. His voracious appetite, called &quot;proverbial gluttony&quot; by George Călinescu, was attested by contemporary accounts. These depict him consuming uninterrupted successions of whole meals on a daily basis.

In May 1874, soon after taking over Minister of Education in the Conservative Party cabinet of Lascăr Catargiu, his friend Maiorescu granted Creangă the position of schoolteacher in the Iași area of Păcurari. During the same period, Ion Creangă met and became best friends with Mihai Eminescu, posthumously celebrated as Romania&#x27;s national poet. This is said to have taken place in summer 1875, when Eminescu was working as an inspector for Maiorescu&#x27;s Education Ministry, overseeing schools in Iași County: reportedly, Eminescu was fascinated with Creangă&#x27;s talents as a raconteur, while the latter admired Eminescu for his erudition.

===&quot;Junimea&quot; reception===

At around the same time, Creangă also began attending &quot;Junimea&quot;, an upper class literary club presided upon by Maiorescu, whose cultural and political prestige was increasing. This event, literary historian Z. Ornea argued, followed a time of indecision: as a former Factionalist, Creangă was a natural adversary of the mainstream &quot;Junimist&quot; &quot;cosmopolitan orientation&quot;, represented by both Maiorescu and Negruzzi, but was still fundamentally committed to Maiorescu&#x27;s agenda in the field of education. Literary historians Carmen-Maria Mecu and Nicolae Mecu also argue that, after attending &quot;Junimea&quot;, the author was able to assimilate some of its innovative teachings into his own style of pedagogy, and thus helped diffuse its message outside the purely academic environment.

The exact date of his reception is a mystery. According to Maiorescu&#x27;s own recollections, written some decades after the event, Creangă was in attendance at a &quot;Junimea&quot; meeting of 1871, during which Gheorghe Costaforu proposed to transform the club into a political party. The information was considered dubious by Z. Ornea, who argued that the episode may have been entirely invented by the &quot;Junimist&quot; leader, and noted that it contradicted both Negruzzi&#x27;s accounts and minutes kept by A. D. Xenopol. According to Ornea&#x27;s assessment, with the exception of literary critic Vladimir Streinu, all of Creangă&#x27;s biographers have come to dismiss Maiorescu&#x27;s statement. Several sources mention that the future writer was introduced to the society by Eminescu, who was an active member around 1875. This and other details lead Ornea to conclude that membership was granted to Creangă only after the summer break of 1875.

Gradually or instantly, Creangă made a positive impression by confirming with the &quot;Junimist&quot; ideal of authenticity. He also became treasured for his talkative and jocular nature, self-effacing references to himself as a &quot;peasant&quot;, and eventually his debut works, which became subjects of his own public readings. His storytelling soon earned him dedicated spectators, who deemed Creangă&#x27;s fictional universe a &quot;sack of wonders&quot; at a time when the author himself had started casually using the pseudonym &quot;Ioan Vântură-Țară&quot; (&quot;Ioan Gadabout&quot;). Although still in his forties, the newcomer was also becoming colloquially known to his colleagues as &quot;Moș Creangă&quot; (&quot;Old Man Creangă&quot; or &quot;Father Creangă&quot;), which was a sign of respect and sympathy. Among Ion Creangă&#x27;s most dedicated promoters were Eminescu, his former political rival Iacob Negruzzi, Alexandru Lambrior and Vasile Pogor, as well as the so-called &quot;caracudă&quot; (roughly, &quot;small game&quot;) section, which comprised &quot;Junimists&quot; who rarely took the floor during public debates, and who were avid listeners of his literary productions (it was to this latter gathering that Creangă later dedicated his erotic texts). In parallel to his diversified literary contribution, the former priest himself became a noted voice in &quot;Junimist&quot; politics, and, like his new friend Eminescu, voiced support for the group&#x27;s nationalist faction, in disagreement with the more cosmopolitan and aristocratic segment led by Maiorescu and Petre P. Carp. By that the late 1870s, he was secretly redirecting political support from the former Factionalists to his new colleagues, as confirmed by an encrypted letter he addressed to Negruzzi in March 1877.

===Literary consecration===
Autumn 1875 is also often described as his actual debut in fiction prose, with &quot;The Mother with Three Daughters-in-Law&quot;, a short story first publish in October by the club&#x27;s magazine &quot;Convorbiri Literare&quot;. In all, &quot;Convorbiri Literare&quot; would publish 15 works of fiction and the four existing parts of his &quot;Childhood Memories&quot; before Creangă&#x27;s death. Reportedly, the decision to begin writing down his stories had been the direct result of Eminescu&#x27;s persuasion. His talent for storytelling and its transformation into writing fascinated his new colleagues. Several among them, including poet Grigore Alexandrescu, tasked experimental psychologist Eduard Gruber with closely studying Creangă&#x27;s methods, investigations which produced a report evidencing Creangă&#x27;s laborious and physical approach to the creative process. The latter also involved his frequent exchanges of ideas with Vartic, in whom he found his primary audience. In addition to his fiction writing, the emerging author followed Maiorescu&#x27;s suggestion and, in 1876, published a work of educational methodology and the phonemic orthography favored by &quot;Junimea&quot;: &quot;Povățuitoriu la cetire prin scriere după sistema fonetică&quot; (&quot;Guide to Reading by Writing in the Phonetic System&quot;). It was supposed to become a standard textbook for the training of teachers, but was withdrawn from circulation soon afterward, when the Catargiu cabinet fell.

After losing his job as school inspector following the decisions of a hostile National Liberal executive, Mihai Eminescu spent much of his time in &quot;Bojdeuca&quot;, where he was looked after by the couple. For five months after quarreling with Samson Bodnărescu, his fellow poet and previous landlord, Eminescu even moved inside the house, where he reputedly pursued his discreet love affair with woman writer Veronica Micle, and completed as many as 22 of his poems. Creangă introduced his younger friend to a circle of companions which included Zahei Creangă, who was by then a cantor, as well as Răceanu, priest Gheorghe Ienăchescu, and clerk Nicșoi (all of whom, Călinescu notes, had come to share the raconteur&#x27;s lifestyle choices and his nationalist opinions). Eminescu was especially attracted by their variant of simple life, the rudimentary setting of Creangă&#x27;s house and the group&#x27;s bohemian escapades. Circumstances drew the two friends apart: by 1877, Eminescu had relocated in Bucharest, the capital city, regularly receiving letters in which Creangă was asking him to return. He was however against Eminescu&#x27;s plan to marry Veronica Micle, and made his objection known to the poet. In 1879, as a sign that he was formalizing his own affair with Tinca Vartic, Creangă purchased the &quot;Bojdeuca&quot; in her name, paying his former landlord 40 florins in exchange. That same year, he, Răceanu and Ienăchescu published the textbook &quot;Geografia județului Iași&quot; (&quot;The Geography of Iași County&quot;), followed soon after by a map of the same region, researched by Creangă and Răceanu. A final work in the area of education followed in 1880, as a schoolteacher&#x27;s version of Maiorescu&#x27;s study of Romanian grammar, &quot;Regulile limbei române&quot; (&quot;Rules of the Romanian Language&quot;).

===Illness and death===
By the 1880s, Creangă had epilepsy with accelerated and debilitating episodes. He was also severely overweight, weighing some 120 kilograms (over 250 pounds), with a height of 1.85 meters (6 feet), and being teasingly nicknamed &quot;Burduhănosul&quot; (&quot;Tubby&quot;) by his friends (although, according to testimonies by his son and daughter-in-law, he did not actually look his size).

Despite his activity being much reduced, he still kept himself informed about the polemics agitating Romania&#x27;s cultural and political scene. He was also occasionally hosting Eminescu, witnessing his friend&#x27;s struggle with mental disorder. The two failed to reconnect, and their relationship ended. After one of the meetings, he recorded that the delusional poet was carrying around a revolver with which to fend off unknown attackers—among the first in a series of episodes which ended with Eminescu&#x27;s psychiatric confinement and death during June 1889. Around that time, Creangă, like other &quot;Junimists&quot;, was involved in a clash of ideas with the emerging Romanian socialist and atheistic group, rallied around &quot;Contemporanul&quot; magazine. This occurred after &quot;Contemporanul&quot; founder Ioan Nădejde publicly ridiculed &quot;Învățătoriul copiilor&quot; over its take on creationism, quoting its claim that &quot;the invisible hand of God&quot; was what made seeds grow into plants. Creangă replied with a measure of irony, stating that &quot;had God not pierced the skin over our eyes, we would be unable to see each other&#x27;s mistakes&quot;. Nevertheless, Călinescu argued, Nădejde&#x27;s comments had shaken his adversary&#x27;s religious sentiment, leading Creangă to question the immortality of the soul in a letter he addressed to one of his relatives in the clergy. According to other assessments, he was himself an atheist, albeit intimately so.

In 1887, the National Liberal Ministry of Dimitrie Sturdza removed Creangă from his schoolteacher&#x27;s post, and he subsequently left for Bucharest in order to petition for his pension rights. Having hoped to be granted assistance by Maiorescu, he was disappointed when the &quot;Junimea&quot; leader would not respond to his request, and, during his final years, switched allegiance to the literary circle founded by Nicolae Beldiceanu (where he was introduced by Gruber). Among Creangă&#x27;s last works was a fourth and final part of his &quot;Memories&quot;, most likely written during 1888. The book remained unfinished, as did the story &quot;Făt-frumos, fiul iepei&quot; (&quot;Făt-Frumos, Son of the Mare&quot;). He died after an epileptic crisis, on the last day of 1889, his body being buried in Iași&#x27;s Eternitatea Cemetery. His funeral ceremony was attended by several of Iași&#x27;s intellectuals (Vasile Burlă, A. C. Cuza, Dumitru Evolceanu, Nicolae Iorga and Artur Stavri among them).

==Work==

===Cultural context===
The impact of Ion Creangă&#x27;s work within its cultural context was originally secured by &quot;Junimea&quot;. Seeking to revitalize Romanian literature by recovering authenticity, and reacting against those cultural imports it deemed excessive, the group notably encouraged individual creativity among peasants. Reflecting back on Maiorescu&#x27;s role in the process, George Călinescu wrote: &quot;A literary salon where the personal merit would take the forefront did not exist [before &quot;Junimea&quot;] and, had Creangă been born two decades earlier, he would not have been able to present &#x27;his peasant material&#x27; to anyone. Summoning the creativity of the peasant class and placing it in direct contact with the aristocrats is the work of &quot;Junimea&quot;.&quot; His cogenerationist and fellow literary historian Tudor Vianu issued a similar verdict, commenting: &quot;&quot;Junimea&quot; is itself ... an aristocratic society. Nevertheless, it is through &quot;Junimea&quot; that surfaced the first gesture of transmitting a literary direction to some writers of rural extraction: a phenomenon of great importance, the neglect of which would render unexplainable the entire subsequent development of our literature.&quot; Also referring to cultural positioning within and outside the group, Carmen-Maria Mecu and Nicolae Mecu took the acceptance of &quot;literate peasants&quot; such as Creangă as exemplary proof of &quot;Junimist&quot; &quot;diversity&quot; and &quot;tolerance&quot;.

Maiorescu is known to have had much appreciation for Creangă and other writers of peasant origin, such as Ion Popovici-Bănățeanu and Ioan Slavici. Late in life, he used this connection to challenge accusations of &quot;Junimist&quot; elitism in the face of criticism from more populist traditionalists. Nonetheless, &quot;Junimea&quot; members in general found Creangă more of an entertainer rather than a serious writer, and treasured him only to the measure where he illustrated their theories about the validity of rural literature as a source of inspiration for cultured authors. Therefore, Iacob Negruzzi sympathetically but controversially referred to his friend as &quot;a primitive and uncouth talent&quot;. Maiorescu&#x27;s critical texts also provide little individual coverage of Creangă&#x27;s contributions, probably because these failed to comply exactly with his stratification of literary works into &quot;poporane&quot; (&quot;popular&quot;, that is anonymous or collective) and otherwise. Tudor Vianu&#x27;s theory defines Creangă as a prime representative of the &quot;popular realism&quot; guidelines (as sporadically recommended by the &quot;Junimist&quot; doyen himself), cautioning however that Creangă&#x27;s example was never mentioned in such a context by Maiorescu personally.

Although he occasionally downplayed his own contribution to literature, Creangă himself was aware that his texts went beyond records of popular tradition, and made significant efforts to be recognized as an original author (by corresponding with fellow writers and willingly submitting his books to critical scrutiny). Vianu commented at length on the exact relationship between the narrative borrowed from oral tradition and Creangă&#x27;s &quot;somewhat surreptitious&quot; method of blending his own style into the folkloric standard, likening it to the historical process whereby local painters improvised over the strict canons of Byzantine art. Creangă&#x27;s complex take on individuality and the art of writing was attested by his own foreword to an edition of his collected stories, in which he addressed the reader directly: &quot;You may have read many stupid things since you were put on this Earth. Please read these as well, and where it should be that they don&#x27;t agree with you, take hold of a pen and come up with something better, for this is all I could see myself doing and did.&quot;

An exception among &quot;Junimea&quot; promoters was Eminescu, himself noted for expressing a dissenting social perspective which only partly mirrored Maiorescu&#x27;s take on conservatism. According to historian Lucian Boia, the &quot;authentic Moldavian peasant&quot; that was Creangă also complemented Eminescu&#x27;s own &quot;more metaphysical&quot; peasanthood. Similarly, Z. Ornea notes that the poet used Creangă&#x27;s positions to illustrate his own ethnonationalist take on Romanian culture, and in particular his claim that rural authenticity lay hidden by a &quot;superimposed stratum&quot; of urbanized ethnic minorities. 20th century critics have described Creangă as one of his generation&#x27;s most accomplished figures, and a leading exponent of &quot;Junimist&quot; literature. This verdict is found in several of Vianu&#x27;s texts, which uphold Creangă as a great exponent of his generation&#x27;s literature, comparable to fellow &quot;Junimea&quot; members Eminescu, Slavici and Ion Luca Caragiale. This view complements George Călinescu&#x27;s definition, placing the Moldavian author in the company of Slavici and Caragiale as one of the &quot;great prose writers&quot; of the 1880s. Lucian Boia, who noted that &quot;the triad of Romanian classics&quot; includes Creangă alongside Eminescu and Caragiale, also cautioned that, compared to the other two (with whom &quot;the Romanians have said almost all there is to say about themselves&quot;), Creangă has &quot;a rather more limited register&quot;.

The frequent comparison between Creangă and Caragiale in particular is seen by Vianu as stemming from both their common &quot;wide-ranging stylistic means&quot; and their complementary positions in relations to two superimposed phenomenons, with Caragiale&#x27;s depiction of the &quot;petite bourgeoisie&quot; as the rough equivalent of Creangă&#x27;s interest in the peasantry. The same parallelism is explained by Ornea as a consequence of the two authors&#x27; social outlook: &quot;[Their works] have cemented aesthetically the portrayal of two worlds. Creangă&#x27;s is the peasant world, Caragiale&#x27;s the suburban and urban one. Two worlds which represent, in fact, two characteristic steps and two sociopolitical models in the evolution of Romanian structures which ... were confronting themselves in a process that would later prove decisive.&quot; According to the same commentator, the two plus Eminescu are their generation&#x27;s great writers, with Slavici as one &quot;in their immediate succession.&quot; While listing what he believes are elements bridging the works of Creangă and Caragiale, other critics have described as strange the fact that the two never appear to have mentioned each other, and stressed that, although not unlikely, a direct encounter between them was never recorded in sources.

===Narrative style and language===
Highlighting Ion Creangă&#x27;s recourse to the particularities of Moldavian regionalisms and archaisms, their accumulation making Creangă&#x27;s work very difficult to translate, George Călinescu reacted against claims that the narratives reflected antiquating patterns. He concluded that, in effect, Creangă&#x27;s written language was the equivalent of a &quot;glossological museum&quot;, and even contrasted by the writer&#x27;s more modern everyday parlance. Also discussing the impression that Creangă&#x27;s work should be read with a Moldavian accent, noted for its &quot;softness of sound&quot; in relation to standard Romanian phonology, Călinescu cautioned against interpretative exaggerations, maintaining that the actual texts only offer faint suggestions of regional pronunciation. Contrasting Creangă with the traditions of literature produced by Wallachians in what became the standard literary language, Călinescu also argued in favor of a difference in mentality: the &quot;balance&quot; evidenced by Moldavian speech and illustrated in Ion Creangă&#x27;s writings is contrasted by the &quot;discoloration and roughness&quot; of &quot;Wallachianism&quot;. He also criticized those views according to which Creangă&#x27;s variant of the literary language was &quot;beautiful&quot;, since it failed to &quot;please everyone on account of some acoustical beauty&quot;, and since readers from outside the writer&#x27;s native area could confront it &quot;with some irritation.&quot; For Călinescu, the result nevertheless displays &quot;an enormous capacity of authentic speech&quot;, also found in the works of Caragiale and, in the 20th century, Mihail Sadoveanu. According to the same commentator, the dialectical interventions formed a background to a lively vocabulary, a &quot;hermetic&quot; type of &quot;argot&quot;, which contained &quot;hilarious double entendres and indecent onomatopoeia&quot;, passing from &quot;erudite beauty&quot; to &quot;obscene laughter&quot;. Some of the expressions characteristic of Creangă&#x27;s style are obscure in meaning, and some other, such as &quot;drought made the snake scream inside the frog&#x27;s mouth&quot;, appear to be spontaneous and nonsensical. Another specific trait of this language, commented upon by Vianu&#x27;s and compared by him to the aesthetics of Classicism, sees much of Creangă&#x27;s prose being set to a discreet poetic meter.

The recourse to oral literature schemes made it into his writings, where it became a defining trait. As part of this process, Călinescu assessed, &quot;Creangă acts as all his characters in turn, for his stories are almost entirely spoken. ... When Creangă recounts, the composition is not extraordinary, but once his heroes begin talking, their gesticulation and wording reach a height in typical storytelling.&quot; According to the critic, discovering this &quot;fundamental&quot; notion about Creangă&#x27;s work was the merit of literary historian and &quot;Viața Românească&quot; editor Garabet Ibrăileanu, who had mentioned it as a main proof of affiliation to realism. The distinctive manner of characterization through &quot;realistic dialogues&quot; is seen by Vianu as a highly personal intervention and indicator of the Moldavian writer&#x27;s originality. Both Vianu and Călinescu discussed this trait, together with the technique of imparting subjective narration in-between characters&#x27; replies, as creating other meeting points between Creangă and his counterpart Caragiale. Partly replicating in paper the essence of social gatherings, Ion Creangă often tried to transpose the particular effects of oral storytelling into writing. Among these characteristic touches were interrogations addressed to the readers as imaginary listeners, and pausing for effect with the visual aid of ellipsis. He also often interrupted his narratives with concise illustrations of his point, often in verse form, and usually introduced by &quot;vorba ceea&quot; (an expression literally meaning &quot;that word&quot;, but covering the sense of &quot;as word goes around&quot;). One example of this connects the notions of abundance and personal satisfaction:
In other cases, the short riddles relate to larger themes, such as divine justification for one&#x27;s apparent fortune:
===Creangă&#x27;s specificity===
Despite assuming the external form of traditional literature, Ion Creangă&#x27;s interests and creative interventions, Călinescu noted, separated him from his roots: &quot;peasants do not have [his] entirely cultured gifts. ... Too much &#x27;atmosphere&#x27;, too much dialogic &#x27;humor&#x27;, too much polychromy at the expense of linear epic movements. The peasant wants the bare epic and desires the unreal.&quot; The commentator passed a similar judgment on the author&#x27;s use of ancient sayings, concluding that, instead of crystallizing and validating local folklore, the accounts appeal to cultured tastes, having as the generation of comedy and volubility as their main purpose. According to Vianu&#x27;s assessment Creangă was &quot;a supreme artist&quot; whose use of &quot;typical sayings&quot; attests &quot;a man of the people, but not an anonymous and impersonal sample.&quot; These verdicts, directly contradicting &quot;Junimist&quot; theories, were mirrored by several other 20th century exegetes belonging to distinct schools of thought: Pompiliu Constantinescu, Benjamin Fondane and Ion Negoițescu. Writing during the second half of the century, critic Nicolae Manolescu passed a similar judgment, believing that Creangă was motivated by a &quot;strictly intellectual sensuousness&quot; and the notion that &quot;pleasure arises from gratuitousness&quot;, while Manolescu&#x27;s colleague Mircea Braga referred to &quot;the great secret of the man who has managed to transfer unaltered the code of popular creativity into the immanence of the cultured one.&quot; In Braga&#x27;s assessment, this synthesis managed &quot;the impossible&quot;, but the difficulty of repeating it with each story also resulted in mediocre writings: &quot;from among his few texts, even fewer are located on the relatively highest level of the relative aesthetic hierarchy&quot;.

Călinescu viewed such intellectual traits as shared by Creangă with his Wallachian counterpart Anton Pann, in turn linking both writers to the satirical component of Renaissance literature, and specifically to François Rabelais. Within local tradition, the literary historian saw a symbolic connection between Creangă and the early 18th century figure, Ion Neculce, one of Moldavia&#x27;s leading chroniclers. While he made his own comparison between Creangă and Pann, Tudor Vianu concluded that the Moldavian writer was in fact superior, as well as being more relevant to literature than Petre Ispirescu, the prime collector of tales in 19th-century Wallachia. Also making use of the Rabelais analogy, literary chronicler Gabriela Ursachi found another analogy in local letters: Ion Budai-Deleanu, an early 19th-century representative of the Transylvanian School, whose style mixes erudite playfulness with popular tastes. These contextual traits, researchers assess, did not prevent Creangă&#x27;s overall work from acquiring a universal aspect, particularly since various of his writings use narrative sequences common throughout world literature.

George Călinescu also assessed that these literary connections served to highlight the elevated nature of Creangă&#x27;s style, his &quot;erudite device&quot;, concluding: &quot;Writers such as Creangă can only show up in places where the word is ancient and equivocal, and where experience has been condensed into unchanging formulas. It would have been more natural for such a prose writer to have emerged a few centuries later, into an era of Romanian humanism. Born much earlier, Creangă showed up where there exists an ancient tradition, and therefore a species of erudition, ... in a mountain village ... where the people is unmixed and keeping [with tradition].&quot; Outlining his own theory about the aspects of &quot;national specificity&quot; in Romanian letters, he expanded on these thoughts, listing Creangă and Eminescu as &quot;core Romanians&quot; who illustrated a &quot;primordial note&quot;, complemented by the &quot;southern&quot; and &quot;Balkan&quot; group of Caragiale and others. Claiming that the &quot;core&quot; presence had &quot;not primitive, but ancient&quot; origins, perpetuated by &quot;stereotyped wisdom&quot; and &quot;energetic fatalism&quot;, he asserted: &quot;Creangă shows our civilization&#x27;s contemporaneity with the world&#x27;s oldest civilizations, our Asian age.&quot; The alternating national and regional characteristics in Creangă&#x27;s writings are related by historian Neagu Djuvara with the writer&#x27;s place of birth, an affluent village in an isolated region, contrasting heavily with the 19th century Wallachian countryside: &quot;if the mud hut villages of the Danube flood plain are to be taken into account, one finds himself in a different country.&quot; Ornea, who noted that Eminescu effectively shared Creangă&#x27;s worldview, believed the latter to have been dominated by nostalgia for a world of independent landowning peasants, and argued that Creangă&#x27;s literary and political outlook were both essentially conservative. Ornea commented: &quot;One could say that it was through [this form of nostalgia] that the writer debuted and that, within the space of his work it became, in its own right, an expression of the world that was about to vanish.&quot; Commenting on Creangă&#x27;s &quot;robust realism&quot; and lack of &quot;sentimentality&quot;, Vianu contrarily asserted: &quot;Creangă&#x27;s nostalgia ... has an individual, not social, sense.&quot;

The witty and playful side of Creangă&#x27;s personality, which became notorious during his time at &quot;Junimea&quot; and constituted a significant part of his appeal, was reflected into a series of anecdotes. These accounts detail his playing the ignorant in front of fellow &quot;Junimists&quot; in order not to antagonize sides during literary debates (notably, by declaring himself &quot;for against&quot; during a two-option vote), his irony in reference to his own admirers (such as when he asked two of them to treasure the photograph of himself in the middle and the two of them on either side, while comparing it to the crucifixion scene and implicitly assigning them the role of thieves), and his recourse to puns and proverbs which he usually claimed to be citing from oral tradition and the roots of Romanian humor. The latter habit was notably illustrated by his answer to people who would ask him for money: &quot;not since I born was I as poor as I was poor yesterday and the day before yesterday and last week and last week and throughout life&quot;. His joyfulness complemented his overall Epicureanism and his gourmand habits: his accounts are often marked by a special interest in describing acts related to food and drink. Overall, Eduard Gruber&#x27;s report contended, Creangă&#x27;s writing relied on him being &quot;a strong sensual and auditive type&quot;, and a &quot;very emotional&quot; person.

Ion Creangă&#x27;s sense of humor was instrumental in forging the unprecedented characteristics of his work. American critic Ruth S. Lamb, the writer&#x27;s style merges &quot;the rich vocabulary of the Moldavian peasant&quot; with &quot;an original gaiety and gusto comparable to that of Rabelais.&quot; According to George Călinescu: &quot;[Creangă] got the idea that he was a clever man, like all men of the people, and therefore used irony to make himself seem stupid.&quot; In Călinescu&#x27;s view, the author&#x27;s antics had earned him a status equivalent to that of his Wallachian &quot;Junimist&quot; counterpart Caragiale, with the exception that the latter found his inspiration in urban settings, matching &quot;Nasreddinisms&quot; with &quot;Miticism&quot;. Z. Ornea sees the main protagonists in Creangă&#x27;s comedic narratives as, in effect, &quot;particularized incarnations of the same symbolic character&quot;, while the use of humor itself reflects the traditional mindset, &quot;a survival through intelligence, that of a people with an old history, whose life experience has for centuries been concentrated into gestures and words.&quot;

===Most prominent tales===
Part of Ion Creangă&#x27;s contribution to the short story, fantasy and children&#x27;s literature genres involved collecting and transforming narratives circulating throughout his native region, which intertwine with his characteristic storytelling to the point where they become original contributions. According to Călinescu, the traditional praise for Ion Creangă as a creator of literary types is erroneous, since his characters primarily answered to ancient and linear narrative designs. The conclusion is partly shared by Braga, who links Creangă&#x27;s tales to ethnological and anthropological takes on the themes and purposes of fairy tales, postulating the prevalence of three ancient and related narrative pretexts throughout his contributions: the preexistence of a &quot;perturbing situation&quot; (attributable to fatality), the plunging of the hero into a rite of passage-type challenge, a happy ending which brings the triumph of good over evil (often as a brutal and uncompromising act). Like their sources and predecessors in folklore, these accounts also carry transparent morals, ranging from the regulation of family life to meditations about destiny and lessons about tolerating the marginals. However, Swedish researcher Tom Sandqvist argues, they also illustrate the absurdist vein of some traditional narratives, by featuring &quot;grotesqueries&quot; and &quot;illogical surprises&quot;.

With &quot;The Goat and Her Three Kids&quot;, written mainly as a picturesque illustration of motherly love, Creangă produced a fable in prose, opposing the eponymous characters, caricatures of a garrulous but hard-working woman and her restless sons, to the sharp-toothed Big Bad Wolf, a satirical depiction of the cunning and immoral stranger. The plot shows the wolf making his way into the goat&#x27;s house, where he eats the two older and less obedient kids, while the youngest one manages to escape by hiding up the chimney—the symbolism of which was psychoanalyzed by Dan Grădinaru, who claims it constitutes an allusion to Creangă&#x27;s own childhood. The dénouement sees an inversion of the natural roles, an episode which, ethnologist Șerban Anghelescu notes, is dominated by &quot;the culinary fire&quot;: the goat exercises her brutal revenge by trapping and slowly cooking the predator. This approach partly resonates with that of &quot;The Mother with Three Daughters-in-Law&quot;, in which Creangă makes ample use of a traditional theme in Romanian humor, which portrays mothers-in-law as mean, stingy and oppressive characters. The embodiment of such offensive traits, she is also shown to be ingenious, pretending that she has a hidden third eye which always keeps things under watch. The narrator sides with the three young women in depicting their violent retribution, showing them capturing their oppressor, torturing her until she is left speech impaired, and leaving her on the brink of death. The mother-in-law&#x27;s end turns into a farce: the eldest and most intelligent of the killers manipulates her victim&#x27;s dying sounds into a testament partitioning her wealth, and a thin decorum is maintained at the funeral ceremony by the daughters&#x27; hypocritical sobbing.

&quot;The Story of the Pig&quot; partly illustrates the notion that parental love subdues even physical repulsion, showing an elderly peasant couple cherishing their adopted porcine son, who, unbeknown to them, is enchanted. The creature instantly offsets his parents&#x27; sadness and immobility by his witty intelligence. Having applied his perseverance and spells to erect a magical bridge, the piglet fulfills the requirement for marrying the emperor&#x27;s daughter, after which it is uncovered that he is a &quot;Făt-Frumos&quot; or Prince Charming character who assumes his real identity only by night. Although the plot is supposed to deal with imperial magnificence in fairy tale fashion, the setting is still primarily rural, and the court itself is made to look like an elevated peasant community. According to researcher Marcu Beza, the text is, outside of its humorous context, a distant reworking of ancient legends such as &quot;Cupid and Psyche&quot;. The story introduces three additional characters, old women who assess and reward the efforts of the virtuous: Holy Wednesday, Holy Friday and Holy Sunday. They represent a mix of Christian and pagan traditions, by being both personifications of the liturgical calendar and fairy-like patrons of the wilderness (&quot;zâne&quot;).

A similar perspective was favored by &quot;The Old Man&#x27;s Daughter and the Old Woman&#x27;s Daughter&quot;. Here, the theme echoes &quot;Cinderella&quot;, but, according to Călinescu, the rural setting provides a sharp contrast to the classical motif. Persecuted by her stepmother and stepsister, the kind and loving daughter of the old man is forced into a position of servitude reflecting the plight of many peasant women in Creangă&#x27;s lifetime. In this case, the old man is negatively depicted as cowardly and entirely dominated by his mean wife. The focal point of the narrative is the meeting between the good daughter and Holy Sunday. The latter notices and generously rewards the girl&#x27;s helpful nature and mastery of cooking; in contrast, when her envious sister attempts the same and fails, she ends up being eaten by serpent-like creatures (&quot;balauri&quot;). The happy ending sees the good girl marrying not Prince Charming, but a simple man described as &quot;kind and industrious&quot;—this outcome, Călinescu assessed, did not in effect spare the old man&#x27;s daughter from a life of intense labor. A story very similar to &quot;The Old Man&#x27;s Daughter ...&quot; is &quot;The Purse a&#x27; Tuppence&quot;, which teaches that greed can shatter families, while offering symbolic retribution to men who are unhappy in marriage. The old man&#x27;s rooster, chased away by the old woman for being unproductive, ends up amassing a huge fortune, which he keeps inside his belly and regurgitates back into the courtyard; the jealous old woman ends up killing her favorite hen, who has failed in replicating the rooster&#x27;s feat.

===Devil-themed stories and &quot;Harap Alb&quot;===

Several of Creangă&#x27;s characteristic novellas are infused with themes from Christian mythology, fictionalizing God, Saint Peter and the army of devils, most often with the comedic intent of showing such personages behaving like regular people. A defining story in this series is &quot;Dănilă Prepeleac&quot;, whose eponymous peasant hero is characterized by what Șerban Anghelescu calls &quot;idiocy serving to initiate&quot;, or, according to Gabriela Ursachi, &quot;complete, and therefore sublime, stupidity.&quot; The first part of the story shows Dănilă exchanging his oxen for an empty bag—a set of dialogues which, George Călinescu argued, is almost exactly like a comedy play. In what was described as a complete reversal in characterization, the hero uses intelligence and ruse to trick and frighten several devils. Contrarily, &quot;Stan Pățitul&quot; shows its hero fraternizing with a lesser demon. Following the opening episode, in which the latter accidentally eats a bit of &quot;mămăligă&quot; dedicated by Stan to those who honor God, Satan himself condemns his subordinate to service the peasant. Călinescu highlights the naturalness of exchanges between the two protagonists, the latter of whom assumes the endearing form of a frail boy, Chirică, who ends up moving in with Stan and entering his service. The writing was also noted for other realistic elements alluding to everyday life, such as the overtly colloquial exchange between Chirică and Satan, or the episodes in which the young devil helps Stan woo a peasant woman. Although relatively young, Stan himself is referred to as &quot;stătut&quot; (&quot;frowzy&quot; or &quot;lacking in freshness&quot;), and the wording reflects rural attitudes about men who fail to marry during a certain age interval. Toward the end, the story focuses on a corrupt old woman who tries to trick Stan&#x27;s new wife into committing adultery, but fails and is banished to the remotest area of Hell. Viewed by Călinescu as Creangă&#x27;s &quot;most original manner of dealing with the fabulous&quot;, and paralleled by him with Caragiale&#x27;s &quot;Kir Ianulea&quot; on account of its realist approach to the supernatural, &quot;Stan Pățitul&quot; is, according to Vianu, untraceable in its inspiration: &quot;[its] folk origin could not be identified, but it is not dismissible&quot;.

Another account in this series is &quot;Ivan Turbincă&quot;, whose protagonist, a Russian serviceman, is shown rebelling against Heaven and Hell, and ultimately accomplishing the human ideal of cheating Death. The plot retells a theme present in both Romanian tradition and Ukrainian folklore, while, according to researcher of children&#x27;s literature Muguraș Constantinescu, the main character is similar to German tradition&#x27;s Till Eulenspiegel. In the beginning of the account, God rewards the soldier&#x27;s exemplary charity by granting him a pouch (&quot;turbincă&quot;), which can miraculously trap anything in existence. In order to circumvent the laws of nature, Ivan subsequently makes use of both his magical item and his innate shrewdness. In one such episode, pretending not to understand the proper position of bodies inside a coffin, he tricks impatient Death into taking his place, and traps her inside. Eventually, he is allowed to keep his life, but is promised an eternity of old age, which he ingeniously counterbalances by attending an endless succession of wedding parties, and therefore never having to feel sad.

&quot;Harap Alb&quot;, one of Ion Creangă&#x27;s most complex narratives, carries a moral defined by Călinescu as &quot;the gifted man will earn a reputation under any guise.&quot; The story opens with a coming of age quest, handed down by a king to his three sons: the most fit among them is supposed to reach the court of the Green Emperor, who is the king&#x27;s brother, and succeed him to the throne. According to Călinescu, the mission bases itself on travels undertaken by young men in Creangă&#x27;s native region, while the subsequent episodes in the narrative reinforce the impression of familiarity, from the &quot;peasant speech&quot; adopted by the villain known as the Bald Man, to the &quot;crass vulgarity&quot; evidenced by the antagonist Red Emperor. Forced to pass himself off as a foreign servant (or &quot;Moor&quot;), the prince is three times tested and aided by Holy Sunday, who doubles as the queen of &quot;zâne&quot; creatures. Călinescu described as &quot;playful realism&quot; the method through which Creangă outlined the mannerisms of several other characters, in particular the allegorical creatures who provide the youngest prince with additional and serendipitous assistance. In one noted instance, the characters &quot;Setilă&quot; (&quot;Drink-All&quot;) and &quot;Flămânzilă&quot; (&quot;Eat-All&quot;) help the hero overcome seemingly impossible tasks set by the Red Emperor, by ingesting unnaturally huge amounts of food and drink.

The tale builds on intricate symbolism stemming from obscure sources. It features what Muguraș Constantinescu calls &quot;the most complex representation of Holy Sunday&quot;, with mention of her isolated and heavenly abode on &quot;flower island&quot;. A background antithesis opposes the two fictional monarchs, with the Red Emperor replicating an ancient tradition which attributes malignant characteristics to the color. By contrast, the Green Emperor probably illustrates the ideals of vitality and healthy lifestyle, as hinted by his culinary preference for &quot;lettuce from the garden of the bear&quot;. Historian Adrian Majuru, building on earlier observations made by linguist Lazăr Șăineanu, also connects the servant-prince&#x27;s antagonists with various reflections of ethnic strife in Romanian folklore: the Red Emperor as standing for the medieval Khazars (&quot;Red Jews&quot;), the Bald Man as a popular view of the Tatars.

===&quot;Childhood Memories&quot;===
&quot;Childhood Memories&quot; is, together with a short story about his teacher Isaia Teodorescu (titled &quot;Popa Duhu&quot;), one of Creangă&#x27;s two memoirs. George Călinescu proposed that, like his fairy tales, the book illustrates popular narrative conventions, a matter accounting for their special place in literature: &quot;The stories are true, but typical, without depth. Once retold with a different kind of gesticulation, the subject would lose all of its lively atmosphere.&quot; Also based on the techniques of traditional oral accounts, it features the topical interventions of a first-person narrator in the form of soliloquies, and reflects in part the literary canon set by frame stories. The resulting effect, Călinescu argued, was not that of &quot;a confession or a diary&quot;, but that of a symbolic account depicting &quot;the childhood of the universal child.&quot; According to Vianu, the text is especially illustrative of its author&#x27;s &quot;spontaneous passage&quot; between the levels of &quot;popular&quot; and &quot;cultured&quot; literature: &quot;The idea of fictionalizing oneself, of outlining one&#x27;s formative steps, the steady accumulation of impressions from life, and then the sentiment of time, of its irreversible flow, of regret for all things lost in its consumption, of the charm relived through one&#x27;s recollections are all thoughts, feelings and attitudes defining a modern man of culture. No popular model could have ever stood before Creangă when he was writing his &quot;Memories&quot;, but, surely, neither could the cultured prototypes of the genre, the first autobiographies and memoirs of the Renaissance&quot;. Grădinaru and essayist Mircea Moț analyzed the volume as a fundamentally sad text, in stated contrast with its common perception as a recollection of joyful moments: the former focused on moments which seem to depict Nică as a loner, the latter highlighted those sections which include Creangă&#x27;s bitter musings about destiny and the impregnability of changes. A distinct interpretation was provided by critic Luminița Marcu, who reacted against the tradition of viewing Creangă&#x27;s actual childhood as inseparable from his own subjective rendition.

Several of the book&#x27;s episodes have drawn attention for the insight they offer into the culture, structure and conflicts of traditional society before 1900. Commenting on this characteristic, Djuvara asserted: &quot;even if we take into account that the grown-up will embellish, transfigure, &#x27;enrich&#x27; the memories of his childhood, how could we not recognize the sincerity in Creangă&#x27;s heart-warming evocation of his childhood&#x27;s village?&quot; The book stays true to life in depicting ancient customs: discussing the impact of paganism on traditional Romanian customs, Marcu Beza communicated a detail of Creangă&#x27;s account, which shows how January 1 celebrations of Saint Basil opposed the loud &quot;buhai&quot; players reenacting a fertility rite to people preferring a quieter celebration. The work also offers details on the traditional roles of a rural society such as that of Humulești, in the context of social change. Muguraș Constantinescu highlights the important roles of old men and women within Nică&#x27;s universe, and especially that of his grandfather and &quot;clan leader&quot; David Creangă. The latter, she notes, is an &quot;enlightened man&quot; displaying &quot;the wisdom and balance of the ripe age&quot;, a person able to insist on the importance of education, and a churchgoer who frowns on &quot;his wife&#x27;s bigotry.&quot; The seniors&#x27; regulatory role within the village is evidenced throughout the book, notoriously so in the episode where the boy captures a hoopoe who bothers his morning sleep, only to be tricked into releasing it by old man, who understands the bird&#x27;s vital role as village alarm clock.

Another significant part of the account, detailing Creangă&#x27;s education, shows him frustrated by the old methods of teaching, insisting on the absurd image of children learning by heart and chanting elements of Romanian grammar and even whole texts. The narrator refers to this method as &quot;a terrible way to stultify the mind&quot;. The negative portrayal of teaching priests was commented by writer and critic Horia Gârbea as proof of the author&#x27;s anticlericalism, in line with various satirical works targeting the Romanian clergy: &quot;Creangă&#x27;s &quot;Memories&quot; of the catechism school would discourage any candidate.&quot;

===Didactic writings===
Creangă&#x27;s contribution to literature also covers a series of didactic fables written as lively dialogues, among them &quot;The Needle and the Sledge Hammer&quot;, in which the objects of traditional metalworking scold the byproducts of their work for having forgotten their lowly origin. The inspiration behind this theme was identified by Călinescu as &quot;The Story of a Gold Coin&quot;, written earlier by Creangă&#x27;s &quot;Junimist&quot; colleague Vasile Alecsandri. A similar piece, &quot;The Flax and the Shirt&quot;, reveals the circuit of fibers from weed-like plants into recycled cloth, leading to the conclusion that &quot;all things are not what they seem; they were something else once, they are something else now;—and shall become something else.&quot; The technique employed by Creangă has the flax plant teaching the less knowledgeable textile, a dialogue which Călinescu likened to that between old women in a traditional society. Included alongside the two stories were: &quot;Pâcală&quot;, a writing which, Mircea Braga argued, is not as much didactic as it is a study in dialogue; &quot;The Bear Tricked by the Fox&quot;, which uses legendary and humorous elements in an attempt to explain why bears are the tail-less species among mammals; and &quot;Cinci pâini&quot; (&quot;Five Loafs of Bread&quot;), which serves as a condemnation of greed.

With &quot;Human Stupidity&quot;, Creangă builds a fable about incompetence in its absolute forms. The story centers on a peasant&#x27;s quest to find people who are less rational than his wife, having been infuriated by her panic at the remote possibility that a ball of salt could fall from its place of storage and kill their baby. This, essayist and chronicler Simona Vasilache argues, highlights &quot;a family-based division&quot; of illogical behavior, in which women are depicted as the main propagators of both &quot;astonishing nonsense&quot; and &quot;prudent stupidity&quot;. Instead, literary critic Ion Pecie identified inside the narrative a meditation on &quot;the link between spirit and nature&quot;, with the unpredictable ball of salt representing the equivalent of a &quot;sphinx&quot;. His colleague Gheorghe Grigurcu argued that such conclusions &quot;may seem excessive&quot;, but that they were ultimately validated by the literary work being &quot;a plurality of levels&quot;. A similar piece is the prose fable &quot;The Story of a Lazy Man&quot;: fed up with the protagonist&#x27;s proverbial indolence, which has led him as far as to view chewing food as an effort, his fellow villagers organize a lynching. This upsets the sensibility of a noblewoman who happens to witness the incident. When she offers to take the lazy man into her care and feed him bread crumbs, he seals his own fate by asking: &quot;But are your bread crumbs soft?&quot; The peculiar effect of this moral is underlined by Anghelescu: &quot;The lazy man dies as a martyr of his own immobility.&quot; Braga interpreted the story as evidence of &quot;the primacy of ethics&quot; over social aspects in the local tradition. Ion Pecie saw in the story proof of Creangă&#x27;s own support for capital punishment with a preventive or didactic purpose, even in cases were the fault was trivial or imagined, concluding: &quot;Here, ... Creangă loses much of his depth.&quot; Pecie&#x27;s conclusion was treated with reserve by Grigurcu, who believed that, instead, the narrator refrains from passing any judgment on &quot;the community&#x27;s instinctual eugenic reaction&quot;.

Partly didactic in scope, several of Creangă&#x27;s anecdotes involve Ion Roată, a representative to the &quot;ad hoc&quot; Divan which voted in favor of Moldo-Wallachian union, and the newly elected &quot;Domnitor&quot; Alexandru Ioan Cuza. The texts convey a sense of tension between the traditional boyar aristocracy and the peasant category, closely reflecting, according to historian Philip Longworth, a conflict mounting during the second half of the 19th century. The same is argued by Ornea, who also proposes that the protagonist offers insight into Creangă&#x27;s own conservative reflexes and his complex views on the union, while outlining several connections which the brand of social criticism professed by &quot;Junimea&quot;. Although Roată, a real-life person, was a representative of the pro-union National Party, his main interest, according to the stories themselves, was in curbing the boyars&#x27; infringement of peasant rights. The stories&#x27; narrator directs his hostility not at boyars in general, but at the younger Romantic nationalist ones, whom he portrays as gambling on Moldavia&#x27;s future: &quot;[There was] a clash of ideas opposing old boyars to the youth of Moldavia&#x27;s &quot;ad hoc&quot; Divan, even though both were in favor of &#x27;Union&#x27;. It&#x27;s only that the old ones wanted a negotiated &#x27;Union&#x27;, and the young ones a &#x27;Union&#x27; done without proper thinking, as it came to pass.&quot; According to Muguraș Constantinescu: &quot;[Roată] opposes the intelligence of common folk, their common sense, their humor and the pleasure of allegorical discourse to the pompous and hollow speeches of some politicians&quot;. In this context, Cuza&#x27;s presence is depicted as both legitimate and serendipitous, as he takes a personal interest in curbing boyar abuse.

===&quot;Moș Nichifor Coțcariul&quot; and &quot;corrosives&quot;===
Seen by Romanian critic Radu Voinescu as an extended anecdote, the novella &quot;Moș Nichifor Coțcariul&quot; (&quot;Old Man Nichifor Slyboots&quot;) establishes a connection with the language of fairy tales, being located in a legendary and non-historical age. It details the elaborate seduction of a young Jewish bride by a worldly Moldavian wagoner, on the route between Târgu Neamț and Piatra. The episode, which the text itself indicates is just one in a series of Nichifor&#x27;s conquests among his female clients, highlights the seducer&#x27;s verbose monologue, which covers accounts of his unhappy marriage, allusions about the naturalness of physical love, and intimidating suggestions that wolves may be tempted to attack the wagon (prompting the young woman to seek refuge in his arms). The seducer&#x27;s behavior, Constantinescu notes, presents an alternative to the theme of old age as a time of immobility: &quot;the still-green old man, the rake, the joker who enjoys his amorous escapades, while justifying them by the natural course of life&quot;. Nichifor mostly expresses himself with the help of folk sayings, which he casually mixes in with personal observations about the situation. The background to the plot is a record of various superstitions, some anticlerical or antisemitic: Nichifor voices the belief that priests crossing one&#x27;s path will produce bad luck, as well as the claim that Jewish apothecaries sold &quot;poisons&quot;.

The reception of &quot;Moș Nichifor Coțcariul&quot; by &quot;Junimea&quot; illustrated its ambivalence toward Creangă. Maiorescu found the text &quot;interesting in its way and decisively Romanian&quot;, but asked &quot;Convorbiri Literare&quot; journal to either modify it or refrain from publishing it altogether. This was complemented by its author&#x27;s own self-effacing assessment: calling the text &quot;a childish thing&quot;, he suggested to Maiorescu that revisions were needed, stating &quot;I have written it long, because there was no time for me to write it short.&quot; Contrarily, the writer&#x27;s posterity referred to it as one of the greatest Romanian contributions to the genre: according to George Călinescu, the insight into Nichifor&#x27;s musings resulted in transforming the writing as a whole into &quot;the first great Romanian novella with a stereotypical hero&quot;, while Voinescu described the entire story as &quot;a true masterpiece.&quot;

The narrative approaches of &quot;Moș Nichifor Coțcariul&quot; bordered on Creangă&#x27;s contributions to erotic literature, pieces collectively known as &quot;corrosives&quot; and which have for long treated with discretion by literary historians. In Călinescu&#x27;s view, this chapter in Creangă&#x27;s literature created another link between the Moldavian writer and the Renaissance tradition of Rabelais: &quot;All Rabelaisians have penetrated deeply into the realm of vulgarity.&quot; The taste for titillating accounts was also cultivated by &quot;Junimea&quot; members, who discreetly signaled their wish to hear more explicit content by asking Creangă to recount stories from &quot;the wide street&quot;. A product of this context, &quot;Moș Nichifor Coțcariul&quot; itself is said to have had at least one sexually explicit variant, circulated orally.

Two stories with explicit pornographic content survive as samples of Creangă&#x27;s erotic authorship: &quot;The Tale of Ionică the Fool&quot; and &quot;The Tale of All Tales&quot; (also known as &quot;Povestea pulei&quot;, &quot;Tale of the Dick&quot; or &quot;Tale of the Cock&quot;). The former shows its cunning hero having intercourse with a priest&#x27;s daughter, moving between prose and verse to describe the act. &quot;The Tale of All Tales&quot;, which makes ample use of vulgar speech, recounts how a peasant disrespectful of divinity has his entire maize harvest transformed into male genitalia, but is able to turn out a profit by catering to the sexual appetites of women. The final section, seen by Gârbea as a sample of anticlerical jeers recorded by &quot;the defrocked Creangă&quot;, depicts the rape of a priest by one such sexual object. Although explicit, literary historian Alex. Ștefănescu argued, the text &quot;is refined and full of charm&quot;. While acknowledging both &quot;corrosives&quot; for their &quot;popular charm&quot; in the line of Rabelais and Geoffrey Chaucer, and noting that they still display the author&#x27;s place as a &quot;great stylist&quot;, Voinescu also signaled the texts&#x27; &quot;very obvious&quot; debt to folkloric sources. In his definition, Ion Creangă is &quot;possibly the only writer&quot; to draw on the legacy of &quot;luscious popular jests&quot; found in local &quot;erotic folklore&quot;. Nevertheless, according to literary critic Mircea Iorgulescu, &quot;The Tale of All Tales&quot; may in fact be based on &quot;Parapilla&quot;, a pornographic leaflet circulating in Italian and French.

==Legacy==

===Estate, family and early cultural impact===
Soon after the Creangă&#x27;s death, efforts began to collect his manuscript writings and the updated versions of his printed works. This project involved his son Constantin, alongside A. D. Xenopol, Grigore Alexandrescu and Eduard Gruber, the latter of whom obtained the works from Tinca Vartic. The first edition was published as two volumes, in 1890–1892, but the project came to an abrupt halt due to Gruber&#x27;s insanity and death. Creangă&#x27;s final known work, the fragment of &quot;Făt-frumos, fiul iepei&quot;, was published by &quot;Convorbiri Literare&quot; in 1898. The Gruber copies were sold to a Dr. Mendel, and only a part of them was recovered by exegetes, alongside various fragments accidentally discovered at Iași market, where they were being used for wrapping paper. The collection, structured into a whole by folklorist Gheorghe T. Kirileanu, was published by Editura Minerva in 1902 and 1906. In addition to being mentioned in the memoirs of several prominent &quot;Junimists&quot;, Creangă had his political career fictionalized and satirized by Iacob Negruzzi, who transformed him, as &quot;Popa Smântână&quot;, into a character of his satirical poems &quot;Electorale&quot; (&quot;Electorals&quot;). The same author referred to his counterpart in one of his epigrams.

Shortly after her lover&#x27;s death, Tinca Vartic married a man who lived in the same part of Iași. The target of organized tourism from as early as 1890, the Iași &quot;Bojdeuca&quot; nevertheless fell into disrepair. It was eventually purchased by an &quot;Ion Creangă Committee&quot;, whose members included Constantin Creangă, Kirileanu and the ultra-nationalist politician A. C. Cuza. It was set up as the first of Romania&#x27;s &quot;memorial houses&quot; on April 15, 1918. Restored the same year and again in 1933–1934, it houses an important part of Creangă&#x27;s personal items and the first known among Creangă&#x27;s portraits, painted by his contemporary V. Mușnețanu. While Constantin Creangă had a successful career in the Romanian Army, one of the writer&#x27;s two grandsons, Horia Creangă, became one of the celebrated modern architects of the interwar period, earning his reputation by redesigning much of downtown Bucharest.

The popularity of Ion Creangă&#x27;s accounts outside his regional and dialectal context, together with his own contribution as an educator, played a part in the evolution of standard Romanian, at a new phase in which many dialectal variations were incorporated into the spoken language. His primers &quot;Metodă nouă ...&quot; and &quot;Învățătoriul copiilor&quot; went through many editions during the late 19th century. The impact of his works was also a contributing factor to preserving a noted interest in rural subjects, a subsequent defining trait in modern Romanian literature. Discussing &quot;stylistic harmony&quot;, which he believed to be bridging all of Romania&#x27;s social and literary environments, philosopher Mircea Eliade wrote: &quot;Romanians consider Ion Creangă a classic writer belonging to the modern age. His work can be read and understood by the entire range of social classes, in all the provinces of our country. In spite of the abundant presence of Moldavian words in his writings, the work would not remain a stranger to its readers. What other European culture can take pride in having a classic writer read by all categories of readers?&quot; The &quot;thematic grip of the village&quot; was noted by American academic Harold Segel, who investigated its impact on &quot;some of the most revered names in the history of Romanian literature&quot;, from Creangă and Slavici to interwar novelist Liviu Rebreanu.

===Early 20th century and interwar echoes===

A more thorough evaluation of Creangă&#x27;s literature began after 1900. At the time, it became a topic of interest to the emerging traditionalist and populist trend, illustrated by the two venues rivaling &quot;Junimea&quot;: the right-wing &quot;Sămănătorul&quot;, led by Nicolae Iorga, and the left-wing Poporanists, among which was Garabet Ibrăileanu. The new editions of his works enlisted the collaboration of &quot;Sămănătorist&quot; intellectuals Ilarie Chendi and Ștefan Octavian Iosif. Tudor Vianu however noted that, unlike Eminescu&#x27;s outlook, Creangă&#x27;s &quot;authentic ruralism&quot; did not complement the &quot;spiritual complications&quot;, global social class perspective and intellectual background associated with these trends, making Creangă &quot;the least &quot;Sămănătorist&quot; among our writers.&quot; According to Ornea, Creangă has &quot;nothing in common&quot; with the &quot;Sămănătorul&quot; ideology in particular: while the group shared his nostalgic outlook on the rural past in stark contrast to the modernized world, the Moldavian author could &quot;maintain, intelligently, the middle ground between contraries&quot;. Likewise, Mircea Braga reacted against the perception of Creangă as announcing a &quot;series&quot; of authors, noting that, for all imitation, he was &quot;an exceptional and, as far as Romanian literary history goes, unique creator.&quot;

Directly influenced by Creangă, several early 20th century and interwar authors within the new traditionalist trend explicitly stood for the legacy of folkloric, spontaneous and unskilled literature: the peasant writer I. Dragoslav, whose memoirs borrow stylistic elements from Creangă&#x27;s accounts; Constantin Sandu-Aldea, an agriculturalist by profession, who took inspiration from his techniques of rendering dialogue; and Ion Iovescu, whom the &quot;Sburătorul&quot; literary circle acclaimed as &quot;a new Creangă&quot;, and who made ample use of a modernized Muntenian dialect. Similarly, the Aromanian activist and author Nicolae Constantin Batzaria, who divided his career between Romania and the southern Balkans, combined Creangă&#x27;s storytelling techniques with the traditions of Turkish literature, while the reworking of regional folklore themes earned intellectual Constantin S. Nicolăescu-Plopșor a reputation as &quot;the Oltenian Creangă&quot;. During the 1910s, folklorist Tudor Pamfile published a specialized magazine named &quot;Ion Creangă&quot; in honor of the writer. Creangă&#x27;s various works also provided starting points for several other writers of diverse backgrounds. They included representatives of the Symbolist movement, such as Victor Eftimiu, who was inspired by Creangă&#x27;s narrative style in writing his fantasy and verse play &quot;Înșir&#x27;te mărgărite&quot;. Another such author was poet Elena Farago, whose didactic children&#x27;s story &quot;Într-un cuib de rândunică&quot; (&quot;Inside a Swallow&#x27;s Nest&quot;) borrows from &quot;The Flax and the Shirt&quot;.

With the interwar period and the spread of modernist literature, a new generation of critics, most notably George Călinescu and Vladimir Streinu, dedicated important segments of their activity to the works of Ion Creangă. Other such figures were Șerban Cioculescu, whose contribution attempts to elucidate the more mysterious parts of the writer&#x27;s vocabulary, and educator Dumitru Furtună, whose biographical studies provided a main source for subsequent research. By then, interest in Creangă&#x27;s life and writings had diversified. This phenomenon first touched Romanian theater when I. I. Mironescu dramatized a section of Creangă&#x27;s &quot;Memories&quot; as &quot;Catiheții de la Humulești&quot; (&quot;The Catechists from Humulești&quot;)—a literary contribution judged &quot;superfluous&quot; by George Călinescu, who noted that the original was already &quot;dramatic&quot; in style. The writer&#x27;s stories also became an inspiration for Alfred Mendelsohn and Alexandru Zirra, two Romanian composers who worked in children&#x27;s musical theater, who adapted, respectively, &quot;Harap Alb&quot; and &quot;The Goat and Her Three Kids&quot;. Creangă was also a secondary presence in &quot;Mite&quot; and &quot;Bălăuca&quot;, two biographical novels centered on Eminescu&#x27;s amorous life, written by the prominent interwar critic Eugen Lovinescu, to whom Călinescu reproached having largely ignored Creangă in his nonfictional texts. Creangă&#x27;s writings also earned followers among the more radical wing of the modernist scene. The authenticity and originality of Creangă&#x27;s prose were highlighted and treasured by the influential modernist venue &quot;Contimporanul&quot;, in particular by its literary chroniclers Ion Vinea and Benjamin Fondane. Likewise, while formally affiliating with Surrealism, the avant-garde author Ion Călugăru contributed various prose works which borrow some of Creangă&#x27;s storytelling techniques to depict the lives of Jewish Romanian communities from Moldavia.

In stages after World War I, the 19th century writer became better known to an international audience. This process produced translations into English, some of which, Călinescu argued, reached significant popularity among British readers of Romanian literature. In contrast, writer Paul Bailey assessed that the variants used antiquated words and &quot;sounded terrible&quot; in English. Among the series of early English-language versions was a 1920 edition of Creangă&#x27;s &quot;Memories&quot;, translated by Lucy Byng and published by Marcu Beza. It was also during the interwar that Jean Boutière published the first-ever French-language monograph on the Romanian writer, originally as a PhD thesis for the University of Paris.

While their author continued to receive praise for his main contributions, the erotic tales were most often kept hidden from the public eye. George Călinescu summarized this contrast by stating: &quot;The &#x27;corrosives&#x27; left by Creangă are not known publicly.&quot; An exception to this rule was Kirileanu&#x27;s Creangă reader of 1938, published by Editura Fundațiilor Regale as the first critical edition of his entire literature. According to critic Adrian Solomon, the Romanian tradition of silencing obscene language and sexually explicit literature through censorship made &quot;The Tale of All Tales&quot; circulate &quot;rather like a samizdat&quot;, which left writers with &quot;no solid tradition to draw on, and precious little chance to evade ... the vigilant morals of a straitlaced public.&quot; The nationalist aspects of Ion Creangă&#x27;s public discourse were however approved of and recovered by the far right of the 1920s and &#x27;30s. High-ranking Orthodox cleric Tit Simedrea referred to Creangă as a predecessor when, in 1937, he urged his congregation to refrain from purchasing merchandise sold by Jews (a measure which he believed was a practical alternative to the Jews&#x27; forced eviction). In 1939, as part of a press campaign targeting Călinescu&#x27;s work, the fascist journal &quot;Porunca Vremii&quot; accused the literary historian of having exposed Creangă&#x27;s biography for the sake of compromising the &quot;genial Moldavian&quot; by turning him into &quot;an unfrocked epileptic and a drunk.&quot;

Creangă inspired a 1920 painting by Octav Băncilă, which shows Creangă listening to Eminescu reading his poems. Two busts of the author were erected in Iași, respectively at his grave site and, in 1932, the gardens of Copou neighborhood. After 1943, another such piece was unveiled in Bucharest&#x27;s Cișmigiu Gardens, as part of &quot;Rotunda Scriitorilor&quot; monument.

===Under communism===

During Romania&#x27;s restrictive communist period, which lasted between 1948 and 1989, the critical evaluation of Ion Creangă&#x27;s work went through several periods, complementing political developments. Throughout the first part of this interval, when socialist realism was politically imposed on Romanian letters, Creangă was spared the posthumous censorship which affected several other classical writers (&quot;see Censorship in Communist Romania&quot;). His work was officially praised for its aesthetic qualities, but its association with the condemned &quot;Junimea&quot; was omitted from critical commentary, and readers were instead referred to Creangă as a realist critical of bourgeois society. In 1948, the new authorities granted him posthumous membership in the Romanian Academy. The following year, at the height of Soviet occupation, official critic Barbu Lăzăreanu controversially described Creangă as a writer indebted to Russian folklore.

By the second half of communist rule, several new approaches in the critical assessment of Creangă&#x27;s literature were emerging. His work became a main topic of critical interest and the sole subject of many works, to the point where Nicolae Manolescu assessed that &quot;everything has been said about Creangă&quot;. Within this exegetic phenomenon, an original interpretation of his stories from an esoteric perspective was written by philosopher Vasile Lovinescu as &quot;Creangă și Creanga de aur&quot; (&quot;Creangă and the Golden Bough&quot;). During the final two decades of communism, under Nicolae Ceaușescu, the recovery of nationalist discourse into official dogma also encouraged the birth of protochronism. In one of its aspects, theorized by cultural historian Edgar Papu, this approach controversially reevaluated various Romanian writers, Creangă included, presenting them as figures who anticipated most developments on the world stage. Papu&#x27;s own conclusion about &quot;Harap Alb&quot;, outlined in a 1983 volume, depicted Creangă as a direct predecessor of Italian semiotician Umberto Eco and his celebrated volume &quot;The Open Work&quot;—a conclusion which literary historian Florin Mihăilescu has seen as proof of Papu&#x27;s &quot;exegetic obsession&quot;, lacking in &quot;sense of humor, not just sense of reality.&quot; One of Papu&#x27;s disciples, national communist ideologue Dan Zamfirescu, claimed that Creangă was equal to, or even more important than world classics Homer, William Shakespeare and Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, while asserting that the eponymous protagonist of &quot;Ivan Turbincă&quot; stands as &quot;the character who dominates world history in our century&quot;. Left outside the scope of this critical interest, the &quot;corrosives&quot; were left out of new Creangă readers (such as Iorgu Iordan&#x27;s 1970 edition), being, according to a 1976 essay by scholar George Munteanu, &quot;still unpublishable&quot; for lack of &quot;a general level of aesthetic education&quot; among Romanians.

A second museum entirely dedicated to the writer was opened at his Târgu Neamț home in 1951, and donated to the state by his successors in 1965. During the following decades, it reportedly became the most visited memorial house in Romania. The authorities also financed a new cultural center, raised in the immediate vicinity of &quot;Bojdeuca&quot; during 1984–1989. In 1965, the Ion Creangă Children&#x27;s Theater, a state-run institution, was founded in Bucharest, and its subsequent activity included staging several of the writer&#x27;s fairy tales for a junior public. Among such contributions were two adaptation of &quot;Harap Alb&quot;, directed respectively by Ion Lucian and Zoe Anghel Stanca. In 1983, Timișoara-based author Șerban Foarță also completed work on a stage version of &quot;Ivan Turbincă&quot;.

A new publishing house, Editura Ion Creangă, was created as a main publisher of children&#x27;s literature, and its output included editions of Creangă&#x27;s own works. The new editions were illustrated by several visual artists of note, among them Corneliu Baba, Eugen Taru and Lívia Rusz, while &quot;Harap Alb&quot; became a project of comic book artist Sandu Florea, earning him a Eurocon prize. A major project of the time involved Creangă translations into other languages, including Hungarian (a celebrated contribution by Hungarian-Romanian author András Sütő). During the same epoch, Creangă and his stories first became sources of inspiration for the Romanian film industry. Among the first were two contributions of filmmaker Elisabeta Bostan, both released in the early 1960s and based on the &quot;Memories&quot;: &quot;Amintiri din copilărie&quot; (starring child actor Ion Bocancea as the young Nică and Ștefan Ciubotărașu as the grown-up narrator), and &quot;Pupăza din tei&quot; (focusing on the hoopoe story). In 1965, celebrated Romanian director Ion Popescu-Gopo released &quot;De-aș fi Harap Alb&quot;, a loose adaptation of &quot;Harap Alb&quot;, starring Florin Piersic in the title role. Popescu-Gopo also directed the 1976 film &quot;Povestea dragostei&quot;, which was based on &quot;The Story of the Pig&quot; and the 1985 film &quot;Ramasagul&quot; which was based on &quot;The Bag with 2 Coins&quot;. The series also includes Nicolae Mărgineanu&#x27;s biographical film of 1989, &quot;Un bulgăre de humă&quot;, focuses on the friendship between Creangă (played by Dorel Vișan) and Eminescu (Adrian Pintea).

The legacy of Ion Creangă was also tangible in the Soviet Union, and especially in the Moldavian SSR (which, as the larger section of Bessarabia, had been part of interwar Greater Romania, and later became independent Moldova). Initially, his writings, titled &quot;Moldavian Stories&quot;, formed part of the Soviet curriculum in the Moldavian Autonomous Region (Transnistria). Following the Soviet occupation of Bessarabia, Creangă was one of the Romanian-language writers whose works were still allowed for publishing by the new authorities. This provided local contributors to Romanian literature contact with older cultural models, directly inspiring the experimental or Postmodern prose pieces by Vlad Ioviță and Leo Butnaru. The endorsement of Creangă&#x27;s public image within the Moldavian SSR was also reflected in art: in 1958, the writer&#x27;s bust, the work of sculptor Lev Averbruh, was assigned to the Alley of Classics in Chișinău. His works were illustrated by one of the Moldavian SSR&#x27;s leading visual artists, Igor Vieru, who also painted a portrait of the author. In 1967, Ioviță and filmmaker Gheorghe Vodă released &quot;Se caută un paznic&quot;: an adaptation of &quot;Ivan Turbincă&quot; and one of the successful samples of early Moldovan cinema, it was also noted for the musical score, composed by Eugen Doga. Also during that period, &quot;The Goat ...&quot; and &quot;The Purse a&#x27; Tuppence&quot; were made into animated shorts (directed by Anton Mater and Constantin Condrea). In 1978, an operatic version of &quot;The Goat and Her Three Kids&quot; was created by composer Zlata Tkach, based on a libretto by Grigore Vieru.

===After 1989===

The 1989 Revolution, which signaled the end of communism, closely preceded the dissolution of the Soviet Union. Renewed Moldova–Romania relations, and moves toward potential reunification, were consecrated by 1990 events such as the &quot;Bridge of Flowers&quot;. The latter tour saw Moldovan politicians and cultural delegates demanding, and obtaining, that they be allowed to visit &quot;Bojdeuca&quot;. In 1993, answering a petition signed by a group of cultural personalities from Iași, Metropolitan Daniel (the future Patriarch of All Romania) signed a decision to posthumously revert the decision to exclude Ion Creangă from among the Moldavian clergy. The public polled during a 2006 program produced by the Romanian Television nominated Creangă 43rd among the 100 greatest Romanians. New monuments honoring the writer include a bust unveiled in Târgu Neamț, the work of sculptor Ovidiu Ciobotaru. The patrimony associated with Creangă&#x27;s life has also sparked debates: local authorities in Târgu Neamț were criticized for not maintaining the site near his house in its best condition, while the Fălticeni where he once lived was controversially put up for sale by its private owners in 2009, at a time when city hall could not exercise its pre-emption right.

Creangă&#x27;s work was also subject to rediscovery and reevaluation. This implied the publishing of his &quot;corrosives&quot;, most notably in a 1998 edition titled &quot;Povestea poveștilor generației &#x27;80&quot; (&quot;The Tale of the Tales of the 80s Generation&quot;). Edited by Dan Petrescu and Luca Pițu, it featured a Postmodern reworking of &quot;Povestea poveștilor&quot; by Mircea Nedelciu, a leading theorist of the &quot;Optzeciști&quot; writers. A trilingual edition of Creangă&#x27;s original text was published in 2006 as a Humanitas project, with illustrations made for the occasion by graphic artist Ioan Iacob. The book included versions of the text in English (the work of Alistair Ian Blyth) and French (translated by Marie-France Ionesco, the daughter of playwright Eugène Ionesco), both of which were noted for resorting exclusively to antiquated slang. In 2004, another one of Creangă&#x27;s stories was subjected to a Postmodern interpretation, with Stelian Țurlea&#x27;s novel &quot;Relatare despre Harap Alb&quot; (&quot;A Report about Harap Alb&quot;). In 2009, Țurlea followed up with a version of &quot;The Old Man&#x27;s Daughter and the Old Woman&#x27;s Daughter&quot;; a year later, his colleague Horia Gârbea published a personal take on &quot;The Story of a Lazy Man&quot;. Ion Creangă&#x27;s own didactic tales have remained a presence in the Romanian curriculum after 2000, particularly in areas of education targeting the youngest students.

New films based on Creangă&#x27;s writings include, among others, Mircea Daneliuc&#x27;s &quot;Tusea și junghiul&quot; of 1992 (an adaptation of &quot;The Old Man&#x27;s Daughter ...&quot;) and Tudor Tătaru&#x27;s Moldovan-Romanian co-production &quot;Dănilă Prepeleac&quot; (1996). There were also several post-1989 theatrical adaptations of Ion Creangă&#x27;s texts, contributed by various Romanian dramaturges. Some of these are Cornel Todea&#x27;s variant of &quot;Harap Alb&quot; (with music by Nicu Alifantis), Cristian Pepino&#x27;s take on &quot;The Goat and Her Three Kids&quot;, Mihai Mălaimare&#x27;s &quot;Prostia omenească&quot; (from &quot;Human Stupidity&quot;) and Gheorghe Hibovski&#x27;s &quot;Povestea poveștilor&quot;, a fringe theater show using both Creangă&#x27;s original and Nedelciu&#x27;s text.

Creangă&#x27;s name was assigned to several education institutions, among them Bucharest&#x27;s Ion Creangă National College, and to an annual prize granted by the Romanian Academy. There is an Ion Creangă commune, in Neamț County, and streets or squares were also named in the writer&#x27;s honor in cities throughout Romania: Târgu Neamț, Iași, Fălticeni, Bucharest, Arad, Brăila, Brașov, Cluj-Napoca, Craiova, Drobeta-Turnu Severin, Oradea, Ploiești, Sibiu, Suceava, Târgu Mureș, Tecuci, Timișoara, Tulcea, etc. A quarter in northern Bucharest, near Colentina, is also named &quot;Ion Creangă&quot;. Creangă&#x27;s name was assigned to several landmarks and institutions in post-Soviet Moldova. Among them is the Ion Creangă Pedagogical State University, founded on the basis of Chișinău&#x27;s normal school.

<text>The Algonquin Hotel is a hotel at 59 West 44th Street in Midtown Manhattan, New York City, United States. The 181-room hotel, opened in 1902, was designed by architect Goldwin Starrett for the Puritan Realty Company. The hotel has hosted numerous literary and theatrical notables throughout its history, including members of the Algonquin Round Table club during the early 20th century. Its first owner-manager, Frank Case, established many of the hotel&#x27;s traditions, including an official hotel cat as well as discounts for struggling authors. The hotel is a New York City designated landmark and a member of Historic Hotels of America, a program of the National Trust for Historic Preservation.

The hotel building is mostly twelve stories high, except for the extreme western end, which is three stories high. The first two stories of the facade are made of rusticated limestone blocks, while the upper stories have a Renaissance Revival brick facade, with limestone, metal, and terracotta details inspired by the Beaux-Arts style. When the hotel opened, it contained a large restaurant and a smaller cafe, which later became the Oak Room cabaret. The annex contains the Blue Bar on its ground story, while the upper stories were formerly used as a clubhouse.

Although the Algonquin was originally intended as an apartment hotel, it had few long-term tenants. Frank Case leased the hotel in 1907 and converted it into a traditional lodging establishment, attracting many theatrical and literary guests. Case bought the hotel in 1927 and continued to operate it until his death in 1946. Ben Bodne bought the hotel from Case&#x27;s estate and operated it for another four decades. The Algonquin then passed to the Aoki Corporation in 1987, the Camberley Hotel Company in 1997, Miller Global Properties in 2002, and HEI Hospitality in 2005, undergoing a renovation every time it was sold. The Algonquin became part of the Marriott International chain&#x27;s Autograph Collection brand in 2010, and it was sold to MassMutual subsidiary Cornerstone Real Estate Advisors in 2011.

== Site ==

The Algonquin Hotel is on 59 West 44th Street, on the north sidewalk between Sixth Avenue and Fifth Avenue, in the Midtown Manhattan neighborhood of New York City. The rectangular land lot covers , with a frontage of on 44th Street and a depth of . On the same block, the Iroquois New York, the Sofitel New York Hotel, the New York Yacht Club Building, and the Harvard Club of New York City building are to the east. Other nearby buildings include the Belasco Theatre to the west; Americas Tower to the northwest; 1166 Avenue of the Americas to the north; the New York City Bar Association Building and the Royalton Hotel to the south; and the Penn Club of New York building at 30 West 44th Street, the General Society of Mechanics and Tradesmen building, and the Hotel Mansfield to the southeast.

The adjacent block of 44th Street is known as Club Row and contains several clubhouses. When the hotel was developed in 1902, the area was filled with clubhouses, including those of the Harvard Club, Yale Club, New York Yacht Club, New York City Bar Association, and Century Association. Prior to the development of the Algonquin Hotel, the neighborhood contained a slaughterhouse, stables for stagecoach horses, and a train yard for the elevated Sixth Avenue Line. One of the stables became the Algonquin&#x27;s three-story annex in 1904. There had been many stagecoach stables on 43rd and 44th Streets between Fifth and Sixth Avenues, but only a few of these buildings remained at the end of the 20th century. By the 2010s, the hotel&#x27;s annex was the only former stable on the block. The Algonquin is also one of six hotels on 44th Street between Fifth and Sixth Avenues, the largest concentration of hotels on a single block in New York City during the early 21st century.

== Architecture ==
The Algonquin Hotel was designed in 1902 by architect Goldwin Starrett of the Thompson–Starrett Company. Albert Foster, who headed the Puritan Realty Company, developed the hotel. The building is mostly twelve stories tall, except for the extreme western end, which was converted from a three-story stable. The 12-story section is shaped like an &quot;H&quot;, with light courts facing west and east. In total, the hotel measures tall from ground level to the roofline.

=== Facade ===
The hotel building has a symmetrical facade. The first two stories of the facade are made of rusticated limestone blocks. The upper stories are largely clad with brick and are designed in the Renaissance Revival style, with limestone, metal, and terracotta details in a Beaux-Arts-inspired style. There are band courses on the facade above the second and tenth stories. The twelfth story was originally crowned by a cornice, which has since been removed.

The first story of the hotel&#x27;s 12-story section is five bays wide and contains a limestone water table. The entrance is recessed within the center bay, and a marquee projects above the sidewalk in front of the main entrance. This marquee contains details such as old English lettering, wrought-iron scrolls, and a scalloped awning. There are two segmental arches on either side of the main entrance, all of which have canopies above them. There are glazed wooden doors in the westernmost bay, as well as metal service doors in the easternmost bay. The second-westernmost and second-easternmost bays contain tripartite windows. The second story is seven bays wide. The three center bays on the second floor have two-over-two sash windows, separated by motifs of tassels and shells. There is a small balustrade in front of the three center bays, with a flagpole extending diagonally above the street. The four outer bays have rectangular windows, separated by large brackets that support the band course above the second floor, and topped by keystones flanked by festoons.

The third through eleventh stories are seven bays wide and are made of brick with limestone quoins. The four outermost bays on each story contain projecting bay windows with angular window frames, each consisting of a wide glass pane flanked by angled narrow sidelights. The angled windows were intended to increase each unit&#x27;s exposure to natural light. There are panels, urns, and floral motifs in the angled sidelights; some of the panels have been replaced with air conditioning grilles. The band course above the tenth story protrudes from the facade; the underside of the band course contains dentils and scrolled console brackets. On the eleventh and twelfth stories, there are panels with roundels between each of the three middle windows; a similar panel is placed above the twelfth-story windows. At the twelfth story, the four outermost windows are flat rather than angled, as on the second story.

The western annex was originally a two-story stable but was expanded to a three-story brick structure in 1905. The first story contains a wooden storefront with metal decorations. There is a double door at the center of the storefront, with a canopy in front of the door. This entrance leads to the Blue Bar. The entrance is flanked by display windows, which in turn are topped by transom panels with metal grilles. On either side of the storefront are pilasters decorated with Native Americans&#x27; heads. The second story contains a projecting window with multiple panes, as well as angled sidelights. The third story is divided into three sections, above which is a cornice supported by brackets and decorated with lions.

=== Features ===
When the hotel opened in 1902, its public rooms were originally furnished in English oak with marble floors. The hotel originally contained a large restaurant known as the Pergola at ground level, as well as a smaller cafe. The Pergola restaurant occupied the west and north sections of the ground floor, with a kitchen on the same level. The Pergola contained a mural with outdoor scenes on one wall, as well as wood-paneled columns, which supported a latticework arch with flowers and acorn-shaped light fixtures. Although the Pergola could only fit three rows of tables, mirrors on the remaining walls gave the impression that the restaurant was larger than it actually was. The cafe&#x27;s ceiling and walls contained terracotta and woodwork, and the lights were suspended from plaster holders on the ceiling.

There are multi-room suites and single rooms on the third through eleventh floors. The core of the H-shaped hotel contains two elevators. Above the second floor, the elevators open into a public hallway that connected all of the rooms on that floor. The core also contains a dumbwaiter leading from the hotel&#x27;s kitchen; a set of stairs; and service rooms. The roof contained a patio and a roof garden, which were constructed before air conditioning became popular. There was also a water tower above the roof. The modern-day hotel contains 181 guest rooms and suites, as well as five meeting/conference rooms.

The annex became part of the hotel in 1904. The Pergola occupied the first floor, and the Rocky Mountain Club opened its clubhouse within the annex&#x27;s second and third stories in 1913. The clubhouse had its own entrance on 44th Street, which ascended directly to the second story. The second floor contained a lounge, a reading room, and a cafe that connected with the hotel, while the third floor included the club&#x27;s parlor, pool, and billiards rooms. The Rocky Mountain Club house was used by the Beethoven Association from 1922 to 1934. The third floor was then used as a ballroom for much of the 20th century, while the second floor became storage space. In 2012, the annex&#x27;s second floor was renovated, becoming the John Barrymore Suite. The annex&#x27;s first floor has contained the Blue Bar since 1997.

==== Lobby ====
Originally, the front (south) portion of the ground floor contained a lounge with palms and flowers. When the hotel opened, the lobby included a barbershop, bar, and newsstand. The barbershop was closed during World War I, and the bar and newsstand were both removed in the 1990s. The lobby also contains wood paneling and a grandfather clock, which were both part of the original design. There was a glazed partition between the waiting area and reception desk. To the east of the lounge was a men&#x27;s smoking room and club. These features were removed during several subsequent renovations of the hotel.

The modern-day lobby includes modern furniture designed in an early 20th-century style, as well as original furniture from the same time period. The walls and columns are stained to resemble chocolate-ebony wood. The space also contains black-and-white tiled floors, which were installed in 1998 in a vintage style; the floors are covered by imported British rugs. The lobby contains an oil painting of several Algonquin Round Table regulars, designed by Natalie Ascencios on the site of a former bar. Next to the painting is an imitation round table, for which guests can make reservations. There is a blue-and-red marble desk with a shelter for the hotel&#x27;s cat (see ) and, near the eastern window, a shelf with a small staircase for the cat. Above the reception desk is an artwork composed of salvaged guest books, which was added in 2022. There is also a seating area across from the reception desk, where guests can pet and play with the hotel&#x27;s cat.

The Rose Room, along with the smaller Oak Room, was part of the hotel&#x27;s restaurant. The space contained red wallpaper, a red ceiling, and chandeliers with orange velvet tubes. The Rose Room was demolished when the lobby was expanded in 1998. The Round Table Restaurant was relocated into the Rose Room&#x27;s former space.

==== Oak Room ====
The Oak Room occupied the ground floor of the annex and was originally the Pergola&#x27;s rear section. The Oak Room Supper Club opened within part of the Pergola in 1939, with European chanteuse Greta Keller as the room&#x27;s first star. The club closed during World War II. The Oak Room reopened as a regular venue in either 1980 or 1981 under the management of cabaret operator Donald Smith. Its first regular and star was singer-pianist Steve Ross. Other performers who have appeared at the Oak Room include Julie Wilson, Mary Cleere Haran, Karen Akers, KT Sullivan, Barbara Carroll, Sandy Stewart and Bill Charlap, Diana Krall, Jessica Molaskey, Jamie Cullum, and John Pizzarelli. Andrea Marcovicci performed there for over 25 years, sometimes with her mother Helen Stuart Marcovicci. Harry Connick Jr. and Michael Feinstein also performed at the Oak Room early in their careers. The singer Sylvia Syms collapsed and died on stage there during a performance in 1992.

The Oak Room spanned . &quot;New York Times&quot; critic Raymond Sokolov described the Oak Room as intimate and more masculine than the Rose Room. The space had theatrical equipment and lighting, as well as a grand piano. The Oak Room was not a large source of income, despite charging at least $100 per person (more if one had dinner, except for matinees). Howard Reich of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; wrote in 1993 that the room&#x27;s decorations, size, furnishings, and waiters&#x27; services evoked &quot;an era when visitors sat back, sipped a drink, listened to music and savored life in an unhurried way&quot;.

The Oak Room permanently closed as a cabaret nightclub in 2012, and a portion of the room was converted into a private breakfast room for Marriott Reward Elite customers. , the Oak Room is a conference room with space for 105 guests in a theater-style arrangement. The Oak Room also contains a movable partition, which can split the space into two rooms, each with a capacity of 40. The room retains its original woodwork, and its ceiling contains curving metal light fixtures.

==== Blue Bar ====

The hotel&#x27;s Blue Bar has operated since 1933, following the end of Prohibition in the United States. Originally, the Blue Bar was placed in a niche behind the reception counter. The niche was closed and converted to storage space by the 1980s. The Blue Bar relocated to the annex in 1997, with its own entrance from the street. &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote in 2000: &quot;The Blue Bar is frequented by widows and well-traveled gentlemen with a predilection for theater.&quot; In 2012, the Blue Bar was renovated and expanded into part of the space formerly occupied by the Oak Room. The expanded Blue Bar contained blue lighting and blue-toned backlit bookshelves, with black-and-white floors that resembled those in the main reception area. The Blue Bar was relocated to the main lobby in 2022. The modern bar contains design elements similar to those added in the 2012 renovation, but the rear of the bar can be cordoned off for private parties.

==== Rooms and suites ====
The rooms and suites were originally arranged in square groups, each with its own hallway connecting to the elevators and stairs at the core. The largest suites available in the hotel contained a private hallway, a sitting room, a library or dining room, three bedrooms, and three bathrooms. Each unit originally contained mahogany woodwork and waxed-oak floors. Sliding doors separated the parlors and bedrooms in each suite; the master bedrooms were illuminated by the bay windows on the facade. Unusually for hotels of the time, each bedroom had its own bathroom, with a shower, hot and cold water, and electric lights. Except for bookshelves and fireplace mantels, the units were otherwise unfurnished. By the 2000s, the rooms had black-and-white wallpaper with framed cartoons from &quot;The New Yorker&quot; magazine. The hallways also contain cartoons taken from &quot;The New Yorker&quot;.

The modern-day hotel contains 156 rooms and 25 suites. Each suite has a name, and many suites are named after members of the Algonquin Round Table. For example, suite 506 is named for Robert Benchley, suite 610 for Harold Ross, suite 1106 for Dorothy Parker, and suite 1112 for Franklin Pierce &quot;F.P.A.&quot; Adams. Suite 306, named for Edna Ferber, hosted annual meetings of the New York Drama Critics&#x27; Circle. Suite 1010 (now the Noël Coward Suite) was the owner&#x27;s apartment for nearly one hundred years. The hotel&#x27;s first owner-manager Frank Case lived there from 1902 until his death in 1946; the subsequent owners, Ben and Mary Bodne, lived there from 1947 until their respective deaths in 1992 and 2000. The largest suite in the hotel is suite 209 on the annex&#x27;s second floor, which is named after John Barrymore and covers nearly .

== History ==
=== Development and opening ===

==== Construction ====
The Algonquin was the third hotel to be built on the surrounding city block, after the Iroquois and Royalton, which had opened in 1900. In November 1901, the Puritan Realty Company bought a site at 59–63 West 44th Street from the Century Realty Company for $180,000. The Puritan Realty Company immediately announced plans to erect an apartment hotel on the site. The hotel would be similar in design to the then-newly completed Touraine, at 9–11 East 39th Street, and it would rent rooms and suites on year-long leases.

The owners hired 28-year-old Goldwin Starrett to design the hotel, his first project in Manhattan. Starrett&#x27;s firm, the Thompson–Starrett Company, was to build the hotel for $500,000 or $600,000. The Puritan Realty Company acquired a $250,000 loan from the Century Realty Company at the end of 1901. Albert T. Foster and Ann Stetson Foster obtained a majority ownership stake in the Puritan Realty Company in February 1902. At the end of the month, the company submitted plans to the New York City Department of Buildings for an unnamed 12-story hotel, to be built on the north side of 44th Street east of Sixth Avenue. The Thompson–Starrett Company completed the hotel within a seven-month period, between April and November 1902.

Originally, the hotel was to have been known as the Puritan; there are conflicting explanations for how it received the Algonquin name. The Fosters hired Frank Case as a clerk in late 1902, a few weeks before the hotel opened. According to one account, Case believed the &quot;Puritan&quot; name was too pompous and evocative of European influences. Case reportedly advocated for an American name, and he persuaded the Fosters to rename the hotel after discovering that Algonquian Native Americans had been the first residents of the area. Another possible derivation is that Ann Foster named the hotel the Algonquin to complement the nearby Iroquois, which was also named after a Native American tribe. The historian John Tauranac, which attributed the &quot;Algonquin&quot; name to Case, claimed that the Algonquin had been named before the Iroquois was. Either way, the Algonquin had been planned with a gentlemen&#x27;s billiards room, but, under Case&#x27;s supervision, that room was converted to a kitchen.

==== Early years ====
The hotel opened on November 22, 1902, and was originally intended as a long-term hotel. At the time of the hotel&#x27;s opening, 75 percent of the units were occupied. The Algonquin had amenities that were considered modern for its time, such as trained servants, in-suite telephones, heating, and plumbing. Guests could use the phones in their rooms to contact the hotel&#x27;s concierge or to order food from the restaurant à la carte. They could also pay $7 a week () to hire their own servants, or $12 a week () to have food delivered to their rooms. Annual rent ranged from $420 () for a single room to $2,520 () for a three-bedroom suite. Guests could also use the rooms and suites for a short term, paying a nightly rate that ranged between $2 for a single room and $10 for a three-bedroom suite. For an extra daily fee of $1, guests were allowed to hire their own servants.

The Puritan Realty Company agreed in February 1903 to sell the Algonquin Hotel to two doctors, Andrew H. Smith and his son Davison W. Smith, for about $800,000; the Smiths took title that November. In partial exchange for the hotel, the Smiths sold a building at the corner of Madison Avenue and 42nd Street. Albert Foster continued to hold a lease on the Algonquin Hotel, paying $45,000 a year in rent. When the Algonquin opened, it was near six clubhouses, as well as the upscale Delmonico&#x27;s and Sherry&#x27;s restaurants. By early 1903, the Algonquin and other buildings on the block suffered from water shortages because of the large number of businesses in the area.

Meanwhile, the Fosters had become estranged. Ann Foster sued Albert in June 1904 to acquire the Algonquin&#x27;s lease, claiming she was the true leaseholder and that she had spent $50,000 to furnish the hotel. A New York state judge subsequently appointed Albert as the hotel&#x27;s receiver. Ultimately, Case took over the day-to-day operations, Albert was assigned the lease and all objects in the hotel, and Ann acquired the building itself (notwithstanding the fact that it had already been sold to the Smiths). The Algonquin did not attract many long-term tenants in its early years. According to Case, the hotel catered to &quot;many well-known families from Newport, Bar Harbor and Narragansett&quot;, who stayed there twice a year for short periods. The hotel bought a two-story stable at 65 West 44th Street in 1904 and built another floor above the stable the next year.

=== Case operation ===

By the late 1900s and early 1910s, the surrounding neighborhood was rapidly developing into an entertainment district. The New York Hippodrome opened directly across 44th Street in 1905, which Case described as &quot;an important event for us&quot;. Manhattan&#x27;s theater district also shifted to Times Square during the first decade of the 20th century; several Broadway theaters, including the Belasco, Broadhurst, Forty-fourth Street, and Winthrop Ames (now Hayes), were developed on 44th Street in the 1900s and 1910s. Case took over the hotel&#x27;s lease in 1907 and decided to operate the Algonquin as a short-term hotel. He lived there with his wife Caroline and their children Margaret and Carroll. Shortly after Carroll was born in 1908, Caroline died, and the hotel&#x27;s staff helped Frank raise his children at the hotel.

==== Literary heyday ====
The Algonquin soon became a &quot;theatrical and literary mecca&quot;, according to the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission (LPC), and it was also the first major hotel in New York City to accept unaccompanied female guests. Under Case&#x27;s management, the Algonquin gained a reputation for hospitality toward struggling authors, actors, and producers, which contributed to the hotel&#x27;s popularity among theatrical and literary figures. For instance, Case paid playwright Eugene Walter&#x27;s railroad fare when the latter was a guest at the hotel, and Case allowed guests to defer payment of their bills. The &quot;Toronto Star&quot; wrote: &quot;Through the years, the hotel has played an important role in keeping various (literally) starving artists and actors alive until their next job, their future book or Broadway hit.&quot;

The hotel&#x27;s restaurant caught fire in February 1909. After Andrew Smith died in 1910, the hotel&#x27;s ownership was split equally between his daughter Juliet E. Smith and his wife Jane Wells. The annex caught fire the same November, destroying Frederic Thompson&#x27;s residence on the top story. The Rocky Mountain Club leased the Algonquin&#x27;s three-story annex in May 1913, and Frederick J. Sterner remodeled the annex into a clubhouse, which opened that December. Case had a negative perception of speakeasy operators, and he closed the hotel&#x27;s bar in 1917, saying he did not want to fund his children&#x27;s college tuition with &quot;saloon money&quot;. Within two years of its closure, a soft-drink bar had been added.

Following World War I, the hotel became a meeting place of the Algonquin Round Table, a group of actors, critics, wits, and writers, between 1919 and 1929. In addition, the Beethoven Association moved into the hotel&#x27;s annex in 1922, staying there for twelve years. By the early 1920s, the Algonquin had become popular as a short-term residence for &quot;Hollywood stars and Broadway producers&quot;. The Algonquin&#x27;s success prompted Case to consider opening a similar hotel in Hollywood in the early 1920s.

==== Case ownership ====
Case bought the property in 1927, paying Andrew Smith&#x27;s family $1 million. By then, the hotel contained 250 rooms. The hotel&#x27;s Blue Bar opened in 1933, sixteen years after the original bar had closed. The Algonquin retained its popularity in the literary and theatrical industries; Case wrote in 1938 that it was not uncommon to see &quot;five or six or seven well-known writers&quot; at the Algonquin simultaneously. After the New York Drama Critics&#x27; Circle was founded at the Algonquin in 1935, it started hosting annual dinners at the hotel, wherein the group voted on the best play of the year. The hotel&#x27;s staff joined a labor union affiliated with the American Federation of Labor in 1939, and they went on strike. Case negotiated a contract with the labor union that April, and the Algonquin&#x27;s staff have remained unionized since then. In addition, the Algonquin Supper Club, the hotel&#x27;s first-ever nightclub, opened in November 1939.

Case remained the owner and manager of the hotel until his death in June 1946. Chemical Bank, the trustee of Case&#x27;s estate, placed the Algonquin for sale that August. At the time, the hotel had 192 units (143 of which were suites), as well as a bar and three restaurants.

=== Bodne ownership ===
In September 1946, Chemical Bank sold the hotel for $1 million to Ben Bodne of Charleston, South Carolina, who acquired the title to the property the next month. Bodne and his wife Mary had stayed there during their honeymoon in 1924, and Ben had promised Mary that he would one day buy the hotel. The hotel&#x27;s plumbing had not been updated in two decades, and the basement had sustained water damage following the demolition of the Hippodrome several years prior. Bodne owned the hotel for the next four decades, occupying the suite in which Case and his family had once lived. Ben and Mary Bodne had two daughters, both of whom were married; their respective husbands both eventually became managers of the hotel. Ben and Mary&#x27;s sons-in-law Sidney Colby and Andrew Anspach initially were hired as the hotel&#x27;s vice presidents. Colby became the hotel&#x27;s manager in 1951, and Anspach had taken over as managing director by the 1970s.

==== Initial modifications ====

Bodne announced plans in 1947 to renovate the hotel for $100,000. John Martin, the hotel&#x27;s general manager of nine years, helped Bodne with the improvements, which included refurbishing all the rooms and adding a refrigeration plant. The renovations also included new air-conditioners and televisions in each room. Bodne replaced 300 chairs, beds, and tables with new furnishings in the same style, and he also repainted the walls to their original colors.

Under Bodne&#x27;s ownership, the Algonquin became the first hotel in New York City to replace its hotel keys with electronic key cards. The hotel was among the first in New York City to give walkie-talkies to its staff and install smoke detectors in its rooms. After Bodne&#x27;s purchase, the hotel continued to host literary and theatrical meetings, including those of the Drama Critics&#x27; Circle; the Outer Circle, composed of theatrical critics who did not live in the New York metropolitan area; and the PEN Club, composed of fiction writers. Colby said in 1952 that the Algonquin &quot;often seems like a small, non-political United Nations&quot; because guests came from around the world.

Bodne conducted additional renovations through the 1950s and 1960s, ordering new furniture and draperies in the same style as the hotel&#x27;s original furnishings. The hotel&#x27;s rooms were redecorated in an 18th-century English style, with bedspreads and lamps from department stores. Bodne also installed refrigerators and TV sets concealed within walnut bureaus; the TVs and refrigerators could be removed as needed. The hotel received modern wiring, plumbing, and heating systems; the new heating system reduced the hotel&#x27;s heating costs by 25 percent. Around 1963, stage designer Oliver Smith redecorated the hotel&#x27;s Rose Room with white, gilded, and rose draperies, designing the room in a manner similar to a stage set. Most guests were unaware of the renovation work, as it was largely conducted at night.

==== Changing clientele ====
By the early 1960s, major literary and theatrical figures were beginning to favor more upscale hostelries, and &quot;the poorer actor could not afford Algonquin prices&quot;. Even so, the bar and restaurants were often full. The Algonquin still had a relatively small capacity compared to newer hotels, and it had only two elevators, one of which was used for freight during off-peak periods. Unlike other hotels with automatic elevators, the Algonquin still employed elevator operators; when the hotel&#x27;s elevators were replaced in 1965, the new elevator cabs were deliberately designed without space for automatic buttons. In addition, it did not offer gaudy entertainment or host private parties; the only visible symbol of luxury was the dining room&#x27;s crystal chandelier, which the hotel had bought in the 1930s for $25. The Algonquin&#x27;s staff knew many of the guests by name, and its valet was friends with many of the hotel&#x27;s theatrical guests. Following an extensive marketing campaign in Europe in the mid-1960s, the Algonquin became popular among European travelers. To cater to these new guests, Smith designed a new marquee above the entrance, which was installed in 1965. &quot;The New Yorker&quot; magazine, which had been established at the hotel, hosted a party for the Algonquin&#x27;s 75th anniversary in 1977.

By the late 1970s, the Algonquin employed close to 200 staff members, about one for each unit on average. The hotel remained popular, despite not offering any weekend discounts, as newer hotels did. The Algonquin also ran few formal advertisements, instead obtaining most of its business through word-of-mouth marketing. Nightly room rates were relatively cheap, ranging from $43 to $80, so the hotel had many repeat guests. Staff recorded each guest&#x27;s needs and preferences on index cards. Many of the hotel&#x27;s staff were employed there for several years, long enough to memorize guests&#x27; preferences. The &quot;Algonquinites list&quot; comprised nearly 5,000 names.

The hotel&#x27;s Oak Room reopened as a cabaret venue at the end of 1980. The units were refurbished again in the mid-1980s. The Algonquin&#x27;s room rates continued to be cheaper than those at the city&#x27;s other hotels. Even so, Ward Morehouse III wrote in 1981 that the Algonquin &quot;just never seems to worry about the so-called &#x27;bottom line&#x27;, or profit picture, despite the fact it is one of the most reasonably priced first-class hotels in the city.&quot;

=== Aoki ownership ===

Bodne sold the hotel to Caesar Park Hotels, a subsidiary of Japanese company Aoki Corporation, for $29 million in June 1987. The sale came four months after Bodne had publicly denied a rumor that he was considering selling the hotel; he had said that he would relinquish the Algonquin &quot;the day it needed self-service elevators&quot;. Aoki&#x27;s purchase marked the first time that a company or a foreign entity had owned the hotel, and it was part of a trend of foreign investment in New York City buildings in the late 1980s. Ben Bodne continued to live at the Algonquin until he died in 1992, after which Mary Bodne remained there until her own death in 2000. Aoki promised to preserve the hotel&#x27;s traditions, including maintaining the Oak Room and Rose Room as dining spaces. The hotel&#x27;s elevators were in dire need of upgrades; decades earlier, writer James Thurber had joked that the hotel&#x27;s literary guests &quot;became writers while waiting for the elevators&quot;.

In 1989, Aoki began renovating the hotel to designs by architect John Ciardullo and designer Laura Gottwald. Tishman Realty &amp; Construction carried out the project. The hotel&#x27;s 170 rooms were redecorated in a Victorian style, with wooden trim and sliding doors in each room, as well as wallpaper, tapestries, and fabrics with early-20th-century designs. Some of the rooms on the second floor were removed to make way for an expansion of the hotel&#x27;s meeting rooms. One of the suites was renamed the Round Table Suite and filled with Algonquin Round Table memorabilia. The old operator-controlled elevators were supplanted by self-service elevators, and the electrical systems were replaced as well. The owners installed a plaque in the lobby, describing the hotel&#x27;s history; the plaque had to be remade because it contained so many spelling and grammatical errors.

The renovation took five years to complete, as the contractors only renovated three floors at a time; it ultimately cost $20 million. The Algonquin was one of several hotels around Times Square that were developed or renovated in the late 1980s and 1990s. Arthur Kaptainis of the &quot;Montreal Gazette&quot; wrote that the project had &quot;cleared the funny smells without stripping the lobby of its cushiony Edwardian elegance&quot;. The hotel was no longer known for its cheap room rates; the &quot;Gazette&quot; noted that the neighboring Hotel Iroquois charged much less. Even so, the Algonquin remained popular among those visiting nearby Broadway theaters. In 1995, Aoki added a James Thurber-themed suite to the Algonquin.

=== Camberley and Olympus ownership ===

In March 1997, the partnership of Atlanta-based Camberley Hotel Company and Dallas-based Olympus Real Estate bought the Algonquin. The two companies paid $30 million for the hotel, which had 165 units at the time. The bedrooms were small by modern standards, and the Algonquin also had extremely slow elevators, mouse infestations, constant hot-water interruptions, and bad food. Camberley planned to renovate the hotel, raise nightly room rates from $180 to $200, and resell the Algonquin in five to seven years. The new owners were initially unaware of the hotel&#x27;s historical significance, as Camberley president Ian Lloyd-Jones said: &quot;We thought we were looking at a normal piece of real estate with a great location that had been underperforming in the hands of absentee owners for the last 10 years.&quot; &quot;The New York Observer&quot; wrote that, at the time of Camberley and Olympus&#x27;s acquisition, &quot;the publishing scene [had] long since dispersed&quot;.

Camberley officials announced plans to spend $4 million on a &quot;discreet&quot; renovation of the entrance and lobby. Some hotel regulars wrote letters to Lloyd-Jones, daring him &quot;to change a thing&quot;. Camberley hired Alexandra Champalimaud to design the renovation, which ultimately cost $5.5 million. The hotel&#x27;s owners demolished the Rose Room to make way for an expansion of the lobby, and they added eight standard rooms and one suite. Natalie Ascencios was also commissioned to create a painting of several Round Table members, which was then hung in the lobby. By the beginning of the 21st century, the Algonquin was one of several boutique hotels on that block of 44th Street, along with the Iroquois, Mansfield, and Sofitel. Camberley and Olympus placed the hotel for sale in January 2001, receiving bids from about 20 potential buyers. The hotel saw decreases in visitation following the September 11 attacks in 2001. Bernard Goldberg, who had been in contract to buy the hotel at the time, canceled his plans following the attacks.

=== Miller Global renovation ===
Miller Global Properties acquired the Algonquin from Camberley in June 2002 for an estimated $35 million. The Algonquin&#x27;s visitor numbers largely recovered within two years of the attacks. Anthony Melchiorri was hired as the hotel&#x27;s new general manager. Miller Global spent $3 million on renovating the hotel. When the hotel had been sold, the previous owner had relocated the first painting to the Martha Washington Inn in Virginia, so Miller Global hired Ascencios to create another painting of the Round Table&#x27;s members. This painting was installed in the Oak Room in advance of the Algonquin&#x27;s centennial. As part of the renovation, Miller Global closed the Algonquin entirely in June 2004; this was the first time that the Algonquin had been fully closed in its history. During the closure, Miller Global installed high-speed internet connections and flat-screen TVs in all of the hotel&#x27;s rooms.

When the hotel reopened in August 2004, the owners offered discounts to guests who owned old hotel memorabilia, and the restaurant offered discounted lunches to authors. Melchiorri developed a $10,000 martini to mark the completion of the renovation. Bodne&#x27;s grandson David Colby pushed for Miller Global executives to revive the hotel&#x27;s literary traditions, saying: &quot;The Algonquin has greater potential than 100 percent occupancy.&quot; The hotel also started lending iPods with audiobooks to its guests. Miller Global hired Cushman and Wakefield to find a buyer for the hotel in mid-2005.

=== Mid-2000s to present ===
The hotel was sold again to HEI Hospitality in October 2005. Under HEI&#x27;s ownership, the hotel began lending Amazon Kindles to guests, in keeping with the hotel&#x27;s literary traditions. HEI spent $4.5 million on yet another renovation of the hotel, completed in 2008, and they hired Gary Budge as the general manager. In September 2010, the Algonquin Hotel became affiliated with the Marriott International chain&#x27;s Autograph Collection brand, but the hotel retained several of its traditions, including its name and its cat. HEI continued to own the hotel but paid a franchise fee to become part of Marriott&#x27;s rewards program. The affiliation with Marriott came amid an increase in tourism in New York City.

By mid-2011, HEI was negotiating to resell the hotel to MassMutual subsidiary Cornerstone Real Estate Advisors. Cornerstone bought the hotel that June for about $80 million, becoming the hotel&#x27;s fifth owner in 15 years. In late 2011, Cornerstone announced that it would close the Algonquin for renovations for four months. The Algonquin was closed for renovations in February 2012, during which time the Oak Room was closed permanently. The hotel reopened that May after the renovations were completed. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic in New York City, the Algonquin was closed from March 2020 to April 2021. Stonehill Taylor further renovated the hotel in 2022, including the Algonquin Round Table, the Blue Bar, and the Oak Room.

== Traditions ==
=== Cats ===
The Algonquin Hotel has kept a cat in its lobby since the late 1920s. The practice was formerly thought to have originated in the 1930s, but a book by Frank Case indicates that he had cared for a cat named Billy until the feline&#x27;s death in the 1920s. According to administrative assistant Alice de Almeida (the hotel&#x27;s &quot;chief cat officer&quot;), the current practice started when the hotel took in a stray male cat that was originally named Rusty. When a guest was sick, Rusty frequently went to that guest&#x27;s room and stayed there until they had recovered. Rusty was renamed Hamlet at the suggestion of John Barrymore, who at the time was performing on Broadway in the play &quot;Hamlet&quot;. Since then, all the male cats have been named Hamlet, while all the female cats have been named Matilda. It is not clear why female cats are named Matilda, but all the Hamlets are named after the original cat. The hotel has had eight Hamlets and three Matildas in its history. The Algonquin acquired its current cat, Hamlet VIII, .

The hotel&#x27;s lobby contains two feline tree houses. The cat&#x27;s collar interacts with an electric geo-fence, which prevents the cat from leaving the lobby, because the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene does not permit animals in dining areas. The cat has received several gifts from visitors, including four oil paintings. Many people have visited the Algonquin specifically to see the hotel&#x27;s cat. One of the male cats was featured in the illustrated book &quot;Algonquin Cat&quot;; when that cat died in 1982, his obituary appeared in &quot;Variety&quot; magazine. Another cat, a female Ragdoll, was named 2006 cat of the year at the Westchester Cat Show.

Every August, the hotel holds a fundraiser with a feline fashion show featuring the hotel&#x27;s cat. The fashion shows started in the 1930s and have raised money for such initiatives as the Mayor&#x27;s Alliance for NYC&#x27;s Animals. In addition, the hotel hosts birthday parties for its cat; these events have also served as fundraisers, such as in 2010, when Matilda III&#x27;s fifteenth birthday raised money for North Shore Animal League America. &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; wrote that the cat&#x27;s birthday party &quot;is the kind of party where you would find [...] $20 Purrtinis for sale, made of Grey Goose vodka, lychee juice, coconut, white creme de cacao and lemon juice and advertisements for Reiki treatments for cats. It is also a party where you would see a cat dressed as a fruit basket...&quot;

=== Other traditions ===

The hotel has an eponymous cocktail, composed of rye whiskey, Noilly Prat and pineapple juice. The $10,000 &quot;Martini on the Rock&quot; was added to the hotel&#x27;s menu in 2004; it consists of a martini of the buyer&#x27;s choice with a single piece of &quot;ice&quot;, a diamond, at the bottom of the glass. This martini was developed by Anthony Melchiorri, the hotel&#x27;s general manager at the time, though over a decade elapsed before anyone actually bought that drink. The Blue Bar&#x27;s menu includes several cocktails that allude to the TV series &quot;Mad Men&quot;, in which the bar was featured. One bartender at the Algonquin, Hoy Wong, was believed to be the oldest bartender in New York state; by the time Wong retired in 2009, he was nearly 90 years old.

In the late 20th century, writers on tour could get one free night at the hotel in exchange for an autographed copy of their book. The practice has been amended to include a discount on standard room rates. Additionally, in 2009, the hotel offered discounted room rates to authors who had a draft manuscript and were experiencing writer&#x27;s block.

== Notable guests ==
Among the Algonquin&#x27;s early guests were actors Douglas Fairbanks, the Barrymore family, Beatrice Lillie, Raymond Hitchcock, Mary Pickford, and Elsie Janis. Ethel Barrymore lived at a suite at the Algonquin in 1905, and her maternal uncle John Drew lived there for 17 years. Luna Park developer Fred Thompson lived on the annex&#x27;s top story, while impresarios Florenz Ziegfeld Jr. and Diamond Jim Brady frequented the hotel&#x27;s cafe. Lady Gregory was the first female guest to smoke in the Algonquin&#x27;s lobby in 1911, and Case later ejected Ruth Hale for smoking in the lobby. The Algonquin attracted vaudeville and Broadway performers and silent film actors through the 1920s. Authors such as H. L. Mencken and Gertrude Stein lived there, and Tallulah Bankhead rented a room as a teenager. Playwright Sinclair Lewis frequently ate within the Oak Room as well. The hotel&#x27;s early guests also included poet Maya Angelou and actress Helen Hayes.

During the 1950s, Frederick Loewe and Alan Jay Lerner composed the score of their musical &quot;My Fair Lady&quot; at the hotel, and Pulitzer Prize for Drama–winning playwrights Mary Chase, William Inge, and Arthur Miller also stayed at the Algonquin. The actors Audrey Hepburn, Elia Kazan, and Vivien Leigh received theatrical awards in the lobby in 1952. At least two notables have died while staying at the hotel: filmmaker Preston Sturges in 1959 and playwright James Thurber in 1961.

The &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot; wrote in 1962 that the hotel still had many notable guests, including Dana Andrews, Leslie Caron, Charles Chaplin Jr., Barnaby Conrad, Noël Coward, William Faulkner, John Gielgud, Tyrone Guthrie, John Hersey, Eugène Ionesco, Elsa Lanchester, Jack Paar, Christopher Plummer, Jules Romains, and Yuri Zavadsky. By then, the hotel also catered to a &quot;new generation of writers&quot;, such as John Cheever, Norman Mailer, William Saroyan, and Tennessee Williams; English actors, such as Laurence Olivier, Joan Plowright, and Tony Richardson; and European filmmakers, such as Costa-Gavras, Jean-Luc Godard, Louis Malle, Éric Rohmer, and François Truffaut. Other frequent guests in the late 20th century included Harold Ross, Simone Signoret, and Yves Montand. Fashion designers, such as Mary Quant and Gerald McCann, also constituted an increasing share of the Algonquin&#x27;s clientele during the 1960s. By the beginning of the 21st century, the hotel&#x27;s guests included theatrical personalities such as Brenda Fricker, Simon Gray, Peter Hall, Richard Harris, Anthony Hopkins, Jeremy Irons, Angela Lansbury, John Osborne, Jonathan Pryce, Stephen Rea, Diana Rigg, Tom Stoppard, and Peter Ustinov.

=== Algonquin Round Table ===
The Algonquin Round Table met at the hotel&#x27;s Rose Room, &quot;a place where a lot of slang, phrases and attitudes were shaped&quot;. The group originated from a practical joke by theatrical press agent John Peter Toohey, who in June 1919 organized a luncheon to poke fun at drama critic Alexander Woollcott. Initially known as the Luigi Board, after a waiter at the hotel, the group later evolved into a group of journalists, authors, publicists, and actors who gathered over lunch in the main dining room. The Round Table&#x27;s members referred to themselves as the Vicious Circle and met almost daily for nearly ten years. Its core members included Dorothy Parker, Franklin P. Adams, Robert Benchley, George S. Kaufman and Harpo Marx, as well as Woollcott and Edna Ferber. Playwright George Bernard Shaw, actress Fanny Brice, and composer Irving Berlin were among the many people who vied for invitations to eat lunch with the club.

Frank Case sent plates of &quot;olives, popovers and celery sticks&quot; to the Round Table&#x27;s members so they would not starve. Case&#x27;s daughter Margaret wrote: &quot;First, the people who sat at the Round Table were interesting people whose doings and sayings caught and held public attention; and secondly, they were as brave, mentally, as any dashing medieval cavalier was physically brave.&quot; The Round Table had a reputation for being witty, although the extent of the group&#x27;s wit may have been exaggerated. Two members of the club, Harold Ross and Jane Grant, founded &quot;The New Yorker&quot; magazine. In celebration of this, modern hotel guests receive free copies of &quot;The New Yorker&quot;.

The group sat at a 15-seat round table, but it is unknown where the original round table was relocated after the Round Table club was disbanded. By the late 1990s, all the tables in the Rose Room were square. The Rose Room was demolished in 1998 to make way for an expansion of the lobby. During that project, the hotel&#x27;s then-owner Camberley Hotel Group added a circular table in the lobby, a homage to the former luncheon group. Hotel guests could reserve the round table; the other tables in the lobby could be used without reservation. The rebuilt round table was relocated to an alcove adjacent to the Blue Bar in 2022.

== Reception and impact ==
When the Algonquin opened in 1902, the &quot;New-York Tribune&quot;—which, according to John Tauranac, seldom described things in hyperbolic terms—called the hotel the &quot;last step in excellence in this class of structure&quot;. By the late 20th century, the Algonquin had become known as a literary landmark, in part because of its association with the Algonquin Round Table. &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote in 2021: &quot;A list of New York literary hotspots would not be complete without the Algonquin, which played host in the 1920s to an assortment of New York writers, playwrights, journalists and actors.&quot; Frank Case had written three books about the hotel during his lifetime, and his daughter, Margaret Case Harriman, wrote a memoir about the hotel in 1956. By the hotel&#x27;s 75th anniversary in 1977, it had been the subject of seven books. The hotel also received &quot;Playbill&quot; magazine&#x27;s first George Selvin Award in 1977.

=== Critical reception ===
Arthur Kaptainis wrote for the &quot;Montreal Gazette&quot; in 1993: &quot;For my money (or lack thereof) the lobby is always the best place to be.&quot; A critic for the &quot;Pittsburgh Post-Gazette&quot; expressed a similar sentiment in 2000, saying that the lobby was &quot;still regarded as the place to see and be seen&quot;, even though room rates were more expensive than at the neighboring Iroquois. Reviewers also described the relatively tranquil nature of the Algonquin compared to newer and larger hostelries. In 1990, Jerry Hulse wrote for the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;: &quot;In a city dwarfed by glass and chrome, the Algonquin remains an anachronism, a landmark of social well-being.&quot; Similarly, a reporter from the &quot;Milwaukee Journal Sentinel&quot; wrote in 1997: &quot;In a city of wrecking balls and cranes, plate glass and cold chrome, incessant sirens and frenetic foot traffic, the Algonquin remains an island of civility.&quot; The &quot;Village Voice&quot; described the Algonquin as one of several monuments to &quot;New York aristocracy&quot; on 44th Street, along with the headquarters of the New York Bar Association, Harvard Club, and Penn Club.

Some critics also wrote about the quality of the hotel itself. Rosalie Earle of the &quot;Sunday Gazette-Mail&quot; wrote in 2010: &quot;The one-bedroom has a king bed and the living room has a pull-out couch, which makes for comfortable and affordable accommodations, when the tab is divided three ways&quot;. Following the 2012 renovation, a &quot;New York Times&quot; critic wrote that the hotel&#x27;s &quot;dowdy charm&quot; had been removed and that &quot;the Algonquin now feels a bit chilly and corporate&quot;. A writer for the &quot;Palm Beach Daily News&quot; said in 2013 that the units had been enlarged into &quot;sleek, sophisticated guest rooms and suites&quot;. By contrast, a writer for &quot;Red Online&quot; magazine said the Algonquin &quot;now enjoys a wood-columned, now almost neo-Edwardian finish—incongruous with its central Midtown location, in the heart of theatre land&quot;. The BBC wrote in 2023 that, while the previous year&#x27;s renovation of the lobby and Blue Bar &quot;may not be to all purists&#x27; tastes&quot;, the hotel still retained some Roaring Twenties design details like caricatures on the walls.

=== Landmark status ===
The Landmarks Preservation Commission considered designating the Algonquin Hotel as an official city landmark in 1985. Unlike other city landmarks, the hotel was known more for its historical associations than for its architecture. The LPC designated the Algonquin Hotel as a city landmark in September 1987. Although the hotel&#x27;s longtime owner Ben Bodne had opposed the designation, its new owner Aoki Corporation supported the city-landmark status. In designating the hotel as a landmark, the LPC cited the impact of the Algonquin Round Table and the number of other literary and theatrical figures who lodged there.

In 1996, the hotel was designated a National Literary Landmark by the Friends of Libraries. The organization&#x27;s bronze plaque is attached to the front of the hotel. The hotel&#x27;s facade contains another plaque, dedicated in 1963. This plaque commemorates a horse stable that previously occupied the site, which had belonged to either Jay Gould or W. H. Aiken. The building is also part of Historic Hotels of America, a program of the National Trust for Historic Preservation.

<doc id="914209" wikidata="Q7230510" url="?curid=914209" title="Port Bolivar, Texas">
<text>Port Bolivar ( ) is an unincorporated community located on the northern shore of the western tip of the Bolivar Peninsula, separated from Galveston Island by the entrance to Galveston Bay. The Bolivar Peninsula itself is a census-designated place, in Galveston County, Texas, United States, and part of the metropolitan area. The entire peninsula was severely damaged during Hurricane Ike on September 13, 2008; re-building efforts were still continuing as late as 2013.

The US Census does not consider Port Bolivar as a separate community, so any population numbers are estimates from unofficial sources. The estimate suggested by City-Data was 1,349 as of 2013. One real estate site suggested 1,477 as of 2014, while another indicated 1,907 as of July 1, 2015.

The community is home to the historic Bolivar Lighthouse, which once guided ships entering Galveston Bay.

==History==
In 1819, James Long based his operations in the area where Port Bolivar would eventually be located.

In 1838, Samuel D Parr surveyed the land, and it was granted to him by the Republic of Texas, to be called Parrsville. It changed hands as Archibald Wynns and William Lawrence bought the land and developed it. The land was later bought by a company and renamed to Port Bolivar in 1893.

Fort Travis is on the southern shore of the Bolivar Peninsula, adjacent to Port Bolivar. Originally the site of the Confederate Fort Green, with a different Fort Travis located on Galveston Island, this Fort Travis started construction in 1898 and adopted the name from the Galveston Island fort. The new fort had its own railroad spur.

The 1915 Galveston hurricane damaged Port Bolivar, and its port was mostly not rebuilt.

Until the Second World War, the Gulf, Colorado and Santa Fe Railway served the length of the peninsula, extending as far west as Port Bolivar, and provided a ferry service to Galveston for railcars. In 1942, the rail service was cut back to High Island, east, where the Bolivar Peninsula expands onto the full mainland. The rails on the Bolivar Peninsula were scrapped for the war effort.

After Hurricane Ike, the United States Postal Service temporarily relocated Port Bolivar post office box services to Winnie, north of High Island.

In 1968, filming began in Port Bolivar on the made-for-television movie, My Sweet Charlie. Starring Patty Duke and Al Freeman Jr., the film focused on the grudging friendship that develops between two fugitives; an outcast, pregnant young white woman, and a black lawyer accused of murder. The actors themselves were targeted for harassment by some local residents, and filming was plagued with problems until then-governor, John Connally, intervened and worked with local authorities to stop harassment of the production company and the actors.

==Transportation==

Ferry service is provided by the Texas Department of Transportation between Port Bolivar and Galveston. The Galveston-Port Bolivar ferry can accommodate vehicles as heavy as 80,000 pounds, and as long as 65 feet, as high as 13.5 feet and as wide as 8.5 feet. The ferry was closed because of Hurricane Ike but re-opened on November 11, 2008.

== Education ==
Port Bolivar residents are zoned to Galveston Independent School District schools.

Residents attend Crenshaw Elementary and Middle School for grades Pre-K3 through 8 on the peninsula. Residents attend Ball High School in Galveston. there are no particular attendance boundaries in GISD so parents may apply to any school they wish, but only Bolivar Peninsula residents may have school bus service to Crenshaw K-8.

The Crenshaw school was located in Port Bolivar until it was damaged by Hurricane Ike. A resident of Crystal Beach, east of Port Bolivar, donated land there for a new Crenshaw campus, which opened in 2005.

Galveston ISD (and therefore Port Bolivar) is assigned to Galveston College in Galveston.

==Parks and recreation==
The Galveston County Department of Parks &amp; Cultural Services, that includes Senior Services, operates the Bolivar Community Center, 1802 Madison Avenue, the Fort Travis Seashore Park at 900 State Highway 87, and the Pilsner Boat Ramp.

== Postal service ==
The United States Postal Service operates the Post Office at 2500 Broadway Avenue, Port Bolivar, TX 77650 - 0736. There is no home delivery on the Bolivar peninsula, only rural delivery.

== Religion ==
The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Galveston-Houston maintains the nearby Our Lady By The Sea Chapel and Catholic Center in Crystal Beach. Its service area is the entire peninsula. This site is a part of the Holy Family Parish, which has other sites on Galveston Island.

Our Mother of Mercy Church established circa 1950, was previously in Port Bolivar. John Nova Lomax of the &quot;Houston Press&quot; wrote that the church &quot;was the site of many marriages and funerals for generations of Bolivarians.&quot; It closed after Hurricane Ike in 2008. At the end of its life, its congregation numbered 75, although in summer months vacationers also attended church there. Lomax described it as &quot;a dowdy, declining parish&quot;. Archbishop Joseph Fiorenza had it razed, despite the lack of damage from the hurricane. The archdiocese argued that keeping the structure would cause further expenses, and that future weather issues could damage the building. Lomax wrote &quot;the archdiocese viewed the church as old and in the way&quot;.

Between Hurricane Ike and the opening of Our Lady by the Sea, Bolivar residents attended church in Galveston or in Winnie. John Nova Lomax of the &quot;Houston Press&quot; wrote that the Our Lady church, dedicated in 2010 and on the site of the former St Therese of Lisieux, &quot;effectively consolidates [St Therese of Lisieux in Crystal Beach] and [Our Mother of Mercy]&quot;. Residents opposed to the demolition of Our Mother of Mercy expressed a negative reception to the opening of Our Lady by the Sea.

<doc id="914212" wikidata="Q157719" url="?curid=914212" title="Greatest Hits (Queen album)">
<text>Greatest Hits is a compilation album by the British rock band Queen, released worldwide on 26 October 1981. The album consisted of Queen&#x27;s biggest hits since their first chart appearance in 1974 with &quot;Seven Seas of Rhye&quot;, up to their 1980 hit &quot;Flash&quot; (though in some countries &quot;Under Pressure&quot;, the band&#x27;s 1981 chart-topper with David Bowie, was included). There was no universal track listing or cover art for the album, and each territory&#x27;s tracks were dependent on what singles had been released there and which were successful. In 1992, the US version of the album &quot;Classic Queen&quot; was released following the band&#x27;s rekindled popularity in the nation.

&quot;Greatest Hits&quot; is the band&#x27;s best-selling album to date, with total sales of over 25 million copies, making it one of the best-selling albums of all time. It reached number one on the UK Albums Chart, spending four weeks at the top and sold consistently well throughout the 1980s, becoming the fourth-biggest selling album of the decade. The single &quot;Under Pressure&quot;, which was released the same week as &quot;Greatest Hits&quot;, also topped the UK Singles Chart.

As of February 2025, &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; has spent 1,142 weeks on the UK Albums Chart and has been certified 23× platinum with sales of over seven million copies, making it the best-selling album of all time in the UK.

&quot;Greatest Hits&quot; peaked at number eight on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 in November 2020, the second-slowest ascent to the top ten of the US album chart in history. Among the longest charting albums in the US, as of March 2025, it has spent 635 weeks on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and has been certified 9× platinum in the US. It has also been certified 15× platinum in Australia, 10× platinum in New Zealand, and 3× platinum in Canada. Following the release of the Queen biopic &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot; in 2018, it re-entered the charts worldwide.

== Release ==
There was no universal track listing or cover art for the &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; album, and each territory&#x27;s tracks were dependent on what singles were released there and what tracks charted. In some territories, despite the band&#x27;s popularity, not enough songs were issued as singles to fill a compilation album, and a few album tracks were used as filler. Some examples of these were &quot;Sweet Lady&quot; and &quot;Love of My Life&quot;, neither of which was released as a single in any country but appear on some regions&#x27; 1981 &quot;Hits&quot; release. In the UK, the album was limited to the Queen singles that had reached the top 20 in the UK singles chart up to that point, plus &quot;We Will Rock You&quot;, which had been the B-side of &quot;We Are the Champions&quot;.

The US ended up with its original mono edit of Queen&#x27;s first single release, &quot;Keep Yourself Alive&quot;, originally released in 1973 and re-released in the US in 1975, following the success of &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot;. The US version also added &quot;Under Pressure&quot;, Queen&#x27;s collaboration with David Bowie, which was released the same week as &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; and subsequently topped the UK Singles Chart and reached the top ten in many charts around the world. However, the song was not included on the European versions of &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; – according to Queen&#x27;s business manager Jim Beach, this was because the longer manufacturing time required to press records in Europe meant that several hundred thousand copies of the album had already been pressed up before the song had been recorded.

In Argentina and Brazil, the LP edition included the same track listing as the UK &quot;Greatest Hits&quot;, minus &quot;Seven Seas of Rhye&quot; and including &quot;Love of My Life&quot; (&quot;Live Killers&quot; version). The CD version is the same as the British version.

The cover photo that appeared on the UK and US release was taken by Lord Snowdon at his home studio, using only natural light. For the 1981 release, the photo was skewed, but was later presented as it was originally taken for the 2011 re-release.

In 1991, Queen sought to issue a second &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; collection worldwide, this time with a standard track listing. However, the band had just changed record labels in the US, from Capitol to Hollywood Records, who were keen on a massive promotion of the band&#x27;s back catalogue. The problem was that Elektra still held the US rights to that first 1981 collection (despite being Hollywood&#x27;s US licensee). Hollywood Records decided not to release &quot;Greatest Hits II&quot; to the US market, but instead created their own collection, &quot;Classic Queen&quot; (1992), peaking at number four on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart. This compilation was made up of tracks such as &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot;, &quot;Keep Yourself Alive&quot; and &quot;Under Pressure&quot; (which had already appeared on the Elektra 1981 &quot;Hits&quot; collection), as well as newer tracks (&quot;A Kind of Magic&quot; and &quot;Radio Ga Ga&quot;). Some tracks were not even singles in the US (&quot;One Year of Love&quot;) or anywhere (&quot;Stone Cold Crazy&quot;). Though well received, this collection would eventually pose the problem of overlapping track lists in the future.

Later that year, Hollywood Records released a companion collection, &quot;Greatest Hits&quot;, with similar artwork (on a red background, where &quot;Classic Queen&quot; was on royal blue). Commonly referred to as the &quot;Red Greatest Hits&quot;, it features most of the &#x27;70s tracks absent from &quot;Classic Queen&quot; (including &quot;Another One Bites the Dust&quot;, &quot;We Will Rock You&quot;, &quot;We Are the Champions&quot; and &quot;Killer Queen&quot;).

In 2004, to promote the Las Vegas production of the musical &quot;We Will Rock You&quot;, Hollywood Records released &quot;Greatest Hits: We Will Rock You Edition&quot;, which was the UK &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; with three bonus tracks.

== &quot;Greatest Flix&quot; and &quot;Greatest Pix&quot; ==
&quot;Greatest Hits&quot; was released alongside &quot;Greatest Flix&quot;, a 60-minute compilation released on VHS video, LaserDisc, and CED Videodisc of all the videos Queen had made up until that point in chronological order, and &quot;Greatest Pix&quot;, a 96-page paperback book edited by Jacques Lowe which featured photos of the band taken by Neal Preston. Although &quot;Greatest Flix&quot; only listed 17 videos on its sleeve, it contained two videos for &quot;We Will Rock You&quot;. The video for &quot;Killer Queen&quot; had been shot especially for &quot;Greatest Flix&quot;, as no video had been made for the song on its original release in 1974. In the US, the release of &quot;Greatest Flix&quot; was scheduled for 15 November 1981 on Warner Home Video, but distribution was switched to EMI Music after the band&#x27;s management disagreed with Warner&#x27;s recent decision to move to a rental-only programme instead of selling their videos. In 1992, Hollywood Records released a VHS version to accompany the album, simply called &quot;Greatest Hits&quot;.

Note: New videos were created for Now I&#x27;m Here, Seven Seas Of Rhye and Good Old-Fashioned Lover Boy for this collection, as they did not previously have music videos.

== Critical reception and legacy ==

Initial reviews of the album in the British music press were negative. In &quot;NME&quot; Barney Hoskyns said, &quot;All of [their songs], besides &#x27;Another One Bites the Dust&#x27;, are quite repulsive, unbelievably crass insults to their respective genres and uniformly vulgar music. It was only when Queen took vulgarity to its absolute limit that they stood out.&quot; &quot;Melody Maker&quot;″s Adam Sweeting stated, &quot;I&#x27;ve never been the slightest bit interested in Queen&#x27;s ridiculous pomposity and Freddie just makes me snigger, but I suppose songs like &#x27;Killer Queen&#x27; are sort of catchy, while anything as preposterous as &#x27;We Will Rock You&#x27; deserves an award if only for bad taste&quot;.

However, retrospective reviews have rated the album higher: Ira Robbins gave &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; a B+ rating in &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; upon its reissue in 1992, and AllMusic awarded the record four and a half stars out of five. In an interview in 2003 as part of the Arte television programme &quot;Music Planet 2Nite&quot;, Radiohead guitarist Ed O&#x27;Brien hailed the album as &quot;impeccable&quot; and &quot;absolutely genius&quot;.

== Commercial performance ==
In the UK, &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; debuted at number two on the UK Albums Chart and climbed to number one the following week, spending four weeks at the top. The album continued to sell well throughout the 1980s, appearing on several UK year-end charts, and by the end of the decade it had become the fourth-biggest selling album in the UK during the 1980s, with sales of over 1.9 million copies. By 2006, &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; had become the best-selling album in the UK and the first album to sell more than five million copies there. In February 2014, &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; became the first album in the UK to sell over six million copies, and it was claimed that one in three families in the UK owned a copy. In June 2022, &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; spent its 1,000th week on the UK Albums Chart, and in July 2022, it reached seven million sales, with one in four households in the UK estimated to have a copy of the album. As of February 2025, the album has spent 1,142 weeks in the top 100 of the UK Albums Chart.

In the US, &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; sold moderately well on initial release in 1981, obtaining a platinum certification. It reached a new peak of number 11 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart on its reissue in 1992, and finally made the top ten of the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 in November 2020 when it peaked at number eight, as a result of a Walmart sale on various vinyl albums on 14 November 2020. The 39 years and one month that the album took to reach the top ten of the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 is the second-longest ascent to the top ten in the history of the US album chart. One of the longest charting albums in the US, as of March 2025 it has spent 635 weeks on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; has now been certified nine times platinum in the US for sales of nine million copies, making it the band&#x27;s best-selling album in that country. It is also the band&#x27;s best-selling album to date, with total sales of over 25 million copies.

== Track listing ==
This section includes the track listings for the original &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; in its various forms. For other compilations, including the second and third &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; albums, see the relevant articles.

<doc id="914226" wikidata="Q3289783" url="?curid=914226" title="ByWard Market">
<text>The ByWard Market (), is a retail and entertainment district in the downtown core of Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. It is located east of the government and business district. The Market district includes the market buildings and open-air market along George, York, ByWard, and William street.

The district is bordered westwardly by Sussex Drive and Mackenzie Avenue, and eastwardly by Cumberland Street. It stretches northwards to Cathcart Street, while to the south it is bordered by Rideau Street. The name refers to the old &quot;By Ward&quot; of the City of Ottawa (&#x27;By&#x27; deriving from the surname of the engineer, John By, who was the area&#x27;s original surveyor). The district comprises the main commercial part of the historic Lower Town area of Ottawa. According to the Canada 2011 Census, the population of the area was 3,063.
The market itself is regulated by a City of Ottawa municipal services corporation named the ByWard Market District Authority, which also operates the smaller west-end Parkdale Market. The corporation is run by a nine-member board of directors. The market building is open year-round, and open-air stalls offering fresh produce and flowers are operated in the warmer months.

==Neighbourhood==
Traditionally, the ByWard Market area has been a focal point for Ottawa&#x27;s French and Irish communities. The large Catholic community supported the construction of the Notre-Dame Cathedral Basilica, one of the largest and oldest Roman Catholic churches in Ottawa. The shape of the cathedral was taken into account in the design of the National Gallery of Canada, which was built across Sussex Drive.

The ByWard Market has been an area of constant change, adapting to the increasingly cosmopolitan nature of downtown Ottawa, as well as trends in Canadian society as a whole. Recently, a multitude of restaurants and specialty food stores have sprouted around the market area, making this neighbourhood one of the liveliest in Ottawa outside of normal business hours. A four-block area around the market provides the densest concentration of eating places, bars, and nightclubs in the National Capital Region. The areas beyond this zone also offer boutiques and restaurants in abundance, and are frequented by a considerable number of buskers. Having acquired a reputation as the city&#x27;s premier bar district, the Byward Market is thronged (brimming) at night with university students and other young adults.
Over the years, the city has developed five open-air courtyards immediately east of Sussex Drive, stretching from Saint Patrick Street to George Street. These cobblestone courtyards are filled with flowers, park benches, fountains, and sculptures. Several of the houses surrounding them are historic buildings. On the west side of Sussex Drive is the United States Embassy. The building&#x27;s design, by noted architect David Childs, was supposedly widely criticized by surrounding residents, as one particular &quot;Ottawa Sun&quot; newspaper article reported that the bronze building-block sculpture created by Joel Shapiro and dedicated by Hillary Clinton was &quot;glaringly and gratingly American&quot;, whereas some critics declared that the building&#x27;s new design &quot;reflected a cautious world view&quot;.

The neighbourhood today is markedly heterogeneous; being visited by a mix of young professionals, many families, and tourists. The area is mainly English-speaking, but there exists a significant francophone population as well. The Market is located in close proximity to the downtown Rideau Centre shopping mall, to Parliament Hill, and to a number of foreign embassies.


In October 2000, broadcaster CHUM Limited opened a new studio complex in the ByWard Market at 87 George Street, known as the &quot;CHUM MarketMediaMall.&quot; CHUM&#x27;s then-NewNet station CHRO moved its primary operations from its original facilities in Pembroke to the new building (including a &quot;Speaker&#x27;s Corner&quot; video booth); the facility also housed CHUM Radio stations CKKL-FM, CJMJ-FM, CFRA and CFGO. The facility came under CTV ownership when CTVglobemedia bought CHUM Limited in 2006, and then under Bell ownership when Bell Media re-purchased the CTV assets in 2011. When a fire broke out at the studio complex of CTV owned-and-operated station CJOH-DT in Nepean in 2010, destroying it, this meant CJOH moved into the MarketMediaMall complex as well.

<text>Ambrose &quot;Rowdy&quot; Gaines IV (born February 17, 1959) is an American former competitive swimmer, U.S. Olympic Hall of Fame member, three-time Olympic gold medalist, and member of the International Swimming Hall of Fame. He is referred to as &quot;The Voice of Swimming&quot;, has covered swimming at the Olympic Games since 1992 in Barcelona and is currently a swimming analyst for television network NBC.

==Early life==
Gaines was born in Winter Haven, Florida to Jettie Ann and Ambrose &quot;Buddy&quot; Gaines, who met there as water skiers at Cypress Gardens in the 1950s. Gaines tried several sports during his teenage years, but turned to swimming as a Winter Haven High School junior at age 17. He received a swimming scholarship to Auburn University. At Auburn, he became a five-time NCAA champion under the training of head coach Richard Quick.

==Career==
From 1978 to 1984, Gaines set 10 world records. At the time, he was the world record holder in the 100-meter and 200-meter freestyles. The 1980 boycott prevented Gaines from competing at the 1980 Moscow Olympics. Gaines said the boycott came at a time when he considered himself at his peak, and that he believed he missed an opportunity for four gold medals.

Gaines qualified for the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, California. He won gold in the 100-meter freestyle and two gold medals for relays, swimming the anchor legs for the U.S. team in the 4×100-meter freestyle relay and 4×100-meter medley relay.

Gaines said he experienced mental health issues after missing out on the 1980 Games and had &quot;some real trouble post-Olympics, and...some big struggles, especially the year after.&quot;

==Commentating==
He began covering swimming for NBC at the Atlanta 1996 Summer Olympics. He also was the analyst at the Sydney 2000 Summer Olympics, the Athens 2004 Summer Olympics, the Beijing 2008 Summer Olympics, the London 2012 Summer Olympics, the Rio 2016 Summer Olympics, the Tokyo 2020 Summer Olympics held in 2021, and the Paris 2024 Summer Olympics. Gaines announced on Instagram that the Los Angeles 2028 Summer Olympics will be his last, announcing his retirement to be a full time grandfather.

At the 2011 Short Course Masters Nationals, Gaines broke his national record in the 50–54 division 50 yard freestyle (21.36). On July 16, 2011, Gaines broke the 50–54 Age Group record in the long course 100m freestyle with a time of 54.6.

Gaines is the executive director of Rowdy’s Kidz, a wellness initiative developed and supported by The Limu Company that reaches out to children across the country.

Gaines and his wife, Judy, reside in Lake Mary, Florida, with their four daughters.

<text>A Rolodex is a rotating card file device used to store a contact list. Its name, a portmanteau of the words &quot;rolling&quot; and &quot;index&quot;, has become somewhat genericized for any personal organizer performing this function, or as a metonym for a total accumulation of business contacts. In this usage, it has generally come to describe an effect or characteristic of the small-world network of a business&#x27;s investors, board of directors, or the value of a CEO&#x27;s contacts, or in organizational structure. Models have been exhibited in the Smithsonian Institution.

==History==
The Rolodex was invented in 1956 by Danish engineer Hildaur Neilsen, the chief engineer of Arnold Neustadter&#x27;s company Zephyr American, a stationery manufacturer in New York. Neustadter was often credited with having invented it. First marketed in 1958, it was an improvement to an earlier design called the &quot;Wheeldex&quot;. Zephyr American also invented, manufactured and sold the &quot;Autodex&quot;, a spring-operated phone directory that automatically opened to the selected letter; &quot;Swivodex&quot;, an inkwell that did not spill; &quot;Punchodex&quot;, a paper hole puncher; and &quot;Clipodex&quot;, an office aid that attached to a stenographer&#x27;s knee. 
Rolodex also marketed non-rotary (linear) tub-like card-file systems using the same cards (size and notches) as the rotary files. 

Neustadter retired and sold out to a larger firm in 1970. The Rolodex remained popular throughout the 1980s, and individual Rolodexes containing a large amount of information were considered valuable, and lawsuits were filed by companies against employees who attempted to take their Rolodex with them when leaving the company. A 1985 episode of the detective TV series &quot;Moonlighting&quot; involved a stolen Rolodex being ransomed for $50,000 — a figure reflecting the value of the data it contained. The system fell out of widespread use in the 2000s, as digital storage became the norm. However, Rolodex cards are still produced, and have a niche usership.

<text>Der Kommissar (English &quot;The Police Inspector&quot;) is a German television series about a group of detectives of the Munich homicide squad (&quot;Mordkommission&quot;). All 97 episodes (55 minutes each), which were shot in black-and-white and first broadcast between 1969 and 1976, were written by Herbert Reinecker and starred Erik Ode as Kommissar Herbert Keller. Keller&#x27;s assistants were Walter Grabert (Günther Schramm), Robert Heines (Reinhard Glemnitz), and Harry Klein (Fritz Wepper) who, in 1974, was replaced by his younger brother (also in real life) Erwin Klein (Elmar Wepper).

== History ==
Today considered cult television, &quot;Der Kommissar&quot; had many of the ingredients of the whodunnit: a murder victim, often unidentified at first; a group of suspects who gradually emerge as the police gather all the evidence available to them; and a police detective who, by sheer reasoning, figures out all by himself who the murderer is, while he has his assistants do all the legwork. In some episodes, Kommissar Keller even asks everyone to gather at the scene of the crime so that he, in the manner of Hercule Poirot, can reconstruct the events leading up to, and following, the killing so that the murderer can eventually be arrested.

In &quot;Der Kommissar&quot;, author Herbert Reinecker neatly captures the zeitgeist of the late 1960s and early 1970s by presenting many young characters that are involved in a crime. These young people usually wear trendy clothes and listen to the songs from the hit parade, be it at home or in seedy pubs, night clubs, or discotheques. In Reinecker&#x27;s world, a young girl who leaves her parents and moves from the country to the anonymous and evil big city—Munich—will necessarily end up as either a prostitute, or a drug addict, or a murder victim, or all of the above.

Also, at a time of shifting moral standards in the wake of the Sexual Revolution, Keller can only shake his head—only inwardly though—at the follies of middle-aged bourgeois people who think they can practise infidelity and get away with it unscathed. As a matter of fact &quot;Der Kommissar&quot; is full of bizarre relationships: There is the middle-aged wife of an academic who starts an affair with the young waiter of the local restaurant although the latter lives in a rented room and his landlady sees and hears everything; there is the wealthy entrepreneur who takes a liking to the attractive wife of his live-in servant and who arranges for her to spend the nights with him upstairs in the master bedroom; and there is the mother of a teenage daughter who, whenever her husband is working the night shift, sleeps with a boy the same age as her daughter.

However, Kommissar Keller&#x27;s ways are also rather contentious by today&#x27;s standards. He is hardly ever seen without a burning cigarette; he regularly drinks on duty; and he addresses everyone who works in his office with the familiar &quot;du&quot; but at the same time expects them to use the much more formal &quot;Sie&quot; when talking to him. Keller justifies that habit of his in his very first conversation with Erwin Klein (1974):
Ich muss dir gleich etwas sagen. Ich habe vielleicht die etwas schlechte Angewohnheit, meine Mitarbeiter bei der täglichen Arbeit zu duzen. Und das ärgert manche Leute, die finden das nicht richtig und die halten das für autoritär, das ist natürlich vollkommener Quatsch mit Soße. Ich duze euch, weil ihr mir näher steht als alle anderen und weil es vielleicht ein bisschen zu spät sein dürfte, mich jetzt noch zu ändern. Begreifst du das?

&quot;I have to tell you one thing right away. I may have the bad habit of &quot;duzen&quot; (using the informal address &quot;du&quot; to) my work colleagues in our daily job. Some people are annoyed by that, they don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s right, they think it&#x27;s authoritarian. This is baloney of course. I &quot;duze&quot; (use the informal address &quot;du&quot; to) you because you are closer to me than anyone else and because it may be a bit too late for me to change. Do you understand?&quot;

Over the years, an impressive number of guest actors and actresses appeared on the show, with even the odd UFA star among them. The guests were, to name just a few, Heinz Bennent (twice), Anton Diffring, Hannelore Elsner (twice), Peter van Eyck, Götz George (three times), Raimund Harmstorf, Johannes Heesters, Paul Hubschmid, Gottfried John, Curd Jürgens (twice), Christine Kaufmann, Helmut Käutner, Marianne Koch, Christiane Krüger (three times), Ruth Leuwerik, Lilli Palmer, Eric Pohlmann (twice), Wolfgang Preiss, Charles Régnier (three times), Heinz Reincke (twice), Walter Rilla, Maria Schell (three times), Nadja Tiller, Margarethe von Trotta (three times), Karl Michael Vogler, Bernhard Wicki (twice) and Sonja Ziemann.

In 1974, two years before the final episode of &quot;The Kommissar&quot; was broadcast, Reinecker launched a new series, &quot;Derrick&quot;, establishing some kind of continuity by promoting Harry Klein, now Derrick&#x27;s assistant, to the post of &quot;Inspektor&quot; (in the same building, &quot;just down the corridor&quot;).

<doc id="914241" wikidata="Q4421415" url="?curid=914241" title="Tales of the Riverbank">
<text>Tales of the Riverbank, sometimes called Hammy Hamster and Once Upon a Hamster for the Canadian version, is a British children&#x27;s television series developed from a Canadian pilot. The original series was later broadcast on Canadian and U.S. television, dubbed by Canadian and US actors for the markets they were to be broadcast in.

The pilot was created by David Ellison and Paul Sutherland, CBC film editors, in 1959. After completing the pilot programme, CBC turned down the production and so Dave Ellison travelled to the BBC in London to show it. The BBC initially commissioned thirteen episodes, but extended this later. A second series was made in colour in the 1970s, narrated by Johnny Morris.

==Revival==
A later remake was produced by Canada&#x27;s YTV and Channel 4 in 1995 which ran for three years, and a feature-length film was made in 2008 using puppets rather than live animals.

==Format==
The programme had human voices in sync with the actions of the live animals, to give the impression that the creatures were performing activities. They lived in a place called &quot;The Riverbank&quot; and operated various artefacts including toy sailboats, cars, and even a diving bell. Various techniques were used to persuade the animals to do what was required, including smearing jam on the objects they were to handle. The voices were selected to reflect the personalities of the animals. Each episode ended with the narrator alluding to an event involving the characters, but refusing to elaborate, saying &quot;But that is &quot;another&quot; story.&quot;

The original black and white &quot;Tales of the Riverbank&quot; series was first shown by the BBC on 3 July 1960 at 4:50 pm. It was originally narrated by Paul Sutherland, but the BBC did not want Canadian accents and so for the BBC showings, all the voices were provided by Johnny Morris. The series was eventually sold to 34 countries around the world.

==Telecast and home release==
In the U.S., The show also aired on the Animal Planet during the late 1990s and early 2000s.

=== UK VHS releases ===

=== UK DVD releases ===

=== US DVD releases ===

==Further episodes==
After the original thirteen episodes, 39 further episodes were made in black-and-white. The majority were written by David Ellison, Charles Fullman, Paul Sutherland and Cliff Braggins. The episodes of &quot;Tales of the Riverbank&quot; purchased by the BBC were adapted by staff writer Peggy Miller. Much of the filming was done on location at Wootton Creek on the Isle of Wight.

A later series with 26 episodes was filmed in colour in the 1970s, retitled &quot;Hammy Hamster&quot; (full title: &quot;Hammy Hamster&#x27;s Adventures On the Riverbank&quot;) launched in 1972. The BBC had introduced a policy of not using human voices for live animals and so this series was shown in the UK by ITV. In Australia, the show aired on ABC TV through the 1970s as &quot;Adventures on the River Bank&quot;.

The final series, dubbed &quot;Further Tales of the Riverbank&quot;, made from 1991 to 1992, was produced for WTTV and Channel 4; 26 episodes of that series were made. It is ranked 79th in Channel 4&#x27;s 2001 poll of the &quot;100 Greatest Kids&#x27; TV shows&quot;. This series was the only one to have been released on DVD, in a set of three DVDs published in-house by Hammytime Productions UK.

In the United States, &quot;Once Upon A Hamster&quot; was broadcast in a late-night slot, which helped the programme transcend its intended audience and develop a cult status among US viewers.

The late Dave Ellison launched his own website to regularly update information about Hammy Hamster and his friends. He was also involved with optimising the TV show, last shown on Channel 4, for release on DVD.

Three children&#x27;s books were published by Scholastic Publications Ltd in 1993 based on the series and illustrated by Pauline Hazelwood.

==Main characters==
In the later series the list of characters was expanded from the original first three listed below.

==Feature film==
A feature-length film, also titled &quot;Tales of the Riverbank&quot;, was released in September 2008 directly to DVD. It used a mix of puppets, live action, and special effects. Directed by John Henderson, produced by Handmade Pictures and starring Stephen Fry as Owl, Ardal O&#x27;Hanlon as Hammy, Steve Coogan as Roderick and Jim Broadbent as G. P., the story follows three friends who live in a riverbank. After being swept away from their homes by a storm, they embark on an adventure to find their home and save it from the danger of the Fat Cats&#x27; factory.

==US news broadcast accidental reference==
A publicity image by David Ellison of Hammy Hamster holding a clapperboard made an unexpected appearance on a January 2009 news broadcast regarding the disappearance of a young girl named Molly Bish. During a report regarding the questioning of a potential suspect eight years after the girl&#x27;s disappearance, an error resulted in the image of Hammy Hamster being shown instead of a photo of the potential suspect.

<text>Avery Robert Dulles ( ; August 24, 1918 – December 12, 2008) was an American Jesuit priest, theologian, and cardinal of the Catholic Church. Dulles served on the faculty of Woodstock College from 1960 to 1974, of the Catholic University of America from 1974 to 1988, and as the Laurence J. McGinley Professor of Religion and Society at Fordham University from 1988 to 2008. He was also an author and lecturer.

==Early life==
Dulles was born in Auburn, New York, on August 24, 1918, the son of John Foster Dulles, the future U.S. Secretary of State (for whom Washington Dulles International Airport is named), and Janet Pomeroy Avery Dulles. His uncle was Director of Central Intelligence Allen Dulles. Both his great-grandfather John W. Foster and great-uncle Robert Lansing also served as secretary of state. His paternal grandfather, Allen Macy Dulles, was a member of the faculty of the Presbyterian Auburn Theological Seminary and published in the field of ecclesiology, to which his grandson would likewise devote scholarly attention as a Catholic.

He received his primary school education in New York City at the St. Bernard&#x27;s School and attended secondary schools in Switzerland and the Choate School (now Choate Rosemary Hall) in Wallingford, Connecticut. He then enrolled at Harvard College in 1936.

Dulles was raised a Presbyterian but had become an agnostic by the time he was a student at Harvard. His religious doubts were diminished during a personally profound moment when he stepped out into a rainy day and saw a tree beginning to flower along the Charles River; after that moment he never again &quot;doubted the existence of an all-good and omnipotent God.&quot; He noted how his theism turned toward conversion to Catholicism: &quot;The more I examined, the more I was impressed with the consistency and sublimity of Catholic doctrine.&quot; He converted to Catholicism in the fall of 1940, much to the ire of his father, who nearly disowned him as a result.

After both winning the Phi Beta Kappa Essay Prize and graduating from Harvard in 1940, Dulles spent a year and a half at Harvard Law School, during which time he co-founded the &quot;St. Benedict Center&quot; with Catherine Goddard Clarke. The center later became well known due to the controversial Jesuit priest Leonard Feeney. Dulles served in the United States Navy during World War II, attaining the rank of Lieutenant. For his liaison work with the French Navy, Dulles was awarded the French Croix de Guerre.

==Society of Jesus and elevation to cardinal==
Upon his discharge from the Navy in 1946, Dulles entered the Society of Jesus, and was ordained to the priesthood in 1956. After a year in Germany, he studied ecclesiology under the American Jesuit Francis A. Sullivan at the Gregorian University in Rome, and was awarded the doctorate of sacred theology in 1960.

Dulles served on the faculty of Woodstock College from 1960 to 1974, and at the Catholic University of America from 1974 to 1988. He was a visiting professor at the Gregorian University (Rome), Weston School of Theology, Union Theological Seminary (New York), Princeton Theological Seminary, Virginia Theological Seminary, Lutheran Theological Seminary at Gettysburg, Boston College, Campion Hall, Oxford, the University of Notre Dame, the Catholic University at Leuven, Yale University, and St. Joseph&#x27;s Seminary, Dunwoodie. He was the author of over 700 articles on theological topics, as well as twenty-two books. In 1994, he was a signer of the document &quot;Evangelicals and Catholics Together.&quot;

Past president of both the Catholic Theological Society of America and the American Theological Society, and professor emeritus at the Catholic University of America, Dulles served on the International Theological Commission and as a member of the United States Lutheran-Catholic Dialogue.

Dulles was critical of dual-covenant theology, especially as understood in the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops&#x27; document &quot;Reflections on Covenant and Mission&quot;. He was a consultant to the Committee on Doctrine of the National Conference of Catholic Bishops.

Although Jesuits make a promise not to pursue ecclesiastical dignities and do not normally accept promotion within the Church hierarchy, Dulles was created a cardinal on February 21, 2001, by Pope John Paul II. He was not made a bishop, as is normally the case, as the pope had granted him a dispensation. His titular church and assignment was as Cardinal-Deacon of SS. Nome di Gesù e Maria in Via Lata. Because he had reached the age of 80 before becoming cardinal, Dulles was never eligible to vote in a conclave. Dulles became an honorary, non-voting member of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops.

==Honors and awards==
Dulles&#x27; awards included Phi Beta Kappa, the Croix de Guerre, the Cardinal Spellman Award for distinguished achievement in theology, the Boston College Presidential Bicentennial Award, the Christus Magister Medal from the University of Portland (Oregon), the Religious Education Forum Award from the National Catholic Educational Association, &quot;America&quot; magazine&#x27;s Campion Award, the F. Sadlier Dinger Award for contributions to the catechetical ministry of the Church, the James Cardinal Gibbons Award from The Catholic University of America, the John Carroll Society Medal, the Jerome Award from the Catholic Library Association, Fordham Founders Award, Gaudium Award from the Breukelein Institute, and thirty-three honorary doctorates.

==Farewell address and death==
In his later years, the cardinal lived with the effects of polio he had contracted in his youth. On April 1, 2008, Dulles gave his farewell address as Laurence J. McGinley Professor of Religion and Society. As Dulles was unable to speak, Fordham president Fr. Joseph O&#x27;Hare, S.J., read his address. In addition to the loss of speech, the use of his arms was impaired but his mind remained clear and he continued to work and communicate using his computer keyboard. Fr Joseph McShane, SJ also presented him with the university&#x27;s President&#x27;s Medal that evening. April 1, 2008 also marked the date the Cardinal&#x27;s book, &quot;Church and Society: The Laurence J. McGinley Lectures, 1988–2007&quot; (Fordham University Press, 2008) was released.

In his Farewell Lecture, the cardinal reflected on his weakening condition:

On April 19, 2008, Pope Benedict XVI paid a visit to the ailing Dulles during his visit to the United States. Dulles prepared his written remarks to the pope prior to the visit.

Dulles died at 90 on December 12, 2008, at Fordham University in the Bronx, where he had lived for many years. His remains were buried in the Jesuit cemetery in Auriesville, New York.

==Works==
Dulles wrote 25 books and hundreds of articles and essays. A &quot;catalogue raisonné&quot; including his many translations, forewords, introductions, reviews and letters to the editor, was published by Fordham University Press in 2012 under the title &quot;The Legacy of Avery Cardinal Dulles, S.J.: His Words and His Witness&quot;.

<text>Hoi Ha Wan () or Jone&#x27;s Cove is a bay at the north of Sai Kung Peninsula. It is part of Hoi Ha Wan Marine Park, a marine park in Hong Kong. The village of Hoi Ha is located on the innermost shore of Hoi Ha Wan.

The location has a high biological value, as it shows significant biodiversity. That is because the Park is a sheltered bay with pristine water quality, so that it provides a good marine environment for housing a great variety of marine organisms. Numerous kinds of corals can be ascertained under the sea, and it is a hot spot for diving. So as to keep the local ecosystems away from human intervention, fishing, particularly bottom trawling and uses of dynamites or poisons like cyanides, collecting sea products and corals are prohibited by law.
==Geography==
Covering an area of around , the seaward boundary of the park is demarcated by linking the tips of Heung Lo Kok and Kwun Tsoi Kok through the northern end of Flat Island (Ngan Chau) and Moon Island (Mo Chau). The landward boundary follows the high-water mark along the coastline. The Wan Tsai peninsula forms the western seashore of Hoi Ha Wan.

==Ecology==

===Mangrove communities===
Like the nursery grounds in Mai Po, Hoi Ha Wan also offers a mangrove community occupying about . Along with a buffer zone between the tidal waters and the land, the mangrove woods are commonly act an ecologically sustainable habitat for juvenile fishes and other intertidal and subtidal invertebrates.

===Marine communities===
Hoi Ha Wan Marine Park has lush coral communities. Most of the stony coral species recorded in Hong Kong can be found in this marine park. 100-odd species of reef-associated fishes have been recorded in Hoi Ha Wan. In addition, records of wide variety of marine animals, like starfish and jellyfish, in the Park further demonstrates its ecological significance.

Reef Check through AFCD performed by local British Sub-Aqua Club diving enthusiasts &#x27;Ydive&#x27; , and Li Po Chun United World College&#x27;s Coral Monitoring Team has annually monitored coral &amp; marine life variety &amp; density since 1992.

=== World Wildlife Fund Marine Life Centre ===
The Jockey Club HSBC WWF Hong Kong Hoi Ha Marine Life Centre is based in the marine park and offers students and the community opportunities to appreciate Hong Kong&#x27;s valuable marine resources. To increase public understanding and participation in biodiversity monitoring WWF Hong Kong have been increasingly getting involved in Citizen Science, incorporating iNaturalist and the City Nature Challenge activities into their sites across Hong Kong including Hoi Ha Wan.

==History==
There are also the remnants of limekilns. There are total of four lime kilns in Hoi Ha Wan but only two remain comparatively intact. They are located on the eastern shore of inner Hoi Ha Wan. The lime kiln industry was one of the oldest industries (1800–1939) in Hong Kong, which refined lime from either oyster shells or coral skeletons for construction and agricultural uses. In the processes, limestone, i.e. calcium carbonate, in the shells and corals would be transformed into calcium oxide by means of heating.

==Transport==

Hoi Ha Wan can be reached by taking the New Territories Green Minibus route number 7 at Sai Kung Town Centre. The minibus provides service at daytime every day, every 30 minutes. The first bus leaves from Sai Kung at 7:55am, from the bus stop outside the 7-11 convenience store by the pier. The last bus departs from Sai Kung from the same location at 6:25pm. The fare from Sai Kung Town to Hoi Ha Wan is HK$13.1 as of June 2020.

<doc id="914251" wikidata="Q45019" url="?curid=914251" title="Karl Lehmann">
<text>Karl Lehmann (16 May 1936 – 11 March 2018) was a German prelate and cardinal of the Catholic Church. He served as Bishop of Mainz from 1983 to 2016, being elevated to the cardinalate in 2001.

He served as chairman of the Conference of the German Bishops from 1987 to 2008, being considered one of the most influential prelates in Germany in those years and a leading proponent of liberal stances within the Church. Before he became a bishop, he worked as professor of theology at the University of Mainz and the University of Freiburg.

==Early years, education and career as theological scholar==
Lehmann was born in Sigmaringen and grew up in Veringenstadt. His father was a local teacher and his mother educated as a bookseller. During his high school years, he lived in the Catholic student home in Sigmaringen.

He studied at the Seminary of Freiburg 1957–1964 and then at the Pontifical Gregorian University in Rome where he earned a doctorate in philosophy, in 1962, with a thesis titled &quot;Vom Ursprung und Sinn der Seinsfrage im Denken Martin Heideggers&quot;. He also received a doctorate in theology in 1967, with a thesis titled &quot;&quot;Auferweckt am dritten Tag nach der Schrift&quot;—Exegetische und fundamentaltheologische Studien zu 1 Kor 15, 3b-5&quot;.

He was ordained to the priesthood on 10 October 1963 in Rome by Cardinal Julius Döpfner. During the Second Vatican Council from 1962 to 1965, he served as an assistant to Karl Rahner, and he was also assistant to Rahner at the Seminar for Christian worldview and philosophy of religion at the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich from 1964 to 1967.

In 1968 he became professor of dogmatic theology at the University of Mainz, a position he held until 1971 when he became professor of dogmatic and ecumenical theology at the University of Freiburg.

He was for ten years, from 1974 to 1984, a member of the International Theological Commission.

==Bishop and cardinal==
When he was appointed Bishop of Mainz in 1983 at the age of 47 he was the youngest Catholic bishop ever appointed in Germany.

After being elected deputy chairman of the Episcopal Conference of Germany in 1985, he was elected chairman of the conference in 1987 and held that position for 21 years until 2008, making him one of the most influential people in German Catholicism in this period.

He served as member of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith from 1986 to 1998 and served as vice-president of the Council of the Bishops&#x27; Conferences of Europe from 1993 to 2001.

In 1993, Lehmann along with Bishop of Rottenburg-Stuttgart Walter Kasper and Archbishop of Freiburg Oskar Saier issued a pastoral letter that argued that there should be an opening for pastoral flexibility on allowing divorced and civilly remarried persons to receive the Eucharist. The letter was read in the churches of their dioceses in September of that year.

Abortion was a major issue during Lehmann&#x27;s term as chairman of the Conference of the German Bishops. After the German reunification abortion laws needed to be reconciled. Working closely with CDU and Helmut Kohl, Lehmann favoured a compromise where abortion remained illegal, but under certain circumstances not punishable. This became the fundament for the German legislation in the area. To obtain impunity, a woman was in most cases required to go through counseling before abortion and the Church would for a time offer such counseling. In 1998 Pope John Paul II, against the wish of Lehmann and a majority of German bishops, banned the Church from participating in the system.

Lehmann mentioned the 1998 Katholikentag in Mainz as one of the highlights his years as bishop of the diocese.
Lehmann was raised to the rank of cardinal by Pope John Paul II at the consistory of 21 February 2001. The appointment came unexpected to many observers due to Lehmann&#x27;s relatively liberal view on abortion counselling and giving eucharist to remarried parishioners. Former Chancellor of Germany Helmut Kohl, who was a friend of Lehmann, had lobbied the Vatican for the appointment. He was one of the electors who participated in the papal conclaves of 2005 and 2013 that selected Pope Benedict XVI and Pope Francis. The Titular Church of Lehmann in Rome was San Leone I.

Lehmann was among the cardinals and bishops who met annually from 1995 to 2006 in St. Gallen, Switzerland, to discuss reforms with respect to the appointment of bishops, collegiality, bishops&#x27; conferences, the primacy of the papacy and sexual morality. About a dozen in number, they differed among themselves, but shared the view that Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger was not the candidate they hoped to see elected at the next conclave.

Pope Francis accepted his resignation as Bishop of Mainz on 16 May 2016, his 80th birthday.

Being considered a leading force for a more liberal Catholicism, he was called a bridge-builder, a man of dialogue and a &quot;stroke of luck for German Catholics&quot; by supporters, while Conservative critics derided the &quot;Lehmann Church&quot; as too accommodating to modern values.

===Coat of arms===

Cardinal Lehmann&#x27;s episcopal coat of arms incorporated elements such as the wheel from the arms of the Diocese of Mainz, the key from the Diocese of Worms, and an open book with the letters Alpha and Omega, a symbol of the message of Jesus Christ, as well as for the Cardinal&#x27;s personal enthusiasm for literature.

His Latin motto, &quot;State in fide&quot; (English: &quot;Stand firmly in the faith&quot;) was derived from .

==Later years==
His last public appearance was in August 2017 at the consecration of Peter Kohlgraf as new bishop of Mainz.

In September 2017, Lehmann suffered a stroke and cerebral hemorrhage which left him in need of care, first at hospital and later at home. He died on 11 March 2018.

Chancellor of Germany Angela Merkel expressed sorrow at his death and referred to him as one of the most prominent figures of the Catholic Church in Germany. The chairman of the German Bishops&#x27; Conference Reinhard Marx paid respect to Lehmann as a man who had influenced the Catholic Church globally.

<text>The North Christian Church is a church in Columbus, Indiana. Founded in 1955, it is part of the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ). The church building of 1964 was designed by Finnish-American architect Eero Saarinen (1910–1961) and completed in 1964. Saarinen&#x27;s father Eliel Saarinen had designed the First Christian Church in Columbus.

The building is hexagonal in shape, with a central metal spire that is high. Below the spire, there is an oculus that admits light into the main level. The sanctuary is located at the center of the building, with the Lord&#x27;s Table located in the center of the sanctuary. Rows of pews surround the altar in a hexagon, reflecting the idea that worship should be a central aspect of the life of the congregation. The lower level contains classrooms, an auditorium, a kitchen, and an activities area.

==History==
In 1955, 43 members of the First Christian Church, designed by Eliel Saarinen, decided to found a new church affiliated with the Disciples of Christ. After some time of worshiping in each other&#x27;s homes, in 1956 they purchased of land with the help of Irwin Miller. Although Miller wanted to hire Eero Saarinen to design the new church, he believed it was important that the congregation choose the architect themselves:

==Symbolism in design==

Saarinen believed that modern churches had lost the monumentality of traditional cathedrals because expansions with Sunday schools, gymnasiums, and kitchens took away from the significance of the church itself. He wanted to design a building that returned to the model of a traditional church, while still using Modern architecture that served the needs of the congregation.

His compromise was to move the school, meeting rooms, auditorium, and kitchen to a hidden basement, so that the only visible part of the church above ground was the sanctuary. Space for the basement was carved out of the earth in a hexagonal shape, reflecting the sanctuary above it. This emphasized the importance of the church itself and isolated the sanctuary as the most important part of the building.

He was inspired by the steep steps at Angkor Wat and Borobudur, where the visitor has to interact with the architecture and work to reach the sanctuary. He thought that building an entire church on one level made religion &quot;too easy&quot;, and took away from the spiritual experience of going to church. Therefore, he chose to elevate the sanctuary of the church so people had to climb up a set of stairs to reach it. This way the church also stood out from its residential neighborhood.

===Sanctuary===
The act of entering a church was important to Saarinen as well, so the environment changes to reflect the change of attitude one has when entering a sacred space. The grey slate floors, dark mahogany pews, and eerie natural lighting instill a sense of awe in the visitor. The primary light source into the sanctuary is the oculus at the base of the spire, directly above the Communion table. This focus of light draws attention to the center of the room, where the Communion takes place.

The room was designed as a space where people can gather in unity and harmony in an enclosed spiritual world. The Communion table, consisting of twelve pedestals symbolic of the twelve disciples, is placed on a tiered platform. The highest pedestal at the end of the table represents Christ, and hold a silver chalice and loaf of bread for the service. It is the central focus of the sanctuary because it is an important part of the Disciples of Christ service. The congregation sits around it facing each other as a community.

The pulpit, choir loft, and a Holtkamp organ is situated opposite the main entrance into the sanctuary. The organ is the last of its kind designed by Walter Holtkamp Sr.

===Spire===
Saarinen designed the long, angular, symmetrical sanctuary and the tall spire in a single stroke:
From the outside of the building, the spire symbolized reaching upwards to God; on the inside, it created an enclosed soaring space for the congregation. The church was intended to remove man from the earthly world, so instead of being anchored to the ground with solid rectangles, Saarinen used pointed angular forms that hover and point to the heavens. At the top of the spire is a gold leaf cross, symbolizing Christ&#x27;s sacrifice.

===Baptistery===
The baptistery is a small space, decorated with a sunburst design, symbolizing the Holy Trinity. It is separate from the main sanctuary, designed to give the ceremony more dignity. The separation between the baptistery and sanctuary also recalls the tradition of the Early Christian church, when only those who were baptized could attend Communion.

==Influence==
The North Christian Church was one of the most copied buildings from the mid-twentieth century. Although it did not generate much interest during Saarinen&#x27;s life, the decades that followed produced copies of the building all across the America. It was the last building Saarinen designed before his death, and he thought it was one of his greatest achievements:
==Recent history==
As the membership has decreased and upkeep costs increased, the congregation began to have difficulty raising the necessary funds for maintenance of the structure. In April 2018, the Indiana Landmarks historic preservation organization added the church to its list of &quot;10 Most Endangered&quot; Indiana landmarks to raise awareness of the problem and find ways to save it.

In 2019, Landmark Columbus received a 2019 Keeping it Modern Architectural Conservation Grant from the Getty Foundation for the iconic church. With this grant, Landmark Columbus—together with Prudon &amp; Partners, Reed-Hilderbrand, Bryony Roberts Studio, Enrique Ramirez, ICR-ICC and others—developed a conservation management plan to provide the historical context and strategic guidance necessary for the church&#x27;s long-term upkeep.

On July 16, 2022, the congregation held a &quot;Celebration of Life&quot; service for the building. The church is now permanently closed and no longer allowing tours of the building.

On April 15, 2024, the Bartholomew County Library Board voted to accept the church as a gift from the former North Christian Church congregation.

Pell served as the eighth Archbishop of Sydney (2001–2014), the seventh Archbishop of Melbourne (1996–2001) and an auxiliary bishop of Melbourne (1987–1996). He was also an author and columnist. From 1996, Pell maintained a high public profile on a wide range of issues, while retaining an adherence to Catholic orthodoxy.

Pell worked as a priest in rural Victoria and in Melbourne and also chaired the aid organisation Caritas Australia (part of Caritas Internationalis) from 1988 to 1997. He was appointed a delegate to the Australian Constitutional Convention in 1998, received the Centenary Medal from the Australian government in 2003 and was appointed a Companion of the Order of Australia (AC) in the 2005 Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours. During his tenure as Archbishop of Melbourne, Pell set up the &quot;Melbourne Response&quot; protocol in 1996 to investigate and deal with complaints of child sexual abuse in the archdiocese. The protocol was the first of its kind in the world and was subjected to a variety of criticism.
In 2018, Pell was convicted of child sexual abuse, but on appeal, the convictions were quashed, and Pell acquitted, in 2020 by the High Court of Australia in the decision &quot;Pell v The Queen&quot;. A separate investigation by the Holy See&#x27;s Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith into these allegations of abuse concluded upon his acquittal by the High Court. However, in January 2025 it was announced that the Australian National Redress Scheme had accepted that Pell abused two boys in Ballarat in the 1970s, with compensation paid to one of the boys in question five weeks prior to Pell&#x27;s death.

According to findings released by Australia&#x27;s Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse in 2020, Pell knew of child sexual abuse by clergy by the 1970s but did not take adequate action to address it. Pell said he was &quot;surprised&quot; and that the royal commission&#x27;s findings &quot;are not supported by evidence&quot;.


==Early life and education==
Pell was born on 8 June 1941 in Ballarat, Victoria, to George Arthur and Margaret Lillian Pell (née Burke). His father was a non-practising Anglican whose ancestors were from Leicestershire in England; he was also a heavyweight boxing champion. His mother was a devout Catholic of Irish descent. As a child, Pell underwent 24 operations to remove an abscess in his throat.

Pell attended Loreto Convent and St Patrick&#x27;s College in Ballarat. At St Patrick&#x27;s, he played Australian rules football as a ruckman on the first XVIII from 1956 to 1959. He reportedly signed with the Richmond Football Club in 1959. Pell&#x27;s ambitions later turned to the priesthood. Speaking of his decision to enter seminary, Pell once said, &quot;To put it crudely, I feared and suspected and eventually became convinced that God wanted me to do His work, and I was never able to successfully escape that conviction.&quot;

In 1960, Pell began his studies for the priesthood at Corpus Christi College, then located in Werribee. He continued to play football and served as class prefect in his second and third years. In 1963, he was assigned to continue studies at the Pontifical Urban University in Rome. He was ordained to the diaconate on 15 August 1966.

==Ecclesiastical career==
===Priesthood===
On 16 December 1966, Pell was ordained a priest by Cardinal Gregorio Pietro Agagianian at St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica. He received a Licentiate of Sacred Theology degree from the Pontificia Università Urbaniana in 1967, and continued his studies at the University of Oxford where he earned a Doctor of Philosophy degree in church history in 1971 with a thesis entitled &quot;The exercise of authority in early Christianity from about 170 to about 270&quot;. During his studies at Oxford he also served as a chaplain to Catholic students at Eton College.

In 1971, Pell returned to Australia and was assigned to serve as an assistant priest in Swan Hill, where he remained for two years. He then served at a parish in Ballarat East from 1973 to 1983, becoming administrator of the parish of Bungaree in 1984. In 1982, he earned a Master of Education degree from Monash University in Melbourne. During his tenure in Ballarat East and Bungaree, he also served as Episcopal Vicar for Education (1973–84), director of the Aquinas campus of the Institute of Catholic Education (1974–84) and principal of the Institute of Catholic Education (1981–84). He was also editor of &quot;Light&quot;, the newspaper of the Diocese of Ballarat, from 1979 to 1984.

From 1985 to 1987, Pell served as seminary rector of his &quot;alma mater&quot;, Corpus Christi College.

===Diocesan episcopal career===

Pell was appointed an auxiliary bishop of Melbourne and titular Bishop of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Scala (Italy) on 30 March 1987. He received his episcopal consecration on 21 May 1987 from Archbishop Frank Little, with bishops Ronald Mulkearns and Joseph O&#x27;Connell serving as co-consecrators. He served as Bishop for the Southern Region of Melbourne (1987–96). During this time, he was a parish priest in Mentone.

Pell was named seventh Archbishop of Melbourne on 16 July 1996, receiving the pallium from Pope John Paul II on 29 June 1997. He was later appointed eighth Archbishop of Sydney on 26 March 2001 and again received the pallium from John Paul on 29 June 2001.

Pell was a consultor of the Pontifical Council for Justice and Peace from 1990 to 1995 and a member from 2002. From 1990 to 2000 he was a member of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith. In April 2002, John Paul II named him President of the Vox Clara commission to advise the Congregation for Divine Worship on English translations of liturgical texts. On 21 December 2002 he was appointed a member of the Pontifical Council for the Family, having previously served as a consultor to the council. On 22 September 2012, Pell was appointed a member of the Congregation for Bishops.

As Archbishop of Melbourne, Pell maintained a high public profile on a wide range of issues, while retaining a strict adherence to Catholic orthodoxy; with some dispute over the issue of Catholics and &quot;primacy of conscience&quot;.

In 2001, he argued: &quot;We must not allow the situation to deteriorate as it had in Elijah&#x27;s time, 850 years before Christ, where monotheism was nearly swamped by the aggressive paganism of the followers of Baal.&quot; In 2010, on reviewing the movie &quot;Avatar&quot;, he wrote: &quot;Worship of the powerful forces of nature is half right, a primitive stage in the movement towards acknowledging the one: the single Transcendent God, above and beyond nature. It is a symptom of our age that Hollywood is pumping out this old-fashioned pagan propaganda.&quot;

Pope John Paul II announced on 28 September 2003 that he would appoint Pell and 28 others to the College of Cardinals. In the consistory of 21 October he was made cardinal priest of Santa Maria Domenica Mazzarello. With Pell as cardinal, Australia had, for the first time, three cardinals eligible to participate in a papal election: Pell, Edward Bede Clancy and Edward Idris Cassidy.

Pell was one of the cardinal electors in 2005 who participated in the 2005 papal conclave that elected Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, who became Pope Benedict XVI. He is reported to have served as an unauthorised &quot;campaign manager&quot; for Ratzinger. Pell was mentioned as a possible successor to Benedict XVI as head of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith.

Pell instituted new guidelines in February 2007 for family members speaking at funerals. He said that, &quot;on not a few occasions, inappropriate remarks glossing over the deceased&#x27;s proclivities (drinking prowess, romantic conquests etc) or about the church (attacking its moral teachings) have been made at funeral Masses.&quot; Under Pell&#x27;s guidelines, the eulogy must never replace the celebrant&#x27;s homily, which should focus on the scripture readings selected, God&#x27;s compassion, and the resurrection of Jesus.
Pell lobbied for the successful Sydney bid to host the 2008 World Youth Day, which brought Benedict XVI on his first papal visit to Australia. The event drew approximately half a million young people from 200 countries, and one million people came to see the Pope. On 19 July 2008, Benedict issued his first public apology to victims of child sexual abuse by Catholic priests.

In their 2010 Good Friday sermons, both Pell and his Anglican counterpart Archbishop Peter Jensen attacked atheism. Both men were also closely aligned on policy issues and Jensen launched Pell&#x27;s biography.

On 18 September 2012, Pell was named by Benedict XVI to be one of the papally appointed Synod Fathers for the October 2012 Ordinary General Assembly of the Synod of Bishops on the New Evangelization.

Pell was the only cardinal from Oceania to take part in the 2013 papal conclave. At that conclave, he was thought to be organising votes on behalf of Cardinal Angelo Scola of Milan, the favourite candidate of the Italian cardinals.

Following his election, Pope Francis named Pell, the only non-retired cardinal available to represent Oceania, one of eight members to advise the Pope on reform of the Vatican bureaucracy, called the Roman Curia; they were appointed to five-year terms.

===Secretariat for the Economy===
In February 2014, Pell was appointed to be the first prefect of the newly created Secretariat for the Economy. In this role, Pell was responsible for the annual budget of the Holy See and the Vatican. In July 2014 Pell, with the consent of Pope Francis, had the Ordinary Section of Administration of the Patrimony of the Apostolic See (APSA) transferred to the Secretariat for the Economy to enable the Secretariat to exercise economic control and vigilance over the agencies of the Holy See. It was also announced that remaining staff of APSA would begin to focus exclusively on its role as a treasury for the Holy See and the Vatican City State.

Following the confirmation of the mission of the Institute for the Works of Religion (IOR – also known as the Vatican Bank) by the Pope on 7 April 2014, the IOR announced plans for the next stage of development. The Council of Cardinal Advisers, the Secretariat for the Economy, the Supervisory Commission of Cardinals, and the IOR Board of Superintendence agreed that this plan would be carried out by a new executive team led by Jean-Baptiste de Franssu.

Pell was appointed a member of the Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples on 13 September 2014. In November 2014, the Secretariat for the Economy distributed a new handbook to all Vatican offices outlining financial management policies that would go into effect on 1 January 2015. The manual was endorsed by the Council for the Economy and approved by the Pope. &quot;The purpose of the manual is very simple,&quot; said Pell, &quot;it brings Financial Management practices in line with international standards and will help all Entities and Administrations of the Holy See and the Vatican City State prepare financial reports in a consistent and transparent manner.&quot; In 2015, Cardinal Francesco Coccopalmerio questioned the scope of the authority given to the Secretariat and to Pell himself, specifically the consolidation of management and not the demand for transparency.

On 12 December 2018, the Vatican announced that Pell was one of three &quot;more elderly&quot; cardinals who were to leave the Pope&#x27;s Council of Cardinal Advisers after a five-year term. The three were also thanked by the Pope for their service. On 24 February 2019, his five-year term as Prefect of the Secretariat for the Economy expired.

===Vatican investigation of sexual abuse charges===
Immediately following Pell&#x27;s initial conviction for sexual abuse in February 2019, the Holy See&#x27;s Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith (CDF) initiated its own investigation of the charges against him, but the Vatican also said the CDF would await a &quot;definitive judgment&quot; from the Australian courts in the case. The Pope reaffirmed at that time that Pell was &quot;forbidden to exercise public ministry and ... from having contact in any way or form with minors&quot;, restrictions that had been in place since Pell&#x27;s return to Australia in July 2017. When Pell&#x27;s conviction was upheld in August 2019, the Vatican again said its review would wait for Pell to exhaust his appeals. When Pell&#x27;s convictions were quashed in April 2020, a Vatican spokesperson said that ruling would contribute to the CDF&#x27;s investigation which would &quot;draw its conclusions on the basis of the norms of canon law&quot;. The CDF&#x27;s investigations concluded upon Pell&#x27;s acquittal by the High Court.

===Illness and death===
In January 2010, Pell experienced cardiac problems during his Vatican visit, and in February had a pacemaker fitted in a Rome hospital. In 2015, Pell&#x27;s doctors judged his heart condition serious enough to prevent air travel from Italy to Australia to appear before the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse. He was expected to be well enough to travel in February 2016. However, he was excused from giving evidence in person by commission chair Justice Peter McClellan, based on a two-page medical report submitted by Pell&#x27;s lawyers. He testified from a hotel in Rome through a video link up. In December 2018, he underwent knee surgery. He recovered sufficiently to stop using a cane by June 2019. In February 2019, when he was taken into custody following his conviction, an assessment of his mental and physical health concluded he was healthy enough to be kept in HM Melbourne Assessment Prison.

On 10 January 2023, at the age of 81, Pell died of cardiac arrest following hip surgery at the Salvator Mundi hospital in Rome, having attended the funeral of Pope Benedict XVI a few days earlier. For the last two years and three months of his life, Pell lived in Rome, taking up residency in an apartment one block away from the Vatican. His body lay in state at the Church of St Stephen of the Abyssinians before a Requiem Mass at St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica on 14 January, which was celebrated by Giovanni Battista Re, Dean of the College of Cardinals, and concelebrated by other cardinals and bishops, with the final blessing and commendation given by Pope Francis. Pell&#x27;s Funeral Mass was celebrated at St Mary&#x27;s Cathedral in Sydney on 1 February during a closed service which was held amid protest concerns. He was buried in the cathedral&#x27;s crypt. Leading public figures who attended the funeral service included former prime ministers Tony Abbott and John Howard, and federal opposition leader Peter Dutton. However, other leading public figures did not attend: Governor-General David Hurley, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, NSW Governor Margaret Beazley, NSW Premier Dominic Perrottet, NSW opposition leader Chris Minns and Lord Mayor of Sydney Clover Moore. LGBT groups, survivors of child sexual abuse and their supporters protested in Hyde Park, opposite the cathedral.

==Views==
In the Australian context, Pell was regarded as progressive on some issues such as asylum seekers but strongly conservative on matters of faith and morals. He was often wary of what he called the &quot;callousness&quot; of unrestrained capitalism. He wrote that a Catholic is someone who is not only a person of personal conscience but &quot;is someone who believes Christ is Son of God, accepts His teachings and lives a life of worship, service and duty in the community. Catholics are not created by the accident of birth to remain only because their tribe has an interesting history.&quot;

===Theology and worship===

====&quot;Ad orientem&quot; liturgy====
In 2009 Pell supported, in the abstract but not as a proposal for immediate application, mandatory celebration of the Canon of the Mass with the orientation of the priest &quot;ad orientem&quot; (towards the east), facing in the same direction as the congregation. &quot;There&#x27;s nothing like a consensus in favour of that at the moment&quot;, he said. &quot;I think I would be in favour of it because it makes it patently clear that the priest is not the centre of the show, that this is an act of worship of the one true God, and the people are joining with the priest for that.&quot;

====Adam and Eve====
During a debate against Richard Dawkins on the television show &quot;Q&amp;A&quot; in 2012, in response to whether there had ever been a Garden of Eden scenario with an &quot;actual&quot; Adam and Eve, Pell said:

====Ordination of women and priestly celibacy====
In 2005 Pell supported the view that the ordination of women as priests is impossible according to the church&#x27;s divine constitution and said that abandoning the tradition of clerical celibacy would be a &quot;serious blunder&quot;.

===Pope Benedict XVI===
Pell said that the decision of Pope Benedict XVI to retire in 2013 could set a precedent which may be a problem for future leaders. He thought Benedict&#x27;s decision to step down had destabilised the church and some of those surrounding the Pope had failed to support him in his ministry. &quot;He was well aware that this is a break with tradition [and] slightly destabilising&quot;, Pell said. According to him, the Pope was a better theologian than he was a leader.

In response to the statement that he had criticised Benedict XVI, Pell said he was stating what the Pope already mentioned himself, and his comments were &quot;not breaking any ground&quot;. During a youth conference in Parramatta, Bishop Anthony Fisher said that Pell was merely &quot;stating the pros and cons of the Pope&#x27;s decision&quot; and those who said his comments were critical were taking him out of context.

===Pope Francis===
In the days following his death, it was revealed that Pell had been the author of a memo published in 2022 on the blog &quot;Settimo Cielo&quot; under the pseudonym of &quot;Demos&quot;, in which Pell expressed harsh criticisms of Pope Francis and labelled his pontificate as &quot;a disaster in many or most respects; a catastrophe&quot;. Pell accused Francis of failing to stand up to the Chinese Communist Party, of failing to lend sufficient support to Ukraine and the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church and for not doing enough to stop the Catholic Church in Germany from questioning traditional doctrines on LGBT issues and women&#x27;s ordination. The person who had revealed Demos&#x27; identity, Sandro Magister, who was also the memo&#x27;s publisher, said that Pell had allowed him to reveal he was Demos after his death.

In an article he wrote for &quot;The Spectator&quot;, published shortly after his death, Pell described Pope Francis&#x27; Synod on the Synod as a &quot;toxic nightmare&quot;.

===Political issues===

====Asylum seekers and refugees====
Pell criticised the bipartisan policy of mandatory detention of asylum seekers in Australia and called for &quot;empathy and compassion&quot; towards displaced peoples. Pell said that while a policy of deterrence was justifiable, the practice of the policy was coming at too great a &quot;moral cost&quot;. Describing conditions in some of Australia&#x27;s mandatory detention camps in 2001 as &quot;pretty tight and miserable&quot; and &quot;no place for women and children&quot;, Pell called for investigation of any maltreatment of detainees and said that, while Australia has the right to regulate the number of refugees it accepts, as a rich and prosperous country, it can &quot;afford to be generous&quot; and must treat humanely those refugees who reach Australia.

===Environmental positions===
In a 2006 speech, Pell said that &quot;hysterical and extreme claims&quot; about the natural environment were the result of the &quot;pagan emptiness&quot; of Western culture. He said: &quot;In the past pagans sacrificed animals and even humans in vain attempts to placate capricious and cruel gods. Today they demand a reduction in carbon dioxide emissions.&quot; In a 2007 article for the Sydney &quot;Sunday Telegraph&quot;, Pell wrote that while climate had changed, he was &quot;certainly sceptical about extravagant claims of impending man-made climatic catastrophes, because the evidence is insufficient&quot;.

Responding to the Anglican bishop and environmentalist George Browning, who told the Anglican Church of Australia&#x27;s general synod that Pell was out of touch with the Catholic Church as well as with the general community, Pell stated:

In July 2015, Pell criticised Pope Francis&#x27;s encyclical &quot;Laudato si&#x27;&quot; for associating the church with the need to address climate. Pell said: 
Pell publicly expressed concern regarding population decline in July 2008 in a homily for the opening Mass of the World Youth Day in Sydney, in response to comments made by Pope Benedict XVI regarding climate change. While travelling to Sydney for the event, Benedict stated in a brief interview that Catholics and others must commit &quot;to finding an ethical way to change our way of life and ways to respond to these great challenges&quot; regarding climate change. Pell stated in his homily that mankind has a duty not &quot;to damage and destroy or ruthlessly use the environment at the expense of future generations&quot;, but expressed scepticism regarding human activity causing climate change. Pell stated that the &quot;slowing population growth and apathy towards God are the biggest challenges facing the church&quot; and that Western nations faced a population crisis fuelled by &quot;ruthless commercial forces&quot;, such that &quot;No western country is producing enough babies to keep the population stable, no western country.&quot; Pell&#x27;s views were contested in the Australian context by the environmental group Sustainable Population Australia, whose media release of 14 July 2008 cited Australian Bureau of Statistics figures that Australia had &quot;a population growth rate of 1.6%, higher than the global average, with twice as many births as deaths...&quot;. Pell&#x27;s views were contested in a global context by the economist Jeffrey Sachs, who argued that &quot;The planet, everyone can feel, is just right at the limits right now in terms of food, in terms of energy supply, in terms of land use.&quot; Sachs also suggested that world population projections &quot;are already too high at around an extra 2.5 billion people by 2050&quot;.

===Interfaith issues===

====Islam====
Pell wrote of a need to &quot;deepen friendship and understanding&quot; with Muslims in the post–September 11 environment and said that though there is a continuing struggle throughout the Muslim world between moderates and men of violence, he believed that, in Australia, &quot;the moderates are in control&quot;. In 2004, speaking to the Acton Institute on the problems of &quot;secular democracy&quot;, Pell drew a parallel between Islam and communism: &quot;Islam may provide in the 21st century, the attraction that communism provided in the 20th, both for those that are alienated and embittered on the one hand and for those who seek order or justice on the other.&quot;

In February 2006, addressing Catholic business leaders in Naples, Florida, Pell stated: &quot;Considered strictly on its own terms, Islam is not a tolerant religion and its capacity for far-reaching renovation is severely limited.&quot; He doubted that Islam possesses the capacity for theological development because &quot;In the Muslim understanding, the Koran comes directly from God, unmediated. The Bible, in contrast, is a product of human co-operation with divine inspiration.&quot; In 2012 and 2013, Pell hosted Iftar dinners to mark the end of the Islamic celebration of Ramadan. The Grand Mufti of Australia, Ibrahim Abu Mohamed, expressed his gratitude and appreciation to Pell on behalf of Muslims for hosting the dinner. Pell said during the 2012 dinner that such gatherings are one of the fruits of tolerance that flourishes in Australian society and is a sign of respect for diversity, stating:

====Judaism====
Pell participated in interfaith dialogues and celebrations involving Jews. In 2001, he told one such audience at Mandelbaum House in Sydney that he had come from a strongly pro-Jewish family and of being saddened during his studies of history to find Christian ill-treatment of Jews. Pell spoke of the need to remember the Holocaust and of his visits to concentration camps and of his support for the right of the state of Israel to exist. He praised the role of Vatican II and of Pope John Paul II in advancing the cause of Christian-Jewish dialogue and co-operation. Pell also spoke in praise of the Jewish psalms as &quot;a body of prayerful literature&quot; unequalled in any other tradition and singled out the Jewish prophets, Isaiah, Jeremiah and Ezekiel as authors for whom he has a deep love, and Elijah as one whom he views as highly significant. Pell called on Christian and Jewish leaders alike to speak together and respectfully listen to each other, saying of the Christian-Jewish relationship:

Pell&#x27;s remarks to Richard Dawkins led to a clarification from his office, reported by &quot;The Times of Israel&quot; as an apology. Pell said, &quot;My commitment to friendship with the Jewish community, and my esteem for the Jewish faith is a matter of public record, and the last thing I would want to do is give offence to either&quot; and that the Holocaust was &quot;a crime unique in history for the death and suffering it caused and its diabolical attempt to wipe out an entire people.&quot;

===Sexuality, marriage and bioethics===
Pell received much attention for his attitudes to sexuality issues, particularly homosexuality. When installed as Archbishop of Sydney in May 2001, he said that &quot;Christian teaching on sexuality is only one part of the Ten Commandments, of the virtues and vices, but it is essential for human wellbeing and especially for the proper flourishing of marriages and families, for the continuity of the human race.&quot;

====Divorce and remarriage====
Pell said that, outside exceptional circumstances such as relationships involving physical abuse, it is better for individuals and for society if couples do not divorce, particularly where children are involved. In 2001, ABC radio&#x27;s &quot;The World Today&quot; reported that Pell wanted a return to a divorce system based on the fault of one spouse. Pell told the program that, in an effort to &quot;focus attention on the damage, personal and financial, that unfortunately often follows from divorce&quot;, he had prepared a list for public consideration of possible penalties to discourage divorce (particularly where fault by one party was involved) as well as benefits to support couples who stayed together.

====LGBT issues====
In 1990, Pell stated publicly that while he recognised that homosexuality existed, such activity was nevertheless wrong and &quot;for the good of society it should not be encouraged.&quot; He had also expressed his belief that suicide rates among LGBT youth were a reason to discourage homosexuality, arguing that &quot;Homosexual activity is a much greater health hazard than smoking.&quot; In 1998, Pell refused communion to members of the Rainbow Sash Movement who had attended Mass at the cathedral in Melbourne. He publicly rebuked their actions to the applause of other parishioners. Pell opposed Australian legislation in 2006 that would have permitted LGBT couples to adopt children. In 2007, he said that discrimination against LGBT people was not comparable to that against racial minorities.

====HIV/AIDS====

In 2009, Pell supported the comments made by Pope Benedict XVI in Africa in relation to controlling the spread of AIDS, in which the Pope reiterated the Catholic teaching that the solution to the AIDS epidemic lay not in the distribution of condoms, but in the practice of sexual abstinence and monogamy within marriage. The Pope said that AIDS could not be overcome through the distribution of condoms, which &quot;can even increase the problem&quot;. In response to global coverage of these remarks, Pell said that AIDS was a &quot;great spiritual and health crisis&quot; and a huge challenge, but that &quot;Condoms are encouraging promiscuity. They are encouraging irresponsibility.&quot;
The president of the AIDS Council of New South Wales, Marc Orr, said Pell&#x27;s comments were &quot;irresponsible&quot; and &quot;contradicted all evidence&quot; that condoms reduced the transmission of HIV: Mike Toole (Burnet Institute) and Rob Moodie (Nossal Institute for Global Health) wrote in &quot;The Age&quot; that Pell had said a health worker from an African country told him that &quot;people in remote areas are too poor to afford condoms and the ones that are available are often of very poor quality and weren&#x27;t used effectively&quot;. Both professors argue that &quot;this is not an argument against promoting condoms – it is an argument that we need to ensure that good quality condoms are affordable for everyone and are widely distributed with information about how to use them effectively&quot; and concluded &quot;the sexual abstinence message is clearly not working.&quot;

In 2010, Benedict told an interviewer that while the church did not consider condoms as a &quot;real or moral solution&quot;, there were times where the &quot;intention of reducing the risk of infection&quot; made condom use &quot;a first step&quot; towards a better way. Pell released a statement saying this did not signal a major new shift in Vatican thinking.

====Stem cell research====
Pell supported research on the therapeutic potential of adult stem cells but opposed embryonic stem cell research on the basis that the Catholic Church cannot support anything which involves &quot;the destruction of human life at any stage after conception&quot;. Under Pell, the Sydney archdiocese has provided funding for adult stem cell research but has actively opposed moves by the Parliament of New South Wales to liberalise laws pertaining to use of embryonic stem cells.

Following a conscience vote in the Parliament of New South Wales overturning a ban on therapeutic cloning, in June 2007 Pell said that &quot;Catholic politicians who vote for this legislation must realise that their voting has consequences for their place in the life of the Church.&quot; Some members of parliament, including ministers such as Kristina Keneally and Nathan Rees, condemned Pell&#x27;s comments, calling them hypocritical; Rees drew comparisons with comments made earlier in the year by Sheik Hilali. Australian Greens MLC Lee Rhiannon referred Pell&#x27;s remarks to the New South Wales parliamentary privileges committee for allegedly being in contempt of parliament. Pell described this move as a &quot;clumsy attempt to curb religious freedom and freedom of speech&quot;. In September the committee tabled a report clearing him of this charge and recommending that no further action be taken.

The legal scholar and theologian Cathleen Kaveny wrote that &quot;In every possible respect, Pell&#x27;s statement backfired&quot; as, following backlash from elected officials and the general public, the bill passed the lower house with what she describes as &quot;an overwhelming 65–26 vote&quot; and passed the upper house with a 27–13 vote.

==Other roles==
The Roman Catholic Archbishop of Sydney takes the role of visitor of St John&#x27;s College, a residential college within the University of Sydney.

Pell accepted the invitation to be patron of the Oxford University Newman Society and to deliver their inaugural St Thomas More Lecture on 6 March 2009.

==Handling of child sexual abuse cases by clergy while archbishop==

Pell&#x27;s tenure as Archbishop of Melbourne began when the issue of handling of child sex abuse allegations by institutions was coming to the fore in public debate. Launching the &quot;Melbourne Response&quot; protocol in 1996, Pell said: &quot;It&#x27;s a matter of regret that the Catholic Church has taken some time to come to grips with the sex abuse issue adequately.&quot; In his final sermon as Archbishop of Sydney in 2014 before departing Australia for Rome, Pell told the congregation: &quot;I apologise once again to the victims and their families for the terrible suffering that has been brought to bear by these crimes.&quot; He said procedural improvements could still be made to the church&#x27;s efforts against child sexual abuse, and then added that he &quot;looked forward&quot; to the findings of the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse which he said was providing a &quot;public service&quot; in allowing victims to air their experiences. His choice of words drew wide criticism as they were perceived as being inappropriately blithe and unempathetic to the victims of abuse.

===&quot;Melbourne Response&quot; protocol for abuse cases===
Shortly after becoming Archbishop of Melbourne in August 1996, Pell discussed the issue of child abuse with the Victorian premier as well as the governor and the retired judge Richard McGarvie, who all recommended swift action. He engaged the law firm Corrs to draft a scheme which would be funded by but operate independently of the Archdiocese of Melbourne. A public forum was held on 19 October and the resulting &quot;Melbourne Response&quot; was announced on 30 October 1996. Victims were publicly encouraged to come forward. Pell&#x27;s Melbourne-specific policy preceded the national church response, known as &quot;Towards Healing&quot;, which the Australian Catholic Bishops&#x27; Conference approved in November and took effect in March 1997. When Pell was appointed a cardinal in 2003, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation said that he had established Australia&#x27;s first independent commissioner to handle child sexual abuse complaints against clergy.

The Melbourne Response was the subject of Case Study 16 in the 2013–2017 Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse and was also examined in the 2013 Victorian government &quot;Inquiry into the Handling of Child Abuse by Religious and Other Organisations&quot;. Pell was called to testify at both inquiries. In 2017, the royal commission reported that the Melbourne Response was &quot;widely criticised as being legalistic and offering inadequate support to victims&quot;. According to the royal commission, the Melbourne Response set its goals as &quot;truth, humility, healing for the victims, assistance to other persons affected, an adequate response to those accused and to offenders and the prevention of any such offences in the future&quot;. Its key features were the appointment of independent commissioners to inquire into allegations and make recommendations; a counselling and support service (Carelink); and the establishment of a compensation panel to advise on making &quot;ex-gratia&quot; payments to victims of child sexual abuse. The payments are made without the church recognising any liability to victims and were initially capped at $50,000. It was increased to $55,000 in 2000 and to $75,000 in 2008. Peter O&#x27;Callaghan was appointed the first independent commissioner. He went on to investigate 351 complaints of child sexual abuse and upheld 97% of them.

===2013 Victorian parliamentary inquiry===

On 27 May 2013, Pell gave evidence before Victoria&#x27;s Parliamentary &quot;Inquiry into the Handling of Child Abuse by Religious and Other Organisations&quot;. Pell told the inquiry that he was &quot;fully apologetic and absolutely sorry&quot;. The parliamentarians questioned Pell over allegations from the parents of a victim that he had not shown them empathy. Pell said he had in fact fully understood the suffering. He agreed with the inquiry that his predecessor had &quot;covered up&quot; matters for fear of scandal. Pell was heckled from the gallery. Pell critic David Marr wrote that &quot;He [Pell] admitted his church had covered up child sexual abuse for fear of scandal; that his predecessor Archbishop Little had destroyed records, moved paedophile priests from parish to parish and facilitated appalling crimes.&quot; During the course of the inquiry, a victim of a paedophile Christian Brother at St Alipius Primary School said that in 1969 Pell heard him pleading for help a few weeks after he had been raped. Pell denied the statement, which was later discredited when Pell produced his passport to confirm that he was not living in Australia that year.

===Response to historic allegations in Sydney===
During Pell&#x27;s time as Archbishop of Sydney, allegations of child sexual abuse were made against around 55 priests in the archdiocese. These were largely related to incidents that occurred prior to his arrival as archbishop. The allegations resulted in just under $8 million in reparation payments.

===Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse===

In late 2012, the Australian federal government established a Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse. Pell welcomed the inquiry and said &quot;We think this is an opportunity to help the victims, it&#x27;s an opportunity to clear the air and separate fact from fiction.&quot; He said there had been a persistent &quot;press campaign against the Catholic Church&quot;. The commission conducted hearings between 2013 and 2017. Pell gave evidence on three occasions to the royal commission, beginning in March 2014 in Sydney and via video link from the Vatican in August 2014 and in February/March 2016.

In his 2012 Christmas address Pell said he felt &quot;shock and shame&quot; at revelations of crime and wrongdoing that were completely contrary to Christ&#x27;s teaching. Pell called the crimes and wrongdoings &quot;disasters&quot;. He said he was &quot;deeply sorry this has happened&quot; and told his listeners to &quot;help those who have been hurt&quot;.

====Comments upholding the Seal of Confession====
The announcement of the royal commission was accompanied by calls from some quarters for relaxing the requirement of confidentiality in confessions, known as the Seal of Confession, which has been upheld by the Catholic Church since the 5th century. It is protected under Australian law in such statutes as the Evidence Act 1995 (which also provides protections for lawyers, journalists and spouses). When Pell was asked whether he thought that a priest who hears the confession of someone who has committed child sex abuse must remain bound by the Seal of Confession, he replied:

The ABC reported that the comment &quot;met with disapproval&quot;, citing Catholic politician Barry O&#x27;Farrell who told Parliament that confessions should not be secret.

====Accusations of misconduct====

Criticisms of Pell&#x27;s conduct and manner towards victims and perpetrators have been aired in the Australian media and considered at the royal commission. His appearances before the royal commission were met with intense public interest in Australia. He was heckled from the public galleries. Pell has complained of unfair treatment from the media and &quot;relentless character assassination&quot;.

An SBS article by Debi Marshall included suggestions Pell had ignored accounts of physical and child sexual abuse and covered up such abuse. Marshall raised the allegation that Pell had attempted to &quot;bribe&quot; a victim. However, Pell was cross-examined by Counsel Assisting Gail Furness over the widely publicised statement that in 1993, he attempted to bribe David Ridsdale into silence when Ridsdale called him about the historical misconduct of his child-molesting priest uncle Gerald Ridsdale. In her final submission, Furness conceded that the allegation was unlikely to be an accurate interpretation of Pell&#x27;s intent, as it was already known that Gerald Ridsdale was under investigation by police, and David Ridsdale was requesting a private process and not suggesting he wanted to go to police.

The royal commission also considered evidence of Pell&#x27;s &quot;knowledge of rumours, allegations or complaints of Edward Dowlan&#x27;s sexual abuse of children in Ballarat&quot;, also raised in Marshall&#x27;s article. One witness said he had gone to &quot;Pell&#x27;s presbytery&quot; in Ballarat to warn him about Dowlan. Pell submitted evidence that he did not live in Ballarat or in that presbytery at the time, and the counsel-assisting said in her final submission that &quot;Cardinal Pell&#x27;s evidence about his living arrangements and duties in 1973 and 1974 make it less likely that he was at St Patrick&#x27;s presbytery late in the afternoon on a week day.&quot;

====March 2014 appearance====

In 2014, the royal commission was told how lawyers representing Pell and the Archdiocese of Sydney incurred costs of A$1.5 million against a victim of child sexual abuse. The lawyers, acting on the church&#x27;s instructions, &quot;vigorously&quot; fought John Ellis through the courts despite warnings of his &quot;fragile psychological state&quot;. The resulting New South Wales Court of Appeal ruling established the controversial &quot;Ellis Defence&quot;, which confirmed that the church could not be sued as a legal entity and held liable for child sexual abuse committed by a priest in such matters. Eventually, Ellis received $568,000 from the church. In a statement to the royal commission in March 2014, Pell reversed his earlier stance in support of the defence, saying: &quot;My own view is that the Church in Australia should be able to be sued in cases of this kind.&quot;

In his 2014 appearance, Pell used an analogy of a trucking company: &quot;If the truck driver picks up some lady and then molests her, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s appropriate, because it is contrary to the policy, for the ownership, the leadership of that company to be held responsible.&quot; He was widely criticised for this remark. The president of Adults Surviving Child Abuse, Cathy Kezelman, called his comments &quot;outrageous&quot;, saying that they denied the experience of victims. Nicky Davis, from the Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests (SNAP), said that Pell had made a &quot;highly offensive&quot; comparison. Michael Bradley, writing in his weekly column for ABC News, said &quot;Yes, it was mind-blowingly insensitive to draw that analogy and to so blithely refer to &#x27;some lady&#x27;. But there was a much bigger hole. In the world according to Pell, if the Catholic Church has a policy that tells its priests not to rape children then, if they still do so, the Church cannot be held accountable.&quot;

====2016 appearance====
Pell appeared before the Royal Commission in February and March 2016 by video link from a hotel in Rome because his heart condition made travel to Australia inadvisable, according to Commission chair Justice Peter McClellan, who ruled on the issue, a ruling opposed by Nicky Davis, an advocate for sexual abuse survivors. &quot;Paul O&#x27;Dwyer SC, a counsel for abuse survivors, renewed his application for the Cardinal&#x27;s medical records to be made public.&quot; After the announcement that Pell would testify from Rome in 2016, a GoFundMe campaign was launched to fund a trip to Rome by 15 victims of child sexual abuse to see Pell give evidence in person. It reached its target of A$55,000 in one day, doubled that the following day and trebled the day after. Comedian and musician Tim Minchin wrote and recorded the strongly-worded song &quot;Come Home (Cardinal Pell)&quot;, with all proceeds to go to the gofundme campaign. Within 24 hours it had over 400,000 views on YouTube and became the number one position on the iTunes song chart in Australia. In the event, Pell&#x27;s testimony was witnessed by 15 victims of child sexual abuse and their supporters.

Having sworn on the Bible, Pell stated that he did not think the problems with child sexual abuse were with the institutional structure of the Catholic Church. &quot;The Church has made enormous mistakes and is working to remedy those&quot;, he said. &quot;The Church in many places, certainly in Australia, has mucked things up, has let people down. I&#x27;m not here to defend the indefensible.&quot; Counsel assisting the royal commission alleged that there were also wider problems with the church&#x27;s hierarchy in Australia and Rome and beyond, which they thought he understated or sidestepped. Regarding the allegations of children, he said that &quot;the predisposition was not to believe&quot; and that the instinct was to protect the church. He said: &quot;Too many of them certainly were dismissed and sometimes they were dismissed in absolutely scandalous circumstances ... They were very, very, very plausible allegations made by responsible people that were not followed up sufficiently.&quot; Pell also stated that the way Gerald Ridsdale was dealt with was &quot;a catastrophe for the victims and a catastrophe for the church&quot;. Referring to rumours of child sexual abuse he added: &quot;in those days&quot;, he said, &quot;if a priest denied such activity, I was very strongly inclined to accept the denial&quot;.

In June 2016 the Holy See Press Office director Federico Lombardi announced that Pell would continue in his role as prefect of the Secretariat for the Economy, despite being obliged to submit his resignation on turning 75. Lombardi reminded reporters that Pope Francis had previously expressed his full confidence in Pell, and that Francis wished him to continue as prefect.

====Gerald Ridsdale====
Pell served as an assistant priest at St Alipius&#x27; Church in Ballarat East and, in 1973, shared a house with Gerald Ridsdale, a priest who was later laicised and jailed for child sex crimes. Ridsdale was convicted between 1993 and 2017 of child sexual abuse and indecent assault charges against children aged as young as four years during the 1970s and 1980s, with the 79 known victims thought to be a small proportion of his actual total. Pell was part of a leadership group of priests in the Diocese of Ballarat who met during 1982 and discussed moving Ridsdale from the parish at and sending him to Sydney. Pell denied knowing about any of Ridsdale&#x27;s actions. Journalist and former priest Paul Bongiorno, who also lived in a presbytery with Ridsdale, told ABC radio that Ridsdale concealed his activities: &quot;They hide it. It was certainly hidden from me. And when it came out, after I&#x27;d left the priesthood, I was shocked and I was ashamed.&quot;

In March 2016, when asked by the royal commission why he had agreed to walk Ridsdale into the courthouse in Melbourne during his 1993 criminal trial, Pell responded, &quot;I had some status as an auxiliary bishop and I was asked to appear with the ambition that this would lessen the term of punishment, lessen his time in jail.&quot; Peter Saunders, the victims&#x27; advocate and a former Catholic priest, said that Pell&#x27;s response &quot;demonstrates once again the callousness, the coldheartedness and the contempt that George Pell appears to display for this whole issue and particularly for the victims of these dreadful crimes&quot;.

In 2002 on &quot;60 Minutes&quot;, David Ridsdale, a victim of child sexual abuse in Ballarat and a nephew of Gerald Ridsdale, accused Pell of attempting to bribe him in 1993 to prevent allegations of child sexual abuse being made public. The allegation was examined at the royal commission and received further wide publicity. However, Gail Furness, a counsel-assisting the royal commission, conceded in her final submission to the commission that, given it was already known to Pell that Gerald Ridsdale was subject to police investigation and that David Ridsdale had requested a &quot;private&quot; rather than police process, &quot;it is not likely that Bishop Pell would then have thought it necessary to offer Mr Ridsdale an inducement to prevent him from going to the police or public with his allegations&quot; and Ridsdale could have &quot;misinterpreted Bishop Pell&#x27;s offer of assistance&quot;.

====Commission conclusions====

On 7 May 2020, the royal commission revealed its findings regarding Pell, which had been made by 2017 but were withheld while Pell&#x27;s own sexual abuse case was ongoing. concluding that Pell knew of child sexual abuse by clergy by the 1970s, but did not take adequate action to address it. Pell responded that the commission&#x27;s views &quot;are not supported by evidence&quot;.

For the case of Gerald Ridsdale, while Pell was a priest in Ballarat, the commission concluded that &quot;in 1973 Father Pell turned his mind to the prudence of Ridsdale taking boys on overnight camps&quot;, with child sexual abuse &quot;on his radar, in relation to&quot; Ridsdale. The commission concluded that &quot;by 1973, Cardinal Pell was not only conscious of child sexual abuse by clergy, but he also considered measures of avoiding situations which might provoke gossip about it&quot;.

For the case of Peter Searson, while Pell was an auxiliary bishop in Melbourne, the commission concluded that given the information Pell had in 1989, he &quot;should have advised the Archbishop to remove Father Searson and he did not do so&quot;. Pell had told the commission that, in 1989, he received a list of grievances about Searson. The list included statements that Searson had harassed children, parents and school staff, used children&#x27;s toilets without cause, shown children a dead body and practised animal cruelty. The commission concluded that it &quot;ought to have been obvious&quot; to Pell that he needed to have Searson removed, while rejecting Pell&#x27;s statement that he had been &quot;deceived&quot; regarding Searson&#x27;s case by education officials. Pell removed Searson in 1997 when he had become the archbishop.

For the case of Wilfred James Baker, while Pell was the Archbishop of Melbourne, the commission concluded that Pell had the power to remove Baker in August 1996 when he learned that Baker was about to be charged. Pell did not remove Baker then, resulting in Baker continuing as a priest in a parish with a primary school until May 1997. Baker was jailed in 1999 for child sexual abuse.

==Allegations of child sexual abuse==

=== 2002 allegation ===

In June 2002, a Melbourne man named Phil Scott accused Pell of sexually abusing him at a Catholic youth camp in 1961, when the accuser was 12 years old and Pell was a young seminarian. Pell denied the accusations and stood aside while the inquiry continued. The complainant agreed to pursue his allegations through the church&#x27;s own process for dealing with allegations of sexual misconduct, the National Committee for Professional Standards. Retired Victorian Supreme Court Justice Alec Southwell, appointed commissioner by the church to investigate the matter, found that the complainant, despite his long criminal record, had mostly given the impression of speaking honestly from actual recollection but concluded as follows: &quot;bearing in mind the forensic difficulties of the defence occasioned by the very long delay, some valid criticism of the complainant&#x27;s credibility, the lack of corroborative evidence and the sworn denial of the respondent, I find I am not &#x27;satisfied that the complaint has been established. Pell said he had been exonerated, while the complainant&#x27;s solicitor said his client had been vindicated.

===Victoria Police investigations===

In March 2013, Victoria Police launched Operation Tethering to investigate whether Pell had committed unreported crimes. On 20 February 2016, the &quot;Herald Sun&quot; newspaper reported that Pell had been under investigation for the past year by detectives from the Victoria Police SANO Taskforce over sexual abuse allegations involving between five and ten boys that occurred between 1978 and 2001 when he was a priest in Ballarat and when he was Archbishop of Melbourne. His office issued a statement denying the allegations, and asked for an inquiry into the leaking of information by Victoria Police officers. Victoria Police remained silent on whether Pell was being investigated. The SANO Taskforce was established in 2012 to investigate allegations arising from the Victorian Government&#x27;s &quot;Inquiry into the Handling of Child Abuse by Religious and Other Organisations&quot; and the subsequent Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse.

On 28 July 2016, the Chief Commissioner of Victoria Police, Graham Ashton, confirmed that there was an investigation into alleged child sexual abuse by Pell, and stated he was awaiting advice from the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP). On 17 August 2016, Victoria Police said a response had been received from the DPP, but would not disclose the DPP&#x27;s recommendations.

In October 2016, three Victoria Police officers from the SANO Task Force flew to Rome to interview Pell, who participated voluntarily, regarding allegations of sexual assault. In February 2017, Victoria Police advised that the brief of evidence against Pell had been returned to the Office of Public Prosecutions. That office subsequently provided advice to Victoria Police in May 2017.

=== Trial, conviction and acquittal ===
==== Initial charges and hearings ====
On 29 June 2017, Victoria Police announced they were charging Pell with a series of sexual assault offences with several counts and several victims. At a press conference in Rome, Pell denied the allegations. Pell left the Vatican in July and voluntarily returned to Australia to face trial. Details of the charges were not made public.

On 26 July 2017, Pell appeared at the Melbourne Magistrates&#x27; Court and entered a plea of not guilty. He was represented by barrister Robert Richter. An application by the media seeking public disclosure of the details of the charges was refused by the magistrate. At a procedural hearing in November, Pell&#x27;s lawyers requested documents from ABC News journalist Louise Milligan and Melbourne University Press relating to Milligan&#x27;s book &quot;Cardinal: the Rise and Fall of George Pell&quot; which was published in early 2017.

In January 2018, accuser Damian Dignan died after a long illness. Dignan&#x27;s charge was withdrawn. Pell&#x27;s lawyers requested but were denied the personal medical information of the complainants. Pell&#x27;s defence was reported to be based on questioning the timing of allegations. Some other charges were dropped after a complainant was ruled medically unfit to give evidence.

The committal hearing to determine whether there was enough evidence to commit Pell to stand trial commenced on 5 March 2018. The hearing allowed for approximately fifty witnesses to give evidence, including former choirboys. The magistrate allowed Pell&#x27;s barrister to cross-examine all but five witnesses. Pell&#x27;s barrister said the allegations involving St Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral were impossible.

Magistrate Belinda Wallington concluded that there was enough evidence for the case to proceed on about half of the charges. On 1 May 2018, Pell was committed to stand trial on several charges of sexual offending. Pell entered pleas of not guilty. As a bail condition, Pell was not permitted to leave Australia.

On 2 May 2018, Pell appeared in the County Court of Victoria for a directions hearing before Judge Sue Pullen. It was agreed that he would undergo two separate trials with two separate juries and that the charges would be heard separately for each trial. He was to be tried in relation to allegations of sexual offences taking place at St Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral, Melbourne, in 1990 in the first case (the cathedral trial) and in relation to further allegations taking place at a Ballarat swimming pool in the 1970s in the second case (the swimmers trial). Prosecutors sought a media ban on reporting on the trials until the verdict in the second trial. A suppression order was subsequently issued by Chief Judge Peter Kidd on 25 June 2018. The purpose of the order was to prevent prejudice to Pell caused by jurors in the swimmers trial knowing the outcome of the cathedral trial.

====Cathedral trial====
Pell&#x27;s first trial for the allegations of misconduct in St Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral began in August 2018 under Chief Judge Kidd with representation by Robert Richter. However, it ended with the jury unable to reach a unanimous verdict. This necessitated a retrial, with another jury. A retrial was conducted, again under Kidd. On 11 December 2018, Pell was convicted on five counts of child sexual abuse of two boys in the 1990s.

Australian media outlets generally respected the suppression order preventing publication of details on the cathedral trial whereas international news sources reported the conviction. The Melbourne-based &quot;Herald Sun&quot; posted on its front page &quot;CENSORED&quot; in large print in protest of the ban, noting that international sources were reporting on a &quot;very important story that is relevant to Victorians&quot;. In a statement made to &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, Noah Shachtman, editor-in-chief of the online news magazine &quot;The Daily Beast&quot;, consulted with American and Australian lawyers but ultimately considered it an &quot;easy call&quot; to report on the conviction, though he did place geo-blocking restrictions to prevent online access to the story from Australia. More than 140 international news reports were published within 24 hours. Pell&#x27;s barrister informed Chief Judge Kidd that the guilty verdict was accessible on Wikipedia.

====Swimmers trial: prosecution withdraws its case====
At the time of Pell&#x27;s conviction in the cathedral trial, a second trial was pending regarding unrelated allegations that he sexually assaulted two boys while throwing them in the air in a Ballarat swimming pool in the late 1970s. These allegations had been raised by the ABC, leading to a Victoria Police investigation; however, Victoria&#x27;s Director of Public Prosecutions dropped the charges after Chief Judge Kidd on 22 February 2019 disallowed the prosecution&#x27;s submission of evidence from complainants on the grounds that each piece of evidence was not sufficient. News of Pell&#x27;s conviction was published in Australia on 26 February 2019 when the suppression order was lifted following the withdrawal.

====Cathedral trial sentencing====
At a pre-sentencing hearing on 27 February 2019, Pell&#x27;s bail was revoked and he was taken into custody at the Melbourne Assessment Prison. Pell&#x27;s lawyers released a statement that Pell maintained his innocence, and advised that an appeal had been filed on three grounds.

The sentencing hearing on 13 March 2019 was broadcast live to the public, with Chief Judge Kidd sentencing Pell to serve six years in jail with a non-parole period of three years and eight months. Pell was also registered as a sex offender. He served 404 days in prison, much of it in solitary confinement, before being acquitted.

====Breach of suppression order by media====
In the Supreme Court on 26 March 2019, Victoria&#x27;s Director of Public Prosecutions named 36 media outlets, journalists and broadcasters and applied that they be found guilty, convicted and either imprisoned or fined for breaching the suppression order. International media did not face charges.

===Appeal===
The Court of Appeal of the Supreme Court of Victoria heard pleadings for Pell being granted leave to appeal simultaneously with the appeal itself in June 2019. Pell was represented by Bret Walker SC. Three grounds of appeal were lodged: that the verdict was unreasonable, that permission to use in their closing address a visual aid prepared by the defence that illustrated the locations of people within the cathedral around the time of the first assault had been refused, and that Pell had not been arraigned in the presence of the jury as is required under standard criminal procedures in Victoria. Judgment was reserved, without setting a date to deliver the decision.

On 21 August 2019, the Court of Appeal issued its ruling, which upheld the convictions. The three-judge panel comprised Chief Justice Anne Ferguson, President of the Court of Appeal, Justice Chris Maxwell and Justice Mark Weinberg. On the first ground of appeal, that the verdict was unreasonable, the court granted leave to appeal but dismissed the appeal by a majority (2–1) decision. Ferguson and Maxwell dismissed the appeal. Ferguson stated that, for the appeal to succeed, the court needed to find that the jury &quot;must&quot; have had doubt as to the defendant&#x27;s guilt, not merely that they &quot;could&quot; have had doubt. Weinberg issued a dissenting judgment and would have allowed the appeal on the first ground.

Whilst Ferguson and Maxwell stated that they did not experience a doubt in the case, Weinberg, the dissenting judge, likened the case to that of Lindy Chamberlain, which had seen wrongful conviction by a jury and appeal court based on faulty evidence. Weinberg wrote that the applicant should be acquitted on each charge.

The court unanimously refused leave to appeal on the second and third grounds.

=== Acquittal ===

In September 2019, Pell sought special leave to appeal to the High Court of Australia, the final court of appeal in Australia. Pell&#x27;s lawyers submitted that Pell&#x27;s conviction should be overturned on the basis that, in the face of exculpatory evidence, the Court of Appeal had relied on their belief in the complainant to eliminate doubt and uphold the conviction. The prosecution submission asserted that the appeal judgement had glossed over evidence that supported his conviction. The appeal was heard on 11 and 12 March 2020 by a full bench of seven justices.

On 7 April 2020, in a unanimous judgment, the High Court allowed the appeal, quashing Pell&#x27;s convictions and determining that judgments of acquittal be entered in their place. The court found that the jury ought to have entertained a doubt as to the applicant&#x27;s guilt. The court agreed with Weinberg&#x27;s judgment in the Court of Appeal, finding that the majority might have effectively reversed the burden of proof. In their judgment, the judges said with respect to all five charges that, &quot;Making full allowance for the advantages enjoyed by the jury, there is a significant possibility ... that an innocent person has been convicted.&quot;

=== Reactions after acquittal ===

==== Criticism of ABC&#x27;s Pell coverage ====

Following Pell&#x27;s acquittal, prior media coverage of his case came under intense scrutiny. Australia&#x27;s national broadcaster, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC), was accused of sustained bias against Pell both before and during the trial and appeals. Pell said the ABC had betrayed the national interest in overwhelmingly presenting a single view of the case, and that he was a target because of his socially conservative views.

The ABC dismissed criticisms of its coverage and defended its pursuit of Pell as having been without fear or favour. After criticism that its documentary series &quot;Revelation&quot; (which presented Pell as guilty) had been timed to coincide with the High Court decision, the ABC denied rushing the program, but temporarily removed it from its digital platform to allow the producers to include reference to Pell&#x27;s acquittal and subsequent release from Barwon Prison. The series was restored to ABC&#x27;s digital platform and went on to win the Walkley Documentary Award. The ABC noted that &quot;Revelation&quot; had actually been pushed back several days due to Prime Minister Scott Morrison making a televised address to the nation regarding the COVID-19 outbreak.

==== Criticism of Victorian criminal justice system ====

Criticism of the conduct of Victoria Police, the DPP and the Court of Appeal judges resulted from the High Court verdict. Right-wing commentator Keith Windschuttle published a book, &quot;The Persecution of George Pell&quot;, arguing that Pell had faced a concerted campaign by Victorian police, judiciary and victims&#x27; advocates to convict him on flimsy evidence.

==== Criticism of the High Court&#x27;s verdict ====

In response to support for the acquittal, legal scholar Jeremy Patrick wrote that it is for juries to decide if they accept evidence in whole or part, not judges. He pointed out that the acquittal did not happen because the High Court &quot;heard stunning new exonerating evidence, had found an error in law by the trial judge on a crucial point, realised there was jury misconduct, or anything of that sort. Instead, it heard the exact same evidence and the exact same arguments that were made at trial, and simply reached a different conclusion than the jury on contested matters of fact and credibility.&quot; However, its conclusion was flawed by &quot;[an] unquestioning belief in the defendant’s witnesses, an illogical ‘probabilistic’ analysis of a discrete, unreplicable historical event, and an eager willingness to substitute their own opinion for the jury’s verdict because it reached the ‘wrong’ outcome.&quot;

=== Media charges ===
In January 2021, the Supreme Court of Victoria heard charges against 27 media companies, reporters and editors with offences, mainly contempt of court, for their coverage of the Pell verdict by breaching the suppression order and the subjudice ruleeven though no outlet had named Pell in their coverage, but rather had published protests at the suppression order. Twelve media companiesincluding the &quot;Herald Sun&quot;, the &quot;Courier Mail&quot;, the &quot;Sydney Morning Herald&quot;, &quot;The Age&quot; (which was fined $450,000), News Corp Australia (which was fined $400,000) and Nine Entertainment Co. (whose other newspapers were fined $162,000)pleaded guilty to contempt of court and apologised. The companies were to receive fines and would pay $650,000 of the state&#x27;s legal costs. In exchange for these guilty pleas, 15 charges against individual journalists were dropped.

Justice John Dixon found that the 12 organisations had usurped the role of the court; they had taken it upon themselves to determine where the balance ought to lie between Pell&#x27;s right to a fair trial and the public&#x27;s right to know. He did not accept their submission that their breach of the suppression order was an honest mistake. Rather, he found, in most cases the reporting demonstrated that the organisations disagreed with the suppression order and felt the media should not be restrained from reporting the outcome of the trial. Although media overseas had reported Pell&#x27;s conviction, he thought that potential jury members for the second trial were likely to rely upon local media rather than an internet search and, in any case, overseas reporting did not affect the seriousness of Australian media&#x27;s breach of the suppression order.

===2022 legal action===
In 2022, the father of a schoolboy who was allegedly abused by Pell launched legal action against Pell and the Catholic Archdiocese of Melbourne. Following Pell&#x27;s death, it was announced that the case would proceed, with the claim to be against the Melbourne archdiocese and Pell&#x27;s estate. The Melbourne archdiocese sought to prevent the lawsuit by appealing first to the Supreme Court of Victoria, who refused the appeal, and then to the High Court of Australia, who allowed the lawsuit to proceed by refusing the plaintiff special leave to appeal.

=== National Redress Scheme findings ===

In 2025, the National Redress Scheme found that, when Pell was a priest in Ballarat in the 1970s, he had sexually abused two schoolboys. It was found &quot;reasonably likely&quot; that Pell had anally raped a boy aged nine in a school gymnasium and had genitally groped a boy aged eight during a game at a swimming pool. The Roman Catholic Diocese of Ballarat disputed the allegations. The Scheme granted the compensations sought: to the older victim $95,000 and to the younger $45,000.

==Writings==
Pell wrote widely in religious and secular magazines, including journals and newspapers in Australia and overseas. He regularly spoke on television and radio. His other publications included &quot;The Sisters of St Joseph in Swan Hill 1922–72&quot; (1972), &quot;Catholicism in Australia&quot; (1988), &quot;Rerum Novarum – One Hundred Years Later&quot; (1992), &quot;Catholicism and the Architecture of Freedom&quot;.

<text>Metrocles (; fl. c. 325 BC) was a Cynic philosopher from Maroneia. He studied in Aristotle’s Lyceum under Theophrastus, and eventually became a follower of Crates of Thebes, who married Metrocles’ sister Hipparchia. Very little survives of his writings, but he is important as one of the first Cynics to adopt the practice of writing moral anecdotes (&quot;chreiai&quot;) about Diogenes and other Cynics.

==Life==
The supposed story of Metrocles&#x27; conversion to Cynicism is reported by Diogenes Laërtius. Metrocles had apparently farted while practicing a speech, and became so upset that he shut himself up in his home, attempting to commit suicide by starving himself. Crates visited him and made him a dinner of lupines, explaining to him that what he had done was according to nature and therefore nothing to be ashamed of. When Crates himself farted to demonstrate how natural it was, Metrocles was persuaded to let go of his shame.

Whether or not this story is true, the symbolism for the Cynics is that it demonstrated the worthlessness of Metrocles&#x27; education up until that time. As a pupil of Theophrastus he may have learned a lot of information, but he was still obsessed with social conventions and good manners, to the point of being ready to die from embarrassment. With Crates&#x27; help he was able to let go of his old ways and embrace a Cynic life free from convention, and find true happiness.

Equally significant is a passage preserved in the writings of Teles, who tells how Metrocles as a young student of the Lyceum and the Academy could not keep up with the extravagant life-style requirements:
When he was studying with Theophrastus and Xenocrates, although many things were being sent to him from home, he was in constant fear of dying from hunger and was always destitute and in want. But when he later changed over to Crates, he could feed even another person though nothing was sent from home. For in the former case he had to have shoes... then a cloak, a following of slaves, and a grand house; for the common table he had to see that the breads were pure, the delicacies above the ordinary, the wine sweet, the entertainment appropriate, so that here there was much expense. For among them such a way of life was judged to be &#x27;liberal.&#x27;

According to Hecato of Rhodes, Metrocles burned all his writings, but others said it was only the notes he took in the school of Theophrastus that he burned. It may have been via Metrocles that his sister Hipparchia met Crates, whom she later married, thus also becoming a Cynic. Plutarch represents Metrocles as sleeping in the winter amongst sheep, and in the summer in the porches of temples. He apparently knew the Megarian philosopher Stilpo and disputed with him, and Stilpo wrote a dialogue called &quot;Metrocles&quot;. In his biography of Metrocles, Diogenes Laërtius seemingly lists a number of his pupils, but the list probably refers to Crates. Metrocles died at a great age, and is said to have deliberately suffocated himself.

==Writings==
Metrocles was a man of great ability, and wrote several works, but little of his thought survives. He objected to wealth unless it was put to good use; and he divided things into those that can be bought with money (such as a house), and those that take time and care, like education. One of his works was called &quot;Chreiai&quot; (), that is, &quot;Anecdotes&quot;, or &quot;Maxims&quot;. Thus he became one of the first to contribute to the most important literary art-form for the Cynics: thousands of anecdotes were accumulated (and invented) concerning Diogenes, Crates and other Cynics, all of them providing moral messages through the actions of the Cynics. An anecdote written by Metrocles concerning Diogenes is preserved by Laërtius:
On one occasion Diogenes went with his head half-shaved into an entertainment of young men, as Metrocles tells us in his &quot;Chreiai&quot;, and so was beaten by them. And afterwards he wrote the names of all those who had beaten him, on a white tablet, and went about with the tablet round his neck, so as to expose them to insult, as they were generally condemned and reproached for their conduct.

<text>Andrew Alan Samwick is an American economist, who served as Chief Economist on the staff of the United States President&#x27;s Council of Economic Advisors from July 2003 to July 2004. Samwick is currently Professor of Economics at Dartmouth College (since 1994) and the director of the Nelson A. Rockefeller Center for Public Policy and the Social Sciences. He has also held teaching positions at Columbia University’s Graduate School of Business. In 2009, Samwick was named the New Hampshire Professor of the Year by the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching. He is also a current editor of Economics Letters.

==Education==
Samwick received a Bachelor of Arts, &quot;summa cum laude&quot;, in economics and was a member of Phi Beta Kappa at Harvard College in 1989. He received his Ph.D. in Economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1993. At MIT, he was the recipient of several grants and fellowships including: the National Institute on Aging, Pre-doctoral Training Grant (1992–1993), the Lynde and Harry Bradley Foundation Fellowship (1992–1993) and the National Science Foundation Graduate Fellowship (1989–1992).

==Research and advising==
Samwick has consulted for the Canadian government, the U.S. Social Security Administration, the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, and the World Bank. Professor Samwick has also offered Congressional testimony on Social Security and retirement issues.

He is a research associate of the National Bureau of Economic Research and the co-organizer of its Social Security Working Group. His research interests include: finance, macroeconomics, Social Security, saving, and taxation. His work has appeared in &quot;The American Economic Review&quot;, &quot;The Journal of Political Economy&quot; and &quot;The Journal of Finance&quot; among others. In 2000, Professor Samwick was awarded Dartmouth&#x27;s Karen E. Wetterhahn Award for Distinguished Creative or Scholarly Achievement.

Writing on his blog in 2007, Samwick urged his former colleagues in the Bush administration to avoid asserting that the Bush tax cuts paid for themselves, because &quot;No thoughtful person believes [it]... Not a single one.&quot;

In 2024, Samwick signed a faculty letter expressing support for the actions of Dartmouth College president Sian Beilock, who ordered the arrests of 90 students and faculty members nonviolently protesting the Israel-Hamas war.

<text>A possessive or ktetic form (abbreviated or ; from ; ) is a word or grammatical construction indicating a relationship of possession in a broad sense. This can include strict ownership, or a number of other types of relation to a greater or lesser degree analogous to it.

Most European languages feature possessive forms associated with personal pronouns, like the English &quot;my&quot;, &quot;mine&quot;, &quot;your&quot;, &quot;yours&quot;, &quot;his&quot; and so on. There are two main ways in which these can be used (and a variety of terminologies for each):
* Together with a noun, as in &quot;my car&quot;, &quot;your sisters&quot;, &quot;his boss&quot;. Here the possessive form serves as a &quot;possessive determiner&quot;.
* Without an accompanying noun, as in &quot;mine is red&quot;, &quot;I prefer yours&quot;, &quot;this book is his&quot;. A possessive used in this way is called a &quot;substantive possessive pronoun&quot;, a possessive pronoun or an &quot;absolute pronoun&quot;.

Some languages, including English, also have possessive forms derived from nouns or nominal phrases, such as &quot;Jane&#x27;s&quot;, &quot;the&quot; &quot;cows&#x27; &quot; and &quot;nobody else&#x27;s&quot;. These can be used in the same two ways as the pronoun-derived forms: &quot;Jane&#x27;s office&quot; or &quot;that one is Jane&#x27;s&quot;.

Possessives are sometimes regarded as a grammatical case (the &quot;possessive case&quot;), although they are also sometimes considered to represent the genitive case, or are not assigned to any case, depending on which language is being considered. On the other hand, some languages, such as the Cariban languages, can be said to have a &quot;possessed case&quot;, used to indicate the other party (the thing possessed) in a possession relationship. A similar feature found in some languages is the possessive affix, usually a suffix, added to the (possessed) noun to indicate the possessor, as in the Finnish &quot;taloni&quot; (&quot;my house&quot;), where &quot;talo&quot; means &quot;house&quot; and the suffix &quot;-ni&quot; means &quot;my&quot;.

The concepts of possessive forms and genitive forms are sometimes conflated, although they are not exactly the same. The genitive form, which does not exist in modern English as a productive inflection outside of pronouns (see below), represents an &quot;of&quot; relationship, which may or may not be possessive; in other words, the possessive is a subset of genitive. For example, the genitive construction &quot;speed &quot;of the car&quot; is equivalent to the possessive form &quot;the car&#x27;s&quot; speed&quot;. However, the genitive construction &quot;pack &quot;of dogs&quot; is not the same as the possessive form &quot;dogs&quot;&#x27; pack&quot; (though it is the same as &quot;dog pack&quot;, which is not possessive).

==Formation==

===From pronouns===
The personal pronouns of many languages correspond to both a set of possessive determiners and a set of possessive pronouns. For example, the English personal pronouns &quot;I&quot;, &quot;you&quot;, &quot;he&quot;, &quot;she&quot;, &quot;it&quot;, &quot;we&quot; and &quot;they&quot; correspond to the possessive determiners &quot;my&quot;, &quot;your&quot;, &quot;his&quot;, &quot;her&quot;, &quot;its&quot;, &quot;our&quot; and &quot;their&quot; and also to the (substantive) possessive pronouns &quot;mine&quot;, &quot;yours&quot;, &quot;his&quot;, &quot;hers&quot;, &quot;its&quot; (rare), &quot;ours&quot; and &quot;theirs&quot;. In some instances there is no difference in form between the determiner and the pronoun; examples include the English &quot;his&quot; (and &quot;its&quot;), and informal Finnish &quot;meidän&quot; (meaning either &quot;our&quot; or &quot;ours&quot;).

In some languages, possessive determiners are subject to agreement with the noun they modify and possessive pronouns may be subject to agreement with their antecedent, in gender, number and case. For example, French has &quot;mon&quot;, &quot;ma&quot;, &quot;mes&quot;, respectively the masculine singular, feminine singular and plural forms corresponding to the English possessive determiner &quot;my&quot;, as well as the forms &quot;le mien&quot;, &quot;la mienne&quot;, &quot;les mien(ne)s&quot; corresponding to English possessive pronoun &quot;mine&quot;.

Since personal pronouns may also agree in number and gender with their own antecedent or referent, the possessive forms may consequently show agreement with either the &quot;possessor&quot; or the &quot;possessed&quot;, or both. In French (and most other Romance languages) the third-person singular possessives do not indicate the gender of the possessor, instead they agree with the possessed (&quot;son&quot;, &quot;sa&quot; and &quot;ses&quot; can all mean &quot;his&quot;, &quot;her&quot; or &quot;its&quot;). In Spanish the number is always indicated but the gender is only indicated for possessive pronouns, not possessive determiners; &quot;mi padre, mi madre, mis hermanos, mis hermanas&quot; (my father, my mother, my brothers, my sisters), but &quot;mío, mía, míos, mías&quot; when used as &quot;mine&quot; to refer to the previous. This contrasts with standard Dutch and English, where the form of the possessives (&quot;zijn&quot;, &quot;haar;&quot; &quot;his&quot;, &quot;her&quot;, &quot;its&quot;) indicates the grammatical or natural gender of the possessor, but does not depend on properties of the possessed. Additionally, German and several Dutch dialects additionally inflect their possessives, thus giving agreement with both possessor and possessed; German has &quot;sein&quot; and &quot;ihr&quot; meaning &quot;his&quot; and &quot;her&quot; respectively, but these inflect to give (for example) feminine forms like &quot;seine&quot; and &quot;ihre&quot;, depending on the gender (and number and case) of the thing possessed.

In languages that have a genitive case, the possessive forms corresponding to pronouns may or may not resemble the genitive of those pronouns. For example, in Russian, the genitive of я &quot;ja&quot; &quot;I&quot; is меня &quot;menya&quot; (&quot;of me&quot;), whereas the corresponding possessive is мой &quot;moy&quot; (&quot;my, mine&quot;, in masculine singular nominative form). In German the two sets of forms are quite similar (for example, the genitive of &quot;ich&quot; &quot;I&quot; is &quot;meiner&quot;, the corresponding possessive pronoun is also &quot;meiner&quot; in the masculine singular nominative, and the possessive determiner is &quot;mein&quot; with various endings).

Some languages have no distinct possessive determiners as such, instead using a pronoun together with a &quot;possessive particle&quot; – a grammatical particle used to indicate possession. For example, in Japanese, &quot;my&quot; or &quot;mine&quot; can be expressed as &quot;watashi no&quot;, where &quot;watashi&quot; means &quot;I&quot; and &quot;no&quot; is the possessive particle. Similarly in Mandarin Chinese, &quot;my&quot; or &quot;mine&quot; is &quot;wǒ de&quot;, where &quot;wǒ&quot; means &quot;I&quot; and &quot;de&quot; is the possessive particle.

An alternative to the pronominal possessive determiner, found in some languages, including Finnish and Hungarian, is the possessive affix, usually a suffix, attached to the noun denoting the thing possessed. For example, in Finnish the suffix &quot;-ni&quot; means &quot;my&quot;, producing forms such as &quot;taloni&quot; (&quot;my house&quot;), from &quot;talo&quot; (&quot;house&quot;). Hungarian possessive suffixes are used in a similar way, as in &quot;háza&quot; (&quot;his/her house&quot;), formed from &quot;ház&quot; (&quot;house&quot;). In Hungarian this affix can also be used when the possessor is represented by a full noun, as described in the next section.

Pronouns other than personal pronouns, if they have possessive forms, are likely to form them in a similar way to nouns (see below). In English, for example, possessive forms derived from other pronouns include &quot;one&#x27;s&quot;, &quot;somebody&#x27;s&quot; and &quot;nobody&#x27;s&quot;. There is however a distinct form &quot;whose&quot; for the possessive of the interrogative and relative pronoun &quot;who&quot;; other languages may have similarly functioning words, such as the Russian чей &quot;chey&quot; (&quot;whose?&quot;). Another possessive found in Russian and other Slavic languages is the reflexive possessive, corresponding to the general reflexive pronoun; the Russian form is свой &quot;svoj&quot; (meaning &quot;one&#x27;s (own)&quot;, &quot;my (own)&quot;, etc.).

===From nouns===
In some languages, possessives can be formed from nouns or nominal phrases. In English, this is done using the ending &quot;-&#x27;s&quot;, as in &quot;Jane&#x27;s&quot;, &quot;heaven&#x27;s&quot;, &quot;the boy&#x27;s&quot;, &quot;those young men&#x27;s&quot;, or sometimes just an apostrophe, as in &quot;workers&#x27;,&quot; &quot;Jesus&#x27;,&quot; &quot;the soldiers&#x27;.&quot; Note that the ending can be added at the end of a noun phrase even when the phrase does not end with its head noun, as in &quot;the king of England&#x27;s&quot;; this property inclines many linguists towards the view that the ending is a clitic rather than a case ending (see below, and further at English possessive).

In languages that have a genitive case, the genitive form of a noun may sometimes be used as a possessive (as in German &quot;Karls Haus&quot; &quot;Karl&#x27;s house&quot;). Languages such as Japanese and Chinese form possessive constructions with nouns using possessive particles, in the same way as described for pronouns above. An example from Japanese is:

In other languages, noun possessives must be formed periphrastically, as in French &quot;la plume de ma tante&quot; (&quot;my aunt&#x27;s pen&quot;, literally &quot;the pen of my aunt&quot;). In Hungarian, the construction &quot;Mária háza&quot; is used (&quot;Maria&#x27;s house&quot;, literally &quot;Maria her house&quot;, where the final &quot;-a&quot; in &quot;háza&quot; is the possessive suffix meaning &quot;her&quot;). The possessor noun can carry an additional dative marker, in which case an article appears before the noun. For example, &quot;Peter&#x27;s house&quot; may be translated either as:



==Syntax==
Possessive determiners are used in combination with a noun, playing the role of a determiner or attributive adjective. In English and some other languages, the use of such a word implies the definite article. For example, &quot;my car&quot; implies &quot;the car that belongs to me&quot; or &quot;is used by me&quot;; it is not correct to precede possessives with an article (*&quot;the my car&quot;) or other definite determiner such as a demonstrative (*&quot;this my car&quot;), although they can combine with quantifiers in the same ways that &quot;the&quot; can (&quot;all my cars&quot;, &quot;my three cars&quot;, etc.; see English determiners). This is not the case in all languages; for example in Italian the possessive is usually preceded by another determiner such as an article, as in &quot;la mia macchina&quot; (&quot;my car&quot;, literally &quot;the my car&quot;) or &quot;quel tuo libro&quot; (&quot;that book of yours&quot;, literally &quot;that your book&quot;).

Some languages place the possessive after the noun, as in Norwegian &quot;boka mi&quot; (&quot;my book&quot;). Here again the equivalent of the definite article – in this case the definite ending &quot;-a&quot; on the noun &quot;bok&quot; – is used in addition to the possessive. However, the forms &quot;min bok&quot; or &quot;mi bok&quot;, where the noun &quot;bok&quot; is in the indefinite form, are equally correct.

Possessive determiners may be modified with an adverb, as adjectives are, although not as freely or as commonly. Such modification is generally limited to such adverbs as &quot;more&quot;, &quot;less&quot;, or &quot;as much ... as&quot; (comparative) or &quot;mostly&quot; (superlative), for example in &quot;This is more my team than your team&quot; and &quot;This is mostly my team&quot;.

Substantive possessive pronouns are used on their own and cannot be used to describe a noun, playing the role of noun phrases, so &quot;mine&quot; may stand for &quot;my cat&quot;, &quot;my sister&quot;, &quot;my things&quot;, etc. In some languages these may require articles or other determiners, as the French &quot;le mien&quot; etc. In English, the &quot;-&#x27;s&quot; possessives formed from nouns or noun phrases can be used in the same way; &quot;the president&#x27;s&quot; may stand for &quot;the president&#x27;s office&quot;, &quot;the president&#x27;s policies&quot;, etc., as determined by the context.

A related use is that of the predicative expression, as in sentences like &quot;the book is mine&quot;. Here &quot;mine&quot; may be considered to be a predicate adjective (like &quot;red&quot; in &quot;the book is red&quot;) rather than a pronoun; in English, however, the same possessive form is used. Other languages may use differing forms; for example French may use &quot;...est à moi&quot; for &quot;...is mine&quot;.

A particular use of possessive pronouns and noun forms in English is that illustrated in phrases like &quot;a friend of mine&quot; and &quot;that coat of Fred&#x27;s&quot;, used to form possessive expressions when the desired determiner is something other than the default &quot;the&quot; implied in the usual possessive determiner.

==Terminology==
The terminology used for possessive words and phrases is not consistent among all grammarians and linguists.

What some authors refer to as &quot;possessives&quot;, others may call &quot;genitives&quot;, and vice versa. Nowadays, however, the term &quot;genitive&quot; is most commonly used in relation to languages with a developed case system (in which the &quot;genitive case&quot; often has a wider range of functions than merely forming possessives), while in languages like English, such words are usually called possessives rather than genitives. A given language may have distinct genitive and possessive forms, as in the example of Russian given above. (The English possessive in &quot;-&#x27;s&quot; is sometimes called the &quot;Saxon genitive&quot;; this alludes to its derivation from the genitive case that existed in Old English. It may also be called the &quot;prenominal genitive&quot;; this also applies to analogous forms in languages such as German.)

Words like the English &quot;my&quot; and &quot;your&quot; have traditionally been called &quot;possessive adjectives&quot;. However, modern linguists note that they behave more like determiners rather than true adjectives (see examples in the section above), and thus prefer the term &quot;possessive determiner&quot;. In some other languages, however, the equivalent words behave more like true adjectives (compare the Italian example above, for instance). While for most authors the term &quot;possessive pronoun&quot; is reserved (as in this article) for possessives like &quot;mine&quot; and &quot;yours&quot; that do not qualify an explicit noun, the term is sometimes taken also to include all possessive forms that correspond to pronouns even though they behave as determiners. Some authors who classify both sets of words as &quot;possessive pronouns&quot; or &quot;genitive pronouns&quot; apply the terms &quot;dependent/independent,&quot; &quot;weak/strong&quot; or &quot;adjectival/substantival&quot; to refer, respectively, to &quot;my&quot;, &quot;your&quot;, etc. and &quot;mine&quot;, &quot;yours&quot;, etc. Thus &quot;my&quot; is termed a &quot;dependent&quot; (or &quot;weak&quot; or &quot;adjectival&quot;) &quot;possessive pronoun&quot;, while &quot;mine&quot; is an &quot;independent&quot; (or &quot;strong&quot; or &quot;substantival&quot;) &quot;possessive pronoun&quot;.

According to the &quot;OED&quot;, the first reference to possessive pronouns is found in 1530; the first use of &quot;possessive&quot; as a noun occurs in 1591, the first use of &quot;possessive case&quot; (which notes that it is like the Latin genitive, and may be called the genitive case in reference to English also) occurs in 1763, and the first use of &quot;possessive adjective&quot; dates from 1870.

The equivalent of Latin &quot;possessivus&quot; in Ancient Greek is κτητικός (&quot;ktētikós&quot;); linguistic terminology also refers to possessives as ktetics, particularly ktetic (possessive) adjectives and names derived from ktetics (ktetic personal names).

==Possessive and possessed case==
Nouns or pronouns with a possessive form are sometimes described as being in the &quot;possessive case&quot;. A more commonly used term in describing the grammar of various languages is &quot;genitive case&quot;, but that usually denotes a case with a broader range of functions than just producing possessive forms. (Some languages occasionally use the dative case to denote the possessor, as in the Serbo-Croatian &quot;kosa mu je gusta&quot; &quot;his hair is thick&quot; (literally &quot;the hair to him is thick&quot; in which &quot;to him&quot; is the dative pronoun &quot;mu&quot;).)

Other theorists reject the idea that the possessive in languages like English represents a grammatical case since possessive forms do not generally behave in a parallel fashion to what are normally identified as cases. In particular, in English, as noted above, the &quot;-&#x27;s&quot; can attach to noun phrases even when they do not end with their head noun, as in &quot;the king of Spain&#x27;s&quot;, which is not typical behavior for a case ending. For further discussion of the issue, see .

Some languages, such as the Cariban languages, can be said to have a &quot;possessed case,&quot; which indicates the thing possessed. In many Afro-Asiatic languages, such as Arabic, nouns take a form with similar significance called the construct state, sometimes even if the possessor is marked in the genitive case. Classical Nahuatl similarly presents an inflected possessed form (or case) in nouns, which contrasts with a non-possessed form (the absolutive).

==Semantics==

The relationship expressed by possessive determiners and similar forms is not necessarily one of possession in the strict sense of ownership. In English, strict possession has been found to be expressed in only about 40% of the situations labeled as &quot;possessive&quot; by linguists, a fact which may incline some to prefer the more traditional term &quot;genitive&quot;. The &quot;possessor&quot; may be, for example:
*the person or thing to which the &quot;possessed&quot; stands in the designated relationship (&quot;my mother&quot;, &quot;his wife&quot;, &quot;your subordinates&quot;, &quot;our boss&quot;);
*the person or thing of which the &quot;possessed&quot; is a part (&quot;my leg&quot;, &quot;the building&#x27;s walls&quot;);
*a person or thing affiliated with or identifying with the &quot;possessed&quot; (&quot;his country&quot;, &quot;our class&quot;, &quot;my people&quot;);
*the performer, or sometimes the undergoer, of an action (&quot;his arrival&quot;, &quot;the government&#x27;s overthrow&quot;)
*the creator, supervisor, user, etc. of the &quot;possessed&quot; (&quot;Prince&#x27;s album&quot;, &quot;the Irish jockey&#x27;s horse&quot;).

For more examples, see Possession (linguistics) and .

== History ==
Before the 18th century, the word possessive was not used, and was considered merely one of several uses of the genitive case. This began to change in 1762 with Robert Lowth, whose use of &quot;possessive&quot; was copied by subsequent writers. One result of this shift in terminology is the mistaken belief that the possessive form is only used for actual cases of possession or ownership (e.g., &quot;my&quot; book, the &quot;family&#x27;s&quot; home) and not to indicate other, non-ownership forms of affiliation or association (e.g., &quot;their&quot; neighbor, the &quot;tree&#x27;s&quot; environs).

<text>Judith Biros Robson (born November 21, 1939) is a retired American nurse, nursing instructor, and Democratic politician from Beloit, Wisconsin. She served 12 years in the Wisconsin Senate and 12 years in the Wisconsin State Assembly, representing Rock County. She was the first female Democratic Senate majority leader in Wisconsin history.

==Biography==
Robson was born in Cleveland, Ohio, and now lives in Beloit, Wisconsin. She received a B.S.N. degree from St. John&#x27;s College in Cleveland, and a master&#x27;s degree from the University of Wisconsin–Madison in 1976. She is a registered nurse. Before being elected to public office, Robson worked as a nurse and as an instructor, primarily at Blackhawk Technical College.

Robson was elected to the Wisconsin State Assembly in June 1987 in a special election to replace Timothy Weeden (who had been elected to the state Senate). She was reelected to her seat several times and served in that house until 1999. In 1998, she was elected to the Wisconsin Senate and reelected in 2002. Robson was selected by her peers to be the Senate Democratic leader in 2005. She was reelected in 2006 and became the Majority Leader of the Wisconsin State Senate in 2007 following the Democratic takeover of the Senate in the 2006 elections. The day after passage of the 2007-2008 state budget, the Senate Democratic Caucus elected Russ Decker to replace Robson as Majority Leader.

<text>Fahri Sabit Korutürk (15 August 1903 – 12 October 1987) was a Turkish admiral, diplomat and politician who was the 6th president of Turkey from 1973 to 1980. Before his presidency, he served as the 3rd commander of the Turkish Naval Forces from 1957 to 1960. He was also a member of the Senate of the Republic from 1968 to 1973 and again in 1980. Prior to his senatorship, he served as Turkey&#x27;s ambassador to the Soviet Union from 1960 to 1964.

==Biography==
He was born in Istanbul, at Soğukçeşme Sokağı, a small street between Topkapı Palace and Hagia Sophia. He attended the Ottoman Navy cadet school in 1916, was graduated in 1923 and from the Naval Academy in 1933. On 18 March 1934 after an encounter with President Atatürk he was given Korutürk as his Surname. Korutürk saw active service on cruisers and submarines and later traveled abroad as naval attaché in Rome, Berlin and Stockholm. In 1936, he participated in Montreux Convention Regarding the Regime of the Turkish Straits as military advisor. He was made rear admiral in 1950 and commanded various units until he became admiral.

After his retirement in 1960 from the post of Commander of the Turkish Navy, Korutürk was appointed by the Head of State Cemal Gürsel as Turkish ambassador to the Soviet Union (1960-1964) and later to Spain (1964-1965). In 1968, President Cevdet Sunay appointed him member of the senate. On 6 April 1973, the Grand National Assembly of Turkey elected him the 6th President of the Republic of Turkey. During his term he presided over the Turkish Invasion of Cyprus after Archbishop Makarios III was ousted by the Greek officer-led Cypriot National Guard.

Korutürk served the constitutional term of seven years until 6 April 1980. Kenan Evren said that he suggested President Korutürk to occupy the office of presidency one more term through military&#x27;s intervention as he was a respected figure by both military officers and parliamentarians, but he refused this offer and stated it would be unconstitutional. Afterwards he became a senator until the coup d`etat in 1980.

He married Emel Korutürk in 1935 and they had two sons, Osman and Selah, and a daughter, Ayşe. Fahri Korutürk died in Moda, Istanbul. He was laid to rest in the Turkish State Cemetery in Ankara.

His son Osman Korutürk was appointed Turkey&#x27;s ambassador in Tehran in October 1996. The Iranian government presented him with documents about his father that had been acquired during 1979 seizure of American embassy. In the documents it&#x27;s said that most ambassadors serving in Soviet Union used the black market to exchange their paychecks with American dollars (which had more value among the population) while Fahri Korutürk is the only one who used Gosbank to exchange his paycheck.

<text>Sanjay Bapusaheb Bangar (born 11 October 1972) is an Indian cricket commentator and the head of cricket development of the IPL franchise Punjab Kings. He is a former Indian international cricketer. He played as an all-rounder and represented the India national cricket team in Tests and ODIs.

==Early life==
Bangar was born in Beed, Maharashtra, India. He has completed his schooling from Saint Francis De Sales High School Aurangabad.
He completed his Bachelor of Commerce from Ramniranjan Jhunjhunwala College, Ghatkopar. He has also completed Company Secretaries Intermediate Course.

== Playing career ==
Bangar began his career playing in the youth teams of Maharashtra and Mumbai, but at state level he made his name representing Railways with his medium-pace bowling and sound defensive batting technique.

In the 2000–01 season, Railways reached the final of the Ranji Trophy where they lost to Baroda. The following season, they went one better and defeated Baroda to win the competition. Bangar&#x27;s performances had caught the eyes of the selectors and he was called up to the Indian squad for their matches against England in the 2001–02 season.

In only his second Test, he scored 100 not out against Zimbabwe at Nagpur batting at number 7. On the 2002 tour of England, he was promoted to open the innings at Headingley after some poor performances by Wasim Jaffer. He responded with his most important innings for India, making a patient 68 on the first day in an invaluable partnership with Rahul Dravid in difficult swinging and seaming conditions. Later on in the same match he also chipped in with two important wickets to set up a rare innings victory for India away from home.

Bangar was named as part of India&#x27;s squad for the 2003 Cricket World Cup, but his performances for India began to tail off, and he made his final appearance for his country in 2004, appearing in 12 Test matches and 15 One Day Internationals in all. He made important contributions to 7 test match wins for India.

He later became the captain of Railways and led them to two major championship titles, the Ranji Trophy and the Irani Trophy victory in 2004–05. He also led the Railways team to a Ranji Trophy One Day National Championship in 2005–06. Along with Vijay Hazare, he is only one of two players to score 6,000 runs and take 200 wickets in the Ranji Trophy. He represented Deccan Chargers in the first IPL season. He played for the Kolkata Knight Riders in the 2009 IPL.

In January 2013, Bangar announced his retirement after 20 years playing. An article by Sanjay Bangar was featured in the 2012 book &quot;Rahul Dravid: Timeless Steel&quot;.

== Coaching career ==
Having previously coached India A, Bangar began working with the Kochi Tuskers as batting coach in 2010. 
In January 2014, Bangar was named assistant coach of Kings XI Punjab ahead of IPL 2014. He was promoted to the role of head coach during the season and coached them to final, the Franchise&#x27;s best IPL performance to date, where they lost to Kolkata Knight Riders. He went on to Coach Kings XI Punjab for three years until he had to give up his role to comply with the BCCI&#x27;s conflict of interest rules.

In August 2014, he was named batting coach of India after an embarrassing Test series defeat to England. He was named head coach of India national cricket team for Zimbabwe tour in June 2016.

After Anil Kumble was appointed as India&#x27;s head coach for a one-year tenure starting with the tour of West Indies in July 2016, Bangar was reappointed as the team&#x27;s batting coach.

Many Indian batsmen, including Indian captain Virat Kohli, Rohit Sharma, KL Rahul and Ajinkya Rahane, have credited Bangar for contributing to their growth.

After Anil Kumble&#x27;s tenure as head coach expired in June 2017, Bangar carried out the role of Interim Coach to India&#x27;s tour of West Indies in June–July 2017. After Ravi Shastri&#x27;s reappointment as head coach, Bangar was promoted to the role of Assistant Coach till 2019. Bangar&#x27;s coaching has been credited for improving India&#x27;s lower order.

Bangar&#x27;s tenure as batting coach saw India create several records, with Indian batsmen scoring over 150 centuries and India winning 30 tests out of 52 tests played, 82 ODIs out of 120 ODIs and the Test team staying at top of ICC Test Rankings for over three and half years during his tenure of over 5 years as coach.

In 2018, India toured South Africa in what was considered a mixed bag, with India losing the test series 1-2 but later winning the ODI series by a record 5–1 margin, a feat not accomplished by any other Indian team. India then lost a closely contested Test Series in England by a margin of 1–4, with India&#x27;s batting and Bangar&#x27;s role came under criticism for unable to chase a 4th innings target of 193 set by England in the first test. However, later India won a historic Test Series in Australia 2–1, thus ending the 2018 season with 4 rare overseas Test victories in South Africa, England, and Australia.

Bangar&#x27;s contract was not renewed by the BCCI on the back of reports that Bangar was not able to find a suitable no 4 batsman in ODI cricket, a reason for India&#x27;s loss in the 2019 World Cup, although it was widely debated that it was the job of the selectors and not the job of the batting coach to do so.
As compared to previous foreign coaches, Bangar&#x27;s performance was notable. Indian batsmen under him scored a total of 150 centuries including 89 overseas centuries, across formats. In February 2021, Bangar was appointed as a Consultant for Royal Challengers Bangalore for the 2021 Indian Premier League where they finished third in the table and qualified for Play offs.

On 9 November 2021, he was named the New Head Coach of Royal Challengers Bangalore for the 2022 Indian Premier League, a season in which RCB gave their best performance since 2016 before losing the Qualifier 2 match to the eventual finalist Rajasthan Royals.

Ahead of IPL 2023, Bangar was appointed Head of Cricket Development at Punjab Kings, with whom he had worked already (when they were Kings XI Punjab).

<text>Glenn Alan Robinson Jr. (born January 10, 1973) is an American former professional basketball player. Nicknamed &quot;Big Dog&quot; and &quot;the Chosen One&quot;, he played in the National Basketball Association (NBA) from 1994 to 2005 for the Milwaukee Bucks, Atlanta Hawks, Philadelphia 76ers, and San Antonio Spurs. Robinson attended Purdue University and was the first overall pick in the 1994 NBA draft. He is the father of Glenn Robinson III, who played college basketball at the University of Michigan and has also played in the NBA.

==Early life==
Robinson was born to Christine Bridgeman in Gary, Indiana. With his mother being an unmarried teenager, Robinson rarely saw his father. Not receiving the best grades at school, his mother once pulled him off the basketball team, and he took a job at an air-conditioning and refrigeration shop.

==High school career==
Robinson attended Theodore Roosevelt High School in Gary, where he started playing organized basketball during the 9th grade. He was a member of three IHSAA Sectional title teams, two Regional title teams and a State Championship team. During his senior season (1990–91), he led the Panthers to an Indiana state basketball championship, winning the final game against Brebeuf Jesuit and their star Alan Henderson; this highly anticipated showdown was captured in &quot;The Road to Indianapolis&quot;. and &quot;Indiana High School Basketball 20 Most Dominant Players&quot;. Robinson won the 1991 Indiana Mr. Basketball award, the oldest such award in the nation (inaugurated in 1939). He was selected as a McDonald&#x27;s All-American and along with Chris Webber was one of the MVPs of the Dapper Dan Roundball classic.

==College career==

===1991–1993===
After high school, Robinson attended Purdue University to play under head coach Gene Keady and his recruiter/assistant coach Frank Kendrick. A school custodian gave him the nickname of &quot;Big Dog&quot; before he played a game for Purdue. Robinson subsequently got a tattoo of a &quot;snarling bulldog wearing a spiked collar&quot; on his chest.

Due to struggles with NCAA eligibility, resulting from Proposition 48 which requires minimum academic standards, he had to redshirt for his freshman season. He worked as a welder during the summers while at Purdue.

Eligible for his sophomore season, Robinson led the Boilermakers with 24.1 points and 9.4 rebounds a game in his first season as a Boilermaker. He led them to an 18–10 record in the regular season and an NCAA tournament appearance. He received First Team All-Big Ten and Second Team All-American honors.

===1993–1994===
In his junior season, Robinson built upon his previous season&#x27;s averages with 30.3 points and 11.2 rebounds a game, while becoming the first player since 1978 to lead the Big Ten Conference in both categories. Along with teammates Cuonzo Martin and Matt Waddell, he led the Boilermakers to a Big Ten Conference Title and an Elite Eight appearance, finishing the season with a 29–5 record and a 3rd overall ranking. In his last college game against a Grant Hill-led Duke team in the NCAA Tournament, Robinson was held to only 13 points, his season low, while suffering from a back strain he sustained against Kansas in the prior game. Leading the nation in scoring and becoming the conference&#x27;s all-time single season points leader with 1,030 points, Robinson was unanimously selected as the Big Ten Conference Player of the Year. He also unanimously received the John R. Wooden Award and Naismith Award, the first national player of the year-honored Boilermaker since John Wooden himself did it in 1932 (who also wore the jersey #13). Robinson also was the recipient for the USBWA College Player of the Year.

===College notes===
Robinson left Purdue after becoming the only Boilermaker to have more than 1,000 points, 500 rebounds, 100 steals, 100 assists and 50 blocked shots in a career during his two seasons at Purdue, along with a school weightlifting record with a 309-pound clean-and-jerk. His 1,030 points during his junior year made him only the 15th player in college history to score 1,000 points in a season. In September 2010, the Big Ten Network named Robinson Icon No. 35 on its list of the biggest icons in Big Ten Conference history.

Purdue&#x27;s campus bookstores sold T-shirts featuring Robinson&#x27;s image and his nickname &quot;Big Dog&quot; before Robinson complained and they discontinued the practice.

==Professional career==

===Milwaukee Bucks (1994–2002)===
Robinson was selected by the Milwaukee Bucks with the first overall pick in the 1994 NBA draft, the first Boilermaker to be selected as the first pick since Joe Barry Carroll in 1980.

At the draft, Robinson wore a gold suit and black alligator slip-ons. Before he could take the court, he and the Bucks became involved in a contract holdout that lasted until the beginning of training camp after it was rumored that he desired a 13-year, $100 million contract. Robinson eventually signed a rookie-record 10-year, $68 million deal that stands as the richest NBA rookie contract, as a salary cap for rookies was implemented the following season. During his first year in the NBA, Robinson was twice named the Schick NBA Rookie of the Month and was named to the NBA All-Rookie First Team after leading all rookies with an average of 21.9 points per game. Robinson finished third in Rookie of the Year voting behind Grant Hill and Jason Kidd, who shared the award, but was named Rookie Of The Year by &quot;Basketball Digest&quot; magazine.

While playing for the Milwaukee Bucks, Robinson recorded some of the best statistical seasons in franchise history. Early in his career, Robinson shared the frontcourt with teammate and All-Star Vin Baker. On December 7, 1996, Robinson scored 44 points on 70% shooting, alongside 7 rebounds and 6 assists, in a 126–118 victory over the Washington Bullets. Despite another strong statistical season from Robinson, the Bucks would again fail make the NBA playoffs.

After several trades, one of which had Baker go to Seattle, Robinson teamed with Ray Allen and Sam Cassell, and helped lead the Bucks to several postseason appearances. On May 11, 1999, Robinson scored 23 points and grabbed 12 rebounds in a narrow 108–107 playoff loss against Reggie Miller and the Indiana Pacers. The underexperienced Bucks (was both Robinson&#x27;s and Allen&#x27;s first postseason appearance) would eventually lose the series. On January 29, 2001, Robinson scored 25 points, grabbed 10 rebounds, and recorded 5 steals in a 99–96 loss against the Minnesota Timberwolves. On February 25, 2001, Robinson scored a career-high 45 points in a 122–95 win against the Golden State Warriors. That season, Robinson and the Bucks would reach the 2001 Eastern Conference Finals, losing to the Philadelphia 76ers in a 7-game series. In the final game of that series, Robinson scored 24 points, grabbed 7 rebounds, and recorded 4 assists in a losing effort. It would be the closest the Bucks would get to the finals until 2019, when another Bucks Forward, Giannis Antetokounmpo, helped end their 18-year conference finals drought.

Robinson was the second place all-time leading scorer in Milwaukee Bucks history, only trailing Kareem Abdul-Jabbar until surpassed by Giannis Antetokounmpo. Robinson averaged at least 20 points per game in seven of his eight seasons in Milwaukee. He made back-to-back NBA All-Star Team appearances in 2000 and 2001.

===Atlanta Hawks (2002–2003)===
Robinson was traded by Milwaukee to the Atlanta Hawks for Toni Kukoč, Leon Smith, and a 2003 first-round pick on August 2, 2002. In Robinson&#x27;s debut as a Hawk in the season opener, he scored 34 points, had 10 rebounds and 8 assists against the New Jersey Nets. During the 2002–03 season, he averaged 20.8 points a game and shot a personal-best 87.6 percent from the free throw line.

===Philadelphia 76ers (2003–2005)===
After a year in Atlanta, he was traded on July 23, 2003, with a 2006 second-round pick to the Philadelphia 76ers in a four-team deal. In his tenth overall and only season playing with the Sixers, Robinson averaged 16.6 points and 1 steal per game as second scoring option to teammate, Allen Iverson. After his year in Philadelphia during the 2003–04 season, Robinson did not play a game for the 76ers in 2004–05, largely due to an injury. On February 24, 2005, he was traded to the New Orleans Hornets in exchange for forwards Rodney Rogers and Jamal Mashburn. Robinson was waived by the team almost immediately and never suited up for them.

===San Antonio Spurs (2005)===
Robinson signed with the San Antonio Spurs on April 4, 2005, to establish an additional veteran shooting presence as the team prepared for the playoffs. As a role player in the 2005 playoffs, Robinson helped the Spurs win the championship. The games in the NBA Finals would be Robinson&#x27;s last in the NBA, capping off his 11-year career with a title.

Robinson was forced to retire due to injuries, particularly to his knees. He finished his career with 14,234 career points, averaging 20.7 points, 6.1 rebounds, 2.7 assists, and 1.2 steals per game, also playing in two league all-star games.

<text>Pennsbury High School is a four-year public high school located in Fairless Hills, Pennsylvania, United States. It is part of Pennsbury School District.

With 2,907 students enrolled for the 2021–2022 school year, Pennsbury High School is the largest high school in Bucks County and the tenth largest high school in the state of Pennsylvania. There are approximately 255 faculty members and staff. It is the only high school in Pennsbury School District, which has a total enrollment of 10,958 students and includes Bucks Technical High School and Intermediate Unit student totals.

Pennsbury had a graduating class of 800 students in 2018, of which 91% were college-bound. The school had seven National Merit Scholarship finalists and one winner.

==History==
===&quot;Wonderland: A Year in the Life of an American High School&quot;===
In 2002, Pennsbury High School&#x27;s prom tradition caught the attention of &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; senior writer Michael Bamberger. After writing an article for the magazine about the 2002 prom, Bamberger went on to write a book, &quot;Wonderland: A Year in the Life of an American High School&quot;, which chronicled the senior year of a group of Pennsbury students. The rights for the book were bought by Paramount, and MTV and Tollin/Robbins Productions were to produce the film, which had tentatively been named &quot;Pennsbury.&quot; In 2004, Mike Tollin and Brian Robbins signed with Walt Disney Studios, leaving the status of the project uncertain.

===School bus accident===
On January 12, 2007, a school bus veered into a group of students as they were leaving school. Seventeen Pennsbury High School students were injured and hospitalized. After the driver placed the bus into gear, the engine began accelerating uncontrollably; it then &quot;jumped a curb outside one of the school buildings, drove over a sidewalk, barreled down an access road, mowed down a fence and slammed head-on into the retaining wall.&quot; The very same bus in this accident had been involved in another accident under the same circumstances (although no students were injured) 10 years earlier. One student&#x27;s leg was crushed and later had to be amputated above the knee. The NTSB announced they had &quot;not found any major mechanical errors with the school bus&quot;. However all charges against the driver were dropped after two more buses of the same make and model crashed after experiencing the same mechanical issue.

==Extracurricular activities==
===Prom===
In 2004, the prom was awarded Best Prom by &quot;Reader&#x27;s Digest&quot; as part of their &quot;America&#x27;s 100 Best&quot; feature. In 2004, singer-songwriter John Mayer performed for a crowd of nearly a thousand students. Various other artists, including Maroon 5 have also performed at previous proms. In 2017, DJ Pauly D from the television program &quot;Jersey Shore made an appearance with Questlove. Pauly D performed again in 2018, preceded by singer and actor Drake Bell, best known for his role as Drake Parker on the Nickelodeon television show &quot;Drake &amp; Josh&quot;. In 2019 Pauly D once again performed and rapper Desiigner made an appearance in front of an excited Pennsbury Prom audience.

The prom is also preceded by a parade of students, typically with extravagant floats or other means of entry to the celebration.

On June 1, 2019, The Pennsbury High School Senior Prom shattered the Guinness World Record for the most lipstick kiss prints on a mural. The 63-foot-long, 11-foot-high 3D mural, which used 41,692 kisses, spelled out &quot;Rock Music&quot; to fit the theme of &quot;Prom to the Music.&quot; The centerpiece of the mural featured an 18-foot guitar. Students and community members created the kiss prints during sporting events, special school events, prom committee meetings, and in their own homes.

=== Instrumental music ===
The Pennsbury School District has been recognized numerous times as one of the &quot;Best Communities For Music Education&quot; over the past 19 years. Some of its more notable ensembles include the Pennsbury High School &quot;Long Orange Line&quot; Marching Band and the Pennsbury Concert Jazz Band.

The marching band has long been internationally recognized as a premier high school marching bands in the United States. The band currently holds the distinction of being the only marching band not affiliated with the Disney brand to have performed at five of the Walt Disney Parks and Resorts. The band has performed across the world with performances on five continents, including Tiananmen Square in Beijing, China, and on the Great Wall of China. In 2008, the band was the featured halftime performer at the International Rugby Tournament, &quot;Hong Kong Sevens,&quot; in Hong Kong, China. Two years later, in 2010, the Long Orange Line traveled to England to perform in the London New Year&#x27;s Day Parade. In 2012, the band traveled south of the equator for the first time to perform in the first &quot;International Festival of Military and Civilian Bands&quot; in Buenos Aires, Argentina. In March 2016, the band traveled to Sydney, Australia, to participate in the Sydney Royal Easter Show. The band appeared in 2018 for the second time in The Tournament of Roses Parade on New Year&#x27;s Day in Pasadena, California. Pennsbury&#x27;s Marching Band has performed as the honor band of the 6abc Dunkin&#x27; Donuts Thanksgiving Day Parade in Philadelphia for the 35 consecutive years (1983–present). The Long Orange Line currently competes in USBands Group 4 A Class competition.

The Concert Jazz Band shares similarly impressive distinctions. The Pennsbury Concert Jazz Band has long been considered one of the finest jazz musical ensembles in the country. It consistently earns the highest rankings at festivals in which it competes. Since its beginnings in 1959, the musicians in this group have performed jazz music at a level not typical of high school-age students.

The band has performed on &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;, at the Montreux Jazz Festival in Switzerland, the Mellon Jazz Festival and the Montreal International Jazz Festival. Guest soloists through the years have included Stan Kenton, Maynard Ferguson, Bill Watrous, Terell Stafford, Carl Allen, Phil Woods, Joe Alessi, Dick Oatts, Wayne Bergeron, and most recently James Morrison and Tom Scott. The Pennsbury Concert Jazz Band was the first American High School Jazz Band (PCJB) to perform throughout China. Grammy Award-winning jazz composers Sammy Nestico, Frank Mantooth, Bob Mintzer and Emmy and Grammy award-winning composer Patrick Williams have composed original charts for the PCJB.

The Pennsbury Instrumental Music Department has consistently sent students to the National Association for Music Education&#x27;s All-American Band, a prestigious honor awarded to only several hundred students throughout the United States each year.

===Athletics===
The Falcons are part of the Suburban One League. Pennsbury football teams went undefeated in 1972 and 1974; won a state championship in 1980, playing in the longest football playoff game in Pennsylvania high school athletics history; and went undefeated again in 1985, when they were ranked by some newsletters as the best high school football team in Pennsylvania.

Pennsbury&#x27;s baseball team won the PIAA 6A State Championship in 2017

In the 2020-2021 season, Pennsbury&#x27;s ice hockey team won its first SHSHL title, going 10-1-1 on the season and defeating Council Rock South 7-4 in the final.

The school&#x27;s ultimate frisbee team has been recognized as one of the top dozen teams in the U.S.

<text>Kåre Nordstoga (born 18 December 1954) is a Norwegian organist.

Nordstoga had his early studies under Harald Aune and Odd Jacob Unhammer in Notodden where he grew up. He went on to study at the Norwegian Academy of Music in Oslo, where his teachers included Kaare Ørnung, Søren Gangfløt, Magne Elvestrand and Bjørn Boysen. Nordstoga has also studied with David Sanger in London.

In 1984 Nordstoga was appointed assistant organist at Oslo Cathedral, and from 1994 he has been principal organist.

His repertoire includes a wide range of organ works, the emphasis being on such Classical masters as Bach, Mozart, Franck, Widor, and Messiaen. Between 1990 and 1992 he gave a series of 30 Saturday recitals where large audiences heard him perform all of Bach&#x27;s organ works, a feat that he repeated within the Bach-year 2000. His concert appearances have also brought him to the majority of European countries.

Nordstoga has made recordings for Simax, Norsk Kulturfond, Aurora, and Afontibus, which he has founded together with violinist Geir Inge Lotsberg.

<text>Television in Australia began experimentally as early as 1929 in Melbourne with radio stations 3DB and 3UZ, and 2UE in Sydney, using the &quot;Radiovision&quot; system by Gilbert Miles and Donald McDonald, and later from other locations, such as Brisbane in 1934.

Mainstream television was launched on 16 September 1956 in Willoughby, New South Wales, with Nine Network station TCN-9 Sydney. The new medium was introduced by advertising executive Bruce Gyngell with the words &quot;Good evening, and welcome to television&quot;, and has since seen the transition to colour and digital television.
Local programs, over the years, have included a broad range of comedy, sport, and in particular drama series, in addition to news and current affairs. The industry is regulated by the Australian Communications and Media Authority, through various legislation, regulations, standards and codes of practice, which also regulates radio and in recent years has attempted to regulate the Internet.

==History==

===Origins: Early transmission trials===
In 1885, Henry Sutton developed a &quot;Telephane&quot; for closed circuit transmission of pictures via telegraph wires, based on the Nipkow spinning disk system, so that the Melbourne Cup could be seen in Ballarat. Reports differ on whether the &quot;Telephane&quot; was successfully implemented.

The first television broadcast in Australia took place on 30 September 1929 at the Menzies Hotel in Melbourne, using the electro-mechanical &quot;Radiovision&quot; system. Other transmissions took place in the city over the next few weeks. Also in 1929, the Baird system was used on 3DB, 3UZ and 2UE.

After 18 months of test transmissions, regular broadcasts began in Brisbane on 6 May 1934 using a 30-line system, to an estimated 18 receivers around Brisbane. The test transmissions, which were of 1-hour duration each day, were made by Thomas M. B. Elliott and Dr Val McDowall from the Wickham Terrace Observatory Tower. The programs included news headlines, still pictures and silent movies such as the temperance film &quot;Horrors of Drink&quot;. The Commonwealth Government granted a special licence and permission to conduct experimental television by VK4CM, in July 1934. By 1935, it expanded to 180 lines. Other experimental transmissions followed in other cities.

===Early demonstrations===
Television commenced in the United States and in the United Kingdom before World War II. The two countries developed radically different industry models, which were based on the models each used for radio broadcasting. British broadcasting was entirely controlled by the government-created broadcasting corporation, the BBC, which derived its revenue from compulsory viewer licence fees. The United States adopted a commercial model, based on privately owned stations and networks that earned revenue by charging for advertising time, with public broadcasting forming only a minor component of the larger system.

In June 1948, the Australian Labor Government under Ben Chifley, opted to follow the British model, on the advice from the Postmaster-General&#x27;s Department. It decided to establish a government-controlled TV station in each capital city and called for tenders for the building of the six TV transmitters. The &quot;Broadcasting Act 1948&quot; specifically prohibited the granting of commercial TV licences, a decision that the Liberal-Country Party opposition criticised as &quot;authoritarian and socialistic&quot;. This policy was never put into practice, however, because the Labor government did not have the opportunity to establish the TV network before it was defeated in December 1949. The incoming Robert Menzies-led Liberal-Country Party coalition, which was to hold power for the next 23 years, changed the industry structure by also permitting the establishment of American-style commercial stations.

The economic situation at the time that TV was established in Australia exerted a pivotal influence on the foundation and subsequent history of the industry. When the decision was made to go ahead with granting the first licences for broadcast TV in the early 1950s, Australia was in a recession, with severe shortages of labour and materials and an underdeveloped heavy industrial base, and in this context TV was seen as a drain away from more fundamental projects.

The Menzies government was concerned about the long-term viability of the new industry and worried that it might be called on to bail out struggling stations and networks if the economy deteriorated. Consequently, it decided to grant the initial commercial TV licences to established print media proprietors, with the expectation that these companies would, if necessary, be able to subsidize the new TV stations from their existing (and highly profitable) press operations.

Meanwhile, in 1949, the first large-scale public demonstrations of the medium took place when the Shell company sponsored a series of closed-circuit broadcasts in capital cities produced by Frank Cave. These broadcasts were elaborate, usually opened by a local politician, and featured many people appearing on camera – singing, playing instruments, and giving demonstrations of cooking, sport, and magic tricks.

Buoyed by the success of these tests, in March 1950, the Astor Radio Corporation embarked upon a tour of 200 regional towns with a mobile broadcast unit, giving a series of 45-minute demonstration programs, allowing local performers and members of the public to appear on camera.

In January 1953, in response to increasing pressure from the commercial lobby, the Menzies government amended the &quot;Broadcasting Act 1948&quot; to allow for the granting of commercial licences, thus providing the legislative framework for a dual system of TV ownership. This structure was directly modeled on the long-established two-tiered structure of Australian broadcast radio—one tier being the stations in a new national, government-funded TV network run by the Australian Broadcasting Commission (ABC), and the other tier being privately owned commercial stations that drew their income from advertising revenue.

Commercial TV licences were nominally overseen by the Australian Broadcasting Control Board (ABCB), a government agency responsible for the regulation of broadcasting standards and practices, while technical standards (such as broadcast frequencies) were administered by the Postmaster-General&#x27;s Department. The ABC, as an independent government authority, was not subject to the regulation of the ABCB and instead answered directly to the Postmaster-General and ultimately to the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (a situation that provoked bitter complaints from commercial radio in the mid-1970s when the ABC established its controversial youth station Double Jay).

In 1954, the Menzies Government formally announced the introduction of the new two-tiered TV system—a government-funded service run by the ABC, and two commercial services in Sydney and Melbourne, with the 1956 Summer Olympics in Melbourne being a major driving force behind the introduction of television to Australia.

TCN-9 Sydney began test transmissions on 16 September 1956 and officially commenced broadcasting on 27 October. HSV7 Melbourne became the first television station to broadcast to viewers in Melbourne on 4 November, soon followed by ABV-2 then GTV9 on 19 January 1957. Sydney station ABN-2 also started broadcasting in November. All of these stations were operational in time for the 1956 Melbourne Summer Olympics opening ceremony, on 22 November 1956. ATN-7 started in December.

An interview with Mrs Edna Everage (a comic creation of performing artist Barry Humphries) was one of the programmes screened on HSV-7&#x27;s first day of programming in 1956. The character went on to great success in the United Kingdom and later, the United States.

Videotape technology was still in its infancy when Australian television was launched in 1956 and video recorders did not become widely available to Australian TV stations until the 1960s. For the first few years, the only available method for capturing TV programs was the kinescope process, in which a fixed movie camera filmed broadcasts screened on a specially adjusted TV monitor. Similarly, the playback of pre-recorded programs to air was only possible at this stage through the telecine process, in which films or kinescoped TV recordings were played back on a movie screen which was monitored by a TV camera.

Because of these limitations, it was relatively difficult and expensive to record and distribute local programming, so the majority of locally produced content was broadcast live-to-air. Very little local programming from these first few years of Australian TV broadcasting was recorded and in the intervening years, the majority of that material has since been lost or destroyed. Even the footage of the &#x27;first&#x27; Australian TV broadcast with Bruce Gyngell on Channel 9, Sydney (see image above) is a fabrication—according to Gerald Stone the kinescope film of the actual September 1956 broadcast was lost and the footage that exists today is a considerably more polished re-enactment, made a year later.

Most programs in this early period were based on popular radio formats—musical variety and quiz formats were the most popular.

In the first decade after the first TV licences were granted, the federal government and the ABCB did not act to enforce local content quotas, and such measures were resisted by the commercial sector. As a result, Australian TV was soon dominated by material imported from the United States and (to a far smaller extent) Great Britain. In this period nearly every TV drama screened in Australia came from the US and the few programs that were made locally were almost all produced by the ABC. In other formats, the few locally produced programs made by or for commercial stations were typically low-cost copies of proven American talk/variety or quiz show formats. By the early 1960s, at least 80% of all Australian TV content was sourced from the US and not surprisingly American programs consistently topped the ratings.

These changes led to a significant concentration of cross-media ownership. By 1960, the Packer family&#x27;s Consolidated Press group controlled Channels 9 in Melbourne and Sydney (the flagship stations that formed the basis of the Nine Network), Melbourne&#x27;s Herald and Weekly Times group owned HSV-7, and the Fairfax newspaper group controlled ATN-7 in Sydney. In the view of some media historians, these arrangements established a pattern of &quot;high-level political allegiances between commercial broadcasters and Liberal-National Party governments&quot; and that, as a result, the ABCB &quot;was left very weak and uncertain in its capacity to control broadcaster conduct and exhibited strong symptoms of &quot;regulatory capture&quot;, or over-identification with the industry it regulated&quot;.

In 1963, the Senate Select Committee on the Encouragement of Australian Productions for Television, chaired by Senator Seddon Vincent (known as the Vincent Committee) presented its report to federal parliament and its findings painted a bleak picture for local producers—the Committee found that 97% percent of all television drama shown on Australian TV between 1956 and 1963 was imported from the United States, and it criticised the ABCB for failing to use its powers to enforce local content standards on television broadcasters, particularly the commercial stations. The Vincent Report recommended a sweeping program of reforms but none were implemented by the Menzies Government at that time.

The advent of TV effectively destroyed Australia&#x27;s once thriving radio production industry within a few years, and the absence of local production quotas for TV in this formative period compounded the problem. Faced with almost unbeatable competition from American-made programming, local technical and creative professionals in radio were unable to make the transition to the new medium, as many of their American and British counterparts had done when TV was introduced there.

Those Australian producers who did try to break into TV faced almost insurmountable challenges. Imported American and British programs benefited from high budgets, an international talent pool, and huge economies of scale, thanks to their very large domestic markets (relative to Australia), established worldwide distribution networks; additionally, since most American production houses and networks were based in Los Angeles, they had access to resources and expertise built up over decades by the Hollywood movie studios. These disadvantages were further exacerbated by the fact that American producers and networks offered Australian channels significant discount rates on bundled programming. Taken as a whole, these factors meant that local producers were faced with a relative production-cost ratio on the order of 10:1 or more in favour of the imported product.

Some sense of the scale of this &quot;resource gap&quot; can be gained by comparing the budgets of contemporary American and Australian TV programs. The pilot of the 1967 satirical sketch comedy series &quot;Laugh-In&quot; reportedly cost about US$200,000. At the top end of the scale, in 1966 Desilu Studios spent almost US$1 million on the two pilot episodes for the science fiction series &quot;Star Trek&quot; – the first pilot &quot;The Cage&quot; (which was rejected by NBC) cost more than US$600,000 and the set for the bridge of the &quot;Enterprise&quot; alone reportedly cost US$60,000; the second pilot, &quot;Where No Man Has Gone Before&quot; cost around US$300,000.

By comparison, the budget for the pilot episode of the 1964 Australian topical revue series &quot;The Mavis Bramston Show&quot; was just AU£1500. Adjusted for inflation, this was around A$3500 in 1967 figures; given that US–Australian dollar exchange rate in 1967 was A$1.00 = US$1.12, this still would have only equated to around US$4,000—50 times less than &quot;Laugh-In&quot;.

Although by the end of the 1950s television had expanded to also include Brisbane, Adelaide and Perth, it was estimated that in 1956 less than 5% of the residents in Melbourne, and fewer than 1% in Sydney, owned a television set, which at the time cost, on average, six to ten weeks&#x27; wages. During these early years, broadcast days were very short—all stations including the ABC-only broadcast programs for a few hours each day and broadcast the test pattern for the rest of the time they were on air. Broadcast times were gradually increased over succeeding decades, although ABC did not commence 24-hour broadcasting until 1993.

===Early programmes===
The TV series &quot;The Adventures of Long John Silver&quot; was made in the Pagewood Studios, Sydney, for the American and British market; it was shown on the ABC in 1958. Local content was limited to talk shows, variety shows, and news &amp; current affairs. Notable programs of the 1950s included TCN-9&#x27;s long-running music variety program &quot;Bandstand&quot;, (based on the US version of the same name) hosted by radio presenter and future newsreader Brian Henderson; HSV-7&#x27;s weekly sport program, (that would broadcast for the next 28 years) &quot;World of Sport&quot;; and the shorter-lived programs, including the ABC&#x27;s &quot;Six O&#x27;Clock Rock&quot;, hosted by Johnny O&#x27;Keefe. The first Australian serial drama, &quot;Autumn Affair&quot;, ran for a 10-month run on ATN-7. Programming also covered religion; for example, &quot;Discovering the Bible&quot;. Several programs in the 1950s were simply adaptations of already established radio programs such as &quot;Pick a Box&quot;.

===Television and programming in the 1960s===
The 1960s saw the continued growth of television in Australia, particularly into regional areas. The first regional TV services began in Victoria in 1961 with the first being Gippsland&#x27;s GLV-10 followed by Shepparton&#x27;s GMV-6 and Bendigo&#x27;s BCV-8. NBN-3 in Newcastle was the first regional service in New South Wales commencing broadcast in 1962.

While the first television services were being established in regional areas, larger cities including Melbourne, Sydney, Brisbane, Adelaide, and Perth began to receive their second and, in the mid-1960s, third stations. In order to reduce costs, networks began to merge – originally in 1957 between HSV-7 and TCN-9, but later between almost all the metropolitan stations of a certain frequency. This led to the formation of the National Television Network (forerunner to the Nine Network) and Australian Television Network (later known as the Seven Network) in 1962. Not all stations became a part of their respective networks – TVW-7 in Perth remained independent for a number of years as the sole commercial station in the city. Throughout the decade the ABC expanded transmissions to several major centres including Adelaide, Perth, Hobart, and Canberra.

Beginning in 1964, the federal government tried to address concerns about competition and local production by licensing a third station in major cities, beginning with Channel 0 in Melbourne and Channel 10 in Sydney. More third-licence stations were established in other capitals and regional cities over the next few years and by the late Sixties these stations joined forces to create Australia&#x27;s third commercial network, originally known as the Independent Television System (ITS), then later changed to the 0–10 Network, and now called Network 10.

Channel 0 in Melbourne took an early lead in catering to teenage viewers and quickly became the preeminent network in pop music programming, commissioning a sequence of popular and influential local pop shows including &quot;The Go!! Show&quot; and &quot;Kommotion&quot; (1964–1967), &quot;Uptight&quot; (1968–70) and &quot;Happening &#x27;70&quot; and its successors (1970–1972).

The establishment of the Sydney–Melbourne co-axial cable link between Sydney and Melbourne in 1962 marked the first step in the establishment of effective national networking for Australian TV stations. The cable-supported the simultaneous live broadcast of the 5th test of the 1962–63 Ashes series to Sydney, Canberra, and Melbourne – a major milestone in Australian television history.

The introduction of satellite broadcasting in the late 1960s allowed news stories and programs to be accessed from around the world. The first live satellite transmission occurred between Australia and the United Kingdom in 1966. The first direct telecast across the Pacific from North America to Australia took place on 6 June 1967 when &quot;Australia Day&quot; at Expo 67 in Montreal was broadcast live to Australia via a US satellite link. Prime Minister Harold Holt officially opened the Australian pavilion and visitors watched events including boomerang throwing, sheep-dog trials, wood chopping contests and tennis matches with members of the Australian Davis Cup team.

In the afternoon a variety concert, &#x27;Pop goes Australia&#x27;, featured musicians Normie Rowe, Bobby Limb, Rolf Harris and The Seekers. The entire 10-hour program was televised live and several hundred thousand people across Australia sat up through the night to watch it. One newspaper reported that the picture was so clear that hundreds of viewers rang a Sydney television station to seek assurance that the pictures really were being broadcast live from Canada.

Two weeks later, on 25 June 1967, Australia participated in the historic &quot;Our World&quot; broadcast, the first live global satellite television hookup involving fourteen countries. The event is now chiefly remembered for the participation of The Beatles, who performed their new song &quot;All You Need Is Love&quot; live from the Abbey Road Studios in London. Australia&#x27;s contribution showed a Melbourne tram leaving the depot for its early morning run, which caused some controversy as people felt that it was not a very exciting image of Australia. By 1970 as many as thirty-one programs were received via this manner. GTV-9 in Melbourne broke records in 1969 for the world&#x27;s longest scheduled live telecast with its coverage of the Apollo 11 Moon landing, running for 163 hours, a record which has since been beaten.

Even though the dominance of imported American and British programming continued, local production gradually increased in the 1960s and several important new Australian programs were launched. Crawford Productions&#x27; Melbourne-based police drama &quot;Homicide&quot; premiered on 20 October 1964 on HSV-7, soon followed on 11 November by the ATN-7 satirical sketch comedy series &quot;The Mavis Bramston Show&quot; (which at its peak drew an unprecedented 59% of the audience), the rural soap opera &quot;Bellbird&quot; on the ABC (1967), and for interstate viewers Graham Kennedy&#x27;s &quot;In Melbourne Tonight&quot; or the &quot;Graham Kennedy Channel Nine Show&quot;. In addition to these, many programs still seen today were launched at this time including the ABC&#x27;s acclaimed current affairs program &quot;Four Corners&quot; (1961) and &quot;Play School&quot; – now the country&#x27;s longest-running children&#x27;s show—as well as the Nine Network&#x27;s &quot;Here&#x27;s Humphrey&quot;, which both premiered in 1966.

Veteran actor-producer John McCallum and filmmaker Lee Robinson created the children&#x27;s adventure series &quot;Skippy the Bush Kangaroo&quot; which premiered in 1968 on the Nine Network. At a reported cost of A$6000 per episode it was said to have been the most expensive Australian TV series yet produced up to that time (by comparison, the first series of &quot;Star Trek&quot; reportedly cost around US$200,000 per episode). Although Australian TV was still in black-and-white at the time, &quot;Skippy&quot; was filmed in colour with a view to overseas sales and it was the first Australian-made series to achieve significant international success, with sales to more than 80 countries worldwide, and it became the first Australian TV show to be widely screened in the USA.

Winners of the first nationally shown &quot;TV Week&quot; Logie Awards included &quot;In Melbourne Tonight&quot; host Graham Kennedy – twice, &quot;Pick-a-box&quot; host Bob Dyer, Lorrae Desmond from ABC&#x27;s &quot;The Lorrae Desmond Show&quot;, &quot;Four Corners&quot; reporter Michael Charlton, Bobby Limb, Jimmy Hannan, Gordon Chater, Brian Henderson and Hazel Phillips.

Numerous television stations were launched, mainly concentrated around the southern and eastern parts of the country. By the turn of the decade, the takeup of television had increased dramatically – by 1960 up to 70% of homes in Sydney and Melbourne had a television set. Following its introduction to regional centres and other capital cities through the late 1950s and 1960s over 90% of Australian homes in established markets had a television set. The new medium had also become highly lucrative to advertisers.

In 1967 the NSWRFL grand final became the first football grand final of any code to be televised live in Australia. The Nine Network had paid $5,000 for the broadcasting rights. That same year, ATV-0 telecast the Pakenham races in colour under the supervision of the Broadcasting Control Board.

The first fully equipped – permanent – colour studios and post-production facilities were set up in 1969 at Video Tape Corporation in Sydney (VTC), by executives that decamped from TEN. Although the output was hobbled to monochrome until 1974, many original long and short-form productions were completed over the years until its closure and eventual absorption into other companies in the late 1980s.

Test broadcasting of colour began in the late 1960s. The full changeover to colour transmission did not occur until 1975.

===Television and programming in the 1970s===
Following the new medium&#x27;s establishment in most major metropolitan and regional centres, television continued to expand to remote areas, most notably those in the northern and western parts of Australia – Darwin, for example, did not receive television until ABD-6 and NTD-8 launched in 1971. Similarly, VEW-8 launched in Kalgoorlie on 18 June 1971, and ITQ-8 launched in Mount Isa on 11 September 1971. The youngest network, the 0/10 Network, as it was then known, launched the controversial sex-melodrama serial &quot;Number 96&quot; in March 1972. The success of this program led to this third network becoming commercially viable.

In 1969, a group of ex-network executives pooled together to create Video-Tape Corporation (VTC) in East Roseville. This was to be the first end-to-end &#x27;fully electronic&#x27; (no film) colour video facility in the region, intended to be up and running with studios, audio, OB and post-production facilities to feed the emerging colour broadcast industry. To accommodate producers and film aesthetics, VTC also installed comprehensive &#x27;film-to-tape&#x27; (telecine) capabilities as they grew. However the networks and government were locked in their own battles, and despite being ready for full-colour operation from around 1971, VTC was hobbled until 1973–74 before the content would ever reach &quot;the masses&quot;. Around that same time, Royce Smeale/ECV arrived to offer a complementary service with more emphasis on production and OB services.

In 1972 it was announced that all stations would move to colour on 1 March 1975, using the European PAL standard mandated in 1968. The slogan used to sell colour television to the Australian public was &#x27;March first into colour&#x27;. Australia was to have one of the fastest change-overs to colour television in the world – by 1978 over 64% of households in Sydney and Melbourne had colour television sets.

Government subsidies provided for the production of local series led to a boom in Australian-produced content. Some of the most popular series included Crawford Productions police dramas &quot;Homicide&quot;, &quot;Division 4&quot; which started during the 1960s and &quot;Matlock Police&quot; which began in 1971; variety series &quot;Young Talent Time&quot;; comedy/variety series &quot;Hey Hey It&#x27;s Saturday&quot;, which ran for 28 years until 1999, music show &quot;Countdown&quot;; soap operas &quot;Bellbird&quot; which had started in late 1967, &quot;Number 96&quot; and &quot;The Box&quot;, and the World War II-themed &quot;The Sullivans&quot;. &quot;Against the Wind&quot;, the first major mini-series produced for commercial television, was shown on the Seven Network. Later hospital drama &quot;The Young Doctors&quot; ran for 1396 episodes between 1976 and 1983, becoming at the time it ended Australia&#x27;s longest-running drama series.

Graham Kennedy returned to the Nine Network after his departure from &quot;In Melbourne Tonight&quot; with &quot;The Graham Kennedy Show&quot; in 1973, but was banned from appearing on television in 1975 after an infamous &#x27;crow-call&#x27; incident. Kennedy subsequently returned in 1977 as the host of &quot;Blankety Blanks&quot;. In 1979, commercial stations were mandated to provide &#x27;C&#x27;-classified programming targeted at children between 4-5pm, and a minimum of 30 minutes of pre-school programming prior to that. These regulations saw the establishment of a number of children&#x27;s series including &quot;Simon Townsend&#x27;s Wonder World&quot; and &quot;Shirl&#x27;s Neighbourhood&quot;.

News and current affairs, particularly on commercial television, grew significantly – the Nine Network&#x27;s &quot;A Current Affair&quot;, hosted by Mike Willesee began in November 1971, while &quot;60 Minutes&quot;, on the same network, began in 1979. In March 1972, Brisbane station BTQ-7 claimed the first one-hour newscast in Australia. The one-hour newscast format was also later adopted by regional station NBN, Newcastle, and capital city television stations TEN-10 Sydney and ATV-0 Melbourne.

A special Gold Logie Award was awarded to the Apollo 11 crew in 1970, alongside actors Barry Crocker and Maggie Tabberer. Other Gold Logie winners included Gerard Kennedy, Tony Barber, Graham Kennedy, Pat McDonald, Ernie Sigley and Denise Drysdale in the first awards presentation shown in colour, Don Lane, Jeanne Little, and Bert Newton.

Sports broadcasting became increasingly sophisticated through the 1970s. ABC, the Seven Network and the Nine Network joined to broadcast the 1976 Olympic Games in Montreal, with the opening and closing ceremonies telecast live, and highlights packages shown each night. During November of the same year, RTS-5a commenced transmissions in Riverland, with GTW-11 launching in Geraldton on 21 January 1977.

In 1977 the Victorian Football League Grand Final was shown live to Melbourne viewers for the first time. As with the Olympics, the 1978 Commonwealth Games in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada were shown in the form of highlights packages on ABC TV.

The Special Broadcasting Service, originally a group of radio stations broadcasting government information to ethnic minorities in Sydney and Melbourne, began test transmissions on ABC in the two cities – mainly showing foreign-language programming on Sunday mornings.

===Television and programming in the 1980s===

The country&#x27;s second national public broadcaster, the Special Broadcasting Service, launched Channel 0/28 in Sydney and Melbourne in October 1980. The new station, aimed at Australia&#x27;s growing multicultural population, placed a much heavier emphasis on subtitled or foreign-language content. The network expanded to cover Canberra and Goulburn in 1983, followed by Brisbane, Adelaide, Newcastle, Wollongong and the Gold Coast in June 1985. It is now available in most areas.

Although Australia had seen the introduction of the satellite in the 1960s, 1986 saw the introduction of a new, domestic satellite called AUSSAT. The Australian Broadcasting Corporation and other commercial broadcasters were able to broadcast to the more remote areas of Australia without needing to set up a new station, and by the end of 1986 the Australian Broadcasting Corporation were broadcasting both television and radio to remote areas of Australia. By 1980, commercial television in Australia accounted for 33% of all mainstream advertising; this was a significant rise from the introduction of television in 1960 when it was accountable for only 15% of advertising revenue.

The newly relaunched Network 10, with Rupert Murdoch controlling the flagship stations TEN-10 and ATV-10, aggressively challenged the long-held dominance of the Seven and Nine networks with the commissioning of several large-budget mini-series, many produced by the Kennedy-Miller partnership; the expansion of news and current affairs coverage; securing the exclusive Australian television rights to the 1984 and 1988 Summer Olympic Games; and a strong line-up of Hollywood blockbuster movies and mini-series. The 1980s were a huge step up for the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, sealing the contracts for both &quot;Live Aid&quot; and the 1986 Commonwealth Games, live from Edinburgh.

In 1983 a two-hour experiment was conducted, in which the Seven Network televised a series of 3D films.

The Australian soap opera &quot;Neighbours&quot; was first broadcast on the Seven Network on 18 March 1985. The show&#x27;s storylines concern the domestic and professional lives of the people who live and work in the fictional suburb of Erinsborough, Melbourne. Seven decided to commission the show following the success of Watson&#x27;s other soap opera, &quot;Sons and Daughters&quot;. &quot;Neighbours&quot; underperformed in the Sydney market and it struggled for four months before Seven cancelled it. The show was immediately bought by rival network, Ten. Ten began screening &quot;Neighbours&quot; on 20 January 1986. &quot;Neighbours&quot; has since become the longest-running series in Australian television and attained great success in the United Kingdom and launched the careers of several international stars, including Kylie Minogue, Guy Pearce, Russell Crowe, Natalie Imbruglia and Margot Robbie to name a few.

The soap opera &quot;Home and Away&quot; has been produced in Sydney by the Seven Network since July 1987. It premiered in January 1988 and is the second longest-running drama on Australian television, winning more than 30 Logie Awards. The show initially focused on the characters of Pippa and Tom Fletcher who ran the Summer Bay Caravan Park and lived there with a succession of foster children, most notably their adopted daughter Sally, played by Kate Ritchie. Other notable actors who have starred in the series include Heath Ledger, Julian McMahon and Naomi Watts.

The late 1980s saw the ownership changeover for many commercial and regional stations. Six main ownership groups emerged, three for commercial broadcasters and three for regional broadcasters This was the beginning of aggregation for Australian television.

===Television and programming in the 1990s===
The 1990s saw a boom in Australian-made drama, which included &quot;Halifax f.p.&quot;, &quot;Stingers&quot;, &quot;Water Rats&quot;, &quot;SeaChange&quot;, &quot;All Saints&quot;, and the long running police drama &quot;Blue Heelers&quot; which ran from 1993 to 2006, one of the longest running Australian programs, equaling &quot;Homicide&#x27;s&quot; record of 510 episodes; a record set two decades earlier. A number of successful comedy programs also aired during the 1990s, including &quot;Fast Forward&quot;, &quot;Full Frontal&quot;, &quot;The Late Show&quot; and &quot;Good News Week&quot;. &quot;Hey Hey It&#x27;s Saturday&quot; ended its 28-year run in November 1999. One of the most significant developments in terms of high-quality Australian programming was the establishment by the Federal Government of the Commercial Television Production Fund.

One of the most significant changes for regional television in Australia began in the 1990s with the introduction of &quot;aggregation&quot;. Instead of being covered by a single commercial channel, regional license areas would combine to provide two or three stations in line with metropolitan areas. As a result, most regional areas went from one to three channels, although some, particularly outside eastern states New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland, remained with two or even only one commercial station.

The first license area to aggregate was that of southern New South Wales, on 31 March 1989, followed by Queensland on 31 December 1990, northern New South Wales on 31 December 1991, Victoria on 1 January 1992, and Tasmania in 1994 (two stations only). Some areas too small to be properly aggregated, such as Darwin, Mildura or rural South Australia, however, either applied for a second license or introduced a supplementary second service run by the existing local station. Following aggregation in 1995, Sunshine Television was purchased by Seven Network Limited.

Community television was introduced to Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Adelaide and Perth in 1994. The stations, which all broadcast on channel 31, were allocated long-term temporary licences until new legislation introduced in 1997 permitted permanent licences to be granted. Briz 31 was the first community television station to launch in Australia, on 31 July 1994. C31 Melbourne and Access 31 in Perth followed in 1994 and 1999 respectively, along with a number of other stations in some capital and regional cities. The most recent to launch was Sydney&#x27;s TVS. Throughout the early 1990s, SBS TV coverage continued to expand to include the Latrobe Valley, Spencer Gulf, Darwin, northeast Tasmania, Cairns and Townsville.

During the 1990s the first subscription television services were introduced to Australia. The first license was issued to Galaxy Television, which started in 1993, providing services to most metropolitan areas by 1995. Other major providers include Foxtel, Optus Television, and AUSTAR, all of which were introduced in 1995.

Subscription television allowed customers to have access to more channels. For example, PSN (later Fox Sports) was launched in 1995 and ESPN in 1996, featuring Super 12 (rugby union), NFL (American football) and NBA (basketball).

The advent of pay television in Australia resulted in the Super League war which was fought in and out of court during the mid-1990s by the News Ltd-backed Super League and Kerry Packer-backed Australian Rugby League organisations over broadcasting rights, and ultimately control of the top-level professional rugby league football competition of Australasia. This resulted in the greatest and most costly set-piece confrontation to shake the corporate landscape of Australia.

Galaxy folded in 1998 and was subsequently absorbed by Foxtel. Despite recent growth, subscription television in Australia still has relatively few subscribers.

=== Television and programming in the 2000s ===
The 2000 Summer Olympics resulted in huge ratings for its broadcaster (the event was hosted in Sydney) for the Seven Network – over 6.5 million Australians watched the telecast of opening and closing ceremonies, which were amongst the most-watched programs in television history and helped Seven defeat the Nine Network in ratings terms for the first time in more than two decades. The broadcast also ran on the short-lived C7 Sport subscription channel. The Dream with Roy and HG was a sports/comedy talk show, broadcast every night during the Sydney 2000 (and subsequent Salt Lake 2002 and Athens 2004 Olympics) presented by Australian comedy duo Roy and HG which achieved great popularity during the Games.

The turn of the millennium introduced digital television to Australia, as well as the transition to widescreen standard-definition and high-definition television production. Community stations also began to receive permanent transmitter licences, replacing temporary licences that were renewed yearly. At this time it was thought that allowing Commercial Multicasting would be detrimental so the publicly owned networks (ABC and SBS) were the only networks that were allowed to create new digital SD Channels. This was only revised after Digital Television Uptake was not as high as expected in many areas, and from 1 January 2009, Network 10, Nine and Seven were allowed to create alternative SD channels.

Many successful Australian shows were created during the 2000s, including ABC comedies like &quot;Kath &amp; Kim&quot;, &quot;CNNNN&quot;, &quot;Summer Heights High&quot;, &quot;Spicks and Specks&quot; and &quot;The Chaser&#x27;s War on Everything&quot;, Network 10&#x27;s &quot;Skithouse&quot;, &quot;Russell Coight&#x27;s All Aussie Adventures&quot;, &quot;Thank God You&#x27;re Here&quot;, &quot;H2O: Just Add Water&quot; &amp; &quot;The Secret Life of Us&quot;, which led to the creation of many local versions throughout the world, and the growth of reality television, especially &quot;Big Brother Australia&quot; and &quot;Australian Idol&quot;. Australian content on subscription television also grew, with shows such as the Logie Award winning &quot;Love My Way&quot;. &quot;Enough Rope with Andrew Denton&quot;, a television interview show broadcast on ABC, aired from 2003 to 2008.

Amongst the new digital &#x27;multichannels&#x27;, one of the earliest was the SBS World News Channel in 2002, providing news bulletins in languages other than English. In 2003 Tasmanian Digital Television launched, providing Tasmanian viewers a third commercial station, and nationally available stations Fly TV and the ABC Kids launched, later to be eventually shut down due to funding issues and replaced in 2005 by ABC TV Plus. Mildura Digital Television, similar to TDT, launched at the start of 2006. Sydney also began testing datacasting transmissions with Digital 44 in 2003. While digital television boomed in areas that received a third channel and with the subscription television services, growth in other areas has been slow, with analogue shut-down dates pushed back several times. A number of new community stations were also opened, including C31 Adelaide in April 2004 and Television Sydney in February 2006.

In October 2005, Network 10 announced that the morning show entitled &quot;Good Morning Australia&quot; would be cancelled at the end of the year, after a 14-year run. Although Bert Newton was offered ongoing employment at Network 10, he joined the Nine Network to host the short-lived game show &quot;Bert&#x27;s Family Feud&quot;, until 23 May 2007 when the program was axed.

The Nine Network, the traditional ratings leader, suffered ratings losses by the mid-2000s, losing out to the Seven Network, which became the most popular Australian network by early 2007, thanks to its &quot;Seven in &#x27;07&quot; campaign. This was not the only loss by the network: the death of its CEO Kerry Packer in late 2005 led to network personality Eddie McGuire becoming the head of the network, and the network lost AFL broadcast rights to the Seven and Ten networks in the largest Australian television rights deal in history, worth A$780 million. In mid-2007, National Indigenous Television launched as Australia&#x27;s &#x27;third public broadcaster&#x27;, after the ABC and SBS, replacing Indigenous Community Television on the Optus Aurora remote satellite service.

====High-definition TV====
The move to high-definition television broadcasting came to the forefront when Network 10 announced its intentions to create the first dedicated HD multichannel 10 HD on 14 September 2007 with a December 2007 Launch date.

Although 10 HD was initially expected to be the first new commercial television channel in metropolitan areas of Australia since 1988, it was instead beaten to the punch by 7HD. Following the announcement by the Ten Network, Network Seven also announced its previously hidden plans to launch a dedicated HD channel on 15 September 2007 and pushed the launch date forward to 10 October. 7HD was the first dedicated HD multichannel launched, 2 months earlier than the Channel 10 equivalent. The Nine Network&#x27;s move to a HD channel was considered sluggish by industry insiders, taking until March 2008. The Network was more excited by its plans to introduce a new SD channel in 2009 called 9Go!, which is when digital multicasting restrictions were scheduled to be lifted from the commercial stations. 9Go! was released to the public on 9 August, spelling the end of 9HD which was replaced by the previous HD version of Nine.

2009 also saw the launch of four other channels, 7two, a general entertainment channel, SBS Viceland available in SD, ABC Me, a dedicated children&#x27;s television channel available in SD, and 10 Bold, a dedicated 24-hour sport channel and a subsidiary of Network 10 available in both HD and SD, replacing Ten HD. ABC Me, unlike commercial channels, is not constrained by local content quotas.

===Television and programming in the 2010s===
In the early stages of the 2010s, several governmental analysts observed that commercial networks were having trouble making the transition to digital television and subsequently, a $250m rebate was implemented on their licensing fees. The government-funded stations, ABC and SBS, received increased funding in the closing stages of the 2000s to enable them to make the transition to digital TV. Meanwhile, the community station C31 received no government assistance or funding to make the transition; this still remains a source of controversy.

Other issues were noted such as the increased cost of producing local content on commercial networks. For example: it costs roughly $800,000 to produce one hour of local content such as &quot;Underbelly&quot; and &quot;Packed to the Rafters&quot;, in comparison to a mere $100,000 to purchase one hour of the US produced &quot;Two and a Half Men,&quot; the former example screening very often during the off ratings period 2009–10. The cost disparity has led many to question the viability of commercial networks in the future of delivering and investing in locally produced content and has also brought their financial arrangements with business and industry groups into question. Meanwhile, ABC and SBS quickly began producing very successful local content with shows such as &quot;Review&quot;, &quot;Lawrence Leung&#x27;s Choose Your Own Adventure&quot;, &quot;Hungry Beast&quot; and many more publicly funded local programs, produced in Australia, with Australian cast and crews, adding to the increasing health of Australian film and television industries.

During January 2010, the ABC announced its long-awaited 24-hour news channel, ABC News to launch in July 2010. It will broadcast on the current ABC HD channel and according to the ABC, &quot;Australia&#x27;s first free-to-air 24-hour television news channel&quot;. Following technical issues at ABC&#x27;s new playout facility MediaHub, the &quot;ABC News&quot; launch date was pushed to 22 July 2010. &quot;ABC News&quot; began to broadcast a three-minute loop promo on Channel 24 on 6 July 2010.

On 19 August 2010, the Seven Network announced their third digital channel, 7mate, which replaced 7HD. 7mate is aimed at males between 16 and 49, and launched with the AFL Grand Final on 25 September. The Nine Network has also launched a third digital channel called 9Gem, broadcasting only in HD and replacing 9HD. 9Gem is targeted at middle-aged women. On 26 August, Network 10 announced their plans for a channel to replace One SD. The new channel, 10 Peach, is aimed at a youth audience and carries flagship TEN programming including Neighbours. Eleven launched on 11 January 2011.

In 2011, the Seven Network created history by winning all 40 weeks of a television ratings season for the first time since OzTAM was established in 2001.

On 12 December 2012, NITV started its free-to-air broadcasts under new ownership of SBS.

On 10 December 2013, the analogue TV shutdown completed all around Australia.

On 19 August 2015, then Communications Minister Malcolm Turnbull introduced a bill retracting the legal obligation for broadcasters to broadcast their primary channel in standard definition.

On 29 August 2015, Racing.com was launched owned by Racing Victoria and Seven West Media.

In October 2015, the Nine Network announced their fourth digital channel, 9Life. Launching on 26 November, 9Life is a dedicated lifestyle and reality channel on Channel 94. Around the same time, 9HD was relaunched on Channel 90.

On 28 February 2016, the Seven Network launched a fifth digital channel, 7flix, which is a dedicated movie and entertainment channel on Channel 76.

On 2 March 2016, Network 10 relaunched 10 HD on Channel 13.

On 10 May 2016, the Seven Network relaunched 7HD in Melbourne and Adelaide on Channel 70. On 16 December of the same year, it was relaunched on the same channel in Sydney, Brisbane and Perth.

===Television and programming in the 2020s===

With the rapid spread of COVID-19 in the early months of 2020, television production in Australia (as it did worldwide) suffered greatly due to health requirements; many programs such as &quot;Neighbours&quot; and &quot;Home and Away&quot; were forced to suspend filming in an effort to keep their respective cast and crews safe from infection. From the first (of many) &#x27;health lockdowns&#x27; until the later months of 2021, many studios were closed or reorganised to suit the legal requirements for spread prevention. As vaccination rates against the virus increased, many of the studios began to reopen and production rates have increased, with &quot;Neighbours&quot; and &quot;Home and Away&quot; restarting production in October/November 2021.

==Broadcasting==
Television broadcasting in Australia is currently available as digital, colour television, via a range of means including terrestrial, satellite, and cable television services. Both free-to-air and subscription channels/networks are available. Analogue television has been phased out, with the last service being switched off in December 2013.

In most areas, there is a choice of three free-to-air commercial broadcasters as well as two national public broadcasters, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation and the Special Broadcasting Service. A third, recently established, National Indigenous Television service is available in many remote areas.

Commercial television is dominated by three major metropolitan-based networks, the Seven Network, Network 10, which own stations in Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Adelaide, Perth, and the Nine Network which owns stations in Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Darwin, Adelaide and Perth. In addition to its metropolitan assets, Seven owns regional stations in New South Wales, Victoria, Western Australia, the ACT and Queensland and Nine owns and operates its regional station NBN in Northern NSW and the Gold Coast.

Regional television in Australia consists of independently owned networks &#x27;affiliated&#x27; to metropolitan stations. WIN Television is the country&#x27;s largest regional broadcaster in terms of population reach, followed by Southern Cross Austereo and Imparja Television. Some regional centres have three commercial broadcasters, while others — such as regional Western Australia and remote central &amp; eastern Australia — have two, and others — such as Mount Gambier and Broken Hill — have only one commercial broadcaster. In two-broadcaster markets, the two incumbent commercial broadcasters applied for and were granted a third, digital-only license. In single-broadcaster markets, each incumbent commercial broadcaster was granted a second, and later a third license, to provide additional programming. This has resulted in the establishment of a number of channels including Tasmanian Digital Television, Mildura Digital Television, Darwin Digital Television and West Digital Television.

Subscription television in Australia is provided in most areas by Foxtel with Optus Television also serving Sydney, Melbourne, and Brisbane. A number of smaller operators including SelecTV, TransACT, UBI World TV, and Neighbourhood Cable provide niche or local services. Most operators provide the same or similar channels. There are few genuine local channels and few independent channels. One exception is the World Movies channel owned by a consortium including SBS Television and companies owned by Kerry Stokes and the Australian Radio Network.

Community television progressively launched between the 1980s to the 2000s. The sector is represented nationally by the Community Broadcasting Association of Australia. Community stations include TVS, C31 Melbourne, 31 Brisbane, C31 Adelaide and Access 31; many recognisable mainstream personalities originated from community television, including Rove McManus and Wil Anderson and Kayne Tremills

==Cable television==

Cable television has been available in Australia since the mid-1990s, with Galaxy TV being the first. It became insolvent in 1998, due to decreasing popularity after the launch of Foxtel and Austar in May 1995, two cable services that offered more variety than Galaxy TV. Foxtel commenced by supplying programs to Galaxy&#x27;s subscribers on an interim basis. In 1999 Foxtel was able to significantly boost its customer base by acquiring Galaxy TV&#x27;s subscribers from the Australis Media liquidator and commenced offering its services on a satellite television platform. There is currently one major subscription television provider in Australia, Foxtel. Foxtel bought Austar in 2012 and has now completed the merger of its operations. Other minor providers include TransACT, Neighbourhood Cable, and SelecTV.

In the capital cities, cable is the more predominant form of pay television distribution. In regional areas or in new or outskirted areas of cities, satellite is far more common.

Due to its history, financial backing, and market dominance, most local versions of channels are either owned directly by Foxtel or through related companies.

In terms of coverage, Foxtel&#x27;s cable network covers parts of Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Adelaide, and Perth. Optus&#x27;s network covers small parts of Sydney, Melbourne, and Brisbane, though its restrictive subscription rules mean that many people living in apartments or confined living areas may be unable to connect.

Austar (now Foxtel) is available by satellite in most of regional and rural Australia, but does have a small cable network in the city of Darwin. TransACT is only available in Canberra, where a custom cable network was developed. A similar situation used to exist in Perth where a small area was covered by Bright Telecommunications (though they closed down after lack of funding) as well in parts of Geelong, Ballarat and Mildura that are reached by Neighbourhood Cable.

==Satellite television==

Satellite television in Australia has proven to be a far more feasible option than cable television, perhaps due to the vast distances between population centres, (although Canada, which also has large distances between population centres, has a relatively high cable television penetration rate). The first service to come online in Australia was Galaxy, which was later taken over by cable television giant Foxtel, which now operates both cable and satellite services to all state capital cities (except Darwin and Hobart) and the whole of Western Australia. Its main metropolitan rival was Optus Vision, while rural areas are served by Austar, both of which just rebroadcast Foxtel as of 2005. In 2006 SelecTV began operating, aiming at providing comparatively low-cost packages and catering to specialised market segments.

==Internet television==

Internet television in Australia is the digital distribution of movies and television content via the Internet. In Australia, internet television is provided by a number of generalist, subscription-based streaming service providers, in addition to several niche providers that focus on specific genres. Australia&#x27;s five major free-to-air television networks also all offer catch up TV of previously broadcast content to watch via their webpages and apps, and a number of ISPs and other companies offer IPTV – the live streaming of television channels sourced from Australia and elsewhere.

==Broadcasting programming synopsis==

Australia has produced numerous notable television series and miniseries, with the most prominent programs coming from the comedy, police, and medical drama genres.

===Serials and dramas===
One of the earliest Australian police drama series was &quot;Homicide&quot;, produced in Melbourne by Crawford Productions, widely viewed as having revolutionised Australian television drama production. It was followed by &quot;Division 4&quot; and &quot;Matlock Police&quot;, which also enjoyed great popularity and long runs both locally and overseas. Other successful police drama series have included &quot;Cop Shop&quot;, &quot;Police Rescue&quot;, &quot;Blue Heelers&quot;, &quot;Water Rats&quot; and &quot;Stingers&quot;. Medical dramas have also proved popular with audiences, including series such as &quot;A Country Practice&quot;, &quot;The Flying Doctors&quot;, &quot;GP&quot; and &quot;All Saints&quot;.

===Mini-serials===
Notable miniseries have included &quot;Against the Wind&quot;, &quot;All the Rivers Run&quot;, &quot;Bodyline&quot;, &quot;Brides of Christ&quot;, &quot;The Dismissal&quot; and &quot;The Timeless Land&quot;, and in more recent times &quot;Curtin&quot;, &quot;Bastard Boys&quot; and &quot;The Slap&quot;.

===Soap opera===
Australian soap opera success began with &quot;Bellbird&quot; in 1967 which was a moderate but consistent success. Following this the huge success of &quot;Number 96&quot; in 1972 prompted creation of the similar &quot;The Box&quot; in 1974. These serials were all cancelled in 1977. Following this successful serials included &quot;The Young Doctors&quot;, &quot;The Sullivans&quot;, &quot;Prisoner&quot;, &quot;Sons and Daughters&quot;, &quot;Neighbours&quot; and &quot;Home and Away&quot;. This later group were also screened internationally, finding particular success in the United Kingdom.

===Comedy===
Comedy series have included &quot;The Aunty Jack Show&quot;, &quot;The Paul Hogan Show&quot;, &quot;The Norman Gunston Show&quot;, and more recently &quot;The D-Generation&quot;, &quot;Frontline&quot;, &quot;The Glass House&quot;, &quot;Bogan Hunters&quot;, &quot;Summer Heights High&quot;, &quot;Please Like Me&quot; and popular series &quot;Thank God You&#x27;re Here&quot;, which has since been adapted to a number of countries around the world, and already several of them have brought in creators and stars of shows like &quot;Kath &amp; Kim&quot; to help produce, direct, star, or serve as consultants on their versions.

===Scheduling===

The scheduling for each network is quite diverse: while the Seven Network, Nine Network, and affiliates have an hour of news and current affairs at 6:00 pm, Network 10 has news at 5:00 pm while ABC has news at 7:00 pm and SBS has world news at 6:30 pm. The primetime slot in Australia runs from 6:00 pm to midnight, with the most popular programming shown from around 7:30 pm to 10:30 pm.

Many programs shown in these times on commercial networks are taken from American television, while ABC has a mixture of Australian and British productions. SBS, as a multicultural broadcaster, shows a range of programs produced locally and overseas in a number of languages. Imported programming has typically been shown months after its debut in the United States or the United Kingdom, however, in recent times networks have begun to air programs within hours or days of their overseas counterparts.

Seven and Nine have rival breakfast shows that run from 5:30–9:00 am while 10 airs repeated shows from the previous day at 6:00 am–8:30 am, followed by morning shows on all three networks until midday. ABC now broadcasts a breakfast news show (ABC News Breakfast) while on ABC TV Plus and ABC Me there are children&#x27;s programming, also on 9Go! and Nickelodeon, Australian children&#x27;s programming currently airs on 7flix, 9Go! and Nickelodeon, meanwhile on SBS foreign-language bulletins are shown for most of the morning, followed by foreign-language films and documentaries.

Most scheduling is consistent across Australia&#x27;s three time zones – this means that South Australia and the Northern Territory sees programming half an hour behind Australian Eastern Time, while in Western Australia programs are seen two hours behind. When daylight saving is in effect, because it is only partially observed, Queensland gets programming one hour later, Northern Territory sees it 90 minutes behind and Western Australia receives its shows three hours behind. Consequently, many national news bulletins shown live to eastern states are seen on considerable delay in Western Australia (with the notable exception of &quot;The Midday Report&quot;, of which a second edition is produced for WA). The time delay can often deny viewers in central and western areas the opportunity to participate in interactive shows such as &quot;The Voice&quot;.

One exception to this rule are subscription channels, which always run on Australian Eastern Time regardless of the local service or time zone. The recent introduction of timeshift channels delayed two hours for all viewers, particularly on Foxtel, allowed WA viewers to see programs in sync with other states during standard time (although due to WA&#x27;s non-observance of daylight saving, programs air one hour ahead during this time). However, ABC News is live across the nation with no delay, the only free-to-air television channel to do this.

==News and current affairs==

===News===

Both national public broadcasters, the ABC and SBS, produce news services. The ABC provides both local and national news bulletins in the form of &quot;ABC News&quot; at 5:30pm, 7pm and &quot;The Midday Report&quot;, presented from Sydney and state capitals. SBS broadcasts a nightly hour-long &quot;World News Australia&quot; bulletin at 6.30pm, followed by a later, half-hour edition at 10.30pm.

Higher ratings for earlier bulletins from commercial broadcasters including the Seven Network and Nine Network have prompted fierce ratings competition. For most years up until the mid-1990&#x27;s &quot;Nine News&quot; was traditionally the highest-rating news service in Australia, but in 2005 it was overtaken by &quot;Seven News&quot; before it regained the lead on a national basis in 2013.

&quot;Seven News&quot; produces &quot;Seven Early News, Seven Morning News, Seven News at 4&quot; and &quot;Seven News&quot; local bulletins in Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Adelaide, Perth, Cairns, Townsville and Mackay. The network&#x27;s news bulletins and breakfast program &quot;Sunrise&quot; compete directly with the Nine Network&#x27;s offerings, which include &quot;Today&quot; and &quot;Nine Morning News&quot;, &quot;Nine Afternoon News&quot; and &quot;Nine News&quot; local bulletins. &quot;10 News First&quot; currently produces a local hour-long weeknight bulletin of &quot;10 News First&quot; and on weekends it airs a national hour-long bulletin.

In Australia, there are two local 24-hour news channels. The ABC News channel is Australia&#x27;s only free-to-air news channel. ABC News launched on 22 July 2010 as ABC News 24 and it features all of ABCs news and current affairs programs. ABC News is available on digital channel 24. Sky News Australia is Australia&#x27;s second news channel that is only available on Foxtel, Austar, and Optus TV. The subscription based television channel draws on the resources of its shareholders news services, using content from Seven News, Nine News and Sky News from the United Kingdom, as well as reporters based in Sydney, Canberra, and Melbourne.

A number of regional television networks produce news services. WIN Television produces 20 bulletins in parts of New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland, South Australia, and Western Australia. NBN is the only regional broadcaster to produce a bulletin on both weeknights and weekends, in an hour-long format presented from Newcastle and seen across northern New South Wales. Seven produces news updates throughout regional New South Wales and Victoria, with its sister station producing Seven News for Western Australia. In the Northern Territory, Imparja Television shows Imparja National News. Southern Cross Seven produces a bulletin for Tasmania and regional South Australia. In addition Sky News Australia has a regional free-to-air news channel called Sky News Regional on digital channels 53 and 56 in partnership with Southern Cross Austereo and WIN Television on their TV stations.

===Current affairs===
Current affairs programming is shown in a broad range of formats, ranging between tabloid-style current affairs shows to investigative programs such as &quot;Four Corners&quot;.

ABC has had a long history of producing current affairs programs, including the award-winning &quot;This Day Tonight&quot;, the first regular current affairs program to be shown on Australian television and a training ground for many of Australia&#x27;s best-known journalists. &quot;This Day Tonight&quot; was axed in 1978, however in the mid-1980s &quot;The 7.30 Report&quot; was launched in state-based editions (these were combined into a national program hosted by Kerry O&#x27;Brien in 1995). &quot;Four Corners&quot;, first seen in 1961, an investigative documentary series modelled on the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Panorama&quot;, has also won many awards and broken stories previously not covered by other media outlets.

Other current affairs programs include news and analysis program &quot;Lateline&quot;, &quot;7.30&quot;, &quot;Foreign Correspondent&quot;, &quot;Insiders&quot;, &quot;Offsiders&quot; and &quot;Australia Wide&quot;.

SBS also shows a number of current affairs programs, such as &quot;Dateline&quot;, the country&#x27;s longest-running international current affairs program, launched in 1984. &quot;Insight&quot;, originally conceived in 1999 as a domestic current affairs program, is a discussion forum focussing on a single issue. SBS&#x27;s Indigenous Media Unit produces another program titled &quot;Living Black&quot;, which covers issues relevant to Australia&#x27;s indigenous community.

There are a number of commercial current affairs programs. The Seven Network, in addition to Sunrise, broadcasts &quot;Today Tonight&quot;, a tabloid current affairs program, every weeknight after its 6pm news bulletin. On the Nine Network, &quot;A Current Affair&quot;, first shown in 1971, competes directly with &quot;Today Tonight&quot; and has, since Ray Martin began presenting in 1994, provided a similar mix of content. On Sundays, &quot;60 Minutes&quot; features a number of stories produced both locally and from its US counterpart. In the morning &quot;Sunday&quot; covers local and overseas news, politics, and current affairs, in addition to film reviews, politics, arts, and music.

Political and interview program &quot;The Bolt Report&quot; is also shown on Sunday mornings, on Network 10.

On subscription television, Sky News Australia airs a number of news commentary and analysis shows such as &quot;Agenda, Sportsline, Sky Business Report, and Sky News Eco Report&quot;. A local version of Sky News Weather Channel was launched in 1999, joined in 2006 by Fox Sports News, a 24-hour sports news channel. &quot;Squawk Australia&quot;, a business news program shown from 6.00am, is seen on CNBC Asia.

==Indigenous television==
In the 21st century, and especially the 2010s, programmes and series by and about Indigenous Australians proliferated. &quot;The Circuit&quot; (2007) was an early example; &quot;Redfern Now&quot;, &quot;8MMM Aboriginal Radio&quot;, &quot;The Gods of Wheat Street&quot; (2014), &quot;Ready for This&quot;, &quot;Cleverman&quot;, &quot;Black Comedy&quot;, &quot;The Warriors&quot;, &quot;Kiki &amp; Kitty&quot;, &quot;Total Control&quot;, &quot;KGB&quot;, &quot;Little J &amp; Big Cuz&quot;, &quot;Mystery Road&quot; were all well received. Shari Sebbens commented that a &quot;golden age&quot; of Indigenous television is here.

The last episode of the second series of &quot;Get Krack!n&quot;, featuring Miranda Tapsell and Nakkiah Lui and co-written by Lui, trended on Twitter, outraged right wing commentator Andrew Bolt, and was widely lauded as hilarious, ground-breaking, hard-hitting satire.

National Indigenous Television (NITV) is (since 2012) a national, free-to-air channel dedicated to Indigenous stories, news, films and issues, with programming produced largely by Indigenous people, funded through SBS. In early 2016, it refreshed its brand and revamped its schedule, with an increased focus on its central charter, Indigenous news and current affairs.

==Ratings==

Television ratings in Australia are collected by three main organisations: OzTAM in metropolitan areas, Regional TAM in regional areas serviced by three commercial television networks, and in areas with two commercial networks, Nielsen Media Research Australia.

Ratings are collected for 40 weeks during the year, excluding a two-week break during Easter and ten weeks over summer. The majority of locally produced comedy and drama on commercial networks is shown during the ratings period.

For many years up until the mid-nineties, the Nine Network had been the ratings leader in Australia, typically followed by the Seven Network and Network 10. Subscription television and the two national broadcasters, ABC and in particular SBS, due to its special-interest nature, typically attract fewer viewers than the three commercial networks. Network 10, due to its programming line-up, has traditionally been the market leader for younger viewers.

In 2007, the Seven Network overtook its rival Nine Network in terms of average viewers, and in 2011, it became the first television network since OzTam&#x27;s launch in 2001 to win all 40 weeks in a ratings season. As of 2016, it has won the last ten ratings seasons consecutively. ABC has also, since the early 2000s, seen ratings (as well as audience reach) as a major performance indicator. The Nine Network has, in the past, aggressively marketed its long-time ratings dominance through its promotional campaign &quot;Still the One&quot;, which they no longer use.

==Regulation==
Content on Australian television is regulated by the Australian Communications and Media Authority. All codes of practice submitted to the Australian Communications and Media Authority are reviewed by the public prior to acceptance. There are different regulations for different types of content, and the main categories are divided up into Australian content, children&#x27;s content, commercial broadcasting, community broadcasting, public broadcasting, and subscription television.

The regulations in place define what a broadcaster may put on-air, the time(s) of day they are allowed to broadcast specific material, and what advertisements are shown in relation to these criteria. In essence, the Australian Communications and Media Authority controls what content is shown, what time(s) of day it is shown, and who controls what is shown (i.e.: international media as opposed to Australian media).

Genre restrictions imposed by the Australian government on digital multi-channeling were lifted along with the media ownership laws passed through the Parliament of Australia on 18 October 2006. Digital-only multichannels in Australia were previously limited in the subjects they could cover, with programming identified as comedy, drama, national news, sport or entertainment, prohibited from broadcast.

<text>3LW (initialism of &quot;3 Little Women&quot;) was an American girl group formed in 1999 by Adrienne Bailon, Kiely Williams, and Naturi Naughton. 3LW was signed to Epic Records, and released their debut studio album &quot;3LW&quot; in 2000, which peaked at number 29 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and was certified platinum. The album was preceded by the single &quot;No More (Baby I&#x27;ma Do Right)&quot;, which peaked at number 23 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and became a top 10 hit in several countries. 

In 2002, 3LW released the single &quot;I Do (Wanna Get Close to You)&quot;, which was a moderate chart success. Following its release, Naturi Naughton left the group, citing conflicts with the group&#x27;s management. The group continued as a duo and released the albums &quot;A Girl Can Mack&quot; (2002), and &quot;Naughty or Nice&quot; (2002), the latter of which was their first album not to have any contributions from Naughton. The releases did not match the success of their debut, and at the end of 2002, the group held auditions for a new third member. 

Jessica Benson was announced as 3LW&#x27;s new third member in 2003 and the group signed with So So Def. Bailon and Williams became involved with the film &quot;The Cheetah Girls&quot; (2003), and as the project expanded into a real girl group, releases by 3LW were placed on hold. 3LW eventually released the single &quot;Feelin&#x27; You&quot; in 2006, but the song failed to find much success, and the group split the following year.

==History==
===1998–2001: &quot;3LW&quot;===
In 1999, the group 3LW was formed by sisters Michelle and Tse Williams. Michelle&#x27;s daughter and Tse&#x27;s niece Kiely was the first member of the lineup and the group would soon be rounded out by Adrienne Bailon and Naturi Naughton with both Michelle and Tse as co-managers. Singer Alicia Keys was also briefly considered for the group. 

3LW&#x27;s debut single &quot;No More (Baby I&#x27;ma Do Right)&quot;, released in the fall of 2000, was a chart success, peaking at number 23 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and becoming a top 10 hit in several countries. The group&#x27;s self-titled debut album was released on December 5, 2000 and peaked at number 29 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. It was certified platinum by the RIAA, selling 1.3 million copies in the US. In April 2001, the group released their second single, &quot;Playas Gon&#x27; Play&quot;, which failed to replicate the success of its predecessor, only peaking at number 81. In the summer of 2001, the group embarked on the MTV Total Request Live Tour along with Destiny&#x27;s Child, Dream, Nelly, Eve, and Jessica Simpson. In 2001, 3LW recorded &quot;What More Can I Give&quot; as part of a supergroup of various artists including Michael Jackson, Reba McEntire, and Mariah Carey in response to the September 11 attacks. Late that year, they collaborated with Lil&#x27; Romeo and Nick Cannon for a cover of &quot;Parents Just Don&#x27;t Understand&quot; on the &quot;Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius&quot; soundtrack. 

===2002: &quot;A Girl Can Mack&quot; and Naughton&#x27;s departure===
3LW announced in February 2002 that they had recorded 10 tracks for their sophomore studio album to be titled &quot;A Girl Can Mack&quot;; it was later set for a release date of September 17, 2002. In April, they appeared on Naughty by Nature&#x27;s single &quot;Feels Good (Don&#x27;t Worry Bout a Thing)&quot;. On June 18, the group released the P. Diddy–produced single &quot;I Do (Wanna Get Close To You)&quot;, featuring Loon. The song was a moderate chart hit, peaking at number 58 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. It achieved greater success in New Zealand, where it peaked at number 13. In mid-July, the group was rehearsing for a concert special as part of the TEENick Summer Concerts series. By this point, tensions between the group members had begun to fray. According to Naughton, the group was told by management that each girl would have an understudy during rehearsals as a &quot;precautionary measure&quot;, but an understudy was only brought in for Naughton. Bailon and Williams did not like working with the understudy, and all three members of 3LW made amends. The concert special aired on August 25 and was released on DVD as &quot;Live on Sunset&quot; in November. 

The group was scheduled to release &quot;A Girl Can Mack&quot; in September when in mid-August, member Naughton left the group following an altercation between her and Williams involving a plate of food from KFC. Williams and Bailon initially denied that this occurred; Williams later acknowledged the incident but said that &quot;it was so much more than that&quot;. Naughton cited numerous conflicts with the group&#x27;s management (mainly Michelle Williams, Kiely Williams&#x27;s mother) and said that she was forced out of the group. Naughton also claimed that she was harassed by Michelle Williams for not pursuing a romantic relationship with a member of the hip-hop group St. Lunatics in a effort to get a spot on their tour. Group members Williams and Bailon claimed that Naughton had been unhappy within the group for some time and lacked ambition. In October, Naughton filed a lawsuit against the group and their management for compensation of loss of income, however, in March 2003, Bailon and Williams said that there was &quot;no lawsuit&quot; and that they had not been served papers.

Following Naughton&#x27;s departure, Epic Records quickly introduced Williams and Bailon to two potential replacements for Naughton. Williams and Bailon decided to continue 3LW as a duo, causing the press to jokingly refer to them as &quot;2LW&quot;. Naughton&#x27;s image and vocals still appear on the record, with Williams noting that Naughton &quot;participated on the album just as much as we did. So we didn’t feel it would be right to not have her. This album is coming out just as it would be if she was sitting here with us.&quot; Despite this, &quot;A Girl Can Mack&quot;&#x27;s planned September release date was pushed back a month and the duo returned to the studio to record five new tracks after several songs intended for the record leaked online. The album was released on October 22, 2002, and debuted at No. 15 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 with 53,000 copies sold in its first week. After the album&#x27;s second single &quot;Neva Get Enuf&quot; underperformed, 3LW released their Christmas-themed third studio album &quot;Naughty or Nice&quot;, which failed to appear on any major &quot;Billboard&quot; charts.

===2003–2007: Canceled album and breakup===
Beginning in late 2002, 3LW held nationwide auditions for a new third member. Fifteen year old Jessica &quot;J&quot; Benson was selected and made her first public appearance with the group in March 2003. At the end of the month, the group released &quot;I Need That (I Want That)&quot;, as the third single from &quot;A Girl Can Mack&quot;, but the song did not chart. With Benson, the group continued to promote &quot;A Girl Can Mack&quot; with several tour dates. In June, 3LW departed from Epic Records and signed with So So Def. 

Amidst 3LW&#x27;s public drama, Bailon and Williams signed on to star in the Disney Channel Original Movie, &quot;The Cheetah Girls&quot;, alongside Raven-Symoné and Sabrina Bryan. The movie was filmed in October and November 2002 and premiered in August 2003. The film&#x27;s success prompted Disney to turn the project into a real girl group. The Cheetah Girls project grew, with several albums released, however, Bailon noted that both projects would continue concurrently. The release of 3LW&#x27;s fourth studio album, tentatively titled &quot;Phoenix Rising&quot; in 2003 and later &quot;Point of No Return&quot; in 2005, was delayed several times. 

On August 15, 2006, the group released the single &quot;Feelin&#x27; You&quot;, but it did not impact any major charts. &quot;Point of No Return&quot; was shelved and Bailon and Williams continued with The Cheetah Girls. 3LW officially disbanded in 2007.

<text>Courtney Anne Kupets Carter (born July 27, 1986) is an American former artistic gymnast. She is a two-time Olympic medalist from the 2004 Olympics (silver in the team competition, bronze on uneven bars), the 2002 world champion on the uneven bars, the 2003 U.S. national all-around champion, and the 2004 U.S. national all-around co-champion (with Carly Patterson). She is also a member of the gold medal-winning U.S. team at the 2003 World Championships.

During her time at the University of Georgia, the Georgia women&#x27;s gymnastics team won four straight NCAA national championships from 2006 to 2009. During the 2009–10 season, Kupets was a student assistant coach to the team&#x27;s new head coach, Jay Clark. On May 9, 2017, Kupets-Carter was announced as the new head coach of the Georgia Gym Dogs. She was relieved as head coach of Georgia Gymnastics on April 19, 2024.

== Early life ==
Kupets was raised in Gaithersburg, Maryland, and trained at Hill&#x27;s Gymnastics, the former gym of Olympians Dominique Dawes and Elise Ray. After the 2004 Olympics, she competed for the University of Georgia (UGA) where she was a member of Alpha Omicron Pi women&#x27;s fraternity, joining her older sister, Ashley Kupets.

==Gymnastics==
===Early gymnastics career===
Kupets began gymnastics in 1989, earned a place on USA Gymnastics&#x27; TOPs developmental team in 1994, and reached the elite level in 1999. At her first U.S. National Championships in 1999, she placed eighth in the junior division and became a member of the junior national team.

===Senior career===
In 2002, her first year as a senior competitor, Kupets placed second at the American Cup, behind 2000 Olympian Tasha Schwikert, and placed eighth at Nationals. She was named to the U.S. team for the 2002 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships in Debrecen, Hungary, where she won the uneven bars final over five-time defending champion Svetlana Khorkina.

In 2003, Kupets won the U.S. Classic and then became the national champion for the first time. She was named to the U.S. team for the 2003 World Championships in Anaheim, California, and competed well in the qualifying round, contributing to the USA&#x27;s high placement and qualifying to the all-around and uneven bars finals. However, during a practice session before the team finals, she tore her left Achilles tendon on a double Arabian somersault and was forced to withdraw from the event, returning home to Maryland immediately for surgery. The U.S. team went on to win the gold medal. Kupets was still considered a member of the squad and received credit and a medal for her contributions in the preliminaries.

In 2004, Kupets became co-national champion with Patterson. A few weeks later, she placed first at the Olympic Trials, earning a spot on the Olympic team.

====2004 Olympic Games====
At the Olympics in Athens, the U.S. women won a silver medal. Kupets was expected to compete on bars, beam and floor in the team final; but a leg injury (later discovered to be a stress fracture in her hip) caused her to be suddenly withdrawn from the beam lineup. Mohini Bhardwaj took her place on the event, and Kupets competed only on bars and floor in the team final. She received the team&#x27;s highest score on bars (9.662), putting the U.S. temporarily ahead of eventual winner Romania in the standings. But she also received the lowest score on floor exercise (9.187) after faltering on a dance combination while trying to turn on the opposite leg from the one she normally used.

Kupets competed in the individual all-around after placing fourth, with a total score of 37.937, in the qualifying round. In the final, she finished ninth with a total of 37.112 after stepping out of bounds on floor exercise and nearly falling on beam. However, she won the bronze medal in the uneven bars final with a score of 9.637, behind Émilie Le Pennec of France (9.687) and fellow American Terin Humphrey (9.662). She finished fifth in the balance beam final with a score of 9.375.

After returning from Athens, Kupets traveled across the United States with other gymnasts on an exhibition tour sponsored by T.J. Maxx.

===NCAA career===
In 2005, Kupets joined the University of Georgia gymnastics team on a full athletic scholarship. In her first season, she was named SEC freshman of the year and she contributed to the team&#x27;s first-place finish at the 2006 NCAA Women&#x27;s Gymnastics Championships and won the all-around, bars, and beam titles.

During the 2007 season, she received a 10.00 on the uneven bars while competing against the University of Alabama. It was the first 10.00 on the bars for Georgia since 2002 and the first of Kupets&#x27; career.

At the 2007 Southeastern Conference (SEC) Championships, Kupets tied teammate Katie Heenan for the all-around gold with a total of 39.600, and earned the vault and bars titles with scores of 9.975 and 9.925, respectively. In the team competition, Georgia lost to the University of Florida after winning the conference title for the previous three years. After this, Kupets led the team to the North Central Regional title and won the all-around despite the distraction of her older sister, Ashley Kupets, tearing her Achilles tendon during the warmup for floor exercise.

Two weeks later, Georgia upset Florida to win the preliminary session at Nationals. Kupets scored 39.75 on Day 1, with a 9.9 on beam and 9.95 on bars, floor, and vault, earning her second consecutive NCAA all-around title. In the Super 6 finals, Georgia totaled 197.85 and earned a third-consecutive NCAA team championship, the team&#x27;s eighth overall. Kupets also won the individual vault title, along with silver medals on bars and floor and a bronze on beam. She was the only gymnast to medal on all four events.

Performing on floor during a meet against Arkansas in March 2008, Kupets tore her right Achilles tendon, the second such injury she had suffered in her career. She was out for the remainder of the season.

At the start of 2009, Kupets was named SEC Gymnast of the Week for the first four weeks of the season and won the all-around at seven straight meets. Against Alabama, she recorded a career-best 39.825 to win the all-around and scored perfect 10s on uneven bars and beam. At a home meet against Florida, she scored the first perfect 10 of her career on floor en route to winning the all-around with another career best of 39.850. Though Georgia faltered at the SEC Championships and suffered their only defeat of the season, Kupets again claimed the all-around title and was named SEC Gymnast of the Year. She led Georgia to a win at Regionals with a 10.00 on vault, giving her at least one 10 on each apparatus in the 2009 season.

At the 2009 NCAA Championships, Kupets became national all-around champion for a record-tying third time, earning a 10 on beam and defeating runner-up Kristina Baskett of Utah with a total score of 39.800. The next night, she helped Georgia win its fifth consecutive and tenth overall NCAA championship, posting a career-best 39.900. She scored perfect 10s on the uneven bars and vault, bringing her season total to seven and her career total to eight. In the individual event finals, she won the bars and beam titles (beating fellow Gym Dog and 2004 Olympic teammate Courtney McCool on beam), tied to win floor, and placed third on vault, setting an NCAA record of nine individual titles to end her college career.

Kupets is the first NCAA gymnast ever to win the all-around and every individual event. On June 22, 2009, she was awarded the Honda-Broderick Cup, which is given to the top female college athlete.

In July 2016, Kupets began coaching full-time at Oconee Gymnastics &amp; Cheer. Also in 2016, Kupets appeared on NBC&#x27;s digital program, The Daily Dismount, as a gymnastics commentator for NBC&#x27;s Olympic coverage. She was named head coach of University of Georgia&#x27;s women&#x27;s gymnastics team in May 2017.

== Personal life ==
She is distantly related to the 1947 Heisman Trophy winner Johnny Lujack. She also is cousins with current Pittsburgh Steelers wide receiver Ben Skowronek. Former NFL quarterback Trent Green is related by marriage. She married Chris Carter, a former acrobatic gymnast for Great Britain, in 2014. The couple have three daughters, Brooklyn, Savannah, and Charlotte, and a son Bentley together.

<doc id="914305" wikidata="Q5117215" url="?curid=914305" title="Church of St Edward the Martyr, Brookwood">
<text>St. Edward the Martyr Orthodox Church is a True Orthodox Church in Brookwood, Surrey, England.

The monastic Saint Edward Brotherhood was established at Brookwood Cemetery in 1982 to prepare and care for a new church in a fitting grade I landscape in which the relics of Saint Edward the Martyr, the king of England who was murdered in 978 and who was succeeded by force by Ethelred the Unready, were eventually enshrined in 1988. It has two communities: 
*A small monastic community who chant the services of the church daily at the shrine.
*&#x27;True Orthodox&#x27; Christians who form a mission parish. These Christians supplement the congregation on Sundays and feast days.

St. Edward&#x27;s is currently under the jurisdiction of the Church of the Genuine Orthodox Christians of Greece (GOC-K), a Greek Old Calendarists True Orthodox Church headed by Archbishop Kallinikos of Athens. It became part of this jurisdiction in 2014 following the merger of the Orthodox Church of Greece (Holy Synod in Resistance), of which it had been a part since leaving the Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia in 2007, with the GOC-K.

<doc id="914307" wikidata="Q2470605" url="?curid=914307" title="Pommac">
<text>Pommac is the brand name for a carbonated soft drink made by Carlsberg Sverige AB of fruits and berries. It is matured in oak barrels for three months. The name comes from &quot;Pommery&quot;, referring to Champagne, and Cognac, as it is matured in oak barrels like wine. Another theory of the naming is the French word &quot;pomace&quot;, which literally means remains of pressed fruits. See also Ripasso.

== History ==
In 1919, after his best efforts to keep his brewery running Anders Lindahl moved to Stockholm, Sweden as a failed businessman, and founded Fructus Fabriker and began to make Pommac. The recipe was made by a Finland-Swedish inventor. The drink was made for the upper classes as an alcohol-free substitute for wine.

In the US, Dr Pepper distributed a formulation of it, with sodium cyclamate as a sweetener, as a diet drink from 1963 to 1969 in six-and-a-half- and ten-ounce bottles. The original had always used sugar as its sweetener.

Pommac is also served as a non-alcoholic champagne alternative on festive occasions. 
In late 2004, Carlsberg in Denmark announced that they were going to cease production of Pommac for financial reasons. However, after overwhelming public demand, the company decided to keep marketing Pommac.

Finnish brewery Hartwall has produced Pommac in Finland since 1950. It purchased the Finnish trademark in 2001. Pommac is in Finland an extremely popular non-alcoholic substitute for champagne and sparkling wines, and as children&#x27;s birthday celebration drink.

<text>Big Bite was an Australian sketch comedy television series which ran on the Seven Network from 8 May 2003 to 4 March 2004 in a prime time timeslot on Thursdays. Since the end of the series, episodes have been repeated on the Foxtel cable channel, The Comedy Channel and 7Two.

==Overview==
Only moderately successful on its initial broadcast and despite an initially mixed reception, the show has gradually developed something of a cult following, due to having begun the careers of a number of now prominent performers, directors and writers. Andrew O&#x27;Keefe started his television career on the show and went on to host &quot;Deal or No Deal&quot;, &quot;Dragons&#x27; Den&quot;, &quot;The Rich List&quot;, &quot;Weekend Sunrise&quot; and &quot;The Chase Australia&quot;. Chris Lilley&#x27;s character Mr G first appeared here; he subsequently appeared in &quot;Summer Heights High&quot; and released a novelty single.

Other performers on the show included improvisational comedian Rebecca De Unamuno, experimental theatre star Melissa Madden Gray (now known internationally for her cabaret character &#x27;Meow Meow&#x27;), Kate McCartney (who would go on to star in &quot;The Katering Show&quot; and &quot;Get Krack!n&quot;), Richard Pyros (today a member of The Sydney Theatre Company&#x27;s &#x27;Residents&#x27; acting ensemble) and Jake Stone, former lead singer of popular Australian funk pop rock band Bluejuice. Other television personalities associated with the show included The Comedy Channel presenter Cameron Knight, comedian Charlie Pickering and actor Charlie Clausen. Many of the actors from this series would later appear on &quot;The Hamish and Andy Show&quot;.

Regular cast member Tristan Jepson, who wrote and played Tom Gleisner in the show&#x27;s acclaimed parody of &quot;The Panel&quot;, committed suicide at the age of 26 in late 2004 after suffering from clinical depression. During the television broadcast of the 2005 Australian Film Institute Awards, he was honoured among the roll call of performers to have died in the previous year.

The show&#x27;s co-creators included Andrew Jones and head writer Rick Kalowski, who have gone to success as a sought-after writing team. The show&#x27;s directors included Ted Emery (&quot;Fast Forward&quot;, &quot;The Micallef Program&quot;, &quot;Kath &amp; Kim&quot;) and Matthew Saville (&quot;Noise&quot;, &quot;We Can Be Heroes&quot;, &quot;The King&quot;).

&quot;Big Bite&quot; was nominated for Best Television Comedy Series at the 2003 Australian Film Institute Awards, becoming the first commercial network comedy series ever nominated in any category of those awards.

==Media release==
A two-DVD set of the entire series (13 half-hour episodes) was released in Australia on 6 November 2006. This included the so-called &#x27;lost&#x27; final episode of the series, which had not aired on Australian television during the series&#x27; original run.

<doc id="914310" wikidata="Q685211" url="?curid=914310" title="Pilatus PC-12">
<text>The Pilatus PC-12 is a pressurized, single-engined, turboprop aircraft manufactured by Pilatus Aircraft of Stans, Switzerland since 1991. It was designed as a high-performance utility aircraft that incorporates a large aft cargo door in addition to the main passenger door. Due to its efficient, high-utility design, the PC-12 is used by a large variety of operators. The main use for the aircraft is corporate transportation, but it is also used by fractional and small regional airlines, air-ambulance operators, and many government agencies, such as police departments and armed forces. The 2,000th PC-12 was delivered in May 2023.

==Development==

In October 1989, Pilatus announced the development of the PC-12 at the annual convention of the National Business Aviation Association (NBAA). Prior to the 1989 announcement, the PC-12 project had been worked on for some time under high levels of secrecy; by the time of the announcement, assembly of the first prototype had already commenced. Pilatus believed that the PC-12 would fit a new market not served by existing aircraft and that the type would be the first single-engined aircraft with a large cabin that would be capable of flying at high speeds across long distances. The two prototypes were completed on 1 May 1991, with the first flight taking place on 31 May 1991. Swiss certification of the type had been originally planned for mid-1991, but a redesign of the wings (to increase the wingspan and add winglets to ensure performance guarantees were met) delayed progress. On 30 March 1994, the Swiss Federal Office of Civil Aviation issued the type certificate for the PC-12; Federal Aviation Administration approval in the U.S. followed on 15 July 1994.

Since entering service, Pilatus developed a large number of improvements and options upon the original PC-12 model; changes include increasing the maximum takeoff weight, using increasingly powerful engines, adopting new avionics, incorporating noise-reduction measures, adding new propellers, speed and range increases, additional interiors, and new inflight entertainment systems. Other aviation firms, such as Finoff Aviation Products, have also produced their own independent products and aftermarket enhancement packages for the PC-12.

=== PC-12NG ===
Pilatus announced the PC-12NG (Next Generation) at the 2006 NBAA meeting in Orlando and officially launched it during the NBAA 2007 in Atlanta. The NG features a more powerful Pratt &amp; Whitney PT6A-67P engine with better climb performance and an increase in maximum cruise speed to 280 knots true airspeed (TAS). The NG also features a Honeywell Primus Apex glass cockpit; prior to this, the PC-12 had been one of the few high-end models to lack flat-panel avionics. The revised cockpit includes automatic pressurization control, as well as cursor controlled inputs to the navigation system. The PC-12 NG winglets have also been modified from the original version. Within two years of launch, over 200 orders reportedly had been placed for the PC-12 NG. In May 2008, the first PC-12 NG was delivered.

The PC-12M (Multipurpose) is based on the PC-12 NG, but equipped with a more powerful electrical generation system that allows installing additional power-consuming equipment. This enables the PC-12M to perform missions such as flight inspection, air ambulance, aerial photography, and aerial surveillance. An optional utility door accommodates parachute drops of people and cargo. This version is marketed in the United States as the PC-12 Spectre paramilitary special-missions platform.

On 18 December 2012, Pilatus officially opened its Chinese headquarters in Chongqing Liangjiang and announced future manufacturing of the PC-12 for Asia-Pacific customers on the production line at this site. In September 2014, it was announced that the production for various aerostructures for the PC-12 NG would be performed by Tata Aircraft Systems in India from 2016 onwards, these parts having previously been manufactured by PZL-Świdnik in Poland.

=== PC-12NGX ===
At the October 2019 NBAA convention, Pilatus announced the already certified PC-12NGX.
Its PT6E-67XP includes a full-authority digital engine control and a low-speed propeller mode to lower cabin noise.
It reaches a 290 kn TAS (537 km/h) cruise.
Updated Honeywell avionics with autothrottle feature both cursor control device and touchscreen.
Adapted from the PC-24, the cabin windows are 10% larger and the redesigned cabin includes new seats.
Scheduled maintenance is extended to 600 flight hours and time between overhaul increases from 4,000 to 5,000 hours.
Deliveries should start in the second quarter of 2020 at a US$4.39 million base price, up to 5.369 million typically equipped as an executive aircraft.
In 2023, its equipped price was $6.028M.

==Design==
The PC-12 is a single-engined, turboprop-powered, business aircraft, designed for performing multiple roles and to deliver performance and safety equal to twin-engined aircraft. It is powered by a single Pratt &amp; Whitney PT6A-67 engine; early models being powered by the PT6A-67B, while the later PC-12 NG variant uses the more powerful PT6A-67P, which is flat rated at only 70% of its maximum power. According to Pilatus, the PC-12 NG has exceptional versatility and is capable of operating within the most rugged environments, such as the Australian outback; it is one of the few pressurized turbine-powered aircraft capable of operating from rough landing strips.


The cabin can accommodate up to nine passengers and has a refreshment centre, an enclosed lavatory, and a rear baggage area. Other cabin configurations include executive arrangements, seating between six and eight passengers; a four-seat passenger-cargo combi layout; and an air ambulance setup housing two litters and three attending medics. The interior was designed in conjunction with BMW&#x27;s Designworks division, making extensive use of leather, fine wood veneers, and various textiles to create an environment similar to a luxury road vehicle. An atypically large cargo door is installed to accommodate bulky items, including palletised cargo.

The PC-12 incorporates numerous safety measures. The PT6A-67 engine has a reputation for considerable reliability, a factor that has reportedly been decisive to some prospective operators. To counteract stall and spin conditions, dual angle-of-attack sensors near the wingtips force the stick forwards in advance of a potential stall. For greater redundancy, the PC-12 NG has a complete split-bus dual electrical system similar to modern jet aircraft, in addition to two separate batteries and a third emergency battery. The type is certified for flight into known ice conditions; as per standard fit, pneumatic deicing systems are installed in the wings and empennage, while electrical deicing measures are integrated into the windshield, and exhaust heat is used for engine intake deicing. In 2014, &quot;Aviation Week&quot; described the PC-12 as possessing &quot;...comparatively slow take-off and landing speeds, excellent short-field performance, and easy handling characteristics.&quot;

In addition to its uses as a passenger transport and private aircraft, the PC-12 can be configured as a multimission platform, such as an air ambulance or for conducting surveillance aircraft missions. In the latter role, a retractable electro-optical/infrared sensor may be installed into the aircraft&#x27;s tail and an operator&#x27;s console, containing two display monitors, a digital video recorder, communications panel, and expansion bays to accommodate various radios and datalinks, can be fitted in the main cabin area; the aircraft may be highly customized to meet customer&#x27;s specific mission requirements. In the multimission capacity, the type has seen use by various customers, including the Red Cross, the Royal Flying Doctor Service of Australia, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, and the United States Air Force.

The type features a three-axis autopilot as standard, while weather radar, long-range navigation systems, and radar altimeter are optional. The flight deck of the PC-12 NG is equipped with Honeywell&#x27;s Primus Apex avionics system, consisting of four 10-inch, high-resolution, liquid crystal display screens, two of which perform as the primary flight displays directly forward of either pilot, the other two being multifunction displays in a central position between the two pilots. The Apex system shares many similarities to the flight decks of other business jets and has been designed to minimize crew workload and provide for improved safety during single-pilot operations. An advanced synthetic vision system, delivering greater situational awareness and safety during visual flight rules (VFR) flight, is also present. The cockpit&#x27;s layout is optimized for ergonomic and aesthetic appeal, providing similar comfort levels for the flight crew as to the passengers. An engine-condition monitoring system is present on the PC-12 NG, automatically monitoring engine parameters and producing relevant warnings, easing preventive maintenance efforts.

In October 2021, Blackhawk Aerospace announced plans to offer an “XP67P+” upgrade that will be available for many of the legacy PC-12s. The upgrade will replace the stock Pratt and Whitney PTA-67B engine with a factory-new PTA-67P, allowing higher ITT limits, 142 shaft horsepower gains, and max torque to FL230. All factors that will improve the performance of the aircraft, with 25% better climb rates, higher cruise speeds, and several other operational benefits. Blackhawk announced several deposits for their upgrade at NBAA-BACE 2022, and that baseline flight testing has been completed. STC approval for the FAA should happen second quarter 2023 with EASA certification not long after.

==Operational history==
===Commercial, corporate and private use===
Early sales of the PC-12 principally went to utility operators, because Pilatus was reportedly uncertain of the sales potential for business and passenger operators. In 1994, the Royal Flying Doctor Service of Australia became the launch customer of the PC-12. It operates 32 PC-12s throughout Australia to deliver medical services in remote areas.

In 2006, &quot;Flying&quot; referred to the PC-12 as &quot;...more economical to operate than any turbine airplane of similar size.&quot; In 2007, &quot;Flying&quot; described the high rate of value retention on used PC-12s as &quot;unbelievable&quot;—attributing this to the popular demand for the type. High oil prices are a prominent factor for increasing sales of turboprops, the PC-12 among them.

The bulk of demand comes from North America, and three-quarters of PC-12NG sales are in executive configurations. While its price grew from $3.3 million in 2005 to $4.7 million in 2015, it retains 80-85% of its selling price after 10 years given average use, better than comparable turboprop or business jets, and it sells 40% faster.

Pilatus also uses a series of overseas distributors to market and sell the PC-12 within designated regions. AMAC Aerospace is the exclusive sales agent for the type within the Middle East.

In August 2014, Californian airline Surf Air placed an order for 15 PC-12 NGs and 50 options, one of the largest contract for the type. PlaneSense, a New Hampshire-based fractional ownership company, manages the largest fleet of the type, operating 34 PC-12s as of 2015.

In June 2010, Pilatus announced that the 1,000th PC-12 had been delivered. By August 2013, the worldwide PC-12 fleet had accumulated a combined total of 4 million flight hours and 1,200 PC-12s had been delivered to customers. Just over a year after the 1300th, the 1400th PC-12 was delivered in July 2016. As of July 2016, the fleet had accumulated 5.6 million total flight hours since certification and 1 million flight hours for the 630 PC-12 NG since its introduction in 2008. In May 2018, with the fleet having logged over 6.8 million hours, the maintenance interval was raised from 100/150 hours to 300 and a new maintenance plan reduced labor by 20% to 40% to lower direct operating costs.

By 2017, a nine-year-old PC-12 was worth $2.5-2.8 million and 15- to 16-year-old models had a $1.8 million value. Owner-operators account for 20% to 30% of the PC-12 sales, while they fly 90% of all SOCATA TBMs.

By October 2019, the PC-12 fleet surpassed 1,700 aircraft, with more than seven million total flight hours.
By May 2021, 1,800 had been delivered including 82 in 2020, having flown eight million hours. In May 2023 the fleet reached ten million flight hours, including 9.3 million landings. A total of 71 PC-12s had flown over 20,000 hours each, with the highest time aircraft over 35,000 hours.
On 12 May, the 2,000th was delivered as 80 were built in 2022 and Pilatus held a backlog for 63 units, while 1,889 examples were in service and 31 aircraft in storage.

In 2022, Tradewind Aviation marked a major fleet renewal and expansion program with the purchase of 20 new Pilatus PC-12 NGX aircraft in a deal valued at over $100 million, with deliveries proceeding at 3-4 per year through 2027. The program cements Tradewind&#x27;s status as the operator of one of the world&#x27;s largest fleets of Pilatus PC-12s, and the largest available for charter. Tradewind has operated all variants of variants of the PC-12, beginning in 2003.

===Military operations===
The PC-12 is Pilatus&#x27; first aircraft directed principally at the civil market. Despite the company historically being a military-oriented supplier, military sales for the type were considered a low priority during the early stages of development.

The U-28A Draco is the United States Air Force variant of the PC-12 for intratheater support of special operations forces performing the role of intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR). The U-28A is operated by the 319th Special Operations Squadron, stationed at Hurlburt Field, Florida, at the headquarters of the Air Force Special Operations Command. The 34th Special Operations Squadron was activated on 9 April 2010 as the second U-28A unit at Hurlburt Field. Both squadrons operate as part of the 1st Special Operations Wing/ 1st Special Operations Group at Hurlburt Field. The U-28A is also operated by the 318th Special Operations Squadron and the 310th Special Operations Squadron as part of the 27th Special Operations Wing at Cannon Air Force Base, New Mexico. In May 2019 the Air Force officially approved the use of the name &#x27;Draco&#x27; for the aircraft.

In August 2022, U.S. Special Operations Command announced it had selected the AT-802U Sky Warden for its Armed Overwatch program. The intent is for them to perform ISR and strike missions in uncontested airspace while operating from austere airfields. The Sky Warden will take over combat missions from the U-28A, as it is an aging and expensive aircraft that requires specialized equipment and training to maintain; it will however continue to provide ISR for operations like search and rescue and humanitarian relief after the Sky Warden is delivered.

The Finnish Air Force selected the PC-12 NG in 2009 to replace the service&#x27;s Piper Chieftains and Valmet L-90 Redigos in a liaison role. The aircraft were handed over to the Air Force in 2010. Six PC-12s are in service with the Finnish Air Force.

<doc id="914313" wikidata="Q2067349" url="?curid=914313" title="Bleacher">
<text>Bleachers (North American English), or stands, are raised, tiered rows of benches found at sports-fields and at other spectator events. Stairways provide access to the horizontal rows of seats, often with every other step enabling access to a row of benches.

Benches range from simple planks to elaborate ones with backrests. Many bleachers are open to the ground below so that there are only the planks to sit and walk on. Some bleachers have vertical panels beneath the benches, either partially or completely blocking the way to the ground.

== Name origins ==
The open seating area in baseball was called the &quot;bleaching boards&quot; as early as 1877. The term &quot;bleachers&quot; used in the sense of benches for spectators can be traced back to at least 1889; named as such because the generally uncovered wooden boards were &quot;bleached by the sun&quot;.

&quot;The Dickson Baseball Dictionary&quot; lists as a &quot;secondary&quot; definition the fans sitting in them. By the early 1900s, the term &quot;bleachers&quot; was being used for both the seating area and its occupants.

In modern usage, the term &quot;bleachers&quot;, which is not used outside North America, almost always refers only to the seating area, and those sitting there may be called &quot;bleacher fans&quot; or &quot;bleacherites&quot;. Terms such as Chicago&#x27;s &quot;bleacher bums&quot; or Yankee Stadium&#x27;s Bleacher Creatures are also used.

== Types ==
Bleachers structures vary depending on the location, but most outdoor modern bleachers have either an aluminium tube or steel angle understructure (known as frame-type bleachers) or steel I-beams (known as an I-beam bleacher). Most smaller bleachers are frame-type bleachers and most larger bleachers are I-Beam bleachers. Bleachers range in size from small, modular, aluminum stands that can be moved around soccer or hockey fields to large permanent structures that flank each side of an American football field. Some bleachers have locker rooms underneath them. In indoor gyms, bleachers can be built in so that they slide on a track or on wheels and fold in an accordion-like, stacking manner against the inside walls. This type is known as telescoping bleachers.

== Baseball ==
In ballparks, the bleachers are usually located beyond the outfield fences. However, center-field bleachers are located in the line of sight of the batter, and the presence of fans makes it difficult for the batter to pick out the ball. As a result, most stadiums have vacant areas or black backgrounds where the seats would be. This is known as either the &quot;backdrop&quot; or the batter&#x27;s eye. The old Yankee Stadium featured black-painted vacant bleachers, nicknamed &quot;the black&quot; by baseball fans.

Many ballparks, especially those in Minor League Baseball, offer only bleacher seating. In those that offer both seats and bleachers—such as in Major League Baseball—the bleachers are typically in less desirable locations and/or have lower ticket prices, giving the term &quot;bleachers&quot; a connotation of lower-class seating.

== American football ==
The popularity of American football has made seating on outdoor and indoor football fields a necessity. Professional football, colleges, high schools, and even middle schools have bleacher systems set up to accommodate spectators. Bleachers vary in size from wide, seating 25, all the way to full stadiums that seat thousands and wrap around the entire field. 
As one example of their dimensions, Crystal Lake South High School in Illinois built some football bleachers that were about high. American football bleachers are commonly made from concrete or aluminum with concrete footings or superstructure underneath.

<text>Peter Bowler was an Australian lexicographer and author of &quot;The Superior Person&#x27;s Book of Words&quot;, &quot;The Superior Person&#x27;s Second Book of Weird and Wondrous Words&quot;, and &quot;The Superior Person&#x27;s Third Book of Well-Bred Words&quot;. He specialized in esoteric, arcane, archaic, and otherwise unusual words, which he catalogued humorously in his three books, along with &quot;real-life&quot; situations in which such words might come in handy

A spare-time author, his main work lay in his forty years in education policy and management, in both public and private sectors. He was at various times: leader of Australian delegations to the Unesco/IBM World Conference on Public Education in Geneva and the Conference of Directors of Education in the South Pacific; member of Australian delegations to Commonwealth of Nations Education and Medical Conferences, Chairman of the Commonwealth of Nations Book Development Committee; member of the National Training Council and Australian Apprenticeship Advisory Committee; member of the Australian Council for Educational Research; member of Interim Councils for the Royal Military College and the National Maritime College; Australian representative on the OECD Education Committee and the International Council for Educational Media; Director of Further Education in the Australian Capital Territory; Director of the National Office of Youth Affairs; Deputy Principal of City International College, Sydney; Deputy CEO of St John Ambulance in Australia (he was an Officer of the Order of St John); and vice-president of the Abbey Museum of Art and Archaeology in Brisbane.

His books about words are published in the US by David R Godine of Boston and in the UK by Bloomsbury of London. His other books have included: &quot;The True Believers&quot; (about the world of lunatic cults and sects) ; The Pan paperback &quot;What a Way to Go&quot;; the crime novel &quot;Human Remains&quot;; &quot;The Creepy-Crawly&quot; (a book of verse for children) and &quot;Your Child From One to Ten&quot; (a manual for parents on child development). He also wrote and edited books on emergency care and its theoretical medical foundations. One or another book in the &quot;Superior Person&#x27;s&quot; series has been in print at all times since 1979.

In his later years Bowler suffered from Parkinson&#x27;s disease. He died at Caboolture Hospital on 25 July 2020 and is survived by his second wife Diane, and his two sons Denis and Ross.

==Selected passages==
*&quot;Circumambagious, &quot;a.&quot; – Employing a roundabout or indirect manner of speech. Not as effective, perhaps, on the whole, as an aid to obfuscation, as the sesquipedalianism fostered by this book, always assuming, if you will forgive a somewhat Jamesian digression (Henry, that is to say, in contradistinction to P.D.), that obfuscation is in fact the objective, and having in mind also that, setting aside the relative merits of the two different approaches toward that end, vis-a-vis each other, it can hardly be doubted that the employment of both together, as distinct from one or the other, must have a still greater obfuscatory, or perhaps more precisely, obscurantist, impact, a point well evidenced by the fact that this particular instance of circumambagiousness has, as I believe you will discover, successfully diverted your attention from the fact that nowhere in this admittedly now somewhat overlong sentence is there, despite its superabundance of subsidiary clauses, a principal subject or verb.&quot;

<doc id="914331" wikidata="Q3473693" url="?curid=914331" title="Pearblossom, California">
<text>Pearblossom is an unincorporated community located in the Antelope Valley of the Mojave Desert, in northern Los Angeles County, California, United States.

The town has a population of 2,435. The ZIP Code is 93553 and the community is inside area code 661. According to the Greater Antelope Valley Economic Alliance report of 2009, the &quot;Palmdale / Lancaster&quot; urbanized area has a population of 483,998, of which Pearblossom is a part.

==Geography==

Pearblossom is located about southeast of Palmdale in the Antelope Valley portion of southern California.
The name Pearblossom came from the multitude of local pear farms along the southern ridge of the Antelope Valley. A few still exist today, but most of those farms are now abandoned and have returned to the desert landscape or have been overridden by small-scale housing development.

Pearblossom is also a popular destination, for its annual Duck Races; convenient location for hiking in the foothills; and picturesque photo opportunities.

Pearblossom is well known by Southlanders as the site of one of the most dangerous roads in the US. State Route 138 (Pearblossom Highway) is the main street in Pearblossom and as of 2004 has been the location of numerous serious and fatal automobile accidents in its Palmdale to I-15 segment. Daily traffic on the recently expanded highway ranges from 25,000 to 30,000 vehicles, including many short &amp; long haul freight trucks. Overuse of Pearblossom Highway is chiefly on Friday evenings, Saturdays and Sundays, the time period many use the route to travel to Las Vegas. This section of 138&#x27;s route is commonly used as a bypass of the Los Angeles Metropolitan region, and as a route from the Antelope Valley to the Inland Empire. Highway 138 or Pearblossom Highway has been somewhat improved, now with three or four lanes along some segments, and some of the dips taken out of the highway in many of the most dangerous areas.

==Arts==
Pearblossom (in name only at present) is found in the following creative works:

* &quot;The Crows of Pearblossom,&quot; authored by Aldous Huxley
* Aldous Huxley&#x27;s home in the early 1940s was nearby in Llano and is now the filming location of Pearblossom Picture Ranch
* &quot;Pearblossom Highway,&quot; a photographic collage assembled by David Hockney
* The community is mentioned in &quot;I Love Dick,&quot; the 1997 novel by Chris Kraus

David Hockney&#x27;s photocollage &quot;Pearblossom Highway&quot; (1986) was actually photographed in the Littlerock rural vicinity; it, like Huxley&#x27;s &quot;The Crows of Pearblossom&quot;, is not about Pearblossom proper.

In 1997, Western actor Louis R. Faust died in his Pearblossom lodgings on highway 138. His son, Louis R. Faust Jr., expired there in 2010.

* Sam Crawford, Hall of Fame outfielder with the Cincinnati Reds and Detroit Tigers 
* George Lazenby, actor who, among other roles, portrayed James Bond
* George Voskovec

<text>Albuquerque Academy, known locally as simply the Academy, is an independent, co-educational day school for grades 6-12 located in Albuquerque, New Mexico. The school is accredited by the Independent Schools Association of the Southwest and the New Mexico State Department of Education, and is also a member of the National Association of Independent Schools.

The school has routinely ranked among the top 200 private high schools in the United States, peaking at #5 in 2015. Albuquerque Academy comprises three different divisions (groups of grade levels): the 6-7 division, the 8-9 division, and the 10-12 division.

==History==
Albuquerque Academy was founded in 1955 as The Academy for Boys in the basement of a small Albuquerque church by William B. S. Wilburn. The school was eventually moved into a facility that is today used by Sandia Preparatory School. In 1965, the school moved to its current site in northeast Albuquerque.

Between 1957 and 1964, the academy received a large tract of undeveloped land north of Albuquerque, part of the Elena Gallegos Land Grant, from the Albert G. Simms family. The western portion (from Wyoming Boulevard to the Rio Grande) was sold to finance the creation of the current campus and the first endowment fund, and the present campus was created in the middle of the tract. The land east of the campus, reaching the crest of the Sandia Mountains, was sold later in a series of deals. First, the section from the campus to Juan Tabo Boulevard was sold to create a second trust. Later, the City of Albuquerque attempted to facilitate a deal to sell the remainder to the Bureau of Land Management by putting up a parking garage as collateral. The deal fell through, and the academy became the garage owner while still retaining the area.

In July 1982, the city purchased most of the land in a complex deal with the academy and the US Forest Service. The City paid the academy $23.9 million, raised by a bond issue supported by a temporary ¼ percent sales tax. The City retained part of the land, which is now the Elena Gallegos Picnic Area/Albert G. Simms Park, located at the feet of the Sandias at the mouths of Bear and Pino Canyons. The plus remainder of the purchase, most of it forest land in the canyons proper, was sold to the Forest Service and is now part of the Cibola National Forest and the Sandia Mountain Wilderness. The academy retained two parts of the tract, the larger adjoining Tramway Boulevard. The school set up the High Desert Investment Corporation (HDIC) to develop this portion as the master-planned community known as High Desert. (The smaller portion, within Bear Canyon itself, is still used by the academy for experiential education purposes.) HDIC then purchased a large tract of land in the northern section of Rio Rancho, developed as Mariposa. The proceeds from the land sales and from HDIC have provided the academy with a substantial endowment, which is used partly to defray tuition expenses and to subsidize a significant need-based financial aid program. HDIC has since been dissolved.

The school remained an all-boys school, with grades five through 12, until 1973, at which time girls were allowed into grades nine through 12. Part of the reason for the delay in allowing girls and for the gradual inclusion was that the Simms grant specified that the number of boys not decrease in order to make room for girls. The fifth grade was dropped in 1979, and the school became fully coeducational in 1984.

Today, the academy has an enrollment of more than 1,100 in grades 6 through 12, with students drawn from throughout the Albuquerque metropolitan area and the state of New Mexico.
===Heads of school===
* William B. S. Wilburn, 1955–60
* Rev. Paul G. Saunders, 1960–64
* Ashby Harper, 1964–85
* Robert L. Bovinette, 1985–96

==Facilities==
The school sits on an approximately 312-acre (1.5 km2) gated campus in the northeastern part of the city. It is divided into two campuses, the West Campus and the East Campus. The two campuses are separated by about a quarter of a mile, with the library, science building, and athletic fields in between. The school buildings conform to a consistent Mediterranean-influenced architectural style, which incorporates brick buildings, arches, and tile roofs.

===West Campus===
The West Campus consists of eight buildings, including sixth- and seventh-grade classroom buildings, an administration building, a dining hall, and a gymnasium. In addition, the Visual Arts building and Natatorium are on the West Campus. All of the buildings except the Natatorium were designed by Robert McCabe of Flatow, Moore, Bryan, and Associates, and opened in 1984. The Natatorium was added to the West Campus Gymnasium in 1997.

===Simms Library===

The Dr. Albert G. Simms II and Barbara Young Simms Library (almost always shortened to &quot;Simms Library&quot;) is the academy&#x27;s most iconic building, housing the school&#x27;s collection of more than 140,000 books, periodicals, videos, and recordings. It has two wings that open onto a central lobby, with the fiction/nonfiction section housed in the larger north wing and reference materials in the east wing. The library was designed by Alexander &quot;Sandy&quot; Howe of the Boston firm of Shepley, Bulfinch, Richardson and Abbott and opened in 1991 along with the Science Building. The Library spire is the highest point on campus. The Head of School&#x27;s office, Admission office, and Common Grounds Cafe are also located in the library.

===Science Building===
The Science Building sits across a brick plaza from the Library. It houses the majority of the academy&#x27;s science classrooms, labs, and faculty, as well as some teachers from other departments. The building is made up of two classroom wings and two laboratory wings grouped around a square central courtyard, which includes a small pond, containing some small fish and aquatic pond snails. The main foyer houses a large Foucault pendulum. (Another smaller pendulum is located in Brown Hall on the East Campus). The Science Building was also designed by Howe and opened at the same time as the Library. It is adjacent to the Desert Oasis Teaching (DOT) Gardens, a resource that serves students and the community.

=== East Campus ===
The East Campus currently is home to grades 8–12. It includes the academy&#x27;s four original buildings, all grouped around a central quad: McKinnon Hall (formerly North Hall, the 8-9 classroom building), Brown Hall (the 10-12 classroom building), the Administration Building, and the gymnasium-dining hall complex. All were designed by Edward O. Holien of Holien and Buckley and completed in 1965. Also on the East Campus is the Simms Center for the Performing Arts, designed by George Pearl, completed in 1975, and remodeled in 2000; and the Music Building, designed by Bill Sabatini of Dekker/Perich/Sabatini and completed in 1996.

===Athletic facilities===
The academy&#x27;s largest sports facilities are the Athletic Field (used for football and soccer games and track and field meets), the East Campus Gym (basketball and volleyball), and the Natatorium (swimming and diving). There are also several soccer, baseball, and softball fields, a tennis complex, a cross country course, a weight room, and basketball courts. The Experiential Education department also constructed a pump (bicycle) track used by the summer program, PE classes, and Ex Ed students on the east end of campus.

===Experiential education===
The Academy curriculum includes a significant experiential education component, part of which involves outdoor activities such as backpacking, rock climbing, and canoeing. The school&#x27;s 270-acre (1.1 km2) tract in Bear Canyon is used for this purpose; trips also take place in areas throughout the state. The sixth-grade students take an overnight trip in Bear Canyon and go on day trips. The seventh graders go to Bear Canyon for four days and three nights. The eighth graders go on a half-week retreat together at the beginning of the year, and the ninth graders go on small-group remote backpacking trips in a regional wilderness area. The 10-12 students may take classes in outdoor leadership as well as kayaking, climbing, and mountain biking.

==Student body==
The school is roughly half boys and half girls, and more than one-half of the students self-identify as students of color or multicultural. The Academy also ranks among the top independent secondary schools with regard to need-based financial aid, supporting nearly one-quarter of the student body with a total of $4.9 million. In addition, the school has a 7:1 student/teacher ratio.

One member of the Class of 2024 was awarded the US Presidential Scholarship.

Seventeen members of the Class of 2025 were recognized as National Merit Semifinalists, and the class earned an average ACT score well above the national average. Individual honors for the senior class of 2025 included a Coolidge Scholarship recipient.

==Tuition==
The board of trustees sets tuition for each school year. While the current cost per student stands at approximately $35,000 per year, the endowment allows for a tuition cost of $28,149 including lunch fees. Book expenses range average $250-$500 per year depending on grade level. Financial aid is awarded based on a family&#x27;s demonstrated need and the student&#x27;s strengths relative to the applicant&#x27;s class.

==Extracurricular activities==
Extracurricular activities at the school include state championship sports teams, &quot;The Advocate&quot; (a student newsmagazine that has received numerous awards from the Albuquerque Tribune and the New Mexico Press Women), Science Olympiad, Science Bowl, and theater.

The longest sports state championship streaks by Academy sports teams are the 21-time defending state champion boys tennis team (2003–present); the eight-time defending state champion girls swim team (2007–present); and the six-time state champion boys basketball team (1989–1994), boys swim team (2006–2011), and boys track team (2002–2007).

The swim teams have won 48 combined state titles (24 for the boys, 24 for the girls).

The school&#x27;s mock trial team won the 2012 National High School Mock Trial Championship, marking the first time a New Mexican team had won the title, and the first time a team from the host state had won. In 2013, the team won the national championship again, which was only the third time in tournament history that a school won twice in a row. The program has qualified at least one team for state competition every year since the program was rebooted in 2005. In 2016, the team finished 4th in the national competition held in Boise, ID. In 2019, Academy&#x27;s mock trial team placed sixth at the National High School Mock Trial Championship. In 2021, the Academy&#x27;s mock trial team placed third at the National High School Mock Trial Championship. And in 2022 the team placed seventh in the nation as well. In 2023 the Academy&#x27;s mock trial team took second at the National High School Mock Trial Championship.

In 2023 and 2024, the Academy&#x27;s middle school and high school Science Olympiad teams both represented New Mexico at the national tournament at Michigan State University.

In May 2010, the school&#x27;s Science Bowl team won the US DOE Middle School Science Bowl competition in Washington, DC.

Previous Academy Science Bowl teams had finished second (in 2006) and fourth (in 2009). The middle school science bowl team most recently represented New Mexico at nationals in 2019.

At the 2009 New Mexico State Speech and Debate Tournament, Albuquerque Academy won Speech Sweepstakes, Debate Sweepstakes, and Debate Coach of the Year and had five state champions. The Speech and Debate team had held the state title for 24 straight years by 2010 (winning Speech Sweepstakes and Debate Sweepstakes and having many state champions). At the 2014 New Mexico State Speech and Debate Tournament, the Albuquerque Academy Speech and Debate team reclaimed the title by winning the Speech Sweepstakes and Debate Sweepstakes and having seven state champions. In 2019, 16 members of the team qualified for nationals, and the Academy was named Overall School of Excellence.

In 2022, 2023, and 2024, thespians from the Academy&#x27;s theatre program were selected to represent New Mexico&#x27;s Best Actress at the National High School Theatre Awards at Broadway&#x27;s Minskoff Theatre. In 2017 and 2018, the state&#x27;s Best Actor was a student from the Academy.

In the spring of 2006, the orchestra, the Chamber Players, was invited to attend the National Orchestra Festival in Kansas City, Missouri, where they received a superior rating.

<doc id="914333" wikidata="Q460516" url="?curid=914333" title="Damon Stoudamire">
<text>Damon Lamon Stoudamire (born September 3, 1973), nicknamed Mighty Mouse, is an American college basketball coach and former player who is currently the head coach for the Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets of the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC). The , point guard was selected with the 7th overall pick by the Toronto Raptors in the 1995 NBA draft and won the 1995–96 NBA Rookie of the Year Award. He played collegiately at the University of Arizona, and professionally for the Toronto Raptors, Portland Trail Blazers, Memphis Grizzlies and San Antonio Spurs.

==Early life==
Stoudamire was born to Willie Stoudamire and Liz Washington in Portland, Oregon; he was the only child, with three stepsisters; his parents never married. Willie Stoudamire moved away to Milwaukee, Wisconsin, to work in a brewery when Damon was seven years old. Stoudamire was raised by his mother, Liz, and his grandmother, Wanda Stoudamire-Matthews.

While Stoudamire was growing up, his uncles, Charles and Anthony Stoudamire, got him involved in sports, mainly basketball and football. They acted as fathers and personal coaches to Stoudamire in his younger years, as he grew up watching his favorite player, Nate Archibald, and attempted to pattern his game after his childhood hero. As he grew older, Stoudamire began to play basketball at Irving Park in the Portland–Irvington neighborhood and at the Matt Dishman Community Center in Portland.

Stoudamire attended Holy Redeemer grade school (a Catholic school) and Harriet Tubman Middle School, then attended Woodrow Wilson High School. During his junior year in high school, his grandmother Wanda died of cancer. He would later tattoo Wanda&#x27;s face and her address on his left arm in remembrance. He was expected to attend and play basketball at Oregon, but chose to attend Arizona instead.

==High school career==
Stoudamire attended Wilson High School (now Ida B. Wells-Barnett High School). Playing basketball for the Trojans, he led his team to a 74–4 record and state championships in 1989 and 1991.

For his career, he averaged 26.1 points, 9.2 assists, and 3.6 rebounds per game. He earned two Oregon Player of the Year awards and one Converse High School All-America Team selection during his senior year.

==College career==
Stoudamire played point guard for the Arizona Wildcats and coach, Lute Olson. He was a first-team All-American and finalist for College Player of the Year. He teamed with Khalid Reeves his junior year to lead the team to the Final Four. During his senior year he earned the All-American honors for his 22.8 points per game. He also finished his college career first on the Wildcats&#x27; all-time list in three-pointers made (272), second in points (1,849), fourth in assists (663), and was the only player in Arizona history to have two 40-point games. Stoudamire scored his career-high 45 points at Stanford University on January 14, 1995. He was named a 1995 Wooden Award finalist after sharing the Pac-10 Player of the Year award with Ed O&#x27;Bannon.

Despite being the youngest player on the roster of the United States men&#x27;s national basketball team, Stoudamire led the team in assists and steals en route to a gold medal at the 1993 Summer Universiade.

==Professional career==

=== Toronto Raptors (1995–1998) ===
Stoudamire made an impact with the Raptors before he ever set foot on the court for them. At the 1995 NBA draft held in Toronto, the fans in attendance chanted loudly for the Raptors to select UCLA standout Ed O&#x27;Bannon with their first ever draft pick, loudly booing when the team announced their first pick would be Stoudamire instead. Years later, Stoudamire would tell Maclean&#x27;s that the boos did not bother him, being extra motivation for him, with the fans turning around on him once they saw him play for the first time. Stoudamire would go on to a noteworthy rookie season with the Raptors, averaging 9.3 assists and 19 points per game. He earned the nickname &quot;Mighty Mouse&quot; because he stands only , and because he had a Mighty Mouse tattoo on his right arm going into his rookie season. He set the record for three-point field goals made by a rookie with 133 breaking the record at the time held by Dennis Scott. This record has been broken several times over since Stoudamire&#x27;s 133 mark. It is currently held by Keegan Murray, who made 206 threes in his rookie season. Stoudamire is third in assist average by a rookie. He ranked second in scoring among all rookies in 1995–96, and led all rookies in minutes played and assists. He received the Schick Rookie of the Month award twice and unanimously made the Schick All Rookie First Team, and eventually won the Rookie of the Year award, receiving 76 of the possible 113 votes, and the MVP award of the Rookie All-Star Game. He holds the record for being the third-lowest draft pick (7th overall) to ever win the Rookie of the Year award, with the lowest being Malcolm Brogdon (36th in the second round.) He is also known as the shortest player to ever win this award. He did not play the last 10 games of his rookie season due to tendinitis in his left knee. The Raptors finished that year and his rookie season with 21 wins and 61 losses.

Stoudamire previously held the record for most triple doubles with the Toronto Raptors with 3 triple doubles, a record that stood until 2014, when it was broken by Kyle Lowry.

=== Portland Trail Blazers (1998–2005) ===
Following the resignation of the Raptors&#x27; vice president, Isiah Thomas, Stoudamire readily demanded a trade. On February 13, 1998, he was traded by the Raptors along with Walt Williams and Carlos Rogers to the Portland Trail Blazers in exchange for Kenny Anderson, Alvin Williams, Gary Trent, two first-round draft picks, a second-round draft pick and cash considerations. During the first round of the 1998 NBA Playoffs, on April 26, 1998, Stoudamire scored 17 points and recorded 14 assists during a Game 2 loss to the Los Angeles Lakers. On December 28, 2000, Stoudamire scored 32 points and hit the game-winning shot with 0.4 seconds left during a 103–102 win over the Utah Jazz. In the 2002–03 season, the Blazers benched Stoudamire for most of the season. The new head coach, Maurice Cheeks, went with Scottie Pippen and Bonzi Wells instead at the guard positions. However, Stoudamire received significant playing time in the playoffs that season.

On January 14, 2005, Stoudamire hit a career-high and Blazers then-franchise record 54 points, which included 8 3-pointers, against the New Orleans Hornets. The same season, on April 15, he shot an NBA record 21 3-point attempts, making only 5 of them.

Stoudamire&#x27;s contract with the Blazers expired at the end of the 2004–05 season, and it became widely known that the Blazers, who were focusing on youth movement and looking for players with good character, had no intention of re-signing him. This became abundantly clear in August 2005, when the team signed free agent guard Juan Dixon to a contract, and assigned him Stoudamire&#x27;s uniform number (3). Stoudamire wanted the Blazers to work out a sign-and-trade deal whereby he would end up with the Houston Rockets, but since this would have required Portland to take one of Houston&#x27;s overpaid players in return and the team, at that time, had a relatively high payroll, Portland management decided to go in another direction with players like Travis Outlaw and Sebastian Telfair.

=== Memphis Grizzlies (2005–2008) ===
On August 5, 2005, after Stoudamire had been in discussions with several teams, it was announced he signed a 4-year deal with the Memphis Grizzlies, where he replaced Jason Williams, who left for the Miami Heat, as the starting point guard. On December 30, 2005, he tore his right patellar tendon, coincidentally in his hometown of Portland. He was carted off the court, and had successful surgery in Birmingham, Alabama the following week. He missed the rest of the 2005–06 season, returning for 2006–07, and ended up playing 62 games, of which he started 51 (evenly splitting point guard duties with veteran backup Chucky Atkins).

During the 2007–08 season, on NBA Access with Ahmad Rashad, he said that he was working hard with Mike Conley Jr., a 2007 draft pick by the Grizzlies, who, after Stoudamire had left, would play a major role as a point guard. When Conley returned from an injury, Grizzlies head coach Marc Iavaroni placed Stoudamire on the inactive list and used inexperienced rookie Mike Conley Jr. as the starting point guard, causing Stoudamire to look for a trade or a buyout. On January 26, 2008, the Grizzlies reached a tentative contractual buyout agreement with Stoudamire, with the San Antonio Spurs, Boston Celtics, Phoenix Suns, Denver Nuggets and Toronto Raptors registering strong interest in signing him. On January 28, the buyout was completed and Stoudamire was placed on waivers. The Celtics initially showed strong interest in Stoudamire but since set their sights on the Los Angeles Clippers&#x27; Sam Cassell. According to Stoudamire&#x27;s agent, Stoudamire was to sign with the Spurs.

===San Antonio Spurs (2008)===
On February 3, 2008, Stoudamire signed a contract with the San Antonio Spurs. He briefly started for the Spurs while Tony Parker was injured, but then was relegated to spot duty throughout the rest of the season and the playoffs.

Stoudamire considered going to camp with the Houston Rockets, but he did not attend training camp.

==Coaching==

=== Rice Owls men&#x27;s basketball team (2008–2009) ===
In December 2008, Stoudamire accepted a coaching position as director of player development for the guard-heavy Rice University Owls squad under head coach Ben Braun.

=== Memphis Grizzlies (2009–2011) ===
In February 2009, Stoudamire joined the coaching staff of the Grizzlies, along with Henry Bibby.

=== Return to college (2011–2021) ===
In May 2011, Stoudamire joined the coaching staff of the University of Memphis Tigers men&#x27;s basketball team, where his coaching and recruiting contributions were noted with enthusiasm during the &#x27;11-&#x27;12 season.

In May 2013, Stoudamire left Memphis to join the coaching staff of the Arizona Wildcats men&#x27;s basketball team.

In May 2015, Stoudamire left Arizona to rejoin the coaching staff of the Memphis Tigers men&#x27;s basketball team.

In March 2016, Stoudamire left Memphis to take over the head coaching position for the Pacific Tigers men&#x27;s basketball team.

Before Arizona hired Gonzaga men&#x27;s basketball assistant coach Tommy Lloyd to be their next head coach, Stoudamire was considered among the favorites to be the next coach at his alma mater.

=== Boston Celtics (2021–2023) ===
In July 2021, Stoudamire left Pacific to accept an assistant coach position with the Boston Celtics.

=== Georgia Tech (2023–present) ===
On March 13, 2023, Stoudamire was announced as the new head coach of the Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets. Damon Stoudamire became the first Tech coach in the Yellow Jackets’ ACC history to defeat Duke in his first try when the Yellow Jackets stunned the then seventh ranked Blue Devils 72–68 on December 2, 2023. He became the third coach in ACC history to beat Duke and North Carolina in his first year when on January 30, 2024, Tech beat #3 UNC 74–73 in front of a sold out McCamish Pavilion crowd.

==Head coaching record==




==Personal life==
Stoudamire is the cousin of former NBA players Salim Stoudamire and Terrence Jones, and current NBA player Grant Williams. He is also the nephew of former Portland State University quarterback Anthony Stoudamire and former Portland State University halfback Charles Stoudamire.

===Marijuana possession===
Stoudamire&#x27;s stint with the Portland Trail Blazers was marred by several marijuana-related incidents, including one during the 2002–03 season where, with then-starting power forward Rasheed Wallace, his yellow Hummer was pulled over on Interstate 5 for speeding and driving under the influence of marijuana. In July 2003, after Stoudamire&#x27;s third arrest for marijuana possession, he was fined $250,000 and was suspended by the team for three months. Blazers president Steve Patterson announced that he wanted to void Stoudamire&#x27;s contract, but did not find a provision in the contract that would allow him to do so.

Stoudamire completed a 90-day rehabilitation program. In addition, he made an agreement with &quot;The Oregonian&quot; sports columnist John Canzano to take an unannounced urine test during any point of the 2003–04 season to prove his sobriety. Midway through the season, Canzano appeared in the team locker room and produced a specimen bottle which Stoudamire filled. An independent testing laboratory reported back the result that he was indeed clean. The incident rehabilitated Stoudamire in the minds of many Portland fans, who had come to regard him as one of the &quot;Jail Blazers&quot;. However, Stoudamire was criticized by the National Basketball Players Association for the drug test, which claimed that NBA players may only submit to such tests as prescribed by the NBA Collective Bargaining Agreement. The fact that the test was voluntary, and not administered by the league or any of its teams, did not make Stoudamire immune to such criticism. Despite the criticism, no official action was taken by the union against Stoudamire for his participation in the test.

In an interview on The Post Game Podcast after retiring, Stoudamire voiced his frustration with how the city received the team and the incident, saying he and his teammates &quot;Were just kids&quot; when it happened.

<text>Bidar ( ) is a city and headquarters of the Bidar district in Karnataka state of India. Bidar is a prominent place on the archaeological map of India, it is well known for architectural, historical religious and rich heritage sites. Picturesquely perched on the Deccan plateau, the Bidar fort is more than 500 years old and still standing strong. According to the book &quot;Bidar Heritage&quot; published by the state &quot;Department of Archaeology, Museums and Heritage&quot;, of the 61 monuments listed by the department, about 30 are tombs located in and around Bidar city., explaining its nickname, &quot;City of Whispering Monuments&quot;. The heritage sites in and around Bidar have become the major attraction for film shooting in recent years, with Bollywood making visits apart from Kannada film industry

Bidar is home for the second biggest Indian Air Force training centre in the country. The IAF Station Bidar is used for advanced jet training of prospective fighter pilots on BAe Hawk aircraft.

Bidar city is known for its Bidri handicraft products, and its rich history. Bidar is also considered one of the holiest place for Sikh pilgrimage. Unlike other places in the region, Bidar is the coldest and wettest place in north Karnataka. For the year 2009–10, Bidar was ranked 22nd among the cleanest cities in India, and 5th cleanest in Karnataka. SH4 passes through Bidar and the whole city is integrated with 4 lane road.

== Etymology ==
The name Bidar appears to be derived from Kannada word ‘bidiru’, which means bamboo. It was also referred as &quot;Bhadrakot&quot;.

Legend has associated Bidar with the ancient kingdom of Vidarbha, to which references are found in early Hindu literature like &quot;Malavikagnimitra, Mahabharata, the Harivamsa, Bhagavata&quot;, and a few other &quot;Puranas&quot;. Its association can be seen apparently on account of the similarity in names &quot;Bidar&quot; and &quot;Vidarbha&quot;. This has been mentioned in Firishta&#x27;s writings.

The traditional tales reveal that Vidura lived here; hence the place was earlier called Viduranagara and also as the place where Nala and Damayanti (Daughter of &quot;Raja Bhima&quot;, the King of Vidharba) were meeting.

Bidar under the rule of the Bahmani Sultanate was known as Muhammadabad.

== History ==

The recorded History of the city goes back to the third century B.C. when it was a part of the Mauryan Empire. After the Mauryas, Satavahanas, Kadamba and Chalukyas of Badami and later the Rashtrakutas reigned over Bidar territory. The Chalukyas of Kalyana and Kalachuris of Kalyanis also regained the area. For a short period after Kalyani Chalukyas the area of Bidar was under the rule of Seunas of Devagiri and Kakatiyas of Warangal.

=== Bahmani Sultanate ===

The Delhi Sultanate invaded the area first by Allauddin Khilji, and later, Muhammed-bin-Tughluq took control of entire Deccan including Bidar. In the middle of the 14th century, the Sultan of Delhi&#x27;s officers that were stationed in Deccan rebelled and this resulted in the establishment of Bahmanid Dynasty in 1347 A.D. at Gulbarga/Hasanabad (present Kalaburagi). There was frequent warfare between the Bahmanids and the Vijaynagar Kingdom.

The history of the present fort at Bidar is attributed to the sultan Ahmed Shah Wali Bahmani, the sultan of the Bahmani dynasty till 1427, when he shifted his capital from Gulbarga to Bidar since it had better climatic conditions and was also a fertile and fruit-bearing land. The earliest recorded history of its existence as a small and strong fort is also traced to prince Ulugh Khan in 1322, whereafter it came under the reign of the Tughlaq dynasty.

With the establishment of the Bahmanid dynasty (1347), Bidar was occupied by Sultan Ala-ud-Din Bahman Shah Bahmani. During the rule of Ahmad Shah I (1422–1486), Bidar was made the capital city of Bahmani Kingdom. The old fort was rebuilt and madrasas, mosques, palaces, and gardens were raised. Mahmud Gawan, who became the prime minister in 1466, was a notable figure in the history of Bidar. Bidar remained under the Barid Shahi dynasty until conquest by the Bijapur Sultanate in 1619.
Aurangzeb came to Bidar after his father, Padshah (emperor) Shah Jahan, appointed him the Prince of Deccan. He wrested the Bidar Fort from the Adil Shahis after a 21-day war in 1656. With this, Bidar became a part of the Mughal dynasty for the second time. Bidar was made a subah (imperial top-level province) in 1656, which Telangana Subah was merged into the next year.

In 1724, Bidar became a part of the Asaf Jahi Kingdom of the Nizams. Third son of Asaf jah l ( Nizam l ) Mir Sa&#x27;id Muhammad Khan, Salabat Jang ruled from Bidar fort from 1751 to 1762, till his brother Mir Nizam Ali Khan Asaf Jah III imprisoned him in this fort, and was killed in Bidar fort on 16 September 1763. &quot;Mohammedabad&quot; old name of Bidar is also on his name. It was connected to Hyderabad by rail in the early 20th century. After India&#x27;s independence, in 1956 all Kannada speaking areas were merged to form the Mysore State and Bidar became part of the new Mysore (now Karnataka) state.

==== Karez System ====

Ancient Karez System in the city have been recently discovered. The Karez (Qanat) is an underground network of aqueducts for water supply. The Bidar Karez, built in the 15th century, is more than long with 21 air vents. Underground canals, built to connect underground water streams, were meant to provide drinking water to civilian settlements and the garrison inside the Bidar fort. This was necessary in a city where the soil was rocky and drilling wells was difficult. The Bidar karez systems, believed to be the earliest ones in India, were constructed during the Bahmani period. According to Gulam Yazdani&#x27;s documentation, Bidar has three karez systems: Naubad, Shukla Theerth, and Jamna Mori. Among these, Shukla Theerth stands out as the longest karez system in Bidar. The origin well of this karez was found near Gornalli Kere, a historic embankment. Jamna Mori, on the other hand, primarily served as a distribution system within the old city, with numerous channels intersecting the city streets.

Restoration efforts began in 2014, focusing on the desilting and excavation of the Naubad Karez. In 2015, this initiative led to the discovery of 27 vertical shafts connected to the Karez. The rejuvenation of these systems has had a significant positive impact on Bidar, a city facing water scarcity. Additionally, in 2016, during a sewage line excavation, a seventh line of the system was uncovered.

== Geography ==
Bidar is located at , lies at a central position in Deccan, a plateau at an elevation of 2300 ft from the sea level. It has common boundaries with Maharashtra and Telangana which is, with the districts of Nizamabad and Medak in Telangana on the East and the districts of Latur, Nanded and Osmanabad in Maharashtra on the west. On the south lies the district Gulbarga of Karnataka.

=== Geology ===

The upper crust of the plateau is of laterite, a soft porous rock with limonitic surface. This crust varies in depth from to and rests on a bed of trap, which is of much harder texture and less pervious to water. The volume of water filtered during the monsoons through the laterite stratum is arrested by the trappean bed, and a nursery of springs is formed whose natural level of effluence is the line of contact of the two strata along the base of the cliffs of the plateau. The water in course of time frets out for itself an orifice and macerates and loosens portions of its rocky channel till a rift is produced. The rift gradually dilates into a ravine, and the ravine expands into a vale.

The Karez System is built along a geological fracture. Such fractures are formed at the intersection of laterite and basalt rocks and form lineaments or springs that yield water.

=== Soil ===
Bidar soils are deep (&gt;100 cm), well-drained gravelly red clayey soils developed on plateaus of laterites. They are &quot;slightly&quot; acid to neutral (pH 6.6) in reaction with low cation exchange capacity. They are highly gravelly soils with gravel content (60 to 10%) that decrease with depth.

=== Climate ===
The winter season is from November to middle of February. Bidar is one of the coldest cities (by southern standards) in Karnataka as the minimum temperature during winter nights regularly hovers around 11-12 during December, which is the coldest month with mean daily maximum temperature of 27.3 C and mean daily minimum of 13.4 C. From the middle of the February, both day and night temperatures begin to rise rapidly. May is the hottest month with mean daily maximum temperature of 38.8 C and mean daily minimum of 25.9 C. With the withdrawal of southwest monsoon in the first week of October, there is slight increase in day temperature but night temperature decreases steadily. After October, both day and night temperatures decreases progressively. The highest maximum temperature recorded at Bidar was on 8-5-1931(43.3-degree C) and the lowest minimum was on 5-1-1901(2.9-degree C, the lowest temperature ever recorded in Karnataka).

Present day Bidar covers an expanse of 5448 square kilometres of land and lies between 17°35&#x27; and 18°25&#x27; North latitudes and 76°42&#x27; and 77°39&#x27; east longitudes.

== Demographics ==
At the time of the 2011 census, Bidar had a population of 216,020. Bidar city has a sex ratio of 938 females to males and a literacy rate of 85.90%. Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes made up 14.11% and 4.73% of the population respectively.
At the time of the 2011 census, 52.23% of the population spoke Kannada, 33.32% Urdu, 5.54% Marathi, 3.67% Hindi and 3.33% Telugu as their first language.

==Economy==
Once a home to many cottage industries, such as cotton and oil-ginning mills, there are now few industries that draw on local raw materials or skills. Even the well known form of local articrafts, bidri ware, is in a state of decline. Increasing prices of materials, especially silver, and declining sales have meant that many of the hereditary artisans are no longer employed in the production of such ware. Bidar city has a large industrial area known as Kolhar industrial area.

==Tourism==

Bidar is symbolically described as &quot;City of Whispering Monuments&quot;. The mountaintop city that served as the capital of medieval Deccan, has 98 monuments of which four national monuments are protected by the Archaeological Survey of India and 14 by the State Archaeology Department, Karnataka.

Bidar earned a place on the World Monument Watchlist 2014. Of the 741 proposals received from 166 countries, 67 sites from 41 countries were finally selected which were announced by WMF president Bonnie Burnham in New York on 8 October 2013. Along with &quot;the historic city of Bidar&quot;, two other sites in India to figure in the list were the house of Sheikh Salim Chisti in Fatehpur Sikri and Juna Mahal in Rajasthan.

The WMF in its &quot;current watch site&quot; for &quot;the historic city of Bidar&quot; says ″challenges to the site include a lack of integrated conservation and maintenance, environmental pollution, and the construction of new developments and roadways that encroach on the historic fabric. Current land use regulations also threaten the economic livelihood of many of the city&#x27;s residents, and it is hoped that revised, context-specific planning policies would both protect Bidar&#x27;s historic assets while also supporting the future of its local population. It is hoped that Watch-listing will spur documentation and analysis of the city&#x27;s conditions, followed by policy development and applied conservation interventions that will reveal and maintain Bidar&#x27;s rich heritage, as well as support a robust and sustainable tourist industry.″
