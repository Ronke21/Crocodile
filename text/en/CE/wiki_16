<text>Cyclohexene is a hydrocarbon with the formula . It is a cycloalkene. At room temperature, cyclohexene is a colorless liquid with a sharp odor. Among its uses, it is an intermediate in the commercial synthesis of nylon.

==Production and uses==
Cyclohexene is produced by the partial hydrogenation of benzene, a process developed by the Asahi Chemical company. The main product of the process is cyclohexane because cyclohexene is more easily hydrogenated than benzene.

In the laboratory, it can be prepared by dehydration of cyclohexanol.

==Reactions and uses==
Benzene is converted to cyclohexylbenzene by acid-catalyzed alkylation with cyclohexene. Cyclohexylbenzene is a precursor to both phenol and cyclohexanone.

Hydration of cyclohexene gives cyclohexanol, which can be dehydrogenated to give cyclohexanone, a precursor to caprolactam.

The oxidative cleavage of cyclohexene gives adipic acid. Hydrogen peroxide is used as the oxidant in the presence of a tungsten catalyst. 

1,5-Hexadiene is produced by ethenolysis of cyclohexene. Bromination gives 1,2-dibromocyclohexane.

== Structure ==
Cyclohexene is most stable in a half-chair conformation, unlike the preference for a chair form of cyclohexane. One basis for the cyclohexane conformational preference for a chair is that it allows each bond of the ring to adopt a staggered conformation. For cyclohexene, however, the alkene is planar, equivalent to an eclipsed conformation at that bond.

<text>Jereboam Orville Beauchamp (; September 6, 1802 – July 7, 1826) was an American lawyer who murdered the Kentucky legislator Solomon P. Sharp; the crime is known as the Beauchamp–Sharp Tragedy. In 1821, Sharp had been accused in Bowling Green, Kentucky by Anna Cooke of fathering her illegitimate child; it was stillborn. Sharp denied paternity, and public opinion favored him. In 1824, Beauchamp married Cooke, who was seventeen years his senior. She asked him to kill Sharp to defend her honor.

When Sharp campaigned in 1825 for a seat in the Kentucky House of Representatives, opponents revived the story of his alleged illegitimate child by Cooke. They distributed campaign literature claiming the child was mulatto. Enraged, Beauchamp renewed his intention to avenge his wife&#x27;s honor. In the early morning of November 7, 1825, he tricked Sharp to open the door at his home in Frankfort, and fatally stabbed him.

Beauchamp was convicted of the murder and sentenced to hang. The morning of the execution, he and his wife attempted a double suicide by stabbing themselves with a knife she had smuggled into prison. She died from the attempt; he did not. Beauchamp was rushed to the gallows before he could bleed to death, and was hanged on July 7, 1826. The bodies of Jereboam and Anna Beauchamp were arranged in an embrace and buried in a single coffin, as they had requested. The Beauchamp–Sharp Tragedy inspired fictional works such as Edgar Allan Poe&#x27;s unfinished play, &quot;Politian&quot;, and Robert Penn Warren&#x27;s &quot;World Enough and Time&quot; (1950).

==Early life==
Jereboam Beauchamp was born September 6, 1802, in the area that is now Simpson County, Kentucky. He was the second son of Thomas and Sally (Smithers) Beauchamp. Both parents were devout Christians. He was named after a paternal uncle, Jereboam O. Beauchamp, a state senator from Washington County.

Beauchamp was educated at Dr. Benjamin Thurston&#x27;s academy in Barren County, Kentucky until the age of sixteen. Recognizing that his father could not sufficiently provide for the family, Beauchamp found work as a shopkeeper to earn money for his education. While he saved money, he did not have enough time to pursue his studies. Recommended by Thurston, Beauchamp became preceptor of a school. After saving more money, he returned to Thurston&#x27;s school as a student. He later worked for the school as an usher.

By age eighteen, Beauchamp had finished his preparatory studies. After observing the lawyers practicing in Glasgow and Bowling Green, he decided to pursue a career in the legal profession. 
He particularly admired Solomon Sharp, a young lawyer in his thirties in Bowling Green, with whom Beauchamp hoped to study. In 1820, Beauchamp became disenchanted with Sharp when rumors surfaced that he had fathered an illegitimate child with Anna Cooke, a planter&#x27;s daughter who lived in Bowling Green. Sharp denied paternity of the child, which was stillborn.

==Courtship of Anna Cooke==

Beauchamp left Bowling Green to live at his father&#x27;s plantation in Simpson County, Kentucky, where he convalesced from an illness. He learned that Cooke had become a recluse nearby at her mother&#x27;s plantation after her public disgrace. Having heard from a mutual friend about her beauty and accomplishments, he decided to meet Cooke. At first, she rejected all attention, but gradually received Beauchamp under his guise of borrowing books from her library. The two eventually became friends, and, in 1821, began courting. Beauchamp was eighteen years old; Cooke was at least thirty-five.

When he proposed marriage that year, Cooke told Beauchamp she would marry him on the condition that he kill Sharp. Beauchamp consented. Against Cooke&#x27;s advice, Beauchamp traveled immediately to the capital of Frankfort, where Sharp had recently been appointed attorney general by the governor.

==Challenges==
According to Beauchamp&#x27;s account, he found Sharp and challenged him to a duel, but Sharp refused because he was not armed. Wielding a knife, Beauchamp took out a second knife and offered it to Sharp, who again declined the challenge. When Beauchamp challenged him a third time, Sharp tried to flee, but Beauchamp caught him by the collar. Sharp fell to his knees and begged Beauchamp to spare his life. Beauchamp kicked him, cursed him for a coward, and threatened to horsewhip him until he agreed to a duel. The next day, Beauchamp looked for Sharp in the streets of Frankfort, but was told he had left for Bowling Green. He went to Bowling Green, only to learn that Sharp was not there. Finally he returned to the home of Anna Cooke.

Following Beauchamp&#x27;s failed attempt, Cooke decided to lure Sharp to her house and kill him herself. Beauchamp wanted to take action to defend her honor, but she was determined to act for herself. He began teaching her to shoot a gun. Learning that Sharp was in Bowling Green, Cooke sent him a letter condemning Beauchamp&#x27;s attempt on his life and asking to see him again. Sharp suspected a trap, but replied that he would meet her at the planned time. Hoping to kill Sharp before the meeting, Beauchamp traveled to Bowling Green, but found his target had already left for Frankfort. He had eluded the trap. Beauchamp decided to finish his legal studies in Bowling Green and wait for Sharp to return there.

Beauchamp was admitted to the bar in April 1823. He and Anna Cooke married in June 1824. Still determined to defend the honor of his wife, Beauchamp devised a ruse to lure Sharp to Bowling Green. He wrote letters to Sharp under various pseudonyms, each asking for his help in some sort of legal matter, and each sent from a different post office. When Sharp failed to respond, Beauchamp decided to go to Frankfort again and confront him.

==Murder of Solomon Sharp==
In Frankfort in 1825, Sharp was in the middle of a bitter political battle known as the Old Court-New Court controversy. He identified with the New Court, or Relief party, which promoted a legislative agenda favorable to debtors. In opposition was the Old Court, or Anti-Relief party, which worked to secure the rights of creditors to collect debts. Sharp had served as the state&#x27;s attorney general under New Court governors John Adair, whose term lasted until August 1824, and Joseph Desha, who succeeded him in office. The New Court party&#x27;s power was beginning to wane.

In 1825, Sharp resigned to run for a seat in the Kentucky House of Representatives. During the heated campaign, opponents raised the issue of his alleged seduction of Anna Cooke. Old Court partisan John U. Waring had handbills distributed that alleged that Sharp had denied paternity of Cooke&#x27;s illegitimate child because it was a mulatto and likely fathered by a Cooke family slave. Sharp won the election, defeating John J. Crittenden.

Whether Sharp had made the claim is uncertain, but Beauchamp believed he had. He planned to murder him and flee with Anna to Missouri. He would murder Sharp in the early morning of November 7, 1825, when the new legislature convened its session, as he hoped that suspicion would fall on Sharp&#x27;s political enemies. Three weeks prior to that date, Beauchamp sold his property, telling his friends that he was planning to move to Missouri. He hired laborers to help load his wagons two days before the planned murder.

Beauchamp&#x27;s plan was complicated by a warrant sworn out against him by Ruth Reed. She sued him for support of her illegitimate son, born on June 10, 1824, claiming he was the father. Beauchamp later said he had ignored the warrant, dated October 25, 1825, on the advice of a friend who termed it harassment. He also said he had arranged for the warrant, as an excuse to be in Frankfort to kill Sharp. The historian Fred Johnson says that Beauchamp likely added the warrant into his story after the fact, as a means of damage control. It hardly looked good for him to have committed the act for which he ostensibly killed Sharp.

In preparation, Beauchamp packed a change of clothes, a black mask, and a knife with poison on the tip, to be used as the murder weapon. Finding all the inns filled when he arrived at Frankfort, he took lodging at the residence of Joel Scott, warden of the state penitentiary. Between nine and ten o&#x27;clock that evening, Beauchamp went to Sharp&#x27;s home. Dressed in disguise, he carried his usual clothes and buried them along the bank of the Kentucky River for retrieval following the murder. Discovering that Sharp was not home, Beauchamp looked for him in the city, finding him at a local tavern. He returned to Sharp&#x27;s house to wait for him, and saw him return at midnight.

At two o&#x27;clock in the morning, Beauchamp thought the household was quiet. In his &quot;Confession&quot;, he described the murder of Sharp:


Sharp died within moments. Fleeing the scene, Beauchamp went to the river to retrieve his clothes, where he changed and sank his disguise in the river with a stone. He returned to his room at the house of Joel Scott.

When the Scott family awoke the next morning, Beauchamp emerged from his quarters. He feigned surprise when told of the murder and was apparently believed at the time. After being told there were no suspects yet, he called for his horse and began his return trip of four days to Bowling Green. Arriving, he told his wife Anna that Sharp was dead. The next morning, a posse from Frankfort arrived and told Beauchamp that he was under suspicion for the murder. He agreed to return with the men to Frankfort and face the charge.

==Trial for murder==
Beauchamp arrived in Frankfort on November 15, 1825. New Court partisans talked of Sharp&#x27;s murder as the work of the Old Court party, just as Beauchamp had hoped. One suspect was Waring, who had printed the handbills critical of Sharp. Known as a violent man, he had both political and personal motivation for the crime. He was cleared of suspicion when investigators learned that, at the time of the murder, Waring was in Fayette County recovering from unrelated injuries.

Suspicion moved to Beauchamp, as he was loyal to the Old Court Party, and was known to hate Sharp for his political principles. People knew of Sharp&#x27;s earlier alleged involvement with Anna Cooke before her marriage to Beauchamp. Witnesses placed Beauchamp in Frankfort the night of the killing, and his host, Joel Scott, said that he had heard Beauchamp leave the house during the night. After presenting preliminary testimony, Commonwealth&#x27;s Attorney Charles Bibb asked for additional time to assemble more witnesses. Beauchamp assented to the request. A second delay pushed the hearings back to mid-December.

The dagger taken from Beauchamp at his arrest did not match the wound on Sharp&#x27;s body. (In his &quot;Confession&quot;, Beauchamp claimed to have buried the murder weapon by the bank of the river near where the murder took place. That knife was never found). Beauchamp&#x27;s shoe did not match a track found outside Sharp&#x27;s house the morning of the murder. The posse lost a handkerchief found at the scene of the crime and believed to belong to the murderer. (Beauchamp later claimed to have stolen and burned it after the posse had gone to sleep one night).

Several witnesses testified against him. The widow Eliza Sharp testified that the voice of the killer was distinct. A test was devised allowing Mrs. Sharp to hear Beauchamp&#x27;s voice; she immediately identified it as that of the killer. (Beauchamp claimed he had disguised his voice on the night of the murder and thought Mrs. Sharp would not recognize it). Patrick Henry Darby, an Old Court partisan, claimed that in 1824, he had a chance encounter with the man he now knew as Beauchamp. Darby said the man – a stranger to him at the time – had asked for Darby&#x27;s help in prosecuting an unspecified claim against Sharp. The man then identified himself as the husband of Anna Cooke and said he intended to kill Sharp. Based on the circumstantial evidence, Beauchamp was held for trial at the next term of the circuit court in March 1826.
Beauchamp&#x27;s uncle Jereboam assembled a legal team for his nephew that included former U.S. Senator John Pope. The grand jury convened in March and returned an indictment against Beauchamp for Sharp&#x27;s murder. Giving Beauchamp the time he requested to gather witnesses, the court scheduled a special session in May specifically for his trial.

Beauchamp&#x27;s trial began May 8, 1826. After a change of venue was denied, Beauchamp pleaded innocent to the charge against him. A jury was empaneled, and testimony began May 10. Eliza Sharp recounted the events of the night of the murder and reiterated that Beauchamp&#x27;s voice was that of the murderer. John Lowe, a magistrate of Simpson County, testified that he had heard Beauchamp threaten to kill Sharp, and said that on Beauchamp&#x27;s return from Frankfort, he saw him waving a red flag and heard him tell his wife that he had &quot;gained the victory&quot;. Patrick Darby repeated his testimony of the 1824 meeting between him and Beauchamp. Darby said that Beauchamp had told him that Sharp offered him one thousand dollars, a slave girl, and of land if he and his wife Anna would leave him (Sharp) alone. As Sharp had apparently reneged on the promise, Beauchamp told Darby he was going to kill the man. Other witnesses testified that Beauchamp habitually referred to Sharp&#x27;s friend, John W. Covington, as &quot;John A. Covington&quot;, the name used by the murderer to gain entry to Sharp&#x27;s house.

Testimony in the trial concluded on May 15, 1826; summations concluded four days later. Despite the lack of physical evidence, the jury deliberated only an hour before convicting Beauchamp of Sharp&#x27;s murder. He was sentenced to death by hanging on June 26 of that year. Beauchamp requested a stay of execution to write a justification for his actions. The stay was granted, and the execution was rescheduled for July 7, 1826. Though Anna Beauchamp was questioned, a charge against her for being an accessory to the crime was dismissed.

==Execution by hanging==
While imprisoned and awaiting execution, Beauchamp wrote a confession. He accused Patrick Darby of perjury with regard to the alleged 1824 meeting between them. Many believed Beauchamp&#x27;s accusation was meant to curry favor with New Court governor Joseph Desha – who considered Darby a political enemy – and to secure a pardon from him. When Beauchamp finished the confession in mid-June 1826, his uncle, Senator Beauchamp, took it to the state printer for immediate publication. An Old Court supporter, the printer refused to publish it.

Anna Beauchamp joined her husband in his cell in the dungeon; the only entry was through a trap door at the top of the room. During their incarceration, they tried to bribe a guard into allowing them to escape. When that failed, they tried to pass a letter to Senator Beauchamp asking for help to escape, an attempt which likewise failed. Both the senator and the younger Beauchamp asked for a pardon from Governor Desha, but to no avail. Beauchamp&#x27;s final request to Desha for a stay of execution was rejected July 5, 1826. With the last hope exhausted, the couple attempted a double suicide by drinking a vial of laudanum which Anna had smuggled into the cell. Both survived. The following morning, Jereboam and Anna were put on suicide watch and threatened with separation.

The night before the execution, Anna took a second dose of laudanum but was unable to keep it down. On July 7, 1826, the morning of the scheduled execution, Anna asked the guard to give her privacy to dress. Once the guard left, Anna revealed to Beauchamp that she had smuggled in a knife, and she and her husband stabbed themselves. Anna was taken to a nearby house to be treated by doctors.

Too weak to stand or walk, Beauchamp was loaded onto a cart to be conveyed to the gallows. He begged to see Anna, but the guards told him she was not seriously injured. The guards finally allowed him to see Anna, and Beauchamp was angered that they had underplayed her critical condition. He stayed with her until he could no longer feel her pulse; then the guards took him to the gallows to be hanged before he died of his stab wounds.

Beauchamp asked to see Patrick Darby, who was among the assembled 5,000 spectators. Beauchamp smiled and offered his hand, but Darby declined the gesture. Beauchamp publicly denied that Darby had any involvement with Sharp&#x27;s murder, but accused him of having lied about their 1824 meeting. Darby denied the death march accusation and tried to get Beauchamp to retract it, but the prisoner was moved on to the gallows.
Two men supported Beauchamp as the noose was put around his neck. He asked for a drink of water, and the band to play &quot;Bonaparte&#x27;s Retreat from Moscow&quot;. At his signal, the cart moved out from under him, and he died after a brief struggle. His father requested his body. Following Beauchamp&#x27;s earlier instructions, he had the bodies of Jereboam and Anna arranged in an embrace and buried them in the same coffin. A poem written by Anna was etched on their double tombstone.

Senator Beauchamp eventually found a publisher for his nephew&#x27;s &quot;Confession&quot;. The first printing ran on August 11, 1826. Sharp&#x27;s brother, Dr. Leander Sharp, attempted to counter Beauchamp&#x27;s &quot;Confession&quot; with &quot;Vindication of the Character of the late Col. Solomon P. Sharp&quot;, which he wrote in 1827. In this book, Dr. Sharp claimed to have seen a &quot;first version&quot; of the confession in which Beauchamp implicated Darby. Darby threatened to sue Dr. Sharp if he published &quot;Vindication&quot;, and John Waring threatened to kill him if he did so. Sharp did not release the manuscript and hid it in his house. The completed printed version was found in 1877 during a remodel of Sharp&#x27;s house.

==In popular culture==
*Edgar Allan Poe&#x27;s play, &quot;Politian&quot;, was based on the events above.
*Robert Penn Warren&#x27;s &quot;World Enough and Time&quot; was also inspired by them.

<text>Arthur John Arberry (12 May 1905, in Portsmouth – 2 October 1969, in Cambridge) FBA was a British scholar of Arabic literature, Persian studies, and Islamic studies. He was educated at Portsmouth Grammar School and Pembroke College, Cambridge. His English translation of the Qur&#x27;an, &quot;The Koran Interpreted&quot;, is popular amongst academics worldwide.

==Academic career==
Arberry served as Head of the Department of Classics at Cairo University in Egypt. He eventually returned home to become the Assistant Librarian at the Library of the India Office. During the Second World War he was a Postal Censor in Liverpool and was then seconded to the Ministry of Information, which was housed in the newly constructed Senate House of the University of London. Arberry held the Chair of Persian at the School of Oriental and African Studies SOAS, University of London, in 1944–47. He subsequently became the Sir Thomas Adams&#x27;s Professor of Arabic at Cambridge University and a Fellow of Pembroke College, Cambridge, his alma mater, from 1947 until his death in 1969. He is buried in Ascension Parish, Cambridge, together with his wife Sarina Simons Arberry (1900-1973). She was Romanian by birth; Arberry first met her in Cairo and they married at Cambridge in 1932.

Arberry is also notable for introducing Rumi&#x27;s works to the west through his selective translations and for translating the important anthology of medieval Andalusian Arabic poetry &quot;The Pennants of the Champions and the Standards of the Distinguished&quot;. His interpretation of Muhammad Iqbal&#x27;s writings, edited by Badiozzaman Forouzanfar, is similarly distinguished.

Arberry also introduced to an English-speaking audience the work of Malta&#x27;s national poet, Carmelo Psaila, popularly known as Dun Karm, in the bilingual anthology &quot;Dun Karm, Poet of Malta&quot;.

<text>Shore leave is the leave that professional sailors get to spend on dry land. It is also known as &quot;liberty&quot; within the United States Navy, Coast Guard, and Marine Corps.

During the Age of Sail, shore leave was often abused by the members of the crew, who took it as a prime opportunity to drink in excess, indulge in prostitutes, and desert. Many captains were forced to take on new members of the crew to replace the ones lost due to shore leave. 

==Amenities ships==
As the Royal Navy prepared for operations in the Pacific Ocean during the final stage of World War II, warships were recognized to be operating far from populated ports. Amenities ships were expected to provide an alternative to shore leave at remote island anchorages without commercial recreation facilities.

==United States Navy liberty==
The United States Navy has organized a 21st-century liberty and single sailor program for active duty military personnel and their guests 18 years or older. The program provides off-duty recreational opportunities for geographic bachelors and unaccompanied service members from all allied military service branches to enhance the quality of life for these individuals by providing a safe and healthy environment for social, cultural, recreation, athletic and fitness activities. Facilities on naval bases offer free use of internet computers and most locations offer a theater or television lounge area, table tennis and pool tables, and video game systems. Some of these liberty facilities offer full snack bars while most offer a variety of snack items; and all offer package tour information and sign ups to visit nearby sites of interest.

==In popular culture==
Books, films, and songs about sailors on shore leave include Jean Genet&#x27;s 1953 novel, &quot;Querelle of Brest&quot;; Gene Kelly and Stanley Donen&#x27;s 1949 film musical of Leonard Bernstein&#x27;s &quot;On the Town&quot;; and Belgian singer-songwriter Jacques Brel&#x27;s 1964 ballad &quot;Amsterdam&quot;. 

Singer-songwriter Tom Waits wrote a song entitled &quot;Shore Leave&quot; in 1982, and included it on his album of the following year &quot;Swordfishtrombones&quot;. As well as describing the excesses noted above, it also details the loneliness that many sailors feel when they suddenly find themselves with free time but without loved ones to share it with.

In many science fiction stories in which space travel is depicted, shore leave has the same basic principle but is more metaphorical, as a spacecraft crew does not necessarily disembark to a planetary location with a shoreline. The crew sometimes does not visit a planet at all but instead spend its shore leave on a space station with recreational facilities for crewpersons on leave. Filk musician Leslie Fish recorded a song based on the original &quot;Star Trek&quot; television series called &quot;Banned from Argo&quot; that detailed the debauchery and chaos caused by the Starfleet crew on shore leave.

In the 1955 film, &quot;Mister Roberts&quot;, Mr. Roberts (Henry Fonda) is forced to give up his dreams by working out a deal with the ship&#x27;s tyrannical Captain Morton (James Cagney) to give the crew liberty. However, the crew ends up crashing a party for colonel and raiding an admiral&#x27;s house, which leads to it getting kicked out the very next morning.

<doc id="908380" wikidata="Q607707" url="?curid=908380" title="Antonov An-71">
<text>The Antonov An-71 (NATO reporting name: Madcap) is a Soviet AWACS aircraft intended for use with VVS-FA (Fighter Bomber) forces of the Soviet Air Force, developed from the An-72 transport. Only three prototypes were built before the program was cancelled.

==Background==
=== Soviet Air Force AWACS doctrine ===
Prior to the fall of the Soviet Union, the Air Force was divided into three aircraft based groups of units. They were the VVS-DA (Voenno-Vozdushnye Sily Dal&#x27;naya Aviatsiya) or Long Range Aviation (Bombers), the VVS-FA (Voenno-Vozdushnye Sily Frontovaya Aviatsiya) or Frontal Aviation (Fighters, Fighter Bombers and Attack aircraft), and the VVS-VTA (Voenno-Vozdushnye Sily Voenno-Transportnaya Aviatsiya) or Military Transport Aviation. The PVO (Voyska protivovozdushnoy oborony or Voyska PVO) which was the primary fighter / interceptor and surface-based defensive force was not part of the VVS; as a result, the A-50 Mainstay AWACS aircraft and its predecessor the Tu-126 Moss served exclusively with the Voyska PVO and did not assist in the direction of tactical aircraft. The An-71 was designed to be used overland to support the VVS-FA in tactical operations. This doctrine of each force having its own AWACS planes is contrary to most Western air forces&#x27; use of land based AWACS aircraft; this doctrinal difference lead in part to the fallacy that the An-71 was designed to be used by the Soviet Navy on its aircraft carriers.

== Development ==
Its design was based on An-72, with a completely redesigned rear fuselage supporting the radar dome (rotodome) atop the broad-chord forward-swept fin. The cargo hold contained the electronic equipment and six operators stations.

Development never progressed past the prototype stage, the first of which flew on 12 July 1985. The program was cancelled with the fall of the Soviet Union when issues with the radar Vega-M Kvant could not be resolved.


In 2010, one example was transferred to the Ukraine State Aviation Museum for restoration and display.

=== Carrier-based variant ===
The An-71 &quot;Madcap&quot; is often erroneously cited as a carrier-based AWACS aircraft, which it was not, as is already described above under AWACS doctrine. However, a highly modified design, the An-75, was proposed for use on the Soviet aircraft carriers under construction, but the AV-MF (Soviet Naval Aviation) cancelled its development when it was realized that too much of a redesign would be needed to make the An-75 safe to operate off any of the proposed aircraft carriers. The AV-MF decided to seek a second purpose-built AWACS proposal using an improved Kvant-M version of the existing An-71/An-75&#x27;s Kvant Radar by the Vega-M design bureau. The An-75 would have had engines mounted under the wing rather than above, similar to the later An-74TK-300, and would have had many other structural and aerodynamic changes. In the end, the An-75 would have shared only slight commonality with the An-71/An-72 aircraft families and was deemed too costly to continue, considering the clean-sheet design of the Yak-44E.

=== Export ===
In the early 2000s, Ukraine unsuccessfully negotiated with India on the sale of an An-71, priced at US$200 million. The An-71 would have had the capability to detect 400 targets at ranges of up to .

<text>Nanoelectromechanical systems (NEMS) are a class of devices integrating electrical and mechanical functionality on the nanoscale. NEMS form the next logical miniaturization step from so-called microelectromechanical systems, or MEMS devices. NEMS typically integrate transistor-like nanoelectronics with mechanical actuators, pumps, or motors, and may thereby form physical, biological, and chemical sensors. The name derives from typical device dimensions in the nanometer range, leading to low mass, high mechanical resonance frequencies, potentially large quantum mechanical effects such as zero point motion, and a high surface-to-volume ratio useful for surface-based sensing mechanisms. Applications include accelerometers and sensors to detect chemical substances in the air.

==History==
===Background===
As noted by Richard Feynman in his famous talk in 1959, &quot;There&#x27;s Plenty of Room at the Bottom,&quot; there are many potential applications of machines at smaller and smaller sizes; by building and controlling devices at smaller scales, all technology benefits. The expected benefits include greater efficiencies and reduced size, decreased power consumption and lower costs of production in electromechanical systems.

The first silicon dioxide field effect transistors were built by Frosch and Derick in 1957 at Bell Labs. In 1960, Atalla and Kahng at Bell Labs fabricated a MOSFET with a gate oxide thickness of 100 nm. In 1962, Atalla and Kahng fabricated a nanolayer-base metal–semiconductor junction (M–S junction) transistor that used gold (Au) thin films with a thickness of 10 nm. In 1987, Bijan Davari led an IBM research team that demonstrated the first MOSFET with a 10 nm oxide thickness. Multi-gate MOSFETs enabled scaling below 20 nm channel length, starting with the FinFET. The FinFET originates from the research of Digh Hisamoto at Hitachi Central Research Laboratory in 1989. At UC Berkeley, a group led by Hisamoto and TSMC&#x27;s Chenming Hu fabricated FinFET devices down to 17nm channel length in 1998.

===NEMS===
In 2000, the first very-large-scale integration (VLSI) NEMS device was demonstrated by researchers at IBM. Its premise was an array of AFM tips which can heat/sense a deformable substrate in order to function as a memory device (Millipede memory). Further devices have been described by Stefan de Haan. In 2007, the International Technical Roadmap for Semiconductors (ITRS) contains NEMS memory as a new entry for the Emerging Research Devices section.

==Atomic force microscopy==
A key application of NEMS is atomic force microscope tips. The increased sensitivity achieved by NEMS leads to smaller and more efficient sensors to detect stresses, vibrations, forces at the atomic level, and chemical signals. AFM tips and other detection at the nanoscale rely heavily on NEMS.

==Approaches to miniaturization==
Two complementary approaches to fabrication of NEMS can be found, the top-down approach and the bottom-up approach.

The top-down approach uses the traditional microfabrication methods, i.e. optical, electron-beam lithography and thermal treatments, to manufacture devices. While being limited by the resolution of these methods, it allows a large degree of control over the resulting structures. In this manner devices such as nanowires, nanorods, and patterned nanostructures are fabricated from metallic thin films or etched semiconductor layers. For top-down approaches, increasing surface area to volume ratio enhances the reactivity of nanomaterials.

Bottom-up approaches, in contrast, use the chemical properties of single molecules to cause single-molecule components to self-organize or self-assemble into some useful conformation, or rely on positional assembly. These approaches utilize the concepts of molecular self-assembly and/or molecular recognition. This allows fabrication of much smaller structures, albeit often at the cost of limited control of the fabrication process. Furthermore, while there are residue materials removed from the original structure for the top-down approach, minimal material is removed or wasted for the bottom-up approach.

A combination of these approaches may also be used, in which nanoscale molecules are integrated into a top-down framework. One such example is the carbon nanotube nanomotor.

==Materials==

===Carbon allotropes===
Many of the commonly used materials for NEMS technology have been carbon based, specifically diamond, carbon nanotubes and graphene. This is mainly because of the useful properties of carbon based materials which directly meet the needs of NEMS. The mechanical properties of carbon (such as large Young&#x27;s modulus) are fundamental to the stability of NEMS while the metallic and semiconductor conductivities of carbon based materials allow them to function as transistors.

Both graphene and diamond exhibit high Young&#x27;s modulus, low density, low friction, exceedingly low mechanical dissipation, and large surface area. The low friction of CNTs, allow practically frictionless bearings and has thus been a huge motivation towards practical applications of CNTs as constitutive elements in NEMS, such as nanomotors, switches, and high-frequency oscillators. Carbon nanotubes and graphene&#x27;s physical strength allows carbon based materials to meet higher stress demands, when common materials would normally fail and thus further support their use as a major materials in NEMS technological development.

Along with the mechanical benefits of carbon based materials, the electrical properties of carbon nanotubes and graphene allow it to be used in many electrical components of NEMS. Nanotransistors have been developed for both carbon nanotubes as well as graphene. Transistors are one of the basic building blocks for all electronic devices, so by effectively developing usable transistors, carbon nanotubes and graphene are both very crucial to NEMS.

Nanomechanical resonators are frequently made of graphene. As NEMS resonators are scaled down in size, there is a general trend for a decrease in quality factor in inverse proportion to surface area to volume ratio. However, despite this challenge, it has been experimentally proven to reach a quality factor as high as 2400.  The quality factor describes the purity of tone of the resonator&#x27;s vibrations. Furthermore, it has been theoretically predicted that clamping graphene membranes on all sides yields increased quality numbers. Graphene NEMS can also function as mass, force, and position sensors.

====Metallic carbon nanotubes====
Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are allotropes of carbon with a cylindrical nanostructure. They can be considered a rolled up graphene. When rolled at specific and discrete (&quot;chiral&quot;) angles, and the combination of the rolling angle and radius decides whether the nanotube has a bandgap (semiconducting) or no bandgap (metallic).
Metallic carbon nanotubes have also been proposed for nanoelectronic interconnects since they can carry high current densities. This is a useful property as wires to transfer current are another basic building block of any electrical system. Carbon nanotubes have specifically found so much use in NEMS that methods have already been discovered to connect suspended carbon nanotubes to other nanostructures. This allows carbon nanotubes to form complicated nanoelectric systems. Because carbon based products can be properly controlled and act as interconnects as well as transistors, they serve as a fundamental material in the electrical components of NEMS.

====CNT-based NEMS switches====
A major disadvantage of MEMS switches over NEMS switches are limited microsecond range switching speeds of MEMS, which impedes performance for high speed applications. Limitations on switching speed and actuation voltage can be overcome by scaling down devices from micro to nanometer scale. A comparison of performance parameters between carbon nanotube (CNT)-based NEMS switches with its counterpart CMOS revealed that CNT-based NEMS switches retained performance at lower levels of energy consumption and had a subthreshold leakage current several orders of magnitude smaller than that of CMOS switches. CNT-based NEMS with doubly clamped structures are being further studied as potential solutions for floating gate nonvolatile memory applications.

====Difficulties====
Despite all of the useful properties of carbon nanotubes and graphene for NEMS technology, both of these products face several hindrances to their implementation. One of the main problems is carbon&#x27;s response to real life environments. Carbon nanotubes exhibit a large change in electronic properties when exposed to oxygen. Similarly, other changes to the electronic and mechanical attributes of carbon based materials must fully be explored before their implementation, especially because of their high surface area which can easily react with surrounding environments. Carbon nanotubes were also found to have varying conductivities, being either metallic or semiconducting depending on their helicity when processed. Because of this, special treatment must be given to the nanotubes during processing to assure that all of the nanotubes have appropriate conductivities. Graphene also has complicated electric conductivity properties compared to traditional semiconductors because it lacks an energy band gap and essentially changes all the rules for how electrons move through a graphene based device. This means that traditional constructions of electronic devices will likely not work and completely new architectures must be designed for these new electronic devices.

====Nanoelectromechanical accelerometer====
Graphene&#x27;s mechanical and electronic properties have made it favorable for integration into NEMS accelerometers, such as small sensors and actuators for heart monitoring systems and mobile motion capture. The atomic scale thickness of graphene provides a pathway for accelerometers to be scaled down from micro to nanoscale while retaining the system&#x27;s required sensitivity levels.

By suspending a silicon proof mass on a double-layer graphene ribbon, a nanoscale spring-mass and piezoresistive transducer can be made with the capability of currently produced transducers in accelerometers. The spring mass provides greater accuracy, and the piezoresistive properties of graphene converts the strain from acceleration to electrical signals for the accelerometer. The suspended graphene ribbon simultaneously forms the spring and piezoresistive transducer, making efficient use of space in while improving performance of NEMS accelerometers.

===Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS)===
Failures arising from high adhesion and friction are of concern for many NEMS. NEMS frequently utilize silicon due to well-characterized micromachining techniques; however, its intrinsic stiffness often hinders the capability of devices with moving parts.

A study conducted by Ohio State researchers compared the adhesion and friction parameters of a single crystal silicon with native oxide layer against PDMS coating. PDMS is a silicone elastomer that is highly mechanically tunable, chemically inert, thermally stable, permeable to gases, transparent, non-fluorescent, biocompatible, and nontoxic. Inherent to polymers, the Young&#x27;s Modulus of PDMS can vary over two orders of magnitude by manipulating the extent of crosslinking of polymer chains, making it a viable material in NEMS and biological applications. PDMS can form a tight seal with silicon and thus be easily integrated into NEMS technology, optimizing both mechanical and electrical properties. Polymers like PDMS are beginning to gain attention in NEMS due to their comparatively inexpensive, simplified, and time-efficient prototyping and manufacturing.

Rest time has been characterized to directly correlate with adhesive force, and increased relative humidity lead to an increase of adhesive forces for hydrophilic polymers. Contact angle measurements and Laplace force calculations support the characterization of PDMS&#x27;s hydrophobic nature, which expectedly corresponds with its experimentally verified independence to relative humidity. PDMS’ adhesive forces are also independent of rest time, capable of versatilely performing under varying relative humidity conditions, and possesses a lower coefficient of friction than that of Silicon. PDMS coatings facilitate mitigation of high-velocity problems, such as preventing sliding. Thus, friction at contact surfaces remains low even at considerably high velocities. In fact, on the microscale, friction reduces with increasing velocity. The hydrophobicity and low friction coefficient of PDMS have given rise to its potential in being further incorporated within NEMS experiments that are conducted at varying relative humidities and high relative sliding velocities.

====PDMS-coated piezoresistive nanoelectromechanical systems diaphragm====
PDMS is frequently used within NEMS technology. For instance, PDMS coating on a diaphragm can be used for chloroform vapor detection.

Researchers from the National University of Singapore invented a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS)-coated nanoelectromechanical system diaphragm embedded with silicon nanowires (SiNWs) to detect chloroform vapor at room temperature. In the presence of chloroform vapor, the PDMS film on the micro-diaphragm absorbs vapor molecules and consequently enlarges, leading to deformation of the micro-diaphragm. The SiNWs implanted within the micro-diaphragm are linked in a Wheatstone bridge, which translates the deformation into a quantitative output voltage. In addition, the micro-diaphragm sensor also demonstrates low-cost processing at low power consumption. It possesses great potential for scalability, ultra-compact footprint, and CMOS-IC process compatibility. By switching the vapor-absorption polymer layer, similar methods can be applied that should theoretically be able to detect other organic vapors.

In addition to its inherent properties discussed in the Materials section, PDMS can be used to absorb chloroform, whose effects are commonly associated with swelling and deformation of the micro-diaphragm; various organic vapors were also gauged in this study. With good aging stability and appropriate packaging, the degradation rate of PDMS in response to heat, light, and radiation can be slowed.

===Biohybrid NEMS===
The emerging field of bio-hybrid systems combines biological and synthetic structural elements for biomedical or robotic applications. The constituting elements of bio-nanoelectromechanical systems (BioNEMS) are of nanoscale size, for example DNA, proteins or nanostructured mechanical parts. Examples include the facile top-down nanostructuring of thiol-ene polymers to create cross-linked and mechanically robust nanostructures that are subsequently functionalized with proteins.

==Simulations==
Computer simulations have long been important counterparts to experimental studies of NEMS devices. Through continuum mechanics and molecular dynamics (MD), important behaviors of NEMS devices can be predicted via computational modeling before engaging in experiments. Additionally, combining continuum and MD techniques enables engineers to efficiently analyze the stability of NEMS devices without resorting to ultra-fine meshes and time-intensive simulations. Simulations have other advantages as well: they do not require the time and expertise associated with fabricating NEMS devices; they can effectively predict the interrelated roles of various electromechanical effects; and parametric studies can be conducted fairly readily as compared with experimental approaches. For example, computational studies have predicted the charge distributions and “pull-in” electromechanical responses of NEMS devices. Using simulations to predict mechanical and electrical behavior of these devices can help optimize NEMS device design parameters.

==Reliability and Life Cycle of NEMS==

===Reliability and Challenges===
Reliability provides a quantitative measure of the component&#x27;s integrity and performance without failure for a specified product lifetime. Failure of NEMS devices can be attributed to a variety of sources, such as mechanical, electrical, chemical, and thermal factors. Identifying failure mechanisms, improving yield, scarcity of information, and reproducibility issues have been identified as major challenges to achieving higher levels of reliability for NEMS devices. Such challenges arise during both manufacturing stages (i.e. wafer processing, packaging, final assembly) and post-manufacturing stages (i.e. transportation, logistics, usage).

====Packaging                                                  ====
Packaging challenges often account for 75–95% of the overall costs of MEMS and NEMS. Factors of wafer dicing, device thickness, sequence of final release, thermal expansion, mechanical stress isolation, power and heat dissipation, creep minimization, media isolation, and protective coatings are considered by packaging design to align with the design of the MEMS or NEMS component. Delamination analysis, motion analysis, and life-time testing have been used to assess wafer-level encapsulation techniques, such as cap to wafer, wafer to wafer, and thin film encapsulation. Wafer-level encapsulation techniques can lead to improved reliability and increased yield for both micro and nanodevices.

====Manufacturing====
Assessing the reliability of NEMS in early stages of the manufacturing process is essential for yield improvement. Forms of surface forces, such as adhesion and electrostatic forces, are largely dependent on surface topography and contact geometry. Selective manufacturing of nano-textured surfaces reduces contact area, improving both adhesion and friction performance for NEMS. Furthermore, the implementation of nanopost to engineered surfaces increase hydrophobicity, leading to a reduction in both adhesion and friction.

Adhesion and friction can also be manipulated by nanopatterning to adjust surface roughness for the appropriate applications of the NEMS device. Researchers from Ohio State University used atomic/friction force microscopy (AFM/FFM) to examine the effects of nanopatterning on hydrophobicity, adhesion, and friction for hydrophilic polymers with two types of patterned asperities (low aspect ratio and high aspect ratio). Roughness on hydrophilic surfaces versus hydrophobic surfaces are found to have inversely correlated and directly correlated relationships respectively.

Due to its large surface area to volume ratio and sensitivity, adhesion and friction can impede performance and reliability of NEMS devices. These tribological issues arise from natural down-scaling of these tools; however, the system can be optimized through the manipulation of the structural material, surface films, and lubricant. In comparison to undoped Si or polysilicon films, SiC films possess the lowest frictional output, resulting in increased scratch resistance and enhanced functionality at high temperatures. Hard diamond-like carbon (DLC) coatings exhibit low friction, high hardness and wear resistance, in addition to chemical and electrical resistances. Roughness, a factor that reduces wetting and increases hydrophobicity, can be optimized by increasing the contact angle to reduce wetting and allow for low adhesion and interaction of the device to its environment.

Material properties are size-dependent. Therefore, analyzing the unique characteristics on NEMS and nano-scale material becomes increasingly important to retaining reliability and long-term stability of NEMS devices. Some mechanical properties, such as hardness, elastic modulus, and bend tests, for nano-materials are determined by using a nano indenter on a material that has undergone fabrication processes. These measurements, however, do not consider how the device will operate in industry under prolonged or cyclic stresses and strains. The theta structure is a NEMS model that exhibits unique mechanical properties. Composed of Si, the structure has high strength and is able to concentrate stresses at the nanoscale to measure certain mechanical properties of materials.

====Residual stresses====
To increase reliability of structural integrity, characterization of both material structure and intrinsic stresses at appropriate length scales becomes increasingly pertinent. Effects of residual stresses include but are not limited to fracture, deformation, delamination, and nanosized structural changes, which can result in failure of operation and physical deterioration of the device.

Residual stresses can influence electrical and optical properties. For instance, in various photovoltaic and light emitting diodes (LED) applications, the band gap energy of semiconductors can be tuned accordingly by the effects of residual stress.

Atomic force microscopy (AFM) and Raman spectroscopy can be used to characterize the distribution of residual stresses on thin films in terms of force volume imaging, topography, and force curves. Furthermore, residual stress can be used to measure nanostructures’ melting temperature by using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and temperature dependent X-ray Diffraction (XRD).

==Future==
Key hurdles currently preventing the commercial application of many NEMS devices include low-yields and high device quality variability. Before NEMS devices can actually be implemented, reasonable integrations of carbon based products must be created. A recent step in that direction has been demonstrated for diamond, achieving a processing level comparable to that of silicon. The focus is currently shifting from experimental work towards practical applications and device structures that will implement and profit from such novel devices. The next challenge to overcome involves understanding all of the properties of these carbon-based tools, and using the properties to make efficient and durable NEMS with low failure rates.

Carbon-based materials have served as prime materials for NEMS use, because of their exceptional mechanical and electrical properties.

Recently, nanowires of chalcogenide glasses have shown to be a key platform to design tunable NEMS owing to the availability of active modulation of Young&#x27;s modulus.

The global market of NEMS is projected to reach $108.88 million by 2022.

==Applications==
*Nanoelectromechanical relay
*Nanoelectromechanical systems mass spectrometer

===Nanoelectromechanical-based cantilevers===
Researchers from the California Institute of Technology developed a NEM-based cantilever with mechanical resonances up to very high frequencies (VHF). It is incorporation of electronic displacement transducers based on piezoresistive thin metal film facilitates unambiguous and efficient nanodevice readout. The functionalization of the device&#x27;s surface using a thin polymer coating with high partition coefficient for the targeted species enables NEMS-based cantilevers to provide chemisorption measurements at room temperature with mass resolution at less than one attogram. Further capabilities of NEMS-based cantilevers have been exploited for the applications of sensors, scanning probes, and devices operating at very high frequency (100 MHz).

<text>A cottage, during England&#x27;s feudal period, was the holding by a cottager (known as a cotter or &quot;bordar&quot;) of a small house with enough garden to feed a family and in return for the cottage, the cottager had to provide some form of service to the manorial lord. However, in time cottage just became the general term for a small house. In modern usage, a cottage is usually a modest, often cosy dwelling, typically in a rural or semi-rural location and not necessarily in England. The cottage orné, often quite large and grand residences built by the nobility, dates back to a movement of &quot;rustic&quot; stylised cottages of the late 18th and early 19th century during the Romantic movement. 

In British English the term now denotes a small, cosy dwelling of traditional build, although it can also be applied to modern construction designed to resemble traditional houses (&quot; cottages&quot;). Cottages may be detached houses, or terraced, such as those built to house workers in mining villages. The tied accommodation provided to farm workers was usually a cottage, see cottage garden. In England the term holiday cottage now denotes a specialised form of residential let property, attracting various tax benefits to the owner.

The holiday cottage exists in many cultures under different names. In Canadian English and American English, &quot;cottage&quot; is one term for such holiday homes, although they may also be called a &quot;cabin&quot;, &quot;chalet&quot;, or even &quot;camp&quot;. In Australia, the term &quot;cabin&quot; is common, cottage usually referring to a smaller pre-modern period dwelling. In certain countries (e.g. Nordics, Baltics, and Russia) the term &quot;cottage&quot; has local synonyms: In Finnish &quot;mökki&quot;, in Estonian &quot;suvila&quot;, in Latvian &quot;vasarnīca&quot;, in Livonian &quot;sõvvõkuodā&quot;, in Swedish &quot;stuga&quot;, in Norwegian &quot;hytte&quot; (from the German word &quot;Hütte&quot;), in Czech or Slovak &quot;chata&quot; or &quot;chalupa&quot;, in Russian &quot;дача&quot; (&quot;dacha&quot;).

In places such as Canada, &quot;cottage&quot; carries no connotations of size (compare with vicarage or hermitage).

==Etymology==
The word &quot;cottage&quot; (Medieval Latin &quot;cotagium&quot;) derives from Old English &quot;cot, cote&quot; &quot;hut&quot; and Old French &quot;cot&quot; &quot;hut, cottage&quot;, from Old Norse &quot;kot&quot; &quot;hut&quot; and related to Middle Low German &quot;kotten&quot; (cottage, hut). Examples of this may be found in 15th century manor court rolls. The house of the cottage bore the Latin name: &quot;domus&quot;, while the barn of the cottage was termed &quot;grangia&quot;.

==England==
===Medieval===

The word originally referred to a humble rural detached dwelling of a &quot;cotter&quot;, a semi-independent resident of a manor who had certain residential rights from the lord of the manor, and who in the social hierarchy was a grade above the slave (mentioned in the Domesday Book of 1086), who had no right of tenure and worked full-time to the orders of the lord. In the Domesday Book, they were referred to as &quot;Coterelli&quot;. The cottage had a small amount of surrounding agricultural land, perhaps two or three acres, from which the resident gained his livelihood and sustenance. It was defined by its function of housing a cotter, rather than by its form, which varied, but it was certainly small and cheaply built and purely functional, with no non-essential architectural flourishes. It would have been built from the cheapest locally available materials and in the local style, thus in wheat-growing areas, it would be roofed in thatch, and in slate-rich locations, such as Cornwall, slates would be used for roofing. In stone-rich areas, its walls would be built of rubble stone, and in other areas, such as Devon, was commonly built from cob.

===Industrial Revolution===

In England from about the 18th century onwards, the development of industry led to the development of weavers&#x27; cottages and miners&#x27; cottages. Friedrich Engels cites &#x27;Cottages&#x27; as a poor quality dwelling in his 1845 work &quot;The Condition of the Working Class in England&quot;.

===Enclosure acts===

Over the years various English acts of Parliament removed the right of the cottager to hold land. According to John Lawrence Hammond and Barbara Hammond in their book &quot;The Village Labourer&quot;, before an inclosure act a cottager was a farm labourer with land, and after an inclosure act the cottager was a farm labourer without land.

===Legal definition===
In the law of England and Wales the definition of a cottage is &quot;a small house or habitation without land&quot;. However, originally under an Elizabethan statute, the cottage had to be built with at least of land.

==Wales==
The Welsh &quot;Tŷ unnos&quot; or &quot;house in a night&quot;, was built by squatters on a plot of land defined by the throw of an axe from each corner of the property. In Welsh a cottage is known as &quot;bwthyn&quot; and its inhabitant &quot;preswlydd&quot;.

==Scotland==
In Scotland the equivalent to cottager would be the crofter and the term for the building and its land would be croft.

==Ireland==

Irish cottages, known as , were historically the homes of farmworkers and labourers, but in recent years the term has assumed a romantic connotation especially when referring to cottages with thatched roofs (). These thatched cottages were once to be seen all over Ireland, but most have become dilapidated due to newer and modern developments. However, there has been a recent revival of restoring these old cottages, with people wanting a more traditional home. Today, thatched cottages are now mostly built for the tourist industry and many can be let out as accommodation.

==Modern usage in Britain and Ireland==
In popular modern culture, the term &quot;cottage&quot; is used in a more general and romantic context and can date from any era but the term is usually applied to pre-modern dwellings. Older, pre-Victorian cottages tend to have restricted height, and often have construction timber exposed, sometimes intruding into the living space. Modern renovations of such dwellings often seek to re-expose timber purlins, rafters, posts, etc. which have been covered, in an attempt to establish perceived historical authenticity.

Older cottages are typically modest, often semi-detached or terraced, with only four basic rooms (&quot;two up, two down&quot;), although subsequent modifications can create more spacious accommodation. A labourer&#x27;s or fisherman&#x27;s one-roomed house, often attached to a larger property, is a particular type of cottage and is called a &quot;penty&quot;. The term cottage has also been used for a larger house that is practical rather than pretentious: see Chawton Cottage.

==Outside Britain and Ireland==
===North America===

Although the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; states that the term &quot;cottage&quot; is used in North America to represent &quot;a summer residence (often on a large and sumptuous scale) at a watering-place or a health or pleasure resort,&quot; most Americans expect a cottage, particularly a summer cottage, to be a relatively small, possibly unfinished house. Various editions of the quintessentially American &quot;Webster&#x27;s Dictionary&quot; define it as &quot;a small house; any modest country or suburban dwelling,&quot; (fifth edition) with the eleventh edition describing even a vacation cottage as &quot;a usu. small house for vacation use.&quot;

In North America, most buildings known as cottages are used for weekend or summer getaways by city dwellers. Cottage owners often rent their properties to tourists as a source of revenue. In Saint John, U.S. Virgin Islands, most cottages are vacation rentals used for weekend or summer getaways. In Michigan, a cottage normally means a summer residence farther north near or on a lake. An example of a colonial era cottage in North America is a small fieldstone house called Boelson Cottage in Fairmount Park, Philadelphia—one of the oldest extant houses within the city (c.1678–84).

In the jargon of English-speaking Quebec&#x27;s real-estate industry, a cottage is any two-storey house, as opposed to a bungalow. However, &quot;cottages&quot; in Eastern Canada are generally located next to lakes, rivers, or the ocean in forested areas. They are used as a place to spend holidays with friends and family; common activities include swimming, canoeing, waterskiing, fishing, hiking, and sailing. There are also many well-known summer colonies. Cottage living is one of the most popular tourist draws in Ontario, Canada, parts of which have come to be known as cottage country. This term typically refers to the north and south shores of Georgian Bay, Ontario; Muskoka, Ontario; Haliburton, Ontario; and the Kawartha Lakes, Ontario; but has also been used to describe several other Canadian regions. The practice of renting cottages has become widespread in these regions, especially with rising property taxes for waterfront property.

What Eastern Canadians refer to as &quot;cottages&quot; (seasonal-use dwellings), are generally referred to as &quot;cabins&quot; in most of North America. This is most notable in the Midwest and the Western United States, and Western Canada. In much of Northern Ontario, New England, and upstate New York, a summer house near a body of water is known as a camp. In the 1960s and 1970s, the A-Frame house became a popular cottage style in North America.

In the 1920s and 30s many gas stations were built in the style of Old World cottages. Comprising about a third of the stations built in the United States in those years, cottage-patterned facilities evoked a picturesque homeyness and were easier to gain approval for than the more stylized or attention-grabbing designs also commonly used at the dawn of the automobile era.

=== Australia ===

In Australia, the term &quot;cabin&quot; or &quot;shack&quot; is commonly used for a small dwelling, the former more often for a place of residence or tourist accommodation and the latter for a simple recreational shelter, typically not continuously occupied. The term cottage usually refers to historic smaller residential buildings, commonly stone or brick, typically from Georgian or Victorian. More recently, cabins are often also referred to tiny houses, however, cabins are built at a permanent site on proper footings, while the term tiny house often implies that the dwelling is built on a trailer platform and can be relocated.

===Nordic countries===
====Finland====

&quot;Statistics Finland&quot; defines a cottage (, Finland Swedish: &quot;stuga&quot; or &quot;villa&quot;) as &quot;a residential building that is used as a holiday or free-time dwelling and is permanently constructed or erected on its site&quot;. Finnish cottages are traditionally built of logs but other wood constructions have become common. They are usually situated close to water and almost all have a sauna.

There are 474,277 cottages in Finland (2005), a country with 187,888 lakes and 179,584 islands, including rental holiday cottages owned by hospitality companies but excluding holiday villages and buildings on garden allotments. Reports have 4,172 new cottages built in 2005. Most cottages are situated in the municipalities of Kuusamo (6,196 cottages on 1 January 2006), Kuopio (5,194), Ekenäs (Tammisaari – 5,053), Mikkeli (4,649), and Mäntyharju (4,630).

====Sweden====

The formal Swedish term for cottages is &quot;fritidshus&quot; (vacation house) or &quot;stuga&quot;, of which there are 680.000 in Sweden (2007). According to Statistics Sweden, about 50% of the Swedish population has access to a vacation house. In everyday talk, Swedes refer to their cottages as &quot;lantstället&quot; (the country house) or &quot;stugan&quot; (the cottage). Most vacation houses in Sweden are to be found along the coasts and around the major cities. Prices vary a lot depending on location; a modern seaside house near Stockholm may cost 100 times as much as a simple cottage in the inner regions of northern Sweden.

Until the end of World War II, only a small wealthy Swedish elite could afford vacation houses—often both a large seaside house and a hunting cabin up north. During the rapid urbanisation in the 1950s and 1960s, many families were able to retain their old farmhouses, village cottages, and fisherman cabins and convert them into vacation houses. In addition, economic growth made it possible even for low-income families to buy small lots in the countryside where they could erect simple houses. Former vacation houses near the large cities have gradually been converted into permanent homes as a result of urban sprawl.

The traditional Swedish cottage is a simple paneled house made of wood and painted in red. They may contain 1–3 small bedrooms and also a small bathroom. In the combined kitchen and living room (&quot;storstuga&quot;) there is usually a fireplace. Today, many cottages have been extended with &quot;outdoor rooms&quot; (semi-heated external rooms with glass walls and a thin roof) and large wood terraces. As a result of the friggebod reform in 1979, many cottage owners have built additional guesthouses on their lots.

====Norway====
The formal Norwegian term for cottages is &quot;hytte&quot; or &quot;fritidsbolig&quot; (vacation house). In Norway, cabins are often built near leisure activities such as hunting, fishing, and outdoor life / outdoor sports, or in areas with particularly beautiful nature, such as in the woods, in the mountains, or by the sea. In the most attractive areas, it has become increasingly common with regulated fields where the cabins are very close together, in so-called &quot;cabin villages&quot;. Chained cabins and holiday apartments are also being built here, similar to a normal city.

===Russia===

The first known &quot;cottages&quot; were built in Russia in the 19th century, when British culture was popular. Today many large cities in Russia are surrounded by cottage villages. So it is legitimate to talk about the appearance of the term &quot;Russian cottage&quot; – a house, comparable in size to a British villa or even a mansion, and includes a corresponding piece of land.

=== South Africa ===

Much like in the rest of the world, cottages in South Africa housed agricultural workers and their friends and families. A number of cottages were also constructed for fishermen along the West and South Coasts of the country throughout the 18th and 19th centuries. Most cottages are single-story two to four-room structures, sometimes with an attic for storing supplies. Most cottages in the Western Cape area of South Africa have thatched roofs and stone or adobe walls which were traditionally whitewashed. A large number of the remaining cottages in the country are listed heritage sites.

<text>The Taiwanese Communist Party (Kyūjitai: ; Shinjitai: ) was a revolutionary organization active in Japanese-ruled Taiwan. Like the contemporary Taiwanese People&#x27;s Party, its existence was short, only three years, but its politics and activities were influential in shaping Taiwan&#x27;s anti-colonial enterprise.

The party was subordinate to the Japanese Communist Party but advocated Taiwan&#x27;s independence from Japan.

== Inception ==
The party was officially formed on 15 April 1928 in the Shanghai French Concession. Its planning went back to as early as 1925, when Moscow-trained Taiwanese students began to contact likeminded individuals in China and Japan. By late 1927, the Comintern had instructed Japanese communists, who had been organized since 1922, to draft political and organizational charters () for a &quot;Japanese Communist Party, Taiwanese National Branch&quot;. Following the draft, and Hsieh Hsueh-hung secretly met in Shanghai with seven others, three of whom represented the Chinese, Korean, and Japanese Communist Parties, respectively, to form the nascent organization. The TCP&#x27;s first headquarters were located in the Shanghai French Concession. 

In 1931, the Comintern elevated the group&#x27;s status from party branch to that of a full-fledged party, which was directly answerable to it.

== Organization and ideology ==
The party advocated Taiwan&#x27;s independence from Japanese rule. Politically, the party described the &quot;Taiwanese nation&quot; () as the descendants of Koxinga&#x27;s army and later settlers from southeastern China. Both Koxinga and other Manchu rulers established a feudal system, which, in its view, began to disintegrate with the introduction of 19th-century Western capital into the island.

The Republic of Formosa represented a revolutionary movement of feudal landowners, merchants and radical patriots, but it was doomed to failure given the immaturity of the native capitalist class. It saw Taiwan&#x27;s capitalism to be utterly dependent upon its Japanese counterpart.

The proletarian revolution would be driven by the contradiction between the dominant Japanese capital and the native (and poorly developed) capital and rural feudalistic elements. The goal of the party was to unite the workers and the peasants. Toward that goal, the party would use the left-leaning Taiwanese Cultural Association as a platform and legal front, and expose the &quot;lies&quot; of the Taiwanese People&#x27;s Party, which had been moving toward the left under Chiang Wei-shui&#x27;s leadership.

The 1928 charter subjected the organization of the Taiwanese communists to the Japanese party. Although Japanese communists had been entrusted with the task of guiding the Taiwanese branch, massive repression in Japan proper, starting in 1928, left the Taiwanese adrift. Some leftist students were also forced to return to Taiwan. Leadership fell to Hsieh Hsueh-hung to reorganize in light of that development.

== Activities ==
The party sought to organize workers in still-unorganized key industries, including the transportation and mining sectors in northern Taiwan. Party cadres were sent to work spread propaganda in the logging ranches of Giran and the mines in Kīrun, with mixed success. In Taihoku, the party led a failed strike by print workers. In the island&#x27;s south, cadres sparked a strike by railroad workers in Takao. Overall, however, the TCP was neither as active nor as successful as the Alliance of Taiwanese Workers, which was affiliated with the Taiwanese People&#x27;s Party.

The party had more success organizing peasants. Earlier, a bottom-up farmers&#x27; movement had spread rapidly in 1925, leading to the creation of the island-wide Taiwanese Peasants&#x27; Union. The TCP was able to cultivate its faction within the Union and by late 1928, the Union had openly declared its support for the communists. At that time, the Great Depression of 1930 was seen by many communists worldwide as a sign that the proletariat revolution was on the verge of exploding. Japan&#x27;s war efforts in China had also bogged down. By 1931 the TCP-led Peasants&#x27; Union was secretly training farmers (many of Hakka ethnicity) in preparation for armed struggle to form a soviet, one that some believed would soon elicit support from the Chinese Communist Party. A leak allowed the authorities to liquidate a key group, halting that plan.

From its inception, the TCP had plans to infiltrate the Cultural Association, which was already left-leaning, after a group of moderate and conservative leaders had left in 1927. It was a convenient platform that could serve as a legal front. The third congress (1929) saw the communists succeed in electing several cadres to the association&#x27;s central committee. They proceeded to purge the leadership of the remaining conservatives and non-TCP leftists, particularly Lien Wenqing.

Between 1931 and 1933, authorities arrested 107 TCP members, who were sentenced to prison terms of up to 15 years. A few died in prison.

== Factionalism ==
Initially, the party had been under the sway of the Japanese theorist Yamakawa Hitoshi, who advocated uniting the workers, peasants, and the petty bourgeoisie to form a mass party. The Comintern also initially favored communists uniting with &quot;bourgeois forces&quot; to wage an anti-imperialist war of national liberation. The TCP&#x27;s 1931 charter, however, reflected new assessment that downplayed the revolutionary potential of the bourgeoisie. Class struggle was to be the priority. Hsieh, the leader until then, was opposed to the new turn. She and her supporters were forced out of the party.

== Post-World War II ==
There is no evidence that surviving members of the party managed to re-constitute the TCP after Japan&#x27;s surrender to the Allied Forces. However, during the two years between 1945 and the aftermath of the February 28 Incident, some individual past members (most notably Hsieh Hsueh-hung) participated the anti-government action. The Kuomintang&#x27;s repression led a part of them to flee to Mainland China, where they merged into the ranks of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). Some of the survivors fled to British Hong Kong and formed the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League in November 1947. Communist activities after the 1949 Nationalist retreat to Taiwan were thus directed under the auspices of the Chinese Communist Party.

The Labor Party was formed in 1989 and proclaims to have historical links to the Taiwanese Communist Party.

<text>The Imperial Diversion Dam (National ID # CA10159) is a concrete slab and buttress, ogee weir structure across the California/Arizona border, northeast of Yuma. Completed in 1938, the dam retains the waters of the Colorado River into the Imperial Reservoir before desilting and diversion into the All-American Canal and the Gila Project aqueduct. Between 1932 and 1940, the Imperial Irrigation District (IID) relied on the Inter-California Canal and the Imperial Canal and Alamo River.

==Background==
The Imperial Dam was built with three sections; the gates of each section hold back the water to help divert the water towards the desilting plant. Three giant desilting basins and seventy-two 770 ft (230 m) scrapers hold and desilt the water; the removed silt is carried away by six sludge-pipes running under the Colorado River that dump the sediment into the California sluiceway, which returns the silt to the Colorado River. The water is now directed back towards one of the three sections which divert the water into one of the three channels. About 90% of the volume of the Colorado River is diverted into the canals at this location. Diversions can top per second, roughly the volume of the Susquehanna River and more than 50 times the flow of the Rio Grande.

The Gila project aqueduct branches off towards Arizona while the All-American canal branches southwards for 37 miles (60 km) before reaching its headworks on the California border and bends west towards the Imperial Valley.

<text>Elmer &quot;Archie&quot; Fowler Stone (January 22, 1887 – May 20, 1936) was a United States naval aviator and a commander in the United States Coast Guard.

==Biography==
Stone was born in Livonia, New York and grew up in Norfolk, Virginia. He joined the U.S. Revenue Cutter Service as a cadet at the Revenue Cutter Service School of Instruction on April 28, 1910.

Elmer Stone was a United States Coast Guard aviation pioneer; in early 1915 Stone and another officer Norman B. Hall, were the first to suggest that the Coast Guard develop an aviation capability. With the encouragement of their commanding officer, Captain Benjamin M. Chiswell of the , Lieutenants Stone and Hall approached the Curtiss Flying School in Newport News, Virginia about using aircraft in air-sea rescue operations, and participated in experimental flights in a Curtiss Model F flying boat. During the summer of 1915, Stone and Hall performed scouting patrols for &quot;Onondaga&quot;, assisting in search missions that the cutter was assigned. On March 28, 1916, he was assigned as a student aviator at the United States Navy flight facility in Pensacola, Florida. The same year he also studied aeronautical engineering at the Curtiss factory. On April 10, 1917, Stone became the Coast Guard&#x27;s first aviator upon graduating from flight training at Pensacola and was appointed as Coast Guard Aviator No. 1 and Naval Aviator No. 38. On October 12, 1917, Stone was assigned to the U.S. Navy Aeronautic Station at Rockaway, New York.

In May 1919 First Lieutenant Elmer F. Stone was one of the two pilots, along with Walter Hinton, on the first successful transatlantic flight on NC-4 with Lieutenant Commander Albert C. Read, USN, as the mission commander and navigator. After the historic flight, he was made a knight of the Order of the Tower and Sword by the Portuguese government (June 3, 1919), awarded the British Air Force Cross by the British government (June 9, 1919) and received a promotion to the temporary rank of captain on September 25, 1919. He was awarded the Navy Cross and Congressional Medal of Achievement for &quot;distinguished service in making the first successful trans-Atlantic flight&quot; on November 11, 1920.

For the next six years he worked with the Navy&#x27;s Bureau of Aeronautics where he assisted in the development of the catapults and arresting gear of the new aircraft carriers USS &quot;Lexington&quot; and , equipment still used on aircraft carriers to this day. He continued to promote aviation in the U.S. Coast Guard during the 1920s, He collaborated with the Curtiss Aeroplane and Motor Company on development of airborne &quot;motor lifeboats&quot; for the explicit purpose of lifesaving missions, and in this is one of the pioneers of modern air-sea rescue. He also commanded a former destroyer that was turned over to the U.S. Coast Guard and used in the enforcement of Prohibition.

After a tour at sea, Stone became the commanding officer of the Coast Guard Aviation Unit at Cape May, New Jersey, where he continued to develop his skill at making open-ocean landings. On April 5, 1933, Stone put his open-ocean landing skills to the test when the Navy dirigible &quot;Akron&quot; went down off the Atlantic coast in a storm with only three survivors of the 76 aboard, Stone was the only pilot available willing to attempt a landing in the heavy seas. He accomplished this successfully, but was too late to save any more lives. On December 20, 1934, he broke the world seaplane speed record, 191 miles per hour over a 3 kilometer test course.

Commander Stone&#x27;s last duty was as the commanding officer of the Air Patrol Detachment in San Diego.

He died of a heart attack while on duty on May 20, 1936, in San Diego, California, while inspecting a new aircraft and was buried in Arlington National Cemetery.

==Legacy==
Commander Elmer &quot;Archie&quot; Stone was inducted into the United States Naval Aviation Hall of Honor on May 5, 1983, and is also a member of the U.S. Coast Guard Aviation Hall of Fame. Stone was a pivotal figure in the establishment and development of aviation for the Coast Guard and the Navy and was a favorite of many of the famous aviation figures of the day, including Eddie Rickenbacker, aircraft designers Anthony Fokker, Igor Sikorsky, and Alexander P. de Seversky.

The ninth Legend-class National Security cutter USCGC &quot;Stone&quot; is named in honor of Commander Stone.

<doc id="908421" wikidata="Q2893126" url="?curid=908421" title="Beauce (electoral district)">
<text>Beauce () is a federal electoral district in Quebec, Canada, that has been represented in the House of Commons of Canada since 1867. In 2006, it had a population of 103,617 people, of whom 82,123 were eligible voters.

The Beauce riding has the highest percentage of people who answered &quot;Canadian&quot; as their ethnic origin in the 2006 Census (84.0%; multiple responses).

It is also the riding with the highest percentage of White people of European descent (99.3%).

==Geography==

The riding is located in Central Quebec, to the south of Quebec City and covers the centre of Beauce, straddling the Quebec region of Chaudière-Appalaches.

The electoral district has the regional county municipality of Beauce-Sartigan; the Regional County of Beauce-Centre, excepting the area of the former municipality of Courcelles; that part of the Regional County Municipality of Les Etchemins comprises the municipalities of Sainte-Aurélie, Saint-Benjamin, Saint-Prosper and Saint-Zacharie; the Regional County Municipality of La Nouvelle-Beauce, excepting the Parish Municipality of Saint-Lambert-de-Lauzon; and that part of the Regional County Municipality of Le Granit comprises the municipalities of Saint-Ludger and Saint-Robert-Bellarmin.

The neighbouring ridings are Mégantic—L&#x27;Érable, Lotbinière—Chutes-de-la-Chaudière, and Lévis—Bellechasse.

<doc id="908425" wikidata="Q1340448" url="?curid=908425" title="Introjection">
<text>In psychology, introjection (also known as identification or internalization) is the unconscious adoption of the thoughts or personality traits of others. It occurs as a normal part of development, such as a child taking on parental values and attitudes. It can also be a defense mechanism in situations that arouse anxiety.
It has been associated with both normal and pathological development.

== Theory ==

Introjection is a concept rooted in the psychoanalytic theories of unconscious motivations. Unconscious motivation refers to processes in the mind which occur automatically and bypass conscious examination and considerations.

Introjection is the learning process or in some cases a defense mechanism where a person unconsciously absorbs experiences and makes them part of their psyche.

===In learning=== 
In psychoanalysis, introjection () refers to an unconscious process wherein one takes components of another person&#x27;s identity, such as feelings, experiences and cognitive functioning, and transfers them inside themselves, making such experiences part of their new psychic structure. These components are obliterated from consciousness (splitting), perceived in someone else (projection), and then experienced and performed (i.e., introjected) by that other person. Cognate concepts are identification, incorporation and internalization.

===As a defense mechanism=== 
It is considered a self-stabilizing defense mechanism used when there is a lack of full psychological contact between a child and the adults providing that child&#x27;s psychological needs. In other words, it provides the illusion of maintaining relationship but at the expense of a loss of self. To use a simple example, a person who picks up traits from their friends is introjecting.

Another straightforward illustration could be a youngster who is being bullied at school. Unknowingly adopting the bully&#x27;s behavior, the victim youngster may do so to stop being picked on in the future.

Projection has been described as an early phase of introjection.

==Historic precursors==

In Freudian terms, introjection is the aspect of the ego&#x27;s system of relational mechanisms which handles checks and balances from a perspective external to what one normally considers &#x27;oneself&#x27;, infolding these inputs into the internal world of the self-definitions, where they can be weighed and balanced against one&#x27;s various senses of externality. For example:
* &quot;When a child envelops representational images of his absent parents into himself, simultaneously fusing them with his own personality.&quot; 
* &quot;Individuals with weak ego boundaries are more prone to use introjection as a defense mechanism.&quot;
According to D. W. Winnicott, &quot;projection and introjection mechanisms... let the other person be the manager sometimes, and to hand over omnipotence.&quot;

According to Freud, the ego and the superego are constructed by introjecting external behavioural patterns into the subject&#x27;s own person. Specifically, he maintained that the critical agency or the superego could be accounted for in terms of introjection and that the superego derives from the parents or other figures of authority. The derived behavioural patterns are not necessarily reproductions as they actually are but incorporated or introjected versions of them.

===Torok and Ferenczi===
However, the aforementioned description of introjection has been challenged by Maria Torok as she favours using the term as it is employed by Sándor Ferenczi in his essay &quot;The Meaning of Introjection&quot; (1912). In this context, introjection is an extension of autoerotic interests that broadens the ego by a lifting of repression so that it includes external objects in its make-up. Torok defends this meaning in her 1968 essay &quot;The Illness of Mourning and the Fantasy of the Exquisite Corpse&quot;, where she argues that Sigmund Freud and Melanie Klein confuse introjection with incorporation and that Ferenczi&#x27;s definition remains crucial to analysis. She emphasized that in failed mourning &quot;the impotence of the process of introjection (gradual, slow, laborious, mediated, effective)&quot; means that &quot;incorporation is the only choice: fantasmatic, unmediated, instantaneous, magical, sometimes hallucinatory...&#x27;crypt&#x27; effects (of incorporation)&quot;.

===Fritz and Laura Perls===
In Gestalt therapy, the concept of &quot;introjection&quot; is not identical with the psychoanalytical concept. Central to Fritz and Laura Perls&#x27; modifications was the concept of &quot;dental or oral aggression&quot;, when the infant develops teeth and is able to chew. They set &quot;introjection&quot; against &quot;assimilation&quot;. In &quot;Ego, Hunger and Aggression&quot;, Fritz and Laura Perls suggested that when the infant develops teeth, he or she has the capacity to chew, to break apart food, and assimilate it, in contrast to swallowing before; and by analogy to experience, to taste, accept, reject or assimilate.
Laura Perls explains: &quot;I think Freud said that development takes place through introjection, but if it remains introjection and goes no further, then it becomes a block; it becomes identification.&quot;

Thus Fritz and Laura Perls made &quot;assimilation&quot;, as opposed to &quot;introjection&quot;, a focal theme in Gestalt therapy and in their work, and the prime means by which growth occurs in therapy. In contrast to the psychoanalytic stance, in which the &quot;patient&quot; introjects the (presumably more healthy) interpretations of the analyst, in Gestalt therapy the client must &quot;taste&quot; with awareness their experience, and either accept or reject it, but not introject or &quot;swallow whole&quot;. Hence, the emphasis is on avoiding interpretation, and instead encouraging discovery. This is the key point in the divergence of Gestalt therapy from traditional psychoanalysis: growth occurs through gradual assimilation of experience in a natural way, rather than by accepting the interpretations of the analyst.

<doc id="908427" wikidata="Q6964125" url="?curid=908427" title="Nanoring">
<text>A nanoring is a cyclic nanostructure with a thickness small enough to be on the nanoscale (10−9 meters). Note that this definition allows the diameter of the ring to be larger than the nanoscale. Nanorings are a relatively recent development within the realm of nanoscience; the first peer-reviewed journal article mentioning these nanostructures came from researchers at the Institute of Physics and Center for Condensed Matter Physics in Beijing who synthesized nanorings made of gallium nitride in 2001. Zinc oxide, a compound very commonly used in nanostructures, was first synthesized into nanorings by researchers at Georgia Institute of Technology in 2004, and several other common nanostructure compounds have been synthesized into nanorings since. More recently, carbon-based nanorings have been synthesized from cyclo-para-phenylenes as well as porphyrins.

== Overview ==
Although nanorings may have a diameter on the nanoscale, many of these materials have diameters that are larger than 100 nm, with many nanorings having a diameter on the microscale (10−6 meters). As such, nanorings are considered to be members of a sub-class of nanomaterials called one-dimensional (1-D) nanomaterials. These are nanomaterials in which one of the three physical dimensions in a single unit of the material is on a length scale greater than the nanoscale. Other examples of one-dimensional nanomaterials are nanowires, nanobelts, nanotubes, and nanosheets.

=== Mechanical Uniqueness ===
As with other nanomaterials, much of the practical interest in nanorings arises from the fact that in nanorings, one can often observe quantized phenomena which are ordinarily unobservable in bulk matter. Nanorings, in particular, have a few additional properties which are of particular research interest. One-dimensional nanostructures have a variety of potential uses and applications but due to the dimensions of their extended crystal structures, they cannot be grown on discrete crystal growth sites and thus, cannot be synthesized on a substrate with any crystallographic predictability. Therefore, nanorings are most commonly synthesized aqueously by creating entropically unique conditions which induce spontaneous nanoring self-assembly. These materials are much more useful if they can be easily manipulated by mechanical or magnetic forces as many one-dimensional nanostructures are extremely fragile and, thus, difficult to manipulate into useful environments. It has now been demonstrated that ZnO nanorings made from the spontaneous folding of a single nanobelt crystal can be extensively mechanically manipulated without breaking or fracturing, giving them a unique mechanical advantage over other classes of ZnO nanostructures.

== Synthesis ==
Generally, nanorings are synthesized using a bottom-up approach, as top-down syntheses are limited by the entropic barriers presented by these materials. Currently, the number of different synthetic techniques used to make these particles is almost as diverse as the number of different types of nanorings themselves. One common method for synthesizing nanorings involves first synthesizing nanobelts or nanowires with an uneven charge distribution focused on the edges of the material. If these criteria are met, these particles may naturally self-assemble into ring structures such that Coulomb repulsion forces are minimized within the resulting crystal. Other approaches for nanoring synthesis include the assembly of a nanoring around a small seed particle which is later removed or the expansion and twisting of porphyrin-like structures into a hollow nanoring structure.

<doc id="908429" wikidata="Q231084" url="?curid=908429" title="Rosa Mota">
<text>Rosa Maria Correia dos Santos Mota, (; born 29 June 1958) is a Portuguese former marathon runner, one of her country&#x27;s foremost athletes, being the first sportswoman from Portugal to win Olympic gold. Mota was the first woman to win multiple Olympic marathon medals as well as being the only woman to be the reigning European, World, and Olympic champion at the same time. On the 30th Anniversary Gala of the Association of International Marathons and Distance Races (AIMS) she was distinguished as the greatest female marathon runner of all time.

==Biography==
Born in Porto&#x27;s downtown neighbourhood of Foz Velha, Rosa started participating in cross-country races while in high school.

In 1980 she met José Pedrosa, the man who would eventually be her personal trainer for her entire career. Rosa Mota&#x27;s first marathon was at the European Championships of 1982, hosted by Athens, Greece - the first Women&#x27;s Marathon ever. Mota was not one of the favourites for gold, but she easily beat Ingrid Kristiansen to win her first marathon.

This success was typical of Rosa Mota&#x27;s career, as she usually finished well in the prestigious marathons. She was awarded the bronze medal in the first Women&#x27;s Olympic Marathon in the Los Angeles Olympic Games. Her personal best time was 2:23:29 in the 1985 Chicago Marathon. Mota won the Chicago Marathon twice.

European Champion in 1986, and World Champion in Rome, 1987, she kept on winning with the Olympic gold medal in Seoul 1988, where with 2 km left in the race, she attacked, winning by 13 seconds from silver medalist Lisa Martin.

In 1990, she returned to Boston to win for a third time beating Uta Pippig. After that she attempted to defend her European Marathon Championship in Split. She ran from the front and had a lead of over 1.5 minutes at the half way mark, but she was caught at the 35 km mark by Valentina Yegorova. They battled to the finish and Mota won by a slim margin of five seconds. As of 2006, winning a third European Championships marathon was unprecedented for both men and women. She won the 1991 Lisbon Half Marathon

Despite all her success Rosa Mota was suffering from sciatica and asthma as a child, yet, in 1991, she continued winning, this time the London Marathon. Later that year, Mota had to abandon the Tokyo World championships and she finally considered retirement after failing to finish the 1992 London Marathon.

Mota ran 21 marathon races between 1982 and 1992. She averaged two marathons a year for a decade and won 14 of those races.

== Achievements ==
== After retirement ==

Considered an Ambassador of Sport, in 1998 she won the Abebe Bikila Award for contributions to the development of long-distance race training. The trophy was awarded at the end of the International Race for Friendship, sponsored by the United Nations, taking place in the morning before the 1998 New York City Marathon.

Rosa Mota was one of the most popular personalities of Portuguese sport in the late 20th century, alongside Eusébio, Carlos Lopes and Luís Figo.

Rosa Mota carried the Olympic flame along the roads of Athens before the 2004 Summer Olympics in Greece.

<doc id="908431" wikidata="Q423282" url="?curid=908431" title="Cyclohexanol">
<text>Cyclohexanol is the organic compound with the formula HOCH(CH2)5. The molecule is related to cyclohexane by replacement of one hydrogen atom by a hydroxyl group. This compound exists as a deliquescent colorless solid with a camphor-like odor, which, when very pure, melts near room temperature. Millions of tonnes are produced annually, mainly as a precursor to nylon.

==Production==
Cyclohexanol is produced by the oxidation of cyclohexane in air, typically using cobalt catalysts:
:2 C6H12 + O2 → 2 C6H11OH
This process coforms cyclohexanone, and this mixture (&quot;KA oil&quot; for ketone-alcohol oil) is the main feedstock for the production of adipic acid. The oxidation involves radicals and the intermediacy of the hydroperoxide C6H11O2H.
Alternatively, cyclohexanol can be produced by the hydrogenation of phenol:
:C6H5OH + 3 H2 → C6H11OH
This process can also be adjusted to favor the formation of cyclohexanone.

==Basic reactions==
Cyclohexanol undergoes the main reactions expected for a secondary alcohol. Oxidation gives cyclohexanone, which is converted on a large scale in industry to the oxime, a precursor to caprolactam. As a laboratory exercise, this oxidation can be effected with chromic acid. Esterification affords the commercially useful derivatives dicyclohexyladipate and dicyclohexylphthalate, which are used as plasticizers. Heating in the presence of acid catalysts converts cyclohexanol to cyclohexene.

==Structure==
Cyclohexanol has at least two solid phases. One of them is a plastic crystal.

==Applications==
As indicated above, cyclohexanol is an important feedstock in the polymer industry, firstly as a precursor to nylons, but also to various plasticizers. Small amounts are used as a solvent.

==Safety==
Cyclohexanol is moderately toxic: the Threshold Limit Value for the vapor for 8 h is 50 ppm. The IDLH concentration is set at 400 ppm, based on studies on the acute oral toxicity in animals. Few studies have been done on its carcinogenicity, but one study on rats found it to have co-carcinogenic effects.

<text>Robson Street is a major southeast-northwest thoroughfare in downtown and West End of Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. Its core commercial blocks from Burrard Street to Jervis were also known as Robsonstrasse. Its name honours John Robson, a major figure in British Columbia&#x27;s entry into the Canadian Confederation, and Premier of the province from 1889 to 1892. Robson Street starts at BC Place Stadium near the north shore of False Creek, then runs northwest past Vancouver Library Square, Robson Square and the Vancouver Art Gallery, coming to an end at Lost Lagoon in Stanley Park.

As of 2006, the city of Vancouver overall had the fifth most expensive retail rental rates in the world, averaging US$135 per square foot per year, citywide. Robson Street tops Vancouver with its most expensive locations renting for up to US$200 per square foot per year. In 2006, both Robson Street and the Mink Mile on Bloor Street in Toronto were the 22nd most expensive streets in the world, with rents of $208 per square feet. In 2007, the Mink Mile and Robson slipped to 25th in the world with an average of $198 per square feet. The price of each continues to grow with Vancouver being Burberry&#x27;s first Canadian location and Toronto&#x27;s Yorkville neighbourhood (which is bounded on the south side by Bloor) now commanding rents of $300 per square foot.

==History==

In 1895, streetcar tracks were laid down the street, supporting a concentration of shops and restaurants. From the early to middle-late 20th century, and especially after significant immigration from postwar Germany, the northwest end of Robson Street was known as a centre of German culture and commerce in Vancouver, earning the nickname &quot;Robsonstrasse&quot;, even among non-Germans (this name lives on in the Robsonstrasse Hotel on the street). At one time, the city had placed streetsigns reading &quot;Robsonstrasse&quot; though these were placed after the German presence in the area had largely vanished.

In 1981, a development team presented the city government with a proposal to build a glass canopy over sections of Robson Street. It was designed by architect Bing Thom to promote year-round use of the street and add more retail space. The proposal was withdrawn in January 1982 due to an unwillingness from the city to change zoning codes to accommodate the project.

Robson Street was featured on an old edition of the Canadian Monopoly board as one of the two most expensive properties.

==Upscale shopping==
Robson Street&#x27;s role as a consumer district continues to the present day although the original flavour of the street, which was all small neighbourhood-market stores, has been supplanted by massive redevelopment by brand-name chain stores and high-end restaurants. Robson Street is particularly famous for the fashion shops and dining which extends from Granville Street in the southeast to Denman Street in the northwest, with the main concentration centred between Burrard and Bute Streets, which is the area also known historically as Robsonstrasse.

Although not technically on Robson Street but still considered part of the district, the &#x27;Vancouver Luxury Zone&#x27; contain the most expensive upscale stores in the city. It is anchored on Alberni Street and Georgia Streets as they intersect Burrard Street .

==Robson and Thurlow==
Robson street&#x27;s intersection with Thurlow Street was known for having two Starbucks coffee shops on opposite corners, one of which was non-smoking prior to the enactment of the indoor smoking ban, and the other not. The location on the west corner is known as a major meeting place for the biker culture, with motorcycles parked in a special bikes-only strip of parking painted on the pavement. It was also this corner of Robson and Thurlow that acted as the epicentre of the Stanley Cup Riot of 1994.

==Neighbourhoods==
There are numerous highrises along or near Robson, many of them condo towers and hotels. The Empire Landmark Hotel, originally the Sheraton Landmark, was the tallest highrise on the strip at 42 storeys. It included the Cloud Nine revolving restaurant.

There are numerous residential condo and apartment towers under construction along the southeastern end of Robson near Yaletown past the bustling Granville Mall, whereas the northwestern end becomes part of Vancouver&#x27;s West End neighbourhood containing older residential highrises near the quieter Stanley Park and Lost Lagoon; the last few blocks of Robson between Denman and Lost Lagoon are part of the Stanley Park Neighbourhood.

Robson Street is also popular as a cruising street, with many exotic, rare cars and motorcycles present every weekend throughout the summer.

<text>Houdini is a 3D animation software application developed by Toronto-based SideFX, who adapted it from the PRISMS suite of procedural generation software tools.

The procedural tools are used to produce different effects such as complex reflections, animations and particles system. Some of its procedural features have been in existence since 1987.

Houdini is most commonly used for the creation of visual effects in film and television. It is used by major VFX companies such as Walt Disney Animation Studios, Pixar, DreamWorks Animation, Double Negative, ILM, MPC, Framestore, Sony Pictures Imageworks, Illumination Studios Paris, Scanline VFX, Method Studios and The Mill.

It has been used in many feature animation productions, including Disney&#x27;s feature films &quot;Fantasia 2000&quot;, &quot;Frozen&quot;, &quot;Zootopia&quot; and &quot;Raya and the Last Dragon&quot;; the Blue Sky Studios film &quot;Rio&quot;, and DNA Productions&#x27; &quot;Ant Bully&quot;.

SideFX also publishes Houdini Apprentice, a limited version of the software that is free of charge for non-commercial use.

== Release history==
==Features==

Houdini covers all the major areas of 3D production, including these:

* Modeling – All standard geometry entities including Polygons, (Hierarchical) NURBS/Bézier Curves/Patches &amp; Trims, Metaballs
* Animation – Keyframed animation and raw channel manipulation (CHOPs), motion capture support
* Rigging - proprietary KineFX and APEX systems
* Particles
* Dynamics – Rigid Body Dynamics, Fluid Dynamics, Wire Dynamics, Cloth Simulation, Crowd simulation.
* Lighting – node-based shader authoring, lighting and re-lighting in an IPR viewer
* Rendering – Houdini ships with SideFX&#x27;s rendering engines Mantra and Karma; Houdini Indie licence and up support 3rd party rendering engines, such as Renderman, Octane, Arnold, Redshift, V-ray, Maxwell(soon).
* Volumetrics – With its native CloudFx and PyroFx toolsets, Houdini can create clouds, smoke and fire simulations.
* Compositing – full compositor of floating-point deep (layered) images.
* Plugin Development – development libraries for user extensibility.

Houdini is an open environment and supports a variety of scripting APIs. Python is increasingly the scripting language of choice for the package, and is intended to substitute its original C Shell-like scripting language, HScript. However, any major scripting languages which support socket communication can interface with Houdini.

== Tools ==
===Operators===
Houdini&#x27;s procedural nature is found in its operators. Digital assets are generally constructed by connecting sequences of operators (or OPs). This proceduralism has several advantages: it allows users to construct highly detailed geometric or organic objects in comparatively very few steps; it enables and encourages non-linear development; and new operators can be created in terms of existing operators, a flexible alternative to non-procedural scripting often relied on in other packages for customisation. Houdini uses this procedural generation in production of textures, shaders, particles, &quot;channel data&quot; (data used to drive animation), rendering and compositing.

Houdini&#x27;s operator-based structure is divided into several main groups:
*OBJs – nodes that pass transform information (Traditionally these contain SOPs.)
*SOPs – Surface Operators – for procedural modelling.
*POPs – Particle Operators – used to manipulate particles systems.
*CHOPs – Channel Operators – for procedural animation and audio manipulation.
*COPs – Composite Operators – used to perform compositing on footages.
*DOPs – Dynamic Operators – for dynamic simulations for fluids, cloth, rigid body interaction etc.
*SHOPs – Shading Operator – for representing a dozen or more different shading types for several different renderers.
*ROPs – render operators – for building networks to represent different render passes and render dependencies.
*VOPs – VEX operators – for building nodes of any of the above types using a highly optimized SIMD architecture.
*TOPs - Task Operators
*LOPs - Lighting Operators - for generating USD describing characters, props, lighting, and rendering.

Operators are connected together in networks. Data flows through, manipulated by each operator in turn. This data could represent 3D geometry, bitmap images, particles, dynamics, shader algorithms, animation, audio, or a combination of these. This node graph architecture is similar to that employed in node-based compositors such as Shake or Nuke.

Complex networks can be grouped into a single meta-operator node which behaves like a class definition, and can be instantiated in other networks like any compiled node. In this way users can create their own sophisticated tools without the need for programming. In this way Houdini can be regarded as a highly interactive visual programming toolkit which makes programming more accessible to artists.

Houdini&#x27;s set of tools are mostly implemented as operators. This has led to a higher learning curve than other comparable tools. It is one thing to know what all the nodes do – but the key to success with Houdini is understanding how to represent a desired creative outcome as a network of nodes. Successful users are generally familiar with a large repertoire of networks (algorithms) which achieve standard creative outcomes. The overhead involved in acquiring this repertoire of algorithms is offset by the artistic and algorithmic flexibility afforded by access to lower level building blocks with which to configure shot element creation routines. In large productions, the development of a procedural network to solve a specific element creation challenge makes automation trivial. Many studios that use Houdini on large feature effects, and feature animation projects develop libraries of procedures that can be used to automate generation of many of the elements for that film with almost no artist interaction.

Also unique to Houdini is the range of I/O OPs available to animators, including MIDI devices, raw files or TCP connections, audio devices (including built-in phoneme and pitch detection), mouse cursor position, and so on. Of particular note is Houdini&#x27;s ability to work with audio, including sound and music synthesis and spatial 3D sound processing tools. These operators exist in the context called &quot;CHOPs&quot; for which Side Effects won a Technical Achievement Academy Award in 2002.

VEX (Vector Expression) is one of Houdini&#x27;s internal languages. It is similar to the Renderman Shading Language. Using VEX a user can develop custom SOPs, POPs, shaders, etc. The current implementation of VEX utilizes SIMD-style processing.

==Rendering==
Houdini is bundled with a production-class renderer, Mantra, which had many similarities to RenderMan in its scope and application in its initial incarnation. Micropolygon rendering is supported, allowing high-quality displacement operations as well as traditional scan-line and raytracing modes. Shaders are scriptable and composed in their VEX language, or by using VOPs; their node-based interface to programming VEX. Mantra (as does Houdini itself) also supports point-clouds, which can be similar in application as brickmaps in Renderman. This allows more complicated light interactions, such as sub-surface scattering and ambient occlusion, to be produced with lower computational overhead. Mantra can perform extremely fast volume rendering, and also physically based path-tracing – a technique which attempts to more accurately model the physical interactions of light and materials.

==TouchDesigner==
&quot;Derivative Inc.&quot; is a spin-off of Side Effects Software that markets a derivative of Houdini called TouchDesigner. Tailored toward real-time OpenGL-generated animation, it was used on rock group Rush&#x27;s 30th-anniversary tour to produce dynamic graphics driven directly by the musicians. TouchDesigner was also used by Xite Labs (formerly V Squared Labs) to create live visuals for Amon Tobin&#x27;s ISAM installation tour.

== Production ==
Notable works in which Houdini was used include the 1997 &quot;Contact&quot; movie and more recent 2016 &quot;Zootopia.&quot;

<text>Harry Leonard Cooper, , more commonly known as Dr. Harry is an Australian veterinarian and television personality, who is best known for his media appearances.

==Career==
Cooper graduated with second-class honours from Sydney University’s Faculty of Veterinary Science in December 1965, at the age of 22. He practised for several years across Sydney and the UK before his burgeoning media career became a full-time commitment. 

Cooper began his media career in a veterinary segment on a morning TV talk show in Sydney. Later, he became known as the resident veterinary surgeon on the long-running series &quot;Burke&#x27;s Backyard&quot;. In 1993, Cooper hosted his first series, &quot;Talk to the Animals&quot;. In 1997, he began presenting the veterinary series &quot;Harry&#x27;s Practice&quot;, assisted by fellow vet Katrina Warren. Despite consistently high ratings, the program was cancelled in 2003.

From 2004 onwards, Cooper has presented a veterinary segment on the lifestyle program &quot;Better Homes and Gardens&quot;. He is also an animal welfare advocate and public speaker. In July 2023, he began narrating the television series &quot;Animals Aboard with Dr. Harry&quot;.

As part of the Queen’s Birthday 2014 honours, he was appointed as a Member of the Order of Australia (OAM) for his services to veterinary science and animal welfare.

==Personal life==
It was revealed that Cooper had been diagnosed with prostate cancer in late 2007. After more than six months of intensive radiation treatment, the cancer was in remission and he continued his appearances on TV.

After 21 years living in Tasmania, Cooper moved to the Mid-North Coast of New South Wales in 2011. In March 2012, he revealed that he had separated from Janine Morganti, his wife of 26 years. The couple had three children and have five grandchildren. His eldest daughter, Tiffany, died from colon cancer in 2012.

In 2022, he married long-time partner, Sue Sheeran, on their property at Port Macquarie, New South Wales.

Cooper believes that Australia should become a republic.

<text>Jack Kent Cooke (October 25, 1912 – April 6, 1997) was a Canadian American businessman in broadcasting and professional sports. Starting in sales, Cooke was very successful, eventually becoming a partner in a network of radio stations and newspapers in Canada. After failing at starting a major league baseball team in Toronto and being turned down to own a television station in Toronto, Cooke moved to the United States and built a business empire in broadcasting and professional sports franchises. 

Cooke was the owner of the Washington Redskins (NFL), the Los Angeles Lakers (NBA), the Los Angeles Kings (NHL), the Los Angeles Wolves (United Soccer), and the Toronto Maple Leafs (IL). He also developed The Forum in Inglewood, California, and Jack Kent Cooke Stadium, now Northwest Stadium, in Landover, Maryland. Under his ownership, the Lakers won the 1972 NBA Finals while the Redskins won Super Bowls in 1982, 1987, and 1991.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Born in Hamilton, Ontario, Cooke moved with his family to The Beaches area of Toronto in 1921, where he attended Malvern Collegiate Institute.

At age 14, Cooke got a job selling encyclopedias. At the end of his first day, he took home over $20 to his mother, and later claimed, &quot;I think that was the proudest moment of my life.&quot; He later became a runner on the floor of the Toronto Stock Exchange. He was selling soap in Northern Ontario for Colgate-Palmolive in 1936 when he met Roy Thomson, who hired Cooke to run radio station CJCS in Stratford, Ontario. The two became partners in 1941, buying radio stations and newspapers in Ontario and Quebec.

====Early foray in media and sports ownership====
With the financial backing of J. P. Bickell, Cooke purchased CKCL (under Toronto Broadcasting Co.) in 1945, changing the call letters to CKEY. He also continued to work with Thomson, and the two acquired the Canadian edition of &quot;Liberty&quot; magazine in 1948, naming it &quot;New Liberty&quot;. The following year, Thomson sold his half of the magazine to Cooke.

In 1951, Cooke ventured into sports, acquiring the minor league Toronto Maple Leafs baseball club. Upon purchasing the team, Cooke informed the media that the Maple Leafs would be integrated immediately, signing second baseman Charlie White and pitcher-outfielder Leon Day within two weeks of the acquisition. Day, a future Hall of Famer, pitched in 14 games that season and then moved on to other teams. White and Day paved the way for future black Maple Leafs like Sam Jethroe, Elston Howard, Earl Battey, Dave Pope, Humberto Robinson, Connie Johnson, Lou Johnson, Mack Jones, Marshall Bridges, and Reggie Smith – not to mention later generations of black players who starred with Toronto&#x27;s eventual Major League Baseball franchise, the Blue Jays.

Cooke transformed the games from straight athletic contests into complete entertainment packages, with a long list of special promotions and celebrity appearances. With his focus on entertainment, Cooke was compared to St. Louis Browns owner Bill Veeck. Five months after becoming owner, Cooke presented a 48-page booklet to all the teams in the league, outlining his promotional strategies. He was named minor league executive of the year by &quot;The Sporting News&quot; in 1952. That same year, Cooke purchased Consolidated Press, publisher of &quot;Saturday Night&quot; magazine. He made an unsuccessful bid for &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; newspaper in 1955.

While owning the Maple Leafs baseball team, Cooke set his sights on bringing a major league club to Toronto. He tried to purchase the St. Louis Browns, Philadelphia Athletics and Detroit Tigers when they came up for sale, and in 1959 he became one of the founding team owners in the Continental League, a proposed third major league for professional baseball. The league disbanded a year later without ever playing a game. Cooke still hoped to get an American League expansion team in Toronto, but the city&#x27;s lack of a major league venue became an impasse. 

On the field, Cooke&#x27;s Maple Leafs were an International League powerhouse, finishing in first place during the regular season four times, capturing the 1960 Governors&#x27; Cup as playoff champions, and leading the circuit in attendance every year between 1952 and 1956. Between 1953 and 1959, Cooke operated the Leafs without a major-league affiliation, buying or trading for the contracts of most of the players on his roster from MLB clubs. Veteran minor-league slugger Rocky Nelson, who won the IL&#x27;s &quot;Triple Crown&quot; in 1958, rode his two-year Toronto stay to one final big-league opportunity with the Pittsburgh Pirates in 1959, where he became one of the stars of their 1960 world champions. Organizations also loaned players like Howard and Battey to Cooke&#x27;s Maple Leafs to advance their development. 

Cooke sold the Maple Leafs in 1964. Before that, he had watched several team practices and observed Sparky Anderson, noting the player&#x27;s leadership qualities and ability to teach younger players from all backgrounds. Cooke encouraged Anderson to pursue a career in managing, offering him the post for the Leafs. In 1964, Anderson accepted the offer. Cooke was inducted into the Canadian Baseball Hall of Fame in 1985.

In 1960, Cooke lost a bid to obtain a licence for the first privately owned TV station in Toronto. There had been nine bids in a highly competitive process, and the licence was awarded to a consortium of Aldred-Rogers Broadcasting and the Telegram Corporation, which launched CFTO-TV.

===Move to the United States===
Within weeks of being turned down for the Toronto TV license, Cooke applied for U.S. citizenship. With the support of U.S. Representative Francis E. Walter (D-Pa.), Cooke quickly became a citizen when both houses of Congress and President Dwight D. Eisenhower approved a waiver of the usual five-year waiting period. 

Originally established about 1899, incorporated in 1929, as &quot;Consolidated Press Limited&quot;, the company changed hands on 23 October 1952,&lt;ref name=&quot;theglobeandmail/25424243&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; when Consolidated Press Limited&#x27;, publishers of Saturday Night and Canadian Home Journal magazines, was bought by Jack Kent Cooke, and in 1958, changed its name to &quot;Consolidated Frybrook Industries Limited&quot;, and, launched in spring 1959, in New York City, a subsidiary, &quot;Strand Records&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;Billboard/1960-10-17&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; an American budget label.&lt;ref name=&quot;carleton/wcl/Z1-1960&quot; &gt;[https://oaresource.library.carleton.ca/wcl/2016/20160615/Z1-1960-2-2-eng.pdf &quot;Royal Commission on Publications&quot; Report], May 1961&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;bhCA/jkc&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;bsnpubs/strand&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Cooke sold CKEY at the end of 1960 and Consolidated Press in 1961.

At the time, Canada and the U.S. both had laws prohibiting foreign control of radio and TV stations. Cooke had entered the U.S. broadcasting industry in August 1959 by acquiring Pasadena, California radio station KRLA 1110 (now KWVE) through his brother, Donald Cooke, a U.S. citizen.

Cooke formed American Cablevision in the 1960s and acquired several cable television companies. He acquired majority ownership of TelePrompTer cable TV, and sold it in the late 1970s for $646 million. In 1979, he acquired the Chrysler Building in New York City, one of the world&#x27;s most renowned skyscrapers. In 1985, Cooke bought the &quot;Los Angeles Daily News&quot; for $176 million. A year later, he acquired another cable TV company. He sold the cable systems in 1989.

===Sports ownership===
====Washington Redskins====

In 1960, Cooke purchased 25% interest in the Washington Redskins of the National Football League (NFL) for $300,000. He purchased majority interest in the team from team president Edward Bennett Williams in 1974, replaced him as controlling owner in 1979, and became sole owner in 1985. As owner of the Redskins, the team won three Super Bowls under head coach Joe Gibbs (in 1982, 1987, and 1991), the franchise&#x27;s first championships since the 1940s. Cooke oversaw the construction of Jack Kent Cooke Stadium, now known as Northwest Stadium, which opened in Landover, Maryland, following his death in 1997. In his will, he left the team and stadium to his foundation with instructions to sell. Cooke&#x27;s son and team president John Kent Cooke managed the team for two years before selling the franchise in 1999 to local businessman Daniel Snyder for $800 million.

====Los Angeles Lakers====

In September 1965, Cooke purchased the Los Angeles Lakers for $5 million (equivalent to $ million in in current dollar terms) from Bob Short. Under Cooke&#x27;s ownership the Lakers moved from the Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena to The Forum and changed their colors from Royal and Light Blue to the current Purple (which he referred to as &quot;Forum Blue&quot;) and Gold. Under Cooke&#x27;s ownership, the Lakers reached seven NBA Finals and won the 1972 NBA championship.

====Los Angeles Kings====
As a Canadian, Cooke particularly enjoyed ice hockey, and he was determined to bring the National Hockey League (NHL) to Los Angeles. In 1966, the NHL announced it intended to sell six new franchises, and Cooke prepared a bid. The Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum Commission, which operated the Sports Arena, supported a competing bid headed by Los Angeles Rams owner Dan Reeves and advised Cooke that if he won the franchise he would not be allowed to use that facility. In response, Cooke threatened to build a new arena in the Los Angeles suburb of Inglewood. Nearly 30 years later Cooke told the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; sportswriter Steve Springer that he recalled &quot;one official representing the commission laughing at him&quot; (Springer&#x27;s words) when Cooke warned he would build in Inglewood. Cooke won the franchise, and paid $2 million for the new Los Angeles NHL club, which he called the &quot;Kings.&quot; Springer: &quot;Cooke went to Inglewood and built the Forum. Good-bye, Lakers. Good-bye, Kings.&quot; The Kings played their first game on October 14, 1967—at the Long Beach Arena while construction was being completed at Cooke&#x27;s new arena.

Cooke claimed The Forum would be &quot;the most beautiful arena in the world.&quot; It opened December 30, 1967, to rave reviews. Cooke was soon calling it &quot;The Fabulous Forum.&quot; However, the Kings struggled both on the ice and at the gate. Cooke had been told that there were more than 300,000 former Canadians living within a three-hour drive of Los Angeles and remarked, &quot;Now I know why they left Canada: They hate hockey!&quot;

In May 1979, Cooke sold the Forum, the Kings, and the Lakers to Jerry Buss for a then-record $67.5 million (equivalent to $ million in ); half of the payment was in cash and half was in real estate, with part of Buss&#x27;s payment including the Chrysler Building.

====Los Angeles Wolves====
In 1967, Cooke was a founder of the United Soccer Association and owned the Los Angeles Wolves team, which became a charter NASL team the following year.

==== Boxing ====
In 1971, Cooke was a financial backer of the first Muhammad Ali vs Joe Frazier boxing match, held at Madison Square Garden and won by Frazier.

====Elmendorf Farm====
A lover of horses and a fan of Thoroughbred horse racing, Cooke owned Kent Farms, a estate in Middleburg, Virginia, not far from Washington, D.C. In December 1984 he purchased the historic Elmendorf Farm in Lexington, Kentucky from the estate of Maxwell Gluck. He bred and raced a number of successful horses, notably Flying Continental, sired by Flying Paster, whose wins included the 1990 Jockey Club Gold Cup.

==Personal life==

Cooke was married five times, however his last two marriages were to the same woman, Marlene Ramallo Chalmers. He was married to Chalmers at the time of his death.

Cooke&#x27;s first marriage, his longest, lasted 45 years. He and 17-year-old&lt;ref name=&quot;wapo/1997/cooke2&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Barbara Jean Carnegie,&lt;ref name=&quot;latimes/2012-jul-22-la-sp-sn-barbara-jean&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; married in 1934, divorcing in 1979. In the legal action, Carnegie was awarded what was then the largest divorce settlement in history—$42 million (equivalent to $ million in ). The &quot;record divorce settlement precipitated his sale of the Lakers, the Kings and the Forum to Jerry Buss&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;latimes/me-passings-20120721&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The presiding judge during the bench trial was Joseph Wapner, who later became famous as the judge on television&#x27;s &quot;The People&#x27;s Court&quot;. Cooke and Carnegie had two sons: John Kent Cooke and Ralph Kent Cooke. Ralph Kent Cooke&#x27;s son, Jack Kent Cooke II, &quot;died of alcoholic liver disease and a related heart condition&quot;, at 26, in January 1989.&lt;ref name=&quot;latimes/1989-02-26-me-835&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 31, 1980, Cooke married Jeanne Maxwell Williams, a sculptor from Las Vegas. The marriage lasted 10 months. It ended with a $1 million (equivalent to $ million in ) divorce settlement.

Cooke&#x27;s third marriage on July 24, 1987, to Suzanne Elizabeth Martin, a college dropout aged 31 at the time and 43 years his junior, was even shorter at 73 days. Cooke agreed to marry Martin if she signed a prenuptial agreement and aborted the first-trimester fetus she was carrying (as a result of having skipped taking one or two birth control pills). It would have been her third abortion in two years. After their wedding, Martin told Cooke she had changed her mind, deciding to keep the baby, and she and Cooke separated four weeks later. After they divorced, Martin gave birth to a girl who was named Jacqueline Kent Cooke. In her divorce action, where her lawyers used the child as a &quot;wedge&quot;, Martin sought $15 million (equivalent to $ million in ) from Cooke, plus $18,000 ($ in current dollar terms) a month in alimony and child support. In Fauquier County Circuit Court, a judge rejected Martin&#x27;s request that he ignore the prenuptial agreement, and improve her financial settlement in which she received a $75,000 ($ in current dollar terms) annual stipend, a Jaguar, and the use for five years of an apartment in the Watergate complex. Cooke&#x27;s lawyer Milton Gould said: &quot;This is a conspiracy to try to use a little kid as a means of getting money. Well, we&#x27;re not going to abandon this child. She will get money but the woman doesn&#x27;t deserve any...there have been few courtesans in the history of the world who have been as well rewarded as this one.&quot;

Cooke married his fourth wife, Marlene Ramallo Chalmers on May 5, 1990. They were divorced in late 1993 after she made headlines in September by driving drunk in the Georgetown section of Washington, D.C., with a man holding onto the hood and pounding on the windshield of her car. They remarried in 1995 and remained together until his death.

Cooke died of congestive heart failure on April 6, 1997, at George Washington University Hospital in Washington, D.C. A memorial service was held at Trinity Episcopal Church in Upperville, Virginia, on April 10 and was attended by more than 400 Washington and sports dignitaries.

His will received considerable public attention. His will gave his daughter Jacqueline a trust fund of $5 million (equivalent to $ million in ) but nothing to her mother, Suzanne Elizabeth Martin, &quot;because of her misconduct and behavior which were calculated to harm me&quot;. His final wife, Marlene Ramallo Chalmers, was also cut out of his will; she filed a lawsuit against Cooke&#x27;s estate and reportedly received $20 million in a settlement about a year after Cooke&#x27;s death.

The bulk of Cooke&#x27;s $825 million estate went into establishing the Jack Kent Cooke Foundation, whose stated mission was to &quot;help young people of exceptional promise reach their full potential through education.&quot; The scholarship program available to high-achieving high school seniors with financial need who seek to attend and graduate from the nation&#x27;s best four-year colleges and universities. Cooke, an autodidact who didn&#x27;t have the opportunity to get a college education due to the Great Depression, was a longtime supporter of the UNCF. He was described as a lover of the written word, and his commitment explicitly sought to &quot;support the dreams of the next generation of big thinkers that came from challenging backgrounds, regardless of race, creed, color, gender, or national origin.&quot;

In February 2007, his daughter Jacqueline filed a $275 million lawsuit against the estate, seeking more money than her $5 million trust fund.

<text>Southland District is a New Zealand territorial authority district that covers most of the southern end of the South Island as well as Stewart Island.

==History==
Southland District was formed through the 1989 local government reforms. Four local authorities were amalgamated at that time: Wallace County, Winton Borough, Stewart Island County and most of Southland County. John Casey, who was first elected onto Southland County Council in 1977, oversaw the amalgamation and was elected Southland District&#x27;s first mayor in 1989.

Winton Wallacetown Ward was renamed Oreti Ward with effect from the Council election on 12 October 2019. The Ōreti River flows through this ward.

==Geography==
Southland District covers the majority of the land area of Southland Region, although the region also covers Gore District, Invercargill City and adjacent territorial waters. It has a land area of , excluding inland waters such as Lake Te Anau, Lake Manapouri, and Lake Hauroko.

Southland District contains the islands south of Foveaux Strait:

*Solander Islands
*Stewart Island/Rakiura
*Ruapuke Island

The seat of the district council is Invercargill, which, however, is not part of Southland District, but a territorial authority in its own right.

Two of New Zealand&#x27;s largest national parks are within the boundaries of Southland District: Fiordland National Park, and Rakiura National Park (which covers most of Stewart Island/Rakiura).

<text>Harold R. &quot;Harry&quot; Spira, BVSc MRCVS MACVSc HDA was an Australian veterinarian, geneticist and dog fancier who was instrumental in the development of dog breeding programs which used artificial insemination and frozen semen. An author and respected dog-show judge, he was active in the Australian National Kennel Club and proposed an alternative system of dog breed grouping.

==Career==
Among his myriad activities, Spira participated in the promotion of the Afghan Hound in Australia and was an outspoken opponent of breed-specific legislation against the German Shepherd dog. His book &quot;Canine Terminology&quot;, which has come to be considered a standard text on the subject, was reprinted in 2006.

Spira was the first Australian appointed to judge the coveted Best In Show award at Crufts Dog Show in England.

==Death==
Spira died at the end of the decade of the 2000s.

<text>Freedom Communications, Inc. was an American media conglomerate that operated daily and weekly newspapers, websites and mobile applications, as well as &quot;Coast Magazine&quot; and other specialty publications. Headquartered at 625 N. Grand Avenue in Santa Ana, California, it was owned by a private equity firm, 2100 Trust, established in 2010 by investor Aaron Kushner. Freedom&#x27;s flagship newspaper was the &quot;Orange County Register&quot;, based in Santa Ana.

==Ownership==
Founder R.C. Hoiles gained a one-third interest in his first newspaper (&quot;The Alliance Review&quot; in Ohio) sometime in the 1910s. He and his brother Frank bought many more local newspapers over the next several decades. In 1935 he moved his base of operations to Santa Ana, California, and in 1950 he incorporated his syndicate as Freedom Newspapers, Inc. It was renamed Freedom Communications in 1993. The company became a television station owner in 1984, with the acquisition of its first two stations WTVC-TV, Chattanooga, Tennessee and KFDM-TV, Beaumont, Texas. The Freedom television group eventually grew to six stations, including WRGB-TV Albany, New York, WPEC-TV West Palm Beach, Florida, WWMT-TV, Kalamazoo, Michigan and KTVL-TV Medford, Oregon. Freedom was operated as an entirely family-owned business until 2004, when private-equity firms Blackstone Group and Providence Equity Partners acquired a 40 percent share in Freedom for about $460 million. As part of this transaction, Freedom had acquired substantial debt.

On September 1, 2009, Freedom Communications went into a Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization. The company left bankruptcy on April 30, 2010, under the ownership of investment firms Alden Global Capital, Angelo, Gordon &amp; Co. and Luxor Capital Group. Lenders to the company also retained a stake in Freedom.

The company announced on November 2, 2011 that it would sell its entire television division to Sinclair Broadcast Group for $385 million in a move to eliminate the company&#x27;s debt. The sale was completed on April 2, 2012.

Freedom began selling the majority of its newspaper portfolio in 2012. Four papers in the Midwest were sold to Ohio Community Media, an affiliate of the private equity firm Versa Capital Management, in May. The &quot;Clovis News Journal&quot; and other newspapers in New Mexico were sold to Stevenson Newspapers. Freedom papers in Texas were sold to AIM Media Texas. Its Florida and North Carolina papers were sold to Halifax Media Group.

On June 11, 2012, Freedom Communications Holdings, Inc., announced an agreement to be acquired by 2100 Trust, LLC. in a merger with a subsidiary of 2100 Trust. On July 25, 2012, the latter, led by entrepreneur Aaron Kushner, acquired Freedom&#x27;s dailies, associated non-daily publications and digital properties. The company continued to operate under the name Freedom Communications.

Kushner, who &quot;preached the virtues of local journalism and a print product,&quot; bought Freedom in 2012 for $50 million plus assumption of pension liabilities. He increased staff and added new sections at the &quot;Orange County Register&quot; and began a new daily, the &quot;Long Beach Register.&quot; In January 2014, however, he announced heavy layoffs in Orange County and at the Riverside Press-Enterprise, which he also owned. The &quot;Register&quot; launched a Los Angeles edition, the &quot;Los Angeles Register&quot;, on April 16, 2014, but the venture ended five months later. The &quot;Long Beach Register&quot; became a Sunday-only publication in June 2014, and ceased publication in December 2014.

Freedom closed the sale of &quot;The Gazette (Colorado Springs)&quot; to Clarity Media, a subsidiary of The Anschutz Corporation, on November 30, 2012. In 2013, Freedom Communications sold the &quot;Yuma Sun&quot; and the &quot;Porterville Recorder&quot; to Rhode Island Suburban Newspapers and the &quot;Appeal-Democrat&quot; to Horizon Publications. In 2014, Freedom sold the &quot;Daily Press&quot; and the &quot;Desert Dispatch&quot; to New Media Investment Group.

On November 1, 2015, Freedom Communications filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.

In January, Freedom closed several of its weekly papers in Orange County. On March 21, 2016 a bankruptcy judge approved the sale of Freedom Communications and its two major newspapers, the &quot;Orange County Register&quot; and the &quot;Riverside Press-Enterprise&quot; to Digital First Media (DFM). DFM is the parent of the Los Angeles News Group (LANG), which was renamed the Southern California News Group on the same day, and which owns eleven daily newspapers in Southern California.

<text>Maestro (; from the Italian &quot;&quot; , meaning &quot;&quot; or &quot;teacher,&quot; plural: maestros or maestri) is an honorific title of respect, sometimes abbreviated Mo. The term is most commonly used in the context of Western classical music and opera, in line with the ubiquitous use of Italian musical terms. The feminine form of the word is &quot;&quot; (pl. &quot;maestre&quot;).

The word is often used to describe the greatest tennis player of all time, Roger Federer, the Swiss Maestro. 

==In music==
The word &quot;maestro&quot; is most often used in addressing or referring to conductors. Less frequently, one might refer to respected composers, performers, impresarios, musicologists, and music teachers.

In the world of Italian opera, the title is also used to designate a number of positions within the orchestra and company that have specific duties during rehearsal and performance. These include:
* Maestro sostituto or maestro collaboratore: musicians who act as &quot;répétiteurs&quot; and assistant conductors during performances.
* Maestro concertatore: the keyboard continuo player, who prepares singers and leads rehearsals.
* Maestro direttore: the leader of the first violins of the orchestra (see concertmaster), who may also have administrative duties such as hiring and paying musicians.
* Maestro suggeritore: the prompter.

<text>In Which Annie Gives it Those Ones is a 1989 Indian English-language television film written by Arundhati Roy and directed by Pradip Krishen. It stars Arjun Raina as the title character, with Roshan Seth and Arundhati Roy in key roles. The film also features Shahrukh Khan and Manoj Bajpayee, both then struggling actors in the Delhi theatre circuit, in small but significant roles. Set in the 1970s, in the National Institute of Architecture, New Delhi, the plot revolves around Anand Grover, known as Annie, a misguided visionary who gets into trouble for making fun of the principal, Y.D. Billimoria known as Yamdoot.

The film was the recipient of two National Awards in 1989. It acquired a cult status in the years after it was made. The original print of the movie is lost. Previously, the only copies of the film in circulation were those that were recorded on video cassette recorder when the film was screened on Doordarshan. However, camera recordings of these video cassette tapes were also made, and subsequently posted on YouTube, where they are still available. The film was made for television and was never released theatrically. It was shown on Doordarshan in 1989.

The film was part-autobiographical, with Roy recounting her own experiences of studying at the School of Planning and Architecture, Delhi, a leading architecture institute in India. This was the first screenplay by Roy, the second movie by Krishen after his colonial-period drama &quot;Massey Sahib&quot; (1985). The film is noted for one of the earliest cinematic appearances of Shahrukh Khan.

== Plot ==
In 1974, Anand &quot;Annie&quot; Grover is victimized for making fun of his principal, Y. D. Billimoria (popularly known as Yamdoot or Hell&#x27;s messenger), years ago. At the School of Planning and Architecture, New Delhi, Annie is repeating his fifth year for the fourth time. He spends his hours in the hostel which is the best part of his life, by &quot;giving it those ones&quot; – indulging in daydreams of social uplift. His latest idea is to plant fruit trees on either side of railway tracks, where rural India defecates daily. The faecal matter will provide the necessary compost for the trees, while the trains, with sprinklers attached, will automatically water the plants.

Annie keeps two hens in his room and earns a modest sum by selling their eggs, until one day his friend, Mankind, and his Ugandan roommate, Kasozi, make a roasted meal out of them. Soon, however, hirsute Arjun and his girlfriend Radha – a non-conformist student who steals cigarettes from Yamdoot and talks back to the teachers – present Annie with a rabbit.

Many adventures later, the day to submit the thesis draws near. Annie, urged by his friends, apologises to Yamdoot. A panel of judges call the students one by one for their final interviews and the tension mounts. Radha goes dressed in a saree but wears a man&#x27;s hat to detract from her sober attire. To make sure that Annie gets a sympathetic hearing from the hostile panel, Radha and Arjun work out a plan. Just when Annie is called in, Yamdoot receives a phone call from his dominating deep-voiced mother (who in actuality is Mankind). The trick works and the weary panel gives Annie a good grade.

At the party after the graduation ceremony, Annie arrives with heavy books under his arm, his hair shaved off and a butterfly painted on his head. He informs his friends that he has decided to study law and then sue Yamdoot.

An epilogue then reveals the fates of the characters: Papey returned to Ludhiana as a building contractor after failing to graduate, Lakes runs an interior design firm in South Delhi, Kasozi is the vice chairman of the Kampala Urban Development Authority, Mankind is the architect for a departmental store chain in Copenhagen, Arjun has become the second biggest commercial marigold farmer in India, Radha pivots towards writing but drowns to death in 1976 before she can complete her first novel, and Annie is appointed assistant professor of design at the National Institute of Architecture in 1977, a year after Yamdoot&#x27;s retirement.

<text>In narratology and comparative mythology, the hero&#x27;s quest or hero&#x27;s journey, also known as the monomyth, is the common template of stories that involve a hero who goes on an adventure, is victorious in a decisive crisis, and comes home changed or transformed.

Earlier figures had proposed similar concepts, including psychoanalyst Otto Rank and amateur anthropologist Lord Raglan. Eventually, hero myth pattern studies were popularized by Joseph Campbell, who was influenced by Carl Jung&#x27;s analytical psychology. Campbell used the monomyth to analyze and compare religions. In his book &quot;The Hero with a Thousand Faces&quot; (1949), he describes the narrative pattern as follows:

A hero ventures forth from the world of common day into a region of supernatural wonder: fabulous forces are there encountered and a decisive victory is won: the hero comes back from this mysterious adventure with the power to bestow boons on his fellow man.

Campbell&#x27;s theories regarding the concept of a &quot;monomyth&quot; have been the subject of criticism from scholars, particularly folklorists, who have dismissed the concept as a non-scholarly approach suffering from source-selection bias, among other criticisms. More recently, the hero&#x27;s journey has been analyzed as an example of the sympathetic plot, a universal narrative structure in which a goal-directed protagonist confronts obstacles, overcomes them, and eventually reaps rewards.

==Background==

The study of hero myth narratives can be traced back to 1871 with anthropologist Edward Burnett Tylor&#x27;s observations of common patterns in the plots of heroes&#x27; journeys. In narratology and comparative mythology, others have proposed narrative patterns such as psychoanalyst Otto Rank in 1909 and amateur anthropologist Lord Raglan in 1936. Both Rank and Raglan have lists of cross-cultural traits often found in the accounts of mythical heroes and discuss hero narrative patterns in terms of Freudian psychoanalysis and ritualism. According to Robert Segal, &quot;The theories of Rank, Campbell, and Raglan typify the array of analyses of hero myths.&quot;

==Terminology==
Campbell borrowed the word &quot;monomyth&quot; from James Joyce&#x27;s &quot;Finnegans Wake&quot; (1939). Campbell was a notable scholar of Joyce&#x27;s work and in &quot;A Skeleton Key to Finnegans Wake&quot; (1944) co-authored the seminal analysis of Joyce&#x27;s final novel. Campbell&#x27;s singular &quot;the&quot; monomyth implies that the &quot;hero&#x27;s journey&quot; is the ultimate narrative archetype, but the term &quot;monomyth&quot; has occasionally been used more generally, as a term for a mythological archetype or a supposed mytheme that re-occurs throughout the world&#x27;s cultures. Omry Ronen referred to Vyacheslav Ivanov&#x27;s treatment of Dionysus as an &quot;avatar of Christ&quot; (1904) as &quot;Ivanov&#x27;s monomyth&quot;.

The phrase &quot;the hero&#x27;s journey&quot;, used in reference to Campbell&#x27;s monomyth, first entered into popular discourse through two documentaries. The first, released in 1987, &quot;The Hero&#x27;s Journey: The World of Joseph Campbell&quot;, was accompanied by a 1990 companion book, &quot;The Hero&#x27;s Journey: Joseph Campbell on His Life and Work&quot; (with Phil Cousineau and Stuart Brown, eds.). The second was Bill Moyers&#x27;s series of seminal interviews with Campbell, released in 1988 as the documentary (and companion book) &quot;The Power of Myth&quot;. Cousineau in the introduction to the revised edition of &quot;The Hero&#x27;s Journey&quot; wrote &quot;the monomyth is in effect a &quot;meta myth&quot;, a philosophical reading of the unity of mankind&#x27;s &quot;spiritual&quot; history, the Story behind the story&quot;.

==Summary==
In his book &quot;The Hero with a Thousand Faces&quot; (1949), Campbell describes 17 stages of the monomyth. Not all monomyths necessarily contain all 17 stages explicitly; some myths may focus on only one of the stages, while others may deal with the stages in a somewhat different order. In the terminology of Claude Lévi-Strauss, the stages are the individual mythemes which are &quot;bundled&quot; or assembled into the structure of the monomyth.

The 17 stages may be organized in a number of ways, including division into three &quot;acts&quot; or sections:

In the &quot;departure&quot; part of the narrative, the hero or protagonist lives in the ordinary world and receives a call to go on an adventure. The hero is reluctant to follow the call but is helped by a mentor figure.

The &quot;initiation&quot; section begins with the hero then traversing the threshold to an unknown or &quot;special world&quot;, where he faces tasks or trials, either alone or with the assistance of helpers.
The hero eventually reaches &quot;the innermost cave&quot; or the central crisis of his adventure, where he must undergo &quot;the ordeal&quot; where he overcomes the main obstacle or enemy, undergoing &quot;apotheosis&quot; and gaining his reward (a treasure or &quot;elixir&quot;).

In the &quot;return&quot; section, the hero must return to the ordinary world with his reward. He may be pursued by the guardians of the special world, or he may be reluctant to return and may be rescued or forced to return by intervention from the outside.
The hero again traverses the threshold between the worlds, returning to the ordinary world with the treasure or elixir he gained, which he may now use for the benefit of his fellow man. The hero himself is transformed by the adventure and gains wisdom or spiritual power over both worlds.

==Campbell&#x27;s seventeen stages==
===Departure===

====The Call to Adventure====
The hero begins in a situation of normality from which some information is received that acts as a call to head off into the unknown. According to Campbell, this region is represented bya distant land, a forest, a kingdom underground, beneath the waves, or above the sky, a secret island, lofty mountaintop, or profound dream state; but it is always a place of strangely fluid and polymorphous beings, unimaginable torments, superhuman deeds, and impossible delight. The hero can go forth of his own volition to accomplish the adventure, as did Theseus when he arrived in his father&#x27;s city, Athens, and heard the horrible history of the Minotaur; or he may be carried or sent abroad by some benign or malignant agent as was Odysseus, driven about the Mediterranean by the winds of the angered god, Poseidon. The adventure may begin as a mere blunder... or still, again, one may be only casually strolling when some passing phenomenon catches the wandering eye and lures one away from the frequented paths of man. Examples might be multiplied, &quot;ad infinitum&quot;, from every corner of the world.

====Refusal of the Call====
Often when the call is given, the future hero first refuses to heed it. This may be from a sense of duty or obligation, fear, insecurity, a sense of inadequacy, or any of a range of reasons that work to hold the person in his current circumstances. Campbell says thatRefusal of the summons converts the adventure into its negative. Walled in boredom, hard work, or &quot;culture,&quot; the subject loses the power of significant affirmative action and becomes a victim to be saved. His flowering world becomes a wasteland of dry stones and his life feels meaningless—even though, like King Minos, he may through titanic effort succeed in building an empire of renown. Whatever house he builds, it will be a house of death: a labyrinth of cyclopean walls to hide from him his Minotaur. All he can do is create new problems for himself and await the gradual approach of his disintegration.

==== Supernatural Aid ====

Once the hero has committed to the quest, consciously or unconsciously, their guide and magical helper appears or becomes known. More often than not, this supernatural mentor will present the hero with one or more talismans or artifacts that will aid them later in their quest. Campbell writes:What such a figure represents is benign, protecting power of destiny. The fantasy is a reassurance—promise that the peace of Paradise, which was known first within the mother womb, is not to be lost; that it supports the present and stands in the future as well as in the past (is omega as well as alpha); that though omnipotence may seem to be endangered by the threshold of the world. One has only to know and trust, and the ageless guardians will appear. Having responded to his own call, and continuing to follow courageously as the consequences unfold, the hero finds all the forces of the unconscious at his side. Mother Nature herself supports the mighty task. And in so far as the hero&#x27;s act coincides with that for which his society itself is ready, he seems to ride on the great rhythm of the historical process.

====The Crossing of the First Threshold====
This is the point where the hero actually crosses into the field of adventure, leaving the known limits of their world and venturing into an unknown and dangerous realm where the rules and limits are unknown. Campbell tells us,With the personifications of his destiny to guide and aid him, the hero goes forward in his adventure until he comes to the &quot;threshold guardian&quot; at the entrance to the zone of magnified power. Such custodians bound the world in four directions—also up and down—standing for the limits of the hero&#x27;s present sphere, or life horizon. Beyond them is darkness, the unknown, and danger; just as beyond the parental watch is a danger to the infant and beyond the protection of his society danger to the members of the tribe. The usual person is more than content, he is even proud, to remain within the indicated bounds, and popular belief gives him every reason to fear so much as the first step into the unexplored.

The adventure is always and everywhere a passage beyond the veil of the known into the unknown; the powers that watch at the boundary are dangerous; to deal with them is risky, yet for anyone with competence and courage the danger fades.

====Belly of the Whale====
The belly of the whale represents the final separation from the hero&#x27;s known world and self. By entering this stage, the person shows a willingness to undergo a metamorphosis. When first entering the stage the hero may encounter a minor danger or setback. According to Campbell,The idea that the passage of the magical threshold is a transit into a sphere of rebirth is symbolized in the worldwide womb image of the belly of the whale. The hero, instead of conquering or conciliating the power of the threshold, is swallowed into the unknown and would appear to have died.

This popular motif gives emphasis to the lesson that the passage of the threshold is a form of self-annihilation. ... [I]nstead of passing outward, beyond the confines of the visible world, the hero goes inward, to be born again. The disappearance corresponds to the passing of a worshiper into the temple—where he is to be quickened by the recollection of who and what he is, namely dust and ashes unless immortal. The temple interior, the belly of the whale, and the heavenly land beyond, above, and below the confines of the world, are one and the same. That is why the approaches of and entrances to temples are flanked and defended by colossal gargoyles [equivalent to] the two rows of teeth of the whale. They illustrate the fact that the devotee at the moment of entry into a temple undergoes a metamorphosis. ... Once inside he may be said to have died to time and returned to the World Womb, the World Navel, the Earthly Paradise. ... Allegorically, then, the passage into a temple and the hero-dive through the jaws of the whale are identical adventures, both denoting in picture language, the life-centering, life-renewing act.

In the exemplary Book of Jonah, the eponymous Israelite refuses God&#x27;s command to prophesy the destruction of Nineveh and attempts to flee by sailing to Tarshish. A storm arises, and the sailors cast lots to determine that Jonah is to blame. He allows himself to be thrown overboard to calm the storm, and is saved from drowning by being swallowed by a &quot;great fish&quot;. Over three days, Jonah commits to God&#x27;s will, and he is vomited safely onto the shore. He subsequently goes to Nineveh and preaches to its inhabitants. Jonah&#x27;s passage through the belly of the whale can be viewed as a symbolic death and rebirth in Jungian analysis.

In &quot;The Power of Myth&quot;, Campbell agrees with Bill Moyers that the original &quot;Star Wars&quot; film&#x27;s trash-compactor scene on the Death Star is a strong example of this step of the journey.

===Initiation===
====The Road of Trials====
The road of trials is a series of tests that the hero must undergo to begin the transformation. Often the hero fails one or more of these tests, which often occur in threes. Eventually, the hero will overcome these trials and move on to the next step. Campbell explains thatOnce having traversed the threshold, the hero moves in a dream landscape of curiously fluid, ambiguous forms, where he must survive a succession of trials. This is a favorite phase of the myth-adventure. It has produced a world literature of miraculous tests and ordeals. The hero is covertly aided by the advice, amulets, and secret agents of the supernatural helper whom he met before his entrance into this region. Or it may be that he here discovers for the first time that there is a benign power everywhere supporting him in his superhuman passage.

The original departure into the land of trials represented only the beginning of the long and really perilous path of initiatory conquests and moments of illumination. Dragons have now to be slain and surprising barriers passed—again, again, and again. Meanwhile, there will be a multitude of preliminary victories, unsustainable ecstasies, and momentary glimpses of the wonderful land.

====The Meeting with the Goddess====

This is where the hero gains items given to him that will help him in the future. Campbell proposes thatThe ultimate adventure, when all the barriers and ogres have been overcome, is commonly represented as a mystical marriage of the triumphant hero-soul with the Queen Goddess of the World. This is the crisis at the nadir, the zenith, or at the uttermost edge of the earth, at the central point of the cosmos, in the tabernacle of the temple, or within the darkness of the deepest chamber of the heart.

The meeting with the goddess (who is incarnate in every woman) is the final test of the talent of the hero to win the boon of love (charity: &quot;amor fati&quot;), which is life itself enjoyed as the encasement of eternity.

And when the adventurer, in this context, is not a youth but a maid, she is the one who, by her qualities, her beauty, or her yearning, is fit to become the consort of an immortal. Then the heavenly husband descends to her and conducts her to his bed—whether she will or not. And if she has shunned him, the scales fall from her eyes; if she has sought him, her desire finds its peace.

====Woman as the Temptress====

In this step, the hero faces those temptations, often of a physical or pleasurable nature, that may lead them to abandon or stray from their quest, which does not necessarily have to be represented by a woman. A woman is a metaphor for the physical or material temptations of life since the hero-knight was often tempted by lust from his spiritual journey. Campbell relates thatThe crux of the curious difficulty lies in the fact that our conscious views of what life ought to be seldom correspond to what life really is. Generally, we refuse to admit within ourselves, or within our friends, the fullness of that pushing, self-protective, malodorous, carnivorous, lecherous fever which is the very nature of the organic cell. Rather, we tend to perfume, whitewash, and reinterpret; meanwhile imagining that all the flies in the ointment, all the hairs in the soup, are the faults of some unpleasant someone else.

But when it suddenly dawns on us or is forced to our attention that everything we think or do is necessarily tainted with the odor of the flesh, then, not uncommonly, there is experienced a moment of revulsion: life, the acts of life, the organs of life, a woman in particular as the great symbol of life, become intolerable to the pure, the pure, pure soul. ... The seeker of the life beyond life must press beyond [the woman], surpass the temptations of her call, and soar to the immaculate ether beyond.

====Atonement with the Father/Abyss====
In this step, the hero must confront and be initiated by whatever holds the ultimate power in their life. In many myths and stories, this is the father or a father figure who has life-and-death power. This is the center point of the journey. All the previous steps have been moving into this place, all that follow will move out from it. Although an encounter with a male entity most frequently symbolizes this step, it does not have to be a male—just someone or something with incredible power. Per Campbell, Atonement consists in no more than the abandonment of that self-generated double monster—the dragon thought to be God (superego) and the dragon thought to be Sin (repressed id). But this requires an abandonment of the attachment to ego itself, which is difficult. One must have faith that the father is merciful, and then a reliance on that mercy. In addition to that, the center of belief is transferred outside of the bedeviling god&#x27;s tight scaly ring, and the dreadful ogres dissolve.

It is in this ordeal that the hero may derive hope and assurance from the helpful female figure, by whose magic (pollen charms or power of intercession) they are protected through all the frightening experiences of the father&#x27;s ego-shattering initiation. For if it is impossible to trust the terrifying father-face, then one&#x27;s faith must be centered elsewhere (Spider Woman, Blessed Mother); and with that reliance for support, one endures the crisis—only to find, in the end, that the father and mother reflect each other, and are in essence the same.Campbell later expounds:The problem of the hero going to meet the father is to open his soul beyond terror to such a degree that he will be ripe to understand how the sickening and insane tragedies of this vast and ruthless cosmos are completely validated in the majesty of Being. The hero transcends life with its peculiar blind spot and for a moment rises to a glimpse of the source. They behold the face of the father, understand — and the two are atoned.

====Apotheosis====

This is the point of realization in which a greater understanding is achieved. Armed with this new knowledge and perception, the hero is resolved and ready for the more difficult part of the adventure. Campbell discloses thatThose who know, not only that the Everlasting lies in them, but that what they, and all things, really are &quot;is&quot; the Everlasting, dwell in the groves of the wish-fulfilling trees, drink the brew of immortality, and listen everywhere to the unheard music of eternal concord.

====The Ultimate Boon====
The ultimate boon is the achievement of the goal of the quest. It is what the hero went on the journey to get. All the previous steps serve to prepare and purify the hero for this step since in many myths the boon is something transcendent like the elixir of life itself, or a plant that supplies immortality, or the holy grail. Campbell confers thatThe gods and goddesses then are to be understood as embodiments and custodians of the elixir of Imperishable Being but not themselves the Ultimate in its primary state. What the hero seeks through his intercourse with them is therefore not finally themselves, but their grace, i.e., the power of their sustaining substance. This miraculous energy-substance and this alone is the Imperishable; the names and forms of the deities who everywhere embody, dispense, and represent it come and go. This is the miraculous energy of the thunderbolts of Zeus, Yahweh, and the Supreme Buddha, the fertility of the rain of Viracocha, the virtue announced by the bell rung in the Mass at the consecration, and the light of the ultimate illumination of the saint and sage. Its guardians dare release it only to the duly proven.

=== Return ===

====Refusal of the Return====
Having found bliss and enlightenment in the other world, the hero may not want to return to the ordinary world to bestow the boon onto their fellow beings. Campbell continues:When the hero-quest has been accomplished, through penetration to the source, or through the grace of some male or female, human or animal personification, the adventurer still must return with his life-transmuting trophy. The full round, the norm of the monomyth, requires that the hero shall now begin the labor of bringing the runes of wisdom, the Golden Fleece, or his sleeping princess, back into the kingdom of humanity, where the boon may redound to the renewing of the community, the nation, the planet, or the ten thousand worlds.

But the responsibility has been frequently refused. Even Gautama Buddha, after his triumph, doubted whether the message of realization could be communicated, and saints are reported to have died while in the supernal ecstasy. Numerous indeed are the heroes fabled to have taken up residence forever in the blessed isle of the unaging Goddess of Immortal Being.

====The Magic Flight====
Sometimes the hero must escape with the boon if it is something that the gods have been jealously guarding. It can be just as adventurous and dangerous returning from the journey as it was to go on it. Campbell argues thatIf the hero in his triumph wins the blessing of the goddess or the god and is then explicitly commissioned to return to the world with some elixir for the restoration of society, the final stage of his adventure is supported by all the powers of his supernatural patron. On the other hand, if the trophy has been attained against the opposition of its guardian, or if the hero&#x27;s wish to return to the world has been resented by the gods or demons, then the last stage of the mythological round becomes a lively, often comical, pursuit. This flight may be complicated by marvels of magical obstruction and evasion.

====Rescue from Without====
Just as the hero may need guides and assistants to set out on the quest, often they must have powerful guides and rescuers to bring them back to everyday life, especially if the hero has been wounded or weakened by the experience. Campbell elucidates,The hero may have to be brought back from his supernatural adventure by assistance from without. That is to say, the world may have to come and get him. For the bliss of the deep abode is not lightly abandoned in favor of the [disorder] of the wakened state. ... Society is jealous of those who remain away from it and will come knocking at the door. If the hero ... is unwilling, the disturber suffers an ugly shock; but on the other hand, if the summoned one is only delayed—sealed in by the [deathlike rapture] of a perfect being ... an apparent rescue is effected, and the adventurer returns.

====The Crossing of the Return Threshold====
Campbell says in &quot;The Hero with a Thousand Faces&quot; that &quot;The returning hero, to complete his adventure, must survive the impact of the world.&quot; The goal of the return is to retain the wisdom gained on the quest and to integrate it into society. Campbell writes,Many failures attest to the difficulties of this life-affirmative threshold. The first problem of the returning hero is to accept as real, after an experience of the soul-satisfying vision of fulfillment, the [ups and downs] of life. Why such a world? Why [share] the experience of transcendental bliss? As dreams that were momentous by night may seem simply silly in the light of day, so the poet and the prophet can discover themselves playing the idiot before [others]. The easy thing is to commit the whole community to the devil and retire again into [bliss]. But if some spiritual obstetrician has drawn the &quot;shimenawa&quot; across the retreat, then the work of [distilling eternal truth] cannot be avoided.

====Master of the Two Worlds====

For a human hero, it may mean achieving a balance between the material and spiritual. The person has become comfortable and competent in both the inner and outer worlds. Campbell demonstrates thatFreedom to pass back and forth across the world division, from the perspective of the apparitions of time to that of the causal deep and back—not contaminating the principles of the one with those of the other, yet permitting the mind to know the one by virtue of the other—is the talent of the master. The Cosmic Dancer, declares Nietzsche, does not rest heavily in a single spot, but gaily, lightly, turns and leaps from one position to another. It is possible to speak from only one point at a time, but that does not invalidate the insights of the rest.

Discussing this stage, Campbell cites the Apostles of Jesus, who had become selfless in their devotion by the time of their master&#x27;s transfiguration, as well as the similar orthodoxy presented by Krishna, who said, &quot;He who does My work and regards Me as the Supreme Goal ... without hatred for any creature—he comes to Me.&quot; Campbell goes on to illustrate that

The individual, through prolonged psychological disciplines, gives up completely all attachment to his personal limitations, idiosyncrasies, hopes and fears, no longer resists the self-annihilation that is prerequisite to rebirth in the realization of truth, and so becomes ripe, at last, for the great at-one-ment. His personal ambitions being totally dissolved, he no longer tries to live but willingly relaxes to whatever may come to pass in him; he becomes, that is to say, an anonymity.

====Freedom to Live====
In this step, mastery leads to freedom from the fear of death, which in turn is the freedom to live. This is sometimes referred to as living in the moment, neither anticipating the future nor regretting the past. Campbell declares,The hero is the champion of things becoming, not of things become, because he is. &quot;Before Abraham was, I.&quot; He does not mistake apparent changelessness in time for the permanence of Being, nor is he fearful of the next moment (or of the &quot;other thing&quot;), as destroying the permanent with its change. [Quoting Ovid&#x27;s &quot;Metamorphoses&quot;:] &quot;Nothing retains its own form; but Nature, the greater renewer, ever makes up forms from forms. Be sure that nothing perishes in the whole universe; it does but vary and renew its form.&quot; Thus the next moment is permitted to come to pass.

==In popular culture and literature==
The monomyth concept has been popular in American literary studies and writing guides since at least the 1970s. Christopher Vogler, a Hollywood film producer and writer, created a 7-page company memo, &quot;A Practical Guide to The Hero with a Thousand Faces&quot;, based on Campbell&#x27;s work. Vogler&#x27;s memo was later developed into the book &quot;The Writer&#x27;s Journey: Mythic Structure for Writers&quot;.

George Lucas&#x27;s 1977 film &quot;Star Wars&quot; was classified as monomyth almost as soon as it came out. In addition to the extensive discussion between Campbell and Bill Moyers broadcast in 1988 as &quot;The Power of Myth&quot;, Lucas gave an extensive interview in which he states that after completing &quot;American Graffiti&quot;, &quot;it came to me that there really was no modern use of mythology... so that&#x27;s when I started doing more strenuous research on fairy tales, folklore, and mythology, and I started reading Joe&#x27;s books. ... It was very eerie because in reading &quot;The Hero with a Thousand Faces&quot; I began to realize that my first draft of &quot;Star Wars&quot; was following classical motifs&quot;. Moyers and Lucas also met for a 1999 interview to further discuss the impact of Campbell&#x27;s work on Lucas&#x27;s films. In addition, the National Air and Space Museum of the Smithsonian Institution sponsored an exhibit during the late 1990s called &quot;Star Wars: The Magic of Myth&quot; which discussed the ways in which Campbell&#x27;s work shaped the &quot;Star Wars&quot; saga.

Numerous literary works of popular fiction have been identified by various authors as examples of the monomyth template, including Spenser&#x27;s &quot;The Faerie Queene&quot;, Melville&#x27;s &quot;Moby-Dick&quot;, Charlotte Brontë&#x27;s &quot;Jane Eyre&quot;, works by Charles Dickens, William Faulkner, Somerset Maugham, J. D. Salinger, Ernest Hemingway, Mark Twain, W. B. Yeats, C. S. Lewis, J. R. R. Tolkien, Seamus Heaney and Stephen King, Plato&#x27;s allegory of the cave, Homer&#x27;s &quot;Odyssey&quot;, L. Frank Baum&#x27;s &quot;The Wonderful Wizard of Oz&quot;, and Lewis Carroll&#x27;s &quot;Alice&#x27;s Adventures in Wonderland&quot;, amongst many others.

Stanley Kubrick introduced Arthur C. Clarke to the book &quot;The Hero with a Thousand Faces&quot; by Joseph Campbell during the writing of &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot;. Arthur C. Clarke called Joseph Campbell&#x27;s book &quot;very stimulating&quot; in his diary entry.

In 2024, Canadian rock band Marianas Trench released their 6th studio album &quot;Haven&quot;. Front-man and songwriter Josh Ramsay stated in multiple social media releases that the album is based on Joseph Campbell&#x27;s Monomyth structure, with a song for each of Campbell&#x27;s thirteen steps, in order.

==Feminist literature and female heroines within the monomyth==
=== Jane Eyre ===
Charlotte Brontë&#x27;s character Jane Eyre is an important figure in illustrating heroines and their place within the hero&#x27;s journey. Charlotte Brontë sought to craft a unique female character that the term &quot;Heroine&quot; could fully encompass. &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; is a &quot;Bildungsroman&quot;, a coming-of-age story common in Victorian fiction, also referred to as an apprenticeship novel, that shows moral and psychological development of the protagonist as they grow into adults.

Jane, being a middle-class Victorian woman, would face entirely different obstacles and conflict than her male counterparts of this era such as Pip in &quot;Great Expectations&quot;. This would change the course of the hero&#x27;s journey because Brontë was able to recognize the fundamental conflict that plagued women of this time (one main source of this conflict being women&#x27;s relationship with power and wealth and often being distant from obtaining both).

Charlotte Brontë takes Jane&#x27;s character a step further by making her more passionate and outspoken than other Victorian women of this time. The abuse and psychological trauma Jane receives from the Reeds as a child cause her to develop two central goals for her to complete her heroine journey: a need to love and to be loved, and her need for liberty. Jane accomplishes part of attaining liberty when she castigates Mrs. Reed for treating her poorly as a child, obtaining the freedom of her mind.

As Jane grows throughout the novel, she also becomes unwilling to sacrifice one of her goals for the other. When Rochester, the &quot;temptress&quot; in her journey, asks her to stay with him as his mistress, she refuses, as it would jeopardize the freedom she had struggled to obtain. She instead returns after Rochester&#x27;s wife passes away, now free to marry him and able to achieve both of her goals and complete her role in the hero&#x27;s journey.

While the story ends with a marriage trope, Brontë has Jane return to Rochester after several chances to grow, allowing her to return as close to equals as possible while also having fleshed out her growth within the heroine&#x27;s journey. Since Jane is able to marry Rochester as an equal and through her own means, this makes Jane one of the most satisfying and fulfilling heroines in literature and in the heroine&#x27;s journey.

=== Cupid and Psyche ===
The tale of Cupid and Psyche is one of the thirteen stories of &quot;Metamorphoses&quot; by Apuleius in 158 A.D., and involves a hero&#x27;s journey. The central heroine of the tale is Psyche, who is cast into the hero&#x27;s journey due to being a beautiful woman and the conflict that arises from it. Psyche&#x27;s beauty causes her to become ostracized from society, because no male suitors will ask to marry her, as they feel unworthy of her seemingly divine beauty and kind nature. Psyche&#x27;s call to adventure is involuntary: her beauty causes men to worship her instead the goddess Venus, which enrages the deity and results in Psyche being banished from her home. She enters into a world of the unknown as she is instructed by an oracle to head up a rocky crag in funeral attire, where she is taken to a seemingly divine location by the west wind. Here, the deity Cupid becomes her husband, but he conceals his true identity. When Psyche tries to find out who she is, he flees and she sets out on a quest to regain her husband. Psyche is given four seemingly impossible tasks by Venus to get him back: sorting seeds, fleecing the golden rams, collecting a crystal jar full of the water of death, and retrieving a beauty cream from Hades. Despite the difficulty, Psyche is able to achieve each task and complete her ultimate goal of becoming an immortal goddess and moving to Mount Olympus to be with her husband Cupid for all eternity.

==Self-help movement and therapy==
Poet Robert Bly, Michael J. Meade, and others involved in the mythopoetic men&#x27;s movement have also applied and expanded the concepts of the hero&#x27;s journey and the monomyth as a metaphor for personal spiritual and psychological growth.

Characteristic of the mythopoetic men&#x27;s movement is a tendency to retell fairy tales and engage in their exegesis as a tool for personal insight. Using frequent references to archetypes as drawn from Jungian analytical psychology, the movement focuses on issues of gender role, gender identity and wellness for modern men. Advocates would often engage in storytelling with music, these acts being seen as a modern extension to a form of &quot;new age shamanism&quot; popularized by Michael Harner at approximately the same time. 

Among its most famous advocates was the poet Robert Bly, whose book &quot;Iron John: A Book About Men&quot; was a best-seller, being an exegesis of the fairy tale &quot;Iron John&quot; by the Brothers Grimm.

The mythopoetic men&#x27;s movement spawned a variety of groups and workshops, led by authors such as Bly and Robert L. Moore. Some serious academic work came out of this movement, including the creation of various magazines and non-profit organizations.

Research published in the &quot;Journal of Personality and Social Psychology&quot; in 2023 provided evidence that viewing one&#x27;s life through the Hero&#x27;s Journey narrative can significantly enhance a sense of life meaning and resilience. This effect was consistently observed across various demographics and methodologies.

==Criticism==
Campbell&#x27;s approach to myth, a genre of folklore, has been the subject of criticism from folklorists, academics who specialize in folklore studies. American folklorist Barre Toelken notes that few psychologists have taken the time to become familiar with the complexities of folklore, and that, historically, Jung-influenced psychologists and authors have tended to build complex theories around single versions of a tale that supports a theory or a proposal. To illustrate his point, Toelken employs Clarissa Pinkola Estés&#x27;s (1992) &quot;Women Who Run with the Wolves&quot;, citing its inaccurate representation of the folklore record, and Campbell&#x27;s &quot;monomyth&quot; approach as another. Regarding Campbell, Toelken writes, &quot;Campbell could construct a monomyth of the hero only by citing those stories that fit his preconceived mold, and leaving out equally valid stories... which did not fit the pattern&quot;. Toelken traces the influence of Campbell&#x27;s monomyth theory into other then-contemporary popular works, such as Robert Bly&#x27;s &quot;Iron John: A Book About Men&quot; (1990), which he says suffers from similar source selection bias.

Similarly, American folklorist Alan Dundes is highly critical of both Campbell&#x27;s approach to folklore, designating him as a &quot;non-expert&quot; and outlining various examples of source bias in Campbell&#x27;s theories, as well as media representation of Campbell as an expert on the subject of myth in popular culture. Dundes writes, &quot;Folklorists have had some success in publicising the results of our efforts in the past two centuries such that members of other disciplines have, after a minimum of reading, believed they are qualified to speak authoritatively of folkloristic matters. It seems that the world is full of self-proclaimed experts in folklore, and a few, such as Campbell, have been accepted as such by the general public (and public television, in the case of Campbell)&quot;. According to Dundes, &quot;there is no single idea promulgated by amateurs that have done more harm to serious folklore study than the notion of archetype&quot;.

According to Northup (2006), mainstream scholarship of comparative mythology since Campbell has moved away from &quot;highly general and universal&quot; categories in general. This attitude is illustrated by Consentino (1998), who remarks &quot;It is just as important to stress differences as similarities, to avoid creating a (Joseph) Campbell soup of myths that loses all local flavor.&quot; Similarly, Ellwood (1999) stated &quot;A tendency to think in generic terms of people, races ... is undoubtedly the profoundest flaw in mythological thinking.&quot;

Others have found the categories Campbell works with so vague as to be meaningless and lacking the support required of scholarly argument: Crespi (1990), writing in response to Campbell&#x27;s filmed presentation of his model, characterized it as &quot;unsatisfying from a social science perspective. Campbell&#x27;s ethnocentrism will raise objections, and his analytic level is so abstract and devoid of ethnographic context that myth loses the very meanings supposed to be embedded in the &#x27;hero&#x27;.&quot;

In a similar vein, American philosopher John Shelton Lawrence and American religious scholar Robert Jewett have discussed an &quot;American Monomyth&quot; in many of their books, &quot;The American Monomyth&quot;, &quot;The Myth of the American Superhero&quot; (2002), and &quot;Captain America and the Crusade Against Evil: The Dilemma of Zealous Nationalism&quot; (2003). They present this as an American reaction to the Campbellian monomyth. The &quot;American Monomyth&quot; storyline is: &quot;A community in a harmonious paradise is threatened by evil; normal institutions fail to contend with this threat; a selfless superhero emerges to renounce temptations and carry out the redemptive task; aided by fate, his decisive victory restores the community to its paradisiacal condition; the superhero then recedes into obscurity.&quot; One modern example of this is the character of &#x27;Reacher&#x27; in the books by Lee Child and the TV series based on them, each book starting, and finished with the superhero in the state of obscurity.

The monomyth has also been criticized for focusing on the masculine journey. &quot;The Heroine&#x27;s Journey&quot; (1990) by Maureen Murdock and &quot;From Girl to Goddess: The Heroine&#x27;s Journey Through Myth and Legend&quot; (2010) by Valerie Estelle Frankel both set out what they consider the steps of the female hero&#x27;s journey, which is different from Campbell&#x27;s monomyth. Likewise, &quot;The Virgin&#x27;s Promise&quot;, by Kim Hudson, articulates an equivalent feminine journey, to parallel the masculine hero&#x27;s journey, which concerns personal growth and &quot;creative, spiritual, and sexual awakening&quot; rather than an external quest.

According to a 2014 interview between filmmaker Nicole L. Franklin and artist and comic book illustrator Alice Meichi Li, a hero&#x27;s journey is &quot;the journey of someone who has privilege. Regardless of the protagonist is male or female, a heroine does not start out with privilege.&quot; Being underprivileged, to Li, means that the heroine may not receive the same level of social support enjoyed by the hero in a traditional mythic cycle, and rather than return from her quest as both hero and mentor the heroine instead returns to a world in which she or he is still part of an oppressed demographic. Li adds, &quot;They&#x27;re not really bringing back an elixir. They&#x27;re navigating our patriarchal society with unequal pay and inequalities. In the final chapter, they may end up on equal footing. But when you have oppressed groups, all you can hope for is to get half as far by working twice as hard.&quot;

In a 1999 &quot;Salon&quot; article, science-fiction author David Brin criticized the monomyth template as supportive of &quot;despotism and tyranny,&quot; indicating that he thinks modern popular fiction should strive to depart from it to support more progressive values.

<doc id="908508" wikidata="Q562904" url="?curid=908508" title="Carl Mydans">
<text>Carl Mydans (May 20, 1907 – August 16, 2004) was an American photographer who worked for the Farm Security Administration and &quot;Life&quot; magazine.

==Life==
Mydans grew up playing on the Mystic River near Medford, near Boston, Massachusetts. His father was an oboist.

Mydans became devoted to photography while in college at Boston University. While working on the Boston University News he abandoned childhood dreams of being a surgeon or a boat builder in favor of journalism. His first reporting jobs were for &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; and the &quot;Boston Herald&quot;. After college, he went to New York as a writer for &quot;American Banker&quot; and then in 1935 to Washington to join a group of photographers in the Farm Security Administration. There he worked with other photographers like Dorothea Lange and Ben Shahn to document the conditions of the American rural workers.

In 1935, he traveled throughout New England and America&#x27;s South, documenting the end of a rural-based economy, and gained a measure of renown for his images of bedraggled Arkansas farmers and their families. It was the Great Depression, and the poorest of America&#x27;s poor were devastated by the economic downturn. &quot;One picture, of a Tennessee family living in a hut built on an abandoned truck chassis, portrays the misery of the times,&quot; noted Mydans&#x27; Times of London obituary, &quot;as starkly as any photographs by his more celebrated contemporaries.&quot;

In 1936, he joined &quot;Life&quot; as one of its earliest staff photographers (Alfred Eisenstaedt, Margaret Bourke-White, Thomas McAvoy and Peter Stackpole were the original staff photographers) and a pioneering photojournalist.

==World War II==

Mydans recorded photographic images of life and death throughout Europe and Asia during World War II travelling over . In 1941, the photographer and Shelley Mydans were the first husband and wife team on the magazine&#x27;s staff. Shelley and Carl were captured by the invading Japanese forces in the Philippines and interned for nearly a year at the Santo Tomas Internment Camp in Manila, then for another year in Shanghai, China, before they were released as part of a prisoner-of-war exchange in December 1943.

After their release, Mydans was sent back into Europe for pivotal battles in Italy and France. By 1944, Mydans was back in the Philippines to cover MacArthur&#x27;s return. Mydans snapped the moment when General Douglas MacArthur purposefully strode ashore in the Philippines in 1945, The legendary officer had declared, when the Japanese came in 1942, &quot;I shall return,&quot; and Mydans&#x27; photograph of the formidable general immortalized that claim for posterity. Some asserted that it must have been staged, but Mydans resolutely defended the photograph as entirely spontaneous, though he did admit that MacArthur was savvy about public-relations opportunities. The general had appeared in Mydans&#x27; other memorable image from that assignment, watching with other top U.S. brass as a Japanese delegation signed the official documents of surrender on an early September day in 1945. &quot;No one I have ever known in public life had a better understanding of the drama and power of a picture,&quot; Mydans, said about MacArthur.

Mydans also captured the signing of Japan&#x27;s surrender aboard the &quot;USS. Missouri&quot;.

Some of Mydans&#x27;s other famous pictures include: the bombing of Chongqing, angry French citizens shaving the heads of women accused of sleeping with Germans during the occupation in 1944; a roomful of excited royal youngsters and their staid older relatives in 1954; and a 1950 portrait of Douglas MacArthur smoking a pipe.

But he also photographed the war from the viewpoint of the ordinary soldier or sailor. &quot;Resourceful and unruffled, Mr. Mydans sent back pictures of combat that even now define how some remember World War II, Korea, and other conflicts,&quot; noted &quot;The New York Times&quot;.

==Post-war==
Despite his two years in captivity, Mydans bore no ill will toward the Asian nation, and accepted an assignment to head Time-Life&#x27;s Tokyo bureau with his wife. Time-Life was the publisher of &quot;Time&quot;, &quot;Life&quot; and other top magazines, which Mydans continued to provide with an array of visual stories. In 1948, he just happened to be in the city of Fukui when a destructive earthquake struck; some of his shots were taken on the street while buildings were collapsing around him.

After covering the Korean War, Mydans traveled the globe for the next two decades for &quot;Life&quot; before the publication folded in 1972. When it was relaunched several years later, he was still listed as one of its contributing photographers. He died on August 16, 2004, of heart failure at his home in Larchmont, New York, at the age of 97. Widowed in 2002, Mydans was survived by his daughter, Misty, a California attorney; and his son, Seth, Asia correspondent for &quot;The New York Times&quot;.

BoBo has received numerous Gold and Platinum certifications for his releases and has found success in Europe (primarily Germany and Switzerland), Canada, Asia, and South America.

== Biography ==
===1985–1991: Early beginnings===
Peter René Baumann was born in Kölliken, Switzerland in 1968 to Italian father Luigi Cipriano and Swiss mother Ruth Baumann. Initially, Baumann wanted to work in the area of confectionery and bakery. This, however, did not last long as his desire for dancing clicked with the development of breakdancing after his high school graduation. Having been involved in numerous dance-contests, Baumann managed to reach the Top 10 of the German dance-contest &quot;Disco Kings&quot; with his acrobatic dance style.

Baumann began his DJ career in 1985, a year after which he was a runner-up in the Swiss DJ Championships. He continued to work as a DJ at numerous night-clubs such as Don Paco and the Hazyland, both in Switzerland. He gained enough experience and later decided to produce his own record. His first single &quot;I Love You&quot; came out in late 1989 during which time he would still work as a DJ but focused on future releases of his own production. In 1991, DJ BoBo released two other singles, &quot;Ladies in the House&quot; and &quot;Let&#x27;s Groove On&quot;. The latter was a little more successful and even made it onto the first album. 

===1992–1996: Career breakthrough===
Baumann gained immense international popularity when he released his Europe-wide smash hit &quot;Somebody Dance with Me&quot; in November 1992. Employing catchy refrains by Emel Aykanat as well as rap performance by himself, the single shot to number 1 in Switzerland and Sweden, while it landed in the Top 5 in numerous other European countries including Germany. &quot;Somebody Dance with Me&quot; was certified Gold in Germany for selling well over 250,000 units. His second hit, &quot;Keep on Dancing&quot;, which followed the same technique as its predecessor, reached the Top 5 both in Switzerland and in Germany, and landed in the Top 10 in other parts of Europe. The single reached Gold status in Germany for sales of 250,000 units. The long-awaited album &quot;Dance with Me&quot; was released in October 1993 and remained in the charts all over Europe for quite some time, which was followed by another single, &quot;Take Control&quot;, again from his debut album. It earned him yet another Gold award in Germany for sales of over 250,000 units, as the song also entered the Top 20 in numerous countries. While DJ BoBo appeared to have already separated himself from one-hit wonders, he released his next single, &quot;Everybody&quot;, in the summer of 1994, which climbed as high as No. 2 in Germany and was certified Platinum for selling 500,000 units there. &quot;Everybody&quot; differed from the previously released singles in terms of its structure; it diverged from house, leaning towards a mixture of house and hip hop (&quot;hip house&quot;), with female vocalists performing the chorus and rap verses performed by BoBo.

In the fall of 1994, his second studio album &quot;There Is a Party&quot; was released. While the album peaked at No. 4 in Switzerland where it was certified Platinum for selling over 50,000 units, it entered the Top 10 in Germany, where it spent total of 26 weeks on the chart, eventually reaching Gold status for selling over 250,000 units. The single &quot;Let the Dream Come True&quot; from the album topped the charts in Switzerland and entered the Top 5 in Germany, where it was certified Gold for sales over 250,000 units. While the follow-up second single, &quot;Love Is All Around&quot;, entered the Top 20 in Switzerland, Austria, Belgium, Sweden, and Norway, it was certified Gold in Germany being the sixth golden record in a row. During the course of this ongoing success, in 1995, DJ BoBo represented Switzerland in the World Music Awards in Monaco, being the &quot;World&#x27;s Best Selling Swiss Artist of the Year&quot;.

In the summer of 1995, DJ BoBo went on a tour which took place in most parts of Asia, which was followed by a promotional tour in Australia. Later that year, DJ BoBo travelled all over Europe performing in front of as many as 400,000 spectators.
BoBo released his first ballad, &quot;Love Is the Price&quot;, in January 1996, which was introduced in Thomas Gottschalk&#x27;s TV show &quot;Wetten, dass..?&quot;. Later that year, DJ BoBo again ended up at the World Music Awards in Monaco for being the &quot;World&#x27;s Best Selling Swiss Artist of the Year&quot;, performing two songs back to back; &quot;Freedom&quot; (which was his eighth Gold record in a row in Germany) as well as his newly released ballad &quot;Love Is the Price&quot;.

===1996–1999: Established popularity===
The release of the album &quot;World in Motion&quot; in September 1996 proved not only DJ BoBo&#x27;s consistent presence in the charts, but with this album, he managed to break all his previous records. It took only a few weeks for the album to reach the No. 3 position in Germany and be awarded Platinum for selling 500,000 units. In Switzerland, the album jumped from 0 to No. 1 and was awarded Double-Platinum for selling 100,000 units. It was ranked in the Top 40 albums of all-time, after remaining on the Swiss album chart for a staggering 67 weeks. Shortly after the release of &quot;World in Motion&quot;, DJ BoBo went on a promotional tour in Asia for 20 days, which was followed up by a one month-tour in Brazil, Chile, and Colombia.

In April 1997, DJ BoBo received his third World Music Award in Monaco for being the &quot;World&#x27;s Best Selling Swiss Artist of the Year&quot; where he performed his single &quot;Respect Yourself&quot;.

DJ BoBo maintained his original sound and experimented with new sounds and vocal arrangements when he introduced his singing skills first on his single &quot;Where Is Your Love&quot;, which was released in March 1998. A month later, in April 1998, his album &quot;Magic&quot; was released which managed to stay in the No. 1 position for four consecutive weeks in his native country and earned him a Platinum award for sales of over 50,000 units. In Germany, the album peaked at No. 5 and spent total of 21 weeks on the chart, eventually earning the Swiss artist another Gold award for sales of over 250,000 units.

In May of that the same year, BoBo received the World Music Award for being the &quot;World&#x27;s Best Selling Swiss Artist of the Year&quot; for the fourth time. Soon after, his single &quot;Celebrate&quot; was released introducing his &quot;The Ultimate Megamix &#x27;99&quot;. During this time DJ BoBo and his crew were busy preparing for his &quot;Life on Tour&quot; concert as well as the shows of the &quot;Magic&quot;, which were watched by 250,000 people in 35 concert arenas in Europe. Shortly thereafter, DJ BoBo was rewarded with yet another World Music Award for being the &quot;World&#x27;s Best Selling Swiss Artist of the Year&quot; for the fifth time in a row.

===1999–2001===
DJ BoBo&#x27;s sixth album, &quot;Level 6&quot;, was released in October 1999 and immediately hit the No. 1 position in the Swiss album charts. It eventually went Platinum at his home as well as Gold in Germany for sales of over 150,000 units. Two singles were released off this album, &quot;Together&quot; and &quot;Lies&quot;. DJ BoBo&#x27;s success continued, as once again in the spring of 2000, he received yet another trophy at the World Music Award for the sixth time in a row for being Switzerland&#x27;s &quot;Best Selling Artist of the Year&quot;.

With the help of his co-producer Axel Breitung, BoBo managed to complete his next album, &quot;Planet Colors,&quot; released on 5 February 2001. The first single, &quot;What a Feeling&quot;, features American singer Irene Cara and is a cover version of Cara&#x27;s original hit &quot;Flashdance... What a Feeling&quot;. It peaked at No. 2 in Switzerland, No. 11 in Austria, and No. 3 in Germany. Two other singles were followed: &quot;Hard to Say I&#x27;m Sorry&quot; and &quot;Colors of Life&quot;. BoBo&#x27;s tour &quot;Planet Colors – The Show&quot; was a big hit and was followed by more than one million spectators within Europe.

===2001–2005: 10-year anniversary===

As a way of celebrating his 10-year anniversary in the music business, DJ BoBo made the cover version of Kool and the Gang&#x27;s &quot;Celebration&quot;, reviving it with modern instrumentation. The single was to represent his collection album consisting of previous hits, which he also entitled &quot;Celebration&quot;. The album &quot;Celebration&quot;, released in April 2002, comprised the previous hits all of which were re-recorded featuring mostly German renowned artists such as No Angels on &quot;Where is Your Love&quot;, Melanie Thornton on &quot;Love of My Life&quot;, Emilia on &quot;Everybody&quot;, and A Touch of Class on &quot;Together&quot;. Besides DJ BoBo being Switzerland&#x27;s Best Selling Recording Artist at the World Music Awards in 2002 for the seventh time, in 2002, BoBo and co-producer Axel Breitung were recognised as the &quot;Best Producers of 2001&quot;during the Echo awards for being the most-talented musical team.

DJ BoBo&#x27;s next studio album called &quot;Visions&quot;, released in February 2003, brought a new side to his music, which aside from the usual dance-sounds, portrayed him with more acoustic elements. Examples of this are the songs &quot;Angel&quot; and &quot;Do You Remember&quot;, wherein guitars replaced the usual synthesizers. The Album &quot;Visions&quot; peaked at No. 3 in Switzerland and eventually became a Platinum record in the country. In 2003, BoBo received yet another World Music Award for being Switzerland&#x27;s Best Selling Artist of the year.

One of BoBo&#x27;s most successful singles turned out to be &quot;Chihuahua&quot;, which was initially released in 2002 and later re-released Europe-wide. The track was produced upon the request of Coca-Cola in Spain, as they were in search of an artist who could produce an attention-drawing song for their new campaign. The track was completed within a period of ten days. It took only a couple of weeks for &quot;Chihuahua&quot; to reach No. 1 on the Spanish single chart. The song eventually reached No. 1 in both Switzerland and France. It was certified Platinum in Switzerland for sales of over 40,000 units, and in France reached a Diamond status for sales of over one million units.

===2005–2008: Eurovision Song Contest and 10th World Music Award===

BoBo&#x27;s next studio album, &quot;Pirates of Dance&quot;, was released in February 2005, and included two singles called &quot;Pirates of Dance&quot; and &quot;Amazing Life&quot;. The album shot straight to No. 1 in Switzerland. BoBo and his crew began the Pirates of Dance Tour in April 2005. They took off in Switzerland, followed by Germany and Poland, which concluded with two concerts in Disneyland and Paris. 2005 was the year that made DJ BoBo Switzerland&#x27;s Best Selling Recording Artist of the Year for the 10th time.

BoBo released his greatest hits album in 2006, which contained reworked versions of some of his previous songs, and some remaining in their original package. The single &quot;Secrets of Love&quot;, which was released before the album, was a pop-dance duet with 1980s star Sandra. The song&#x27;s music video was filmed at Disney Resort Paris. His greatest hits compilation eventually earned BoBo a Gold certification in Switzerland.

On 11 October 2006, DJ BoBo announced in a press conference that he had applied to represent Switzerland at the Eurovision Song Contest 2007.

In past years, Switzerland&#x27;s entry had not always been a Swiss national. Most notably, Canadian Celine Dion won the Eurovision Song Contest 1988 representing Switzerland. In DJ BoBo&#x27;s press conference, he told reporters that &quot;It&#x27;s a shame for Swiss tax payer money from the TV licence fees go to fund a foreign act, and the people should resist that.&quot;

In December 2006, the Swiss TV council announced that they had chosen BoBo out of over 200 applicants to represent Switzerland in Helsinki, Finland. Following the selection, the council was criticised for not being fair towards lesser known Swiss artists. On 21 February 2007, DJ BoBo revealed both the song and the video for the contest: &quot;Vampires Are Alive&quot;. Despite being one of the favorites to win the contest according to bookmakers, the song failed to get past the semi-final stage on 12 May. It finished twentieth out of 28 semi-finalists.
DJ BoBo released his next album, &quot;Vampires,&quot; on 11 May 2007, which climbed as high as No. 2 on the Swiss album chart. The first single, &quot;Vampires Are Alive&quot;, reached No. 3 in Switzerland and charted moderately in the rest of the German-speaking countries, but gained success in Finland, where it reached No. 7. Two other singles were released, &quot;We Gotta Hold On&quot; and &quot;Because of You&quot; off the album &quot;Vampires&quot;.

In 2007, BoBo was chosen to sing the official 2008 UEFA European Football Championship song. On his website, BoBo presented a poll to choose which song out of two would be the official song. Eventually, &quot;Olé Olé&quot; was chosen over &quot;Let the Games Begin&quot;. On 11 April 2008, &quot;Olé Olé&quot; was released as a single, being accompanied by an album called &quot;Olé Olé – Party&quot;. The album included five new songs, nine party hits, a medley, a newly remixed version of BoBo&#x27;s hit &quot;Everybody&quot;, and a new version of &quot;Vampires Are Alive&quot; titled &quot;EAPM Remix&quot;.

===2008–present===
DJ BoBo&#x27;s album &quot;Fantasy&quot; was released on 26 February 2010. It peaked at No. 2 in Switzerland and was certified Gold for selling over 15,000 units. The two singles released off the album were &quot;Superstar&quot; and &quot;This Is My Time&quot;.

A new release from BoBo, entitled &quot;Dancing Las Vegas&quot;, was released on 25 November 2011. The album contains 13 tracks and comes with a DVD which is composed of six parts, including the video clip of the previously released single &quot;Everybody&#x27;s Gonna Dance&quot;.

BoBo released another studio album called &quot;Circus&quot; on 10 January 2014, followed by &quot;Mystorial&quot; in 2016 and &quot;KaleidoLuna&quot; in 2018. As with BoBo&#x27;s previous studio albums, &quot;Circus&quot; and &quot;Mystorial&quot; charted in the Top 5 in Switzerland, while &quot;KaleidoLuna&quot; charted at No. 9.

==Charitable work==
DJ BoBo became a United Nations World Food Programme National Ambassador Against Hunger in October 2006, becoming the first Swiss celebrity to take up the role. He was also a participant in the 2006 Geneva Walk the World event.

<doc id="908518" wikidata="Q871913" url="?curid=908518" title="Interchangeable parts">
<text>Interchangeable parts are parts () that are identical for practical purposes. They are made to specifications that ensure that they are so nearly identical that they will fit into any assembly of the same type. One such part can freely replace another, without any custom fitting, such as filing. This interchangeability allows easy assembly of new devices, and easier repair of existing devices, while minimizing both the time and skill required of the person doing the assembly or repair.

The concept of interchangeability was crucial to the introduction of the assembly line at the beginning of the 20th century, and has become an important element of some modern manufacturing but is missing from other important industries.

Interchangeability of parts was achieved by combining a number of innovations and improvements in machining operations and the invention of several machine tools, such as the slide rest lathe, screw-cutting lathe, turret lathe, milling machine and metal planer. Additional innovations included jigs for guiding the machine tools, fixtures for holding the workpiece in the proper position, and blocks and gauges to check the accuracy of the finished parts. Electrification allowed individual machine tools to be powered by electric motors, eliminating line shaft drives from steam engines or water power and allowing higher speeds, making modern large-scale manufacturing possible. Modern machine tools often have numerical control (NC) which evolved into CNC (computerized numeric control) when microprocessors became available.

Methods for industrial production of interchangeable parts in the United States were first developed in the nineteenth century. The term &quot;American system of manufacturing&quot; was sometimes applied to them at the time, in distinction from earlier methods. Within a few decades such methods were in use in various countries, so &quot;American system&quot; is now a term of historical reference rather than current industrial nomenclature.

== First use ==
Evidence of the use of interchangeable parts can be traced back over two thousand years to Carthage in the First Punic War. Carthaginian ships had standardized, interchangeable parts that even came with assembly instructions akin to &quot;tab A into slot B&quot; marked on them.

==Origins of the modern concept==
In the late-18th century, French General Jean-Baptiste Vaquette de Gribeauval promoted standardized weapons in what became known as the after it was issued as a royal order in 1765. (At the time the system focused on artillery more than on muskets or handguns.) One of the accomplishments of the system was that solid-cast cannons were bored to precise tolerances, which allowed the walls to be thinner than cannons poured with hollow cores. However, because cores were often off-center, the wall thickness determined the size of the bore. Standardized boring made for shorter cannons without sacrificing accuracy and range because of the tighter fit of the shells; it also allowed standardization of the shells.

Before the 18th century, devices such as guns were made one at a time by gunsmiths in a unique manner. If one single component of a firearm needed a replacement, the entire firearm either had to be sent to an expert gunsmith for custom repairs, or discarded and replaced by another firearm. During the 18th and early-19th centuries, the idea of replacing these methods with a system of interchangeable manufacture gradually developed. The development took decades and involved many people.

Gribeauval provided patronage to Honoré Blanc, who attempted to implement the at the musket level. By around 1778, Honoré Blanc began producing some of the first firearms with interchangeable flintlock mechanisms, although they were carefully made by craftsmen. Blanc demonstrated in front of a committee of scientists that his muskets could be fitted with flintlock mechanisms picked at random from a pile of parts.

In 1785 muskets with interchangeable locks caught the attention of the United States&#x27; Ambassador to France, Thomas Jefferson, through the efforts of Honoré Blanc. Jefferson tried unsuccessfully to persuade Blanc to move to America, then wrote to the American Secretary of War with the idea, and when he returned to the USA he worked to fund its development. President George Washington approved of the concept, and in 1798 Eli Whitney signed a contract to mass-produce 12,000 muskets built under the new system.

Between 4th July 1793 and 25th November 1795, the London gunsmith Henry Nock delivered 12,010 &#x27;screwless&#x27; or &#x27;Duke&#x27;s&#x27; locks to the British Board of Ordnance. These locks were intended to be interchangeable, being manufactured in large volumes in a steam-powered factory using gauges and lathes. Subsequent experiments have suggested that the lock&#x27;s components were interchangeable at a higher rate than those of the later British New Land Pattern musket and the American M1816 musket.

Louis de Tousard, who fled the French Revolution, joined the U.S. Corp of Artillerists in 1795 and wrote an influential artillerist&#x27;s manual that stressed the importance of standardization.

== Implementation ==
Numerous inventors began to try to implement the principle Blanc had described. The development of the machine tools and manufacturing practices required would be a great expense to the U.S. Ordnance Department, and for some years while trying to achieve interchangeability, the firearms produced cost more to manufacture. By 1853, there was evidence that interchangeable parts, then perfected by the Federal Armories, led to savings. The Ordnance Department freely shared the techniques used with outside suppliers.

=== Eli Whitney and an early attempt ===
In the US, Eli Whitney saw the potential benefit of developing &quot;interchangeable parts&quot; for the firearms of the United States military. In July 1801 he built ten guns, all containing the same exact parts and mechanisms, then disassembled them before the United States Congress. He placed the parts in a mixed pile and, with help, reassembled all of the firearms in front of Congress, much as Blanc had done some years before.

The Congress was captivated and ordered a standard for all United States equipment. The use of interchangeable parts removed the problems of earlier eras concerning the difficulty or impossibility of producing new parts for old equipment. If one firearm part failed, another could be ordered, and the firearm would not need to be discarded. The catch was that Whitney&#x27;s guns were costly and handmade by skilled workmen.

Charles Fitch credited Whitney with successfully executing a firearms contract with interchangeable parts using the American System, but historians Merritt Roe Smith and Robert B. Gordon have since determined that Whitney never actually achieved interchangeable parts manufacturing. His family&#x27;s arms company, however, did so after his death.

=== Brunel&#x27;s sailing blocks ===
Mass production using interchangeable parts was first achieved in 1803 by Marc Isambard Brunel in cooperation with Henry Maudslay and Simon Goodrich, under the management of (and with contributions by) Brigadier-General Sir Samuel Bentham, the Inspector General of Naval Works at Portsmouth Block Mills, Portsmouth Dockyard, Hampshire, England. At the time, the Napoleonic War was at its height, and the Royal Navy was in a state of expansion that required 100,000 pulley blocks to be manufactured a year. Bentham had already achieved remarkable efficiency at the docks by introducing power-driven machinery and reorganising the dockyard system.

Marc Brunel, a pioneering engineer, and Maudslay, a founding father of machine tool technology who had developed the first industrially practical screw-cutting lathe in 1800 which standardized screw thread sizes for the first time, collaborated on plans to manufacture block-making machinery; the proposal was submitted to the Admiralty who agreed to commission his services. By 1805, the dockyard had been fully updated with the revolutionary, purpose-built machinery at a time when products were still built individually with different components. A total of 45 machines were required to perform 22 processes on the blocks, which could be made in three different sizes. The machines were almost entirely made of metal, thus improving their accuracy and durability. The machines would make markings and indentations on the blocks to ensure alignment throughout the process. One of the many advantages of this new method was the increase in labour productivity due to the less labour-intensive requirements of managing the machinery. Richard Beamish, assistant to Brunel&#x27;s son and engineer, Isambard Kingdom Brunel, wrote:

So that ten men, by the aid of this machinery, can accomplish with uniformity, celerity and ease, what formerly required the uncertain labour of one hundred and ten.

By 1808, annual production had reached 130,000 blocks and some of the equipment was still in operation as late as the mid-twentieth century.

=== Terry&#x27;s clocks: success in wood ===

Eli Terry was using interchangeable parts using a milling machine as early as 1800. Ward Francillon, a horologist, concluded in a study that Terry had already accomplished interchangeable parts as early as 1800. The study examined several of Terry&#x27;s clocks produced between 1800–1807. The parts were labelled and interchanged as needed. The study concluded that all clock pieces were interchangeable.
The very first mass production using interchangeable parts in America was Eli Terry&#x27;s 1806 Porter Contract, which called for the production of 4000 clocks in three years. During this contract, Terry crafted four-thousand wooden gear tall case movements, at a time when the annual average was about a dozen. Unlike Eli Whitney, Terry manufactured his products without government funding. Terry saw the potential of clocks becoming a household object. With the use of a milling machine, Terry was able to mass-produce clock wheels and plates a few dozen at the same time. Jigs and templates were used to make uniform pinions, so that all parts could be assembled using an assembly line.

=== North and Hall: success in metal ===
The crucial step toward interchangeability in metal parts was taken by Simeon North, working only a few miles from Eli Terry. North created one of the world&#x27;s first true milling machines to do metal shaping that had been done by hand with a file. Diana Muir believes that North&#x27;s milling machine was online around 1816. Muir, Merritt Roe Smith, and Robert B. Gordon all agree that before 1832 both Simeon North and John Hall were able to mass-produce complex machines with moving parts (guns) using a system that entailed the use of rough-forged parts, with a milling machine that milled the parts to near-correct size, and that were then &quot;filed to gage by hand with the aid of filing jigs.&quot;

Historians differ over the question of whether Hall or North made the crucial improvement. Merrit Roe Smith believes that it was done by Hall. Muir demonstrates the close personal ties and professional alliances between Simeon North and neighbouring mechanics mass-producing wooden clocks to argue that the process for manufacturing guns with interchangeable parts was most probably devised by North in emulation of the successful methods used in mass-producing clocks. It may not be possible to resolve the question with absolute certainty unless documents now unknown should surface in the future.

=== Late 19th and early 20th centuries: dissemination throughout manufacturing ===
Skilled engineers and machinists, many with armoury experience, spread interchangeable manufacturing techniques to other American industries, including clockmakers and sewing machine manufacturers Wilcox and Gibbs and Wheeler and Wilson, who used interchangeable parts before 1860. Late to adopt the interchangeable system were
Singer Corporation sewing machine (1860s-70s), reaper manufacturer McCormick Harvesting Machine Company (1870s–1880s) and several large steam engine manufacturers such as Corliss (mid-1880s) as well as locomotive makers. Typewriters followed some years later. Then large scale production of bicycles in the 1880s began to use the interchangeable system.

During these decades, true interchangeability grew from a scarce and difficult achievement into an everyday capability throughout the manufacturing industries. In the 1950s and 1960s, historians of technology broadened the world&#x27;s understanding of the history of the development. Few people outside that academic discipline knew much about the topic until as recently as the 1980s and 1990s, when the academic knowledge began finding wider audiences. As recently as the 1960s, when Alfred P. Sloan published his famous memoir and management treatise, &quot;My Years with General Motors&quot;, even the long-time president and chair of the largest manufacturing enterprise that had ever existed knew very little about the history of the development, other than to say that:

[Henry M. Leland was], I believe, one of those mainly responsible for bringing the technique of interchangeable parts into automobile manufacturing. […] It has been called to my attention that Eli Whitney, long before, had started the development of interchangeable parts in connection with the manufacture of guns, a fact which suggests a line of descent from Whitney to Leland to the automobile industry.

One of the better-known books on the subject, which was first published in 1984 and has enjoyed a readership beyond academia, has been David A. Hounshell&#x27;s &quot;From the American System to Mass Production, 1800–1932: The Development of Manufacturing Technology in the United States&quot;.

<doc id="908533" wikidata="Q3082666" url="?curid=908533" title="Frank Iacobucci">
<text>Frank Iacobucci (born June 29, 1937) is a former Puisne Justice of the Supreme Court of Canada from 1991 until his retirement from the bench in 2004. He was the first Italian-Canadian, judge on the court. Iacobucci was also the first judge on the Supreme Court to have been born, raised and educated in British Columbia. Iacobucci has had a distinguished career in private practice, academia, the civil service and the judiciary.

Before his elevation to the nation&#x27;s top court, he was a tenured professor of law at the University of Toronto Faculty of Law for eighteen years, and was appointed dean of the faculty in 1979. From 1985 to 1988, he served as the Deputy Attorney General of Canada, playing a key role in constitutional law negotiations during the Meech Lake Accord process. Prime Minister Brian Mulroney appointed him Chief Justice of the Federal Court of Canada in 1988.

As a former private corporate lawyer, he is considered an expert in business and tax law. He currently serves as senior counsel at the business law firm Torys LLP.

==Early life and education==

Iacobucci was born in Vancouver, British Columbia to working-class Italian immigrants, Gabriel Iacobucci and Rosina Pirillo. His father emigrated from Abruzzo in 1922 and his mother emigrated from Calabria in 1925. He was the third of four children and attended Britannia Secondary School. In high school he worked in a steel foundry alongside his father and was inspired by the story of Angelo Branca to pursue law. As his parents did not have the opportunity to receive a formal education, they stressed the importance of their children receiving higher education.

Iacobucci received a Bachelor of Commerce (BComm.) degree in 1961 and a Bachelor of Laws (LL.B) degree in 1962, both from the University of British Columbia. While attending the University of British Columbia, he became a brother of Phi Gamma Delta (FIJI).

He received a Master of Laws (LL.M) degree in 1964 and a diploma in international law (Dip Int&#x27;L) in 1966, both from the University of Cambridge.

He was called by The Law Society of Upper Canada to the Ontario bar in 1970.

==Career==

Iacobucci practiced corporate law and related fields at Dewey, Ballantine, Bushby, Palmer &amp; Wood in New York City from 1964 until 1967.

Taking a chance to pursue a career in academia, he was an associate professor and then a professor of law at the University of Toronto Faculty of Law between 1967 and 1985. He subsequently served as associated dean of the faculty from 1973 to 1975, and was a visiting fellow at Wolfson College in 1978. He served as dean of the faculty from 1979 to 1983. He also acted as vice-president and provost of the university from November 1983 to September 1985. It is within this time period (1982 to 1985), Iacobucci was also a commissioner of the Ontario Securities Commission and was counsel to the Estey Commission in 1974.

Iacobucci was also a part of several noteworthy organizations. He was director for the National Congress of Italian Canadians from 1979 to 1983, and became vice-president in 1980, serving for three years. He was also vice-president and member on the board of governors for the Canadian Institute of Advanced Legal Studies from 1981 to 1998. From 1976 to 1988, he was the director of the Multicultural History Society of Ontario. Additionally, Iacobucci was also the director of Cambridge Canada Trust for seven years beginning in 1984.

He entered the public service in 1985 as Deputy Minister of Justice and Deputy Attorney General of Canada in the federal government. He was a principal member of the federal team in negotiations over the Meech Lake Accord in 1987. Just three years after entering the civil service, in September 1988, he was appointed Chief Justice of the Federal Court.

Iacobucci was a member of the Canadian Judicial Council and Education Committee from 1988 to 1991 and was on the executive committee in his last year. In 1989, he became governor of the Canadian Judicial Centre/National Judicial Institute until 2004. He is a former elder at Islington United Church.

On January 7, 1991, Justice Iacobucci was appointed as justice of the Supreme Court of Canada by Conservative prime minister Brian Mulroney and served in this capacity until retiring on July 1, 2004.

While serving as a Supreme Court judge, he was also a member of the advisory council for the International Centre for Criminal Law Reform and Criminal Justice Policy before becoming director in 1993. In 1996, Iacobucci sat on the advisory committee as a member for McGill University Faculty of Law until 2004. He was a member of the advisory board for the Institute of Canadian Studies at the University of Ottawa from 1998 to 2004.

==Engagements after retiring from court==

Following his retirement from the Supreme Court, Iacobucci was appointed interim president of the University of Toronto in 2004, and served in that post until he was replaced by David Naylor in October 2005.

He was a conduct review advisor with the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board from 2005 to 2018 and a member of the Ontario Law Commission from 2006 to 2012.

Iacobucci was appointed by the Government of Canada in June 2005 as its representative to lead discussions toward a fair and lasting resolution of the legacy of Indian residential schools. He also chairs the selection committee for commissioners of the Indian Residential Schools Truth and Reconciliation Commission.

In September of that same year he joined Torys LLP, as counsel, and since 2005 has been the chair of the Higher Education Quality Council of Ontario.

He is the chair of the Dean&#x27;s Advisory Committee for the National Centre for Business Law at the University of British Columbia Faculty of Law.

He sat on a number of board of directors including Torstar, publisher of the &quot;Toronto Star&quot; and a series of smaller newspapers and owner of Harlequin Enterprises, a global publisher of popular romance novels. Iacobucci is the former chairman of Torstar.

Iacobucci served as the commissioner of an internal inquiry into the role of Canadian officials in the torture and detention of three Arab-Canadians in Syria and Egypt as the personal appointee of Conservative prime minister Stephen Harper. The report concludes that deficient information-sharing by CSIS and the RCMP likely contributed indirectly to the detention of Mr. Nureddin and Mr. Elaati, and that similar sharing of information likely contributed to the mistreatment amounting to torture of all three.

On August 11, 2011, Ontario announced Iacobucci&#x27;s appointment to &quot;review the process for including individuals living in First Nations reserve communities on the (Ontario&#x27;s) jury rolls,&quot; following concerns from First Nation organizations and jurists about Aboriginal people being under-represented on juries in Ontario. The report, released in February, 2013, determined under-representation of individuals living on reserves on Ontario&#x27;s jury roll to be a symptom of a crisis. He expressed hope his report would serve as a wake-up call to remedy broader and systemic issues that are at the heart of the current dysfunctional relationship between Ontario&#x27;s justice system and Aboriginal peoples in the province. In addition to 17 specific recommendations, Iacobucci emphasized the need for establishing a government-to-government relationship that &quot;incorporates an underlying respect for cultural, traditional, and historical values that are different.&quot; He stated &quot;this
government-to-government relationship . . . must underlie the relationship between Ontario and First Nations going forward in dealing with justice and jury representation issues.&quot;

From 2006 to 2012, he was involved with the Higher Education Quality Council of Ontario. He joined the advisory board of General Motors of Canada in 2006, where he continues to serve to this day. At the same time, he was the lead director at Tim Hortons until 2014.

From 2006 to 2007, he was a Trudeau Foundation mentor.

On August 28, 2013, in response to the July 27, 2013 shooting death of Sammy Yatim by Toronto Police officer James Forcillo, Iacobucci was requested by Chief of Police Bill Blair to conduct an independent review of &quot;the policies, practices, and procedures of, and the services provided by, the TPS with respect to the use of lethal force or potentially lethal force, in particular in encounters with persons who are or may be emotionally disturbed, mentally disturbed or cognitively impaired.&quot;. On July 24, 2014, the &quot;Police Encounters with People in Crisis – An Independent Review Conducted by The Honourable Frank Iacobucci for Chief of Police William Blair, Toronto Police Service&quot; report was delivered and was released to the public by Chief Blair. The 400+ page report made 84 recommendations pertaining to &quot;the mental health system and Toronto Police&quot; and focusing on police culture, training, supervision, and selection of new officers, the mental health of police personnel, use of force, crisis intervention, and equipment, along with suggestions surrounding implementation of the reports recommendations. The report, originally arranged by Blair under his authority as chief, without Toronto Police Services Board approval, was contracted through the Toronto law firm of Torys LLP for the $500,000.00 maximum funding amount the chief was authorized to approve without board approval; in May 2014, after the majority of the work had been performed, the chief requested, and the board ultimately approved, the revised cost for the report of $985,000.00.

From 2014 to 2017, he was a member of the board of directors for the Canadians for a New Partnership.

In November 2015, the Government of Alberta retained Iacobucci to conduct an independent review of—and advice in connection with—the decision of former Alberta Ethics Commissioner Neil Wilkinson to clear former Alberta premier Alison Redford of conflict of interest charges under Alberta&#x27;s Conflicts of Interest Act resulting from Redford having awarded the contract for a multibillion-dollar contract to conduct litigation against tobacco companies on behalf of the Government to a Calgary law firm for which her former husband was a partner while she was Minister of Justice. The report affirmed the concern that had been raised by the opposition that Mr. Wilkinson had not had necessary information available to him in reaching the decision, particularly his being refused access to an Alberta Justice briefing note that listed the law firm as the last of three that should be considered.

On October 3, 2018, Iacobucci was appointed by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to the position of special envoy for the controversial Trans Mountain Pipeline expansion. In February / March 2019 media reports noted that Iacobucci had been retained by SNC-Lavalin, concurrent with the company&#x27;s controversial efforts to secure a Deferred Prosecution Agreement in order to avoid a trial for allegedly bribing Saadi Gaddafi to win engineering and construction contracts in Libya, prior to the fall of the Gaddafi regime in 2011.

Currently, he is a member of the board of directors with COSTI Immigration Services and has been since 2009.

<doc id="908538" wikidata="Q3492030" url="?curid=908538" title="Deputy minister (Canada)">
<text>In Canada, a deputy minister (DM; ) is the senior civil servant in a government organization, who acts as deputy head. Deputy ministers take political direction from a minister of the Crown, who is typically an elected member of Parliament and responsible for the department. 

The Canadian position is equivalent to the position of permanent secretary in the United Kingdom and the Australian position of departmental secretary. This position should not be confused with the deputy prime minister of Canada, who is not a civil servant at all, but a politician and senior member of the Cabinet. 

Much of the current management structure of the Government of Canada – including the role of deputy heads – originates from the Royal Commission on Government Organization, also known as the Glassco Commission.

The title is not only used for the federal (national) government, but also for equivalent positions in the provincial and territorial governments.

== Role ==
A deputy minister has responsibility for a department&#x27;s day-to-day operations, budget, and program development. As members of the public service, deputy ministers are nonpartisan. The deputy minister is the functional head of the department in question, while the minister is the department&#x27;s political master. Unlike most other public service positions, deputy ministers are Governor-in-Council appointments made on the advice of the prime minister of Canada. Accordingly, deputy ministers can sometimes lose their positions as a result of a change of the party in power, particularly if they are seen as too closely identified with the policies of the previous government.

=== Statutory role ===
Under the &quot;Interpretation Act&quot; and departmental legislation, deputy heads are typically permitted to exercise powers of their ministers for all purposes aside from creation of regulations. Deputy heads also possess powers under their own right under the &quot;Financial Administration Act&quot;, &quot;Public Service Employment Act&quot;, powers delegated by the Treasury Board of Canada, and Public Service Commission of Canada. Typically, these relate to management of resources delegated to their organizations, personnel management, including appointment, employer-employee relations, and the organization of the department. Ministers may not provide specific direction on the areas a deputy minister is directly assigned.

=== Senior public servants ===
The executive government (Crown-in-Council) includes many organizations not designated as departments including special operating agencies – such as Statistics Canada, Parks Canada – the military, departments which function more as an &quot;administrative umbrella&quot;, such as Public Safety Canada, which comprises six agencies, as well as Crown corporations. As such, various organizations&#x27; senior leadership (commissioner, chief executive, etc.) while not explicitly deputy ministers, exercise similar functions.

== Clerk of the Privy Council ==
The most senior deputy minister in the Canadian federal government is the clerk of the Privy Council, who is deputy minister to the Prime Minister and head of the Public Service of Canada. In the provinces and territories, the position fulfils a similar function as the most senior public servant and is called the cabinet secretary or clerk of the executive council. This person, along with their staff, typically develops agendas for regular Cabinet meetings, reconciles differences between departments, guides major policy initiatives, and coordinates the appointments of departmental heads. The position reports directly to the relevant prime minister and is typically among the most seasoned, influential, and low profile of public servants.

The Australian equivalent is the secretary of the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet, and the British equivalent is the Cabinet Secretary. The equivalent in the provincial governments of Canada is the named &quot;Deputy Minister of Executive Council and Secretary to Cabinet&quot; (Alberta), &quot;Deputy Minister to the Premier and Cabinet Secretary&quot; (Saskatchewan) or similar.

== Other senior leadership ==
Associate deputy ministers are deputy ministers in waiting, often assigned to a specific project or initiative pending appointment to lead a department. Assistant deputy ministers are operational positions, usually carrying responsibility for particular functions or budgets within a department.

<doc id="908540" wikidata="Q907880" url="?curid=908540" title="Euler (programming language)">
<text>Euler is a programming language created by Niklaus Wirth and Helmut Weber, conceived as an extension and generalization of ALGOL 60. The designers&#x27; goals were to create a language that is:
* Simpler, yet more flexible, than ALGOL 60
* Useful and processed with reasonable efficiency
* Definable with rigorous formality

Available sources indicate that Euler was operational by 1965.

==Overview==
Euler employs a general data type concept. In Euler, arrays, procedures, and switches are not quantities which are declared and named by identifiers: in contrast to ALGOL, they are not quantities on the same level as variables. Rather, these quantities are on the level of numeric and boolean constants. Thus, besides the traditional numeric and logical constants, Euler introduces several added types:
* Reference
* Label
* Symbol
* List (array)
* Procedure
* Undefined
All constants can be assigned to variables, which have the same form as in ALGOL, but for which no fixed types are specified: Euler uses dynamic typing. Further, a procedure can produce a value of &quot;any&quot; type when executed, and this type can vary &quot;from one call of the procedure to the next&quot;.

Similarly, the elements of a list can have values of any type and these can differ from element to element within a list. So, when the list elements are labels, a switch is obtained. If the elements are procedures, a procedure list is obtained, which is unavailable in ALGOL 60. If the elements are lists themselves, then a general tree structure is obtained.

Euler provides general type-test and type-conversion operators.

<text>Mar Vista is a neighborhood on the Westside of Los Angeles, California. In 1927, Mar Vista became the 70th community to be annexed to Los Angeles. It was designated as an official city neighborhood in 2006.

==History==
Mar Vista was called Ocean Park Heights from 1904 to 1924. Ocean Park Heights developed along a rail line - the Venice Short Line from downtown Los Angeles to Venice Beach - built in 1902 (present day Venice Boulevard). In 1927, Mar Vista became the 70th community to be annexed to Los Angeles. The neighborhood experienced massive growth in the 1950s through the 1970s. The area north of Venice Boulevard was filled in with suburban single-family development, including many surviving examples of mid-century modern residential architecture along Beethoven, Meier, and Moore street. These developments were originally built as basic, low-cost homes in a relatively far-flung region of the city. But as the surrounding areas of Western Los Angeles have developed into major business and tourism centers, property values rapidly increased to the point where, as of 2020, older homes marketed as tear-downs regularly sell for over $1 million. In 2006, the city designated Mar Vista as an official neighborhood and installed signage.
The section of the neighborhood south of Venice Boulevard is zoned for apartment buildings, and as such it is significantly more densely populated. This section is home to a large concentration of dingbat apartment buildings which are mostly subject to Los Angeles&#x27; Rent Stabilization Ordinance, allowing many long-term renters to stay in the area despite increasingly expensive rents and property values.

===Historic neighborhoods===

*Mar Vista Oval District - Circa 1912, Palm Place development laid out north of Washington Boulevard and south of the Venice Short Line, now Venice Boulevard. Related: Just south of the planned Palm Place, land purchased in 1913 for a development to be called Kensington Green. At the time of purchase the land contained an orchard of walnut trees and “one of the oldest eucalyptus groves in Los Angeles,” with of frontage on Washington Boulevard, and the Redondo Beach via Playa Del Rey Line running along the south boundary.
*Mormon Hill

==Geography==
===City of Los Angeles===
Per City Council action on February 21, 2006, Mar Vista was designated as the area bounded by: the Santa Monica City border between I-10 and Walgrove Avenue; Walgrove Avenue between the Santa Monica City border and the Culver City border on the west, the Culver City border between Walgrove Avenue and I-405 on the south, I-405 between the Culver City border and I-10 on the east, and I-10 between the Santa Monica City border and 1-405 on the north.

At that time, the Department of Transportation was instructed to install signs at the following locations in order to identify &quot;Mar Vista&quot;: Venice Boulevard at Beethoven Street, Venice Boulevard at Sawtelle Boulevard, Centinela Avenue at Mitchell Avenue, Rose Avenue at Walgrove Avenue, Barrington Avenue at National Boulevard, Centinela Avenue at Airport Avenue.

The Venice Neighborhood Council has noted an exception to the above boundaries. The area between Walgrove Avenue and Beethoven Street contains schools serving the Venice Community including Venice High, Mark Twain Junior High, Walgrove Elementary and Beethoven Elementary. The grounds of these schools are within the Venice Neighborhood Council and overlap areas with the Mar Vista Community Council.

The City of Los Angeles official zoning map ZIMAS also shows Venice High School as included in Venice, and not Mar Vista.

===Mapping L.A.===

According to the Mapping L.A. project of the &quot;Los Angeles Times,&quot; Mar Vista&#x27;s boundaries are: the San Diego Freeway to the Culver City boundary at Venice Boulevard on the northeast, the Culver City line on the southeast, Walgrove Avenue on the southwest and the Santa Monica city boundary on the northwest. The northern apex of the Mar Vista neighborhood is at the San Diego Freeway and National Boulevard and the southern is at Washington Boulevard and Tivoli Avenue. The Zip Codes for Mar Vista California are 90066 and 90034.

Mar Vista is adjoined on the northeast by Palms, on the east, southeast and south by Culver City, on the west by Venice and on the northwest by Santa Monica.

===Climate===
==Demographics==
===2000===
The 2000 U.S. census counted 35,492 residents in the 2.9-square-mile Mar Vista neighborhood—an average of 12,259 people per square mile, about the norm for Los Angeles; in 2008, the city estimated that the population had increased to 37,447. The median age for residents was 35, considered the average for Los Angeles; the percentage of residents aged 19 through 34 was among the county&#x27;s highest.

Mar Vista was highly diverse ethnically, but the percentage of Asian people was high for the county. The breakdown was whites, 51.3%; Latinos, 29.1%; Asians, 12.8%, blacks, 3.5%; and others, 3.4%. Mexico (36%) and Korea (6%) were the most common places of birth for the 33.5% of the residents who were born abroad—considered an average figure for Los Angeles.

Forty-two percent of Mar Vista residents aged 25 and older had earned a four-year degree by 2000, a high figure for both the city and the county. The percentages of residents of that age with a bachelor&#x27;s degree or a master&#x27;s degree were also considered high for the county.

The percentages of never-married men (40.8%), divorced men (8.4%) and divorced women (12.5%) were among the county&#x27;s highest. The percentages of veterans who served during World War II or the Korean War were among the county&#x27;s highest.

===2008===
The median yearly household income in 2008 dollars was $62,611, an average figure for Los Angeles. The average household size of 2.3 people was low for both the city and the county. Renters occupied 60.6% of the housing stock and house- or apartment owners held 39.4%.

<doc id="908548" wikidata="Q813908" url="?curid=908548" title="Conditional entropy">
<text>In information theory, the conditional entropy quantifies the amount of information needed to describe the outcome of a random variable formula_1 given that the value of another random variable formula_2 is known. Here, information is measured in shannons, nats, or hartleys. The &quot;entropy of formula_1 conditioned on formula_2&quot; is written as formula_5.

== Definition ==
The conditional entropy of formula_1 given formula_2 is defined as

where formula_8 and formula_9 denote the support sets of formula_2 and formula_1.

&quot;Note:&quot; Here, the convention is that the expression formula_12 should be treated as being equal to zero. This is because formula_13. 

Intuitively, notice that by definition of expected value and of conditional probability, formula_14 can be written as formula_15, where formula_16 is defined as formula_17. One can think of formula_18 as associating each pair formula_19 with a quantity measuring the information content of formula_20 given formula_21. This quantity is directly related to the amount of information needed to describe the event formula_20 given formula_23. Hence by computing the expected value of formula_24 over all pairs of values formula_25, the conditional entropy formula_26 measures how much information, on average, the variable formula_27 encodes about formula_28.

== Motivation ==
Let formula_29 be the entropy of the discrete random variable formula_1 conditioned on the discrete random variable formula_2 taking a certain value formula_32. Denote the support sets of formula_2 and formula_1 by formula_8 and formula_9. Let formula_1 have probability mass function formula_38. The unconditional entropy of formula_1 is calculated as formula_40, i.e.

:formula_41

where formula_42 is the information content of the outcome of formula_1 taking the value formula_44. The entropy of formula_1 conditioned on formula_2 taking the value formula_32 is defined by: 

:formula_48
Note that formula_5 is the result of averaging formula_29 over all possible values formula_32 that formula_2 may take. Also, if the above sum is taken over a sample formula_53, the expected value formula_54 is known in some domains as .

Given discrete random variables formula_2 with image formula_8 and formula_1 with image formula_9, the conditional entropy of formula_1 given formula_2 is defined as the weighted sum of formula_29 for each possible value of formula_32, using formula_63 as the weights:
:formula_64

==Properties==
===Conditional entropy equals zero===
formula_65 if and only if the value of formula_1 is completely determined by the value of formula_2.

===Conditional entropy of independent random variables===
Conversely, formula_68 if and only if formula_1 and formula_2 are independent random variables.

===Chain rule===
Assume that the combined system determined by two random variables formula_2 and formula_1 has joint entropy formula_73, that is, we need formula_73 bits of information on average to describe its exact state. Now if we first learn the value of formula_2, we have gained formula_76 bits of information. Once formula_2 is known, we only need formula_78 bits to describe the state of the whole system. This quantity is exactly formula_5, which gives the &quot;chain rule&quot; of conditional entropy:

:formula_80

The chain rule follows from the above definition of conditional entropy:

:formula_81

In general, a chain rule for multiple random variables holds:

:formula_82

It has a similar form to chain rule in probability theory, except that addition instead of multiplication is used.

===Bayes&#x27; rule===
Bayes&#x27; rule for conditional entropy states
:formula_83

&quot;Proof.&quot; formula_84 and formula_85. Symmetry entails formula_86. Subtracting the two equations implies Bayes&#x27; rule.

If formula_1 is conditionally independent of formula_88 given formula_2 we have:

:formula_90

===Other properties===
For any formula_2 and formula_1:
:formula_93

where formula_94 is the mutual information between formula_2 and formula_1.

For independent formula_2 and formula_1:

:formula_99 and formula_100

Although the specific-conditional entropy formula_101 can be either less or greater than formula_76 for a given random variate formula_103 of formula_1, formula_105 can never exceed formula_76.

== Conditional differential entropy ==
=== Definition ===
The above definition is for discrete random variables. The continuous version of discrete conditional entropy is called &quot;conditional differential (or continuous) entropy&quot;. Let formula_2 and formula_1 be a continuous random variables with a joint probability density function formula_109. The differential conditional entropy formula_110 is defined as

=== Properties ===
In contrast to the conditional entropy for discrete random variables, the conditional differential entropy may be negative.

As in the discrete case there is a chain rule for differential entropy:
:formula_111
Notice however that this rule may not be true if the involved differential entropies do not exist or are infinite.

Joint differential entropy is also used in the definition of the mutual information between continuous random variables:
:formula_112

formula_113 with equality if and only if formula_2 and formula_1 are independent.

===Relation to estimator error===
The conditional differential entropy yields a lower bound on the expected squared error of an estimator. For any Gaussian random variable formula_2, observation formula_1 and estimator formula_118 the following holds:
:formula_119

This is related to the uncertainty principle from quantum mechanics.

==Generalization to quantum theory==
In quantum information theory, the conditional entropy is generalized to the conditional quantum entropy. The latter can take negative values, unlike its classical counterpart.

<text>Dearborn Station (also called, Polk Street Depot) was, beginning in the late 1800s, one of six intercity train stations serving downtown Chicago, Illinois. It remained in operation until May 1, 1971. Built in 1883, it is located at Dearborn and Polk Streets, to the south of the Loop, adjacent to Printers Row. The station was owned by the Chicago &amp; Western Indiana Railroad, which itself was owned by the companies operating over its line. The station building headhouse now houses office, retail, and entertainment spaces, and its trackage yard, behind the headhouse, was redeveloped into part of the Dearborn Park neighborhood.

==Description and history==
The Romanesque Revival structure, designed by Cyrus L. W. Eidlitz, opened in 1885 at a cost of $400 to $500 thousand (equivalent to $ to $ million in 2025). The three-story building&#x27;s exterior walls and twelve-story clock tower were composed of pink granite and red pressed brick topped by a number of steeply-pitched roofs. Modifications to the structure following a fire in 1922 included eliminating the original pitched roof profile. Behind the head house were the train platforms, shielded by a large train shed. Inside the station were ticket counters, waiting rooms, and Fred Harvey Company restaurants.

Amtrak (the National Railroad Passenger Corporation) chose to consolidate its Chicago operations at the Union Station. The final intercity passenger train to depart Dearborn Station was the Grand Trunk Western Railroad&#x27;s &quot;International Limited&quot;, which departed on April 30, 1971. The arrival of the Atchison, Topeka &amp; Santa Fe Railway&#x27;s &quot;San Francisco Chief&quot; and &quot;Grand Canyon&quot; from California on May 2 brought intercity operations at Dearborn to a close. The Norfolk &amp; Western Railway&#x27;s Orland Park commuter service, the &quot;Orland Park Cannonball&quot;, continued to use a platform at Dearborn until 1976.

By 1976, Dearborn Station&#x27;s train shed was demolished and tracks were removed; the head house building was retained. The train station stood abandoned into the mid-1980s when it was converted to retail and office space. The former rail yards were converted for use as Dearborn Park.

==Services==

Some of the railroads that served the station include the following, with some of the more well-known name trains listed:

* Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway (Santa Fe) – the &quot;Chief&quot;, &quot;Super Chief&quot;, &quot;El Capitan&quot;, and &quot;Grand Canyon Limited&quot; (to name but a few) to Los Angeles, California; the &quot;Texas Chief&quot; to Galveston/Houston, Texas; the &quot;Antelope&quot; to Oklahoma City, Oklahoma; the &quot;Kansas Cityan&quot; (and its eastbound counterpart, the &quot;Chicagoan&quot;) to Kansas City, Missouri; and the &quot;San Francisco Chief&quot; to San Francisco, California. Although the Santa Fe by far operated the greatest number of trains from the station, it was only a tenant.
* Chesapeake and Ohio Railway (moved to the Grand Central Station February 28, 1925).
* Chicago and Eastern Illinois Railroad – &quot;Cardinal&quot;, &quot;Zipper&quot; and &quot;Silent Knight&quot; to St. Louis, Missouri; &quot;Dixie Flyer&quot;, and &quot;Dixie Flagler&quot; and &quot;Georgian&quot; to Evansville, continuing to Nashville, Tennessee, then Atlanta, Georgia, and finally Miami, Florida (The &quot;Georgian&quot; ending at Atlanta). From July 31, 1904 to August 1, 1913, Chicago &amp; Eastern Illinois trains used LaSalle Street Station.
* Chicago, Indianapolis and Louisville Railway (Monon) – &quot;Hoosier&quot; and &quot;Tippecanoe&quot; to Indianapolis, Indiana, &quot;Thoroughbred&quot; to Louisville, Kentucky.
* Erie Railroad (Erie Lackawanna Railway from 1960) – &quot;Atlantic Express and Pacific Express&quot;, &quot;Erie Limited&quot;, &quot;Phoebe Snow&quot; and &quot;Lake Cities&quot; to Hoboken, or Jersey City, New Jersey.
* Grand Trunk Western Railroad – &quot;Maple Leaf&quot;, &quot;Inter-City Limited&quot; and &quot;International Limited&quot; to Toronto, Ontario and Montreal, Quebec. &quot;Mohawk&quot; to Detroit, Michigan.
* Wabash Railroad (Norfolk and Western Railway from 1964) – &quot;Blue Bird&quot; and &quot;Banner Blue&quot; to St. Louis, Missouri.

The following commuter rail services also operated from the station:
* Chicago and Eastern Illinois Railroad (until 1935) – operated from Dearborn Station to Crete, Illinois. Metra has proposed to revive the route as its SouthEast Service.
* Chicago and Western Indiana Railroad (until 1964) – operated between Dearborn Station and Dolton, Illinois serving mostly local stops within Chicago&#x27;s far south side.
* Chicago and Erie Railroad – operated from Dearborn Station to Rochester, Indiana.
* Grand Trunk Western Railroad (until 1935) – operated from Dearborn Station to Valparaiso, Indiana (later service was cut-back to Harvey, Illinois).
* Wabash Railroad (Norfolk and Western Railway from 1964) – used a track west of the station until 1976, when moved to the Union Station); now Metra&#x27;s SouthWest Service.
* Santa Fe Railway (until 1903) – operated from Dearborn Station to Joliet, Illinois.

==In popular culture==
In blues musician Henry Thomas&#x27; 1927 song &quot;Railroadin&#x27; Some&quot;, the &quot;Polk Street Depot&quot; is the next to last stop on a journey that begins in Fort Worth, Texas, and ends in Chicago.

Dearborn Station is mentioned multiple times in the 1974 &quot;Adam&#x27;s Ribs&quot; episode of &quot;M*A*S*H&quot;, in which Hawkeye Pierce craves the barbecued ribs from a fictional restaurant adjacent to the station, but can&#x27;t recall the name. He calls the station master from South Korea to get the restaurant&#x27;s name and phone number. Hawkeye refers to the terminal as the &quot;Dearborn Street Station&quot;.

&quot;Dearborn Station&quot; is a song by the rock band Fortune that was released in 1985.

<text>When I Was Cool: My Life at the Jack Kerouac School is Sam Kashner&#x27;s autobiographical account of his experience as the first student at the Jack Kerouac School of Disembodied Poetics, which was founded by Allen Ginsberg and Anne Waldman in honor of their late friend, Jack Kerouac. As he describes in his book, Kashner was a disgruntled Long Island teenager in the 1970s who was obsessed with the poetry and prose of the Beat generation of the 1950s.

Kashner&#x27;s book provides a glimpse into the lives and creative processes of his teachers at the Jack Kerouac School, including Anne Waldman, Allen Ginsberg, William S. Burroughs and Gregory Corso. Among the various and curious details of life with the Beats, Kashner describes several of Ginsberg&#x27;s unfinished poems that he asks Kashner to complete. He also recalls the lively conversations at his teachers&#x27; dinner parties, which touched on their methodologies as well as American Literature in general. Kashner also chronicles the lingering effects of heroin and other drugs on Burroughs and Corso, as well as William S. Burroughs, Jr.&#x27;s alcoholism.

Kashner&#x27;s book was published by HarperCollins in 2004 and was reviewed favorably by &quot;The New York Times&quot; the same year.

<doc id="908565" wikidata="Q1034857" url="?curid=908565" title="Cappella (band)">
<text>Cappella is an Italian Eurodance music group formed in 1987 by producer Gianfranco Bortolotti. The act went through a number of line-up changes over the years but was most successful in the early 1990s. Their biggest hit was &quot;U Got 2 Let the Music&quot;, which reached No. 2 on the UK Singles Chart in 1993.

==History==

===1987-1991: Beginnings and minor success===
The name Cappella was first used in 1987. In the beginning, they were a Hi-NRG influenced house act with producer Gianfranco Bortolotti of Media Records leading the group, with significant contributions from fellow producers Stefano Lanzini, Diego Leoni and Pieradis Rossini. In 1988, the act debuted on the UK Singles Chart with the song &quot;Bauhaus (Push the Beat)&quot;, and the following year with &quot;Helyom Halib&quot; which peaked at number 11. At the time, the act was fronted by model Ettore Foresti, who served as the face of the group, but did not perform any of the vocals.

Three years later, Cappella scored another UK top 30 hit with &quot;Take Me Away&quot;, which sampled Loleatta Holloway&#x27;s &quot;Love Sensation&quot; – the same track that had been sampled on the number 1 hit &quot;Ride On Time&quot; by fellow Italian house act Black Box in 1989.

===1992-1995: U Got 2 Know and worldwide success===
It was not until 1992 when Cappella really began to gain momentum. &quot;U Got 2 Know&quot; was based on the distinctive riff of Siouxsie and the Banshees&#x27; &quot;Happy House&quot;. Vocalist Anna Ross and rapper MC Fixx It (Ricardo Overman) were chosen by Gianfranco for live performances. The song reached number 6 in the UK. Afterwards, two permanent members were drafted in to front the act: rapper Rodney Bishop from London and ex-SL2 dancer Kelly Overett from Ipswich. &quot;U Got 2 Let the Music&quot; (which sampled Alphaville&#x27;s &quot;Sounds Like a Melody&quot;) was released in October 1993 and climbed to number 2 on the UK Singles Chart, held off from the top spot only by Meat Loaf&#x27;s &quot;I&#x27;d Do Anything For Love (But I Won&#x27;t Do That)&quot;. &quot;U Got 2 Know&quot; would later be remade and updated by Tomcraft in 2013.

Further hits followed: &quot;Move On Baby&quot; reached number 7 in February 1994, &quot;U &amp; Me&quot; peaked at number 10 in June, and &quot;Move It Up&quot; ended the &quot;U Got 2 Know&quot; album project with a number 16 hit in October. At the end of the year, Overett left the group. It later emerged that she had not actually performed on any of the records. Though she occasionally performed and sang live, like &quot;Move On Baby&quot; live on &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; and during a telecast of M6&#x27;s Dance Machine concert in 1994 in which she did perform &quot;U &amp; Me&quot; live despite a playback in the background.

As for the real voices that were actually used, &quot;U Got 2 Know&quot; included Xaviera Gold&#x27;s vocals from &quot;You Used To Hold Me&quot;, &quot;U Got 2 Let the Music&quot; sampled a vocal from JM Silk&#x27;s track &quot;Let The Music Take Control&quot;, and the vocals for &quot;U &amp; Me&quot; were sampled from a song by Vicki Shepard. &quot;Move On Baby&quot; and &quot;Don&#x27;t Be Proud&quot; were sung by a session singer Eileina Dennis. The hit &quot;Move It Up&quot; was also sung by a session singer now known to be Jackie Rawe. Rap vocals were later confirmed to be performed by former member MC Fixx It. Overett later established a singing career by releasing a single called &quot;Follow Your Heart&quot; in 1995 under the name &quot;Kelly O&quot;, although it was her only solo single.

===1995-1997: Line up changes and War In Heaven===
In May 1995, Cappella returned with new vocalist Allison Jordan. Before joining Cappella, she had scored a number 23 hit in the UK Official Top 40 with &quot;The Boy From New York City&quot;. Rodney Bishop was also replaced by Patrick Osborne, but returned to the group before long. Before Bishop returned to Cappella, he released two solo singles under the name &#x27;Bishop&#x27; titled &quot;Addicted&quot; and &quot;Lift Me Up&quot;.

The comeback single &quot;Tell Me the Way&quot; reached number 17 in the UK in September 1995 and was followed by the album &quot;War In Heaven&quot;, which featured contributions from Mauro Picotto. According to rumors, War in Heaven was almost completely recorded before Overett and Bishop were no longer part of the group. The rap performance on this album mostly consists of samples, but also once again features rap performances by MC Fixx It. The majority of the vocals on this album are from Jordan, however vocals on a few tracks were shared with Katherine Ellis, and some tracks on the album featured Ellis as the sole vocalist.

===1997-1998, 2004: Final album, disbandment, and brief resurgence===
On 25 February 1998, Cappella released their fourth eponymously titled album. The album was supported by three singles, titled &quot;Be My Baby&quot;, &quot;U Tore My World Apart&quot;, and &quot;Throwin&#x27; Away&quot;. It is now known that the lead vocals on the album were performed by British vocalist Lorna Bannon. The rap vocals were performed by Italian producer and remixer Tiziano Pagani. After the singles charted less than expected, the band decided to go on tour and promote the new album in Japan later in the same year. Once their Japanese tour was finished, Bishop left the group, and Cappella continued as a solo act with just Jordan for a brief time. Cappella released the single &quot;U R the Power of Love&quot; in September 1998, and shortly afterwards, Cappella disbanded and resorted to releasing remixes of previous hits.

In 2004, the act – now once again faceless, released a brand new trance track called &quot;Angel&quot; which failed to chart. The song features an unknown vocalist with rap samples from MC Fixx It directly from Anticappella&#x27;s &quot;Move Your Body&quot;. A greatest hits CD/DVD was released in August 2005.

===2013-2021: Comeback===
In 2013, the band returned with the original producer Gianfranco Bortolotti and new members, a married couple: Lis Birks as a vocalist and Marcus Birks as a rapper. The couple used to perform under the name of The Cameleonz. The Birks performed the past hits from Cappella at 90&#x27;s revival shows across Europe for 7 years. Despite plans for a new single with the new lineup and some teaser photos taken of them in the studio, nothing materialised.

===Marcus&#x27; death===
Marcus Birks died on 27 August 2021 from COVID-19, aged 40. He is survived by Lis and their child. He had been a Covid denialist and spoke with the BBC in August 2021:
&quot;If you haven&#x27;t been ill, you don&#x27;t think you&#x27;re going to get ill, so you listen to the [anti-vaccine] stuff. When you feel like you can&#x27;t get enough breath, it&#x27;s the scariest feeling in the world.

&quot;First thing I am going tell all my family to do is get the vaccine and anybody I see, and as soon as I can get it, I am definitely getting it.&quot;

===2022-present: Second comeback and new music===
In January 2022, the band revealed on their Instagram page that Lis Birks will step down as a performer and instead manage the band alongside Gianfranco Bortolotti. Simultanesouly, the group introduced the new lineup of singer Vikki Waters and rapper Steve Lewis. The band embarked on a European tour from March through October. In June, Steve Lewis left the group and was replaced with Jay McCurdy. In May 2023, Cappella annonunced they are working on their first single in nearly 20 years, titled &quot;Happy Phonk&quot;. The song was released on 13 October 2023. In November 2023, Jay McCurdy left the group and was replaced with Andrew &quot;Aggz&quot; Gidney. Simultaneously, the DJ Aroxx (Andy Critchlow) was announced as an addition to support the line-up on stage.

==Former Members==
===Kelly Overett===
In November 2022, former member Kelly Overett resurfaced online and shared many stories, memories and pictures from her time in the band. In an interview from the following month, she shared more details, including clearing up rumors on what led to the end of her time in the band and her brief solo career as Kelly O. 27 years after the release of &quot;Follow Your Heart&quot;, Kelly revealed there is a music video and a follow-up single called &quot;Into The Light&quot; previously left unreleased, and uploaded both of them on YouTube. When asked if she would ever return to performing with Cappella, she stated:

&quot;I think I am open to appearing at the 90&#x27;s festivals, which I had no idea of til recently. No. I wouldn&#x27;t do this with Cappella. People keep saying things like &quot;come back, the audience want to see you&quot;, which is crazy to me. I thought I was forgotten, replaced, and erased. If I do progress with anything it will be as Kelly O and a celebration of the music I was a part of.&quot;

In a joint statement with Dutch Eurodance group Twenty 4 Seven, it was announced that Kelly Overett will return to the stage performing alongside Stay-C for 2023 performances. Stay-C and Kelly performed a series of shows lasting from May to September. After their tour finished, Kelly moved on to start her solo project and is now performing at 90&#x27;s revival shows as Kelly O.

===Allison Jordan===
Former member Allison Jordan has retired from performing. She has since changed her name to Cloé Hedger and now works as a psychic medium, owns her own store and performs tarot card readings, a hobby she had during her time in the band. In the years after Cappella originally disbanded, she married her husband Stephen, and together they ran a series of magazines called Paranormal, which lasted for several issues.

===Rodney Bishop===
Rodney Bishop has stayed out of the public eye ever since his departure from the band in 1998. When Kelly returned to the Eurodance scene, she stated that she hoped she would reconnect with Rodney as they haven&#x27;t communicated since they first left the band, but would also respect his privacy.

<doc id="908568" wikidata="Q468048" url="?curid=908568" title="Joel Osteen">
<text>Joel Scott Osteen (born March 5, 1963) is an American pastor, televangelist, businessman, and author based in Houston, Texas, United States. Known for his weekly televised services and several best-selling books, Osteen is one of the more prominent figures associated with prosperity theology and the Word of Faith movement.

== Biography ==
Osteen was born in Houston, and is one of six children of John Osteen and Dolores (&quot;Dodie&quot;) Pilgrim. His father, a former Southern Baptist pastor, founded Lakewood Church (of which Osteen is the current senior pastor) in the back of an old feed store.

He graduated from Humble High School, a public high school in the city of Humble, Texas, in 1981, and attended Oral Roberts University in Tulsa, Oklahoma, where he studied radio and television communications but did not graduate.

== Career ==

In 1982, Osteen returned to Houston after leaving Oral Roberts University. He founded Lakewood&#x27;s television program, later becoming ordained through his father&#x27;s church in 1983. Osteen produced his father&#x27;s televised sermons for 17 years until January 1999, when his father died of a heart attack. He would preach his first sermon on January 17, 1999. By October 3, he was the new senior pastor of Lakewood Church.

In 2003, Lakewood Church acquired the Compaq Center, former home of the NBA Houston Rockets and the AHL Houston Aeros and subsequently renovated it.

=== Preaching style ===
Osteen memorizes his planned remarks before he delivers them, and listens back to previous ones on tape. His sermons have been criticized as self-serving and revealing a poor command of Scripture. Osteen says he chooses to focus more on the goodness of God and on living an obedient life rather than on sin, and that he tries to teach Biblical principles in a simple way, emphasizing the power of love and a positive attitude. When asked why he does not focus more on sin, the devil, and hell in detail, Osteen stated in an interview with CBN News:

=== Events===
Since 2004, Osteen, along with his wife, have hosted Night of Hope events, as well as their annual stadium event called &quot;America&#x27;s Night of Hope&quot;, in the U.S. and around the world. The event incorporates contemporary Christian music and inspirational messages to reach the masses at the venue and others watching online. Osteen also hosted an event at his Lakewood Church in 2018, in collaboration with rapper Kanye West, called Sunday Service. According to media reports, the event was attended by 17,000 as well as joined by many people streaming online. He also held his Easter service during COVID-19 with Mariah Carey and Tyler Perry.

===Shooting===

On February 11, 2024, a woman with a history of mental health issues, Genesse Ivonne Moreno, accompanied by her 7-year-old son, entered the church between services and began firing an AR-15 rifle. Two off-duty police officers working security returned fire and killed her. Her son was critically injured with a gunshot to the head by the police officers during the exchange of gunfire. Another man who was present was wounded in the hip, treated at a local hospital and released.

== Personal life ==
On April 4, 1987, Osteen married Victoria Osteen (née Iloff), who later would become co-pastor of Lakewood Church. They have two children. In 2002, some of his siblings, including Paul, were also involved in full-time ministry.

Osteen lives with his family in a 17,000 square-foot mansion in River Oaks, with an estimated value of $10.5 million. Osteen says that as senior pastor, he draws no salary from the church, which has an annual budget of $70 million; instead, he relies on income from book sales.

== Political and social views ==
Osteen has generally avoided discussing or preaching about controversial issues such as gay marriage, abortion, and politics. Having gone on record saying homosexuality is &quot;not God&#x27;s best&quot;, he has stated he believes the church has a tendency to become overly focused on single issues (such as homosexuality) to the point of neglecting others. When asked if he thought God approves of homosexuality, Osteen said homosexuality is a sin according to his interpretation of Scripture, but said gay people are welcome in his church without judgment.

In an interview on Fox News in 2008 during the Republican Party presidential primary race, when discussing whether he thought that Mormons were Christians, Osteen indicated that he believed that they were. He further revealed that he had not studied the religion. In an interview in 2011, Osteen stated his support for Israel.

== Controversies ==
=== Prosperity gospel ===
Osteen&#x27;s sermons and writings are sometimes criticized for promoting prosperity theology, or the prosperity gospel, a belief that the reward of material gain is the will of God for all pious Christians. Critics of prosperity gospel consider its teachings anathema to the gospel of Mark:

On October 14, 2007, &quot;60 Minutes&quot; ran a 12-minute segment on Osteen, titled &quot;Joel Osteen Answers His Critics&quot;, during which Reformed theologian Michael Horton told CBS News correspondent Byron Pitts that Osteen&#x27;s message is heresy. Horton stated that the problem with Osteen&#x27;s message is that it makes religion about us instead of about God.

Osteen is estimated to have a net worth of over $50 million, with his church taking in $43 million a year in collections. According to the &quot;Houston Chronicle&quot;, Osteen denied taking any pandemic CARES Act assistance, but U.S. Small Business Administration data revealed his church actually received $4.4 million from the fund. The church paid back this loan in 2021, and also retired their 19-year debt from a 100 million dollar construction loan in December 2023.

=== Hurricane Harvey response ===
During the immediate aftermath of Hurricane Harvey in August 2017, Osteen was criticized for not making Lakewood Church, a 606,000-square-foot, 16,000-seat former sports arena, available as an emergency shelter for those displaced by the storm. On August 27, posts from the church and a Lakewood Church associate pastor&#x27;s social media accounts stated that the church was &quot;inaccessible due to severe flooding,&quot; and associate pastor John Gray posted further, &quot;If WE could get there WE WOULD OPEN THE DOORS.&quot; Lakewood spokesperson Don Iloff later described floodwaters as one foot from spilling over the facility&#x27;s floodgate and surging into the building. He also stated that pictures showing Lakewood free of flooding were taken on Monday, after the flood waters had lowered.

Osteen disputed the claim that flood waters closed the church, saying &quot;the church has been open from the beginning,&quot; and, &quot;[w]e&#x27;ve always been open ... How this notion got started, that we&#x27;re not a shelter and we&#x27;re not taking people in is a false narrative.&quot; This contradicted his earlier statement that the church would open when other refugee centers were full. On the evening of August 28, it was announced by Lakewood that it would open at noon the next day as an available shelter to storm victims and emergency personnel, which it did.

On August 15, 2018, less than a year after Harvey struck, the City of Houston and Mayor Sylvester Turner proclaimed a day in honor of the assistance of Lakewood and Osteen in rebuilding efforts across the Houston area.

=== Other ===
In 2011, Osteen and Lakewood Church were sued by the band the American Dollar for copyright infringement. A judge in 2012 ruled in favor of Osteen.

<doc id="908572" wikidata="Q6647837" url="?curid=908572" title="Lithe">
<text>Lithe is an experimental programming language created in 1982 by David Sandberg at the University of Washington which allows the programmer to freely choose their own syntax. Lithe combines the ideas of syntax-directed translation and classes in a novel manner that results in a remarkably simple yet powerful language.

==Overview==
The standard class-based programming model does not specify a mechanism by which to manipulate objects: where Smalltalk uses message passing, Lithe uses syntax-directed translation (SDT). SDT is a method of translating a string into a sequence of &quot;actions&quot; by attaching one such action to each rule of a grammar. Thus, parsing a string of the grammar produces a sequence of rule applications. Lithe merges SDT with the class model by using classes as the non-terminal alphabet of the grammar. Since the grammar class used by Lithe properly contains all context-free grammars, a wide variety of syntax can be described, and SDT provides a simple way to attach semantics to any such syntax.

The &quot;package&quot; is the unit of program modularity in Lithe. A package is divided into two parts: one that defines classes and another that defines rules. Information hiding is achieved by requiring both &quot;export&quot; keywords on those rules and classes that are to be seen outside a package &quot;and&quot; that the source package names be included in the &quot;with&quot; clause of the consumer package.

==Examples==
Programming in Lithe consists of defining rule-action pairs and classes. Take the task of computing the absolute value of a number, for example:

 rule &quot;|&quot; &lt;i:int&gt; &quot;|&quot; return int;
 {if i&lt;0 then return -i else return i end}

After this rule-action pair has been defined, it can be freely used within Lithe source code, for example, the following expression will thereafter be valid:

 |x - y| + 3

The equivalent rule in BNF would be:

 &lt;int&gt; ::= &quot;|&quot; &lt;int&gt; &quot;|&quot;

Note that the Lithe description swaps the left and right sides of the BNF one, then adds a name to each nonterminal in the BNF right-hand side. These names are used in the action part, which is expressed as a string that is translated into a sequence of actions by using other, previously defined, rule-action pairs (eventually, some of those rule-action pairs will invoke primitive actions).

<text>A police station (sometimes called a &quot;station house&quot; or just &quot;house&quot;) is a building which serves to accommodate police officers and other members of police staff. Police stations typically contain offices and accommodation for personnel and vehicles, along with locker rooms, temporary holding cells and interview/interrogation rooms.

==Names==
Large departments may have many stations to cover the area they serve. The names used for these facilities include:
*&quot;Barracks&quot; for many American state police and highway patrol stations and in Ireland
*&quot;District office&quot;, typically used by American state police forces like the California Highway Patrol, but also used by smaller departments like the Calgary Police Service
*&quot;Precinct house&quot;, or &quot;precinct&quot;, for some urban police departments in the United States such as the New York City Police Department, Memphis Police Department, and Newark Police Department, where stations are in charge of precincts
*&quot;Police house&quot;
*&quot;Police office&quot;, especially in Scotland
*&quot;Station house&quot;
*&quot;Substation&quot;, smaller stations used by many departments, especially county sheriffs
*&quot;Detachment&quot;, most notably used by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police
*&quot;Thana&quot;, used in the Indian subcontinent
Multiple informal names exist, such as &quot;cop shop&quot;, &quot;cophouse&quot; or (in the UK) &quot;nick&quot;.

The area a police station serves has a variety of different names, such as precinct, district, division and zone. However, in some police forces such as Hampshire Constabulary, police stations do not serve a specific area and the officers have great flexibility over where they can operate.

==Facilities==
Typical facilities at police stations typically include:
*Office space where officers, detectives and administrative staff can work
*Cells for detainees. In the UK, the area with cells is known as a custody suite
*Interview rooms for both detainees and non-detained visitors
*Evidence rooms for storing evidence and seized property
*Lockers and storerooms for storing equipment
*A reception desk for public visitors
A room for personnel from other emergency services

Specialized stations exist in a number of countries, typically containing more or less of these facilities. An example includes women&#x27;s police stations in Latin America.

==By country==
===Greece===

There are 1,024 police stations and directorates in the Greek territory, each of them is responsible for the safety of the citizens in their area. They usually have parking areas for vehicles, interrogation areas and holding cells.

===India===
In India, police stations are referred to as &quot;&quot;thana&quot; or &quot;thane&quot;&quot;. The term &quot;thana&quot; is derived from the Persian word &quot;sthan&quot;, which means a place or location. The British colonial administration adopted this term, and it has been widely used ever since. There are regional variations, such as &quot;Kāval nilaiyam&quot; in Tamil Nadu, etc. Police stations have a designated area under their jurisdiction. Police stations are headed by a station house officer (SHO) who may be of inspector or sub-inspector rank, assisted by an assistant sub-inspector, head constables, and constables. The number of personnel in a particular police station depend on many factors like area covered, population, topography, crime rate, sensitivity, important places and others. Some police stations may have police outposts under them. Police outposts are set up when areas covered by police stations have difficult topography, a lack of transportation, high population density, communally sensitive places and border points, or if the area is very large. There are many police stations in India which lack basic infrastructure like proper buildings, landline telephones, wireless sets, vehicles, computers and adequate police personnel. Specialized police stations also exist for specific purposes, such as cyber crime, railway, traffic enforcement, and women.

===Ireland===
The police stations (or barracks) of the Garda Síochána come in the following types, in ascending order of size:
*Sub-district stations: Stations in small towns and villages, led by an officer who is no higher in rank than a sergeant. Since the 1980s, many of these small stations have been closed or reduced to operating part-time.
*District headquarters: Located in the largest town in a Garda district, with the most senior officer being a superintendent.
*Divisional headquarters: Located in the largest town or city within a Garda division, which in turn comprises multiple districts. The most senior officer is a chief superintendent.
*Garda headquarters: Located in Phoenix Park, Dublin and includes the office of the Garda Commissioner, as well as other senior officers.

=== Iran ===
FARAJA police command established in 2022 replaced NAJA police force has provincial and county commands, Police electronic offices are called Police +10 (پلیس+۱۰). Iranian cities needs 2000 more police stations/bases per deputy command. There are four thousand patrols.

===United Kingdom===
The county constabularies in Great Britain were previously organised on a village basis. Most villages of any size had a &quot;police house&quot;. Police houses in small villages were often staffed by a single uniformed constable, with larger stations being staffed by more. Local police stations were grouped together under the command of a uniformed sergeant, whose station was known as a &quot;sergeant&#x27;s station&quot;. Larger towns in the county constabulary areas had police stations staffed by a number of officers, often under the command of an inspector or superintendent, usually also commanding a sub-division or division respectively, and therefore giving the names of &quot;sub-divisional station&quot; or &quot;divisional station&quot; to their stations.

In Scotland a police station may be referred to as a police office.

===United Arab Emirates===
As well as traditional, staffed, police stations, there are a number of kiosks in Dubai allowing instant access to police services via a video touchscreen.

<text>Deputy minister is a title borne by politicians or officials in certain countries governed under a parliamentary system. A deputy minister is positioned in some way ‘under’ a minister, who is a full member of Cabinet, in charge of a particular standing policy portfolio, and typically oversees an associated civil service department. Depending on the jurisdiction, a &quot;Deputy minister&quot; may be a Cabinet minister who regularly acts as and for a more senior cabinet minister (rare except in the case of &quot;Deputy Prime Minister&quot;), a junior minister assigned to assist a cabinet minister, an elected member of the governing party or coalition assigned to assist a specific cabinet minister ‘from the back benches’ (i.e., not part of the Cabinet, Government or Ministry) or a non-elected head of a civil service department taking political direction from a Cabinet minister.

*Bangladesh: A Deputy minister is junior to a Minister of a Department of State (portfolio minister) and of similar standing to a Parliamentary Secretary.
*Canada: The Deputy minister is the senior civil servant in a government department and takes political direction from an appointed minister of the Crown.
*Japan: A Deputy Minister assists the work of the Cabinet of Japan.
*Malaysia: A Deputy minister is not a member of the Cabinet and also called half minister. It is secondary to and ranked below ministers. Deputy ministers deputise for ministers. A ministry usually has one or two deputy ministers.
*Netherlands: A State Secretary is the title of a junior member of the Cabinet of the Netherlands.
*Poland: The ministries are staffed by secretaries of state and undersecretaries of state, commonly referred to as deputy ministers. Their task is to assist the Minister and replace him if necessary. Main article: 
*South Africa: A Deputy Minister is secondary to cabinet ministers. The Official Opposition Shadow Cabinet also has deputy shadow ministers.
*Sri Lanka: A Deputy ministers are junior ministers ranking below that of cabinet minister and State Minister. It is similar to the pre-1972 post of Parliamentary Secretary. 
*Tanzania: The Deputy ministers are junior ministers, and are usually not members of the government&#x27;s cabinet.
*Timor-Leste: The Government, which comprises the Prime Minister, Ministers and Secretaries of State, may include one or more Deputy Prime Ministers and Deputy Ministers.

<text>GDSII stream format (GDSII), is a binary database file format which is the de facto industry standard for electronic design automation (EDA) data exchange of integrated circuit (IC) or IC layout artwork. It is a binary file format representing planar geometric shapes, text labels, and other information about the layout in hierarchical form (two-dimensional/2D CAD file format). The data can be used to reconstruct all or part of the artwork to be used in sharing layouts, transferring artwork between different tools, or creating photomasks.

== History ==
GDS = Graphic Design System (see [GDS78])

Initially, GDSII was designed as a stream format used to control integrated circuit photomask plotting. Despite its limited set of features and low data density, it became the industry conventional stream format for transfer of IC layout data between design tools of different vendors, all of which operated with proprietary data formats.

It was originally developed by Calma for its layout design system, &quot;Graphic Design System&quot; (&quot;GDS&quot;) and &quot;GDSII&quot;.

GDSII files are usually the final output product of the IC design cycle and are handed over to IC foundries for IC fabrication. GDSII files were originally written on magnetic tape. The final deadline for IC designers is still called tape-out for this reason.

Objects contained in a GDSII file are grouped by assigning numeric attributes to them including a &quot;layer number&quot;, &quot;datatype&quot; or &quot;texttype&quot;. While these attributes were designed to correspond to the &quot;layers of material&quot; used in manufacturing an integrated circuit, their meaning rapidly became more abstract to reflect the way that the physical layout is designed.

As of April 2008, many EDA software vendors have moved to the stream format OASIS, which replaced GDSII.

== GDSII utilities ==

As the GDSII stream format is a de facto standard, it is supported by nearly all EDA software. Besides the commercial vendors there are plenty of free GDSII utilities. These free tools include editors, viewers, utilities to convert the 2D layout data into common 3D formats, utilities to fly through a 3D version, utilities to convert the binary format to a human readable ASCII format and program libraries.

<text>Forrest is a small hamlet situated in the Rural Municipality of Elton, Manitoba, Canada. In the 2001 census the municipality had a population of around 1,337.

Forrest is located approximately north of the intersection of the Trans-Canada Highway and PTH 10, near Brandon.

Forrest was first established in the early 1880s, at the time of the western railroad was completed. It was named for W. H. Forrest, official receiver for the Great North West Central who later became Government Inspector of Railways.

Serviced by the railway, Forrest had two grain elevators: a wooden one and a second elevator constructed in the late 1920s by Manitoba Pool Elevators with an annex built in 1956. Forrest lost its rail connection in 1980 and both elevators were demolished in 2018.

Forrest has one business, The Bend in the Willow tea house. It also hosts a farmers market throughout the summer months. Northeast of the hamlet along Justice Road is a bed and breakfast called the Elton Heritage House.

Forrest is also home to the Forrest United Church, Elton Collegiate, and Forrest Elementary School.

<text>Geylang () is a planning area and township located on the eastern fringe of the Central Region of Singapore, bordering Hougang and Toa Payoh in the north, Marine Parade in the south, Bedok in the east, and Kallang in the west.

Geylang is previously known as a red-light district, particularly the areas along Geylang Road. Today only 3-4 units remain for brothels and street walkers are hard to come by. Geylang is also where one of Singapore&#x27;s oldest Malay settlements, Geylang Serai, is located. During Ramadan, the neighbourhood is famous for its popular and iconic Ramadan lights and bazaars.

The word &quot;Geylang&quot; is found early in Singapore&#x27;s history and also in early topographical maps showing marsh and coconut plantations beside and adjacent to the mouth of the Kallang River, home to the Orang Laut (sea gypsies) called &quot;orang biduanda kallang&quot; who inhabited the area at the time of Raffles&#x27; arrival in 1819, and after whom the river is named. &quot;Geylang&quot; may be a corruption of &quot;Kallang.&quot; The place name appeared in an 1830 survey map of Singapore as &quot;Kilang,&quot; but by 1838 was spelled as &quot;Kelang,&quot; which when pronounced in correct Malay is nearly indistinguishable to the ear from &quot;Geylang.&quot; However, &quot;kilang&quot; also means press, mill, or factory in Malay and could be a reference to the presses and mills in the coconut plantations that used to be in the area. Another possible etymological link in the stock vocabulary of the Malay is &quot;geylanggan&quot; meaning to &quot;twist&quot; or &quot;crush&quot; a reference to the process of extracting the coconut meat and milk used by the locals to thicken curries in Malay-Chinese (Peranakan) cuisine.

Another possible explanation is that Geylang is a corruption of the Malay word &#x27;gelang&#x27; which is a type of edible creeper (Portulaca oleracea). This is a plausible explanation for the name because Malays typically name places based on the abundance of certain plant species (e.g. Melaka after the eponyming tree) or geological formations (e.g. Bukit Gombak based on the comb-like hill summit).

==Geography==
===Location===
Grouped under the Central Region, Geylang Planning Area is bordered by Hougang and Toa Payoh in the north, Kallang in the west, Marine Parade in the south, and Bedok in the east. Beginning in the north and moving in a clockwise direction, the boundaries of Geylang are made up of MacPherson Road, Airport Road, Eunos Link, Jalan Eunos, Still Road, Koon Seng Road, Dunman Road, the Geylang River, Mountbatten Road, Sims Way, and the Pan Island Expressway (PIE).

Geylang New Town as defined by the Housing and Development Board (HDB) sits within the Geylang Planning Area.

===Subdivisions===
Geylang Planning Area is made up of five &quot;subzones&quot;, as officially defined by the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA).

==History==

The development of Geylang can best be observed along the main trunk road, Geylang Road, that leads westwards towards the city. Micro-businesses founded by Malay, Indian and Chinese entrepreneurs seized start-up opportunities as mechanics in bicycle or motor repair workshops, suppliers of wood for making boats, houses, furniture and as merchants in iron, of floor and roofing tiles, in rubber and later plastics for all kinds of marine, industrial, factory and home use, including the mosaic of temples, mosques and churches in Geylang that have its roots serving local worshippers in search of spirituality and the divine.

One of the distinctive hallmarks of Geylang architecture is the preservation of its shophouses used by the clan (kinship) associations, set up as a (first) point of contact for newcomers in the migrant wave between 1840 and 1940 for integrating the newcomers into the ways and customs of locals. At present, the Geylang neighbourhood accurately reflects demographic changes in Singapore (2011) where out of every four Singaporeans, one is a foreigner.

As a strategic and military outpost for the British, it was important that the sea lanes off the Straits of Malacca were kept free of pirates, and open for shipping. As the British expanded in influence and power, Singapore served East and West interests as a natural deep-harbour destination that played host to the French, Portuguese, Dutch and other European navies and their men. Other seaports in Asia, from Shanghai to Calcutta, also played a role in the traffic of women and girls for prostitution.

==Geylang Serai==
1900s A terminal for the first tramway in Singapore was then built in Geylang Serai while the farmers staying there already shifted to cultivate other cash crops, including rubber and coconuts. Meanwhile, with the intensified urbanisation, the rural community in Geylang Serai, where the price of land was low, was turned into a suburb.

1940s During the occupation by Japanese in World War 2 (1942 to 1945), Geylang Serai was severely damaged, and the shortages of food that arose afterwards led to the replacement of the plantations of coconut and rubber by those of tapioca, which gave Geylang Serai the name, Kampong Ubi (tapioca in Malay). With the end of Japanese occupation, Geylang Serai saw a rise in population and more areas were occupied. The inflow of more Malays and outflow of Chinese changed the demographic of Geylang Serai, which turned into predominantly a Malay community ever since.

1960s In 1963, the Housing and Development Board (HDB) initiated The Geylang Serai Housing Redevelopment Scheme which was carried out in three phases, investing a sum of 3.8 million SGD for the renewal of the region. Under the scheme, Many HDB flats and new facilities were constructed, including Taj cinema, Concourse, light industrial properties, shopping malls and Geylang Serai market.

1980s The old kampungs in the region vanished and Geylang Serai turned into a modern residential district.

2000s In tandem with the urbanization of the region, the importance of preservation of Malay cultural heritage was recognized by the government. Under the Masterplan of 2008 by the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA), the development of the Paya Lebar Central, within which Geylang Serai is situated, into a centre characterised with a distinct cultural identity was confirmed. Until now, Geylang Serai market is still one of the busiest and largest wet markets in Singapore, offering many Indian-Muslim and Malay dishes as well as a large variety of spices and ingredient for making of traditional Malay cuisine, such as cinnamon and nutmeg.

==Infrastructure==
Geylang&#x27;s combination of shophouse scenery and hectic day and night life, including foreign workers quarters and karaoke lounges, provides an alternative view of elements the rest of modern Singapore generally does not offer. Shophouses along Geylang Road form part of the Geylang Conservation Area and are protected from redevelopment, and many restaurants have sprung up along this major road. Geylang is also known for its durian shops; as well as many shops offering traditional Malay folk medicine which despite playing as important a role as traditional Chinese medicine does not receive as much attention and endorsement from the Singapore government as the latter.

===Shopping Malls===
The Geylang planning area consists of 9 shopping malls, with a concentration of shopping malls located near Paya Lebar MRT station:
* Pavilion Square
* Paya Lebar Square
* Paya Lebar Quarter (PLQ)
* SingPost Centre
* Grandlink Square
* KINEX
* City Plaza
* Tanjong Katong Complex
* Joo Chiat Complex

==Transport==

===Roads===
The Geylang area is composed of north and south sections that are divided by Geylang Road which stretches for about three kilometres. Throughout the length of Geylang Road, there are lanes (&quot;lorong&quot; in Malay) that extend perpendicularly from the main road. The lanes in the north are given odd numbered names (i.e. Lorong 1, Lorong 3, Lorong 5 and so on), and the lanes in the south are given even numbered names (i.e. Lorong 2, Lorong 4, Lorong 6 and so on).

The following expressways pass through Geylang:
*Pan Island Expressway (PIE) connects Geylang with Changi Airport, Tampines, Bedok, Kallang, Toa Payoh, Clementi, Jurong East, Jurong West and Tuas;
*Kallang-Paya Lebar Expressway (KPE) connects Geylang with Kallang, Hougang, Sengkang and Punggol.

Major roads within Geylang Planning Area include Aljunied Road, Kallang Way, Paya Lebar Road, Geylang East Central, Ubi Avenue 2 and Circuit Road.

===Trains===

There are currently eight Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) stations in the Geylang Planning Area across three lines: The East West line, the Circle line and the Downtown line. 

The eight stations are:

* Eunos
* Paya Lebar
* Aljunied
* Mountbatten
* Dakota
* MacPherson
* Mattar
* Ubi

==Cultural depiction==

<doc id="908604" wikidata="Q906917" url="?curid=908604" title="Space Station Freedom">
<text>Space Station &quot;Freedom&quot; was a NASA-led multi-national project proposed in the 1980s to construct a permanently crewed space station in low Earth orbit. Despite initial approval by President Ronald Reagan and a public announcement in the 1984 State of the Union Address, the ambitious project faced significant budget cuts and delays. Ultimately, a scaled-down version of Freedom evolved into the US Orbital Segment (USOS) of the International Space Station (ISS).

By the time the project was canceled, NASA had already invested approximately $11 billion into Space Station &quot;Freedom&quot;, however some of that work would benefit the ISS. As originally envisioned, the station would have been collaborative project involving four participating space agencies: NASA (United States), NASDA (Japan), ESA (Europe), and CSA (Canada). Those same partners would go on to build the USOS, but the ISS program also included Roscosmos of Russia who contributed their significant experience building and operating space stations during Mir and the Salyut program to construct the Russian Orbital Segment.

==Original proposal==
As the Apollo program began to wind down in the late 1960s, there were numerous proposals for what should follow it. Of the many proposals, large and small, three major themes emerged. Foremost among them was a crewed mission to Mars, using systems not unlike the ones used for Apollo. A permanent space station was also a major goal, both to help construct the large spacecraft needed for a Mars mission as well as to learn about long-term operations in space. Finally, a space logistics vehicle was intended to cheaply launch crews and cargo to that station.

In the early 1970s, Spiro Agnew took these general plans to President Nixon, who was battling with a major federal budget deficit. When he presented the three concepts, Nixon told him to select one. After much debate, NASA selected the space logistics vehicle, which by this time was already known as the Space Shuttle. They argued that the Shuttle would so lower costs of launching cargo that it would make the construction of the station less expensive.

From this point forward these plans were never seriously changed, in spite of dramatic changes to the funding environment and the complete redesign of the Shuttle concept. In the early 1980s, with the Space Shuttle completed, NASA proposed the creation of a large, permanently crewed space station, which then-NASA Administrator James M. Beggs called &quot;the next logical step&quot; in space. In some ways it was meant to be the U.S. answer to the Soviet &quot;Mir&quot;.

NASA plans called for the station, which was later dubbed Space Station &quot;Freedom&quot;, to function as an orbiting repair shop for satellites, an assembly point for spacecraft, an observation post for astronomers, a microgravity laboratory for scientists, and a microgravity factory for companies.

Reagan announced plans to build Space Station &quot;Freedom&quot; in 1984, stating: &quot;We can follow our dreams to distant stars, living and working in space for peaceful economic and scientific gain.&quot;

==Design iterations==
Following the presidential announcement, NASA began a set of studies to determine the potential uses for the space station, both in research and in industry, in the U.S. or overseas. This led to the creation of a database of thousands of possible missions and payloads; studies were also carried out with a view to supporting potential planetary missions, as well as those in low Earth orbit.

Several Space Shuttle missions in the 1980s and early 1990s included spacewalks to demonstrate and test space station construction techniques. After the establishment of the initial baseline design, the project evolved extensively, growing in scope and cost.

===&quot;Power Tower&quot; (1984)===
In April 1984, the newly established Space Station Program Office at Johnson Space Center produced a first reference configuration; this design would serve as a baseline for further planning. The chosen design was the &quot;Power Tower&quot;, a long central keel with most mass located at either end. This arrangement would provide enough gravity gradient stability to keep the station aligned with the keel pointed towards the Earth, reducing the need for thruster firings. Most designs featured a cluster of modules at the lower end and a set of articulated solar arrays at the upper end. It also contained a servicing bay. In April 1985, the program selected a set of contractors to carry out definition studies and preliminary design; various trade-offs were made in this process, balancing higher development costs against reduced long-term operating costs.

===Revised Baseline Configuration (1987)===
At the same time, late 1986, NASA carried out a study into new configuration options to reduce development costs; options studied ranged from the use of a Skylab-type station to a phased development of the Dual-Keel configuration. This approach involved splitting assembly into two phases; Phase 1 would provide the central modules, and the transverse boom, but with no keels. The solar arrays would be augmented to ensure 75 kW of power would be provided, and the polar platform and servicing facility were again deferred. The study concluded that the project was viable, reducing development costs while minimizing negative impacts, and it was designated the Revised Baseline Configuration. This would have a development cost of US$15.3 billion (in FY1989 dollars) and FEL in the first quarter of 1994. This replanning was endorsed by the National Research Council in September 1987, which also recommended that the long-term national goals should be studied before committing to any particular Phase 2 design.

During 1986 and 1987, various other studies were carried out on the future of the U.S. space program; the results of these often impacted the Space Station, and their recommendations were folded into the revised baseline as necessary. One of the results of these was to baseline the Station program as requiring five shuttle flights a year for operations and logistics, rotating four crew at a time with the aim of extending individual stay times to 180 days.

===&quot;Freedom&quot; (1988) to &quot;Alpha&quot; (1993)===
NASA signed final ten-year contracts for developing the Space Station in September 1988, and the project was finally moving into the hardware fabrication phase. The station was designed with a thirty year life in mind.

The Space Station &quot;Freedom&quot; design was slightly modified in late 1989 after the program&#x27;s Fiscal 1990 budget again was reduced — from $2.05 billion to $1.75 billion — when the design was found to be 23% overweight and over budget, too complicated to assemble, and providing little power for its users. The 1990 Space Exploration Initiative called for the construction of the Space Station &quot;Freedom&quot;. Congress consequently demanded yet another redesign in October 1990, and requested further cost reductions after the fiscal 1991 budget was cut from $2.5 billion to $1.9 billion. NASA unveiled its new space station design in March 1991.

Repeated budget cuts had forced a postponement of the first launch by a year, to March 1995. The station would be permanently crewed from June 1997 onwards, and completed in February 1998.

In 1993, after more calls for the station to be redesigned again to reduce costs and include more international involvement, the option that became known as Space Station &#x27;Alpha&#x27; was chosen (from three competing concepts), using 75 percent of the hardware designs originally intended for the Freedom program. Cost escalation of the project and financial difficulties in Russia led to a briefing between NASA and NPO Energia on &quot;Mir-2&quot; that same year, resulting in an option known briefly as the Russian Alpha (RAlpha).

In late 1993, &quot;Freedom&quot;, &quot;Mir-2&quot;, and the European and Japanese modules were incorporated into a single International Space Station Alpha (ISSA), with Alpha dropped from the name internally by early 1995. In July 1995, the International Space Station Authorization Act of 1995 House report to U.S.Congress was released and the names Freedom, Alpha, and ISSA were no more. By this time, the hardware meant for Space Station Freedom, then Alpha, that had already been designed and built or was in development, around 10 percent, became part of the ISS.

==Station program placed on hold==
Underestimates by NASA of the station program&#x27;s cost and unwillingness by the U.S. Congress to appropriate funding for the space station resulted in delays of &quot;Freedom&quot;&#x27;s design and construction; it was regularly redesigned and re-scoped. Between 1984 and 1993 it went through seven major re-designs, losing capacity and capabilities each time. Rather than being completed in a decade, as Reagan had predicted, &quot;Freedom&quot; was never built, and no Shuttle launches were made as part of the program.

By 1993, &quot;Freedom&quot; was politically unviable; the administration had changed, and Congress was tiring of paying yet more money into the station program. In addition, there were open questions over the need for the station. Redesigns had cut most of the science capacity by this point, and the Space Race had ended in 1975 with the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project. NASA presented several options to President Clinton, but even the most limited of these was still seen as too expensive. In June 1993, an amendment to remove space station funding from NASA&#x27;s appropriations bill failed by one vote in the House of Representatives. That October, a meeting between NASA and the Russian Space Agency agreed to the merger of the projects into what would become the International Space Station. The merger of the project faced opposition by representatives such as Tim Roemer who feared Russia would break the Missile Technology Control Regime agreement and felt the program was far too costly. Proposed bills did not pass Congress.

==Conversion to the International Space Station==

In 1993, the Clinton administration announced the transformation of Space Station &quot;Freedom&quot; into the International Space Station (ISS). NASA Administrator Daniel Goldin supervised the addition of Russia to the project. To accommodate reduced budgets, the station design was scaled back from 508 to 353 square feet (47 to 33 m2), the crew capacity of the NASA-provided part was reduced from 7 to 3 (while the complete station was initially crewed by 6 it eventually increased to 7), and the station&#x27;s functions were reduced. Its first component was launched into orbit in 1998, with the first long-term residents arriving in November 2000.

<doc id="908605" wikidata="Q463432" url="?curid=908605" title="Ice MC (rapper)">
<text>Ice MC (born Ian Colin Campbell, 22 March 1965) is a British rapper who started his professional music career in Italy, when he got a record deal signing to record producer and singer Savage and released his debut single &quot;Easy&quot; in 1989. He&#x27;s best known for the Eurodance 1990s hit singles &quot;Take Away the Colour&quot;, &quot;Think About the Way&quot; and &quot;It&#x27;s a Rainy Day&quot;. Ice MC singles are most notable for being the first Eurodance songs to blend raggamuffin rapping style with female singing choruses. Zanetti&#x27;s music team produced Ice MC hits while also producing songs for other major Italian artists of the same decade, like Double You, Alexia, and Corona.

==Career==
===The first albums===
In 1989 in Italy, Ice MC met singer and artist Roberto Zanetti (also as composer known as Savage and producer as Robyx). Their first single called &quot;Easy&quot;, made in a hip house style, came out in 1989. It became successful all over Europe, reaching the top 5 in Italy and the top 3 in Germany. The two next singles, &quot;Cinema&quot; and &quot;Scream&quot;, and the subsequent debut album, &quot;Cinema&quot; (released later in 1990), were also successful. In 1992 his second LP, &quot;My World&quot;, came out but failed to achieve the success of its predecessor.

===The most successful hits===
His third album, &quot;Ice&#x27;n&#x27;Green&quot;, was released in 1994 and featured Alexia on vocals. Three of his most successful songs, &quot;Think about the Way&quot;, &quot;It&#x27;s a Rainy Day&quot; and &quot;Take Away the Colour&quot;, made the charts all over the world. For the third album Ice MC adopted an all new dreadlocks look and utilised Jamaican style rap, known as raggamuffin. The album was also released in the US, where the two biggest singles saw substantial club play and moderate dance music radio airplay. In 1995, &quot;Ice&#x27;n&#x27;Green – The Remix Album&quot; was released. This contained various remixes of previous hit singles.

===Collaboration with Masterboy===
In 1996, Ice MC decided to leave Zanetti and Alexia due to some disagreements. Shortly after that a new album, &quot;Dreadatour&quot;, (produced by Masterboy producer Enrico Zabler) was released. The hit from the album was &quot;Give Me the Light&quot;, the second Single-Release from &quot;Dreadatour&quot; was &quot;Music For Money&quot; also produced by Enrico Zabler from Masterboy also the Album-Tracks &quot;Never Stop Believing&quot; and &quot;It&#x27;s Up To You&quot;. The Album &quot;Dreadatour&quot; itself was not a commercial success.

===Since 2002===

At the end of 2002, he decided to return to Italy and to contact Roberto Zanetti again. Together they started writing some new material and, at the beginning of 2004, they began recording a new album, &quot;Cold Skool&quot;.

In 2012 a new single &quot;Out Tonight&quot; featuring Giulia Gal was released and in 2013 the new remixes by Enfortro &amp; Dirty Disciples were released. 

In 2017, the single featuring Nico Heinz and Max Kuhn including an official video were released.

In February 2024, he was selected alongside DJ Jad, Wlady and Corona to compete in the final of &quot;Una voce per San Marino 2024&quot;, the Sammarinese national selection for the Eurovision Song Contest 2024.

<text>Patrick Roland John (7 January 1938 – 6 July 2021) was the first Prime Minister of Dominica as well as its last Premier. He led Dominica to independence from the United Kingdom. He was leader of the Waterfront and Allied Workers&#x27; Union and mayor of Roseau before being elected to the legislature in 1970. He became Premier in 1974 following the resignation of Edward Oliver LeBlanc. After mass protest forced him to resign, John unsuccessfully attempted in 1981 to overthrow the government of Prime Minister Eugenia Charles with the backing of white supremacist groups (in what became dubbed &quot;Operation Red Dog&quot;). As a result, he was jailed for twelve years, of which he served five years.

On 6 July 2021, John died at the Dominica China Friendship Hospital in Roseau, Dominica, at the age of 83.

==Premiership (1974–1978)==
John was elected to the House of Assembly from Roseau North Electoral District / Roseau North Constituency from 1 November 1970. He was appointed Deputy Premier and Minister of Finance in 1973. After the resignation of Edward O. LeBlanc in 1974, John succeeded him as Premier of Dominica. The Labour Party administration led by John founded Dominica&#x27;s National Commercial &amp; Development Bank, and rid the capital city of Roseau of many shanty-type dwellings and replaced them with modern housing developments at Bath Estate and River Estate. John&#x27;s government also opened a new deepwater harbour at Fond Cole and started the Dominica Social Security system.

However, division grew in Dominica following the murder of a number of tourists in the mid-1970s and the emergence of a black power movement. John introduced legislation so broadly drawn that it even regulated acceptable modes of dress. Later, he indicated that revolutionary groups would not be tolerated. His reign as Premier and Prime Minister was regarded as one of the most tumultuous periods in Dominica&#x27;s history. He was responsible for the infamous Prohibited and Undesirable Societies Act or &quot;Dread Act&quot;, which was passed in 1974 and was meant to combat the lawlessness of countless Dominican youth. That act made it legal to arrest any &quot;Dread&quot; without a warrant and deny bail to anyone wearing &quot;a badge of the society&quot; i.e. dreadlocks.

==Prime Ministership (1978–1979)==
John became the first Prime Minister of Dominica on 3 November 1978 when the country was granted independence from Britain.

John was the honorary commander of Dominica&#x27;s 80-strong defense force and was in favor of a mixed economy. Internationally, he showed interest in development that saw the island&#x27;s future linked with the West. One of his first acts after independence was to establish diplomatic relations with South Korea.

===Crisis phase and resignation===
Sentiment against the Labour Party government led by John continued to grow after the implementation of the Dread Act. On 29 May 1979, John&#x27;s attempts to quell opposition to his leadership led to a clash outside parliament in which a young man named Phillip Timothy and another individual were killed, and a dozen others wounded. Resistance to his rule strengthened as public servants went on strike and the country was completely shut down. The Committee for National Salvation, led by Charles Savarin, called for a general strike and the resignation of John and the government.

One by one, Labour Party parliamentarians resigned their positions in the cabinet and they were often aided by a rain of stones from protesters. The first Labour Party minister to resign was Oliver Seraphin who then went on to become interim Prime Minister until elections in July 1980. On June 11, 1979, President Frederick Degazon fled to Britain. John was voted out of office by the House of Assembly on June 20, 1979, and the general strike ended the next day.

==Later political life==
John led the rump Labour Party in the 1980 general election, however, he lost his seat in the Dominica House of Assembly. 

Dominica Democratic Labour Party merged back to Labour Party in 1983, and Oliver Seraphin was elected party leader and John as his deputy. He was replaced as deputy party leader by Seraphin in 1985. John was elected again into the House of Assembly from St. Joseph constituency, from 1 July 1985 to 20 February 1986.

==Coup attempt==
In 1981 John was among seven individuals including former commander of the DDF Major Frederick Newton, who were arrested for alleged plots to overthrow the government. That year there were two attempted coups d&#x27;état. Disaffected Dominica Defense Force (DDF) members, aided by a group of Dreads (Rastafarians) near Giraudel, and foreign mercenaries sought to overthrow the duly elected Dominica Freedom Party government led by Prime Minister Mary Eugenia Charles. The attempts at a coup d&#x27;état were discovered, thwarted, and the plotters both in Dominica and the United States were exposed.

Under emergency powers, John and others were arrested in 1981 for their involvement in Operation Red Dog, which had the aim of restoring John to power with the aid of Canadian and American citizens, largely affiliated with white supremacist and Ku Klux Klan groups. In court cases which followed, the trial judge found that John was initially released, but the State appealed and the Court of Appeal ordered a new trial to take place. On October 23, 1985, John was found guilty and sentenced to 12 years&#x27; imprisonment for conspiring to overthrow the government. John was later pardoned by the same Prime Minister Mary Eugenia Charles he sought to overthrow, and he was released from prison on May 29, 1990.

==Sports==
Following his release from prison, John, formerly a member of the Dominica national football team, became a local football administrator. In 1992, he was elected President of the Dominica Football Association (DFA). Under his leadership the DFA became a FIFA affiliate in 1994. He served as President until 2006, when he was voted out of office by the local football fraternity. In 2007, he was inducted into the CONCACAF Hall of Fame. In May 2008, he was re-elected as President of the DFA. The DFA administrative headquarters is named &quot;Patrick John Football House&quot; in honour of him. In November 2011, John was banned by FIFA from the sport for two years and fined $3,300, for his part in an alleged bribery scheme involving FIFA presidential candidate Mohamed bin Hammam.

<doc id="908616" wikidata="Q200856" url="?curid=908616" title="Wild Wadi Water Park">
<text>The Wild Wadi Water Park is an outdoor water park in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. Situated in the area of Jumeirah, next to the Burj Al Arab and the Jumeirah Beach Hotel, the water park is operated by Jumeirah International, a Dubai-based hotelier.

== Overlook ==
Wild Wadi has a heated/cooled wave pool, multiple water slides and two artificial surfing machines. The park once had the largest water slide outside of North America, but it has since been removed to make space for two other rides. Another feature of the park is an waterfall that goes off every ten minutes. The water park also has two gift shops, three restaurants and two snack stands.

It was featured in &quot;The Amazing Race 5&quot; and &quot;The Amazing Race Asia 1&quot;, in which teams had to slide down a drop. It was later featured in &quot;The Amazing Race Australia 2&quot;, but instead, the teams had to ride the Surf Machine and use boogie boards to surf their way to the end where they got their next clue.

==Rides==
Ring Rides are the traditional downhill slides. Riders can choose to sit in either a single or double ring.

Tantrum Alley &amp; Burj Surj are two new slides that replaced the family rides. Both are the first of their kind in the region. Tantrum Alley is a slide with a combination of 3 tornados &amp; Burj Surj has 2 bowls.

Jumeirah Sceirah is the tallest and fastest free-fall water slide outside of North and South America. Rising to with riders reaching speeds up to .

FlowRider rides, Wipeout and Riptide, are surfing simulators that shoot out more than seven tons of water per second in a thin sheet across moulded foam structures. These rides produce a realistic wave effect which allows riders to body-board, knee-board or surf.

Breakers Bay is the largest wave pool in the Middle East. It produces parallel and crossing waves in five different configurations.

Juha&#x27;s Journey is a long river which allows guest to relax and slowly float around the park.

Juha’s Dhow and Lagoon is Wild Wadi&#x27;s play area for children and has over 100 water games/rides.

Wipeout AND Riptide have only four of their kind in the world. The Wipeout works by releasing seven tons of water per second in a thin sheet, which is molded by a foam structure. In this way it produces a wave effect which is ideal for body-boarding and knee-boarding.

== Ticketing and Rates ==
The price of tickets in the Wild Wadi water park is based on the height of the person. It is separated into two categories: those above and below 1.1 metres tall. There are discounts on booking tickets in advance from the website. Moreover, children under the age of two are free to enter with proof of age. There are charges for towel and lockers if required.

<doc id="908620" wikidata="Q13424958" url="?curid=908620" title="Birdsill Holly">
<text>Birdsill Holly Jr. (November 8, 1820 – April 27, 1894) was an American mechanical engineer and inventor of water hydraulics devices. He is known for inventing mechanical devices that improved city water systems and patented an improved fire hydrant that is similar to those used currently for firefighting. Holly was a co-inventor of the Silsby steam fire engine. He founded the Holly Manufacturing Company that developed into the larger Holly Steam Combination Company that distributed heat from a central station and developed commercial district heating for cities in the United States and Canada.

==Personal life==

Birdsill Holly Jr. was born on November 8, 1820, in Auburn, New York. His father was Birdsill Holly, Sr. and his mother was Comfort (Parker) Holly. When Holly was born his father moved the family to Auburn to join the crew constructing the new prison facility. When the prison was completed, Birdsill Sr. found a job at the Auburn Theological Seminary in construction, after which he tried to farm without much success. The family moved to Seneca Falls, New York, where there was a water-powered industry with many jobs. Holly grew up in the Seneca Falls, New York, area since his father was able to find work as a millwright and general mechanic.

Holly was forced to drop out of school at the age of eight when his father died prematurely at the age of 37; he was only in the third grade before he had to start supporting his family. He was influenced by his father and took an interest in similar trade skills of mechanical engineering. Holly started an apprenticeship in a cabinetry before he trained as a mechanic. In his late teens Holly became a superintendent in the machine trade and later became an owner of a machine shop in Uniontown, Pennsylvania.

Holly divorced his wife Elizabeth sometime before 1870 and married his adopted daughter Sophia, twenty-eight years his junior. In a Master&#x27;s thesis published in 1996, &quot;The Life And Times Of Birdsill Holly&quot;, Madelynn Frederickson writes that the Lockport society shunned the couple, who moved away temporarily in hopes that the scandal would be forgotten.

Holly died in Lockport, New York, on April 27, 1894, at 7:00 pm at the age of 74. He suffered from a chronic illness and the cause of death was listed as heart failure. 

His grandson and great grandson, Holly Broadbent Sr. and Jr., would go on to contribute to the understanding of craniofacial growth through cephalometric roentgenography as orthodontists at Case Western Reserve University.

== Career ==

Holly moved back to Seneca Falls in his early twenties and became one of the partners of a new firm called Silsby, Race and Holly in 1845. The firm manufactured hydraulic machinery and steam-powered fire engines. As the firm&#x27;s visionary, Holly contributed significantly to their success. In 1849 he received his first patent, which was for a rotary water pump.

Holly was a co-inventor of the Silsby steam fire engine, which was first produced in 1856. More than 1,000 were made, becoming the most popular steam fire engine built in the United States. The unconventional rotary motion steam-cylinder engine and pump were Holly&#x27;s inventions (US39259A and US12350A). The first of these machines weighed up to and produced of steam pressure, enough to propel four streams of water over . The greatest distance recorded for a stream was on September 24, 1881, in Reading, Pennsylvania.

Holly left Seneca Falls in 1851 for Lockport where he established the Holly Manufacturing Company in 1859 with the financial assistance of politicians Washington Hunt and Thomas Flagler. The company produced sewing machines, cistern pumps, and rotary pumps. Holly built the Lockport Fire Protection and Water System in 1863, which used pumps powered by water turbines and steam engines to bring water to hydrants in the city. His system was adopted by Covington, Kentucky, in 1871. He patented a fire hydrant used for fire protection in 1869.

Holly&#x27;s inventions used pressure to pump water directly into the main city water supply lines, since there were no water towers at the time for pressure from a local water supply reservoir for drinking water and fire protection. The pumps ran at various speeds according to usage and was regulated by the pressure in the discharge main. Holly&#x27;s company facilities doubled when he built a similar system for the city of Lockport water works department. He applied his water works system equipment in more than two thousand cities in the United States and Canada.

Holly&#x27;s system of pumping water into Lockport&#x27;s city mains was unique. It not only supplied drinking water for domestic service, but also stored water under pressure for hydrants in a city fire protection service. His technological innovations provided the impetus for similar city water works construction projects across the United States.

Holly&#x27;s interests switched from fire protection systems to central heating. He wondered if there was a more efficient way to heat several nearby buildings rather than using individual small boilers in each building. He set up an experimental steam heating system at his home in Lockport in 1876. Holly ran an underground pipe from his house to a steam boiler away in the backyard. Through this wooden pipe he ran steam and found that there was little heat loss. He repeated the experiment with a 100-foot pipe to a neighbor&#x27;s house. The experiment was successful and he convinced others of the possibility of wide-scale central steam heating.

Holly formed a company of investors interested in his steam concept of central heating with a capital of $25,000. He merged the new company with the Holly Manufacturing Company to establish the Holly Steam Combination Company in 1877. Its goals were to commercially distribute heat from a central station and develop district heating for towns and cities in Canada and the United States. Holly&#x27;s district heating system used a large boiler at a central plant and provided steam to a group of town buildings in a surrounding city district through a circuit of insulated water pipes that distributed steam and returned it as water after being condensed. The pipes were insulated to reduce heat loss. The serviced buildings were metered with a steam quantity recorder invented by Holly. The consumer was charged for the heat consumed from the steam supply in accordance with coal comparison rates.

Holly designed and invented all the necessary control regulators and measuring devices to run a heating system for a city district. He patented 150 inventions in his lifetime. He was a friend of inventor Thomas Edison, who asked Holly to become an assistant at his research laboratory in Menlo Park. Holly refused, as he wished to concentrate on his own businesses instead.

== Unrealized plans ==
Holly dreamed of constructing a nineteen-story skyscraper. He thought that Niagara Falls would become a tourist attraction someday, so he proposed the idea of building a structure on Goat Island near the falls for viewing. The plan was never realized due to a lack of finances; he was unable to gather enough investors for such an expensive and highly speculative project. Although Holly&#x27;s skyscraper was never built, the Skylon Tower, measuring high from the bottom of the falls, was constructed near the proposed site. The concept of similar heights for skyscrapers became popular in New York City shortly before Holly&#x27;s death in 1894, but did not originate from his architectural designs.

== Works ==
The following are some of his 150 patents:

* February 6, 1855 – Elliptical or Rotary pump (US12350 A)
* July 3, 1855 – Method of regulating issue-apertures and of suspending turbine wheels (US13172 A)
* July 14, 1863 – Improvement in pumps (US39259 A)
* November 15, 1864 – Improvement in pumps (US45040 A)

<text>Academia del Perpetuo Socorro (English: &quot;Academy of Our Lady of Perpetual Help&quot;) was founded in 1921 as a Catholic parochial school of the Perpetuo Socorro Parish at the Archdiocese of San Juan, Puerto Rico. The school is located in Miramar in Puerto Rico&#x27;s capital city of San Juan. Students, teachers and alumni commonly refer to their school as Perpetuo. 
==Mission==
The goal of the Academia del Perpetuo Socorro is the complete development of the student - spiritually, mentally, morally, socially, culturally, and physically in order to live a full life and to prepare for his/her final goal - union with God. To this end, the school works to create a Catholic academic community in which faith, knowledge, and recreation are shared in a spirit of freedom, love, and creativity. The school, however, does not emphasize religion over other subjects, accepts students of all faiths and does not impose religious requirements such as baptism, confirmation or church attendance as a condition for continued attendance.

==Motto==
&quot;Esto Perpetua&quot; translated as &quot;This Endures&quot; stressing how the Catholic values and formal academic education learned at this school, symbolized in the school seal by the oil lamp over the open book, (as in burning the midnight oil) are to permeate individuals and society forever.

==Clubs==
==Sports teams==
Academia del Perpetuo Socorro has the largest gymnasium in the Caribbean. This gymnasium has three wooden volleyball courts that can also be transformed into two basketball courts. The gymnasium also has a small gym where athletes, faculty members, and students can go to do exercise.

Perpetuo has a varsity program in ten sports:
==In popular media==
The school is featured prominently in Magali García Ramis&#x27;s novel &quot;Felices Días, Tío Sergio&quot;. The school was the main film location for the movie &quot;Casi casi&quot; (2006) and forms the basis for the fictional school featured in the film.

<text>Sluts of Trust are a two-piece rock outfit from Glasgow, Scotland, originally comprising John McFarlane (guitar, vocals) and Anthony O&#x27;Donnell (drums). O&#x27;Donnell was later replaced on drums by Roo Harris.

==History==
===Early career===
Sluts of Trust were formed in the summer of 2002 by John McFarlane and Anthony O&#x27;Donnell, after a wild three-day party, which became known as the Pirate Weekend. McFarlane and O&#x27;Donnell had first met as teenagers at Scottish Youth Theatre&#x27;s Summer Festival in 1995. In the intervening years, both had begun aborted courses at Glasgow University and Cardonald College respectively, and had enjoyed limited success with separate musical projects. O&#x27;Donnell in Crambo, and in a band with fellow SYT graduate and future &quot;Harry Potter&quot; actor Sean Biggerstaff, and McFarlane had released a solo recording entitled &quot;Broken Alarm Clock&quot; on the Glasgow Queen Margaret Union NorthPark label compilation &quot;Unplugged&quot;, which he also performed on the BBC television programme &quot;The Beat Room&quot;. Having recently disbanded his latest group Tungsten Crust, McFarlane had been writing songs for a change of direction. He invited O&#x27;Donnell to drum with him and very quickly they blended to create a dynamic new sound. The band had originally been envisaged as a trio, but stayed as a guitar/drums duo after their prospective bass player failed to turn up to their first rehearsal.

After a few months rehearsing and fine-tuning McFarlane&#x27;s original compositions, the duo were invited to open for up-and-coming Glasgow band Lapsus Linguae, by their friend Iain Campbell, for Lapsus&#x27; sold-out New Year&#x27;s Eve gig at King Tut&#x27;s Wah Wah Hut. As a warm-up for this the band played their first ever gig as Sluts of Trust on 17 December 2002 in Starka Bar, Motherwell. The gig at King Tut&#x27;s was a huge success and was seen by established Glasgow rockers Aereogramme, then signed to Chemikal Underground Records, who brought the duo to the label&#x27;s attention. More gigs followed, supporting The Hunches at Nice &#x27;N&#x27; Sleazy and at Bannerman&#x27;s in Edinburgh, where all four members of The Delgados (the Mercury Prize-nominated indie band who owned and ran Chemikal Underground Records) arrived. Sluts of Trust were signed to Chemikal the next week having played only four gigs.

Following the band&#x27;s first UK-wide tour, supporting label-mates Aereogramme, they retreated to Chemikal Underground&#x27;s recording studios, Chem19 in Hamilton to begin work on their debut album with Paul Savage of The Delgados as producer. In November however they took a short break from recording to perform at the London Calling festival at the Paradiso, Amsterdam alongside Franz Ferdinand and The Darkness, before returning to the studio.

===Singles and debut album===
Sluts of Trust released their debut single &quot;Piece O&#x27; You&quot; on 21 November 2003, on limited edition 7-inch red vinyl. Limited to 1000 pressings, the single sold out in a week. The b-side featured live favourite &quot;Meanwhile In Rocksville&quot;. The single was championed by BBC Radio 1 DJ John Peel and would feature at #16 in the end of year chart the Festive Fifty, voted for by listeners to his show. The &quot;Evening Times&quot; called the single &quot;an intense, uncompromising, blistering, screaming, passionate, furious sweat-drenched full-frontal aural assault&quot;. A low-budget video was made to accompany the release and was conceived and directed by actor Johnny Austin and filmmaker Gregor Mackay, both friends of the band from Scottish Youth Theatre. A pastiche of Brian De Palma&#x27;s &quot;Carrie&quot;, it conveyed much of the theatre of early Sluts of Trust gigs, and alongside other members of the Scottish Youth Theatre it starred Sean Biggerstaff and Paul Kelly of The Martial Arts. The video was premiered at the launch of the single in Glasgow&#x27;s Barfly, and projected onto McFarlane&#x27;s own bed-sheet before the band played that night. The video was later screened on MTV2.

With their debut album nearing completion, in early 2004 Sluts of Trust travelled to the BBC&#x27;s Maida Vale Studios in London to record a live session for John Peel&#x27;s show on BBC Radio 1. Peel had become a huge fan of the group since hearing their debut single and some early demo recordings for their album and continued to champion the duo until his untimely death later that year. The band chose to record previously unreleased material from their forthcoming album. The session comprised original McFarlane compositions &quot;The Greatest Gift&quot;, &quot;That&#x27;s Right, That Cat&#x27;s Right&quot; and &quot;Tighter Than The Night&quot;. They also recorded a cover version of Talking Heads&#x27; &quot;Psycho-Killer&quot;. The session was broadcast on 17 February 2004.

Sluts of Trust played their first gig on American soil in March 2004 at the South by Southwest Festival in Austin, Texas, signing a US management deal with Management Music Division while they were there, before embarking on a full-scale US tour with The Delgados and Malcolm Middleton. The band returned to tour the US again within months.

Second single &quot;Leave You Wanting More&quot; was released in April 2004 to great acclaim, with British broadsheet &quot;The Independent&quot; making it their Single of the Week, and describing it as &quot;a sexed-up blast of pounding riffs and art-punk breaks with an amazing amount of textures involved considering they&#x27;re a mere two- piece&quot;. It was described in &quot;The Scotsman&quot; as &quot;sounding simultaneously crazed and precision controlled&quot;. The CD single also included a new McFarlane composition &quot;Crowd Pleaser&quot; along with &quot;Psycho-Killer&quot; from the Peel session. Again an accompanying video was conceived and directed by Johnny Austin and Gregor Mackay. Seen as a companion piece to the &quot;Piece O&#x27; You&quot; video, this was filmed with the RAF veterans of Glasgow&#x27;s Royal Air Force Association club and at Glasgow&#x27;s Museum of Transport, and was again shown on MTV2. The single would be placed at #5 in John Peel&#x27;s posthumous final Festive Fifty.

Sluts of Trust released their debut album &quot;We Are All Sluts of Trust&quot; in Europe on 26 April and the US in May 2004 on Chemikal Underground Records, to positive reviews, but modest sales, selling up to 10,000 copies worldwide. The album was produced by Paul Savage of The Delgados (already known for producing albums by Mogwai and Aereogramme and later for producing Franz Ferdinand&#x27;s third album). In addition to the material the band had been playing live, the album contained a new song titled &quot;Pirate Weekend&quot;. Something of a departure from the band&#x27;s sleazy garage rock, the song featured lush and haunting overdubbed harmonies and would become a fan favourite. To support the album&#x27;s release the duo quickly embarked on another UK tour.

Following a UK tour, the band returned to the United States to promote the album there. The band had been invited to tour with burlesque dance group Suicide Girls and played to large audiences across the USA. The &quot;NME&quot; published an extensive feature on the tour along with pictures from an exclusive photo-shoot of the band with members of Suicide Girls. During a break in the tour Sluts of Trust travelled to Los Angeles to play their own gigs at Amoeba Records, L.A Spaceland, and nightclub The Viper Room.

===Second line-up===
On the duo&#x27;s return to the UK they immediately began touring the country once again, however in November 2004, tired of the relentless touring, drummer Anthony O&#x27;Donnell left the band to concentrate on his writing career in theatre and television. McFarlane moved swiftly to recruit Roo Harris as his replacement. The pair began rehearsing the material from the band&#x27;s debut album, along with some new McFarlane originals in early 2005.

The new line-up of Sluts of Trust played their first official gig at the South By Southwest festival in Austin, Texas in March 2005. It was here that they were introduced to an up-and-coming new London band called Bloc Party. Already fans of the Sluts&#x27; debut album, Bloc Party would prove to be great allies to the band as their own star began to rise. As well as effusing on their love of Sluts of Trust in many interviews, Bloc Party&#x27;s Gordon Moakes was seen to wear a Sluts of Trust T-shirt when the band played Glastonbury, and on the front cover of the &quot;NME&quot;. Bloc Party would also invite Sluts of Trust to support them on a European tour later that year.

In the summer of 2005 Sluts of Trust unveiled their new line-up to the UK at a series of festival appearances. The band played at T in the Park, Musicworks, T on the Fringe and fittingly John Peel Day. Their appearance as part of the Edinburgh Festival featured the Suicide Girls.

In September 2005 Sluts of Trust went back to the studio to record an EP of new material under the supervision of producer Rico. At least three tracks were recorded, &quot;Hit The Game&quot;, &quot;Overcome By Wonder&quot; and &quot;Luvvin&#x27; of Love&quot;. An exclusive video for &quot;Hit The Game&quot; was shot by the BBC for their television programme &quot;The Music Show&quot; and aired following the year, but plans to release the EP were scrapped by McFarlane who was not happy with the material and there has yet to be an official release.

In November 2005 Sluts of Trust embarked on a European tour in support of Bloc Party, playing large arena venues across Spain and Italy.

In January 2006 Sluts of Trust were invited to record a track featuring the work of Scottish poet Robert Burns for BBC Radio&#x27;s &quot;One World&quot; Burns Night Special. McFarlane composed a new track using the Burns poem &quot;Why Should We Idly Waste Our Prime&quot; The session was broadcast on Burns Night World Supper Special on BBC Radio 1.

In the summer of 2006, BBC1&#x27;s music television programme &quot;The Music Show&quot; aired an exclusive video for new Sluts of Trust song &quot;Hit The Game&quot;. The video saw McFarlane and Harris perform the song in a bowling alley. The song has never been given an official release.

Later in the summer of 2006 Chemikal Underground Records released a compilation compact disc and DVD of some of the highlights of the label&#x27;s history entitled CHEM087 CD + DVD. The CD included Sluts of Trust debut single &quot;Piece O&#x27; You&quot;, alongside tracks from The Delgados, Mogwai, Arab Strap and Interpol. The DVD included the videos for singles &quot;Piece O&#x27; You&quot; and &quot;Leave You Wanting More&quot; with an audio commentary from McFarlane and co-director Johnny Austin. To launch the release both videos were screened at Glasgow&#x27;s Centre for Contemporary Arts.

===Recent Appearances===
Since 2007 Sluts of Trust have been seen little. John McFarlane has made a few low-key solo acoustic appearances, performing only entirely new material and is said to be working on a new album.

In early 2008 at a low-key solo gig where he played a full set of new material he announced his intention to return with a new Sluts of Trust album later in the year.

==Musical style==
The band were described by &quot;The Scotsman&quot; as &quot;a seedy 1970s porn baron and his silent but violent henchman playing gutter-trawling, kerb-crawling blues punk with skyscraping vocals and a predilection for the occasional Eddie Van Halen guitar &#x27;lick&#x27;&quot;, also being described as &quot;testosterone-fuelled bluesy punk&quot;.

Craig McLean of the &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; described the band&#x27;s music as &quot;garagey-blues&quot;. The band have been called &quot;a Scots White Stripes&quot;, but with &quot;much more hidden menace&quot;, with songs described as &quot;a mix of Led Zeppelin and 90s American indie&quot;, with their style described as &quot;scuzzy experimental rock&quot;, a &quot;garage metal cacophony&quot;, &quot;aggroglam&quot;, and &quot;sleaze-rock&quot; comprising &quot;manic rigging, high-speed drumming and porno lyrics&quot;.

Andrew Eaton of &quot;The Scotsman&quot; described them as a combination of &quot;the rock&#x27;n&#x27;roll basics of the White Stripes with the showy excess of The Darkness&quot;.

<text>Cattaraugus Creek is a stream, approximately long, in western New York in the United States. The creek drains a wooded rural portion of western New York southwest of Buffalo into Lake Erie. In its lower course it flows primarily through the Cattaraugus Reservation of the Seneca tribe. William Beauchamp identifies the name &quot;Cattaraugus&quot; as deriving from the Seneca word &quot;Gah-ta-ra-ke-ras&quot;, meaning &quot;stinking shore&quot; or &quot;foul-smelling river bank.&quot; This in turn is likely a loanword from an extinct Attiwandiron, Erie, Wenro, or Wendat (Huron) language, combining the verb root -i&#x27;tar-, referring to clay or mud, and -akera(n)-, describing a bad or strong odor: hence, tke&#x27;tarakeras, place of strong-smelling mud or clay. (The Seneca language does not have a distinct R sound; the Seneca language equivalent, Canawaugus, was originally used for a site further east.) This name is a result of the natural gas that oozes from the river mud.

==Description==
The creek rises in Java Lake in Wyoming County. In the village of Arcade it is joined by Clear Creek. It flows westward out of Wyoming County to the hamlet of Yorkshire, where the creek becomes the boundary between Erie County to the north and Cattaraugus County to the south. Near Springville, the creek is impounded by the Scoby Dam. From Springville to Gowanda, Cattaraugus Creek passes through the Zoar Valley Multiple Use Area. This conservation zone is a favorite recreation area for fishing and rafting. The South Branch of Cattaraugus Creek, also known as Skinner Hollow, originates in East Otto and flows southwest into the village of Cattaraugus before veering northwest to Cattaraugus Creek along the Persia-Otto town line, joining the main creek just east of Gowanda, a village that straddles the main stem of the creek and is thereby in two counties. Along its lower course Cattaraugus Creek flows past the hamlet of Versailles, on the south bank of the creek in the Cattaraugus Reservation. For its final miles, the creek forms the border between Erie County and Chautauqua County, then flows into Lake Erie by Sunset Bay in the town of Hanover in Chautauqua County.

==Fishing==
Each year around October to November, thousands of anglers descend on the lower course of Cattaraugus Creek to take advantage of the annual steelhead trout runs.

Currently, the extent of steelhead migration up Cattaraugus Creek is limited by the Scoby Dam near Springville. However, a proposal to lower the currently dam by about was put forth by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in 2014. If approved, the dam&#x27;s lowering and the installation of a fish ladder would allow steelhead to move into an additional of Cattaraugus Creek and its tributaries. The $6.6 million (USD) project would allow anglers to seek steelhead at an additional of public stream access, a large increase over the current of the stream that is currently publicly accessible for fishing below the dam.

The dam&#x27;s removal could also allow Cattaraugus Creek&#x27;s steelhead populations to become more self-sustaining as they gain access to suitable spawning habitats available above the dam. Currently, the steelhead fishery is maintained only through annual stocking of fish.

Critics of the project have raised concerns about impacts on resident brown and rainbow trout populations above the dam, and the possibility of introducing invasive species such as the sea lamprey into stretches of the creek currently free of such organisms. The USACE proposal includes barriers that are intended to restrict the movement of sea lamprey beyond the dam.

==Flooding==
The creek is prone to rapid flooding, and two significant floods hit the creek in 2009 and 2014.

==Environmental issues==
The New York State Department of Environmental Conservation describes Cattaraugus Creek as &quot;one of the healthiest watersheds in the area.&quot; Potential threats to the creek&#x27;s ecosystem include deforestation of the surrounding area, overdevelopment of the Zoar Valley, and invasive species.

===Nuclear waste===
Nuclear waste has contaminated Cattaraugus Creek and other areas around West Valley, New York. Although almost all of the high-level nuclear waste has been removed, according to the Department of Energy (DOE), nuclear and hazardous wastes are still buried in unlined trenches on two sites at a former privately operated nuclear fuel reprocessing facility alongside Cattaraugus Creek north of the village of West Valley in Cattaraugus County. The DOE&#x27;s Demonstration Project at the site transferred high-level nuclear waste into glass canisters. Reprocessing of spent fuel rods from military and civilian nuclear power plants between 1966 and 1972 resulted in burial of low-level radioactive waste (LLNW) on and burial of high-level radioactive waste on another there.

The facility that created the nuclear waste there closed in 1972, and was begun in 1961 by Nuclear Fuel Services (NFS), a subsidiary of W.R. Grace &amp; Co. (the focus of the book and film &quot;A Civil Action&quot;) and American Machine &amp; Foundry, on of land leased from the State of New York. The Atomic Energy Commission reported in 1966 that of liquid radioactive wastes were discharged into on-site streams and Cattaraugus Creek, into which on-site streams flow. These activities were authorized by the State of New York, title owner of the entire site through its agency, the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA,) and by the federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), successor to the Atomic Energy Commission. NYSERDA holds a license from the NRC, which has ultimate jurisdiction over high-level nuclear wastes.

Getty Oil took over the site in the 1970s and continued receiving nuclear fuel rods and dumping nuclear waste there until 1976 when, after numerous releases to the ground and atmosphere, public concern over contamination led the DEC to withdraw its permit for discharges into Buttermilk Creek. This, together with more stringent federal regulations and greater economic competition for nuclear waste disposal led NFS to shut the plant down, leaving New York State with the property. Although cleanup of some high-level nuclear wastes began in the 1990s and continues at what is now known as the West Valley Demonstration Project, regarding LLNW, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission has stated, &quot;There is no intent to recover the wastes once they are buried.&quot;

<text>Johan Torkel Håstad (; born 19 November 1960) is a Swedish theoretical computer scientist most known for his work on computational complexity theory. He was the recipient of the Gödel Prize in 1994 and 2011 and the ACM Doctoral Dissertation Award in 1986, among other prizes. He has been a professor in theoretical computer science at KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm, Sweden since 1988, becoming a full professor in 1992. He is a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences since 2001.

He received his B.S. in Mathematics at Stockholm University in 1981, his M.S. in Mathematics at Uppsala University in 1984 and his Ph.D. in Mathematics from MIT in 1986.

Håstad&#x27;s thesis and 1994 Gödel Prize concerned his work on lower bounds on the size of constant-depth Boolean circuits for the parity function. After Andrew Yao proved that such circuits require exponential size, Håstad proved nearly optimal lower bounds on the necessary size through his switching lemma, which became an important technical tool in circuit complexity with applications to learnability, the IP hierarchy, and proof systems.

He also received the 2011 Gödel Prize for his work on optimal inapproximability results. In particular, he improved the PCP theorem (which won the same prize in 2001) to give a probabilistic verifier for NP problems which reads only three bits. Further, he used these results to prove results in hardness of approximation.

In 1998 Håstad was an Invited Speaker of the International Congress of Mathematicians in Berlin. In 1999 he was an Erdős Lecturer at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. In 2012, he became a fellow of the American Mathematical Society. He was elected as an ACM Fellow in 2018 for &quot;contributions in circuit complexity, approximability and inapproximability, and foundations of pseudorandomness&quot;.

In 2018 he received the Knuth Prize &quot;for his long and sustained record of milestone
breakthroughs at the foundations of computer science, with huge impact on
many areas including optimization, cryptography, parallel computing, and complexity theory.&quot;

In November 1997, Khorkina caused a scandal by posing for the Russian edition of Playboy. She said, &quot;I changed people&#x27;s attitudes. It&#x27;s very good to be sexy. My career made it clear that tall girls can do incredible things. I opened the way. Now I&#x27;m famous all over the world&quot;.

In May 1998, Khorkina competed at the European Championships in St. Petersburg, Russia. She helped the Russian team finish second and individually she won the all around final with a score of 38.624. In event finals, she placed first on uneven bars scoring 9.900 and first on floor scoring 9.787.

==== Sydney Olympics (2000) ====
In September, Khorkina competed at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, Australia. In qualifications, the Russian team placed first and individually Khorkina placed first in the all around with a score of 39.005. She also qualified for the vault, uneven bars, and floor event finals. In the team final, Khorkina contributed an all-around score of 38.261 toward the Russian team&#x27;s second-place finish.

In the all around final, Khorkina placed tenth with a score of 37.929. During the final the vault was set five centimeters lower than it should have been, causing many gymnasts, including Khorkina, to fall. Subsequently, she fell on the uneven bars for unrelated reasons. In the third rotation the vault height was corrected. The gymnasts who had already vaulted were invited to vault again, but Khorkina refused, knowing that it would not put her in medal contention.

In the event finals, Khorkina gave up her spot in the vault final to teammate, Elena Zamolodchikova, who went on to win the gold medal. Khorkina said, &quot;I thought she could win the gold. I&#x27;m glad I could give her that opportunity.&quot; She then won the uneven bars final with a score of 9.862. She became the second gymnast to win the event in two consecutive Olympic games after Polina Astakhova who won in 1960 and 1964. Commenting on the all-around final, Khorkina said, &quot;If I didn&#x27;t get over the disappointment, I wouldn&#x27;t be Khorkina. I wouldn&#x27;t be standing here with the gold medal. It still hurts a lot. It was cruel to all the participants, to vault on a nonstandard height. It&#x27;s quite possible to get killed. The five centimeters could decide the future of a sportsperson. But I was fortunate to have many people to help me get through it. Tomorrow, I will dance for Russia. I will leave what happened on the vault far behind me, like the North Pole.&quot; She then won the silver medal in the floor final with a score of 9.812.

=== 2001–2004 ===
In September 2001, Khorkina captured the gold medal on the uneven bars in the 2001 Goodwill Games. In October 2001, she competed at the World Championships in Ghent, Belgium.

==== Athens Olympics (2004) ====
In August, Khorkina competed at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece. In the team final, she contributed an all around score of 38.062 toward the Russian team&#x27;s third-place finish. In the all around final, she won the silver medal with a score of 38.211.

However, she placed eighth in the uneven bars final with a score of 8.925 after turning late on a pirouette and coming off the apparatus. This meant that she failed to defend her two-time Olympic uneven bars title from the 1996 and 2000 Summer Olympics with the title going to Émilie Le Pennec of France instead.

==Eponymous skills==
Khorkina has four eponymous skills that are currently listed in the Code of Points (CoP). Prior to the 2022–2024 quad, she held the record of having the most eponyms at nine before some easier ones were removed as part of CoP&#x27;s regular update.

== Personal life ==
Svetlana Khorkina was born on 19 January 1979, the daughter of Vasiliy and Lyubov. She has a younger sister, Yulia, who was also a gymnast. Khorkina said, &quot;As a child, I was very picky with my food. My mother hoped, that if she puts me into gymnastics, I would start eating breakfast without frowning, after having spent a lot of energy in the gym. This is how, by simple nutritional reasons, I started my gymnastics career at the age of four.&quot;

At 5&#x27;5&quot;, most people thought that Khorkina was too tall to be an artistic gymnast. However, her coach, Boris Pilkin, saw her potential and created alternative training methods and skills to accommodate her taller body. Khorkina has more skills named after her in the Code of Points than any other gymnast.

Khorkina was known for her dramatic and opinionated personality, often being called a diva. She said, &quot;I wouldn&#x27;t have been called a diva or a queen if I wasn&#x27;t creative. My costume and make-up were always important to me. When people come to see gymnastics they want a performance, not just a sport. I have a talent. I have accomplished so much in sport it will take dozens of years before anyone else achieves as much&quot;.

After retiring from gymnastics, in December 2005 Khorkina was named vice-president of the Russian Artistic Gymnastics Federation. In 2008, she was a commentator for the Beijing Olympics&#x27; gymnastics competition for the Russian TV station NTV+ and released her autobiography entitled, &quot;Somersaults in High Heels&quot; published by Olma-Press She was also an ambassador for the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia. Khorkina has been a member of the political party of United Russia since 2003. She was elected as a deputy for the Russian State Duma in 2007 and served until 2011.

In July 2005, Khorkina gave birth to a son, Svyatoslav Khorkin, at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, United States. The father was later revealed to be businessman Kirill Shubsky, who was married to actress and film director Vera Glagoleva. In April 2011, Khorkina married Oleg Kochnev. Khorkina and Kochnev have a son, Ivan, born in October 2019.

==Political views==
In March 2022, during the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Khorkina posted an image of the &#x27;Z&#x27; military symbol which is commonly used by Russian invading forces in Ukraine, with the comment, &quot;A campaign for those who are not ashamed of being Russian. Let&#x27;s spread it!&quot;

<doc id="908649" wikidata="Q141966" url="?curid=908649" title="Canada at the 2004 Summer Olympics">
<text>Canada competed at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece, from 13 to 29 August 2004. Canadian athletes have competed in every Summer Olympic Games since 1900, except the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow because of the country&#x27;s support for the US-led boycott.

The Canadian Olympic Committee sent a total of 263 athletes, 130 men and 133 women, to take part in 28 sports. This was the nation&#x27;s smallest delegation to the Games, since the nation boycotted the games in 1980. This had become a result of the COC changing its qualification standards, after a reduced medal showing at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, with the aim of sending fewer athletes but focusing its energy on those who have the best chance at winning medals. It has been suggested that the &quot;logical response&quot; of winning fewer medals was diverting funding away from sports where Canadians struggled (track and field) to ones where Canadians excelled (kayak and diving). Athletes that qualified for the Olympics would not be sent to Athens unless they had finished in the top twelve worldwide, a policy that was widely criticized as numerous Canadian Olympic medallists in past Games would have been excluded by such criteria. Over 50 Canadian athletes, including two-time Olympian marathoner Bruce Deacon, did not make the COC&#x27;s &quot;top 12&quot; cutoff despite achieved the international qualifying standards in their respective sports. After 2004 the COC scrapped this policy but still maintains additional hurdles beyond international standards to ensure that athletes are in shape for the Olympics.

Canada left Athens with a total of 12 medals (3 golds, 6 silver, and 3 bronze), the lowest in Summer Olympic history since 1988. Canada&#x27;s overall medal count had been dropping in the recent editions of the Summer Olympics, along with the totals for most developed countries as the developing nations capture comparatively more medals. Many expected Canada to win a similar number of medals as they did in 2000. Most of these medals were awarded to the athletes in canoeing, cycling, diving, and gymnastics. Sprint kayaker Adam van Koeverden became the most decorated athlete of the Games with two Olympic medals, including a gold in the men&#x27;s K-1 500 m.

The flag bearer was two-time Olympic medallist Nicolas Gill, a judoka. A mild controversy developed after it was revealed that Gill had made comments in favour of Quebec separatism, and had voted yes in the 1995 Quebec referendum. Gill went on to lose his opening match and was eliminated from the tournament, which was seen as symbolic of Canada&#x27;s 2004 Olympic woes.

==Archery ==

Two Canadian archers qualified each for the men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s individual archery.

;Men
==Athletics ==

Canadian athletes have so far achieved qualifying standards in the following athletics events (up to a maximum of 3 athletes in each event at the &#x27;A&#x27; Standard, and 1 at the &#x27;B&#x27; Standard). The team was selected based on the results of the 2004 Canadian Olympic Trials.

Canada&#x27;s baseball team did very well in the initial stages of the round-robin winning their four first games. Despite losses to Japan and Cuba, they rebounded in their final game vs. Australia. Most notable has been the performance of second baseman Richard &quot;Stubby&quot; Clapp.

With a 5-2 record in the preliminary round, Canada finished in 3rd position, behind Japan and Cuba and ahead of Australia. In the semi-finals on August 24, Canada lost 8-5 to Cuba. Canada was leading Cuba 3-2 going into the bottom of the eighth inning but then gave up 6 runs. The game ended in dramatic fashion when Canadian Kevin Nicholson almost hit a game tying homer in the 9th. However, a heavy wind was blowing in from left field that night, which caused the ball to come down inches from the wall and was caught. Japan lost 1-0 to Australia in a surprising result in the other semifinal, almost ruining Canada&#x27;s hopes for a medal in Baseball, which would later prove true as Canada lost to Japan on August 25 in the Bronze medal game, thereby finishing fourth.

==Boxing ==

Boxing had witnessed much controversy over the COC higher qualifying standards. After an appeal it was decided that three more boxers could go to Athens. Canada&#x27;s most notable success was Benoit Gaudet defeat of Thai former champion Somluck Kamsing and Andrew Kooner who made it to the quarter-final in the Bantamweight class.

Prior to 2004, Canada had never won an Olympic medal in artistic gymnastics, and hopes for a first seemed to be dashed when the main medal threat, double World Championships bronze medallist Kyle Shewfelt suffered an ankle injury in March. By the Games, though, Shewfelt&#x27;s injury had healed to the point where it did not adversely affect his performance.

==Modern pentathlon==

Two Canadian athletes qualified to compete in the modern pentathlon event.

==Rowing==

Canada&#x27;s most heralded team going into Athens was its rowers, and there was considerable hope for success by Canadians with expectations of three medals or more. While the Canadians did well, with a number of finals appearances, only one group won medals the men&#x27;s fours of Cam Baerg, Jake Wetzel, Thomas Herschmiller and Barney Williams won the silver medal in the men&#x27;s four rowing final, losing to Great Britain by only 0.08 seconds.

Most disappointing was the men&#x27;s eights who had been undefeated for two years before the Olympics, but to the surprise of many finished fifth in their event.

Controversy broke out over the rowing team of Dave Calder and Chris Jarvis who were disqualified from the men&#x27;s pairs semifinal race for entering another team&#x27;s lane, and thus failed to qualify for the final. The COC appealed the decision, but it was upheld.

;Team Roster
;Preliminary round



==Swimming==

For the first time in decades Canada did not win a single medal in swimming. This led to calls for the resignation of head coach Dave Johnson by a number of former swimmers, most notably Barcelona gold medallist Mark Tewksbury. Swim Canada focused on personal bests rather than medals, but even by that measure Canada fared poorly. This lack of medals also stood in sharp contrast to Canada&#x27;s sibling dominion Australia which won many medals in swimming, as they did in Sydney. There were a few bright spots, including Rick Say making it to the finals of the 200 m freestyle, considered by many to be the premier event of the 2004 Olympics, and a number of Canadian records were set. Generally though, performances by the swim team were slower than the times they had swum at Canadian Olympic trials 2 weeks before.

Rick Say created a minor controversy after the 4×200-metre freestyle relay immediately in the post-race interview which was aired live on national television, when he said that he was &quot;pissed off at not being able to make up for my teammates&#x27; mistakes&quot;. The other three team members - Brent Hayden, Brian Johns, and Andrew Hurd - expressed disappointment not in the effort, which broke the Canadian record by over 3.5 seconds, but only in the 5th-place finish which was out of the medals.

;Men
;Women
==Synchronized swimming==

Nine Canadian synchronized swimmers qualified a spot in the women&#x27;s team.

==Table tennis==

Four Canadian table tennis players qualified for the following events.

==Taekwondo==

Two Canadian taekwondo jin qualified for the following events.

==Tennis==

Canadian Tennis Association nominated two male tennis players to compete in the tennis tournament.

==Triathlon==

Canada had a strong triathlon program, including the defending men&#x27;s gold medallist Simon Whitfield, who won surprisingly in Sydney. The women&#x27;s race was something of a disappointment, as top-ranked Canadian Jill Savege, who came out of the water in fifth place, crashed in the bicycle stage and only finished 39th. The two other Canadian women did not fare much better. In the men&#x27;s triathlon a day later Whitfield finished a respectable 11th.

==Volleyball==
===Beach===

==Water polo ==

Canada&#x27;s women&#x27;s water polo team fared poorly, despite beating the number one ranked team from the United States during the round robin. Losing the other two games in the preliminary round put Canada in last place in the pool and eliminated the team from medal contention. They would end up finishing seventh.

==Media coverage==
The main network for Olympic coverage in Canada is the CBC which covers events live, and then replays highlights in prime time. Both the French and English CBC and Radio-Canada are covering different events. The cable channels TSN &amp; RDS won the rights to broadcast some parts of the games, mostly team sports that CBC and Radio-Canada decided not to cover. The digital channel CBC Country Canada, only available to a minority of Canadians, covered equestrian events.

==National outfits==
Roots Canada was the official outfitter of clothing for members of the Canadian Olympic team. The same clothing was also sold at Roots stores in Canada. This was the last year for Roots, thereafter HBC was given the contract for official Olympic clothing.

<doc id="908653" wikidata="Q3113246" url="?curid=908653" title="Graham Fellows">
<text>Graham David Fellows (born 22 May 1959) is an English actor and musician. He first came to public attention when he released the 1978 single &quot;Jilted John&quot; - a track which mocked the punk-rock vocal stylings of the time. The single reached #4 in the UK Singles Chart. Fellows subsequently created the comedic character John Shuttleworth in 1986 and enjoyed success again with his BBC Radio Four radio series, &quot;The Shuttleworths&quot;.

==Jilted John==
Fellows was a drama student at Manchester Polytechnic when he first came to prominence in August 1978 as the eponymous singer of the novelty record &quot;Jilted John&quot;, a first-person narrative of a boorish, bitter teenager whose girlfriend Julie had left him for another boy named Gordon, &quot;just &#x27;cause he&#x27;s better lookin&#x27; than me, just &#x27;cause he&#x27;s cool and trendy&quot;. The song became known for the refrain &quot;Gordon is a moron&quot; repeated several times.

Fellows later said: &quot;I&#x27;d written a couple of songs and I wanted to record them. So I went into a local record shop and asked if they knew any indie or punk labels. They said there were two, Stiff in London and Rabid just down the road. So I phoned Rabid up, and they told me to send in a demo. We did the demos with the late Colin Goddard – of Walter &amp; the Softies – on guitar, and the drummer and bass player of the Smirks. I took it along to Rabid, who loved it ... so we re-recorded it a few days later, at Pennine Studios, with John Scott playing guitar and bass and Martin Zero (aka Martin Hannett) producing.&quot; The single, issued by Rabid in April 1978 (TOSH 105), featured &quot;Going Steady&quot; as the A-side and &quot;Jilted John&quot; as the B-side.

&quot;Jilted John&quot; was first played on national radio by BBC Radio One&#x27;s John Peel, who apparently commented that if the single was promoted by a major record label he could see it becoming a huge hit. This proved to be the case when it was picked up by EMI International. The song was introduced by Kid Jensen on &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; as &quot;one of the most bizarre singles of the decade&quot;, and reached number 4 in the UK Singles Chart.

Two follow-up singles were released the same year under the guise of &quot;Gordon the Moron&quot;. A pseudo concept-album also produced by Hannett followed, entitled &quot;True Love Stories&quot;, charting John&#x27;s love-life – and two further singles, neither of which was a hit. No other recordings followed these, making Jilted John a one-hit wonder. However, a cash-in single by Julie and Gordon called &quot;Gordon&#x27;s Not A Moron&quot; sold moderately well, as did lapel badges bearing the legends &quot;Gordon is a moron&quot; and &quot;Gordon is not a moron&quot;.

Fellows revived the Jilted John character at the 2008 Big Chill festival, along with Bernard Kelly, premiering a new song about Keira Knightley&#x27;s ultra-thin figure. In December 2014 Jilted John won the &#x27;One Hit Wonder World Cup&#x27; feature on the BBC Radio 6 Music Steve Lamacq show. In late 2015 it was announced that Fellows would once again revive Jilted John for Rebellion Festival 2016 at the Winter Gardens, Blackpool.

In October 2018, Jilted John embarked on a 40th-anniversary tour of the UK.

==John Shuttleworth==
In 1986 Fellows created John Shuttleworth, a middle-aged, aspiring singer-songwriter from Sheffield, South Yorkshire, with a quiet manner and slightly nerdish tendencies. His musical talents are usually expressed through his Yamaha PSS680 portable keyboard, and his repertoire includes such songs as &quot;Pigeons in Flight&quot; – a song which Shuttleworth attempted to have selected for the Eurovision Song Contest. A spoof documentary about his road to submitting a song for Eurovision, called &quot;Europigeon,&quot; featured such past Eurovision stars as Clodagh Rodgers, Lynsey de Paul, Bruce Welch, Katrina Leskanich (from Katrina and the Waves), Johnny Logan, Cheryl Baker and Brotherhood of Man. He has released a number of albums and singles as John Shuttleworth.

==Other characters==
Two further Fellows creations followed, firstly Brian Appleton, a rock musicologist and media studies lecturer from a college of further education in the Newcastle-under-Lyme area although originally he hails from Selly Oak in Birmingham. His girlfriend Wendy is an aromatherapist, but unfortunately upon qualifying she became allergic to the essential oils she uses. He is convinced that he has been instrumental in helping many rock acts to achieve megastardom and yet received no credit for his efforts, such as being the cause for the gap in &quot;Make Me Smile (Come Up and See Me)&quot; by Steve Harley &amp; Cockney Rebel, inadvertently launching the vocal career of Phil Collins at a failed audition for the lead singer of Genesis after the departure of Peter Gabriel and giving Howard Jones the idea for using a mime artist in the hit &quot;New Song&quot; while working opposite him at a Clingfilm factory in High Wycombe. Brian also claimed to have a significant bearing on the career of the Thompson Twins (for example he inspired the hit &#x27;Love on Your Side&#x27; while directing Alannah Currie towards her hat which he accidentally knocked off her head) and Morrissey (who coincidentally shares the same date of birth as Graham Fellows), who Brian claims was inspired to form The Smiths after hearing Brian&#x27;s own composition &quot;My Turn to be Poorly&quot;.

His newest character is Dave Tordoff, a builder from Goole specialising in &#x27;laser screed&#x27; concrete flooring. He has ambitions to become a popular after dinner speaker, having seen how easy it was for Kevin Keegan. The topic he most enjoys discussing is his accumulated wealth, followed by life on his ranch-style property with wife Mandy and daughter Courtney. Hobbies earmarked for 2007 included falconry.

==Other work==
In 1982 Fellows played Paul McCartney in &quot;Lennon&quot; by Bob Eaton at the Crucible Theatre, Sheffield, directed by Clare Venables. 

Fellows released one more album in 1985 under his own name on Wicked Frog records entitled &quot;Love at the Haçienda,&quot; which was later reissued on Chic Ken in 2005 with four extra tracks. In May 2020 it was released as a limited edition vinyl LP on Firestation Records (FST 179).

In 2000 he appeared as Alan Stephens, a St John Ambulanceman in two episodes of &quot;Time Gentlemen Please&quot;.

Prior to creating Shuttleworth, Fellows appeared in &quot;Coronation Street&quot; as Les Charlton, a young biker chasing the affections of married Gail Platt (then Tilsley). During his fame as Jilted John, Fellows appeared on &quot;Coronation Street&quot; briefly when he met Gail, single at the time, on the street in Manchester. In 2007 he appeared in an episode of ITV&#x27;s &quot;Heartbeat&quot;.

He presented a programme of his favourite poetry and prose on Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;With Great Pleasure&quot; in January 2007.

In July 2009 he read Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;Book of the Week&quot;, &quot;You&#x27;re Coming With Me Lad&quot; by Mike Pannett, a Metropolitan Police officer&#x27;s semi-autobiographical account of his experiences in the North Yorkshire town of Malton.

A one-off UK 7&quot; single was released in 1980 under the band name Going Red – &quot;Some Boys&quot;/&quot;Tune Kevin&#x27;s Strings&quot; – with a picture sleeve depicting Graham in the shower, fully clothed. The band, as credited on the single sleeve, was Graham Fellows (vocals/guitar), Mervin Cloud (guitar/vocals), Russell Giant (percussion) and Francis Charlton (bass guitar). Chris Sievey was also involved, possibly pseudonymously as one of the aforementioned names. The A-side was an uptempo new wave-style rocker, whilst the humorous B-side features fake crowd noises and predictable heavy metal riffing.

Appeared as Dr Persil in &quot;Ideal&quot; (2010) and as Eric Sykes in the BBC Four drama &quot;Hattie&quot; (2010).

Appearing on BBC Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;Midweek&quot; programme on 3 June 2015, Fellows said he had recently converted a disused church on the Orkney island of Rousay into an eco-friendly recording studio and artists&#x27; retreat.

In December 2015 Fellows appeared on BBC One&#x27;s &quot;Celebrity Mastermind&quot; answering questions on Donald Crowhurst, coming third.

Fellows was to embark on a tour as himself in January and February 2018 and said he was working on an album of new material – &quot;Weird Town&quot;.

<text>A dynamometer or &quot;dyno&quot; is a device for simultaneously measuring the torque and rotational speed (RPM) of an engine, motor or other rotating so that its instantaneous power may be calculated, and usually displayed by the dynamometer itself as kW or bhp.

In addition to being used to determine the torque or power characteristics of a machine under test, dynamometers are employed in a number of other roles. In standard emissions testing cycles such as those defined by the United States Environmental Protection Agency, dynamometers are used to provide simulated road loading of either the engine (using an engine dynamometer) or full powertrain (using a chassis dynamometer). Beyond simple power and torque measurements, dynamometers can be used as part of a testbed for a variety of engine development activities, such as the calibration of engine management controllers, detailed investigations into combustion behavior, and tribology.

In the medical terminology, hand-held dynamometers are used for routine screening of grip and hand strength, and the initial and ongoing evaluation of patients with hand trauma or dysfunction. They are also used to measure grip strength in patients where compromise of the cervical nerve roots or peripheral nerves is suspected.

In the rehabilitation, kinesiology, and ergonomics realms, force dynamometers are used for measuring the back, grip, arm, and/or leg strength of athletes, patients, and workers to evaluate physical status, performance, and task demands. Typically the force applied to a lever or through a cable is measured and then converted to a moment of force by multiplying by the perpendicular distance from the force to the axis of the level.

==Principles of operation of torque power (absorbing) dynamometers==
An absorbing dynamometer acts as a load that is driven by the prime mover that is under test (e.g. Pelton wheel). The dynamometer must be able to operate at any speed and load to any level of torque that the test requires.

Absorbing dynamometers are not to be confused with &quot;inertia&quot; dynamometers, which calculate power solely by measuring power required to accelerate a known mass drive roller and provide no variable load to the prime mover.

An absorption dynamometer is usually equipped with some means of measuring the operating torque and speed.

The power absorption unit (PAU) of a dynamometer absorbs the power developed by the prime mover. This power absorbed by the dynamometer is then converted into heat, which generally dissipates into the ambient air or transfers to cooling water that dissipates into the air. Regenerative dynamometers, in which the prime mover drives a DC motor as a generator to create load, make excess DC power and potentially - using a DC/AC inverter - can feed AC power back into the commercial electrical power grid.

Absorption dynamometers can be equipped with two types of control systems to provide different main test types.

===Constant force===
The dynamometer has a &quot;braking&quot; torque regulator - the power absorption unit is configured to provide a set braking force torque load, while the prime mover is configured to operate at whatever throttle opening, fuel delivery rate, or any other variable it is desired to test. The prime mover is then allowed to accelerate the engine through the desired speed or RPM range. Constant force test routines require the PAU to be set slightly torque deficient as referenced to prime mover output to allow some rate of acceleration. Power is calculated based on rotational speed x torque x constant. The constant varies depending on the units used.

===Constant speed===
If the dynamometer has a speed regulator (human or computer), the PAU provides a variable amount of braking force (torque) that is necessary to cause the prime mover to operate at the desired single test speed or RPM. The PAU braking load applied to the prime mover can be manually controlled or determined by a computer. Most systems employ eddy current, oil hydraulic, or DC motor produced loads because of their linear and quick load change abilities.

The power is calculated as the product of angular velocity and torque.

A &quot;motoring dynamometer&quot; acts as a motor that drives the equipment under test. It must be able to drive the equipment at any speed and develop any level of torque that the test requires. In common usage, AC or DC motors are used to drive the equipment or &quot;load&quot; device.

In most dynamometers power (&quot;P&quot;) is not measured directly, but must be calculated from torque (&quot;τ&quot;) and angular velocity (&quot;ω&quot;) values or force (&quot;F&quot;) and linear velocity (&quot;v&quot;):
:formula_1
:or
:formula_2
:where
::&quot;P&quot; is the power in watts
::&quot;τ&quot; is the torque in newton metres
::&quot;ω&quot; is the angular velocity in radians per second
::&quot;F&quot; is the force in newtons
::&quot;v&quot; is the linear velocity in metres per second

Division by a conversion constant may be required, depending on the units of measure used.

For imperial or U.S. customary units,
:formula_3
:where
::&quot;P&quot;hp is the power in horsepower
::&quot;τ&quot;lb·ft is the torque in pound-feet
::&quot;ω&quot;RPM is the rotational velocity in revolutions per minute

For metric units,
:formula_4
:where
::&quot;P&quot;W is the power in Watts (W)
::&quot;τ&quot;N·m is the torque in Newton metres (Nm)
::&quot;ω&quot; is the rotational velocity in radians/second (rad/s)
::&quot;ω = ωRPM . π / 30  &quot;

==Detailed dynamometer description==
A dynamometer consists of an absorption (or absorber/driver) unit, and usually includes a means for measuring torque and rotational speed. An absorption unit consists of some type of rotor in a housing. The rotor is coupled to the engine or other equipment under test and is free to rotate at whatever speed is required for the test. Some means is provided to develop a braking torque between the rotor and housing of the dynamometer. The means for developing torque can be frictional, hydraulic, electromagnetic, or otherwise, according to the type of absorption/driver unit.

One means for measuring torque is to mount the dynamometer housing so that it is free to turn except as restrained by a torque arm. The housing can be made free to rotate by using trunnions connected to each end of the housing to support it in pedestal-mounted trunnion bearings. The torque arm is connected to the dyno housing and a weighing scale is positioned so that it measures the force exerted by the dyno housing in attempting to rotate. The torque is the force indicated by the scales multiplied by the length of the torque arm measured from the center of the dynamometer. A load cell transducer can be substituted for the scales in order to provide an electrical signal that is proportional to torque.

Another means to measure torque is to connect the engine to the dynamo through a torque sensing coupling or torque transducer. A torque transducer provides an electrical signal that is proportional to the torque.

With electrical absorption units, it is possible to determine torque by measuring the current drawn (or generated) by the absorber/driver. This is generally a less accurate method and not much practiced in modern times, but it may be adequate for some purposes.

When torque and speed signals are available, test data can be transmitted to a data acquisition system rather than being recorded manually. Speed and torque signals can also be recorded by a chart recorder or plotter.

==Types of dynamometers==
In addition to classification as absorption, motoring, or universal, as described above, dynamometers can also be classified in other ways.

A dyno that is coupled directly to an engine is known as an &quot;engine dyno&quot;.

A dyno that can measure torque and power delivered by the power train of a vehicle directly from the drive wheel or wheels without removing the engine from the frame of the vehicle), is known as a &quot;chassis dyno&quot;.

Dynamometers can also be classified by the type of absorption unit or absorber/driver that they use. Some units that are capable of absorption only can be combined with a motor to construct an absorber/driver or &quot;universal&quot; dynamometer.

===Types of absorption units===
* Eddy current (absorption only)
* Magnetic powder brake (absorption only)
* Hysteresis brake (absorption only)
* Electric motor/generator (absorb or drive)
* Fan brake (absorption only)
* Hydraulic brake (absorption only)
* Force lubricated, oil shear friction brake (absorption only)
* Water brake (absorption only)
* Compound dyno (usually an absorption dyno in tandem with an electric/motoring dyno)

===Eddy current type absorber===
Eddy current (EC) dynamometers are currently the most common absorbers used in modern chassis dynos. The EC absorbers provide a quick load change rate for rapid load settling. Most are air cooled, but some are designed to require external water cooling systems.

Eddy current dynamometers require an electrically conductive core, shaft, or disc moving across a magnetic field to produce resistance to movement. Iron is a common material, but copper, aluminum, and other conductive materials are also usable.

In current (2009) applications, most EC brakes use cast iron discs similar to vehicle disc brake rotors, and use variable electromagnets to change the magnetic field strength to control the amount of braking.

The electromagnet voltage is usually controlled by a computer, using changes in the magnetic field to match the power output being applied.

Sophisticated EC systems allow steady state and controlled acceleration rate operation.

===Powder dynamometer===
A powder dynamometer is similar to an eddy current dynamometer, but a fine magnetic powder is placed in the air gap between the rotor and the coil. The resulting flux lines create &quot;chains&quot; of metal particulate that are constantly built and broken apart during rotation, creating great torque. Powder dynamometers are typically limited to lower RPM due to heat dissipation problems.

===Hysteresis dynamometers===
Hysteresis dynamometers use a magnetic rotor, sometimes of AlNiCo alloy, that is moved through flux lines generated between magnetic pole pieces. The magnetisation of the rotor is thus cycled around its B-H characteristic, dissipating energy proportional to the area between the lines of that graph as it does so.

Unlike eddy current brakes, which develop no torque at standstill, the hysteresis brake develops largely constant torque, proportional to its magnetising current (or magnet strength in the case of permanent magnet units) over its entire speed range. Units often incorporate ventilation slots, though some have provision for forced air cooling from an external supply.

Hysteresis and Eddy Current dynamometers are two of the most useful technologies in small ( and less) dynamometers.

===Electric motor/generator dynamometer===
Electric motor/generator dynamometers are a specialized type of adjustable-speed drive. The absorption/driver unit can be either an alternating current (AC) motor or a direct current (DC) motor. Either an AC motor or a DC motor can operate as a generator that is driven by the unit under test or a motor that drives the unit under test. When equipped with appropriate control units, electric motor/generator dynamometers can be configured as universal dynamometers. The control unit for an AC motor is a variable-frequency drive, while the control unit for a DC motor is a DC drive. In both cases, regenerative control units can transfer power from the unit under test to the electric utility. Where permitted, the operator of the dynamometer can receive payment (or credit) from the utility for the returned power via net metering.

In engine testing, universal dynamometers can not only absorb the power of the engine, but can also drive the engine for measuring friction, pumping losses, and other factors.

Electric motor/generator dynamometers are generally more costly and complex than other types of dynamometers.

===Fan brake===
A fan is used to blow air to provide engine load. The torque absorbed by a fan brake may be adjusted by changing the gearing or the fan itself, or by restricting the airflow through the fan. Due to the low viscosity of air, this variety of dynamometer is inherently limited in the amount of torque that it can absorb.

===Force lubricated oil shear brake===
An oil shear brake has a series of friction discs and steel plates similar to the clutches in an automobile automatic transmission. The shaft carrying the friction discs is attached to the load through a coupling. A piston pushes the stack of friction discs and steel plates together creating shear in the oil between the discs and plates applying a torque. Torque can be controlled pneumatically or hydraulically. Force lubrication maintains a film of oil between the surfaces to eliminate wear. Reaction is smooth down to zero RPM without stick-slip. Loads up to hundreds of thermal horsepower can be absorbed through the required force lubrication and cooling unit. Most often, the brake is kinetically grounded through a torque arm anchored by a strain gauge which produces a current under load fed to the dynamometer control. Proportional or servo control valves are generally used to allow the dynamometer control to apply pressure to provide the program torque load with feedback from the strain gauge closing the loop. As torque requirements go up there are speed limitations.

===Hydraulic brake===
The hydraulic brake system consists of a hydraulic pump (usually a gear-type pump), a fluid reservoir, and piping between the two parts. Inserted in the piping is an adjustable valve, and between the pump and the valve is a gauge or other means of measuring hydraulic pressure. In simplest terms, the engine is brought up to the desired RPM and the valve is incrementally closed. As the pumps outlet is restricted, the load increases and the throttle is simply opened until at the desired throttle opening. Unlike most other systems, power is calculated by factoring flow volume (calculated from pump design specifications), hydraulic pressure, and RPM. Brake HP, whether figured with pressure, volume, and RPM, or with a different load cell-type brake dyno, should produce essentially identical power figures. Hydraulic dynos are renowned for having the quickest load change ability, just slightly surpassing eddy current absorbers. The downside is that they require large quantities of hot oil under high pressure and an oil reservoir.

===Water brake-type absorber===
The hydraulic dynamometer (also referred to as the water brake absorber) was invented by British engineer William Froude in 1877 in response to a request by the Admiralty to produce a machine capable of absorbing and measuring the power of large naval engines. Water brake absorbers are relatively common today. They are noted for their high power capability, small size, light weight, and relatively low manufacturing costs as compared to other, quicker reacting, &quot;power absorber&quot; types.

Their drawbacks are that they can take a relatively long period of time to &quot;stabilize&quot; their load amount, and that they require a constant supply of water to the &quot;water brake housing&quot; for cooling. Environmental regulations may prohibit &quot;flow through&quot; water, in which case large water tanks are installed to prevent contaminated water from entering the environment.

The schematic shows the most common type of water brake, known as the &quot;variable level&quot; type. Water is added until the engine is held at a steady RPM against the load, with the water then kept at that level and replaced by constant draining and refilling (which is needed to carry away the heat created by absorbing the horsepower). The housing attempts to rotate in response to the torque produced, but is restrained by the scale or torque metering cell that measures the torque.

===Compound dynamometers===
In most cases, motoring dynamometers are symmetrical; a 300 kW AC dynamometer can absorb 300 kW as well as motor at 300 kW. This is an uncommon requirement in engine testing and development. Sometimes, a more cost-effective solution is to attach a larger absorption dynamometer with a smaller motoring dynamometer. Alternatively, a larger absorption dynamometer and a simple AC or DC motor may be used in a similar manner, with the electric motor only providing motoring power when required (and no absorption). The (cheaper) absorption dynamometer is sized for the maximum required absorption, whereas the motoring dynamometer is sized for motoring. A typical size ratio for common emission test cycles and most engine development is approximately 3:1. Torque measurement is somewhat complicated since there are two machines in tandem - an inline torque transducer is the preferred method of torque measurement in this case. An eddy-current or waterbrake dynamometer, with electronic control combined with a variable frequency drive and AC induction motor, is a commonly used configuration of this type. Disadvantages include requiring a second set of test cell services (electrical power and cooling), and a slightly more complicated control system. Attention must be paid to the transition between motoring and braking in terms of control stability.

==How dynamometers are used for engine testing==
Dynamometers are useful in the development and refinement of modern engine technology. The concept is to use a dyno to measure and compare power transfer at different points on a vehicle, thus allowing the engine or drivetrain to be modified to get more efficient power transfer. For example, if an engine dyno shows that a particular engine achieves of torque, and a chassis dynamo shows only , one would know that the drivetrain losses are nominal. Dynamometers are typically very expensive pieces of equipment, and so are normally used only in certain fields that rely on them for a particular purpose.

==Types of dynamometer systems==

A &#x27;brake&#x27; dynamometer applies variable load on the prime mover (PM) and measures the PM&#x27;s ability to move or hold the RPM as related to the &quot;braking force&quot; applied. It is usually connected to a computer that records applied braking torque and calculates engine power output based on information from a &quot;load cell&quot; or &quot;strain gauge&quot; and a speed sensor.

An &#x27;inertia&#x27; dynamometer provides a fixed inertial mass load, calculates the power required to accelerate that fixed and known mass, and uses a computer to record RPM and acceleration rate to calculate torque. The engine is generally tested from somewhat above idle to its maximum RPM and the output is measured and plotted on a graph.

A &#x27;motoring&#x27; dynamometer provides the features of a brake dyno system, but in addition, can &quot;power&quot; (usually with an AC or DC motor) the PM and allow testing of very small power outputs (for example, duplicating speeds and loads that are experienced when operating a vehicle traveling downhill or during on/off throttle operations).

==Types of dynamometer test procedures==
There are essentially 3 types of dynamometer test procedures:

# Steady state: where the engine is held at a specified RPM (or series of usually sequential RPMs) for a desired amount of time by the variable brake loading as provided by the PAU (power absorber unit). These are performed with brake dynamometers.
# Sweep test: the engine is tested under a load (i.e. inertia or brake loading), but allowed to &quot;sweep&quot; up in RPM, in a continuous fashion, from a specified lower &quot;starting&quot; RPM to a specified &quot;end&quot; RPM. These tests can be done with inertia or brake dynamometers.
# Transient test: usually done with AC or DC dynamometers, the engine power and speed are varied throughout the test cycle. Different test cycles are used in different jurisdictions. Chassis test cycles include the US light-duty UDDS, HWFET, US06, SC03, ECE, EUDC, and CD34, while engine test cycles include ETC, HDDTC, HDGTC, WHTC, WHSC, and ED12.

===Types of sweep tests===
#Inertia sweep: an inertia dyno system provides a fixed inertial mass flywheel and computes the power required to accelerate the flywheel (the load) from the starting to the ending RPM. The actual rotational mass of the engine (or engine and vehicle in the case of a chassis dyno) is not known, and the variability of even the mass of the tires will skew the power results. The inertia value of the flywheel is &quot;fixed&quot;, so low-power engines are under load for a much longer time and internal engine temperatures are usually too high by the end of the test, skewing optimal &quot;dyno&quot; tuning settings away from the optimal tuning settings of the outside world. Conversely, high powered engines commonly complete a &quot;4th gear sweep&quot; test in less than 10 seconds, which is not a reliable load condition as compared to operation in the real world. By not providing enough time under load, internal combustion chamber temperatures are unrealistically low and power readings - especially past the power peak - are skewed to the low side.
#Loaded sweep, of the brake dyno type, includes:
## Simple fixed load sweep: a fixed load - of somewhat less than the output of the engine - is applied during the test. The engine is allowed to accelerate from its starting RPM to its ending RPM, varying at its own acceleration rate, depending on power output at any particular rotational speed. Power is calculated using (rotational speed x torque x constant) + the power required to accelerate the dyno and engine&#x27;s/vehicle&#x27;s rotating mass.
## Controlled acceleration sweep: similar in basic usage as the (above) simple fixed load sweep test, but with the addition of active load control that targets a specific rate of acceleration. Commonly, 20fps/ps is used.
#Controlled acceleration rate: the acceleration rate used is controlled from low power to high power engines, and overextension and contraction of &quot;test duration&quot; is avoided, providing more repeatable tests and tuning results.

In every type of sweep test, there remains the issue of potential power reading error due to the variable engine/dyno/vehicle total rotating mass. Many modern computer-controlled brake dyno systems are capable of deriving that &quot;inertial mass&quot; value, so as to eliminate this error.

A &quot;sweep test&quot; will almost always be suspect, as many &quot;sweep&quot; users ignore the rotating mass factor, preferring to use a blanket &quot;factor&quot; on every test on every engine or vehicle. Simple inertia dyno systems aren&#x27;t capable of deriving &quot;inertial mass&quot;, and thus are forced to use the same (assumed) inertial mass on every vehicle tested.

Using steady state testing eliminates the rotating inertial mass error of a sweep test, as there is no acceleration during this type of test.

===Transient test characteristics===
Aggressive throttle movements, engine speed changes, and engine motoring are characteristics of most transient engine tests. The usual purpose of these tests are vehicle emissions development and homologation. In some cases, the lower-cost eddy-current dynamometer is used to test one of the transient test cycles for early development and calibration. An eddy current dyno system offers fast load response, which allows rapid tracking of speed and load, but does not allow motoring. Since most required transient tests contain a significant amount of motoring operation, a transient test cycle with an eddy-current dyno will generate different emissions test results. Final adjustments are required to be done on a motoring-capable dyno.

===Engine dynamometer===
An engine dynamometer measures power and torque directly from the engine&#x27;s crankshaft (or flywheel), when the engine is removed from the vehicle. These dynos do not account for power losses in the drivetrain, such as the gearbox, transmission, and differential.

===Chassis dynamometer (rolling road)===

A chassis dynamometer, sometimes referred to as a rolling road, measures power delivered to the surface of the &quot;drive roller&quot; by the drive wheels. The vehicle is often strapped down on the roller or rollers, which the car then turns, and the output measured thereby.

Modern roller-type chassis dyno systems use the &quot;Salvisberg roller&quot;, which improves traction and repeatability, as compared to the use of smooth or knurled drive rollers. Chassis dynamometers can be fixed or portable, and can do much more than display RPM, power, and torque. With modern electronics and quick reacting, low inertia dyno systems, it is now possible to tune to best power and the smoothest runs in real time.

Other types of chassis dynamometers are available that eliminate the potential for wheel slippage on old style drive rollers, attaching directly to the vehicle&#x27;s hubs for direct torque measurement from the axle.

Motor vehicle emissions development and homologation dynamometer test systems often integrate emissions sampling, measurement, engine speed and load control, data acquisition, and safety monitoring into a complete test cell system. These test systems usually include complex emissions sampling equipment (such as constant volume samplers and raw exhaust gas sample preparation systems) and analyzers. These analyzers are much more sensitive and much faster than a typical portable exhaust gas analyzer. Response times of well under one second are common, and are required by many transient test cycles. In retail settings it is also common to tune the air-fuel ratio using a wideband oxygen sensor that is graphed along with the RPM.

Integration of the dynamometer control system with automatic calibration tools for engine system calibration is often found in development test cell systems. In these systems, the dynamometer load and engine speed are varied to many engine operating points, while selected engine management parameters are varied and the results recorded automatically. Later analysis of this data may then be used to generate engine calibration data used by the engine management software.

Because of frictional and mechanical losses in the various drivetrain components, the measured wheel brake horsepower is generally 15-20 percent less than the brake horsepower measured at the crankshaft or flywheel on an engine dynamometer.

==History==
The Graham-Desaguliers Dynamometer was invented by George Graham and mentioned in the writings of John Desagulier in 1719. Desaguliers modified the first dynamometers, and so the instrument became known as the Graham-Desaguliers dynamometer.

The Regnier dynamometer was invented and made public in 1798 by Edmé Régnier, a French rifle maker and engineer.

A patent was issued (dated June 1817) to Siebe and Marriot of Fleet Street, London for an improved weighing machine.

Gaspard de Prony invented the de Prony brake in 1821.

Macneill&#x27;s road indicator was invented by John Macneill in the late 1820s, further developing Marriot&#x27;s patented weighing machine.

Froude Ltd, of Worcester, UK, manufactures engine and vehicle dynamometers. They credit William Froude with the invention of the hydraulic dynamometer in 1877, and say that the first commercial dynamometers were produced in 1881 by their predecessor company, Heenan &amp; Froude.

In 1928, the German company &quot;Carl Schenck Eisengießerei &amp; Waagenfabrik&quot; built the first vehicle dynamometers for brake tests that have the basic design of modern vehicle test stands.

The eddy current dynamometer was invented by Martin and Anthony Winther around 1931, but at that time, DC Motor/generator dynamometers had been in use for many years. A company founded by the Winthers brothers, Dynamatic Corporation, manufactured dynamometers in Kenosha, Wisconsin until 2002. Dynamatic was part of Eaton Corporation from 1946 to 1995. In 2002, Dyne Systems of Jackson, Wisconsin acquired the Dynamatic dynamometer product line. Starting in 1938, Heenan &amp; Froude manufactured eddy current dynamometers for many years under license from Dynamatic and Eaton.

<doc id="908659" wikidata="Q5740189" url="?curid=908659" title="Herman Santiago">
<text>Herman Santiago (born February 18, 1941) is a Puerto Rican rock and roll pioneer and songwriter who was previously a member of the vocal group Frankie Lymon and the Teenagers. He (disputedly) co-wrote the group&#x27;s iconic hit &quot;Why Do Fools Fall in Love&quot;.

==Early years==
Santiago was born in San Juan, Puerto Rico and raised in Manhattan, New York. In the early 1950s, Santiago and friends, 2nd tenor Jimmy Merchant, baritone and fellow Puerto Rican Joe Negroni, and bassman Sherman Garnes, would meet in front of Santiago&#x27;s apartment stoop (building stairs) and sing songs to the beat of the Doo-Wop genre. They originally called themselves the &quot;Ermines&quot; and Santiago was their lead singer. On one occasion, the &quot;Ermines&quot; participated in a talent show at PS 143 (Public School 143), at which another group, &quot;The Cadillacs&quot; were guests. After the show, in honor of the &quot;Cadillacs&quot;, they changed their name to the &quot;Coupe de Villes.&quot; This name only lasted a short time and they soon changed it to the &quot;Premiers.&quot;

In 1954, 12-year-old Frankie Lymon, who sang with his brothers Lewis and Howie, was working in a grocery store as a bag boy. He met the &quot;Premiers&quot; backstage at an amateur show and &quot;jammed&quot; with them. Lymon was quickly invited to join them, initially singing first tenor behind Santiago&#x27;s lead. That same year Richard Barrett, a talent scout and producer for Rama Records (and also the lead singer of the &quot;Valentines&quot;), heard them singing and introduced them to George Goldner, the record company&#x27;s owner. Goldner signed them to a contract and changed the group&#x27;s name once more, this time to The Teenagers.

==&quot;Why Do Fools Fall in Love&quot;==
The following day, the group was supposed to meet with Goldner in the studio for a recording session. Santiago had a sore throat and could not sing the lead vocal of the song he had written, &quot;Why Do Fools Fall in Love,&quot; and therefore, gave Negroni the music sheet with the words to the song. Lymon filled in for Santiago, but according to Jimmy Merchant, once the precocious Lymon became an established member of the group, his vocal talent and instinctive stage presence made him the obvious choice to be the group&#x27;s lead vocalist, and Santiago stepped aside.

==Frankie Lymon and the Teenagers==
Goldner released the record, with &quot;Please Be Mine&quot; on the &quot;B&quot; side, under the name &quot;Frankie Lymon and the Teenagers&quot;, on his new &quot;Gee Records&quot; subsidiary, in January 1956. The record became an instant hit in the U.S and the U.K. It also became the first top British hit by an American rock &amp; roll vocal group. Single releases followed at 3-month intervals, the next three, &quot;I Want You to Be My Girl&quot;, &quot;I Promise to Remember&quot;—written by Jimmy Castor—and &quot;The ABC&#x27;s of Love&quot; all making the charts, but at progressively lower positions. &quot;I&#x27;m Not a Juvenile Delinquent&quot; b/w &quot;Share&quot;, and &quot;Out in the Cold Again&quot;, released in early 1957, did not chart. In London, the group played at the Palladium. Alan Freed, a former American disc-jockey who became internationally known for promoting African-American rhythm and blues music, signed them for two movies, &quot;Rock, Rock, Rock&quot; and &quot;Mr. Rock and Roll&quot;.

==Lymon goes solo==

In 1957, Lymon left &quot;the Teenagers&quot; permanently and went solo. The rest of the group continued touring and producing records without him until 1961, recruiting various lead singers, never achieving their previous commercial success. After the group dissolved, Santiago and the other members took regular jobs.

The surviving members of the group reunited in the 1970s, with Pearl McKinnon of the Kodaks (who sounds remarkably like Lymon) singing lead for a time. Garnes died from a heart attack in 1977 and Negroni from a cerebral hemorrhage on September 5, 1978. Santiago and Merchant continued on with various new members including most notably Jimmy Castor, Lewis Lymon (Frankie&#x27;s brother), and Timothy Wilson of Tiny Tim &amp; the Hits, their most recent lead singer. As of 2005, Jimmy Merchant has retired.

==Controversy==
In 1981, Diana Ross recorded a new version of &quot;Why Do Fools Fall in Love&quot;, which again became a hit and the royalties on the song passed over a million dollars.

In 1986, three women, each claiming to be Lymon&#x27;s widow, filed a lawsuit in New York&#x27;s Superior Court claiming the rights to the song. It was revealed that Goldner conned &quot;the Teenagers&quot; into signing a contract which was not valid by law and that the song was in fact written by Herman Santiago and that he (Goldner) had received all of the royalties and that Santiago never received a cent as author of the song; the Court then ruled that none of the widows were entitled to the rights of the song.

In December 1992, the U.S. federal court ruled that the rights to the song belonged to Herman Santiago and that Jimmy Merchant and Emira Lymon (the true widow) were also entitled to receive royalties dating back to 1969. Herman Santiago was by now homeless and living in a car when he received the news and soon went from being homeless to becoming a millionaire.

However, in 1996 the ruling was reversed by the Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit (on the basis of the statute of limitations), and authorship of &quot;Why Do Fools Fall in Love&quot; currently remains solely in the names of Frankie Lymon and music publisher Morris Levy. The song is currently owned by EMI Music Publishing.

==Hall of Fame==
In 1993, the original members of &quot;the Teenagers&quot;—Herman Santiago, Frankie Lymon, Sherman Garnes, Joe Negroni and Jimmy Merchant—were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and in 2000 into the Vocal Group Hall of Fame. In the 1998 film &quot;Why Do Fools Fall in Love&quot;, the role of Santiago was played by actor Alexis Cruz.

<text>The German system (; literally &quot;compartment&quot; or &quot;subject of study&quot;, here in the sense of &quot;vocal specialization&quot;) is a method of classifying singers, primarily opera singers, according to the range, weight, and color of their voices. It is used worldwide, but primarily in Europe, especially in German-speaking countries and by repertory opera houses.

The &#x27; system is a convenience for singers and opera houses. It prevents singers from being asked to sing roles which they are incapable of performing, or roles for which their vocal timbre is dramatically unsuited. Opera companies keep lists of available singers by&#x27; so that when they are casting roles for an upcoming production, they do not inadvertently contact performers who would be inappropriate for the part.

Below is a list of &#x27; (), their ranges as written on [[sheet music]], and roles generally considered appropriate to each. When two names for the&#x27; are given, the first is in more common use today. Where possible, an English and/or Italian equivalent of each &#x27; is listed; however, not all&#x27; have ready English or Italian equivalents. Note that some roles can be sung by more than one &#x27; and that many singers do not easily fit into a&#x27;: for instance some sopranos may sing both &#x27; and&#x27; roles. In addition, roles traditionally more difficult to cast may be given to a voice other than the traditional &quot;&quot;. For instance, the &quot;Queen of the Night&quot; and &quot;Violetta&quot; are more traditionally dramatic coloratura roles, but it is difficult to find a dramatic coloratura to sing it (particularly given the extreme range). Therefore, these roles are often sung by a lyric coloratura.

== Soprano &quot;&quot; ==

* English equivalent: coloratura soprano or lyric coloratura soprano
* Range: From about middle C (C4) to the F two-and-a-half octaves above middle C (F6)
* Description: Usually (but not always) a light soprano who has a high voice. Can often have small voices lacking the richness and resonance of a dramatic soprano. Must be able to do fast acrobatics with easy high notes. Many have extremely high ranges (with notes above the F of the &quot;Queen of the Night&quot;), but there are also singers in this &quot;&quot; who do not regularly sing higher than the high E6.
* Roles:
** Adina, &quot;L&#x27;elisir d&#x27;amore&quot; (Gaetano Donizetti)
** Aminta, &quot;Die schweigsame Frau&quot; (Richard Strauss)
** Blonde, &quot;Die Entführung aus dem Serail&quot; (Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart)
** Cunegonde, &quot;Candide&quot; (Leonard Bernstein)
** Frasquita, &quot;Carmen&quot; (Bizet)
** Juliette, &quot;Roméo et Juliette&quot; (Gounod)
** Marie, &quot;La fille du régiment&quot; (Gaetano Donizetti)
** Olympia, &quot;Les contes d&#x27;Hoffman&quot; (Jacques Offenbach)
** Oscar, &quot;Un ballo in maschera&quot; (Giuseppe Verdi)
** Zerbinetta, &quot;Ariadne auf Naxos&quot; (Richard Strauss)
** The woodbird, &quot;Siegfried&quot; (Richard Wagner)

*English equivalent: Dramatic coloratura soprano
*Range: From about middle C (C4) to the F two and a half octaves above middle C (F6)
*Description: The same as above, only with a more dramatic, rich voice. Often heavier and more lyrical than a coloratura soprano. Must also be able to do fast vocal acrobatics and reach high notes, such as the F6 of the &quot;Queen of the Night&quot;.
*Roles:
**Abigalle, &quot;Nabucco&quot; (Giuseppe Verdi)
**Donna Anna, &quot;Don Giovanni&quot; (Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart)
**Elvira, &quot;I puritani&quot; (Vincenzo Bellini)
**Fiordiligi, &quot;Così fan tutte&quot; (Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart)
** Gilda, &quot;Rigoletto&quot; (Giuseppe Verdi)
**Konstanze, &quot;Die Entführung aus dem Serail&quot; (Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart)
**Leonora, &quot;Il trovatore&quot; (Giuseppe Verdi)
**Norma, &quot;Norma&quot; (Vincenzo Bellini)
**Odabella, &quot;Attila&quot; (Giuseppe Verdi)
**The Queen of the Night, &quot;Die Zauberflöte&quot; (Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart)
**Violetta, &quot;La traviata&quot; (Giuseppe Verdi)
One must not mistake the Mozartian dramatic coloratura soprano with the Italian dramatic coloratura soprano. A singer that sings Konstanze, Donna Anna or Fiordiligi can not necessarily sing the Italian dramatic coloratura parts, due to other vocal demands. Imogene, Leonora and Violetta require a dramatic soprano voice and are most often sung by dramatic sopranos with an agile voice that can easily produce coloratura and high notes. Roles like Norma, Lady Macbeth, Odabella or Abigaille are good examples of Italian roles that are not necessarily a coloratura soprano (even though the score calls for coloratura singing), but a full bodied dramatic soprano with a voice that can handle extreme dramatic singing and that is flexible enough to sing coloratura. Giuseppe Verdi wrote many parts like this in his early years.

* English equivalent: Soubrette
* Range: From about middle C (C4) to the C two octaves above middle C (C6)
* Description: A beautiful, sweet light lyric voice usually capable of executing florid passages similarly to that of a coloratura. The range is usually intermediate between that of a coloratura and lyric soprano. Most sopranos start out as soubrettes, changing fach as the voice matures.
* Roles: 
** Adele, &quot;Die Fledermaus&quot; (J. Strauss II) 
** Barbarina, &quot;Le nozze di Figaro&quot; (Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart)
** Clotilde, &quot;Norma&quot; (Vincenzo Bellini)
** Despina, &quot;Così fan tutte&quot; (Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart)
** Echo, &quot;Ariadne auf Naxos&quot; (Richard Strauss)

** Sophie, &quot;Der Rosenkavalier&quot; (Richard Strauss)
** Susanna, &quot;Le nozze di Figaro&quot; (Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart)
** Zerlina, &quot;Don Giovanni&quot; (Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart)

* English equivalent: lyric soprano
* Range: From about B below middle C (B3) to the C two octaves above middle C (C6)
* Description: A more supple soprano, capable of legato, portamento, and some agility; generally has a more soulful and sensuous quality than a soubrette, who tends to be largely flirtatious and somewhat tweety. The voice is very common; thus the purity and character of the basic timbre is essential. It is the &quot;basic&quot; soprano voice which is at neither extremes of the soprano range of voices; it is not known for having particular vocal attributes such as power, stamina, technical prowess, or agility. However, there are several lyric sopranos that possess a quantity of many of these vocal attributes, thus allowing them to sing a broader variety of roles. Nevertheless, the core of the true fundamentally lyric voice does not encompass such traits. Innocence, vulnerability and pathos are usually conveyed in the music written for the characters portrayed by the lyric soprano because of this endearing simplicity. This fach is also famous because the voices usually remain especially fresh until advanced age.
* Roles:
** Antonia, &quot;Les contes d&#x27;Hoffman&quot; (Jacques Offenbach)
** Gretel, &quot;Hänsel und Gretel&quot; (Engelbert Humperdinck)
** Lauretta, &quot;Gianni Schicchi &quot; (Giacomo Puccini)
** Liù, &quot;Turandot&quot; (Giacomo Puccini)

** Sophie, &quot;Werther&quot; (Jules Massenet)
** Susanna, &quot;Le nozze di Figaro&quot; (Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart)
** Mimi, &quot;La bohème&quot; (Giacomo Puccini)

* English equivalent: spinto soprano
* Range: From about A below middle C (A3) to the C two octaves above middle C (C6)
* Description: The Italian version of this fach is the &quot;spinto&quot;, which literally translated means pushed. However this is not accurate in terms of these singers&#x27; vocal production. A lyric dramatic soprano has a lyric instrument that can also create big sounds, cutting through an orchestral or choral climax. This voice is sometimes referred to as a &quot;young&quot; or &quot;youthful&quot; dramatic soprano although this term doesn&#x27;t necessarily refer to the singer&#x27;s age but rather to the tonal quality of the voice. This fach is more clearly delineated in the German system than in the American system. Depending on the singer, however, this voice type can be versatile, as it lies at neither extreme of the soprano spectrum. Spintos are occasionally able to take on lighter mezzo roles or conversely, lyric and even coloratura roles.
* Roles:
** Agathe, &quot;Der Freischütz&quot; (Carl Maria von Weber)
** Amelia, &quot;Un ballo in maschera&quot; (Giuseppe Verdi)

** Salome,&quot;Salome&quot; (Richard Strauss)

* English equivalent: full dramatic soprano
* Range: From about the A below middle C (A3) to the C two octaves above middle C (C6)
* Description: Characterized by their rich, full sounding voices, dramatic sopranos are expected to project across large orchestras, a feat that requires a powerful sound. Dramatic sopranos are not expected to have the vocal flexibility of the lighter &quot;&quot;. Although most dramatic sopranos have a darker, more robust quality to the voice, there are some that possess a lighter lyrical tone. In these instances, however, the substantial amount of volume and endurance normally associated with the dramatic soprano voice is still present. The darker voiced dramatic soprano may even make a foray into the dramatic mezzo-soprano territory with great success.
* Roles:
** Ariadne, &quot;Ariadne auf Naxos&quot; (Richard Strauss)
** Cassandre, &quot;Les Troyens&quot; (Hector Berlioz)
** La Gioconda, &quot;La Gioconda&quot; (Amilcare Ponchielli)

** Santuzza, &quot;Cavalleria rusticana&quot; (Pietro Mascagni)
** Sieglinde, &quot;Die Walküre&quot; (Wagner)
** Tosca, &quot;Tosca&quot; (Giacomo Puccini)

* English equivalent: High dramatic soprano
* Range: From about the F below middle C (F3) to the C two octaves above middle C (C6)
* Description: A voice capable of answering the demands of operas of Wagner&#x27;s maturity. The voice is substantial, very powerful, and even throughout the registers. It is immense, stentorian and even larger than the voice of the &quot;normal&quot; dramatic soprano. Although the two voices are comparable and are sometimes hard to distinguish between, this voice has even greater stamina, endurance and volume than the former. The top register is very strong, clarion and bright. Successful &quot;&quot; are rare.
* Roles:
** Isolde, &quot;Tristan und Isolde&quot; (Richard Wagner)
** Brünnhilde, &quot;Der Ring des Nibelungen&quot; (Richard Wagner)
** Turandot, &quot;Turandot&quot; (Giacomo Puccini)
** Senta, &quot;Der fliegende Holländer&quot; (Richard Wagner)
** Elektra, &quot;Elektra&quot; (Richard Strauss)

== Mezzo-soprano &quot;&quot; ==

* English equivalent: coloratura mezzo-soprano
* Range: From about the G below middle C (G3) to the B two octaves above middle C (B5)
* Description: Found especially in Rossini&#x27;s operas, these roles were written originally for altos with agility and secure top notes. Today they are often played by mezzo-sopranos and sometimes even by sopranos. At times a lyric or full lyric soprano with a flexible voice will assume the roles as written while a true coloratura soprano will sing the same music transposed to a higher key.
* Roles:
** Angelina, &quot;La Cenerentola&quot; (Gioachino Rossini)
** Griselda, &quot;Griselda&quot; (Vivaldi)
** Isabella, &quot;L&#x27;italiana in Algeri&quot; (Gioachino Rossini)
** Isolier, &quot;Le comte Ory&quot; (Rossini)
** Julius Caesar, &quot;Giulio Cesare&quot; (Handel)

** Ruggiero, &quot;Alcina&quot; (Handel)
** Rosina, &quot;Il barbiere di Siviglia&quot; (Gioachino Rossini)
** Tancredi, &quot;Tancredi&quot; (Gioacchino Rossini)

* Range: From about the G below middle C (G3) to the B two octaves above middle C (B5)
* English equivalent: lyric mezzo-soprano
* Description: A lyric mezzo soprano&#x27;s instrument in a lower range; the resulting sound is less piercing, more lachrymose and rather sensitive. The voices are similar, giving rise to the term &#x27;short soprano&#x27; i.e. a soprano without the highest notes. In fact, many lyric mezzos with strong extensions to their upper vocal registers make the transition to singing as sopranos at some point in their careers.
* Roles:
** Charlotte, &quot;Werther&quot; (Massenet)
** Cherubino, &quot;Le nozze di Figaro&quot; (Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart)
** Dorabella, &quot;Così fan tutte&quot; (Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart)

** Mother, &quot;Amahl and the Night Visitors&quot; (Menotti)
** Suzuki, &quot;Madama Butterfly&quot; (Giacomo Puccini)

* English equivalent: dramatic mezzo-soprano
* Range: From about the G below middle C (G3) to the B two octaves above middle C (B5)
* Description: Dramatic mezzo-sopranos have ranges very similar to a dramatic soprano. The main difference is the endurance and ease in which the two voice-types sing – a mezzo will concentrate singing most of the time in her middle and low registers and will go up to notes like high B-flat only at the dramatic climax. Consequently, many dramatic mezzo-sopranos have success in singing some dramatic soprano roles that are written with a lower tessitura.
* Roles:
** Amneris, &quot;Aida&quot; (Giuseppe Verdi) 
** Dido, &quot;Les Troyens&quot; (Hector Berlioz)

** Dalila, &quot;Samson et Dalila&quot; (Camille Saint-Saëns)

* &quot;Basso profondo&quot; is the lowest bass voice type. According to J. B. Steane in &quot;Voices, Singers, and Critics&quot;, the basso profondo voice &quot;derives from a method of tone-production that eliminates the more Italian quick vibrato. In its place is a kind of tonal solidity, a wall-like front, which may nevertheless prove susceptible to the other kind of vibrato, the slow beat or dreaded wobble.&quot;

<text>American Dad! is an American animated sitcom created by Seth MacFarlane, Mike Barker and Matt Weitzman for the Fox Broadcasting Company. The series moved to TBS for its twelfth season in 2014 and continues to air new episodes to this day. &quot;American Dad!&quot; is the first television series made to premiere on Fox&#x27;s Animation Domination block. The series premiered on February 6, 2005, following Super Bowl XXXIX, with the rest of the first season airing from May 1, 2005. 

Creative direction of &quot;American Dad!&quot; had largely been guided by Barker (prior to his departure from the show in season 10) and Weitzman as opposed to MacFarlane, resulting in a series that is different from its counterparts. Unlike MacFarlane&#x27;s other shows, &quot;Family Guy&quot; and, to a lesser extent, &quot;The Cleveland Show&quot;, &quot;American Dad!&quot; does not lean as heavily on the use of cutaway gags, and is less concerned with conventional &quot;setup-punchline&quot; jokes, instead deriving its humor mostly from the quirky characters, the relationships between family members, and the relatively relatable plots. While the core issues and resolutions are relatable in most episodes, the show nonetheless weaves in fantastical elements, pitching the tone of the show somewhere between observational comedy and farce. The plots are often absurd, but grounded by family stories and real-world issues.

&quot;American Dad!&quot; has been nominated for numerous awards, including four Primetime Emmy Awards and two Annie Awards. In June 2013, it was awarded as top television series by the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers. Since its debut, &quot;American Dad!&quot; has broadcast 384 episodes (as of February 24, 2025). The total number of seasons and organization of episodes within those seasons are in dispute due to discrepancies in how official sources report this information. One model suggests the first season of &quot;American Dad!&quot; comprises the first seven episodes, while another model suggests the first season comprises 23 episodes.

Beginning on October 20, 2014, TBS picked up the series for the 12th season following the final three episodes airing on Fox as the 11th season. TBS, TruTV, and Adult Swim, (all owned by Warner Bros. Discovery), air reruns of the series. On December 16, 2021, the series was renewed for seasons 20 and 21. The 20th season premiered on March 27, 2023. The 21st season premiered on October 28, 2024.

==Premise==

The series focuses on the eccentric upper middle class Smith family in a fictionalized version of Langley, Virginia and their four housemates: Father, husband, CIA agent, Republican, and breadwinner Stan; his wife and homemaker/housewife, Francine; their liberal, hippie, college-aged daughter, Hayley; and their dorky high-school-aged son, Steve. There are four additional main characters, including Hayley&#x27;s dimwitted boyfriend and later husband, Jeff Fischer; the family&#x27;s unusual goldfish, Klaus, who has the brain of an East German athlete; Roger, the alien, who is a flamboyant, hedonistic, self-serving master of disguise; and Roger&#x27;s ex-tumor son Rogu. Stan&#x27;s boss Avery Bullock, the Deputy Director of the Central Intelligence Agency, is a recurring character.

===Main characters===

&quot;American Dad!&quot; centers on the absurd circumstances, adventures and domestic life of its title character

* Seth MacFarlane voices Stan Smith (husband/father) and Roger Smith (alien)
* Wendy Schaal voices Francine Smith (wife/mother)
* Scott Grimes voices Steve Smith (Stan and Francine&#x27;s son)
* Rachael MacFarlane voices Hayley D. Smith-Fischer (Stan and Francine&#x27;s daughter)
* Dee Bradley Baker voices Klaus Heisler (the Smiths&#x27; man-in-a-fish-body pet) and Rogu (Roger&#x27;s ex-tumor son)
* Jeff Fischer voices the character of Jeff Fischer (Hayley&#x27;s boyfriend, then husband)
* Patrick Stewart voices Deputy Director Avery Bullock (Stan&#x27;s boss)

==Production==

===Origins and comparison with &quot;Family Guy&quot; and &quot;All in the Family&quot;===
When asked what first spurred the idea for &quot;American Dad!&quot; Seth MacFarlane answered, &quot;It was right after the [2000] election, and me and co-creator Matt Weitzman were so frustrated with the Bush administration that we would just spend days bitching and complaining, and we figured we should channel this into something creative and hopefully profitable.&quot; In early February 2005, Barker stated, &quot;About a year and a half ago, Seth called and asked if Matt and I would be interested in working on a show about a right-wing CIA agent and his liberal daughter. It was right up our alley, and everything just fell into place.&quot; On September 14, 2003, &quot;Variety&quot; reported that Fox Broadcasting had ordered a pilot presentation of the then tentatively titled &quot;American Dad!&quot; and &quot;If greenlit, &quot;American Dad!&quot; could launch as early as fall 2004.&quot; At the time, Fox was aiming to develop a new lineup of adult animated sitcoms.

&quot;American Dad!&quot; had a mid-season debut. Its first episode, titled &quot;Pilot&quot;, was originally shown directly following Super Bowl XXXIX on February 6, 2005. The rest of the first season, however, would not launch until May 1, 2005, as part of the debut of Fox&#x27;s Animation Domination lineup. Initially, it was a replacement for the originally failed series &quot;Family Guy&quot; (1999–2002). &quot;American Dad!&quot; was originally intended to be Fox&#x27;s answer to the hordes of fans left behind from the original failure of MacFarlane&#x27;s previous animated venture. Just three short months after &quot;American Dad!&quot;″s debut however, &quot;Family Guy&quot; was revived, leaving &quot;American Dad!&quot; with a formidable expectation: whether the series could distinguish itself from its counterpart and succeed on its own merits. Instead of taking over creative direction of the series, MacFarlane left the job largely in the hands of Barker and Weitzman so as to distinguish &quot;American Dad!&quot;

In its early going, &quot;American Dad!&quot; brought in strong ratings but fought an uphill battle in gaining widespread acceptance and approval from viewers and critics alike. The popularity of MacFarlane and his involvement with &quot;Family Guy&quot; had led to foregone conclusions and prejudices against &quot;American Dad!&quot; as a rip-off of the predecessor and some critics had already written off &quot;American Dad!&quot; prior to its birth as nothing more than a pale imitation of &quot;Family Guy&quot; and MacFarlane&#x27;s attempts to get his old show back on the air. One example, prior to the &quot;American Dad!&quot; series debut, a writer of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; published a piece that reads &quot;But those same executives have also given MacFarlane a whole new animated half-hour to play with in the disappointing &quot;American Dad!&quot; The new series officially premieres in May but has a sneak preview tomorrow night in the coveted post-Super Bowl time period ... The look and pace of &quot;American Dad!&quot; is the same as &quot;Family Guy&quot;.&quot; 

In actuality, however, the program&#x27;s beginnings take cues from the TV series &quot;All in the Family,&quot; almost a farcical animated version of the live action sitcom. Both shows make use of political satire, bigotry, ludicrous expressions of conservatism from their paternal main character (Stan likened to Archie Bunker), and equally ludicrous expressions of liberalism from their daughter character (Hayley likened to Gloria Stivic). Moreover, the daughter in both series each have a liberal hippie boyfriend turned husband (Jeff likened to Michael Stivic) to whom the daughter&#x27;s conservative father is antagonistic. Also in both, the daughter lives in her parents&#x27; home with her boyfriend turned husband as a housemate. &quot;American Dad!&quot; in its original form was even said to have been inspired by &quot;All in the Family&quot;.

===Development of &quot;American Dad!&quot;″s individuality===
In &quot;American Dad!&quot;″s initial seasons MacFarlane was described as focusing more attention on his coexisting obligation of &quot;Family Guy.&quot; This was to the extent that &quot;American Dad!&quot; was completely secondary to him, and he did not understand the show. Because he was not getting the show at the time, he was described as &quot;just going along for the ride&quot;. Likewise, the rest of the show&#x27;s creators Mike Barker and Matt Weitzman were also trying to figure out the show and where it was going. 

After &quot;American Dad!&quot;″s initial couple of seasons and as it progressed, the show began to increasingly develop its very own distinct approach and identity, becoming more and more distinguished from all other programs on the air. Standing out from its counterparts increasingly with each passing season, the series has been described as eventually becoming the weirdest show in network prime time. It has been characterized as serving up distinguishing blasts of surrealism. As the series progressed, MacFarlane realized that Mike Barker and Matt Weitzman were on to something uniquely appealing; moreover, he realized they were on to something that sharply contrasted from &quot;Family Guy&quot;, which audiences appreciated.

After the show&#x27;s first several seasons, MacFarlane not only came to fully understand and appreciate &quot;American Dad!&quot;″s value but also came to consider himself a huge fan of the series. Taking note of his Twitter followers&#x27; increased fanaticism and excitement over &quot;American Dad!&quot; and the &quot;Roger&quot; character, MacFarlane began putting considerable amounts of his time and efforts into the series, more so in the last several seasons than ever before (this observation made in fall 2012). In describing &quot;American Dad!&quot; comedy styles, Barker noted that it is not as reference-laden as &quot;Family Guy&quot; or &quot;South Park&quot;. He added that &quot;American Dad!&quot;″s humor more frequently derives from &quot;the human condition and emotions that everyone can relate to: ego, the feds, etc. And for that reason, I think our humor is a little more evergreen.&quot;

===Developing plot lines and scripts===
On developing scripts for &quot;American Dad!&quot; episodes, co-creator Mike Barker revealed that he and the rest of the show&#x27;s staff never know when and from where plot line ideas will emerge. &quot;Just as an example,&quot; Barker explained, &quot;All About Steve&quot; is an episode where Stan wants his son to be more of a jock and more like he was when he was his age. That whole episode came about from one of our writers Dave Hemingson coming into our office, telling us he just visited the dentist and he may need to get braces. And the idea of a grown man with braces appealed to us, and we just decided what if we put Stan in braces, and he understands for the first time what it&#x27;s like to feel like a geek.&quot;

During the 2012–13 season, Barker revealed that much of his for &quot;American Dad!&quot; plots came through listening to music. Barker&#x27;s revelation to use music as a muse for his &quot;American Dad!&quot; writing came from attending the 2008 Bonnaroo Music &amp; Arts Festival. During that event, he watched the rock band My Morning Jacket perform a four-hour set in the rain and realized from the experience that he could generate ideas for &quot;American Dad!&quot; by tapping into music: &quot;From that point on, I realized that music should be playing a bigger role in my writing&quot;, Barker told the &quot;Louisville Courier-Journal&quot;. &quot;Writing is hard for me, and when you hear music that inspires good ideas, you&#x27;re really grateful.&quot; The beginning of the show&#x27;s theme song, &quot;Good Morning USA&quot;, uses the introduction to &quot;Stars and Stripes Forever&quot;.

In particular, Barker has credited music from Wax Fang for his inspiration in writing certain &quot;American Dad!&quot; plots. Said Barker, &quot;There&#x27;s just something so inherently cinematic about Wax Fang&#x27;s music. [Scott] Carney&#x27;s voice is stunningly clear and dramatic. And his lyrics are specific enough to build stories around while staying flexible enough for different interpretations.&quot; Barker added that through listening to the Wax Fang track &quot;Majestic&quot;, he was able to come up with major plot elements for the episode &quot;Lost in Space&quot; (this episode features the Wax Fang songs &quot;Majestic&quot; and &quot;At Sea&quot;).

Barker has stated that once he and the rest of the show&#x27;s staff get the idea for the plot line, they spend a couple of weeks in a room with all the screenwriters. There, they break the story and make sure that each act of the two act breaks are strong. As another procedure, Barker stated that they make a point of twisting the story in such a way so as to make audiences come back for more after the commercial break.

&quot;The final process,&quot; Barker explained, &quot;is sending a screenwriter out to write the script. The screenwriter gets two weeks to write the script. The script then comes back.&quot; Barker explained that they then all edit and rewrite it, &quot;hopefully keeping as much of the first draft as we can and punching the jokes and making sure all the motivations are there, and then we take it to the table and read it.&quot;

In February 2005, Barker stated that as creative directors, all decisions made about the plot line and direction of the series go through himself and Weitzman. He explained that the show had reflected their point of view since the beginning. Barker has also credited the program&#x27;s other staff beyond himself, Weitzman, and MacFarlane, remarking &quot;We couldn&#x27;t have made it all happen without them.&quot; At the time, it was noted that the series had a staff of 17 writers, which was described as &quot;a big undertaking&quot;.

When Barker was asked what his favorite part was of the &quot;American Dad!&quot; pre-production process, he answered, &quot;I like the story breaking process, personally—coming up with the stories. To me, that&#x27;s the most gratifying.&quot;

Barker and Matt Weitzman have stated that they are accustomed to feeling scruples with adding certain material into the plots, but always follow this up by going ahead with incorporating the material anyway. They added that their goal is to create laughs combined with groans and going over the line.

===Animated scenes===
MacFarlane played a lead role in the animated character designs for &quot;American Dad!&quot;.

In describing the characters&#x27; appearances, Weitzman remarked &quot;It&#x27;s all very bright, very easy on the eyes.&quot;

In explaining the animated side of the job, Barker stated, &quot;Fifty or so animators from the Fox animation group are involved. A lot is done in-house: poses, models, props, all storyboards and timing.&quot;

Also as reported in February 2005, animation for &quot;American Dad!&quot; is colored and detailed overseas. Yearim Productions Co., Ltd. of Korea are said to handle that end of the pre-production process.

===Editing, completion, and deadlines===
Barker has explained that because &quot;American Dad!&quot; creators are working in animation as opposed to live action, they have the ability to redraw and rewrite up until the show is aired.

However, Barker has also stated, &quot;It&#x27;s really hard to accept anything less than perfect when you start to get wrapped up in this process of being able to constantly make changes. Eventually you have to kind of bring down the hammer at the color stage and live with what you&#x27;ve got.&quot;

Barker has explained that, ultimately, the creation process of an &quot;American Dad!&quot; episode is completed upon the producers&#x27; say-so, not anyone else&#x27;s.

When &quot;American Dad!&quot; co-creator Matt Weitzman was asked what his favorite part was of the show&#x27;s pre-production process, he answered, &quot;I probably enjoy the editing process a lot. I think I like the fine tuning of things and making things happen just so. Making the episode just kind of pop in its own subtle ways.&quot;

&quot;American Dad!&quot; creators have revealed to working significantly in advance of newly broadcast episodes. As many as 20 to 42 unaired episodes are typically ready for finishing touches. Barker explained that a key to this system is making sure that the writing is timeless, as opposed to topical and contemporary. He added that if any material within the script deals with contemporary issues, the creators have to hope that they&#x27;re also contemporary issues two years down the line. When asked whether or not this method has ever brought on difficulties, Barker answered in the affirmative and explained:

::Harriet Miers was, like, the White House Press Secretary, I think, and we had a joke about her. (Miers was a former White House Counsel, who was briefly nominated for the Supreme Court by President George W. Bush.) And I remember watching on air and having to Google who our own joke was, because it had been so long since the joke was pitched. But in terms of stories, we&#x27;re less likely to be burned by a current-event issue no longer being current.

In discussing the creation of &quot;American Dad!&quot; and animated sitcoms in general, MacFarlane has stated:

::It&#x27;s an enormous amount of work. What goes into putting together an animated show, it&#x27;s just staggering ... I always knew there was a lot of work that went into making an animated show. Doing a traditional sitcom, process-wise it feels like a breeze compared to doing an animated show. You can get it all done in a couple of months as opposed to a year. Doing an animated show, it&#x27;s like putting together a little movie every week. Everything is storyboarded with the intricacy of a feature film action sequence. You have to edit with a musical score in mind. And of course, we use an orchestra for each episode. So it&#x27;s really like putting together a little feature each week and I was just shocked at how much—not to underplay all the work that goes into live-action sitcoms—but my God, it&#x27;s definitely a much more difficult medium to me.

Conversely, Barker has stated:

::Working on animated shows like &quot;American Dad!&quot; is such a breath of fresh air. You don&#x27;t have to worry about sets and such that you have to worry about for live-action. Animation can give you more freedom.

===Setting===
The Smith family and their housemates reside on Cherry Street in the fictional suburb of Langley Falls, Virginia, in a large two-story residence with a basement and an attic. In addition, the Smith house is apparently enhanced with numerous secret rooms, facilities, and large habitats, these unorthodox attachments usually only seen once apiece (i.e., the episodes &quot;Of Ice and Men&quot;, &quot;Bush Comes to Dinner&quot;, &quot;The Missing Kink&quot;, &quot;The Full Cognitive Redaction of Avery Bullock by the Coward Stan Smith&quot;, etc.). Greg and Terry are a gay couple that live across the street from the Smiths. Within the neighborhood, they are portrayed as running a neater and tidier home than the Smiths. Greg and Terry are also the local news anchor for W-ANG-TV. Also in the area is the high school attended by Steve, Pearl Bailey High School.

===Voice cast===
The voice actors are not assembled as a group when performing the lines of their characters; rather, each of the voice actors perform their lines privately. The voice actors have stated that because of their personalities and tendency to goof off when together as a group, they would never get anything completed if they performed their lines collectively.

==Plot techniques==

===Farces===
&quot;American Dad!&quot; has commonly made use of farce as most of the predicaments that befall the main characters have escalated into the extremes, to the point of getting outrageously out of hand. For example, in the episode &quot;Home Wrecker&quot;, Stan and Francine&#x27;s marital harmony breaks down from a difference of opinion on remodeling the house. It gets to the point where they divide the house in two, each decorating their half of the house in their desired fashion. Still not satisfied with this, they both attempt to drive the other out of the home and eventually erect a colossal block wall, dividing the two halves of the house. The rest of the family members are forced to spend one holiday after the next alternating between Fran&#x27;s and Stan&#x27;s place (the sides of the house treated as distinct homes). As another example, in the episode &quot;Stan&#x27;s Food Restaurant&quot;, Stan asks for Roger&#x27;s help in starting a restaurant. As things progress, Roger makes heavy changes in the layout, eventually kicking Stan out of the project. Stan retaliates by opening another restaurant next door, which becomes a smashing success. Roger responds by blowing up Stan&#x27;s restaurant but destroying his own in the process. Stan threatens to kill Roger, but backs down after Roger pulls a gun on him and tells him to relax.

===Surreal humor===
&quot;American Dad!&quot; plots are generally teeming with surrealism and nonsensical elements. Many of the occurrences, circumstances, and behaviors are unrestrainedly preposterous, senseless, and illogical.

As further examples of surrealism on &quot;American Dad!&quot;—in the episode &quot;Hurricane!&quot;, a ferocious bear pauses in his attack, lowers his eyelids halfway, and repeatedly shakes his head horizontally, shaming Stan for missing him in a harpoon shot and instead spearing Francine into a wall; in the episode &quot;Why Can&#x27;t We Be Friends?&quot;, the hallways of the Smith house transform into dark and dangerous alleyways every time Roger pays Jeff then ambushes him (in disguise) to steal the money back. He even tries to forcibly rape Jeff; in the episode &quot;The Missing Kink&quot;, Steve and family fish Klaus are shown competing in a one-on-one basketball game between each other, the score nearly tied at 11 to 10; also in the &quot;Missing Kink&quot; episode, the Smith house is shown to consist of a never-before-seen underworld to which various friends and acquaintances of the Smiths party and frolic; in the episode &quot;The Full Cognitive Redaction of Avery Bullock by the Coward Stan Smith&quot;, Stan has a never-before-seen secret control room hidden underground just beside the house. The control room door&#x27;s exterior side is camouflaged with the grass surrounding it. The room is filled with highly advanced, state-of-the-art equipment. Access to the control room is achieved through a handprint reading device that extends from the ground when Stan extends his arm/hand at it; etc.

===Non sequitur/story within a story===
Among the many forms of surreal humor and nonsense elements that have been used by &quot;American Dad!&quot; is the non sequitur/story within a story technique. This arises when the show&#x27;s focus becomes sidetracked by entirely unknown and unrelated characters in circumstances that are irrelevant to the episode&#x27;s main plot. Typically when this happens, it is after the show has maintained focus on its main characters for much of the episode; following this, the scenes randomly lose focus and become deeply wrapped up into the lives of never-before-seen characters who are non-central to the plot. A prime example of this is in the episode &quot;Homeland Insecurity&quot;. As opposed to scenes focusing on main characters, attention is redirected deep into the lives of unknown characters who gain possession of Roger&#x27;s gem-encrusted golden feces – this storyline of the dramas resulting from &quot;The Golden Turd&quot; continues in later episodes. As another example, in the episode &quot;The Missing Kink&quot;, the show&#x27;s focus is sporadically sidetracked with brief scenes revolving around the life of a drug abusing bird and Francine&#x27;s inexplicable ability to both understand and communicate with the bird&#x27;s chirping.

===Plot twists and unexpected elements===
The series has abounded with random, unexpected occurrences and surprise plot twists as result of the characters and the very makeup of the program. For example, in the episode &quot;The Full Cognitive Redaction of Avery Bullock by the Coward Stan Smith&quot;, Steve refers to Roger for help in dealing with a school bully, Luiz. Because Steve is able to correctly predict Roger&#x27;s original game plan of handling the situation himself under an alter ego, Roger : he not only hires Stelio Kontos (from the episode &quot;Bully for Steve&quot;) who was Stan&#x27;s bully, to handle the matter, but hires him to bully Steve so Steve&#x27;s original bully Luiz won&#x27;t want another bully&#x27;s sloppy seconds. Then Luiz, encouraged by Steve, goes to beat up the guy that beat him up yet learns that it is Stelio Kontos and the two bullies team up along with Roger to target Steve. The Stelio Kontos&#x27;s song sounds, revamped by Roger adding &quot;&quot;and Luiz&quot; &quot;. As another example, in the episode &quot;The Vacation Goo&quot;, Francine becomes frustrated that she cannot get the family together for Sunday night dinner. For family time, Stan suggests a vacation, and the Smiths have a great time in Maui as a family. This is up until Roger shuts down the mechanism Francine and the kids are all attached to so as to believe they are all on vacation. Francine and the kids then learn that Stan has been programming a pseudo-vacation every year in a contraption dubbed &quot;the goo chambers&quot;. After learning of this, Francine demands they go on a real vacation. Twice they appear to do so, first skiing, then to Italy, until it is ultimately revealed that they are in the &quot;goo chambers&quot; all along, with Steve and then Hayley having programmed the vacations, respectively. In the episode &quot;Spelling Bee My Baby&quot;, Steve deliberately misspells his words in a spelling bee so as to express his love for Akiko (who is also competing), instead spelling random Tyler Perry/Madea films.

===Story arc use===
Another technique used by &quot;American Dad!&quot; is the story arc. On several occasions, a circumstance expands and progresses across a collection of episodes. As an example, one of Hayley&#x27;s temporary breakups with Jeff expanded across a string of episodes, in which she instead temporarily dated a black man in a koala body, Reginald Koala—known for his very urban mannerisms and behaviors. As another example, since the 9th season episode &quot;Naked to the Limit, One More Time&quot;, Jeff Fischer has been absent from the Smith house and planet Earth altogether. In that episode, Jeff is when Roger hurls him into a spaceship. This spacecraft belongs to Roger&#x27;s race of aliens and was intended to return him back to his birth planet; Roger remains behind after casting Jeff into the spaceship. The spaceship immediately takes off and Jeff is not seen until several episodes later, the episode &quot;Lost in Space&quot;. During episodes that aired between the two aforementioned episodes, allusions to the ongoing plot line are made. For example, in the episode &quot;Spelling Bee My Baby&quot;, Hayley is shown holding out hope for Jeff&#x27;s return. In the episode, Roger and Stan attempt to rush Hayley through her grieving process so she will be willing to be their tennis official. In the episode &quot;The Longest Distance Relationship&quot; Jeff gets in touch with Hayley via a radio and ultimately tells her not to wait for him and to move on with her life. This story arc is finally resolved in the episode &quot;Holy Shit, Jeff&#x27;s Back!&quot;; Jeff supposedly returns to Earth but turns out to be an alien called Zebleer masquerading as Jeff and the real Jeff has been dissected. Jeff&#x27;s brain is transplanted into Zebleer&#x27;s body allowing the real Jeff to live, after which Stan and Hayley&#x27;s memories are wiped, leaving them unaware that Jeff is no longer entirely human. This plot point is continued at the end of &quot;Bahama Mama&quot;, where Roger mentions Jeff cannot get Hayley pregnant because he has an alien body, so he agrees to rebirth Jeff in &quot;Roger&#x27;s Baby&quot;. By the end of the episode, Jeff is human again and with Hayley on Earth. Another example of the usage of story arcs are the Christmas Specials, starting with the Season 7 episode &quot;For Whom the Sleigh Bell Tolls&quot;, Santa Claus became the main antagonist of the arc, vowing to get revenge on The Smiths after nearly being killed by Steve in the aforementioned episode. The storyline expands in the Season 10 episode &quot;Minstrel Krampus&quot;, the episode concludes with a small change to the status quo, Stan&#x27;s Father Jack fuses with Krampus&#x27; soul and becomes the new Krampus, up until his death in Season 17. Santa returns in the Season 14 episode &quot;Ninety North, Zero West&quot;, where Santa kidnaps Steve to take over the world by unleashing an ancient god in the North Pole. He is seemingly killed off by falling off a cliff and breaking his neck. The storyline continues in the following Season 15 episode &quot;Santa, Schmanta&quot;, albeit not directly related to the story arc, it does explain Santa&#x27;s death and reveals be was revived at the end of the episode. Santa Claus returned in the Season 20 episode &quot;Into the Jingleverse&quot; where he gives Stan virtual reality goggles in order to be King of Presents forever.

In discussing the cartoon&#x27;s distinguishing story arc element, co-creator Mike Barker explained:

::We just try to obey basic rules of continuity. We try to avoid stories where a character is taking a big step like marriage and then not going back to it. I think by doing that, then in the future when we have big changes, the audience knows that they&#x27;re going to be living with those changes for a while. So it&#x27;s not just a thrown-away bit. It kind of endows that story beat with more power because it&#x27;s going to last. It&#x27;s not just going to be a reset button.

===Black comedy===
Much of the wit used in &quot;American Dad!&quot; has come in the form of black comedy as many of the predicaments and circumstances have made fun of the characters in life-threatening, disastrous, terrifying, and traumatic situations. As an example, the episode &quot;A Ward Show&quot; contains scenes of suicide and murder: Roger became Steve&#x27;s legal guardian and responded to him getting picked on at school by rigging the teachers&#x27; cars with explosives and killing them all. Later on in the episode while Principal Lewis was driving his vehicle with Steve as the passenger, he informed Steve that he was about to drive off the Grand Canyon in a murder-suicide. This culminated in Roger saving the day, his love supernaturally allowing the car to fly once Principal Lewis drove off the Canyon; another vehicle with a random white man and a black boy in it (opposite of Principal Lewis, a black man and Steve, a white boy) had also, coincidentally enough, driven off the opposite side of the Grand Canyon in a murder-suicide attempt. This resulted in a midair collision between the car with Principal Lewis and Steve in it and the car with the white man and black boy in it. Another example, in the episode &quot;Da Flippity Flop&quot;, Roger leaves a long series of harassing answering machine messages for Steve, trying to get him to sign up for his gym. In these messages, Roger is also heard snapping on various people, killing three individuals from reckless driving, landing himself in court, and subsequently becoming irate and shooting up numerous people at the city courthouse for being scolded to turn off his mobile phone.

==Episodes==

===Season number discrepancies===
There are multiple conflicting reports and models of the number of seasons &quot;American Dad!&quot; has had.

* One of the reports upholds a one-season-fewer numbering model: Under this arrangement, season 1 is a combination of both the first 7 episodes and the following 16 episodes, despite the separation of these two episode collections by a summer hiatus. Under this arrangement, season 1 is uncharacteristically longer in contrast to the rest of the show&#x27;s seasons, consisting of 23 episodes.
* The other report upholds a one-season-more numbering model: Under this arrangement, season 1 ended after the program&#x27;s first 7 episodes leading into the summer hiatus. Season 2 then picked up when the following 16 episodes began that fall. Under this arrangement, season 1 is uncharacteristically shorter in contrast to the rest of the show&#x27;s seasons, consisting of only 7 episodes, just like MacFarlane&#x27;s other show, &quot;Family Guy&quot;.
* Hulu, which is the online American streaming home for &quot;American Dad!&quot;, lists the number of seasons as 17. Hulu combines episodes 1–23 into season 1, and combines episodes 173–190 into season 10. The same can be said for its other sister streaming service Disney+ via its Star hub which is also the international online streaming home for &quot;American Dad&quot; and combines season 11 with season 12 just like Hulu.

Commentary from &quot;American Dad!&quot; co-creators Matt Weitzman and Mike Barker has largely been consistent with (A): on September 28, 2012, the two were interviewed and reported that they had 20 episodes completed for the then imminent &quot;eighth season&quot;, and were &quot;developing our ninth season&quot;. During the show&#x27;s life on Fox, however, the network contradicted that arrangement, presenting information on the show&#x27;s then website that followed (B): in listing all episodes from the 2012–13 season, Fox reported each as existing as part of the show&#x27;s &quot;ninth season&quot;. In addition, Fox contradicted its own &quot;American Dad!&quot; website, also supporting the one-season-fewer numbering scheme: FoxFlash, which is the publicity center for Fox, labeled the 2012–13 broadcasts as the &quot;eighth season&quot;. Websites releasing the show&#x27;s season-based ratings have also used the one-season-fewer numbering method.

===Episode misreporting===
Fox advertisements for the episode &quot;Lost in Space&quot; promoted the episode as &quot;American Dad!&quot;″s 150th. Subsequently, numerous mainstream media reports also labeled the episode as the 150th. In actuality, it was the show&#x27;s 151st episode, while the episode &quot;The Full Cognitive Redaction of Avery Bullock by the Coward Stan Smith&quot; was the series actual 150th episode. In addition, Fox promoted the episode&#x27;s plot as the revealing of Roger&#x27;s birth planet. While the setting of this episode is a spaceship owned by members of Roger&#x27;s alien race, to date, Roger&#x27;s birth planet has yet to be revealed.

In 2020, after airing the first episode of the seventeenth season, TBS aired two episodes that had originally been scheduled to air at the end of the previous season before being pulled from the schedule. While TBS&#x27; official website lists these two episodes, &quot;Downtown&quot; and &quot;Cheek to Cheek: A Stripper&#x27;s Story&quot;, as season 14 (Wikipedia&#x27;s season 16) episodes 21 and 22, the official YouTube playlist includes them in season 15 (Wikipedia&#x27;s season 17) as episodes 2 and 3. TBS also promoted the 299th episode, titled &quot;300&quot;, as the series&#x27; three hundredth episode which was in fact the 300th produced, but aired as the 299th episode as the episode &quot;Yule. Tide. Repeat.&quot; which was produced prior to &quot;300&quot; was not scheduled to air before the broadcast of &quot;300&quot;.

==Adjustments in on-air presentation, production, and broadcasts==

===The unaired precursory pilot===
While the series premiere of &quot;American Dad!&quot; is titled &quot;Pilot&quot;, &quot;Pilot&quot; is not the show&#x27;s actual pilot presentation. The actual pilot is a 6-minute version of the first 6 minutes in the series premiere. This precursory pilot was used by MacFarlane, Barker, and Weitzman to sell &quot;American Dad!&quot; to Fox and was never aired along with the rest of the series.

While much of the dialogue and general scenery were simply redone between the precursory pilot and the following series premiere, there are sharp distinctions between the two. Differences also exist between the precursory pilot and the official series as a whole. Most of these are in the pictorial technique. For example, scenes from the pilot are drawn in a rougher, more cursory fashion with weaker coloration than scenes from the official series. Most prominently, Steve&#x27;s physical design and outfit in the predecessor greatly contrast from his official design and outfit. In addition, Steve is voiced by Ricky Blitt in the precursory pilot but by Scott Grimes in the official series. There are also variations in Steve&#x27;s personality.

===Characterization===
Early episodes of the series featured political banter between the conservative Stan and liberal Hayley. However, the creators learned quickly that this had only &quot;a limited shelf life&quot; and did not provide them as much as they originally thought it would. Said co-creator Matt Weitzman, &quot;There are times when we still have that kind of dynamic between them, but not nearly what it was in the first season. And I think the show, honestly, has grown and benefited from it, because that would have gotten boring after a while.&quot;

Roger was enhanced by being provided with a running gag of alternate disguises and freedom to exist outside of the Smith house. The show&#x27;s original concept basically portrayed him as being similar to ALF, having him sit in the house all day while commenting on life. The creators, however, have stated that the character was far too much fun to keep restricted to the house, and having him interact with different people provided for much material. The creators have further appreciated the direction of Roger for the fact that he almost serves as a different guest star for each episode what with his many alter egos. The show&#x27;s staff believe this element of the show highlights MacFarlane&#x27;s versatility as he voices Roger and his countless alter egos.

There have been three versions of the &quot;Steve&quot; character, the creators having twice made considerable adjustments to his design. Steve&#x27;s initial design ended up being a one-off execution limited to the unaired precursory pilot (not to be confused with the series premiere, titled &quot;Pilot&quot;). By the season premiere, Scott Grimes had begun voicing Steve, and his design was made taller, more filled out, and less geeky. After early seasons of the series, Steve was remodeled again. This time he was made softer, more emotional, cuter and more endearing, creating a sharper contrast to his father Stan&#x27;s ruggedness and machismo.

Between the eighth and ninth seasons, there were significant changes in the show&#x27;s writing staff. Mike Barker mentions (with one-season-less numbering) &quot;We lost some animators, and we lost a lot of writers. Season eight, our writing staff is about 65–70 percent new.&quot;

===Network relocation from Fox to TBS===
On July 16, 2013, it was announced that &quot;American Dad!&quot; had been cancelled by Fox. Shortly thereafter, however, the cable station TBS picked up the show for a 15-episode 11th season, which premiered on October 20, 2014. Along with airing original episodes, TBS also airs reruns of &quot;American Dad!&quot; in syndication. The tenth season was initially to be the final one on Fox; however, on July 20, 2014, it was announced that Fox had three unaired episodes left for broadcast. Two of the three aired back-to-back on September 14, 2014, and the final one aired on September 21, 2014. Reports from Fox seemed to imply that these three episodes constituted a season of their own, season 10. Among multiple discrepant reports from TBS however, one indicated that the three episodes were the beginning of the 11th season to resume on their network. TBS actually debuted their first episode through social media websites YouTube and Facebook on October 13, 2014; the October 20, 2014, date applies to the linear television debut.

On the show&#x27;s network relocation, Mike Barker has stated, &quot;It&#x27;s going to be the same &quot;American Dad!&quot;, just in a different place.&quot; Barker also joked that the network relocation was to execute a Tyler Perry crossover Barker and &quot;American Dad!&quot; production staff had long aspired to.

===Mike Barker&#x27;s exit===
On November 4, 2013, it was announced that Mike Barker had departed &quot;American Dad!&quot; Barker had served for ten seasons as the show&#x27;s co-creator/executive and producer/co-showrunner. Matt Weitzman is now serving as the show&#x27;s sole showrunner. The news came as early production for season 11 commenced. , the show&#x27;s production crew was developing its first four episodes for season 11, slated to begin airing on October 20, 2014, when &quot;American Dad!&quot; moved to TBS. Barker remained under an overall contract with 20th Century Fox Television.

Following Mike Barker&#x27;s exit, Brian Boyle replaced him as the showrunner for the television series.

===2023 showrunners strike===
On May 12, 2023, it was announced that the showrunners of &quot;American Dad&quot;, including Seth MacFarlane, would temporarily leave the show as a result of the 2023 Writers Guild of America Strike. They returned to the show on September 27, 2023, once the strike was declared to be over.

==Reception==
In 2016, a study by &quot;The New York Times&quot; of the 50 TV shows with the most Facebook Likes found that &quot;American Dad!&quot; is popular in the Northeastern United States and the Mid-Atlantic states, as well as the Great Lakes Region; however, it &quot;is not popular in Utah or much of the South&quot;.

===Ratings===

Until season 12, when &quot;American Dad!&quot; moved to TBS, all but one episode originally aired on Animation Domination. The program&#x27;s series premiere is the only episode that pre-dates the Animation Domination lineup.

The series premiere episode, &quot;Pilot&quot;, aired directly following Fox&#x27;s broadcast of Super Bowl XXXIX on February 6, 2005. The episode aired alongside &quot;The Simpsons&quot; and pulled in 15 million viewers, with 23 million viewers overall. Both Animation Domination and the rest of the show&#x27;s first season commenced on May 1, 2005.

Barker did not announce any specifics as it relates to the nature and type of film he and the rest of the show&#x27;s creators had in mind for the series; however, he strongly suggested that a movie is where the show&#x27;s staff and creators would like to take things. Barker further hinted that an &quot;American Dad!&quot; movie may already even be in the works and partially written. Speaking at Comic-Con 2022, Matt Weitzman revealed plans for a feature film were scrapped.

<text>Leaf River (French: &quot;Rivière aux Feuilles&quot;; Inuktitut: &quot;Kuugaaluk&quot; [&quot;the large river&quot;] or &quot;Itinniq&quot; [&quot;where there are spring tides&quot;]) is a river in northern Quebec, Canada, at the northern limit of the tree line. It flows from Lake Minto northeast through the Ungava Peninsula into Leaf Bay off Ungava Bay over a distance of . At the head of Leaf Bay is the Inuit community of Tasiujaq.

With caution, it is possible to paddle the entire Leaf River without portaging, as it contains no impassable waterfalls or non-navigable rapids. The river&#x27;s length, measured from Charpentier Bay to Tasiujaq, is ; if measured from first discernable current, it is .

The river is ice-free for about 60 days each year.

==Tributaries==
The significant tributaries of the Leaf River are:
* Charpentier River
* Nedlouc River
* Descareaux River
* Daunais River
* Goudalie River
* Vizien River
* Brissard River
* Qijuttuuk River
* Cohade River
* Tuktu River
* Dufreboy Creek
* Viennaux River
* Papijjusaq River
* Peladeau River
* Fanfan River

== History ==
Since at least the late 19th century, the river has been known by its English name, &quot;Leaf River&quot;, which was probably derived from the Arctic willow and birch trees that grow sparsely along its banks. The Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company fished there for salmon and porpoises, and opened a trading post at the mouth of the river around 1905. In the early 20th century, the French name &quot;Rivière des Feuilles&quot; was assigned, and standardized to its current form &quot;Rivière aux Feuilles&quot; in 1925.

First known explorers:
1898 - Albert Peter Low
1912 - Robert J. Flaherty
1976 - Bob Davis

== The Leaf River caribou herd ==

The Leaf River caribou herd (LRCH) is a migratory forest-tundra ecotype of the boreal population, a caribou subspecies of Rangifer tarandus caribou. Like the George River Herd, it migrates between forest and tundra. Migratory caribou herds are often defined in terms of female natal philopatry or natal homing, the tendency to return to natal calving areas—in this case, the Leaf River. The Leaf Herd in the west, near the coast of Hudson Bay, increased from 270,000 in 1991 to 628,000 in 2001. According to the Quebec&#x27;s Natural Resources and Wildlife survey, the Leaf River Herd (LRH) (Rivière-aux-Feuilles) had decreased to 430,000 caribou in 2011. According to an international study on caribou populations, the Leaf River herd could be threatened with extinction by 2080.

<doc id="908679" wikidata="Q1201545" url="?curid=908679" title="Detroit Olympia">
<text>Detroit Olympia, also known as Olympia Stadium, was a multi-purpose arena in Detroit. Nicknamed &quot;The Old Red Barn&quot;, it was best known as the home of the Detroit Red Wings of the National Hockey League (NHL) from its opening in 1927 to 1979.

==History==
Several Detroit businessmen organized the Detroit Hockey Club, Inc. in 1926 and purchased the Victoria Cougars hockey team, along with a site at the corner of Grand River Avenue and McGraw Street to construct an arena and engaged Detroit-based Walbridge Aldinger as general contractor. In July 1926, the Detroit Hockey Club unveiled drawings for the Olympia Stadium to be built on the site. The cornerstone for the building was laid by Mayor John W. Smith on March 8, 1927.

The Olympia opened on October 15, 1927; at that time the only other buildings that exceeded its seating capacity were Madison Square Garden and the London Olympia. The opening event was the International Stampede and Rodeo, which ran from October 15 to October 22. Shortly thereafter, the primary tenants of the building, the NHL Cougars, began their long residence. The Cougars played their first game at the Olympia on November 22, 1927, and Detroit&#x27;s Johnny Sheppard scored the first goal at the new building. However, the visiting Ottawa Senators defeated the Cougars, 2–1. The Cougars later became the Falcons and finally, in 1932, were named the Detroit Red Wings by new owner James E. Norris.

In addition to the Red Wings, the Olympia was also home to the Detroit Olympics International Hockey League minor league team in the 1930s, the BAA&#x27;s Detroit Falcons from 1946 to 1947, and the NBA&#x27;s Detroit Pistons from 1957 to 1961; that period marked the only time until the opening of Little Caesars Arena in 2017 that the Red Wings and Pistons shared the same arena on a full-time basis. It hosted the NHL All-Star Game in 1950, 1952, 1954, and 1955, the NBA All-Star Game in 1959 and the NCAA Men&#x27;s Ice Hockey Championship (known as the &quot;Frozen Four&quot;) in 1977 and 1979.

The Olympia was also a major venue for boxing through the International Boxing Club (featuring such prominent fights as Jake LaMotta&#x27;s defeats of Sugar Ray Robinson) and professional wrestling, as well as other events such as the 1931 American Legion Convention which was addressed by President Herbert Hoover, and regular visits by the Harlem Globetrotters, Ice Capades, Shipstads and Johnson Ice Follies. It hosted concerts by The Beatles on September 6, 1964, and August 13, 1966, as well as concerts by other popular performers and bands, including Kiss, Led Zeppelin and Elvis Presley.

By the late 1970s, the neighborhood surrounding the Olympia had been in decline since the 1967 riots. In 1977, the Red Wings announced that they would be moving to a proposed arena in suburban Pontiac. The city of Detroit would counter with a proposed riverfront arena for much less rent that Pontiac was seeking. The package included operational control of both the new arena, nearby Cobo Arena and the adjoining parking structures. The Red Wings accepted Detroit&#x27;s offer.

On December 15, 1979, three days after the first event held at Joe Louis Arena, the Red Wings played their final home game at the Olympia, a 4–4 tie against the Quebec Nordiques. Attendance at that game was 15,609. They would move to Joe Louis Arena on December 27. The final event at the building took place on February 21, 1980. It was demolished on July 10, 1986. Currently, the Michigan National Guard&#x27;s Olympia Armory occupies the site. A historical marker posted inside the armory commemorates the Olympia.

The original OLYMPIA letters that adorned the sides of the building were placed into storage at Joe Louis Arena, then installed in Little Caesars Arena in 2017, which became the new home for the Red Wings.

==Architecture==
The building was tall and constructed of a steel frame faced with red brick with brown terra cotta and stone trim in a Romanesque Revival style. The Grand River and McGraw facades originally included 13 storefronts. Near the parapet were terra cotta medallions depicting various athletes. When it opened, Olympia contained the largest indoor skating rink in the United States at 242 ft (74 m) by 110 ft (34 m).

The Grand River facade featured three-story arched windows with a large recessed arch in the center. The large arch originally was filled with black glass. However, in later years, it was covered with wood, painted with the Red Wings emblem. Topping the facade was a pediment creating a gable-shaped roof.

The arena had five levels. The ground level through which patrons entered and featured a concourse that circled the seating area. Above were the mezzanine, main seating level and balcony. A fifth level not open to the public was just under the roof trusses. The trusses spanned and were above the floor.

The initial seating capacity was 11,563. On June 23, 1965, work began to add to the rear of the structure. The addition was four stories high and included additional seating and an escalator to improve patron access to the upper levels. It expanded seating to 13,375 in 1966 with standing room for 3,300 during hockey games. In addition to the new seats, the original 11,563 seats were replaced at a cost of $23 each and new boards and timeclocks were installed.

While not one of the most decorative, architect C. Howard Crane considered Olympia to be one of his most significant buildings. He noted the importance of the refrigeration system buried beneath the concrete. Within the of available floor space were of piping. The system was replaced in 1967 and the final modification to the building was the addition of private boxes in 1970.

<text>The Cypress Hills Massacre occurred on June 1, 1873, near Battle Creek in the Cypress Hills region of Canada&#x27;s North-West Territories (now in Saskatchewan). It involved a group of American bison hunters, American wolf hunters or &quot;wolfers&quot;, American and Canadian whisky traders, Métis cargo haulers or &quot;freighters&quot;, and a camp of Assiniboine people. Thirteen or more Assiniboine warriors and one wolfer died in the conflict. The Cypress Hills Massacre prompted the Canadian government to accelerate the recruitment and deployment of the newly formed North-West Mounted Police.

==Incident==
The incident began in the spring of 1873 when a small party of Canadian Red River Métis and American wolfers, led by Thomas W. Hardwick and John Evans, was returning from their winter hunt. While they were camped on the Teton River, their horses disappeared overnight. Presuming that their horses had been stolen by &#x27;Indians&#x27;, the men travelled on foot to Fort Benton, Montana Territory, about away, and asked for assistance from the local authorities to retrieve them. The authorities at Fort Benton refused to assist them, so Hardwick organized his own expedition and set off to retrieve the stolen horses. The party numbered 13 men, comprising both U.S. and Canadian &#x27;free traders&#x27; and wolf-hunters.

The group quickly travelled from Fort Benton northward across the border in pursuit of the stolen horses. They eventually arrived at Abe Farwell&#x27;s small trading post in the Cypress Hills. While there, they encountered George Hammond, a friend of both Evans and Hardwick, who had been selling whisky in the area. Hammond subsequently joined Hardwick&#x27;s group in the search for the missing horses.

Farwell had assured Evans that Little Soldier, the leader of a small band of Assiniboine camped near the trading post, had no horses with them. After a brief search it was determined by the group that Little Soldier showed no evidence that he had stolen their horses, so Evans, Hammond, and the rest of the wolfers retired for the night to Farwell&#x27;s trading post, where they spent the evening and the next morning drinking Farwell&#x27;s whisky with a group of recently arrived Métis freighters.

In the morning Hammond complained that one of Little Soldier&#x27;s men had stolen his horse for a second time, and started towards Little Soldier&#x27;s camp, insisting that the rest of the wolfers join him to retrieve his horse. The wolfers, along with the Métis, followed Hammond to the Assiniboine camp.

Historical accounts differ on what happened during the skirmish, as there were no reliable testimonies. The best information states that: 
* Abe Farwell testified that he tried to restrain Hammond in an attempt to avoid any violence. 
* Hammond approached Little Soldier&#x27;s tent asking about the missing horse. 
* Little Soldier replied that his group had not stolen the horse but that it was grazing on a nearby hill.

Both Little Soldier&#x27;s and Hammond&#x27;s parties were intoxicated, and negotiations between them fell through. Little Soldier offered Hammond two of his horses as hostages until the missing horse could be found, but the situation became increasingly tense as women and children began fleeing from the camp and Little Soldier&#x27;s men began stripping off their garments in preparation for battle.

The wolfers regarded these actions as a signal for a fight and lined up along a riverbank 50 yards outside the Assiniboine camp. In a last-ditch effort to avoid violence, Abe Farwell pleaded with the wolfers, asking them not to start shooting. Before he could continue negotiating with Little Soldier and the wolfers, Farwell saw Hammond fire his rifle. The rest of the wolfers, protected by the tall river bank, then fired volleys into the camp. The Assiniboine, using inferior weapons, returned fire, but were unable to sustain an attack due to the wolfers&#x27; protected position.

The total number of casualties reported differs widely in various accounts. One of Hardwick&#x27;s men—Ed Legrace—was killed, but the number of Assiniboine casualties was higher. The personal account of Donald Graham, who joined the wolfers at Fort Benton and travelled with them to the Cypress Hills, states that 13 of Little Soldier&#x27;s men were killed in the exchanges of fire. After the battle, the wolfers buried Legrace in a cabin and set the building ablaze. Some sources claim that Legrace&#x27;s wooden coffin still remains there to this day.

The site of the massacre was designated a National Historic Site of Canada in 1964. Artifacts from the Cypress Hills Massacre have also been preserved at nearby Fort Walsh National Historic Site, along with reconstructions of Farwell&#x27;s and Solomon&#x27;s trading posts.

==Aftermath==

News of the Cypress Hills Massacre did not reach Ottawa until late August 1873. The Canadian government soon took steps to have those involved extradited from the United States and tried for murder, causing confrontation between Canada and the United States. The case languished for some time and then was taken up by the newly created North-West Mounted Police (NWMP). The NWMP at this time was still establishing itself; the battle between the Assiniboine warriors and Hardwick&#x27;s group of wolf-hunters at Cypress Hills was one of the catalysts for its creation.

===Investigation and trials===
In December 1874, Assistant Commissioner James Macleod was given permission by the U.S. government to enter Helena, Montana Territory, to investigate the Cypress Hills Massacre. Depending upon the findings of this investigation, the accused could have faced extradition to Canada to face trial under Canadian law. Seven arrests were made, but two men escaped custody before they could be examined. The remaining men were freed because there was not enough clear evidence to prove anything against them, and the American commissioner refused the extradition request as there was far too much conflicting testimony. The Canadian Commissioner (Macleod) was subsequently charged with false arrest, but this charge was soon dropped.

In June 1876, shortly after they were released from custody in the United States, two traders and a wolfer crossed the border into Canada and were subsequently arrested and put on trial in Winnipeg. The Crown&#x27;s case against them failed, however, once again weakened by insufficient or contradictory evidence. The three men were acquitted, and the case was finally dropped in 1882.

W. E. Cullen, the American commissioner, said at the extradition hearing at Helena: although the &quot;preponderance of testimony is to the effect that the Indians commenced the firing... they were doubtlessly provoked to this by the apparently hostile attitudes of the whites... An armed party menacing their camp, no matter for what purpose, was by no means slight provocations.&quot;

===Creation of the North-West Mounted Police===
It is very difficult to measure the impact that the Cypress Hills Massacre had on Canada and the United States. The creation of the NWMP was introduced partially as a result of the massacre. Around this time, the Lieutenant Governor of Manitoba, Alexander Morris, was concerned about perceived threats of violence to uniformed Canadians and Americans conducting geological surveys. As a result, Morris had to call off any further surveying until there was a solution. Unable to find a solution, Morris used the reports of the massacre to call on the Prime Minister of Canada, Sir John A. Macdonald, to create a police force. Already planning to establish a police force in the North-West Territories, Macdonald had envisioned a horse-mounted brigade based on the idea of the Royal Irish Constabulary. The force would be small; only 300 men could enlist. For an area that covered 480,000 square kilometres, the force would have to be as mobile as possible. Alexander Campbell, the minister of the interior, did not believe sending an armed police force into the North-West Territories was necessary at this time, causing Morris to fear that any delay in training and deployment could be exacerbated further once winter fell. To force their creation, Morris claimed that the Métis and white settlers in the area around Portage la Prairie and Fort Qu&#x27;Appelle were experiencing fear and unrest due to the massacre. On September 25, 1873, the government of Canada issued an order-in-council to appoint nine officers of &quot;Mounted Police Force for the North-West Territories&quot;. Recruitment began immediately, and the NWMP was created. With the new police force patrolling the area, the border could no longer be so easily crossed.

The creation of the police force also had a political motive. The investigation into the massacre was to ensure that First Nations in the area were able to trust the Canadian government. The investigation would require international cooperation of two federal governments, and the North-West Mounted Police would take measures to make examples out of international criminals. Although ultimately the prosecutions resulted in no convictions, the willingness to seek justice for any Canadian contributed to the establishment of peace between the NWMP and First Nations.

===In media===
When the news of the Cypress Hills Massacre broke in eastern Canada, it started a wave of anti-Americanism. In the news, the American men were described as &quot;American gangsters&quot; and &quot;American scums&quot;. The idea that only American frontiersmen could commit this outrage had been maintained in many Canadian written accounts of the massacre. Canadians were not only shocked that the Americans committed such a crime in their country, but now the media was putting an increased negative view on Americans. Canadians believed that Americans would continually murder people on Canadian soil. This fear was summed up by General Philip Sheridan&#x27;s infamous statement to Tosawi of the Comanche, &quot;The only good Indians I ever saw were dead.&quot;

Although Canadians also took part in the Cypress Hills Massacre, their role remains overlooked in western Canadian history. Even though it took place in Canada, the massacre represented a temporary extension of American frontier mentality into the Canadian northwest.

==In fiction==
A fictionalized account of the events of the Cypress Hills Massacre is told in the novel &quot;The Englishman&#x27;s Boy&quot; by Canadian author Guy Vanderhaeghe. The story focuses in part on the character of the &quot;Englishman&#x27;s boy&quot;, one of the members of the party of wolfers. While little is known of those involved in the actual event, the novel attributes the cause of the massacre to one Tom Hardwick, the &quot;lead&quot; wolfer. The book was made into a miniseries that first appeared on CBC Television in March 2008.

The movie &quot;The Canadians&quot; was another fictionalized version. The Cypress Hills Massacre is also used as the plot centrepiece for the Terrance Dicks novel &quot;Massacre In the Hills&quot; which charts the beginning of the NWMP.

<text>The Central neighborhood (part of the larger Powderhorn community) of Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States is located south of the downtown region of the city. It is bounded by Lake Street on the north, Chicago Avenue on the east, 38th Street on the south, and Interstate 35W on the west. It should not be confused with the Central community, which covers Downtown and some surrounding neighborhoods.

Central is split between two city council wards along Portland Avenue and 36th Street. The western portion is in Ward 8, represented by Andrea Jenkins. The eastern portion is in Ward 9, represented by Jason Chavez.

Developed mostly between 1900 and 1930, the Central neighborhood is racially diverse and has drawn African-American residents since the 1920s. Until it was closed in 1982 and later razed, Central High School was located here (Prince graduated from Central in 1976).
In 2010, the population of the neighborhood was 8,307. The neighborhood was 21.1% White, 25.1% Black or African American, 2.2% American Indian or Alaska Native, 3.6% Asian or Pacific Islander, 44.3% Hispanic or Latino, 3.4% two or more races, and 0.2% other race. The percentage of households with children was higher than the city average, and the percentage of single households was lower than the city average. The median household income was $36,988, which was $8,637 lower than the city average.

<text>Glare (derived from GLAss REinforced laminate ) is a fiber metal laminate (FML) composed of several very thin layers of metal (usually aluminum) interspersed with layers of S-2 glass-fiber &quot;pre-preg&quot;, bonded together with a matrix such as epoxy. The uni-directional pre-preg layers may be aligned in different directions to suit predicted stress conditions.

Though Glare is a composite material, its material properties and fabrication are very similar to bulk aluminum sheets. It has far less in common with composite structures when it comes to design, manufacture, inspection, or maintenance. Glare parts are constructed and repaired using mostly conventional metal working techniques.

Its major advantages over conventional aluminum are:

* Better &quot;damage tolerance&quot; behavior, especially in impact and metal fatigue. Since the elastic strain is larger than other metal materials, it can consume more impact energy. It is dented more easily but has a higher penetration resistance.
* Better corrosion resistance.
* Better fire resistance.
* Lower specific weight.

Furthermore, the material can be tailored during design and manufacture so that the number, type and alignment of layers can suit the local stresses and shapes throughout the aircraft. This allows the production of double-curved sections, complex integrated panels, or very large sheets.

While a simple manufactured sheet of Glare is three to ten times more expensive than an equivalent sheet of aluminum, considerable production savings can be made using the aforementioned optimization. A structure built with Glare is lighter and less complex than an equivalent metal structure, requires less inspection and maintenance, and has a longer &quot;lifetime-till failure&quot;. These characteristics can make Glare cheaper, lighter, and safer to use in the long run.

== History ==
Glare is a relatively successful FML, patented by the Dutch company Akzo Nobel in 1987. It entered major application in 2007, when the Airbus A380 airliner began commercial service. Much of the research and development was done in the 1970s and 1980s at the Faculty of Aerospace Engineering, Delft University of Technology, where professors and researchers advanced the knowledge of FML and earned several patents, such as a splicing technique to build wider and longer panels without requiring external joints.

The development of FML reflects a long history of research that started in 1945 at Fokker, where earlier bonding experience at de Havilland inspired investigation into the improved properties of bonded aluminum laminates compared to monolithic aluminum. Later, the United States National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) became interested in reinforcing metal parts with composite materials in the Space Shuttle program, which led to the introduction of fibers to the bond layers. Thus, the concept of FMLs was born.

Further research and co-operation of Fokker with Delft University, the Dutch aerospace laboratory NLR, 3M, Alcoa, and various other companies and institutions led to the first FML: the Aramid Reinforced ALuminum Laminates (ARALL), which combined aluminum with aramid fibers and was patented in 1981. This material had some cost, manufacturing, and application problems; while it had very high tensile strength, the material proved suboptimal in compressive strength, off-axis loading, and cyclic loading. These issues led to an improved version with glass fiber instead of aramid fibers.

Over the course of the development of the material, which took more than 30 years from start to the major application on the Airbus A380, many other production and development partners have been involved, including Boeing, McDonnell Douglas, Bombardier, and the US Air Force. Over the course of time, companies withdrew from this involvement, sometimes to come back after a couple of years. For example, Alcoa departed in 1995, returned in 2004, and withdrew again in 2010. It is alleged that disagreements between some of these partners caused Boeing to remove Glare from the cargo floor of the Boeing 777 in 1993 (before the aircraft&#x27;s service entry in 1995) and blocked Bombardier&#x27;s plans to use Glare in its CSeries aircraft in 2005. These strategic decisions show the dynamic nature of innovation processes.
== Applications ==

Glare has been most often applied in the aviation field. It forms part of the Airbus A380 fuselage and the leading edge of the tail surfaces. In 1995, an aircraft freight container made out of Glare became the first container certified by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) for blast resistance; the container can absorb and neutralize the explosion and fire from a bomb such as the one used in the Pan Am Flight 103 disaster over Lockerbie, Scotland in 1988. Glare has also been used in the front radome bulkhead of the Bombardier Learjet 45 business jet, which was first delivered in 1998. The material was used as a cargo liner solution for regional jets, in the lower skins of the flaps in the Lockheed Martin C-130J Super Hercules military transport aircraft, and in straps for the highest loaded frames in the Airbus A400M military transporter.

== Varieties and nomenclature ==
There are six standard Glare grades (Glare1 through Glare6) with typical densities ranging from , which is similar to the density of fiber. These densities are smaller than the density of 2024-T3 aluminum alloy, a common aluminum alloy in aircraft structures that is also incorporated into all but one of these Glare grades. (Glare1 uses the 7475-T761 alloy instead.) As the strength of the composite varies with fiber direction, the Glare grades differ by the number and complexity of pre-preg plies and orientations within a composite layer. Each Glare grade has A and B variants that have the same number of plies but with alternate fiber orientations. The standard Glare grades are cured in an autoclave at for 3.5 hours under , and they use the FM94 epoxy pre-preg.

A single sheet of Glare may be referred to using the naming convention . The number of aluminum layers is always one more than the number of glass fiber layers, and the aluminum layer thickness is in millimeters, which can range from . (Glare1 can only consist of aluminum layers of thickness, though.) For example, Glare4B-4/3-0.4 is a Glare sheet with a Glare4 grade (using the B variant) where there are four aluminum layers and three glass fiber layers, and the thickness of each aluminum layer is . (In contrast, a typical sheet of photocopy paper is 0.097 mm (0.004 in; 4 mils) thick, while a typical business card is 0.234 mm (0.009 in; 9 mils) thick.)

The thickness of a Glare grade does not need to be separately specified, because each pre-preg ply has a nominal thickness of , and the number of plies is already defined for a Glare grade number. Glare grades 1, 2, 3, and 6 have just two plies of glass fibers, so the thickness of an individual glass fiber layer is . Glare4 has three plies, so its glass fiber layers are each thick. Glare5 has four plies, with individual glass fiber layers of thickness. Glare sheets have typical overall thicknesses between .

Other, less common grades and designations of aluminum/glass fiber hybrids also exist. A newer class of Glare, called High Static Strength Glare (HSS Glare), incorporates the 7475-T761 alloy and cures at using FM906 epoxy pre-preg. HSS Glare comes in three grades (HSS Glare3, HSS Glare4A, and HSS Glare4B), mirroring the plies and orientations of their corresponding standard Glare grades. Russia, which at one point was going to incorporate Glare into its Irkut MS-21 narrowbody airliner, refers to its version of Glare as SIAL. The name is a translation from the Russian acronym for fiberglass and aluminum/plastic (С.И.А.Л.). It defines the grades SIAL-1 through SIAL-4, which usually contain the second-generation Russian aluminum-lithium alloy 1441 and range in density from . SIAL is used in the wing covering of the Beriev Be-103 amphibious seaplane. Airbus bases their material designations on the underlying aluminum alloy, using prefixes such as 2024-FML, 7475-FML, and 1441-FML instead of Glare and HSS Glare.

== Airbus parts production ==
Glare contributes of material to each A380 plane. This material constitutes three percent by weight of the A380 structure, which has an operating empty weight (OEW) of . Because of the ten-percent lower density of Glare compared to a typical standalone aluminum alloy, Glare&#x27;s usage on the A380 results in an estimated direct (volume-based) savings of , which doesn&#x27;t include the follow-on weight savings in the entire aircraft structure that result from the lower material weight. For example, a 1996 internal Airbus study calculated that the weight savings from Glare in the upper fuselage would be from just the lighter material, but it would total due to the &quot;snowball effects&quot; of smaller engines, smaller landing gear, and other positive changes. (However, this is much smaller than an Airbus vice president&#x27;s early claim that Glare would result in of savings, presumably if it were used throughout most of the aircraft.)

To take advantage of Glare&#x27;s higher tensile strength, is used on the upper fuselage of the front and rear sections. Glare was removed from the center upper fuselage in 2000 as shear strength precaution (although the Glare supplier felt it could have handled that area), and the fuselage underside is made of other materials with higher Young&#x27;s modulus (stiffness) values to resist buckling.

In the fuselage, Glare2A is applied to stringers, Glare2B to butt straps, and Glare3 and Glare4B to the fuselage skins. Late in the A380 development process, the plane was found to be heavier than the original specifications, so Airbus replaced conventional aluminum with Glare5 as a weight-saving measure for the leading edges of the horizontal stabilizer and the vertical stabilizer, though at great expense. The A380 Glare fuselage skin panels have a minimum thickness of but can be much thicker, as some areas of the shells may need up to 30 layers of aluminum and 29 layers of glass fiber.

Glare is currently made by GKN-Fokker and Premium AEROTEC. GKN-Fokker manufactures 22 of the 27 A380 Glare fuselage shells at its in Papendrecht, Netherlands, which uses an autoclave with a length of and a diameter of . The company produces sheets of , which incorporates the milling of door and window cutouts on a 5-axis milling machine. Premium AEROTEC manufactures the remaining five shells in Nordenham, Germany in an autoclave with a usable length of and an internal diameter of . The company also produces the Glare2A butt straps for the A400 program. Its output was per month as of 2016.

With Airbus ending production of the A380 in 2021, Glare will go out of volume production unless it is selected for another airplane manufacturing program.

== Future developments ==
Since around 2014, Airbus, its two current Glare suppliers, and Stelia Aerospace have been collaborating to manufacture Glare in a high-volume, automated production setting that will deliver larger fuselage panels for aluminum aircraft. Using robots for tape laying and other tasks, automated production will involve a single-shot bonding process that will cure aluminum, pre-preg, stringer, and doublers simultaneously in the autoclave, followed by a single nondestructive testing (NDT) cycle, instead of the stringers and doublers requiring a second bonding and NDT cycle in the existing process. The belief is that the material will reduce fuselage weight by 15 to 25 percent compared to the aluminum sections they would replace on single-aisle aircraft such as the Boeing 737 and the Airbus A320. (Before the announcement of the A380 production stoppage, the automation program was also intended to lower the weight the A380 Glare sections by at a manufacturing cost of 75% of the existing A380 Glare panels.)

To support these single-aisle aircraft production goals, GKN-Fokker planned to open an automated production line at its site in 2018, with a goal of manufacturing panels of up to in size and increasing the production rate by a factor of ten. In targeting a fifty-fold increase of Glare production capacity to per month, Premium AEROTEC planned to update its automated test cell in summer 2018 to manufacture demonstrator panels of . This size will match the largest Glare panels to be potentially used by Airbus in short-range and medium-range aircraft. The Glare automation process for prototypes reached technology readiness level (TRL) 4 in late 2016, exceeded TRL 5 as of 2018, and has an eventual target of TRL 6.

In 2014, Embraer built and tested a , technology demonstrator that was partially made of FML and was based on the central fuselage of its ERJ-145 aircraft. Later, Embraer worked with Arconic (formerly Alcoa) to build a demonstrator for a lower wing skin composed of fiber-metal laminates, which contained sheets of 2524-T3 aluminum alloy and unidirectional plies of glass fiber. Embraer built and tested the wing demonstrator to increase the TRL of the FML manufacturing process so that it can be applied to future structural applications. Lower wing skins on single-aisle aircraft are thicker than fuselage skins, measuring at least thick overall and between thick between the fuselage and the engine mount.

<text>The Gulfstream V (Model GV, pronounced &quot;G-five&quot;) is a large, long-range business jet aircraft produced by Gulfstream Aerospace, derived from the previous Gulfstream IV. It flies up to , up to and has a range. It typically accommodates four crew and 14 passengers. It first flew on November 28, 1995, and entered service in June 1997. It is used by the US military under the designation C-37A. It is followed by an improved version, the Gulfstream 550 (Model GV-SP).

==Development==
In the early 1990s, the Gulfstream V (GV) was developed as a response to the Bombardier Global Express.
It was certified on April 11, 1997.
Capable of flying up to , it rolled out in 1995 and was Gulfstream&#x27;s first ultra-long range business jet. Total production of the Gulfstream V was 193 aircraft.
By 2018, 1997-1999 Gulfstream GVs were trading at $8.8-10.25 million.
By 2019, a GV was worth around $10 million: below $6 million for a fixer to up to $13 million for a late model low-time aircraft.

==Design==
Compared to the Gulfstream IV, the engines are changed from Rolls-Royce Tay to Rolls-Royce BR700-710A1-10 with increased thrust, higher bypass ratio, and Full Authority Digital Engine Controls (FADEC). Operating ceiling is increased from . It has thrust reversers and composite flight control surfaces. The horizontal tail area is 30% larger, wingspan is increased from , the fuselage is lengthened by forward of the main entry door, and by aft of the wing. Maximum takeoff and landing weights are increased by 15%.

It has a new semi supercritical wing for a fuel capacity of more than the G-IV.
The three zone cabin is similar to the G-IV, smaller than the Global Express, while its dispatch reliability, cabin noise and fuel efficiency compare favourably against its competitors of the same era.
Compared to the comparably priced Global Express, the GV offers more range and is more fuel efficient while the Bombardier offers better runway performance, a larger cabin and a softer ride.
BR710 overhaul comes at 8,000 hour or 10 years if it comes earlier and costs $1.25 million per engine.

==Variants==

;G-V
:Production aircraft powered by two BMW-Rolls-Royce 700-710A1-10 engines.
;C-37A
:United States military designation for the G-V aircraft.
;C-20C
:Modified C-20B with enhanced, secure communications. Used to support senior-level personnel and to provide backup for Air Force One.Only 3 delivered to the Air Force in 1985 as the Reagan administration’s massive investment in “continuity of government” operations upgraded the government’s command-and-control systems. Their tail numbers were 50049, 50050 and 60403.One of three aircraft long tasked with evacuating the president in an emergency and preserving the so-called National Command Authorities, the officials with authority to launch nuclear weapons. The C-20Cs had slightly older dial-and-gauge cockpits to help protect the plane from the electromagnetic pulse that would accompany a nearby nuclear explosion. The gear aboard is top-notch, with special satellite communications networks and special classified defensive measures that would protect the plane during an attack.

==Operators==
===Civil operators===
The majority of G-Vs are operated by corporate and individual owners. Mark Cuban paid $40 million for a Gulfstream V in October 1999, earning a Guinness Record of &quot;largest single e-commerce transaction&quot;. Steve Jobs received a Gulfstream V as compensation from Apple in 2000.

On March 11, 2005, Gulfstream delivered an ultra-long-range G-V to the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR). The aircraft—known as the High-performance, Instrumented Airborne Platform for Environmental Research (HIAPER), based in Boulder, Colorado, is being used by environmental and atmospheric scientists from both public and private research facilities. The GV was chosen by NCAR for its exceptionally high cruising altitude, long range, endurance, payload, reliability, and low operating costs, as well as worldwide product support. The HIAPER Gulfstream V is modified to accept wing/pylon mounted instrumentation.
