<text>Casablanca Records is an American record label owned by Universal Music Group and operated under Republic Records. Under its founder Neil Bogart, Casablanca was most successful during the disco era of the mid to late 1970s. The label currently focuses on dance and electronic music under the direction of Brett Alperowitz.

== History ==
Neil Bogart (originally Bogatz until adopting the name of his favorite actor Humphrey Bogart) founded Casablanca Records after departing of Buddah Records due to clashes with its owners. In 1973 Bogart enticed Warner Bros. Records into financing Casablanca. Due to Warner&#x27;s ownership of all rights to the film &quot;Casablanca,&quot; Bogart&#x27;s adoption of the movie&#x27;s name and title look for its records label logo went without legal objection. The label&#x27;s first signing was Kiss but its first single release was Bill Amesbury&#x27;s &quot;Virginia (Touch Me Like You Do)&quot;, a minor hit on the US Hot 100. &quot;Butter Boy&quot; by Fanny and The Hudson Brothers&#x27; &quot;So You Are a Star&quot; proved to be Casablanca&#x27;s first Billboard Top 40 hits.

Warner Bros. developed doubts about Casablanca&#x27;s viability, in particular with the signing of Kiss. Bogart&#x27;s brashness also did not help relations or gain much support for his acts and releases which had only modest success. Warner head Mo Ostin ceded Bogart full ownership of the label.

The now-independent Casablanca Records was suddenly put in a tenuous financial situation as it still had yet to score a major hit album and no longer had the backing of Warner Bros. Casablanca was banking on the success of an upcoming album it was planning: a two-record set of audio highlights from television&#x27;s &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot;. The album was entitled &quot;Here&#x27;s Johnny: Magic Moments from The Tonight Show&quot; and was released in November 1974. Although the album was certified gold by the RIAA for shipments to stores of over 500,000 copies, the album did not sell well, and returns from retailers of unsold copies were high. Even the promotional copies were returned, initiating the joke that it shipped Gold and went back to the label Platinum. Casablanca had realized that even though &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot; was immensely popular, the show did not carry over well to recordings.

By mid-1975, Casablanca was almost bankrupt, and desperately needed a commercial breakthrough if they were to survive. That breakthrough came in an unlikely form: a double live album &quot;Alive!&quot; (1975). It became both Casablanca&#x27;s and Kiss&#x27;s first top ten album.

Casablanca eventually became one of the most successful American labels of the 1970s, signing and releasing records by such acts as Kiss, Donna Summer, Village People, Cher, Lipps Inc. (with lead vocalist Cynthia Johnson), and George Clinton&#x27;s Parliament. In 1976, the label merged with indie-film company Filmworks, Inc. headed by founder, Peter Guber to form Casablanca Record and FilmWorks, Inc., which had hits with the movies &quot;The Deep&quot; and &quot;Midnight Express.&quot;

In 1977, PolyGram acquired a 50% stake in Casablanca for $15 million then it purchased the remaining half in 1980. Also that year, one of the label&#x27;s biggest acts, Donna Summer, departed to Geffen Records as she and Casablanca failed to agree on her musical direction for the future. That same year, PolyGram pushed Bogart out of Casablanca due to what it viewed as the label&#x27;s overspending and accounting irregularities. The film division was separated from the label and renamed PolyGram Pictures. In the early 1980s, with Bogart no longer heading the label, Casablanca had hits with acts Lipps Inc., Stephanie Mills, Cameo (on sister label Chocolate City Records), The Four Tops, Mac Davis and Irene Cara but it did not achieve the same level of success it had enjoyed in the 1970s. The label was eventually shut down by PolyGram with some of the artist roster and catalog absorbed into sister label, Mercury Records.

In 1999, PolyGram (including its subsidiaries) was purchased by Seagram and then merged with Seagram&#x27;s MCA Music Entertainment Group to form the Universal Music Group. In 2000, the Casablanca Records name was revived for a joint venture between Universal Music Group and Tommy Mottola. In a &quot;Billboard&quot; article, Mottola said that he chose the name as a homage to the original label but that there was no connection between the old and new labels. Casablanca is currently a dance and electronic label under Republic Records headed by GM, Brett Alperowitz, who on April 13, 2021, was also named EVP of A&amp;R by Republic Records&#x27; president of West Coast creative, Wendy Goldstein.

== Notable artists ==

=== Kiss ===
Kiss was the first band to sign to Casablanca. The label had released three albums by Kiss: &quot;Kiss&quot; (1974), &quot;Hotter Than Hell&quot; (1974), and &quot;Dressed to Kill&quot; (1975), but all had failed to make a big impact on the charts. The label also did not experience heavy sales with albums by Angel, who was introduced to the label by Gene Simmons of Kiss, although that glam rock band did amass a cult following. The label was on the verge of bankruptcy when Bogart decided to release a live album by Kiss. Although the band&#x27;s studio albums had not been strong sellers, the band had a reputation for performing exciting shows. Casablanca decided to try to capitalize on that reputation by releasing the double-live &quot;Alive!&quot; (1975) album. It became both Casablanca&#x27;s and Kiss&#x27;s first top ten album and was certified gold. Kiss&#x27;s follow-up studio albums to &quot;Alive!&quot; were better sellers than its previous studio albums. &quot;Destroyer&quot; (1976), &quot;Rock and Roll Over&quot; (1976), and &quot;Love Gun&quot; (1977) were all certified platinum in the United States. Other successful late 1970s Kiss albums on Casablanca were &quot;Alive II&quot;, &quot;Double Platinum&quot;, the band&#x27;s four solo albums and &quot;Dynasty&quot;. Their less successful early 1980s works here were &quot;Unmasked&quot; and &quot;Music from &quot;The Elder&quot;&quot;. The band&#x27;s last studio album on Casablanca was &quot;Creatures of the Night&quot; in 1982.

=== Cher ===
Cher had two records signed for Casablanca, &quot;Take Me Home&quot; and &quot;Prisoner&quot;. Both records were hit records, especially in Europe. The main single &quot;Take Me Home&quot; debuted at #25 on Billboard 200, although the albums were not critically acclaimed for running out of Cher&#x27;s music style, it were well received by the public. The album &quot;Take Me Home&quot; received Gold certification in the US and is considered one of Cher&#x27;s best albums, as it was her first Disco record.
To promote the album, Cher recorded a music video for &quot;Take Me Home&quot; which was used as part of an exclusive TV special called &quot;Cher... and Other Fantasies&quot;. She also performed &quot;Take Me Home&quot; along with other two album tracks &quot;Love &amp; Pain&quot; and &quot;Happy Was the Day We Met&quot; on &quot;The Mike Douglas Show&quot;. In 1979 Cher embarked on her first solo tour, the Take Me Home Tour, which was highly successful with two dates of the show recorded for broadcast, in Monte Carlo and at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas. For the latter performance, Cher was awarded &quot;Best Actress in a Variety Program&quot; at the 1983 CableACE Awards.

=== Parliament ===
Parliament was signed to Casablanca in 1973 due to Bogart&#x27;s long-standing relationship with group leader George Clinton. Their relationship dated to Bogart&#x27;s period at Buddah Records. Their first release for the label was in 1974 with the album &quot;Up for the Down Stroke&quot;. The title song from the album gave Parliament its first top ten R&amp;B hit. Their next album, &quot;Chocolate City&quot;, sold approximately 150,000 albums in the Washington, D.C. area alone. But it was their next release, &quot;Mothership Connection&quot;, that gave the group its first gold and platinum album. Parliament achieved either gold or platinum status with each album release from 1975 to 1979. The group&#x27;s hit singles included &quot;Give Up the Funk (Tear the Roof off the Sucker)&quot;, &quot;Flash Light&quot; (Casablanca&#x27;s first R&amp;B number one hit) and &quot;Aqua Boogie (A Psychoalphadiscobetabioaquadoloop)&quot;. The success of Parliament allowed George Clinton to develop another P-Funk spin-off act known as Parlet. Casablanca bankrolled the extravagant P-Funk stage shows, including the &quot;Mothership Connection/P-Funk Earth Tour&quot; of 1976–77 and the Motor Booty Affair underwater tour of 1979. Parliament and its sister band Funkadelic was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

=== Donna Summer ===
In 1975, Casablanca signed Donna Summer and released her album &quot;Love to Love You Baby&quot; which was certified gold. Summer had several gold and platinum albums on Casablanca in 1975–1979 and was the label&#x27;s most successful act on the singles chart. She recorded eight Top 5 singles in a 19-month period. Summer had 10 gold singles, 2 platinum singles and a gold maxi-single with Casablanca. Summer was called in the American press &quot;The First Lady of Love&quot;, a name that she disliked but that Casablanca marketed with great success. She was also called &quot;The Queen of Disco&quot;. Her hits included the number ones &quot;MacArthur Park&quot;, &quot;No More Tears (Enough Is Enough)&quot; duet with Barbra Streisand, the Grammy-winning &quot;Bad Girls&quot;, the Oscar, Golden Globe and Grammy-winning &quot;Last Dance&quot;, the Grammy-winning number one &quot;Hot Stuff&quot;, and the hit single, &quot;I Feel Love&quot;, co-written and produced by Giorgio Moroder. Her album &quot;Bad Girls&quot; achieved triple-platinum status. The label followed it with a greatest hits collection entitled &quot;On the Radio: Greatest Hits Volumes I &amp; II&quot;, which was certified double platinum and was Summer&#x27;s last album on Casablanca. She recorded three double-albums that reached the top of the charts in a 14-month period.

=== Village People ===
Village People is an American disco group best known for their on-stage costumes, catchy tunes and suggestive lyrics. The group was originally formed by French producers Jacques Morali, Henri Belolo and lead singer Victor Willis following the release of the 1977 debut album, &quot;Village People&quot;, which targeted disco&#x27;s gay audience. The group&#x27;s name refers to New York City&#x27;s Greenwich Village, at the time known for its large gay population, The characters were a symbolic group of gay and macho fantasy personas. The group quickly became popular and moved into the mainstream, scoring several disco and dance hits internationally under the label, including the hit singles &quot;Macho Man&quot;, &quot;In the Navy&quot;, &quot;Go West&quot; and their biggest hit, &quot;Y.M.C.A.&quot;

=== Lipps, Inc. ===
In 1979 Lipps Inc., with Steven Greenberg as writer, producer, and musician, and Cynthia Johnson on lead vocals, signed with Casablanca. The single &quot;Rock It&quot; was released, followed by the album &quot;Mouth to Mouth&quot;. The album included the No. 1 hit &quot;Funkytown&quot;, which spent four weeks atop both the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and the Hot Dance Music/Club Play charts in the United States. The 7&quot; single sold over two million copies within a few months and was awarded a platinum record within the same year of its release. It reached No. 2 in the United Kingdom and was a hit throughout the world.

=== Lindsay Lohan ===
Lindsay Lohan signed on to the label in 2004, under the management of Tommy Mottola. She released her debut studio album, &quot;Speak&quot; in December 2004, peaking at number 4 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and eventually earning Platinum certification. &quot;Speak&quot; spawned Lohan&#x27;s first single, &quot;Rumors&quot;. Detailing Lohan&#x27;s complaints with the paparazzi, &quot;Rumors&quot; eventually earned gold certification, as well as a nomination for Best Pop Video at the 2005 MTV Video Music Awards. Lohan released her second album, &quot;A Little More Personal (Raw)&quot; in December 2005. The album peaked at number 20 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, gaining gold certification in early 2006. The first and only single from the album, &quot;Confessions of a Broken Heart (Daughter to Father)&quot;, peaked at number 57 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, making it Lohan&#x27;s first single to debut on the chart. The song documents the problems Lohan has had in her family life, and the music video, which Lohan herself directed, features her younger sister Aliana.

=== Mika ===
Mika&#x27;s debut single, &quot;Relax, Take It Easy&quot;, was released in 2006. His second single, &quot;Grace Kelly&quot;, was released in January 2007 and debuted at number one on the UK Singles Chart, followed by his debut album, &quot;Life in Cartoon Motion&quot;, in February 2007.

== Other events ==
Casablanca started a subsidiary label in 1975 called Chocolate City Records. It was mainly overseen by Bogart&#x27;s partner Cecil Holmes. The label focused on R&amp;B, funk, and disco releases. Chocolate City&#x27;s signings included the then-new act Cameo and veteran act Brenda &amp; the Tabulations.

From 1976 to 1979, Casablanca also had another subsidiary label called Parachute Records. The label was run by former Motown Records promoter and Uni Records CEO Russ Regan. Artists signed to the label included singer Randy Brown, the heavily sampled disco group 7th Wonder, and songwriter-author-poet Shel Silverstein, who recorded one album for the label—1978&#x27;s &quot;Songs and Stories&quot;.

The offices of Casablanca moved into the former A&amp;M Records offices on Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles. Casablanca&#x27;s new offices were soon remodeled after the movie set of the film of the same name. Later, the record company merged with an indie production company called Filmworks, Inc., which was founded by former Columbia Pictures executive Peter Guber. The new company became known as Casablanca Record and Filmworks, with Bogart still at its helm as president, while Guber became chairman of the board and head of its film division. Guber would remain with the company for two years. In 1977, PolyGram acquired a 50% stake in the independent Casablanca, which had been quite successful for several years.

Casablanca remained very successful throughout the rest of the 1970s. But the label&#x27;s rise and fall would both be dramatic instances. The rise came with the success of several acts such as Donna Summer, Kiss, Parliament, and Village People, as well as some success from its subsidiary label and its film division. The fall began when the 1980s rolled in. The label was known to spend lavish amounts of money on parties, events, and promotion. Although this resulted in hit albums and singles, the profit margin suffered due to the carefree spending by the label. Casablanca spent lavish amounts of money on promoting its releases, which made its artists happy, but not necessarily PolyGram, which now owned a 50% stake in the label. When Casablanca&#x27;s lavish spending habits were realized by PolyGram, it quickly made an offer to purchase the other 50% of Casablanca in 1980. Bogart accepted; however, he soon found out he would not be allowed to stay with Casablanca, and PolyGram released him from his post. He used the money he acquired from the sale to start Boardwalk Records and he signed then-new rocker Joan Jett, who had experienced some success in Japan as a member of the group The Runaways. Bogart died from cancer in 1982 and Boardwalk Records folded.

== Post-Bogart years ==
Casablanca was not as successful without Bogart running the company. Its only notable releases from 1980 onward were the Robin Williams debut comedy LP &quot;Reality, What A Concept!&quot; (1981), the soundtrack to the movie &quot;Flashdance&quot; (1983), and the final three Kiss LP&#x27;s on Casablanca: &quot;Unmasked&quot;, &quot;Music from &quot;The Elder&quot;&quot;, and &quot;Creatures of the Night&quot;. Dusty Springfield&#x27;s sole release on Casablanca, 1982&#x27;s &quot;White Heat&quot;, came and went with little notice due to the label&#x27;s mounting internal problems. The most successful act on the label during the 1980s was R&amp;B singer Stephanie Mills, who came to the label after PolyGram bought the 20th Century Fox Records label and absorbed its artists and back catalog into Casablanca. The last album released by the label was Animotion&#x27;s &quot;Strange Behavior&quot; in 1986, which was a modest seller. By that time, PolyGram had folded Casablanca Records, moving some of its acts to Mercury Records and dropping others.

== Official book ==
In 2009, Casablanca co-founder Larry Harris released an insider&#x27;s history, written with Curt Gooch, of the label with a book entitled &quot;And Party Every Day: The Inside Story of Casablanca Records&quot;.

== 2000 relaunch ==
In 1998, Seagram purchased PolyGram and merged it with MCA Inc. to create the Universal Music Group. Upon the merger, the original (pre-2000) Casablanca Records music catalog became a part of The Island Def Jam Music Group, which folded in 2014. Reissues from the catalog became the responsibility of Island Records.

In 2000, Universal and Tommy Mottola, who had served as CEO of Sony Music Entertainment and Columbia Records throughout the 1990s, partnered to launch a new record label that would be headed by Mottola and be part of the Universal Records Group. Mottola chose the name Casablanca, in homage to the Casablanca Records once run by Bogart. The label&#x27;s first release was to be a girl-group first known as &quot;iNK&quot;, but which later changed its name to &quot;NSS (Not So Sweet) 16&quot;. The group, however, disbanded due to internal problems. NSS16&#x27;s only single OopDeeWopDee was produced by hit music producer and Grammy award winner Greg Lawson and directed by Hakeem Khaaliq.

Some of Casablanca&#x27;s releases included albums by Lindsay Lohan in 2004, albums by Lohan and Brie Larson in 2005, and music by Mika in 2007, who scored a hit with the song &quot;Relax, Take It Easy&quot;. Mottola&#x27;s label once again become inactive when Lohan and Larson moved to other labels within the Universal family.

In the fall of 2009, Casablanca became active again (albeit in name only) with the releases of Mika&#x27;s second album, &quot;The Boy Who Knew Too Much&quot;, and Ryan Leslie&#x27;s second album, &quot;Transition&quot;.

<text>San Diego Bay is a natural harbor and deepwater port in San Diego County, California, near the Mexico–United States border. The bay, which is long and wide, is the third largest of the three large, protected natural bays on California&#x27;s of coastline, after San Francisco Bay and Humboldt Bay. The highly urbanized land adjacent to the bay includes the city of San Diego and four other cities: National City, Chula Vista, Imperial Beach and Coronado. The bay is considered to be one of the premier natural harbors on the West Coast.

San Diego Bay was colonized by Spain beginning in 1769. It served as the base headquarters of major ships of the United States Navy in the Pacific until just before the United States entered World War II, when the newly organized United States Pacific Fleet primary base was transferred to Pearl Harbor. The bay remains as a home port of major assets, including several aircraft carriers of the United States Pacific Fleet. As a result of base closures beginning in the 1980s, facilities in San Diego Bay are the only remaining major naval base facilities still in operation in California.

==Ports==

The Port of San Diego has two container ship facilities (one for refrigerated containers) and a cruise ship terminal. A second cruise ship terminal opened in December 2010. The port handles more than 3 million metric tons of cargo yearly. The cruise ship terminal hosted more than 250 ship calls a year totaling more than 800,000 passengers at its peak in 2008; since then the number of ship calls has fallen to fewer than 100 per year due to the withdrawal of regular service by major cruise lines.

General Dynamics&#x27; National Steel and Shipbuilding Company (NASSCO), a shipyard capable of building and repairing large ocean-going vessels, is near the San Diego side of the San Diego–Coronado Bridge. San Diego International Airport is also adjacent to the bay, across Harbor Drive from the Coast Guard Station.

==San Diego–Coronado Bridge==
The bay is spanned by the San Diego–Coronado Bridge, built-in 1969. The bridge curves and rises to a height of 200 feet above the water so that Navy ships can pass under it. (However, the vertical clearance is insufficient for &quot;Nimitz&quot;-class aircraft carriers, which is why these are docked north of the bridge.) The bridge was originally a toll bridge; however, toll collection was discontinued in 2002, when the bridge&#x27;s construction loans were paid in full.

==America&#x27;s Cup Harbor==
Formerly known as Commercial Basin and housing much of San Diego&#x27;s sport and commercial fishing fleet, the small cove in the southern lee of Shelter Island was renamed in 1994 to America&#x27;s Cup Harbor, in honor of the 1995 America&#x27;s Cup races held in San Diego. America&#x27;s Cup Harbor has several boat yards and marinas for private sailing yachts, as well as a mooring field.

==Recreation==

Numerous resorts, hotels, and the San Diego Convention Center are adjacent to the bay. Several parks and nature preserves are found at various locations along the shoreline. Sightseeing boats depart from the downtown area. Commercial sport fishing and whale watching tours depart from Shelter Island.

Ten museum ships call San Diego Bay home. They include USS &quot;Midway&quot;, an aircraft carrier museum, and &quot;Star of India&quot;, the oldest iron-hulled merchant ship afloat and the world&#x27;s oldest active sailing ship. &quot;Star of India&quot; and eight other ships and boats on San Diego Bay are the floating collection of the Maritime Museum of San Diego; they are open to the public for a fee, and many are in sailing condition.

In the northern part of the bay, there are two commercial &quot;islands&quot; (actually peninsulas connected to the mainland by a narrow strip of land) called Harbor Island and Shelter Island. They were built up from former sand bars and now hold hotels, restaurants, marinas, and public parkland. Across from Harbor Island is a bayside park called Spanish Landing, a historic site which commemorates the meeting in 1769 of two expeditions from Spanish Mexico that made possible the European settlement of California. Spanish Landing Park is the site of San Salvador Village, where the Maritime Museum of San Diego is constructing a full-sized, fully functional wooden replica of the San Salvador flagship, in which explorer Juan Rodriguez Cabrillo discovered San Diego Bay in 1542.

Small boat sailing is extremely popular, and the bay is lined by dozens of marinas and nine yacht clubs, including San Diego Yacht Club which was the home of the America&#x27;s Cup from 1988 to 1995. An inlet of the bay was renamed America&#x27;s Cup Harbor to commemorate that occasion.

===Special events===
An annual fireworks display called Big Bay Boom is held on the Fourth of July over the waters of the bay. Fireworks are launched simultaneously from four barges in the bay as well as from a pier in Imperial Beach. It is one of the largest annual fireworks displays in the United States and is viewed by half a million people each year.

The Parade of Lights is a parade of more than 80 small boats with holiday decorations and lights on two Sundays in December. The parade has been held annually since 1972. The parade starts off Shelter Island and proceeds past Harbor Island and downtown, finishing at the Coronado ferry landing.

A one-time special event was the &quot;Parade of Flight&quot; in February 2011, celebrating the 100th anniversary of naval aviation. It featured flights over San Diego Bay by more than 200 historic naval aircraft, and concluded with a flyover by the air wing from the U.S.S. John C. Stennis.

==Naval facilities==

The western border of the bay is protected from the Pacific Ocean by a long, narrow strip of land called Silver Strand. The northern end of Silver Strand expands to become North Island, the location of Naval Air Station North Island (the home port of several aircraft carriers including USS &quot;Theodore Roosevelt&quot;) and Coronado. Coronado is the site of the famous Hotel del Coronado. The U.S. Navy has three other facilities on the bay: Naval Base San Diego, Naval Base Point Loma, and Naval Amphibious Base Coronado. Coast Guard Air Station San Diego is across the bay from NAS North Island and the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) maintains a monitoring station on Silver Strand. Several other Navy facilities are located in the surrounding area, and even more, existed previously but have since been closed. The U.S. Marine Corps also operates Marine Corps Recruit Depot San Diego near the shores of San Diego Bay.

==Ecology==

The shallow southern end of the bay is used for evaporation ponds to extract salt from the seawater. The salt ponds, Sweetwater Marsh, and other areas of the bay are included in the San Diego National Wildlife Refuge Complex. The area includes the largest contiguous mud-flat in Southern California. It is an important stop on the Pacific Flyway for migrating birds, and it supports numerous endangered and threatened species of plants and animals. Public access to the bay and wetlands, with walking trails and educational exhibits about the area&#x27;s ecological resources, is provided at the Chula Vista Nature Center operated by the city of Chula Vista. San Diego Bay is recognized for protection by the California Bays and Estuaries Policy. As early as the 1840s whales were documented in the bay during the winter, with as many as fifteen seen in the bay in 1872; in 1858 whaling stations began to operate in San Diego, having ended operations as late as 1886.

===Pollution===
Sources of pollution in the bay include storm-water runoff and marine waste from commercial and military shipping and shipbuilding. The city of San Diego has spent millions of dollars trying to clean up this pollution, particularly at the section of the eastern shoreline referred to as the Shipyards Sediment Site. In 2009 the city and the San Diego Unified Port Authority filed suit against several major shipping companies to recoup some of the cost of those remediation efforts. In 2014 the city reached an agreement with the San Diego Regional Water Control Board to pay a fine of nearly $1 million for storm-water violations. In 2015, the city and the Port filed suit against Monsanto, whose products containing polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are blamed for pollution of the bay and tidelands.

The California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment (OEHHA) has developed a safe eating advisory for fish caught in the bay based on levels of mercury or PCBs found in local species.

==Management==
The Port of San Diego manages the harbor and administers the public lands adjacent to the bay. It is a special government entity created by the state legislature in 1962, for which revenue consists of tariffs and rents paid by district tenants.

==Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo==
San Diego Bay (called the &quot;port of San Diego&quot;) is referenced in the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo as the westernmost of the landmarks used in the resolution of the Mexico–United States border following the Mexican–American War. The border is defined as being &quot;one marine league&quot; (3 nautical miles, 3.452 mi. or 5.556 km) &quot;due south of the southernmost point&quot; of the bay.

<doc id="922069" wikidata="Q6750153" url="?curid=922069" title="Manitoba Reform Party">
<text>The Manitoba Reform Party was a right-wing political party in Manitoba, Canada in the early 1990s. It was known as the Manitoba Confederation of Regions Party (CoR) in the provincial elections of 1986, 1988 and 1990.

==Confederation of Regions==
The Manitoba Confederation of Regions Party was the provincial branch of the Confederation of Regions Party of Canada, a right-wing organization which sought greater autonomy for Western Canada. Unlike the Western Canada Concept and the Western Independence Party, the CoR did not advocate full independence for the western provinces. The national party leader was Elmer Knutson; its original provincial leader was Douglas Edmondson.

The Manitoba CoR was founded in 1984, as a result of public controversy over New Democratic Party Premier Howard Pawley&#x27;s attempts to entrench francophone services in the province. The CoR opposed any expansion of French language rights.

The national CoR Party polled surprisingly well in the 1984 federal election in Manitoba, placing second to the Progressive Conservatives in three rural anglophone ridings. The party, as such, hoped to elect candidates to the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba in the general election of 1986.

The party ran 15 candidates in 1986, and managed to place second in four rural ridings (Arthur, Gladstone, Pembina and Rhineland). None of the CoR&#x27;s candidates came close to victory; Dennis Heeney, who had replaced Edmondson as leader, placed third in Minnedosa.

The CoR ran 14 candidates in 1988. Despite a high-profile endorsement of the party from former Premier Douglas Campbell, no candidate placed higher than a distant third. Dennis Heeney appears to have stepped down as party leader following the election.

In 1990, only five candidates ran under the CoR banner. Irene Armishaw was the party&#x27;s president. Armishaw received the largest number of votes of any of the party&#x27;s candidates—486 votes in the rural riding of Lakeside.

== Reform Party ==
In April 1991, the Manitoba CoR changed its name to the &quot;Manitoba Reform Party&quot; after a mail-in referendum among party members conducted in March and April, in which 67% of the respondents were said to have favoured the change. (The Manitoba CoR had 65-70 members by this time.)

The new name brought about a lawsuit from the Reform Party of Canada, which had no formal connection to the Manitoba group. National CoR leader Elmer Knutson was also opposed to the change. Manitoba Reformers argued that as no other group had applied to use the name on a provincial level. The Court of Appeals in Manitoba determined in 1991 that party&#x27;s use of the word &quot;Reform&quot; at the provincial level was legal.

In February 1992, the Manitoba Reform Party ejected four &quot;rebels&quot; who had accused the national leadership of having lost touch with the grassroots membership. About 78 percent of members who voted, voted to remove the four Reformers, who were from St James, Winnipeg South, and St Boniface.

In September 1992, the Manitoba Reform Party contested two provincial by-elections. Ken Carver received 97 votes in Crescentwood, and anti-bilingualism activist Fred Debrecen received 388 votes in Portage la Prairie.

The party was registered with Elections Manitoba for the 1995 provincial election, but did not run any candidates. Its subsequent history is unclear.

In 1997, the Manitoba Reform Party championed tax cuts during the federal election campaign, arguing that its plan, which included benefits for low-income families, was superior to the 10% across-the-board tax cut proposed by the Tories.

<doc id="922077" wikidata="Q3796124" url="?curid=922077" title="His Majesty O'Keefe">
<text>His Majesty O&#x27;Keefe is a 1954 American adventure film directed by Byron Haskin and starring Burt Lancaster. The cast also included Joan Rice, André Morell, Abraham Sofaer, Archie Savage, and Benson Fong. The screenplay by Borden Chase and James Hill was based on the novel of the same name by Laurence Klingman and Gerald Green (1952).

== Plot ==
Captain David O&#x27;Keefe, seeking his fortune in the 19th century South Pacific, decides to enlist island natives to harvest copra, but runs into a wall of cultural problems. Backed by a Chinese dentist, he obtains a ship and sets about harvesting copra while fending off cantankerous native chieftains and ambitious German empire-builders. The natives, happy with their existence, see no reason to work hard to obtain copra, either for a German trading company or for O&#x27;Keefe. He finally motivates them by showing them how to produce large quantities of Rai stones, the stone money of Yap, and their valued coinage.

== Cast ==
== Historical basis ==

The story is based on the life of a sailor named David O&#x27;Keefe who in 1871 was shipwrecked on Yap in the Caroline Islands, where he found the natives highly prized Rai stones quarried at great effort and danger on the island of Palau. He organized the natives to produce the large stone disks by employing modern methods and then used them to buy copra for coconut oil. The stones he produced were not valued as highly as those obtained by traditional methods due to the lack of personal sacrifice in their production, and the effect of an inflationary over-production.

== Production ==
=== Original book ===
O&#x27;Keefe&#x27;s life was turned into a 1950 book by Lawrence Klingman and Gerard Green. The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; said the writers did &quot;a magnificent job&quot;. The &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; called it a &quot;well told story&quot;. The &quot;New York Times&quot; called it &quot;interesting&quot; and &quot;curious&quot;.

=== Development ===
Film rights were optioned in December 1950 by Norma Productions, the company of Harold Hecht and Burt Lancaster.

In April 1951 Lancaster announced Fred Zinnemann would direct. Lancaster was very busy at this time in his career and the film was not made immediately. In January 1952 Frank Nugent was reported as working on the script. In May 1952 Byron Haskin signed to direct.

The film would be the last in a three-picture deal between Norma Productions and Warner Bros. The others had been &quot;The Flame and the Arrow&quot; and &quot;The Crimson Pirate&quot;.

== Preproduction ==
Haskin arrived in Sydney, Australia in June 1952 and five Australian actors had roles in the supporting cast, including Lloyd Berrell, Guy Doleman, Muriel Steinbeck, Grant Taylor and Harvey Adams.

Max Osbiston was offered a role but turned it down due to his film commitments.

Later in June Haskin moved to Fiji where the bulk of the movie was shot.

The film was made with &quot;frozen&quot; English funds, so many English technicians and cast were used and it was decided to shoot on location in Fiji, a British colony at the time.

Joan Rice was cast in July 1952.

=== Shooting ===
Filming took four months, mostly on location in the South Pacific in Fiji – not Yap. Also, indigenous people and customs/dances portrayed in the movie were Fijian.

The choreographer was Daniel Nagrin.

The unit was based at the Beachcomber Hotel at Deuba Beach in Viti Levu. The entire village of Goloa five miles west of the hotel was rented. Two miles east of Deuba the unit built a temporary sound stage as well as a darkroom and lab. The village was handed over to the locals after the unit left

&quot;I can&#x27;t say that we&#x27;d ever want to remake &quot;O&#x27;Keefe&quot;,&quot; said Lancaster later. &quot;It was so tough working in the humidity that one day I actually watched fungus grow on my clothes. Every day blazing sun or tropical rain beat down upon us and at night there were always mosquitos.&quot;

Haskin spoke highly of Australian actors saying:
American actors are hothouse plants by comparison because they don&#x27;t have such an exacting apprenticeship as Australian radio and repertory give. Few of the unknowns we try out can pick up any script and do any kind of part with out rehearsal. But your boys can. And they don&#x27;t mess about. Put them up in front of a camera and they get on with what&#x27;s required of them.
Filming finished in November 1952.

== Reception ==
The film was popular. According to &quot;Kinematograph Weekly&quot; the film was a &quot;money maker&quot; at the British box office in 1954.

However Warner Bros were unhappy by the fact it went over budget. Hecht and Lancaster later welcomed &quot;His Majesty O&#x27;Keefe&quot;&#x27;s screenwriter, James Hill, as an equal partner and renamed their company Hecht-Hill-Lancaster Productions in 1956.

== Legacy ==
The film prompted Guy Doleman to go to Hollywood.

Director Byron Haskin later returned to Australia to make &quot;Long John Silver&quot; (1954).

<text>Rare Earth is an American rock band from Detroit, Michigan. According to &quot;Louder&quot;, &quot;Rare Earth&#x27;s music straddles genres and defies categorisation, slipping seamlessly between the two seemingly disparate worlds of classic rock and R&amp;B.&quot; The band was signed to Motown&#x27;s subsidiary label Rare Earth. Although not the first white band signed to Motown, Rare Earth was the first successful act signed by Motown that consisted only of white members.

==History==
===1960s===
The group formed in 1960 as the Sunliners and changed its name to Rare Earth in 1968. The band felt the name &quot;Rare Earth&quot; was more in keeping with the names other bands were adopting, such as Iron Butterfly, more &quot;with it&quot;.

After recording an unsuccessful debut album, &quot;Dream/Answers&quot;, on the Verve label in 1968, the group was signed to Motown in 1969. The band was one of the first acts signed to a new Motown imprint that would be dedicated to white rock acts; many of the subsidiary&#x27;s newly signed acts played blues-oriented and progressive rock styles, including Rare Earth themselves. The record company did not have a name for the new label yet and the band jokingly suggested Motown call the label &quot;Rare Earth&quot;. To the band&#x27;s surprise, Motown decided to do just that.

The main personnel in the group were Gil Bridges, saxophone, flute, vocals; Peter Hoorelbeke (aka Peter Rivera), lead vocals, drums; John Parrish (aka John Persh), bass guitar, trombone, vocals; Rod Richards (born Rod Cox), guitar, vocals; and Kenny James (born Ken Folcik), keyboards. The group&#x27;s recording style was hard-driving.

In late 1969, Edward &quot;Eddie&quot; Guzman (congas and assorted percussive instruments) was added to the group.

During 1969, the group contributed music to the film &quot;Generation&quot; that starred David Janssen and Kim Darby. An accompanying soundtrack album was released, but quickly withdrawn after the film failed commercially, with only a small number of copies sold. Several tracks were remixed and included on the next LP, &quot;Ecology&quot;, in 1970. The soundtrack album was reissued as a limited edition LP for Record Store Day 2020. The issue was pressed on hot pink vinyl and limited to a run of 2,000 copies.

===1970s===
Rare Earth had a number of top 40 hits in 1970–71, including remakes of the Temptations&#x27; &quot;(I Know) I&#x27;m Losing You&quot; and &quot;Get Ready&quot;. Each was more successful than the Temptations original, with &quot;Get Ready&quot; being their biggest hit, peaking at number 4 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart. This disc sold over one million copies and received a gold record awarded by the Recording Industry Association of America.
The group gained a bit of notoriety when it was mentioned dismissively in Gil Scott-Heron&#x27;s 1970 poem, &quot;The Revolution Will Not Be Televised&quot;, which included the line, &quot;The theme song [to the revolution] will not be written by Jim Webb, Francis Scott Key, nor sung by Glen Campbell, Tom Jones, Johnny Cash, Engelbert Humperdinck, or the Rare Earth.&quot;

In 1971, Richards left due to musical differences, and James, weary of the group&#x27;s increased touring schedule, also departed. Ray Monette (guitar) and Mark Olson (keyboards, vocals) joined to replace them.

The group&#x27;s hits from late 1970 to early 1972 were &quot;Born to Wander&quot; (number 17), &quot;I Just Want to Celebrate&quot; (number 7), and &quot;Hey, Big Brother&quot; (number 19). There were no significant hits thereafter. Nevertheless, the band continued to record into the 1990s.

By 1972, Motown had decided to relocate from Detroit to Los Angeles and Rare Earth soon followed suit. Persh, however, decided not to make the move and was succeeded in the band by Mike Urso (Persh died from a hospital staphylococcal infection on January 27, 1981). NBC reported that, at about this time, the police found &quot;reputed mob enforcer&quot; Joe Ulloa started financing the band, which seems to have resulted in the band members being eventually harassed by &quot;strangers&quot; several years later asking if they were hiding money.

Their 1973 album, &quot;Ma&quot;, written and produced by Norman Whitfield, is considered one of their best overall works, and features their version of &quot;Hum Along and Dance&quot;. But the record did not sell well, and produced no hits.

Rare Earth was the opening act at California Jam festival in Ontario, California on April 6, 1974. The festival attracted over 250,000 people, and the band appeared alongside 1970s rock groups Black Sabbath; Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer; Deep Purple; Earth, Wind &amp; Fire; Seals and Crofts; Black Oak Arkansas and Eagles. Portions of the show were broadcast on ABC Television in the U.S., exposing the band to a wider audience.

In 1974, the group began working with Motown producer Frank Wilson, was short lived. The Frank Wilson sessions, which would have been the follow-up to &quot;Ma&quot;, were mainly completed but remained in the vaults of Motown. A proposed double live record, recorded in 1974, and another live set, &quot;Live in Chicago&quot;, were also shelved.

In July 1974, the group divided. Mike Urso left the group along with Hoorelbeke and they formed a new band, HUB, with Rare Earth&#x27;s 1970–1972 co-producer, Tom Baird, using the initials of their surnames (Hoorelbeke, Urso and Baird). HUB went on to record two albums for Capitol Records but produced no hits. The project came to a sudden end in November 1975 after Baird was killed in a boating accident. 
The rest of the band (minus Olson, who left to join the backup band for Jennifer Warnes) decided to continue as Rare Earth and brought in new players: Jerry LaCroix (vocals, sax, harmonica, formerly of the Boogie Kings, Edgar Winter&#x27;s White Trash and Blood, Sweat &amp; Tears), Paul Warren (guitar, backing vocals), Bartholomew (&quot;Frosty&quot;) Eugene Smith-Frost (formerly with Sweathog and Lee Michaels, drums), Reggie McBride (ex-Stevie Wonder, bass) and Gabriel Katona (keyboards).

The new lineup recorded &quot;Back to Earth&quot; in 1975 and went back on the road. However, both Paul Warren and Frosty left during this tour and new drummer Chet McCracken (who would go on to join the Doobie Brothers) was hired to finish out their 1975 tour. The band then recorded &quot;Midnight Lady&quot; (minus Katona and McCracken), which was released in 1976. Frank Westbrook replaced Katona on keyboards, whilst McCracken was not replaced, instead session musician Ollie Brown handled percussion duties for &quot;Midnight Lady&quot;. But neither of these releases sold as well as the band had been used to and they soon found themselves bogged down and unable to tour when they brought a lawsuit against former member Hoorelbeke, claiming that he tried to make off with the group&#x27;s name and retirement monies. The lawsuit was eventually settled in Bridges favor and he was given the rights to the name &quot;Rare Earth&quot; under Gilbert Bridges Enterprises and the band continued on.

In late 1976, a former Motown vice president, Barney Ales, an earlier champion of Rare Earth, returned to facebook.com/r.phpcompany to head up one of their new offshoot labels, Prodigal Records. He made an offer to reunite the 1972–74 members of the band; Bridges, Guzman, Hoorelbeke, Urso, Olson and Monette to record a new album on Prodigal. Monette and Olson did not agree to the terms and abstained. The rest of the band agreed to record the album, but not to tour together. Session players Dan Ferguson (guitar) and Ron Fransen (keyboards) were brought in instead to play on &quot;Rarearth&quot;, which was produced by both James Anthony Carmichael and Cal Harris (both of which later had success with the Commodores and Lionel Richie). It was released in 1977 but failed to reach expectations. 

Later in 1977, the group reassembled with Chicago-based producer John Ryan (who worked with Styx and others) to begin work on two new albums. This time, Monette and Olson agreed to join in and the results were &quot;Band Together&quot; and &quot;Grand Slam&quot;, both released in 1978 and featuring more of a late 1970s disco sound, with the former providing the Bee Gees-penned hit &quot;Warm Ride&quot;, which peaked at number 39. Other than the one solitary hit, neither album was a big seller. Gap Band bassist Robert Wilson contributed to some of the tracks on &quot;Band Together&quot;.

In June 1979 Urso left the band again. On his recommendation, and after hearing several bass players, the group recruited bassist Ken Johnston, who joined the group&#x27;s road tours for two years until June 1981. Johnston had just completed a stint with jazz singer Maxine Weldon and had rejoined Las Vegas comedian/songster Kenny Laursen. He interrupted his tour with Laursen to join Rare Earth in Florida.

===1980s and 1990s===

Former Motown writer Dino Fekaris, who had penned the band&#x27;s hits &quot;I Just Want to Celebrate&quot; and &quot;Hey Big Brother&quot;, was next to step back into the group&#x27;s life in 1980. He had just come off back to back successes with Gloria Gaynor and Peaches &amp; Herb and had won a Grammy Award for Gaynor&#x27;s hit &quot;I Will Survive&quot;. RCA expressed interest in the band&#x27;s new project and gave them an advance to go ahead and start recording. The project was originally to be titled &quot;King of the Mountain&quot;, with the title track slated to be the theme of a 1981 movie of the same name that starred Harry Hamlin. But the movie people passed on the song, and when the record was done, RCA was not happy with Fekaris&#x27; production, so they passed as well. This album, retitled &quot;Tight &amp; Hot&quot;, saw a very limited release in 1982 in Canada only.

By the summer of 1981, Mike Urso had returned to Rare Earth after a two-year absence, but he left again in mid-1983, and has not returned to the band since then. Tim Ellsworth was then brought in as new bassist/vocalist in September 1983. By the tail end of that year, Peter Hoorelbeke was let go from the band again after disagreements with Gil Bridges. (Hoorelbeke went on to form the Classic Rock All-Stars in 1992.) Drummer Tony Thomas replaced Hoorelbeke on drums. After Hoorelbeke&#x27;s departure, Ellsworth and Olson took over lead vocals. By that time most of the members of the band had moved back to Detroit, and the group continued to tour.

Personnel shuffles abounded in the mid-1980s. In September 1984, Bob Weaver took over the drum throne and played with the group into 1985. He was temporarily succeeded by Bob Brock, whose professional name was Bobby Rock (not Bob Rock, the famous Hard rock/Heavy metal producer from Canada), but returned only to be replaced by Jerry LeBloch in mid-1985. Also in September of &#x27;84, Andy Merrild replaced Tim Ellsworth as bassist until the end of June 1985. Ellsworth then returned and toured with the group until the end of August of &#x27;85. The group&#x27;s road manager, Randy &quot;Bird&quot; Burghdoff, took over as Rare Earth&#x27;s bassist in September 1985 and has remained in that position ever since. Mark Olson was let go in 1986 after increasing personal and substance abuse troubles. (Olson died on April 14, 1991, at the age of 41, from liver disease.) Rick Warner was then brought in as the band&#x27;s new keyboardist and Wayne Baraks, who was recruited in 1987 on rhythm guitar, took over much of the lead vocals as well.

In the late 1980s and early 1990s the personnel changes slowed down somewhat as things stabilized and the band found itself in demand to play on &quot;oldies&quot; bills with other acts of the 1960s and 1970s.

Drummer Dean Boucher replaced LeBloch on drums in 1989 and RE signed with the small foreign label Koch International and began work on a new album. The result was &quot;Different World&quot; (released in February 1993) which was a collection containing a few covers of older songs and new material. It was mostly overlooked by the public and not even issued in the U.S.

On July 29, 1993, the band suffered the loss of another member when long time percussionist Eddie Guzman (age 49) died at his home in Howell, Michigan.

The group kept going, though, and brought in new drummer Floyd Stokes Jr., who also took over for the departing Boucher, and took on lead vocal duties too after guitarist Baraks pulled out of the group in 1994.

The band was doing well, touring, with Mike Bruner succeeding Rick Warner in January 1998 and Ivan Greilich&#x27;s filling in for Ray Monette until Monette&#x27;s final departure in 2017.

Rare Earth continued to perform at corporate events on the oldies circuit. Bits from their recordings have been used as samples on recordings as diverse as Beck&#x27;s &quot;Derelict&quot;, UNKLE, and DJ Shadow&#x27;s &quot;GDMFSOB (feat. Roots Manuva - U.N.K.L.E. uncensored version)&quot;, Black Sheep&#x27;s &quot;Try Counting Sheep&quot;, Peanut Butter Wolf&#x27;s &quot;Tale of Five Cities&quot;, Scarface&#x27;s &quot;Faith&quot;, NWA&#x27;s &quot;Real Niggaz Don&#x27;t Die&quot; and Eric B. and Rakim&#x27;s &quot;What&#x27;s Going On&quot;.

===2000 and beyond===
Their hit &quot;I Just Want to Celebrate&quot; has been used in US-wide advertising campaigns by Ford Motor Company, AT&amp;T Corporation, and Nicoderm.

In 2005 Rare Earth was voted into the Michigan Rock and Roll Legends Hall of Fame.

The album &quot;A Brand New World&quot; was released on CD in 2008 on Rare Earth Music.

In March 2017 long time guitarist Ray Monette announced his retirement from the band due to recurring back troubles. His replacement was Jerry &quot;Lew&quot; Patterson.

Rare Earth continued playing events such as Disneys Anniversary- Hippie Fest, The Moody Blues Cruises and Classic Rock Festivals.

Gil Bridges, the last original member appearing in the current Rare Earth lineup, died from complications arising from COVID-19 on December 8, 2021, aged 80. Bridges was the only member that recorded on every single track from beginning to end.

In 2022, Metallica released a live recording from the MusiCares MAP Fund Benefit Concert at Club Nokia in Los Angeles on May 12, 2014. The performance includes a cover of &quot;I Just Want to Celebrate&quot; by Rare Earth.

In 2023, several artists performed Rare Earth&#x27;s &quot;I Just Want to Celebrate&quot; to kick off the 2023 Grammy Awards.

<text>A saucer is a type of small dishware. While in the Middle Ages a saucer was used for serving condiments and sauces, currently the term is used to denote a small plate or shallow bowl that supports a cup – usually one used to serve coffee or tea.

==Overview==
The center of the saucer often contains a depression or raised ring sized to fit a matching cup; this was only introduced in the mid 18th century. The saucer is useful for protecting surfaces from possible damage due to the heat of a cup, and to catch overflow, splashes, and drips from the cup, thus protecting both table linen and the user sitting in a free-standing chair who holds both cup and saucer. The saucer also provides a convenient place for a wet spoon, as might be used to stir the drink in the cup in order to mix sweeteners or creamers into tea or coffee.

Some people pour the hot tea or coffee from the cup into the saucer; the increased surface area of the liquid exposed to the air increases the rate at which it cools, allowing the drinker to consume the beverage quickly after preparation. This was very common in the 18th century.

Although often part of a place setting in a tea or dinner set, teacups with unique styling are often sold with matching saucers, sometimes alone, or as part of a tea set, including a teapot and small dessert plates.

==Thermal transport==
When placed beneath a cup, saucers have very little direct influence on beverage cooling rate. For hot, water based beverages (e.g. tea or coffee), cooling rate in a cup is typically dominated by evaporation, which occurs across the free surface in contact with the air. Heat transfer through the bottom of the cup is small relative to heat lost through the top of the cup. Further reducing the heat lost through the bottom of the cup has little effect on the cooling rate of the beverage.

Placing a saucer on top of a cup, however, inhibits evaporative cooling and is thus an effective way of reducing the cooling rate so that the drink remains warmer for longer. The reduction in heat loss due to evaporation is typically much greater than the increase in heat loss associated with conduction through the saucer (and subsequent radiation or convective transfer to the surrounding air).

<doc id="922083" wikidata="Q58162" url="?curid=922083" title="Flannel">
<text>Flannel is a soft woven fabric, of varying fineness. Flannel was originally made from carded wool or worsted yarn, but is now often made from either wool, cotton, or synthetic fiber. Flannel is commonly used to make tartan clothing, blankets, bed sheets, sleepwear, and several other uses.

Flannel may be brushed to create extra softness or remain unbrushed. Brushing is a mechanical process wherein a fine metal brush rubs the fabric to raise fine fibres from the loosely spun yarns to form a nap on one or both sides. If the flannel is not napped, it gains its softness through the loosely spun yarn in its woven form.

The term &quot;flannel shirt&quot; is often mistakenly used to refer to any shirt with a plaid or tartan pattern. However, &#x27;flannel&#x27; refers simply to the fabric; not all flannel shirts are plaid and not all plaid shirts are flannel.

==History==
The word&#x27;s origin is uncertain, but a Welsh origin has been suggested as fabric similar to flannel can be traced back to Wales, where it was well known as early as the 16th century. The fabric was called &quot;Welsh cotton&quot;, and despite its name, it was a coarse woolen material with a fluffed surface similar to flannel.

The French term &quot;flanelle&quot; was used in the late 17th century, and the German &quot;Flanell&quot; was used in the early 18th century.

Flannel has been made since the 17th century, gradually replacing the older Welsh plains, some of which were finished as &quot;cottons&quot; or friezes, coarse woolen cloth that was the local textile product. In the 19th century, flannel was made particularly in towns such as Newtown, Montgomeryshire, Hay on Wye, and Llanidloes. The expansion of its production is closely associated with the spread of carding mills, which prepared the wool for spinning, this being the first aspect of the production of woollen cloth to be mechanised (apart from fulling). The marketing of these Welsh woollen clothes was largely controlled by the Drapers Company of Shrewsbury.

Flannel became popular in the United States during the Civil War, when it was imported as an inexpensive, sturdy material for soldiers’ basic coats and undershirts. American entrepreneur Hamilton Carhartt is most credited with popularizing flannel garments in the USA. He opened a flannel-focused textile plant, the first of its kind, in Detroit in 1889. It was during the years following this introduction that the American middle class adopted the flannel shirt as a workwear staple.

At one time, Welsh, Yorkshire, Lancashire, and Irish flannels differed slightly in character due largely to the grade of raw wool used in the several localities, some being softer and finer than others. Dyes determine the flannel&#x27;s color; this was achieved by mixing white, blue, brown, and black wools in varying proportions. Lighter shades were achieved by bleaching with sulphur dioxide.

During the 1950s, Irish designer Sybil Connolly, inspired by Aran Island and traditional Irish peasant skirts, designed a &#x27;Red Flannel&#x27; skirt using red flannel wool.

Originally, flannel was made of fine, short staple wool, but by the 20th century, mixtures of silk and cotton had become common. At this time, flannel trousers became popular in sports, especially cricket, and it was used extensively until the late 1970s.

Flannel plaid shirts became popular teen wear in the early 1990s, being part of the grunge style of bands like Nirvana and Pearl Jam.

==Types==
Flannelette typically refers to a napped cotton fabric imitating the texture of flannel. The weft is generally coarser than the warp. The flannel-like appearance is created by creating a nap from the weft; scratching it and raising it up. Flannelette can either have long or short nap, and can be napped on one or two sides. It comes in many colours, both solid and patterned.

Baby flannel is a lightweight fabric used for childrenswear.

Cotton flannel or Canton flannel is a cotton fabric napped on one or two sides.

Ceylon&#x27;s flannel was a name for a wool and cotton mixture.

Diaper flannel is a stout cotton fabric napped on both sides, and used for making cloth diapers.

Vegetable flannel, invented by Léopold Lairitz in Germany in the 1800s, uses fibres from the Scots pine rather than wool.

==Weave==
Flannel, flannelette, and cotton flannel can be woven in either a twill weave or plain weave. The weave is often hidden by napping on one or both sides. After weaving, it is napped once, then bleached, dyed, or otherwise treated, and then napped a second time.

<text>Legend is a 1985 American epic dark fantasy adventure film directed by Ridley Scott, written by William Hjortsberg, and starring Tom Cruise, Mia Sara, Tim Curry, David Bennent, Alice Playten, Billy Barty, Cork Hubbert and Annabelle Lanyon. The film revolves around Jack, a pure being who must stop the Lord of Darkness who plots to cover the world with eternal night.

Despite its lack of commercial success and poor reception from critics, the film won the British Society of Cinematographers Award for Best Cinematography in 1985 for cinematographer Alex Thomson and was nominated for multiple awards: The Oscar for Best Makeup; the Academy of Science Fiction, Fantasy and Horror Films Saturn Award for Best Makeup; BAFTA Awards for Best Costume Design, Best Makeup Artist, and Best Special Visual Effects; DVD Exclusive Awards; and Youth in Film Awards (since renamed Young Artist Awards). Since its premiere, reinforced by the 2002 release of the unrated Director&#x27;s Cut, the film has been called a cult classic.

==Plot==

In order to cast the world into eternal night, the Lord of Darkness sends the goblin Blix to kill the unicorns in the forest near his castle and bring him their horns. Told by Darkness that the best bait is Innocence, Blix and her colleagues Pox and Blunder follow Princess Lili as she visits her forest-dwelling paramour, Jack in the Green. Jack teaches Lili to speak to animals, then takes her blindfolded to a forest stream where the unicorns frolic. When Lili holds out her hand to touch the stallion, Blix shoots him with a poison dart from her blowpipe and the unicorns flee. Jack is angry, but Lili laughs off his concern and issues a challenge by throwing her ring into a pond, declaring she will marry whoever finds it. While Jack dives in after the ring, the goblins track down the poisoned stallion and sever his horn, causing winter to descend. Lili runs off in terror, and Jack is barely able to break through the surface of the now-frozen pond.

Lili takes refuge in a peasant cottage. While there, she sees the goblins test the horn&#x27;s magic powers and overhears how she was the bait in their slaying of the stallion. She follows the goblins to a rendezvous with Darkness, who tells them the world cannot be cast into eternal night as long as the surviving mare still lives. Blunder unsuccessfully tries using the horn to overthrow Darkness and is sent into the castle&#x27;s dungeon. Meanwhile Jack, accompanied by forest elf Honeythorn Gump, will-o&#x27;-the-wisp Oona, and dwarves Brown Tom and Screwball, finds the mare mourning the lifeless stallion. Jack begs forgiveness from the mare, who communicates to him that the horn must be recovered and returned to the stallion by a great hero. Deciding Jack is that hero, the group leaves Brown Tom to guard the unicorns while they retrieve a hidden cache of ancient weapons and armor. In their absence, Lili warns Brown Tom of the goblins coming back to kill the mare. He is then incapacitated by the goblins, who capture both Lili and the mare.

Upon returning, Jack and his group make their way to Darkness&#x27; castle. On the way, they are attacked by a swamp hag named Meg Mucklebones, but Jack defeats her by flattering her appearance and then decapitating her. At the castle, Jack&#x27;s group falls into an underground prison cell, where they encounter Blunder, who is revealed to be a dwarf gone astray, before he is dragged off by an ogre to be baked into a pie. Oona, who is secretly a fairy, retrieves the keys to free the others.

Darkness realizes that even he is touched by Lili&#x27;s innocence and releases her to wander the castle. He leaves lavish gifts for her, including an enchanted, dancing dress that hypnotizes her. Revealing himself, he asks her to marry him. She resists, but then agrees on the condition that she will be the one to kill the mare in the upcoming ritual. Overhearing their conversation, Jack and Gump learn Darkness can be destroyed by daylight. After saving Blunder, the group takes the ogres&#x27; giant metal platters as makeshift mirrors to reflect sunlight into the sacrificial chamber.

As the ritual begins, Lili frees the mare and Darkness strikes her unconscious. Jack fights Darkness, wounding him with the stallion&#x27;s horn right before the redirected sunlight shines into the room, blasting Darkness to the edge of the void. Darkness warns them that because evil lurks in all beings, he will never truly be vanquished. Wavering in doubt, Jack finally severs the hands of Darkness, expelling him into the void. Gump then returns the stallion to life by magically reattaching its horn. With the stallion and mare reunited, winter immediately ends. Jack retrieves Lili&#x27;s ring from the pond and places it on her finger, wakening her from Darkness&#x27;s spell.

===Alternate endings===
There are three different versions of the film&#x27;s conclusion:
* In the American theatrical version, Jack and Lili assure each other of their love and watch the unicorns reunite, and they run off into the sunset together, hailed by the forest fairies and the unicorns. Darkness watches them from the void, laughing.
* The European theatrical version also ends with both Jack and Lili running off into the sunset, but without Darkness&#x27;s final appearance.
* In the Director&#x27;s Cut, Lili wakes with Jack trying to convince her she was merely dreaming, but she is ultimately unconvinced. They confess their true love for each other, but Lili realizes they live in two different worlds. She puts the ring on his finger and tells him to treasure it, then asks if she can come back tomorrow. Jack says he will always be there for her and Lili returns to her home to her responsibilities. Jack happily runs off into the sunset, hailed by the forest fairies and the revived unicorns.

==Cast==

Playten, in an additional uncredited contribution, provides the voice of Gump, because an executive thought that Bennent&#x27;s voice sounded too German.

==Production==
===Development===
While filming &quot;The Duellists&quot; in France, Ridley Scott conceived &quot;Legend&quot; after another planned project, &quot;Tristan and Isolde&quot;, fell through temporarily. However, he believed that it would be an art film with limited audience appeal and went on to make &quot;Alien&quot; and did pre-production work on &quot;Dune&quot;, another halted project, which was eventually finished by director David Lynch. Frustrated, he came back to the idea of filming a fairy tale or mythological story.

For inspiration, Scott read classic fairy tales, including ones by the Brothers Grimm. From that, he conceived a story about a young hermit who is transformed into a hero when he battles the Darkness in order to rescue a beautiful princess and release the world from a wintery curse.

===Screenplay===
Scott wanted &quot;Legend&quot; to have an original screenplay because he believed that &quot;it was far easier to design a story to fit the medium of cinema than bend the medium for an established story&quot;. By chance, he discovered several books written by American novelist William Hjortsberg and found that the writer had already written several scripts for some unmade lower-budgeted films. Scott asked him if he was interested in writing a fairy tale. He was already writing some and agreed. Scott remembers, &quot;The first notion was to actually make a classical fairy story, but if you actually analyze a classical fairy story, most are either very short, or very complex&quot;. The two men bonded over Jean Cocteau&#x27;s 1946 film of &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot;. In January 1981, just before beginning principal photography on &quot;Blade Runner&quot;, Scott spent five weeks with Hjortsberg working out a rough storyline for what was then called &quot;Legend of Darkness&quot;.

Originally, Scott &quot;only had the vague notion of something in pursuit of the swiftest steed alive which, of course, was the unicorn&quot;. Scott felt that they should have a quest and wanted unicorns as well as magic armor and a sword. Hjortsberg suggested plunging the world into wintery darkness. Hjortsberg&#x27;s first draft of &quot;Legend of Darkness&quot; also had Princess Lili slowly transform into a clawed and fur-covered beast who is whipped and sexually seduced by the antagonist (called Baron Couer De Noir in this draft). 

Initially, the quest was longer, but it was eventually substantially reduced. Scott wanted to avoid too many subplots that departed from the main story and go for a &quot;more contemporary movement rather than get bogged down in too classical a format&quot;. By the time Scott had finished &quot;Blade Runner&quot;, he and Hjortsberg had a script that was &quot;lengthy, hugely expensive, and impractical in its size and scope&quot;. They went through it and took out large sections that were secondary to the story. The two men went through 15 script revisions.

===Pre-production===
The look Scott envisioned for &quot;Legend&quot; was influenced by the style of Disney animation. He had even offered the project to Disney, but they were intimidated by the film&#x27;s dark tone at a time when Disney still focused on family-friendly material. Visually, Scott referenced films like &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot;, &quot;Fantasia&quot; and &quot;Pinocchio&quot;. The look of &quot;Legend&quot; was also influenced by the art of Arthur Rackham and Heath Robinson. Scott had initially sought the services of conceptual designer Brian Froud, but was turned down. He then hired Alan Lee as a visual consultant, who drew some characters and sketched environments. However, Scott eventually replaced Lee with Assheton Gorton, a production designer whom he had wanted for both &quot;Alien&quot; and &quot;Blade Runner&quot;. Scott hired Gorton because he knew &quot;all the pitfalls of shooting exteriors on a soundstage. We both knew that whatever we did would never look absolutely real, but would very quickly gain its own reality and dispense with any feeling of theatricality&quot;.

Scott also consulted with effects expert Richard Edlund because the director did not want to limit major character roles to the number of smaller people who could act. At one point, the director considered Mickey Rooney to play one of the major characters but he did not look small enough next to Tom Cruise. Edlund considered shooting on 70 mm film stock, taking the negative, and reducing the actors to any size they wanted—but this was deemed too expensive. Thus, Scott was tasked with finding an ensemble of small actors. &quot;Legend&quot; would be financed with a budget of $24.5 million, and would be distributed by Universal Pictures in North America and by 20th Century Fox in all other territories.

In order to achieve the look of &quot;Legend&quot; that he wanted, Scott scouted locations in the Sequoias of Yosemite National Park to see the grand scale of trees there. &quot;The whole environment is so stunning ... It was so impressive, but I didn&#x27;t know how you would control it&quot;. However, it would cost too much to shoot on location and he decided to build a forest set on the 007 Stage, named after and used for many James Bond films, at Pinewood Studios. The crew spent 14 weeks constructing the forest set, and Scott was worried that it would not look real enough. It was only days before the start of principal photography that it looked good enough to film. The trees were 60 feet high with trunks 30 feet in diameter and were sculpted out of polystyrene built onto tubular scaffolding frames. In addition, other sets were constructed on five huge soundstages.

===Casting===
Johnny Depp, Jim Carrey and Robert Downey Jr. were considered for the role of Jack. Scott was considering Richard O&#x27;Brien to play Meg Mucklebones, and re-watched his appearance in &quot;The Rocky Horror Picture Show&quot;; he saw Tim Curry in that film, and thought he would be ideal to play Darkness because he had both film and theatrical experience. Scott discovered Mia Sara in a casting session and was impressed by her &quot;good theatrical instincts&quot;.

===Makeup effects===
Scott contacted Rob Bottin, who designed the special makeup effects for &quot;The Howling&quot;, about working on &quot;Blade Runner&quot;, but Bottin was already committed to John Carpenter&#x27;s &quot;The Thing&quot;. Scott told him about &quot;Legend&quot;, and toward the end of production on &quot;The Thing&quot;, Bottin read a script for the film and saw an excellent opportunity to create characters in starring roles.

After wrapping his work with Carpenter, Bottin met with Scott to reduce the thousands of creatures suggested by the script to a manageable quantity. The process would involve complicated prosthetic makeup that would be worn for up to 60 days with some full body prosthetics. According to Bottin, at the time, &quot;Legend&quot; had the largest makeup crew ever dedicated to one project. Bottin divided his facility into different shops in order to cover the immense workload. As actors were cast, Bottin and his crew began making life casts and designed characters on drafting paper laid over sketches of the actors&#x27; faces. He designed the prosthetics in his Los Angeles studio and spent some time in England occasionally helping with the application of makeup.

With the exception of Cruise and Sara, all the principal actors spent hours every morning having extensive makeup applied. Between 8 and 12 prosthetic pieces were applied individually to each face, then made up, molded and grafted into the actor&#x27;s face so that the prosthetics moved with their muscles. Each person needed three makeup artists working on them for an average time of three and a half hours spent applying prosthetics. Actor Tim Curry took five and a half hours because his entire body was encased in makeup, the film&#x27;s most challenging character design. His makeup as Darkness is considered to be one of the most iconic images in all of fantasy cinema.

Curry had to wear a large, bull-like structure atop his head with three-foot fiberglass horns supported by a harness underneath the makeup. The initial design of the horns placed a strain on the back of the actor&#x27;s neck because they extended forward and not straight up but Bottin and his crew eventually reduced the weight of the horns. At the end of the day, he spent an hour in a bath in order to liquefy the soluble spirit gum. At one point, Curry became claustrophobic, got too impatient, and pulled the makeup off too quickly, tearing off his own skin in the process. Scott had to shoot around the actor for a week as a result.

===Principal photography===
Principal photography began on March 26, 1984 on the 007 Stage at Pinewood Studios. On June 27, 1984, with ten days filming left on this stage, the entire set burned down during a lunch break. Reportedly, flames from the set fire leapt more than 100 feet into the air and the clouds of smoke could be seen five miles away. It occurred during lunchtime, and no one was hurt. Scott quickly made changes to the shooting schedule and only lost three days moving to another soundstage. Meanwhile, the art department rebuilt the section of the forest set that was needed to complete filming. Due to the fire, the scenes of Lili meeting the unicorns for the first time and finding the cottages in the snow were filmed in the garden of the main house behind Shepperton Studios. The underwater scenes were filmed in Silver Springs, Florida for the &quot;purity&quot; of the water. Cruise did all his own diving and swimming in waters that, according to Scott, had real alligators 25 feet from where they were filming.

===Post-production===
Scott&#x27;s first cut of &quot;Legend&quot; ran 125 minutes long. He then believed there were minor plot points that could be trimmed and cut the film down to 113 minutes, so he tested this version for an audience in Orange County. However, it was decided that the audience had to work too much to be entertained, and another 20 minutes was cut. The 95-minute version was shown in Great Britain and then the film was cut down even further to 89 minutes for North America.

At the time, Scott said, &quot;European audiences are more sophisticated. They accepted preambles and subtleties whereas the U.S. goes for a much broader stroke.&quot; He and Universal delayed the North American theatrical release until 1986 so that they could replace Jerry Goldsmith&#x27;s score with music by Tangerine Dream, Yes lead singer Jon Anderson, and Bryan Ferry.

Scott allowed Goldsmith&#x27;s score to remain on European prints and the composer said, &quot;that this dreamy, bucolic setting is suddenly to be scored by a techno-pop group seems sort of strange to me&quot;. Normally, Goldsmith would spend 6–10 weeks on a film score, but for &quot;Legend&quot;, he spent six months writing songs and dance sequences ahead of time.

In 2000, Universal unearthed an answer print of the 113-minute preview cut with Jerry Goldsmith&#x27;s score. This print had minor visual anomalies that were eventually digitally replaced, occasionally with finished shots from the 89-minute U.S. version. This edition is Scott&#x27;s preferred 2002 &quot;Director&#x27;s Cut&quot;, with the restored Jerry Goldsmith soundtrack. The Director&#x27;s Cut&#x27;s source is one of only two prints of this extended version known to exist, used for Universal&#x27;s 2002 DVD (and eventual Blu-ray) &quot;Ultimate Edition&quot;.

==Reception==
===Critical response===

Positive reviews included Steve Biodrowski of &quot;Cinefantastique&quot;, who highlighted the makeup design by Rob Bottin and Tim Curry&#x27;s performance as Darkness, saying that &quot;[b]ecause of the visuals (and Curry&#x27;s performance, which is mostly limited to the last 20 minutes), the film is worth seeing&quot;. Widgett Walls of needcoffee.com also praised the film, once again highlighting Bottin&#x27;s makeup, focusing on the character of Darkness, saying simply that &quot;Tim Curry&#x27;s Darkness is absolutely incredible.&quot;

Less favorable reviews included Neil Gaiman&#x27;s in &quot;Imagine&quot; magazine, stating that &quot;Glimmers of intelligence show here and there in the script, suggesting that William Hjortsberg... [understood] that fairies are wilful, capricious creatures... but if you go and see the film don&#x27;t say I didn&#x27;t warn you.&quot; Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot; felt it was &quot;a slap-dash amalgam of Old Testament, King Arthur, &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; and any number of comic books&quot;, and that the real star was actually production designer Assheton Gorton, who compensated by creating sets &quot;that keep the eye busier than the mind or the heart.&quot;

Negative reviews include Gene Siskel of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, who gave the film half of one star out of four and stated that writing the review was &quot;akin to recalling a bad dream&quot;, concluding that &quot;I don&#x27;t want to remember any more about &quot;Legend&quot; than to make sure I include it in my &#x27;worst films of 1986&#x27; list and never rent it when it comes out as a video cassette.&quot; In 2015, the film was described in &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; as the &quot;extinction event&quot; that discouraged Hollywood from making fantasy films.

In his original review, Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; said that the movie was composed of all of the right ingredients to be successful, but that the film simply &quot;doesn&#x27;t work&quot;. He went on to say that &quot;[a]ll of the special effects in the world, and all of the great makeup, and all of the great Muppet creatures can&#x27;t save a movie that has no clear idea of its own mission and no joy in its own accomplishment&quot;. However, with the release of the 2002 Director&#x27;s Cut, he agreed with many fans on how it was intended to question the balance between good and evil, and gives the main characters moral flaws to display the imperfections of humans.

===Box office===
&quot;Legend&quot; grossed $15.5million in the United States and Canada, and $8.0million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $23.5million, against a budget of $25million. In the United States and Canada, it spent its first two weeks at No. 1, of three weeks overall in the Top 10 at the box office.

==Soundtrack==

Because of the changes in the film from its European and American releases, &quot;Legend&quot; has two different soundtracks. The first, composed, conducted and produced by Jerry Goldsmith, was used for its initial European release and restored in the director&#x27;s cut edition of the Region 1 DVD release. The second soundtrack features music by German electronic artists Tangerine Dream and was used for the initial theatrical and home video releases in the United States. This soundtrack also includes songs by Jon Anderson of Yes and Bryan Ferry of Roxy Music.

The following songs are featured in the European and director&#x27;s cuts, with lyrics composed by John Bettis (composer of many Carpenters songs) and music by Jerry Goldsmith:
* &quot;My True Love&#x27;s Eyes&quot; (the main theme, sung mostly by Lili. Mia Sara provided some of the singing, while session singers provided vocals wherever Sara was unable to perform).
* &quot;Living River&quot; (the first reprise of &quot;My True Love&#x27;s Eyes&quot;, sung as Lili calls to the unicorn).
* &quot;Bumps and Hollows&quot; (sung by Lili after her forbidden act of touching a unicorn).
* &quot;Sing the Wee&quot; (the theme for the fairies. The first sung version was cut from all editions of the film as it accompanied a scene with Jack and the fairies that was itself cut; the final sung version by the National Philharmonic Chorus is heard over the end credits).
* &quot;Reunited&quot; (the final reprise of &quot;My True Love&#x27;s Eyes&quot;, sung by Lili as she says goodbye to Jack).

The following songs appeared in the 89-minute U.S. re-cut when it was re-scored by Tangerine Dream:
* &quot;Loved by the Sun&quot; (music by Tangerine Dream, lyrics written and sung by Jon Anderson).
* &quot;Is Your Love Strong Enough&quot; (written and performed by Bryan Ferry over the U.S. print&#x27;s end credits).

A promotional music video (presumably for the U.S. market, where the Tangerine Dream soundtrack was used) was created for the Bryan Ferry song &quot;Is Your Love Strong Enough&quot;. The video, which incorporates Ferry and guitarist David Gilmour into footage from the film, is included as a bonus on disc 2 of the 2002 &quot;Ultimate Edition&quot; DVD release.

In 2002, Universal released the 113-minute Director&#x27;s Cut on Region 1 DVD, restoring previously cut scenes and the original Goldsmith score.

Universal released a Blu-ray version of the &quot;Ultimate Edition&quot; on May 31, 2011. With the exception of the 2002 DVD-ROM features, this disc carries over all the content from the DVD, including the Jerry Goldsmith-scored &quot;Director&#x27;s Cut&quot; and the Tangerine Dream-scored theatrical version.

In the 1980s, Warner Home Video released &quot;Legend&quot; on VHS in the United Kingdom.

20th Century Studios—the international rights holder via Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures—has released a Blu-ray issue for Region 2 of both the 94-minute European version and the 113-minute Director&#x27;s Cut, both with Jerry Goldsmith&#x27;s music.

In September 2021, the film was reissued yet again by Arrow Films (under license from Universal) as a 2-disc &quot;Limited Edition&quot; including the two major cuts of the movie (theatrical and Director&#x27;s Cuts with their respective corresponding scores), with nearly all the bonus content from the previous Universal releases, plus new documentaries on the film. The International Version was not included on this new set as the rights to that edition are held by The Walt Disney Company (via the library of 20th Century Studios).

<doc id="922085" wikidata="Q35011" url="?curid=922085" title="Frances Fisher">
<text>Frances Louise Fisher (born May 11, 1952) is an American actress. She began her career in theater and later starred as Detective Deborah Saxon in the CBS daytime soap opera &quot;The Edge of Night&quot; (1976–1981). In film, she is known for her roles in &quot;Unforgiven&quot; (1992), &quot;Titanic&quot; (1997), &quot;True Crime&quot; (1999), &quot;House of Sand and Fog&quot; (2003), &quot;Laws of Attraction&quot; (2004), &quot;The Kingdom&quot; (2007), &quot;In the Valley of Elah&quot; (2007), &quot;Jolene&quot; (2008), &quot;The Lincoln Lawyer&quot; (2011), and &quot;The Host&quot; (2013). From 2014 to 2015, Fisher starred in the ABC drama series &quot;Resurrection&quot;. In 2019, she starred in the HBO television series &quot;Watchmen&quot;, a sequel to the graphic novel of the same name.

== Early life and education ==
Fisher was born on May 11, 1952, in Milford on Sea, the daughter of American parents Olga Rosine (née Moen), a housewife, and William Irving &quot;Bill&quot; Fisher, Sr, an oil refinery construction superintendent. Her father was of Russian-Jewish and Hungarian-Jewish descent, whereas her mother was of Norwegian ancestry. Before she reached the age of 15, she had moved nine times and travelled because of her father&#x27;s job, going to places including Italy, Turkey, Colombia, France, Canada, and Brazil. 

When she was 15, her mother died and she took on the responsibility of raising her younger brother. She completed her high school at Lutcher Stark High School in Orange, Texas, where she performed in theatre productions, and later worked as a secretary.

== Career ==

=== Theatre ===

Deciding to follow her interest in theatre, she moved to New York City, where she subsequently enjoyed a 14-year stage career in regional and off-Broadway productions. She became involved with the Actors Studio, where she studied with Lee Strasberg. Fisher moved to Abingdon, Virginia, where she began her acting career at the Barter Theatre, a year-round repertory theatre.

During the next 10 years, she concentrated on theatre in New York City and in regional theaters around the East Coast. She has also returned to theatre; she appeared in Arthur Miller&#x27;s last play, &quot;Finishing the Picture,&quot; produced at the Goodman Theatre in Chicago and in a 2006 production of &quot;The Cherry Orchard&quot; at the Mark Taper Forum in Los Angeles.

In 2015, she led the cast of &quot;My Child: Mothers of War in Los Angeles, and in 2019, she starred in the Laguna Playhouse production of &quot;The Lion in Winter&quot; with Gregory Harrison.

=== Television ===
Fisher gained recognition playing Detective Deborah Saxon on the ABC daytime soap opera &quot;The Edge of Night&quot; from 1976 to 1981. She later joined the cast of CBS&#x27;s &quot;Guiding Light&quot; as Suzette Saxon in 1985. After leaving daytime television, Fisher guest starred as a bartender, Savannah, at &quot;The Lobo&quot; in the first season of ABC comedy series &quot;Roseanne&quot;. She also appeared on &quot;Newhart&quot;, &quot;Matlock&quot; and &quot;In the Heat of the Night&quot;.

Fisher was originally cast to play Jill Taylor on the ABC sitcom &quot;Home Improvement&quot;, but was replaced after initial filming because producers felt that her pilot episode performance did not test well with the audience. She was cast in the unaired pilot to the short-lived 1992 ABC summer series &quot;Human Target&quot; (originally filmed in 1990, her role was recast by the time the series was picked up in October 1991, replaced by actress Signy Coleman).

In 1991, Fisher was cast as Lucille Ball in the television film &quot;Lucy &amp; Desi: Before the Laughter&quot;, which aired to strong ratings and good reviews. From 1994 to 1995 she starred in the Fox drama series &quot;Strange Luck&quot;. In 2000, Fisher portrayed Audrey Hepburn&#x27;s mother, Ella Hepburn, in the biographical film of the actress. In the same year she played the role of Janet Lee Bouvier in &quot;Jackie Bouvier Kennedy Onassis&quot;.

Fisher had recurring roles in the CBS sitcom &quot;Becker&quot; as Dr. Elizabeth &#x27;Liz&#x27; Carson from 1999 to 2000, and on Fox&#x27;s &quot;Titus&quot; as Juanita Titus (2000–2001). In 2002 she starred in the short-lived The WB series &quot;Glory Days&quot;, and in 2003 starred in another drama cancelled after a single season, &quot;The Lyon&#x27;s Den&quot; on NBC. In 2005, she appeared on the &quot;ER&quot; episode &quot;Just As I Am,&quot; as Helen Kingsley, the long-lost birth mother of Dr. Kerry Weaver, played by Laura Innes, even though Fisher is only five years older. She also starred in a pilot for NBC/USA entitled &quot;To Love and Die&quot;. In 2008, she appeared in a recurring role on the Sci-Fi Channel television series &quot;Eureka&quot;, portraying the character Eva Thorne. Fisher also guest-starred on &quot;Grey&#x27;s Anatomy&quot;, &quot;The Shield&quot;, &quot;Two and a Half Men&quot;, &quot;Private Practice&quot;, &quot;Sons of Anarchy&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Cold Case&quot;, and &quot;Castle&quot;.

In 2014, Fisher was starring in the ABC drama series &quot;Resurrection&quot; about the residents of Arcadia, Missouri, whose lives are upended when their loved ones return from the dead, unaged since their deaths. She played the role of Lucille Langston.

In 2017, she and her daughter Francesca Eastwood both starred in the acclaimed &quot;Fargo&quot; episode &quot;The Law of Non-Contradiction&quot; as the older and younger versions of the same character.

In 2019, she starred in the HBO television series &quot;Watchmen&quot;, a sequel to the graphic novel of the same name.

=== Film ===
Fisher made her film debut in &quot;Can She Bake a Cherry Pie?&quot; (1983) and later appeared in &quot;Patty Hearst&quot; directed by Paul Schrader. In 1989 she appeared in &quot;Pink Cadillac&quot; opposite Clint Eastwood, and the pair began an offscreen relationship. The following year she appeared in &quot;Welcome Home, Roxy Carmichael&quot;.

In 1992, Fisher had her break-out role in &quot;Unforgiven&quot;, an Academy Award-winning film directed by Clint Eastwood, who also starred. In later years she began acting regularly in major and independent films. Her most famous role in film was as the society matron Ruth DeWitt Bukater, the mother of the character played by Kate Winslet, in the 1997 blockbuster &quot;Titanic&quot;. She appeared in &quot;True Crime&quot; (1999) with Eastwood as D.A., and &quot;Gone in 60 Seconds&quot; (2000) as Junie, the wife of the character played by Robert Duvall.

Fisher had a role in &quot;House of Sand and Fog&quot; (2003), another Academy Award-nominated film. In 2004, she appeared in &quot;Laws of Attraction&quot; as Julianne Moore&#x27;s mother, even though she is only eight years older. Fisher worked on four films in 2006, including Peter Berg&#x27;s &quot;The Kingdom&quot;, and Paul Haggis&#x27; &quot;In the Valley of Elah&quot;. The same year, she appeared in the film &quot;Jolene&quot; with Jessica Chastain as her lover. She served as an official festival judge for the 2011 Noor Iranian Film Festival in Los Angeles. In 2011, she appeared in &quot;The Lincoln Lawyer&quot; and &quot;The Roommate&quot;.

Fisher appeared as Maggie Stryder in the 2013 film &quot;The Host&quot; with Saoirse Ronan and William Hurt. She also appeared in the films &quot;The Potters&quot; and &quot;You&#x27;re Not You&quot;, both released in 2014.

Fisher appeared in the film &quot;Woman in Gold&quot; (2015), playing the mother of Randol Schoenberg (Ryan Reynolds).

== Political activities ==
Fisher has been described as a progressive Democrat. She has served as SAG-AFTRA Los Angeles Chapter&#x27;s first vice-president, as well as a member of Screen Actors Guild National Board of Directors since 2004 (before its merger with AFTRA) and after the merger.

In the 2014 United States House of Representatives elections in California, Fisher endorsed and campaigned for Independent candidate for district 33, Marianne Williamson, an author and founder of Project Angel Food. Fisher later endorsed Williamson for her 2020 presidential campaign and again for her 2024 presidential campaign.

In the 2016 Democratic Party presidential primaries, Fisher endorsed and canvassed for U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders. Later that same year, on Jane Fonda&#x27;s 79th birthday, Fisher, Fonda, Lily Tomlin, and Catherine Keener marched alongside labor leader Dolores Huerta in support of the Standing Rock protest against the Dakota Access Pipeline. In 2022, she was cast in &quot;On Sacred Ground&quot;, a movie set during the protest.

In August 2019, Fisher jokingly called for U.S. President Donald Trump, who is a SAG-AFTRA member and whom she had previously called &quot;the biggest bully in the world&quot;, to vote for the union election&#x27;s opposition MembershipFirst slate, in a bid to mobilize all the union members, regardless of whether they are Democrat, Republican, or Independent, to cast their ballots to have their voices heard.

In 2021, after Ed Asner and nine other SAG-AFTRA members filed a lawsuit against SAG-AFTRA over alleged wage discrimination, Fisher and her co-plaintiffs filed a &quot;similar&quot; lawsuit alleging that the union had deceived members into agreeing to Collective Bargaining Agreements that reduced healthcare benefits for retirees and their families. The co-plaintiffs included fellow actors David Andrews, Belinda Balaski, Stephen R. Hart, and Anne Lockhart. In July 2022, after the lawsuit was previously dismissed without prejudice in July 2021 and amended, Judge Christina A. Snyder dismissed the lawsuit with prejudice.

== Personal life ==
In 1970, when Fisher was 18, she married her high school sweetheart Billy Mack Hamilton. They divorced two years later.

Fisher was in a relationship with &quot;Unforgiven&quot; co-star Clint Eastwood in the early-to-mid-1990s. During that time, the couple had a daughter, Francesca (b. 1993).

After her split from Eastwood, Fisher dated fellow actor George Clooney in 1995.

Fisher has explained that finding a boyfriend was difficult while raising a child on her own. She stated in 2010 that &quot;as a single mom, you know, it&#x27;s been a different thing. No gentleman callers.&quot;

In a 2011 interview, she proclaimed her celibacy.

<doc id="922087" wikidata="Q1077037" url="?curid=922087" title="Bolted joint">
<text>A bolted joint is one of the most common elements in construction and machine design. It consists of a male threaded fastener (e. g., a bolt) that captures and joins other parts, secured with a matching female screw thread. There are two main types of bolted joint designs: tension joints and shear joints.

The selection of the components in a threaded joint is a complex process. Careful consideration is given to many factors such as temperature, corrosion, vibration, fatigue, and initial preload.

==Joint types==

=== Tension joint ===
There are two types of tension joint: non-preloaded and preloaded.

==== Non-preloaded tension joint ====
These joints are not tightened to a precise preload, and the tension is mainly used to keep parts together without generating a high clamping force. An applied tensile load may cause separation of the joint. This type of joint should not be used where it is frequently subjected to variations of tensile loading.

==== Preloaded tension joint ====

In these joints, the bolt is tightened to apply a specific preload, generating a tensile force in the bolt and an equal compressive force in the clamped parts. This ensures that any applied tensile loads are distributed between the bolt and the clamped parts (see theory section), which has some advantages: 

* For cyclical tension loads, the bolt does not experience the full amplitude of the load, which increases its fatigue life. If the material has an endurance limit, the fastener&#x27;s life may extend indefinitely.
* The bolt remains secure without the relative movement that could cause loosening, potentially eliminating the need for additional locking mechanisms.

The joint should be designed so that the preload always exceeds the external tensile load to prevent separation. If the external tensile load exceeds the preload, the joint will separate, allowing relative motion between the components, potential bolt loosening, and increased load on it.

In both the preloaded tension and slip-resistant shear joints, some level of preload in the bolt and resulting compression in the clamped components is essential to the joint integrity. The preload target can be achieved by a variety of methods: applying a measured torque to the bolt, measuring bolt extension, heating to expand the bolt then turning the nut down, torquing the bolt to the yield point, testing ultrasonically, or by applying a certain number of degrees of relative rotation of the threaded components. Each method has a range of uncertainties associated with it, some of which are very substantial.

=== Shear joint ===
There are two types of shear joint: slip-resistant and the bearing type.

==== Slip-resistant shear joint ====
The bolt is tightened to a specified preload in these joints. This preload generates friction between the clamped parts, allowing shear loads to be transferred through the joint faces via friction, rather than being carried directly by the bolt. Relative motion between the clamped parts is prevented and thus any fretting wear that could result in the development of fatigue cracks. Any tensile loads applied to these joints, usually have a secondary effect, but they do reduce the effective preload. 

The relative stiffness of the bolt and the connected parts is less critical in calculating preload for a slip-critical joint compared to a preloaded tension joint (see theory section). Methods of applying preload are described in the preloaded tension joint section.

==== Bearing type shear joint ====
These joints are not tightened to a precise preload, and the tension is mainly used to keep parts together without generating a high clamping force. In this type of joint, the shear load is transmitted through bearing contact between the bolt and the walls of the bolt holes in the connected parts. When a shear load is applied, the connected parts move and the bolt shank makes contact with the hole walls, which transfers the load from the parts to the bolt. This causes a shear stress in the bolt at the junction of the connected parts, which it resists through its shear strength. As bearing type joints rely on this direct contact, they are more susceptible to wear and deformation of the bolt holes under high or repeated loads, which can lead to bolt fatigue or elongation of the holes over time. Any tensile loads applied to these joints, usually have a secondary effect, but they can reduce available shear strength of the bolt.

A clevis linkage, which relies on a locking mechanism (like lock washers, thread adhesives, and lock nuts), is a bearing type shear joint.

== Theory ==

=== Key concepts ===
Typically, a bolt is tensioned (preloaded) by the application of a torque to either the bolt head or the nut. The applied torque causes the bolt to &quot;climb&quot; the thread causing a tensioning of the bolt and an equivalent compression in the components being fastened by the bolt. The preload developed in a bolt is due to the applied torque and is a function of the bolt diameter, the geometry of the threads, and the coefficients of friction that exist in the threads and under the torqued bolt head or nut. The stiffness of the components clamped by the bolt has no relation to the preload that is developed by the torque. The relative stiffness of the bolt and the clamped joint components do, however, determine the fraction of the external tension load that the bolt will carry and that in turn determines preload needed to prevent joint separation and by that means to reduce the range of stress the bolt experiences as the tension load is repeatedly applied. This determines the durability of the bolt when subjected to repeated tension loads. Maintaining a sufficient joint preload also prevents relative slippage of the joint components that would produce fretting wear that could result in a fatigue failure of those parts.

The clamp load, also called preload of a fastener, is created when a torque is applied, and so develops a tensile preload that is generally a substantial percentage of the fastener&#x27;s proof strength. Fasteners are manufactured to various standards that define, among other things, their strength. &quot;Torque charts&quot; are available to specify the required torque for a given fastener based on its &quot;property class&quot; (fineness of manufacture and fit) and &quot;grade&quot; (tensile strength).

When a fastener is tightened, a tension preload is develops in the bolt, while an equal compressive preload forms in the clamped parts. This system can be modeled as a spring-like assembly, where the clamped parts experience compressive strain, and the bolt tensile strain. When an external tensile load is applied, it reduces the compressive strain in the clamped parts and increases the tensile strain in the bolt. The load carried by the bolt and the clamped parts is in proportion to their stiffness because they both experience the same induced strain. As a result, the external load is shared across the joint rather than being solely carried by the bolt. In a well-designed joint, about 10-20% of the applied tensile load is carried by the bolt with the greater part transferred through the clamped parts because they are much stiffer than it. This reduction in the proportion of load transferred to the bolt is important in applications with cyclic loading, as bolts have low fatigue strength due to the stress concentration in their threads.

In some applications, joints are designed so that the fastener eventually fails before more expensive components. In this case, replacing an existing fastener with a higher strength fastener can result in equipment damage. Thus, it is generally good practice to replace old fasteners with new fasteners of the same grade.

=== Formulas ===
The force in the bolt of a joint, which has not separated, isformula_1and in the clamped partsformula_2where

formula_3 is the external applied force, and

formula_4 is the bolt preload.

The portion of an external load carried by the bolt is the joint stiffness ratioformula_5where

formula_6 is the stiffness of the bolt, 

formula_7 is the stiffness of the clamped parts

Separation of the clamped parts occurs when the force at the clamped surfaces is zero (formula_8) thus the separation force isformula_9Separation under the bolt head occurs when the force in the bolt is zero formula_10 thus the separation force is,formula_11

The accompanying graph and table illustrate how the relative stiffness of the clamped parts and the bolt affects the portion of applied load carried by it. For example, when the stiffness of the clamped parts equals that of the bolt (the blue curve), an external load in the range from minus to plus twice the preload results in only 50% of the applied load being transferred to the bolt, as the total load in the bolt only varies by twice the preload. If the tensile applied load exceeds twice the preload, the clamped parts separate, and the bolt carries the entire load. Conversely, if the compressive load is lower than twice the preload, separation at the bolt head occurs, and the force in the bolt is zero. The curve representing a clamped parts-to-bolt stiffness ratio of 0.01 shows that when the relative stiffness of the clamped parts is very low, almost all of the load is transferred to the bolt, down to the point where a compressive load equals the preload, and separation at the bolt head occurs, reducing the force in the bolt to zero.

== Calculating the torque ==
Engineered joints require the torque to be chosen to provide the correct tension preload. Applying the torque to fasteners is commonly achieved using a torque wrench. The required torque value for a particular fastener application may be quoted in the published standard document, defined by the manufacturer or calculated. The side of the threaded fastening having the least friction should receive torque while the other side is counter-held or otherwise prevented from turning.

A common relationship used to calculate the torque for a desired preload takes into account the thread geometry and friction in the threads and under the bolt head or nut. The following assumes standard ISO or National Standard bolts and threads are used:
:formula_12

where 
:formula_13 is the required torque
:formula_14 is the nut factor
:formula_15 is the desired preload
:formula_16 is the bolt diameter

The nut factor K accounts for the thread geometry, friction, pitch. When ISO and Unified National Standard threads are used the nut factor is:
:formula_17

where
:formula_18 = the mean thread diameter, close to pitch diameter.
:formula_16 = nominal bolt diameter
:formula_20 = (thread pitch)/(pi * dm)
:Thread Pitch = 1/N where N is the number of threads per inch or mm
:formula_21 = friction coefficient in the threads
:formula_22 = half the thread angle (typically 60°) = 30° 
:formula_23 = friction coefficient under torqued head or nut

When formula_21 = formula_23 = 0.15, the dimensions used correspond to any size coarse or fine bolt, and the nut factor is K ≈ 0.20, the torque/preload relationship becomes:
:formula_26

A study of the effect of torquing two samples, one lubricated and the other unlubricated, 1/2 in.- 20 UNF bolts to 800 lb-in, produced the same mean preload of 7700 lbf. The preloads for the unlubricated bolt sample had a standard deviation from the mean value of 1100 lbf, whereas the lubricated sample had a standard deviation of 680 lbf. If the preload value and torques are used in the above relation to solve for the nut factor it is found to be K = 0.208, which is very close to the recommended value of 0.20


The preferred bolt preload for structural applications should be at least 75% of the fastener&#x27;s proof load for the higher strength fasteners and as high as 90% of the proof load for permanent fasteners. To achieve the benefits of the preloading, the clamping force must be higher than the joint separation load. For some joints, multiple fasteners are required to secure the joint; these are all hand tightened before the final torque is applied to ensure an even joint seating.

The preload achieved by torquing a bolt is caused by the part of the torque that is effective. Friction in the threads and under the nut or bolt head uses up some fraction of the applied torque. Much of the torque applied is lost overcoming friction under the torqued bolt head or nut (50%) and in the threads (40%). The remaining 10% of the applied torque does useful work in stretching the bolt and providing the preload. Initially, as the torque is applied, it must overcome static friction under the head of the bolt or nut (depending on which end is being torqued) and also in the threads. Finally, dynamic friction prevails and the torque is distributed in a 50/40/10 % manner as the bolt is tensioned. The torque value is dependent on the friction produced in the threads and under the torqued bolt head or nut and the fastened material or washer if used. This friction can be affected by the application of a lubricant or any plating (e.g. cadmium or zinc) applied to the threads, and the fastener&#x27;s standard defines whether the torque value is for dry or lubricated threading, as lubrication can reduce the torque value by 15% to 25%; lubricating a fastener designed to be torqued dry could over-tighten it, which may damage threading or stretch the fastener beyond its elastic limit, thereby reducing its clamping ability.

Either the bolt head or the nut can be torqued. If one has a larger bearing area or coefficient of friction it will require more torque to provide the same target preload. Fasteners should only be torqued if they are fitted in s.

Torque wrenches do not give a direct measurement of the preload in the bolt.

More accurate methods for determining the preload rely on defining or measuring the &quot;screw extension&quot; from the nut. Alternatively, measurement of the angular rotation of the nut can serve as the basis for defining screw extension based on the fastener&#x27;s thread pitch. Measuring the screw extension directly allows the clamping force to be very accurately calculated. This can be achieved using a dial test indicator, reading deflection at the fastener tail, using a strain gauge, or ultrasonic length measurement.

Bolt preload can also be controlled by torquing the bolt to the point of yielding. Under some circumstances, a skilled operator can feel the drop off of the work required to turn the torque wrench as the material of the bolt begins to yield. At that point the bolt has a preload determined by the bolt area and the yield strength of the bolt material. This technique can be more accurately executed by specially built machines. Because this method only works for very high preloads and requires comparatively expensive tooling, it is only commonly used for specific applications, primarily in high performance engines.

There is no (as yet) simple method to measure the tension of a fastener in situ. All methods, from the least to most accurate, involve first relaxing the fastener, then applying force to it and quantifying the resultant amount of elongation achieved. This is known as &#x27;re-torqueing&#x27; or &#x27;re-tensioning&#x27; depending on which technology is employed.

Technologies employed in this process can be:

An electronic torque wrench is used on the fastener in question, so that the torque applied can be measured as it is increased in magnitude.

Recent technological developments have enabled tensions to be established (± 1%) by using ultrasonic testing. This provides the same accuracy to that of strain gauging without having to set strain gauges on each fastener.

Another method that indicates tension (mainly in erecting steel) involves the use of crush-washers. These are washers that have been drilled and filled with orange RTV. When a given force has been applied (± 10%), orange rubber strands appear.

Large-volume users (such as auto makers) frequently use computer-controlled nut drivers. With such machines, the computer is in control of shutting off the torque mechanism when a predetermined value has been reached. Such machines are often used to fit and tighten wheel nuts on an assembly line, and have also been developed for use in mobile plant tire fitting bays on mine sites.

==Thread engagement==
&quot;Thread engagement&quot; is the length or number of threads that are engaged between the screw and the female threads. Bolted joints are designed so that the bolt shank fails in tension before the threads fail in shear, but for this to hold true, a minimum thread engagement must be achieved. The following equation defines this minimum thread engagement:
:formula_27

Where Le is the thread engagement length, At is the tensile stress area, D is the major diameter of the screw, and p is the pitch. This equation only holds true if the screw and female thread materials are the same. If they are not the same, then the following equations can be used to determine the additional thread length that is required:
:formula_28
:formula_29

Where Le2 is the new required thread engagement.

While these formulas give absolute minimum thread engagement, many industries specify that bolted connections be at least fully engaged. For instance, the FAA has determined that in general cases, at least one thread must be protruding from any bolted connection. 

== Failure modes ==
When doing a failure mode analysis for bolts that have broken, come loose or corroded, careful consideration must be given to the below failure modes:

;Overloading
:Overloading occurs when operating forces of the application produce loads that exceed the clamp load, causing the joint to loosen over time or fail catastrophically.
;Over-torquing
:Over-torquing might cause failure by damaging the threads and deforming the fastener, though this can happen over a very long time. Under-torquing can cause failures by allowing a joint to come loose, and it may also allow the joint to flex and thus fail under fatigue.
;Fatigue
:When axial or transverse loading overcomes the bolts preload or causes the bolt to slip transversely, movement in the bolt can cause small cracks to build up in the material eventually leading to fatigue failure of the bolt or male threaded component. According to Bill Eccles from boltscience, [In the vast majority of applications, the most effective way to ensure that the bolt is fatigue resistant is to ensure that it is tightened sufficiently...]
;Brinelling
:Brinelling may occur with poor quality washers, leading to a loss of clamp load and subsequent fatigue failure of the joint.
;Other failure modes
:Other modes of failure include corrosion, embedment, and exceeding the shear stress limit.

Bolted joints may be used intentionally as sacrificial parts, which are intended to fail before other parts, as in a shear pin.

== Locking mechanisms ==

Locking mechanisms keep bolted joints from coming loose. They are required when vibration or joint movement will cause loss of clamp load and joint failure, and in equipment where the security of bolted joints is essential. A prevalent test for the self-loosening behaviour is the Junker test.
;Jam nuts
:Two nuts, tightened on each other. In this application a thinner nut should be placed adjacent to the joint, and a thicker nut tightened onto it. The thicker nut applies more force to the joint, first relieving the force on the threads of the thinner nut and then applying a force in the opposite direction. In this way the thicker nut presses tightly on the side of the threads away from the joint, while the thinner nut presses on the side of the threads nearest the joint, tightly locking the two nuts against the threads in both directions.
;Prevailing torque nuts (locknuts)
:An insert on the internal threads (either metallic or non-metallic, e.g. Nyloc nut) or a plug/patch of non-metallic material on the external threads is installed. This material binds against the threads of the opposing fastener with a friction force and creates a prevailing torque, which resists the backing-out or loosening of the fastener. 
;Chemical locking compounds (thread-locking fluid)
:The use of a chemical locking compound binds the threads together when the compound cures. Examples of such a compound includes anaerobic compounds such as Loctite, which cures in the absence of oxygen and acts as an adhesive to lock the threads of the joint together. Chemical locking methods create friction after the breakaway torque. The prevail torque is usually higher than zero since the cured polymer still creates friction when rotating the nut.
;Safety wire (lockwire)
:Holes are drilled in nuts and bolt heads, and wire is threaded through the holes to prevent back-rotation. This method of locking is labor intensive, but is still used on critical joints.
; Locknuts
: Some portion of the nut deforms elastically during tightening to provide a locking action.
; Spring washers and lock washers
: A washer that bends axially during tightening. Spring washers create additional axial force whereas lock washers have parts that engage the surfaces in a way to provide more direct resistance against rotation.

==Bolt banging==
&quot;Bolt banging&quot; occurs in buildings when bolted joints slip into &quot;bearing under load&quot;, thus causing a loud and potentially frightening noise resembling a rifle shot that is not, however, of structural significance and does not pose any threat to occupants.

A bolted joint between two elements may act as a bearing-type joint, or a friction joint. In the friction joint, the elements are clamped together with enough force that the resultant friction between the clamped surfaces prevents them from slipping laterally over each other.

In the bearing joint, the bolt itself limits lateral movement of the elements by the shank of the bolt bearing upon the sides of the holes in the clamped elements. Such joints require less clamping force, because a high level of friction between the clamped surfaces is not required. The clearance between the bolt and the holes means that some lateral movement may occur before the bolt bears against the sides of the holes.

Even when designed as a bearing joint, the surface friction between the clamped elements may be sufficient to resist movement for some time, especially when the building may not yet be fully loaded – thus it operates initially as a friction joint. When the lateral force becomes sufficient to overcome this friction, the clamped elements move until the sides of the holes bear against the shank of the bolt. This movement – &quot;slip into bearing&quot; – usually starts and stops very suddenly, often releasing elastic energy in the associated elements, resulting in a loud but harmless bang.

<doc id="922092" wikidata="Q81707" url="?curid=922092" title="Teacup">
<text>A teacup is a cup for drinking tea. It generally has a small handle that may be grasped with the thumb and one or two fingers. It is typically made of a ceramic material and is often part of a set which is composed of a cup and a matching saucer or a trio that includes a small cake or sandwich plate. These may be part of a tea set combined with a teapot, cream jug, covered sugar bowl, and slop bowl. Teacups are often wider and shorter than coffee cups. Cups for morning tea are conventionally larger than cups for afternoon tea.

Higher quality teacups are typically made of fine white translucent porcelain and decorated with patterns. Some collectors acquire numerous one-of-a-kind cups with matching saucers. Such decorative cups may be souvenirs of a location, person, or event.

In Europe, fine porcelain tea cups, such as French Limoges porcelain from a kaolin base heated in ovens or Chinese porcelain, were a luxury for enjoying tea time. These cups are made with a handle and are paired with a saucer in a set and often feature hand painted decoration and gold or silver patterns, especially lining the rim and the handle.

In the Chinese culture teacups are very small and hold between 20 and 50 ml of liquid. They are designed to be used with Yixing teapots or Gaiwan. In Russian-speaking and West Asian cultures influenced by the Ottoman Empire tea is often served in a faceted glass held in a separate metal container with a handle, called a zarf in Turkish and Arabic, the podstakannik being its Russian cousin.

== History ==
The teacup and saucer originated in China at the time of the near-simultaneous introduction of tea and porcelain. The original teacup design did not have a handle or a saucer. At some point a ring-shaped cupholder appeared to protect the fingers and eventually evolved into a saucer. The cups in 17th century were tiny, with the width about 2¼ inches across at the top,1¼ at the bottom, and the depth of 1½ inches. The saucers measured 4½ inches across. The European manufacturers initially copied the handle-less Oriental designs exported from the Japanese port of Imari or from the southern Chinese port of Canton (part of the Canton System, 1757-1842), now Guangzhou. The teacup handles were introduced in the West in the early 19th century. The handles originally became a feature of chocolate drinking cups in the 17th century, while teacups were still handle-less.

Teacup plates originated in England in the early 1800s and provided a rest for the cup and a space for a light snack, went out of fashion in the second half of the 19th century.

== Culture ==
A small-scale research was done by Yang et al. in 2019 to test the influence of the teacup shape on the expert evaluation of the tea taste. Significant variations were found, lending some support to the &quot;you eat with your eyes&quot; concept.

Unicode codepoints and portray a teacup. is often rendered as a teacup.

<text>Martha Quinn is an American actress and radio and television personality, best known as one of the original video jockeys on MTV (along with Nina Blackwood, Mark Goodman, Alan Hunter, and J. J. Jackson).

== Early life ==

Quinn was born on May 11, 1959 in Albany, New York, the daughter of Nina Pattison, a retirement counselor, and David Quinn, an attorney. She is the stepdaughter of personal finance columnist Jane Bryant Quinn, and has two older brothers and a younger half-brother. Prior to joining MTV, Quinn graduated from Ossining High School in 1977, and NYU in 1981.

== MTV ==

On July 13, 1981, Quinn was working at NYU&#x27;s Weinstein Dormitory where she answered phones and gave students their toilet paper, mail, and lightbulbs. At the end of her day she decided to stop at WNBC (AM), where she had just finished up interning for her senior year. Coincidentally, California record company executive Burt Stein also was visiting WNBC. He asked out loud if anyone knew what Robert Pittman was doing. Pittman had been the program director of WNBC a year or so earlier, but had left to start a new venture: a cable channel called MTV (Music Television). WNBC assistant program director Buzz Brindle overheard Stein’s question and remembered the new venture. He turned to Quinn and suggested that she should try out for a role at the new network as a VJ. Brindle called Pittman and told him about his former intern, Quinn. Pittman told him to get her to the MTV studios immediately, as it was the last day of auditions. Quinn immediately took a cab to Hell&#x27;s Kitchen for her audition. Brindle&#x27;s idea had some merit. Quinn had spent much of her time at New York University doing two things: performing in TV commercials (McDonald&#x27;s, Country Time Lemonade, Clearasil, Campbell&#x27;s Soup) and working at WNYU-FM, the college radio station.

Quinn entered the studio knowing nothing about MTV or what its producers expected of her. She did a four-minute audition where she talked about Earth, Wind, and Fire; MTV executives immediately surrounded her, asking, &quot;Who are you? Where did you come from? How old are you?&quot; Quinn was stunned, realizing she had just found the perfect job for her talents. Two days later Quinn got the news she was an MTV VJ.

Quinn joined Mark Goodman, Nina Blackwood, Alan Hunter and J. J. Jackson as original faces and voices of MTV. Being hosts of the nation&#x27;s first music television network provided them with an in-depth and up-close perspective on the most popular rock/pop music and artists of the 1980s.

In 1986, Quinn took part in the then-World Wrestling Federation&#x27;s (later World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) Slammy Awards, conducting interviews backstage.

Quinn initially left MTV at the end of her contract in late 1986. However, she was rehired by the network in early 1989 and stayed with the channel until 1992.

=== Popularity ===
Quinn&#x27;s presence on MTV through 1991 was noted by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine readers, who voted her &quot;MTV&#x27;s Best-Ever VJ,&quot; and by &quot;Allure Magazine&quot;, which referred to the &#x27;80s decade as &quot;the Martha Quinn years.&quot; In a 2011 review of &quot;I Want My MTV&quot; by Craig Marks and Rob Tannenbaum, Dwight Garner recalled: &quot;Every sentient straight male in the country developed a schoolboy crush on Martha Quinn, one of the first V.J.&#x27;s, fresh out of New York University and so cute she could make your cranium detonate.&quot;

In the early ‘90s, she also hosted the MTV programs &quot;Martha&#x27;s Greatest Hits&quot;, &quot;MTV Prime with Martha Quinn&quot;, and &quot;Rockline&quot;. Critics have dubbed Quinn&#x27;s departure from MTV as &quot;the day the video music died.&quot; She was also the MTV host at Knebworth 1990.

== Acting roles ==

In 1984, Quinn appeared as herself in an episode of the short-lived sitcom &quot;E/R&quot;. Quinn played Tympani Charles in &quot;Dangerous Curves&quot; in 1988. In 1990, she appeared on the short-lived &quot;Brady Bunch&quot; sequel &quot;The Bradys&quot;. Quinn played Tracy, who married Bobby Brady (played by Mike Lookinland). She joined Ed McMahon as a co-host for &quot;Star Search&quot; in 1994. She was a bi-weekly correspondent on &quot;The Early Show&quot; in 1999. Her film appearances include 1988&#x27;s &quot;Tapeheads&quot;; the 1989 film sequel &quot;Eddie and the Cruisers II: Eddie Lives!&quot;; 1991&#x27;s &quot;Problem Child 2&quot; as Emily, a hot date that received a shocking introduction from John Ritter&#x27;s problematic son, Junior; and the 1992 low-budget horror film &quot;Bad Channels&quot;. She also had a recurring role on &quot;Full House&quot;. Quinn was featured in a series of commercials for Neutrogena in the mid-1990s.

== Career in the 21st century ==

In 2001, Quinn hosted &quot;Martha Quinn&#x27;s Rewind&quot;, a daily radio program that was aired on at least five Clear Channel radio stations in the United States.

In 2005, Quinn joined Sirius Satellite Radio network, hosting a one-hour weekly show from her home in Malibu called &quot;Martha Quinn Presents: Gods of the Big &#x27;80s&quot; for the Big &#x27;80s channel. After Sirius merged with XM Radio, the channel was rebranded as The 80s on 8, and the show was simply titled &quot;Martha Quinn Presents&quot;. Quinn joins the other surviving original MTV VJs in hosting programs for The 80s on 8 (10:00 am – 1:00 pm).

On the September 22, 2005 episode of Comedy Central&#x27;s new series &quot;The Showbiz Show with David Spade&quot;, Quinn appeared as herself in mock archival footage (dating back to 1983) from her MTV days. In two separate bumper skits, Quinn sarcastically foretold considerably bizarre behavior from stars Michael Jackson and Sting. Subsequent episodes took shots at Whitney Houston and Tommy Lee.

In 2007, Quinn lent her name, face and voice to &quot;The &#x27;80s Game with Martha Quinn&quot;, a PC trivia game developed by Funkitron. The game featured multiple-choice questions about 1980s culture in categories including music, politics, television, sports, movies and celebrities.

Quinn was on SiriusXM until 2016 when she left to host mornings for KOSF in San Francisco, owned by Bob Pittman&#x27;s iHeartMedia.

In December 2017, Quinn hosted a show for public television called &quot;The 80&#x27;s (My Music)&quot;.

Since January 2022, Quinn has been hosting &quot;The Martha Quinn Show&quot; for iHeartMedia, broadcasting across more than 35 iHeartMedia stations, including stations in San Francisco, Seattle, Milwaukee, Salt Lake City, Minneapolis, St. Louis and more.

==Personal life==
Quinn was vegetarian but has since become vegan.

In the 1980s, she dated Stiv Bators, frontman for punk band Dead Boys.

In 1992, she married musician Jordan Tarlow (ex-Fuzztones). They have two children.

In May 2023, Quinn was diagnosed with endometrial cancer.

== In popular culture ==
Quinn is featured prominently in Joe Hill&#x27;s post-apocalyptic novel &quot;The Fireman&quot;.

<text>Frank and Doris Hursley, were an American husband-and-wife television screenwriting duo, comprising Frank M. Hursley (November 21, 1902 – February 3, 1989) and Doris Hursley (September 29, 1898 – May 5, 1984) they were best known for their serials, especially the medical drama &quot;General Hospital.&quot;

== Career ==
The couple were writers on the Western series &quot;Have Gun, Will Travel&quot;, but became famous in the soap world in 1957 when they began writing for the CBS Daytime show &quot;Search for Tomorrow&quot;.

They continued to write for it even after co-creating a new show, &quot;General Hospital&quot;, in 1963. (Another married writing team, Theodore and Mathilde Ferro, wrote the show in its early months.) This medical drama was the first serious effort by ABC Daytime to create a daytime serial. Today, &quot;General Hospital&quot; is the longest-running daytime serial on American television. The duo head wrote the show until 1973, when they handed the reins to their daughter and son-in-law, Bridget and Jerome Dobson.

In 1969, the Hursleys created and wrote the NBC Daytime soap opera &quot;Bright Promise&quot; that starred Dana Andrews as college president Tom Boswell. However, they soon left that series and it was eventually cancelled in 1972.

The Hursleys retired from writing serials after being fired in 1973.

===Credits===
&quot;Love, American Style, Wagon Train, Have Gun – Will Travel, Whirlybirds, The Adventures of Jim Bowie, The Millionaire, Dr. Christian, Lassie, Matinee Theatre, The 20th Century-Fox Hour, The Moon is Blue &quot;

===Awards/nominations===
Frank and Doris were nominated for a Daytime Emmy Awards in 1974. They shared this nomination with their daughters Bridget (Dobson) and Deborah (Hardy).

===Lawsuit===
In April, 2011, the Hursleys&#x27; daughters filed a lawsuit against ABC over unpaid royalties. They claim that their parents struck a deal with ABC years earlier to reap 10% of all profits from the syndication of the show, but allege that ABC failed to pay the full amount owed to the creators.The lawsuit was ultimately settled out of court.

==Personal lives==

Doris Berger was the eldest daughter of Socialist Congressman Victor Berger and Socialist organizer/feminist Meta Berger and held a law degree from Marquette University.

Frank Hursley was a graduate of the University of Michigan (A.B. 1925). He left his first wife, Madeleine, and their one-year-old son, Frank Jr., both of Detroit, and became an English professor at the University of Wisconsin&#x27;s Milwaukee Extension.

After Doris&#x27;s divorce in 1935 from her first husband, Colin Welles, she married Frank Hursley in 1936. The couple began writing for radio during World War II and moved from their home in Thiensville, Wisconsin, to California in 1946.

Their daughter Bridget (1938–2024) became a television writer, creating soap opera &quot;Santa Barbara&quot;.

<doc id="922128" wikidata="Q4763449" url="?curid=922128" title="Anglican Communion Network">
<text>The Anglican Communion Network (ACN; officially the Network of Anglican Communion Dioceses and Parishes) was a theologically conservative network of Anglican and Episcopalian dioceses and parishes in the United States that was working toward Anglican realignment and developed into the Anglican Church in North America.

==Goals and structure==
Its key preoccupation was adhering to traditional, orthodox Christian doctrine in the Anglican Communion on subjects such as the infallibility of Scripture and sexual morality (especially regarding the ordination of non-celibate homosexuals and the blessing of same sex unions), particularly in the United States and Canada. Most of the dioceses and parishes were members of the Episcopal Church in the United States of America (ECUSA), while others were under the jurisdiction of overseas bishops from Uganda, Kenya, Bolivia and other countries.

The ACN also included a Forward in Faith convocation of churches, some of which were in the Continuing Anglican Movement. In January 2007, the ACN claimed to have the support of 200,000 laity and 2,200 clergy in ten dioceses and 900 congregations in the United States and Canada.

==Origins==

The ACN was officially formed in January 2004 at a conference in Plano, Texas, attended by several hundred priests and lay leaders, including 12 Episcopal bishops. Retired Florida Bishop Stephen Hays Jecko was a leader. Its main intent was to provide a system to supply theologically conservative leadership and church oversight to Anglicans in the United States and Canada.

The ACN was formed in response to suggestions by the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Most Reverend Rowan Williams, in the wake of the controversy regarding Anglican views of homosexuality. In the United States the initial controversy was the 2003 consecration of Gene Robinson as bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of New Hampshire. At the time of his election, Robinson was openly living with a same-sex partner.

Some issues date back to the adoption of 1979 Book of Common Prayer. Further controversy followed the election of Presiding Bishop Katharine Jefferts Schori. Statements made by Schori, such as &quot;Our mother Jesus gives birth to a new creation&quot;, have also been disputed.

In Canada the main trigger was the approval of the blessing of same-sex unions by the Diocese of Westminster, also in 2003. Most of the work in establishing the ACN was performed by the American Anglican Council, a group of theologically conservative congregations within the Episcopal Church.

The first ACN Moderator was Robert Duncan, seventh bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Pittsburgh (Episcopal Church), and first Archbishop of the Anglican Church in North America.

==Anglican Relief and Development Fund==
The Anglican Relief and Development Fund (ARDF) was created by the ACN in 2004 to be a support and humanitarian organisation working with Anglicans in the Global South. The ARDF works on multiple Millennium Development Goals projects throughout Africa, South America, and the Middle East. ARDF is supported by the Church of Nigeria, the Anglican Church of Kenya, the Province of South East Asia, the Church in the Province of the West Indies, and the Church of the Province of West Africa. In 2005 over $1.4 million was donated from ARDF.

==Youth and children==
Youth ministers from Network Dioceses gathered in Charlotte, North Carolina, prior to the November 2006 National Youthworker&#x27;s Convention hosted by Youth Specialties. During this meeting, speakers inspired participants to get back to the basics of faith, including instructing youth and children in Biblical literacy. Jack Gabig was the director of youth and children for the network.

==Network dioceses==
These are the dioceses of the Episcopal Church that were part of ACN from the beginning:
*Diocese of Albany (N.Y.)
*Diocese of Central Florida
*Diocese of Pittsburgh
*Diocese of Quincy (Illinois)
*Diocese of Rio Grande (Texas)
*Diocese of Springfield (Illinois)
*Diocese of Fort Worth (Texas)
*Diocese of South Carolina 
*Diocese of Dallas 
*Diocese of San Joaquin (California)

Subsequently, the conventions of the dioceses of San Joaquin, Pittsburgh, Quincy, and Fort Worth voted to leave the Episcopal Church. The departing members joined the Anglican Province of the Southern Cone and it is those dioceses that participated in the Network. The members of those dioceses that remained in the Episcopal Church did not indicate an interest in remaining part of the Network.

==Support from Anglican churches and ministries==
The Common Cause Partnership, founded in June 2004, is an alliance of several churches and ministries that support ACN. The initial meeting was followed by a gathering in February 2005 that resulted in a Statement of Common Cause Partners in North America.

The Common Cause Partners are:

*American Anglican Council 
*Anglican Coalition in Canada 
*Anglican Mission in America 
*Anglican Network in Canada 
*Anglican Province of America 
*Convocation of Anglicans in North America 
*Forward in Faith North America
*Reformed Episcopal Church

==Ecumenical relations==
In a 2005 meeting, the ACN requested that its moderator send a letter to Pope Benedict XVI to express its greetings and support for upholding the historic teaching and faith of the Church.

<text>A standard drink or (in the UK) unit of alcohol is a measure of alcohol consumption representing a fixed amount of pure alcohol. The notion is used in relation to recommendations about alcohol consumption and its relative risks to health. It helps to inform alcohol users.

A hypothetical alcoholic beverage sized to one standard drink varies in volume depending on the alcohol concentration of the beverage (for example, a standard drink of spirits takes up much less space than a standard drink of beer), but it always contains the same amount of alcohol and therefore produces the same amount of intoxication. Many government health guidelines specify low to high risk amounts in units of grams of pure alcohol per day, week, or single occasion. These government guidelines often illustrate these amounts as standard drinks of various beverages, with their serving sizes indicated. Although used for the same purpose, the definition of a standard drink varies from country to country.

Labeling beverages with the equivalent number of standard drinks is common in some countries.

==Definitions in various countries==

The definition of what constitutes a standard drink varies very widely between countries, with what each country defines as the amount of pure alcohol in a standard drink ranging from 8 to 20 grams.

The sample questionnaire form for the World Health Organization&#x27;s Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) uses , and this definition has been adopted by more countries than any other amount. Some countries choose to base the definition on mass of alcohol (in grams) while others base the unit on the volume (in ml or other volume units). For comparison, both measurements are shown here, as well as the number of standard drinks contained in of 5% ABV beer (a typical large size of beer in Europe, slightly larger than a US pint of 473 mL). The terminology for the unit also varies, as shown in the Notes column.

==Calculation of pure alcohol by mass==

It is possible to calculate the pure alcohol mass in a serving from the concentration, density of alcohol, and volume:
formula_1

For example, a glass of beer with an ABV of 5.5% contains 19.525 ml of pure alcohol, which has a density of 0.78945 g/mL (at 20 °C), and therefore a mass of .
formula_2
or
formula_3

When the drink size is in fluid ounces (which differ between the UK and the US), the following conversions can be used:
One should bear in mind that a pint in the UK is 20 imperial fluid ounces, whereas a pint in the US is 16 US fluid ounces, and that 1 imperial fl. oz. ≈ US fl. oz.: this means that 1 imperial pint ≈ US pints.

==Calculation of units of alcohol by volume==

Calculating alcoholic content in countries that use units of alcohol is straightforward, as the volume multiplied by the Alcohol by volume (ABV) gives the alcohol content. In the UK, one unit of alcohol equals one percentage point per litre, of any alcoholic beverage.

formula_4

The standard UK units of alcohol in a drink can be determined by multiplying the volume of the drink (expressed in litres) by its percentage ABV. For example, a standard bottle of wine at 12% ABV contains:

:formula_5

One UK standard measure of spirits (25ml, 0.025 L) at 40% ABV contains:

:formula_6

One imperial pint (568ml, 0.568 L) of beer at 4% ABV contains:

:formula_7

In the UK, both volume and ABV are usually given on bottles, drinks menus and so on, and so are easy to retrieve.

== Reference standard drinks ==

A standard drink is often different from a normal serving in the country in which it is served. For example, in the United States, a standard drink is defined as of ethanol per serving, which is about 14 grams of alcohol. This corresponds to a can of 5% beer, a glass of 12% ABV (alcohol by volume) wine, or a so-called &quot;shot&quot; of spirit, assuming that beer is 5% ABV, wine is 12% ABV, and spirits is 40% ABV (80 proof). Most wine today is higher than 12% ABV (the average ABV in Napa Valley in 1971 was 12.5%), hence will be more than a standard drink. Similarly, although 40% ABV is standard for spirits, the amount of spirit in a mixed drink varies widely.

=== Beers ===
* Half an imperial pint of beer with 3.5% ABV contains almost exactly one UK unit; however, most beers are stronger. In pubs in the United Kingdom, beers generally range from 3.5 to 5.5% ABV, and continental lagers start at around 4% ABV. An imperial pint of such lager (at 5.2% ABV) contains almost 3 units of alcohol rather than the oft-quoted 2 units.
* Stronger beer (6–12%) may contain 2 UK units or more per imperial half pint.
* A half-litre (500 ml) of standard lager or ale (5%) contains 2.5 UK units.
* One litre (1000 ml) of typical Oktoberfest beer (5.5–6%) contains 5.5–6 UK units of alcohol.
* A beer bottle is typically between , approximately 1.7 UK units at 5%.
* can of light beer (2.7% alcohol) = 0.8 Australian standard drinks
* can of mid-strength beer (3.5% alcohol) = 1 Australian standard drink
* can of full strength beer (4.8% alcohol) = 1.4 Australian standard drinks
* of 5% ABV beer = 1 US standard drink

=== Wines ===

* A &quot;medium&quot; glass ( of 12% ABV wine contains around 2.1 units of alcohol. However, British pubs and restaurants often supply larger quantities (large glass ≈ ), which contain 3 units. Red wines often have a higher alcohol content (on average 12.5%, sometimes up to 16%). Even though the sizes of wine glasses are defined in UK law, the terms &quot;large&quot;, &quot;medium&quot;, &quot;standard&quot;, etc. are not defined in law.
* A bottle of 12% ABV wine contains 9 units; 16% ABV wine contains 12 units; a fortified wine such as port at 20% ABV contains 15 units.
* glass of wine (13.5% alcohol) = 1 Australian standard drink
* glass of wine (13.5% alcohol) = 1.5 Australian standard drinks
* One glass of 12% ABV table wine is one US standard drink.

=== Fortified wines ===
* A small glass () of sherry, fortified wine, or cream liqueur (≈20% ABV) contains about one unit.

=== Spirits ===
Most spirits sold in the United Kingdom have 35%-40% ABV. In England, a single pub measure () of a spirit contains one unit. However, a larger measure is increasingly used (and in particular is standard in Northern Ireland), which contains 1.4 units of alcohol at 40% ABV. Sellers of spirits by the glass must state the capacity of their standard measure in ml.

In Australia, a shot of spirits (40% ABV) is 0.95 standard drinks.

In the US, one shot of 80 proof liquor is , which is one US standard drink.

=== Mixed spirits and alcopops ===
* can of pre-mix spirits (approx. 5% alcohol) = 1.7 Australian standard drinks
* can pre-mix spirits (approx. 7% alcohol) = 2.4 Australian standard drinks
* According to Alcohol and You Northern Ireland resource website, &quot;Most alcopops contain 1.1–1.5 units per bottle. For example, a normal bottle of WKD contains 1.1 units, whereas Bacardi Breezer and Smirnoff Ice both contain 1.5 units of alcohol.&quot;

== Recommended maximum==
From 1992 to 1995, the UK government advised that men should drink no more than 21 units per week, and women no more than 14. (The difference between the sexes was due to the typically lower weight and water-to-body-mass ratio of women). &quot;The Times&quot; claimed in October 2007 that these limits had been &quot;plucked out of the air&quot; and had no scientific basis.

This was changed after a government study showed that many people were in effect &quot;saving up&quot; their units and using them at the end of the week, a form of binge drinking. Since 1995 the advice was that regular consumption of 3–4 units a day for men, or 2–3 units a day for women, would not pose significant health risks, but that consistently drinking four or more units a day (men), or three or more units a day (women), is not advisable.

An international study of about 6,000 men and 11,000 women for a total of 75,000 person-years found that people who reported that they drank more than a threshold value of 2 units of alcohol a day had a higher risk of fractures than non-drinkers. For example, those who drank over 3 units a day had nearly twice the risk of a hip fracture.

==Relation to blood alcohol content==

As a rough guide, it takes about one hour for the body to metabolise (break down) one UK unit of alcohol, 10 ml (8 grams). However, this will vary with body weight, sex, age, personal metabolic rate, recent food intake, the type and strength of the alcohol, and medications taken. Alcohol may be metabolised more slowly if liver function is impaired. For other countries, it may be easiest to convert to UK units. For example, in the United States one standard drink contains 14 grams ≈ 1.75 units of alcohol, and so a US standard drink takes the body about an hour and three-quarters to process. Blood alcohol content can more accurately be estimated by using Widmark&#x27;s formula.

== Labeling ==

Australia introduced standard drink labelling in the 1990s, and New Zealand followed with a labelling requirement starting in 2002. The labels were criticized for being too small to read. A focus group study found that most student drinkers used the labels to choose stronger drinks and identify the cheapest method of getting drunk, rather than to drink safely.

In the UK in March 2011, alcohol companies voluntarily pledged to the UK Department of Health to implement a health labelling scheme to provide more information about responsible drinking on alcohol labels and containers. The pledge stated:

: &quot;We will ensure that over 80% of products on shelf (by December 2013) will have labels with clear unit content, NHS guidelines and a warning about drinking when pregnant.&quot;

At the end of 2014, 101 companies had committed to the pledge labelling scheme.

There are five elements included within the overall labelling scheme, the first three being mandatory, and the last two optional:
# Unit alcohol content per container &quot;(mandatory)&quot;, and per serving &quot;(optional)&quot;. Typical servings deliver 1–3 units of alcohol.
# Chief Medical Officer&#x27;s daily guidelines for lower-risk consumption
# Pregnancy warning (in text or as a graphic)
# Mention of &quot;drinkaware.co.uk&quot; &quot;(optional)&quot;
# Responsibility statement (e.g., &quot;please drink responsibly&quot;) &quot;(optional)&quot;
: &quot;Further detailed specifications about the labelling scheme are available from the &quot;Alcohol labelling tool kit&quot;.&quot;

Drinks companies had pledged to display the three mandatory items on 80% of drinks containers on shelves in the UK off-trade by the end of December 2013. A report published in November 2014, confirmed that UK drinks producers had delivered on that pledge with a 79.3% compliance with the pledge elements as measured by products on shelf. Compared with labels from 2008 on a like-for-like basis, information on Unit alcohol content had increased by 46%; 91% of products displayed alcohol and pregnancy warnings (18% in 2008); and 75% showed the Chief Medical Officers&#x27; lower risk daily guidelines (6% in 2008).

Studies published in 2021 in the UK showed that the label could be further enhanced by including pictures of units and a statement of the drinking guidelines - this would help people understand the recommended limits better.

<text>Scott A. Frandsen (born 21 July 1980) is a Canadian rower of Danish and Swedish descent.

==Biography==
Born in Kelowna, British Columbia, he began rowing at age 16 at Brentwood College School, in Mill Bay, British Columbia.

He crewed for four years at the University of California, Berkeley. His freshman boat in 1999, coached by Craig Amerkhanian, finished second at the Intercollegiate Rowing Association championship, which serves as the national championship race for men&#x27;s collegiate rowing in the United States. In 2000, 2001, and 2002, he was in the varsity eight man crew, which won the IRA championship each year. In 2000 and 2001, his boats were undefeated and are considered by many as the fastest collegiate boats ever.

In 2003, he went to St Edmund Hall, Oxford, for graduate work. There he crewed for the university in the Oxford Blue Boat against rivals Cambridge in The Boat Race. Despite their diminutive stature his Oxford crew won a dramatic race by the smallest ever recorded margin (one foot), and in so winning, they overturned the biggest weight deficit in the history of the contest. They achieved this by over-rating and out-racing their heavier Cambridge counterparts on the outside of the long Surrey bend through the middle of the race. This took considerable guts and fortitude, and the attitude the crew exemplified in doing so was reflective of Frandsen&#x27;s natural tenacity and stubbornness. Commentators cite this tenacity as the main factor allowing the Oxford crew to upset the much bigger, more powerful and more experienced 2003 Cambridge boat.

Frandsen went on to row that summer with one of his Cambridge rivals from the 2003 Boat Race, Wayne Pommen, at the 2003 World Rowing Championships in Milan. The Boat Race pairing took sixth place for Canada in a hotly contested final of the coxless pairs event.

The following year Frandsen pursued selection for the 2004 Athens Olympics. He won two gold medals on the 2004 World Cup circuit, both in the Men&#x27;s Eight event (in Munich, Germany and in Lucerne, Switzerland). At the 2004 Summer Olympics he was in the Canadian Men&#x27;s Eight (M8+) which was the favourite for the event. His boat narrowly lost out to the Americans in the Heat, with both crews going under the previous World Record time. Come the Final the Canadians had a disappointing row and finished out of the medals in fifth place.

In 2005, Frandsen was again in the Canadian Men&#x27;s Eight. This time, his boat finished seventh at the World Championships held in Gifu-Nagaragawa, Japan. After a frustrating couple of years in the Canadian National Team system, at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, China Scott won a silver medal in the Men&#x27;s coxless pairs with Dave Calder. It was Canada&#x27;s first medal of the Games. Terry Paul coached them for the event.

He and David Calder teamed again at the 2012 Summer Olympics, finishing 6th in the final.

<text>Kevin Richard Light (born May 16, 1979) is a Canadian rower. 

==Early life==
He was born in Vancouver, British Columbia but has lived in Victoria since 1985. 

He began rowing in grade 12 at Stelly&#x27;s Secondary School, from which he graduated in 1997. He was enrolled at the University of Victoria from 1997 until 2001, where he was part of numerous Canadian University Rowing Championships teams. The highlight of his university rowing career came in 2001 when the University of Victoria beat the University of Washington at the Opening Day Regatta.

Light graduated from the Victoria Motion Picture School in 2004/2005 and then the Western Academy of Photography in 2008/2009, where he studied photojournalism.

==Career==
Light won the gold medal at both the 2002 and 2003 World Rowing Championships in the eight. He competed in the eight at the 2004 Summer Olympics, where he and his crew finished fifth. At the 2006 World Rowing Championships, Light represented Canada along with fellow Victoria rower Malcolm Howard in the men&#x27;s coxless pair, where they won the bronze medal. In 2007, Light won the gold medal in the eight.

He was named to the Canadian men&#x27;s eight for the 2008 Summer Olympics, where he won the gold medal with Andrew Byrnes, Kyle Hamilton, Malcolm Howard, Adam Kreek, Ben Rutledge, Dominic Sieterle, Jake Wetzel and cox Brian Price.

In September 2012, he was brought on at Claremont Secondary School as a coach and manager. For his debut as head coach at the CSSRA in St. Catharines, Ontario, Light led the team to gold medals in three different events: the senior women&#x27;s quad, the junior men&#x27;s double and the junior men&#x27;s quad. He coached throughout the next three years, leaving in June 2015.

<doc id="922145" wikidata="Q1218876" url="?curid=922145" title="Zulu Dawn">
<text>Zulu Dawn is a 1979 American adventure war film directed by Douglas Hickox and written by Anthony Storey and Cy Endfield. It is based on Endfield&#x27;s book of the same name about the historical Battle of Isandlwana in 1879 between British and Zulu forces in South Africa.

&quot;Zulu Dawn&quot; features an ensemble cast led by Burt Lancaster, Peter O&#x27;Toole, Simon Ward, and Nigel Davenport. Chronologically it precedes the smaller Battle of Rorke&#x27;s Drift, which also had opposing British and Zulu forces. &quot;Zulu&quot; (1964) was a film about the latter battle. 

==Plot==

In the Cape Colony in January 1879, British Army officer Lord Chelmsford plots with diplomat Sir Henry Bartle Frere to annex the neighbouring Zulu Empire, which they perceive as a threat to the Cape Colony&#x27;s emerging industrial economy. 

Frere issues an ultimatum to the Zulu king, Cetshwayo, demanding that he dissolve the Zulu military; an indignant Cetshwayo rebuffs the demand, providing Lord Chelmsford and Frere with a &quot;casus belli&quot; against the Zulu. Despite objections from prominent individuals in the Cape Colony and Britain, Frere authorises Lord Chelmsford to command a British expeditionary force to invade the Zulu Empire.

The British expeditionary force marches into the Zulu Empire, with Lord Chelmsford directing it towards the Zulu capital, Ulundi. Eager to bring the war to a swift conclusion, the British become increasingly frustrated as the Zulu military adopted a Fabian strategy, refusing to engage in a pitched battle; a few skirmishes occurred between British and Zulu scouts with indecisive results. Three Zulu warriors allowed themselves to be captured in a skirmish and are interrogated by the British, but refused to divulge any information and eventually escape, informing their commander of the British dispositions. Halfway to Ulundi, Lord Chelmsford ordered the British force to make camp at the base of Mount Isandlwana, ignoring the advice of his Boer attendants to fortify the camp and transform his supply wagons into a laager.

Upon receiving inaccurate reports from his scouts concerning the Zulus&#x27; dispositions, Lord Chelmsford leads half the British force on a wild goose chase far from the camp against a phantom Zulu force. The next day, the British camp receives reinforcements led by Colonel Durnford, who dispatches scouts to reconnoiter the surrounding area before leaving the camp to personally scout the region. One of the British scouting parties discovers a Zulu force massing at the bottom of a nearby valley. The Zulu force quickly attacks the British camp, but are initially repulsed; however, they spread out and adopt a strategy of encircling the British, who are eventually pushed back after they run out of ammunition. A massed infantry charge by the Zulu force breaks the British lines, causing them to retreat back towards their camp. Overwhelmed by the attacking Zulus, the British force collapses and is quickly massacred.

Zulu warriors quickly hunt down any British survivors fleeing the battle, while several British soldiers attempt an unsuccessful last stand. The British camp&#x27;s commander, Colonel Pulleine, entrusts a regimental colour to his soldiers, who attempt to carry it safely back to the Cape Colony; they pass numerous dead and dying British soldiers during their journey. Eventually reaching the Buffalo River, the British soldiers are discovered and killed by Zulu warriors; the colour is captured by a Zulu. Lieutenant Vereker, who lies wounded and trapped under his fallen horse, shoots and kills the Zulu wielding the colour, who drops it into the river, where it floats out of reach of the Zulu force. 

In the evening, Lord Chelmsford returns to the scene of the battle, and receives news that a Zulu force has attacked Rorke&#x27;s Drift. Zulu warriors drag captured artillery back to Ulundi.

==Cast==
==Production==
The script was originally written by Cy Endfield.

The Lamitas Property Investment Corporation financed a series of films, including several in South Africa, such as &quot;The Wild Geese&quot; (1978). The company committed about £5 million to &quot;Zulu Dawn&quot;, most of it raised from a Swiss bank, the Banque de Paris et des Pays-Bas. HBO helped guarantee finance. Initially set at $6.5 million, the budget kept increasing. The film ultimately cost $11.75 million, despite coming in only two days over schedule. Jake Eberts was involved in raising financing; he had to guarantee Lancaster&#x27;s salary when Lancaster&#x27;s agent insisted on one. This meant Eberts was liable for the loan. In 1983, interest made this £450,000. Eberts spent years paying it back.

John Hurt was cast in a lead role but was refused entry to South Africa. This confused Hurt, who was not particularly active politically. It was thought South African Intelligence may have confused him with the actor John Heard, who had been arrested in an anti-Apartheid march.

===Shooting===
Every day of filming, more than 1,000 people were involved. Zulu extras were paid £2.70 per day.

In 1978, producers and financiers agreed to defer fees and no completion guarantee was in place. Norma Foster was a liaison between the South African government (notably the Minister of Information, Dr Connie Mulder) and the filmmakers; she later claimed the producers owed £20,000. Co-producers James Faulkner and Barrie Saint Clair claim they were owed £100,000 in deferred fees. Over 100 South African creditors allege they were owed £250,000. Faulkner and Saint Clair sought an injunction to block screenings until they were paid. Lamitas denied liability, claiming expenses exceeded the agreed budget, and the injunction was lifted May 21, 1979. They later offered to settle for £25 on the pound.

===Music===
In 1978, David Japp, founder and MD of London-based composers agency The First Composers Company, met producer Nate Kohn and suggested he use composer Mike Batt – an accomplished composer and arranger of orchestral music best known for his pop compositions for children&#x27;s TV series &quot;The Wombles&quot; and the pop-chart hits of the songs from the series, and, in particular, for the song &quot;Bright Eyes&quot; from the animated film &quot;Watership Down&quot; (1978) – to commission to the score. However, shortly after the agreement was signed and the first third of the fee paid, Kohn informed Japp that the producers had changed their minds and wanted a &quot;name&quot; to help with the film&#x27;s promotion. Devastated, Batt refused to accept the rest of the &quot;pay or play&quot; fee, due under the terms of the signed agreement.

Japp sent his US client list to Kohn, who selected Elmer Bernstein (&quot;The Magnificent Seven&quot;, &quot;The Ten Commandments&quot;, &quot;The Great Escape&quot;, &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot;, and &quot;Thoroughly Modern Millie&quot;, for the last of which Bernstein had won an Oscar). Japp negotiated the highest fee that Bernstein had ever been paid. Only after the score had been recorded at Abbey Road Studios and the film shown at Cannes did Japp find out the producers mistakenly thought they were hiring Leonard Bernstein, famed conductor and composer of dozens of orchestral compositions and film scores, notably &quot;West Side Story&quot;. 

==Reception==
The film has received mixed reviews. On review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes, &quot;Zulu Dawn&quot; has an approval rating of 50% based on 8 reviews and an average rating of 6.03/10.

<text>Ben Rutledge (born November 9, 1980, in Cranbrook, British Columbia) was a Canadian Olympic rower and is currently a Mortgage Broker.

In Seville, Spain 2002 he was a member of Canada&#x27;s inaugural Men&#x27;s 8+ crew to win a gold medal at a World Championship regatta. He accomplished this task two more times in 2003 and 2007 in Milan, Italy, and Munich, Germany.

His Olympic results include a disappointing fifth-place finish in the men&#x27;s 8+ at the 2004 Athens Olympics. However, after a hard-fought 4-year comeback, Ben and his teammates Andrew Byrnes, Kyle Hamilton, Malcolm Howard, Adam Kreek, Kevin Light, Dominic Sieterle, Jake Wetzel and cox Brian Price won a gold medal at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, China.

In 2006 he was the recipient of the Bobby Gaul Memorial Trophy an award presented by the University of British Columbia to the graduating male athlete who best combines the qualities of leadership and sportsmanship.

In 2006 he combined with former Canada National Team rower Robert Weitemeyer as well as varsity athletes Stephane Gervais, Robert Miller and Kevin Johns to capture the overall Men&#x27;s Championship for Storm the Wall, a relay race held annually at the University of British Columbia, widely considered as the largest intramural event in North America.

== Education ==
Ben attended Mount Baker Secondary School located in Cranbrook, B.C.

Rutledge graduated from the Sauder School of Business in University of British Columbia with a Bachelor of Commerce, specializing in Real Estate and Marketing in 2006.

<text>Adam Kreek (born December 2, 1980) is an author, executive business coach and Canadian rower. He is a member of the BC Sports Hall of Fame and the Ontario Sports Hall of Fame.

After his athletic career, Kreek&#x27;s work has focused upon executive leadership and performance, and in 2019 he published his first book The Responsibility Ethic: 12 Strategies Exceptional People Use to Do the Work and Make Success Happen. As Adam Kreek says, “The grit that’s required for success in athletics is the same grit that’s required for success in business.” After publishing, this book became a bestseller and appeared regularly on British Columbia&#x27;s business book bestseller list.

Adam Kreek is a champion for men&#x27;s health where he works to promote the adoption of healthy behaviour changes in working aged individuals.

==Early life==
Born in London, Ontario, he was a student at the University of Victoria where he met his wife Rebecca. After the Athens Olympics, he moved to Stanford University to complete a degree in Geotechnical Engineering and Hydrology and continue his rowing career there under Coach Craig Amerkhanian. In 2005 Kreek took the summer off to get married and spend time with his wife. Kreek coached at Stanford Rowing Center in 2006 and 2007 for the Junior Crew.

==Athletic career==
He won the gold medal at the 2002, 2003 and 2007 world championships for Canada&#x27;s men&#x27;s eight team in Seville, Spain, Milan, Italy and Munich, Germany respectively. At the 2004 Summer Olympics, Kreek competed with the Canadian men&#x27;s eight, who were widely expected to win a medal but ultimately finished in fifth place.

He won a gold medal at the 2008 Summer Olympics in the men&#x27;s eights with Andrew Byrnes, Kyle Hamilton, Malcolm Howard, Kevin Light, Ben Rutledge, Dominic Seiterle, Jake Wetzel and cox Brian Price. Kreek&#x27;s singing of O Canada at the medal ceremony was cited as an inspiration by Simon Whitfield, who won a silver medal in the triathlon. Whitfield wrote &quot;Sing like Adam Kreek&quot; on the handlebars of his bicycle and repeated &quot;Sing like Kreek&quot; to himself near the end of the race.

On 23 January 2013, Kreek set off with three other rowers, Markus Pukonen, Jordan Hanssen and Pat Fleming to attempt the first-ever row from mainland Africa to North America, recording it for classroom lessons in schools across the United States and Canada. On 6 April 2013, 73 days into the 6,700-kilometre transatlantic rowing expedition, the boat capsized in the Bermuda Triangle. The crew called for help through a personal locator beacon attached to a life-jacket and were successfully located and rescued. The expedition was sponsored by the Canadian Wildlife Federation and Ocean Adventure, Rowing and Education (OAR Northwest). A computer program developed at the University of Victoria monitored the crew&#x27;s activities and ensured they followed a strict schedule that maximized their energy and mental sharpness. There was also scientific equipment on board to monitor the ocean conditions and marine life.

==Athletic heritage==
His grandfather Aleksander Kreek was an Estonian shot putter and the 1938 European champion in the event before he emigrated to Canada in the 1950s.

<text>Andrew N Hoskins (born December 20, 1975) is a Canadian rower. He is a graduate of the University of Alberta. He won the gold medal at both the 2003 and 2002 world championships for Canada&#x27;s men&#x27;s eight team in Milan, Italy and Seville, Spain respectively. Hoskins comes from a long line of rowers on his mother&#x27;s side: He is the grandson of Ted Lindstrom; the nephew of Olympian David Lindstrom (Montreal 1976), and the cousin of Olympian George Keys (Seoul 1988).

Hoskins began rowing at the Edmonton Rowing Club as a form of physical therapy to recondition his shoulder shortly after recovering in 1996. Just two years later, in 1998, Hoskins won gold at Royal Canadian Henley in the Intermediate Single and Senior Single. Hoskins tried out for and made the Canadian rowing team later that year. For the 2000 Olympics in Sydney, he was a member of the Spares Club along with celebrated lightweights Ben Storey and Edward Winchester.

After a coaching purge in Canadian rowing, 2001 marked the arrival of Mike Spracklen as head coach of the men&#x27;s program. Under Spracklen, Hoskins served as the captain of the men&#x27;s program when the 8+ won a gold medal at both the 2002 and 2003 world championships in Spain and Italy respectively. Although favoured to win gold in Athens in 2004, the 8+ finished in a disappointing fifth place, well behind the USA boat, their arch-rivals leading up to the Games.

<text>The First Peoples Party (FPP) was a short-lived political-party in Manitoba, Canada.

==History==

The FPP was created following a 1993 resolution by the Assembly of Manitoba Chiefs, endorsing a political party to focus on aboriginal issues. The party was officially founded in November 1994, and fielded three candidates in the 1995 provincial election. The FPP was not registered with Elections Manitoba, and its candidates appeared on the ballot as independents.

The FPP argued that all aboriginal peoples in Canada possess an inherent right to self-government, and claimed the established political parties were not giving sufficient attention to aboriginal concerns. The party also highlighted issues of sustainable development and the environment. Jerry Fontaine was recognized as the party&#x27;s leader, although it is not clear if he held an official title within the party. A former Liberal Party candidate, Fontaine emphasized that the FPP was open to all Manitobans and not only those of aboriginal background.

Some members of Manitoba&#x27;s aboriginal community opposed the FPP&#x27;s creation. George Hickes, a New Democratic Party (NDP) legislator of Inuit background, argued that the principle of an aboriginal party is inappropriate for Canada&#x27;s constituency-based electoral system. Elected politicians, he argued, are required to represent diverse communities. Referring to his own ethnically diverse Point Douglas constituency, Hickes said, &quot;You have Ukrainians, Filipinos, Chinese. What happens to them... if you&#x27;re running to represent only one group of people?&quot;

The FPP was largely unsuccessful as a political party. Fontaine ran a credible campaign in the vast northern constituency of Rupertsland, but nonetheless finished in fourth place with 541 votes. Una Truscott received 262 votes in the Winnipeg constituency of Broadway, while Lyle Morrisseau received 105 votes in neighbouring Point Douglas. The NDP won all three constituencies.

In the middle of the campaign, two candidates from a separate party called Independent Native Voice also joined the FPP: Nelson Contois and his daughter Carey Contois. Three years later, allegations arose that the Contois candidacies were sponsored by Progressive Conservative Party organizers to encourage vote-splitting with the NDP. The FPP was not implicated in this scandal.

The First Peoples Party dissolved after the 1995 election. Fontaine subsequently rejoined the Liberals, and ran for the leadership of that party in 1998. He was defeated by Jon Gerrard.

In 2000, a separate First Peoples Party was founded in British Columbia under the leadership of Don Moss. This was later renamed as the All Nations Party of British Columbia. A federal First Peoples National Party of Canada was established in 2005, based in part on the FPP.

==Election results==

If the Contois candidacies are included, the figures become:

==FPP candidates==

===Una Truscott (Broadway)===

Truscott was the first candidate nominated for the FPP. She was a 28-year-old university student at the time of the election, and her campaign focused on sustainable development and the environment. She received 262 votes (4.01%), finishing fourth in a field of four candidates. The winner was Conrad Santos of the New Democratic Party.

Truscott later worked as the Aboriginal Public Administration Program Intern for the Office of the Children&#x27;s Advocate of Manitoba, and became the Aboriginal Cultural and Spiritual Liaison at the St. Amant Centre.

===Lyle Morrisseau (Point Douglas)===

Morrisseau is a member of the Sagkeeng First Nation, and also holds the name Kah Kimi Watha Pimi Whata (Day Walker). He served on the student council of the Saskatchewan Indian Federated College in the early 1990s. In January 1994, he was a spokesman for the 1992 Committee Supporting 500 Years of Indigenous Resistance at an anti-North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) rally in Winnipeg. Morrisseau endorsed the actions of indigenous rebels in the Mexican state of Chiapas, and drew parallels between the conditions of aboriginal people in Mexico, Canada and the United States.

He received 105 votes (2.14%) in the 1995 election, finishing fourth against New Democratic Party candidate George Hickes. Soon after the election, Morrisseau participated in a protest by the Nuxalk nation in British Columbia against local logging activities as a representative of the First Nations Environmental Network.

Morrisseau remained active with environmental issues after 1995. In 1997, he spoke out against the burial of nuclear waste on aboriginal land.

In 2000, Morrisseau and Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) officer Ron MacRae used CPR to revive a trucker whom witnessed initially believed was dead at the scene of an accident. The newspaper report of this incident listed Morrisseau as living in Fort Alexander, Manitoba.

===Jerry Fontaine (Rupertsland)===

Fontaine received 541 votes (12.22%), finishing fourth against NDP candidate Eric Robinson.

<doc id="922164" wikidata="Q5264373" url="?curid=922164" title="Design research">
<text>Design research was originally constituted as primarily concerned with ways of supporting and improving the process of design, developing from work in design methods. The concept has been expanded to include research embedded within the process of design and research-based design practice, research into the cognitive and communal processes of designing, and extending into wider aspects of socio-political, ethical and environmental contexts of design. It retains a sense of generality, recognising design as a creative act common to many fields, and aimed at understanding design processes and practices quite broadly.

== Origins ==

Design research emerged as a recognisable field of study in the 1960s, initially marked by a conference on Design methods at Imperial College London, in 1962. It led to the founding of the Design Research Society (DRS) in 1966. John Christopher Jones (one of the initiators of the 1962 conference) founded a postgraduate Design Research Laboratory at the University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology, and L. Bruce Archer supported by Misha Black founded the postgraduate Department of Design Research at the Royal College of Art, London, becoming the first Professor of Design Research.

The Design Research Society has always stated its aim as: ‘to promote the study of and research into the process of designing in all its many fields’. Its purpose therefore is to act as a form of learned society, taking a scholarly and domain independent view of the process of designing.

Some of the origins of design methods and design research lay in the emergence after the 2nd World War of operational research methods and management decision-making techniques, the development of creativity techniques in the 1950s, and the beginnings of computer programs for problem solving in the 1960s. A statement by Bruce Archer encapsulated what was going on: ‘The most fundamental challenge to conventional ideas on design has been the growing advocacy of systematic methods of problem solving, borrowed from computer techniques and management theory, for the assessment of design problems and the development of design solutions.’ Herbert A. Simon established the foundations for ‘a science of design’, which would be ‘a body of intellectually tough, analytic, partly formalizable, partly empirical, teachable doctrine about the design process.’

==Early work==
Early work was mainly within the domains of architectural design and industrial design. Research in engineering design developed strongly in the 1980s, for example, through ICED—the series of International Conferences on Engineering Design, now run by The Design Society. These developments were especially strong in Germany and Japan. In the USA there were also some important developments in design theory and methodology, including the publications of the Design Methods Group and the series of conferences of the Environmental Design Research Association. The National Science Foundation initiative on design theory and methods led to substantial growth in engineering design research in the late-1980s. A particularly significant development was the emergence of the first journals of design research: &quot;Design Studies&quot; in 1979, &quot;Design Issues&quot; in 1984, and &quot;Research in Engineering Design&quot; in 1989.

== Development ==

The development of design research has led to the establishment of design as a coherent discipline of study in its own right, based on the view that design has its own things to know and its own ways of knowing them. Bruce Archer again encapsulated the view in stating his new belief that ‘there exists a designerly way of thinking and communicating that is both different from scientific and scholarly ways of thinking and communicating, and as powerful as scientific and scholarly methods of enquiry when applied to its own kinds of problems’. This view was developed further in a series of papers by Nigel Cross, collected as a book on &#x27;Designerly Ways of Knowing&#x27;. 
Significantly, Donald Schön promoted the new view within his book The Reflective Practitioner, in which he challenged the technical rationality of Simon and sought to establish ‘an epistemology of practice implicit in the artistic, intuitive processes which [design and other] practitioners bring to situations of uncertainty, instability, uniqueness and value conflict’.

Design research ‘came of age’ in the 1980s, and has continued to expand. This was helped by the development of a research base, including doctoral programmes, within many of the design schools located within new institutions that were previously art colleges, and the emergence of new areas such as interaction design. More new journals have appeared, such as &quot;The Design Journal&quot;, the&quot; Journal of Design Research&quot;, &quot;CoDesign&quot; and more recently &quot;Design Science&quot;. There has also been a major growth in conferences, with not only a continuing series by DRS, but also series such as Design Thinking, Doctoral Education in Design, Design Computing and Cognition, Design and Emotion, the European Academy, the Asian Design Conferences, etc. Design research now operates on an international scale, acknowledged in the cooperation of DRS with the Asian design research societies in the founding in 2005 of the International Association of Societies of Design Research.

<text>Moose (December 24, 1990 – June 22, 2006) was a wire-hair Jack Russell Terrier who portrayed Eddie Crane on the American television Cheers spinoff sitcom &quot;Frasier&quot;.

==Early life==
Moose was birthed on Christmas Eve, 1990, in Florida, the youngest littermate. He was the largest puppy in the litter. Like Pal, the original Lassie, the rambunctious puppy was too much for his original owner. According to an article by Lori Golden:

==Career==
Moose won the role on &quot;Frasier&quot; after only six months of training. Moose had the ability to fix Kelsey Grammer with a long hard stare; this became a running sight gag on the show. When Moose had to lick his co-stars, however, sardine oil was applied upon the actors&#x27; faces. John Mahoney once revealed liver pâté was dabbed behind the actor&#x27;s ears to make Moose nuzzle the actors.

Moose had numerous television appearances and several magazine covers to his credit. There is an official Moose calendar and an &quot;autobiography&quot;, &quot;My Life as a Dog&quot;, which was written by Brian Hargrove, husband of actor David Hyde Pierce who portrays Niles Crane in &quot;Frasier&quot;.

==Retirement==
Moose spent the last six and a half years of his life in retirement in West Los Angeles with son Enzo, their trainer Mathilde de Cagny, her husband Michael Halberg, and Jill, the dog from &quot;As Good as It Gets&quot;. He died of natural causes at home at the age of 15 (incorrectly stated as 16) on June 22, 2006.

<doc id="922168" wikidata="Q3503047" url="?curid=922168" title="Manson impact structure">
<text>The Manson impact structure is an impact structure near the site of Manson, Iowa where an asteroid or comet nucleus struck the Earth during the Cretaceous Period, approximately 74 Ma. It was one of the largest known impact events to have happened in North America. Previously it was thought to have led to the extinction of the dinosaurs until isotopic ages proved that it was too old.

== Description ==
No surface evidence exists due to comparatively recent coverage by glacial till, and the site where the impact structure lies buried is now a flat landscape. But, hidden about below the surface is a buried structure about in diameter. It lies under the southeast corner of Pocahontas County and extends under portions of three adjoining counties. That an anomalous structure underlaid the area was known from unusual water well drill cuttings in 1912 of deformed rock, &quot;crystalline clast breccia with a melt matrix&quot; as a later report described it. A research investigation was started in 1955, and it was labeled a &quot;cryptovolcanic structure&quot; (a hypothetical volcanic steam explosion). Further investigation was undertaken by Robert S. Dietz who proposed an impact origin in 1959 and by Nicholas Short in 1966 who produced evidence of shocked quartz grains which confirmed the impact origin of the structure.

In 1991 and 1992 the U.S. Geological Survey along with others including the Iowa Geological Survey conducted detailed research in part to test the possible connection of the Manson impact structure with the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event. The / isotope ratio dating of the core from the impact structure gave an age of about 74 Ma, or about 10 Ma older than the K–T boundary.

The impactor is considered to have been a stony meteorite about in diameter. The site at the time was the shore of a shallow inland sea, the Western Interior Seaway. The impact disrupted granite, gneiss, and shales of the Precambrian basement as well as sedimentary formations of Paleozoic age, Devonian through Cretaceous. Limestone layers that give the rest of Iowa hard water were instantaneously vaporized down to the basement rocks, giving Manson the anomalous soft water that it has today.

<text>Brian S. Price (born February 19, 1976) has been the Canadian coxswain of the men&#x27;s eight since 2001. He was born in Belleville, Ontario. Price began rowing on the National Team in 1998 after graduating from Seneca College with a Civil Engineering Technology diploma. The first national team crew that he made was the 1998 development lightweight eight. He made the move to the heavyweight men&#x27;s team in 1999 and competed at the Pan Am Games in Winnipeg.

Price has competed at World Championships in the Eight from 2001 to 2008, 2011 and has earned three World Championship victories (&#x27;02,&#x27;03,&#x27;07) along with a bronze medal most recently in 2011. He has doubled up in the Eight and Coxed Pair four times and medaled each time with a bronze. His Men&#x27;s Eight gold medal victories came in 2002 (Seville, Spain), 2003 (Milan, Italy) and 2007 (Munich, Germany). His four World Championship Coxed Pair Bronze medals came in 2003, 2006, 2007 &amp; 2011. He also has multiple World Cup medals to his credit, 5 gold, 1 Silver, 1 Bronze.

Price is a survivor of childhood cancer, leukemia ALL. He underwent chemotherapy and a harsh drug regime as a child which effected his thyroid, the organ that regulates growth development. His stunted height and weight made his size of 5&#x27;4&quot; tall and 121 lbs. suitable for the position of coxswain. His favorite saying is &quot;Without having had cancer, I would not have become a World and Olympic Champion.&quot;

He met his wife Robbi Stott of Belleville in September 2000 and they were married on December 11, 2004. After having lived in Ottawa after the Athens Olympics for two years, and Robbi becoming a Registered Massage Therapist, they moved back to Victoria in March 2007 so that Brian could train at the Victoria Training Centre full-time. They now reside in Orangeville, ON. Robbi has given birth to two girls, Brianna Helen on May 31, 2007, and their second daughter, Peyton Victoria on January 12, 2010.

Price is an Olympic Gold Medallist after dominating the field at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing China. He won the Men&#x27;s Eight with teammates Kevin Light, Ben Rutledge, Andrew Byrnes, Jake Wetzel, Malcolm Howard, Dominic Sieterle, Adam Kreek and Kyle Hamilton
Great Britain won the silver while USA finished with Bronze. The Canadian boat stormed out to a lead right from the start with GB and the USA unable to match their immense power.

Price decided to take two years away from rowing (2009, 2010) and enjoyed a successful career in the speaking industry. His motivational story of Cancer survival to Olympic Champion resonated with everyone from corporate audiences to elementary schools. As much as he enjoyed speaking, he was drawn back to rowing by a young and motivated group of guys on the Canadian National Team. With Mike Spracklen still at the helm of the Men&#x27;s Eight, it was the obvious choice to return to the Eight with the aim of defending gold in London 2012.

With 2011 being his first World Championships back in the boat, it proved to be successful one with improvements coming throughout the season. Canada finished 5th at the prestigious Lucerne World Cup Regatta and improved even more with a bronze medal at the 2011 World Rowing Championships in Bled Slovenia. This finish qualified them for the 2012 Olympics (top 7 qualified) and solidified them a legitimate contenders heading into the games.

He won a silver medal at the 2012 Summer Olympics in the men&#x27;s eight. His teammates included Malcolm Howard and Andrew Byrnes, with whom he won gold in 2008. The other six were Gabriel Bergen, Jeremiah Brown, Will Crothers, Douglas Csima, Robert Gibson and Conlin McCabe.

<doc id="922171" wikidata="Q16950322" url="?curid=922171" title="Combine car">
<text>A combine car in North American parlance, most often referred to simply as a combine, is a type of railroad car which combines sections for both passengers and freight.

Most often, it was used on short lines to carry passengers and their luggage, as a full car would not have been cost effective. One half (or less) of the car is built like a baggage car while the other half of the car is a regular passenger car. This type of combine is referred to as a &quot;coach-baggage&quot;. Another common type of combine in railroad use was the &quot;coach-RPO&quot;. A portion of this type of car was configured as a railway post office while the rest of the car was configured as a coach. The New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad operated a combine separated into an RPO and a smoking section. In 1893, Pullman produced a combine with a baggage area, buffet, barber shop, bathroom with tub and a smoking section featuring a fireplace.

When Amtrak took over in 1971, lightweight combines were used on most routes, particularly on trains that had used combines before Amtrak took over. As Amtrak started rehabbing their older cars to Heritage Fleet standards, the only combines which survived were the Baggage-Dorm cars. As Amtrak received the Superliner cars in all forms, including dorm cars, the only routes which required rehabbed single-level dorm cars were the East Coast routes (&quot;Crescent&quot;, &quot;Lake Shore Limited&quot;, &quot;Silver Star&quot;, etc.) due to low tunnel clearance. Because Amtrak had a surplus of single-level coaches due to the recent delivery of Amfleet coaches, baggage-coaches were unnecessary. Thus, baggage-dorm cars were the only cars that should logically be rehabbed. Rehabbed baggage-dorm cars were used on Amtrak East Coast routes from the early 1980s until 1996.

When Amtrak received its new Viewliner and Superliner II sleeping cars in 1996, some of the Heritage 10-6 sleepers were turned into crew dorms, and the dorms became unnecessary. After Amtrak received the Superliner II coaches, some of the Heritage coaches which had been replaced were turned into baggage cars. Thus, baggage-dorms became unnecessary, and all were retired. The Viewliner II orders included 10 baggage-dorms and 4 are currently in service on the Crescent route.

Although Amtrak operates many cars in its Superliner fleet that are labeled as &quot;coach-baggage&quot;, they are not often referred to as combines. Via Rail still operates a few combines in the traditional sense, which carry passengers, baggage and supplies for villages en route. They are towed by freight trains in far northern Manitoba.

<text>Answered Prayers is an unfinished novel by American author Truman Capote, published posthumously in 1986 in England and 1987 in the United States.

== History ==
The title of the book is taken from the novel&#x27;s epigraph: &quot;More tears are shed over answered prayers than unanswered ones&quot;, attributed to Saint Teresa of Avila.

According to Random House senior editor Joseph M. Fox, Capote signed the initial contract for the novel on January 5, 1966—envisioned as a contemporary American analog to Marcel Proust&#x27;s &quot;In Search of Lost Time&quot;. This agreement provided a $25,000 advance with a stipulated delivery date of January 1, 1968.

Distracted by the unprecedented success of his &quot;nonfiction novel&quot; &quot;In Cold Blood&quot; amid the gestation of the Black and White Ball (at the Plaza Hotel in November 1966), various television projects, short pieces and increasing personal demons, Capote missed his 1968 deadline. In July 1969, the superannuated 1966 contract was renegotiated, granting a &quot;substantially larger&quot; $750,000 advance in exchange for a trilogy to be delivered in January 1973. The delivery date was further delayed to January 1974 and then September 1977. A final agreement in early 1980 would have yielded Capote $1 million to have been paid only if he submitted the manuscript by March 1, 1981. This final deadline was not kept.

On &quot;The Dick Cavett Show&quot; in May 1971, Capote referred to the book as his &quot;posthumous novel&quot;, explaining, &quot;either I&#x27;m going to kill it, or it&#x27;s going to kill me&quot;.

The book is a tale of the mixing of high and low social classes, drawn from his experiences as best friend and confidant to prominent female socialites of the era and their husbands. The first chapter (&quot;Unspoiled Monsters&quot;) chronicles the &quot;picaresque&quot; exploits of P.B. Jones, a young writer (enmeshed in the process of writing a novel, &quot;Answered Prayers&quot;) and &quot;bisexual hustler&quot; who &quot;beds men and women alike if they can further his literary career&quot; in the 1940s New York literary milieu; accordingly, both Katherine Anne Porter and Tennessee Williams are depicted in a vituperative light. Jones (who later appears as the main interlocutor in &quot;La Cote Basque&quot;) is believed to be a composite of Capote, Perry Smith from &quot;In Cold Blood&quot;, and Capote&#x27;s late friend Denham Fouts. The eponymous protagonist of the comparatively obfuscatory chapter &quot;Kate McCloud&quot; (and the ostensible heroine of the novel) was inspired by Mona von Bismarck, the eldest of Capote&#x27;s society friends.

By 1975, Capote&#x27;s increasingly outrageous public behavior—fueled by alcohol, drugs and sexual indiscretion—led many to believe that he had no intention of ever publishing &quot;Answered Prayers&quot; and had essentially given up writing. Capote sold four chapters (&quot;Mojave&quot;, &quot;La Cote Basque&quot;, &quot;Unspoiled Monsters&quot;, and &quot;Kate McCloud&quot;) of the novel-in-progress to &quot;Esquire&quot; at the behest of Gordon Lish in 1975 and 1976. &quot;Mojave&quot; was published in the magazine&#x27;s June 1975 issue to little fanfare. However, with the publication of &quot;La Cote Basque&quot; in the November 1975 issue, there was an uproar of shock and anger among Capote&#x27;s friends and acquaintances, who recognized thinly veiled characters based on themselves. Both &quot;Mojave&quot; and &quot;La Cote Basque&quot; were exposés of the dysfunctional personal lives led by the author&#x27;s social benefactors, including CBS head William S. Paley, his wife Babe (then terminally ill with cancer), Gloria Vanderbilt (depicted as being insufferably vacuous), Happy Rockefeller, and Ann Woodward. The Paleys never again socialized with Capote, and they led an exodus of ostracizing friends. Subsequently, &quot;Unspoiled Monsters&quot; and &quot;Kate McCloud&quot; were published in the periodical in May 1976 and December 1976, respectively.

From a literary viewpoint the chapters received mixed reactions. Some, like Capote biographer Gerald Clarke, consider &quot;Answered Prayers&quot; to be the culmination of the factual novel form first employed by the author with &quot;In Cold Blood&quot; and a testimonial to his talent&#x27;s ability to transcend substance abuse. Norman Mailer praised Capote&#x27;s technique but questioned the seemingly frivolous plotline of escapades among the socially outmoded jet set.

==Composition==

In the introduction to his 1980 collection, &quot;Music for Chameleons&quot;, Capote detailed the writing process of the novel:
If this chronology is to be believed, Capote stopped work on &quot;Answered Prayers&quot; in September 1977 after suffering what he considered to be a &quot;nervous breakdown&quot;. After a period of consideration and reorganization, he claimed to have completed substantial revisions on the chapters published in &quot;Esquire&quot; with the exception of &quot;Mojave&quot;, a vignette situated outside of the diegetic framework of the novel that was intended to be the second chapter before Capote elected to excise it from the work; in 1980, it was republished as a standalone short story in &quot;Music for Chameleons&quot;.

However, further evidence makes Capote&#x27;s statements seem less credible. Fox corroborates Capote to a large extent and claimed to have seen all four of the &quot;Esquire&quot; chapters in 1975, but Gerald Clarke&#x27;s biography indicates that only the recently written &quot;Mojave&quot; and &quot;La Cote Basque&quot; were in any sort of publishable condition by that date. (Nevertheless, both &quot;Unspoiled Monsters&quot; and &quot;Kate McCloud&quot; were published in 1976, a period coinciding with one of the lowest ebbs in Capote&#x27;s personal life.) Capote&#x27;s legendary and almost stenographic journals, considered by a minority of friends to have been the foundation of his literary output, have never surfaced after his death, let alone in a revised form. By all accounts, he spent those years in a drug- and alcohol-induced haze.

==Theories regarding missing chapters==
Comparable in length to Capote&#x27;s earlier works of long fiction, the three chapters published in &quot;Esquire&quot; were collected by Random House in 1987 as &quot;Answered Prayers: The Unfinished Novel&quot;. An unpublished short narrative bearing the title of one of the missing chapters (&quot;Yachts and Things&quot;) was later found among Capote&#x27;s papers in the Manuscripts and Archives Division of the New York Public Library and published in the December 2012 issue of &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;, which billed it as the long-lost work. Apart from its title, however, the piece appears to be a separate work, and in 2013 it was added to a Modern Library edition of &quot;The Complete Stories of Truman Capote&quot; as a self-contained story.

Revised versions of the &quot;Esquire&quot; chapters and &quot;Yachts and Things&quot; that were purported to have existed, along with &quot;A Severe Insult to the Brain&quot; (a vignette about Jerry Zipkin, a prominent real estate heir, social escort, and friend of Nancy Reagan); &quot;And Audrey Wilder Sang&quot; (an account of &quot;the beautiful people of Hollywood and New York... and how they&#x27;re not so beautiful&quot;); and &quot;Father Flanagan&#x27;s...&quot; (the final chapter) have never been located. In the years prior to his death, Capote frequently read from these chapters to friends at dinners, but such was his gift of storytelling that few could discern whether he was actually reading from a manuscript or improvising. He arranged to sell &quot;Father Flanagan&#x27;s...&quot; to &quot;Esquire&quot; during Clay Felker&#x27;s editorship in the early 1980s for $35,000; although he claimed that he only &quot;needed to tighten a few screws,&quot; the excerpt was never submitted. Capote alleged that lover John O&#x27;Shea had absconded with &quot;A Severe Insult to the Brain&quot; in 1977 and subsequently sued for repossession, but he eventually reconciled with O&#x27;Shea and dropped the lawsuit in 1981. According to Joseph Fox, at least four of Capote&#x27;s friends (including John Knowles and Lester Persky) reportedly read or listened to Capote read selections from &quot;some of the... chapters... probably &#x27;Father Flanagan&#x27;s All-Night Nigger Queen Kosher Cafe&#x27; and &#x27;A Severe Insult to the Brain,&#x27;&quot; while Persky professed to have copied and bound a complete manuscript that subsequently vanished.

Longtime Capote confidante Joanne Carson contended that she read three &quot;very long&quot; chapters (&quot;And Audrey Wilder Sang&quot;, &quot;Yachts and Things&quot;, and &quot;Father Flanagan&#x27;s...&quot;) that completed the novel in the early 1980s. On the morning preceding his death, Capote handed a key to Carson for a safe deposit box or locker that contained the completed novel, stating that &quot;[the chapters] will be found when they want to be found.&quot; When Carson pressed Capote for a precise location, he proffered myriad locations in various locales that he frequented, including Manhattan, Palm Springs, Los Angeles and New Orleans. An exhaustive search for the manuscript after Capote&#x27;s death yielded nothing.

In his editor&#x27;s note, Fox &quot;hesitantly&quot; theorized that the chapters did exist at one juncture but were &quot;deliberately destroyed&quot; by Capote in the early 1980s. Andreas Brown likewise believes that Capote, a trenchant perfectionist, &quot;may well have destroyed the manuscripts&quot; during his intermittent periods of sobriety.

A third and less tantalizing belief held by a minority of Capote&#x27;s friends (including Andy Warhol and Capote&#x27;s life partner Jack Dunphy) was that the high-society backlash that followed the publication of &quot;La Cote Basque&quot; so traumatized Capote that he ceased all work on &quot;Answered Prayers&quot; after finishing &quot;Kate McCloud&quot; and was incapable of finishing it. In his diary, Warhol made frequent mention of drunken ramblings related to the novel by Capote, but he never was able to secure any serious plot details. He did discuss the contents of one of the chapters with Brigid Berlin, and Warhol was incensed that she did not tape the discussion.

<text>Georges Lefebvre (; 6 August 1874 – 28 August 1959) was a French historian, best known for his work on the French Revolution and peasant life. He is considered one of the pioneers of &quot;history from below&quot;. He coined the phrase the &quot;death certificate of the old order&quot; to describe the Great Fear of 1789. Among his most significant works was the 1924 book &quot;Les Paysans du Nord pendant la Révolution française&quot; (&quot;The Peasants of the North During the French Revolution&quot;), which was the result of 20 years of research into the role of the peasantry during the revolutionary period.

==Personal background==
Lefebvre was born in Lille to a family of modest means. He attended public school, obtaining his secondary and university training with the help of scholarships. Lefebvre attended the University of Lille, and it was here that he followed the &quot;special curriculum&quot;, which emphasized modern languages, mathematics, and economics instead of the classical languages. It was as a result of his schooling that Georges Lefebvre was able to teach in a series of secondary schools for more than twenty years after his graduation in 1898. After his career in teaching secondary school students, Lefebvre began teaching at the university level.

He became more and more influenced by Marxism about the time of the Second World War, especially by the Marxist idea that history should be concerned with economic structures and class relations.

He died in Paris in 1959.

==The &quot;French Revolution&quot;==

Lefebvre began writing in 1904, but it was not until 1924, at the age of fifty, that he was finally at the point in his career - no longer preoccupied with supporting his family - that he was able to finish his doctoral thesis: &quot;Les Paysans du Nord pendant la Révolution française&quot;. This work was a detailed and thorough examination of the effects of the French Revolution on the countryside. Lefebvre&#x27;s work on this thesis was &quot;based on a thorough analysis of thousands of tax rolls, notarial records, and the registers of rural municipalities, whose materials he used to trace the effects of the abolition of feudalism and ecclesiastical tithes, the consequences of property transfers, the movement of the bourgeoisie onto the countryside, and the destruction of collective rights in the peasants villages&quot;.

He often wrote from a viewpoint which he felt the peasant of the time would have held. His &quot;the Coming of the French Revolution&quot; identified four key champions: the aristocracy (which prevented monarchical reform), the bourgeoisie, the urban revolution (storming the Bastille), and the peasant revolution.

Fellow historians tend to examine the last 35 years of Lefebvre&#x27;s writings (1924–1959). This period is chosen because it is when he wrote his most influential and &quot;much more complex interpretation of the Revolution than had hitherto prevailed amongst historians&quot;. Peter Jones elaborates that Lefebvre&#x27;s take on the Revolution has three major emphases: the idea that the countryside peasantry actively participated in the Revolution, the idea that this participation was not significantly influenced by the bourgeoisie, and the idea that the peasants largely agreed on an anticapitalist way of thinking in the 1790s.

==Accomplishments==

Lefebvre&#x27;s account of the origins of the French Revolution was written in &quot;Quatre-Vingt-Neuf&quot;(meaning 89), and published in 1939 to mark the sesquicentennial of the events of 1789, but the Vichy government that took over the following year wanted no left-wing history or sympathetic understanding of the Revolution, as they drew their support from the anti-republican right. The Vichy régime suppressed the book, ordering 8,000 copies to be burned; as a result the work was virtually unknown in its native land until it was reprinted in 1970. Its reputation was already secure in the English-speaking world, however, since the English translation, &quot;The Coming of the French Revolution&quot; (1939) had established it as a clear, yet subtle, classic. It remains the definitive explanation of the Marxist interpretation of the causes of the Revolution. Crane Brinton, in The Nation, wrote of it, &quot;...simply the best introduction to the study of the French Revolution available anywhere.&quot; His seminal work, &quot;La Révolution Française&quot; (revised edition, 1951) was translated into English as two volumes: &quot;The French Revolution From Its Origins To 1793&quot; (1962-4) and &quot;The French Revolution from 1793 to 1799&quot; (1964). He also wrote a highly regarded study of &quot;Napoléon&quot; (4th edition 1953; translated in 2 volumes, 1969).

A doctoral dissertation by Lawrence Davis, entitled &quot;Georges Lefebvre: Historian and Public Intellectual, 1928-1959&quot;, as the title suggests, concentrates on the latter part of Lefebvre&#x27;s life and on the scholarly publications that made Lefebvre a noteworthy historian. Davis expands on the concept of &quot;mentalité&quot; that Lefebvre developed, arguing that this is &quot;a term that represented their collective goal of documenting the material and mental worlds of people of the past, where the social and cultural existed comfortably side by side&quot;. Throughout the work, Davis stressed the notion that Lefebvre used this concept of &quot;mentalité&quot; of the peasantry to explain the Revolution.

==Recognition==

In 1935 Georges Lefebvre became the president of the Societé des Études Robespierristes and the director of the &quot;Annales historiques de la Révolution française&quot;. In 1937 Lefebvre was named the Chair of the History of the French Revolution at the Sorbonne.

By 1914 he had already published a collection of documents, entitled &quot;Documents relatifs à l’histoire des subsistances dans le district de Bergues pendant la Révolution (1788-An V)&quot;. Lefebvre continued to engrave all that he could on the French Revolution and all that dealt with it, well into his old age and beyond his retirement from the position of chair at the Sorbonne in 1945. Georges Lefebvre died in Boulogne-Billancourt on August 28, 1959.

<text>Tele-snaps (often known as telesnaps) were off-screen photographs of British television broadcasts, taken and sold commercially by John Cura (born Alberto Giovanni Cura in Clapham, South London, England; 9 April 1902 – 21 April 1969). From 1947 until 1968, Cura ran a business selling the 250,000-plus tele-snaps he took. The photographs were snapped in half of a normal frame of 35mm film, at an exposure of 1/25th of a second. Generally around 70–80 tele-snaps were taken of each programme. They were mostly purchased by actors and directors to use as records and examples of their work before the prevalence of videocassette recorders.

For many early programmes tele-snaps are the only surviving record of their appearance. From the 1990s onwards, tele-snaps have often been used by groups of fans to recreate lost &quot;Doctor Who&quot; episodes, creating &quot;reconstructions&quot; by marrying the images to fan-recorded off-air soundtracks of the episodes.

==History==

From an early age, Cura had been interested in electronics and photography, developing a reputation among his family as a &quot;Heath Robinson inventor&quot;. In June 1946, the BBC resumed its television service following the hiatus imposed by the Second World War. Cura, recently demobilised from the RAF, combined his twin passions of photography and electronics and began to experiment with developing a camera that could take pictures from a television screen. He eventually came up with a mechanism that took half-frame 18×24 mm images on 35 mm film (i.e. the same format as in 35 mm motion picture cameras), at a speed of 1/25th of a second.

Once satisfied with his process, Cura wrote to the BBC on 11 September 1947 enclosing samples of his work and requesting permission to exploit the images commercially. Cura&#x27;s request caused considerable consternation in the BBC&#x27;s legal department who were concerned about copyright. Ultimately, the BBC concluded that a television image was not covered by existing copyright law and replied to Cura giving him permission to proceed but to &quot;only photograph the television image of individual artists who have instructed you to do so prior to their television appearance, and that you do not give or sell the photographs to anyone other than the artist in question&quot;. Cura often ignored this restriction, however, frequently sending tele-snaps to artists on spec in the hope of attracting business from them. Many of his clients were BBC programme makers who found his photographs useful records of their work.

In 1951, Cura came once again to the attention of the BBC&#x27;s lawyers when he requested that he be allowed to photograph entire BBC productions, writing that his service &quot;enables you to have a permanent pictorial record for valuable reference in years to come, of series which have a brief life of an hour or so and are then lost forever&quot;. The BBC had also been contacted by several newspapers at this time, looking for permission to use Cura&#x27;s tele-snaps—especially after it transpired that Cura had taken the only image of Oxford&#x27;s boat sinking during that year&#x27;s Boat Race between Oxford and Cambridge. The BBC made petitions to the Houses of Parliament to have the Copyright Acts overhauled to give them legal certainty regarding the issue. Although a revised Copyright Bill was enacted in 1956, it did little to curtail Cura&#x27;s activities.

Cura&#x27;s business was at its peak in the mid-fifties, his business having doubled overnight following the launch of ITV in 1955. A second television set was purchased and a second camera constructed to enable Cura to photograph both channels. Cura also enjoyed success with two best-selling books on improving television reception and correcting picture faults, which were illustrated with his tele-snaps. He also appeared on the BBC&#x27;s television panel game show &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot;. Celebrity clients of the tele-snaps service included Benny Hill and the Beverley Sisters. By 1959, Cura claimed to have taken over 250,000 tele-snaps and that sets of his tele-snaps had been &quot;presented to and graciously accepted by the Royal Family; Their Majesties the King of Denmark; the late King of Norway; Queen Juliana of the Netherlands; Ex-president Auriol of France; Earl Attlee; Sir Winston Churchill; Mr Charles Chaplin; Mrs Eleanor Roosevelt&quot; as well as a wide range of newspapers and periodicals. However, when Cura raised the prices for his service in 1964, the BBC ordered a review of the tele-snap service, which at this stage was costing them £1,300 per annum, and, with many programmes now routinely recorded on film or video, the business began to decline.

John Cura continued to take tele-snaps right up within a few months of his death in 1969 from colon cancer. His widow offered her late husband&#x27;s collection of tele-snaps to the BBC but was turned down. It is believed that they were subsequently destroyed. However, many copies of tele-snaps survive on broadcasters&#x27; production files and in the private collections of many of the artists and technicians whose work Cura photographed.

==Cultural significance==
In the early days of television, the means of making recordings of television programmes were limited and programmes were, in the main, transmitted live. This began to change as techniques for recording programmes onto film (telerecording) and, later, videotape were developed in the 1950s. Even after the technology for recording programmes had become the norm, it was a common practice, due to a combination of the costs of storage and restrictions on broadcasting repeats, for UK broadcasters to wipe programmes after transmission. As a result, John Cura&#x27;s tele-snaps are often the only surviving record of many lost programmes from the early years of television.

Tele-snaps have been used to reconstruct lost television shows by marrying up the tele-snaps with audio recordings of missing shows to create a slide-show backed by the programme&#x27;s soundtrack. Most notably, this technique has been employed, on an amateur, not-for-profit basis, by some enthusiasts of the British science fiction series &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, which has nearly a hundred missing episodes. Some professional reconstructions using tele-snaps have also been created, including:
* A brief (15-minute) reconstruction of episodes two and three of the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; serial &quot;The Ice Warriors&quot; for its VHS videotape release in 1998.
* A full reconstruction of the final episode of the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; serial &quot;The Tenth Planet&quot; for its VHS videotape release in 2000.
* A full reconstruction of the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; serial &quot;The Power of the Daleks&quot; for the MP3 CD release of that story in 2005. This reconstruction was later included in the DVD release of an animated version of the serial in 2016.
*Similar full reconstructions of all four episodes of &quot;The Macra Terror&quot;, episodes 2,4,5 and 6 of &quot;The Faceless Ones&quot;, all six episodes of &quot;Fury from the Deep&quot;, episode 3 of &quot;The Web of Fear&quot;, all six episodes of &quot;The Power of the Daleks&quot; and episodes 1 &amp; 3-7 of &quot;The Evil of the Daleks&quot; (with the surviving parts represented by the original episodes and surviving footage) have also been included in the subsequent DVD releases of the animated versions.
* A condensed (30-minute) reconstruction of the seven-part &quot;Doctor Who&quot; serial &quot;Marco Polo&quot; for the DVD release, &quot;The Beginning&quot;, in 2006.
* A condensed reconstruction of the missing episodes of the 1961 science fiction serial &quot;A for Andromeda&quot; for its DVD release in 2006. Since at the time of release no soundtrack for the missing episodes of this serial exists, this reconstruction is backed by music used in the serial with on-screen captions employed to narrate the story. (the full soundtrack of the partially-existing episode 7 was subsequently recovered).
* Narrated reconstructions of episodes from the first season of &quot;The Avengers&quot; have been included as extras on the Region 2 DVDs of the series released by Optimum.

<text>The Pontiac LeMans is a model name applied to automobiles marketed by Pontiac. The name came from the French city of Le Mans, the site of the 24 Hours of Le Mans, the world&#x27;s oldest active sports car endurance race that began in 1923. Originally a trim upgrade package based on the Tempest, the LeMans became a separate model in 1963.

In its first five generations spanning from 1961 until 1981 (1983 in Canada), the LeMans was a domestic RWD car; the first generation was a compact, with Gens 2-5 intermediates. From 1988 through 1993 the LeMans name was resurrected for a sixth generation, a FWD subcompact badge-engineered version of the Daewoo LeMans manufactured by Daewoo in South Korea.

Pontiac produced some notable GT/performance versions in the RWD models. The 1st generation not only featured a front-engine/rear-transaxle that very nearly resulted in an ideal 50/50 weight distribution, but also included four-wheel independent suspension for nimble handling, and could be ordered with an optional Buick 215 aluminum V8 engine.
The Pontiac GTO is credited with popularizing the muscle car market segment of the 1960s, and by many as the first muscle car. The 1970 model year introduced the LeMans GT-37 package. The 1973-75 Grand Am and 1977 Can Am combined luxury with performance features to emulate European coupes, focusing on balancing handling with power. 

==First generation (1961–1963)==

===1961===
Toward the end of the 1961 model year, the LeMans was introduced as the top trim package of the compact-sized Pontiac Tempest on GM&#x27;s new Y body platform. The Tempest LeMans featured sportier and more luxurious features and standard equipment than the Tempest, including different badging and bucket seats. The trim option was available only on the two-door sedan (pillared coupe) body style.

===1962===
For the 1962 model year, the LeMans remained a trim package that was now also available in the convertible body style, as well as with the inline-four cylinder, 4-barrel carbureted engine. There was no pillarless hardtop body style available in either the Tempest or LeMans.

===1963===
For 1963, the LeMans name was still used only on two-door coupes and convertibles but now was designated as a separate model in the Pontiac compact car lineup. This was available for one year. The four-cylinder was standard and the V8 engine was optional.


==Second generation (1964–1967)==
===1964===

The Tempest line was changed to an intermediate-sized car on the new GM A platform for the 1964 model year. The LeMans was its own model, as in 1963, and included carpeted lower door panels, a deluxe steering wheel, courtesy lighting, and full wheel covers. For the 1964 model year, a two-door hardtop was added. A new inline six-cylinder engine was introduced, 

Shortly after the start of the 1964 model year, the LeMans became available with a new performance package designated as the GTO, or &#x27;Gran Turismo Omologato.&#x27; The GTO option included a V8 from the full-sized Pontiac Catalina that produces with a four-barrel carburetor or in the Tri-Power (three Rochester 2GC two-barrel carburetors) version.

===1965===

Pontiac&#x27;s 1965 A-body intermediates included Tempest, Tempest Custom, Lemans, and GTO trim. The entire line was restyled, adding to the overall length while retaining the same wheelbase and interior dimensions. The new model had Pontiac&#x27;s characteristic vertically stacked quad headlights. Overall weight was increased by about . The dashboard design was changed, and a breakerless transistor ignition was a new option. A 326 cubic inch High Output engine was available with 4-barrel carburation for Tempest and Lemans. The 326 HO produces . Ratings for the GTO version were increased to in the four-barrel version and with the Tri-Power option. The LeMans line was expanded to include a four-door sedan for the 1965 model year.

===1966===

The pillared 4-door sedan was replaced by a four-door hardtop body style for the 1966 model year.
The GTO became a separate model of its own for the 1966 model year, though retaining the same basic body as the Tempest and LeMans models. For 1966, all GM and Pontiac intermediates featured new styling featuring tunnel back rooflines on two-door hardtops and pillared coupes. While the GTO continued as a big-engined muscle car, the Tempest and LeMans models got a new SOHC straight-six as the base engine. This engine, as well as the early Tempest with the transaxle in the rear, were ideas of Pontiac&#x27;s Chief Engineer John DeLorean, who became Pontiac&#x27;s general manager at the end of the 1965 model year. This engine was available in a one-barrel carbureted, version as standard equipment on all Pontiac intermediates except GTOs. Optional on all Tempest and LeMans models except station wagons was a Sprint package that included a four-barrel version of the I6 that also included a higher compression ratio and hotter cam, that was rated at , along with an &quot;all-syncro&quot; floor-mounted three-speed transmission with Hurst shifter, suspension kit, and body striping. Optional were a two-barrel V8 rated at and a four-barrel 326 HO V8 that included higher compression ratio and dual exhausts.

===1967===

For 1967, peak power of the Sprint 4-bbl OHC six-cylinder increased to .

==Third generation (1968–1972)==
The four-door Safari station wagon became available for the 1968 model year in the Tempest line. A new engine replaced the 326. This new engine was based on all existing Pontiac engine architecture and used the 389, 400, and 326 engines&#x27; crank at 3.75&quot; stroke, and expanding the 326&#x27;s 3.72&quot; bore to 3.875&quot; to give 353.8 cubic inches. It was marketed by Pontiac as a 350. For 1968, the 350 was available in two versions: with 2-bbl carburetor at 9.2:1 compression and with 4-bbl at 10.5:1.

The OHC six-cylinder was increased from its original 230 to 250 cubic inches by lengthening the stroke. Power in base form with single barrel carburetor increased by 10 to 175 hp, but peak power for the Sprint four-barrel version remained unchanged at 215 hp.

===1969===

For the 1969 model year, the 350 V8 engine came as 2-barrel and an optional 4-barrel version. The ten horsepower increase over 1968&#x27;s engines was due to a different cam and the use of the #48 big valve heads, the same head used on the Ram Air 3 400-cubic inch engine and the 428-HO engine at . The 1969 model year would be the last high-performance version of the Pontiac 350. Also in its final year, the power rating of the Sprint 250 cu in OHC six increased from to with manual transmissions but remained at 215 hp with automatic transmission.

The Sprint-optioned Tempest and LeMans models were not popular choices for performance enthusiasts during their four year run, being outsold by the bigger-engined GTO. The Sprint option and SOHC six-cylinder engine were discontinued after 1969, and replaced with a Chevrolet-built OHV six-cylinder engine, becoming the base engine from 1970 until 1976 in most Pontiac intermediates.

On the exterior, vent windows were eliminated on two-door hardtops and convertibles, although they remained on two-door pillared coupes and four-doors.
===1970===

For 1970, Pontiac’s intermediate lineup was reshuffled to include the Tempest, Lemans, Lemans Sport, GTO and GTO Judge series. The Le Mans nameplate was downgraded to replace the sub-series previously known as the Tempest Custom, while the previous top Le Mans series was renamed the Le Mans Sport in the same three body styles as earlier, including a four-door hardtop sedan, two-door hardtop coupe and convertible. New for this year were Firebird-inspired front bumpers, wrap-around taillights, and crease-style body lines. Replacing the Pontiac-built OHC six-cylinder as the base engine for Tempest, LeMans, and LeMans Sport was Chevrolet&#x27;s 250 cubic-inch straight-six engine. V8 offerings included 350 and 400-cid options with 2-barrel carburation and a 400-cid 4-barrel carbureted engine with dual exhausts. The four-barrel 350 HO was discontinued.

Pontiac wanted to have a car that was less expensive than its Chevrolet counterpart, so in February 1970, Pontiac introduced the T-37 Hardtop Coupe, replacing the Tempest nameplate for the two-door pillared coupe. The T-37 was initially described as &quot;General Motors&#x27; lowest-priced hardtop,&quot; but was undercut by a base Chevrolet Chevelle hardtop coupe introduced a few weeks later. The T-37 Coupe was followed by the introduction of a new option to the T-37, the GT-37 package. The GT-37 represented the &quot;stripper&quot; muscle car package. In addition to the three V8 engines, GT-37 extras included Rally II wheels sans trim rings, white letter tires, chrome-tipped dual exhaust, vinyl accents stripes, 3-speed floor shift transmission, sport mirrors, hood locking pins, and &quot;GT-37&quot; badging.

===1971===

For the 1971 model year, Pontiac dropped the Tempest name altogether and introduced its intermediate lineup as T-37, Lemans GT-37, Lemans, and Lemans Sport The GTO and GTO Judge were a separate line. Two-door coupes and four-door sedans were available with T-37, Lemans, and Lemans Sport. The 2-door Hardtop was available across the series, while the convertible model was limited to Lemans Sport and the GTO line. The GT-37 returned as a package to T-37 models and was marketed as &quot;The GTO for Kids under 30.&quot; The GT-37 received the same feature package as the previous year with the exception of new eyebrow-type side striping similar to that of the GTO Judge model. In mid-March 1971, a second design change for the GT-37 switched the striping to a reflective sword-style stripe sometimes referred to as the 1971 ½ GT-37. 1971 also afforded the customer the opportunity to choose any of Pontiac&#x27;s optional V8s such as 350, 400, or 455 cubic inch models, including the 455 High Output (HO) engine. The 455 had only been offered on the GTOs in 1970 and came in a four-barrel version or the High Output version. All 1971 engines were detuned with lower compression ratios to run on lower-octane regular leaded, low-lead, or unleaded gasoline. The brakes were 9.5-inch drums.
===1972===
For 1972, all Pontiac intermediates were now Le Mans models, and the low-priced T-37 line was replaced by a base Le Mans pillared coupe. The top-line intermediate was the Luxury Le Mans, available in hardtop sedan and coupe models, featuring upgraded interiors compared to regular Le Mans models. The Le Mans Sport was available as a two-door hardtop or convertible with Strato bucket seats and interiors from the Luxury Le Mans. The GTO was changed from a separate series back to an option package on Le Mans and Le Mans Sport coupes. Replacing the previous GT-37 option package for 1972 was the new &quot;Le Mans GT&quot; option, available on Le Mans pillared and hardtop coupes with any V8 ranging from the 350 two-barrel to the 455 HO four-barrel, and also included the same appearance and handling items carried over from the GT-37.


==Fourth generation (1973–1977)==
From 1973 until 1977, the Le Mans and other GM intermediates were much larger in size than previous models due to evolutionary changes that resulted in larger cars year after year and federally mandated 5 mph crash bumpers that added weight and length. During this period, Pontiac&#x27;s intermediate lineup included the base Le Mans, Le Mans Sport Coupe, GTO (1973 only), Luxury Le Mans (became the Grand Le Mans in 1975), the Euro-styled Grand Am from 1973 through 1975, and on the 1977 Can Am. Body styles were all based on GM&#x27;s Colonnade design for both sedans and coupes (no convertibles or hardtops offered after 1972) that included center pillars for improved rollover safety standards but eliminated true hardtop design, along with frameless windows similar to a hardtop. Two-door coupes featured triangular &quot;fixed&quot; rear side windows that did not open, which were covered with louvers on the Le Mans, LeMans Sport Coupe, GTO sport coupes, and the new Grand Am.

===1973===
The 1973 Le Mans, along with all other GM intermediates, was all new, but retained the same wheelbase lengths of 112 inches for two-door coupes, and 116 inches for four-door sedans and station wagons. All models featured the federally mandated 5-mile-per-hour front bumpers along with single headlights. Handling capabilities were greatly improved on all models due to new front-suspension components shared with the F-body Pontiac Firebird and Chevrolet Camaro, improved rear-coil suspension, and bias-belted tires (except Grand Am versions, which included radial tires).
Engine offerings were carried over from 1972 with revisions to meet the 1973 emission requirements. Standard on base Le Mans sedans and coupes was Chevrolet&#x27;s 250-cubic-inch inline six-cylinder engine, while the Le Mans Sport Coupe, Luxury Le Mans sedans and coupes, and all Safari wagons got Pontiac&#x27;s 350-cubic-inch V8 with two-barrel carburetor rated at standard (optional on base Le Mans models). Optionally available on Le Mans, Le Mans Sport, and Luxury Le Mans was a 400-cubic-inch V8 with two-barrel carburator and , a 400 four-barrel (standard with the GTO option), and a 455 four-barrel were optional on all models. Planned and listed as an option for the 1973 GTO but never materialized was a 455 Super Duty V8 rated at for which introduction was delayed by Pontiac management due to emission issues until the spring of 1973 and then became available only in the smaller Firebird Formula and Trans Am pony cars.

A three-speed automatic transmission was standard on Le Mans and Luxury Le Mans models while the GTO came with a floor-mounted three-speed with Hurst shifter. Available at extra cost was the three-speed Turbo Hydra-matic with all engines, while a four-speed manual with Hurst shifter was available with the 400.

===1974===

Changes for the 1974 Le Mans included new split grilles with horizontal bars on base Le Mans and Le Mans Sport models, while Luxury Le Mans models got chromed vertical bar split grilles. Model offerings in each series were the same as 1973, except for the addition of a new Luxury Le Mans Safari wagon and the transfer of the GTO series from the intermediate line to the compact Pontiac Ventura series. The federally mandated 5-mph bumpers matched the stronger front bumpers of the previous year giving a less curvaceous rear-end treatment with vertical taillights and license plate/fuel filler moved above the bumper. Base Le Mans coupes retained the fixed full triangular rear side windows while Luxury Le Mans coupes got a smaller vertical opera window similar to the Grand Prix along with an optional Landau rear quarter vinyl roof. Le Mans Sport Coupes were now available with two rear side window treatments - the louvered triangular version carried over or the opera window with Landau vinyl roof from the Luxury Le Mans.

All engines were carried over from 1973 including the 250 inline-six, and V8s including the 350 two-barrel, 400 two- and four-barrel, and 455 four-barrel. New to the options list for 1974 was a 350 four-barrel. The same three- and four-speed manual transmissions were carried over for 1974 along with the three-speed Turbo Hydra-Matic. New to the options list for 1974 on all models were GM-specification radial-ply tires manufactured by GM&#x27;s usual tire suppliers that included revised suspension tuning.

===1975===
The 1975 Le Mans received mostly trim changes including new crosshatch grilles on base and Sport models, and a distinctive vertical bar grille with more chrome on the Grand Le Mans (renamed from Luxury Le Mans) series cars and only revised nameplates and taillight lenses in the rear. Interiors were revised on top Grand Le Mans cars to include the distinctive wrap-around dashboard from the Grand Prix and Grand Am models with simulated African Crossfire Mahogany trim, a notchback bench seat with armrest in sedans and wagons, or a no-cost choice of the notchback bench or Strato bucket seats in coupes. Base Le Mans and Sport Coupe models carried over trim only slightly revised from 1974 including a revised Custom Cushioned steering wheel.

Pontiac&#x27;s Maximum Mileage System consisted of GM&#x27;s new catalytic converter that reduced emissions while improving drivability and fuel economy, a High Energy electronic ignition, and lengthened routine maintenance intervals. Radial tires were standard on all models and a &quot;Radial Tuned Suspension&quot; option was available that included upgraded radial tires along with front and rear sway bars.

Engines were revised for 1975 to meet that year&#x27;s emission requirements and mated to the catalytic converter, which spelled the end of true dual exhausts. The 250 cubic-inch Chevy inline-six was standard on base Le Mans coupes and sedans while the 350 two-barrel V8 was optional and standard on the Le Mans Sport Coupe, and Grand Le Mans sedans and coupes, and optional engines on all of those models including a 350 four-barrel and a 400 two-barrel. Le Mans and Grand Le Mans Safari wagons came standard with a 400 four-barrel engine that was optional on other models. The 455 V8 was discontinued for all LeMans models for 1975, but was still available in the Grand Am. Transmission offerings included a three-speed manual standard with the six-cylinder and 350 two-barrel V8, with the three-speed Turbo Hydra-matic optional with those engines, a &quot;mandatory&quot; option with all other engines in sedans and coupes, and standard on the Safari wagons. The Hurst-shifted four-speed manual was no longer offered.

===1976===

For 1976, the Le Mans and Grand Le Mans were the only Pontiac intermediate offerings with the discontinuation of the Grand Am series. All models received new rectangular headlights with distinct grilles unique to the base and Le Mans Sport and another one for the Grand Le Mans. The Grand Le Mans had the instrument panel of the 1973-75 Gran Am, while the Le Mans and Le Mans Sport continued with the regular dash. The 1973-75 Luxury Le Mans had the regular Le Mans instrument panel.

The Chevy-built 250 straight-six was now standard on all Le Mans and Grand Le Mans sedans and coupes along with the Le Mans Sport Coupe with V8 options including a new &quot;Oldsmobile-built&quot; 260 V8 and Pontiac V8s of 350 and 400 cubic inches with two- or four-barrel carburetion (400 four-barrel still standard on all Safari wagons), along with the return of the 455 four-barrel V8 after a one-year absence. The three-speed manual transmission was standard with the Chevy six with Turbo Hydra-matic optional, the latter now the only transmission offered with all V8s except the small 260 which could be ordered with a five-speed manual in the Le Mans Sport Coupe.

Also new for 1976 was an &quot;Enforcer&quot; police package on Le Mans sedans with either the 400 or 455 V8s that included Turbo Hydra-matic transmission, variable-ratio power steering, heavy-duty power front disc brakes, and suspension tuning.

===1977===
The 1977 model year was the last for the Le Mans and Grand Le Mans built off the 1973-vintage Colonnade body. Appearance changes were limited to revised grilles and taillight lenses. Engine offerings were revised with Buick&#x27;s 231 cubic-inch V6 replacing the Chevy inline-six as the base power plant in sedans and coupes. The base V8 (standard on Safari wagons and optional on other models) was Pontiac&#x27;s new 301 cubic-inch engine based on the same V8 engine block as other Pontiac V8s but utilized many lightweight components. Optional V8s were pared down to Pontiac-built 350 and 400 four-barrel powerplants. The three-speed manual was the standard transmission on V6 models, while the Turbo Hydra-matic was optional and the only transmission available with the V8 engines. Those drivetrain offerings were available in 49 states. In California, Pontiac V8s were not offered for 1977 due to the inability to meet that state&#x27;s more stringent regulations. For California, the Buick V6 was standard on most models with the available V8 engines were Oldsmobile&#x27;s 350 and 403 four-barrel engines. Turbo Hydra-Matic was the only transmission offered in California.

A sporty-performance model based on the Le Mans Sport Coupe called the Pontiac Can Am was a one-year-only offering for 1977. The Can Am came standard with the 400 four-barrel V8 in 49 states or the Olds 403 four-barrel in California, along with Turbo Hydra-matic transmission, a Grand Prix instrument panel and console, Strato bucket seats, and a rear spoiler. It was partially intended as a replacement for the 1973-75 Grand Am, whose departure had caused A-body sales to drop significantly, while these Pontiac models had been the weakest sellers of the line with a high percentage of low-profit fleet sales.

For the final year of the Colonnade Le Mans models, they were joined by newly downsized B-body Catalina and Bonneville full-sized cars, which weighed a few pounds less than the &quot;intermediates&quot; and rode on the same 116-inch wheelbase length as the Le Mans sedans and Safari wagons and also had similar dimensions as far as length and width were concerned. The intermediates would have to wait one more year for downsizing, and although the new B-bodies made them redundant, it was still considered necessary to sell both as a hedge in case the B-body cars proved to be troublesome. In addition, many customers still preferred the Colonnade intermediates to the B-bodies and they continued to sell well for their final year, mostly thanks to the coupe models.

==Fifth generation (1978–1981)==
In 1978, the Le Mans and other GM mid-sized cars were considerably downsized and lost some 600-800 lb. Pontiac&#x27;s engines were also downsized, with the standard engine being the Buick 3.8 L 231 ci V6, Pontiac 265 ci V8, or optional Pontiac 4.9 L 301 ci V8 for 1978, (a Chevy 305 ci V8 in California). 1978 also saw Pontiac&#x27;s 350 ci &amp; 400 ci engine production shut down after many years of service as its hallmark V8s. A limited production run of 400ci engines was made, but were only available in 1978 and 1979 Trans Ams equipped with the four-speed manual transmission. Chevrolet&#x27;s 350 V8 was available in 1979 LeMans Safaris (station wagon) only.

From 1978 through 1980, Pontiac&#x27;s mid-sized lineup included the base Le Mans, Grand Le Mans, and a revived Grand Am; all available as a Coupe, Sedan, or Wagon. In 1980, the Grand Am was only offered only as a coupe, and the &quot;Grand Am&quot; nameplate was again discontinued until 1985, when it was used on Pontiac&#x27;s new compact car — a form the Grand Am would take for the next two decades.


The final year for the mid-sized Le Mans was 1981, with sedans featuring a new formal roofline shared with their divisional counterparts. Only base and Grand Le Mans models were offered initially, joined mid-year by a new LJ trim level positioned between the base and Grand models. The car was given a new Firebird-esque slanted nose which made the 2-door coupe popular in NASCAR, especially as a superspeedway race car in 1981, which was the first year these cars were used in the series. A Le Mans driven by Cale Yarborough won the 1983 Daytona 500, and one driven by Tim Richmond at the 1983 Pocono 500. Engine offerings by this time included Buick&#x27;s 231 CID V6, Pontiac&#x27;s 4.3 L 265 CID V8, Pontiac&#x27;s 301 CID V8, and Chevrolet&#x27;s 305 CID V8 (for California only).

=== Discontinuation ===
For the 1982 model year, General Motors revised its mid-size model lines, with particular attention focused on the Pontiac brand. In addition to the discontinuation of the LeMans, additional changes were made to reduce model overlap. As part of the 1982 introduction of the front-wheel drive A platform, the Pontiac 6000 served as the direct successor for the LeMans sedan and station wagon. Though introduced as a premium model over the LeMans, the Grand Prix coupe continued in production (on the re-designated G platform), accommodating the withdrawal of the LeMans coupe.

The Grand LeMans itself was not directly replaced for 1982, though its withdrawal was accommodated through a revision to both the G platform and the full-size B platform. Rather than undergo an expensive redesign to downsize the vehicle, Pontiac moved the Bonneville nameplate from its full-size line to the G-body four-door sedan. Sharing the newly-introduced notchback body (for 1981) of the four-door Buick Regal, Oldsmobile Cutlass, and Chevrolet Malibu, the Bonneville was slotted above the 6000 in the Pontiac model line, receiving many of the styling elements of its B-body predecessor. In Canada, Pontiac continued to use the Grand LeMans name for the G-body Bonneville through the 1983 model year. As part of the model revision, the previous Catalina/Bonneville full-size line was replaced by the Pontiac Parisienne (the nameplate used for the Bonneville by GM Canada), adopting a minor styling revision.


==Sixth generation (1988–1993)==

For the 1988 model year, Pontiac revived the LeMans nameplate in North America, replacing the Pontiac 1000 as the smallest Pontiac model line. It was an early introduction for the model year, with sales beginning in June 1987. Marking the switch of the subcompact T-body to front-wheel drive in North America, the LeMans was a captive import of the Daewoo LeMans from South Korea, offered in three-door hatchback (called the &quot;Aerocoupe&quot;) and four-door sedan body styles (a five-door hatchback was also offered in New Zealand). The joint venture with Daewoo, in which the two companies built a new factory expressly to assemble the new T-car, had been announced in January 1984 but was delayed due to a period of political turmoil.

The throttle body injected 1.6-liter engine producing at 5,600 rpm was also an Opel design, built in South Korea. The introductory lineup all had this engine and consisted of the Value Leader (&quot;VL&quot;, only as a three-door Aerocoupe), the standard LeMans (Sedan or Aerocoupe), and the SE (Sedan only) on top. A four-speed manual was standard equipment, with a five-speed version (standard on the SE) and a three-speed automatic optionally available. The LeMans was also sold in Canada through General Motors&#x27; Passport International Division as the &quot;Passport Optima.&quot;

In February 1988, a new model was released, going on sale the following month: the new sportier Pontiac LeMans GSE Aerocoupe, positioned similarly to the Opel Kadett GSi, was equipped with an Australian-built 2.0 L four-cylinder engine also used in the Pontiac Sunbird. Unlike the Kadett GSi, however, the GSE only had throttle body injection and its maximum power was at 4,800 rpm. The GSE was available in red, white, or silver with 14 inch alloy wheels, fog lights, and a rear spoiler. The GSE also received the Recaro-style seats of the Kadett GSi. The five-speed manual transmission used with the larger engine was an Opel design, built in Japan by Isuzu. This version was sold in Canada as the Passport Optima GSi. Along with the introduction of the GSE, the Pontiac LeMans SE sedan now featured the GSE&#x27;s 2.0 L four-cylinder engine while the earlier base model was renamed LE; the LE received the five-speed manual as standard equipment, leaving the four-speed for the VL only. The 2.0 L SE Sedan was dropped after the 1989 model year.

The GSE seemed good on paper, but it cost more than the Honda Civic Si and more than a Sunbird with the same engine, while the LeMans&#x27; reputation for troubled quality also did it no favors. The less-than-peppy engine combined with low-geared steering and a vague shift linkage meant that its performance did not match the sporty exterior; it had better gas mileage than many of its competitors but that did not help create a youthful image. For 1990, Pontiac added quicker steering on the GSE but the model did not return for 1991. This left the Base model (3-door only) and the LE (both body styles).

For the 1992 model year the LeMans received some very minor changes including amber turn signals at the rear and a new color (Bright Yellow). The lineup was renamed SE &quot;Value Leader&quot; Aerocoupe, with the better-equipped version called SE (Aerocoupe/Sedan). Model year sales dropped to under 20,000 cars, a far cry from the planned 90,000 per year. For 1993 the LeMans received a facelift, with a reworked front, new side moldings, and superficially changed taillights. The mechanical parts, however, remained mostly as they had been in 1987. This version was called the Asüna SE/GT in the Canadian market, where it replaced the Passport Optima. The SE was available as a three-door hatchback or four-door sedan, while the sporty and better-equipped GT only came as a hatchback. The Asüna SE and GT were only available for the 1993 model year; in 1994, the Asüna brand was discontinued altogether. In North America, poor build quality tarnished sales as well as the relationship between the companies. Daewoo&#x27;s joint venture with General Motors ended in 1992, and the Pontiac LeMans (and Asüna SE/GT) were discontinued after the 1993 model year with no replacement, ending the final use of the LeMans nameplate.

In 1994, Daewoo updated the LeMans/Racer and renamed it the Cielo; the model line continued to be built in numerous countries until 2016. In North America, Pontiac left the subcompact segment until 2005, when they introduced a rebadged Chevrolet Aveo four-door in Canada as the Pontiac Wave. This was replaced by the Pontiac G3 hatchback for 2009; this was briefly marketed in the United States as well. In 2010 (the final year of Pontiac), the G3 was available only in Canada.

===New Zealand===
It was also sold in New Zealand as the Pontiac LeMans from 1989, becoming the first Pontiac badged car to be sold on the NZ market since the Canadian-sourced Pontiac Laurentian of the 1960s. In addition to the body styles available in North America, New Zealand also received the five-door hatchback.

<text>Bad Robot is an American film and television production company founded on May 27, 1999, and led by Katie McGrath and J.J. Abrams as Co-CEO. Under its Bad Robot Productions division, the company is responsible for the television series &quot;Alias&quot;, &quot;Lost&quot;, &quot;Fringe&quot;, &quot;Person of Interest&quot;, &quot;Revolution,&quot; and &quot;Westworld&quot; alongside the feature-length films &quot;Cloverfield&quot;, &quot;Star Trek&quot;, &quot;Super 8&quot;, &quot;Star Trek Into Darkness&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Star Wars Episodes VII&quot; and &quot;IX&quot;, &quot;10 Cloverfield Lane&quot;, &quot;Star Trek Beyond&quot;, &quot;The Cloverfield Paradox&quot;, &quot;,&quot; and &quot;Overlord&quot;.

==History==

Bad Robot was originally based at Touchstone Television, but was moved by J.J. Abrams to Paramount Pictures and Warner Bros. Television, after his contract with ABC expired in 2006. Bad Robot produced &quot;Lost&quot; in association with ABC Studios, formerly Touchstone Television. The two companies jointly produced &quot;Six Degrees&quot; and &quot;What About Brian&quot;. The deal was first recommended and presented in 1999 as part of a presentation deal, with J.J. Abrams being contracted to Disney. In 2004, Thom Sherman joined Bad Robot Television as president of the studio. The company had developed presentation pitches for ABC and The WB, none of them would eventually got to series.

Abrams is Chairman and Co-Chief executive officer of Bad Robot, and Katie McGrath serves as the Company&#x27;s Co-Chief executive officer. In June 2017, Bad Robot announced that Brian Weinstein would become President and Chief Operating Officer, overseeing daily operations and spearhead the company&#x27;s growth strategy in its existing businesses, while developing new areas of expansion across the entire Bad Robot platform and pursuing alternative financing options. In May 2015, Ben Stephenson left the BBC where he had been head of drama to helm Bad Robot Television. Lindsey Weber leads Bad Robot&#x27;s feature film division.

The production logo has appeared since 2001, featuring a red rectangular headed robot running through a meadow silhouetted until it appears suddenly in front of the camera, followed by voices provided by two of Abrams&#x27;s children, Henry and Gracie Abrams, saying &quot;Bad robot!&quot; Although some fans believe that the name comes from a line in the animated film &quot;The Iron Giant&quot;, Abrams told &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; that it simply came to him during a writers&#x27; meeting.
In February 2013, it was announced that Bad Robot would be partnering with the Valve Corporation to produce possibly a &quot;Half-Life&quot; or &quot;Portal&quot; film in the distant future. In August 2015, Valve released a new beta game mode to &quot;Team Fortress 2&quot;, &quot;PASS Time&quot;, which Bad Robot worked on. On July 7, 2016, the &quot;PASS Time&quot; game mode became official. In August 2013, Bad Robot released a trailer on YouTube entitled &quot;Stranger&quot;, rumoured to be Abrams&#x27; next film or television project, perhaps even a &quot;Lost&quot; spin-off, but it was finally explained to be promoting &quot;S.&quot;, Abrams and Doug Dorst&#x27;s new novel, as a new trailer for &quot;S.&quot; was released in the following month. In February 2017, it was announced Julius Avery is attached to direct a Paramount coproduction, the World War II zombie film &quot;Overlord&quot;, from screenwriter Billy Ray.

Bad Robot Productions is currently based in Santa Monica, California, in a building which is incorrectly labeled on purpose as the home of the fictional &quot;National Typewriter Company&quot; because Abrams &quot;likes typewriters — and misdirection.&quot;

In June 2018, the company announced a spin-off venture formed with the Chinese video game publisher Tencent to launch Bad Robot Games for the development of video games on mobile, computer and consoles, with Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment as a minority investor. Bad Robot Games will develop and publish new and existing IPs including titles related to Abrams&#x27; works and other Bad Robot Production content, with Tencent holding the rights for distribution in China. 

The division was originally helmed by Dave Baronoff, who previously worked on the &quot;Cloverfield&quot; franchise and was developing &quot;Spyjinx&quot; as a joint project between Bad Robot Productions and Epic Games (also partially owned by Tencent), while Tim Keenan, who helped develop &quot;Duskers&quot;, served as the creative director.

In 2020, Anna Sweet was brought on as the CEO of Bad Robot Games. Mike Booth also joined in December 2020, managing the company&#x27;s newly created in-house development studio. By February 2022, he had taken on the role of chief creative officer.

In 2006, Bad Robot teamed up with Paramount Pictures and Warner Bros. Television for a $60 million development deal that lasted through 2018.

In late 2018, it was announced that Bad Robot was leaving Paramount and seeking a new overall deal. In January 2019, it was announced that Universal, Disney, and Warner Bros. were the top three studios battling it out for what could be a record breaking overall deal including theme parks, music labels, TV, merchandising, and streaming services as Bad Robot plans on ramping up production significantly in the coming years. It was also announced that Bad Robot would be co-producing a remake of the British series &quot;The Wrong Mans&quot; for American network Showtime along with BBC Studios, but Showtime later cancelled the project.

Bad Robot launched a subsidiary record label called Loud Robot in late 2018, in partnership with Capitol Music Group. Loud Robot is headed by co-general managers McKee Floyd and Nicky Berger along with Charles Scott, who currently heads Bad Robot&#x27;s music division and has been the leading music supervisor for the company&#x27;s films. Artists signed to the label include Cleveland-born rapper Nnena, neo soul singer/songwriter UMI, Nashville, Tennessee-based alternative rock artist Chaz Cardigan, and London-based rhythm and blues artist DWY.

On September 12, 2019, Bad Robot officially announced a new five-year overall deal with WarnerMedia. According to &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot;, WarnerMedia agreed to pay Bad Robot at least $250 million (plus various financial incentives) to produce feature films, television shows, video games, and digital content.

On May 25, 2021, Abrams announced that a &quot;Portal&quot; film adaptation, which has been in development since 2013, was still in production and a script has been written for the film. In November 2021, the company launched its podcast division with a multi-year first-look deal at Spotify.

On April 25, 2022, it was announced that Bad Robot will team up with Mattel Films and Warner Bros. Pictures to produce a live-action &quot;Hot Wheels&quot; film based on the toy line of the same name. Most recently, in December 2024, the company had extended its deal with Warner Bros. Pictures.

<text>The Fiat Coupé (Type 175), officially also known as Coupé Fiat, is a car that was manufactured by Fiat between 1993 and 2000. The two-door, four-seater coupé was introduced at the Bologna Motor Show in December 1993 and features an exterior design by Chris Bangle at Centro Stile Fiat and an interior designed by Pininfarina.

==History==
The Fiat Coupé made media headlines in auto magazines during 1992, after several spy shots were taken revealing the car on test. Fiat had decided to produce a new coupé based upon the old Tipo platform when the Pininfarina factory was suddenly dormant after the Cadillac Allanté project failed around 1990. Two designs were put forward, with Fiat&#x27;s in-house Centro Stile team competing with Pininfarina. The concept as put forward by Centro Stile&#x27;s Chris Bangle unexpectedly won the Fiat management over. The design previously offered by Pininfarina was eventually accepted by Peugeot, who adopted it as the 406 Coupé in October 1996.

On its launch in January 1994, the Coupé was available with a four-cylinder, 2.0 L 16V engine, in both turbo (190 PS) and normally aspirated (139 PS) versions. Both engines were later versions of Fiat&#x27;s twin-cam design and inherited from the Lancia Delta Integrale, winner of the World Rally Championship a record six times. 1996 brought in a 1.8 L 16V engine (not available in the United Kingdom, 131 PS), along with a 2.0 litre five cylinder 20V (147 PS), and a five-cylinder 2.0 litre 20V turbo (220 PS). Along with the new engines Fiat also made some minor design changes including the front grille, steering wheel, the door panel now included leather, the interior centre console was redesigned and the digital clock was replaced with an analog one.

Production of the right-hand drive models for markets including the UK began in early 1995, and continued until the end of Coupé production five years later.

Both the turbocharged 16V/4-cylinder and 20V/5-cylinder (four valves per cylinder) versions were equipped with a very efficient &quot;Viscodrive&quot; limited-slip differential to counter the understeer that plagues most powerful front wheel drive cars.

Additionally, the Coupé featured independent suspension all round: at the front MacPherson struts and lower wishbones anchored to an auxiliary crossbeam, offset coil springs and anti roll bar; at the rear, trailing arms mounted on an auxiliary subframe, coil springs and an anti roll bar.

1998 saw the release of the Limited Edition which could be identified externally by a body kit, titanium grey details such as the wheels, fuel cap, rear light cups, mirror casings and the Brembo brake calipers at the front were now painted red. Inside, the Limited Edition specification included a push-button start, Recaro seats with red leather inserts, Sparco pedals and the body-coloured dash was replaced with a titanium grey example. Mechanically, there were few changes over the standard 20V Turbo model, but the LE (as they came to be known) did add a six speed gearbox for the first time, strut brace and the engine covers were all painted red.

The LE was produced in Black (flat), Red (flat), Vinci Grey (metallic), Crono Grey (flat) and Steel Grey (metallic).

Each Limited Edition (&#x27;LE&#x27;) Coupé was manufactured with a badge located by the rear view mirror which contained that car&#x27;s unique number (it is rumoured that Michael Schumacher was the original owner of LE No. 0001, however when the question was raised to him personally he confirmed he had owned one, but a red one, while LE No. 0001 is a Crono Grey one). Originally, a spokesman from Fiat stated only approximately 300 Limited Editions would be built (although the plaques always allowed for four-figure numbers). The final amount was much higher, with numbers as high as 1400 touted by some. This angered many of the owners of the original 300 cars and almost certainly impacted residual values. The original number however was quoted by a spokesman for Fiat UK, so probably that number only applied to the United Kingdom.

In 1998, the 2.0 litre, five-cylinder 20V got a Variable Inlet System, which brought the power to . In addition, the sills of the Turbo version were colour matched with the body paintwork. Fiat also released the 2.0 litre five-cylinder Turbo &#x27;Plus&#x27;. This model came with an option kit that made it virtually identical to the LE, except for minor interior design changes and without the unique identification badge of the LE.

In early 2000, Fiat released another special version of the Fiat Coupé. Featuring the 1.8 litre engine, it was only available throughout mainland Europe and marketed as an elegant and affordable edition. This final version had different leather seats, a white speedometer with yellow arrows, new 16 inch BBS rims and the new &quot;honeycomb&quot; grille. Production finished in the summer of that year, with no plans for a direct successor.

Fiat also made changes throughout the rest of the range: new seats, side skirts, wheels for the 2.0 litre 20V model, &#x27;Plus&#x27; edition wheels and a six speed transmission as standard on turbo models, and Fiat manufactured seats on the &#x27;Plus&#x27; that were virtually identical to the original Plus Recaro seats with the addition of extra airbags.

The 2.0 litre 20V Turbo model is capable of accelerating from 0–100 km/h (0–62 mph) in 6.5 seconds, and 6.3 seconds for the 20v Turbo Plus, with a top speed of , or with the later six speed gearbox. When production finally ended in December 2000, a total number of 72,762 units had been produced.

<text>Independent Native Voice, also known as Native Voice, was a short-lived political party in Manitoba, Canada. It was created in 1995 to address aboriginal issues, and ran three candidates in the 1995 provincial election. Native Voice was not registered with Elections Manitoba, and its candidates were listed on the ballot as independents. After the election, accusations surfaced that Native Voice was funded by Progressive Conservative (PC) Party organizers to take votes from the New Democratic Party (NDP) in marginal constituencies.

== The election ==

Independent Native Voice&#x27;s leader was Nelson Contois, who contested Manitoba&#x27;s Swan River constituency. The other candidates were Nelson&#x27;s daughter Carey Contois in Dauphin, and Darryl Sutherland in Interlake.

Independent Native Voice was one of two unregistered parties to focus on aboriginal issues in the 1995 campaign. The other was the First Peoples Party (FPP) led by Jerry Fontaine, the nephew of future Canadian Assembly of First Nations leader Phil Fontaine. The FPP had no formal association with Independent Native Voice, and was not implicated in the post-election controversy. Nelson and Carey Contois nevertheless affiliated with the FPP in mid-campaign, and ran with endorsements from both parties. Sutherland did not join the FPP, and was not in regular contact with the Contoises after declaring his candidacy. According to later reports, Sutherland told Jerry Fontaine during the campaign that Progressive Conservative organizers had promised him at least $3,000 to declare his candidacy. Fontaine encouraged Sutherland to take his story to the media, though Sutherland did not do so at the time.

On April 22, 1995, the &quot;Winnipeg Free Press&quot; newspaper quoted Progressive Conservative organizer Allan Aitken as saying that he had assisted Sutherland and the Contoises in setting up their campaigns. He said he only wanted to ensure &quot;everyone ha[d] an equal shot at running&quot;, and denied suggestions that his actions contravened provincial law. Bill Uruski, a former NDP Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA), was quoted in the same article as speculating that Aitken&#x27;s assistance was a ploy &quot;to undermine NDP support in the native communities&quot;. Two days later, Sutherland told the &quot;Interlake Spectator&quot; that he had accepted help from Progressive Conservative organizers early in the campaign, but later distanced himself from these figures. He said that his candidacy was legitimate. The controversy attracted relatively little attention during the campaign.

Independent Native Voice fared poorly as a party, receiving a total of 518 votes. Nelson Contois received 118 votes (1.36%), Carey Contois received 111 (1.15%) and Sutherland received 289 (3.90%). The NDP won all three constituencies, although the Progressive Conservatives came within thirty-six votes of winning Swan River. Provincially, the Progressive Conservatives under Gary Filmon were re-elected with their second consecutive majority government. The NDP registered a complaint with Elections Manitoba concerning the Native Voice candidacies, but no charges were laid.

== Scandal ==

Following extensive journalistic work by reporter Curt Petrovich, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) interviewed Sutherland and ran an exposé of his candidacy on June 22, 1998. This story, and subsequent follow-up reports, included accusations by Sutherland that Progressive Conservative organizers were guilty of vote-rigging and inducement in the 1995 campaign. The resulting scandal became a political flashpoint in the province. A &quot;Winnipeg Free Press&quot; article from June 24 noted that Sutherland was receiving $111 bi-weekly in welfare payments at the time of the election, yet contributed almost $5,000 to his own campaign chest. On the same day, Sutherland named local Progressive Conservative organizer Cubby Barrett as the source of his funds.

Premier Filmon initially rejected these reports, and said that he trusted Elections Manitoba more than the CBC. He nonetheless called a public inquiry under judge Alfred Monnin before the end of June, in response to mounting evidence of improper behaviour. Monnin ruled that local Progressive Conservative organizers were guilty of inducing at least one candidate (Sutherland) to contest the election. Senior party organizer Taras Sokolyk was personally implicated, when it was discovered that he had channelled party funds to Aitken during the campaign. In his summary, Monnin described the behaviour of Conservative organizers as &quot;unethical&quot; and &quot;morally reprehensible&quot;.

Monnin&#x27;s inquiry did not conclude that the Contois candidacies were induced by Progressive Conservative organizers, although suspicions remained. Premier Filmon was not implicated in the scandal. No charges were filed against Barrett and Aitken, as the statute of limitations for illegal inducement had expired after two years.

Referring to the scandal in 1998, Jerry Fontaine argued that &quot;the Tories took advantage of Aboriginal individuals who weren&#x27;t all that involved in political issues or political life&quot;. The scandal contributed to the defeat of Filmon&#x27;s government in the 1999 election.

Independent Native Voice ceased to exist after 1995.

<doc id="922228" wikidata="Q609454" url="?curid=922228" title="Subaru Alcyone SVX">
<text>The Subaru Alcyone SVX, marketed outside Japan as the Subaru SVX, is a two-door, front-engine, all- or front-wheel drive coupé manufactured and marketed by Subaru from 1991 to 1996 over a single generation. 

Superseding the company&#x27;s aviation-influenced XT range, the Alcyone SVX was Subaru&#x27;s first entry into the luxury/performance market, and was noted for its aircraft-inspired &#x27;window-within-a-window&#x27; side-glass configuration.

The nameplate &quot;Alcyone&quot; (pronounced &quot;al-SIGH-uh-nee&quot;) refers to the brightest star in the Pleiades constellation, stylized in the Subaru company logo. The suffix &quot;SVX&quot; is an acronym for &quot;Subaru Vehicle X&quot;.

== Development ==
The Subaru Alcyone SVX debuted as a concept at the 1989 Tokyo Auto Show with styling by noted Italian designer Giorgetto Giugiaro of ItalDesign. The SVX entered production, retaining its window-within-a-window configuration, adapted from the previous generation Subaru Alcyone with an additional extension of glass covering the A-pillar — which Subaru described as an &quot;aircraft-inspired glass-to-glass canopy.&quot;

In contrast to the angular XT, the SVX featured softer lines with its two-piece power side windows. Each side window featured an operable section roughly two-thirds of the entire windows size, with the division parallel to the upper curve of the door frame. The SVX featured a drag coefficient of , identical to that of the XT coupe it replaced. European market cars had a slightly lower wind resistance of , thanks to a larger undertray.

From 1991 to 1992, Subaru displayed the &quot;Amadeus&quot;, a prototype shooting brake variation on the SVX, in both two- and four-door versions, which was considered for production. Ultimately the &quot;Amadeus&quot; was not produced.

== Powertrain ==
The SVX debuted with and remained available with only one engine, the &quot;EG33&quot; model 3.3-liter boxer horizontally opposed flat-six. This engine was the largest engine produced by Subaru for its passenger cars until the introduction of the 3.6-liter &quot;EZ36&quot; engine in the 2008 Subaru Tribeca. The previous generation Subaru Alcyone had a turbocharged four-cylinder engine, but the larger &quot;EG33&quot; was more powerful and so a turbo was not installed.

Internally, the engine is essentially a six-cylinder variant of the &quot;EJ22&quot; found in the first-generation Japanese market Legacy and Impreza. The new 3.3-liter variant was equipped with DOHC and four valves per cylinder, and had an increased compression ratio of 10.1:1, bringing power up to at 5,400 rpm with of torque at 4,400 rpm. Fuel delivery was accomplished with sequential multi-port fuel injection with dual-spray injectors. Engine ignition used platinum spark plugs and a computerized management system with &quot;limp home feature&quot;, which included over-rev protection, as well as monitors for fuel injection and ignition.

The exhaust system consisted of head pipes from each bank of cylinders with their own pre-catalytic converters, which entered a dual-inlet / single outlet main catalytic converter. A single exhaust pipe exited the main converter and went into a resonator, and onto the main, transverse, single-inlet muffler with twin exhaust tips in the bumper.

The SVX was offered solely with an automatic transmissions, as Subaru did not offer a manual transmission capable of handling the horsepower and torque of the &quot;EG33&quot; engine at the time.
Subaru offered two all-wheel drive systems for the automatic transmission, called ACT-4 or VTD. The first system, called ACT-4 (active torque split) was introduced on the 1988.5 Alcyone using an electronic control unit to vary the torque applied to the rear wheels dynamically based on driving conditions. As an active system, it varied the torque split to the rear infinitely based on several inputs as a percentage of the torque available to the directly geared front wheels, never to exceed the theoretical &quot;full lock&quot; of 50% rear bias. This AWD system was used throughout the entire production run in vehicles manufactured for sale in the US. A more advanced system called VTD (variable torque distribution), was used on SVX for sale in Japan, Europe and Brazil. The VTD AWD system adds a planetary center differential. The system retains the use of the ACT clutch and active control, though its size and role are much smaller as it is used only to suppress differential action instead of the complete differential function. When no speed difference exists between front and rear, the entire VTD gear rotates as a unit and torque split is at a mechanical 36/64 biased by the planetary gear ratio. The clutch is incorporated to prevent and suppress any differential action that may occur as the planetary gear will send virtually all torque to the axle with the highest speed if not restrained. By using a similar logic to the previous ACT system, the clutch can theoretically direct any percentage of torque to either axle, but in practice the variation remains between 34-50% front and 64-50% rear. This system is not capable of operating in 2WD and therefore could not be used on 2WD dynos as required for emissions testing in some states. This prevented VTD as an option on Subaru vehicles offered for sale in US until passenger car regulations were changed, which occurred long after the end of svx production. It was later introduced to the US with the Outback VDC.

Problems with early SVX transmissions included a defective torque converter clutch which disintegrates and clogs early radiators (both clutch and radiator changed in 1993), and had systemic high clutch failures due to lower than spec pump pressure, fluid evacuation, and clutch balance pressure. Several major revisions were made, all of which are included by late 1994 production. Shortly after the SVX ended production Subaru transitioned to a completely redesigned 4 speed unit.

The Japanese-spec &quot;SVX L&quot; received four-wheel steering in 1991 and 1992 (model code &quot;CXD&quot; of which 1,905 were built). The VTD equipped versions received the &quot;CXW&quot; chassis code. In an attempt to lower the price for the US market, a front-wheel drive (&quot;CXV&quot;) was offered in 1994 and 1995 but sales were less than stellar.

== Market ==

Sales of the SVX reached 14,257 in the United States and a total of 24,379 worldwide. 2,478 SVXs were sold in Europe (of which 951 went to Switzerland, 854 to Germany, and 60 to France). Roughly 7,000 of all SVXs sold were right-hand drive models. Included in this number were the 249 vehicles sold in Australia, at a cost between approx. A$73,000 to A$83,000. 5,884 units remained in Japan.

The SVX was also developed and released during Japan&#x27;s &quot;bubble economy&quot;, and as the economic condition in Japan continued to decline, it had an effect on sales in Japan.

=== Asia ===
In Japan, the SVX was the first Subaru to exceed government dimension regulations with regards to the vehicles exterior measurements. The SVX also obligated Japanese buyers to pay more annual road tax which limited sales due to the engine displacement. The SVX was not Subaru&#x27;s first car to be sold in Japan with an engine bigger than two litres; this honor goes to the preceding Alcyone XT6.

The models offered in Japan were the L (similar to the LSi in the US) and the S4. As a result, in Japan the SVX was considered a luxury vehicle and was equipped appropriately with one-touch climate control, leather interior, front seats that were both electrically adjustable and heated, a single-disc CD player coupled with a Panasonic AM/FM stereo system, that was hidden behind a retractable panel, and a remote-controlled infrared keyless entry with security system. Later S-Four badged versions had . Some later Japanese models also came with upgraded 16-inch forged diamond spoke BBS alloy wheels instead of the 16-inch 5-spoke wheels that was standard equipment that most SVX’s came with.

Television advertising in Japan used Alison Krauss singing &quot;Five Hundred Miles&quot;, a reference to the car being able to travel on one tank of fuel, with a fuel economy of .

=== North America ===
Subaru introduced the SVX in the United States in July 1991 (as a 1992 model), following the US debut with a Japanese market introduction in September of that same year. The model was designed and marketed as the replacement for the Alcyone XT and Alcyone XT6 coupes. Outside Japan, the Alcyone designation was dropped, and the car was marketed as the Subaru SVX. The 1992 Subaru Legacy received a facelift inspired by the SVX. The introduction of the SVX followed the 1990 introduction of the Acura NSX and the 1980 introduction of the Isuzu Piazza.

The MSRP for the US base model 1992 SVX-L was $24,445, with the top-of-the-line model with touring package (leather trim, 8 way electronic seat adjustment, tilt and slide sunroof), the LS-L, listing at $28,000. This was $8,000–$11,000 higher than any previous Subaru. A rear spoiler was optional on the 1992 L and LS-L models and was included as standard equipment beginning in 1993. In 1992 only there was an XR model that included the rear spoiler as standard and was the only difference from the LS-L. However the spoiler put the model over the import weight limit so it was dropped after the first production run and the spoilers were shipped separately. By the end of its production run in 1996, the price had risen to $36,740 for the top-of-the-line LSi, which was the same trim level as the 1992 LS-L

A front-wheel drive version was offered on the SVX during the 1994–1995 model year, which cost about $5,300 less than the AWD version in 1994 and $1500 difference in 1995. In 1994, FWD was offered on both the base L model (X33 in the VIN) and on the mid-range LS model (X34 in the VIN) with AWD only available on LSi. In 1995, only the base L model was offered in FWD (X33 in the 5th, 6th and 7th digits of the VIN) with AWD being optional for L and standard on LSi. The 1995 model year L FWD is so rare that many have never heard of or seen one, leading some experts to believe that extraordinarily few, or perhaps even none, were actually built that way even if it was technically listed as available.

With Subaru forecasting sales of 10,000 each year, SVX sales reached 5,280 in 1992 and 3,859 cars in 1993. Production ended in December 1996, with sales continuing into 1997 — and 640 units sold in the final year. 

In the United States, as well as a Canada, the automatic motorized shoulder belts (paired with a driver-side aribag) were equipped on the 1992-1993 models and the 1994 L models. The manual front seat belts (paired with dual front airbags) were equipped on the 1994-1997 LS and LSi models, and the 1995-1997 L models.

== Motorsports ==
In 1991, a Subaru SVX, driven by Ken Knight and Bob Dart, won the Alcan Winter Rally, a race starting in Seattle to the Arctic Circle and back.

In the early 1990s there was a Subaru SVX PPG Pace Car. It featured a silver to purple fade paint job, silver wheels in the front, purple wheels in the rear, &quot;SVX&quot; windshield banner, roll cage and an amber roof light. It was evaluated by Wally Dallenbach Sr, Indy Car Chief Steward and PPG Pace Car evaluator. It was used as a promotional tool for Subaru, as well as a pace car. While most pace cars were retired after one season, the SVX proved to be such a worthy example and a favorite, and was used for several seasons. It was in storage for many years in the &quot;Subaru Performance Attic&quot; in Cherry Hill, New Jersey near Subaru of America&#x27;s new headquarters in Camden, New Jersey.

<text>The Test of Spoken English (TSE) was an oral test developed by Educational Testing Service which measured the ability of nonnative English speakers to communicate effectively. As of March 2010, the TSE has been superseded by the speaking portion of the TOEFL iBT as well as by the SPEAK test.

Before its retirement, TSE scores were used by academic institutions, corporations, government agencies, health care systems, and other organizations to guide their decisions regarding graduate assistantships in teaching and research, hiring new workers, and licensing and certifying existing employees.

==Scoring==
The TSE score consisted of a single score of communicative language ability, which was reported on a scale of 20 to 60. Assigned score levels were averaged across items and raters, and the scores were reported in increments of five (i.e., 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, and 60).

==Notable changes to the sport==
Times have consistently dropped over the years due to better training techniques and new developments within the sport.

In the first four Olympics, competitions were not held in pools, but rather in open water (1896, the Mediterranean Sea; 1900, the Seine; 1904, an artificial lake; 1906, the Mediterranean). The 1904 Olympics&#x27; races were the only ones ever measured in yards, instead of the usual metres. A 100-metre pool was built for the 1908 Olympics and was located in the centre of the main stadium&#x27;s track and field oval. The 1912 Olympics, held in the Stockholm harbor, marked the beginning of electrical timing.

Male swimmers wore full body swimsuits up until the 1940s, which caused more drag in the water than their modern swim-wear counterparts. Also, over the years, pool designs have lessened the drag. Some design considerations allow for the reduction of swimming resistance making the pool faster, namely, proper pool depth, elimination of waves, elimination of currents, increased lane width, energy absorbing racing lane lines and gutters, and the use of other innovative hydraulic, acoustic, illumination, and swimwear designs.

The 1924 Olympics were the first to use the standard 50-metre pool with marked lanes (a standard that remains to this day). In the freestyle, swimmers originally dove from the pool walls, but diving blocks were first incorporated at the 1936 Summer Olympics. The flip-turn was developed by the 1950s. Swimming goggles were first allowed in 1976.

The butterfly stroke events were not held until 1956. Previous rules permitted the butterfly stroke in breaststroke races. After 1956, when these rules were changed, butterfly became its own stroke entirely.

The 800m event was added to the women&#x27;s programme in 1968; whilst longer, this event was not as far as the men&#x27;s 1,500m event. This discrepancy was evened out in 2020: that year, the 1,500 metres was included in the women&#x27;s programme for the first time and the 800 metres freestyle was added to the men&#x27;s programme.

Both men and women were granted the 200 metres freestyle race in 1968, giving swimmers an intermediate distance race between 100 metres and 400 metres.

The women&#x27;s 4 × 200 metres freestyle relay race was added in 1996—a men&#x27;s relay race at that distance had been held since 1912; interestingly, the winning time for the women&#x27;s 4 × 200 metres freestyle relay in 1996 was more than two minutes faster than the men&#x27;s 4 × 200 metres freestyle relay of 1912. At six Games, the men had two freestyle relay races, while the women had one. Starting with 1996, both genders have two.

The medley relay races (4 × 100 metres) were not held for men or for women until 1960, but they have continued in every Games since then. 

Starting in 2008, both men and women compete in 10 km open water marathon swim events.

The mixed 4 × 100 metres medley relay (2 women and 2 men) was added to the programme in the 2020 Olympic Games.

<doc id="922249" wikidata="Q1676963" url="?curid=922249" title="Jack &amp; Bobby">
<text>Jack &amp; Bobby is an American drama television series created by Greg Berlanti, Vanessa Taylor, Steven A. Cohen, and Brad Meltzer. It aired on The WB from September 12, 2004, to May 11, 2005. The series’ title is a reference to real-life political brothers John and Robert Kennedy.

The series starred Matt Long and Logan Lerman as Jack and Bobby McCallister, respectively; two teenage brothers in Missouri of whom one would become the president of the United States from 2041 to 2049. The series also starred Christine Lahti as their mother, a college professor, as well as Jessica Paré, John Slattery, Edwin Hodge, Keri Lynn Pratt, and Bradley Cooper. Episodes would generally focus on the boys&#x27; family and school lives, with flash-forwards of a documentary about President McCallister used as a framing device.

While it received critical acclaim, &quot;Jack &amp; Bobby&quot; struggled from low ratings on the network and was cancelled on May 17, 2005.

== Premise ==
The series follows the lives of fifteen-year-old Jack and thirteen-year-old Bobby McCallister, two teen boys being raised by their strong-willed mother Grace in a small Missouri college town. Grace is a history professor at the local university and has an unconventional approach to parenting, which includes discouraging her sons from watching TV. Elder brother Jack is popular and a star on the track team, while Bobby is nerdy and asthmatic. Each episode is interspersed with flash-forwards from a documentary about the life of President McCallister, who would take office in the 2040s. The documentary clips feature interviews with members of the McCallister administration reflecting on the president&#x27;s years in office and how his formative experiences shaped his later life and how he governed. It is not revealed which of the McCallister brothers would later become president until the end of the pilot episode.

== Development ==
The idea for the series was conceived by novelist Brad Meltzer and Steve Cohen, the latter who served as deputy communications director in Hillary Clinton’s office during her husband&#x27;s tenure as president. In 2002, Meltzer and Cohen pitched their idea to Thomas Schlamme, then an executive producer on &quot;The West Wing&quot;. The WB agreed to produce the series and Schlamme brought on &quot;Dawson’s Creek&quot; alum Greg Berlanti as well as Berlanti’s &quot;Everwood&quot; colleague Vanessa Taylor to pen the pilot episode.

Taylor said her writing on the pilot was informed by her feelings about current events, particularly the Iraq War and the failed search for weapons of mass destruction. Taylor said at the time, &quot;I just feel that we&#x27;ve come into an era in which there&#x27;s a certain brazenness about lying to the American public. Which, in turn, has fostered a certain degree of cynicism and apathy.&quot; The show&#x27;s title is meant to &quot;evoke the hopefulness of the Camelot era.&quot;

Berlanti said he intended to eschew the use of the words “Democrat” and “Republican” in the pilot to “avoid criticism…based on partisan politics.” He added that the show’s emphasis on the boys’ formative years “underscores how life&#x27;s seemingly insignificant events can ‘have ripple effects on the future that are exponential.’”

Though the character of Grace does not steer her sons towards a particular ideology, the series creators said the show would not avoid taking stands on certain issues. Said Schlamme, &quot;Besides the personal stories, [&quot;Jack &amp; Bobby&quot;] allows us to talk about thematic elements that are existing in 2004 America, which is race, which is religion, which is war, and kind of get: How did these little snapshots of his life right now affect the future of the world? And then we get to see how, in fact, they could affect the future of the world.&quot;

The WB ordered 13 episodes of &quot;Jack &amp; Bobby&quot; prior to mid-May 2004 when TV networks traditionally unveil their fall season lineups, which garnered the new series advance buzz as the first show to be picked up for the 2004 fall season. The WB acquired the show as part of a wider attempt to cultivate older audiences beyond teenagers.

==Episodes==
== Reception ==

=== Critical reception ===
The show was acclaimed by multiple critics and outlets. On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the show has a rating of 88% based on 16 critical reviews. Rob Owen of the &quot;Pittsburgh Post-Gazette&quot; wrote &quot;Jack &amp; Bobby&quot; is &quot;undoubtedly the most grown-up series&quot; aired by the youth-skewing WB network and called it &quot;an absorbing drama with hints of the idealism found in early seasons of &quot;&#x27;The West Wing&quot;.&#x27;&quot;

Alessandra Stanley of &quot;The&quot; &quot;New York Times&quot; wrote the show &quot;could have been just another coming-of-age tale of teenagers growing up in a small town with an overbearing single mother,&quot; but its historical framing sets it apart. She wrote, &quot;&#x27;&quot;Jack &amp; Bobby&quot;&#x27; is unusual in many ways, and one is that unlike so many modern shows it is cynical about television but deeply romantic about politics and public service...moments of misty patriotic yearning are leavened with sharp dialogue and self-mocking asides, including some at the expense of other WB series. (On tonight&#x27;s episode, Jack sarcastically tells his mother that their family is ‘straight out of &quot;&#x27;7th Heaven&quot;’).”

Stanley praised Christine Lahti’s performance in particular, writing “Ms. Lahti is an actress who works the underlayers of each role and resists the pull of easy sentiment. Grace is a complicated, strong woman who is sympathetic without being quite likable, and that makes both her bond with Bobby (he helps her match her outfits) and her tensely hostile relationship with Jack plausible.”

Writing for &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, Gillian Flynn gave the show a grade of A− and said, &quot;On a grand scale, &quot;&#x27;Jack &amp; Bobby&quot;&#x27; reflects the American obsession with picking apart our childhoods ad nauseam for clues to the adults we become.&quot; In &quot;The New Yorker,&quot; Nancy Franklin likened the show to a mix between &quot;The Wonder Years&quot; and &quot;The West Wing&quot;, concluding it “is most emotionally effective when the lines that are drawn between Bobby’s boyhood and his adulthood meander through unexpected oxbows.”

James Poniewozik of &quot;Time&quot; found the documentary flash-forwards to be distracting, but said it’s “a smart, well-written show that constantly subverts our expectations, and it takes a rare demographic risk.”

A plot line about the parentage of Jack and Bobby, in which the mother had hid the fact that the boy&#x27;s father was &quot;just a Mexican dishwasher&quot;, received criticism from the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; and was described by &quot;The New Yorker&quot; as implausibly convenient.

=== Awards and nominations ===
=== Cancelation ===
Despite critical acclaim and a strong start, the show was not a successful ratings draw for the network, averaging only 2.7 million weekly viewers, and was canceled by The WB on May 17, 2005. This has been partly attributed to its airing in the same Sunday night time slot as popular primetime series &quot;Desperate Housewives&quot;. The WB changed its time slot to Wednesdays, though the ratings did not improve as it was then competing against &quot;The West Wing&quot;, &quot;The Bachelor&quot;, and &quot;American Idol.&quot;

To date, physical home media for the series has not been released, but it has intermittently been made available for digital purchase on Amazon and iTunes.

<doc id="922250" wikidata="Q320509" url="?curid=922250" title="Robert Quiroga">
<text>Robert Quiroga (October 10, 1969August 16, 2004) was the International Boxing Federation Super flyweight champion from 1990 to 1993. Quiroga successfully defended his title five times and retired in 1995. He finished with 20–2 with 11 KOs. Quiroga was the first world champion from San Antonio, Texas.

==Professional career==

Quiroga made his professional debut on March 16, 1987, at the age of 17. In his 12th professional fight, he defeated former WBA light flyweight champion Joey Olivo. Two fights later, he claimed the IBF Super Flyweight title with a decision win over champion Juan Polo Perez. Later that year, he defended his title with victories over Vuyani Nene and Vincenzo Belcastro.

On June 15, 1991, at the HemisFair Arena in San Antonio, Quiroga defended his IBF Super Flyweight Title for the third time with a brutal and bloody twelve-round unanimous decision over undefeated &quot;Kid&quot; Akeem Anifowoshe. Anifowoshe collapsed after the fight with a blood clot on the brain, and never fought again. The fight was named 1991 Ring Magazine Fight of the Year. The following year, he defeated undefeated challenger Carlos Mercado and former WBO Super Flyweight champion Jose Ruiz.

In 1993, his championship reign came to an end with a tko loss to Julio César Borboa. He returned to the ring in 1995, but lost by majority decision.

==Murder==

On August 16, 2004, Richard Merla, then a member of the Bandidos Motorcycle Club, was playing cards with Quiroga when a dispute arose concerning a Scarface poster that Merla had taken from one of Quiroga&#x27;s friends. Merla stabbed Quiroga later that night and Quiroga subsequently died on the scene. Afterwards, the Bandidos member was convicted of the murder and received a sentence of 40 years in prison. The Bandidos released an official statement that the former member (Richard Merla) had acted alone and without the consent or knowledge of the club, and he was expelled as a member.

<doc id="922259" wikidata="Q3295589" url="?curid=922259" title="Flat-six engine">
<text>A flat-six engine, also known as a horizontally opposed-six, is a six-cylinder piston engine with three cylinders on each side of a central crankshaft. The most common type of flat-six engine is the boxer-six engine, where each pair of opposed cylinders moves inwards and outwards at the same time. An alternative configuration for flat engines is a 180-degree V engine, where both cylinders move to the right then the left at the same time.

The advantages of the flat-six layout are good engine balance (for reduced vibration), a low center of gravity, short length (compared with an inline-six engine) and being well suited to air-cooling. The disadvantages are a large width (which can limit the maximum steering angle when used in a front-engined car), a large intake manifold being required when a central carburetor is used, and duplication of the inlet and outlet connections for water-cooled engines.

The first production flat-six engine was in the 1904 &quot;Wilson-Pilcher 18/24 HP&quot; car. The most notable use of flat-six engines is the Porsche 911 sports car, which has used flat-six engines continuously since 1963. Several other car manufacturers, including Subaru, have produced flat-six engines at times. Flat-six engines have also occasionally been used in motorcycles, and commonly in general aviation aircraft, along with the flat-four engine.

== Engine balance ==

A boxer-style flat-six engine is able to have perfect primary and secondary balance. As in other six-cylinder engines, the overlapping of the power strokes of the different cylinders (with a firing interval of 120 degrees in a four-stroke engine) reduces the pulsating of the power delivery relative to that of similar engines with fewer cylinders. 

In a boxer configuration, a flat-six engine does not have a rocking couple. The symmetry of the arrangement, in which one bank of three cylinders is mirrored by the other bank, means that there is no net force from any given mirrored cylinder pair along the axis of movement of the pistons. So not only is there no net primary or secondary reciprocating effect, there is no net turning force - moment - that would try to rotate the engine back and forth about its engine mountings. (The moment is not quite zero in practice because each cylinder pair is offset slightly from the other, or else they would clash at the crankshaft.) In this regard, the six cylinder boxer engine is the same as a flat-four boxer engine, which also does not experience any rocking couple.

These characteristics result in low vibration for flat-six engines (as in straight-six engines), especially when compared with the imbalances that are present in V6 engines with a 90-degree bank angle.

== Use in aircraft ==
Early flat-six engines include the Franklin O-265 which began production in 1940, and the Lycoming O-435 which began production in 1942. Several manufacturers use the letter &quot;O&quot; in their model codes for flat-layout engines as a designation for “opposed” cylinder layouts. The Franklin O-335 was used in the Bell 47 light helicopter. 

Flat engines largely replaced the historically more popular radial engines in small aircraft after World War II because they were less expensive to manufacture. The smaller frontal area compared with a radial engine also results in less drag.

Some aircraft have used flat-six engines originally designed for cars. The Porsche PFM 3200 engine, produced from 1985 to 1991, was based on the engine used in the Porsche 911 sports car. Several examples of the Pietenpol Air Camper homebuilt monoplane aircraft have used the air-cooled engine from the Chevrolet Corvair compact car. Compared with the engines used in cars, flat-six engines used by helicopters have large displacements and are low revving, producing more torque and less power.

A notable recent flat-six aero-engine is the 4-litre side-valve Belgian D-Motor LF39, a modular variant of the 2.7-litre flat-four D-Motor LF26. Although the side-valve format has long been abandoned for most automotive applications because its combustion chamber is a bar to high engine rpm, the massively over-square (1.295:1) D-Motor is a very simple, low-revving, compact, reliable lightweight aero-engine (without the heavy (and bulky) complication of ohv valve-gear).

== Use in automobiles ==
=== Porsche ===


The flat-six engine is often associated with the Porsche 911, a rear-engined sports car which has used flat-six engines exclusively since 1963. The engines were air-cooled until 1999, when Porsche started using water-cooled engines.

Other Porsche models that use flat-six engines are the 1970–1972 Porsche 914/6 (mid-engine), the 1986–1993 Porsche 959 (rear-engine), and the 1996–2021 Porsche Boxster/Cayman (mid-engine).
=== Other manufacturers ===
The first car to use a flat-six engine was the 1904–1907 &quot;Wilson-Pilcher 18/24 HP&quot;, which used an engine based on a flat-four engine with two cylinders added. The Wilson-Pilcher was a front-engined car with the crankshaft in-line with the chassis and the cylinders between the chassis rails. Reports on this car quote it as being &quot;remarkably silent and smooth running&quot; and &quot;almost total absence of vibration&quot;.

Two American manufacturers briefly produced cars with flat-six engines—the 1948 Tucker 48 (water-cooled, based on the Franklin O-335) and the 1960–1969 Chevrolet Corvair (air-cooled). Both are rear-engined cars with rear-wheel drive. Chevrolet produced over 1.8 million Corvairs of various types and utilized a turbocharger on some models; one of the first uses of a turbocharger on a mass-produced automobile.

Japanese manufacturer Subaru produced water-cooled flat-6 engines from 1988–1996 and 2000–2019. Their first flat-6 engine, the Subaru ER27, was added to the model range of the Subaru XT coupe. In 1991, the Subaru EG33 engine was used in the Subaru Alcyone SVX, the replacement for the Subaru XT. Following a hiatus of flat-6 engine production for four years, the Subaru EZ30 engine was introduced in the 2000 Subaru Legacy/Outback. The Subaru EZ36 engine was introduced in 2007 and was produced until 2019. All engines were used in front-engine cars with all-wheel drive, plus the XT and Alcyone SVX were also available with front-wheel drive.
== Use in motorcycles ==

Most motorcycles use engines with four or fewer cylinders, however the Honda Gold Wing touring motorcycle has used a water-cooled flat-six engine since 1988. Initially, the engine had a displacement of , until it was enlarged to in 2001.

The Honda Valkyrie F6C (1997–2003) was a cruiser based on the GL1500 Gold Wing. The limited edition 2004 Valkyrie Rune was based on the GL1800.

<text>Maine North High School (officially was known as Maine Township High School North) was a public four–year high school in Des Plaines, Illinois, United States, located northwest of Chicago. Maine North was located in unincorporated Maine Township, part of Maine Township High School District 207. Maine North served parts of Des Plaines, Glenview, and Niles. Opened in August 1970, Maine North closed in May 1981. The building is constructed in brutalist style, and its architect was Donald Stillwaugh.

==History==
As student population declined, the decision came down to closing Maine East or Maine North. Maine East, the oldest school in the district, opened in 1929, but also had considerable numbers of alumni and students with the S.O.S. (Save Our School) campaign pushing to keep it open. On November 17, 1980, the school board voted, 4–3, to close Maine North by the following year, citing that it was not only the smallest school, but the least centrally located of the schools in the district. In October, the board voted to close the school at the end of the 1980–1981 school year. The building was subsequently sold along with the District&#x27;s administrative building, which had its offices relocated to Maine South High School.

== Filming &quot;The Breakfast Club&quot; ==
After its closing, Maine North was used for location shooting of the 1985 movie &quot;The Breakfast Club,&quot; filmed in the spring of 1984. The library scenes in the movie were shot in the school gymnasium, where a set was constructed. A plaque downstairs in the building commemorates the movie being shot there.

Decades after the film&#x27;s release, alumni of other area schools have claimed the final shot of the film was shot at their school&#x27;s football field. However these rumors are false. On the 30th anniversary of the film&#x27;s release, the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; specifically asked the film&#x27;s cinematographer, Thomas Del Ruth, to address this controversy. He said: &quot;The field shot? We did it behind the same school where we were shooting. We never left the premises during production.&quot;

== Later uses ==

The school was also used as a training facility for the Chicago Blitz of the short-lived United States Football League and was renamed Blitz Park by head coach George Allen. It also later served as a mortuary college. In 1986, the school&#x27;s interior was featured in another movie, &quot;Ferris Bueller&#x27;s Day Off&quot;.

As of 2023, the Maine North High School building is the district headquarters for the Illinois State Police.

<text>An Giang is a province of Vietnam. It is located in the Mekong Delta, in the southwestern part of the country.

== Geography ==

An Giang occupies a position in the upper reaches of the Mekong Delta. The Hậu Giang and Tiền Giang branches of the Mekong River are the dominant geographical features of the province. With the exception of the west, most of An Giang is fairly flat and is criss-crossed by many canals and small rivers. This terrain has led to An Giang being a significant agricultural center, producing significant quantities of rice.

The Cấm Mountains, also known as the Thất Sơn range or the &quot;Seven Mountains&quot;, are located in the western Tịnh Biên District. Followers of the Bửu Sơn Kỳ Hương tradition, founded in An Giang in 1849, refer to these mountains as &quot;Bửu Sơn&quot;, &quot;Precious Mountains&quot;.

== Etymology ==
The province&#x27;s name is derived from the Sino-Vietnamese word: , meaning &quot;peaceful river&quot;.

== Administrative divisions ==
An Giang is subdivided into 11 district-level sub-divisions:

* Districts:
# An Phú: 3 towns and 11 rural communes
# Châu Phú: 2 town and 11 rural communes
# Châu Thành: 2 town and 11 rural communes
# Chợ Mới: 3 towns and 15 rural communes
# Phú Tân: 2 towns and 16 rural communes
# Thoại Sơn: 3 towns and 14 rural communes
# Tri Tôn: 3 towns and 12 rural communes
* District-level town:
# Tân Châu: 5 wards and 9 rural communes
# Tịnh Biên: 7 wards and 7 rural communes
* Provincial cities:
# Châu Đốc: 5 wards and 2 rural communes
# Long Xuyên: 11 wards and 2 rural communes (capital of province)

* They are further subdivided into 18 commune-level towns (or townlets), 110 communes, and 28 wards (156 in total).
== Demographics ==
An Giang first became a province in 1832, having been settled by the Vietnamese migrants moving southwards in search of new land. It is believed that An Giang was once an important center of the 1st millennium Óc Eo culture, presumably owing to its position on the river. Traditionally, An Giang has been known for its silk industry.

An Giang is home to a substantial number of people from Vietnam&#x27;s ethnic minorities. Due to the province&#x27;s proximity to Cambodia, the Khmer Krom are the largest non-Vietnamese group of the province. Other groups, such as the Chams and ethnic Chinese (Hoa), are also found in An Giang.

As of 2020, An Giang Province covers an area of 3,536.83 square kilometers with a population of 1,904,532 people, resulting in a population density of 539 people per square kilometer.

The province is home to 24,011 households of ethnic minorities, comprising 114,632 people, accounting for 5.17% of the total provincial population.

== Notable people ==
*Tôn Đức Thắng, prominent Communist and former President of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam; later became the first President of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam (Long Xuyên).
*Nguyễn Ngọc Thơ, vice-president of the Republic of Vietnam before April 30, 1975 (Long Xuyên).

<doc id="922371" wikidata="Q209789" url="?curid=922371" title="Burping">
<text>Burping (also called belching and eructation) is the release of gas from the upper digestive tract (esophagus and stomach) of animals through the mouth. It is always audible.

In humans, burping can be caused by normal eating processes, or as a side effect of other medical conditions. There is a range of levels of social acceptance for burping: within certain contexts and cultures, burping is acceptable and may even be perceived as humorous, while in others it is seen as impolite or even offensive and therefore unacceptable.

Humans are not the only animals that burp: it is very common among other mammals. In particular, burping by domesticated ruminants, such as cows or sheep, is a major contributor of methane emissions and may have a negative effect on the environment. Significant research is being done to find mitigation strategies for ruminant burping, e.g. modifying the animals&#x27; diets with &quot;Asparagopsis taxiformis&quot; (red seaweed).

==Causes==
*Burping is usually caused by swallowing air when eating or drinking and subsequently expelling it, in which the expelled gas is mainly a mixture of nitrogen and oxygen. 
*Burps can be caused by drinking beverages that contain dissolved carbon dioxide, such as beer and carbonated drinks; in these cases, the expelled gas is mainly carbon dioxide.
*Burping can be caused by swallowing air while consuming chewing gum, sucking on hard candy, talking while eating or drinking, or while smoking. It may also occur through swallowing air as a habit.
*Diabetes drugs such as metformin and exenatide can cause burping, especially at higher doses. This often resolves in a few weeks. 
*Burping combined with other symptoms such as dyspepsia, nausea and heartburn may be a sign of an ulcer or hiatal hernia, and should be reviewed by a physician. 
*Other causes of burping include food allergies, gallbladder diseases, &quot;H. pylori&quot;, acid reflux disease and gastritis.

==Complications==
In microgravity environments, burping is frequently associated with regurgitation, known as wet burping. With reduced gravity, the stomach contents are more likely to rise up into the esophagus when the gastroesophageal sphincter is relaxed, along with the expelled air.

==Disorders==
*Chest pain associated with burping can occur, but is rare.
*Retrograde cricopharyngeal dysfunction (R-CPD) or retrograde upper esophageal sphincter dysfunction (R-UESD), also called &quot;abelchia&quot;, involves the cricopharyngeus muscle not being able to relax, leading to inability to burp. R-CPD was first discovered in 2015. Common symptoms include gurgling noises, bloating, and flatulence; lesser but common symptoms can be potentially painful hiccups, nausea, constipation, hypersalivation, or shortness of breath. A high-resolution manometry, esophageal manometry or fluoroscopy by an ENT doctor is able to assess the issue. 80% of patients were successfully treated with botox after a single injection. If the injection is unsuccessful, an alternative is partial cricopharyngeal myotomy.

==Society and culture==
===Acceptance===
Some South Asian cultures view burping as acceptable in particular situations. For example, a burping guest can be a sign to the host that the meal satisfied them and they are full.

In Japan, burping during a meal is considered bad manners. Burping during a meal is also considered unacceptable in Western cultures, such as North America and Europe.

Despite virtually no scientific research on the subject, small online communities exist for burping as a sexual fetish. Online, people of any sexual orientation anecdotally report some attraction to burping, with what appears to be psychological and/or behavioural overlaps with other sexual fetishes including body inflation, feedism, vorarephilia, and farting fetishes. Anecdotally, the &#x27;loudness&#x27; aspect appears to be an important element to burp fetishists. Despite being a rather uncommon fetish, it continues to follow a general well-known pattern of sexual behaviour where hearing influences sexual arousal and response, noting that &quot;it is the noise made rather than the action itself that appears to be what is sexualized and/or interpreted by the fetishist as sexually pleasurable and arousing&quot;.

===Infants===

Babies are likely to accumulate gas in the stomach while feeding and experience considerable discomfort (and agitation) until assisted. Burping an infant involves placing the child in a position conducive to gas expulsion (for example against the adult&#x27;s shoulder, with the infant&#x27;s stomach resting on the adult&#x27;s chest) and then lightly patting the lower back. Because burping can cause vomiting, a &quot;burp cloth&quot; or &quot;burp pad&quot; is sometimes employed on the shoulder to protect clothing.

===World record===
The Guinness World Record for the loudest burp was 112.4 dB, set by Neville Sharp from Darwin, Australia in 2021. This is approximately as loud as a jet engine at . The record was previously held by Paul Hunn, who held the record for 12 years.

===Burped speech===
It is possible to voluntarily induce burping through swallowing air and then expelling it, and by manipulation of the vocal tract produce burped speech.

While this is often employed as a means of entertainment or competition, it can also act as an alternative means of vocalisation for people who have undergone a laryngectomy, with the burp replacing laryngeal phonation. This is known as esophageal speech.

==Other animals==
Many other mammals, such as cows, dogs and sheep, also burp.

===Ruminants===
Much of the gas expelled is produced as a byproduct of the ruminant&#x27;s digestive process. These gases notably include a large volume of methane, produced exclusively by a narrow cohort of methanogenic archaea in the animal&#x27;s gut; &quot;Escherichia coli&quot; (&quot;E. coli&quot;) and other bacteria lack the enzymes and cofactors required for methane production. A lactating cow produces about 322g of methane per day, &quot;i.e.&quot; more than 117 kg per year through burping and exhalation, making commercially farmed cows a major (37%) contributor to anthropogenic methane emissions, and hence to the greenhouse effect. 95% of this gas (wind) is emitted through burping. This has led scientists at the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation of Perth, Australia, to develop an anti-methanogen vaccine to minimize methane in cow burps.

One reason why cows burp so much is that they are often fed foods that their digestive systems cannot fully process, such as corn and soy. Some farmers have reduced burping in their cows by feeding them alfalfa and flaxseed, which are closer to the grasses that they had eaten in the wild before they were domesticated.

===Birds===
There is no documented evidence that birds burp, though ornithologists believe that there is nothing which physiologically prevents them from doing so. However, since the microbiota of birds do not include the same set of gas-producing bacteria that mammals have to aid in digestion, gas hardly builds up in the gastrointestinal tracts of birds.

<doc id="922380" wikidata="Q1472065" url="?curid=922380" title="Laryngectomy">
<text>Laryngectomy is the removal of the larynx. In a total laryngectomy, the entire larynx is removed (including the vocal folds, hyoid bone, epiglottis, thyroid and cricoid cartilage and a few tracheal cartilage rings) with the separation of the airway from the mouth, nose and esophagus. In a partial laryngectomy, only a portion of the larynx is removed. Following the procedure, the person breathes through an opening in the neck known as a stoma. This procedure is usually performed by an ENT surgeon in cases of laryngeal cancer. Many cases of laryngeal cancer are treated with more conservative methods (surgeries through the mouth, radiation and/or chemotherapy). A laryngectomy is performed when these treatments fail to conserve the larynx or when the cancer has progressed such that normal functioning would be prevented. Laryngectomies are also performed on individuals with other types of head and neck cancer. Less invasive partial laryngectomies, including tracheal shaves and feminization laryngoplasty may also be performed on transgender women and other female or non-binary identified individuals to feminize the larynx and/or voice. Post-laryngectomy rehabilitation includes voice restoration, oral feeding and more recently, smell and taste rehabilitation. An individual&#x27;s quality of life can be affected post-surgery. People who are laryngectomized are vocal amputees.

==History==

The first total laryngectomy was performed in 1873 by Theodor Billroth. The patient was a thirty-six-year-old man with a subglottic squamous cell carcinoma. On November 27, 1873, Billroth performed a partial laryngectomy. Subsequent laryngoscopic examination in mid-December 1873 found tumor recurrence. On December 31, 1873, Billroth performed the first total laryngectomy. The patient was discharged four months later after he learned to use the artificial larynx, which enabled him to speak despite the removal of his vocal cords. Unfortunately, the patient developed a recurrence of the lesion, accompanied by metastatic nodes, and passed away a year following the surgery.

Older references credit a Patrick Watson of Edinburgh with the first laryngectomy in 1866,
but this patient&#x27;s larynx was only excised after death.

The first artificial larynx was constructed by Johann Nepomuk Czermak in 1869. Vincenz Czerny developed an artificial larynx which he tested in dogs in 1870.

Following the pioneering efforts of Billroth, the practice of total laryngectomy gained momentum among surgeons. The early attempts at this procedure, including the second ever performed by Bernhard Heine in 1874 and subsequent operations by Hermann Maas and others, often resulted in the patient&#x27;s death due to complications or recurrence of disease within months. It wasn&#x27;t until Enrico Bottini in Italy achieved the first long-term survival of a laryngectomy patient that the potential for lasting success was realized. The period also saw notable failures and challenges, including the tragic case of Crown Prince Frederick of Germany (the future Frederick III). Misdiagnosed initially in 1887 by Morell Mackenzie as benign, Frederick&#x27;s condition was later identified as cancerous, leading to his death after a tracheostomy. This case highlighted the controversies and difficulties in diagnosing and treating laryngeal cancer, which persisted into the early 20th century.

Advancements in direct laryngoscopy and suspension laryngoscopy, credited to Killian and Lynch respectively, improved the evaluation and surgical management of the larynx. Despite significant challenges such as wound infection, anesthesia, and shock, pioneers like George Washington Crile—which performed the first laryngectomy in U.S. in 1892—made significant contributions to reducing operative mortality and advancing techniques in neck surgery and the management of metastatic disease.

==Incidence and prevalence==

According to the GLOBOCAN, 2,018 estimates of cancer incidence and mortality produced by the International Agency for Research on Cancer, there were 177,422 new cases of laryngeal cancer worldwide in 2018 (1.0% of the global total.) Among worldwide cancer deaths, 94,771 (1.0%) were due to laryngeal cancer.
In 2019, it is estimated that there will be 12,410 new laryngeal cancer cases in the United States, (3.0 per 100,000). The number of new cases decreases every year at a rate of 2.4%, and this is believed to be related to decreased cigarette smoking in the general population. The number of laryngectomies performed each year in the U.S. has been declining at an even faster rate due to the development of less invasive techniques. A study using the National Inpatient Sample found that there were 8,288 total laryngectomy cases performed in the US between 1998 and 2008, and that hospitals performing total laryngectomy decreased by 12.3 per year. As of 2013, one reference estimates that there are 50,000 to 60,000 laryngectomees in the US.

== Identification ==
To determine the severity/spread of the laryngeal cancer and the level of vocal fold function, indirect laryngoscopies using mirrors, endoscopies (rigid or flexible) and/or stroboscopies may be performed. Other methods of visualization using CT scans, MRIs and PET scans and investigations of the cancer through biopsy can also be completed. Acoustic observations can also be utilized, where certain laryngeal cancer locations (e.g. at the level of the glottis) can cause an individual&#x27;s voice to sound hoarse.

Examinations are used to determine the tumor classification (TNM classification) and the stage (1–4) of the tumor. The increasing classifications from T1 to T4 indicates the spread/size of the tumor and provides information on which surgical intervention is recommended, where T1-T3 (smaller tumors) may require partial laryngectomies and T4 (larger tumors) may require complete laryngectomies. Radiation and/or chemotherapy may also be used.

==The airways and ventilation after laryngectomy==

The anatomy and physiology of the airways change after laryngectomy. After a total laryngectomy, the individual breathes through a stoma where the tracheostomy has created an opening in the neck. There is no longer a connection between the trachea and the mouth and nose. After a partial laryngectomy, the individual breathes mainly through the stoma, but a connection still exists between the trachea and upper airways such that these individuals are able to breathe air through the mouth and nose. The extent of breathing through the upper airways in these individuals varies and a tracheostomy tube is present in many of them. Ventilation and resuscitation of total and partial neck breathers is performed through the stoma. However, for these individuals, the mouth should be kept closed and the nose should be sealed to prevent air escape during resuscitation.

== Complications ==
Different types of complications can follow total laryngectomy. The most frequent postoperative complication is pharyngocutaneous fistula (PCF), characterized by an abnormal opening between the pharynx and the trachea or the skin resulting in the leaking of saliva outside of the throat. This complication, which requires feeding to be completed via nasogastric tube, increases morbidity, length of hospitalization, and level of discomfort, and may delay rehabilitation. Up to 29% of persons who undergo total laryngectomy will be affected by PCF. Various factors have been associated with an increased risk of experiencing this type of complication. These factors include anaemia, hypoalbuminaemia, poor nutrition, hepatic and renal dysfunction, preoperative tracheostomy, smoking, alcohol use, older age, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and localization and stage of cancer. However, the installation of a free-flap has been shown to significantly reduce the risks of PCF. Other complications such as wound infection, dehiscence and necrosis, bleeding, pharyngeal and stomal stenosis, and dysphagia have also been reported in fewer cases.

==Rehabilitation==

=== Voice restoration ===
Total laryngectomy results in the removal of the larynx, an organ essential for natural sound production. The loss of voice and of normal and efficient verbal communication is a negative consequence associated with this type of surgery and can have significant impacts on the quality of life of these individuals. Voice rehabilitation is an important component of the recovery process following the surgery. Technological and scientific advances over the years have led to the development of different techniques and devices specialized in voice restoration.

The desired method of voice restoration should be selected based on each individual&#x27;s abilities, needs, and lifestyle. Factors that affect success and candidacy for any chosen voice restoration method could include: cognitive ability, individual physiology, motivation, physical ability, and pre-existing medical conditions.

Pre and post-operative sessions with a speech-language pathologist (SLP) are often part of the treatment plan for people undergoing a total laryngectomy. Pre-operative sessions would likely involve counselling on the function of the larynx, the options for post-op voice restoration, and managing expectations for outcomes and rehabilitation. Post-operative therapy sessions with an SLP would aim to help individuals learn to vocalize and care for their new voice prosthesis as well as refine their use of speech depending on the chosen method of voice restoration.

Available methods for voice restoration:
* For tracheoesophageal speech, a voice prosthesis is placed in the tracheo-oesophageal puncture (TEP) created by the surgeon. The voice prosthesis is a one-way air valve that allows air to pass from the lungs/trachea to the esophagus when the stoma is covered, where the redirected air vibrates the esophageal tissue to produce a hoarse voice. The TEP and voice prosthesis combination allows individuals post-laryngectomy to have a voice to speak, while also avoiding aspiration of saliva, food or other liquids. Tracheoesophageal speech is considered more natural sounding than esophageal speech, but voice quality differs from person to person.
* For speech using an electrolarynx, an electrolarynx is an external device that is placed against the neck and creates vibration that the speaker then articulates. The sound has been characterized as mechanical and robotic.
* For esophageal speech, the speaker pushes air into the esophagus and then pushes it back up, articulating speech sounds to speak. This method is time-consuming and difficult to learn and is less frequently used by laryngectomees.
* For larynx transplants, a larynx from a cadaver donor is used as a replacement. This option is the most recent and is still very rare.
For individuals using tracheoesophageal or esophageal speech, botulinum toxin may be injected to improve voice quality when spasms or increased tone (hypertonicity) is present at the level of the pharyngoesophageal segment muscles. The amount of botulinum toxin administered unilaterally into two or three sites along the pharyngoesophageal segment varies from 15 to 100 units per injection. Positive voice improvements are possible after a single injection, however outcomes are variable. Dosages may need to be re-administered (individual-dependent) after a number of months, where effective results are expected to last for about 6 to 9 months.

=== Oral feeding ===
The laryngectomy surgery results in anatomical and physiological changes in the larynx and surrounding structures. Consequently, swallowing function can undergo changes as well, compromising the patient&#x27;s oral feeding ability and nutrition. Patients may experience distress, frustration, and reluctance to eat out due to swallowing difficulties. Despite the high prevalence of post-operative swallowing difficulties in the first days following the laryngectomy, most patients recover swallowing function within 3 months. Laryngectomy patients do not aspirate due to the structural changes in the larynx, but they may experience difficulty swallowing solid food. They may also experience changes in appetite due to a significant loss in their senses of taste and smell.

In order to prevent the development of pharyngocutaneous fistula, it is common practice to reintroduce oral feeding as of the seventh to tenth day post-surgery, although the ideal timeline remains controversial. Pharyngocutaneous fistula typically develops before the reintroduction of oral feeding, as the pH level and presence of amylase in saliva is more harmful to tissues than other liquids or food. Whether the reintroduction of oral feeding at an earlier post-operative date decreases the risk of fistula remains unclear. However, early oral feeding (within 7 days of the operation) can be conducive to reduced length of hospital stay and earlier discharge from the hospital, entailing a decrease in costs and psychological distress.

=== Smell and taste rehabilitation ===
A total laryngectomy causes the separation of the upper air respiratory tract (pharyn), nose, mouth) and lower air respiratory tract (lungs, lower trachea). Breathing is no longer done through the nose (nasal airflow), which causes a loss/decrease of the sense of smell, leading to a decrease in the sense of taste. The Nasal Airflow Inducing Manoeuvre (NAIM), also known as the &quot;Polite Yawning&quot; manoeuvre, was created in 2000 and is widely accepted and used by speech-language pathologists in the Netherlands, while also becoming more widely used in Europe. This technique consists of increasing the space in the oral cavity while keeping the lips closed, simulating a yawn with a closed mouth by lowering the jaw, tongue and floor of the mouth. This causes a negative pressure in the oral cavity, leading to nasal airflow. The NAIM has been recognized as an effective rehabilitation technique to improve the sense of smell.

== Quality of life ==
People with a partial laryngectomy are more likely to have a higher quality of life than individuals with a total laryngectomy. People having undergone total laryngectomy have been found to be more prone to depression and anxiety, and often experience a decrease in the quality of their social life and physical health.

Voice quality, swallowing and reflux are affected in both types, with the sense of smell and taste (hyposmia/anosmia and dysgeusia) also being affected in total laryngectomies (a complaint which is given very little attention by medical professionals). Partial or total laryngectomy can lead to swallowing difficulties (known as &quot;dysphagia&quot;). Dysphagia can have a significant effect on some patients&#x27; quality of life following surgery. Dysphagia poses challenges in eating and social involvement, often causing patients to experience increased levels of distress. This effect holds true even after the acute phase of recovery. More than half of patients who received total laryngectomy were found to experience restrictions in their food intake, specifically in what they can eat and how they can eat it. The diet limitations imposed by dysphagia can negatively impact a patient&#x27;s quality of life, as it can be perceived as a form of participation restriction. Accordingly, these perceived restrictions are more commonly experienced by dysphasic laryngectomy patients compared to non-dysphasic laryngectomy patients. Therefore, it is important to consider dysphagia in short and long-term outcomes post-laryngectomy in order for patients to uphold a higher quality of life. Often, speech-language pathologists are involved in the process of prioritizing swallowing outcomes.

People receiving voice rehabilitation report best voice quality and overall quality of life when using a voice prosthesis as compared to esophageal speech or electrolarynx. Furthermore, individuals going through non-surgical therapy report a higher quality of life than those having undergone a total laryngectomy. Lastly, it is much more difficult for those using alaryngeal speech to vary their pitch, which particularly affects the social functioning of those speaking a tonal language.

<doc id="922382" wikidata="Q909569" url="?curid=922382" title="Smith–Volterra–Cantor set">
<text>In mathematics, the Smith–Volterra–Cantor set (SVC), ε-Cantor set, or fat Cantor set is an example of a set of points on the real line that is nowhere dense (in particular it contains no intervals), yet has positive measure. The Smith–Volterra–Cantor set is named after the mathematicians Henry Smith, Vito Volterra and Georg Cantor. In an 1875 paper, Smith discussed a nowhere-dense set of positive measure on the real line, and Volterra introduced a similar example in 1881. The Cantor set as we know it today followed in 1883. The Smith–Volterra–Cantor set is topologically equivalent to the middle-thirds Cantor set.

==Construction==

Similar to the construction of the Cantor set, the Smith–Volterra–Cantor set is constructed by removing certain intervals from the unit interval formula_1 

The process begins by removing the middle 1/4 from the interval formula_2 (the same as removing 1/8 on either side of the middle point at 1/2) so the remaining set is 
formula_3

The following steps consist of removing subintervals of width formula_4 from the middle of each of the formula_5 remaining intervals. So for the second step the intervals formula_6 and formula_7 are removed, leaving 
formula_8

Continuing indefinitely with this removal, the Smith–Volterra–Cantor set is then the set of points that are never removed. The image below shows the initial set and five iterations of this process. 

Each subsequent iterate in the Smith–Volterra–Cantor set&#x27;s construction removes proportionally less from the remaining intervals. This stands in contrast to the Cantor set, where the proportion removed from each interval remains constant. Thus, the Smith–Volterra–Cantor set has positive measure while the Cantor set has zero measure.

==Properties==

By construction, the Smith–Volterra–Cantor set contains no intervals and therefore has empty interior. It is also the intersection of a sequence of closed sets, which means that it is closed.
During the process, intervals of total length 
formula_9 
are removed from formula_10 showing that the set of the remaining points has a positive measure of 1/2. This makes the Smith–Volterra–Cantor set an example of a closed set whose boundary has positive Lebesgue measure.

== Other fat Cantor sets ==

In general, one can remove formula_11 from each remaining subinterval at the formula_12th step of the algorithm, and end up with a Cantor-like set. The resulting set will have positive measure if and only if the sum of the sequence is less than the measure of the initial interval. For instance, suppose the middle intervals of length formula_13 are removed from formula_2 for each formula_12th iteration, for some formula_16 Then, the resulting set has Lebesgue measure 
formula_17
which goes from formula_18 to formula_19 as formula_20 goes from formula_21 to formula_22 (formula_23 is impossible in this construction.)

Cartesian products of Smith–Volterra–Cantor sets can be used to find totally disconnected sets in higher dimensions with nonzero measure. By applying the Denjoy–Riesz theorem to a two-dimensional set of this type, it is possible to find an Osgood curve, a Jordan curve such that the points on the curve have positive area.

<text>Lu You (; 1125–1210) was a Chinese historian and poet of the Southern Song Dynasty (南宋).

==Career==
===Early life and marriage===
Lu You was born on a boat floating in the Wei River early on a rainy morning, November 13, 1125. At the time of his birth, China was divided and the Song dynasty in the northern part of the country had been invaded by the Jurchens of the Jin dynasty in the Jin–Song wars. The southern part of China continued to hold out as the Southern Song dynasty for another 150 years, but during Lu You&#x27;s entire life, the country was threatened by invasion from the north. He is known for his many patriotic poems.

One year after his birth, the troops of the Jin dynasty conquered the capital of the Northern Song dynasty; his family fled to the south. Lu You&#x27;s family included government officials, and he received a good education. He was brought up to be patriotic, and grew up determined to expel the foreign Jurchen from the North and bring about the reunification of China under the Song dynasty.

Lu You grew up with his cousin Tang Wan (唐琬, courtesy name Huixian 蕙仙, 1128-1156), who was quiet but loved literature. They fell deeply in love and were married when he was 20. But they had no children, and his mother did not like Tang Wan. Though they had lived happily together, his mother forced them to divorce in order to make Lu You concentrate on studying to fulfill his aspiration of saving the Song dynasty. In traditional Chinese culture, children were required to obey their parents. Lu You loved his mother and reluctantly divorced Tang Wan. She later married a nobleman named Zhao Shicheng (趙士程), and he married a woman from the Wang clan (her personal name eludes most researchers).

Lu You was sad after his first marriage broke up. One spring day, at age 31, eight years after their divorce, he passed by Shen&#x27;s Garden (沈園) and by chance encountered Tang Wan and her husband. Tang Wan asked her husband to let her send a cup of wine to Lu You. When her hands passed the wine to him, he saw her eyes brimmed with tears. His heart was broken, and he drank the cup of bitter wine to the bottom. He turned away and on the spot wrote the poem &quot;Phoenix Hairpin&quot; (Chai Tou Feng, 釵頭鳳) on the wall of Shen&#x27;s Garden. After this meeting with Tang Wan, Lu You went to the North to struggle against the foreign Jin dynasty, before returning to southern Shu (蜀, today&#x27;s Sichuan) to pursue his dream of unifying China.

When Tang Wan read Lu You&#x27;s poem in the garden, she immediately wrote one in the same form in response. Less than a year later, she died. In the year before Lu You&#x27;s death, at age 85, he wrote another poem called “Shen&#x27;s Garden” to commemorate Tang Wan, his first love. A traditional Yue opera was written about Lu You and Tang Wan, and their love story is very famous in China.

===Official career===

At age 12, Lu You was already an excellent writer, had mastered the skill of sword fighting, and had delved deeply into war strategy. At age 19, he took the civil service examination, but did not pass. Ten years later, he took it again; this time he not only passed it, he was the first winner in the Lin An region. But this triumph brought him trouble. Qin Sun, the grandson of the powerful Qin Hui (秦檜, a notorious aristocratic traitor in the Song Dynasty), had also taken the exam. Lu You&#x27;s win threatened Qin Sun&#x27;s position, as Lu You was now likely to take first place in the next year&#x27;s national examination. In fact, not only Lu You, but all the potential winners of the next year&#x27;s nationwide competition were excluded, along with even some of the examination officers.

After Qin Hui&#x27;s death, Lu You started his official career in government. Because he avidly insisted on fighting against the Jin dynasty and did not follow the mainstream official lethargy on the subject, he was dismissed from his job. In 1172, he was hired to do strategic planning in the military. Military life opened his eyes and mind; he hoped to fulfill his aspiration of bringing a divided China back together. He wrote many unrestrained poems to express his passionate patriotism. But the Song Dynasty was by now corrupt and indolent; most officers just wanted to make a nice living; Lu You had no opportunity to deploy his talent.&quot;Entering upon a public career by virtue of his father&#x27;s services, he fell into disfavour with Qin Hui; but after the latter&#x27;s death he received an appointment, and in 1163 the Emperor Xiaozong(孝宗) made him a Compiler for the Privy Council and conferred upon him the honorary degree of Jinshi(進士).&quot;

He was unsuccessful in his official career: he adopted a patriotic irredentist stance, advocating the expulsion of the Jurchen from northern China, but this position was out of tune with the times. In 1175, Fan Chengda(范成大) asked him to join his party. They shared literary interests, and now behaved casually in official society. Lu You felt there was no place for him in official life, and started to become self-indulgent, enjoying drinking to forget his lack of success in his personal life and career pursuit. He gave himself the art name &quot;Fangweng&quot; (放翁), meaning &quot;Liberated Old Man&quot;, and was sarcastic about himself in his poems.

After several promotions and demotions, Lu You retired in 1190 to live in seclusion in his hometown Shaoxing (紹興, now in Zhejiang province), then a rural area. He spent the last twenty years of his life there. Lu You enjoyed good health and liked eating pearl barley and wood ear mushrooms. This habit kept his vision and hearing keen until death. During his retirement, he still ardently supported fighting against the Jin dynasty, but without success. His wife died in 1197. On January 26, 1210, he died at age 86. His great regret was knowing that northern China was still in the control of the foreigners.

==Style==
Lu You wrote about eleven thousand poems, in both the &quot;shi&quot; (詩) and &quot;ci&quot; (詞) forms, plus a number of prose works, which made him the poet who ranks the top in the list of numbers of the poems left before 15C. In his poetry he continues to articulate the beliefs which cost him his official career, calling for reconquest of the north. Watson identifies these works as part of the legacy of Du Fu (杜甫). Watson compares a second body of work, poems on country life and growing old, to those of Bai Juyi (白居易) and Tao Qian (陶潛).

His style can be divided into three periods.

===First Period===
The first Period of Lu You&#x27;s works is from his teenage years to age 46. This period, although the longest, contains the fewest of his works, about two hundred poems, because he himself destroyed his early works in his later years.

===Second Period===
Second Period runs from age 46 to 54, including more than 2400 &quot;shi&quot; and &quot;ci&quot;. During this period, Lu You joined the military and was affected by that experience.

===Third Period===
The third Period runs from the time Lu You retired to his home town until his death. He did not have time to edit his work, and 6500 poems survive from this period. His work in this period includes peaceful pastoral images as well as desolation and bleakness.

Though his style changed throughout his life, his work is always full of patriotism. This is the most important feature of his poetry, and the major reason they have been valued for almost a thousand years.

===Books===
*《劍南詩稿》(Jian Nan Shi Gao, the draft of poems when holding a sword in the southern borders)
*《渭南文集》(Wei Nan Wen Ji, the collection of proses in the south of the Wei River)
*《放翁逸稿》(Fang Weng Yi Gao, the lost drafts of the Liberated Old Man)
* 《南唐書》(Nan Tang Shu, &quot;Book of Southern Tang&quot;)
*《老學庵筆記》(Lao Xue An Bi Ji, the notebook from the House of a Person Who Studies When He Is Old)
*《放翁家訓》(Fang Weng Jia Xun, family precepts from the Liberated Old Man)
*《家世舊文》(Jia Shi Jiu Wen, an old prose about the history of my family)

===Poems===

Lu You wrote many poems. One of his most famous is &quot;To My Son&quot; (示兒, Shi Er). This is how it goes:
* To My Son (示兒)

死去元知萬事空，
但悲不見九州同。
王師北定中原日，
家祭無忘告乃翁。

&quot;All turns to dust in my dying eyes,&quot;
&quot;only hatred is that a unified land is not seen.&quot;
&quot;When the day of the emperor&#x27;s troops sweeping the North comes,&quot;
&quot;you must not forget to tell me at my tombstone.&quot;

He composed this last poem when he was near death.

What this poem means is that he does not mind not being able to take anything with him when he dies, but he is upset to see that China is still not united as a nation. He is telling his son that if this day ever comes, his family must not forget to go to his grave and tell him there.

*Rainstorm on the Eleventh month 4th (十一月四日風雨大作)

僵臥孤邨不自哀，
尚思爲國戍輪台。
夜闌臥聽風吹雨，
鐵馬冰河入夢來。

&quot;I slept stiff and alone in a lonely village without feeling self-pity.&quot;
&quot;I am still thinking of fighting for my country.&quot;
&quot;Deep into the night I lie down and hear the wind blowing the rain.&quot;
&quot;The armored horses and the ice river came into my dream.&quot;

This poem was written when Lu was old and retired, but it shines with his patriotism and vivid depiction of the fighting scenes in the North.

* Phoenix Hairpin (釵頭鳳)

紅酥手，黃藤酒，
滿城春色宮墻柳。
東風惡，歡情薄，
一杯愁緒，幾年離索，錯，錯，錯。

萅如舊，人空瘦，
淚痕紅浥鮫綃透。 
桃花落，閒池閣， 
山盟雖在，錦書難托，莫，莫，莫。

&quot;Pink soft hands, yellow rippling wine,&quot;
&quot;The town is filled with Spring, willows by palace walls.&quot;
&quot;The east wind is biting, happiness is thin,&quot;
&quot;heart full of sorrow, so many years apart.&quot;

&quot;Wrong, Wrong, Wrong!&quot;

&quot;Spring is as of old; the person is empty and thin.&quot;
&quot;Traces of tears show through the sheer silk.&quot;
&quot;Peach blossoms falling, glimmering pond freezing,&quot;
&quot;The huge oath remains, the brocade book is hard to hold.&quot;

&quot;Don&#x27;t, Don&#x27;t, Don&#x27;t!&quot;

&quot;Note: The words &quot;wrong&quot; and &quot;don&#x27;t&quot; rhyme in Chinese.&quot;

This poem is about his real love story (see his marriage). In this poem, &quot;Biting east wind&quot; is a metaphor for traditional Chinese view about women. This view broke up his first marriage. &quot;Brocade book&quot;, or &quot;glorious/bright book,&quot; is another metaphor for his ambition of unifying China. But he doesn&#x27;t seem to be successful in either of them (marriage and career). He also uses antithesis, which is very popular in Chinese poetry. It matches both sound and sense in two poetic lines, like &quot;a heart of sorrow&quot; pairing with &quot;years apart&quot; and &quot;paramount promise&quot; pairing &quot;brocade book&quot;. The sounds match perfectly in Chinese. This poem falls in the first period of his works.

* Plum Blossom (卜算子-咏梅)

驛外斷橋邊
寂寞開無主
已是黃昏獨自愁
更著風和雨
無意苦爭春
一任群芳妒
零落成泥碾作塵
只有香如故

&quot;Near the broken bridge outside the fortress,&quot;
&quot;I go, lonely and disoriented.&quot;
&quot;It is dusk and I am alone and anxious,&quot;
&quot;especially when the wind and rain start to blow.&quot;
&quot;I do not mean to fight for Springtime,&quot;
&quot;I would rather be alone and envied by the crowd.&quot;
&quot;I will fall down, become earth, be crushed to dust.&quot;
&quot;My glory will be same as before.&quot;

<doc id="922392" wikidata="Q855740" url="?curid=922392" title="Rhizaria">
<text>The Rhizaria are a diverse and species-rich supergroup of mostly unicellular eukaryotes. Except for the Chlorarachniophytes and three species in the genus &quot;Paulinella&quot; in the phylum Cercozoa, they are all non-photosynthetic, but many Foraminifera and Radiolaria have a symbiotic relationship with unicellular algae. A multicellular form, &quot;Guttulinopsis vulgaris&quot;, a cellular slime mold, has been described. This group was used by Cavalier-Smith in 2002, although the term &quot;Rhizaria&quot; had been long used for clades within the currently recognized taxon.

Being described mainly from rDNA sequences, they vary considerably in form, having no clear morphological distinctive characters (synapomorphies), but for the most part they are amoeboids with , , or microtubule-supported pseudopods. In the absence of an apomorphy, the group is ill-defined, and its composition has been very fluid. Some Rhizaria possess mineral exoskeletons (thecae or loricas), which are in different clades within Rhizaria made out of opal (), celestite (), or calcite (). 

Certain species can attain sizes of more than a centimeter with some species being able to form cylindrical colonies approximately 1 cm in diameter and greater than 1 m in length. They feed by capturing and engulfing prey with the extensions of their pseudopodia; forms that are symbiotic with unicellular algae contribute significantly to the total primary production of the ocean.

==Groups==
The three main groups of Rhizaria are:

* Cercozoa – various amoebae and flagellates, usually with filose pseudopods and common in soil
* Foraminifera – amoeboids with reticulose pseudopods, common as marine benthos
* Radiolaria – amoeboids with axopods, common as marine plankton

A few other groups may be included in the Cercozoa, but some trees appear closer to the Foraminifera. These are the Phytomyxea and Ascetosporea, parasites of plants and animals, respectively, and the peculiar amoeba &quot;Gromia&quot;. The different groups of Rhizaria are considered close relatives based mainly on genetic similarities, and have been regarded as an extension of the Cercozoa. The name Rhizaria for the expanded group was introduced by Cavalier-Smith in 2002, who also included the centrohelids and Apusozoa.

A noteworthy order that belongs to Ascetosporea is the Mikrocytida. These are parasites of oysters. This includes the causative agent of Denman Island Disease, &quot;Mikrocytos mackini&quot; a small (2−3 μm diameter) amitochondriate protistan.

== History ==

Similarities between various Rhizaria organisms have been noticed since the 19th century. In his 1861 classification of the Rhizopoda (amoebae), the zoologist William B. Carpenter proposed the order Reticularia, which consisted of Foraminifera and Gromiida on the basis of their very similar thin, reticulose pseudopodia with granules circulating inside. However, the idea that these organisms and others such as Radiolaria were all related to one another emerged rather recently, with the help of molecular phylogenetics and advanced microscopy techniques in the late 20th century.

==Evolutionary relationships==
Rhizaria are part of the SAR supergroup (Stramenopiles, Alveolates, Rhizaria), a grouping that had been presaged in 1993 through a study of mitochondrial morphologies. SAR is currently placed in the Diaphoretickes along with Archaeplastida, Cryptista, Haptista, and several minor clades.

Historically, many rhizarians were considered animals because of their motility and heterotrophy. However, when a simple animal-plant dichotomy was superseded by a recognition of additional kingdoms, taxonomists generally placed amoebae in the kingdom Protista. When scientists began examining the evolutionary relationships among eukaryotes in the 1970s, it became clear that the kingdom Protista was paraphyletic. Rhizaria appear to share a common ancestor with Stramenopiles and Alveolates forming part of the SAR super assemblage. Rhizaria has been supported by molecular phylogenetic studies as a monophyletic group. Biosynthesis of 24-isopropyl cholestane precursors in various rhizaria suggests a relevant ecological role already during the Ediacaran.

===Phylogeny===

Rhizaria is a monophyletic group composed of two sister phyla: Cercozoa and Retaria. Subsequently, Cercozoa and Retaria are also monophyletic. The following cladogram depicts the evolutionary relationships between all rhizarian classes, and is made after the works of Cavalier-Smith &quot;et al.&quot; (2018), and Irwin &quot;et al.&quot; (2019).

==Sexual cycle==

Complete sexual life cycles have been demonstrated for two lineages (Foraminifera and &quot;Gromia&quot;) and direct evidence for karyogamy or meiosis has been observed in five lineages (&quot;Euglyphida&quot;, &quot;Thecofilosea&quot;, &quot;Chlorarachniophyta&quot;, &quot;Plasmodiophorida&quot; and &quot;Phaeodarea&quot;). In particular, the Foraminifera are marine amoebae that are defined by a dynamic network of pseudopodia, and the production of intricate shells. These amoeba have complex sexual life cycles with meiosis and gamete production occurring at separate stages.

<text>Annisquam is a waterfront village in the city of Gloucester in Essex County on the North Shore of Massachusetts, United States. It is a few miles across Cape Ann from downtown Gloucester.

==History==
The name &quot;Annisquam&quot; comes from an Algonquian term meaning &quot;top of the rock, containing &quot;&lt;wanashque&gt;&quot;, &quot;on top of&quot;, and &quot;&lt;-ompsk&gt;&quot;, &quot;rock&quot;. The first European settlement in Annisquam was established in 1631. In the late 19th-century, it was home to both granite quarrying and an artist colony, which attracted painters including George Loftus Noyes and Margaret Fitzhugh Browne. The colony came to be known as &quot;Squam&quot; in the 1890s, with William Lamb Picknell, Emil Carlsen, and Robert Vonnoh in residence and producing numerous works inspired by the seascape.

Annisquam is primarily a residential village. Its only businesses include a restaurant and marina, a small hotel, a real estate company, a library and the Annisquam Yacht Club, founded in 1896. Because of its small size, historic architecture and secluded geography, Annisquam remains a popular summer resort.

At the mouth of the Annisquam River on Ipswich Bay is Annisquam Harbor Light, perhaps the village&#x27;s most historic edifice. The lighthouse has been in the same spot since 1801, having undergone significant repairs in 1850.

&quot;The Good Son&quot;, a 1993 movie starring Macaulay Culkin, was partly filmed here.

Marilyn Monroe is said to have secretly vacationed here, renting a cottage on Lobster Cove at which she was visited by John F. Kennedy, who was introduced to the area by his Harvard University roommate Benjamin A Smith II.{

<text>Lu Yu (; 733–804) or Lu Ji (陆疾), courtesy name Jici (季疵) was a Chinese tea master and writer. He is respected as the Sage of Tea for his contribution to Chinese tea culture. He is best known for his monumental book &quot;The Classic of Tea,&quot; also known as &quot;Cha Ching/Cha Jing&quot; (simplified Chinese: 茶经), the first definitive work on cultivating, making and drinking tea.

==Biography==
Lu Yu was born in 733 in Tianmen, Hubei. For six years, Lu Yu stayed in Huomen mountain studying under the guidance of master Zou Fuzi. During this period, Lu Yu often brewed tea for his teacher. He also took care of fellow students&#x27; health using his remarkable knowledge in tea and herbs that he learned while at the Longgai Monastery.

Whenever time permitted between his studies Lu Yu often went to the countryside to gather tea leaves and herbs. In one of those trips Lu Yu stumbled upon a spring underneath a 6-foot round rock and the water from the spring was extremely clear and clean. When Lu Yu brewed tea with this spring water, he found the tea tasted unexpectedly better than usual. From then on, Lu Yu realised the importance of quality water in brewing tea.

Zou Fuzi was moved by Lu Yu&#x27;s obsession with tea and his skill in brewing good tea. He cleared the rock together with some of his students and dug a well around the fountainhead of that spring.

In 1768, just over a thousand years later during the Qing dynasty (1616–1911), Jingling was hit by drought and the whole city was badly in need of water. City folks found water still flowing from this well uncovered by Lu Yu and dug by Zou Fuzi. A Qing official ordered three wells to be dug around the spring and a structure constructed near the wells named &quot;Lu Yu Hut&quot; and the &quot;Literary Spring&quot;.

In 752 Lu Yu concluded his studies, bade farewell to his Shifu (teacher) Zou Fuzi (邹夫子) and returned to Jingling to meet his benefactor Li Qiwu (李齐物). However, a year earlier Li Qiwu was reinstated and returned to the Tang capital Chang&#x27;an. The new Chief Official of Jingling now was Cui Guofu (崔国辅). Cui, a senior official who held a position similar to an Education Minister of today, was demoted to Jingling as a Chief Official for offending a member of the royalty.

Cui Guofu was a scholar and poet well known for his magnificent 5 characters per verse short poem. After his demotion to Jingling, Cui Guofu took life fairly easy. Even though Cui was many years older than Lu Yu, both men shared the same interest in tea, literature, and poetry. As such they became good friends soon after they met. During this period, Lu Yu stayed with Cui Guofu and assisted him in his administrative tasks. The two spent much time traveling, drinking tea, and writing poems, and they co-authored several books on poems.

This period with Cui Guofu was the growing phase for Lu Yu as a man of letters; an incubation period for Lu Yu to practise and sharpen what he learned from Zou Fuzi. Cui Guofu, with his vast experience and skill in literary work, became a coach that provided the necessary guidance to enhance and mature Lu Yu&#x27;s writing and literary skills. During this time he wrote &quot;The Classic of Tea&quot;.

The original version of &quot;The Classic of Tea&quot; consisted of 3 books totaling 10 chapters: book 1 consisted of the first 3 chapters; book 2 consisted of chapter 4 only; book 3 consisted of chapters 5 to 10. After the Tang dynasty all three books were bound into a single volume, and the three-volume version was no longer available.

== Lu Yu in &quot;New Book of Tang&quot; ==
The &quot;New Book of Tang&quot; is the historical record of the Tang dynasty (618–907) by scholars in the Song dynasty (960–1279). A chapter in the New Book of Tang is Lu Yu&#x27;s biography. The book recorded Lu Yu&#x27;s obsession with tea, and he wrote a three-volume book &quot;Ch&#x27;a Ching&quot; about details of tea&#x27;s origin, the method of cultivating and drinking tea, and the tools of tea drinking. The tea sellers of that time would make pottery statues of Lu Yu and worship him as the &quot;tea god.&quot;

The new imperial supervisor Li Jiqing (李季卿) supervised the southeastern region of the Tang dynasty. Li Jiqing knew there were two masters of brewing tea, Chang Boxiong (常伯熊) and Lu Yu. When Li Jiqing visited Chang Boxiong, Li respected Chang by raising the teacup several times. When Li Jiqing visited Lu Yu, Lu was in a costume of villagers, so Li did not salute Lu. Lu Yu considered that as shame and wrote &quot;Hui Chalun&quot; (毁茶论), a book about behaviors that could ruin tea culture. After &quot;Ch&#x27;a Ching&quot; and &quot;Hui Chalun&quot;, drinking tea became popular in the Tang dynasty.

<doc id="922430" wikidata="Q418762" url="?curid=922430" title="Akira Kamiya">
<text>is a Japanese voice actor. He played several notable roles in Japanese manga and anime television series, including Kenshiro in &quot;Fist of the North Star&quot;, Ryo Saeba in &quot;City Hunter&quot;, Shutaro Mendo in &quot;Urusei Yatsura&quot; and Kogoro Mori (first voice, 1996-2009) in &quot;Detective Conan&quot;. In mecha anime, he voiced Ryoma Nagare in &quot;Getter Robo&quot;, Akira Hibiki in &quot;Brave Raideen&quot;, Sanshirō Tsuwabuki in &quot;Gaiking&quot;, Roy Focker in &quot;The Super Dimension Fortress Macross&quot;, and Sincline in &quot;Beast King GoLion&quot;

== Biography ==

=== Early life ===
Kamiya was born in Yokohama. He graduated from Tokyo Metropolitan Shiba Commercial High School and became a freelancer after being affiliated with Theatre Echo, Aoni Production, Production Baobab, Tokyo Actor&#x27;s Consumer&#x27;s Cooperative Society and Ups. Kamiya then founded Saeba Shoji, a talent agency.

=== Background ===
His father ran a furniture manufacturing factory, but it suddenly closed and his parents divorced. After that, Kamiya&#x27;s mother raised him and his brother. As a result of his mother&#x27;s search for work, he attended many schools over the years, from Aoki Elementary School in Yokohama to Higashidai Elementary School in Tsurumi and Aioi elementary school in Ota-ku, Tokyo. The presence of actor Shoichi Ozawa as the eldest of Aioi Ko led Kamiya on the road to drama.

After that, he entered the Tokyo Metropolitan Tateshiba Commercial High School via Misono Junior High School. Kamiya&#x27;s friend invited him to join the drama club, saying that, &quot;I think Kamiya has a good voice.&quot; At that time, it was more difficult to become an actor than previously and difficult to advance in the field. Kamiya told his mother, &quot;I want to be an actor. I will do my best because it is the path I chose myself.&quot; Later, he recalled, &quot;If [I] were [my] mother, [I] might have stopped crying.&quot; After graduating from high school, he joined the amateur theater company Kanza in Yokohama.

=== Activities as a voice actor ===
In 1970, Kamiya debuted as an anime voice actor playing the role of Senkichi in the TV anime &quot;Mahō no Mako-chan&quot; during the Theatre Echo study period. The first regular role was Sasuke Yashima in &quot;Akakichi no Eleven&quot;. He appeared as Koichi Furumi in &quot;Babel II&quot;, and also learned his trademark &quot;scream&quot; with this work. Since then, he has been in charge of several prominent roles chiefly in robot animation works, such as Ryoma Nagare in &quot;Getter Robo&quot;. He was called &quot;Screaming Kamiya&quot; because he kept screaming his special moves. One of the notable voice actors in the &quot;Super Robot Wars&quot; video game series, Kamiya himself appeared on TV commercials when &quot;Super Robot Wars F&quot; was released.

In the 1980s, he appeared in several animated manga series serialised in &quot;Weekly Shōnen Jump&quot;. He appeared in &quot;Kinnikuman&quot;, &quot;Fist of the North Star&quot;, and &quot;City Hunter&quot;, and was also known as one of the voice actors familiar with Jump anime. Since many of these &quot;Shōnen Jump&quot; anime have become long-running series, the works that appeared during this time are often introduced as Akira Kamiya&#x27;s masterpiece.

He often narrates commercials and variety shows, including the hero show commercial of Tokyo Dome City Attractions (former Korakuen Yuenchi), which is primarily broadcast on the &quot;Super Sentai&quot; series frame, and has been in charge of narration for over 20 years since 1986.

He became the recipient of Animage&#x27;s Grand Prix prize.

On January 9, 2017, the program was broadcast on TV Asahi and was ranked 22nd in &quot;200 Popular Voice Actors Seriously Selected! Voice Actor General Election! 3 Hours SP&quot;.

=== Other activities ===
Kamiya was initially a bass player with the popular voice actor&#x27;s musical group Slapstick, which was active in the 1970s and 1980s. However, he expressed his concern that his schedule was busy, and the performance activities he had enjoyed as an amateur band in a harmonious manner would be produced as professional singer activities, and he offered to withdraw.

He has worked as a radio personality for All Night Nippon. He is the first regular personality as a voice actor. In the same program, he made a corner called &quot;Guinness!&quot;. He knew what he was doing at MBS Young Town, and he still has friends.

In 1979, he played personality with Mitsuko Horie on a Sunday afternoon radio program called &quot;Mitsuko and Akira&#x27;s Deadly Handgun,&quot; and released a duet single, &quot;Oh! Sunday Youth is Sunday.&quot;

In addition to working as a singer in &quot;Purin Purin Monogatari&quot; and &quot;Fist of the North Star&quot;, he also performed in the early 1980s with Kazuyuki Sogabe, Ryūsei Nakao and Naoya Uchida.

In the aftermath of the Great Hanshin-Awaji Earthquake in 1995, he formed a charity unit &quot;WITH YOU&quot;. He was also active in the Fureai Concert.

<text>Implosive consonants are a group of stop consonants (and possibly also some affricates) with a mixed glottalic ingressive and pulmonic egressive airstream mechanism. That is, the airstream is controlled by moving the glottis downward in addition to expelling air from the lungs. Therefore, unlike the purely glottalic ejective consonants, implosives can be modified by phonation. Contrastive implosives are found in approximately 13% of the world&#x27;s languages.

In the International Phonetic Alphabet, implosives are indicated by modifying the top of a letter (voiced stop) with a rightward-facing hook: .

==Articulation==
During the occlusion of the stop, pulling the glottis downward rarefies the air in the vocal tract. The stop is then released. In languages whose implosives are particularly salient, that may result in air rushing into the mouth before it flows out again with the next vowel. To take in air sharply in that way is to implode a sound.

However, probably more typically, there is no movement of air at all, which contrasts with the burst of the pulmonary plosives. This is the case with many of the Kru languages, for example. That means that implosives are phonetically sonorants (not obstruents) as the concept of sonorant is usually defined. However, implosives can phonologically pattern as both; that is, they may be phonological sonorants or obstruents depending on the language.

George N. Clements (2002) actually proposes that implosives are phonologically neither obstruents nor sonorants.

The vast majority of implosive consonants are voiced, so the glottis is only partially closed. Because the airflow required for voicing reduces the vacuum being created in the mouth, implosives are easiest to make with a large oral cavity.

==Types==
Implosives are most often voiced stops, occasionally voiceless stops. Individual tokens of glottalized sonorants (nasals, trills, laterals, etc.) may also be pronounced with a lowering of the glottis by some individuals, occasionally to the extent that they are noticeably implosive, but no language is known where implosion is a general characteristic of such sounds.

===Voiced implosives===
The attested voiced implosive stops are the following:

*voiced bilabial implosive 
*voiced alveolar implosive 
*voiced retroflex implosive (letter is &#x27;implicit&#x27; in the IPA)
*voiced palatal implosive 
*voiced velar implosive 
*voiced uvular implosive 
*voiced labial–velar implosive 

There are no IPA symbols for implosive fricatives, and no confirmed cases of implosive fricatives or affricates. Implosive affricates are occasionally reported, but further investigation typically reveals that such sounds are either stops or not implosive. For example, the Swahili &quot;j&quot; has an implosive allophone, but the distinction is pulmonic affricate vs implosive stop . Similarly, implosive has been reported from Roglai, but it has also been analyzed as , and the implosive affricates reported from Gitxsan turn out to be lenis ejectives that are sometimes perceived as voiced.

===Voiceless implosives===
Consonants variously called &quot;voiceless implosives,&quot; &quot;implosives with glottal closure,&quot; or &quot;reverse ejectives&quot; involve a slightly different airstream mechanism, purely glottalic ingressive. The glottis is closed so no pulmonic airstream is possible. The IPA once dedicated symbols to such sounds. These were withdrawn in 1993 and replaced with a voiceless diacritic, , though remain in Serer orthography. Some authors disagree with the analysis implied by the IPA voiceless diacritic and retain the dedicated voiceless letters, or, occasionally, transcribe them instead as ingressive ejectives . The IPA had also suggested the possibility of a superscript left pointer, , which might also be used for fricatives, but it was not approved by the membership.

The attested voiceless implosive stops are:

*voiceless bilabial implosive 
*voiceless alveolar implosive 
*voiceless retroflex implosive 
*voiceless palatal implosive 
*voiceless velar implosive (may be paraphonemic in English)
*voiceless uvular implosive 
*voiceless labial–velar implosive 

==Occurrence==
In the world&#x27;s languages, the occurrence of implosives shows a strong cline from front to back points of articulation. Bilabial is the most common implosive. It is very rarely lacking in the inventory of languages which have implosive stops. On the other hand, implosives with a back articulation (such as velar ) occur much less frequently; apart from a few exceptions, the presence of the velar implosive goes along with the presence of implosives further forward. One of the few languages with a farther back implosive (specifically the alveolar one ), and without the bilabial implosive, is Yali, a Dani language spoken on the Indonesian side of New Guinea.

Implosives are widespread among the languages of Sub-Saharan Africa and Southeast Asia and are found in a few languages of the Amazon Basin. They are rarely reported elsewhere but occur in scattered languages such as the Mayan languages in North America, Saraiki and Sindhi in the Indian subcontinent. They appear to be entirely absent as phonemes from Europe and northern Asia and from Australia, even from the Australian ceremonial language Damin, which uses every other possible airstream mechanism besides percussives. However, Alpher (1977) reports that the Nhangu language of Australia may actually contain implosives, though more research is needed to determine the true nature of these sounds. Implosives may occasionally occur phonetically in some European languages: For instance, in some northern dialects of Ingrian, intervocalic bilabial stops may be realised as the implosive or .

Fully voiced stops are slightly implosive in a number of other languages, but this is not often described explicitly if there is no contrast with modal-voiced plosives. This situation occurs from Maidu to Thai to many Bantu languages, including Swahili.

Sindhi and Saraiki have an unusually large number of contrastive implosives, with . Although Sindhi has a dental–retroflex distinction in its plosives, with , the contrast is neutralized in the implosives. A contrastive retroflex implosive may also occur in Ngad&#x27;a, a language spoken in Flores, Indonesia, and occurs in Wadiyara Koli, a language spoken in India and Pakistan where it contrasts with the voiced alveolar implosive .

More examples can be found in the articles on individual implosives.

Voiceless implosives are quite rare, but are found in languages as varied as the Owere dialect of Igbo in Nigeria ( ), Krongo in Sudan, the Uzere dialect of Isoko, the closely related Lendu and Ngiti languages in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Serer in Senegal (), and some dialects of the Poqomchi’ and Quiche languages in Guatemala (). Owere Igbo has a seven-way contrast among bilabial stops, , and its alveolar stops are similar. The voiceless velar implosive occurs marginally in Uspantek and occurs in Mam, Kaqchikel, and Uspantek. Lendu has been claimed to have voiceless , but they may actually be creaky-voiced implosives. The voiceless labial–velar implosive also may occur in Central Igbo.

Some English speakers use a voiceless velar implosive to imitate the &quot;glug-glug&quot; sound of liquid being poured from a bottle, but others use a voiced implosive .

<text>The IJzerwake (Dutch, &quot;Yser Wake&quot;) is an organisation that split off from the IJzerbedevaart, and unites the more radical Flemish nationalists. Each year in August, they organise a commemoration of the victims of the two World Wars, combined with a rally for Flemish independence and a more conservative government policy. Many participants are members of the political party Vlaams Belang, and some are members and sympathizers of the less radical Nieuw-Vlaamse Alliantie. Ultra-right organisations, such as Voorpost and NSV, also attend.

The annual event derives its name from the IJzer river, around which some of the fiercest and most deadly battles of the first World War were fought. It takes place in a field near Zuidschote, between the towns Diksmuide on the IJzer river, and Ypres. A monument in the field commemorates the Brothers Van Raemdonck, the Flemish soldiers who both fell there on March 26, 1917, killed by enemy fire and apparently having died in each other&#x27;s arms.

The philosophical concept behind the IJzerwake is that of &quot;Godsvrede&quot; (Truce of God), a medieval term referring to the unification of previously competing factions behind one common cause. This of course symbolises the meeting of the myriad of organisations in the strongly diversified Flemish Movement which the IJzerwake hopes to unite.

==History==
===7th Wake(August 24, 2008)===

5100 people attended the 2008 IJzerwake. The motto of the meeting was &quot;Now dare with Flanders.&quot;. The IJzerwake started with a mass, followed by several speeches, singing together and vendelzwaaien. No politicians from other parties attended.

====Press coverage====

<text>The Yser Pilgrimage () is an annual gathering at the Yser Tower (&quot;IJzertoren&quot;) in Diksmuide, West Flanders in Belgium. This pilgrimage remembers the Flemish soldiers who died while serving in the Belgian Army during the First World War and was first organised in 1920. Initially influenced by pacifism, it became increasingly associated with the Flemish Movement. It is at the same time a political meeting striving for Flemish political autonomy. The motto of the annual meeting is &quot;No More War&quot;, &quot;Autonomy&quot; and &quot;Truce of God&quot;.

During the Second World War the pilgrimages were organised by the German occupying forces. Because of this link that still persists, Diksmuide became a gathering place of neo-Nazis from all over Europe during the weekend of the &quot;IJzerbedevaart&quot;. The &quot;IJzerbedevaart&quot; had hard times avoiding the publicity to be associated with their armed forces.

The Committee organising the &quot;IJzerbedevaart&quot; countered by making its message more radical and more modern at the same time. They tried to do this by clearly stressing the original aims dating back to the First World War (No more War, Autonomy, and Truce of God), and by rephrasing these aims to values of present-day interest (Peace, Freedom and Tolerance). They also diversified their activities to a.o. the museum in the &quot;IJzertoren&quot; and a music festival for peace (&quot;Ten Vrede&quot;).

Some participants did not agree with both the abolishing of the Second World War blemish and the rephrasing of the message. They first tried to take over the organisation, and in 1996 they even physically attacked the president during the &quot;IJzerbedevaart&quot;. This profound discord further harmed the reputation of the pilgrimage. Eventually the dissenters, who consider themselves to be more radical, split off and formed the &quot;IJzerwake&quot;.

<doc id="922446" wikidata="Q625661" url="?curid=922446" title="Reuben (son of Jacob)">
<text>Reuben or Reuven (, &quot;Rəʾūven&quot;, &quot;Rŭʾūḇēn&quot;) was the first of the six sons of Jacob and Leah (Jacob&#x27;s oldest son), according to the Book of Genesis. He was the founder of the Israelite Tribe of Reuben.

==Etymology==
The text of the Torah gives two different etymologies for the name of &quot;Reuben&quot;, which textual scholars attribute to various sources: one to the Yahwist and the other to the Elohist; the first explanation given by the Bible is that the name refers to Yahweh having witnessed Leah&#x27;s misery, concerning her status as the less-favourite of Jacob&#x27;s wives, implying that the etymology of &quot;Reuben&quot; derives from ; the second explanation is that the name refers to Leah&#x27;s hope that Reuben&#x27;s birth will make Jacob love her, and thus his name means &quot;He will love me&quot;. Another Hebrew phrase to which &quot;Reuben&quot; is particularly close is &quot;Behold, a son!&quot;, which is how classical rabbinical literature interpreted it. Some of these sources argue that Leah used the term to make an implied distinction between Reuben and Esau, his uncle. Some scholars suspect that the final consonant may originally have been an &quot;l&quot; similar to an &quot;n&quot; in the Paleo-Hebrew alphabet, and Josephus rendered the name as &quot;Reubel&quot;; it is thus possible that Reuben&#x27;s name is cognate with an Arabic term meaning &quot;wolves&quot;.

==Biblical references==

In the Book of Genesis, Reuben is briefly described as having had sexual activity with Bilhah, his stepmother&#x27;s maid and father&#x27;s concubine in 35:22. On his deathbed, Jacob declares that Reuben &quot;will no longer excel, for you went up onto your father&#x27;s bed, onto my couch and defiled it&quot; in 49:4. Reuben&#x27;s behaviour angered Jacob to the extent that he gave Reuben&#x27;s birthright (as firstborn) to Joseph: a comment within 1 Chronicles 5:1 makes the same point.

Classical rabbinical sources argue that the birthright had included the right of his descendants, the tribe of Reuben, to become ruler over the tribes and the priests, a right transferred to the Tribe of Judah and the Levites, respectively. However, some of these sources argue that Reuben had not had sexual activity with Bilhah but instead had simply supported the cause of his mother, Leah, by harming of Bilhah, angering Jacob; in these sources, it is argued that after the death of Rachel, Jacob&#x27;s favourite wife, Jacob sought to give the precedence to Bilhah, as he had formerly preferred her as his mistress. Reuben removed Bilhah&#x27;s bed from where Jacob wished to have it. The classical rabbinical texts argue that Reuben immediately showed contrition for his actions regarding Bilhah and thus was the &quot;first penitent&quot; initially, according to these sources, Reuben practiced penitence by secretly meditating, and also by abstaining from meat and wine, but when Judah confessed to the matter of Tamar, Reuben admitted what he had done, lest his other brothers might be suspected of his deed and punished for it. The classical sources go on to state that in honour of this voluntary penance and confession, God gave the tribe of Reuben Hosea as a member, and Reuben was given a reward in the future world.

Although part of the plot against Joseph, it is Reuben who persuades the others not to kill Joseph, tries to rescue him, and who later concludes that the trouble the brothers run into in Egypt was divine punishment for the plot. In classical rabbinical literature, Reuben is described as being motivated by a sense of responsibility over his brothers (since he was the eldest), and as having become angry when he discovers that Joseph had gone missing as a result of his brothers selling him to Ishmaelites (textual scholars attribute this version of the narrative to the Yahwist) or Joseph being found and taken by Midianites (textual scholars attribute this version of the narrative to the Elohist). The rabbinical sources argue that the first Cities of Refuge were located in the territory of the tribe of Reuben since their eponym had tried to save Joseph from the mob of his brothers.

Classical rabbinical sources argue that Reuben was born on 14 Kislev, and died at the age of 125. The &quot;Sefer haYashar&quot; argues that when he died, Reuben&#x27;s body was placed in a coffin and was later taken back to Israel, where it was buried.

==Reuben&#x27;s family==
According to , Reuben had four sons: Hanoch, Phallu, Hezron, and Carmi. According to , a stone of &quot;Bohan, the son of Reuben&quot; marked a point along the boundary of the land allocated to the tribe of Judah.

== Tomb ==
There is a tradition that Reuben was buried at a shrine in the former village of Nabi Rubin; the site was a place of pilgrimage and an annual festival before the Israeli Declaration of Independence in 1948. The ruins of the shrine containing the Tomb of Reuben and those of an adjacent mosque, nowadays abandoned, are today part of Palmachim Beach, a national park of Israel.

<text>The Yser Towers () are a monument complex near the Yser river at Diksmuide, West Flanders in Belgium. The first tower was built in 1928–30 to commemorate the Belgian soldiers killed on the surrounding Yser Front during World War I and as a monument to Christian pacifism. However, it subsequently became an important political symbol for the Flemish Movement and was destroyed in 1946 as a result of its association with Flemish nationalist collaboration in German-occupied Belgium in World War II. The current tower was rebuilt alongside the remains of the original and copied its design. It was finished in 1965. It remains a site of political significance to Flemish nationalists and is the center for their annual Yser Pilgrimage (&quot;IJzerbedevaart&quot;).

==Tower==
===First tower, 1930–1946===
The idea for a distinct monument in Flanders to commemorate the Flemish soldiers killed in the Belgian Army in World War I had been discussed since at least 1916 under the patronage of the priest Cyriel Verschaeve. After some initial efforts, construction on a -high tower-shaped monument near the Yser river at Kaaskerke near Diksmuide began in 1928. The site was symbolic because the Yser had represented the front-line of the Belgian Army for most of the war.
The tower was finished in 1930 and incorporated the &quot;Frontbeweging&quot;&#x27;s cruciform motto &quot;All for Flanders—Flanders for Christ&quot; (&quot;Alles Voor Vlaanderen, Vlaanderen Voor Kristus&quot;, abbreviated to AVV—VVK) and was unveiled at the 11th annual Yser Pilgrimage (&quot;IJzerbedevaart&quot;). In following years, the human remains of a number of &quot;Yser Symbols&quot; (&quot;IJzersymbolen&quot;) were reburied in the crypt of the tower, including the Van Raemdonck brothers and Joe English. Initially associated with Christian pacifism, the site soon became one of the most important symbolic political locations for the Flemish Movement and became associated with its largest contemporary political movements, notably the authoritarian Flemish National League (&quot;Vlaamsch Nationaal Verbond&quot;, VNV) and Union of Dutch National Solidarists (&quot;Verbond van Dietsche Nationaal-Solidaristen&quot;, Verdinaso).

The association of the Flemish Movement, especially the VNV, with collaborationism during German occupation of Belgium during World War II led two former members of the Belgian Resistance to illegally destroy the tower with dynamite on the night of 15–16 March 1946 as a reprisal. The ruins of the first tower were retained and were subsequently modeled into the Peace Gate (&quot;Paxpoort&quot;) in 1950.

===Second tower, 1965–present===
The second tower still stands at the site near to the remnants of the first. It was built to roughly the same design as the first but is larger at tall. The four sides of the base of the tower read &quot;Never war again&quot; in the three languages of Belgium, as well as in English. Work began in July 1952. The crypt was finished on 11 November 1958 and the tower itself was officially inaugurated on 22 August 1965.

The tower houses the Yser Museum (&quot;Museum aan de IJzer&quot;) which belongs to the United Nations network of peace museums. The museum houses the large painting, &quot;The Golden Canvass of Flanders&quot; (&quot;Het Gulden Doek van Vlaanderen&quot;) by Dutch-born Belgian painter Henry Luyten. The painting depicts a fictional meeting of the one hundred people who in Luyten&#x27;s opinion played the most important roles in Flemish history. It is situated close to the preserved section of wartime trenches known as the &quot;Trench of Death&quot; (&quot;Dodengang&quot;).

<text>was a Japanese punk metal band formed in Tokyo in 1981. Although the guitar style resembled heavy metal in many aspects, GISM was one of the first Japanese hardcore bands, while at the same time drawing influence from the early industrial/avant-garde music scene—something uncommon in punk bands at that time. The acronym GISM has many different variations; they include: &quot;Guerrilla Incendiary Sabotage Mutineer&quot; (&quot;original&quot;), &quot;God In the Schizoid Mind&quot;, &quot;Grand Imperialism Social Murder&quot;, &quot;Genocide Infanticide Suicide Menticide&quot;, &quot;Gay Individual Social Mean&quot;, &quot;Gothic Incest Sex Machine&quot;, &quot;Grubby Incest Stripper Mastitis&quot;, &quot;Gravity Impel Slaying Machine&quot;, &quot;Get Incinerated Sorrow Mass&quot;, &quot;Gore Impromptu Suicide Mine&quot;, &quot;Grim Iconic Sadistic Mantra&quot; and &quot;Gnostic Idiosyncrasy Sonic Militant&quot;.

GISM came to be widely known in the global punk scene after the song “Endless Blockades for the Pussyfooter” appeared on &quot;International P.E.A.C.E. Benefit Compilation&quot; 1984. Thereafter, the band attained something of a cult status in the international punk scene, duly for their unique blend of heavy metal and hardcore punk. Roadrunner Records ranked Sakevi Yokoyama No. 49 out of 50 of &quot;The Greatest Metal Frontmen of All Time&quot;.

==Biography==
===Career===
GISM had their first performance in 1981 at the University of Tokyo.

In 1984, GISM released their first album, titled &quot;Detestation&quot;, on Dogma Records. The album has been applauded for having unique vocals and a guitar style that was very uncommon in hardcore punk.

&quot;M.A.N.&quot;, or &quot;Military Affairs Neurotic&quot;, was released in 1987 on Beast Arts Records. The album was quite a departure from the &#x27;Detestation&#x27; album, putting more emphasis on a slower, metal style of music compared to the hardcore punk sound of the previous release.

GISM released their last album on compact disc, titled &quot;SoniCRIME TheRapy&quot;, in 2001. The band featured Kiichi Takahashi on bass and Ironfist Tatsushima on drums. Guitarist Randy Uchida died from cancer on 10 February 2001, shortly after the release of the album. GISM played two shows in Tokyo in honor of Randy Uchida, and then broke up.

In 2002, GISM made the cover of &quot;Burst Magazine&quot; (issue No. 49), an underground Japanese magazine.

GISM performed in the Netherlands on 15 April 2016 at Lee Dorian&#x27;s Roadburn event. It was their first performance after a 13-year hiatus, along with being their first show outside of Japan.

===Members and other projects===
Sakevi Yokoyama continued to make collage art with his own clothing brand &quot;stlTH&quot;, which made T-shirt designs until his passing in late 2023. In 1987, he made a cameo appearance in the Japanese film &quot;Robinson&#x27;s Garden&quot;. In the movie, he attacks a Rastafarian man for teaching children spirituality. This film is the only documentation of his &quot;acting&quot; career. In 2004, Sakevi released a solo album titled &quot;The War&quot; under the name S.K.V. In 2006, he designed the artwork for World Burns To Death&#x27;s album titled &quot;Totalitarian Sodomy&quot;.

Randy Uchida (guitarist) and Tohru Hiroshima (drummer) played with Ronny Wakamats and Michel Hammer in a side project called R.U.G. (Randy Uchida Group), which released one vinyl EP titled “Deathly Fighter” in 1984. Uchida died of cancer in 2001, and Hiroshima in 2022.

Kiichi Takahashi (bassist) was the vocalist for the occult heavy metal band Sabbrabells.

Cloudy (original bassist) played bass for female-fronted speed metal band &quot;Front Guerrilla&quot;, which released an EP titled Fight Back in 1986.

Ironfist Tatushima (drummer) continues to play in the bands &quot;Die You Bastard!&quot; and &quot;Crow&quot;, which he had been playing with prior to GISM.

Kaori Komura (original drummer) is an improviser using Korean percussion. She released a duo CD with Kazumoto Endo titled &quot;In The Cave&quot; in 2020.

Frontman Sakevi Yokoyama died on 24 August 2023.

==&quot;P.O.W.&quot; magazine==
During the mid 80s, Sakevi published a Japanese punkzine titled &quot;P.O.W.&quot; The acronym of P.O.W. initially stood for Punk On Wave, but then changed to Performance Of War for the third, final issue. The magazine promoted local punk bands from the Tokyo scene at the time. Sakevi also personally interviewed the Tokyo Medical Examiners Office, wrote the P.L.O., and wrote prisoners of war from Anti Japanese Armed Fronts by asking them all their opinions on death, included vivid instructions on different ways to kill people and showed vivid drawings on how ABC weapons are made with images of their horrific consequences. John Duncan, the guest-editor for the magazine, stated in the introduction of the third issue that Sakevi attacked a salaryman for staring with a makeshift flamethrower on a Tokyo commuter train, subsequently landing him in prison.

<doc id="922462" wikidata="Q7749433" url="?curid=922462" title="The Magic Goes Away">
<text>The Magic Goes Away is a fantasy short story written by Larry Niven in 1976, and later expanded to a novella of the same name which was published in 1978. While these works were not the first in the &quot;Magic Universe&quot; or &quot;Warlock&quot; series, they marked a turning point after the 1973 oil crisis and Niven&#x27;s subsequent transformation of the series into an allegory for a modern-day energy crisis. The setting was later used as a backdrop for the Golden Road series of novels &quot;The Burning City&quot; and &quot;Burning Tower&quot;, co-written with Jerry Pournelle, and the novel &quot;The Seascape Tattoo&quot; co-written with Steven Barnes.

==List of works in the series==
This is a list of publications based on the setting of &quot;The Magic Goes Away&quot;.

==Plot summary==
The Warlock, whose actual name is both unknown and unpronounceable, is a very powerful sorcerer at least 200 years old. He observes that when he stays in one place too long, his powers dwindle, and they return only when he leaves that place. Experimentation leads him to create an apparatus, now known as the Warlock&#x27;s Wheel, consisting of a metal disc enchanted to spin perpetually. The enchantment eventually consumes all of the mana in the vicinity, which causes a localized failure in all magic. The Warlock realizes that magic is fueled by a non-renewable resource, which would cause great concern among the magicians, as it was through their magic that nations enforced their wills both internally and abroad. The widespread diminishing of magical power in &quot;The Magic Goes Away&quot; triggered a quest on the part of the most powerful of the magicians of the time to harness a new source of magic, the Moon, which results in the events described in the book.

It was eventually discovered (in &quot;The Magic May Return&quot;) that mana was originally carried to Earth and the other bodies of the solar system on the solar wind, which replenishes mana slowly over time. However, at some point in the &quot;recent&quot; past (a few thousand years ago), a god created an invisible shield between Earth and Sun that intercepted the solar mana and caused the eventual decline of magic on Earth.

Traditional fantasy creatures inhabit Niven&#x27;s &quot;Magic&quot; universe but devolve into normal animals when deprived of mana. For example, a unicorn becomes a simple horse.

===Main characters===
* The Warlock: One of the world&#x27;s foremost magicians.
* Clubfoot: The Warlock&#x27;s apprentice. A Native American named after a deformity of his foot that he could have cured long ago but at the cost of half of his power.
* Wavyhill: The first necromancer. Exploiting the mana inherent in murder, he invented necromancy. His name comes from his practice of building his houses under magically-supported overhangs; when the local mana is depleted by a battle, the hillside collapses, trapping his foe and eliminating the evidence at the same time.

===Minor characters===
* Orolandes: A Greek soldier, survivor of the sinking of Atlantis.
* Mirandee: A powerful witch, formerly Warlock&#x27;s lover.
* The World Worm: Its spine composes all the world&#x27;s mountain chains: the Andes, Himalayas, Rockies, etc. It consumes its own tail, along with anything that might be living on it.

==Reception==
Richard A. Lupoff reviewed the 1978 novella unfavorably, saying that although the story &quot;bristles with amusing devices&quot;, the writing itself was unsatisfactory; he felt that there was not a spark of humanity in the book, and that the writer used &quot;flat&quot;, &quot;dull&quot;, &quot;sterile&quot; narrative prose.

==Influences==
In her afterword to the novella, Sandra Miesel identified a number of influences on the setting: &quot;The Wheels of If&quot;, &quot;The Incomplete Enchanter&quot;, &quot;The Blue Star&quot;, &quot;Operation Chaos&quot;, &quot;Too Many Magicians&quot;, &quot;The Dragon and the George&quot;, as well as Niven&#x27;s earlier works, &quot;All the Myriad Ways&quot; and the Svetz series.

There are also several references to the works of H. P. Lovecraft, such as the reference of a mad magician named Alhazred and an amorphous god called the Crawling Chaos.

==Graphic novel adaptation==
&quot;The Magic Goes Away&quot; was adapted as a graphic novel, the sixth in the &quot;DC Science Fiction Graphic Novel&quot; series, by Paul Kupperberg and Jan Duursema in 1986.

==In popular culture==
These card games use a card called &quot;Nevinyrral&quot; (&quot;Larry Niven&quot; spelled backwards), which reference elements from &quot;The Magic Goes Away&quot;:

* The collectible card game &quot;&quot; (by Richard Garfield) has a card called &quot;Nevinyrral&#x27;s Disk&quot;, which is a reference to the Warlock&#x27;s Wheel. This card roughly has the effect of removing the effects of players&#x27; spells from play, while leaving their lands intact.
* The collectible card game &quot;Netrunner&quot; (also by Richard Garfield) has a card called &quot;Nevinyrral&quot;, which has the effect of giving the Corporate player an extra action each turn, but if this card goes away the Corporate player loses.

<doc id="922464" wikidata="Q4997446" url="?curid=922464" title="Bunched logic">
<text>Bunched logic is a variety of substructural logic proposed by Peter O&#x27;Hearn and David Pym. Bunched logic provides primitives for reasoning about &quot;resource composition&quot;, which aid in the compositional analysis of computer and other systems. It has category-theoretic and truth-functional semantics, which can be understood in terms of an abstract concept of resource, and a proof theory in which the contexts Γ in an entailment judgement Γ ⊢ A are tree-like structures (bunches) rather than lists or (multi)sets as in most proof calculi. Bunched logic has an associated type theory, and its first application was in providing a way to control the aliasing and other forms of interference in imperative programs.
The logic has seen further applications in program verification, where it is the basis of the assertion language of separation logic, and in systems modelling, where it provides a way to decompose the resources used by components of a system.

== Foundations ==

The deduction theorem of classical logic relates conjunction and implication:
::formula_1
Bunched logic has two versions of the deduction theorem:
::formula_2 
formula_3 and formula_4 are forms of conjunction and implication that take resources into account (explained below). In addition to these connectives
bunched logic has a formula, sometimes written I or emp, which is the unit of *. In the original version of bunched logic formula_5 and formula_6 were the connectives from intuitionistic logic, while a boolean variant takes formula_5 and formula_6 (and formula_9) as from traditional boolean logic. Thus, bunched logic is compatible with constructive principles, but is in no way dependent on them.

===Truth-functional semantics (resource semantics)===
The easiest way to understand these formulae is in terms of its truth-functional semantics. In this semantics a formula is true or false with respect to given resources. 
formula_10 asserts that the resource at hand can be decomposed into resources that satisfy formula_11 and formula_12. 
formula_13 says that if we compose the resource at hand with additional resource that satisfies formula_12, then the combined resource satisfies formula_15. formula_5 and formula_6 have their familiar meanings.

The foundation for this reading of formulae was provided by
a forcing semantics formula_18 advanced by Pym, where the forcing relation means ″&quot;A&quot; holds of resource &quot;r&quot;″. The semantics is analogous to Kripke&#x27;s semantics of intuitionistic or modal logic, but where the elements of the model are regarded as resources that can be composed and decomposed, rather than as possible worlds that are accessible from one another. For example, the forcing semantics for the conjunction is of the form
::formula_19
where formula_20 is a way of combining resources and formula_21 is a relation of approximation.

This semantics of bunched logic draws on prior work in relevance logic (especially the operational semantics of Routley–Meyer), but differs from it by not requiring formula_22 and by accepting the semantics of standard intuitionistic or classical versions of formula_5 and formula_6. The property formula_22 is justified when thinking about relevance but denied by considerations of resource; having two copies of a resource is not the same as having one, and in some models (e.g. heap models) formula_26 might not even be defined. The standard semantics of formula_6 (or of negation) is often rejected by relevantists in their bid to escape the `paradoxes of material implication&#x27;, which are not a problem from the perspective of modelling resources and so not rejected by bunched logic. The semantics is also related to the &#x27;phase semantics&#x27; of linear logic, but again is differentiated by accepting the standard (even boolean) semantics of formula_5 and formula_6, which in linear logic is rejected in a bid to be constructive. These considerations are discussed in detail in an article on resource semantics by Pym, O&#x27;Hearn and Yang.

===Categorical semantics (doubly closed categories)===
The double version of the deduction theorem of bunched logic has a corresponding category-theoretic structure. Proofs in intuitionistic logic can be interpreted in 
cartesian closed categories, that is, categories with finite products satisfying the (natural in &quot;A&quot; and &quot;C&quot;) adjunction correspondence relating hom sets:
::formula_30
Bunched logic can be interpreted in categories possessing two such structures
::a categorical model of bunched logic is a single category possessing two closed structures, one symmetric monoidal closed the other cartesian closed.
A host of categorial models can be given using Day&#x27;s tensor product construction.
Additionally, the implicational fragment of bunched logic has been given a game semantics.

===Algebraic semantics===
The algebraic semantics of bunched logic is a special case of its categorical semantics, but is simple to state and can be more approachable.
::An algebraic model of bunched logic is a poset that is a Heyting algebra and that carries an additional commutative residuated lattice structure (for the same lattice as the Heyting algebra): that is, an ordered commutative monoid with an associated implication satisfying formula_31.
The boolean version of bunched logic has models as follows.
::An algebraic model of boolean bunched logic is a poset that is a Boolean algebra and that carries an additional residuated commutative monoid structure.

===Proof theory and type theory (bunches)===

The proof calculus of bunched logic
differs from usual sequent calculi in having a tree-like context of hypotheses instead of a flat list-like structure. In its sequent-based proof theories, the 
context formula_32 in an entailment judgement formula_33
is a finite rooted tree whose leaves are propositions and whose internal nodes are labelled with modes of composition corresponding to the two conjunctions. 
The two combining operators, comma and semicolon, are used (for instance) in the introduction rules for the two implications. 
:formula_34
The difference between the two composition rules comes from additional rules that apply to them.
* Multiplicative composition formula_35 denies the structural rules of weakening and contraction.
* Additive composition formula_36 admits weakening and contraction of entire bunches.
The structural rules and other operations on bunches are often applied deep within a tree-context, and not only at the top level: it is thus in a sense a calculus of deep inference.

Corresponding to bunched logic is a type theory having two kinds of function type. Following the Curry–Howard correspondence, introduction rules for implications correspond to introduction rules for function types.
:formula_37
Here, there are two distinct binders, formula_38 and formula_39, one for each kind of function type.

The proof theory of bunched logic has an historical debt to the use of bunches in relevance logic. But the bunched structure can in a sense be derived from the categorical and algebraic semantics:
to formulate an introduction rule for formula_40 we should mimick formula_41 on the left in sequents, and to introduce formula_42 we should mimick formula_5. This consideration leads to the use of two combining operators.

James Brotherston has done further significant work on a unified proof theory for bunched logic and variants, employing Belnap&#x27;s notion of display logic.

Galmiche, Méry, and Pym have provided a comprehensive treatment of bunched logic, including completeness and other meta-theory, based on labelled tableaux.

== Applications ==

=== Interference control ===

In perhaps the first use of substructural type theory to control resources, John C. Reynolds showed how to use an affine type theory to control aliasing and other forms of interference in Algol-like programming languages. O&#x27;Hearn used bunched type theory to extend Reynolds&#x27; system by allowing interference and non-interference to be more flexibly mixed. This resolved open problems concerning recursion and jumps in Reynolds&#x27; system.

=== Separation logic ===

Separation logic is an extension of Hoare logic that facilitates reasoning about mutable data structures that use pointers. Following Hoare logic the formulae of separation logic are of the form
formula_44, but the preconditions and postconditions are formulae interpreted in a model of bunched logic.
The original version of the logic was based on models as follows:
* formula_45 (finite partial functions from locations to values)
* formula_46 union of heaps with disjoint domains, undefined when domains overlap.
It is the undefinedness of the composition on overlapping heaps that models the separation idea. This is a model of the boolean variant of bunched logic.

Separation logic was used originally to prove properties of sequential programs, but then was extended to concurrency using a proof rule
:formula_47
that divides the storage accessed by parallel threads.

Later, the greater generality of the resource semantics was utilized: an abstract version of separation logic works for Hoare triples
where the preconditions and postconditions are formulae interpreted over an arbitrary partial commutative monoid instead of a particular heap model. 
By suitable choice of commutative monoid, it was surprisingly found that the proofs rules of abstract versions of concurrent separation logic could be used to reason about interfering concurrent processes, for example by encoding rely-guarantee and trace-based reasoning.

Separation logic is the basis of a number of tools for automatic and semi-automatic reasoning about programs, and is used in the Infer program analyzer currently deployed at Facebook.

=== Resources and processes ===

Bunched logic has been used in connection with the (synchronous) resource-process calculus SCRP in order to give a (modal) logic that characterizes, in the sense of Hennessy–Milner, the compositional structure of concurrent systems.

SCRP is notable for interpreting formula_48 in terms of &quot;both&quot; parallel composition of systems and composition of their associated resources.
The semantic clause of SCRP&#x27;s process logic that corresponds to separation logic&#x27;s rule for concurrency asserts that a formula formula_48 is true in resource-process state formula_50, formula_51 just in case there are decompositions of the resource formula_52 and process 
formula_53 ~ formula_54, where ~ denotes bisimulation, such that formula_11 is true in the resource-process state formula_56, formula_57 and formula_12 is true in the resource-process state formula_59, formula_60; that is formula_61 iff formula_62 and formula_63.

The system SCRP is based directly on bunched logic&#x27;s resource semantics; that is, on ordered monoids of resource elements. While direct and intuitively appealing, this choice leads to a specific technical problem: the Hennessy–Milner completeness theorem holds only for fragments of the modal logic that exclude the multiplicative implication and multiplicative modalities. This problem is solved by basing resource-process calculus on a resource semantics in which resource elements are combined using two combinators, one corresponding to concurrent composition and one corresponding to choice.

=== Spatial logics ===

Cardelli, Caires, Gordon and others have investigated a series of logics of process calculi, where a conjunction is interpreted in terms of parallel composition.
Unlike the work of Pym et al. in SCRP, they do not distinguish between parallel composition of systems and composition of resources accessed by the systems.

Their logics are based on instances of the resource semantics that give rise to models of the boolean variant of bunched logic. 
Although these logics give rise to instances of boolean bunched logic, they appear to have been arrived at independently, and in any case have significant additional structure in the way of modalities and binders. Related logics have been proposed as well for modelling XML data.

<text>Robert Menzies McAlmon (also used Robert M. McAlmon, as his signature name, March 9, 1895 – February 2, 1956) was an American writer, poet, and publisher. In the 1920s, he founded in Paris the publishing house, &quot;Contact Editions&quot;, where he published Ernest Hemingway, Gertrude Stein, James Joyce and Ezra Pound.

==Life==
McAlmon was born in Clifton, Kansas, the youngest of 10 children of an itinerant Presbyterian minister. He died in Desert Hot Springs, California, at age 60.

McAlmon studied for one semester as the University of Minnesota in 1916 before enlisting in the United States Army Air Corps in 1918. After World War I, he returned to university (1917–1920), this time at the University of Southern California. He attended classes intermittently until 1920, when he moved to Chicago and then New York City, where he worked as a nude model at an art school. Once in New York, he collaborated with William Carlos Williams on the &quot;Contact Review&quot;, which did not last for long but published poetry by Ezra Pound, Wallace Stevens, Marianne Moore, H.D., Kay Boyle, and Marsden Hartley.

The next year, he moved to Paris after marrying the wealthy English writer Annie Winifred Ellerman, better known as Bryher. This was a marriage of convenience which allowed Ellerman, a lesbian, to continue her relationship with Hilda Doolittle, and guarded McAlmon after he publicly identified himself as bisexual, stating: &quot;I&#x27;m bisexual myself, like Michelangelo, and I don&#x27;t give a damn who knows it.&quot; Ellerman divorced McAlmon in 1927.

McAlmon typed and edited the handwritten manuscript of Ulysses by James Joyce, with whom he had a friendship.

McAlmon became a prolific writer after the move, with many of his stories and poems based on his experiences as a youth in South Dakota.

==Contact editions==
Having published his book of short stories &quot;A Hasty Bunch&quot; with James Joyce&#x27;s printer Maurice Darantière in Dijon in 1922, he founded the Contact Publishing Company in 1923 using his father-in-law&#x27;s money. Lasting until 1929, Contact Editions brought out books by Bryher (&quot;Two Selves&quot;), H. D.&#x27;s &quot;Palimpsest&quot;, Mina Loy&#x27;s &quot;Lunar Baedecker&quot;, Ernest Hemingway&#x27;s first book &quot;Three Stories &amp; Ten Poems&quot; (1923), poems by Marsden Hartley, William Carlos Williams (&quot;Spring and All&quot;, 1923), Emanuel Carnevali&#x27;s only book during his lifetime (&quot;The Hurried Man&quot;), prose by Ford Madox Ford, Gertrude Stein (&quot;The Making of Americans&quot;, 1925), Mary Butts (&quot;Ashe of Rings&quot;), John Herrmann (&quot;What Happens&quot;), Edwin Lanham (&quot;Sailors Don&#x27;t Care&quot;), Robert Coates (&quot;The Eater of Darkness&quot;), Texas schoolteacher Gertrude Beasley&#x27;s &quot;My First Thirty Years&quot; and Saikaku Ihara&#x27;s &quot;Quaint Tales of Samurais&quot;. McAlmon paid for the publication of &quot;The Ladies Almanack&quot; by Djuna Barnes.

One of McAlmon&#x27;s most important and best-received works is &quot;Village: As It Happened Through a Fifteen Year Period&quot; (1924) which presents a bleak portrait of an American town. The book shows his love for Eugene Vidal (Eugene Collins in the book), Gore Vidal&#x27;s father, with whom he grew up in Madison, South Dakota, which is documented in Gore Vidal&#x27;s mid-90s memoir, &quot;Palimpsest.&quot;

Other works include the short story collection &quot;A Companion Volume&quot; (1923), the autobiographical novel &quot;Post-Adolescence&quot; (1923), &quot;Distinguished Air (Grim Fairy Tales)&quot; (1925), the poetry collections &quot;The Portrait of a Generation&quot; (1926), and &quot;Not Alone Lost&quot; (1937), the 1,200 line epic poem &quot;North America, Continent of Conjecture&quot; (1929), and his memoir &quot;Being Geniuses Together: An Autobiography&quot; (1938).

McAlmon returned to the United States in 1940, residing in El Paso, Texas, where he sought treatment for a pulmonary ailment. He died at Desert Hot Springs, California, almost unknown in his native country, sixteen years later.

In the 1990s, Edward Lorusso brought out three volumes of McAlmon&#x27;s fiction (many were first American publications), &quot;Village&quot; (1924, 1990), &quot;Post-Adolescence&quot; (1923, 1991), and &quot;Miss Knight and Others&quot; (1992), all through University of New Mexico Press. Edward Lorusso also published &quot;Naked Truth: The Fiction of Robert McAlmon&quot; in 2020.

McAlmon is heavily featured in the book &quot;Memoirs of Montparnasse&quot; by John Glassco about the golden age of Paris in the 1920s when writers and artists flocked to the city.

His social circle and friendship with Ernest Hemingway are discussed in the novel &quot;The Paris Wife&quot; by Paula McLain.

In 2007, his fictionalized memoir &quot;The Nightinghouls of Paris&quot; was published, based on the experiences of Glassco and his friend Graeme Taylor with McAlmon in Paris. The previously unpublished book was based on a typescript held by Yale&#x27;s archives.

An epistolary novel about McAlmon&#x27;s life in Greenwich Village, his expatriate adventures in Paris, and final years in California, &quot;Letters from Oblivion&quot; was published by Edward Lorusso in 2014.

<doc id="922470" wikidata="Q6595966" url="?curid=922470" title="List of Royal Canadian Air Force stations">
<text>This is a list of stations operated by the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF), or stations where RCAF units existed, from 1924 until unification into the Canadian Forces on February 1, 1968.

Some of the RCAF stations listed in this article link to facility descriptions containing the prefix &quot;CFB&quot; (Canadian Forces Base) or &quot;CFS&quot; (Canadian Forces Station). These facilities were at one time RCAF stations, but changed to &quot;CFBs&quot; or &quot;CFSs&quot; following unification of the Canadian Armed Forces in 1968. Most former RCAF stations still in use by the Canadian Forces are still operated by the RCAF (renamed from Air Command or AIRCOM in 2011, from the use &quot;air element&quot; 1968–2011). During the 1990s, most RCAF squadrons on Canadian Forces Bases were reorganized into &quot;wings&quot; as the primary lodger unit. Consequently, many Canadian Forces Bases used as air force bases are frequently referred to without the prefix CFB, e.g., &quot;CFB Greenwood&quot; is also referred to as &quot;14 Wing Greenwood&quot;, with 14 Wing being the primary lodger unit at CFB Greenwood.

Before 1968, all RCAF facilities followed the naming tradition of the Royal Air Force, whereby the prefix RCAF (vs. RAF) was affixed.

<text>Round Table Pizza is a chain and franchise of pizza parlours in the Western United States. The first Round Table Pizza restaurant was opened in 1959, and the company has over 400 restaurants. The company is headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia.

==Overview==
The company currently operates two formats. Traditional Round Table Pizza restaurants serve primarily pizza, salads, and beverages. A new format, Round Table Pizza Clubhouse - Pizza Pub Play, features expanded entertainment with arcade games for children and big-screen TVs with sports programming, as well as an expanded menu and craft beer selection.

== History ==
Round Table Pizza was founded by William R. Larson.&lt;ref name=&quot;legacy/25387323&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Larson was born in San Jose, California, on January 30, 1933, and was raised in Palo Alto, California. After serving 4 years in the U.S. Navy, Larson worked several different jobs, gaining experience that ultimately led him to create his own restaurant. He opened his first pizza parlor in Menlo Park, California on December 21, 1959 located at 1235 El Camino Real.&lt;ref name=&quot;SFGATE/16629720&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; He called his new restaurant Round Table Pizza. He named the restaurant Round Table Pizza after the round redwood tables he and his father constructed. 

This original location in Menlo Park would eventually be moved to 1225 El Camino Real a few years later, where it still stands today and is owned and operated by Bob Larson, William&#x27;s son. As of 2020, Bob Larson still owns and operates the original Menlo Park location. 

According to PizzaMarketPlace.com, &quot;William&#x27;s developed recipe &amp; crust soon brought Round Table Pizza a strong following from customers and entrepreneurs.&quot; By 1978 under Larson&#x27;s direction, Round Table had amassed over 225 stores. In 2011, the company filed for protection under Chapter 11 with the U.S. bankruptcy court and emerged from bankruptcy the same year. The Consensual Plan of Reorganization provides for 100% repayment of obligations to its secured and unsecured creditors and for its employee owners to retain 100% ownership of the company. Since then, the company met all obligations and its financial strength steadily improved with the retirement of debt and the increase in cash flow.

In 2014, the company signed a 35-store development agreement to build restaurants in Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, Oman, Kuwait, and Qatar. As of 2016, more than 450 franchised and company-owned locations were in Alaska, Arizona, California, Hawaii, Nevada, Oregon, and Washington. On September 15, 2017, Round Table Pizza announced that it was acquired by Global Franchise Group. In the same month, September 2017, Round Table Pizza closed all of the seven branches in Dubai.

In 2019, Round Table Pizza rebranded on its 60th anniversary, including a new logo and a new motto: &quot;Pizza Royalty&quot;. The chain also expanded to the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex for the first time in 2019, with new locations in Frisco and near the Southern Methodist University campus in University Park.

On June 28, 2021, Global Franchise Group announced that it would be acquired by FAT Brands, owners of Fatburger and Johnny Rockets. The acquisition was completed on July 22.

==Marketing==

William Larson penned the slogan for Round Table &quot;share a little pizza with someone you love.&quot; This was later changed to &quot;The Last Honest Pizza.&quot; In 1961, a friend of Larson&#x27;s drew some sketches of members of King Arthur&#x27;s court eating pizza, and Larson then adopted the King Arthur theme for his restaurants. The three banners in the official logo were added in 1970, and are intended to symbolize the letters &quot;F-U-N&quot;. Round Table Pizza began to expand through franchising. 

Larson sold a portion of Round Table stock to a group of investors in 1979. The investors formed an employee stock ownership plan in 1985, and by 1992, Round Table Pizza was wholly employee owned. Larson sold about 75% of the private franchise corporation to partners in 1978. In 1995 the controlling partners bought out Larson&#x27;s remaining 25%.

From around 2003 until 2005, Round Table Pizza&#x27;s official mascots were two puppets, Matt and Marcus, that appeared in the company&#x27;s television commercials. In 2007, Round Table Pizza&#x27;s mascot became the Pizza Knight, &quot;defender of family night.&quot; Since that time, other spokespersons have been featured, including actor Billy Gardell.

<doc id="922483" wikidata="Q77799" url="?curid=922483" title="Andreas Gruentzig">
<text>Andreas Roland Grüntzig (25 June 1939 – 27 October 1985) was a German radiologist and cardiologist, with foundational interest, training and research in epidemiology and angiology. He is known for being the first to develop successful balloon angioplasty for expanding lumens of narrowed arteries. He was born in Dresden.

==Early life==
Andreas Roland Gruentzig was born in Dresden, Germany on 25 June 1939, shortly before the start of World War II. His father, Dr. Wilmar Gruentzig (1902–1945), was a secondary-school science teacher with a PhD in chemistry. Wilmar was conscripted into the meteorological service of the Luftwaffe during World War II. He presumably died during the war. His mother was Charlotta (née Zeugner) Gruentzig (1907-1995) and a teacher. His older brother was Johannes Gruentzig. After his birth in Dresden, in 1940 the family moved to the house of a relative in the small town of Rochlitz in western Saxony. After the war, Charlotta and her sons moved to Leipzig along with her sister Alfreda Beier and her mother. In 1950, Charlotta moved her family to Buenos Aires, Argentina to live with her husband&#x27;s brother and wife. Unhappy and homesick Charlotta and her two sons moved back to Leipzig two years later. Gruentzig and his brother Johannes entered high school at the Thomasschule zu Leipzig. Gruetzig graduated from the Thomasschule in 1957 with highest honors. In 1956, his brother Johannes fled across the border to Hanover. Gruentzig followed a year later.

Gruentzig studied at Bunsen Gymnasium while his brother enrolled as a medical student at Heidelberg University. Gruentzig began his medical studies at Heidelberg University in autumn 1958, subsequently graduating on 8 April 1964. He then rotated through a series of internships in Mannheim, Hanover, Bad Harzburg, and Ludwigshafen. His studies included internal medicine and vascular surgery. In 1966 Gruentzig returned to Heidelberg University to take on a staff assistant job at the university&#x27;s Institute for Social and Occupational Medicine investigating risk factors for cardiovascular disease, chronic bronchitis, and liver degeneration. In 1967, he departed for a six-month paid fellowship to study epidemiology at the University of London School of Hygiene. In 1968 he returned to Heidelberg. Early in 1968 he left for a six-month assistant doctor&#x27;s job in Darmstadt at the Max Ratschow Clinic.

In November 1969, Gruentzig and his future wife Michaela moved to Zürich where he worked in the department of Angiology at the University Hospital of Zürich.

==Groundbreaking Procedure: Coronary Angioplasty==
In the late 1960s, Gruentzig learned of the angioplasty procedure developed by Charles Dotter, an American, at a lecture in Frankfurt, Germany. Encountering bureaucratic resistance in Germany to his exploration of angioplasty techniques, Gruentzig moved to Switzerland in 1969.

Gruentzig&#x27;s first successful coronary angioplasty treatment on an awake human was performed on 16 September 1977, in Zürich, Switzerland. He expanded a short, about 3 mm, non-branching section of the Left Anterior Descending (LAD) artery (the front branch of the left coronary artery) which supplies the front wall and tip of the heart (see coronary circulation) which had a high grade stenosis, about 80%, of the lumen. Gruentzig presented the results of his first four angioplasty cases at the 1977 American Heart Association (AHA) meeting, which led to widespread acknowledgement of his pioneering work.

The immediate results of this treatment, despite using only a carefully &quot;kitchen built&quot; catheter (crude by current standards), were quite good. The patient became and remained angina free after this treatment. This initial patient&#x27;s result was electively rechecked, by angiography at Emory University, on the 10-year anniversary of the initial treatment. The LAD narrowing, after this 10-year timespan, remained almost perfectly expanded. There was minimal residual narrowing, probably less than 10%, as seen in similar angle and multiple different views comparing with photographs of the original, 10 years earlier, before and after results.

The excellent results of this initial and subsequent patients were critical to the rapid development and growing acceptance of the angioplasty treatment option. Gruentzig recognized multiple important issues early: (a) the treatment would not be readily accepted by most physicians, especially bypass surgeons, (b) it could easily lead to bad outcomes without great care in selection of which patients/lesions to treat and of the treating physicians, and (c) it required careful teaching of the technique and its potential difficulties and pitfalls to other physicians, so as to proactively reduce the occurrence of poor results. Understanding these issues and tireless effort on his part are widely recognized in cardiology for being of fundamental importance to the ultimate success of the technique.

== Emory University Hospital 1980-1985 ==
In 1976, Gruentzig was presenting his animal research at a Miami medical meeting. Dr. Spencer King, a cardiologist from Emory University met him for the first time. In 1980, Dr. King visited Gruentzig in Zürich. Gruentzig was contemplating a significant change in his career because he had become frustrated with the slow pace of his efforts in Europe compared to the United States. He was considering joining the Cleveland Clinic. He said that he had two goals: (1) to further his research (2) to become a professor. King pointed out that Cleveland Clinic did not have a medical school so he would not be a professor there. This led to Gruentzig joining Emory University where he was immediately a professor.

When Dr. Gruentzig initially joined Emory, he collaborated with Dr. King to lead demonstration courses. The catheterization labs were directly connected to a large auditorium through closed-circuit television. During these sessions, either Dr. Gruentzig or Dr. King would perform the procedure while the other served as the moderator. Dr. King vividly remembered Dr. Gruentzig&#x27;s remarkable ability to swiftly assess situations and respond accordingly.

The inaugural annual course took place in Atlanta in February 1981, attracting over 200 cardiologists from across the globe who eagerly observed the exemplary teaching methods of the brilliant instructor. Spanning three and a half days, each half day featured a live teaching case. As subsequent courses unfolded, the momentum for angioplasty continued to surge. Thousands of cardiologists had learned Dr. Gruentzig&#x27;s techniques before his death. In one of his courses, Gruentzig stated: &quot;&quot;No matter what happens to the technique, I have made one contribution, and that is allowing physicians to work within the coronary arteries of the awake, alert patient.&quot;&#x27; 

== Gruentzig&#x27;s Legacy ==
By about 1990, lumen stenosis of the coronary arteries was more commonly treated by the angioplasty technique than by coronary artery bypass surgery. This treatment approach is now referred to as plain old balloon angioplasty (POBA).

In the 1990s, further major improvements, both immediate and especially long term became possible with better understanding of disease as a result of clinical research trials using IVUS and the development of stents to mechanically support POBA results.

Since the later 1990s, most angioplasties also involve a stent over the angioplasty balloon; the balloon is hydraulically expanded, typically at 6–25 atmospheres of internal pressure, then deflated and removed while the stent remains behind to mechanically support the lumen remaining in the new, more open shape as created by the hydraulically expanded balloon.

Gruentzig&#x27;s success remains a major breakthrough and great contribution to the field of medicine in demonstrating that doctors could work inside of the arteries safely, without the need for open surgery. By utilizing the arterial circulation as a &quot;therapeutic highway&quot;, many types of devices and drugs can now be delivered directly to the heart, kidneys, carotid arteries, brain, legs and aorta without the need for major surgery and general anesthesia.

==Personal life==
Gruentzig fathered an out-of-wedlock daughter named Katrin Hoffman in 1967.

Around the same time, Gruentzig met Michaela (née Seebrunner) Gruentzig. They were married in the summer of 1970 at Michaela&#x27;s Bavarian family home in Bad Reichenhall. They subsequently had a daughter Sonja Meret Gruentzig who was born in September 1976. Their marriage ended when Michaela and their daughter returned to Zürich in 1981. At that time, Gruentzig was spending most of his time with an Emory medical student, Margaret Anne Thornton of Macon, Georgia. Gruentzig and Thornton married in 1983.

Gruentzig also had a cardiac catheterization done on himself by hifellows Hal &#x27;Whit&#x27; Whitworth and Gary S. Roubin in 1985. Gruentzig dressed himself 20 minutes after the procedure was done, headed back to his office and resumed his work while applying pressure to the puncture site with his hand in his pocket. He felt that if &quot;knowing the coronary anatomy via angiography was good for his patients it would be good for himself&quot;.

His medical billing assistant, Nona Law, led the way with CTP codings for all of Dr Gruentzig’s procedures.

==Death and legacy==
Gruentzig, an instrument-rated pilot, and his wife, Margaret Anne, died in an airplane crash in their Beechcraft Baron in Forsyth, Georgia, on 27 October 1985. They are both buried in Riverside Cemetery (Macon, Georgia). The Grüntzig Ethica award for contributions to interventional cardiology is named for him.

<doc id="922489" wikidata="Q1211984" url="?curid=922489" title="The Double Helix">
<text>The Double Helix: A Personal Account of the Discovery of the Structure of DNA is an autobiographical account of the discovery of the double helix structure of DNA written by James D. Watson and published in 1968. It has earned both critical and public praise, along with continuing controversy about credit for the Nobel award and attitudes towards female scientists at the time of the discovery.

==Significance==
Watson is a U.S. molecular biologist, geneticist and zoologist, best known as one of the co-discoverers of the structure of DNA in 1953 with Francis Crick.

In 1998, the Modern Library placed &quot;The Double Helix&quot; at number 7 on its list of the 100 best nonfiction books of the 20th century. In 2012, &quot;The Double Helix&quot; was named as one of the 88 &quot;Books That Shaped America&quot; by the Library of Congress.

Though an important book about an immensely important subject, it was and remains a controversial account. Though it was originally slated to be published by Harvard University Press, Watson&#x27;s home university, Harvard dropped the arrangement after protestations from Francis Crick and Maurice Wilkins, co-discoverers of the structure of DNA, and it was published instead by Atheneum in the United States and Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson in the UK.

The intimate first-person memoir about scientific discovery was unusual for its time. The book has been hailed for its highly personal view of scientific work, though has been criticised as caring only about the glory of priority and the author is claimed to be willing to appropriate data from others surreptitiously in order to obtain it. It has also been criticized as being disagreeably sexist towards Rosalind Franklin, another participant in the discovery, who was deceased by the time Watson&#x27;s book was written.

The events described in the book were dramatized in a BBC television program &quot;Life Story&quot; (known as &quot;The Race for the Double Helix&quot; in the U.S.).

== Criticism ==

A 1980 Norton Critical Edition of &quot;The Double Helix&quot; edited by Gunther Stent, analyzed the events surrounding its initial publication. It presents a selection of both positive and negative reviews of the book, by such figures as Philip Morrison, Richard Lewontin, Alex Comfort, Jacob Bronowski, and more in-depth analyses by Peter Medawar, Robert K. Merton, and Andre Lwoff. Erwin Chargaff declined permission to reprint his unsympathetic review from the March 29, 1968, issue of &quot;Science&quot;, but letters in response from Max Perutz, Maurice Wilkins, and Watson are printed. Also included are retrospectives from a 1974 edition of &quot;Nature&quot; written by Francis Crick and Linus Pauling, and an analysis of Franklin&#x27;s work by her student Aaron Klug. The Norton edition concludes with the 1953 papers on DNA structure as published in &quot;Nature&quot;.

In the book &quot;Rosalind Franklin and DNA&quot;, author Anne Sayre is very critical of Watson&#x27;s account. She claims that Watson&#x27;s book did not give a balanced description of Rosalind Franklin and the nature of her interactions with Maurice Wilkins at King&#x27;s College, London. Sayre&#x27;s book raises doubts about the ethics of how Watson and Crick used some of Franklin&#x27;s results and whether adequate credit was given to her. Watson had very limited contact with Franklin during the time she worked on DNA. By providing more information about Franklin&#x27;s life than was included in Watson&#x27;s book, it was possible for Sayre to provide a different perspective on the role Franklin played in Watson and Crick&#x27;s discovery of the double helix structure of DNA. (See: King&#x27;s College London DNA Controversy.)

In the book&#x27;s preface, Watson explains that he is describing his impressions at the time of the events, and not at the time he wrote the book. In the epilogue Watson writes; &quot;Since my initial impressions about [Franklin], both scientific and personal (as recorded in the early pages of this book) were often wrong I want to say something here about her achievements.&quot; He goes on to describe her superb work, and, despite this, the enormous barriers she faced as a woman in the field of science. He also acknowledged that it took years to overcome their bickering before he could appreciate Franklin&#x27;s generosity and integrity.

== An annotated and illustrated edition ==

An annotated and illustrated version of the book, edited by Alex Gann and Jan Witkowski, was published in November 2012 by Simon &amp; Schuster in association with Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press. The new edition coincided with the fiftieth anniversary of the award of the 1962 Nobel Prize for physiology or medicine to Francis Crick, James D. Watson and Maurice Wilkins. It contains over three hundred annotations on the events and characters portrayed, with facsimile letters and contemporary photographs, many previously unpublished. Their sources include newly discovered correspondence from Crick, the papers of Franklin, Pauling, and Wilkins, and they include a chapter dropped from the original edition that described Watson&#x27;s holiday in the Italian Alps in 1952. The edition was favorably reviewed in &quot;The New York Times&quot; by Nicholas Wade who commented, &quot;anyone seeking to understand modern biology and genomics could do much worse than start with the discovery of the structure of DNA, on which almost everything else is based. This edition includes several appendices, including letters by Crick and Watson giving the first account of the discovery, a previously unpublished chapter, an account of the controversy surrounding the publication, and the unsympathetic review by the late Erwin Chargaff from the March 29, 1968, issue of &quot;Science&quot;, which he previously declined permission to reprint in the 1980 Norton Critical Edition of &quot;The Double Helix&quot; edited by Gunther Stent.

The book does not include the four press cuttings from the &quot;News Chronicle, Varsity&quot; and &quot;The New York Times&quot; (2) of May and June 1953 regarding the discovery of the structure of DNA, and Crick&#x27;s letter of 13th April 1967 is incomplete.

==Film adaptation==
In 1987, the memoir was adapted as a 107-minute television docudrama called &quot;Life Story&quot; for the BBC, airing on &quot;Horizon&quot;, the long-running British documentary television series on BBC Two that covers science and philosophy. The script was written by William Nicholson, and it was produced and directed by Mick Jackson. Jeff Goldblum starred as Watson, with Tim Pigott-Smith as Francis Crick, Juliet Stevenson as Rosalind Franklin, and Alan Howard as Maurice Wilkins.

The film won several awards in the UK and U.S., including the 1988 BAFTA TV Award as the Best Single Drama.

<text>Ewan Cameron (31 July 1922 in Dumbarton – 21 March 1991) was a Scottish physician who worked with Linus Pauling on Vitamin C research. He received his medical degree from the University of Glasgow in 1944, and immediately joined the British Army, where he served as a medical officer in Burma for three years.

Cameron was Consultant Surgeon at Vale of Leven Hospital in the County of Dunbarton (1956–1982), becoming the Senior Consultant Surgeon in 1973. He received the Queen&#x27;s Silver Jubilee Medal in 1977, as well as fellowships from the Royal Colleges of Surgeons of Glasgow and Edinburgh, and the Royal Faculty of Physicians and Surgeons in Glasgow. In 1966, Cameron published his first book, &quot;Hyaluronidase and Cancer&quot;.

In 1971, Cameron began corresponding with Dr. Linus Pauling. He completed many scientific studies in conjunction with the institute, and published &quot;Cancer and Vitamin C&quot; with Pauling in 1979. After retirement from Vale of Leven Hospital in 1982, Cameron was invited to become medical director and Senior Research Professor at the Linus Pauling Institute, where he worked closely with Pauling on many research topics.

<doc id="922493" wikidata="Q1184922" url="?curid=922493" title="Donald Ewen Cameron">
<text>Donald Ewen Cameron ( – ) was a Scottish-born psychiatrist. He is largely known today for his central role in unethical medical experiments, and development of psychological and medical torture techniques for the Central Intelligence Agency. He served as president of the American Psychiatric Association (1952–1953), Canadian Psychiatric Association (1958–1959), American Psychopathological Association (1963), Society of Biological Psychiatry (1965) and the World Psychiatric Association (1961–1966).

In spite of his high professional reputation, he has been criticized for, among other things, his experimentation on adults and children as well as his involvement in child sexual abuse, administering electroconvulsive therapy and experimental drugs, including poisons such as curare and hallucinogens such as lysergic acid diethylamide, to patients and prisoners without their knowledge or informed consent. Some of this work took place in the context of the Project MKUltra program for the developing of mind control and torture techniques, psychoactive poisons, and behavior modification systems. Decades after his own death, the psychic driving technique he developed continued to see extensive use in the torture of prisoners around the world.

==Early life and career==
Donald Ewen Cameron was born in Bridge of Allan, Scotland, the oldest son of a Presbyterian minister. He received an M.B., Ch.B. in psychological medicine from the University of Glasgow in 1924, a D.P.M. from the University of London in 1925, and an M.D. with distinction from the University of Glasgow in 1936.

Cameron began his training in psychiatry at the Glasgow Royal Mental Hospital in 1925. In 1926, he served as assistant medical officer there and was introduced to psychiatrist Sir David Henderson, a student of Swiss-born US psychiatrist Adolf Meyer. He continued his training in the United States under Meyer at the Phipps Clinic, Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, Maryland from 1926 to 1928 with a Henderson Research Scholarship.

In 1928, Cameron left Baltimore for the Burghölzli, the psychiatric hospital of the University of Zurich, in Switzerland, where he studied under Hans W. Maier, the successor of Swiss psychiatrist Eugen Bleuler, who had significantly influenced psychiatric thinking. There he met A. T. Mathers, Manitoba&#x27;s principal psychiatrist, who convinced Cameron in 1929 to move to Brandon, the second largest city of Manitoba, Canada. Cameron stayed there for seven years and was made physician-in-charge of the Reception Unit of the Provincial Mental Hospital. He also organized the structure of mental health services in the western half of the province, establishing 10 functioning clinics; this model was used as the blueprint for similar efforts in Montreal and a forerunner of 1960s community health models.

In 1933, he married Jean C. Rankine, whom he had met while they were students at the University of Glasgow. She was a former captain of the Scottish field hockey team, a competitive tennis player, and lecturer in mathematics at the University of Glasgow. They had four children; a daughter and three sons.

In 1936, he moved to Massachusetts to become director of the research division at Worcester State Hospital only 1 year later. In 1936, he also published his first book, &quot;Objective and Experimental Psychiatry&quot; which introduced his belief that psychiatry should approach the study of human behavior in a rigorous, scientific fashion rooted in biology. His theories of behavior stressed the unity of the organism with the environment; the book also outlined experimental method and research design. Cameron believed firmly in clinical psychiatry and a strict scientific method.

In 1938 he moved to Albany, New York, where he received his diplomate in psychiatry and thus was certified in psychiatry. From 1939 to 1943 he was professor of neurology and psychiatry at Albany Medical College, and at the Russell Sage School of Nursing, also in the Albany area. During those years, Cameron began to expand on his thoughts about the interrelationships of mind and body, developing a reputation as a psychiatrist who could bridge the gap between the organic, structural neurologists, and the psychiatrists whose knowledge of anatomy was limited to maps of the mind as opposed to maps of the brain. Through his instruction of nurses and psychiatrists he became an authority in his areas of concentration.

Cameron focused primarily on biological descriptive psychiatry and applied the British and European schools and models of the practice. Cameron followed these schools in demanding that mental disturbances are diseases and somatic in nature; all psychological illness would therefore be hardwired, a product of the body and the direct result of a patient&#x27;s biological structure rather than caused by social environments. Characteristics were thus diagnosed as syndromes emerging from the brain. It is at this juncture that he became interested with how he could effectively manipulate the brain to control and understand the processes of memory. He furthermore wanted to understand the problems of memory caused by aging, believing that the aged brain experienced psychosis.

In 1943, Cameron was invited to McGill University in Montreal by neurosurgeon Dr Wilder Penfield. With a grant from the Rockefeller Foundation, money from John Wilson McConnell of the &quot;Montreal Star&quot;, and a gift of Sir Hugh Allan&#x27;s mansion on Mount Royal, the Allan Memorial Institute for psychiatry was founded. Cameron became the first director of the Allan Memorial Institute as well as the first chairman of the Department of Psychiatry at McGill. He recruited psychoanalysts, social psychiatrists and biologists globally to develop the psychiatry program at McGill. From its beginning in 1943, the Allan Memorial Institute was run on an &quot;open door&quot; basis, allowing patients to leave if they wished, as opposed to the &quot;closed door&quot; policy of other hospitals in Canada in the early 1940s. In 1946, Cameron introduced the practice of the day hospital, the first of its kind in North America, permitting patients to remain at home while receiving treatment at the institute during the day, thus avoiding unnecessary hospitalization and allowing the patients to maintain ties with their community and family.

== Nuremberg trials ==

In 1945, Cameron, Nolan D. C. Lewis and Paul L. Schroeder, colonel and psychiatrist, University College of Illinois, were invited to the Nuremberg trials for a psychiatric evaluation of Rudolf Hess. Their diagnosis was amnesia and hysteria, per a short commentary in the &quot;Journal of the American Medical Association&quot;. Hess later confessed that he had faked the amnesia.

Before his arrival in Nuremberg, Cameron had written &quot;The Social Reorganization of Germany&quot;, in which he argued that German culture and its individual citizens would have to be transformed and reorganized. In his analysis, German culture was made up of people who had the need for status, worshipped strict order and regimentation, desired authoritarian leadership and had a deeply ingrained fear of other countries. The paper stated that German culture and its people would have offspring bound to become a threat to world peace in 30 years. To prevent this, the West would have to take measures to reorganize German society. Other similar psychiatric diagnoses of Germany were published during this time.

Cameron next published &quot;Nuremberg and Its Significance&quot;. In this, he hoped to establish a suitable method to reinstate a form of justice in Germany that could prevent its society from recreating the attitudes that led it from the Great War to World War II. Cameron viewed German society throughout history as continually giving rise to fearsome aggression. He came up with the idea that if he presented the world and confronted the Germans with the atrocities committed during the war, the world and the Germans would refrain from repeated acts of extreme aggression.; if the greater population of Germany saw the atrocities of World War II, they would surely submit to a re-organized system of justice. Cameron decided that Germans would be most likely to commit atrocities due to their historical, biological, racial and cultural past and their particular psychological nature. All Germans on trial would be assessed according to the likeliness for committing the crime.

Cameron began to develop broader theories of society, new concepts of human relations to replace concepts he deemed dangerous and outdated. These became the basis of a new social and behavioural science that he would later institute through his presidencies of the Canadian, American and World Psychiatric Associations, the American Psychopathological Association and the Society of Biological Psychiatry. With the results of the Manhattan project, Cameron feared that without proper re-organization of society, atomic weapons could fall into the hands of new, fearsome aggressors. Cameron argued that it was necessary for behavioral scientists to act as the social planners of society, and that the United Nations could provide a conduit for implementing his ideas for applying psychiatric elements to global governance and politics.

Cameron started to distinguish populations between &quot;the weak&quot; and &quot;the strong&quot;. Those with anxieties or insecurities and who had trouble with the state of the world were labelled as &quot;the weak&quot;; in Cameron&#x27;s analysis, they could not cope with life and had to be isolated from society by &quot;the strong&quot;. The mentally ill were thus labelled as not only sick, but also weak. Cameron further argued that &quot;the weak&quot; must not influence children. He promoted a philosophy where chaos could be prevented by removing the weak from society.

== Social and intrapsychic behaviour analysis ==
In the late 1940s and early 1950s, Cameron continued his work on memory and its relationship to aging. He published a book called &quot;Remembering&quot; and extended psychiatric links to human biology. In papers published during this time he linked RNA to memory. He furthered his diagnostic definitions of clinical states such as anxiety, depression and schizophrenia.

He began to develop the discipline of social psychiatry which concentrated on the roles of interpersonal interaction, family, community and culture in the emergence and amelioration of emotional disturbance. Cameron placed the psychiatric treatment unit inside of the hospital and inspected its success. Here in the hospital Cameron could observe how the psychiatric patient resembled patients with other diseases that were not psychiatric in nature. In this manner, somatic causes could be compared. The behaviour of a mental patient could resemble the behaviour of a patient with, for example, syphilis, and then a somatic cause could be deduced for a psychological illness. Cameron titled this procedure &quot;intrapsychic&quot; (a term derived from the psycho-somatic relationship of hospital patients).

Cameron began to abandon the Freudian unconscious in favour of a social constructivist&#x27;s view of mental illness. In his analysis, culture and society played a crucial role in the ability for one to function according to the demands necessary for human survival. Therefore, society should function to select out the weak and unwanted, those apt towards fearsome aggression that threatened society. Psychiatry would play a disciplinary role.

Cameron began to explore how industrial conditions could satisfy the population through work and what kind of person or worker is best suited to industrial conditions. A stronger personality would be able to maintain itself in heavy industrial situations, he theorised, while the weaker would not be able to cope with industrial conditions. Cameron would analyze what conditions produced the stronger worker, what would be the necessary conditions to replicate this personality and to reward the stronger while disciplining the weaker. In his 1946 paper entitled &quot;Frontiers of Social Psychiatry&quot;, he used the case of World War II Germany as an example where society poisoned the minds of citizens by creating a general anxiety or neurosis.

== Cameron and Freud: civilization and discontents ==
Although Cameron rejected the Freudian notion of the unconscious, he shared the Freudian idea that personal psychology is linked to the nervous nature. He theorized that attitudes and beliefs should reinforce the overall attitudes of the desired society. Like Freud, Cameron maintained that the family was the nucleus of social behavior and anxieties later in life were spawned during childhood. Cameron wanted to build an inventive psychiatric institution to determine rapid ways for societal control while demanding a psychological economy that did not center itself around guilt and guilt complexes. His focus on children included the rights to protection against outmoded, doctrinaire tactics, and the necessity for the implantation of taboos and inhibitions from their parents. Cameron wrote that mental illness was transmitted generationally; thus, the re-occurrence of mental illness could be stopped by remodeling and expanding existing concepts of marriage suitability, as well as the quarantine of mentally ill individuals from the general population. The only cure for mental illness, he theorized, was to eliminate its &quot;carriers&quot; from society altogether.

Cameron believed that mental illness was literally contagious – that if one came into contact with someone with mental illness, one would begin to produce the symptoms of a mental disease. For example, something like rock music could be created by mentally ill people and would produce mentally ill people through infection, which in turn would be transmitted to the genes. Thus, this group would have to be studied and controlled as a contagious social disease. Police, hospitals, government, and schools would need to use the correct psychiatric authority to stop mental contagions from spreading. Cameron also hoped to generate families capable of using authority and techniques to take measures against mental illness, which would later be apparent in Cameron&#x27;s MKULTRA and MKDELTA experiments.

== Cameron and the Germans ==
In Cameron&#x27;s book &quot;Life is For Living&quot;, published in 1948, he expressed a concern for the German race in general. Just as Sigrid Schultz stated in &quot;Germany will try it again&quot;, Cameron fostered a fear for Germans and their genetic determination. Those Germans affected by the events that led to World War II were of utmost concern. Cameron&#x27;s concerns extended to his policies determining who should have children and advance to positions of authority. According to Cameron&#x27;s psychiatric analysis of the German people, they were not suitable to have children or hold positions of authority because of a genetic tendency to organize society in a way that fostered fearsome aggression and would lead to war rather than peace; he would repeatedly use the German as the archetypal character structure on which to ground the most psychologically deviant humans.

== Mental illness as a social contagion ==
Although society had established sanctions against the spread of infectious diseases, Cameron wanted to extend the concept of contagion to chronic anxiety. He argued that people with mental illnesses could spread and transmit their diseases. He warned that government institutions should take measures against such potential liabilities. Cameron began to base some of his notions on race, as is seen in his theories regarding the German people.

In the late 1940s, Cameron presented his ideas in a lecture entitled &quot;Dangerous Men and Women&quot;. It describes various personalities that he believed were of marked danger to all members of society. The personality types are as follows:
* A passive man who &quot;is afraid to say what he really thinks&quot; and &quot;will stand anything, and stands for nothing&quot;. &quot;[H]e was born in Munich, he is the eternal compromiser and his spiritual food is appeasement&quot;.
* A possessive type, filled with jealousy and demanding utmost loyalty. This personality type poses a danger to those closest to them, especially children.
* The insecure man – &quot;They are the driven crowds that makes the army of the authoritarian overlord; they are the stuffing of conservatism ... mediocrity is their god. They fear the stranger, they fear the new idea; they are afraid to live, and scared to die.&quot; This third type needs conformity and obeys the dictates of society, adhering to a world of strict standards of right or wrong (which are manipulated by power groups to keep the insecure controlled and dependent). Cameron theorized that this type is dangerous because of its &quot;lust for authority&quot;.
* The last type is the psychopath, the greatest danger in times of political and societal upheaval; this Cameron labeled &quot;the Gestapo&quot;.

Cameron believed that a society in which psychiatry built and developed the institutions of government, schools, prisons and hospitals would be one in which science triumphed over the &quot;sick&quot; members of society. He demanded that political systems be watched, and that German people needed to be monitored due to their &quot;personality type&quot;, which he claimed results in the conditions that give rise to the dictatorial power of an authoritarian overlord.

Cameron stated, &quot;Get it understood how dangerous these damaged, sick personalities are to ourselves – and above all, to our children, whose traits are taking form and we shall find ways to put an end to them.&quot; He spoke about Germans, but also to the larger portion of the society that resembled or associated with such traits. For Cameron, the traits were contagions and anyone affected by the societal, cultural or personality forms would themselves be infected. Cameron used his ideas to implement policies on who should govern and parent in society. The described types would have to be eliminated from society if there was to be peace and progress. The sick were, for Cameron, the viral infection to its stability and health. The described types were the enemies of society and life. Experts must develop methods of forcefully changing attitudes and beliefs to prevent the authoritarian overlord.

==MKULTRA Subproject 68==
During the 1950s and 1960s, Cameron&#x27;s work attracted the interest of the Central Intelligence Agency&#x27;s MKUltra mind control program, which began funding his work under MKUltra subproject 68. He is unrelated to another CIA psychiatrist, Alan S. Cameron, who helped pioneer psychological profiling of world leaders during the 1970s and was not associated with the behavioral modification research program.

Cameron had hoped to correct schizophrenia by &quot;erasing&quot; existing memories and &quot;reprogramming&quot; the psyche. He commuted from Lake Placid, New York to Montreal every week to work at McGill&#x27;s Allan Memorial Institute and was paid $69,000 from 1957 to 1964 to carry out MKUltra experiments there, known as the Montreal experiments. In addition to LSD, he experimented with various paralytic drugs such as curare and electroconvulsive therapy at thirty to forty times the normal power. His &quot;psychic driving&quot; experiments consisted of putting a subject into a drug-induced coma for weeks at a time (up to three months in one case) while playing tape loops of noise or simple statements. These experiments were typically carried out on patients who had entered the Institute for minor problems such as anxiety disorders and postnatal depression; many were permanently debilitated after these treatments. Such consequences included incontinence, amnesia, forgetting how to talk, forgetting their parents, and thinking their interrogators were their parents. His work was inspired and paralleled by the psychiatrist William Sargant, who was also involved with the intelligence services (though not with MKULTRA) and experimented extensively on his patients without their consent, causing similar long-term damage. Several of the children who Cameron experimented on were sexually abused, in at least one case by several men. One of the children was filmed numerous times performing sexual acts with high-ranking federal government officials, in a scheme set up by Cameron and other MKULTRA researchers, to blackmail the officials to ensure further funding for the experiments.

Sid Taylor stated that Cameron used curare to immobilise his patients during his research. After one test he noted: &quot;Although the patient was prepared by both prolonged sensory isolation (35 days) and by repeated depatterning, and although she received 101 days of positive driving, no favourable results were obtained.&quot; Patients were tested in the Radio Telemetry Laboratory, which was built under Cameron&#x27;s direction. Here, patients were exposed to a range of RF and electromagnetic signals and monitored for changes in behaviour. It was reported that none of the patients sent to the Radio Telemetry Lab showed any signs of improvement.

In 1980, the Canadian investigative news program &quot;The Fifth Estate&quot; interviewed two former patients of Cameron&#x27;s who were among several of his ex patients who were at that time suing the CIA for the long term effects of Cameron&#x27;s treatment. In her book, &quot;In the Sleep Room: The Story of the CIA Brainwashing Experiments in Canada&quot;, author Anne Collins explored the history of Cameron and Montreal&#x27;s Allan Memorial Institute. This was made into a TV mini-series directed by Anne Wheeler in 1998, called &quot;The Sleep Room&quot;, which also dramatizes the lawsuit of Cameron&#x27;s ex-patients against the CIA. The son of one of Cameron&#x27;s patients noted in a memoir that other than Ed Broadbent and Svend Robinson, no Canadian MP brought up the issue in the House of Parliament.

Naomi Klein states in her book &quot;The Shock Doctrine&quot; that Cameron&#x27;s research and his contribution to MKUltra were not about mind control and brainwashing, but &quot;to design a scientifically based system for extracting information from &#x27;resistant sources.&#x27; In other words, torture.&quot; She then cites Alfred W. McCoy: &quot;Stripped of its bizarre excesses, Cameron&#x27;s experiments, building upon Donald O. Hebb&#x27;s earlier breakthrough, laid the scientific foundation for the CIA&#x27;s two-stage psychological torture method.&quot;

Cameron is the subject of Stephen Bennett&#x27;s film &quot;Eminent Monsters&quot; (2020), which was funded by BBC Scotland and Creative Scotland.

Whether or not Cameron was aware that funding for his experiments was coming from the CIA is unclear; it has been argued that he would have carried out the exact same experiments if funding had come from a source without ulterior motives.

==Death==
Cameron died of a heart attack while hiking with his son in the Adirondack Mountains on September 8, 1967.

<text>Fontographer is a font editor for Windows and macOS; it is used to create digital fonts. It was originally developed by Altsys but is now owned by FontLab Ltd.

==History==
===Altsys Corporation===
In December 1984, James R. Von Ehr II founded the Altsys Corporation to develop graphics applications for personal computers. The first foray by Altsys into commercial font editing software was a bitmap font editor called Fontastic, released in the mid-1980s for the Apple Macintosh. The program, developed by Altsys founder Von Ehr, was able to edit the native bitmap font format of the Mac. It introduced many of the interface elements that would carry over into Fontographer. Fontastic Plus was later introduced with new editing tools and kerning pairs.

Fontographer, developed by von Ehr for the Mac and released in January 1986 — before Adobe Illustrator — was the first commercially available Bézier curve editing software for a personal computer. High quality fonts in the PostScript format could be developed for a fraction of the cost of all other existing methods (URW&#x27;s Ikarus required systems costing over $100,000), leading to what has been called &quot;the democratization of type design&quot;: for the first time in history, numerous self-taught type designers without substantial capital investment produced fonts for professional use. Fontographer 2.0 was released eight months later in the Fall of 1986.

With the PostScript background established with Fontographer, Altsys developed FreeHand in 1988 as a Macintosh Postscript-based illustration program using Bézier curves for drawing and editing. In 1989, Fontographer 3.0 was released, featuring an auto-trace tool and automatic generation of hints for Postscript printer fonts.

===Macromedia===
In January 1995 Altsys was acquired by Macromedia and both Fontographer and FreeHand were incorporated into the Macromedia product lineup. A new version of Fontographer was included in the Macromedia Graphics Suite, which helped its wider adoption. Although development of the font editor was frozen from 1991, when version 4.1 was released, until 2006, many font and graphics designers continued to use it. FontLab, the only serious competitor at the time, was generally considered more difficult to use, although by 2005 it had overwhelmingly replaced Fontographer for most professional font development.

In May 2005, FontLab Ltd. announced that they had licensed distribution rights from Macromedia, and resumed development. In December 2005 FontLab shipped a new version of Fontographer for Mac OS, running natively on OS X and featuring numerous bug fixes. They subsequently bought the rights to the program outright.

In June 2010, Fontographer version 5.0 was released, the first major features added to the product since 1996. FontLab positioned the product as an easier-to-use alternative to FontLab Studio without many of the high-end features needed by professional type designers, and gave it a price intermediate between FontLab Studio and their more introductory font editing program TypeTool. In the summer of 2011, Fontlab released Fontographer 5.1. , Fontographer 5.2 is the latest release; it is compatible with Windows versions XP through 10, and as a 32-bit macOS application it is compatible with only versions 10.6 through 10.14 of the operating system.
