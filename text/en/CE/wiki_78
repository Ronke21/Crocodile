<text>The Greater Republic of Central America (Spanish: &quot;República Mayor de Centroamérica&quot;), later the United States of Central America (Spanish: &quot;Estados Unidos de Centroamérica&quot;), originally planned to be known as the Republic of Central America (Spanish: &quot;República de América Central&quot;), was a short-lived political union between El Salvador, Honduras, and Nicaragua, lasting from 1896 to 1898. It was an attempt to revive the failed Federal Republic of Central America that existed earlier in the century.

The three countries agreed to establish a union with the signing of the Treaty of Amapala on 20 June 1895. On 15 September 1896, after the countries had all ratified the treaty individually, the union was formally confirmed. The republic was rechristened the &quot;United States of Central America&quot; when its constitution came into effect on 1 November 1898.

The capital was to be the Honduran town of Amapala on the Gulf of Fonseca. The union was dissolved on 29 November 1898 after General Tomás Regalado seized power in El Salvador on 13 November 1898.

Before its dissolution, the Greater Republic established diplomatic relationships with the United States. Guatemala and Costa Rica both considered joining the union, but neither of them did so.

==Background==
During the late 1880s, Guatemalan President Manuel Barillas pushed the idea in Guatemala and neighboring El Salvador and Honduras to recreate a Central American union like the long dissolved Federal Republic of Central America. The pressure resulted in the nations of Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, and Nicaragua signing a treaty in San Salvador on 15 October 1889 which proclaimed the Republic of Central America. The republic was set to be established on 15 September 1890, to coincide with the date of independence of the original Federal Republic. On 22 June 1890, however, Salvadoran President Francisco Menéndez Valdivieso was assassinated and his successor, Carlos Basilio Ezeta, pulled out of the treaty, effectively killing the union before it was even formed. Guatemala refused to recognize Ezeta&#x27;s presidency and declared war on El Salvador on 27 June 1890. The United States sent warships to the coasts of El Salvador and Guatemala to protect American interests in both countries and put pressure on both governments to end the war which the two agreed to do so on 21 August 1890. The treaty was signed by the five nations of Central America and legitimized Ezeta&#x27;s government.

On 23 May 1892, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua signed a peace treaty strengthen relations and &quot;sentiments of brotherhood&quot; and leave a possibility open for a future Central American union. The treaty did little to ease relations however as Honduras and Nicaragua went to war in 1893 when Honduran President Domingo Vásquez accused Nicaraguan President José Santos Zelaya of supporting Honduran refugees to lead a revolution. The war ended on 22 February 1894 with the overthrow of Vásquez and the Nicaraguans establishing Policarpo Bonilla as president.

Meanwhile, in El Salvador, Carlos Ezeta, who derailed the formation of a union previously, was challenged by 44 Salvadoran rebels on 29 April 1894 for the Presidency. Led by Doroteo Caballero, the rebels attacked Ezeta&#x27;s forces, and with the support of Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua, overthrew Ezeta on 10 June 1894. Rafael Antonio Gutiérrez, one of the revolution&#x27;s leaders, became President of El Salvador. Ten days the revolution, the nations of El Salvador, Honduras, and Nicaragua met to officially recreate the Central American republic.

==Treaty of Amapala==
The Treaty of Amapala was signed by the delegations of the Central American nations of El Salvador, Honduras, and Nicaragua, on 20 June 1895. The treaty was signed on the Honduran city of Amapala on Tiger Island in the Gulf of Fonseca and the signing was hosted by Honduran President Policarpo Bonilla. The treaty was not a constitution and the republic&#x27;s existence relied solely on each member&#x27;s willingness to remain in the union, but nonetheless established the &quot;Greater Republic of Central America&quot; with its capital at Amapala.

The treaty had three articles.

===Article I===
===Article II===
===Article III===
== Quick collapse ==

Neither Guatemala nor Costa Rica signed the treaty but they both did show interest in joining. The Greater Republic was officially formed on 15 September 1896. President Grover Cleveland of the United States recognized the nation on 24 December 1896.

On 27 August 1898, representatives met in Managua to draft and sign the constitution of the Greater Republic. The Constitution of the Greater Republic of Central America was ratified on 1 November 1898, officially changing the name of the country to the &quot;United States of Central America&quot;. With the ratification of the constitution, the Executive Federal Council was established in Amapala. The council was full of provisional members who scheduled a general election for sometime in December 1898 to elect members to the Executive Federal Council and to elect the first President of Central America which were set to take office sometime in March 1899.

On 13 November 1898, just 12 days after the constitution was ratified, Salvadoran President Rafael Antonio Gutiérrez was overthrown by Tomás Regalado Romero, a fellow member of the revolution which had ousted Ezeta 4 years earlier. President Regalado declared that El Salvador would no longer be a member of the union since he believed that the interests of El Salvador would &quot;suffer.&quot; The Executive Federal Council attempted to come to a compromise with Regalado by offering El Salvador greater autonomy but Regalado refused, and when the military leaders of Honduras and Nicaragua failed to take military action against El Salvador, the Executive Federal Council declared the dissolution of the nation on 29 November 1898.

=== Heads of State ===

== Significance ==

The Greater Republic was the last successful attempt to create a Central American union as a single political entity. One last attempt would follow from 1921 to 1922 between Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras, but ultimately fell apart due to the lack of support from Nicaragua.

Since then, some international entities have been created by the Central American nations such as the now defunct Organization of Central American States (1951-1973), and the currently existing Central American Court of Justice (est. 1901), Central American Integration System and Central American Parliament (est. 1991), Dominican Republic–Central America Free Trade Agreement (est. 2005), Central America-4 Border Control Agreement and Central America-4 passport (est. 2006), and the Mesoamerica Project (est. 2008).

<text>The Rev. Francis Brown (December 26, 1849 – October 15, 1916) was an American Semitic scholar born in Hanover, New Hampshire.

==Biography==
He was the son of Samuel Gilman Brown (1813–1885), president of Hamilton College from 1867 to 1881, and the grandson of Francis Brown, whose removal from the presidency of Dartmouth College and later restoration were incidental to the famous Dartmouth College case.

The younger Francis graduated from Phillips Academy, Andover in 1866, from Dartmouth in 1870 and from the Union Theological Seminary in 1877, and then studied in Berlin. In 1879 he became instructor in biblical philology at the Union Theological Seminary, in 1881 an associate professor of the same subject, and in 1890 Davenport Professor of Hebrew and the cognate Languages.

Brown&#x27;s published works won him an honorary doctorate of Divinity from the University of Glasgow (1901), and a D.Litt. from the University of Oxford, as well as honorary doctorates from Dartmouth and Yale. The works are, with the exception of &quot;The Christian Point of View&quot; (1902; with Profs. A. C. McGiffert and G. W. Knox), almost purely linguistic and lexical, and include &quot;Assyriology: its Use and Abuse in Old Testament Study&quot; (1885), and the important revision of Gesenius&#x27; &quot;Lexicon&quot;, undertaken with S. R. Driver and C. A. Briggs — Brown Driver Briggs, &quot;A Hebrew and English Lexicon of the Old Testament&quot; (1891–1905).

He also contributed to the &quot;Encyclopaedia Biblica&quot;.

He died from heart disease at his home in New York City on October 15, 1916.

<doc id="928987" wikidata="Q7614300" url="?curid=928987" title="Steve Wigley">
<text>Steven Wigley (born 15 October 1961) is an English football coach and former player for Nottingham Forest, Sheffield United, Birmingham City, Portsmouth and Exeter City. He made 340 appearances in the Football League. He is the former manager of Southampton and the former assistant manager of Bristol City. He is the manager of Fulham U23s.

==Playing career==

Born in Ashton-under-Lyne, Wigley earned a reputation as a tricky winger for home-town club Curzon Ashton, jinking his way through defences and dazzling crowds with his skilful ball displays. It was this that attracted Brian Clough who promptly signed him for Nottingham Forest. After making his debut as a 21-year-old, Wigley played 82 times for Forest before moving to Sheffield United in 1985. Unfortunately, he never found success in Sheffield and moved to Birmingham City soon after, when a spectacular display against Portsmouth persuaded that club&#x27;s manager, Alan Ball, to sign him. After spending four years of mixed fortunes on the South Coast, helping Portsmouth to the 1992 FA Cup semi final where they lost on a penalty shootout to Liverpool, Wigley moved to Exeter to finish his Football League playing career and then having a brief spell with non-league Bognor Regis Town before taking on his first managerial job at Aldershot Town.

==Coaching and managerial career==

===Aldershot Town===
Wigley was appointed as manager of Aldershot Town after the departure of Steve Wignall. The Shots were by this time in the Isthmian League first division but failed to achieve promotion under Wigley&#x27;s leadership, finishing 4th, 5th and finally 7th in his three-year period with the club. Wigley is one of only two Aldershot Town managers not to have achieved promotion during his spell in charge of the Club.

===Nottingham Forest===
After three years at Aldershot, Academy Director Paul Hart persuaded him to return to Nottingham Forest as assistant academy director. In his time at Forest, Wigley moved up the ranks to become first team coach before short-lived Saints boss Stuart Gray lured him to Southampton as academy director in the summer of 2001. At the same time, David Platt, England Under 21 manager, asked Wigley to help out with coaching the young internationals.

===Southampton===
During Gordon Strachan&#x27;s reign at Southampton, Wigley moved to focus more on the first team than the academy players. When Strachan left the club in 2004, Wigley was asked to step in as caretaker. Wigley clearly felt ill at ease in charge of the Saints so after two games in charge, Paul Sturrock was brought in from Plymouth Argyle. During the rumoured player disputes with Sturrock, Wigley stepped in as an intermediary and helped solve differences at the club.

When Sturrock left the club in August 2004 only two games into the new season, chairman Rupert Lowe confirmed that Wigley had been appointed full-time manager and not just caretaker. Opponents of Wigley claimed that, with only three years in charge of Aldershot, a non-league club, he was not yet ready for Premier League management. However, some fans were happy with the appointment as it meant that Glenn Hoddle, widely reviled by many Saints fans could not return.

Wigley&#x27;s first tenure in the Premiership ended prematurely: he was dismissed by Southampton on 8 December after just 14 matches, the only win coming in the local derby against arch-rivals and former club Portsmouth. Wigley resumed duties with the club&#x27;s young players but finally left the club later in the season.

===Manchester City===
After leaving Southampton, Wigley joined up with former Nottingham Forest teammate Stuart Pearce at Manchester City as assistant manager/first team coach. During his first season at City, he guided City&#x27;s reserve team to third place in the Premiership North Reserve League. Wigley left City after Pearce was sacked in May 2007.

===England Under-21===
Wigley teamed up with Pearce again, this time as England Under-21 coach, after Pearce was appointed to this role in 2007. In August 2007 the Football Association appointed Wigley as a national coach, assuming responsibility for the 17–21 age groups to help develop young players. When Pearce was made caretaker manager of the full England team in February 2012, Wigley accompanied him as his assistant.

===Bolton Wanderers===
On 8 July 2008, Wigley joined the Bolton Wanderers backroom staff as head coach following a decision by Gary Megson to restructure the club&#x27;s coaching staff. On 30 December 2009, he and Chris Evans were appointed joint caretaker managers of Bolton following Megson&#x27;s sacking, but he left the club a few days later after Owen Coyle&#x27;s appointment.

===Hull City===
On 17 March 2010, he was appointed as coach at Premier League club, Hull City, under new manager, Iain Dowie.

===Bristol City===
On 18 August 2010, Wigley became assistant manager to Keith Millen at Bristol City on a one-year rolling contract. Millen stated: &quot;Steve was the man I wanted. He was always the name at the front of the list.&quot; Millen left the club in October 2011, and Wigley left a few weeks later by mutual consent.

===Hull City===
On 18 November, Wigley rejoined Hull City as first-team coach. After Steve Bruce was appointed team manager on 8 June 2012, Wigley and fellow first team coach Stuart Watkiss left the club.

===Fulham===
Shortly afterwards, Wigley was appointed head of coaching and under-18 manager at the Fulham Academy.

===Nottingham Forest===
Wigley left Fulham in May 2014 to again team up with Stuart Pearce as his assistant manager at Nottingham Forest. After Dougie Freedman replaced Pearce as manager on 1 February 2015, Wigley and the remainder of the backroom staff left the following day.

===Return to Fulham===
On 30 June 2015, Wigley rejoined Fulham as U18s manager. In 2021, he was promoted to manager of the U23s.

<doc id="928988" wikidata="Q7736217" url="?curid=928988" title="The Germans">
<text>&quot;The Germans&quot; is the sixth episode of the first series of the British television sitcom &quot;Fawlty Towers&quot;. Written by John Cleese and Connie Booth and directed by John Howard Davies, it was first broadcast on BBC2 on 24 October 1975.

The episode revolves around Basil&#x27;s attempts to successfully run the hotel alone whilst Sybil is in hospital. Whilst attempting to run a fire drill, a real fire begins in the hotel kitchen, resulting in Basil becoming concussed. Discharging himself from hospital, Basil arrives in time to greet a party of German guests, but he is unable to hide his anti-German sentiment towards them.

The episode has been featured on several &quot;best of&quot; episode lists and is regarded as being one of the most popular episodes in the series. Conversely, it has attracted controversy for its themes of anti-German sentiment and use of racial slurs, and was removed from the UKTV streaming platform in 2020, though later reinstated.

==Plot==
Sybil, in hospital for a few days, instructs Basil on several tasks he must complete while managing the hotel, including running a required fire drill and hanging a moose head. At the hotel, Basil has a conversation with the senile World War I veteran Major Gowen, who cringes and expresses anti-German sentiment when Basil tells him that a German group is due the next day. Basil attempts to hang the moose head with Manuel, but is repeatedly interrupted by Sybil calling him to remind him to do so. At one point, when Basil has left the head on the reception desk to retrieve a hammer, Manuel practises his English from behind the desk, leading an astonished Major Gowen to think that the moose head is talking.

The next morning, Basil successfully mounts the head. After another call from Sybil, he prepares to start the fire drill, but ends up creating confusion among the guests between the sound of the fire alarm and the sound of the burglar alarm. Whilst cooking in the kitchen, Manuel causes a real fire, which sets off the alarm. Basil, unaware of this, assures the guests that it is only a drill. Upon realising that there is a real fire, Basil starts the alarm once more. He attempts to use the extinguisher on the fire, but it bursts and sprays him in the face, blinding him. Manuel races out of the kitchen and tries to help, only to knock Basil out accidentally with a frying pan.

Basil wakes up in hospital, having suffered concussion, and Sybil tells Dr Finn that Basil cannot cope with the hotel alone. Basil sneaks out and returns to Fawlty Towers in time to greet the German guests. Despite repeatedly telling everyone not to &quot;mention the war&quot;, a combination of his own animosity and concussion-induced mental confusion cause him to make numerous World War II references while taking the guests&#x27; dinner orders. He begins arguing with them, calling out Nazi Germany and making references to Adolf Hitler and others. Polly discreetly calls the hospital to warn them about Basil&#x27;s behaviour.

As one of the Germans breaks down into tears, Basil begins to joke about Royal Air Force firebombing raids against German cities. This culminates in Basil performing a goose stepping impression of Hitler. Dr Finn arrives with a sedative needle, prompting Basil to flee, and Manuel also gives chase. However, Basil runs into the wall where he had hung the moose head, which falls, knocks Basil out again, and lands on Manuel&#x27;s head. As the stunned Germans look on, Major Gowen enters the room and launches into a conversation with what he still believes is a talking moose head. The Germans shake their heads in shocked disbelief, until one finally asks aloud, &quot;How ever did &quot;they&quot; win?&quot;

==Production==
Interior scenes of this episode were recorded on 31 August 1975, in Studio TC6 of the BBC Television Centre, before a live audience. It was the only episode not to begin with an exterior shot of the hotel. Instead, an exterior shot of the Northwick Park Hospital in Brent was used.

In the scene where Manuel attempts to put out a fire in the kitchen, firemen were on standby to put out the flames. However, in the next shot where Manuel walks out to alert Basil of the fire, two chemicals were added to his arm, to create smoke. During rehearsal and filming, these chemicals soaked into his clothing, causing Andrew Sachs second degree chemical burns on his arm and back. As a result, the BBC paid Sachs damages worth £700.

Co-writer John Cleese claims that he &quot;never think[s] the second half of &#x27;The Germans&#x27; is as well written as all that&quot;. Although the first half is &quot;written beautifully&quot;, Cleese believes the second half has &quot;several things&quot; wrong with it. Cleese cites in particular the fire drill scene as a favourite: &quot;It&#x27;s a situation when two people are trying to understand each other and just missing each other&#x27;s meaning.&quot;

==Cultural impact==
This episode popularised the phrase &quot;Don&#x27;t mention the war&quot;. Cleese turned the phrase into a song, &quot;Don&#x27;t Mention the World Cup&quot;, for the 2006 FIFA World Cup, the first time Cleese had played Basil Fawlty in twenty-seven years. The phrase was used as a title for a humorous travel book written by Stewart Ferris and Paul Bassett, detailing travels through Germany and other European countries. It is also the title of a book by John Ramsden, published in 2006, which examines Anglo-German relations since 1890, and a 2005 Radio 4 documentary looking at the British perception of Germans.

In the first episode of the second series of the BBC series &quot;The Office&quot;, David Brent performs an impression of a paper industry figure as Basil Fawlty, quoting the phrase &quot;Don&#x27;t mention the war&quot;, and impersonating the goose step used by Basil.

==Home media releases==
In 1982, an LP record containing the episodes &quot;The Kipper and the Corpse&quot; and &quot;The Germans&quot; was released by BBC Records. Titled &quot;Fawlty Towers: At Your Service&quot;, the LP was the third record released by the BBC. The episodes were renamed &quot;Death&quot; and &quot;Fire Drill&quot; for the release, respectively.

== Reception ==
This episode has been listed on several &quot;best episode&quot; lists and is one of the most popular episodes in the series. In 1997, &quot;The Germans&quot; was ranked No. 12 on &quot;TV Guide&quot;″s 100 Greatest Episodes of All Time. It was voted as number 11 in Channel 4&#x27;s &quot;One Hundred Greatest TV Moments&quot; in 1999. &quot;Empire&quot; magazine listed this as the best episode of the show in its list of the 50 greatest TV episodes of all time. The American film director Martin Scorsese has cited this as his favourite episode of &quot;Fawlty Towers&quot;. Gold, a channel that regularly broadcasts &quot;Fawlty Towers&quot;, has argued that while &quot;The Germans&quot; is the most famous episode, the best episode is &quot;Communication Problems&quot;. Morris Bright and Robert Ross, in their 2001 &quot;Fawlty Towers&quot; history book, wrote that if you &quot;ask anyone who&#x27;s watched &quot;Fawlty Towers&quot; which episode they recall more than any other and most will nominate &#x27;The Germans&#x27;, usually followed by cries of &#x27;Don&#x27;t mention the war!&#x27; and visions of Basil strutting around like a Pythonesque Nazi&quot;.

=== German response ===
In 1993, Germany began broadcasting &quot;Fawlty Towers&quot; on cable television. These airings proved to be a &quot;tremendous success&quot; with ratings, and &quot;The Germans&quot; proved to be one of the most popular episodes shown in the country. A German spokesman at the time reported that German viewers were &quot;most keen&quot; on the slapstick elements within the series and specifically stated that the &quot;&#x27;don&#x27;t mention the war&#x27; scene did not cause offense&quot;. Cleese later recalled a &quot;terrific&quot; occasion in Hamburg when a German fan shouted &quot;Hey, Mr Cleese, don&#x27;t mention zee war!&quot; Cleese recalled: &quot;It&#x27;s taken a little time, but I felt really good about that. That chap had got the whole point of the episode.&quot; However, when the German adaptation of the series was created in 2001, this episode was omitted from the storylines.

==Controversy==
&quot;The Germans&quot; has been evaluated by critics in the context of stoking anti-German sentiment. Journalist Mark Lawson expressed the view that, &quot;while the show will never win a prize for encouraging Anglo-German cultural understanding, Cleese is comically depicting – rather than politically promoting – fear of &#x27;Fritz. In response to critics, John Cleese stated that his intention in writing this episode was &quot;to make fun of English Basil Fawltys who are buried in the past&quot; and &quot;to make fun of the British obsession with the Second World War&quot;.

In 2013, the BBC edited the Major&#x27;s use of racial slurs from a repeat transmission of the episode, prompting some criticism by viewers. The BBC defended its decision: &quot;We are very proud of &quot;Fawlty Towers&quot; and its contribution to British television comedy. But public attitudes have changed significantly since it was made and it was decided to make some minor changes, with the consent of John Cleese&#x27;s management, to allow the episode to transmit to a family audience at 7.30pm on BBC Two.&quot; However, on 28 June 2013, Gold transmitted the unedited episode after the watershed.

The episode was removed from the UKTV streaming service on 11 June 2020 in the wake of the George Floyd protests, with the other episodes of &quot;Fawlty Towers&quot; remaining available on the service. Cleese spoke against the removal of the episode due to the Major&#x27;s use of racial slurs: &quot;The Major was an old fossil left over from decades before. We were not supporting his views, we were making fun of them. If they can&#x27;t see that, if people are too stupid to see that, what can one say?&quot; On 13 June, it was reinstated by UKTV with a warning about &quot;offensive content and language&quot;.

==Stage adaptation==
This episode, along with &quot;The Hotel Inspectors&quot; and &quot;Communication Problems&quot;, was adapted into a stage play by John Cleese and director Caroline Jay Ranger. Titled &quot;Fawlty Towers Live&quot;, the stage play went on tour in Australia in 2016. The three episodes&#x27;s plot were merged into one storyline. In 2024, the play, retitled &quot;Fawlty Towers: The Play&quot;, made its debut in the West End.

<doc id="928990" wikidata="Q726627" url="?curid=928990" title="Cetane number">
<text>Cetane number (cetane rating) (CN) is an indicator of the combustion speed of diesel fuel and compression needed for . It plays a similar role for diesel as octane rating does for gasoline. The CN is an important factor in determining the quality of diesel fuel, but not the only one; other measurements of diesel fuel&#x27;s quality include (but are not limited to) energy content, density, lubricity, cold-flow properties and sulfur content.

== Definition ==
The cetane number of a fuel is defined by finding a blend of cetane and isocetane with the same ignition delay. Cetane has a cetane number defined to be 100, while isocetane&#x27;s measured cetane number is 15, replacing the former reference fuel alpha-methylnaphthalene, which was assigned a cetane number of 0. Once the blend is known, the cetane number is calculated as a volume-weighted average, rounded to the nearest whole number, of cetane&#x27;s 100 and isocetane&#x27;s 15.
:cetane number = % &quot;n&quot;-cetane + 0.15(% isocetane)

Cetane number is an inverse function of a fuel&#x27;s ignition delay, the time period between the start of ignition and the first identifiable pressure increase during combustion of the fuel. In a particular diesel engine, higher cetane fuels will have shorter ignition delay periods than lower cetane fuels. Cetane numbers are only used for the relatively light distillate diesel oils. For heavy (residual) fuel oil two other scales are used, CCAI and CII.

== Typical values ==
Generally, diesel engines operate well with a CN from 48 to 50. Fuels with lower cetane number have longer ignition delays, requiring more time for the fuel combustion process to be completed. Hence, higher speed diesel engines operate more effectively with higher cetane number fuels.

In Europe, diesel cetane numbers were set at a minimum of 38 in 1994 and 40 in 2000. The standard for diesel sold in European Union, Iceland, Norway and Switzerland is defined by standard EN 590. Since 1 January 2001 EN 590 demands a minimum cetane index of 46 and a minimum cetane number of 51. Premium diesel fuel can have a cetane number as high as 60.

In Finland, premium diesel fuels sold by filling station chains St1 (Diesel Plus), Shell (containing GTL) and ABC (Smart Diesel) have a minimum cetane number of 60 with the typical value being at 63. Neste MY Renewable Diesel sold in Finland has a minimum cetane number of 70.

In North America, most states adopt ASTM D975 as their diesel fuel standard and the minimum cetane number is set at 40, with typical values in the 42-45 range. Premium diesel fuel may or may not have higher cetane number depending on the supplier. Premium diesel often use additives to improve CN and lubricity, detergents to clean the fuel injectors and minimize carbon deposits, water dispersants, and other additives depending on geographical and seasonal needs.. California diesel fuel has a minimum cetane of 53. Under the Texas Low Emission Diesel (TxLED) program there are 110 counties where diesel fuel must have a cetane number of 48 or greater, or else must use an approved alternative formulation or comply with the designated alternative limits.

Neste MY Renewable Diesel sold in North America has a cetane number of 70+.

==Additives==
Alkyl nitrates (principally 2-ethylhexyl nitrate) and di-&quot;tert&quot;-butyl peroxide are used as additives to raise the cetane number.

==Alternative fuels==
Biodiesel from vegetable oil sources have been recorded as having a cetane number range of 46 to 52, and animal-fat based biodiesels cetane numbers range from 56 to 60. Dimethyl ether is a potential diesel fuel as it has a high cetane rating (55-60) and can be produced as a biofuel. Most simple ethers, including liquid ones, such as diethyl ether can be used as diesel fuels, although the lubricity can be of concern.

== Chemical relevance ==
Cetane is the hydrocarbon with chemical formulas C16H34 and specifically the structural formula CH3(CH2)14CH3. Also named n-hexadecane, it is an unbranched saturated alkane. Cetane ignites with a short delay under compression, and is assigned a cetane number of 100. Alpha-methylnaphthalene, which has a long delay period, was assigned a cetane number of 0, but has been replaced as a reference fuel by 2,3,4,5,6,7,8-heptamethylnonane, which is assigned a cetane number of 15. All other hydrocarbons in diesel fuel are indexed to cetane as to how rapidly they ignite under compression, i.e. diesel engine conditions. Since hundreds of components comprise diesel fuel, the overall cetane number of that fuel is the average cetane quality of all the components. High-cetane components have a disproportionate influence, hence the use of high-cetane additives.

== Measuring cetane number ==
Cetane numbers are rather difficult to measure accurately, as it requires a special diesel engine called a Cooperative Fuel Research (CFR) engine. Under standard test conditions, the operator of the CFR engine uses a manual-wheel to increase the compression ratio (and therefore the peak pressure within the cylinder) of the engine until the time between fuel injection and ignition is 2.407 ms. The resulting cetane number is then calculated by determining which mixture of cetane (hexadecane) and isocetane (2,2,4,4,6,8,8-heptamethylnonane) will result in the same ignition delay.

===Ignition Quality Tester (IQT)===
Another reliable method of measuring the derived cetane number (DCN) of diesel fuel is the Ignition Quality Tester (IQT). This instrument applies a simpler, more robust approach to CN measurement than the CFR. Fuel is injected into a constant volume combustion chamber at approximately 575 °C and . The time between the start of injection and the recovery of the combustion chamber pressure to is defined as the ignition delay. This measured ignition delay is then used to calculate the DCN of the fuel. The fuel&#x27;s DCN is then calculated using an empirical inverse relationship to ignition delay. Because of the reproducibility, material cost, and speed of the IQT, this has been the definitive source for DCN measurements of fuels since the late 2000s.

===Fuel ignition tester===
Another reliable method of measuring the derived cetane number of diesel fuel is the Fuel Ignition Tester (FIT). This instrument applies a simpler, more robust approach to CN measurement than the CFR. Fuel is injected into a constant volume combustion chamber in which the ambient temperature is approximately 575 °C. The fuel combusts, and the high rate of pressure change within the chamber defines the start of combustion. The ignition delay of the fuel can then be calculated as the time elapsed between the start of fuel injection and the start of combustion. The fuel&#x27;s derived cetane number can then be calculated using an empirical inverse relationship to ignition delay.

===Cetane index===

Another statistic used by fuel-users to control quality is the cetane index (CI), which is a calculated number based on the density and a distillation range of the fuel. There are various versions of this, depending on whether metric or Imperial units are used, and the number of distillation points that are used. These days most oil companies use the &#x27;4-point method&#x27;, ASTM D4737, based on density and 10% 50% and 90% recovery temperatures. The &#x27;2-point method&#x27; is defined in ASTM D976 and uses just density and the 50% recovery temperature. This 2-point method tends to overestimate the cetane index and is not recommended. Cetane index calculations cannot account for cetane improver additives and therefore do not measure the total cetane number for additized diesel fuels. Diesel engine operation is primarily related to the actual cetane number, and the cetane index is merely an estimation of the base (unadditized) cetane number.

===Industry standards===
The industry standards for measuring cetane number are ASTM D613 (ISO 5165) for the CFR engine, D6890 for the IQT, and D7170 for the FIT.

<text>Arthur Cushman McGiffert (March 4, 18611933), American theologian, was born in Sauquoit, New York, the son of a Presbyterian clergyman of Scots-Irish descent.

==Biography==
He graduated at Western Reserve College in 1882 and at Union Theological Seminary in 1885, studied in Germany (especially under Harnack) in 1885–1887, and in Italy and France in 1888, and in that year received the degree of doctor of philosophy at Marburg. He was instructor (1888-1890) and professor (1890-1893) of church history at Lane Theological Seminary, and in 1893 became Washburn professor of church history in Union theological seminary, succeeding Philip Schaff. He became the 8th president of Union Seminary in 1917

He died in Dobbs Ferry, New York, on February 25, 1933, at the age of 71.
==Career==

His published work, except occasional critical studies in philosophy, dealt with church history and the history of dogma. His best known publication is a &quot;History of Christianity in the Apostolic Age&quot; (1897). This book, which sustains critical historical eminence to this day, by its independent criticism and departures from traditionalism, aroused the opposition of the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church; though the charges brought against McGiffert were dismissed by the Presbytery of New York, to which they had been referred, a trial for heresy seemed inevitable, and McGiffert, in 1900, retired from the Presbyterian ministry and retained his credentialed status by eager recognition from a Congregational Church. Likewise he retained his distinguished position at Union Theological Seminary.

&quot;A History of Christian Thought&quot; constituted a two volume work (1932, 1933) which established an American standard in theological studies and is still cited regularly by scholars. Among his other publications are: &quot;A Dialogue between a Christian and a Jew&quot; (1888); a translation (with introduction and notes) of Eusebius&#x27;s &quot;Church History&quot; (1890; part of Philip Schaff&#x27;s &quot;Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers&quot; series); and &quot;The Apostle&#x27;s Creed&quot; (1902), in which he attempted to prove that the old Roman creed was formulated as a protest against the dualism of Marcion and his denial of the reality of Jesus&#x27;s life on earth.

<text>YTA TV (an initialism for its former full name, Youtoo America; commonly referred to as just YTA) is an American television network which originally launched in February 1985 as a cable channel. Unusual for a network of its type, it has had multiple identities, programming directions, and brandings, along with owners, and after merging with the minor broadcast network America One in 2014, transitioning from a cable-only network to free over-the-air television. It is owned by Center Post Media, which also owns Biz Television.

Approximately 41 million households have reception of YTA TV in some manner through cable or over-the-air reception. It is also available through streaming apps on various digital media players, and on its website.

== Background ==

===Nostalgia Channel===

The channel was originally launched as a cable channel in February 1985 as The Nostalgia Channel through the efforts of former &quot;Our Gang&quot; child star George &quot;Spanky&quot; McFarland. The channel featured vintage movies, similar to American Movie Classics, which debuted five months earlier as a premium channel broadcasting only during the afternoon and nighttime hours, and Turner Classic Movies, which would launch nine years later. Many of the films were in the public domain.

Michael E. Marcovsky was hired as network head in early 1990. He changed the channel&#x27;s name to Nostalgia Television, removed movies with poor quality prints (primarily public domain movies), and added lifestyle series as well as vintage TV programs. Also, 100 movies were programmed from the eclectic Janus Collection. At this time, movies were 25% of the programming.

===Unification Church===

In December 1993, International Family Entertainment, Inc. was bidding against a partnership of Florida-based MOR Music TV Inc. and Arizona-based Gen-She Inc., and owner Concept Communications (owned by Unification Church) for the network. Nostalgia Television changed its name to Nostalgia Good TV in 1997.

Nostalgia licensed the Goodlife trademark and changed its name to Goodlife TV in 1998 when Unification Church purchased the rest of the company. In 2004, Goodlife TV announced that it would sign a licensing agreement and partnership with Warner Bros. Domestic Television Distribution to broadcast its classic television shows on the channel. Following the expiration of the Goodlife licensing agreement in 2005 with no renewal, the channel changed names again to American Life TV (ALTV).

According to a June 2007 story in &quot;Variety&quot;, the network was a consistent money-loser, although the church&#x27;s tax-exempt status made it easier to absorb the losses. The channel charged providers one of the lowest carriage fees in the industry (between 5-10¢), but despite this, was only available in 10 million households at that time. Comcast refused to carry the channel, citing the lack of quality programming (at that time, made up mainly of public domain programming and anachronistic sitcoms and dramas in barter arrangements, long dropped from higher-profile networks) and dropped it from the systems it acquired in the Adelphia bankruptcy as soon as contractually possible. Despite improving the quality of their programming by picking up the Steven Bochco series &quot;L.A. Law&quot;, &quot;Hill Street Blues&quot;, &quot;St. Elsewhere&quot; and equity for carriage, both DirecTV and Dish continued to refuse carriage.

In 2001, ALTV broadcast the Unification Church-sponsored film &quot;Inchon&quot; (1982), one of the few times it has been seen since its initial theatrical run. In 2007 the network broadcast George Clooney&#x27;s documentary, &quot;A Journey to Darfur&quot;. It released the film on DVD in 2008 and announced that proceeds from its sale would be donated to the International Rescue Committee for its humanitarian efforts in Darfur. In 2007, ALN made a video on demand deal with TVN Entertainment Corporation to offer up to 20 hours of programming per month to more than 100 cable affiliates.

===ComStar===

In May 2009, the network was acquired by ComStar Media Fund, an organization chaired by Robert A. Schuller, son of Crystal Cathedral founder Robert H. Schuller. Schuller said that the network would concentrate on &quot;family-values programming that speaks to all generations.&quot; On November 29 Schuller&#x27;s new program &quot;Everyday Life&quot; was first seen on ALTV.

Chris Wyatt, ComStar&#x27;s chief executive officer and founder of religious website Godtube, commented: &quot;We are not creating another religious network but rather a family-values channel. We&#x27;ve tapped into a huge underserved market and have the opportunity over time to increase distribution to exceed 40 million homes.&quot; Media reports indicated that the network&#x27;s on-air presentation would change and that other syndicated series would be targeted for acquisition.

On December 1, 2009, ALN announced that it would start airing episodes of Chuck Norris&#x27; &quot;World Combat League&quot;, previously seen on the Versus network. ComStar also has access to a library of classic television programing including &quot;Happy Days&quot; and &quot;My Three Sons&quot;. Some of the older television shows moved from ALN to its sister network, FamilyNet on March 1, 2010, when it was spun out into its own company with Robert A. Schuller as the chairman.

===Youtoo===
On September 27, 2011, ALN was rebranded as Youtoo TV with a focus on mobile devices; as of that date, all links to the website redirected to a page inviting viewers to sign up for the new service at youtoo.com. The only &quot;retro&quot; programs remaining on the schedule are &quot;Batman&quot;, &quot;The Green Hornet&quot;, and &quot;The X-Files&quot;.

Executives claim Youtoo TV to be a social television service, allowing viewers to participate in television programming using personal electronic devices. Interactive features include the ability for viewers to create and submit 15-second videos, called &quot;Fame Spots&quot;, commenting on a variety of subjects, which will air.

In addition, the network will carry programming such as &quot;Howcast&quot; and Christopher Coppola&#x27;s &quot;Digivangelist Show&quot;. Also on the network will be new TV versions of Web series including &quot;GeekBeat.TV&quot;, &quot;Koldcast&quot;, and &quot;Rooftop Media&quot;. The network also will have interactive programs including &quot;Say Yes &amp; Marry Me&quot;, which will offer viewers the opportunity to propose marriage on-air via Fame Spots. Re-purposed programming from Revision3 was removed from the network after that provider&#x27;s sale to Discovery Communications in 2012.

One of the creators of Youtoo TV is producer Mark Burnett, through his own social media project, by content marketing studio VIMBY.

It was reported in September 2014 that Youtoo TV had acquired America One, its network of terrestrial (mostly low-power) affiliates, and most of its remaining, non-sports programming. (Prior to this, only one terrestrial affiliate, WBQP-CD, carried Youtoo over the air.) The merger was finalized in Spring 2015, with the resulting network becoming &quot;Youtoo America&quot;. Over the course of late 2019 and early 2020, it began using the shortened branding of YTA, presumably due to confusion with YouTube and its similarly named YouTube TV streaming service, and channel drift away from the 2011 social television model.

==Carriage==
The network is available on Time Warner Cable and Comcast, among other providers. Charter Communications previously carried the channel until November 15, 2011, when the channel was dropped from Charter&#x27;s lineups; this decision was made before the re-brand of ALN, as the channel received carriage under that provider&#x27;s &quot;faith and values&quot;/religious tier of networks and no longer carried religious or family-appropriate programming for a majority of the broadcast day. At the launch of Youtoo, the network offered up to $200 in bill credits to viewers who switched to a provider that offered the network. As per an email sent to its subscribers, Verizon FiOS dropped the channel on December 31, 2012, along with MAVTV, and Blue Highways TV.

YTA TV offers a live feed of its programming on the Internet, along with some on-demand programming behind a soft paywall.

==Programming==
YTA TV currently provides 20 hours of programming every day from 6:00 a.m. to 2:00 a.m. Eastern Time, with overnight hours being occupied by a simulcast of the shopping channel Shop LC.

<text>Union Pier is an unincorporated community in Berrien County in the U.S. state of Michigan. It is situated between the Lake Michigan shore and the Galien River about five miles north of the Indiana state border.

The ZIP code is 49129 and the FIPS place code is 81400.
==History==
During the summer of 1914 a colony of Chicago bohemians, including the writers Sherwood Anderson and Ben Hecht, vacationed at the &quot;Camp&#x27;s Cottages&quot; (for the owner Eli Camp) on the Union Pier beach. The local residents were outraged by what they believed were the wild goings-on at &quot;The Nudist Club,&quot; as they characterized it, particularly after two local men left their wives for women staying at Camp&#x27;s. The locals made the situation sufficiently uncomfortable for the vacationers that they did not return the next year.

After the end of World War II, many Lithuanian immigrants began settling in Union Pier. Although few Lithuanian-Americans remain today, several Lithuanian facilities remain, such as Milda&#x27;s Corner Market and Gintaras Resort.
==Education==
Most children attend New Buffalo Elementary (K-5), Middle (6-8), and High School (9-12), which make up New Buffalo Area Schools. Some attend River Valley School District, which is made up of Chikaming Elementary School (PK-2) in Sawyer, and Three Oaks Elementary (3-5) and River Valley High School (6-12) in Three Oaks, Michigan.

<text>Samuel Rolles Driver (2 October 1846 – 26 February 1914) was an English divine and Hebrew scholar. He devoted his life to the study, both textual and critical, of the Old Testament. He was the father of Sir Godfrey Rolles Driver, also a distinguished biblical scholar.

==Biography==
Samuel Rolles Driver was born in Southampton. He was educated at Winchester and New College, Oxford, where he had a distinguished career, receiving a first-class degree in Literae Humaniores in 1869. He was awarded the Pusey and Ellerton scholarship in 1866, the Kennicott scholarship in 1870 (both Hebrew), and the Houghton Syriac prize in 1872. From 1870 he was a fellow, and from 1875 also a tutor, of New College, and in 1883 succeeded Pusey as Regius Professor of Hebrew and canon of Christ Church, Oxford until his death in 1914.

He was a member of the Old Testament Revision Committee of the Revised Version (1876–1884) and examining chaplain to the Bishop of Southwell (1884–1904). He received the honorary degrees of doctor of literature of the University of Dublin (1892), doctor of divinity of the University of Glasgow (1901), and doctor of literature of the University of Cambridge (1905), and was elected a fellow of the British Academy in 1902.

Driver married Mabel, daughter of Edmund Barr, of Burgh, near Aylsham, Norfolk, in 1891; they had two sons and two daughters. He died at Oxford in 1914.

<text>Skinning is the act of skin removal. The process is done by humans to animals, mainly as a means to prepare the meat beneath for cooking and consumption, or to harvest the skin for making fur clothing or tanning it to make leather. The skin may also be used as a trophy or taxidermy, sold on the fur market, or, in the case of a declared pest, used as proof of kill to obtain a bounty from a government health, agricultural, or game agency.

Two common methods of skinning are open skinning and case skinning. Typically, large animals are open skinned and smaller animals are case skinned.

Skinning, when it is performed on live humans as a form of torture, murder or capital punishment, is referred to as &quot;flaying&quot;.

== Skinning methods ==
&quot;Case skinning&quot; is a method where the skin is peeled from the animal like a sock. This method is usually used if the animal is going to be stretched out or put in dry storage. Many smaller animals are case skinned, leaving the skin mostly undamaged in the shape of a tube.

Although the methods of case skinning individual animals vary slightly, the general steps remain the same. To case skin an animal, it is hung upside down by its feet. A cut is made in one foot, and continued up the leg, around the anus and down the other leg. From there the skin is pulled down the animal as though removing a sweater.

&quot;Open skinning&quot; is a method where the skin is removed from the animal like a jacket. This method is generally used if the skin is going to be tanned immediately or frozen for storage. A skin removed by the open method can be used for wall hangings or rugs. Larger animals are often skinned using the open method.

To open skin an animal, the body is placed on a flat surface. A cut is made from the anus to the lower lip, and up the legs of the animal. The skin is then opened and removed from the animal.

The final step is to scrape the excess fat and flesh from the inside of the skin with a blunt stone or bone tool.

&quot;Dorsal skinning&quot; is very similar to open skinning, however instead of making a cut up the stomach of the animal, the cut is made along the spine. This method of skinning is very popular among taxidermists, as the backbone is easier to access and cleaner than the stomach and between the legs.
A dorsal incision is made by laying the animal on its abdomen and making a single cut from the base of the tail to the shoulder region. The animal&#x27;s skin is easier to remove if the animal has been freshly killed.

&quot;Cape skinning&quot; is the process of removing the shoulder, neck and head skin for the purpose of displaying the animal as a trophy.

==Animal skins and Native Americans==
Native Americans used skins for many purposes other than decoration, clothing and blankets. Animal skin was a staple in the Native Americans&#x27; daily lives. It was used to make tents, to build boats, to make bags, to create musical instruments such as drums, and to make quivers.

Since Native Americans were practiced in the means of acquiring and manipulating animal skin, fur trading developed from contact between them and Europeans in the 16th century. Animal skin was a valuable currency which the Native Americans had in excess and would trade for things such as iron-based tools and tobacco which were common in the more developed European areas. Beaver hats became very popular towards the end of the 16th century, and skinning beavers was necessary to acquire their wool. In this time, the beaver skin drastically rose in demand and in value. However, the high number of beavers being harvested for their pelts led to a depletion of beavers, and the industry had to slow down.

<doc id="929018" wikidata="Q1408847" url="?curid=929018" title="National Redoubt (Belgium)">
<text>The National Redoubt (, ) was a strategic defensive belt of fortifications built in Belgium. The National redoubt was the infrastructural cornerstone of Belgian defensive strategy from 1890–1940.

The following fortifications and defensive constructions were an integral part of the National Redoubt at different times: 
* the Fortified Position of Liège (Luik) with a number of forts 
* the Fortified Position of Namur (Namen) with a number of forts
* Fort Eben-Emael
* the K-W line: a &quot;canal&quot; from Koningshooikt to Wavre, to defend against tank incursions
* another anti-tank canal in the Kempen, roughly aligned with the outer ring of fortifications around Antwerpen
* the coastal defenses as a retreat position against invasion troops
The most important part of the national redoubt was a double ring of defensive forts around the city and port of Antwerp.

The National Redoubt was a -long belt of fortifications built from 1859 to 1914, as the strongest defensive position of Belgium in case of invasion.
==Background==
Until the autonomy of Belgium in 1830 the defence of Antwerp consisted of the citadel and the Spanish city walls near the current De Leien (Italiëlei, Frankrijklei, Britselei, Amerikalei) bounded on the south by the Zuidkasteel (just north of the current Palace of Justice) and bounded on the north side by the Noorderfort, around the area of the current Kattendijkdok. The forts Liefkenshoek, De Perel, St. Marie and St. Philip were built during the Eighty Years War in 1584 by the Duke of Parma (Alexander Farnese) to block the supply of (the Hollanders in) Antwerp. These forts were in the bend of the river Scheldt in Kallo.
===Independent Belgium===
From 1830 to the mid-19th century, the defence of Belgium consisted of twenty fortified cities (called the Wellington Barrier), which were to form a defence against France. The defence of Antwerp was also aimed at the river Scheldt. This function was fulfilled by the forts De Perel, Burcht, Isabella and Saint Marie. The Scheldt defence was complemented by the development of the Vlaams Hoofd Fort, west of the current terminus of the St. Anna Tunnel.

===Act of 1851===
Halfway through the 19th century after the emergence of Napoleon III in 1851, it was clear that the Belgian army did not have the capability to resist an attack from France. It was necessary to centralise defences and so a ring of fortresses around Antwerp, &quot;forten 1-7&quot;, were originally built as earthen ramparts but later reinforced by stone structures.

===Act of 8 September 1859===
In the mid-19th century, the concept of defence was changed, because a full defence of Belgium was not considered feasible. Antwerp was the most appropriate as the last stronghold (&quot;réduit national&quot;) until the aid of allies could arrive. The choice of Antwerp was motivated by its good supply and defence possibilities. The National Reduit (Act of 8 September 1859) would consist of a siege wall, a circle of fortresses and inundations. The fort circle would consist of eight Brialmont forts (named after the architect of the forts H.A. Brialmont) in an 18 km long circle from Wijnegem to Hoboken. The forts were built from 1859 to 1864.

===Act of 1870===
The Franco-Prussian War in 1870 showed that the German artillery could bombard Paris from a distance of 7 km. The circle of Brialmont forts was thus too close to the city centre. Initially, it was decided to build the forts Merksem, Zwijndrecht, and Kruibeke. In addition, the Scheldt Defence was extended with the forts St. Philip and De Perel (both rebuilt). They were small oblong armored fortresses, against enemy warships and were to be heavily armed with 24 and 28 cm guns. De Perel, however, was never equipped with guns at all.

===1878 to 1905===
In 1872, the idea of the Rupel Neteline as defence line was proposed with the around lying polders as defence by inundation. However, the means lacked to proceed directly with the construction. In 1878, construction started of three forts in Walem, Lier and (from 1882) Steendorp. The construction of Fort Schoten was started in 1885. In 1886 the redoubt Duffel was built to defend the railway line Antwerp-Brussels. Three more redoubts (Oorderen, Berendrecht and Kapellen) were built respectively to defend the inundatable polders and the dykes and the railway line to the Netherlands.

Finally, the Act of 1902 started the construction of the forts Sint Katelijne Waver and Stabroek, but they were not fully completed and armed in 1914.

==Prelude==
===Act of 30 March 1906===
The development of newer weapons was so fast that in 1900 a committee was established to review the defence of Antwerp. This committee considered the defence of Antwerp to be inadequate, but did not propose a solution. Eventually the government in May 1905 submitted a proposal, which proposed the demolition of the Brialmont wall and the construction of a security circle around the forts 1-8 and the Rupel-Nete line as the first defence line. This plan was ratified by Act of 30 March 1906. The plan provided for the construction of 11 new forts and 12 new redoubts. This so-called Hoofdweerstandstelling included in total on the east bank of the river Scheldt 16 forts and 10 redoubts and on the west bank 5 forts and 2 redoubts.

===Structure of the forts and redoubts===

====Brialmont forts====
Classical fortifications had an approximately rectangular shape. A good example of a rectangular fort with artillery positions on the corners is Fort Liefkenshoek of the 16th century. The gradual evolution in the fort construction in the 19th century led to two schools, the &#x27;French&#x27; and &#x27;German&#x27;. The German forts had a polygonal structure with caponiers. The French forts had a bastioned construction. Brialmont in 1846 visited Germany where he took notice of the German way of construction.
The forts had multiple functions. They were created for long range defence, support fire between the forts and ditch and short range defence. The design was adapted to these functions.
On the outside the forts were protected by 40–50 m wide ditches, which were to obstruct a direct assault. On the outside of the ditch the ground was sloping (the glacis) to enable direct fire on any enemy. On the inside of the ditch walls were raised up to 10 m height to protect the inside of the fort against direct fire. The artillery was placed on and behind the walls.

The actual fort had a polygonal structure. The main building of the fort was the réduit within the fort with the quarters for the crew of the fort in peacetime and as last defence if the enemy had already penetrated within the perimeter of the fort. This réduit was manufactured in brick. It was defended by guns on the roof.
The guns were placed at the outer sides of the fort. The main armament was at the front (from which the enemy was expected) behind the earthworks.
This armament was placed in the main caponier (a kind of bunker with a thickness of 2.5 to 3m) in the middle of the main front. The main front had a width of about 350 m. At the sides of the main front are two half caponiers. On the main front about thirty guns and mortars for the long distance defence were placed. Both the main caponier and the half caponiers were constructed in a bunker with cannon cellars.
At the rear end the fort could be supplied via a bridge over the canal. To protect the rear two low batteries were placed for ditch defence.
The later forts such as the barrier-forts have a similar structure but without réduit.
The forts were connected by the R11 military road, thereafter developed into a small green outer ring for Antwerp.

===Act of 1906===

The construction of these forts began in 1909 after the expropriation of land. The works were performed by the firm Bolsée from Antwerp. The forts are very similar, with some exceptions. The forts were built in 2.5 m unreinforced concrete, which would offer resistance to 28 cm caliber shells. Most fortresses are known as so-called second order forts with a main armament turret for two 15 cm guns, two turrets for 12 cm howitzers and four turrets for a 7.5 cm gun. The so-called first order forts had an extra turret for two 15 cm guns and two additional turrets with a 7.5 cm gun.
The 15 cm and 12 cm howitzer guns were placed at the main front.
On the flanks of the main front caponiers were placed for ditch defence. These are in the following types: composite casemated caponiers, caponiers with turrets (Fort Bornem) and detached (Forts Stabroek, St. Katelijne Waver and &#x27;s Gravenwezel) or attached reverscaponiers (Forts Brasschaat and Kessel).
Fort Bornem has a different structure with a pseudo-bastioned front with turrets on the caponiers.

===Armament===
The forts had a multitude of functions:
* Long-range defence
* Fire support between the forts themselves
* Short range and canal defence
The first forts 1-8 (Act of 1859) originally had no fixed artillery. The artillery consisted of mobile field artillery. Developments in the gun caliber had been taken into account in the construction by an increased ground cover. In the later forts fixed artillery is used.

The main developments in the field of artillery were:
* From 1885, instead of gunpowder, picric acid or nitrocellulose was used.
* The shells had explosive action by using TNT.
* In Germany, the first drawn-steel gun barrels were manufactured, which replaced cast iron and bronze barrels. Gun caliber, thus, could be increased. The effect of a shell impact increased greatly.
Development of chemistry and metallurgy dramatically changed the cannon, which, until the mid 19th century, had barely changed.

The artillery developments necessitated adjustments to the forts. From 1890 fixed artillery was used. Partly, the artillery was placed in turrets, partly mounted separately. From 1890 the thickness of the concrete vaults was brought up to 2.25 to 2.5 m. The heaviest guns at the time were 21 cm (Krupp) or 22 cm (mortar Le Creusot). The forts had to be able to resist shells of this caliber. However, the developments went very fast. In 1905 the Japanese during the siege of Port Arthur used 28 cm guns. Shortly before the First World War Germany already had 30.5 and even 42 cm caliber ( &quot;Big Bertha &quot;). Trials in Russia in 1912 with a Belgian turret showed that it could not withstand 28 cm guns. Although the military leadership was aware of it, this information was ignored. The military could do nothing, since further modifications to the forts were not possible.

The Belgian forts did not have such heavy artillery as the Germans. Because they had a defensive purpose, the heaviest artillery gun used was 15 cm caliber. Only the fortifications for the Scheldt defence (forts De Perel, St. Philip) had 24 and 28 cm guns and Fort Schoten had 21 cm guns. The forts around Liege and Namur had 21 cm howitzers, but with relatively limited range of 6.9 kilometers. The armament of the forts of the outer circle (Act of 1906) for the long range consisted of one or two turrets with two 15 cm guns (39 kg shells, with a range of 8.4 kilometers), two turrets for a 12 cm howitzer (20 kg shells, range 6.4 kilometers), four or six gun turrets for a 7.5 cm gun, (5.5 kg shells; range 6 km), two observation clocks. In addition there was a ditch defence of sixteen 5.7 cm guns (2.7 kg shells, range 2.2 kilometers, especially used with grape-shot for the short range) and support fire between the forts (two 7.5 cm and two 12 cm guns).

==First World War==

At the outbreak of war in 1914, the Germans first attacked the forts at Liege. The Germans were equipped with 30.5 cm (Skoda M1911 howitzers lent by Austria, with a range of 9.6 kilometers) and 42 cm (the Big Bertha, range 10 km) caliber guns, with shells respectively 380 kg and 1000 kg. These were able to destroy the fortresses of non-reinforced concrete. They could be deployed while outside the reach of the Belgian artillery. On 15 August 1914 Fort Loncin was destroyed by a German hit on its ammunition depot. 350 men were killed immediately, and half of the fort was destroyed. To this day, the remains of these men remain buried in the ruins of the fort.

After establishing a defensive line near Liege, the Germans marched westward, and on September 4 the first shells were aimed at the axis Walem-Breendonk. Then, for a couple of weeks, the Germans concentrated on the front in France. On September 22, the attack on the defence of Antwerp was renewed but now focused on Walem-Lier, with the intention of breaking the ring of forts and capturing Antwerp. On September 30, German heavy artillery destroyed the forts of Walem, Sint Katelijne Waver and Koningshooikt. On October 2, Fort Lier suffered the same fate. Fort Kessel fell on October 4. On October 5, the bombardment of Fort Broechem started. On October 6, Fort Broechem was put out of action. The position of Antwerp then became untenable.

On October 9, the Belgian Army abandoned the east bank of the river Scheldt, blowing up the forts of Schoten, Brasschaat, Merksem, Kapellen and Lillo. In all, the Germans had fired 590 rounds of ammunition and 2,130 shells onto the forts, whose garrisons were helpless against an enemy who bombarded them from a distance. But the forts did enable the Belgian Army to escape; on October 10, it abandoned the west bank of the Scheldt and retreated behind the Yser line, about 150 km to the west, where it would resist for the rest of the war.

==Interbellum and Second World War==
===1918–1939===
In the First World War the vulnerability of the forts had become evident. The development of artillery went faster than the construction of resistant fortifications. The concept of forts had become redundant. After the First World War the forts were therefore no longer seen as a defence line, but the role of the forts would be in the form of infantry support.

Between the two world wars minor modifications were carried out to the forts. This involved:
* Rearmament, where parts of the old guns were replaced by the placement of light and heavy machine guns. The old gun turrets were replaced by so-called Abri élémentaires, half circular armored bunkers. Six of these were built per fort.
* Locally improving the armor with reinforced concrete,
* Placement of ventilation and installation of gas-tight rooms.
The forts also served as warehouses.
Furthermore, the defence was strengthened by the anti-tank ditch, which ran from Berendrecht (at the former redoubt Berendrecht) to the Albert canal at Massenhoven. The anti-tank ditch runs in a circle around Antwerp at a distance of 15 km from Antwerp centre. The length is 33 km. The anti-tank ditch has 15 locks to regulate the water level. These locks were defended by bunkers. Of these thirteen were built, two of which have since been scrapped. The two remaining locks were defended by nearby forts or redoubts. The lock bunkers were armed with three 13.2 mm machine guns.

===1940===
In the Second World War, the forts played a limited role. After the attack on Belgium, the Belgian army retreated on May 14 behind the Albert Canal to the defense line Koningshooikt-Wavre. Because the Germans on May 13 broke the Maginot Line at Sedan, the army decided to withdraw further and abandon Antwerp and the Koningshooikt-Wavre line. On May 16 and 17 several forts came into action primarily to cover the retreat of the army to the Westhoek.

The Germans maintained the fortifications well during World War II. Some were used as storage. Fort Breendonk was used as a transit camp for deportation to Germany. In Fort Breendonk (ca. 300) executions were carried out. Currently, Fort Breendonk is a national memorial.

==Present==
The small forts 1–7 were demolished during the construction of the Brialmont wall, except fort 2, of which the reduit is part of the current sports arena. The Brialmont forts 2–8 still exist. Fort 1 (Wijnegem) was demolished in 1959 (when it was 100 years old) during the construction of the Wijnegem shopping centre and the extension of the N12 and R11 roads.
Of the forts of the Act of 1870 Merksem, Kruibeke, St. Philip and Zwijndrecht still exist. De Perel fort was blown up in the Second World War by the Germans, and its last remains were demolished in 1958. All forts from the period 1877–1883 (Walem, Lier, Steendorp (formerly also called Rupelmonde) and Schoten) are extant. Of the period 1883–1893 the redoubts in Duffel and Kapellen remain. The Oordenen and Berendrecht redoubts were demolished in connection with the expansion of the port of Antwerp.
All forts built between 1906 and 1914 still exist. Massenhoven redoubt was demolished for the construction of a reservoir along the Albert canal. All other redoubts also still exist. The Smoutakker and Schilde redoubts were blown up by the retreating Belgians in the First World War.

Of the Brialmont forts 2–8 two are museums, two are nature reserves, one is communal property, one a recreation area and one the property of the University of Antwerp. Of the forts from the period after 1870 two are still a military domain, one a recreation complex and one a nature reserve. Of the forts from the period 1877–1883 one isa military domain, one a nature reserve, one communal property (formerly Ministry of Finance) and one is owned by a shooting club (plus radio amateurs). Kapellen redoubt is a military domain, while Duffel redoubt is private and will be opened to public after maintenance financed by European funds. The site of Sint Katelijne Waver fort has been filled with and holiday cabins. Fort van Stabroek is used for paintballing). Of the forts from the period 1906-1914, three are still in military use, one has been built over with recreation houses, one with fishing houses, two serve as museums, two are private property and three are recreation areas. Many of the forts now serve as hibernation reserves for bats. This is the case for five of the Brialmont forts 2–8 and for 11 of the later forts. Fort Brasschaat hosts the largest number of hibernating bats, between 800 and 900. The other forts accommodate fewer, between 20 and over 300.

<doc id="929022" wikidata="Q1813564" url="?curid=929022" title="Skeletal animation">
<text>Skeletal animation or rigging is a technique in computer animation in which a character (or other articulated object) is represented in two parts: a polygonal or parametric mesh representation of the surface of the object, and a hierarchical set of interconnected parts (called joints or bones, and collectively forming the skeleton), a virtual armature used to animate (pose and keyframe) the mesh. While this technique is often used to animate humans and other organic figures, it only serves to make the animation process more intuitive, and the same technique can be used to control the deformation of any object—such as a door, a spoon, a building, or a galaxy. When the animated object is more general than, for example, a humanoid character, the set of &quot;bones&quot; may not be hierarchical or interconnected, but simply represent a higher-level description of the motion of the part of mesh it is influencing.

The technique was introduced in 1988 by Nadia Magnenat Thalmann, Richard Laperrière, and Daniel Thalmann. This technique is used in virtually all animation systems where simplified user interfaces allows animators to control often complex algorithms and a huge amount of geometry; most notably through inverse kinematics and other &quot;goal-oriented&quot; techniques. 

== Technique ==
As described in an instructional article by Josh Petty:
This technique constructs a series of bones (which need not correspond to any real-world anatomical feature), sometimes also referred to as rigging in the noun sense. Each bone has a three-dimensional transformation from the default bind pose (which includes its position, scale and orientation), and an optional parent bone. The bones therefore form a hierarchy. The full transform of a child node is the product of its parent transform and its own transform. So moving a thigh-bone will move the lower leg too. As the character is animated, the bones change their transformation over time, under the influence of some animation controller. A rig is generally composed of both forward kinematics and inverse kinematics parts that may interact with each other. Skeletal animation is referring to the forward kinematics part of the rig, where a complete set of bone configurations identifies a unique pose.

Each bone in the skeleton is associated with some portion of the character&#x27;s visual representation (the mesh) in a process called skinning. In the most common case of a polygonal mesh character, the bone is associated with a group of vertices; for example, in a model of a human being, the bone for the thigh would be associated with the vertices making up the polygons in the model&#x27;s thigh. Portions of the character&#x27;s skin can normally be associated with multiple bones, each one having a scaling factors called vertex weights, or blend weights. The movement of skin near the joints of two bones, can therefore be influenced by both bones. In most state-of-the-art graphical engines, the skinning process is done on the GPU by a shader program.

For a polygonal mesh, each vertex can have a blend weight for each bone. To calculate the final position of the vertex, a transformation matrix is created for each bone which, when applied to the vertex, first puts the vertex in bone space then puts it back into mesh space. After applying a matrix to the vertex, it is scaled by its corresponding weight. This algorithm is called matrix-palette skinning or linear-blend skinning, because the set of bone transformations (stored as transform matrices) form a palette for the skin vertex to choose from.

=== Benefits and drawbacks ===
==== Strengths ====
* A bone represents a set of vertices (or some other object which represents something, such as a leg),
** The animator needs to control fewer characteristics of the model,
*** The animator can focus on the large-scale motion,
** Bones are independently movable.
* An animation can be defined by simple movements of the bones, instead of vertex by vertex (in the case of a polygonal mesh).

==== Weaknesses ====
* A bone can only represent a set of vertices (or some other precisely defined object), and is not more abstract or conceptual.
** Does not provide realistic muscle movement and skin motion. Possible solutions to this problem:
*** Special muscle controllers attached to the bones.
*** Consultation with physiology experts, to increase accuracy of musculoskeletal realism with more thorough virtual anatomy simulations.

== Applications ==
Skeletal animation is the standard way to animate characters or mechanical objects for a prolonged period of time. It is commonly used by video game artists and in the film industry, and can also be applied to mechanical objects and any other objects made up of rigid elements and joints.

Performance capture (or motion capture) can speed up the process of skeletal animation, as well as increasing the level of realism.

Rigs may be driven by ragdoll physics which automatically calculate physics of motion and resistance with skeletal frames. Virtual anatomy properties such as weight of limbs, muscle reaction, bone strength, and joint constraints may be added for realistic bouncing, buckling, fracture, and tumbling effects. 

Some popular software packages within which rigs may be created include Blender, Autodesk Maya, SideFX Houdini, Autodesk 3ds Max, Maxon Cinema 4D, Unreal Engine, and many others.

<doc id="929037" wikidata="Q857497" url="?curid=929037" title="Cephalaspidomorphi">
<text>Cephalaspidomorphs are a group of jawless fishes named for &quot;Cephalaspis&quot; of the osteostracans. Most biologists regard this taxon as extinct, but the name is sometimes used in the classification of lampreys, because lampreys were once thought to be related to cephalaspids. If lampreys are included, they would extend the known range of the group from the Silurian and Devonian periods to the present day. They are the closest relatives of jawed fishes, who may have emerged from within them; if this is true, they would survive if the jawed fish are included.

==Biology and morphology==

Cephalaspidomorphs were, like most contemporary fishes, very well armored. The head shield was particularly well developed, protecting the head, gills and the anterior section of the viscera. The body was in most forms well armored as well. The head shield had a series of grooves over the whole surface, forming an extensive lateral line organ. The eyes were rather small and placed on the top of the head. There was no jaw proper. The mouth opening was surrounded by small plates, making the lips flexible, but without any ability to bite.

No internal skeleton is known, outside of the head shield. If they had a vertebral column at all, it would have been cartilage rather than bone. Likely, the axial skeleton consisted of an unsegmented notochord. A fleshy appendage emerged laterally on each side, behind the head shield, functioning as pectoral fins. The tail had a single, wrap-around tail-fin. Modern fishes with such a tail are rarely quick swimmers, and the Cephalaspidomorphs were not likely very active animals. They probably spent much of their time semi-submerged in the mud. They also lacked a swim bladder, and would not have been able to keep afloat without actively swimming. The head shield provided some lift though and would have made the Cephalaspidomorphs better swimmers than most of their contemporaries. The whole group were likely algae- or filter-feeders, combing the bottom for small animals, much like the modern armored bottom feeders, such as Loricariidae or &quot;Hoplosternum&quot; catfish.

== Classification ==
In the 1920s, the biologists Johan Kiær and Erik Stensiö first recognized the Cephalaspidomorphi as including the osteostracans, anaspids, and lampreys, because all three groups share a single dorsal &quot;nostril&quot;, now known as a nasohypophysial opening.

Since then, opinions on the relations among jawless vertebrates have varied. Most workers have come to regard Agnatha as paraphyletic, having given rise to the jawed fishes. Because of shared features such as paired fins, the origins of the jawed vertebrates may lie close to Cephalaspidomorphi. Many biologists no longer use the name Cephalaspidomorphi because relations among Osteostraci and Anaspida are unclear, and the affinities of the lampreys are also contested. Others have restricted the cephalaspidomorphs to include only groups more clearly related to the Osteostraci, such as Galeaspida and Pituriaspida, that were largely unknown in the 1920s.

== Lampreys ==
Some reference works and databases have regarded Cephalaspidomorphi as a Linnean class whose sole living representatives are the lampreys. Evidence now suggests that lampreys acquired the characters they share with cephalaspids by convergent evolution.

As such, many newer works about fishes classify lampreys in a separate group called Petromyzontida or Hyperoartia.

<text>Benjamin Kennicott (4 April 171818 September 1783) was an English churchman and Hebrew scholar.

==Life==
Kennicott was born at Totnes, Devon where he attended Totnes Grammar School. He succeeded his father as master of a charity school, but the generosity of some friends enabled him to go to Wadham College, Oxford, in 1744, and he distinguished himself in Hebrew and divinity. While an undergraduate he published two dissertations, &quot;On the Tree of Life in Paradise, with some Observations on the Fall of Man&quot;, and &quot;On the Oblations of Cain and Abel&quot;, which obtained him a B.A. before the statutory time.

In 1747 Kennicott was elected a fellow of Exeter College, Oxford, and in 1750 he took his degree of M.A. In 1764 he was made a fellow of the Royal Society, and in 1767 keeper of the Radcliffe Library. He was also a canon of Christ Church, Oxford (1770), and rector of Culham (1753) in Oxfordshire, and was subsequently given the living of Menheniot, Cornwall, which he was unable to visit and resigned two years before his death.

==Works==
Kennicott&#x27;s major work is the &quot;Vetus Testamentum hebraicum cum variis lectionibus&quot; (1776–1780). Before this appeared he had written two dissertations entitled &quot;The State of the Printed Hebrew Text of the Old Testament considered&quot;, published respectively in 1753 and 1759, which were designed to combat contemporary ideas as to the &quot;absolute integrity&quot; of the received Hebrew text. The first contains &quot;a comparison of I Chron. xi. with 2 Sam. v. and xxiii. and observations on seventy manuscripts, with an extract of mistakes and various readings&quot;; the second defends the claims of the Samaritan Pentateuch, assails the correctness of the printed copies of the Aramaic translation, gives an account of Hebrew manuscripts of the Bible known to be extant, and catalogues one hundred manuscripts preserved in the British Museum and in the libraries of Oxford and Cambridge.
In 1760 Kennicott issued proposals for collating all Hebrew manuscripts of date prior to the invention of printing. Subscriptions to the amount of nearly £10,000 were obtained, and many scholars agreed to participate, of Helmstedt making himself specially useful as regarded manuscripts in Germany, Switzerland and Italy. Between 1760 and 1769 ten &quot;annual accounts&quot; of the progress of the work were given; in its course 615 Hebrew manuscripts and 52 printed editions of the Bible were either wholly or partially collated, and use was also made (but often very perfunctorily) of the quotations in the Talmud.

The materials thus collected, when arranged and prepared for the press, extended to 30 volumes. The text finally followed in printing was that of Van der Hooght—unpointed however, the points having been disregarded in collation—and the various readings were printed at the foot of the page. The Samaritan Pentateuch stands alongside the Hebrew in parallel columns. The &quot;Dissertatio generalis&quot;, appended to the second volume, contains an account of the manuscripts and other authorities collated, and also a review of the Hebrew text, divided into periods, and beginning with the formation of the Hebrew canon after the return of the Jews from the exile.

Kennicott&#x27;s great work was in one sense a failure. It yielded no materials of value for the emendation of the received text, and by disregarding the vowel points overlooked the one thing in which some result (grammatical if not critical) might have been derived from collation of Massoretic manuscripts. But the negative result of the publication and of the &quot;Variae lectiones&quot; of De Rossi, published some years later, was important. It showed that all Hebrew manuscripts of the Old Testament, whatever their affinities and distinctions, were the result of an editorial process in antiquity that shields the original text from inquiry except indirectly through the study of versions and quotations. The discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls ended the transmissional monopoly of the Massoretic Text, but only in the Book of Isaiah and several much shorter passages, nonetheless comprising excerpts from almost every book of the Old Testament.

After Kennicott&#x27;s death, his observations on Hebrew Bible passages were published as &quot;Remarks on Select Passages in the Old Testament&quot; (1787).

==Kennicott Fellowship==
Kennicott&#x27;s work was perpetuated by his widow, who founded two university scholarships at Oxford for the study of Hebrew. The fund originally yielded an income of £200 per annum. Currently, the Kennicott Fellowship is a postdoctoral Junior Research Fellowship in Ancient Hebrew, Hebrew Bible, and related topics. Past fellows include Hallel Baitner, S. R. Driver, Norman Whybray, Jocelyn Davey (Chaim Raphael), Anselm Hagedorn, Paul Joyce, Jennie Grillo, Timothy Lim, Daniel Falk, Katherine Southwood, and John Screnock. As of 2008, the value of the Kennicott Hebrew Fellowship was in the order of £19,263.

==Publications==
A full facsimile of the Bodleian Library&#x27;s Kennicott Bible, &quot;MS. Kennicott 1&quot;, has been published.

==Family==
In 1771 Kennicott married Ann Chamberlayne, sister of Edward Chamberlayne the Treasury official, and sister-in-law of William Hayward Roberts. She survived him by many years, dying in 1831. A friend of Hannah More, she knew Hugh Nicholas Pearson and was influenced by his evangelical faith. With Pearson as executor, she left property from the Chamberlayne estate in Norfolk to endow the two Hebrew scholarships at Oxford, mentioned above.

<text>Richard Barnes (1532 – 24 August 1587) was an Anglican priest who served as a bishop in the Church of England during the reign of Elizabeth I.

==Early life, education and family==
He was born in Bold which was then a village near St Helens in south Lancashire. He attended Farnworth Grammar School and then was admitted to Brasenose College, Oxford. Here he was elected a fellow in 1552, and received his BA in 1553. This was followed by a BD and then a postgraduate MA in 1557. Finally he became a DD in 1579.

Barnes was ordained a deacon on 24 September 1558 at St Bartholomew-the-Great by Peter Wall, Bishop of Clonmacnoise and a priest on 7 December by Edmund Bonner, Bishop of London at his manor&#x27;s chapel. After receiving Holy Orders he was made Minister of Stonegrave in Yorkshire. In 1561 he was appointed Canon Chancellor (and canon of the Laughton prebend which was annexed thereto) of York Minster, which offices he held until 1571.

He married Fredesmund Gifford in the 1560s. Their daughter Mary was born about 1567; she married Richard Jocelyn of Hyde Hall in Sawbridgeworth. (Jocelyn was an ancestor of the Baronets Jocelyn of Hyde Hall, the Viscounts Jocelyn and the Earls of Roden by his second wife Joyce Atkinson.)

==Episcopal career==
In 1567 he was appointed Bishop suffragan of Nottingham and later, in 1570, was appointed Bishop of Carlisle. As bishop, he soon gained a reputation as someone dedicated to seeking out recusants. In 1575 he was translated to Durham, as a result of the patronage of William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley: his election to that See was confirmed on 9 May and he was enthroned at Durham Cathedral on 19 May. It seems that he was on bad terms with Edmund Grindal, then Archbishop of Canterbury. One possible reason for this is that Barnes disapproved of Grindal&#x27;s refusal to suppress the prophesyings – which refusal had led to Grindal being suspended from office.

==Whittingham affair==
At the first Metropolitan Visitation of Barnes&#x27; tenure, in 1577, Edwin Sandys, Archbishop of York, delegated his authority to Barnes. However, he met determined opposition from the Dean, William Whittingham, who refused to allow him in to the chapter house. In retaliation, Barnes excommunicated Whittingham. Barnes later, during a legitimate episcopal visitation, described the diocese&#x27;s affairs thus:

:&quot;...that Augiae Stabulum, the church of Durham ... whose stink is grievous in the nose of God and of men and which to purge far passeth Hercules&#x27; labours&quot; (BL, Lansdowne MS. 25, fols. 161–2)

However, the conspiracy against Whittingham was brought to an end by the dean&#x27;s death in 1579.

<text>Charles Augustus Briggs (January 15, 1841 – June 8, 1913), American Presbyterian (and later Episcopalian) scholar and theologian, was born in New York City, the son of Alanson Briggs and Sarah Mead Berrian. He was excommunicated from the Presbyterian Church for heresy due to his liberal theology regarding the Bible.

==Early life==
Briggs was educated at the University of Virginia (1857–1860); graduated at the Union Theological Seminary in 1863; and, after the American Civil War during which he served in the 7th Regiment of the New York Militia, studied further at the University of Berlin from 1866 to 1869. In 1870, he was appointed pastor of the First Presbyterian Church of Roselle, New Jersey which post he held until 1874, when he accepted the professorship of Hebrew and cognate languages at Union Theological Seminary in which he taught until 1891, and of Biblical theology there from 1891 to 1904, following which he became their professor of theological encyclopaedia and symbolics. At the Union Theological Seminary, he also served as head librarian for the Burke Library. From 1880 to 1890 he was an editor of the &quot;Presbyterian Review&quot;.

==Heresy trial==
In 1892 Briggs was tried for heresy by the presbytery of New York, including James McCook, and acquitted. The charges were based upon his inaugural address of the preceding year. In brief, they were as follows:
* that he had taught that reason and the Church are both a fountain of divine authority, which, apart from Holy Scripture, does savingly enlighten men
* that errors may have existed in the original text of the Holy Scripture
* that Old Testament predictions have been reversed by history and that the great body of Messianic prediction has not and cannot be fulfilled
* that Moses is not the author of the Pentateuch and that Isaiah is not the author of the second half of the book that bears his name 
* that the processes of redemption extend to the world to come (he had considered it a fault of Protestant theology that it limits redemption to this world and that sanctification is not complete at death).

After much posturing, maneuvering and publicity-seeking by Briggs, the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church, to which the case was appealed, defrocked and excommunicated Briggs from the Presbyterian Church in 1893 in Washington, DC. Some have argued that General Assembly&#x27;s finding of heresy was influenced, in part, by Briggs&#x27; belligerent manner and militant tone of expressions and by what his own colleagues in the Union Theological Seminary called the dogmatic and irritating nature of his inaugural address.

After his condemnation by the Presbyterians, he turned towards Episcopalianism and was ordained as a priest of the Protestant Episcopal Church in 1899. His scholarship procured for him the honorary degree of D.D. from the University of Edinburgh (1884) and from the University of Glasgow (1901), and that of D.Litt., from the University of Oxford (1901). With Francis Brown and S. R. Driver he prepared a revised &quot;Hebrew and English Lexicon&quot; (1891–1905, commonly known as &quot;Brown Driver Briggs&quot; or BDB) based on the lexicon of Wilhelm Gesenius, and, with Driver, edited &quot;The International Critical Commentary&quot; series.

<doc id="929067" wikidata="Q1206422" url="?curid=929067" title="Hiranai">
<text>() is a town located in Aomori Prefecture, Japan and a part of the Aomori metropolitan area. , the town had an estimated population of 9,750 in 4,736 households, and a population density of 45 persons per km². It is the most heavily populated town in Higashitsugaru District. The total area of the town is .

==Etymology==
The name Hiranai is thought to have originated from the Ainu who originally inhabited the area. The Ainu words for and are said to be the original name of the area, due to its geography as a river valley in the interior of the mountainous Natsudomari Peninsula. However, the current Japanese pronunciation and meaning of the town&#x27;s name, is descriptive of the valley, but is based on the flat area inside of the mountains or the bay that surrounds it.

==History==
During the Edo period, Hiranai was a village. On 17 September 1656, the village became part of Kuroishi Domain controlled by the Tsugaru clan. Up to the middle of the Edo period, the isolated areas of Hiranai were some of the last sanctuaries for the Ainu people in Honshu. However, they were assimilated into the rest of the population by pushes made by the ruling Tsugaru clan in 1756 and 1809. In July 1871, with the abolition of the han system, Kuroishi Domain briefly became Kuroishi Prefecture, and was merged into the newly created Aomori Prefecture in September 1871. During the cadastral reform of 1889, Natsudomari Peninsula was divided into the three villages of Naka-Hiranai, Nishi-Hiranai, and Higashi-Hiranai. On 1 October 1928, Naka-Hiranai became a town, renaming itself Kominato.

===1939 to present===
Nishi-Hiranai village&#x27;s train station, Nishi-Hiranai Station opened in 1939. The station was built to provide access to the Aomori Sanatorium, a facility to treat the soldiers who were injured during the Second Sino-Japanese War and later, the Pacific War. The climate of Natsudomari Peninsula and the proximity to Asamushi Onsen was of benefit to the wounded soldiers. After the end of hostilities, the sanatorium was closed.

On 15 July 1945, four seaplanes of the Imperial Japanese Army&#x27;s Giretsu Kuteitai docked off the east coast of Natsudomari Peninsula were bombed. Off the northern coast of the peninsula a ship was sunk, killing 3 and leaving 9 injured.

On the 9th and 10 August of the same year Grumman TBF Avengers bombed the entirety of the town and a troop transport ship, the &quot;Hanasaki Maru&quot;, was sunk. One person was wounded.
On 31 March 1955, Kominato merged with Nishi-Hiranai and Higashi-Hiranai to form the town, Hiranai. On 20 May 1963, Emperor Shōwa and Empress Kōjun visited Hiranai to plant a Japanese red pine in the Yogoshiyama Forest Park for the 14th Annual Tree Planting Event and National Greening Convention.

In 2012, Hiranai won a competition amongst towns and cities in Aomori Prefecture for who could produce the best advertisement film for their town. The film was titled, &quot;&quot; as a play on the pronunciation of the town&#x27;s name and that the town isn&#x27;t well known. The commercial features a child looking for the town, Shiranai, but nobody knows where that is. She then is told that she is probably looking for Hiranai and that it&#x27;s not a town that nobody knows. This phrase from the film is well known by the town&#x27;s citizens.

==Demographics==
Per Japanese census data, the population of Hiranai has decreased by 38% over the past 50 years. The town&#x27;s population dropped below 10,000 for the first time in a century in November 2023.

==Geography==

Hiranai occupies the Natsudomari Peninsula, the northern end of the Ōu Mountain Range that juts into central Mutsu Bay. The town&#x27;s population is concentrated near the Japan National Route 4 passing through the east and west of the town and the Aoimori Railway Line (formerly the Tōhoku Main Line). The town office is in the settlement of Kominato, the central part of Hiranai centered around the valley of the Kominato River. The Kominato River begins in the mountains in the south of Hiranai, and flows north through the mountains until it reaches the flat land the town is situated on. After passing through Kominato, it joins the Morita River, which empties into Mutsu Bay shortly after their confluence. The southern part of Hiranai is mainly mountainous. The edges of the town make up the bulk of the Asamushi-Natsudomari Prefectural Natural Park.

===Climate===
The town has a cold humid continental climate (Köppen &quot;Cfb&quot;) characterized by warm short summers and long cold winters with heavy snowfall. The average annual temperature in Hiranai is 9.8 °C. The average annual rainfall is 1262 mm with September as the wettest month. The temperatures are highest on average in August, at around 22.8 °C, and lowest in January, at around -2.0 °C.

==Government==
Hiranai has a mayor-council form of government with a directly elected mayor and a unicameral town council of 12 members. In terms of national politics, the town is represented in the Diet of Japan&#x27;s House of Representatives as a part of the Aomori 1st district.

==Economy==

The economy of Hiranai is heavily dependent on commercial fishing. Some of the locally caught seafood include sea urchin roe, sea cucumber, scallops, abalone and squid. Paddy fields are present in the lowlands of Hiranai. In 2021, 435 hectares of the town&#x27;s land area were utilized for the production of crops, chiefly rice. Tourism also plays a role in the economy, with beaches in close proximity to the city of Aomori in summer, ski resorts in winter, and &quot;onsen&quot; all year drawing tourists.

==Education==
Hiranai has three public elementary schools and one public middle school operated by the town government. Hiranai formerly had one public high school, the Hiranai branch of Aomori-Higashi High School, operated by the Aomori Prefectural Board of Education, but it was closed in 2021. Following the high school&#x27;s closure it was designated as a public venue for the deployment of COVID-19 vaccines beginning in April 2021. Following the consolidation of the town&#x27;s three remaining middle schools into one, the former high school building was repurposed as the sole middle school operated by town&#x27;s board of education. Hiranai Middle School commenced operations on 7 April 2022 after the completion of renovations on the building.

The town is also home to Shofujuku High School, a privately-run school established in 1974 that follows a curriculum based on the beliefs of Shōroku Shintō Yamatoyama. The private school gained national attention for its use of the deprecated Imperial Rescript on Education in its curriculum.

*Asadokoro is the only designated natural monument in Japan for the observation of swans. Tundra swan from Siberia come to the region during the winter. A local legend says that the Tsugaru clan was at risk of losing what would become Hiranai to the Nanbu clan. After the Tsugaru forces prayed for help against the Nanbu, a massive flock of swans appeared. The Nanbu couldn&#x27;t see the swans, but they mistook their honking for the sound of arriving Tsugaru reinforcements. The Nanbu retreated, preserving the border between the Tsugaru&#x27;s Kuroishi Domain and the Nanbu&#x27;s Shichinohe Domain. Hiranai maintains a counter for the amount of swans staying in the area during the winter.

<text>was a town located in Nishitsugaru District in western Aomori Prefecture, Japan.

Kizukuri was located in central Tsugaru Peninsula, facing the Sea of Japan. The area was part of Hirosaki Domain during the Edo period. Kizukuri was created on 30 March 1955 through the merger of Shussei, Kawayoke, Shibata, and Koshimizu villages.

On 11 February 2005, Kizukuri, along with the villages of Inagaki, Kashiwa, Morita and Shariki (all from Nishitsugaru District), was merged to create the city of Tsugaru, and thus no longer exists as an independent municipality.

At the time of its merger, Kizukuri had an estimated population of 19,123 and a population density of 159.3 persons per km2. The total area was 120.07 km2. The town economy was dominated by agriculture and commercial fishing, and the town was served by Kizukuri Station on the Gonō Line of JR East.

Kizukuri has many festivals in the summer including the Nebuta festival (held in other towns as well). The Nebuta festival is where certain districts of the town form teams who build large Papier-mâché statues of warriors fighting monsters or other scenes.

<text>was a village located in Nishitsugaru District in western Aomori Prefecture, Japan.

Morita Village was located in the central portion of Tsugaru Peninsula. The area was part of Hirosaki Domain during the Edo period. After the Meiji Restoration, Morita Village was created on 1 April 1889.

On 11 February 2005, Morita, along with the town of Kizukuri, and the villages of Inagaki, Kashiwa and Shariki (all from Nishitsugaru District), was merged to create the city of Tsugaru, and thus no longer exists as an independent municipality.

At the time of its merger, Morita had an estimated population of 5,011 and a population density of 207.75 persons per km2. The total area was 24.12 km2. The village economy was dominated by agriculture. The village was served by Mutsu-Morita Station and Nakata Station on the Gonō Line of JR East.

<doc id="929083" wikidata="Q1321874" url="?curid=929083" title="National Museum Cardiff">
<text>National Museum Cardiff (), formerly known as the National Museum of Wales, is a museum and art gallery in Cardiff, Wales. The museum is part of the wider network of Amgueddfa Cymru – Museum Wales. Entry is kept free by a grant from the Welsh Government. In February 2025 the museum announced a temporary closure due to maintenance funding issues.

==History==
The National Museum of Wales was founded in 1905, with its royal charter granted in 1907. Part of the bid for Cardiff to obtain the National Museum for Wales included the gift of the Cardiff Museum Collection, then known as &quot;Welsh Museum of Natural History, Archaeology and Art,&quot; which was formally handed over in 1912. The Cardiff Museum was sharing the building of Cardiff Library, and was a sub-department of the library until 1893. Construction of a new building in the civic complex of Cathays Park began in 1912, but owing to the First World War it did not open to the public until 1922, with the official opening taking place in 1927. The architects were Arnold Dunbar Smith and Cecil Brewer, although the building as it now stands is a heavily truncated version of their design.

The sculpture scheme for the building was devised by Sir W. Goscombe John and consisted of the groups &quot;Prehistoric Period&quot; and &quot;Classic Period&quot; by Gilbert Bayes as well as &quot;Learning&quot;, &quot;Mining&quot;, and &quot;Shipping&quot; by Thomas J Clapperton, &quot;Art&quot; by Bertram Pegram, &quot;Medieval Period&quot; by Richard Garbe, &quot;Music&quot; by David Evans, and others. D. Arthur Thomas was commissioned to produce a model for the dragons, and A. Bertram Pegram to produce a model for the lions that were placed around the base of the dome.

==Present==
The museum has collections of botany, fine and applied art, geology, and zoology. Archaeology has been moved to the St Fagans National Museum of History.

In 2011, with funding from the Clore Duffield Foundation, the former Glanely Gallery was transformed into the Clore Discovery Centre, which offers hands-on exploration of the museum&#x27;s 7.5 million items that are normally in storage, including insects, fossils and Bronze Age weapons. School groups, formal and informal groups can also be accommodated but should book in advance.

Between 2022-2024 internal management disputes between the-then president of the museum, Roger Lewis, who had formerly run the Welsh Rugby Union, and the-then director-general, David Anderson, saw both leave the museum. The handling of the dispute, which concluded with a settlement to Mr Anderson of £325,000, with legal bills bringing the total cost to the Senedd of over £600,000, drew criticism from Audit Wales.

===Black Lives Matter movement===
Following the removal of the Statue of Edward Colston in Bristol on 6 June 2020, Wales Online reported on a similar campaign to remove monuments to Lieutenant-General Sir Thomas Picton, a Welsh soldier, in Carmarthen and Cardiff. While Picton was revered as a hero in the 19th century after dying at the Battle of Waterloo, the most senior British Army officer to lose his life, his previous record as governor of Trinidad was controversial even at the time, and saw him convicted of widespread abuse of the island&#x27;s population, including the use of torture. In November 2021, the museum removed a 19th-century portrait of Sir Thomas by Sir Martin Archer Shee and replaced it with a painting of a Welsh gardener by Albert Houthuesen. The museum commissioned artists to re-examine the legacy of Sir Thomas.

===Closure===
The museum has experienced severe funding difficulties for most of the 2020s and in 2024 its chief executive expressed concern that it may be forced to close as a result of a lack of funding for maintenance repairs necessary to keep the building safe for visitors and staff. Lesley Griffiths, then Cabinet Secretary for Culture and Social Justice (Wales), refuted this claim, giving an assurance that the &quot;National Museum is not closing&quot;. In early February 2025 the museum announced a &quot;temporary closure&quot; due to &quot;building maintenance and health and safety concerns&quot;. The museum reopened on 7 February 2025, but the closure prompted media discussion regarding the levels of Senedd funding for cultural and historic buildings and events.

==National Museum of Art==
The National Museum of Art opened in 2011. The collection of Old Master paintings in Cardiff includes, among other notable works, &quot;The Virgin and Child between Saint Helena and St Francis&quot; by Amico Aspertini, &quot;The Poulterer&#x27;s Shop&quot; by Frans Snyders, &quot;A Calm&quot; by Jan van de Cappelle Since 2016, the museum has had Rembrandt&#x27;s 1657 &quot;Portrait of Catharina Hooghsaet&quot; on permanent display. In 2019, a painting depicting the Madonna and Child with a Pomegranate, which was thought to be a late copy by a lesser artist of a lost work by Sandro Botticelli featured on the television programme &quot;Britain&#x27;s Lost Masterpieces&quot; where, after conservation treatment by Simon Gillespie and research by Bendor Grosvenor, it was confirmed to be from the studio of Botticelli, with parts by the master himself.

A collection of landscape paintings in the classical tradition includes works by Claude, Gaspard Dughet, Salvator Rosa and two works by Nicolas Poussin: &quot;The Funeral of Phocion&quot; (1648) and &quot;The Finding of Moses&quot; (the latter owned jointly by the Museum and the National Gallery, London). These works prefigure the career of the Welsh-born Richard Wilson, called &quot;the father of British landscape painting&quot;. In 1979 four cartoons for tapestries illustrating scenes from the &quot;Aeneid&quot; were bought as works by Peter Paul Rubens, but the attribution is now disputed.

There is a gallery devoted to British patronage of the 18th century, in particular that of Sir Watkin Williams Wynn. Included is a portrait of Williams-Wynn in Rome with fellow Tourists by Pompeo Batoni, one of his second wife by Sir Joshua Reynolds and his chamber organ designed by Robert Adam. Other paintings of note from this period is a portrait of Viscountess Elizabeth Bulkeley of Beaumaris as the mythological character Hebe, by the &#x27;sublime and terrible&#x27; George Romney, and Johann Zoffany&#x27;s group portrait of Henry Knight, a Glamorgan landowner, with his children.

The collection of French art assembled by Margaret and Gwendoline Davies, granddaughters of the wealthy industrialist David Davies bequeathed to the National Museum in the 1950s and 1960s, make Wales&#x27;s National Gallery one of international standing. It includes the largest group of paintings by Honoré Daumier in the world and the most important by Jean-François Millet in Britain. Works by Claude Monet include Venetian scenes such as &quot;San Giorgio Maggiore at Dusk&quot; and examples from his &quot;Rouen Cathedral&quot; and &quot;Water Lilies&quot; series. Post-Impressionism is represented by Van Gogh&#x27;s late work &quot;Rain at Auvers&quot;, and by Paul Cézanne&#x27;s &quot;The François Zola Dam&quot;, the first painting by the artist to be displayed in a British public collection. The two most famous works in the Davies Sisters&#x27; collection are &quot;La Parisienne&quot; by Pierre-Auguste Renoir (1874), exhibited in the First Impressionist Exhibition, and a version of Rodin&#x27;s &quot;Kiss&quot; cast in bronze.

The art gallery has works by all of the notable Welsh artists, including landscapes by Richard Wilson and the pioneering Thomas Jones. There is a considerable body of work by John Gibson, Queen Victoria&#x27;s favourite sculptor, and major paintings by Augustus John and his sister Gwen John, including the former&#x27;s famous image of Dylan Thomas. Ceri Richards is well represented. The artistic output of David Jones is well represented, but seldom on display owing to the fragile nature of his works on paper. Wales&#x27;s most prominent contemporary painter, Sir Kyffin Williams (1918–2006), also features in the collection.

The collection of 20th-century art includes works by sculptors Jacob Epstein, Herbert Ward and Eric Gill and painters including Stanley Spencer, the British Impressionist Wynford Dewhurst, L. S. Lowry, and Oskar Kokoschka. Works by contemporary artists are on rotational display, including those by Francis Bacon, Frank Auerbach and Rachel Whiteread. Pablo Picasso&#x27;s &quot;Nature morte au poron&quot; was acquired in 2009.

<text>Richard Senhouse (died 1626) was an English churchman, Bishop of Carlisle from 1624 to 1626.

==Life==

He was third son of John Senhouse (d. 1604) of Netherhall, Cumberland (now part of Maryport), by Anne, daughter of John Ponsonby of Hail Hall and the great-great-nephew of William Senhouse, bishop of Carlisle and Durham. His father was an antiquary who collected Roman remains, and Sir Robert Bruce Cotton visited him in 1599.

Richard was educated, first at Trinity College and then at St. John&#x27;s College, Cambridge, where he graduated M.A. in 1598 (incorporated at Oxford in 1600), and proceeded B.D. by grace of 15 February 1608, D.D. in 1622. He became fellow of St. John&#x27;s on 7 April 1598.

He was known as a preacher, and became chaplain successively to Edward Russell, 3rd Earl of Bedford, Prince Charles, and King James I. In 1606 he was appointed vicar of Bumpsted Steeple, Essex; in 1608 he was rector of Cheam, Surrey, and on 18 December 1621 he became dean of Gloucester. He was made bishop of Carlisle on 26 September 1624, and preached the coronation sermon for Charles I on 2 February 1626. He died three months later after a fall from his horse, on 6 May 1626, and was buried in Carlisle Cathedral. A volume containing four sermons by him was published in London in 1627.

<text>Plinius is a prominent lunar impact crater on the border between Mare Serenitatis to the north and Mare Tranquilitatis to the south. Its diameter is 41 km. The crater is named after the Roman natural scientist and author Pliny the Elder. To the south-southeast of Plinius is the crater Ross, and to the northeast is Dawes. Just to the north is a system of rilles named the Rimae Plinius and touching it is the Brackett crater which is more than a crater diameter north. At the northwest edge of the rille is the Promontorium Archerusia, a cape off the western rim that encloses the Mare Serenitatis.

Plinius is a crater of Eratosthenian age.

==Description==

The sharp rim of Plinius is slightly oval in form, with a d inner wall and an irregular outer . It lacks a visible ray system. The crater floor is hilly, and in the middle is an irregular central peak that has the appearance of a double crater formation under certain angles of illumination. A cleft feature is attached to the northern side of the peak. The eastern half of the floor is much more smooth and level than the hummocky west, and this section forms a crescent shape about the central peak.
==Satellite craters==

By convention, these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Plinius.

On 30 October 1889, the &quot;Cheseborough&quot;, an American merchant ship from Bath, Maine, wrecked a mile from the coast of the village. The villagers made a great effort to save the sailors, unfortunately nineteen of them did not survive the incident. After the remainder of the sailors recovered, they returned to the United States but maintained their relationship with the people of Shariki. This relationship eventually resulted in the village establishing a sister-city agreement with Bath, Maine.

=== Merge into Tsugaru city ===
On 11 February 2005, Shariki, along with the town of Kizukuri, and the villages of Inagaki, Kashiwa and Morita (all from Nishitsugaru District), was merged to create the city of Tsugaru, and thus no longer exists as an independent municipality, however, the city inherited Shariki&#x27;s relationship with Bath.

<text>was a town located in Minamitsugaru District in central Aomori Prefecture, Japan.

Namioka Town was located in the plains of central Aomori Prefecture, bordered by the Ōu Mountains to the east. The area was part of Hirosaki Domain during the Edo period. In 1889, after the Meiji Restoration, Namioka Village was created on April 1, 1889. It was elevated to town status on June 1, 1940. It annexed the four neighboring villages of Megasawa, Osugi, Nozawa and Gogo on December 15, 1954, and annexed a portion of Nanawa Village from Kitatsugaru District in 1956.

On April 1, 2005, Namioka was merged with the neighboring and expanded city of Aomori, and thus no longer exists as an independent municipality.

The merger was very controversial; after the agreement was made with the city of Aomori and the Aomori Prefectural Parliament had approved the change, strong objections were made by Namioka residents, who had not been consulted. The town mayor was recalled on December 26, 2004. A new mayor was elected on February 13, 2005, who indicated his opposition to the merger. On March 27, 2005, a referendum was held showing strong opposition to the plan, but five days later the merger went into effect in accordance with the previously settled agreement.

At the time of its merger, Namioka had an estimated population of 20,543 and a density of 155.48 persons per km2. The total area was 15.19 km2.

==Noted residents of Namioka==
*Takanosato Toshihide – sumo wrestler
*Bushūyama Takashi – sumo wrestler

==Plot==

==== In Chavanon and Paris ====
One day Barberin finds a baby boy in Paris. The boy wears very fine clothes, so apparently his parents are rich. Barberin offers to take care of the child, hoping to get a good reward. He gives the boy to his wife, and calls him Rémi.

Barberin gets injured in an accident. He blames his employer and hopes to receive financial compensation in a trial. The trial costs a lot of money, and Barberin tells his wife to sell her cow (her main source of wealth) and to get rid of Rémi. She does the former.

The story proper starts when Rémi is eight years old. Barberin comes home unexpectedly, bitter and penniless, having lost his trial. He sees that Rémi is still there and decides to get rid of him when he meets a travelling artist, Signor Vitalis, in the local pub, who travels with three dogs Capi, Zerbino and Dolce - and a monkey, Joli-Coeur. Vitalis offers to take Rémi on as an apprentice for money.

==== Travelling with Vitalis ====
Rémi leaves his childhood home, without even a chance to say goodbye to his foster mother (who would have done anything to prevent the transaction) and starts a journey on the roads of France. Vitalis is a kind man, certainly better company than Barberin, and teaches Rémi to play the harp and to read.

They travel West, via Murat (where Vitalis tells him of the prince of Naples, brother in law of Napoleon, who came from there). Next stop is Ussel where Rémi is outfitted for his new life, including shoes, which he has never owned before. The first big city going south is Bordeaux, after which they cut right through the morass of les Landes towards Pau.

==== Meeting the Milligans ====
When they are in Toulouse, Vitalis is put in jail after an incident with a policeman who is rough with Rémi. It is not easy for a ten-year-old to feed himself and four animals under his care, and they nearly starve, when they meet the &quot;Swan&quot; - a little river ship owned by Mrs. Milligan and her ill son Arthur. Rémi is taken in to entertain the sick boy, and he becomes almost part of the family. They travel towards Montpellier and the Mediterranean on the Canal du Sud. Rémi learns the story about her dead husband and brother-in-law, who under the English law, was to inherit all of his brother&#x27;s fortune if he died childless. An earlier child had disappeared and was never found (under the charge of this James Milligan) but soon after the husband&#x27;s death, Arthur was born.

Two months later Vitalis is released from jail, and Mrs. Milligan pays for him to take the train to Cette. Rémi and the Milligans would like to stay together, but Vitalis thinks it is better for Rémi to be free, and so they say goodbye. Mrs. Milligan however thinks that Vitalis is a very kind and honest man.

==== Three animals of Vitalis die ====
They travel via Tarascon, Montelimar, Valence, Tournon, Vienne, Lyon, Dijon, and Chalon on the way to Paris, but winter catches up to them 30 miles from Troyes, and in a snowstorm Zerbino and Dolce are attacked by wolves in the woods, and Joli-Cœur catches pneumonia.

In an attempt to raise money for the doctor, Rémi and Vitalis give a performance and Vitalis sings. Rémi has never before heard Vitalis sing, and is not the only one who is bewildered: a young and apparently rich lady tells Vitalis that she is amazed to hear his wonderful voice. Vitalis reacts angrily. He explains his skill to the lady by telling her that he used to be a singer&#x27;s servant. He shows no appreciation when the lady gives a gold coin to Capi. They return to Joli-Coeur with the money, but it&#x27;s too late, Joli-Cœur is dead.

==== Garofoli ====
They now continue their journey to Paris. Vitalis decides to leave Rémi with another &quot;padrone&quot; for the winter, while he trains new animals with the proceeds. This &quot;padrone&quot; is a man who keeps a group of boys, sold by their poverty-stricken parents, working for him. Garofoli isn&#x27;t home, and Vitalis tells Rémi to wait there, and that he will be back soon. Rémi passes two horrible hours in the Rue Lourcine house - waiting for Garofoli and talking to an ill-looking boy, Mattia, who keeps house because Garofoli believes him too stupid and incapable of working outside. He also keeps the soup pot locked so that Mattia could not eat from it.

When the other boys and Garofoli return, Rémi witnesses how terribly Garofoli abuses those who do not bring home the amount of money required: he beats and starves them. When Vitalis comes back and sees how the boys are being flogged, he tells Garofoli that he could go to the police, but Garofoli threatens back to tell &quot;some people just one name which will make Vitalis red from shame&quot;. Vitalis takes the wondering and grateful Rémi away. This act of love costs Vitalis his life. That night, unable to find a place to stay, Vitalis and Rémi collapse in the snowstorm under a fence after fruitlessly searching for access to a stone quarry shelter.

==== With the Acquins ====
Rémi wakes up in a bed, with people standing around him: a man, the gardener Pierre Acquin, two boys Alexis and Benjamin, and two girls Étienette (Martha) and little mute Lise, who is about 5–6 years old, and watches Rémi with &quot;speaking eyes&quot;. Rémi learns the terrible truth: Vitalis is dead. In an attempt to discover his identity, the police officers take Rémi to Garofoli, who reveals the truth: Vitalis used to be the famous Italian singer Carlo Balzani. When he aged, he lost his voice and was too proud to sing in lesser venues. He decided to disappear, changing his identity to Vitalis.

The family take Rémi and Capi in. Rémi especially adores Lise. He teaches her to read and plays the harp for her. Lise loves a Neapolitan song in particular. Rémi becomes a gardener, and two years of hard work and merry Sundays follow. Then a terrible hailstorm ruins the glass in the greenhouse, and Acquin is in debt to the man he borrowed from to buy his business. He cannot pay and has to enter a debtor&#x27;s jail. The children are to go to uncles and aunts, in several French towns. Although the children insist that Rémi also belongs to the family, none of the uncles and aunts are willing or able to take care of Rémi. Broken-hearted, vowing to his siblings to visit and bring their father news from them, Rémi takes his harp and Capi and takes to the road.

=== Second volume ===
==== Mattia ====
Rémi decides to head south towards Fontainebleau but hasn&#x27;t gone long when he meets a companion, Mattia, the boy from Garofoli, starving near a church on the streets of Paris. Garofoli is in prison for beating another boy to death. Mattia pleads with Rémi to take him into his troupe. Rémi is scared: with him, Mattia might die of hunger as much as alone. But Mattia convinces him that two will never die of hunger because one helps the other. Thus, &quot;Rémi troupe&quot; consists now of two twelve-year-old musicians and a dog.

Mattia turns out to be a gifted violinist, he plays other instruments too, and he learned some tricks while working for some time in a circus. The boys do well in the spring at weddings and festivals, their talents are appreciated and Rémi takes up the plan to visit Mother Barberin and buy her a cow (as a replacement to the one she was forced to sell at the start of the story).

==== Mining ====
Since a cow costs a lot of money Rémi plans a route via Corbeil, Montargis, Gien, Bourges, St. Amand and Montluçon where they make a lot of money on their way to visit Alexis, who now lives with his Uncle Gaspard (Father Acquin&#x27;s brother) in the mining town Varses, and works in the mine with his uncle. When Alexis is wounded and unable to work for a while, Rémi volunteers to replace him. One of the miners is nicknamed magister, who is an old and wise man. He becomes a good friend and he explains the history of coal.

One day the mine is flooded by the river Divonne, which flows overhead. Seven miners, including Uncle Gaspard, the magister and Rémi, find shelter, but are trapped. They are waiting to be rescued, but have no idea of the amount of time passing in hunger and fear. One of the men confesses a crime, blames himself for the disaster and commits suicide. They end up spending a fortnight underground - and at last are saved. Capi is mad with happiness, while Mattia is in tears. He says he never believed that Rémi could be dead, and Rémi is proud of his friend&#x27;s strong belief in him. This incident shows the terrible state of child labour in 19th Century France.

Rémi wants Mattia to learn music and they visit a barber/musician. Mr. Espinassous is amazed by Mattia&#x27;s great talent and tries to convince him to stay and learn, but Mattia does not want to leave Rémi.

==== A cow for Mother Barberin ====
The boys now head towards their visit to Rémi&#x27;s foster mother. First they decide to visit Clermont Ferrand, and south westerly, the mineral bath towns Saint Nectaire, Mont-Dore, Royat and Bourboule where they can make good money, towards the cow for mother Barberin. When they pass through Ussel, not far from Chavanon, they make sure that they will not buy a bad cow, and ask a vet for help. The vet is very friendly and the boys buy a wonderful cow.

In the next town the boys are accused of stealing the cow. They explain their story to the mayor. The mayor knows Mother Barberin, he heard about the accident in the mine, and he is willing to believe that the boys are honest. To make sure, the vet is called to testify, and the boys can continue their journey.

Rémi and Mother Barberin finally meet again. Mother Barberin tells Rémi that Jérôme is in Paris in search of Rémi, because his real parents appear to be in search of him, but Mother Barberin knows very little, because Jérôme never told her any details. Rémi is eager to know his real parents. Rémi and Mattia decide to return to Paris and find Barberin. On the way to Paris, they pass through Dreuzy, where they pay a visit to Lise Acquin. Rémi and Lise are very fond of each other.

==== The Driscolls ====
When the boys arrive in Paris, they learn that Jérôme has died. Rémi writes a letter to Mother Barberin. Mother Barberin replies and she encloses a letter that was sent by Jérôme before he died. It mentions the address of the lawyer&#x27;s office in London, in charge of the search for Rémi. The boys take a boat to London, where they are led straight to Rémi&#x27;s parents. Their name is Driscoll.

Rémi is terribly disappointed: the Driscolls are cold to him and his father keeps the boys locked up. They turn out to be a band of thieves and use Capi to help them in their work.

The Driscolls receive a visitor, a man who seems interested in Rémi, but Rémi does not understand English well enough. The visitor does not meet Mattia, but Mattia overhears their conversation. James Milligan appears to be Arthur&#x27;s uncle. He hopes that Arthur will die, so that he will inherit the fortune of his late brother. The boys agree that Mrs. Milligan must be warned, but they have no idea where to find her. Mattia meets Bob, a clown/musician from the circus. Bob turns out to be a fine friend.

==== Searching for the Milligans ====
When Rémi is accused of a robbery committed by the Driscolls, Bob and Mattia help him escape from prison. With the help of Bob&#x27;s brother, a sailor, they return to France to search for Mrs. Milligan, in order to warn her about her brother-in-law. They start by going up the Seine, since the &quot;Swan&quot; is a remarkable boat; they soon hear that people have seen her. They follow the trail along rivers and canals.

On their way they pass through Dreuzy where they hope to meet Lise again, but they hear that Lise&#x27;s uncle has died, and that a kind English lady, who journeyed on a boat, has offered to take care of Lise. Rémi and Mattia trace the &quot;Swan&quot; across France to near the Swiss border. They find the boat deserted, finding out that it was unable to journey further up the river, and the family continued their journey by coach, probably to Vevey. When they get to the town where &quot;the English woman with the ill boy and the mute girl&quot; are supposed to be, they start singing near every fence.

One day, Rémi sings his Neapolitan song, and hears a scream and a weak voice that continues the song. They run to the voice and find Lise, whose voice has returned to her when she heard her long-lost Rémi. The boys now find that James Milligan is there too, and Rémi is afraid to meet him, but James does not know Mattia so he is able to tell Mrs. Milligan their story. Mrs. Milligan guesses that Rémi might be her lost eldest son, but tells Mattia to keep it secret until she is sure. She arranges for the boys to stay in a hotel, where they can have plenty of food, comfortable beds, and are visited by a barber and a tailor.

==== Home====
After a few days Mrs. Milligan invites the boys to her villa where they meet Mother Barberin, whom Mrs. Milligan sent for. Mother Barberin shows Rémi&#x27;s baby clothes which Mrs. Milligan recognises as the clothes her boy wore when he was stolen. Mrs. Milligan happily declares that Rémi is her son, to join his &quot;mother, brother and those who loved you in your misery (Lise and Mattia)&quot;. It is clear that Mr. Driscoll had stolen the boy as a job for James Milligan.

The story has a happy ending: Rémi finds his biological family, and discovers he is the heir to a fortune, enabling him to help those who previously helped him. Mattia&#x27;s dear little sister Cristina is sent for from Italy and they all grow up together. Arthur gets well and becomes a gentleman athlete, Mattia a famous violinist. Vitalis is posthumously honored and remembered as Carlo Balzani again. With the Acquin family reunited after their father freed from deptor prison, Rémi marries Lise and they have a son named Mattia, and Mother Barberin becomes his nanny. While the Driscoll family broke apart from crimes, Rémi was relieved that Kate&#x27;s grandfather continued raising her.

The book ends with the score of the Neapolitan song.

<doc id="929104" wikidata="Q867556" url="?curid=929104" title="Chacornac (crater)">
<text>Chacornac is an irregular lunar impact crater attached to the southeast rim of the crater Posidonius. It lies just to the east of the Mare Serenitatis, and north of the crater Le Monnier. The crater is named after French astronomer Jean Chacornac.

The rim of Chacornac has a somewhat distorted, pentagonal outline, and appears uneven, especially in the northwest where it is attached to the rim of Posidonius. The flooded floor is irregular and uneven, and contains a system of faint rilles called the Rimae Charocnac. There is no central peak, and no trace of a ray system. The ground around the crater is rugged, with a hilly, sloping to the west.

== Satellite craters ==

By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to &quot;Chacornac&quot;.

<doc id="929105" wikidata="Q11483572" url="?curid=929105" title="Hiraka, Aomori">
<text>was a town located in Minamitsugaru District in central Aomori Prefecture, Japan.

Hiraka was founded on March 1, 1955 through the merger of the towns of Taikoji and Kashiwagi with the villages of Takedate, Ozaki and Machiya.

On January 1, 2006, Hiraka, along with the town of Onoe, and the village of Ikarigaseki (all from Minamitsugaru District), was merged to create the new city of Hirakawa, and thus no longer exists as an independent municipality.

An inland village, Hiraka had an agriculture-based economy and was noted for its production of apples. At the time of its merger, Hiraka had an estimated population of 22,053 and a population density of 99.5 persons per km2. The total area was 221.61 km2.

Hiraka was served by Japan National Route 102 and Japan National Route 454 highways, as well as by four stations on the Kōnan Railway Kōnan Line.

<doc id="929109" wikidata="Q6549149" url="?curid=929109" title="Lime TV">
<text>Lime TV, formerly known as WISDOM Television, is now defunct as a traditional television network and has instead focused and expanded into new digital media. The current Lime online website offers information and entertainment centered on physical and mental health with a soft focus on organic ingredients, whole foods consumption, mental conditioning through meditation and yoga, and physical fitness. Up until February 2007, Lime&#x27;s programming was available on certain digital cable and satellite systems (primarily DISH and Comcast Digital). Now, it is available only over the Internet, mobile web, and satellite radio, with a small sampling of Video on Demand features on some cable systems. Like many production companies and internet ventures, Lime also produces several DVD titles. Themes include the Lime Simple Steps. Lime&#x27;s main slogan is: &quot;Healthy Living with a Twist&quot;.

==WISDOM Channel==

WISDOM Television and Radio was founded in 1999 by William Turner in Bluefield, West Virginia. Turner (no relation to Ted Turner) was an early entrant into the cable and satellite television business. He was a pioneer of cable television, introducing one of the first cable television systems nationwide in Welch, West Virginia, and then expanded into the C-band service (large dish) business with becoming one of the largest C-band providers nationwide. He then founded Wisdom Television and Wisdom Radio with programming centered on new-age entertainment, alternative medicine, healthy lifestyles, and philosophy.

In 2002, Turner passed away after a long struggle of cancer, and the family sought out after his mission to sell the company in order to expand the distribution and grow. In 2005, Wisdom Media Group was sold to Steve Case&#x27;s Revolution company and became LIME TV.

==AOL Acquisition==
In 2005, the network was acquired by a company led by AOL Co-Founder, Steve Case. The channel was soon renamed and rebranded as Lime TV. The details of Case&#x27;s acquisition have never been publicly disclosed, but the purchase by Case&#x27;s company included WISDOM&#x27;s carriage and distribution contracts with DISH, Comcast, Insight Communications, and Sirius Radio, as well as WISDOM&#x27;s programming library.

==As Lime TV/Radio==
Present day Lime TV combined community and editorial content with streamed video and social networking tools. Lime.com included features such as &quot;The Meditation Room&quot;, eco-celebrity gossip in &quot;The Green Room&quot;, a news feed and articles, tips, and polls. Lime.com was also the home of a feature called &quot;Live the Change&quot; that offers simple tips that make big changes for living better. Updated weekly, Lime&#x27;s podcasts offered nine channels of content covering tips and information from Lime Radio and Lime Television hosts, specifically customized for podcast content. Podcast topics include eco-friendly gardening, fighting stress, parenting skills, and relationship advice.

Lime Radio was a 24/7 channel on Sirius Satellite Radio channel 114. It offered 12 daily hours of live call-in shows. Hosts include Andrew Weil, herbal pharmacist Dave Foreman, supermarket guru Phil Lempert, Jesse Dylan, Neale Donald Walsch, Josh Dorfman (&quot;The Lazy Environmentalist&quot;), Mel Robbins and Karen Salmansohn. The channel has been discontinued on February 13, 2008.

Lime Wireless provided mobile phone information on wellness, sustainability and personal growth. It was available on Sprint and Verizon Wireless via their mobile portal pages.

==End of Service==
On January 29, 2007, Lime announced they would discontinue the television channel in favor of online content distribution. Both Comcast Cable and Dish Network notified their subscribers that the last day of Lime TV service would be February 25, 2007.

In August 2007, LIME was purchased by GAIAM, a health and wellness company that operates GAIAM.com.

<text>Bluebird Records is an American record label best known for its low-cost releases, primarily of children&#x27;s music, blues, jazz and swing in the 1930s and 1940s. Bluebird was founded in 1932 as a lower-priced subsidiary label of RCA Victor. Bluebird was noted for what came to be known as the &quot;Bluebird sound&quot;, which influenced rhythm and blues and early rock and roll. It is currently owned by RCA Records parent company Sony Music Entertainment.

==History==
The label was founded in 1932 as a division of RCA Victor by Eli Oberstein, an executive at the company. Bluebird competed with other budget labels at the time. Records were made quickly and cheaply. The &quot;Bluebird sound&quot; came from the session band that was used on many recordings to cut costs. The band included musicians such as Big Bill Broonzy, Roosevelt Sykes, Washboard Sam, and Sonny Boy Williamson. Many blues musicians were signed to RCA Victor and Bluebird by Lester Melrose, a talent scout and producer who had a virtual monopoly on the Chicago blues market. In these years, the Bluebird label became the home of Chicago blues.

Bluebird recorded and reissued jazz and big band music. Its roster included Ted Weems, Rudy Vallée, Joe Haymes, Artie Shaw, Glenn Miller, Shep Fields, and Earl Hines. During World War II, Victor reissued records by Duke Ellington, Jelly Roll Morton, and Bennie Moten. Bluebird&#x27;s roster for country music included the Monroe Brothers, the Delmore Brothers, Bradley Kincaid. It reissued many titles by Jimmie Rodgers and the Carter Family.

After World War II, the Bluebird label was retired and its previously released titles were reissued on the standard RCA Victor label. In the 1950s, RCA Victor revived Bluebird for certain budget recordings, jazz releases and reissues, children&#x27;s records, and the low-priced RCA Victor Bluebird Classics series. The Bluebird name was retired again during the 1960s, and certain recordings issued under the Bluebird imprint during the 1950s were reissued on the standard RCA Victor label or the budget-priced RCA Camden label. In the mid-1970s, RCA revived the Bluebird label again, for a series of 2-LP sets of big band, swing and jazz reissues produced by Ethel Gabriel and Frank Driggs. Currently, the Bluebird label is used for CD reissues of certain jazz and pop titles originally issued on the RCA Victor label.

==Labels and discs==

RCA Victor&#x27;s entry into the budget market was the 35¢ &quot;Timely Tunes,&quot; sold through Montgomery Ward retail stores. 40 issues appeared from April to July 1931 before the label was discontinued.

The first Bluebird records appeared in July 1932 along with identically numbered Electradisk records. Test-marketed at selected Woolworth&#x27;s stores in New York City, these 8-inch discs are so rare today that copies of certain titles may no longer exist at all. The records may have sold for as little as 10¢ each. Bluebird records bore a black-on-medium blue label, Electradisks a blue-on-orange label.

The 8-inch series ran from 1800 to 1809, but both labels reappeared later in 1932 as 10-inch discs: Bluebird 1820–1853, continuing to April 1933, and Electradisk 2500–2509 and 1900–2177, continuing to January 1934.

Electradisks in the 2500 block were dance-band sides recorded on two days in June 1932. These rare issues were given Victor matrix numbers, but the four-digit matrix numbers on the 78 look more like those found on discs from Crown Records, an independent label that had its own studios, though its products were pressed by Victor. The few records in that block that have been seen resemble Crowns, leading to speculation that all were recorded at Crown. The 2500 series may also have been for sale only in New York City.

In May 1933, RCA Victor revived Bluebird as a 35¢ (3 for $1) general-interest budget record, numbered B-5000 and up, with a new blue-on-beige label (often referred as the &quot;buff&quot; Bluebird, used until 1937 in the US and 1939 in Canada). Most 1800-series material was immediately reissued on the buff label; afterwards it ran concurrently with the Electradisk series (made for Woolworth&#x27;s).

Another short-lived concurrent label was Sunrise, which may have been made for sale by artists or &quot;mom &amp; pop&quot; stores. Few discs, and essentially no information, survive. Sunrise and Electradisk were discontinued early in 1934, leaving Bluebird as RCA&#x27;s only budget-priced label until RCA Camden was formed in 1953. RCA Victor also produced a separate Montgomery Ward label for the Ward stores.

Archaeology showed that rice had been grown in the area for more than 2000 years. To honor this history, the villagers started a rice field behind the town hall. The villagers cultivated and used four different types of heirloom and modern strains of rice to create a giant picture in the field. To allow viewing of the whole picture, a mock castle tower 22 meters high was erected at the village office. In 2006, more than 200,000 people visited the village to see the art.

To encourage visitation outside of rice growing season, the village began using the same fields for winter rice paddy art in 2016. The designs are created by compressing snow into patterns by walking on it with snowshoes.

<text>was a town located in Kamikita District in central Aomori Prefecture, Japan.

On March 1, 2006, Momoishi, along with the neighboring town of Shimoda (also from Kamikita District), was merged to create the town of Oirase, and thus it no longer exists as an independent municipality.

Momoishi Village was founded on April 1, 1889. On April 20, 1929, it was elevated to town status.

Bordering the Pacific Ocean, the town had an agriculture-based economy based on commercial fishing and the production of rice, strawberries, and Japanese yams. The major local industry was Momokawa Brewing, Inc, a nationally known &quot;sake&quot; brewer.

At the time of its merger, Momoishi had an estimated population of 9,970 and a population density of 465 persons per km2. The total area was 21.44 km2.

Momoishi was served by Japan National Route 45 and Route 338 highways, but had no train service.

<text>Francis White (1638) was an English bishop and controversialist.

==Life==
He was son of Peter White (died 19 December 1615), vicar of Eaton Socon, Bedfordshire, was born at Eaton Socon about 1564 (parish register begins in 1566). His father had five sons, all clergymen, among them John White (1570?–1615), chaplain to James I. Francis, after passing through the grammar school at St Neots, Huntingdonshire, was admitted pensioner at Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, on 20 March 1579, aged 15. He graduated Bachelor of Arts (BA) in 1583, Cambridge Master of Arts (MA Cantab) in 1586, and was ordained priest by John Aylmer, Bishop of London, on 17 May 1588.

His early preferments were the rectory of Broughton Astley, Leicestershire, a lectureship at St. Paul&#x27;s Cathedral, London, and the rectory of St. Peter&#x27;s, Cornhill, London. In controversy against Catholicism he took a prominent part, and it produced his first publication. He graduated Doctor of Divinity (DD) in 1618. Early in 1622 he was employed by James I as a disputant against John Percy alias Fisher (1569–1641), to stay the Roman Catholic tendencies of Mary, Countess of Buckingham. He held two conferences; the third (24 May 1622) was entrusted to William Laud. White&#x27;s &quot;Replie&quot; to Fisher (1624) was dedicated to James I. On 14 September 1622 White was presented to the deanery of Carlisle (installed 15 October). He took part, in conjunction with Daniel Featley, in another discussion with Fisher, opened on 27 June 1623, at the house of Humphrey Lynde, in Sheer Lane, London.

In 1625 White became senior dean of Sion College, London, which existed then only on paper. He was consecrated Bishop of Carlisle on 3 December 1626 at Durham House, London, by Richard Neile, Bishop of Durham; John Buckeridge, Bishop of Rochester; and three other prelates, John Cosin preaching the consecration sermon. His elevation was much canvassed. It was said that he had &#x27;sold his orthodoxe bookes and bought Jesuits&#x27;.&#x27; Sir Walter Earle referred to the matter in parliament (11 February 1628), quoting the line &#x27;Qui color albus erat, nunc est contrarius albo&#x27;. He was made Lord Almoner the same year.

On 22 January 1629 he was elected Bishop of Norwich; and he was elected Bishop of Ely on 15 November 1631. Shortly afterwards he held a conference at Ely House, Holborn, with Theophilus Brabourne on the Sabbath question, and had much to do with Brabourne&#x27;s subsequent prosecution. His &quot;Treatise of the Sabbath-Day&quot; (1635; 3rd ed. 1636) was dedicated to Laud and written at the command of Charles I. White treated the question doctrinally; its historical aspect was assigned to Peter Heylyn. He visited Cambridge in 1632, to consecrate the chapel of Peterhouse. His last publication was &quot;An Examination and Confutation of . . . A Briefe Answer to a late Treatise of the Sabbath-Day&quot;, 1637; this &quot;Briefe Answer&quot; was a dialogue by Richard Byfield, with title &quot;The Lord&#x27;s Day is the Sabbath Day&quot; (1636). He died at Ely House, Holborn, in February 1638, and was buried in St. Paul&#x27;s Cathedral. His will, dated 4 March 1637, proved 27 February 1638 by his widow Joane White, shows that he survived a son, and left married daughters and several grandchildren; the bulk of his property went to his grandson Francis White.

Among many, White ordained Ralph Wheelock, Clare College graduate, and first schoolmaster of America&#x27;s first free school in Dedham, Massachusetts, on 6 May 1630.

== Theology ==
Francis White had an Arminian theology. In 1626, together with John Cosin they engaged in theological debate with Calvinist John Preston and Thomas Morton.

==Demographics==
Per Japanese census data, the population of Rokkasho has remained relatively stable over the past 70 years.

==History==
The area around Rokkasho was known for raising horses during the Kamakura period. During the Edo period, it was controlled by the Nanbu clan of Morioka Domain, becoming part of the territories of Shichinohe Domain in the latter half of the Edo period. With the establishment of the modern municipalities system after the start of the Meiji period, on April 1, 1889, the village of Rokkasho was created following the merger of six small hamlets.

==Government==
Rokkasho has a mayor-council form of government with a directly elected mayor and a unicameral village council of 18 members. Rokkasho is part of Kamikita District which contributes four members to the Aomori Prefectural Assembly. In terms of national politics, the town is part of Aomori 2nd district of the lower house of the Diet of Japan.

==Education==
Rokkasho has four public elementary schools and three public middle schools operated by the village government and one public high school operated by the Aomori Prefectural Board of Education.

==Economy==
The economy of Rokkasho has traditionally been dependent on agriculture and commercial fishing. From the 1980s onwards, the village has become a center for various energy developments, which now dominate the local economy. Rokkasho&#x27;s per capita income was $129,676 (1557,8000 Yen $1= 120.13 Yen )

===Nuclear industry and research ===
Nuclear fuel cycle related facilities:

* Japan Nuclear Fuel Limited headquarters
* The Rokkasho Reprocessing Plant (currently under test operation)
* A uranium enrichment plant and plutonium reprocessing plant.
* A MOX fuel fabrication facility with an 800-ton per year capacity when completed
* A low level nuclear waste storage facility
* A high level nuclear waste temporary storage and monitoring facility

The Japan Atomic Energy Agency also has multiple facilities at the site like the Linear IFMIF Prototype Accelerator (LIPAc) devoted to the Fusion Energy Development Programme under the European Union-Japan Broader Approach agreement.

Since the 1970s, local opposition to plans to operate Japan&#x27;s first large commercial plutonium plant at Rokkasho have focused on the threat of a large-scale release of radioactivity. During the 1990s anti-nuclear groups in Japan released studies showing the risks of routine operation of the Rokkasho Reprocessing Plant. The facility in full operation is designed to separate as much as 8 tons of plutonium each year from spent reactor fuel from Japan&#x27;s domestic nuclear reactors. As of 2006 Japan owned approximately 45 tons of separated plutonium.

In May, 2006, an international awareness campaign about the dangers of the Rokkasho reprocessing plant, Stop Rokkasho, was launched by musician Ryuichi Sakamoto. Greenpeace has opposed operation of the Rokkasho Reprocessing Plant under a campaign called &quot;Wings of Peace: No more Hiroshima, Nagasaki. Stop Rokkasho&quot;, since 2002 and has launched a cyberaction to stop the project.

Rokkasho was a candidate to host the plasma fusion reactor ITER, but lost out to Cadarache, France. Rokkasho has been hosting the Helios high-performance supercomputer centre capable of performing complex plasma physics calculations for fusion research, since January 2012.

==History==
Kamikita District was part of ancient , established by the Northern Fujiwara. During the Edo period, the area was part of the Morioka han feudal domain of the Nanbu clan, with daikansho located in Noheji and Shichinohe.

The Nanbu clan sided with the Ōuetsu Reppan Dōmei during the Boshin War of the Meiji Restoration and were punished by the new Meiji government by loss of their northern territories. In November 1869, Kita-gun and neighboring Sannohe District became part of the newly created , a 30,000 koku holding created to resettle the dispossessed Matsudaira clan from Aizu-Wakamatsu. In July 1871, with the abolition of the han system, Tonami Domain became Tonami Prefecture, and was merged into the newly created Aomori Prefecture in September 1871.

During the early Meiji period administrative reorganization of Japan on July 22, 1878, Kamikita and Shimokita were divided from former Kita County, and Kamikita was divided into 50 villages. In the cadastral reform of April 1, 1889, the number of villages was reduced through consolidations and mergers to sixteen.

<text>Moonlight consists of mostly sunlight (with little earthlight) reflected from the parts of the Moon&#x27;s surface where the Sun&#x27;s light strikes.

==History==
The ancient Greek philosopher Anaxagoras was aware that &quot;the sun provides the moon with its brightness&quot;.

==Illumination==
The intensity of moonlight varies greatly depending on the lunar phase, but even the full moon typically provides only about 0.05–0.1 lux illumination. When a full Moon around perigee (a &quot;supermoon&quot;) is viewed around upper culmination from the tropics, the illuminance can reach up to 0.32 lux. From Earth, the apparent magnitude of the full Moon is only about that of the Sun.

The color of moonlight, particularly around full moon, appears bluish to the human eye compared to other, brighter light sources due to the Purkinje effect. The blue or silver appearance of the light is an illusion. 

The Moon&#x27;s Bond albedo averages 0.136, meaning only 13.6% of incident sunlight is reflected from the lunar surface. Moonlight takes approximately 1.26 seconds to reach Earth&#x27;s surface. Scattered in Earth&#x27;s atmosphere, moonlight generally increases the brightness of the night sky, reducing contrast between dimmer stars and the background. For this reason, many astronomers usually avoid observing sessions around a full moon.

==Gallery==
==Folklore==
In folklore, moonlight sometimes has a harmful influence. For example, sleeping in the light of a full Moon on certain nights was said to transform a person into a werewolf. The light of the Moon was thought to worsen the symptoms of lunatics, and to sleep in moonlight could make one blind, or mad. Nyctalopia (night blindness caused by a lack of vitamin A) was thought to be caused by sleeping in moonlight in the tropics.

&quot;Moon blindness&quot; is a name for equine recurrent uveitis. Moonlight is no longer thought of as the cause.

In the 16th century, moonmilk, a soft white limestone precipitate found in caves, was thought to be caused by the rays of the Moon.

Selenoplexia was a supposed medical condition caused by the rays of the moon.

==Art==
In 2008 Katie Paterson produced an artwork titled &quot;Light bulb to Simulate Moonlight&quot;. It consists of 289 lightbulbs coated to produce a similar spectrum to the light of the full Moon.

<doc id="929148" wikidata="Q1163828" url="?curid=929148" title="Daniell (crater)">
<text>Daniell is a lunar impact crater located in the southern half of the Lacus Somniorum. To the south-southeast is the much larger crater Posidonius. The Rimae Daniell rille system are to the west of Daniell crater.

The rim of Daniell is oval in form, with the long axis oriented north-northwest to south-southeast. Most of the wall is well-formed and relatively free of wear, although it appears slumped at the southern end. The interior lacks a central peak. The floor surface has a lower albedo than the surroundings and is fractured. Lunar geologist Chuck Wood speculated that the fractured floor may have been uplifted by the massive slumps on northwest and southeast rims.

The crater was named in 1935 by the IAU after British physicist, chemist, meteorologist John F. Daniell.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Daniell.

<doc id="929149" wikidata="Q11477748" url="?curid=929149" title="Kawauchi, Aomori">
<text>was a town located in Shimokita District in northern Aomori Prefecture, Japan.

Kawauchi Village was founded in 1889 from the merger the hamlets of Kawauchi, Hinokigawa, Shukunohe, and Kakizaki. It was elevated to town status on October 31, 1917.

On March 14, 2005, Kawauchi, along with the neighboring town of Ōhata, and the village of Wakinosawa (all from Shimokita District), was merged into the neighboring and expanded city of Mutsu, and thus no longer exists as an independent municipality.

Located in southern Shimokita Peninsula facing Mutsu Bay, the town of Kawauchi had an economy based on commercial fishing (scallops and sea cucumber), forestry and agriculture (rice, tobacco).

At the time of its merger, the town had an estimated population of 5,309 and a population density of 16.4 persons per km2. The total area was 323.67 km2.

Kawauchi was served by Route 338 highway, but had no railway service.

<doc id="929155" wikidata="Q1853623" url="?curid=929155" title="Touch and Go Records">
<text>Touch and Go Records is an American independent record label based in Chicago, Illinois. After its genesis as a handmade fanzine in 1979, it grew into one of the key record labels in the American 1980s underground and alternative rock scenes. Touch &amp; Go carved out a reputation for releasing adventurous noise rock by the likes of Big Black, the Butthole Surfers, and The Jesus Lizard. Touch &amp; Go helped to spearhead the nationwide network of underground bands that formed the pre-Nirvana indie rock scene, and helped preside over the shift from the hardcore punk that then dominated the American underground scene to the more diverse styles of alternative rock emerging at the time.

==History==
The zine was formed in 1979 in East Lansing, Michigan as Touch and Go magazine, a self-printed fanzine written and produced by Tesco Vee and Dave Stimson. It wasn&#x27;t until 1981 that it grew into an independent record label. Vee (later front man of The Meatmen) was bored with the punk sounds of the day, and captivated by the emerging hardcore movement in America. Inspired, he put out records by the Necros, The Fix, The Meatmen, and Negative Approach. In 1981, Necros bassist Corey Rusk joined with Tesco to run the label. In 1983, Tesco handed Touch and Go over to Rusk and his wife Lisa when he left Michigan for Washington, D.C. With the label under their ownership, the Rusks hired Terry Tolkin who signed the Butthole Surfers and Virgin Prunes to the label, and also produced the &quot;Gods Favorite Dog&quot; compilation. Soon the Rusks relocated the label to Chicago, and Touch and Go released material in the mid-&#x27;80s to mid-&#x27;90s by bands such as the Butthole Surfers, Big Black, the Jesus Lizard, Scratch Acid, the Didjits, Slint, Girls Against Boys and Killdozer, and continued into the new millennium with artists on its roster including Shellac, Yeah Yeah Yeahs, TV on the Radio, Arcwelder, CocoRosie, Ted Leo and the Pharmacists, and the Black Heart Procession. Lisa Rusk left the label after she and Corey divorced. Corey Rusk continues to run the label.

Touch and Go&#x27;s &quot;sister label,&quot; Quarterstick Records, was formed in 1990.

Similarly to some other alternative music labels, Touch and Go pursued a relaxed approach to recording contracts, characterized sometimes by handshake deals providing for a 50–50 split of profits between artist and label after promotion and production costs. In this way, the label built a respected catalog of influential punk and alternative artists, who in turn, appreciated the commitment of Touch and Go. However, following a 1999 legal dispute with the Butthole Surfers, Touch and Go began asking bands to sign a 1-2 page memorandum of intent.

In 2006, Touch and Go celebrated its 25th anniversary. To commemorate this occasion, the label held a three-day block party event at Chicago&#x27;s Hideout venue on September 8–10, 2006. Several seminal bands, including Big Black, Scratch Acid, the Didjits, Killdozer, Negative Approach, and Man or Astro-man? reunited and performed at the Chicago event.

On February 18, 2009, Corey Rusk announced that Touch and Go would downsize itself. He cited the &quot;current state of the economy&quot; as the reason for shutting down manufacturing and distribution services for many independent labels like Jade Tree, Kill Rock Stars, and Merge Records.

Since 2009, Touch and Go has specialized in releasing limited editions of releases from its bands and other associated acts, like the remastered 30th anniversary of Slint&#x27;s &quot;Spiderland&quot;, but has also released new material, like Shellac&#x27;s &quot;To All Trains&quot;. 

==Book==

Touch and Go: The Complete Hardcore Punk Zine &#x27;79–&#x27;83 is a 576-page trade paperback book containing all 22 issues of the Touch and Go zine.

The book consists of the writings of Tesco Vee and Dave Stimson - the founders and designers of the Touch and Go zine - which eventually evolved into Touch and Go Records, owned by Corey Rusk. The book contains many forewords and introductions written by Tesco Vee, Dave Stimson, Steve Miller, Barry Henssler, Henry Rollins, Keith Morris, Peter Davis, Henry Owings, Byron Coley, Corey Rusk, John Brannon and Ian MacKaye.

The zine, which is chronicled in the book, contains early reviews and features on bands like Black Flag, Circle Jerks, Wire, Minor Threat, Teen Idles, The Necros, Gang of Four, among others.

The book was released on June 30, 2010. It was published by Bazillion Points Publishing.

==Controversy==
Touch and Go&#x27;s approach to contracts was challenged in a court case started in 1999 by the Butthole Surfers, who purported that Touch and Go was not marketing its previously released material effectively. The band argued that because its contract with the label was of an unspecified duration, the contract could be terminated. Touch and Go argued that according to existing US copyright law, it controlled the copyright to the band&#x27;s recordings for a minimum of 35 years, based on sec. 203 of the Copyright Act of 1976.

The US Court of Appeals Seventh Circuit ruled in favor of the band, determining that &quot;when a contract is silent as to its length, it is implicit that it can be terminated by either side,&quot; and that &quot;allowing terminations under Illinois law does not conflict with sec. 203, but rather is, in fact, in keeping with the intent of sec. 203.&quot;

==Geography==
Higashidōri occupies the northeastern coastline of Shimokita Peninsula, facing the Pacific Ocean to the east and Tsugaru Strait to the north, with Cape Shiriya forming a boundary between the two waters. The low Shimokita Hills run north-south through the center of the village. Mount Kuwabata, the highest point in the village at an elevation of 402 meters. To the west of the Shimokita Hills is the Tanabe Plain, which borders Mutsu City. There are large sand dunes and several swamps near the eastern coast, and many rivers flow to the sea. Hamlets are scattered throughout the coastline of the village, which does not have a well-defined center. Parts of the village are within the limits of the Shimokita Hantō Quasi-National Park. In the year 2002, the Ministry of the Environment classified some tidal flats of the Higashidōri shoreline to be one of the 500 Important Wetlands in Japan and an important wintering place for Brent geese

The temperatures are highest on average in August, at around 21.4 °C, and lowest in January, at around -3.0 °C.

==Demographics==
Per Japanese census data, the population of Higashidōri peaked around the year 1960 and has declined over the past 60 years.

==History==
The area around Higashidōri was inhabited by the &quot;Emishi&quot; people, with archaeological remains dating to the Jōmon period. During the Edo period, it was controlled by the Nambu clan of Morioka Domain, but was a sparsely populated area with scattered fishing hamlets. With the establishment of the modern municipalities system on 1 April 1889, Higashidōri Village was proclaimed from the merger of twelve small hamlets, although the village administrative center was kept within the town hall of neighboring Tanabu Town (now part of the city of Mutsu). In 1988, to celebrate its 100th anniversary as a village, a village hall was finally built within the borders of Higashidōri.

==Government==

Shimokita District was part of ancient , established by the Northern Fujiwara. During the Edo period, the area was part of the Morioka han feudal domain of the Nanbu clan, with a daikansho located in Tanabu (now part of the city of Mutsu.

The Nanbu clan sided with the Ōuetsu Reppan Dōmei during the Boshin War of the Meiji Restoration and were punished by the new Meiji government by loss of their northern territories. In November 1869, Kita-gun and neighboring Sannohe District became part of the newly created , a 30,000 koku holding created to resettle the dispossessed Matsudaira clan from Aizu-Wakamatsu.

<doc id="929163" wikidata="Q1362324" url="?curid=929163" title="Gonohe">
<text>is a town located in Aomori Prefecture, Japan. , the town had an estimated population of 16,013 in 7027 households, and a population density of 90 persons per km2. The total area of the town is .

== Geography ==
Gonohe is located in the north-eastern part of Sannohe District, approximately 16 kilometres west of Hachinohe City and 10 kilometres southeast of Towada City. The town is adjacent to Hachinohe City to the east, Shingō Village to the west, Nanbu Town to the south, and Towada City, Oirase Town and Rokunohe Town to the north. The land extends 16.8 kilometres east to west and 18.55 kilometres north to south.

The Gonohegawa River, which flows from Mt. Heraidake into the Pacific Ocean, and the Asamizugawa River, which originates from a hot spring swamp to join the Mabechi River, run parallel to each other through the town. While embracing these two rivers, residential areas have formed, and rice fields can be found in the flat areas that benefit from the favourable flows of water. The slightly sloped hillside areas spread to the east of the Ōu Mountains and are utilized as crop fields and apple orchards. Forests occupy more than half of the town&#x27;s total area.

===Neighbouring municipalities===

*Nanbu

*Rokunohe
*Shingō
*Towada

===Climate===
The type of weather most characteristic of the region is the &quot;yamase&quot;, the easterly winds which bring cold air in summer. In Gonohe, the &quot;yamase&quot; brings rain and, when such conditions last for a long time, harvests are significantly affected because of the low temperatures and lack of sunshine. However, the town receives relatively less snow than its location in northern Tōhoku would otherwise suggest. The town falls within the Köppen climate classification &quot;Cfa&quot;. The average annual temperature in Gonohe is 9.9 °C. The average annual rainfall is 1205 mm with September as the wettest month. The temperatures are highest on average in August, at around 22.8 °C, and lowest in January, at around -2.1 °C.

==Demographics==
Per Japanese census data, the population of Gonohe has steadily declined over the past 70 years.

== History ==
The most common meanings of the &quot;kanji&quot; used in the town&#x27;s name (五戸) are &quot;five&quot; and &quot;door/gate,&quot; respectively. However, in the case of Gonohe (and other similar place names in the region), it is believed that the second character in the name carries the meaning of &#x27;ranch,&#x27; with the town name being derived from a numbered fortified stockade system developed by the Nanbu clan who once ruled in the region. In 1189, during the Kamakura period, Nanbu Mitsuyuki, a retainer of Minamoto no Yoritomo from Kai Province was awarded the Nukanobu (糠部) district of far northern Mutsu Province after the defeat of the Northern Fujiwara clan. The land was found to be suitable for raising warhorses, for which the region became famous. The area was part of Hachinohe Domain under the Edo period Tokugawa shogunate.

In April 1889, with the introduction of the modern municipalities system, the area became Gonohe Village. In November 1915, the village was elevated to town status. In July 1955, Gonohe Town was combined with neighboring Kawauchi and Asada villages; this also included incorporating part of the Tekurabashi area of Nozawa Village and the Toyomauchi area of Toyosaki Village. The town merged with the neighbouring village of Kuraishi on April 1, 2012. In recent years there has been a small community of repatriated Manchukuoan Japanese living in Kuraishi.

==Government==
Gonohe has a mayor-council form of government with a directly elected mayor and a unicameral town council of 16 members. Tōhoku is part of Sannohe District which contributes three members to the Aomori Prefectural Assembly. In terms of national politics, the town is part of Aomori 2nd district of the lower house of the Diet of Japan.

== Local culture ==
In its earlier history Gonohe enjoyed a reputation as a breeding centre for horses of exceptional quality, popular amongst the samurai. With the decline of the samurai, Gonohe&#x27;s horses continued to be bred for their meat. The lean horse meat is coveted as a delicacy, especially when served in its raw form, known as . This dish is a specialty of both Gonohe and Kumamoto in southern Kyūshū. After horses, Gonohe is best known for the local popularity of soccer.

== Economy ==
The key industry of the town is agriculture, with a focus mainly on producing vegetables, rice and livestock. Since the town was designated a new industrial city of the Hachinohe region, inland industries have developed in the Jizodaira Industrial Estate, where 20 companies are now in operation.

==Education==
Gonohe has four public elementary schools and three public middle schools operated by the town government and one public high school operated by the Aomori Prefectural Board of Education.

==International relations==

* Okcheon, Chungcheongbuk-do, South Korea since 1997

=== Recent controversy===
On 28 June 2001, the town&#x27;s Korean &quot;sister city&quot; Okcheon cancelled a planned trip to send students, on an exchange visit to Gonohe in reaction to approvals by the Japanese government of a series of middle school history textbooks that were regarded by Korea as distorting historical facts. The event was preceded by a related incident in April of that year, when a group of Gonohe assemblymen cancelled a planned visit to Korea that May, citing financial difficulties.

==Transportation==
===Railway===
The Tōhoku Shinkansen passes through Gonohe, but the town has had no passenger railway services after the discontinuation of the Nambu Junkan Railway in 1968, which previously connected it to Hachinohe.

<text>Dawes is a lunar impact crater located in the wide straight between Mare Serenitatis and Mare Tranquilitatis. To its southwest lies the larger crater Plinius, and to its northeast sits the Mons Argaeus mountain rise. It is named after British astronomer William Rutter Dawes.

==Description==
Dawes is circular with a sharp rim that has a slightly flattened oval perimeter. It has a slight central rise, and a somewhat darker floor that is nearly covered in overlapping swirl-like deposits. Much of the deposits are slumped or fall-back material. The inner walls are steep and free from impact erosion. Northeast of Dawes is a rille known as Rima Dawes.

Detailed examination of this crater has located what appear to be alcoves and channels along the inner rim. It is hypothesized that micrometeorite impacts along the rim trigger dry landslides, which produce a gully-like appearance. A similar phenomenon may be responsible for gully-like features along the inner rim of some Martian craters.

<text>A toroidal mirror is a reflector whose surface is a section of a torus, defined by two radii of curvature. Such reflectors are easier to manufacture than mirrors with a surface described by a paraboloid or ellipsoid. They suffer from spherical aberration and coma, but do not suffer from astigmatism like a spherical mirror when used in an off-axis geometry, provided the angle of incidence is matched to the design angle. Because they are easier to manufacture, they are much cheaper than ellipsoidal or paraboloidal mirrors for the same surface quality.

Toroidal mirrors are used in Yolo telescopes and optical monochromators. In these devices, the source and detectors of the light are not located on the optical axis of the mirror, so the use of a true paraboloid of revolution would cause a distorted image.

<text>Ariola (also known as Ariola Records, Ariola Express, Ariola-Eurodisc and BMG Ariola) is a German record label. In the late 1980s, it was a subsidiary label of the Bertelsmann Music Group, which in turn has become a part of the international media conglomerate Sony Music Entertainment.

==Profile==
Ariola Eurodisc GmbH was founded in 1958 as a music outlet of Bertelsmann. It set up several foreign subsidiaries. Leveraging acquisitions by its parent company, Ariola positioned itself to become a strong contender in the German record industry in the mid-1960s. Ariola America was founded in 1975 in Los Angeles, and achieved &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine number one singles with Mary MacGregor&#x27;s &quot;Torn Between Two Lovers&quot; (1976) and Amii Stewart&#x27;s cover version of the 1966 Eddie Floyd hit &quot;Knock on Wood&quot; (1979). Other artists on the Ariola America roster during the late 1970s included Gene Cotton, The Three Degrees, Chanson, and the Canadian band Prism among others. After its pop success dried up, Ariola America found success in the Spanish language market including José José and Rocío Dúrcal from the late 1970s onward and Mexican artist Marisela starting in the 1990s. Other subsidiaries include Ariola-Athena to release spoken word records; Ariola Benelux was founded in 1970 to cover the Benelux market; Ariola Eurodisc S.A. was a Spanish division of Ariola, founded in 1970; Ariola UK, the UK based subsidiary of Ariola, was founded in 1977; Baccarola; Türküola, a subsidiary for the Turkish market; Eurodisc to release classical records in Europe and Arabella to release disco records in France - most successfully with Amanda Lear, Giorgio Moroder (house producer of Ariola); and Jupiter Records for German Schlager music and disco artists such as Dschinghis Khan.

It acquired both Arista Records and German rival label Hansa Records in 1979. It sold 50% of Arista to RCA Records in 1983; after a brief joint venture between RCA and Ariola, RCA (including its record division) was acquired by General Electric who promptly sold RCA&#x27;s stake in the venture back to Ariola. Ariola America also had a sister label called Ocean Records, which included on its roster actress/entertainer Ann-Margret. It was active 1979 through 1980. In the 1980s, there was a software development division called Ariolasoft.

Today, Ariola is a unit of Sony Music Group and is still active in Germany under the Sony Group Corporation umbrella.

<doc id="929173" wikidata="Q1116512" url="?curid=929173" title="1990 Commonwealth Games">
<text>The 1990 Commonwealth Games () were held in Auckland, New Zealand from 24 January – 3 February 1990. It was the 14th Commonwealth Games, and part of New Zealand&#x27;s 1990 sesquicentennial celebrations. Participants competed in ten sports: athletics, aquatics, badminton, boxing, cycling, gymnastics, judo, lawn bowls, shooting and weightlifting. Netball and the Triathlon were demonstration events.

The main venue was the Mount Smart Stadium.

==Host selection==
The event was awarded to Auckland on 27 July 1984 at the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, United States. Perth, Australia, had withdrawn from the bid contest leaving New Delhi, India, as the sole opponent to Auckland&#x27;s bid. New Delhi lost the hosting rights to Auckland by a margin of 1 vote, which made it the closest host selection vote in the history of Commonwealth Games 
==Opening ceremony==
The opening of the games comprised a variety of events, including the arrival of The Queen&#x27;s representative Prince Edward (her youngest son), the arrival of the Queen&#x27;s Baton, and many Māori ceremonial stories. The Queens Baton was carried across the Auckland Harbour by the vessel &quot;Ceduna&quot;.

The opening ceremony itself started off with the Auckland Commonwealth Games Choir singing the &quot;Song of Welcome&quot;. Upon the arrival of Prince Edward, the Māori in attendance, gave him a &quot;Challenge of a welcome&quot;. This is conducted by a Māori placing a wooden baton on the ground. To see if the visitor comes in peace or not, the visitor must pick it up.

The New Zealand national anthem &quot;God Defend New Zealand&quot; was sung during a ceremonial fourteen gun salute from nearby One Tree Hill. This was followed by the New Zealand Army Guard Commander allowing Prince Edward to inspect the guard of honour. After which was the introduction of the participating countries of the Commonwealth, Scotland entering first as the hosts of the previous games, and New Zealand entering last as hosts. During the introduction of the countries, the choir would display the flag of the announced country with boards.

When all the athletes finally sat down, the cultural segment ceremonies began.The first act was the Māori women performing a &quot;Song of Welcome&quot; for the athletes with the use of Poi. The Māori women then gave some of the athletes a Hongi. Next was the Māori story of how New Zealand was formed according to legend; it a narration of how the Polynesians found their way to what was to become New Zealand, and how New Zealand was formed between Rangi and Papa, the sky father and earth mother. The story then moved on to the coming of religion and European migration. This was demonstrated with a formation of the Union Jack, to show the colonisation by the British. Dame Whina Cooper then made a speech about the Treaty of Waitangi signed in 1840 that brought about peace and stability of modern New Zealand.

Introduction of the European communities was next with music and native dancing from European countries such as Italy, Poland, Greece, Netherlands, Scotland, Ireland, Austria, Wales and England, and music and native dancing also from Asian countries such as China, Sri Lanka and India. From here, many of the neighbouring Pacific Islanders made their entrance with the rhythmic tempo of the Pacific Island drum beat.This was to show the then complete migration of people to New Zealand.

Sir Howard Morrison then lead New Zealand in singing the folk song Tukua-a-hau. After Morrison, the Queen&#x27;s Baton arrived at the stadium where Prince Edward announced the opening of the games which was followed by the &quot;Athletes Pledge&quot;.

Fireworks followed and was capped off with a night time flyover by nine A-4 Skyhawk jets of the Royal New Zealand Air Forces 75 Squadron. The ceremony was concluded by the singing of the game&#x27;s motto &quot;This is the moment&quot; as performers and athletes exited the stadium.

==Closing ceremony==
A more relaxed affair was held for the 14th Commonwealth Games closing ceremony. Attended by HM The Queen of New Zealand, formality and respect played their due part in the beginning with protocolar segment with the handover to the Commonwealth Games flag to the next host city, Victoria, Canada. This was followed by a First Nations and modern Canadian dancing display.

Next, thousands of children entered the stadium with a mass skipping rope demonstration, followed by the athletes. The Queen then made the traditional closing speech and called for all the Commonwealth&#x27;s athletes to assemble in four years time in Victoria. As the evening wore on Dame Kiri Te Kanawa sang &quot;Now is the Hour&quot;, a favourite New Zealand hymn, as the Royal New Zealand Air Force’s A4 Skyhawks made one final swooping flyover of Mount Smart Stadium followed by fireworks. The Queen, Duke of Edinburgh, and Prince Edward then exited the stadium standing in open top vehicles.

==Mascot==

The mascot of the games was Goldie, representing New Zealand&#x27;s national symbol the kiwi bird.

==Participating teams==

55 teams were represented at the 1990 Games.(Teams competing for the first time are shown in bold).


==Medals by country==
This is the full table of the medal count of the 1990 Commonwealth Games. These rankings sort by the number of gold medals earned by a country. The number of silvers is taken into consideration next and then the number of bronze. If, after the above, countries are still tied, equal ranking is given and they are listed alphabetically. This follows the system used by the IOC, IAAF and BBC.

==History==
During the Edo period, the area was part of the Morioka han feudal domain of the Nanbu clan, with portions belonging to Hachinohe Domain and Shichinohe Domain. 
The Nanbu clan sided with the Ōuetsu Reppan Dōmei during the Boshin War of the Meiji Restoration and were punished by the new Meiji government by loss of their northern territories. In November 1869, large portions of Kita-gun (Shimokita and Kamikita) and Sannohe District became part of the newly created , a 30,000 koku holding created to resettle the dispossessed Matsudaira clan from Aizu-Wakamatsu. In July 1871, with the abolition of the han system, Tonami Domain became Tonami Prefecture, and was merged into the newly created Aomori Prefecture in September 1871.

During the early Meiji period cadastral reform of April 1, 1889, the district was reorganized into two towns and 31 villages.

<text>The Environmental Transport Association (ETA) is a British carbon-neutral provider of vehicle breakdown, bicycle, and travel insurance for the environmentally concerned consumer. The ETA aims to raise awareness of the impact that transport has on the environment and help individuals and organizations make positive changes in their travel habits. They offer breakdown and road rescue services for cyclists, mobility scooter users, and motorists.

In 2015, the ETA was voted Britain&#x27;s most ethical insurance company by the Good Shopping Guide.

== Promotional vehicles ==

The ETA has built a number of unusual vehicles over recent years to promote sustainable transport as well as its own insurance products, two of which have gained Guinness World Records. The Guinness World Record for QTvan is a tiny caravan designed to be towed behind a bicycle or mobility scooter and is officially recognized as the world&#x27;s smallest caravan. 
The Hornster was designed and built as a way of highlighting the danger posed to cyclists by lorries in urban areas. The bike is fitted with the air horn from a freight train, which is powered by a SCUBA diving cylinder and has been judged by Guinness World Records to be the world&#x27;s loudest bicycle horn. 
The BOND bike was built by the ETA in response to the frustrations faced by urban cyclists; it features a handlebar-mounted flamethrower to dissuade motorists from overtaking too close, a caterpillar track to negotiate potholes, and an ejector seat to deal with bike thieves.

== History ==

The ETA was founded in 1990 and became carbon neutral in 2002. It conducts and commissions research into environmental transport issues. It actively lobbies the government and key decision-makers to discuss new thinking in environmental transport. They claim to be the world&#x27;s first climate-neutral motoring organization. The ETA was a founding member of Transport and the Environment promoting sustainable transport in Europe; which means an approach to transport that is environmentally responsible, economically sound, and socially just.

1992 - Green Transport Week is launched in Weybridge.

1993 - The ETA publishes Britain&#x27;s first Car Buyers&#x27; Guide for people wanting to buy greener vehicles.

1995 - Sets up Walk to School Day in Hertfordshire as part of Green Transport Week.
1995: Sets up a charitable trust.

1997 - The ETA inaugurated the world&#x27;s first national Car Free Day as part of Green Transport Week, which is now held on 22 September every year. In 2014 Car Free Days were held in Beijing, Moscow, and Washington.

1998 - Founder member of the Slower Speeds Initiative.

1997 - Began the &quot;20&#x27;s Plenty&quot; campaign for urban streets and rural lanes. Via the 20&#x27;s Plenty for Us organisation - partially funded by the ETA, an estimated 13 million people will be living on streets at 20 mph within the year.

2002 - The ETA Trust, a charity, became limited by guarantee.

2008 - ETA Services Ltd., the services arm, and ETA Trust, the campaigning arm, separate. ETA Services funds the ETA Trust through a proportion of its revenue.

2012 - Began the pop-up zebra crossing campaign

2014 - Established the &quot;Back on a Bike&quot; campaign

2015 - Voted Britain&#x27;s most ethical insurance company by the Good Shopping Guide

<doc id="929184" wikidata="Q1048895" url="?curid=929184" title="Sardinian pika">
<text>The Sardinian pika (Prolagus sardus) is an extinct species of lagomorph that was endemic to the islands of Sardinia, Corsica and neighbouring Mediterranean islands until its extinction likely in Roman times. It was the last surviving member of &quot;Prolagus,&quot; a genus of lagomorph with a fossil record spanning 20 million years once widespread throughout Europe during the Miocene and Pliocene epochs. Its closest living relatives are modern pikas (which all belong to the genus &quot;Ochotona&quot;), from which it is estimated to have diverged around 30 million years ago.

==Anatomy==

The full skeletal structure of the Sardinian pika was reconstructed in 1967, thanks to the numerous finds of bones in Corbeddu Cave, which is near Oliena, Sardinia. Some years later, from these remains, the same researchers led by paleontologist Mary R. Dawson from the US were able to create a plaster reconstruction with good accuracy, and provide a thorough description of the skeleton&#x27;s morphology published in 1969. The Sardinian pika was probably much stockier and more robust than extant species of pikas, and it probably resembled a sort of cross between a large wild rabbit and a pika. The first articulated skeletons of &quot;P. sardus&quot; were reported in 2016.

&quot;Prolagus sardus&quot; weighed about . This is more than its ancestor &quot;Prolagus figaro&quot;, which is the only other member of &quot;Prolagus&quot; that was found in Sardinia and weighed about , and is larger than most mainland species of &quot;Prolagus.&quot;

Compared to mainland species of &quot;Prolagus&quot;, &quot;P. sardus&quot; had larger and more hypsodont (high crowned) teeth. The Sardinian pika experienced anagenic evolution, with an increasing body size and shifting dental morphology over time.
==Ecology==
Abundant fossil and subfossil remains of &quot;P. sardus&quot; are known from several localities across Corsica and Sardinia hint at the once broad geographical range of this &quot;Prolagus&quot; species: it lived from sea level up to at least 800 m (2,624 ft.) in a variety of habitats (grasslands, shrublands). Its morphology suggests that it was capable of traversing rocky terrain, and was probably a proficient jumper and capable of digging, but was not adapted for running. The tooth hypsodonty has been suggested to have been an adaptation to an abrasive diet. The abundance of mass accumulations of broken bones (bone beds) suggest that the population density was high. A sample of Late Pleistocene specimens from Medusa Cave, Sardinia found that they had a high incidience rate of arthritis relative to extant lagomorphs. This is suggested to be the result of ageing due to having a longer lifespan than mainland lagomorphs. Skeletochronology suggests that individuals of &quot;Prolagus sardus&quot; reached a lifespan of approximately 8 years, which is longer than mainland lagomorphs of equivalent size.

The Sardinian pika was likely preyed on by the two native species of terrestrial carnivores, a canine (the Sardinian dhole), and a mustelid (&quot;Enhydrictis galictoides&quot;) which were specialized for hunting small prey. Other likely predators include birds of prey such as the endemic owl species &quot;Bubo insularis&quot;. 

==Evolution and extinction==
The taxonomy of &quot;Prolagus&quot; has been the subject of controversy. It is either considered a member of the family Ochotonidae, which includes living pikas (which all belong to the genus &quot;Ochotona&quot;), or the only member of the family Prolagidae. A partial mitochondrial genome from &quot;Prolagus sardus&quot; suggests that &quot;Prolagus&quot; is more closely related to living pikas than to Leporidae, which contains rabbits and hares, with an estimated divergence between living pikas and &quot;Prolagus&quot; about 30 million years ago.The earliest species of &quot;Prolagus&quot; appeared in Europe during the Early Miocene, around 20 million years ago. The ancestor of the Sardinian pika, &quot;Prolagus figaro&quot;, arrived in the Corsican-Sardinian microcontinent at the early-late Pliocene boundary around 3.6 million years ago, likely due to an emergent land connection with Italy caused by a sea level drop. Amongst mainland species, the &quot;P. figaro-P. sardus&quot; lineage was previously thought to be most closely related to the species &quot;P. depereti&quot; known from the Pliocene of France, which was originally described as a subspecies of &quot;P. figaro&quot;. However, the oldest known remains of &quot;Prolagus&quot; from Sardinia, referred to as &quot;P. aff. figaro&quot;, show closer affinities to the species &quot;P. sorbinii&quot;, a species of Eastern European origin, which expanded westwards during the Messinian, the last stage of the Miocene, with well known remains from central Italy from the latest Miocene and early Pliocene. The oldest unambiguous remains of &quot;Prolagus sardus&quot; date back from the Middle Pleistocene, a time when both islands were periodically connected due to sea level changes. Reassessment of palaeontological data has shown that the distinction made by early authors between two contemporaneous taxa (&quot;P. sardus&quot; and &quot;P. corsicanus&quot;) is probably unfounded, as the Sardinian pika exhibits only subtle anagenetic evolution of its anatomy and body size through time.

Humans first arrived in Corsica-Sardinia around 10,000 years Before Present (BP). The presence of &quot;Prolagus&quot; facilitated the establishment of the first human communities of the islands. Jean-Denis Vigne found clear evidence that the Sardinian pika was hunted and eaten by people. He found that many of the Sardinian pikas&#x27; limb bones were broken and burnt at one end, suggesting that this animal had been roasted and eaten by the Neolithic colonists of Corsica.

The Sardinian pika became extinct in Sardinia sometime after 810 BC (based on radiocarbon dating), with records from Corsica suggesting that species survived there until sometime between 393 BC and the 6th century AD (overlapping with the period of Carthaginian and Roman Corsica). Its extinction was possibly due to agricultural practices, the introduction of predators (dogs, cats and small mustelids) and ecological competitors (rodents, rabbits and hares). Transmission of pathogens by rabbits and hares introduced to Sardinia and Corsica by the Romans may have also played a role in the species&#x27;s extinction. Other endemic small mammals like the shrew &quot;Asoriculus similis&quot;, the Tyrrhenian field rat, and the Tyrrhenian vole, probably also disappeared from Corsica and Sardinia around the same time.

==Historical references==
The 2nd century BCE Greek historian Polybius described in &quot;The Histories&quot; the presence of an animal in Corsica locally called the &quot;kyniklos&quot; which &quot;when seen from a distance looks like a small hare, but when captured it differs much from a hare in appearance and taste&quot; and which &quot;lives for the most part under the ground&quot;. This animal may have been the Sardinian pika, because Corsica at that time was not characterized by the occurrence of any species of hare. 

Survival of the Sardinian pika up into modern history has been hypothesised from the description of unknown mammals by later Sardinian authors; however, this interpretation remains dubious owing to anatomical discrepancies. The Medieval Italian poet Fazio Degli Uberti mentioned &quot;a small animal&quot; in Sardinia which was very timid and was called &quot;Solifughi&quot;, which means &quot;hiding from the sun&quot;, in his 1360 poem &quot;Dittamondo&quot; (&#x27;Song of the World&#x27;). In 1774, Francesco Cetti wrote that the island of Tavolara off the coast of Sardinia had &quot;giant rats whose burrows are so abundant that one might think the surface of the soil had been recently turned over by pigs&quot;, which has often been taken as a reference to the Sardinian pika. However, this was questioned by Barbara Wilkens in a 2000 publication, who suggested that it was more likely that the animals mentioned by Cetti were brown rats.

<text>Menelaus () is a young lunar impact crater located on the southern shore of Mare Serenitatis near the eastern end of the Montes Hæmus mountain range. Its diameter is 27 km. To the southwest is the small crater Auwers, and to the west-southwest is the even smaller Daubrée. To the northeast is a faint rille system named the Rimae Menelaus.

==Description==
The wall of Menelaus is slightly irregular in outline, with a high, sharp rim and d inner walls. The interior has a high albedo that is prominent under high sun angles. There are several ridges on the floor. It also has a moderate ray system, with the most prominent ray aligned to the north-northeast across the Mare Serenitatis. The location of this ray and slightly off-center central peak suggest an impact at a relatively low angle.

==Names==
Menelaus is named after the ancient Greek astronomer Menelaus of Alexandria. Like many of the craters on the Moon&#x27;s near side, it was given its name by Giovanni Riccioli, whose 1651 nomenclature system has become standardized. Earlier lunar cartographers had given the feature different names. Michael van Langren&#x27;s 1645 map calls it &quot;Mariae Imp. Rom.&quot; after Maria Anna, the Holy Roman Empress. And Johannes Hevelius called it &quot;Byzantium (urbs)&quot; after the city of Byzantium.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Menelaus.

The following craters have been renamed by the IAU.
* Menelaus S - &quot;See&quot; Daubrée.

<doc id="929187" wikidata="Q1855812" url="?curid=929187" title="Wouldham">
<text>Wouldham is a village on the bank of the River Medway in Kent, England. In 2011 its population was approximately 1500, which has increased since 2017, with substantial housing development to the south of the village. It has an 11th-century church, two schools – a primary school and one for those with special educational needs, and two public houses, The Medway Inn and The Waterman&#x27;s Arms. 

==History==
The tusk and teeth of a mammoth were excavated in Peters Pit and displayed in Rochester Guildhall Museum. In 1982, the skull of an 18-year-old teenager was excavated, dated as 1500 BC. Oral history suggests that the village was occupied when the Romans arrived, and that they constructed a ford across the Medway. The site of a temple dedicated to Mithras has been excavated and occurs on old maps. 
On the Wouldham Marshes is &quot;Starkey House&quot; built in 1483: a now restored Grade I listed medieval manor house called Starkey Castle.

In the churchyard, is the grave of Walter Burke, who was present on board at the battle of Trafalgar and the man who held Nelson in his arms as he died. 
Wouldham primary school celebrates this connection in several ways, with its four sports teams being named after ships at the Battle of Trafalgar (&quot;Victory&quot;, , &quot;Sovereign&quot;, ), students being assigned into a house named after one of four famous figures at Trafalgar, and by holding an annual event at the nearby church to commemorate Walter Burke.

A narwhal was discovered in the 1940s washed up on the bank of the river, and is documented in the Natural History Museum, London.

Until 1963 there was a ferry crossing over the Medway to Halling on the opposite bank.
==Industry==
For a hundred years, Wouldham was synonymous with cement. The Wouldham Court Cement Works was the earliest cement works, opening in 1847. The works were based on the riverside in the centre of the village. In 1855, the first owners of the cement works, Thomas Freen and Co, became bankrupt and in 1856 it passed to the Wouldham Patent Portland Cement Co. They built a tramway to connect the works with the quarry, 1,380 ft away.

The Wouldham Hall Cement Works also fronted the river, and took in some land in Burham. William Peters started making hydraulic lime on the site between 1857 and 1866. He had 18 lime kilns. The first wet process cement kilns were installed by the Peters Brothers in 1877.

The cement started with bottle kilns, with 24 in 1879, making 720 tons a week. The raw materials, were obtained on site and the finished product was taken to London in Thames sailing barges. The Peters operation owned 80 barges, and employed 1000 men. In the 1880s the kilns were replaced by Batchelor chamber kilns (each with a capacity of 30 tons per week), and further were added to bring up the production to 990 tons per week. In 1898 seventeen more were added, and in 1903 thee Schneider kilns (at 330 tons) giving a total capacity of 1850. Two Hoffmann kilns were installed, and then two rotary kilns. The first chamber kiln block was demolished, and the remaining chamber kilns were only used up to 1915, though six remained in commission until the sites closure.

The site was obtained by BPCM (Blue Circle) in 1911, who combined operations with the nearby West Kent works. The works closed in 1925/26 for good. There was no railway on this side of the river, so getting to the railway at Snodland involved taking the cement by barge across the river and then hauling it by horse and cart. This was uneconomical compared to the works across the river at Snodland, and Cuxton and Halling, with its rail connection on the Medway Valley line

==Peters Village==

Before 1999, a large area of allotments were situated between the school and the recreation ground. Despite the opposition of many villagers, a housing estate was built over them, which increased the village&#x27;s population by a large percentage.

Peters Village is a new area of housing being constructed since 2014 to the south of the existing village on the former Peters Wouldham Hall Cement Works and in Peters Pit. It consists of 1000 houses grouped in three sectors: the Village Centre, Lower Peters Village and Upper Peters Village. It includes a new primary school, community centre, playing fields cycle way and riverside esplanade together with a new road bridge across the River Medway. The site is sensitive as it lies adjoining a Site of Special Scientific Interest and the North Downs AONB. The plans were approved in 2006 but postponed due to the economic downturn. Construction started on the infrastructure in 2014. The first apartments and houses were occupied in late 2017. The project, which received £19.5m from the government, is due to be completed by 2024. The new crossing over the River Medway to link with the A228 road, the Peters Bridge, opened in September 2016.

<text>FC Spartak Moscow (, ) is a Russian professional football club based in Moscow. Having won 12 Soviet championships (second only to Dynamo Kyiv) and 10 Russian championships (a record jointly held with Zenit St Petersburg), it is the country&#x27;s most successful club. They have also won a record 10 Soviet Cups, 4 Russian Cups and one Russian Super Cup. Spartak have also reached the semi-finals of UEFA Europa League, UEFA Champions League and the UEFA Cup Winner&#x27;s Cup.

==History==

===Foundation and early period (1883–1941)===
In the early days of Soviet football, government agencies such as the police, army, and railroads created their own clubs. Many statesmen saw in the wins of their teams the superiority over the opponents patronising other teams. Almost all the teams had such kind of patrons; Dynamo Moscow aligned with the Militsiya, CSKA Moscow with the Red Army, and Spartak, created by a trade union public organization, was considered to be &quot;the people&#x27;s team&quot;.

The history of the football club and sports society &quot;Spartak&quot; originates from the Russian Gymnastics Society (), which was founded on 16 May 1883. The society was founded under the influence of the Pan-Slavic &quot;Sokol movement&quot; with the aim of promoting the &quot;Sokolsk gymnastics&quot; and then sports including fencing, wrestling, figure skating, skating, football, hockey, lawn tennis, boxing, skis, athletics, and cycling. In the RGO Sokol began to play football in the summer of 1897; the professional football section was founded in the spring of 1909. On 1 August 1920, the football team began to officially act under the name MCS, or Moscow Sports Club.

In 1923, the MCS, later named Krasnaya Presnya (Red Presnya), was formed by Ivan Artemyev and involved Nikolai Starostin, especially in its football team. Presnya is a district of Moscow renowned for the radical politics of its inhabitants; for example, it represented the centre of the Moscow uprising of 1905.

The team grew, building a stadium, supporting itself from ticket sales and playing matches across the Russian SFSR. As part of a 1926 reorganization of football in the Soviet Union, Starostin arranged for the club to be sponsored by the food workers union and the club moved to the 13,000 seat Tomsky Stadium, known as Pishcheviki. The team changed sponsors repeatedly over the following years as it competed with Dinamo Moscow, whose 35,000 seat Dynamo Stadium lay close by.

As a high-profile sportsman, Starostin came into close contact with Alexander Kosarev, secretary of the Komsomol (Communist Union of Youth) who already had a strong influence on sport and wanted to extend it. In November 1934, with funding from Promkooperatsiia, Kosarev employed Starostin and his brothers to develop his team to make it more powerful. Again the team changed its name, this time to &quot;Spartak Moscow&quot; (the name &quot;Spartak&quot; means &quot;Spartacus&quot;, a gladiator who led an uprising against Ancient Rome).

The club founders, four Starostin brothers, played a big role in the formation of the team. The Starostins played for the red-whites in the 1930s but right before World War II they were subjected to repression as the leaders of the most hated team by the state authorities. Elder brother Nikolai Starostin wrote in his books that he had survived in the State Prison System due to his participation in football and with Spartak (after the political rehabilitation, in 1954, he would later return to the team as the squad&#x27;s manager).

In 1935, Starostin proposed the name &quot;Spartak&quot;. It was inspired by the Italian novel &quot;Spartaco&quot;, written by Raffaello Giovagnoli, and means Spartacus (&quot;Spartak&quot; in Russian), a gladiator-slave who led a rebellion against Rome. Starostin is also credited with the creation of the Spartak logo. The same year, the club became a part of newly created Spartak sports society.

Czechoslovak manager Antonin Fivebr is credited as the first head coach of Spartak, though he worked as a consultant in several clubs simultaneously. In 1936, the Soviet Top League was established, where its first championship was won by Dynamo Moscow while Spartak won its second, which was held in the same calendar year. Before World War II, Spartak earned two more titles. In 1937, Spartak won the football tournament of Workers&#x27; Olympiad at Antwerp.

===Post-war period (1945–1991)===

During the 1950s, Spartak, together with Dynamo, dominated the Soviet Top League. When the Soviet national team won gold medals at the Melbourne Olympics, it consisted largely of Spartak players. Spartak captain Igor Netto was the captain of the national team from 1954 to 1963. In the 1960s, Spartak won two league titles, but by the mid-1960s, Spartak was no more regarded as a leading Soviet club. The club was even less successful in the 1970s and in 1976 Spartak was relegated into the lower league.

The following season in 1979, fans stayed with the team despite being relegated to the lower division, keeping the stadium full. Konstantin Beskov became the head coach. He had made his name playing for Spartak&#x27;s main rivals, Dynamo Moscow). He introduced several young players, including Rinat Dasayev and Georgi Yartsev. Spartak returned the following season and won the title in 1979, beating Dynamo Kyiv.

On 20 October 1982, disaster struck during the UEFA Cup match between Spartak and Dutch club HFC Haarlem. Sixty-six people died in a crowd crush during the match, making it Russia&#x27;s worst sporting disaster.

In 1989, Spartak won its last USSR Championship, rivals Dynamo Kyiv 2–1 in the closing round. Spartak&#x27;s striker Valery Shmarov scored the &quot;golden&quot; free kick with almost no time left. The next season, Spartak reached the European Cup semi-final, consequently eliminating Napoli on penalties and Real Madrid (with 3–1 away victory), but losing to Marseille.

===Modern period (1991–present)===
====Initial success (1991–2004)====

A new page in the club&#x27;s history began when the Soviet Union collapsed and its championship ceased to exist. In the newly created Russian league, Spartak, led by coach and president Oleg Romantsev, dominated and won all but one title between 1992 and 2001. Season after season the team also represented Russia in the Champions League.

Problems began in the new century, however. Several charismatic players (Ilya Tsymbalar and Andrey Tikhonov among others) left the club as a result of conflict with Romantsev. Later, Romantsev sold his stock to oil magnate Andrei Chervichenko, who in 2003 became the club president. The two were soon embroiled in a row that would continue until Romantsev was sacked in 2003 with the club suffering several sub-par seasons until Chervichenko finally sold his stock in 2004. The new ownership made a number of front office changes with the aim of returning the team to the top of the Russian Premier League.

Spartak has been entitled to place a golden star on its badge since 2003 to commemorate winning five Russian championships in 1992, 1993, 1994, 1996 and 1997. They have won the championship another four times since 1997.

====Title-less run (2004–2016)====
In 2004, Leonid Fedun became the club&#x27;s President and second-largest shareholder behind his business partner Vagit Alekperov.

In the 2005 season, Spartak, led by Aleksandrs Starkovs, finished second in the league to beat Lokomotiv Moscow, Zenit Saint Petersburg and Rubin Kazan to the last Champions League place. Following a mixed start to the 2006 season and public criticism from Dmitry Alenichev, the team&#x27;s captain and one of its most experienced players, Starkovs left his position to Vladimir Fedotov.

In the 2012–13 season, Spartak qualified for the 2012–13 UEFA Champions League group stage and finished last after disappointing performances against FC Barcelona, Celtic and Benfica. In the league, Spartak finished in fourth place while in the cup it was eliminated in the round of 16 by FC Rostov 0–0 , completing a disappointing season.

Since 2013, the club have added another three stars as rules allowed teams to include titles won during the Soviet era.

The next 3 seasons (2013–14, 2014–15, 2015–16) were somewhat similar as Spartak finished 6th, 6th and 5th accordingly while the club did not qualify for European Competitions.

====Revival (2016–2022)====
By the beginning of the 2016–17 season, under ex-Juventus manager Massimo Carrera, Spartak had acquired a squad consisting of foreign talents such as Quincy Promes, Fernando, Zé Luís, Lorenzo Melgarejo and Russians such as Denis Glushakov, Roman Zobnin and Ilya Kutepov. Spartak won the 2016–17 Russian Premier League with the squad, winning most derbies and ultimately finishing with a difference of 7 points.

The following season, Spartak participated in the 2017–18 UEFA Champions League group stage. Despite suffering its greatest ever loss in a 7-0 result against Liverpool F.C. at Anfield, the club achieved considerable victories, including a 5-1 win against Sevilla FC.

Having finished second 2020-21 Russian Premier League under manager Domenico Tedesco, whose contract expired at the season&#x27;s end, Spartak followed up with a successful run in the 2021–22 UEFA Europa League, now led by Rui Vitoria. Spartak topped its group, which included Napoli (which it defeated both home and away), Leicester City and Legia Warsaw. It was set to face RB Leipzig in the round of 16, but the club - along with all Russian club and national teams - was suspended from FIFA, UEFA and the ECA until further notice due to Russia&#x27;s invasion of Ukraine, and the clubs continued to play with themselves.

On 29 May 2022, in the final match of Paolo Vanoli (manager since December 2021), Spartak won the 2021–22 Russian Cup.

====New ownership (2022–present)====
On August 22, 2022, PJSC Lukoil Oil Company announced the acquisition of Spartak Moscow and Otkritie Arena. This occurred after numerous changes at the club, such as the appointment of Spanish specialist Guillermo Abascal as manager, his assistants Carlos Maria Valle Moreno and Vladimir Slišković, physical training coaches Fernando Perez Lopez and Alexander Zaichenko, and goalkeeper coach Vasily Kuznetsov. At 33 years of age, Abascal became the youngest manager in the club&#x27;s history. It was also reported that Leonid Fedun has resigned as President of the club and member of the board of directors. Under his leadership of more than 18 years, he left behind a mixed legacy. The club had won only a single Russian league, cup and supercup. Second place in the league was achieved six times, and four times the club head reached the group stage of the Champions League. A stadium solely for the use of the club was built for the first time. On September 26, 2022 Alexander Matytsyn, first vice president of Lukoil, became chairman of the board of directors of FC Spartak. Lukoil&#x27;s top managers Pavel Zhdanov, Ivan Maslyaev, and Yevgeny Khavkin joined the board of directors, as did Spartak&#x27;s general director Yevgeny Melezhikov (left the club in the summer of 2023), academy president Sergei Rodionov, as well as independent directors Oleg Malyshev and Yusuf Alekperov. Englishman Paul Ashworth was appointed sporting director.
In December 2023, it was announced that the club was reviving a second team, closed in 2022 due to lack of funding. It will be entered in the second league.

==Nickname==
The team is usually called &quot;red-and-whites,&quot; but among the fans &quot;The Meat&quot; (, &quot;Myaso&quot;) is a very popular nickname. The origins of the nickname belong to the days of the foundation of the club; in the 1920s, the team was renamed several times, from &quot;Moscow Sports Club&quot; to &quot;Red Presnya&quot; (after the name of one of the districts of Moscow) to &quot;Pishcheviki&quot; (&quot;Food industry workers&quot;) to &quot;Promkooperatsiya&quot; (&quot;Industrial cooperation&quot;) and finally to &quot;Spartak Moscow&quot; in 1935, and for many years the team was under patronage of one of the Moscow food factories that dealt with meat products.

One of the most favourite slogans of both the fans and players is, &quot;Who are we? We&#x27;re The Meat!&quot; (? Мясо!&quot;, &quot;Kto my? Myaso!&quot;)

==Rival teams and friendships==

At present, Spartak&#x27;s archrival is CSKA Moscow, although this is a relatively recent rivalry that has only emerged after the collapse of the USSR. Seven of ten matches with the largest audience in Russian Premier League (including top three) were Spartak-CSKA derbies. Historically, the most celebrated rivalry is with Dynamo Moscow, a fiercely contested matchup which is Russia&#x27;s oldest derby. Matches against Lokomotiv Moscow and Zenit Saint Petersburg attract thousands of people as well, almost always resulting in packed stadia. Upon the collapse of the Soviet Union, Spartak&#x27;s rivalry with Dynamo Kyiv, one of the leaders of the USSR championship, was lost. Since Dynamo Kyiv now plays in the Ukrainian Premier League, both teams must qualify for UEFA tournaments to meet each other.

Since the mid-2000s the supporters of Spartak maintain brotherhood relations with Crvena Zvezda (Red Star Belgrade) and Olympiacos ultras – a friendship based on common Orthodox faith and same club colours.
Also fans of Spartak have generally friendly relationships with Torpedo Moscow supporters, and of supporters of Polish club Lech Poznań.

==Stadium==


Until 2014, Spartak had never had its own stadium, with the team historically playing in various Moscow stadia throughout its history, even once playing an exhibition match in Red Square. The team played home games at various Moscow stadiums – especially at the Locomotiv and Luzhniki stadiums. After the purchase of the club by Andrei Chervichenko in the early 2000s, several statements were made about the speedy construction of the stadium, but construction did not begin.

After a controlling stake in the club was bought by Leonid Fedun, real steps were taken to promote the stadium project, and in 2006, the Government of Moscow allocated land at Tushino Aeropol at a size of 28.3 hectares for the construction of the stadium. The project involved the main arena of 42,000 people with natural lawn, sports, and an entertainment hall for tennis, handball, basketball and volleyball for 12,000 spectators. The ceremony of laying the first stone took place on 2 June 2007.

In February 2013, it was announced that as a result of a sponsorship deal with Otkritie FC Bank (&quot;Discovery&quot;), the stadium will be called Otkritie Arena for 6 years. The opening match at the new stadium took place on 5 September 2014, when Spartak drew with the Serbian side Red Star Belgrade (1-1). The first competitive match took place on 14 September 2014, in which Spartak defeated Torpedo Moscow 3–1 in the 7th round of the championship.

<doc id="929200" wikidata="Q1977728" url="?curid=929200" title="Neper (crater)">
<text>Neper is an old lunar impact crater located near the eastern limb of the Moon. Due to its location the crater must be viewed during a suitable libration, and is very foreshortened. The crater lies on the south edge of Mare Marginis, to the east of the crater Jansky. To the northwest across the Mare Marginis is the crater Goddard.

The crater inner walls have worn s, with low rim edges at the northern and southern extremes. The crater floor is dark and flat, with a central peak and several crater impacts near the west rim. The most notable of these is a small crater near the north-northwestern edge.

It is named after the Scottish mathematician, physicist, astronomer and astrologer John Napier.

Neper is one of the largest craters of Nectarian age.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Neper.

The following craters have been renamed by the IAU.

* Neper G - &quot;See&quot; Virchow (crater).
* Neper K - &quot;See&quot; Tacchini (crater).

<doc id="929202" wikidata="Q5095066" url="?curid=929202" title="Chi Heorot">
<text>Chi Heorot (often referred to simply as &quot;Heorot&quot; or &quot;XH&quot;) is a local fraternity at Dartmouth College in Hanover, New Hampshire. It was a chapter of the national fraternity Chi Phi until 1985.

==History==

=== Predecessors ===
Chi Heorot origins date to 1897 with the establishment of a local fraternity called Alpha Alpha Omega. In 1902 it was granted a charter as the &quot;Chi chapter&quot; of Chi Phi. Soon after, the fraternity moved to its present location on East Wheelock Street, and in 1927 sold off its eighteenth-century house and built the house that stands today.

By the mid-1900s, the Dartmouth chapter of Chi Phi was having some issues with its national charter. Some of these disagreements are alleged to have regarded the admission of an African-American student into the Dartmouth chapter, in violation of Chi Phi rules of the time. 

=== Chi Phi Heorot ===
In 1968, the &quot;Chi chapter&quot; of Chi Phi disassociated from the national fraternity and became the local fraternity Chi Phi Heorot. After several suspensions by the college in the early eighties, it re-joined the national fraternity in 1982. However, in the winter of 1985, the brothers of Heorot attempted to turn the central hall on the first floor of the house into an ice hockey rink by flooding it and opening the doors to allow Hanover&#x27;s subzero winter temperatures to freeze the water. This caused the floor to fall through into the basement. The national fraternity refused to help pay for the needed repairs. 

=== Chi Heorot ===
Because of this lack of support from its national offices, Heorot again opted to become a local fraternity, Chi Heorot in 1985. The college assumed ownership of the property and house. In 2016, the fraternity built an ice hockey rink in its backyard.

Chi Heorot is a member of the Dartmouth Interfraternity Council. It currently has 83 active members.

==Name==
After its final disassociation from the national in 1985, the fraternity chose the name Chi Heorot, derived from the medieval poem &quot;Beowulf&quot;. Heorot is the great hall where warriors converge to tell their stories, described by the anonymous author in the following excerpt:

:&quot;Then, as I have heard, the work of constructing a building&quot;
:&quot;Was proclaimed to many a tribe throughout this middle earth.&quot;
:&quot;In time – quickly, as such things happen among men – &quot;
:&quot;It was all ready, the biggest of halls.&quot;
:&quot;He whose word was law &quot;
:&quot;Far and wide gave it the name ‘Heorot’.&quot;

:&quot;The men did not dally; they strode inland in a group &quot;
:&quot;Until they were able to discern the timbered hall, &quot;
:&quot;Splendid and ornamented with gold. &quot;
:&quot;The building in which that powerful man held court &quot;
:&quot;Was the foremost of halls under heaven; &quot;
:&quot;Its radiance shone over many lands.&quot;.

==Notable members==
Heorot draws a good deal of its brotherhood from a variety of varsity athletic teams. Notable alumni include Gerry Geran &#x27;18, Adam Nelson &#x27;97, and Andrew Weibrecht &#x27;09, who have won Olympic medals in ice hockey, shot put, and ski racing respectively. Another Olympic alpine skier who was a member is Nolan Kasper. NHL hockey players Lee Stempniak, David Jones, Hugh Jessiman, Tanner Glass, Ben Lovejoy, J.T. Wyman and Matt Lindblad are also members.

<doc id="929203" wikidata="Q6435125" url="?curid=929203" title="Koyagi, Nagasaki">
<text>was a town located in Nishisonogi District, Nagasaki Prefecture, Japan, situated approximately 13 km south of the centre of Nagasaki City. The town was notable for the Mitsubishi shipyard which occupies 60% of urban areas.

As of 2003, the town had an estimated population of 4,261 and a density of 944.79 persons per km2. The total area was 4.51 km2.

On January 4, 2005, Kōyagi, along with the towns of Iōjima, Nomozaki, Sanwa, Sotome and Takashima (all from Nishisonogi District), was merged into the expanded city of Nagasaki and no longer exists as an independent municipality.

The main centre of population was located in the north western side from the Eri area to the Nagahama (shipyard) area. The centre of this is the Sato and Fukaura area where the elementary and junior high schools are located. Other buildings in these areas includes a small hospital, a kindergarten, the town hall and a library. A park and viewpoint is located in the centre of Koyagi from which fine views of Nagasaki city and the peninsular can be seen. Two small beaches are located in the Onoue and Tatsunokuchi areas. The southern Tatsunokuchi beach is famous locally for its scuba diving.

A strong tradition of Peron dragon boat racing exists in Kōyagi and in recent years the town team has won the Nagasaki Peron Festival several times.

==History==
In 1936 Toyosaku Kawanami bought the Matsuo Shipyard in Kōyagi and transformed it into one of the largest in the Far East. During World War II, a POW camp, Fukuoka #2 was located in Kōyagi and the prisoners were forced to work in brutal conditions in the factories. However, soon after the war was over Kawanami was forced to close the factories due to a shortage of money.
In 1967, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries acquired the old shipyard facility and started a process of development to create the largest dock in Japan. Completed in 1972, the construction created vast areas of land which attached the island to the mainland.

On March 27, 2011 the Iōjima Bridge was opened to link Kōyagi with the nearby island of Iōjima. This two-step process involves construction of a tunnel from the Eri area to the southern side of the town to link with a new bridge connecting the towns.

<text>Shane Hamman (born June 20, 1972) is an American Olympic weightlifter and powerlifter.

==Early years==
Shane Hamman was born in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, and brought up in Mustang, Oklahoma. Hamman began to play soccer at the age of 6 until he was 12 years old. In his freshman year of high school, Hamman began football and was a standout for two years on the freshman and varsity squads. He also wrestled his junior year.

Hamman grew strong lifting large pallets of produce for his father&#x27;s fruit market. During high school, he had broken several teenage records. He trained as a powerlifter after high school, but after seeing the 1996 Summer Olympics, he decided to switch his career to Olympic-style weightlifting.

==Olympic weightlifting/Powerlifting==
Shane began his career as a powerlifter, competing for the International Powerlifting Federation. He competed in the IPF World Championships in 1994 &amp; 1995, finished third and second respectively.

His greatest equipped squat was 457.5 kg at the USPF National Championships on March 9, 1996, which stood as the world record until Andrey Konovalov squatted 460 kg on November 4, 2012.

Hamman is sometimes called the strongest man in America. He won all 9 American Senior National Championship that he competed in (1997-2005). He holds every American weightlifting record in his class.

He competed in the 2000 Summer Olympics and finished 10th. In the qualifying for the Olympics, during the 2003 World Championships, on his final lift he single-handedly secured three spots for athletes from the U.S. in the 2004 Summer Olympics. In the Olympics, he finished 7th in his weight category, setting a new American record with his total of 430 kg and his clean and jerk of 237.5 kg.

Aside from his weightlifting prowess, Hamman also plays basketball and golf. Despite his frame, he can hit a golf ball , do a standing back flip, and leap vertically three feet (0.9 m).

Hamman has retired from Olympic weightlifting, and sometimes appears as an announcer in events like the Olympics in 2008 and 2016 for NBC.

Hamman is now focusing on helping others. He gives speeches at various high schools about his career and what it took to get Olympian status. Hamman also visits high schools to promote &quot;Rachel&#x27;s Challenge&quot;, a program for which he is a spokesperson.

<doc id="929211" wikidata="Q2891955" url="?curid=929211" title="Deconstruction Records">
<text>Deconstruction Records is a British record label founded in 1987 by Pete Hadfield and Keith Blackhurst, together with Mike Pickering of M People. According to &quot;DJ Magazine&quot; it is &quot;best remembered for marrying underground credibility and diversity with an open-minded attitude towards pop&quot;.

==Artists==

It initially specialised in house anthems such as K Klass&#x27;s &quot;Rhythm Is a Mystery&quot; and Bassheads&#x27; &quot;Is There Anybody Out There?&quot;, as well as M People&#x27;s output, but also had a record in promoting underground dance acts such as Dave Clarke. Hits included Robert Miles&#x27; UK No. 2 hit &quot;Children&quot;, Felix&#x27;s twice UK top ten hit &quot;Don&#x27;t You Want Me&quot; and Italian techno act U.S.U.R.A.&#x27;s UK No. 7 hit, &quot;Open Your Mind&quot;.

It was home to Kylie Minogue in the mid-late 1990s, when working with Saint Etienne, Brothers in Rhythm (who produced her single &quot;Confide in Me&quot;), and others.

Among the other artists to record for the company were Guru Josh, Black Box, M People, Way Out West, Sasha, Jam Machine and Republica. It also released recordings by Lionrock, Death in Vegas and Dub Pistols through its Concrete Records subsidiary.

==Commercial history==
Distribution was via label deals with Parlophone, for acts such as K-Klass and Bassheads, and RCA Records for everybody else (although M People had a separate deal with Epic in the United States, but had its primary label attached to their releases Stateside). It was acquired by BMG in 1993, and its operations reduced in 1998, with M People gaining its own M People Records label for the release of its &quot;Fresco&quot; album. Sony Music then acquired BMG&#x27;s stake in Sony BMG Music Entertainment in 2008, which led to the closure of both Deconstruction and Concrete.

==Orthography==
Deconstruction Records was written a number of ways, including
* De Construction Records (pre BMG releases)
* deConstruction Records
* Deconstruction Records

==2009 re-launch==
Sony and Three Six Zero Group relaunched the label in July 2009, again under Mike Pickering; its first release was Sasha&#x27;s &quot;Xpander&quot; in August 2009. They relaunched some of its back catalogue, and announced some new signings in late 2009, including Axwell, Diagram of the Heart, Retro/Grade and Way Out West. In May 2010, it was announced that Calvin Harris was signed the head of the A&amp;R team at the newly relaunched Deconstruction label.

<text>First Avenue Records (also known as 1st Avenue and First Avenue Management) was a British record label, publishing company and music management company. The publishing side of the company was acquired by BMG Music Publishing in 2002. After Universal Music Publishing&#x27;s acquisition of BMG Music Publishing in 2004, First Avenue Music then belonged to Universal Music Publishing.

The brain behind First Avenue Records was Oliver Smallman. They handled artist management, signed and developed acts, pretty much acting as A&amp;R for record labels. Licensed acts included Quartz, record producers/DJs/remixers Dave Rawlings and Ronnie Herel - PolyGram, Dina Carroll - A&amp;M, Michelle Gayle - RCA, Eternal, Louise and Dana Dawson - EMI, MN8 - Columbia, the Honeyz - Mercury, and Kele Le Roc - Polydor/Wildcard Records, Kes Ingoldsby.

The label launched in 1991 with a dance cover of Carole King&#x27;s &quot;It&#x27;s Too Late&quot; by Quartz featuring Dina Carroll which was a hit, reaching No. 8 in the UK Singles Chart and introducing Carroll who later released &quot;So Close&quot;. These were followed by another million seller, Eternal&#x27;s &quot;Always &amp; Forever&quot;. Success continued until the late 1990s with most of their acts being dropped from their labels.

<text>Heavenly Recordings is a London-based independent record label founded by Jeff Barrett in 1990. Heavenly released the first albums from Saint Etienne, Beth Orton and Doves, and early singles by Manic Street Preachers. Current Heavenly artists include Mattiel, The Orielles, Confidence Man, audiobooks, Pip Blom, H. Hawkline, King Gizzard &amp; the Lizard Wizard, Gwenno Saunders, Amber Arcades, Tapir!, Working Men&#x27;s Club, Katy J Pearson, CHAI and Kneecap.

Heavenly won Independent Label of the Year at the 2015 Music Week Awards. Other achievements include a Mercury Prize nomination for Saint Etienne&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Foxbase Alpha&quot;, and three number 1 albums with Doves. It is considered a key British indie record label, alongside Factory, Creation, Rough Trade, Mute, Ninja Tune and Domino.

==History==

===1980s: pre-Heavenly===

In the early 1980s, Jeff Barrett was a record shop manager and live music promoter living in Plymouth. He put on early gigs by The Jesus and Mary Chain, Primal Scream, The Loft and The Pastels, all bands signed to Creation Records, and Creation founder Alan McGee soon offered Barrett a job at the label. Jeff became Creation’s first full-time employee, in the summer of 1985, and worked there until 1988, when he left to set up Capersville press agency. Capersville represented several Creation bands, as well as representing Factory Records and all their artists (including Happy Mondays and New Order), The KLF and Inspiral Carpets. At the same time, Barrett was putting on gigs and club nights in London and set up two short-lived record labels – Head and Sub-Aqua – who released records by Loop, East Village and Laugh. Then in 1990, in partnership with his former record shop boss Mike Chadwick, Barrett set up Heavenly.

===1990s and 2000s===

The first Heavenly release was a 12-inch single by London house act Sly &amp; Lovechild, produced by Andrew Weatherall. This was followed by the debut singles from Saint Etienne (&quot;Only Love Can Break Your Heart&quot;) and Flowered Up (&quot;It’s On&quot;); both became key tracks in the UK house scene.

Next, Heavenly signed Manic Street Preachers and released two singles, &quot;Motown Junk&quot; in January 1991 and &quot;You Love Us&quot; in May 1991. The Manics then signed to Columbia Records for their first album.

Meanwhile, Flowered Up had made one album with London Records but returned to Heavenly in 1992 for their classic 13-minute single, &quot;Weekender.&quot; Saint Etienne’s debut album, &quot;Foxbase Alpha&quot;, was shortlisted for the 1992 Mercury Prize.

Over the next few years, Heavenly signed and released records by The Rockingbirds, Flowered Up, Beth Orton, The Hybirds, Monkey Mafia, Dot Allison, Q-Tee and Espiritu. Colleague and friend Martin Kelly became a partner in the label, as well as manager of Saint Etienne. Beth Orton&#x27;s first album, &quot;Trailer Park&quot;, was nominated for two Brit Awards and for the 1997 Mercury Prize. Orton won a Brit for her second album, &quot;Central Reservation&quot;, in 2000.

In 2000 Heavenly signed Doves, as well as 22-20s, Cherry Ghost, Edwyn Collins and Ed Harcourt. Doves had four platinum albums in a row: &quot;Lost Souls&quot; (2000), &quot;The Last Broadcast&quot; (2002), &quot;Some Cities&quot; (2005), and &quot;Kingdom of Rust&quot; (2009). &quot;The Last Broadcast&quot; and &quot;Some Cities&quot; gave Heavenly its first UK Number 1 albums.

In 2004 the label signed The Magic Numbers, whose self-titled debut became Heavenly’s bestselling album ever. The album was Mercury-nominated in 2005, and band were nominated for Best British Newcomer at the 2006 Brit Awards.

===2010s===

Heavenly signed Stealing Sheep and Toy in 2011; both bands released their debuts the following year. This marked the start of another halcyon period for Heavenly.

In 2012 the label released the debut single from Temples, &quot;Shelter Song.&quot; In 2013, they signed Mark Lanegan and Duke Garwood for their collaborative album &quot;Black Pudding&quot;; both artists are now signed to Heavenly individually. Temples’ debut album &quot;Sun Structures&quot;, released in 2014, was Heavenly’s 100th album release, a UK Top 10 hit and &quot;Rough Trade&quot;’s Number 1 Album of the Year.

In 2014 and 2015, in the run-up to their 25th anniversary, the label signed and released albums by The Wytches, Gwenno, Eaves, Drinks, H. Hawkline, Hooton Tennis Club, Kid Wave, King Gizzard &amp; the Lizard Wizard and Fever The Ghost.

In April 2015, Jeff Barrett and Heavenly right-hand man Danny Mitchell accepted the Music Week Awards prize for Best Independent Record Company.

In 2017, King Gizzard &amp; the Lizard Wizard released five critically acclaimed full-length albums, all on Heavenly. &quot;Pitchfork&quot; described the releases as “musically and ideologically dense albums […] showing a new dedication to pop craftsmanship.” &quot;The Quietus&quot; said that each album “offered up something radical and conceptually full-blown. Much better still, they all delivered on quality.”

In 2016, the label released &quot;Fading Lines&quot; by Dutch singer Amber Arcades. Since then, Heavenly releases include: Baxter Dury’s &quot;Prince of Tears&quot;, described by &quot;The Quietus&quot; as “beautiful, heart-rending, sexy, repulsive”; Gwenno’s second album, &quot;Le Kov&quot;, sung entirely in Cornish and made Album of the Year lists in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, &quot;Mojo&quot; and &quot;Rough Trade&quot;; the debut album from David Wrench’s new band audiobooks; Stealing Sheep’s &quot;bold, voltaic&quot; third album, &quot;Big Wows&quot;; and Pip Blom’s debut, &quot;Boat&quot;.

In 2019 Heavenly signed Working Men’s Club, Katy J Pearson and Raf Rundell.

In May 2023, Heavenly signed indie folk band Tapir!.

==Affiliations==

===The Social===

In 1999 The Social opened in central London near Oxford Circus, named for the Sunday Social nights which Heavenly ran with The Chemical Brothers during the 90s. The Social is still an independent live venue currently preparing to celebrate its 30th year after fighting off threat of a buyout in 2019. Audiobooks, Black Midi, Goat Girl, Edwyn Collins, The Chemical Brothers and Beck have played at The Social in the past couple of years, and it hosts regular literary readings, often in cahoots with Faber – recent authors include Eimear McBride, Viv Albertine, Deborah Levy, DBC Pierre and Robert Macfarlane. The Social also runs the Stonebridge Bar at Glastonbury Festival.

===Caught by the River===

In 2007, Barrett set up Caught By The River with Robin Turner and Andrew Walsh. CBTR commissions writers with a focus on the natural world and our relationships with it, and is currently run by Diva Harris. It has supported several new authors in the early stages of their careers, including Amy Liptrot and Luke Turner of The Quietus, who both wrote regular columns for Caught By The River that later became critically acclaimed books. CBTR also releases music on the Rivertones label and hosts stages at UK festivals including Port Eliot and Cerys Matthews&#x27; The Good Life Experience.

===Heavenly Films===

In 2009 Martin Kelly left Heavenly Recordings and set up Heavenly Films with his brother, Paul Kelly. Their films include &quot;Lawrence of Belgravia&quot; (2011), about Lawrence from indie band Felt, and &quot;Dexys: Nowhere Is Home&quot; (2014).

<text>Yangyang International Airport is a minor international airport in northeastern South Korea. It is located in Yangyang County, Gangwon Province and was built to serve the nearby areas of Gangneung, Sokcho, and Pyeongchang. The airport replaced Gangneung and Sokcho airports.

==History==
Air Koryo operated charters from Sondok Airport to Yangyang Airport during 2002–2006 for few months per year. Flights were halted indefinitely after relations soured between the two Koreas. Yangyang International Airport handled its last flight on 1 November 2008, according to the Korea Airport Corporation, and there were calls for it to be sold off or closed. It reopened on 16 July 2010 when East Asia AirLine started flying to Busan.

On 4 August 2011, Taiwan&#x27;s TransAsia Airways began flying to Yangyang International Airport (five times a week). TransAsia Airways stated that it will be a regular chartered service. However, on 18 February 2017, TransAsia Airways went into liquidation. In 2011, 5,748 passengers used the airport.

With Pyeongchang being voted as the host city for the 2018 Winter Olympics, an increase in passengers was expected at Yangyang International Airport. Korean Air scheduled additional charter flights from Yangyang to Europe and North America, including New York–JFK, Minneapolis–St. Paul, London–Gatwick, and Munich. This included a visa-free grace for the Philippines, Indonesia, and Vietnam so long as citizens land in Yangyang. VietJet Air is the only airline carrier that operates flights from South East Asia to Yangyang (charter flights from Hanoi to Yangyang).

As of 2025, the airport does not have a control radar.

== Geography ==
Nagayo is located on the southern shore of Ōmura Bay in central Nagasaki Prefecture, and includes the uninhabited islands of Shimizu and Futatsujima. The Nagayo River flows through the center of the town, and there are many residential areas and fields in the river basin. The surrounding areas are hilly, and especially on the eastern side, there are a series of hills centered on Kotonoodake, which is 451.4 meters above sea level. The hills in the southern and western parts of the town are not as high as those in the eastern parts, and are densely populated residential areas that continue into the northern part of Nagasaki City. In the southern part of the town, the Oide River, a tributary of the Urakami River, flows along the border with Nagasaki. This was once an agriculturally thriving region, with mandarin orange fields on the hills and rice paddies along the river, but as Nagasaki&#x27;s urban area expanded with new town developments in the hilly areas in the southern and western parts of the town.

On the northeastern edge of Seihi is Saikai Bridge, part of Routes 202 and 206, which takes motorists to Hario in the city of Sasebo. The Pearl Line Expressway, a toll road with bridge, was completed in 2006. This route ends near the Huis Ten Bosch theme park.

==Economy==
The backbone of Seihi is agriculture, with major crops including lotus root, grapes, and watermelon. Route 206, winding through Seihi, features numerous farmers&#x27; markets which attract shoppers from the nearby cities of Sasebo and Nagasaki. The waters of the Ōmura Bay are also filled with oyster farms, both the pearl-yielding and culinary varieties. There is also a thriving local fishing industry, and the waters around Seihi are the source of sea cucumbers, among other fish and shellfish, which find their way into fish markets in Nagasaki.

==Miscellaneous==
Seihi is well known in the region for a type of firm glutinous rice mixed with mugwort known as &quot;yomogi kankoro&quot; (蓬かんころ).

<text>is a city located in Nagasaki Prefecture, Japan.

== Population ==
, the city had an estimated population of 25,184 in 12447 households, and a population density of 100 people per km2. The total area of the city is .

==History==
Sakai is within ancient Hizen Province.

The city of Saikai was established on April 1, 2005, from the merger of five towns on the northern tip of Nishisonogi Peninsula: the former town of Saikai, Ōseto, Ōshima, Sakito and Seihi (all from Nishisonogi District). Its city hall is the former town hall of Ōseto.

== Geography ==
Saikai is located on the northern tip of the Nishisonogi Peninsula, surrounded on three sides by the Goto Sea, Sasebo Bay, and Ōmura Bay, and islands scattered around the area. Most of the area has a ria coastline, with a complex, indented coastline. The highest peak on the peninsula is Mount Nagaura, 561 meters above sea level (the summit is in Nagasaki City). The area down to the coast is hilly and includes evergreen broad-leaved forests, cedar and cypress forests, orchards, and farmland, with a narrow plain.

Its record high is , reached on 21 August 2018, and its record low is , reached on 26 February 1981.

==Demographics==
Per Japanese census data, the population of Saikai in 2020 is 26,275 people. Saikai has been conducting censuses since 1920. The city&#x27;s population peaked in the 1950s with more than 80,000 people. However, since 1960, Saikai&#x27;s population has fallen sharply, and in the 1970s it was half what it was 10 years before; by 2020, the population will be only a third of what it was in the 1950s.

==Government==
Saikai has a mayor-council form of government with a directly elected mayor and a unicameral city council of 18 members. Saikai contributes one member to the Nagasaki Prefectural Assembly.

The city was previously part of Nagasaki 4th district, which was abolished in 2022.

==Economy==
The economy of the towns in this area were dominated by fishing and whaling in the Edo period, and coal mining in the Meiji period. The area is now primarily agricultural, with forestry products and tourism also of importance. However, on Oshima island, north of Saikai and close to Sasebo, a large shipyard is active building bulk ships and metal structures, i.e. Oshima Shipbuilding, in which the Sumitomo Heavy Industries has shares.

==Education==
Saikai has 11 public elementary schools and six public junior high schools by the city government, and three public high schools operated by the Nagasaki Prefectural Board of Education. The prefecture also operates one special education school for the handicapped.

<text>is a district located in Nagasaki Prefecture, Japan. The towns of Hasami, Higashisonogi, and Kawatana are located within the district.

As of July 1, 2023, the district has an estimated population of 34,224 and a density of 204 persons per km2. The total area is 167.53 km2.

==Towns and villages==
*Hasami
*Higashisonogi
*Kawatana

== History ==

Higashisonogi District was established on October 28, 1874 as an administrative division within Sonogi District due to Nagasaki Prefecture enforcing a township law that was passed by the Japanese government. The district comprises today&#x27;s towns of Hasami, Higashisonogi, Kawatana, parts of Sasebo and the entire city of Omura. The county office was established in Omura (formally known as Omura Town).

In 1902, Sasebo Village was given city status and Sasebo withdrew from the county. In 1942, many towns around Omura merged to become today&#x27;s Omura City. The city therefore withdrew from the county.

<text>Brackett is a small lunar impact crater that lies near the southeast edge of Mare Serenitatis. The crater is named after American physicist Frederick Sumner Brackett. The crater has been covered by lava flow, leaving only a ring-shaped trace in the surrounding lunar mare. This crater is best observed under oblique illumination, as it is otherwise difficult to find. The southern rim is almost contacting a rille system named the Rimae Plinius.

<text>was a town located in Minamitakaki District, Nagasaki Prefecture, Japan.

As of 2003, the town had an estimated population of 4,203 and a density of 160.85 persons per km2. The total area was 26.13 km2.

On March 31, 2006, Kitaarima, along with the towns of Arie, Fukae, Futsu, Kazusa, Kuchinotsu, Minami-Arima and Nishi-Arie (all from Minamitakaki District), was merged to create the city of Minamishimabara.

==History==
Both Kita-Arima and Minami-Arima were part of what was known as Arima County in the south-eastern portion of the Shimabara Peninsula until they were split into two separate towns in 1889 during the Meiji Era. Kitaarima was the location of Hinoe Castle which was the estate of the Arima clan. Though initially against the Christians, Arima Harunobu eventually became a Christian himself and allowed Portuguese missionaries to build a seminary in 1580. The &quot;Arima Semenario&quot;, as it was called, was a center for Renaissance learning. Japanese students of the Seminario received Western language, religious, and cultural training. The most famous graduates were Mancio Ito, Miguel Chijiwa, Martino Hara, and Julian Nakaura. These four young men were the first Japanese envoys to visit Europe. Arima Harunobu&#x27;s son and his family were transferred to Hyuga Province in 1615 following Harunobu&#x27;s execution in 1612. Hinoe castle was burned down by Tokugawa forces during the Shimabara Rebellion in 1637. The site of the destroyed castle still remains today and is a popular site for &quot;hanami&quot;, or flower viewing, in March and April.

==Kitaarima Today==
Kitaarima is a farming community that grows rice, potatoes, mikan, strawberries, and other crops. It has several distribution facilities to move produce to more populated areas. Kita-Arima-chō is situated in seven valleys that run up the southern reaches of Mount Unzen. Most of Kita-Arima-chō&#x27;s population is centered in the southern part of the county in the town of Kita-Arima near the Ariake Sea and Minami-Arima town. Kita-Arima town is further split into smaller hamlets; Tanigawa, Sakaueshita, Tabira, Saishoji, Oriki.

The central area of Kita-Arima town contains the town office, the board of education building, bank, and the post office. Nearby is Kitaarima Junior High School which has less than 100 students and Kitaarima Elementary School has about 200 students. The town elementary school was built in 2004 to condense the four old elementary schools into one new facility. Also nearby are the town&#x27;s main stores Parusu and Mizota. Parusu is a one-story department store that has a supermarket, a flower shop, a clothes and shoes store, a photo shop, and a pharmacy. Mizota is a large home furnishings and 100 yen store. Kitaarima was a stop on the now defunct Shimatetsu train line which connected all of the towns from Kazusa to Isahaya.

The town has several important festivals every year. The most important is Festivitus Natalis, the town&#x27;s Christmas festival held at the elementary school sports field. This festival celebrates the Christian history of the town. The festival has musical performances by junior highschool students and guest bands. Many booths offer different foods. Other festivals include Hinoe Festival, which is held at the elementary school as well. The &quot;yosakoi&quot; Festival is held every year at Fureai Sports Park. Kita-Arima town&#x27;s own &quot;yosakoi&quot; team performs along with other Yosakoi teams from around Nagasaki Prefecture.

Other sights of interest include Sunset Hill at the highest point in Kita-Arima-chō that overlooks Obama-chō to the northeast. Across from Sunset Hill is Kita-Arima&#x27;s brand-new camping facilities built in 2005 and opened on July 20, 2005. Kita-Arima has several old bridges constructed during the Meiji Era. The bridges include; Motobira, Arata, Tanaka, Higuchi, Omonashi, and Aratashimo.

<doc id="929265" wikidata="Q4655802" url="?curid=929265" title="A Chance to Cut Is a Chance to Cure">
<text>A Chance to Cut Is a Chance to Cure is the fourth studio album by American electronic music duo Matmos, released in 2001. The album consists primarily of samples of medical procedures, including plastic surgeries, liposuctions, hearing tests and bonesaws. The album maintains a sense of humour in contrast with the serious nature of the audio being sampled. The exception to the medical samples is the song &quot;For Felix (And All the Rats)&quot;, a piece dedicated to their deceased pet rat Felix, performed entirely on his cage.

The two members of Matmos, Drew Daniel and Martin Schmidt, both had doctors as parents, a fact that likely influenced them in the album&#x27;s creation. The album is sometimes considered a concept album within the glitch or musique concrète genre.

== Critical reception ==

At Metacritic, which assigns a weighted average score out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, &quot;A Chance to Cut Is a Chance to Cure&quot; received an average score of 80 based on 13 reviews, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;. Heather Phares of AllMusic described the album as &quot;seven remarkably accessible, melodic pieces of experimental techno.&quot; Simon Reynolds of &quot;Spin&quot; said, &quot;Matmos have captured with discomforting vividness the sheer surrealism of the modern vanity industry, the medieval tortures people gladly endure in pursuit of physical perfection.&quot;

In 2017, &quot;Pitchfork&quot; placed &quot;A Chance to Cut Is a Chance to Cure&quot; at number 19 on its list of &quot;The 50 Best IDM Albums of All Time&quot;.

<doc id="929266" wikidata="Q866708" url="?curid=929266" title="Posidonius (crater)">
<text>Posidonius is a lunar impact crater that is located on the north-eastern edge of Mare Serenitatis, to the south of Lacus Somniorum. It was named after ancient Greek philosopher and geographer Posidonius of Apamea. The crater Chacornac is attached to the southeast rim, and to the north is Daniell.

==Description==
The rim of Posidonius is shallow and obscured, especially on the western edge, and the interior has been overlain by a lava flow in the past. The crater ramparts can still be observed to the south and east of the crater rim, and to a lesser degree to the north.

There is a smaller, semi-circular rim of a concentric, flooded crater within the main rim, offset towards the eastern edge. There is no central peak, but the floor is hilly and laced with a rille system named the Rimae Posidonius. The floor is also slightly bulged due to the past lava uplift, which also likely produced the complex of rilles. The northeast rim is interrupted by the smaller crater Posidonius B. Within the crater rim, offset just to the west of center is another smaller crater Posidonius A.

Posidonius is a crater of Upper (Late) Imbrian age.

On the Mare Serenitatis surface near Posidonius is a notable system of wrinkle ridges that parallel the nearby shore. These are designated the Dorsa Smirnov. At the peak of these ridges is a small crater, Posidonius Y, with a diameter of 2 km. This crater is surrounded by a patch of high-albedo material, its ray system. This peak was formerly designated Posidonius Gamma (γ).

Posidonius Gamma was first observed by the lunar cartographer Julius Schmidt in 1867, who noted the similarity to the bright patch surrounding the crater Linné.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Posidonius.

<doc id="929274" wikidata="Q1464896" url="?curid=929274" title="Naked Raygun">
<text>Naked Raygun is an American punk rock band that formed in Chicago in 1980. The band was active from 1980 to 1992, along with reunion shows in 1997, and since 2006.

Naked Raygun have cited various bands as influences, including Buzzcocks, Wire, the Stranglers, the Damned, the Ruts, Killing Joke, Siouxsie and the Banshees, the Jam, and the Clash.

==History==
===Initial run===
The band was formed in 1980 by Santiago Durango, Marko Pezzati and later Jeff Pezzati. Singer Jeff Pezzati was the sole constant member through multiple personnel changes. Members over time include drummers Bobby Strange, Jim Colao, and Eric Spicer; bassists Marko Pezzati, Pierre Kezdy, Camilo Gonzalez, Pete Mittler and Fritz Doreza; guitarists Santiago Durango, John Haggerty, and Bill Stephens; and keyboardist John Lundin.

Durango and Jeff Pezzati were also members of Big Black.

=== Post-Naked Raygun ===
In 1989, John Haggerty left Naked Raygun to form Pegboy with his younger brother Joe (formerly of Bloodsport and The Effigies) and Steve Saylors and Larry Damore of the Bhopal Stiffs (Pierre Kezdy would later replace Steve Saylors).

Jeff Pezzati is also the lead singer of The Bomb, which is a different and later band than the San Francisco group, known as &quot;Bomb&quot;.

===Reunions===
A two-show reunion in 1997 produced the live album &quot;Free Shit!&quot;.

In 1999, the independent record label Quarterstick Records re-issued the band&#x27;s back catalog on CD.

In 2006 Naked Raygun reunited for Riot Fest, an annual punk rock festival held in Chicago. Following their 2006 reunion, Naked Raygun announced that the band was &quot;back for good.&quot; The reunited lineup consists of its &quot;Raygun...Naked Raygun&quot; members: Pezzati, Stephens, Kezdy, and Spicer. In 2009 Naked Raygun returned to the studio for the first time since 1997 for a series of 7-inch singles released on Riot Fest Records and announced plans to record an LP, the first since 1990&#x27;s &quot;Raygun... Naked Raygun&quot;.

In 2011, Pete Mittler of The Methadones joined the line-up so that longtime bassist Pierre Kezdy could convalesce from a stroke.

In August 2014, Naked Raygun opened for Bad Religion, The Offspring and Stiff Little Fingers on the last two shows of the Summer Nationals tour at The Rave in Milwaukee and Harrah&#x27;s Stir Cove in Council Bluffs, Iowa.

Naked Raygun (along with Urge Overkill and Cheap Trick) opened for the Foo Fighters at Wrigley Field, Chicago, on August 29, 2015.

Although the band announced plans to release a new album in 2016, no recordings were released until 2021&#x27;s &quot;Over The Overlords&quot;.

Pierre Kezdy died of cancer on October 9, 2020.

==Legacy==
Dave Grohl, of Nirvana and Foo Fighters, has frequently discussed seeing Naked Raygun as his first concert in 1982 (when he was 13) at Chicago&#x27;s Cubby Bear. During their October 17, 2014, show at the Cubby Bear, Jeff Pezatti joined the band for a Naked Raygun cover. Naked Raygun themselves later opened for Foo Fighters on select dates during the Sonic Highways World Tour.

Blink-182’s Matt Skiba references Naked Raygun in the song “Parking Lot” from their &quot;California&quot; album.

<text>La Bufadora is a blowhole and tourist attraction located on the Punta Banda Peninsula in Baja California, Mexico, about 17 miles south of Ensenada.

== Natural phenomenon ==

La Bufadora is often considered a marine geyser, however, it does not have a thermal source or cause, as geysers do. In this case, the spout of sea water is the result of air, trapped in a sea cave, exploding upwards. Air is forced into the cave by wave action and is released when the water recedes, ejecting water up to 100 ft. above sea level. This interaction not only creates the spout, but a thunderous noise as well.

The interval between eruptions is fairly constant, and matches the dominant swell, confirming that the activity at La Bufadora is determined by surface ocean waves. Between 2005 and 2011 the recurrence between eruptions was between 13 and 17 seconds.

La Bufadora is one of the largest blowholes in the world.

== Legend ==
The legend regarding La Bufadora is that a whale became trapped in the rocky point and blew water to attract its pod’s attention. Eventually, the whale turned to stone, staying there forever. 

== Tourist attraction ==
La Bufadora is one of Ensenada&#x27;s main tourist attractions, and there are several souvenir and food vendors overlooking the site. In 2017, 150 businesses were operating at La Bufadora.

<doc id="929281" wikidata="Q7723240" url="?curid=929281" title="The Civil War (album)">
<text>The Civil War is the fifth studio album by experimental duo Matmos, released via Matador Records. It explores the boundaries between Americana, Medieval folk music and electronica. It features many live instruments such as drums, brass and guitars. A hurdy-gurdy is also sampled. There is also a satirical take on &quot;Stars and Stripes Forever&quot;.

==Critical reception==
Review aggregator website Metacritic gives &quot;The Civil War&quot; a score of 77 out of 100 based on 22 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;.

Heather Phares of AllMusic gave the album 4.5 stars out of 5, calling it &quot;an album whose subtly oxymoronic title suggests the inherent contradictions of its sound.&quot; Mark Richardson of &quot;Pitchfork&quot; gave the album a 7.3 out of 10, saying, &quot;As a technical achievement and as a piece of pure sound, &quot;The Civil War&quot; is inarguably Matmos&#x27; best record.&quot;
