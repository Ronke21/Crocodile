<text>Abraham Hyacinthe Anquetil-Duperron (7 December 173117 January 1805) was the first professional French Indologist. He conceived the institutional framework for the new profession. He inspired the founding of the École française d&#x27;Extrême-Orient a century after his death. The library of the Institut français de Pondichéry is named after him.

==Early life ==
Abraham Hyacinthe Anquetil was born in Paris on 7 December 1731 as the fourth of seven children of Pierre Anquetil, a spice importer. As was the custom of the time, the name of one of his father&#x27;s estates, &quot;Duperron&quot;, was added to his name to distinguish him from his brothers. Anquetil-Duperron initially distinguished himself in the study of theology at Paris and Utrecht with the intention of becoming a priest like his elder brother Louis-Pierre Anquetil. In the course of his studies, however, he acquired such an interest in Latin, Hebrew, and Greek that he chose to devote himself entirely to philology and classical studies and discontinued his clerical training. He travelled to Amersfoort near Utrecht to study oriental languages, especially Arabic, with the Jansenists who were exiled there. On returning to Paris, his attendance at the Royal Library (&quot;&quot;, now the National Library) attracted the attention of the keeper of the manuscripts, Claude Sallier, who hired Anquetil-Duperron as an assistant on a small salary.

==Early interest in Indian manuscripts==
In 1754, Michelangelo-André Le Roux Deshauterayes, who at the time was professor for Arabic at the Collège Royal, showed Anquetil-Duperron a facsimile of four leaves of a &quot;Vendidad Sade&quot; that had been sent to Deshauterayes&#x27;s uncle Michel Fourmont in the 1730s in the hope that someone might be able to decipher it. The original was at Oxford&#x27;s Bodleian Library, but the script was not recognized, and so the manuscript was placed in a box chained to a wall near the library&#x27;s entrance and shown to everyone who might be able to identify the curiosity. Also at the Bodleian was the manuscript collection of James Fraser (1713–1754), who had lived in Surat (a city in present-day Gujarat, India) for over sixteen years, where he had been a Factor of the British East India Company and later Member of Council. Fraser had returned to Britain with some 200 Sanskrit and Avestan manuscripts, which he intended to translate, but he died prematurely on 21 January 1754.

In his later travelogue, Anquetil-Duperron is sharply critical of the English, both of Fraser&#x27;s &quot;failure&quot; to accomplish what he intended, and of the Bodleian&#x27;s failure to realize that Thomas Hyde&#x27;s manuscripts, which the Bodleian also had in its possession, included a transliteration table for Avestan script. Playing on the French antipathy towards the English, in his travelogue he later claimed that after seeing the facsimile pages of the Oxford manuscript, he resolved to &quot;enrich [his] country with that singular work&quot; and the translation of it.apud There was a government interest in obtaining eastern manuscripts; Anquetil-Duperron obtained a mission from the government to do so but, unable to afford his own passage to India, he enlisted as a common soldier for the French East India Company on 2 or 7 November 1754. He marched with the company of recruits from the Parisian prisons to the Atlantic port of L&#x27;Orient, where an expedition was preparing to depart. His friends secured his discharge and, on 7 February 1755, the minister, touched by his romantic zeal for knowledge, granted him free passage, a seat at the captain&#x27;s table, an allowance of 500 livres from the library, and a letter of introduction to the French governor in India which would entitle him to a small salary while there. Anquetil-Duperron left France as a free passenger on 24 February 1755.

==First travels==
After a passage of six months, Anquetil-Duperron landed on 10 August 1755 at the French colony at Pondicherry, on the coast in south-eastern India. From his private correspondence it appears that he intended to become &quot;master of the religious institutions of all Asia&quot;, which in the 18th century were still imagined to all derive from the Indian Vedas. For that, Anquetil-Duperron knew he would need to learn Sanskrit. He initially studied Persian (the lingua franca of Moghul India), which Europeans in the 18th century still presumed to have descended from Sanskrit. His plan was then to visit the Brahmins in Benares to learn Sanskrit &quot;at some famous pagoda&quot;.apud Half a year later, he was living on rice and vegetables and saving his money so that he might &quot;find some Brahmin&quot; to become the disciple of. As he also wanted to &quot;study the Indian books&quot;, he decided to travel to the French colony at Chandannagar, also known in French as Chandernagor, in Bengal, where he arrived in April 1756. He promptly fell sick; by coincidence, he landed in the hospital of the Jesuit missionary Antoine Mozac, who some years earlier had copied the &quot;Pondicherry Vedas&quot;. Anquetil-Duperron remained in the hospital until September or October 1756 and began to wonder whether he should not instead become a priest as he had intended years earlier. Meanwhile, the outbreak of the Seven Years&#x27; War in Europe had renewed hostilities between French and British forces in India, where the conflict is known as the Third Carnatic War. The British East India Company under Robert Clive and the British Navy under Charles Watson bombarded and captured Chandannagar on 23 March 1757 and Anquetil-Duperron resolved to leave the territory. Unable to gain access to the Vedas, Anquetil-Duperron planned to travel to Tibet and China to find the ancient Indian texts there. Discouraged by news that there were no texts to be found there, Anquetil-Duperron returned overland to Pondicherry over the course of a hundred-day trek. There, he found his brother Etienne Anquetil de Briancourt, who had been named consul at Surat.

As Etienne assured Abraham that the Zoroastrian priests of Surat would teach him their sacred texts as well as the languages in which they were written, he resolved to accompany his brother. Wanting to explore the country, however, he disembarked from his brother&#x27;s ship at Mahé and travelled overland the rest of the way on foot and on horseback. He arrived in Surat on 1 March 1758, at a time when the Indian Zoroastrians (Parsis) were embroiled in a bitter dispute over the intercalation of the Zoroastrian calendar, which is now called the &quot;Kabiseh controversy&quot;. Each side cultivated ties with competing European traders. The one faction (the &quot;shahenshahi&quot;s, led by a certain Muncherji Seth) had ties to the Dutch East India Company. The other (the &quot;kadmi&quot;s, led by a certain Darab Kumana) maintained ties to the British East India Company and to Armenian merchants. In the travelogue, Darab&#x27;s co-operation with Anquetil-Duperron is attributed to a need for assurance of French protection. It seems that Darab (and another priest, a certain Kaus) attempted to provide Anquetil-Duperron with an education similar to that given to priests. His essay &quot;&quot; aligns itself with the texts and provides only glimpses of what the Parsis actually believed at the time. Anquetil-Duperron complains of the priests&#x27; interest with law and ritual rather than philosophy or theology. Anquetil-Duperron grew impatient with the methodical methods of the priests and with his inability to obtain manuscripts. According to his travelogue, the priests also had no desire to teach him Avestan and no expectations that he would master it well enough to translate their texts. Also according to Anquetil-Duperron, the priests were committing a great sacrilege in acquainting him with the texts and lessons were conducted in Persian so that the priest&#x27;s Zoroastrian servant would not be aware of what was transpiring. Kaus&#x27;s anxiety increased when Anquetil-Duperron demanded proper interpretation and not just translation. Via Persian, the two priests taught him what they knew of Avestan (which was not much) and of Zoroastrian theology (which was even less). In June 1759, 16 months after his arrival in Surat, he sent news to Paris that he had completed (in three months) a translation of the &quot;Vendidad&quot;. The same June, the priest Darab arranged for Anquetil-Duperron to attend – in disguise but armed with a sword and pistol — a ceremony in a fire temple &quot;in exchange for a small present and the hope of promenading the city in my palanquin&quot;.&quot;apud&quot; Anquetil-Duperron also suggests that Darab attempted to convert him, but that he &quot;courageously refused to waver&quot;.&quot;apud&quot; Two centuries later, J. J. Modi would explain Anquetil-Duperron&#x27;s invitation into a temple as only possible if the sacred fire had been temporarily removed because the temple was being renovated.&quot;cf.&quot; On the other hand, Anquetil-Duperron states that he was given a &quot;sudra&quot; and &quot;kusti&quot; and he may have been formally invested with them, which would have made him a Zoroastrian in the priest&#x27;s view, and thus would have been acceptable in a functioning temple.

==Duel and legal problems==
In late 1759, Anquetil-Duperron killed a fellow countryman in a duel, was badly wounded himself, and was forced to take refuge with the British. Anquetil-Duperron&#x27;s own brother demanded that he be handed over, but the British refused. In April 1760, the French authorities dropped the charges and allowed him to return to the French sector. In the meantime, Anquetil-Duperron had travelled all over Gujarat. At Surat and in his travels, he collected 180 manuscripts, which not only included almost all known Avestan language texts and many of the 9th/10th-century works of Zoroastrian tradition, but also other texts in a multitude of Indian languages. Anquetil-Duperron finished his translation in September 1760, and decided to leave Surat. From Surat, he intended again to travel to Benares but the widow of the Frenchman he had killed was bringing charges against him, which Anquetil-Duperron then used as an excuse to seek refuge again with the British and obtain passage on one of the English ships destined for Europe. He paid for his journey by calling in debts that others had made to his brother. Just before his departure, the priest Kaus lodged a complaint with the British that Anquetil-Duperron had failed to pay for all the manuscripts that he had purchased. The British seized his goods, but released them when Anquetil-Duperron&#x27;s brother guaranteed payment. Anquetil-Duperron left Surat on 15 March 1761. He arrived at Portsmouth eight months later, where he was interned but allowed to continue working. After his release, he traveled to Oxford to check his copies of the Avestan language texts against those of the Bodleian. He then set out for France and arrived in Paris on 14 March 1762. He deposited his manuscripts in the Bibliothèque du Roi the next day.

==Report and fame==
In June 1762, Anquetil-Duperron&#x27;s report was published in the &quot;Journal des sçavans&quot;, and he became an instant celebrity. The title of his report indicated that he had gone to India to &quot;discover and translate the works attributed to Zoroaster.&quot; It appears that this mischaracterization of his objective was in order to be seen as having achieved what he intended. 

The librarian Jean-Jacques Barthélemy procured a pension for him and appointed him interpreter of oriental languages at the Bibliothèque du Roi. In 1763, he was elected an associate of the Académie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres and began to arrange for the publication of the materials he had collected during his travels. 

In 1771, Anquetil-Duperron published his three-part &quot;Zend Avesta&quot; which had been ascribed to Zoroaster and which included not only a re-translation of what the priests had translated into Persian for him but also a travelogue (&#x27;), a summary of the manuscripts that he collected (&#x27;), a biography of Zoroaster (&#x27;), a translation of the Bundahishn, and two essays (&#x27; and &quot;&quot;).

==Controversy==
A heated dispute broke out in Britain and in Europe, which questioned the authenticity of this claimed first translation into a European languages of the Avesta scriptures. It was suggested that Anquetil-Duperron&#x27;s so-called &quot;Zend Avesta&quot; was not the genuine work of the prophet Zoroaster, but was a recent forgery. At the fore in this dispute was William Jones, an Oxford graduate, at the time studying law at the Middle Temple in London. Jones, the future founder of the Asiatic Society who would become known for his hypothesis in 1786 regarding a relationship among European and Indo-Aryan languages, had been deeply wounded by Anquetil-Duperron&#x27;s scornful treatment of Jones&#x27;s countrymen and, in a pamphlet written in French in 1771, Jones dismissed Anquetil-Duperron&#x27;s manuscripts as a fraud. Other scholars in England criticised Anquetil-Duperron&#x27;s translation on philological grounds.

In France, Voltaire poked fun at Anquetil-Duperron and his translation in his article &quot;Zoroastre&quot; (1772) in the &quot;Questions sur l&#x27;Encyclopédie&quot;. Diderot was likewise similarly &quot;conspicuously disappointed&quot;. For these &quot;philosophes&quot; the ideas revealed by Anquetil-Duperron&#x27;s translation seemed impossible to relate to the idealized Enlightenment-era view of Zoroaster or to his religion which they associated with simplicity and wisdom. Many German scholars, with the notable except of Herder, also attacked Anquetil-Duperron&#x27;s translation.

In 1820, fifteen years after his death, Anquetil-Duperron was vindicated by the Danish philologist Rasmus Rask. The debate would rage for another thirty years after that. Anquetil-Duperron&#x27;s &quot;attempt at a translation was, of course, premature&quot;, and, as Eugène Burnouf demonstrated sixty years later, translating the Avesta via a previous translation was prone to errors. However, Anquetil-Duperron was the first to bring an ancient oriental sacred text other than the Bible to the attention of European scholars.

==Later years==
Following his &quot;Zend Avesta&quot; and until his death in 1805, Anquetil-Duperron was occupied with studying the laws, history, and geography of India. &quot;In his youth a kind of Don Juan; he now led the life of a poor, ascetic bachelor, combining Christian virtue with the wisdom of a Brahmin.&quot; During that period he abandoned society, and lived in voluntary poverty on a few pence a day.

In 1778, he published at Amsterdam his &#x27;, in which he endeavoured to prove that the nature of oriental despotism had been greatly misrepresented by Montesquieu and others. His &#x27; appeared in 1786 and formed part of Thieffenthaler&#x27;s &quot;Geography of India&quot;. In 1798, he published &quot;&quot; (Hamburg, 2 vols.), a work considered notable by the British for its &quot;remarkable&quot; invectives against them and for its &quot;numerous misrepresentations&quot;. 

Anquetil-Duperron&#x27;s most valuable achievement in his last years was the publication of the &quot;Oupnek&#x27;hat, id est, Secretum tegendum&quot;, a two-volume Latin retranslation and commentary of a Persian translation of fifty Upanishads. Duperron had received the Persian translation from India in 1775 and had translated that into both French and Latin, but the French translation was never published. The Latin translation was published in Strasbourg in 1801-1802 and represents the first European language translation of a sacred book of Hinduism, albeit in an approximate rendering. Anquetil-Duperron&#x27;s commentaries make up half the work. The Latin version was the initial introduction of the Upanishadic thought to Western scholars, although, according to Paul Deussen, the Persian translators had taken great liberties in their rendering of the original Sanskrit text and at times changed the meaning.

A 108-page French paraphrase of Duperron&#x27;s &quot;Oupneck&#x27;hat&quot; by Jean-Denis Lanjuinais appeared in Millin de Grandmaison&#x27;s &quot;Magasin Encyclopédique&quot; of 1805. Arthur Schopenhauer encountered Anquetil-Duperron&#x27;s &quot;&quot;s in the spring of 1814 and repeatedly called it not only his favorite book but the work of the entire world literature that is most worthy of being read.

==Political and institutional activity==
When the Institut de France was reorganised, Anquetil-Duperron was voted in as a member but soon resigned. In 1804, he refused to swear allegiance to Napoleon, stating that &quot;his obeisance [was] to the laws of the government under which he lived and which protected him.&quot;&quot;apud&quot;

==Death==
Abraham Hyacinthe Anquetil-Duperron died in Paris on 17 January 1805. His work became one of the most important references for nineteenth-century spiritualists and occultists in France.

<text>The Courier Journal, also known as the Louisville Courier Journal (and informally The C-J or The Courier), and called The Courier-Journal between November 8, 1868, and October 29, 2017, is a daily newspaper published in Louisville, Kentucky and owned by Gannett, which bills it as &quot;Part of the &quot;USA Today&quot; Network&quot;.

It is the newspaper with the highest number of recorded circulation in Kentucky. According to the &quot;1999 Editor &amp; Publisher International Yearbook&quot;, the paper is the 48th-largest daily paper in the United States.

==History==

===Origins===
&quot;The Courier-Journal&quot; was created from the merger of several newspapers introduced in Kentucky in the 19th century.

A pioneer paper called &quot;The Focus of Politics, Commerce and Literature&quot; was founded in 1826 in Louisville when the city was an early settlement of less than 7,000 individuals. In 1830 a new newspaper, &quot;The Louisville Daily Journal&quot;, began distribution in the city and, in 1832, the &quot;Journal&quot; absorbed &quot;The Focus of Politics, Commerce and Literature&quot;. The Louisville &quot;Journal&quot; was an organ of the Whig Party and was founded and edited by George D. Prentice, a New Englander who initially came to Kentucky to write a biography of Henry Clay. Prentice edited the &quot;Journal&quot; for more than 40 years.

In 1844, another newspaper, the &quot;Louisville Morning Courier&quot;, was founded in Louisville by Walter Newman Haldeman. &quot;The Louisville Daily Journal&quot; and the &quot;Louisville Morning Courier&quot; were leading newspapers in Louisville and were politically opposed throughout the Civil War; &quot;The Journal&quot; was against slavery while the &quot;Courier&quot; was pro-Confederacy. The &quot;Courier&quot; was suppressed by the Union and had to move to Nashville, but it returned to Louisville after the war.

Upon the announcement of the Emancipation Proclamation that ended slavery in the Confederate states, the &quot;Journal&quot; opposed the Proclamation as an unconstitutional use of presidential power, and predicted: &quot;Kentucky cannot and will not acquiesce in this measure. Never!&quot;
In 1868, an ailing Prentice persuaded the 28-year-old Henry Watterson to come edit for the &quot;Journal&quot;. During secret negotiations in 1868, &quot;The Journal&quot; and the &quot;Courier&quot; merged, and the first edition of &quot;The Courier-Journal&quot; was delivered to Louisvillians on Sunday morning, November 8, 1868.

===Watterson era===

Henry Watterson, the son of a Tennessee congressman, had written for &quot;Harper&#x27;s Magazine&quot; and &quot;The&quot; &quot;New York Times&quot; before enlisting in the Confederate Army. He became nationally known for his work as &quot;The Courier-Journal&quot; emerged as the region&#x27;s leading paper. He supported the Democratic Party and pushed for the industrialization of Kentucky and the South in general, notably through urging the Southern Exposition be held in Louisville. He attracted controversy for attempting to prove that Christopher Marlowe had actually written the works of Shakespeare. He won a Pulitzer Prize in 1917 for editorials demanding the United States enter World War I.

&quot;The Courier-Journal&quot; founded a companion afternoon edition of the paper, &quot;The Louisville Times&quot;, in May 1884. In 1896, Watterson and Haldeman opposed Democratic presidential candidate William Jennings Bryan over his support of free silver coinage. This unpopular decision upset readers and advertisers, many of whom pulled their support for &quot;The Courier-Journal&quot;. Kentucky voted for the Republican candidate in 1896, the first time in state history, and local political leaders blamed the Courier. Only the popularity of &quot;The Louisville Times&quot;, which had no strong editorial reputation, saved the newspaper company from bankruptcy. The &quot;Courier&quot; supported Bryan in future elections.

Haldeman had owned the papers until his death in 1902, and by 1917 they were owned by his son, William, and Henry Watterson.

===Bingham ownership===
On August 8, 1918, Robert Worth Bingham purchased two-thirds interest in the newspapers and acquired the remaining stock in 1920. The liberal Bingham clashed with longtime editor Watterson, who remained on board, but was in the twilight of his career. Watterson&#x27;s editorials opposing the League of Nations appeared alongside Bingham&#x27;s favoring it, and Watterson finally retired on April 2, 1919.

As publisher, Bingham set the tone for his editorial pages, and pushed for improved public education, support of African Americans and the poor of Appalachia. In 1933, the newspapers passed to his son, Barry Bingham, Sr. Barry Bingham would continue in his father&#x27;s footsteps, guiding the editorial page and modernizing the paper by setting up several news bureaus throughout the state, expanding the news staff. During Barry Bingham, Sr.&#x27;s tenure, the paper was considered Kentucky&#x27;s &quot;Newspaper of Record&quot; and consistently ranked among the 10 best in the nation.

In 1971, Barry Bingham, Jr. succeeded his father as the newspapers&#x27; editor and publisher.

The Binghams were well-liked owners popularly credited with being more concerned with publishing quality journalism than making heavy profits. They also owned the leading local radio and television stations – WHAS-TV, WHAS-AM, and WAMZ-FM—and Standard Gravure, a rotogravure printing company that printed &quot;The Courier-Journal&quot; Sunday &quot;Magazine&quot; as well as similar magazines for other newspapers.

Barry Bingham Jr. sought to free the papers from conflicts of interests, and through &quot;The Louisville Times&quot;, experimented with new ideas such as signed editorials. Bingham Jr. also parted with tradition by endorsing several Republican candidates for office.

In 1974, Carol Sutton became managing editor of &quot;The Courier-Journal&quot;, the first woman appointed to such a post at a major US daily newspaper. Under the leadership of C. Thomas Hardin, director of photography, the combined photography staff of &quot;The Courier-Journal and Louisville Times&quot; was awarded the 1976 Pulitzer Prize for Feature Photography for its coverage of school desegregation in Louisville.

Barry Bingham, Jr. served as editor and publisher until he resigned in 1986, shortly after his father announced that the newspaper company was for sale, in large measure because of disagreements between Bingham Jr. and his sister Sallie.

===Gannett ownership===
On January 8, 1986, Barry Bingham Sr. announced his intent to sell the family owned media properties including the Courier-Journal. In July 1986, Gannett Company, Inc. purchased the newspaper company for $300 million, outbidding The Washington Post and the Tribune company. Gannett appointed George N. Gill President and Publisher who had been with the newspaper and the Binghams for over two decades. Gill worked his way up from copy editor to chief executive officer of the Bingham Companies. In 1993, Gill retired and Edward E. Manassah became president and Publisher.

February 1987 saw the last publication of &quot;The Louisville Times&quot;, which like most afternoon papers had experienced declining readership; the news operations of the two papers had previously been consolidated under Gannett. The surviving Courier featured a strong news content increase by 29%.

In 1989, the paper&#x27;s news staff won the Pulitzer Prize for general local reporting for what the Pulitzer board called &quot;exemplary initial coverage&quot; of a collision that was the nation&#x27;s worst drunk-driving crash and school-bus accident. In 2005, cartoonist Nick Anderson won the paper&#x27;s 10th Pulitzer, but when he left for the &quot;Houston Chronicle&quot;, the paper did not replace him, instead relying largely on submissions from local cartoonists. One, lawyer Marc Murphy, has become a near-regular and gained respect for his work.

The newspaper resumed polling on elections, and began video streaming its editorial-board conferences with major candidates, under Publisher Arnold &quot;Arnie&quot; Garson, who came from the Argus Leader, Gannett&#x27;s paper in Sioux Falls, S.D., in late 2008. Garson is an outspoken promoter of the future of printed newspapers in the digital age. Under him, the paper began keeping occasional major stories or sports columns off its website and promoting them as print exclusives. Most of these have run on Sundays; in July 2009, Garson announced that the paper&#x27;s Sunday home-delivery circulation was up 0.5 percent over the previous year.

<doc id="929611" wikidata="Q7540499" url="?curid=929611" title="Sligo Creek">
<text>Sligo Creek is a free-flowing tributary of the Northwest Branch of the Anacostia River in Maryland. (The Anacostia, in turn, feeds into the Potomac River and eventually empties into the Atlantic Ocean via Chesapeake Bay.) The creek is approximately long, with a drainage area of about .

== Geography ==
The creek rises in the Kemp Mill section of Silver Spring in Montgomery County and joins with Northwest Branch near the city of Hyattsville in Prince George&#x27;s County. The lower portion of the creek has been channelized. Elevations in the subwatershed range from above sea level to at the confluence with Northwest Branch; the average gradient for the course of the creek is 0.72%.

Contributing streams that flow into the creek include Wheaton Branch, Comstock Branch, Takoma Park Branch, and Long Branch.

Sligo Creek is one of the most heavily urbanized subwatersheds in the Anacostia watershed, with a population density of 7,081 people per mi2. 75% of the watershed is in Montgomery County, 20% is in Prince George&#x27;s County, and 5% is in the District of Columbia. Less than 15% of the subwatershed is undeveloped, and only 10% is forested. Less than 0.01% of the area is wetlands.

From its source to the confluence with the Northwest Branch, the creek crosses through the communities of Silver Spring, Wheaton, Takoma Park, Carole Highlands, Chillum and Hyattsville. In these towns, the banks of the creek are in many stretches maintained as public parkland, with grassy lawns and playing fields.

The Sligo Creek Trail, a hiker-biker trail, runs along the creek from Wheaton to the confluence, where it connects with the Anacostia Tributary Trail System. An automobile parkway runs along many parts of the creek in Montgomery County.

==Pollution and stream restoration==

The Sligo Creek watershed is a highly urbanized area, and as a result the water quality in the creek and tributaries is degraded. In 2002 the Maryland Department of the Environment (MDE) classified the creek as having poor water quality. The Montgomery County Government began installing several stormwater management and stream restoration projects in the watershed in 1989, and by 2009 MDE had recognized some improvements in stream quality. Additional county projects are ongoing as of 2018.

==Ecology==
Several species of native anadromous fish spawn in the Sligo Creek watershed, including alewife (&quot;Alosa pseudoharengus&quot;), blueback herring (&quot;Alosa aestivalis&quot;), and white perch (&quot;Morone americana&quot;). According to the Friends of Sligo Creek, other species of fish found in Sligo Creek include the American eel, Bluegill, Rosyside dace, Longnose dace, goldfish, creek chub, white sucker, tessellated darter, golden shiner, Eastern blacknose dace, and green sunfish.

Non-native introduced species living in Sligo Creek include &quot;Faxonius virilis&quot;, the virile crayfish. Virile crayfish have been found in Sligo Creek since at least 1997, and are considered invasive.

== History ==
Sligo Creek was named after the crossroads named &quot;Sligo&quot; founded in the mid 19th century by Irish immigrant workers on the C&amp;O Canal. It may have been named after County Sligo in Ireland. The crossroads was located at Colesville Road and the 7th Street Pike, currently the corner of Colesville Road and Georgia Avenue in Silver Spring. At the time of the Civil War, Sligo had a toll gate on the 7th Street Pike, an inn and a post office. A half mile from the Sligo crossroads Colesville Road crosses Sligo Creek. The 1878 Hopkin&#x27;s atlas of the area around Washington, labels the southern portion of the creek as &quot;Sligers Bra[nch]&quot; (although &quot;Sligo Branch&quot; is used on the atlas&#x27; map for Montgomery County).

Over the years, Sligo Creek has served many purposes for area residents, including powering grist mills and as a drinking water source. In the Takoma Park section of the creek (near Washington Adventist University), the remains of a dam and associated building foundations for the Sligo Creek Waterworks can still be seen. From 1900 to 1930, the waterworks, the earliest public water system in the area, served the city of Takoma Park. The water system was sold to the Washington Suburban Sanitary Commission in 1919, which abandoned the facility in 1930.

Another dam, located where Flower Avenue crosses Sligo Creek, served Sligo Mill which was located where the current New Hampshire Avenue crosses Sligo Creek. Sligo Mill was built in 1812 by investors that included several members of the prominent Maryland Carroll family. In addition to milling grain for local farmers, Sligo Mill distilled whiskey. The mill was demolished in the 1920s.

Overlooking the dam and millpond for Sligo Mill on the right bank of Sligo Creek, the Glen Sligo Hotel and Wildwood Amusement Park were built in 1900. The hotel and amusement park ceased operations in 1903.

Sligo Creek served as the inspiration and title for &quot;Sligo River Blues&quot;, a song by Takoma Park guitarist John Fahey, who popularized the area amongst folk artists. It also inspired &quot;Sligo Creek,&quot; an Irish traditional reel composed by an American banjo, mandolin, fiddle and guitar player Danny Noveck, who lived near the creek at the time he composed the melody. Another prominent folk guitarist, Al Petteway, composed &quot;Sligo Creek&quot; while living in the Takoma Park area. This Scots-influenced guitar tune was later featured as the theme song of &quot;The National Parks&quot;, a PBS miniseries directed by Ken Burns.

The creek, where her son and his friends played as children, was part of the inspiration for Katherine Paterson&#x27;s Newbery Medal award-winning book &quot;Bridge to Terabithia&quot;.

<text>A holiday camp is a type of holiday accommodation, primarily in the United Kingdom, that encourages holidaymakers to stay within the site boundary, and provides entertainment and facilities for them throughout the day. Since the 1970s, the term has fallen out of favour with terms such as holiday park, resort, holiday village and holiday centre replacing it.

As distinct from camping, accommodation typically consisted of wooden chalets, accommodation buildings arranged individually or in blocks. From the 1960s onward, many camps also added static caravan accommodation, and today, many static caravans are also termed holiday camps.

==History==
Cunningham&#x27;s Young Men&#x27;s Holiday Camp at Groudle (1894–1903) then Douglas (1904–1939) on the Isle of Man is sometimes regarded as the first holiday camp, but it differed from the definition (above), especially as accommodation was still in tents. Cunningham&#x27;s was still open by the time Billy Butlin opened his first camp in 1936 (and still averaged 60,000 campers on a good year).

Opened in 1906 by John Fletcher Dodd, Caister Camp in Caister-on-Sea, Norfolk was one of the first permanent camps under canvas (tents), initially catering for men only, it would later open up to families and advertise itself as &quot;The Oldest Established Camp&quot;. By the early 1920s, Caister Camp and others around the country were beginning to include hut-based accommodation.

Inspired by visits to Caister Camp, &#x27;Pa&#x27; Potter opened the first holiday camp with all wooden huts and permanent main buildings in 1920 at a site in Hemsby, Norfolk called Potters Camp. Potters Camp moved to Hopton-on-Sea in 1924 and moved again to a seaside location within that village in 1933. Potters Resort, as it is known today, is now the last surviving of those early pioneering family sites that is still privately owned and run by fourth generation John Potter.

In the 1930s, camps took on a larger scale with the establishment of large chains. The first of these was Warners, founded by Harry Warner who opened his first site on Hayling Island in 1931, with another three opening before the outbreak of World War II. During the early 1930s, Warner asked funfair entrepreneur Billy Butlin to join the board of his company and, in 1935, Butlin observed the construction of Warner&#x27;s holiday camp in Seaton, Devon. Butlin learned from the experience of Warner, and employed the workers who had constructed the Seaton camp to build his first camp under the Butlins name at Skegness, Lincolnshire in 1936. By the outbreak of World War II, Butlin had opened another camp at Clacton-on-Sea, and was in negotiations to build two more (at Ayr in Scotland and Pwllheli in Wales). At that time, there were around 200 holiday camps in the United Kingdom at different seaside locations.

During World War I, the Cunningham&#x27;s holiday camp was used as an internment camp. With the arrival of World War II, the British government realised they could save money by requisitioning the many holiday camps around the country rather than building purpose-built camps for training, stationing troops, internment, and for housing refugees and workers. After the war, most holiday camps in Britain had been damaged by troop occupation; the situation was so bad that questions were raised in Parliament.

The war was not bad for all camp owners. Butlin did a deal with the war minister to sell his unfinished Filey camp and to complete the work at a lower price than the army could complete it. Butlin specified a contractual term to ensure that he could buy his camps back from the war ministry as soon as the war was over. Another person to do well out of the war was Fred Pontin. During the war, Pontin was the manager of a camp housing steel and sugar beet workers. Taking over the job, Pontin found that the previous manager had been assaulted by the workers over a disagreement about food. Pontin quickly set about improving the conditions of those workers. After the war, Pontin took a loan and purchased a former military camp at Brean, Somerset which he opened as his first holiday-camp. His company Pontin&#x27;s was established in 1946.

From the end of the war, through the 1950s and into the mid-1960s, the holiday camp industry thrived. By 1964, Warner had 14 camps across the country, Butlin opened his 10th camp in 1966, and Pontin had expanded into providing trips to Mediterranean locations in 1963. Not all ideas took off. Butlin attempted to expand into the Caribbean in the late 1940s, and hoped to expand the market for his camps in the United States, but by 1950 the venture was wound up, and Butlin admitted defeat and focused his efforts back in Europe.

Through the 1970s and 1980s, the market declined as people began to holiday overseas, taking advantage of the new, cheap package holidays. Pontins was least affected, partly as they were already providing package holidays and partly because their smaller camps meant they had fewer beds to fill. Butlins attempted to diversify into this same market, purchasing smaller camps and caravan parks and marketing them under the Freshfields name.

In the 1980s, many camps were shut down, as holidaymakers increasingly turned to package holidays and individually tailored breaks. The holiday camp was seen as run-of-the-mill or dated. 1983 saw the Butlins camps closed in Filey and Clacton.

Through the 1990s, substantial investment was made in the remaining camps as operators attempted to concentrate their resources. They also attempted to concentrate on specific market sectors. Butlins substantially rebuilt two of its main camps with a focus on caravan accommodation and branded them under sister company Haven – Pwllheli becoming Hafan y Mor and Ayr becoming Craig Tara. The number of Pontins camps was reduced to 8 with several sold off or redeveloped for housing estates. Meanwhile, Warner&#x27;s had experimented with &quot;Adult Only&quot; camps in the 1980s and gone on to develop hotels (usually in historic buildings) providing hotel-type comfort mixed with holiday-camp-style entertainment. The camps have attempted to improve their status by changing away from the holiday camp identity and identifying themselves as holiday centres, resorts, holiday villages, coastal villages, or holiday parks. In 2004, market research company Mintel estimated that 26% of UK adults had used a holiday centre over the preceding two years (an increase of 4% compared to 2001).

==Facilities==
Included in the price would be entertainments provided on site. These would include all or some of the following:

* Ballroom dancing
* Swimming pool
* Funfair
* Table tennis
* Snooker / eight-ball pool
* Cinema
* Bingo

Most camps were by the seaside but some, like &quot;California in England&quot; near Wokingham, Berkshire were beside a lake and catered for a modest 300 guests. &quot;California in England&quot; also had the only glass-floored ballroom in the country.

There were usually extensive childcare facilities such as a crèche and various clubs to keep young children occupied, enabling parents to follow their own pursuits.

In addition, there were usually other facilities for which a fee was charged: bars, restaurants, amusement arcades.

===Catering===
Holidaymakers would pay a fee for their accommodation and decide whether to go &quot;full board&quot; (all meals would also be included in the price), &quot;half board&quot; (only the main meal would be included) or &quot;self-catering&quot; (no meals provided). At the larger camps, it was not impossible for up to 10,000 people to need to be catered for. These camps would have two sittings for each meal, usually an hour apart. This could mean that a camp would serve over 200,000 meals per week, all cooked on site. In a typical year in the early 1960s, Butlins would cook:

* 3.5 million eggs
* 100 tons (about 100 tonnes) of sausages
* 120,000 gallons (550,000 litres) of soup
* 1,570 tons (1,600 tonnes) of potatoes
* 34 tons (about 35 tonnes) of tea (enough for over 20 million cups)
* 240 tons (244 tonnes) of pork chops (requiring over 8,000 pigs)

==Frontline staff==
It was Billy Butlin&#x27;s idea that frontline staff should wear red blazers to identify themselves, and rival companies adopted different colours. Butlin&#x27;s staff were called Redcoats, Pontins&#x27; staff were Bluecoats, and Warner&#x27;s staff were Greencoats. Their duties ranged from adult entertainer or children&#x27;s entertainer to stewarding.

With the growth of caravan parks in the 1970s and 1980s, the entertainment teams adopted more modern names, such as the HavenMates or the FunStars.

<text>Louis-Pierre Anquetil (21 February 1723 – 6 September 1808) was a French historian.

==Biography==
He was born in Paris on 21 February 1723. In 1741, he joined the religious community of the Génofévains, where he took holy orders and became professor of theology and literature. Later, he became rector of the seminary at Reims, where he published the 3-volume &quot;Civil and Political History of Reims&quot; (), in 1756 and 1757. In 1759, he was appointed prior of the abbey de la Roe in Anjou; shortly thereafter he became director of the college of Senlis. While there, he composed a history of France in the 16th and 17th centuries (&quot;&quot;) published in 1767. The year before, he had obtained the curacy or priory of Chateau-Renard near Montargis. He also became a member of the Académie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres.

At the beginning of the French Revolution, he moved to the curacy of La Villette near Paris but, during the Reign of Terror, he was imprisoned at St-Lazare. While there, he began his summary of world history (&#x27;), afterwards published in nine volumes. On the establishment of the National Institute, he was elected as a 2nd-class member of the Academy of Moral and Political Science. He was also employed by the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs, an experience which informed his treatment of the last three kings of the Ancient Regime (&#x27;).

He is said to have been asked by Napoleon to write his 14-volume &quot;History of France&quot; (&quot;&quot;, 1805). Augustin Thierry criticized the work as &quot;cold and colourless&quot;, and mentioned that Anquetil compared unfavorably to other noted French historians. The work was compiled at second or third hand and censurable in many respects but went through numerous editions and made Anquetil famous. It was continued by Adolphe Bouillet in 6 more volumes. He died on 6 September 1808.

His younger brother Abraham was a famous orientalist.

<text>Ski wax is a material applied to the bottom of snow runners, including skis, snowboards, and toboggans, to improve their coefficient of friction performance under varying snow conditions. The two main types of wax used on skis are glide waxes and grip waxes. They address kinetic friction—to be minimized with a glide wax—and static friction—to be achieved with a grip wax. Both types of wax are designed to be matched with the varying properties of snow, including crystal type and size, and moisture content of the snow surface, which vary with temperature and the temperature history of the snow. Glide wax is selected to minimize sliding friction for both alpine and cross-country skiing. Grip wax (also called &quot;kick wax&quot;) provides on-snow traction for cross-country skiers, as they stride forward using classic technique.

Modern plastic materials (e.g. high-modulus polyethylene and Teflon), used on ski bases, have excellent gliding properties on snow, which in many circumstances diminish the added value of a glide wax. Likewise, uni-directional textures (e.g. fish scale or micro-scale hairs) underfoot on cross-country skis can offer a practical substitute for grip wax for those skiers, using the classic technique.

== History ==

Johannes Scheffer in &quot;Argentoratensis Lapponiæ&quot; (History of Lapland) in 1673 gave what is probably the first recorded instruction for ski wax application He advised skiers to use pine tar pitch and rosin. Ski waxing was also documented in 1761. In 1733 the use of tar was described by Norwegian colonel Jens Henrik Emahusen. In the 1740s Sami people use of resin and tallow under their skis is recorded in writing.

Beginning around 1854, California gold rush miners held organized downhill ski races. They also discovered that ski bases, smeared with lubricants brewed from vegetable and/or animal compounds, increased speed. This led to some of the first commercial ski lubricants, such as &quot;Black Dope&quot; and &quot;Sierra Lighting&quot;; both were mainly composed of sperm oil, vegetable oil and pine pitch. However, some instead used paraffin candle wax that melted onto ski bases, and these worked better under colder conditions.

Pine tar on wooden ski bases proved effective for using skis as transport over the centuries, because it fills the pores of the wood and creates a hydrophobic surface that minimizes suction from water in the snow, yet has sufficient roughness to allow traction for forward motion. In the 1920s and 30s, new varnishes were developed by European companies as season-long ski bases. A significant advance for cross country racing was the introduction of klister, for good traction in granular snow, especially in spring conditions; klister was invented and patented in 1913 by Peter Østbye. In the early 1940s Astra AB, a Swedish chemical company, advised by Olympic crosscountry skier Martin Matsbo, started the development of petroleum-based waxes, using paraffin wax and other admixtures. By 1952, such noted brands as Toko, Swix and Rex were providing an array of color-coded, temperature-tailored waxes.

In the last quarter of the 20th century, researchers addressed the twin problems of water and impurities adhering to skis during spring conditions. Terry Hertel addressed both problems, first with the novel use of a surfactant that interacted with the wax matrix in such a way as to repel water effectively, a product introduced in 1974 by Hertel Wax. Hertel also developed the first fluorocarbon product and the first spring-time wax that repels and makes the running surface slick for spring time alpine ski and snowboard. This technology was introduced to the market in 1986 by Hertel Wax. In 1990, Hertel filed for a U.S. patent on a &quot;ski wax for use with sintered-base snow skis&quot;, containing paraffin, a hardener wax, roughly 1% per-fluoroether diol, and 2% SDS surfactant. Trademarks for Hertel waxes are Super HotSauce, Racing FC739, SpringSolution and White Gold. In the 1990s, Swix chief chemist Leif Torgersen found a glide wax additive to repel pollen and other snow impurities—a problem with soft grip waxes during distance races—in the form of a fluorocarbon that could be ironed into the ski base. The solution was based on the work of Enrico Traverso at Enichem SpA, who had developed a fluorocarbon powder with a melting temperature just a few degrees below that of sintered polyethylene, patented in Italy as a &quot;ski lubricant comprising paraffinic wax and hydrocarbon compounds containing a perfluorocarbon segment&quot;.

==Science of sliding on snow==

The ability of a ski or other runner to slide over snow depends on both the properties of the snow and the ski to result in an optimum amount of lubrication from melting the snow by friction with the ski—too little and the ski interacts with solid snow crystals, too much and capillary attraction of meltwater retards the ski.

===Friction===
Before a ski can slide, it must overcome the maximum value static friction, formula_1, for the ski/snow contact, where formula_2 is the coefficient of static friction and formula_3 is the normal force of the ski on snow. Kinetic (or dynamic) friction occurs when the ski is moving over the snow. The coefficient of kinetic friction, formula_4, is less than the coefficient of static friction for both ice and snow. The force required for sliding on snow is the product of the coefficient of kinetic friction and the normal force: formula_5. Both the static and kinetic coefficients of friction increase with colder snow temperatures (also true for ice).

===Snow properties===

Snowflakes have a wide range of shapes, even as they fall; among these are: six-sided star-like dendrites, hexagonal needles, platelets and icy pellets. Once snow accumulates on the ground, the flakes immediately begin to undergo transformation (called &quot;metamorphism&quot;), owing to temperature changes, sublimation, and mechanical action. Temperature changes may be from the ambient temperature, solar radiation, rainwater, wind, or the temperature of the material beneath the snow layer. Mechanical action includes wind and compaction. Over time, bulk snow tends to consolidate—its crystals become truncated from breaking apart or losing mass with sublimation directly from solid to gas and with freeze-thaw, causing them to combine as coarse and granular ice crystals. Colbeck reports that fresh, cold, and man-made snow all interact more directly with the base of a ski and increase friction, indicating the use of harder waxes. Conversely, older, warmer, and denser snows present lower friction, in part due to increased grain size, which better promotes a water film and a smoother surface of the snow crystals for which softer waxes are indicated.

===Ski friction properties===
Colbeck offers an overview of the five friction processes of skis on snow. They are the: 1) resistance due to plowing of snow out of the way, 2) deformation of the snow over which the ski is traveling, 3) lubrication of the ski with a thin layer of melt water, 4) capillary attraction of water in the snow to the ski bottom, and 5) contamination of the snow with dust and other non-slippery elements. Plowing and deformation pertain to the interaction of the ski, as a whole, with the snow and are negligible on a firm surface. Lubrication, capillary attraction and contamination are issues for the ski bottom and the wax that is applied to reduce sliding friction or achieve adequate grip.

Typically, a sliding ski melts a thin and transitory film of lubricating layer of water, caused by the heat of friction between the ski and the snow in its passing. Colbeck suggests that the optimum water film thickness is in the range between 4 and 12 &quot;μ&quot;m. However, the heat generated by friction can be lost by conduction to a cold ski, thereby diminishing the production of the melt layer. At the other extreme, when the snow is wet and warm, heat generation creates a thicker film that can create increased capillary drag on the ski bottom. Kuzmin and Fuss suggest that the most favorable combination of ski base material properties to minimize ski sliding friction on snow include: increased hardness and lowered thermal conductivity of the base material to promote meltwater generation for lubrication, wear resistance in cold snow, and hydrophobicity to minimize capillary suction. These attributes are readily achievable with a PTFE base, which diminishes the value added by glide waxes. Lintzén reports that factors other than wax are much more important in reducing friction on cross-country skate skis—the curvature of the ski and snow conditions.

== Glide wax ==
Glide wax can be applied to alpine skis, snowboards, skate skis, classic skis, back-country skis, and touring skis. Traditional waxes comprise solid hydrocarbons. High-performance &quot;fluorocarbon&quot; waxes also contain fluorine, which substitutes some fraction of the hydrogen atoms in the hydrocarbons with fluorine atoms to achieve lower coefficients of friction and higher water repellency than the pure hydrocarbon wax can achieve. Wax is adjusted for hardness to minimize sliding friction as a function of snow properties, which include the effects of:
*Age: Reflects the metamorphism of snow crystals that are sharp and well-defined, when new, but with aging become broken or truncated with wind action or rounded into ice granules with freeze-thaw, all of which affects a ski&#x27;s coefficient of friction.
*Moisture content: The percentage of mass that is liquid water and may create suction friction with the base of the ski as it slides.
*Temperature: Affects the ease with which sliding friction can melt snow crystals at the interface between ski and snow.

===Properties===
A variety of glide waxes are tailored for specific temperature ranges and other snow properties with varying wax hardness and other properties that address repellence of moisture and dirt. The hardness of the glide wax affects the melting of the snow to lubricate its passage over the surface and its ability to avoid suction from meltwater in the snow. Too little melting and sharp edges of snow crystals or too much suction impede the passage of the ski. A tipping point between where crystal type dominates sliding friction and moisture content dominates occurs around . Harder waxes address colder, drier or more abrasive snow conditions, whereas softer waxes have a lower coefficient of friction, but abrade more readily. Wax formulations combine three types of wax to adjust coefficient of friction and durability. From hard to soft, they include synthetic waxes with 50 or more carbon atoms, microcrystalline waxes with 25 to 50 carbon atoms and paraffin waxes with 20 to 35 carbon atoms. Additives to such waxes include graphite, teflon, silicon, fluorocarbons, and molybdenum to improve glide and/or reduce dirt accumulation.

===Application===
Glide wax can be applied cold or hot. Cold applications include, rubbing hard wax like a crayon, applying a liquid wax or a spray wax. Hot applications of wax include the use of heat from an iron, infrared lamp, or a &quot;hot box&quot; oven.

===Base material===
The role of glide wax is to adapt and improve the friction properties of a ski base to the expected snow properties to be encountered on a spectrum from cold crystalline snow to saturated granular snow. Modern ski bases often are made from ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene (UHMWPE). Kuzmin asserts that UHMWPE is non-porous and can hold neither wax nor water, so there is no possibility for filling pores; furthermore, he asserts that UHMWPE is very hydrophobic, which means that wet snow does not appreciably retard the ski and that glide wax offers little additional ability to repel water. He notes that clear bases are more durable and hydrophobic than those with carbon content. The same author asserts that texture is more important than surface chemistry for creating the optimum balance between a running surface that&#x27;s too dry (not slippery enough) and too wet (ski subject to suction forces). In warm, moist snow, texture can help break the retarding capillary attraction between the ski base and the snow. Giesbrecht agrees that low wetting angle of the ski base is key and also emphasizes the importance of the degree of surface roughness at the micrometre scale as a function of snow temperature—cold snow favoring a smoother surface and wetter, warmer snow favoring a textured surface. Some authors question the necessity to use any glide waxes on modern ski bases.

== Grip wax ==
Cross-country skiers use a grip wax (also called &quot;kick wax&quot;) for classic-style waxable skis to provide traction with static friction on the snow that allows them to propel themselves forward on flats and up hills. They are applied in an area beneath the skier&#x27;s foot and extending, somewhat forward, that is formed by the camber of the classic ski, called the &quot;grip zone&quot; (or &quot;kick zone&quot;). The presence of camber allows the skis to grip the snow, when the weight is on one ski and the ski is fully flexed, but minimize drag when the skis are weighted equally and are thus less than fully flexed. Grip waxes are designed for specific temperature ranges and types of snow; a correctly selected grip wax does not appreciably decrease the glide of skis that have proper camber for the skier&#x27;s weight and for the snow conditions. There are two substances used for grip wax: hard wax and klister.
* Hard wax: a traditionally paraffin wax-based substance with admixtures—for snow comprising crystals that are relatively intact and not substantially changed by packing or freeze-thaw. The admixtures, which include a dye, rubber, rosin, resin and colophony, adjust the hardness of the wax to tailor the effectiveness of its grip for specific, discrete temperature ranges (from approximately -25 °F to +35 °F); waxes are graded and color-coded according to these temperature ranges. Harder grip waxes are designed for colder snow temperatures, but grip poorly in warm temperatures. Conversely, softer waxes in cold temperatures create enough friction and melting that the melt layer may accumulate and promote frozen accretion of snow.

* Klister: a sticky ointment, which may contain a combination of rosins, waxes, solvents and fats—with the formulation tailored for snow that comprises coarse crystals, having been transformed through freeze-thaw or being wind-blown, and adjusted for specific temperature ranges. Spray-on klister is more convenient than klister applied from a tube. An incorrect match of klister to snow conditions can also cause icing.

Some skis are &quot;waxless&quot;, having a fish-scale or other texture to prevent the ski from sliding backwards. Ski mountaineers use temporarily adhered climbing skins to provide uphill grip, but typically remove them for descent.
== Wax solvents ==

Wax can be dissolved by non-polar solvents like mineral spirits. However, some commercial wax solvents are made from citrus oil, which is less toxic, harder to ignite, and gentler on the ski base.

==Health and environmental effects==

=== Health ===

Ski wax may contain chemicals with potential health affects including per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs). Levels of perfluorinated carboxylic acids, especially perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), have been shown to increase in ski wax technicians during the ski season.

=== Environment ===

When skiing, the friction between the snow and skis causes wax to abrade and remain in the snow pack until spring thaw. Then the snowmelt drains into watersheds, streams, lakes and rivers, thereby changing the chemistry of the environment and the food chain. PFASs in ski wax are heat resistant, chemically and biologically stable, and thus environmentally persistent. They have been shown to accumulate in animals that are present at ski venues. The International Ski Federation (FIS) introduced a ban on PFASs in waxes in all competitive ski disciplines from the winter season of 2020/21. In January of 2022, the EPA released an enforcement alert which revealed that the manufacture and import of waxes containing PFAS violated the Toxic Substances Control Act. Most major manufacturers of competition ski wax have since ended production of waxes containing PFASs.

<text>Johanna Selhorst &quot;Josie&quot; Maran (born May 8, 1978) is an American model, actress, and entrepreneur.

==Early life==
Josie Maran was born May 8, 1978, in Menlo Park, California. Her father is of Russian Jewish ancestry and worked in green home construction. Her mother Roberta was an artist, interior decorator and had chronic fatigue syndrome, which inspired the family to live more healthily. She was raised in the San Francisco Bay Area. 

Maran attended Castilleja School, an all-girls school in Palo Alto, California, from grades 7 to 12.

==Modeling and acting career==
While she was still in high school, Maran was approached by a woman who asked her for a modeling performance in San Francisco, and a scouting agent encouraged her to pursue modeling professionally. In 1990 an appendectomy left Maran with a noticeable scar that is typically edited out of photos.

Signed at age 17 with the Elite modeling agency of Los Angeles, Maran appeared on her first cover with &quot;Glamour&quot; magazine in 1998; she was then the featured Guess? Girl in their summer 1998 and fall 1998 campaigns. After building a résumé of over 25 commercials and advertisements, including playing Howie D&#x27;s companion in the music video of Backstreet Boys hit &quot;Everybody (Backstreet&#x27;s Back)&quot;, in which she was bitten on the neck by Count Dracula (played by Howie D), Maran moved cross-country to join with Elite in New York City. In 1999, she landed a multi-year deal with Maybelline. Maran appeared in the annual &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; Swimsuit Issue for three consecutive years: from 2000 to 2002.

Maran&#x27;s interest in music led her to play casually in two bands: Darling, with Nicole Richie, and Hollywood 2000, where she sang and played violin.

In 2001, Maran appeared in an independent film, as title character Mallory in &quot;The Mallory Effect&quot;. Maran followed this by appearing as Susan in &quot;Swatters&quot; in 2002. In 2004, she appeared in three films: As a French model in &quot;Little Black Book&quot;, as one of Dracula&#x27;s brides, Marishka, in &quot;Van Helsing&quot;, and briefly as a cigarette girl in &quot;The Aviator&quot;. Maran appeared in a short film &quot;The Confession&quot; alongside Wentworth Miller in 2005, and as Kira Hayden in &quot;The Gravedancers&quot; in 2006.

Maran appeared in the street-racing video game &quot;Need for Speed: Most Wanted&quot; released in November 2005. She played Mia Townsend, who guides the player&#x27;s character through the game.

Maran competed in the 2007 season of &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot;, but she and dance partner Alec Mazo were the first couple eliminated.

==Josie Maran Cosmetics==
In June 2007, Maran launched her own natural cosmetics product line, named &quot;Josie Maran Cosmetics&quot;. The company motto is &quot;luxury with a conscience&quot; and the main ingredient of the skincare and cosmetics is fair trade argan oil, grown and harvested by co-ops of Moroccan women.

Beyond her business activities she commits herself to the protection and improvement of nature and the environment.

==Personal life==
Maran and her ex-partner, Iranian-American photographer Ali Alborzi, have two daughters, Rumi Joon (born 2006), and Indi Joon (born 2012). Maran married David Belle on August 26, 2018.

<doc id="929643" wikidata="Q1132408" url="?curid=929643" title="No One Writes to the Colonel">
<text>No One Writes to the Colonel () is a novella written by the Colombian writer Gabriel García Márquez. It also gives its name to a short story collection. García Márquez considered it his best book, saying that he had to write &quot;One Hundred Years of Solitude&quot; so that people would read &quot;No One Writes to the Colonel&quot;.

The novella was written between 1956 and 1957 while the author was living in Paris in the Hotel des Trois Colleges and was first published in 1958, in Mito Revista Bimestral de Cultura v. IV no. 19 (May-June 1958), with first separate publication in 1961.

==Plot summary==
The novella is the story of an impoverished retired colonel, a veteran of the Thousand Days&#x27; War, who still hopes to receive the pension he was promised some fifteen years earlier. The colonel lives with his asthmatic wife in a small village under martial law. The action opens with the colonel preparing to go to the funeral of a town musician whose death is notable because he was the first to die from natural causes in many years. The novel is set during the years of &quot;La Violencia&quot; in Colombia, when martial law and censorship prevail.

==Literary significance and criticism==

Unlike many other García Márquez works, the novel mostly does not fall within the magic realism genre, as it includes only one magical event.

The main characters of the novel are not named, adding to the feeling of insignificance of an individual living in Colombia. The colonel and his wife, who have lost their son to political repression, are struggling with poverty and financial instability. The corruption of the local and national officials is evident and this is a topic which García Márquez explores throughout the novel, by using references to censorship and the impact of government on society. The colonel desperately tries to sell their inheritance from their only son who is now dead and eventually the only reminder of his existence is a rooster that the colonel trains to take part in a cockfight.

In his memoir &quot;Vivir para contarla&quot; (&quot;Living to Tell the Tale&quot;, 2002), García Márquez explained that the novel was inspired by his grandfather, who was also a colonel and who never received the pension he was promised. However, there is also speculation that García Márquez took inspiration from his experience of unemployment in 1956 after the newspaper he had been working for shut down. The daily lives he witnessed during this time are said to be one of his inspirations for this novel.

==Film, TV or theatrical adaptations==
A motion picture based on the novella was made in 1999. Directed by Arturo Ripstein, it stars Fernando Luján as the colonel.
A feature film based on the novella and titled &quot;Only Death Comes for Sure&quot; was released in 1993. The film was directed by Marina Tsurtsumiya.

<text>Key generation is the process of generating keys in cryptography. A key is used to encrypt and decrypt whatever data is being encrypted/decrypted.

A device or program used to generate keys is called a key generator or keygen.

==Generation in cryptography==
Modern cryptographic systems include symmetric-key algorithms (such as DES and AES) and public-key algorithms (such as RSA). Symmetric-key algorithms use a single shared key; keeping data secret requires keeping this key secret. Public-key algorithms use a public key and a private key. The public key is made available to anyone (often by means of a digital certificate). A sender encrypts data with the receiver&#x27;s public key; only the holder of the private key can decrypt this data.

Since public-key algorithms tend to be much slower than symmetric-key algorithms, modern systems such as TLS and SSH use a combination of the two: one party receives the other&#x27;s public key, and encrypts a small piece of data (either a symmetric key or some data used to generate it). The remainder of the conversation uses a (typically faster) symmetric-key algorithm for encryption.

Computer cryptography uses integers for keys. In some cases, keys are randomly generated using a &quot;random number generator (RNG)&quot; or &quot;pseudorandom number generator (PRNG)&quot;. A PRNG is a computer algorithm that produces data that appears random under analysis. PRNGs that use system entropy to seed data generally produce better results, since this makes the initial conditions of the PRNG much more difficult for an attacker to guess. Another way to generate randomness is to utilize information outside the system. Veracrypt (a disk encryption software) utilizes user mouse movements to generate unique seeds, in which users are encouraged to move their mouse sporadically. In other situations, the key is derived deterministically using a passphrase and a key derivation function.

Many modern protocols are designed to have forward secrecy, which requires generating a fresh new shared key for each session.

Classic cryptosystems invariably generate two identical keys at one end of the communication link and somehow transport one of the keys to the other end of the link. However, it simplifies key management to use Diffie–Hellman key exchange instead.

The simplest method to read encrypted data without actually decrypting it is a brute-force attack—simply attempting every number, up to the maximum length of the key. Therefore, it is important to use a sufficiently long key length; longer keys take exponentially longer to attack, rendering a brute-force attack impractical. Currently, key lengths of 128 bits (for symmetric key algorithms) and 2048 bits (for public-key algorithms) are common.

==Generation in physical layer==

===Wireless channels===
A wireless channel is characterized by its two end users. By transmitting pilot signals, these two users can estimate the channel between them and use the channel information to generate a key which is secret only to them. The common secret key for a group of users can be generated based on the channel of each pair of users.

===Optical fiber===
A key can also be generated by exploiting the phase fluctuation in a fiber link.

==See also==
* Distributed key generation: For some protocols, no party should be in the sole possession of the secret key. Rather, during &quot;distributed key generation&quot;, every party obtains a share of the key. A threshold of the participating parties need to cooperate to achieve a cryptographic task, such as decrypting a message.

<text>Patrick O&#x27;Callaghan (28 January 1906 – 1 December 1991) was an Irish athlete and double Olympic gold medallist. He was the first athlete from Ireland to win an Olympic medal under the Irish flag rather than the British flag.

==Early and private life==
O&#x27;Callaghan was born in the townland of Knockaneroe, near Kanturk, County Cork, on 28 January 1906, the second of three sons born to Paddy O&#x27;Callaghan, a farmer, and Jane Healy. He began his education at the age of two at Derrygalun national school. O&#x27;Callaghan progressed to secondary school in Kanturk and at the age of fifteen, he won a scholarship to the Patrician Academy in Mallow. During his year in the Patrician Academy, he cycled the round trip from Derrygalun every day and he never missed a class. O&#x27;Callaghan subsequently studied medicine at the Royal College of Surgeons in Dublin. Following his graduation in 1926 as the youngest doctor ever produced by RCSI, he joined the Royal Air Force Medical Service. He returned to Ireland in 1928 and set up his own medical practice in Clonmel, County Tipperary, where he worked until his retirement in 1984. O&#x27;Callaghan was also a renowned field sports practitioner, greyhound trainer and storyteller.

==Sporting career==

===Early sporting life===

O’Callaghan was born into a family that had a huge interest in a variety of different sports. His uncle, Tim Vaughan, was a national sprint champion and played Gaelic football with Cork in 1893. O’Callaghan&#x27;s eldest brother, Seán, also enjoyed football as well as winning a national 440 yards hurdles title, while his other brother, Con, was also regarded as a gifted runner, jumper and thrower. O’Callaghan&#x27;s early sporting passions included hunting, poaching and Gaelic football. He was regarded as an excellent midfielder on the Banteer football team, while he also lined out with the Banteer hurling team.

At university in Dublin, O’Callaghan broadened his sporting experiences by joining the local senior rugby club. This was at a time when the Gaelic Athletic Association forbade players of Gaelic games from playing &quot;foreign sports&quot;. It was also in Dublin that O’Callaghan first developed an interest in hammer-throwing. In 1926, he returned to his native Duhallow where he set up a training regime in that discipline. Here he fashioned his own hammer by boring a one-inch hole through a 16 lb shot and filling it with the ball-bearing core of a bicycle pedal. He also set up a throwing circle in a nearby field where he trained. In 1927, O’Callaghan returned to Dublin where he won that year&#x27;s hammer championship with a throw of . In 1928, he retained his national title with a throw of , a win that allowed him to represent Ireland at the 1928 Summer Olympics. On the same day, O’Callaghan&#x27;s brother, Con, won the shot put and the decathlon and also qualified for the Olympic Games. Between winning his national title and competing in the Olympic Games O’Callaghan improved his throwing distance by recording a distance of at the Royal Ulster Constabulary Sports in Belfast.

In the summer of 1928, the three O’Callaghan brothers paid their own fares when travelling to the Olympic Games in Amsterdam. Pat finished in sixth place in the preliminary round and started the final with a throw of . This put him in third place behind Ossian Skiöld of Sweden but ahead of Malcolm Nokes, the favourite from Great Britain. For his second throw, O’Callaghan used the Swede&#x27;s own hammer and recorded a throw of . This was more than Skiöld&#x27;s throw and resulted in a first gold medal for O’Callaghan and for Ireland. The podium presentation was particularly emotional as it was the first time at an Olympic Games that the Irish tricolour was raised and Amhrán na bhFiann was played.

===Success in Ireland===
After returning from the Olympic Games, O’Callaghan cemented his reputation as a great athlete with additional successes between 1929 and 1932. In the national championships of 1930 he won the hammer, shot-putt, 56 lbs without follow, 56 lbs over-the-bar, discus and high jump.

In the summer of 1930, O’Callaghan took part in a two-day invitation event in Stockholm where Oissian Skoeld was expected to gain revenge on the Irishman for the defeat in Amsterdam. On the first day of the competition, Skoeld broke his own European record with his very first throw. O’Callaghan followed immediately and overtook him with his own first throw breaking the new record. On the second day of the event both O’Callaghan and Skoeld were neck-and-neck, when the former, with his last throw, set a new European record of to win.

===1932 Summer Olympics===
By the time the 1932 Summer Olympics came around, O’Callaghan was regularly throwing the hammer over . The Irish team were much better organised on that occasion and the whole journey to Los Angeles was funded by a church-gate collection. Shortly before departing on the boat and train journey across the Atlantic, O’Callaghan collected a fifth hammer title at the national championships.

On arrival in Los Angeles, O’Callaghan&#x27;s preparations of the defence of his title came unstuck. The surface of the hammer circle had always been of grass or clay and throwers wore field shoes with steel spikes set into the heel and sole for grip. In Los Angeles, however, a cinder surface was to be provided. The Olympic Committee of Ireland had failed to notify O’Callaghan of this change. Consequently, he came to the arena with three pairs of spiked shoes for a grass or clay surface and time did not permit a change of shoe. He wore his shortest spikes, but found that they caught in the hard gritty slab and impeded his crucial third turn. Despite being severely impeded, he managed to qualify for the final stage of the competition with his second throw of . While the final of the 400m hurdles was delayed, O’Callaghan hunted down a hacksaw and a file in the groundskeeper&#x27;s shack and cut off the spikes. O’Callaghan&#x27;s second throw reached a distance of , a score that allowed him to retain his Olympic title. It was Ireland&#x27;s second gold medal of the day as Bob Tisdall had earlier won a gold medal in the 400m hurdles.

===Retirement===
O’Callaghan did not take part in the national athletic championships in Ireland in 1933. However, he still worked hard at training and experimented with a fourth turn to set a new European record at . By this stage, O’Callaghan was rated as the top thrower in the world by the leading international sports journalists. In the early 1930s, a controversy erupted between the British AAA and the National Athletic and Cycling Association of Ireland (NACAI). The British AAA claimed jurisdiction in Northern Ireland while the NACAI claimed jurisdiction over the entire island of Ireland regardless of political division. The controversy came to a head in the lead-up to the 1936 Summer Olympics when the IAAF finally disqualified the NACAI.

O&#x27;Callaghan won the British AAA Championships title in the hammer throw event at the British 1934 AAA Championships. 

O’Callaghan remained loyal to the NACAI, a decision which effectively brought an end to his international athletic career. No Irish team travelled to the 1936 Olympic Games; however, O’Callaghan travelled to Berlin as a private spectator. After Berlin, O’Callaghan&#x27;s international career was over. He declined to join the new Irish Amateur Athletics Union (IAAU) or subsequent IOC-recognised Amateur Athletics Union of Eire (AAUE) and continued to compete under NACAI rules. At Fermoy in 1937 he threw – nearly two metres ahead of the world record of set by his old friend Paddy &#x27;Chicken&#x27; Ryan in 1913. This record, however, was not ratified by the AAUE or the IAAF. In retirement, O’Callaghan remained interested in athletics. He travelled to every Olympic Games up until 1988 and enjoyed fishing and poaching in Clonmel. He died on 1 December 1991.

==Legacy==

O&#x27;Callaghan was the flag bearer for Ireland at the 1932 Olympics. In 1960, he became the first person to receive the Texaco Hall of Fame Award. He was made a Freeman of Clonmel in 1984 and was honorary president of Commercials GAA. In 1988 he was awarded the inaugural Distinguished Graduate Award by the RCSI Association of Medical and Dental Graduates. The Dr Pat O&#x27;Callaghan Sports Complex at Cashel Rd, Clonmel, which is the home of Clonmel Town Football Club, is named after him. In January 2007, a statue to him was raised in Banteer, County Cork.

<text>Conté (; ), also known as Conté sticks or Conté crayons, are a drawing medium composed of compressed powdered graphite or charcoal mixed with a clay base, square in cross-section. They were invented in 1795 by Nicolas-Jacques Conté, who created the combination of clay and graphite in response to the shortage of graphite caused by the Napoleonic Wars (when the British naval blockade of France prevented import). Conté crayons had the advantage of being cost-effective to produce, and easy to manufacture in controlled grades of hardness.

They are now manufactured using natural pigments (iron oxides, carbon black, titanium dioxide), clay (kaolin), and a binder (cellulose ether).

Conté crayons are most commonly found in black, white, and sanguine tones, as well as bistre, shades of grey, and other colors.

Colors sets are especially useful for field studies and color studies. Some artists create entire paintings with them, using them more like pastels than like a drawing medium. They are also used often to sketch under pastel paintings or lay down initial layers before using dry pastels. Colors can be layered to produce different hues or values. Color Conté mixes better on paper than many hard pastel products.

They are frequently used on rough paper that holds pigment grains well. They can also be used on prepared primed canvases for underdrawing for a painting. Conté crayons are hard and have square edges, making them more suitable for detailed hatched work as opposed to the bolder painterly drawing style demanded by soft pastels.

== Georges Seurat ==
In the 1880s, Georges Seurat used Conté crayons to produce many of his studies.

<doc id="929659" wikidata="Q193876" url="?curid=929659" title="Bradley Wiggins">
<text>Sir Bradley Marc Wiggins (born 28 April 1980) is a British former professional road and track racing cyclist, who competed professionally between 2001 and 2016. He began his cycling career on the track, but later made the transition to road cycling. 

He won world titles in four disciplines (Madison, individual pursuit, team pursuit and road time trial), and Olympic gold in three (individual pursuit, team pursuit and road time trial). He is the only rider to have won both World and Olympic championships on both the track and the road as well as winning the Tour de France. He has worn the leader&#x27;s jersey in each of the three Grand Tours of cycling and held the world record in team pursuit on multiple occasions. He won a gold medal at four successive Olympic Games from 2004 to 2016, and held the record as Great Britain&#x27;s most decorated Olympian with 8 medals until Jason Kenny won his 9th in 2021. 

He is the only rider to win both the Tour de France and Olympic Gold in the same year, winning them a week apart in 2012.

The son of the Australian cyclist Gary Wiggins, Wiggins was born to a British mother in Ghent, Belgium, and raised in London from the age of two. He competed on the track from the early part of his career until 2008. Between 2000 and 2008 he won ten medals at the track world championships, of which six were gold: three in the individual pursuit, two in the team pursuit and one in the madison. His first Olympic medal was a bronze in the team pursuit in Sydney 2000, before winning three medals including the gold in the individual pursuit at the Athens 2004, and two golds in the individual and team pursuit at the Beijing 2008.

On the road, Wiggins turned professional in 2001 but made it his focus from 2008. Initially viewed as a time trial specialist and as a rouleur, he showed his ability in stage races when he came fourth in the 2009 Tour de France; he was later promoted to third after Lance Armstrong&#x27;s results were annulled in 2012. He signed with the newly formed in 2010, and in 2011 he claimed his first victory in a major stage race in the Critérium du Dauphiné, as well as finishing third, later promoted to second, in the Vuelta a España. In 2012, Wiggins won the Paris–Nice, the Tour de Romandie, the Critérium du Dauphiné, and became the first British cyclist to win the Tour de France and the time trial at the 2012 Summer Olympics. 

In 2014, he won gold in the time trial at the road world championships, and founded the cycling team. Wiggins returned to the track at the 2014 Commonwealth Games, and in June 2015 he set a new hour record with a distance of . In 2016, he won a further world championship in the madison, and gold in the team pursuit at the Olympics, his fifth successive medal winning appearance at the Games. He retired from all forms of professional cycling on 28 December 2016.

Wiggins was appointed a CBE in 2009. Following his success in 2012, Wiggins was the subject of further honours and awards: the Vélo d&#x27;Or award for best rider of the year, the BBC Sports Personality of the Year Award and a knighthood as part of the 2013 New Year Honours.

During his career and afterwards he faced a series of allegations that he exploited a loophole in cycling&#x27;s anti-doping regulations to use a performance-enhancing drug, injections of the powerful corticosteroid, triamcinolone. He did not receive any bans or suspensions in relation to doping during his career.

On 5 March 2018, the British House of Commons Committee for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport published their report called &quot;Combatting doping in sport&quot;. They concluded &quot;inter alia&quot; that Team Sky had used the powerful banned corticosteroid triamcinolone in 2012 under TUE (Therapeutic Use Exemption) &quot;to prepare Bradley Wiggins, and possibly other riders supporting him, for the Tour de France. The purpose of this was not to treat medical need, but to improve his power to weight ratio ahead of the race.&quot; The report concluded that &quot;drugs were being used by Team Sky, within the World Anti-Doping Agency rules, to enhance the performance of riders, and not just to treat medical need.&quot;

==Early life and amateur career==
Wiggins was born on 28 April 1980 in Ghent, Flanders, Belgium, to an Australian father, Gary Wiggins, and a British mother, Linda. His father lived in Belgium as a professional cyclist. His father left the family when Wiggins was two. Wiggins moved with his mother to her parents&#x27; house in Villiers Road, Willesden Green, northwest London, then to a Church Commissioners flat at Dibdin House estate in neighbouring Maida Vale. He was educated at St Augustine&#x27;s junior school and then St Augustine&#x27;s Church of England High School in Kilburn, where his mother was a secretary. He has a younger half-brother, Ryan, from his mother and her partner Brendan. Brendan and Linda separated when Wiggins was in his late teens.

Football was his first passion and he was an Arsenal fan, although he would watch rivals Tottenham Hotspur play because his friends supported them. He discovered cycling when his mother told him to watch the television coverage of the individual pursuit final of the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona, which Briton Chris Boardman won. She explained it was one of the events at which his father had been successful. He watched the rest of the Olympics and fell in love with cycling and the Olympics itself.
In 1992, aged 12, he entered his first race, the West London Challenge 92, on the unopened A312 dual carriageway in Hayes, west London. Later that year he broke a collarbone in a road accident. He received £1,700 compensation for his injuries. He gave his mother £700 and used the rest to buy his first racing bicycle. &quot;At 12&quot;, he recalled, &quot;I told my art teacher, I&#x27;m going to be Olympic champion, I&#x27;m going to wear the yellow jersey in the Tour.&quot; He joined the Archer Road Club, where his father had been a member in the late 1970s. He raced at Herne Hill Velodrome and on the road around Crystal Palace National Sports Centre. He gained domestic sponsorship from Condor Cycles&#x27;s Olympia Sport and then Team Brite. He represented Westminster in the London Youth Games as a teenager. In recognition of his early achievements, 2010 he was inducted into the London Youth Games Hall of Fame.

At 16, he won the time trial at the 1996 junior national track championships at Saffron Lane sports centre in Leicester. Selectors invited him to train at weekends at Manchester Velodrome. After leaving school he enrolled on a BTEC foundation course in business studies, but left due to cycling commitments. At the 1997 junior national track championships he won the one-kilometre time trial, individual pursuit, points race and scratch race. He was the only British competitor for the 1997 junior track world championships in Cape Town, coming 16th in the individual pursuit and fourth in the points race.

His breakthrough came in June 1998, winning the three-kilometre individual pursuit at the junior track world championships in Cuba, aged 18. The following week, he retained his titles at the junior national track championships in Manchester. He represented England at the Commonwealth Games in Kuala Lumpur, finishing fourth in the individual pursuit, and was a member of the team that won a silver medal in the team pursuit, his first senior medal. He became a full-time Lottery-funded athlete, with a grant of nearly £20,000 a year (equivalent to £ in 2025).

In 1999, he began training with the Great Britain team pursuit squad and rode the PruTour – now known as the Tour of Britain, his first stage race at that level. In October he competed in the track world championships in Berlin, coming fifth in the team pursuit, and with partner Rob Hayles, came tenth in the Madison, securing qualification for the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney. At the Olympics he won a bronze medal in the team pursuit, beating France in the bronze medal match, and came fourth in the Madison with Hayles. In October 2000, he took silver in the team pursuit at the track world championships in Manchester, losing to Germany in the final by under half a second.

==Professional career==

===2001–2004: early years===
In 2001, he signed for the Linda McCartney Racing Team, a British professional road cycling team, but it disbanded after internal problems. He was briefly seen in Sigma Sport colours after the collapse of the Linda McCartney team, but then secured further lottery funding, and began racing for the British national team. He came second in the prologue of the Tour of Rhodes, two seconds behind Fabian Cancellara of , before winning the general classification in the Cinturón a Mallorca and Flèche du Sud. In September he crashed his bike, requiring two metal pins in his right wrist. Two weeks later he went to the track world championships in Antwerp, managing seventh place in the individual pursuit and consecutive silver in the team pursuit.
He joined the French team in 2002, relocating to Nantes, and soon became homesick, finding it a huge contrast to the British Cycling set-up. At the Commonwealth Games in Manchester he won silver medals in the individual pursuit, losing to teammate Bradley McGee (Australia) in the final, and team pursuit, beaten by Australia, who set a new world record with a time of three minutes and 59.583 seconds. At the track world championships in Copenhagen, he came fifth in the individual pursuit and won a bronze medal in the team pursuit. Wiggins was frustrated with his result in the individual pursuit at the world championships and became disillusioned with his future with . British Cycling then enlisted the newly retired Chris Boardman as his mentor.

In May 2003, Wiggins made his Grand Tour debut at the Giro d&#x27;Italia. On the 18th stage he was eliminated from the race, finishing outside of the time limit in a group of 53 riders. In the summer he competed in the track world championships in Stuttgart, qualifying fastest in the individual pursuit, before beating Russia&#x27;s Alexei Markov in the first round, setting up a place in the final against Australia&#x27;s Luke Roberts. He beat Roberts by 0.736 seconds to win the gold medal, his first senior world title. He also came away with a silver medal in the team pursuit, beaten by Australia in the final, who broke their own world record with a time of three minutes and 57.280 seconds. In September he won stage one of the Tour de l&#x27;Avenir, beating teammate Benoît Vaugrenard and &#x27;s Joost Posthuma by 14 seconds. In November he won the Six Days of Ghent with Matthew Gilmore of .

Wiggins signed with for the 2004 season, advised by Boardman, who rode for them his entire professional road career. He began training for the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, at first struggling with illness and fitness, he arrived in peak form; he qualified for the individual pursuit with a time of four minutes and 15.165 seconds, an Olympic record and fifth fastest time in history. In the final he beat McGee by over four seconds to win the gold medal. Wiggins was brought in to the team pursuit squad for the first round against France, replacing Bryan Steel, and advanced into the final, where the team were beaten by Australia, settling for the silver medal. Wiggins then partnered Rob Hayles in the Madison. With 90 laps left of the 200, Hayles crashed with Dutchman Robert Slippens, returning after a few laps. They lost a lap to their rivals, but with 30 to go Wiggins attacked, and they regained the lost lap, moving into second place. They lost points in the final sprint, moving them down to third, taking the bronze medal with 12 points, behind Switzerland on 15 and Australia on 22. Wiggins became the first British athlete in 40 years to win three medals at one Games, the last being Mary Rand at the 1964 Summer Olympics in Tokyo. On 31 December 2004 he was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2005 New Year Honours, for services to sport.

===2005–2007: on the road===
In early 2005, he revealed his desire to compete in road cycling, and in April won the time trial around the town of Briey in northeastern France, on the second stage of the Circuit de Lorraine. In September he won his first race stage since 2001, stage eight of the Tour de l&#x27;Avenir; finishing with teammate Saul Raisin, with third-placed Steve Cummings () coming in three minutes and 24 seconds later. Wiggins competed in the Giro d&#x27;Italia, finishing 123rd overall. He came seventh in the time trial at the road world championships in Madrid, one minute and 31 seconds down on winner Michael Rogers of Australia. He moved to for the 2006 season, and was selected to ride in the Tour de France, finishing his first Tour in 124th place.

In March 2007, Wiggins returned to the track for the track world championships in Palma, Majorca, his first appearance at the championships since 2004. In the qualifying round for the individual pursuit, he set his second fastest time since his personal best at the Olympics in Athens, with a time of four minutes and 15.976 seconds; he beat Germany&#x27;s Robert Bartko in the final to win the gold, catching him after 2750 m. He then went on to win gold in the team pursuit, beating Ukraine in the final. He finished in 13th place in the Madison, with Rob Hayles.
On the road he won stage one of the Four Days of Dunkirk and the prologue of the Critérium du Dauphiné Libéré, before competing in the Tour de France and finishing fourth in the prologue in London. On stage six Wiggins launched a solo breakaway after of racing, leading the race for , before being caught by the peloton with remaining. It was seen as a tribute to British rider Tom Simpson, on the 40th anniversary of his death in the 1967 Tour de France, but was a gift to his wife on her birthday, with Wiggins only finding out about the date&#x27;s significance after the race. He received the stage&#x27;s combativity award, for the most aggressive rider. withdrew from the race before stage 16 after Cristian Moreni failed a doping test. Wiggins and his teammates were interviewed by police and had their hotel rooms searched. In the aftermath of the positive drug tests on Moreni and on race leader Alexander Vinokourov of , Wiggins spoke out against dopers in the Tour and threw away his kit in a bin in Pau Pyrénées Airport, vowing never to race for the team again.

Despite this Wiggins continued racing for , and in August he won the time trial on stage four of the Tour du Poitou-Charentes. In September, with teammate Michiel Elijzen, he won the Duo Normand, a two-man team time trial over a course of . His season on the road ended riding for Great Britain at the road world championships in Stuttgart, coming tenth in the time trial, two minutes and ten seconds behind winner Cancellara of Switzerland; a result he was disappointed with, after hoping to finish on the podium.

In September he signed for the  – later known as  – for the 2008 season, joining compatriot Mark Cavendish, forming a partnership in the Madison. Their first race was the Six Days of Ghent in November, finishing in tenth place; Wiggins still riding for . Wiggins then made his only appearance for the  – which is separate from the road team – at the Beijing round of the 2007–08 Track World Cup Classics in December, winning gold in the individual pursuit and silver in the Madison with Cavendish.
===2008: back to the track===
For the 2008 season, Wiggins&#x27;s focus was on the track and on the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, deciding not to compete in the Tour de France. In February he travelled to the United States to train, and rode the Tour of California, coming second in the prologue, behind Cancellara ().
In March Wiggins competed in the track world championships in Manchester, defending his individual pursuit title by beating Dutchman Jenning Huizenga in the final, his third world title in the discipline. He then won the team pursuit, setting a new world record of three minutes and 56.322 seconds in the final against Denmark. Wiggins was due to partner with Hayles in the Madison, but Hayles failed a routine blood test, and was subsequently banned for two weeks. Cavendish was then brought in as his replacement. At around halfway through the race they appeared to be out of contention, with their closest rivals all gaining a lap; but with 35 laps left to race, Wiggins launched an attack which helped them reach the field ten laps later, taking the lead, due to their superior points they had collected in the sprints. They held on to win the gold medal, finishing with 19 points, ahead of Germany on 13.

Wiggins then rode the Tour de Romandie and the Giro d&#x27;Italia, as preparation for the Olympics in August. At the Giro he was part of the lead-out train that helped Cavendish win two stages. Wiggins came fourth in the final stage&#x27;s -long time trial in Milan, six seconds behind teammate Marco Pinotti, finishing the race in 134th place, three hours, one minute and 39 seconds down on overall winner Alberto Contador of .

At the Olympics he began the defence of his title in the individual pursuit, qualifying with a time of four minutes and 15.031 seconds, breaking his own Olympic record from 2004. In the semi-final he beat Russia&#x27;s Alexander Serov, before taking gold in the final against Hayden Roulston of New Zealand, becoming the first rider to defend an Olympic pursuit title successfully. He was a member of the team pursuit that broke the world record in the heats with a time of three minutes and 55.202 seconds. The following day, the team won the gold medal, beating Denmark by 6.7 seconds with another new world record of three minutes and 53.314 seconds, averaging a speed of . He paired with Cavendish in the Madison, and as the reigning world champions, they were favourites for the gold medal, but they only finished ninth. Cavendish felt that Wiggins had not performed to the best of his ability in the Madison.

In September Wiggins joined the American team for the 2009 season. On 14 December he came ninth in the BBC Sports Personality of the Year Award, with 5,633 votes, and was a member of the British cycling team that won the Team of the Year Award. On 31 December he was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2009 New Year Honours.

===2009: Tour de France breakthrough===
Wiggins switched his focus to road and moved with his family to the city of Girona in north-east Spain, where were based. He started the season in February by helping the team win the opening team time trial of the Tour of Qatar, crossing the line first to take the leaders jersey. In March he came second to Contador in the opening time trial of Paris–Nice, before riding Milan–San Remo and then placing second in the time trial at Critérium International. In April he won the time trial on the final stage of the Three Days of De Panne, twenty seconds ahead of rider Lieuwe Westra in second place, then had top-30 finishes in the Classics: Gent–Wevelgem and Paris–Roubaix. After finishing in 71st position in the Giro d&#x27;Italia and taking second place in the -long time trial on the final stage in Rome, he won the Beaumont Trophy, a domestic one-day race in Northumberland, using it as preparation for the Tour de France three weeks later.
Wiggins arrived at the Tour de France having lost , and was nicknamed &quot;Twiggo&quot;, instead of the usual &quot;Wiggo&quot;. He came third in the time trial on stage one in Monaco, 19 seconds behind &#x27;s Cancellara and one behind Contador. He then helped to second in stage four&#x27;s team time trial, despite losing four riders. On stage seven he finished 12th in the first mountain finish and was in fifth place overall at the beginning of the second week. On stage fifteen in Verbier – the second mountain finish, Wiggins finished fifth, rising to third place overall. On stage 17 Contador, Andreas Klöden () and riders Fränk and Andy Schleck attacked on the final climb – the Col de la Colombière, measuring at an average gradient of 8.5%, and was left with &#x27;s Lance Armstrong and Vincenzo Nibali of , who let Wiggins do all the work before attacking one-kilometre from the summit. Wiggins failed to gain time on the descent and finished three minutes and seven seconds down on winner Fränk Schleck, dropping to sixth overall.

Wiggins moved back up to fourth, after finishing in second place in the time trial on stage 19, finishing in sixth place 42 seconds down on winner Contador. On stage 20 to Mont Ventoux, Wiggins was dropped by the yellow jersey group from the summit, finishing in tenth place and kept fourth overall, three seconds ahead of Fränk Schleck; he held that position in the final stage, equalling Robert Millar&#x27;s highest ever finish by a British rider in the Tour. In October 2012, following the disqualification of Armstrong, who had originally placed third in the general classification, Wiggins was promoted to third place overall. This decision retroactively gave him the first podium finish by a British rider in Tour de France history.

In September Wiggins won the national time trial championship in Buckinghamshire, and in September at the road world championships in Mendrisio, Switzerland, was on course for a bronze medal in the time trial, until a mechanical problem and a delay getting a replacement bike ended with him finishing in 21st place. In October he ended the season by winning the Herald Sun Tour in Victoria, Australia, after helping teammates for most of the race. He led the race after winning the time trial on stage five in Geelong, beating second-placed teammate Svein Tuft by fourteen seconds.

Wiggins had been contracted to ride for Garmin Slipstream again in 2010, but it was announced on 10 December that he was to leave to join , having signed a four-year contract with the new British team.
===2010: move to Team Sky===
Wiggins began 2010 as a team leader for the first time and his main target was to win the Tour de France. In February he was part of the team that won the opening team time trial of the Tour of Qatar, before taking second place in the time trial on stage four of the Vuelta a Andalucía, behind Alex Rasmussen of . He then went on to finish third at the Vuelta a Murcia in March, behind winner František Raboň of and rider Denis Menchov in second.
In May Wiggins took his first Grand Tour victory on the wet streets of Amsterdam in the opening time trial of the Giro d&#x27;Italia, becoming the second Briton to wear the pink jersey after Cavendish in 2009. A series of crashes on the second stage put him 32 seconds behind in the general classification to the new leader Cadel Evans (). Another crash on stage three cost him a further three minutes and 58 seconds. He recovered time on stage 11, finishing fourth, from a group of 56 riders, and lay tenth overall. He faded quickly towards the end of the race, however, losing time in the final stages. He came seventh in the final time trial in Verona. He finished the race 40th overall, one hour, 47 minutes and 58 seconds behind overall winner Ivan Basso of . Throughout the race he told the press he was saving himself for the Tour de France, when asked about his form, but in fact felt physically unfit.

Wiggins then went to a training camp in the Alps, testing the mountain stages used for the Tour; he struggled to find his fitness. He made a poor start in the Tour, taking 77th place in the prologue after an early starting position left him exposed to poor conditions. He finished eighth on stage three, as cobblestones troubled a number of favourites, but on stage eight at Morzine-Avoriaz, the first mountain summit finish of the Tour, he could only manage 19th place, losing one minute and 45-second to stage winner Andy Schleck (). The following day he lost more time, coming 13th and losing four minutes and 55 seconds to the main contenders. He finished in 36th place on stage fourteen, falling to 18th overall, 11 minutes and 30 seconds behind race leader Andy Schleck; to the press he described his form as &quot;consistently mediocre&quot;. On stage 19&#x27;s time trial from Bordeaux to Pauillac, he finished in ninth place, three minutes and 33 seconds behind winner Cancellara. Wiggins finished the Tour in 24th place, 39 minutes and seven seconds down on winner Contador and seven places behind teammate Thomas Löfkvist. In February 2012, Contador was found guilty of doping and Wiggins&#x27;s overall position was upgraded to 23rd.

He returned to racing in August, at the GP Ouest–France in Plouay. In September he retained his title at the national time trial championships, around the -long course in South Wales, before finishing the season at the Tour of Britain. His season ended at the Giro di Lombardia, where he was forced to abandon following a crash. Over the winter he trained with the Great Britain squad at Manchester Velodrome.

===2011: Dauphiné and Vuelta===
Wiggins was team leader of again at the start of 2011. He opted not to enter the Giro d&#x27;Italia, concentrating instead on shorter events and the classics before undertaking altitude training to improve his climbing for the Tour de France. His season began at the Tour of Qatar in February, before winning the team pursuit at the Manchester round of the 2009–10 Track World Cup Classics, with a time of three minutes 55.438, the fifth-fastest time. He then came second in the -long time trial on the sixth stage of the Paris–Nice in March, 20 seconds behind Tony Martin of . He finished third overall, behind Martin and rider Andreas Klöden. In April he rode Paris–Roubaix, and then the Tour de Romandie, finishing third in time trial on stage and helped lead-out teammate Ben Swift to victory on the final stage. In March he finished second in the time trial on the third stage of the Critérium International, four seconds down on Klöden. In May he won the -long time trial on stage four of the Bayern Rundfahrt, beating &#x27;s Cancellara by 33 seconds, and finished the event in 14th place overall, while also helping teammate Geraint Thomas to win the event.
He then went for altitude training in the Alps, in preparation for the Tour. He took the overall lead in the Critérium du Dauphiné after finishing second in the time trial on stage three. On the final three mountain stages, Wiggins maintained his lead over second-placed Evans to win the race, at that time his biggest victory on the road. In June Wiggins won the national road race championship in Northumberland. On the seventh stage of the Tour, a crash around from the finish in Châteauroux forced Wiggins to retire from the race with a broken collarbone.

After he had recovered from his injuries, confirmed that Wiggins would ride in the Vuelta a España for the first time, as well as in the road world championships. Wiggins also confirmed that he would take part the Tour in 2012, even though the Olympics would follow soon after. The Vuelta and the world championships were seen as a dress rehearsal for 2012. He had a difficult start to the Vuelta, as finished 42 seconds behind winners in the opening team time trial in Benidorm, but a strong first week brought him back into contention, leaving him twentieth overall after stage eight. On stage nine, Wiggins and teammate Chris Froome attacked on the final climb to finish fourth and fifth respectively, gaining time on rider Joaquim Rodríguez, Michele Scarponi () and other contenders. Wiggins was expected to take the overall lead in the time trial on the following day, but Froome confounded expectations by finishing second on the stage, and Wiggins only rose to third overall. He eventually took the lead after the rest day. Stage fourteen saw Wiggins and Froome gaining on most of their rivals. However, Wiggins lost the lead to &#x27;s Juan José Cobo on stage fifteen, when he finished fifth on the climb up the Angliru and dropped to third in the standings, behind Froome, who was second. Wiggins finished the Vuelta in third place – his first podium finish in a Grand Tour. In July 2019 Wiggins was retrospectively promoted to second place in the Vuelta after the UCI stripped Cobo of the win for an anti-doping violation.

In September he competed in the road world championships in Copenhagen, he won the silver medal in the time trial, finishing one minute and fifteen seconds behind Germany&#x27;s Martin, and four seconds ahead of reigning champion Cancellara (Switzerland) in third. Four days later, he was part of the Great Britain team that set up Cavendish&#x27;s victory in the road race; Wiggins took over lead on the final lap of 17 around the circuit, setting a high pace to chase down the breakaway and stop attacks from developing.

===2012: Tour de France and Olympic gold===
In 2012 Wiggins continued to focus on road racing. The individual pursuit was removed from the programme at the Olympics later in the year, and in December 2011 coach Rod Ellingworth told &quot;The Guardian&quot;, &quot;The chances of him doing the team pursuit are really slim now&quot;. He began his 2012 season with third place in the Volta ao Algarve, including victory in the concluding time trial, edging out world champion Martin () by less than a second.
In March Wiggins finished second in the opening time trial of the Paris–Nice, one second behind &#x27;s Gustav Larsson, who avoided the wet conditions, unlike Wiggins and the other favourites that set off later in the day. The following day he took the lead in the race after being part of a 30-man breakaway as the peloton split into echelons. He held the lead for the rest of the event, winning the final stage, a time-trial on the Col d&#x27;Èze, to win the race by eight seconds overall and become the first British rider to win the race since Tom Simpson in 1967. His final stage victory was also good enough to give him the points classification. Wiggins&#x27;s time is the fastest time for the traditional time-trial on the Col d&#x27;Èze.

On the stage one of the Tour de Romandie in April, Wiggins took a rare sprint victory from a group of 59 riders. He lost the jersey to rider Luis León Sánchez after Sánchez won two consecutive stages, but won the final time trial, despite suffering a dropped chain, to take the overall victory and become the first Briton to win the race in its 65-year history.

In June Wiggins competed in the Critérium du Dauphiné, and began the defence of his title with a second-place finish in the prologue, one second behind &#x27;s Luke Durbridge. He took the overall lead the following day, after Durbridge was dropped on one of the stage&#x27;s six climbs. Wiggins won the fourth stage of the race, a time trial over a course of , 34 seconds ahead of Martin, his nearest rival, extending his lead over him to 38 seconds. He held the lead to the end, eventually winning by over a minute, with teammate Rogers in second place.
Wiggins entered the Tour de France as one of the favourites to win it. Wiggins began the Tour with second place in the prologue, behind Cancellara of . He took over the yellow jersey by finishing third on stage seven, the first mountaintop finish, becoming the fifth British rider to wear the jersey, and first since David Millar in 2000. Wiggins won the time trial on stage nine. On stage ten, he and his team staved off an attack by Nibali on the descent of the Col du Grand Colombier, with Nibali subsequently accusing Wiggins of disrespecting him: &quot;According to Nibali, Wiggins taunted him at the finish. He turned, looked him in the face and waved&quot;. Wiggins extended his lead on stage 11 after Froome helped him to bridge across to his rivals, who had attacked on the finishing climb to La Toussuire. Froome accelerated about from the finish, and was ordered via his team radio to wait for his leader.

During stage fourteen, a mountain stage, a spectator threw carpet tacks onto the narrow road at the top of the Mur de Péguère climb. Several riders suffered punctures, including Evans, the defending champion, who lost approximately two minutes while his team repaired his bicycle. Wiggins and his fellow members of emerged without a puncture. Believing that a puncture resulting from an unfortunate incident should not determine the fate of a competitor, Wiggins then had his teammates and the rest of the peloton slow down to allow Evans and other affected cyclists to catch up. It was perceived as a generous act of sportsmanship and Wiggins was called &quot;Le Gentleman&quot; as a result. On stage 16, Wiggins and Froome were able to follow attacks by Nibali on the final climb of the day and finished with the same time as the Italian. On stage 17, the final mountain stage, Froome and Wiggins finished together in second and third place respectively, with Nibali coming in 19 seconds later. Wiggins won the time trial on stage 19, giving him a lead of three minutes and 21 seconds at the start of the final stage. On that stage, Wiggins helped teammate Cavendish achieve his fourth consecutive victory on the Champs-Élysées and confirmed his own overall victory in the process. Wiggins became the first, and is currently the only person in history to win the Paris–Nice, the Tour de Romandie, the Critérium du Dauphiné and the Tour de France in a single season.
Wiggins was selected to participate in two road cycling events at the 2012 Summer Olympics in London – the time trial and the road race. Wiggins finished 103rd in the road race. Wiggins won gold in the time trial ahead of Martin of Germany and Froome of Britain. By doing so he became the most decorated British Olympian, with seven medals, surpassing the six won by Sir Steve Redgrave. This record was soon shared with Sir Chris Hoy, who also obtained his seventh Olympic medal in 2012. Wiggins entered the &quot;Guinness World Records&quot;, becoming the first cyclist to win an Olympic gold medal and the Tour de France in the same year. Wiggins&#x27;s boyhood idol Miguel Induráin won five consecutive Tours between 1991 and 1995, and won a gold medal at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta.

Wiggins returned to racing at the Tour of Britain in September, pulling out on the sixth stage with a stomach bug. The road race at the road world championships in Limburg, Netherlands, was his last of the season. In October he was awarded the prestigious &quot;Vélo d&#x27;Or&quot; trophy in recognition of his achievements in 2012. In November he was involved in a road accident and taken to hospital with suspected broken ribs, but was released next day with only minor injuries. In December he won the BBC Sports Personality of the Year Award with 492,064 (30.25%) of the votes cast. Wiggins was knighted in the 2013 New Years Honours for services to cycling, although he claimed he would use the title for &#x27;comedy purposes&#x27;, stating that he felt &quot;a little bit inferior&quot; to others receiving knighthoods saying &quot;I&#x27;ve won a bike race, you know, and I feel a little bit inferior to everyone&quot;, saying &quot;I was just talking to some of the other people getting stuff, and asking them what they&#x27;ve been honoured for, and they&#x27;re historic things, ground-breaking sciences or whatever&quot;. He was among the nominees for the Laureus World Sports Award for Sportsman of the Year, with Jamaican athlete Usain Bolt taking the prize.

===2013: Giro d&#x27;Italia and Tour of Britain===
It was widely expected that Wiggins would ride to retain his Tour de France title in 2013. However, in February he asserted that his focus for the season would be the Giro d&#x27;Italia, after which he would ride the Tour de France in support of teammate Froome. In April he let it be known that he desired to win another Tour, and had hopes of achieving the Tour and Giro double – a feat that has not been achieved since Marco Pantani in 1998.

Wiggins participated in a winter training camp in Mallorca. His first race of the season was the Tour of Oman in February. On the first stage he was caught behind a crash, the time delay pushing him back to the back of the field. For the remainder of the race Wiggins helped Froome, who won the overall classification. Wiggins opted not to defend his title at the Paris–Nice, or ride the Tirreno–Adriatico, instead participating in a training camp on Mount Teide in Tenerife. He returned to action at the Volta a Catalunya in March, finishing the race in fifth place overall, 54 seconds behind winner Dan Martin of .

In April Wiggins rode the four-day Giro del Trentino in Northern Italy as preparation for the Giro d&#x27;Italia. The first day&#x27;s race schedule consisted of a road race followed by a team time trial. An unexpected breakaway in the road race caused Wiggins to lose over six minutes. However he led the team to victory later in the day during the team time trial. On stage two he cut his deficit to race leader Maxime Bouet of in half, lifting Wiggins into the top-five overall. On the fourth and final stage Wiggins suffered a mechanical problem at the foot of the final climb. He ended up finishing the race in fifth place, one minute and 40 seconds down on winner Nibali ().

Wiggins entered the Giro d&#x27;Italia as one of the favourites for the general classification. won the stage two team time trial on the island of Ischia, covering the distance of 14 seconds quicker than Nibali&#x27;s squad. On stage four Wiggins lost 17 seconds after being delayed by a crash within the final , dropping him in the standings from second to sixth. A wet stage seven saw Wiggins crash while making a descent some from the finish, placing him in difficulty. Teammates Rigoberto Urán and Sergio Henao helped pace him back toward the leaders, but could not close the gap. Wiggins finished 90 seconds down on the race favourites, dropping him out of the race&#x27;s top 20. In the following stage, a time trial, Wiggins placed second to compatriot Alex Dowsett of . A bike change compelled by a puncture cost Wiggins some time, and he ended up finishing the race ten seconds down on Dowsett. Wiggins struggled on the wet roads of stage nine, losing touch with the peloton on the descent of the Vallombrosa some from the finish. A group of teammates helped pace him back, and the gap was closed. Following stage 11 Wiggins revealed that he was suffering from a chest infection. He withdrew from the race the following day, after losing over three minutes on the day&#x27;s stage.
The presence of a knee injury was disclosed to the public on 31 May, which forced Wiggins to forgo defending his title in the Tour de France. He subsequently suggested he may never ride the Tour again. He returned to racing at the Tour de Pologne, winning stage seven&#x27;s time trial, 56 seconds ahead of second placed Cancellara.

In September, Wiggins led at his home race, the Tour of Britain. He won the time trial on stage three on roads around Knowsley Safari Park, close to his home in Lancashire. He held the lead for the rest of the week to win the race for the first time, and take his first stage race victory of the season. The following week at the world championships, he took the silver medal in the time trial, behind winner Tony Martin and ahead of Cancellara in a repeat of the 2011 podium. Wiggins was also selected to ride the road race, but abandoned after one lap, and was soon followed by the other British riders as none finished the race.

===2014: world time trial champion and track return===
Wiggins had stated that his main targets for 2014 were the Paris–Roubaix one day Classic, the Tour of California and the road world championships, as well as riding the Tour de France in support of Chris Froome.

Wiggins rode the Tour of Flanders as a replacement for the injured Ian Stannard, and finished 32nd, one minute 43 seconds behind the winner Fabian Cancellara, having helped Geraint Thomas on his way to eighth. Wiggins contested Paris–Roubaix for the first time since 2011, becoming the first former Tour de France winner to compete at the race since Greg LeMond in 1992, and secured ninth position, his only top ten finish in a monument as part of a group twenty seconds down on race winner Niki Terpstra.

At the Tour of California, Wiggins won the time trial on stage two by a margin of 40 seconds over second placed Rohan Dennis () to move into the overall lead which he would keep for the rest of the race. Despite that good result, Wiggins was not selected by his team to be riding the Tour de France, prompting his return to the track cycling team as preparation for the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow.

At the Commonwealth Games in July, Wiggins participated in the 4000m team pursuit with Steven Burke, Ed Clancy and Andy Tennant, managing to win the silver medal. The following day Wiggins announced that he was &quot;done with the road&quot; and that he would likely never ride a grand tour again. He did not rule out some road events but wants to concentrate his training on preparation for the team pursuit at the 2016 Summer Olympics.

In September Wiggins rode the Tour of Britain, winning the final time trial in London and ending the race in third overall behind the winner, &#x27;s Dylan van Baarle, and Michał Kwiatkowski (). Wiggins then won gold in the time trial at the world road championships in Ponferrada, Spain, with a winning margin of 26 seconds over Tony Martin over the course.
===2015: Paris–Roubaix, WIGGINS and hour record===
In January 2015 it was confirmed that Wiggins had signed a contract extension with Team Sky to the end of April 2015, with a focus on attempting to win Paris–Roubaix, before transferring to his newly founded team in order to prepare alongside other members of the British track endurance squad for the team pursuit at the 2016 Summer Olympics. It was also confirmed that he would attempt to break the hour record in 2015. In March he confirmed that he would make his debut with his eponymous team at the inaugural Tour de Yorkshire at the start of May.

Early in the season, Wiggins rode the Tour of Qatar, in which he lost out on contention for the general classification after being caught out by a split in the peloton and then finished third in the race&#x27;s individual time trial stage behind Cancellara and Niki Terpstra, his first opportunity to wear his rainbow skinsuit. Wiggins then took part in the traditional opening race of the classics season, Omloop Het Nieuwsblad, finishing 44th as his teammate Ian Stannard took victory.

Wiggins returned to Paris–Nice, a race he had won in 2012. The race opened and closed with time-trials; Wiggins finished 12th in the prologue, did not feature in the following five stages, often riding at the back of the peloton, and then withdrew before the traditional mountain time-trial up the Col d&#x27;Èze, a stage for which Wiggins holds the fastest ever time, a legacy of his 2012 victory there. Again, his teammate Richie Porte was victorious in the race.
Wiggins was set to ride E3 Harelbeke in March, a return to the cobbled classics in the lead up to his main objective of Paris–Roubaix, but withdrew. Instead he rode Gent–Wevelgem two days later; however, he abandoned the race, which was hit by severe weather conditions with much heavy wind and rain, and only 39 riders finished the race. During the mid-week Three Days of De Panne, which began on 31 March, Wiggins acted as a lead-out man of Sky&#x27;s sprinter, Elia Viviani, and then convincingly won the final stage&#x27;s short time trial, expected to be his last in Sky colours, which also gave him 3rd place overall in the race.

At Paris–Roubaix, Wiggins&#x27;s much publicised last race with Sky and primary goal of the early season, he finished in 18th position. He attacked with left to race, but was reabsorbed by the peloton. A few days after the race it was announced that Wiggins would make his bid to break the hour record on 7 June at Lee Valley VeloPark. He participated to the Tour de Yorkshire with WIGGINS Team, but did not register a significant result. A few weeks after leaving Team Sky, Wiggins said he felt &quot;liberated&quot; and &quot;happier&quot;. On 7 June 2015 Wiggins broke the hour record, riding , surpassing Dowsett&#x27;s mark of , set five weeks earlier, by more than 3%.

Roubaix, his first top-ten finish in a &#x27;monument&#x27; classic, effectively marked the end of Wiggin&#x27;s elite road career. That career was unusually brief by professional standard; his unexpectedly high finish in 2009 Tour de France led to his high-profile transfer to Team Sky for the following year, and a difficult first season. From 2011 through 2015, however, he had a remarkable run of successes including world and Olympic time trial titles, a Tour de France title and podium place in the Vuelta a Espana in 2011, and wins in almost all the major one week stage races between 2011 and 2013, including a Paris-Nice and two Criteriums du Dauphine, becoming the first man to win a treble of the Paris-Nice, the Dauphine and the Tour du Romandie, and the Tour de France in one season during his annus mirabilis in 2012. By 2014, however, he had already been eclipsed by his super -domestique Chris Froome in the Sky pecking order, incentivizing his return to the track in time for one last run at the Olympic Games and a fifth Olympic gold medal.

On 16 August, Wiggins joined Cavendish on the track for the first time since the 2008 Olympics, winning the Madison in the first round of the Revolution cycling series at the newly opened Derby Velodrome. In October Wiggins took his first gold medal at the European track championships when he was part of the British squad that won the team pursuit.

===2016: fifth Olympic gold and retirement===
Wiggins competed at the world championships in London, where he took two medals: in the team pursuit, he was part of the British squad that qualified for the final, where they took the silver behind Australia despite leading with 500 metres to go and going on to set the fastest time in competition by a British quartet since 2012. However Wiggins said that he was happy with his performance, stating &quot;that (was) the strongest I&#x27;ve been in a team pursuit, so there&#x27;s a bit of life left in me yet, and I&#x27;ve got another four or five months to get a bit better&quot;. Subsequently, he raced with Cavendish in the madison, where they clinched their second world title in the discipline as a pairing using similar tactics to their 2008 win: accumulating points in the sprints in the early stages of the race, before making up a one lap deficit on their French, Colombian and Swiss rivals by working with the Spanish pairing of Sebastián Mora and Albert Torres in a breakaway, taking the lead and holding on for the win despite Cavendish crashing with 11 laps to go.

Through the spring of 2016 Wiggins focused on training for the Olympics, limiting his road racing to a small number of events, finishing low down the placings in all of them. As part of a five-man squad for the team pursuit, Wiggins was reported to be breaking world records in Olympic training, despite apparent disagreements between Wiggins and Cavendish, who was nominated as the squad&#x27;s fifth rider in order to allow him to enter the omnium at the games. The team pursuit squad achieved the fastest time in qualification for the tournament, before reaching the final with a world record time in a victory against New Zealand. In the final, Great Britain defeated Australia to bring Wiggins his eighth Olympic medal, and his fifth gold. Subsequently, Wiggins announced his plan to retire after the Six Days of Ghent in November. He plans to expand his activities in supporting and running Team Wiggins, including an aim to create a women&#x27;s team. In his penultimate racing event, the Six Days of London, Wiggins placed second overall with Cavendish, before the pair won his final event, the Six Days of Ghent. After the event, Wiggins confirmed that this had been his last race as a team with Cavendish, but that he may go back on his decision to retire, in the right circumstances. However, on 28 December 2016 he announced that he was retiring from professional cycling saying &quot;2016 is the end of the road for this chapter, onwards and upwards, &#x27;feet on the ground, head in the clouds&#x27; kids from Kilburn don&#x27;t win Olympic Golds and Tour de Frances! They do now.&quot;

==Controversy around therapeutic use exemptions==
The leaking of his personal medical history by a group of hackers called Fancy Bear, in September 2016, raised questions about Wiggins&#x27;s use of therapeutic use exemptions (TUEs), which allow athletes with certified medical conditions to take banned substances so as to allow them to compete with healthy athletes.

The leaked files show that he received six TUEs during his career for substances which are otherwise banned by WADA. In 2008, he was granted TUEs for salbutamol (which has since been legalised), formoterol and budesonide to treat asthma. Wiggins later received three intramuscular injections of the drug triamcinolone, a powerful corticosteroid. Triamcinolone is a banned substance because it allows riders to lose weight while maintaining power. The injections were administered to treat hayfever shortly before the 2011 and 2012 Tour de France races, and the 2013 Giro d&#x27;Italia.

Dr. Jeroen Swart, the South Africa-based exercise physiologist who oversaw Chris Froome&#x27;s independent physiological testing, has suggested that the 2012 injection of triamcinolone ahead of Wiggins&#x27;s historic Tour de France victory may have been administered as a preventive measure, rather than to treat existing symptoms, even though it is not a first-line therapy.

Whilst the use of banned performance-enhancing substances under TUEs is permitted by the sporting authorities provided the exemption was granted in terms of the WADA rules, questions have been raised about the in-competition use of such drugs. Dr Jeroen Swart questioned the choice of medication, the timing of the injections, the presence of disgraced doctor Geert Leinders on Wiggins&#x27;s team at the time, and the fact that Wiggins said in his 2012 autobiography &quot;My Time&quot; that he had only ever received injections for immunisations and some drips.

Prentice Steffen, who was team doctor at when Wiggins rode for the team in 2009, said in a 2016 interview with the BBC that he was &quot;surprised&quot; that Wiggins was granted TUEs for the injection of triamcinolone immediately before three Grand Tours, that the decision by the team to apply for these TUEs was &quot;questionable&quot;, and that he felt they should not have been granted. Wiggins has denied that Geert Leinders had any direct involvement in his taking of the TUE drugs.

===Jiffy-bag scandal===

UK Anti-Doping (UKAD), an independent body which is responsible for planning and implementing anti-doping programs in UK sport, began a 14-month investigation in 2016 into the contents of a padded mailing bag which was delivered to Team Sky at the 2011 Critérium du Dauphiné for Wiggins&#x27;s use. In November 2017, it found that there was insufficient evidence to conclude that the bag had contained a banned substance. UKAD reached its conclusion because of insufficient and lost medical records within British Cycling and Team Sky.

The package was collected from British Cycling&#x27;s office in Manchester by the British Cycling women&#x27;s manager, Simon Cope, on the request of Shane Sutton, then the technical director for British Cycling. Cope carried the package on a flight to Geneva, after which he drove to meet Richard Freeman, the British Cycling doctor who administered the drug to Wiggins. Cope denied knowing what was in the package.

UKAD began its investigation in 2016 following a tip-off that the bag delivered to Wiggins contained the banned corticosteroid triamcinolone, which allows riders to lose weight while maintaining power. UKAD&#x27;s investigation was hindered by Freeman, who was too ill to give evidence to the inquiry. Freeman had also failed to upload medical records as required, and later reported that his laptop had been stolen while on holiday. He had since resigned from British Cycling. The head of Ukad, Nicole Sapstead, had testified to parliament that there were no records of British Cycling purchasing Fluimucil in the UK. She told the MPs that British Cycling had however purchased significant amounts of triamcinolone, a corticosteroid generally banned in sport, which Wiggins is known to have used in other cases under a TUE.

In December 2016 Sir Dave Brailsford, who ran British Cycling and Team Sky in 2011, informed the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport select committee that the package contained Fluimucil, a brand of legal expectorant, available over-the-counter at chemists in France without a prescription. Nigel Huddleston MP said it was &quot;extraordinary&quot; that a select committee was required for this simple fact to emerge, and he questioned &quot;the transparency, communication and governance of UK cycling&quot;.

UK Anti-Doping closed its investigation into the package after being unable to find evidence that it contained a banned substance. It released a statement which said that its investigation had been hampered by the lack of availability of detailed medical records. Parts of the investigation remain open, as Ukad has not yet been able to establish why products containing testosterone were delivered to the national cycling centre.

Damian Collins MP, the chairman of the select committee, said that the decision was &quot;not an exoneration of anyone&quot;, and that &quot;If Sky and British Cycling had kept proper medical records, this could have been wrapped up a lot sooner. It is unacceptable. A cloud now hangs over one of our greatest Olympians.&quot;

Wiggins has always denied any wrongdoing on his part, and has described the investigation as a &quot;malicious witch-hunt&quot;.

The Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee made two major findings against Wiggins in a report released in March 2018. The committee believed Team Sky used the drug triamcinolone to &quot;enhance the performances of riders and not just to treat medical need&quot;. The committee noted that there is no written evidence to substantiate a claim by Team Sky boss David Brailsford that the &quot;jiffy-bag&quot; contained Fluimucil. The committee stated that Team Sky doctor Richard Freeman, who had originally failed to record Wiggins&#x27;s use of medical products, could no longer confirm that the contents of the bag were Fluimucil. It also noted that Freeman was &quot;the only reported source of this information.&quot;

===Report of the House of Commons Committee for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport===
On 5 March 2018, the British House of Commons Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee published their report called &quot;Combatting doping in sport&quot;. Their inquiry spanned the work of two committees, and started in August 2015. Among other things, the committee looked into doping in cycling, in response to the Fancy Bear hacking into the database of WADA and their publication of Therapeutic Use Exemption certificates (TUEs) issued to Bradley Wiggins in 2011, 2012 and 2013. They specifically inquired into the medication used at that time by Wiggins and Team Sky. In their conclusions, in paragraph 110, they state as follows:

The committee noted in its report that there is no written evidence to substantiate a claim by Team Sky boss David Brailsford that the &quot;jiffy-bag&quot; couriered to Team Sky at the 2011 Critérium du Dauphiné for Wiggins&#x27;s use contained Fluimucil, a legal expectorant used for clearing mucus in case of chronic bronchitis, else as antidote in case of paracetamol overdose. The committee now says that Team Sky doctor Richard Freeman, who had failed to properly record Wiggins&#x27;s use of medical products, can no longer confirm it was in fact Fluimucil. They also noted that Freeman was &quot;the only reported source of this information.&quot;
The BBC called the report &quot;A devastating blow to the reputations of some of the biggest names in British sport&quot;, and The Irish Times reported that Wiggins&#x27;s Tour de France win is now in question. The Guardian wrote that: &quot;It is only three months since we were last asking whether the latest crisis would signal the end for Team Sky. Now here we are again, wondering how much longer this organisation can continue when every scintilla of credibility they had as a completely clean team has been decimated by another inquiry.&quot;

Wiggins and Team Sky have continued to deny that any drugs were used without medical need.

==Personal life==

===Family===
Wiggins was married to Catherine (&quot;née&quot; Cockram), whom he met during the 2002 Commonwealth Games, after first meeting as juniors in 1997; they have two children together, Ben and Isabella. Ben is also a racing cyclist, who has enjoyed success at the junior level, including winning the points race title at the 2022 European Track Championships and taking the silver medal in the time trial at the 2023 Road World Championships. Their family lived in Eccleston, Lancashire. In May 2020, it was announced that Wiggins and his wife had separated.

Wiggins endured a difficult relationship with his father Gary Wiggins, who made no effort to contact Bradley for 14 years, since leaving the family when Bradley was two years old. Bradley only knew his father had been a professional cyclist. Their first meeting was in 1999, when Bradley was at a training camp in Australia; also meeting his two half-sisters from relationships his father had in Australia before and after the one with his mother. They next met the following year, when Bradley was back in Australia training and had gone out three weeks in advance to stay with Gary. Bradley quickly became disillusioned at his father&#x27;s alcohol and drug problems, and they never met again. Gary Wiggins died in Aberdeen, New South Wales in 2008, aged 55. Bradley did not attend the funeral.

===Interests===
Wiggins is a well-known mod and owns a collection of classic motor scooters and guitars from the 1960s and 1970s. He is a keen musician and guitarist and in December 2012 he made a surprise appearance at a Paul Weller charity concert, playing guitar on &quot;That&#x27;s Entertainment&quot;; and together recorded a special for BBC Radio 6 Music discussing their love of music and mod culture, broadcast on Boxing Day. He supports Liverpool Football Club and Wigan Warriors rugby league club, and in 2012 the latter gave him a life membership, which he described as his highlight of the year. Wiggins presented the winner of the Super League&#x27;s 2012 Man of Steel Award to the Warriors player Sam Tomkins.

In July 2012 it was announced that Wiggins would collaborate with the Fred Perry clothing label &quot;to develop an authentic, non-technical range of cycle wear&quot;. The clothing range, known as the Bradley Wiggins X Fred Perry Collaboration, was launched in July 2012 under a six-year contract.

In 2012 Wiggins launched the Bradley Wiggins Foundation to draw people into sport and regular exercise. The foundation backed the professional women&#x27;s team , which launched for the 2013 season. However, in February 2015 Wiggins announced that the Foundation would be wound down in the run-up to the 2016 Olympics.

In August 2019, Wiggins announced his intention to become a social worker after enrolling for a degree at the Open University. He said that his upbringing, in Kilburn, London, gave him a &quot;mental toughness&quot; that would be helpful in supporting others. He also said that he doesn&#x27;t &quot;give a shit&quot; about his cycling career and that he is &quot;detached from it&quot;.

===Personal and financial problems===

In a period after the 2004 Olympics, Wiggins started to drink heavily as he struggled to cope with his newfound fame. He stopped when his son Ben was born.

In July 2020, the High Court in London dismissed a bankruptcy petition brought against Wiggins for unpaid tax by the HMRC, after Wiggins managed to make an agreement with HMRC representatives for payment of tax. In October 2020, it was reported that Wiggins had wound up his cycling team, Team Wiggins, with £1m-plus debts. Wiggins had invested a considerable amount of his personal wealth into the enterprise, but it proved unsustainable due the lack of commercial partners. Although it was reported at the time that the winding up of Wiggins&#x27; cycling firms did not affect Wiggins&#x27; personal solvency, Wiggins&#x27; financial troubles started to attract media attention in the coming years. 

In November 2023, it was reported that Wiggins was at risk of facing bankruptcy proceedings as the liquidators of his company revealed that a claim against him for nearly £1m has still not been paid. It later emerged that Wiggins had entered into an individual voluntary arrangement in 2020, to try to avoid bankruptcy. In January 2024, Wiggins failed his IVA, and bankruptcy proceedings were initiated against him. 

Wiggins was declared bankrupt at Lancaster County Court on June 3. Wiggins was reported to be &#x27;homeless&#x27; and sleeping at various addresses, including his ex-wife&#x27;s house. It was reported that Wiggins&#x27; dire financial situation may force him to sell his Olympic medals. Wiggins himself was reported to be &#x27;embarrassed&#x27; by his financial predicament, and its becoming public.

===Other===
At the 2012 Olympics, Wiggins rang the Olympic Bell to mark the start of the opening ceremony inside the Olympic Stadium.

Wiggins has written a number of books about his career. The first, entitled &quot;In Pursuit of Glory&quot;, was published in 2008 and covers his success as a track cyclist up to the Beijing Olympics. It was updated in 2009 to include his 2009 Tour de France fourth place (later updated to third). &quot;On Tour&quot; was published in 2010 and covers that year&#x27;s Tour de France. Following his success at the 2012 Tour de France he published &quot;The Bradley Wiggins Opus&quot;. That same year he also published &quot;My Time&quot; which largely deals with the 2012 Tour de France and Olympics. &quot;My Story&quot; was published in 2013 and is an edited version of &quot;My Time&quot; for younger readers. In 2015 he added &quot;My Hour&quot; which tells of his successful attempt at the Hour record. In 2018 he added a seventh book, &quot;Icons&quot;, which details some of the riders who inspired him.

Wiggins&#x27;s power output has been measured to be over 450 watts at anaerobic threshold.

In March 2014 Wiggins made an appearance as himself in an episode of BBC Radio 4&#x27;s soap opera &quot;The Archers&quot; as part of the &quot;Sport Relief&quot; charitable appeal. Two years later he appeared in a comedy sketch filmed at the London Olympic Velodrome with Michael Crawford on Sport Relief 2016 where Crawford reprised his &quot;Some Mothers Do &#x27;Ave &#x27;Em&quot; character Frank Spencer.

A sculpture dedicated to and inspired by Wiggins was unveiled in 2014 at St Augustine&#x27;s CE High School, his former school.

On 5 January 2017 it was announced that Wiggins would be a contestant on the Channel 4 winter sports reality television programme &quot;The Jump&quot;. However he was forced to withdraw from the show during the second week when he fractured his leg during training.

In June 2017 Wiggins revealed that he had taken up rowing on a serious basis after initially using it as a means to keep fit, with fellow Olympic champion James Cracknell as his coach. He stated that he was planning to compete in the British Indoor Rowing Championships in December of the same year with a view to competing at the 2020 Summer Olympics. He competed in the elite 2000m at the Championships, finishing 21st in a time of 6:22.5 after a slow start due to mistakenly believing that the race had false started.

In 2018 Wiggins launched &quot;The Bradley Wiggins Show&quot;, a cycle racing podcast produced in association with Eurosport, for a series of four episodes covering that year&#x27;s Tour de France. The series received over a million downloads, and the show was renewed for a 20-episode run the following year, featuring discussion of the spring classics, Grand Tours and Road World Championships. He also took up punditry work for the channel in 2019, providing studio-based analysis for the Giro d&#x27;Italia before acting as a motorbike-mounted reporter for the Tour de France.

In July 2019 Comedy Central announced that it had approved the production of five episodes of &quot;Gods of the Game&quot;, a half-hour gameshow to be hosted by Wiggins featuring members of the public competing against elite sportspeople, including Mo Farah, Chris Hoy, Rebecca Adlington, Nicola Adams and Tim Henman, in &quot;comedy versions&quot; of their sports. Wiggins co-presented the programme with Tom Rosenthal. In a review of the show, Stuart Heritage of &quot;The Guardian&quot; wrote that &quot;&quot;Gods of the Game&quot; is shooting for high-concept absurdity, but for the most part it falls short and only manages to be slightly diverting&quot;.

Wiggins said in an interview with &quot;Men&#x27;s Health&quot; in 2022 that he had been groomed sexually by a cycling coach when he was 13. He said that he could not tell his stepfather about the abuse, because his stepfather was violent towards him. In May 2023 Wiggins revealed the name of the abuser.

<text>Eugen Barbu (; 20 February 1924 – 7 September 1993) was a Romanian modern novelist, short story writer, journalist, and correspondent member of the Romanian Academy. The latter position was vehemently criticized by those who contended that he plagiarized in his novel &quot;Incognito&quot; and for the anti-Semitic campaigns he initiated in the newspapers &quot;Săptămâna&quot; and &quot;România Mare&quot; which he founded and led. He also founded, alongside his disciple Corneliu Vadim Tudor, the nationalist Greater Romania Party (PRM).

His most famous writings are the novels &quot;Groapa&quot; (1957) and &quot;Principele&quot; (1969). Barbu&#x27;s prose, in which the influence of neorealism has been noted, drew comparison to the works of Mateiu Caragiale, Tudor Arghezi, and Curzio Malaparte. It was however, considered unequal by several critics, who took into measure Barbu&#x27;s preference for archaisms, as well as his fluctuating narrative style.

Barbu also wrote several film scripts, some of which were for films starring his wife, the actress Marga Barbu (Florin Piersic&#x27;s &quot;Mărgelatu&quot; series).

==Biography==

===Early life and literature===
The son of writer and journalist N. Crevedia, Barbu was born in Bucharest, and briefly attended the University of Bucharest&#x27;s Faculty of Law, and then graduated from the Faculty of Letters (1947); he subsequently worked as a journalist for the left-wing press. Attending meetings of the &quot;Sburătorul&quot; society, he made his debut in 1955 (with the novella &quot;Munca de jos&quot;). The following year, he published his first novel, &quot;Balonul e rotund&quot;.

One of the few persons trusted with official criticism on both political and literary issues during the communist regime — under Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej, and especially under Nicolae Ceaușescu — he was noted for his early writings in praise of Soviet achievements such as the Sputnik program, and his progressive move to a more nationalist tone as this became condoned (and later encouraged). He was also involved in the censorship apparatus, a position which, some have argued, he used indiscriminately against his literary rivals.

===Official appointments===
His &quot;Principele&quot; novel, set during the Phanariote era, was interpreted to be an ironic reference to Gheorghiu-Dej&#x27;s rule and the labor camps of the Danube–Black Sea Canal, and was condoned by the regime during a period of relative liberalization — cut short by the &quot;July Theses&quot; of 1971. At the time, he was also an editor of &quot;Luceafărul&quot;, before being dismissed following his prolonged and notorious conflicts with younger writers (while the regime was interested in ensuring the latter&#x27;s confidence). Barbu was an informal envoy to the United States during the late 1960s, visiting the influential exiled scholar Mircea Eliade at his home in Chicago, unsuccessfully calling for his return, and vouching for a &quot;magnificent reception&quot; to his home country (in order to mark the potential image coup).

He was several times elected to the Great National Assembly, until the plagiarism scandal prevented him from being again proposed for the office. In 1977, Barbu won the Herder Prize, which permitted him to offer his protégé Tudor a scholarship year in Vienna.

===Plagiarism scandal and &quot;Săptămâna&quot;===
In 1979, &quot;România Literară&quot; published a special section in which it placed side by side a text from &quot;Incognito&quot; and one taken from a translated work by the Soviet writer Konstantin Paustovsky; the two sections were considered virtually identical. The ensuing scandal animated the literary world, and has often been cited as a reference for similar and more recent controversies. Speaking at the time, Barbu dismissed the accusations as character assassination.

During the 1970s and &#x27;80s, he notably launched verbal attacks against Romanian intellectuals who had defected the country, as well as against writers who were critical of the regime (the latter included Paul Goma, whom, in 1977, he called &quot;a non-entity&quot;).

Barbu&#x27;s polemic articles were often obscene in tone, and their message offered Ceauşescu a nationalist support which Vladimir Tismăneanu has identified as &quot;chauvinistic&quot;. By 1980, Tudor&#x27;s editorials in &quot;Săptămâna&quot; drew complaints from members of the Jewish-Romanian community; consequently, Barbu and Tudor came under the attention of the Securitate. According to &quot;Ziua&quot;, a Securitate file of the time reveals that the two had begun questioning the &quot;détente&quot; between Romania and the United States, contradicting official policy, and theorizing that the Most favored nation status, which Romania had just received, was actually harming the country (while arguing that data to prove this had been kept hidden by a Jewish plot).

Many attacks focused on Monica Lovinescu, who was broadcasting anti-communist messages on Radio Free Europe — in one instance during 1987, Barbu used his column in &quot;Săptămâna&quot; to belittle the work of Eugen Lovinescu, a major literary critic who was Monica Lovinescu&#x27;s father; this drew criticism from the Romanian Communist Party (of which Barbu was a member) and alarm from the Securitate, as it went against more restrained official guidelines regarding the works of Eugen Lovinescu.

===Post-Revolution===
After the Romanian Revolution of 1989, Barbu and Tudor emerged as ideologists of a new nationalist trend, which largely repeated themes present in previous official discourse, while casting aside references to communism. Between 1992 and the time of his death, Barbu served in the Romanian Chamber of Deputies as representative of the Greater Romania Party for Bucharest.

In early 2005, eleven years after his death, the satirical magazine &quot;Academia Cațavencu&quot; uncovered and publicized a Securitate file which seems to indicate that Barbu had sexual encounters with underage girls, provided by Tudor and paid for their services. Tudor initially called on the National Council for the Study of the Securitate Archives to explain if the find was real, and received a positive answer. He later vehemently dismissed the allegations, indicating that virtually all of the girls&#x27; personal data was not found in census records, and that Anita Barton, the only one of them to have actually been found, was aged 19 at the time of her alleged meeting with Barbu.

He died in Bucharest in 1993 and was buried at Bellu Cemetery, on Writer&#x27;s Alley, close to Mihai Eminescu&#x27;s resting place. His wife, Marga Barbu, was buried next to him when she died in 2009.

<doc id="929678" wikidata="Q1506195" url="?curid=929678" title="The Six Bullerby Children">
<text>Books by Astrid Lindgren featuring the Six Bullerby Children (in the US released as The Children of Noisy Village):

* &quot;All About the Bullerby Children&quot;
* &quot;Cherry Time at Bullerby&quot;
* &quot;Six Bullerby Children&quot;
* &quot;Springtime at Bullerby&quot;

It was originally published in 1947 in Sweden. It has since been translated into 39 languages and published in many countries including the United States and the United Kingdom.
These books are about six children living in a tiny, remote village in Sweden and are set in the late 1930s, a relatively calm time in Sweden, although a war &quot;starting soon&quot; is sometimes briefly mentioned in newspapers the children are reading. The agricultural world is still in a pre-industrial state (no tractors or harvesters) and the arrival of a car is a big event, because the road ends there. School and shops are available in Storby, the large village nearby.

The narrator is a young girl named Lisa; she tells about her life and adventures in the small and neat Swedish village Bullerby. The village consists of three lined up houses in which live seven children with their parents and housekeepers: Lisa with her older brothers Lasse and Bosse, the siblings Britta and Anna, as well as Olle with his younger sister Kerstin.

Bullerby is represented by the small village of Sevedstorp where Lindgren&#x27;s father grew up (10 miles from her hometown of Vimmerby and the village of Näs, where she was born).

==Films==
* 1960 – &quot;Alla vi barn i Bullerbyn&quot; (television), directed by Olle Hellbom
* 1986 – &quot;The Children of Noisy Village&quot;, directed by Lasse Hallström
* 1987 – &quot;More About the Children of Noisy Village&quot;, directed by Lasse Hallström

The television series from 1960 was also re-edited into two feature films, &quot;Alla vi barn i Bullerbyn&quot; (1960) and &quot;Bara roligt i Bullerbyn&quot; (1961). The two films by Lasse Hallström were reworked into a seven-episode TV-series, titled &quot;Alla vi barn i Bullerbyn&quot;, that was broadcast in 1989. Some scenes in the film adaptations were shot in the small hamlet Stensjö by in Småland.

<text>Patricia Noriko Miranda (born June 11, 1979 in Manteca, California) is a former American collegiate wrestler. She became the first American woman in Olympic history to receive a medal in woman&#x27;s Olympic wrestling, winning the bronze at the 2004 Summer Olympics in the 48 kg or 106 lb weight class.

As the daughter of political refugees from Brazil, Miranda began her wrestling career at age eleven by becoming the first female to wrestle at Redwood Middle School and Saratoga High School. Her father initially opposed her wrestling and once threatened to sue her high school for allowing his daughter to wrestle on the boys&#x27; team. He eventually allowed her to wrestle as long as she maintained a 4.0 grade point average.

She continued wrestling at Stanford University and eventually earned a spot on the all-male NCAA Division 1 roster as a 125-pound starter. During her senior year, Miranda became only the second woman in NCAA history to beat a male opponent in competition and the first in more than a decade to do so at the time. In female competition, Miranda has had strong success including two World Championship silver medals and an Olympic bronze medal.

Miranda earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree in Economics and a Master’s in International Policy Studies from Stanford University. In 2005, she won a highly competitive The Paul &amp; Daisy Soros Fellowships for New Americans to help support her graduate studies in law. In 2007, she received her Juris Doctor from Yale Law School. Her coach and husband, Levi Weikel-Magden, is also a law school graduate, earning his degree at the University of Virginia. She is currently a partner at Miranda, Magden &amp; Miranda LLP.

<doc id="929695" wikidata="Q1500349" url="?curid=929695" title="Karlsson-on-the-Roof">
<text>Karlsson-on-the-Roof () is a character who features in a series of children&#x27;s books by the Swedish author Astrid Lindgren. Lindgren may have borrowed the idea for the series from a similar story about Mr. O&#x27;Malley in the comic strip &quot;Barnaby&quot; (1942) by Crockett Johnson.

==Plot==
&quot;Karlsson&quot; is a very short, plump, and overconfident man who lives in a small house hidden behind a chimney on the roof of &quot;a very ordinary apartment building on a very ordinary street&quot; in Vasastan, Stockholm. When Karlsson pushes a button on his stomach, it starts a clever little engine with a propeller on his back, allowing him to fly.

In his own opinion, Karlsson is the best at everything. He befriends Svante Svantesson, a seven-year-old boy and youngest member of the Svantesson family, who is often referred to as &quot;Little Brother&quot;, .

Karlsson is quite mischievous and likes to make fun and prank others. He often gets Lillebror into trouble, as Karlsson usually disappears just before Lillebror&#x27;s family arrives leaving him to deal with consequences of Karlsson&#x27;s actions. 

At first, parents, siblings and friends of Lillebror don&#x27;t believe that Karlsson is real, and consider him to be an imaginary friend, but after they meet him in person they begin to like the little flying man.

Another character to encounter Karlsson is &quot;Fröken Bock&quot; (Miss Hildur Bock), a strict nanny who undergoes an emotional transformation after meeting Karlsson.

== Development ==
Karlsson&#x27;s predecessor is Mr. Lilyvale (). Mr. Lilyvale was a small, flying, friendly old man, and fantasy friend of Lindgren&#x27;s daughter Karin. In the evening he visited her in her room. Lindgren&#x27;s daughter explained that Mr. Lilyvale could not be seen by anyone else because he flew away or hid as soon as someone entered the room. Astrid Lindgren wrote the book &quot;In the Land of Twilight&quot; about Mr. Lilyvale. At that time, Mr. Lilyvale was friendlier, less selfish, bossy or self-centered. He also had no propeller. According to Astrid Lindgren, Mr. Lilyvale later turned into Karlsson.

==Characters==

==Cultural impact and adaptations==
Translated books and cartoon adaptation of the series became popular in the Soviet Union. &quot;Lillebror&quot; has been changed to (), which means &quot;Junior&quot; or &quot;Little boy&quot;. Other characters&#x27; names have not been changed.

The two Soviet animated films &quot;Junior and Karlson&quot; (1968) and &quot;Karlson Returns&quot; (1970), directed by Boris Stepantsev at Soyuzmultfilm studio are among the most celebrated and loved cartoons in Russia and other formerly Soviet countries. Karlsson was voiced by Vasily Livanov and Junior by Klara Rumyanova in both animated films, while Fröken Bock was voiced by Faina Ranevskaya in the second film. In 1971, the character was also adapted for the stage at the Moscow Satire Theatre, where Karlsson was portrayed by Spartak Mishulin.

A live-action version, &quot;Världens bästa Karlsson&quot;, was released in Sweden in 1974, as was an animated film in 2002.

A Ukrainian military unit during the Russian invasion of Ukraine named itself after Karlsson-on-the-Roof and took the name &quot;Karlsson-on-the-Roof Battalion&quot;.

<doc id="929697" wikidata="Q7302473" url="?curid=929697" title="Reciprocal socialization">
<text>Reciprocal socialization &quot;is a socialization process that is bidirectional; children socialize parents just as parents socialize children&quot;. For example, the interaction of mothers and their infants is sometimes symbolized as a dance or dialogue in which following actions of the partners are closely coordinated. This coordinated dance or dialogue can assume the form of mutual synchrony, or it can be reciprocal in a more precise sense. The actions of the partners can be matched, as when one partner imitates the other or when there is mutual smiling.

When reciprocal socialization has been investigated in infancy, mutual gaze or eye contact has been found to play an important role in early social interaction. &quot;In one investigation, the mother and infant engaged in a variety of behaviors while they looked at each other; by contrast, when they looked away from each other, the rate of such behaviors dropped considerably&quot;.

&quot;In short, the behaviors of mothers and infants involve substantial interconnection and synchronization. And in some investigations, synchrony in parent-child relationships was positively related to children’s social competence.
One example of parental response to children’s behavior is the elicitation of scaffolding behavior, which in turn affects the level of behavior children show in the future. Scaffolding refers to parental behavior that serves to support children’s efforts, allowing them to be more skillful than they would if they relied only on their own abilities. For example, in the game peek-a-boo, parents initially cover their babies, then remove the covering, and finally register &quot;surprise&quot; at the babies&#x27; reappearance. As infants become more skilled at peek-a-boo, infants gradually do some of the covering and uncovering. Parents try to time their actions in such a way that the infant takes turns with the parent. In addition to peek-a-boo, pat-a-cake and &quot;so-big&quot; are other caregiver games that exemplify scaffolding and turn-taking sequences. Scaffolding can be used to support children&#x27;s efforts at any age&quot;. &quot;In one investigation, infants who had more extensive scaffolding experiences with their parents, especially in the form of turn taking, were more likely to engage in turn taking as they interacted with their peers&quot;.

Note: Studies concerning the relationship of culture and reciprocal socialization could not be found.

<text>Lučenec (; ; ; ; ) is a town in the Banská Bystrica Region of south-central Slovakia. Historically, it was part, and in the 18th century the capital, of Nógrád County of the Kingdom of Hungary. In 1920, as a result of the Treaty of Trianon, it became a part of Czechoslovakia. The town has a large synagogue, built in 1924, which served a large Jewish population before World War II. The synagogue underwent renovations in 2016.

Lučenec is the economic centre of the whole Novohrad region, which includes districts Poltár and Veľký Krtíš.

==History==
Lučenec and its surroundings were inhabited in the Stone Ages. Slavs moved to this area in the 6th and 7th century as the first permanent settlers and the Hungarians joined them in the 10th century.

The first indirect mention of Lučenec was in 1128, when Lambert built a chapel in honour of Virgin Mary. The first direct mention of the settlement was in 1247 under the name &quot;Luchunch&quot;, but until the first half of the 15th century it was only a village, and was located off the main trade routes. In 1442, Lučenec was conquered by the Hussites troops under command of John Jiskra of Brandýs and in 1451 the Battle of Lučenec took place near the village between the troops of John Hunyadi and those of Jiskra, where the latter emerged victorious.

After the fall of the Fiľakovo (, ) castle in 1554, Lučenec was under the control of the Ottomans and their vassals as part of Budin Eyalet until capturing by Austrians in 1593. It was regained by Ottomans in 1596 and was again part of &quot;Filek&quot; (Ottoman name for Fiľakovo) sanjak (its centre was in modern-day Rimavská Sobota) in Eğri Eyalet till 1686. The town was burned down many times until the first half of the 19th century, when during the Revolutions of 1848/1849 it was occupied by the Russian imperial troops.

The town underwent modernization in the 19th and 20th centuries, for example, new industries like brickworks or tanneries were built, telegraph line in 1865, and in 1871 it was connected to the railway connecting Budapest () and Žilina. Before the establishment of independent Czechoslovakia in 1918, Lučenec was part of Nógrád County within the Kingdom of Hungary. In 1919, it was briefly part of the Slovak Soviet Republic. In 1938, Lučenec was annexed to Hungary as a result of the First Vienna Award, and this lasted until 1945 when it was returned to Czechoslovakia. Approximately 8.3% of current residents are ethnic Hungarians.

<text>A Friedman number is an integer, which represented in a given numeral system, is the result of a non-trivial expression using all its own digits in combination with any of the four basic arithmetic operators (+, −, ×, ÷), additive inverses, parentheses, exponentiation, and concatenation. Here, non-trivial means that at least one operation besides concatenation is used. Leading zeros cannot be used, since that would also result in trivial Friedman numbers, such as 024 = 20 + 4. For example, 347 is a Friedman number in the decimal numeral system, since 347 = 73 + 4. The decimal Friedman numbers are:

:25, 121, 125, 126, 127, 128, 153, 216, 289, 343, 347, 625, 688, 736, 1022, 1024, 1206, 1255, 1260, 1285, 1296, 1395, 1435, 1503, 1530, 1792, 1827, 2048, 2187, 2349, 2500, 2501, 2502, 2503, 2504, 2505, 2506, 2507, 2508, 2509, 2592, 2737, 2916, ... .

Friedman numbers are named after Erich Friedman, a now-retired mathematics professor at Stetson University and recreational mathematics enthusiast.

A Friedman prime is a Friedman number that is also prime. The decimal Friedman primes are:

:127, 347, 2503, 12101, 12107, 12109, 15629, 15641, 15661, 15667, 15679, 16381, 16447, 16759, 16879, 19739, 21943, 27653, 28547, 28559, 29527, 29531, 32771, 32783, 35933, 36457, 39313, 39343, 43691, 45361, 46619, 46633, 46643, 46649, 46663, 46691, 48751, 48757, 49277, 58921, 59051, 59053, 59263, 59273, 64513, 74353, 74897, 78163, 83357, ... .

==Results in base 10==
The expressions of the first few Friedman numbers are:

A nice Friedman number is a Friedman number where the digits in the expression can be arranged to be in the same order as in the number itself. For example, we can arrange 127 = 27 − 1 as 127 = −1 + 27. The first nice Friedman numbers are:

:127, 343, 736, 1285, 2187, 2502, 2592, 2737, 3125, 3685, 3864, 3972, 4096, 6455, 11264, 11664, 12850, 13825, 14641, 15552, 15585, 15612, 15613, 15617, 15618, 15621, 15622, 15623, 15624, 15626, 15632, 15633, 15642, 15645, 15655, 15656, 15662, 15667, 15688, 16377, 16384, 16447, 16875, 17536, 18432, 19453, 19683, 19739 .

A nice Friedman prime is a nice Friedman number that&#x27;s also prime. The first nice Friedman primes are:

:127, 15667, 16447, 19739, 28559, 32771, 39343, 46633, 46663, 117619, 117643, 117763, 125003, 131071, 137791, 147419, 156253, 156257, 156259, 229373, 248839, 262139, 262147, 279967, 294829, 295247, 326617, 466553, 466561, 466567, 585643, 592763, 649529, 728993, 759359, 786433, 937577 .

Michael Brand proved that the density of Friedman numbers among the naturals is 1, which is to say that the probability of a number chosen randomly and uniformly between 1 and &quot;n&quot; to be a Friedman number tends to 1 as &quot;n&quot; tends to infinity. This result extends to Friedman numbers under any base of representation. He also proved that the same is true also for binary, ternary and quaternary nice Friedman numbers. The case of base-10 nice Friedman numbers is still open.

Vampire numbers are a subset of Friedman numbers where the only operation is a multiplication of two numbers with the same number of digits, for example 1260 = 21 × 60.

== Finding 2-digit Friedman numbers ==
There usually are fewer 2-digit Friedman numbers than 3-digit and more in any given base, but the 2-digit ones are easier to find. If we represent a 2-digit number as &quot;mb&quot; + &quot;n&quot;, where &quot;b&quot; is the base and &quot;m&quot;, &quot;n&quot; are integers from 0 to &quot;b&quot;−1, we need only check each possible combination of &quot;m&quot; and &quot;n&quot; against the equalities &quot;mb&quot; + &quot;n&quot; = &quot;m&quot;&quot;n&quot;, and &quot;mb&quot; + &quot;n&quot; = &quot;n&quot;&quot;m&quot; to see which ones are true. We need not concern ourselves with &quot;m&quot; + &quot;n&quot; or &quot;m&quot; × &quot;n&quot;, since these will always be smaller than &quot;mb&quot; + &quot;n&quot; when &quot;n&quot; &lt; &quot;b&quot;. The same clearly holds for &quot;m&quot; − &quot;n&quot; and &quot;m&quot; / &quot;n&quot;.

== Other bases ==
Friedman numbers also exist for bases other than base 10. For example, 110012 = 25 is a Friedman number in the binary numeral system, since 11001 = 10110.

The first few known Friedman numbers in other small bases are shown below, written in their respective bases. Numbers shown in bold are nice Friedman numbers.

=== General results ===
In base formula_1, 
: formula_2 
is a Friedman number (written in base formula_3 as 1&quot;mk&quot; = &quot;k&quot; × &quot;m&quot;1).

In base formula_4,
: formula_5
is a Friedman number (written in base formula_3 as 100...00200...001 = 100..0012, with formula_7 zeroes between each nonzero number).

In base formula_8,
: formula_9
is a Friedman number (written in base formula_3 as 2&quot;k&quot; = &quot;k&quot;2). From the observation that all numbers of the form 2&quot;k&quot; × b2&quot;n&quot; can be written as &quot;k&quot;000...0002 with &quot;n&quot; 0&#x27;s, we can find sequences of consecutive Friedman numbers which are arbitrarily long. For example, for formula_11, or in base 10, 250068 = 5002 + 68, from which we can easily deduce the range of consecutive Friedman numbers from 250000 to 250099 in base 10.

Repdigit Friedman numbers:
* The smallest repdigit in base 8 that is a Friedman number is 33 = 33. 
* The smallest repdigit in base 10 that is thought to be a Friedman number is 99999999 = (9 + 9/9)9−9/9 − 9/9. 
* It has been proven that repdigits with at least 22 digits are nice Friedman numbers.

There are an infinite number of prime Friedman numbers in all bases, because for base formula_12 the numbers
: formula_13 in base 2
: formula_14 in base 3
: formula_15 in base 4
: formula_16 in base 5
: formula_17 in base 6
for base formula_18 the numbers
: formula_19 in base 7,
: formula_20 in base 8,
: formula_21 in base 9,
: formula_22 in base 10, 
and for base formula_23
: formula_24
are Friedman numbers for all formula_25. The numbers of this form are an arithmetic sequence formula_26, where formula_27 and formula_28 are relatively prime regardless of base as formula_3 and formula_30 are always relatively prime, and therefore, by Dirichlet&#x27;s theorem on arithmetic progressions, the sequence contains an infinite number of primes.

== Using Roman numerals ==
In a trivial sense, all Roman numerals with more than one symbol are Friedman numbers. The expression is created by simply inserting + signs into the numeral, and occasionally the − sign with slight rearrangement of the order of the symbols.

Some research into Roman numeral Friedman numbers for which the expression uses some of the other operators has been done. The first such nice Roman numeral Friedman number discovered was 8, since VIII = (V - I) × II. Other such nontrivial examples have been found.

The difficulty of finding nontrivial Friedman numbers in Roman numerals increases not with the size of the number (as is the case with positional notation numbering systems) but with the numbers of symbols it has. For example, it is much tougher to figure out whether 147 (CXLVII) is a Friedman number in Roman numerals than it is to make the same determination for 1001 (MI). With Roman numerals, one can at least derive quite a few Friedman expressions from any new expression one discovers. Since 8 is a nice nontrivial nice Roman numeral Friedman number, it follows that any number ending in VIII is also such a Friedman number.

<doc id="929701" wikidata="Q2650302" url="?curid=929701" title="Seneca Park Zoo">
<text>Seneca Park Zoo is a 20-acre (6.3 ha) zoo located in the city of Rochester, New York, US. The zoo is home to over 90 species including mammals, reptiles, birds, amphibians, fish, and arachnids. It is accredited by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA). The zoo is operated by Monroe County, with support from the Seneca Park Zoo Society. The zoo opened in 1894 in Seneca Park.

==History==
Seneca Park, designed by Frederick Law Olmsted, is located on the border of the City of Rochester and the Town of Irondequoit, along the Genesee River. The park was opened in 1893, and animals started being displayed in 1894. The first major addition to the zoo was the Main Zoo Building in 1931. The building was home to a wide variety of animals.

The Seneca Park Zoo Society was chartered as an educational institution by New York State in 1957. Since that time, the Society has evolved into a non-profit organization that supports and promotes the zoo by running educational programs, special events, marketing and public relations efforts, fundraising for &quot;in situ&quot; wildlife conservation, and food and gift operations. The Society offers memberships that are very popular with area families.

In 1975, a polar bear grotto was opened to house the zoo&#x27;s two polar bears (Penny and Nickels), who had been acquired using pennies and nickels collected by local school children. In 1993, the zoo opened the $2 million Genesee Trail and Discovery Center—its first landscape immersion exhibit. This was followed in 1997 by the $8.2 million Rocky Coasts exhibit.

On May 17, 2012, the zoo opened &quot;A Step Into Africa&quot;, which was designed to replicate a portion of the NgoroNgoro Crater in Tanzania. This section of the zoo houses African bush elephants, olive baboons, Southern African lions, and domestic goats.
In 2018, the zoo began making arrangements to demolish the Main Zoo Building as it no longer meets today&#x27;s standards of animal welfare. On June 2, the zoo opened a Cold Asia portion, featuring a new exhibit for the zoo&#x27;s snow leopards and bringing in red pandas. During that same year, an extension of &quot;A Step Into Africa&quot; opened with a new home for the resident southern white rhinoceros, and will feature new animals like Masai giraffes, plains zebras, ostriches, naked mole-rats, rock hyraxes, Lake Malawi cichlids, and many more.

==Exhibits==
The Rocky Coasts exhibit opened in 1997. It is an area dedicated to animals of the polar and temperate coastal regions of the world, including African penguins, California sea lions, snowy owls, Canada lynx, and sandhill cranes. The exhibit includes an underwater viewing area which places visitors close to the sea lions swimming behind large glass windows.

&quot;A Step Into Africa &quot;was unveiled in 2012 and the exhibit includes a replica Maasai hut, Dig Zone for uncovering casts of fossils, interactive learning tools, and a stationary safari bus from which the zoo&#x27;s African lions can be viewed. The area is home to the zoo&#x27;s African bush elephants, olive baboons, and (Southern) African lions in naturalistic settings. Seneca Park Zoo is home to the first three African bush elephants in New York State.

The zoo&#x27;s animal collection changes periodically with AZA recommendations regarding breeding through the Species Survival Plans (SSPs), animal deaths and births. The spring of 2013 proved to be a very fruitful time at the zoo as it welcomed two lion cubs, six African penguin chicks, one golden lion tamarin baby, three domestic goat kids, a California sea lion pup and a Bornean orangutan baby. In 2018, Seneca Park Zoo began its multi-year Master Plan improvement. The first elements of a Cold Asia area opened next to the animal hospital in June, which included new habitats for snow leopards and red pandas. In September 2018, the zoo opened up a new African exhibit called Animals of the Savanna. The five-acre area includes Masai giraffes, plains zebras, a white rhino, naked mole rats, an aviary, and some other smaller exhibits.

==Education and conservation==
Seneca Park Zoo reaches out to many communities in the Western New York region to educate the public with regards to animal and resource conservation, environmental awareness and recycling programs. The zoo is a popular destination for school field trips and the zoo has created expeditions for schoolchildren to learn specific lessons in a zoo setting. The ZooMobile, sponsored by Wegmans, brings small, transportable animals to places like recreation centers, libraries, festivals, senior living facilities and schools. The Butterfly Beltway program, sponsored by the Daisy Marquis Jones Foundation, is a program aimed at planting butterfly gardens to increase populations of monarch butterflies, vital pollinators in the region. Additional programs such as summer programming, ZooCamp and ZooTeens give the community an opportunity to enjoy first-hand experiences with educators, zoo keepers and animals.

==Events==

Seneca Park Zoo hosts many events throughout the year including free-with-admission events such as conservation education days and daily &#x27;Summer Experiences&#x27; from Memorial Day Weekend through Labor Day. Popular fundraisers include ZooBrew, Zoobilation (annual gala), ZooBoo (Halloween), and Breakfast with Santa. The Jungle Jog 5K race that occurs in July of each year boasts a course that takes runners through Seneca Park and the zoo. This 5K is extremely popular with area runners and families.

<text>Lawrence McMenemy MBE (born 26 July 1936) is an English retired football coach, best known for his spell as manager of Southampton. He is rated in the &quot;Guinness Book of Records&quot; as one of the twenty most successful managers in post-war English football.

==Playing career==
McMenemy was born in Gateshead. After serving in the Coldstream Guards he began his footballing career with Newcastle United although he never appeared in their first team. He moved to Gateshead in the late 1950s, joining the club after they had left the Football League. An injury ended his career in 1961, but he moved into coaching instead, spending three years in that role at Gateshead.

==Managerial career==

===Bishop Auckland===
In 1964, McMenemy was appointed manager of non-league Bishop Auckland and transformed them from a struggling side into Northern League champions and also took them to the second round of the FA Cup.

===Sheffield Wednesday and Doncaster Rovers===
McMenemy then moved to Sheffield Wednesday where he spent two years as a coach before he got his big break as manager of Doncaster Rovers where he remained until May 1971, winning the Fourth Division Championship in 1968–69.

===Grimsby Town===
He then became manager of Grimsby Town, where he won a Fourth Division championship. In July 1973 he left Blundell Park to become assistant manager at Southampton.

===Southampton===
In November 1973, four months after joining the Saints as assistant manager, he was promoted to the role of manager, replacing Ted Bates. He was unable to keep them in the First Division that season, but the board kept faith in him to lift the club back out of the Second Division.

In 1976, McMenemy guided Southampton, then in the Second Division, to an FA Cup Final victory over Manchester United. It was widely predicted before the game that United would easily win (one pundit said the score would go into double figures). However Southampton, who were in the Second Division at the time (the current Championship) and had a much older team, put up a stern challenge against United. The only goal of the game was scored by Bobby Stokes with just seven minutes to go, and captain Peter Rodrigues received the FA Cup from the Queen. They were the second club in four seasons to win the FA Cup from outside the First Division of English football after Sunderland in 1973 and only one more side from outside the top flight (West Ham United in 1980) has won the trophy. These are the only instances in the post-Second World War era when the trophy has been won by a team outside the top division.

In 1978, the Saints won promotion to the First Division and in 1979 reached the League Cup Final where they lost 3–2 to Nottingham Forest.

McMenemy was linked with the vacant Manchester United manager&#x27;s job at the end of the 1980–81 season, but he ruled himself out of the running and the job went to Ron Atkinson instead.

McMenemy had signed veteran World Cup winner Alan Ball to aid his side, later adding serving England captain Kevin Keegan when he returned from Germany in 1980. Southampton emerged as title challengers in the 1981–82 season, regularly topping the table, before they finished seventh and the title went to Liverpool. Keegan was sold to Newcastle United that summer, but McMenemy made another big name signing when he captured England goalkeeper Peter Shilton. In 1984, he guided the club to second place in the First Division – their highest ever finish.

===Sunderland===
He left Southampton on 1 June 1985, but returned to football five days later when he was named manager of Sunderland, who had just been relegated to the Second Division. At the time he was the highest-paid manager in English football, but his time on Wearside was not a success and he quit in March 1987 – just weeks before Sunderland fell into the Third Division for the first time in their history.

===England===
In July 1990, he ended a three-year break from football when he was appointed assistant to England manager Graham Taylor, managing the Under-21 side, and picking out future talents like Darren Anderton and Steve McManaman. In November 1993, after England failed to qualify for USA 94, Taylor and McMenemy both resigned. They had reached the 1992 European Championships in Sweden, but failed to progress beyond the group stages.

===Return to Southampton===
McMenemy soon bounced back and was offered the new position of Director of Football by Southampton within weeks of leaving his role with the England team. Fans and the local media were delighted when he accepted the role, which made him the first man to be employed as a Director of Football in the English game. In McMenemy&#x27;s first season back at Southampton, the Saints finished 10th in the Premiership. However, it did not last long and in 1997, when Rupert Lowe arrived as the new chairman, neither McMenemy nor then-manager Graeme Souness got on with him and promptly resigned, publicly denouncing the new board in the process.

===Northern Ireland===
A year later, in 1998 McMenemy was appointed Northern Ireland manager, but he was not successful and he resigned two years later after they failed to qualify for the 2000 European Championships.

Since 2000, McMenemy has concentrated on his role as FA special ambassador, travelling to Afghanistan in 2002 to help set up a national league and liaising with the English team in the Special Olympics.

In July 2006, he was appointed a non-executive director of Southampton F.C.

==Media work==
McMenemy has made frequent appearances on TV football panels since 1972 as well as BBC TV&#x27;s &quot;Superkids&quot; and TVS&#x27;s &quot;Children&#x27;s Challenge&quot;. He also regularly appeared on TV-am prior to 1990 as their football analyst. He presented BBC Radio&#x27;s &quot;Down Your Way&quot; in 1989 and was a summariser for Sky TV News &amp; Eurosport satellite TV until 1990. He currently is in demand as an after-dinner speaker. He has written several books on management motivation. He wrote a regular column in the Southern Daily Echo. He has appeared on the documentary Dream Fans the Spirit of Southampton in 2005. He is also the author of a testimonial in &quot;The Future of the NHS&quot;. His media work also saw him as a panel member of 5 World Cups as well as TV appearances on &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; and &quot;Parkinson&quot;. McMenemy is also the Chairman of the Special Olympics UK. He hosts the Special Olympics Gateshead Tyne &amp; Wear annual awards night.

==Personal life==
He is related to Harry McMenemy.
He is married to Anne, and has three children Chris (ex. Chesterfield FC Manager, Newcastle United FC first team coach, AFC Sunderland coach), Sean and Alison.

<doc id="929708" wikidata="Q344989" url="?curid=929708" title="Peter Beardsley">
<text>Peter Andrew Beardsley (born 18 January 1961) is an English football coach and former footballer who played as a forward or midfielder. 

In 1987, he set a record transfer fee in the English game and represented his country 59 times between 1986 and 1996, once as captain, taking part in two FIFA World Cups (1986 and 1990) and UEFA Euro 1988. At club level, he played for Newcastle United, Liverpool and Everton with stints with the &quot;Toffees&quot; and &quot;Magpies&quot; resulting in over 200 Premier League appearances. Over the course of his career, he also had spells with Carlisle United, Manchester United, Vancouver Whitecaps, Bolton Wanderers, Manchester City, Fulham, Hartlepool United and the Melbourne Knights. 

Between 2001 and 2018, he worked in various coaching roles at Newcastle United, varying from the first team to the youth academy. In 2010, he was briefly appointed as the caretaker manager.

==Club career==
===Early career===
As a youth player, Beardsley played for Wallsend Boys Club in North Tyneside before joining Newcastle United. In 1977, Beardsley joined fellow former Wallsend Boys Club player Steve Bruce for a trial with Third Division club Gillingham. Although Gillingham signed Bruce as an apprentice, they turned Beardsley away. He also had unsuccessful trials with Burnley and Cambridge United.

Beardsley eventually began his professional career with Carlisle United in 1978. He managed 22 goals in 104 league games, helping them win promotion to the Second Division at the end of the 1981–82 season.

During 1981–83, he played three seasons in the North American Soccer League at Canadian club Vancouver Whitecaps then joined Manchester United, although his period at United was unsuccessful, making only one single appearance in a League Cup tie against AFC Bournemouth, and otherwise failing to break into the first team. Eventually in September 1983, he was signed back to Newcastle United.

===Newcastle United===
On 23 September 1983, Beardsley signed for Second Division Newcastle United for a fee of £150,000. He made his debut for the &quot;Magpies&quot; a day later in the 1–1 draw with Barnsley at Oakwell. Beardsley was an instant hit with the Newcastle supporters, scoring and setting up spectacular goals. He went on to celebrate promotion with his teammates, who were captained by Kevin Keegan in his final season as a player. They finished in the final promotion spot behind winners Chelsea and runners-up Sheffield Wednesday. He scored 20 league goals that season and formed an exciting strike partnership with former England striker Keegan, who had also won major honours with Liverpool. Beardsley scored his first goal for the &quot;Magpies&quot; on 19 October 1983 in their 2–0 victory over Cardiff City at Ninian Park. His first goals at St James&#x27; Park came in Newcastle&#x27;s next fixture, against Manchester City. United beat City 5–0 and Beardsley scored his first ever hat-trick.

In his first season in the First Division, Beardsley scored 17 goals in 38 league games as Newcastle finished in 14th position. These included a hat-trick on New Year&#x27;s Day in a 3–1 home win over local rivals Sunderland, who finished the season relegated. During the following campaign, he played in all of Newcastle&#x27;s 42 league matches, scoring 19 goals. In one fixture against West Ham United, Beardsley ended the game as a stand-in goalkeeper. The game ended in an 8–1 defeat for Newcastle, with Beardsley conceding the last three goals.

After returning from the 1986 FIFA World Cup, Beardsley helped a struggling Newcastle to avoid relegation in the 1986–87 season, eventually finishing 17th. He scored just five goals in 36 appearances that season, winning a further six caps for his country, before Liverpool manager Kenny Dalglish made a national record £1.9 million offer to Newcastle for Beardsley&#x27;s services. Manager Willie McFaul accepted the offer and Beardsley was on his way to Merseyside after four seasons on Tyneside which had brought a total of a 61 goals (all in the league), his transfer completed on 14 July 1987.

12 years later, Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson revealed in his autobiography that he had made a £2 million bid for Beardsley, but McFaul had rejected the offer and told him that he wouldn&#x27;t sell the player even if Ferguson offered £3 million.

===Liverpool===
Beardsley joined Liverpool at the same time as John Barnes, the Watford winger. They were added to John Aldridge, who had signed during the previous campaign, with the three playing against Arsenal on Beardsley&#x27;s debut at Highbury on the opening day of the 1987–88 season, 15 August 1987. Aldridge scored after just nine minutes, Liverpool went on to win 2–1, and this shaped the rest of the season for the &quot;Reds&quot;. The new-look striker partnership of Beardsley and Aldridge took over from the long-standing partnership of Dalglish and Ian Rush, which was arguably the most successful partnership in English football during the 1980s. Rush had departed to Serie A club Juventus, while player-manager Dalglish had decided only to make occasional first-team appearances from 1987 to 1988 onwards, finally retiring as a player in August 1990.

Beardsley&#x27;s first goal for his new club came on 29 August 1987 in the 4–1 victory over Coventry City at Highfield Road, with Beardsley scoring in the 83rd minute. He helped Liverpool to a record-equalling 29 league matches undefeated as Liverpool convincingly strolled to the League title with just two defeats to their name. However, there was disappointment at the end when Wimbledon denied them the &#x27;double&#x27; with a shock 1–0 win in the 1988 FA Cup final, a game in which Beardsley found the net, only for it to be ruled out by the referee who awarded Liverpool a free-kick for an earlier foul instead of allowing play to continue. Wimbledon scored the only goal of the game from a looping header by Lawrie Sanchez. Aldridge missed a penalty for Liverpool in the second half. Beardsley scored 15 league goals in his first season for Liverpool, level with John Barnes as the club&#x27;s second highest scorer, behind Aldridge.

Rush rejoined the club in the 1988 close season and Liverpool returned to Wembley and won the FA Cup the following year, but lost their League championship with virtually the last kick of the last game of the season against Arsenal. Although Rush missed 14 games due to injury, when all three of Liverpool&#x27;s strikers were fit, Dalglish played with a 4–3–3 formation that allowed Beardsley, Aldridge and Rush to play alongside each other when possible. Beardsley scored 11 league goals that season.

In April 1989, after the Hillsborough disaster claimed the lives of 96 Liverpool fans, Beardsley was among many Liverpool stars left distraught by the tragedy, attending several funerals and visiting the injured in hospital. He was part of the team that won the FA Cup that season with a 3–2 win over neighbours Everton at Wembley Stadium, though the league title slipped away on the final day of the season when Liverpool conceded a last minute goal to champions Arsenal at Anfield.

With the departure of Aldridge a few weeks into the 1989–90 season, Dalglish reverted to a 4–4–2 formation with Beardsley and Rush as his main strikers, with Beardsley scoring 10 goals in 29 games. Liverpool won the championship again that season, but the arrival of Israeli international striker Ronny Rosenthal saw his first-team opportunities limited in the title run-in, in which Liverpool overcame a strong challenge by Aston Villa to finish champions by a nine-point margin. Despite UEFA lifting the ban on English clubs in European competitions for the 1990–91 season, Liverpool were unable to compete in the European Cup as (being the team present at the Heysel disaster that had sparked the ban in 1985) they had to serve an extra year of the ban before being allowed to play in European competitions again.

Beardsley suffered another blow to his first team chances in January 1991 when Kenny Dalglish signed David Speedie. Dalglish stepped down the following month and was replaced a few weeks later by former Liverpool player Graeme Souness, after Ronnie Moran spent two months in charge on an interim basis. Beardsley managed 27 games that campaign and scored 11 goals – three of them in a 4–0 league win over Manchester United on 16 September 1990, and a further two in the Merseyside derby against Everton a week later.

Beardsley&#x27;s final league goal for the &quot;Reds&quot; came on 17 November 1990, when he scored the only goal in a 1–0 win at Coventry City. By this relatively early stage of the season he had scored an impressive 11 times in the league, but a failure to add any more goals over the Christmas period may have played a part in Dalglish&#x27;s decision to sign another striker in the new year. His final competitive goals for Liverpool came in a dramatic fifth round FA Cup first replay against Everton at Goodison Park on 20 February 1991, which ended in a 4–4 draw and was the club&#x27;s last game before the sudden resignation of manager Dalglish, who by the end of the season had been succeeded by Graeme Souness.

Liverpool were top of the league at this stage, but in the new year were overhauled by Arsenal and the title went to Highbury at the end of the season. And with the arrival of Dean Saunders for a national record fee of £2.9 million after the end of the season, Beardsley&#x27;s days at Anfield were looking even more numbered, despite the sale of Speedie. During Beardsley&#x27;s Anfield career he played in 175 matches and scored 59 goals, but it was his vision, guile and all action style of play that endeared him to the Anfield faithful, so much so he was voted in 19th position in the 2006 poll 100 Players Who Shook The Kop, conducted by the Liverpool Football Club web site; over 110,000 supporters worldwide voted for their 10 favourite players of all time.

===Everton===
Liverpool&#x27;s derby rivals, Everton succeeded in gaining 30-year-old Beardsley&#x27;s signature when he joined them on 5 August 1991 for a fee of £1 million. He made his debut on 17 August in a 2–1 defeat to Nottingham Forest at the City Ground. Beardsley scored 25 goals in 81 appearances for the blue half of Merseyside, though Everton did not achieve anything greater than a mid table finish in the league during his time there, and failed to make an impact in the cup competitions.

While at Everton he became – along with David Johnson – one of only two players to have scored for both sides in Merseyside derbies. He finished as the club&#x27;s top scorer by the end of his first season at Goodison Park and again showed his dynamic quality during his second season, but off the field Everton were suffering financial difficulties and when former club Newcastle United offered Everton £1.5 million for Beardsley, it was a sum they could not turn down for a 32-year-old player. In all competitions, Beardsley scored 32 goals in 95 appearances for Everton.

===Return to Newcastle United===
On 16 July 1993, Beardsley rejoined Newcastle United for £1.5 million, where his old teammate and strike partner Kevin Keegan was now manager. Newcastle had just won promotion to the Premier League as First Division champions, and in 1993–94 they finished third and qualified for the UEFA Cup, with Beardsley scoring a total of 25 goals and his strike-partner Andy Cole scoring a club record of 41 goals in all competitions. He played for a further four years at the club, almost captaining them to the Premier League title in 1996, but they were pipped to the title by Manchester United. They finished runners-up a year later as well, although 1996–97 was a trying season for the club as they failed to set the pace at the top of the table as they had the previous season, and halfway through the season Keegan had stunned the club with his resignation, with Kenny Dalglish then succeeding him.

During his second spell at St James&#x27; Park, he racked up 157 appearances and scored 56 goals, bringing his overall total after two spells with the club to 321 appearances and 117 goals. This equates to a goal every 2.74 matches, a decent ratio for a player who was seen by many as a provider rather than a goalscorer, particularly in the 1996–97 season when he was switched to midfield following Alan Shearer&#x27;s arrival. It is this period of his career that Beardsley regards as the time when he peaked.

===Later career and retirement===
Beardsley left Newcastle for the second time on 18 August 1997 for £450,000, joining Bolton Wanderers, where he made 21 appearances but was unable to save them from being relegated from the Premier League just one season after promotion. He then went on loan to Manchester City, where he played six times in the First Division. This loan spell made Beardsley the only player to play for both top-flight teams in Liverpool and Manchester.

He then moved to Fulham who were managed by his former manager Keegan, where he made 28 appearances in two separate loan spells, eventually signing for them permanently. He then went to Hartlepool United on a free transfer, and played 22 times in the Third Division to secure their Football League status. He finally ended his career at the age of 38 when he played twice for the National Soccer League club Melbourne Knights.

In a professional career totalling some 20 years in English football, he managed 659 league games and 210 goals, and a total of 799 games and 238 goals in all competitions. He had collected three major trophies (all of them with Liverpool) and was capped 59 times by England, scoring nine times. He had also played in two promotion winning teams earlier in his career, although he had been sold by Carlisle just before they sealed promotion in 1982.

During the 2012–13 season, Beardsley played in a friendly for Cambridge United against the Newcastle United reserve squad to celebrate Cambridge&#x27;s 100th anniversary since they were founded.

==International career==
After reaching the First Division with Newcastle, Beardsley became a regular in the England side in the second half of the 1980s, and teamed up with striker Gary Lineker, who described Beardsley as &quot;the best partner I could ever have&quot;.

On 29 January 1986, Beardsley made his debut for his country, coming on as a substitute for Lineker in the 4–0 friendly victory over Egypt in Cairo. His first goal came in his fourth appearance, on 17 May 1986 in the 3–0 friendly win over Mexico in Los Angeles, as England prepared for the forthcoming World Cup in Mexico. England scored seven goals in the tournament, of which Lineker scored six (winning the Golden Boot for doing so); the other goal came from Beardsley in a 3–0 victory over Paraguay in the second round. England had failed to score a goal in the first two matches of the finals, but in the third match – Beardsley&#x27;s first start in the tournament – they beat Poland 3–0. Beardsley contributed in that match with a spectacular cross to Steve Hodge, which allowed Hodge to make England&#x27;s second goal for Lineker. The next match was to be the famous Argentina vs. England match, in which Diego Maradona scored twice for the 2–1 victory that saw England eliminated from the tournament. Beardsley played the full game and was one of the five players passed by Maradona for the &quot;Goal of the Century&quot;.

He maintained his place in the England team and featured in both Euro 88 and the 1990 World Cup. He was named as England captain on 17 February 1988 when they drew 0–0 in a friendly with Israel.

Beardsley was dropped by England manager Graham Taylor after the end of 1990, around the same time he lost his regular place in the Liverpool line-up, and, controversially, continued to be overlooked by him despite England&#x27;s disappointing performance at Euro 92 as well as their unsuccessful attempt to qualify for the 1994 World Cup. Beardsley, meanwhile, was performing very well for his new club Everton, having signed for them in August 1991, although Everton&#x27;s form as a team was far from impressive.

During his second spell at Newcastle, Beardsley was recalled to the England team by new manager Terry Venables in early 1994 after an absence of three years, and ultimately ended his international career while still at Newcastle in 1996, when he was one of the three players dropped from the provisional squad of 25 for the final squad of 22 for Euro 96, along with Dennis Wise and Jason Wilcox, after gaining 59 caps and scoring nine goals.

Beardsley once scored four goals for England against Aylesbury United. These did not count towards his international tally, however, as this was not an official international match. Aylesbury became the only non-League side to face the full England team, as they hosted the national side in a warm-up match in 1988 in preparation for the European Championships. England won the game 7–0.

==Coaching career==
Beardsley joined the coaching staff at Newcastle United after his playing career was over. In early 1999, Beardsley also served as assistant manager to Howard Wilkinson during his first caretaker period as manager of England, between the dismissal of Glenn Hoddle and the appointment of Kevin Keegan. England faced – and lost to – world champions France in a friendly at Wembley. In 2003, Beardsley was the subject of a Premier League inquiry, after it was claimed that he had bullied two Newcastle youth players. He was cleared of the charges. Bullying allegations were again raised against Beardsley in January 2018.

Beardsley left Newcastle in 2006, when Glenn Roeder took over as permanent manager of the club. He believed Newcastle should go in a different direction. Beardsley then worked in a media role at the club. In 2007, Howard Kendall, his former boss at Everton stated he was interested in taking over as manager of Republic of Ireland national team, with Beardsley as his assistant manager. Beardsley was also linked with a return to Newcastle in January 2008, when Keegan returned as manager for a second spell.

In March 2009, Beardsley was re-appointed as an academy coach at Newcastle, working primarily with young strikers. On 27 July 2010, he was appointed as reserve team manager, with Steve Stone as his assistant manager. On 6 December, following the dismissal of Chris Hughton, Beardsley was briefly placed in charge of the team on a temporary basis before Alan Pardew was brought in as Hughton&#x27;s replacement.

In January 2018, Beardsley was placed on leave by Newcastle following allegations of racism. In March 2019, Newcastle confirmed that he had left the club, and the Football Association later confirmed they were investigating him. He was subsequently charged with three counts of using racist language to players. In September 2019, he was suspended from all football-related activity for 32 weeks after being found guilty by the FA of making racist comments to players. Beardsley said he was &quot;surprised and disappointed&quot; at being found guilty. The FA panel said: &quot;Even if he did not intend to do so, he plainly did cause offence.&quot; However, the panel said it did not believe Beardsley was racist, stating: &quot;We are satisfied that Mr Beardsley is not a racist in the sense of being ill-disposed to persons on grounds of their race or ethnicity.&quot;

==Personal life==
Born in Hexham, Beardsley grew up in Forest Hall, Newcastle upon Tyne.

Beardsley has been married since 1981 to his wife Sandra. They have a son, Drew (born 1989), and a daughter, Stacey (born 1993).

<text>Pseudomathematics, or mathematical crankery, is a mathematics-like activity that does not adhere to the framework of rigor of formal mathematical practice. Common areas of pseudomathematics are solutions of problems proved to be unsolvable or recognized as extremely hard by experts, as well as attempts to apply mathematics to non-quantifiable areas. A person engaging in pseudomathematics is called a pseudomathematician or a pseudomath. Pseudomathematics has equivalents in other scientific fields, and may overlap with other topics characterized as pseudoscience.

Pseudomathematics often contains mathematical fallacies whose executions are tied to elements of deceit rather than genuine, unsuccessful attempts at tackling a problem. Excessive pursuit of pseudomathematics can result in the practitioner being labelled a crank. Because it is based on non-mathematical principles, pseudomathematics is not related to misguided attempts at genuine proofs. Indeed, such mistakes are common in the careers of amateur mathematicians, some of whom go on to produce celebrated results.

The topic of mathematical crankery has been extensively studied by mathematician Underwood Dudley, who has written several popular works about mathematical cranks and their ideas.

==Examples==
One common type of approach is claiming to have solved a classical problem that has been proven to be mathematically unsolvable. Common examples of this include the following constructions in Euclidean geometry—using only a compass and straightedge:
* Squaring the circle: Given any circle drawing a square having the same area.
* Doubling the cube: Given any cube drawing a cube with twice its volume.
* Trisecting the angle: Given any angle dividing it into three smaller angles all of the same size.

For more than 2,000 years, many people had tried and failed to find such constructions; in the 19th century, they were all proven impossible.

Another notable case were &quot;Fermatists&quot;, who plagued mathematical institutions with requests to check their proofs of Fermat&#x27;s Last Theorem.

Another common approach is to misapprehend standard mathematical methods, and to insist that the use or knowledge of higher mathematics is somehow cheating or misleading (e.g., the denial of Cantor&#x27;s diagonal argument or Gödel&#x27;s incompleteness theorems).

== History == 
The term &quot;pseudomath&quot; was coined by the logician Augustus De Morgan, discoverer of De Morgan&#x27;s laws, in his &quot;A Budget of Paradoxes&quot; (1872). De Morgan wrote:
The pseudomath is a person who handles mathematics as the monkey handled the razor. The creature tried to shave himself as he had seen his master do; but, not having any notion of the angle at which the razor was to be held, he cut his own throat. He never tried a second time, poor animal! but the pseudomath keeps on at his work, proclaims himself clean-shaved, and all the rest of the world hairy.

De Morgan named James Smith as an example of a pseudomath who claimed to have proved that  is exactly . Of Smith, De Morgan wrote: &quot;He is beyond a doubt the ablest head at unreasoning, and the greatest hand at writing it, of all who have tried in our day to attach their names to an error.&quot; The term &quot;pseudomath&quot; was adopted later by Tobias Dantzig. Dantzig observed:
With the advent of modern times, there was an unprecedented increase in pseudomathematical activity. During the 18th century, all scientific academies of Europe saw themselves besieged by circle-squarers, trisectors, duplicators, and &quot;perpetuum mobile&quot; designers, loudly clamoring for recognition of their epoch-making achievements. In the second half of that century, the nuisance had become so unbearable that, one by one, the academies were forced to discontinue the examination of the proposed solutions.

The term &quot;pseudomathematics&quot; has been applied to attempts in mental and social sciences to quantify the effects of what is typically considered to be qualitative. More recently, the same term has been applied to creationist attempts to refute the theory of evolution, by way of spurious arguments purportedly based in probability or complexity theory, such as intelligent design proponent William Dembski&#x27;s concept of specified complexity.

<text>Fall Weiss (&quot;Case White&quot;, &quot;Plan White&quot;; German spelling &quot;Fall Weiß&quot;) was the German strategic plan for the invasion of Poland. The German military High Command finalized its operational orders on 15 June 1939 and the invasion commenced on 1 September, precipitating World War II.

== Background ==
The origins of the plan went back to 1928, when Werner von Fritsch started working on it. &quot;Fall Weiss&quot; was developed primarily by Günther Blumentritt and Erich von Manstein while the two were serving as staff officers under General Gerd von Rundstedt with Army Group South in Silesia.

==Details==
The plan called for a start of hostilities before the declaration of war. 
Wehrmacht units were to invade Poland from three directions:
* A primary attack from the German mainland across the western border of Poland.
* A secondary attack from the north, from the exclave of East Prussia.
* A tertiary attack by German and allied Slovak units across the border of Slovakia.

All three assaults were to converge on Warsaw while the main Polish army was to be encircled and destroyed west of the Vistula River.

The plan was initiated on 1 September 1939 and was the first European military operation of World War II.

<doc id="929718" wikidata="Q378062" url="?curid=929718" title="Bauhinia × blakeana">
<text>Bauhinia&quot; × &quot;blakeana ( [cross] ), commonly called the Hong Kong orchid tree, is a hybrid leguminous tree of the genus &quot;Bauhinia&quot;. It has large thick leaves and striking purplish red flowers. The fragrant, orchid-like flowers are usually across, and bloom from early November to the end of March. Although now cultivated in many areas, it originated in Hong Kong in 1880 and apparently all of the cultivated trees derive from one cultivated at the Hong Kong Botanical Gardens and widely planted in Hong Kong starting in 1914. It is referred to as bauhinia in non-scientific literature though this is the name of the genus. It is sometimes called the Hong Kong orchid (). In Hong Kong, it is most commonly referred to by its Chinese name of &quot;(yèuhng jígīng)&quot;.

The &quot;Bauhinia&quot; double-lobed leaf is similar in shape to a heart or a butterfly, or a camel&#x27;s footprint - hence the common name camel&#x27;s foot. A typical leaf is long and wide, with a deep cleft dividing the apex. In Hong Kong the leaf is known as the &quot;clever leaf&quot; (), and is regarded as a symbol of wisdom. Some people use the leaves to make bookmarks in the hope that they will bring them good luck in their studies.

It is sterile, which means it does not generally produce seeds or fruits, and is a hybrid between &quot;Bauhinia variegata&quot; and &quot;Bauhinia purpurea&quot;. The 2008 research was able to identify the female parent as &quot;Bauhinia purpurea&quot;, but it could not differentiate the male parent from &quot;Bauhinia variegata&quot; var. &quot;variegata&quot; or &quot;Bauhinia variegata&quot; var. &quot;candida&quot;. This is not unexpected, as &quot;Bauhinia variegata&quot; var. &quot;candida&quot; is a white-flowered form of &quot;Bauhinia variegata&quot; var. &quot;variegata&quot;, and not a separate species or sub-species. The 2005 research suggested &quot;Bauhinia&quot; × &quot;blakeana&quot; is genetically closer to &quot;Bauhinia variegata&quot;, while the 2008 research indicated it is closer to &quot;Bauhinia purpurea&quot; instead.

Propagation is by grafting. As it is only known in cultivation, it can also be named as a cultivar: &quot;Bauhinia&quot; &#x27;Blakeana&#x27;. Hong Kong orchid trees are usually sterile, yet here, too, there are exceptions. One tree has been found in Hong Kong that produces seeds, perhaps indicating that evolution or mutation has occurred, or that even though &quot;Bauhinia&quot; × &quot;blakeana&quot; is perhaps sterile when self-pollinated (the scientific study in 2005 established the low fertility of &quot;Bauhinia&quot; × &quot;blakeana&quot;&#x27;s pollen when compared with its parental species &quot;Bauhinia purpurea&quot; or &quot;Bauhinia variegata&quot;), however, it may perhaps be able to produce seeds when pollinated instead by its parental species &quot;Bauhinia purpurea&quot; or &quot;Bauhinia variegata&quot; or other related &quot;Bauhinia&quot; species. More scientific research will need to be carried out, e.g., artificial controlled cross-pollination experiments to confirm the ability of &quot;Bauhinia&quot; × &quot;blakeana&quot; in backcross or outcross to produce (fertile) seeds.

Lawrence Ramsden of the University of Hong Kong&#x27;s Department of Botany is conducting the search to find out if there are any more individuals that can produce seeds – if so, they could benefit propagation of the tree for horticulture. Two previous instances of seeds found from &quot;Bauhinia&quot; × &quot;blakeana&quot; specimens failed to germinate. Development of seed pods (but no seeds) from &quot;B.&quot; × &quot;blakeana&quot; have been observed on three trees in Tai Po and Kowloon in Hong Kong. These three &quot;B.&quot; × &quot;blakeana&quot; trees with numerous seed pods were grown alongside &quot;B. purpurea&quot;, &quot;B. variegata&quot; (white flowered form) and &quot;B. variegata&quot;. At the time (March in Hong Kong), both &quot;B. blakeana&quot; and &quot;B. purpurea&quot; were flowering, therefore, the pollens for development of &quot;B. blakeana&quot; seed pods may have been contributed from &quot;B. purpurea&quot;.

==History==

This tree was discovered in around 1880 by a French Catholic Missionary of the Paris Foreign Missions (MEP), near the ruins of a house above the shore-line of western Hong Kong island near Pok Fu Lam and propagated to the formal botanical gardens in Victoria/Central.

The first thorough scientific description of the tree was made by Stephen Troyte Dunn, Superintendent of the Botanical and Forestry Department, who assigned it to the genus &quot;Bauhinia&quot; in his paper of 1908. Dunn named the tree for &quot;Sir Henry and Lady Blake&quot;, the former being Sir Henry Blake, British Governor of Hong Kong, from 1898 to 1903. Sir Henry and Lady Blake were thus thanked for their promotion of the Hong Kong Botanic Gardens.

Dunn&#x27;s description was based on the trees in the Botanical Gardens, which had been grown from cuttings taken from trees cultivated in the French Mission at Pokfulam, on the west coast of Hong Kong Island, which in turn were derived from a tree (or trees) found nearby. As far as is known, all the French Mission cuttings were taken from a single tree, so all Hong Kong orchid trees today would be clones of the original tree. Dr Lawrence Ramsden of the University of Hong Kong’s Department of Botany estimates that this clonal origin would mean that &quot;B.&quot; × &quot;blakeana&quot; could be susceptible to decimation by epidemics, though it has so far avoided major diseases.

In order to avoid the susceptibility of &quot;B.&quot; × &quot;blakeana&quot; to diseases due to the lack of genetic diversity from the current clones of a single &quot;B.&quot; × &quot;blakeana&quot; tree back in 1880s, efforts should be made to re-hybridise the parental species of &quot;B.&quot; × &quot;blakeana&quot;, ie, crossing &quot;B. purpurea&quot; and &quot;B. variegata&quot; to generate new hybrid specimens of &quot;B.&quot; × &quot;blakeana&quot; instead to add new genetic materials to the current stock of &quot;B.&quot; × &quot;blakeana&quot;.

==Usage as an emblem==

Since 1997 the flower appears on Hong Kong&#x27;s coat of arms, its flag and its coins; its Chinese name has also been frequently shortened as 紫荊/紫荆 (洋 &quot;yáng&quot; means &#x27;foreign&#x27; in Chinese, and this would be deemed inappropriate by the PRC government), although 紫荊/紫荆 refers to another genus called &quot;Cercis&quot;. A statue of the plant has been erected in Golden Bauhinia Square in Hong Kong.
Although the flowers are bright pinkish purple in colour, they are depicted in white on the Flag of Hong Kong.
Hong Kong Airlines uses BAUHINIA as its callsign.

The endemic plant of Hong Kong was introduced to Taiwan in 1967. In 1984 it was chosen to be the city flower of Chiayi City, in southwestern Taiwan.

<text>Willie Wei-Hock Soon (born September 30, 1965) is a Malaysian astrophysicist and aerospace engineer who was long employed as a part-time externally funded researcher at the Solar and Stellar Physics (SSP) Division of the Center for Astrophysics | Harvard &amp; Smithsonian.

Soon is an anthropogenic climate change denier, disputing the scientific understanding of climate change, and contends that most global warming is caused by solar variation rather than by human activity. He co-wrote a paper whose methodology was widely criticised by the scientific community. Climate scientists such as Gavin Schmidt of the Goddard Institute for Space Studies have refuted Soon&#x27;s arguments, and the Smithsonian does not support his conclusions. He is nonetheless frequently cited by politicians opposed to climate-change legislation.

Soon co-authored &quot;The Maunder Minimum and the Variable Sun–Earth Connection&quot; with Steven H. Yaskell. The book treats historical and proxy records of climate change coinciding with the Maunder Minimum, a period from 1645 to about 1715 when sunspots became exceedingly rare.

From 2005 to 2015, Soon had received over $1.2 million from the fossil fuel industry, while failing to disclose that conflict of interest in most of his work. As is standard for externally funded researchers at the CfA, over half of this funding went on the Smithsonian&#x27;s facility operating costs, with the remainder going to Soon as his salary.

==Early life and education==
Willie Soon was born in Kangar, Malaysia, in 1966. He attended Khoon Aik Primary School in Kangar, Perlis, then Sekolah Menengah Syed Sirajudin Secondary School in Jejawi, Perlis, and Sekolah Menengah Dato Sheikh Ahmad Secondary School in Arau, Perlis. To further his education he emigrated to the United States in 1980 and attended the University of Southern California, receiving a B.Sc. in 1985, followed by a M.Sc. in 1987 and then a Ph.D. in Aerospace Engineering [with distinction] in 1991. His doctoral thesis was titled &quot;Non-equilibrium kinetics in high-temperature gases&quot;. He received the IEEE Nuclear and Plasma Sciences Society Graduate Scholastic Award in 1989 and the Rockwell Dennis Hunt Scholastic Award from the University of Southern California in 1991.

==Career==
After completing his Ph.D., Soon took up a post-doctoral research position at the Center for Astrophysics | Harvard &amp; Smithsonian. He has since been doing research there in astrophysics and Earth science, now as an externally funded employee. He also was for shorter periods an astronomer at the Mount Wilson Observatory a senior scientist at a conservative think tank, the now defunct George C. Marshall Institute, the chief science adviser to the oil industry-funded Science and Public Policy Institute, and an Adjunct Professor of the Faculty of Science and Environmental Studies of the University of Putra, Malaysia. In 2004, Soon received the &quot;Petr Beckmann Award for outstanding contributions to the defense of scientific truth&quot; from the conservative Doctors for Disaster Preparedness, which Bloomberg News describes as a forum on &quot;fringe-science topics&quot; such as global warming denial and &quot;The Guardian&quot; as a &quot;fringe political group&quot; and as a &quot;truly bizarre lobby group&quot;.

Since 2018 Soon has been a principal of the Center for Environmental Research and Earth Sciences (CERES), which describes itself as a &quot;multi-disciplinary and independent research group.&quot; 

===2003: &quot;Climate Research&quot; controversy===

In 2003, Willie Soon was first author on a review paper in the journal &quot;Climate Research&quot;, with Sallie Baliunas as co-author. This paper concluded that &quot;the 20th century is probably not the warmest nor a uniquely extreme climatic period of the last millennium.&quot;

Shortly thereafter, 13 scientists published a refutation of the paper. They raised three main objections: (1) Soon and Baliunas used data reflective of changes in moisture, rather than temperature; (2) they failed to distinguish between regional and hemispheric mean temperature anomalies; and (3) they reconstructed past temperatures from proxy evidence not capable of resolving decadal trends. Soon, Baliunas and geography professor David Legates published a response to these objections.

After disagreement with the publisher and with other members of the editorial board, Hans von Storch, Clare Goodess, and two more members of the journal&#x27;s ten-member editorial board resigned in protest against what they felt was a failure of the peer review process on the part of the journal. Otto Kinne, managing director of the journal&#x27;s parent company, eventually stated that &quot;CR [&quot;Climate Research&quot;] should have been more careful and insisted on solid evidence and cautious formulations before publication&quot; and that &quot;CR should have requested appropriate revisions of the manuscript prior to publication.&quot;

Soon and Baliunas were also criticised because they did not disclose that their research was funded in part by the American Petroleum Institute.

===2011: Funding controversy===
In 2011, it emerged that Soon received over $1 million from petroleum and coal interests since 2001. Center for Astrophysics | Harvard &amp; Smithsonian documents obtained by Greenpeace under the US Freedom of Information Act show that the Charles G. Koch Charitable Foundation gave Soon two grants totaling $175,000 in 2005–06 and again in 2010. Multiple grants from the American Petroleum Institute between 2001 and 2007 totalled $274,000, and grants from ExxonMobil totalled $335,000 between 2005 and 2010. Other coal and oil industry sources which funded him include the Mobil Foundation, the Texaco Foundation and the Electric Power Research Institute. Soon stated that he has &quot;never been motivated by financial reward in any of my scientific research&quot; and &quot;would have accepted money from Greenpeace if they had offered it to do my research.&quot;

Putting forward health reasons, in 2011 Soon went from full-time employment by the Smithsonian at the Center for Astrophysics | Harvard &amp; Smithsonian to a part-time position. The Center&#x27;s spokesman said &quot;Willie&#x27;s opinions regarding climate change are his personal views not shared within our research organization&quot;. Its former director Irwin Shapiro said no attempt had been made to suppress Soon&#x27;s views, and there had been no complaints from other scientists there: &quot;As far as I can tell, no one pays any attention to him.&quot; Soon has been defended by others agreeing with his views. In 2013, theoretical physicist Freeman Dyson wrote in an email to &quot;The Boston Globe&quot;: &quot;The whole point of science is to question accepted dogmas. For that reason, I respect Willie Soon as a good scientist and a courageous citizen.&quot; The late Republican Senator Jim Inhofe had cited Soon, and Inhofe&#x27;s former director of communications Marc Morano said that &quot;Willie Soon is a hero of the skeptical movement. When you are an early pioneer, you are going to face the scrutiny and attacks.&quot; Soon has links with conservative groups which promote his writings to influence the public debate on climate change, including The Heartland Institute, and the Committee for a Constructive Tomorrow. In a speech at The Heritage Foundation, he accused the IPCC of being &quot;a pure bully&quot; engaged in &quot;blatant manipulations of fact&quot;, and said &quot;Stop politicizing science! Just stop!&quot;

===January 2015 Monckton et al. paper===
With William M. Briggs, geography professor David Legates, and journalist and British politician Christopher Monckton, Soon co-authored a paper published by the &quot;Chinese Science Bulletin&quot; in 2015. Climatologist Gavin Schmidt described the paper as &quot;complete trash&quot;. He said that the model used is not new, &quot;they arbitrarily restrict its parameters and then declare all other models wrong.&quot;

===2015: Disclosure violations===
Soon, as a researcher at the Center for Astrophysics | Harvard &amp; Smithsonian (CfA), is a part-time employee of the Smithsonian Institution, a government agency covered by the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). Greenpeace worker Kert Davies made a succession of FOIA requests for Soon&#x27;s correspondence and grant arrangements and in 2014 was given documents disclosing arrangements both Soon and the CfA had with funders. Later in 2014, Davies left Greenpeace to become executive director of a newly founded non-profit, Climate Investigations Center.

The Smithsonian does not fund Soon, who &quot;pursues external grants to fund his research.&quot; This funding had exceeded US$1.5 million since 2001; under standard CfA procedures, more than half of the $1.2 million funding since 2005 had gone towards the Smithsonian&#x27;s facility operating costs, with the remainder being passed on to Soon as his salary. Other researchers there have a similar arrangement, but nearly all of their funding comes through peer-reviewed award processes from government bodies such as NASA and the National Science Foundation, whereas Soon has received very little federal money. Soon&#x27;s funding by private interests is highly unusual at the Smithsonian. It included at least $230,000 from the Charles G. Koch Foundation which is associated with the oil industry and $469,560 from the Southern Company which uses coal to generate electricity. ExxonMobil and the American Petroleum Institute also provided funding, which was later replaced by anonymous donors through the Donors Trust, a donor-advised fund that offers anonymity to clients who do not wish to make their donations public. The latter was identified by a 2013 Drexel University study as the largest single provider of money to political efforts to fight climate-change policy. A 2008 contract agreed to by the CfA required the institute to notify the Southern Company before disclosing that Southern had provided funding, and both the CfA and Willie Soon to provide Southern with advance copies of any publications &quot;for comment and input&quot;, though the company could not block publications or require changes.

The &quot;Chinese Science Bulletin&quot; has a strict policy requiring disclosure of &quot;all relationships or interests that could influence or bias the work&quot;, including &quot;professional interests or personal beliefs that may influence your research&quot;, for example previous receipt of research grants. The Monckton et al. paper published in January 2015 included a statement by the authors, including Soon, that they had no conflict of interest, and Davies wrote to the journal about the undisclosed funding shown by the documents. On 24 January the journal replied that they would &quot;look into the matter as appropriate&quot;. The story was published by &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; on 26 January with a statement by Monckton that allegations of failure to disclose a material conflict of interest were untrue, as the authors had not &quot;received any funding whatsoever for our research, which was conducted in our own time&quot;. He said that the Heartland Institute had provided funding to make the paper available to the public on the journal&#x27;s website.

On February 21, publications including &quot;The Guardian&quot; and &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that Soon had failed to disclose conflicts of interest in at least 11 papers since 2008, and alleged that Soon had violated ethical guidelines of at least eight of those journals publishing his work. Charles R. Alcock, director of the Center for Astrophysics | Harvard &amp; Smithsonian, described the disclosure violations as &quot;inappropriate behavior&quot; that they would &quot;have to handle with Dr. Soon internally&quot;. On the same day, &quot;Nature&quot; reported that the CfA had launched an investigation into whether Soon had properly reported the funding arrangements shown in the documents. Alcock said &quot;We want to get the facts straight. If there is evidence of failure to disclose, yes, we have a problem.&quot; He said that the contract with Southern preventing disclosure of their funding &quot;was a mistake&quot;, and in a later email reply to questions said &quot;We will not permit similar wording in future grant agreements&quot;. The Smithsonian announced that its Inspector General would investigate, and in addition there was to be a full review of the Smithsonian&#x27;s ethics and disclosure policies about sponsored research, led by former NSF director Rita R. Colwell.

On March 2, 2015, The Heartland Institute conservative think tank released a statement by Soon, which said he had &quot;been the target of attacks in the press by various radical environmental and politically motivated groups&quot;. He described this as &quot;a shameless attempt to silence my scientific research and writings, and to make an example out of me as a warning to any other researcher who may dare question in the slightest their fervently held orthodoxy of anthropogenic global warming.&quot; Some of the journals that had published Soon&#x27;s work had begun reviewing the papers in relation to their policies requiring disclosure: Soon said he had &quot;always complied with what I understood to be disclosure practices in my field generally&quot;. He would be &quot;happy to comply&quot; if they required further disclosure, and &quot;would ask only that other authors—on all sides of the debate—are also required to make similar disclosures.&quot;

He also requested that journalists who had reported on his actions similarly examined disclosure by other scientists. An investigation by &quot;InsideClimate News&quot; could find no cases where mainstream climatologists had failed to disclose the funding of their research. Unlike Soon, who had approached private funders directly, their funding was almost entirely obtained through open competitive peer-reviewed applications to public bodies. Climate scientist Andrew Dessler said &quot;People always acknowledge their grants, and that&#x27;s not really an issue&quot;. Though it was almost certain that a disclosure issue could arise, intentionally or otherwise, no instances were known. The nearest case was raised by Steven Milloy&#x27;s &quot;Junk Science&quot; blog when &quot;Nature Climate Change&quot; published a 2012 study by meteorologist Kerry Emanuel, who was paid a fixed amount by two companies to sit on their board. Although the companies did not fund his research, the journal then added disclosure of these board memberships. The blog raised the same concern about a paper published a year later, but &quot;Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences&quot; decided this disclosure was not required.

In April 2015, a Southern Company spokesman said &quot;Our agreement with the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory expires later this year and there are no plans to renew it&quot;. It still required Soon to produce a study on &quot;Solar Activity Variation on Multiple Timescales&quot; by November 2015.

<doc id="929728" wikidata="Q7550991" url="?curid=929728" title="Social cognitive theory of morality">
<text>The social cognitive theory of morality attempts to explain how moral thinking, in interaction with other psychosocial determinants, govern individual moral conduct. Social cognitive theory adopts an &quot;interactionist&quot; perspective to the development of moral behavior. Personal factors of the individual, such as individual moral thought, emotional reactions to behavior, personal moral conduct, and factors within their environment, all interact with, and affect each other. Social cognitive theory contests, in many ways, with the stage theories of moral reasoning. Social cognitive theory attempts to understand why an individual uses a lower level of moral reasoning when they are, theoretically, at a higher level. It also attempts to explain the way social interactions help to form new, as well as change existing, moral standards. The influence of modeling and other such social factors are explored as functions of growth and development.
Albert Bandura also believes that moral development is best understood by considering a combination of social and cognitive factors, especially those involving self-control.

==Stage theories==

Theories grounded in the belief that different types of moral thinking appears in a sequence, from one way of thinking to another, invariantly, are considered stage theories. Both Kohlberg and Piaget&#x27;s theories about the development of moral reasoning argue that development occurs in stages and that less complex reasoning strategies from lower stages are abandoned in favor of the more complex strategies from the next. In essence, a preference for higher levels of moral thinking is the underlying proposition of stage theories, although what makes higher level moral thinking superior to lower level moral thinking is unclear. However, stage theories tend to downplay the effect of social learning on the individual and the influence the environment can have in certain situations of moral reasoning. For example, even for individuals who are at a higher level stage in their moral development some reasoning may take into consideration the rule of law, some may be concerned with social consequences, and some may yet be concerned with personal feelings. As such, it is possible that developmental trends in moral reasoning do exist but the influence of society and the learning that takes place from it is much too varied to produce uniform moral types in the development of all individuals. Bandura also believed that moral beliefs were formed in child hood during development.

==Bandura&#x27;s view==
Bandura argues that in developing a moral self, individuals adopt standards of right and wrong that serve as guides and restraints for conduct. In this self-regulatory process, people monitor their conduct and the conditions under which it occurs, judge it in relation to moral standards, and regulate their actions by the consequences they apply to themselves. They do things that provide them satisfaction and sense of self-worth. They often refrain from engaging in ways that violate their moral standards in order to avoid self-condemnation. Therefore, self-sanctions keep conducts inline with internal standards. In Bandura&#x27;s view, morality is rooted in self-regulation rather than abstract reasoning. He also argues that moral reasoning follows the same developmental continuum as other mental processes; from concrete to abstract.

==Societal and familial contribution== 
The social cognitive theory of morality argues that personal values and standards of conduct of each individual arise from many different sources of influence and are maintained by institutional promotion. It also argues that a broad and dynamic social reality is what governs the adoption of personal values and standards of conduct. It says that learning from the social environment is a continuous process and personal values and standards that are acquired as the individual develops his/her moral thinking can be elaborated and modified or dropped in favor of new values and standards. The social cognitive theory of morality is interactionist, positing the development of moral reasoning as a product of both the family and general society. Hence, because children are repeatedly exposed to the values and standards of conduct of not only their parents but those of their peers, possible siblings, as well as other adults that they have interaction with in their lives, they tend to develop values and standards that are composites of different features of their familial and social worlds. For instance, research into moral reasoning in individuals who were exposed to chronic childhood trauma has highlighted alterations in how they respond to moral dilemmas. In comparison to healthy women, women with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) due to complex childhood trauma were less likely to approve utilitarian actions in dilemmas involving the infliction of direct physical harm.

==Interacting determinates==
There are three interacting sources of influence; &quot;behavior, cognition and other personal factors, and environmental factors&quot;. Moral conduct is thought to be regulated by the influence of thought and self-imposed sanctions, behavioral conduct, and the society one is a part of. Behavior itself can produce two sets of consequences, &quot;self evaluative reactions and social effects&quot; and these two consequences can be complementary or opposing influences on the behavior of an individual. Often, to increase the compatibility between the personal standards one holds and social standards, individuals will generally choose to interact with others who share their standards. Behavior itself is particularly influenced by external influences, especially in the absences of a strong internal standard. When this is the case, individuals can adopt a &#x27;pragmatic&#x27; style, which makes it possible for them to fit their behavior to the situation they are in. It is also common for individuals&#x27; personal moral standards to come into conflict with societal pressures. However, it is possible for individuals to defend their actions with different types of moral reasoning, even in the face of participating in hurtful or detrimental behavior.

<doc id="929732" wikidata="Q7250901" url="?curid=929732" title="Prosperity certificate">
<text>In 1936, the Alberta Social Credit Party-led government of the Province of Alberta, Canada, introduced prosperity certificates in an attempt to alleviate the effects of the Great Depression. Premier William Aberhart&#x27;s government had won power in the 1935 provincial election partly on the scheme.

The certificates were not issued to the general public as Aberhart had promised in his election platform but instead were used to pay relief workers on provincial public works projects and were put into circulation via special agreements with municipalities.

Although not technically money, each certificate was marked with a value of one dollar, and redeemable for $1 Canadian at the end of its life or on certain dates during the course of the program. Other certificates were in the amount of $5. $239,000 worth of scrip was issued in August 1936.

A goal of the program was to encourage spending and circulation of the spending power. To achieve this, hoarding of the certificates was discouraged by requiring the holder to affix to the back of a certificate a 1¢ stamp every week for the certificate to maintain its validity. Thus people were encouraged to spend whatever certificates they had each week, to avoid having to make too many payments of the one-percent tax. As the program intended, possessors of the certificates tried to avoid having to purchase and affix the stamps, by spending the certificates before the week&#x27;s validity expired. This stamp scrip, innovated by Silvio Gesell, was not part of the theories of Aberhart&#x27;s mentor, social credit founder Major C. H. Douglas.

The hassle and expense of the stamps made the certificates unpopular with the public. The tiny gummed postage-style stamps (smaller than ) were prone to falling off.

Another issue was finding a seller who would accept the unusual currency. The Army &amp; Navy Stores, a chain of department stores, accepted the currency when some other merchants would not. Oddly, the currency was not accepted by the government itself for payment of taxes. 

The notes were intended to be redeemed after two years of issue, when 104 stamps would have been affixed. But the program was cancelled after only about one year. The notes could be returned to the government for redeeming in Canadian currency.

Alberta&#x27;s prosperity certificates have never been listed in the Standard Catalog of World Paper Money.

<doc id="929735" wikidata="Q1259096" url="?curid=929735" title="Case White">
<text>Case White (), also known as the Fourth Enemy Offensive (), was a combined Axis strategic offensive launched against the Yugoslav Partisans throughout occupied Yugoslavia during World War II. It was one of the most significant confrontations of World War II in Yugoslavia. The offensive took place in early 1943, between 20 January and mid-to-late March. The Axis operation prompted the Partisan Supreme Command to enact its plans to drive toward eastern Herzegovina, Sandžak and Montenegro.

In order to do this, Tito formed the so-called Main Operational Group, which eventually succeeded in forcing its way across the Neretva in mid-March 1943, after a series of battles with various hostile formations. Other Partisan formations, the 1st Croatian and 1st Bosnian Corps, managed to evade Axis blows and, despite significant losses, reclaim most of the territory they had held before the beginning of the operation.
Since its final stage took place on the Neretva River, the operation was known in Yugoslavia as the Battle of the Neretva (&quot;Bitka na Neretvi&quot;). This stage is also known as the Battle for the Wounded (&quot;Bitka za ranjenike&quot;).

== Background ==
In late 1942, with the Axis situation in North Africa deteriorating, the German high command became concerned about the possibility of an Allied landing in the Balkans. In such an event, resistance forces in Yugoslavia would be likely to interfere with German defensive operations as well as their economic exploitation of natural resources, including timber, copper and bauxite. As a result, on 16 December 1942 Adolf Hitler ordered the Armed Forces Commander in Southeast Europe, Generaloberst Alexander Löhr, to crush the resistance in Yugoslavia. In a meeting of 18–19 December, the General Staff of the Wehrmacht decided on the destruction of the Bihać Republic. On 8 January Löhr and Mario Roatta, commander of the 2nd Italian Army, met in Zagreb and devised a detailed plan.

== Operation ==
The operation was planned to be carried out in three stages:
* &quot;Weiss&quot; 1 aimed at destroying Partisan-held areas Lika, Kordun, Banija, Cazinska Krajina and Grmeč. It started on 20 January 1943 and lasted until 25 February.
* &quot;Weiss&quot; 2 focused on Partisans in the southeast of the Bihać Republic: Drvar, Glamoč, Livno, Jajce and Ključ.
* &quot;Weiss&quot; 3 was meant to be executed in eastern Herzegovina and Montenegro, targeting mostly the Royalist Chetniks. This phase was cancelled in early February 1943.

The Germans aimed to destroy the central command of the Partisan movement, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia as well as the bulk of the Partisan units around the Supreme Headquarters. The Axis mustered ten divisions equaling 90,000 troops and 12 air squadrons.

Chetnik auxiliaries and units consisting of between 12,000 and 15,000 men also took part and worked closely with the Italians. The operation coincided with the so-called &quot;March on Bosnia&quot;, a plan that called for the use of Chetniks from Lika, northern Bosnia, northern Dalmatia, Herzegovina and Montenegro in order to destroy the Partisan-held territory there. The &quot;March on Bosnia&quot; also called for the ethnic cleansing of the Muslim population in Bosnia and Herzegovina and in Sandžak. According to the Germans, the Chetniks forces comprised 150,000 men in February 1943 (up from 100,000 in August 1942). The Partisans, on the other hand, numbered less than a third of that figure. On 2 January Draža Mihailović reported his plan to the Chetniks for the destruction of the Partisans&#x27; Bihać Republic in order to &quot;liberate this Serb territory from Communist terror&quot;. On the 21st he wrote: &quot;Indeed, the question of Bosnia is most important. In western Bosnia and Lika we are currently making the final preparations for the definitive destruction of the Communists, who are preventing us from destroying Pavelić&#x27;s Croatia&quot;.&quot;

The orders for the operation called for extreme severity towards captured Partisans and the civilian population. The former were to be shot after capture, and civilian populations deemed hostile were to be deported to transit camps. Villages in the combat area were to be razed to the ground. The commanders on the ground were prohibited from punishing their subordinates for excessive harshness.

=== Weiss 1 ===
According to the plan, four German divisions (7th SS Volunteer Mountain, 369th, 714th and 717th) were to attack from the arc stretching from Karlovac across Glina, Kostajnica, Bosanski Novi and Sanski Most towards the line Bihać--Petrovac. Three Italian divisions (&quot;Lombardia&quot;, &quot;Re&quot; and &quot;Sassari&quot;) were to advance on their right wing, through Lika and northern Dalmatia. According to the plan, the 7th SS and 717th Divisions, deployed on the extreme ends of the arc, were to race into the enemy rear with motorized battle groups and meet at Vrtoče on the second day of the operation. The reinforced 369th and 714th Division were to meet them and close the circle around the bulk of the Partisan forces in the area of the Grmeč mountain. In the final stage, three divisions were supposed to destroy the encircled Partisans, and to deport the population to prevent the possibility of the revival of guerrilla activity in the area.

German divisions were reinforced with the 202nd Tank Battalion and 2nd and 3rd Home Guard Mountain Brigade. Italian divisions used the Lika, Dalmatia and Herzegovina Chetnik auxiliaries, three Ustasha (31st, 32nd and 34th) and one (2nd Jäger) Home Guard battalions. On 8 January the 2nd and 5th Krajina Brigades moved to Kozara and launched a series of attacks on the NDH garrisons and posts in Lijevče polje. Since these activities coincided with the attacks of the 1st Proletarian Division in central Bosnia, Gen. Lüters decided to redeploy the 714th division to the defense of the Banja Luka area. As the 718th Division was already engaged in fighting the Partisans in central and eastern Bosnia, Lüters reinforced the 369th Division with one regimental combat group of the 187th Reserve Division.

==== Partisan defense ====
The attacks from all directions began on 20 January, but none of the divisions succeeded in keeping the original schedule. The Axis forces attacked the territory controlled by the Partisan 1st Croatian and 1st Bosnian Corps—the areas of Banija, Kordun, Lika and western Bosnia. On the Karlovac-Bihać axis, four Partisan brigades were defending against the attack of the 7th SS Division: 4th and 15th Brigades of the 8th Kordun Division and 6th and 14th Littoral-Gorski Kotar Brigades. The 7th Banija Division was successful in containing the advance of the 369th Division from Glina and Kostajnica towards Cazin and Bosanska Krupa. The 6th Lika Division successfully held the line Plitvička Jezera–Gračac against Italian attacks.

The 717th Division encountered difficulties while advancing on Bosanski Petrovac from Sanski Most. The Division launched its attack on 20 January with the 749th Regiment and elements of the 202nd Tank Battalion. Despite air support, it was halted by the 1st Krajina and one battalion of the 7th Krajina Brigade some 10 km south of Sanski Most. The division&#x27;s 737th Regiment was in reserve, standing ready to exploit a breakthrough, but the 749th Regiment failed to make one. Over the following days both sides stepped up their efforts, building up strength at the key point; the Partisans remained successful in blocking German attacks, while launching fierce night counterattacks. The 717th Division tried a diversionary attack from Sanski Most westwards with the 2nd Mountain Home Guard Brigade. On 25 January this battle group of two Home Guard battalions and one German company was attacked by the 1st Battalion of the 6th and the 3rd Battalion of the 1st Krajina Brigade, and was routed with heavy losses. The Partisans seized weaponry including 40 light and 10 heavy machine guns and four mountain and one anti-tank cannons. Gen. Dippold, commander of the 717th Division, reported to Gen. Lüters that on 26 January the 2nd Home Guard Brigade was completely shattered, and that the remnants of the 2nd and 4th battalions were absorbed into 749th Grenadier Regiment. A more ambitious westward attack was launched on 27 January with the reinforced 737th Regiment, which reached Benakovac before being halted by the 6th Krajina Brigade. In the meantime, the 2nd and 5th Krajina Brigades arrived from Kozara as reinforcements, and the 737th Regiment suddenly found itself in a difficult situation. Seeing no alternative, the regiment set up an all-around defense; it remained cut off and under attack until 3 February.

Simultaneously, the 717th Division resumed the attack on the main enemy forces towards Ključ and Bosanski Petrovac. The attack was scheduled to begin in the early hours of 28 January, but battalions of the 1st Krajina Brigade succeeded in surprising the Germans during the night with a preventive attack at their starting positions, scattering their units. The next day the Germans launched an attack led by tanks with the intention of collecting weapons and stragglers, but Partisan anti-tank fire destroyed the first tank, killing the commander of the 202nd Tank Battalion, Lt.

==== Attack on Grmeč ====
The Partisan defense line, which had withstood most of the German attacks to that point, was finally compromised by the advance of the 7th SS Division. This unit, with the help of two Italian divisions on the right flank, steadily pushed back the four Partisan brigades, capturing Slunj on 24 January and Rakovica on the 27th. As a result, Bihać came under threat and had to be evacuated, and Germans entered it on 29 January without a fight. This turn of events also compromised the position of the 7th Partisan Division in the Banija region. It was ordered to withdraw and occupy a new line in front of the 7th SS Division, covering the Bihać-Petrovac axis. Thousands of refugees left Banija together with the Partisan units, suffering from air attacks, hunger, frost and disease along the way.

The 7th SS Division continued to push towards Petrovac, against Partisan defenses consisting mainly of the 7th Banija Division. It took another ten days to cover those 50 km. The 7th SS Division reached Petrovac on 7 February, and on 9 February finally managed to link up with the 717th Division, thereby fulfilling the task originally scheduled for the second day of the operation. The 369th Division and the 3rd Home Guard Mountain Brigade, facing only Partisan rearguards, reached Bosanska Krupa on 30 January and relieved the encircled 737th Regiment at Benakovac a few days later. The 369th joined with the 7th SS near Bihać on 4 February. With this, the broader area of Grmeč was encircled by three German divisions. On 6 February, after they had received reinforcements, the 369th, 187th and 717th Division started their attack on Grmeč. The 2nd and 5th Krajina Brigades were caught in the encirclement, along with some 15,000 inhabitants. On 10 February the brigades made the decision to break out of the encirclement, and succeeded in opening the way over the Krupa-Sanski Most road toward Potkalinje. The inhabitants followed the brigades, but a large number (up to 2,000) succumbed to the freezing weather. Some 400 remaining civilians were killed by the Germans.

According to a German report from 18 February for Weiss 1, the 7th SS Division suffered losses of 149 dead, 222 wounded and 68 missing, and the 717th Division&#x27;s casualties were 118 dead, 290 wounded and 20 missing. The same report puts the Partisan losses at 6,561 dead, but adds that only 286 rifles were captured. This drastic imbalance between the figures suggests that those killed were mainly civilians.

=== Partisan Offensive ===
During the first half of 1942 the Partisans were expelled from the eastern parts of Yugoslavia, and the Axis powers largely succeeded in pacifying these areas. The Partisans established a stronghold in the western parts of the country, but returning to the east remained one of their main objectives. Localization of guerrilla activity enabled the Germans to leave the control of pacified areas to second-tier forces, and to concentrate their best units in the endangered areas. The 714th, 717th and 7th SS Divisions (all in west Bosnia in January 1943) were all originally deployed in Serbia. Tito started with the plans for a march to the east in early autumn 1942. The original idea was to start the large movement in the spring, but signs of an imminent Axis offensive in January 1943 made Tito order the commencement of the operation without delay.
The operation was to be carried out in three stages: the first was an advance to Neretva, the second was from Neretva to Drina, and the third from Drina to the river Lim, and further to the south-east. The main intention was to revive Partisan presence and activities in these areas. On 8 February in Tomislavgrad, Tito presented the plan for the first stage in a conference with the staffs of the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Division, and issued the necessary orders and directives.

The execution of the offensive was facilitated by the fact that the main forces Tito was counting on for the operation (the 1st and 2nd Proletarian and 3rd Shock Division) were deployed outside the area affected by the operation Weiss 1. The most distant unit, the 1st Proletarian Division, was ordered to begin preparing for a start-off march in late January. The main Partisan force was divided into three columns:
*Right Column—the (2nd Proletarian Division) was to advance over Imotski, Posušje and Drežnica with the aim of cutting off communications in the Neretva valley, and protecting the right flank of the Partisan main force against the enemy garrison at Mostar.
*Central Column—the (3rd Shock Division) had the most difficult task: to capture Gornji Vakuf, Prozor, Ostrožac on Neretva and Konjic, and to open the way across the Neretva at Konjic.
*Left Column—the (1st Proletarian Division) was ordered to advance over Gornji Vakuf, Solakova Kula, Bradina and Ivan sedlo, protecting the right flank of the Partisan main force against the enemy garrison at Mostar, destroy all traffic installations between Konjic and Sarajevo and provide protection for the Partisan northern flank against possible enemy intervention from Sarajevo by securing the main mountain pass of Ivan Sedlo.

7th Banija Division was tasked with acting as the group&#x27;s rearguard and protecting the recently formed &quot;Central Hospital&quot; with some 4,000 sick and wounded. The hospital was created in order to provide protection to the wounded, since they were routinely targeted for execution by the Axis. The existence of the &quot;Central Hospital&quot; had a profound impact on the course and outcome of future operations.

The Right Column (2nd Proletarian Division) started its advance with easy victories over NDH garrisons in Posušje and Imotski on 9 and 10 February. On 15 February it reached Neretva and attacked a small Italian garrison in Drežinca. The 1st Battalion of the 260th Regiment of the Division Murge intervened from Mostar, but was almost completely annihilated (120 dead and 286 captured, including the Commander, Lt. Col. Francesco Metella), on 16 February with the loss of all its equipment. The Partisans sent a messenger to Mostar to propose a prisoner exchange, but the exchange did not happen.

With this success, the 2nd Division wrested control over the Neretva valley north of Mostar from enemy forces, and severed all contact between the city and Italian garrisons to the north. The Italian Command concluded that the Mostar garrison was endangered, and decided to mobilize immediately all available Chetnik units. Originally, the Italians had agreed not to use the Chetniks from Montenegro on the territory of the NDH, but now had to reverse their decision in the face of the looming threat to their interests in Herzegovina. The 2nd Proletarian Division, for its part, felt confident in its new position. As it had fulfilled its main task, the Division sent its 4th Proletarian Brigade to the north in order to assist the Central Column.

In the opening phase the Central Column (3rd Division) captured Gornji Vakuf on 30 January, and by 8 February was making preparations for an attack on the Prozor garrison. Prozor was defended by the 3rd Battalion of the Italian 259th Regiment, reinforced with some infantry and artillery units, along with a company of L3 light tanks. The town was heavily fortified with a large number of stone and concrete bunkers surrounded by wire obstacles and covered by a well-organized fire system. The Partisan attack began on the evening of 15 February, but failed due to the fierce resistance of the garrison.

After receiving reinforcements, the 3rd Division made another attempt and the second attack ultimately succeeded. The Italian garrison was destroyed, with 120 killed and 220 captured. Partisans also captured four 100 mm howitzers, two 47 mm anti-tank guns, nine 81 mm mortars and 12 heavy and 25 light machine-guns. All of the tanks were captured or destroyed: nine of them were captured in the Prozor area, and two were captured later in Ostrožac, and all eleven were used for the formation of the Tank Company of the Supreme Command. The Italian reinforcements sent earlier that day were also destroyed: the 1st Battalion of the 260th Regiment near Drežnica, and a company of 1st Battalion of the 259th Regiment, sent from Konjic, was destroyed near Prozor.

According to the popular myth, on the eve of the attack, a conference in the 3rd Division HQ was interrupted by the arrival of a courier with a note from Tito (who was in nearby Šćit). The note simply read: &quot;Prozor must fall tonight&quot; (Prozor noćas mora pasti). Historical records and participants&#x27; memories are divided on the subject, but the phrase became popular, and entered into everyday speech and pop culture.

The offensive continued with the 10th Herzegovina Brigade of the 3rd Partisan Division attacking and routing a company from the 1st Battalion of the 259th Regiment in Rama on 20 February, inflicting losses of 183 killed and 7 captured Italian soldiers. On 22 February, the 5th Proletarian Brigade of the same division captured Ostrožac on Neretva.
In the meantime, the 4th Proletarian Brigade from the Right Column captured a further 270 Italians, 140 of which were in the town of Jablanica, which was taken on 22 February. Among the captured were Lieutenant Colonel Pelleroni, commander of the Jablanica garrison, and Colonel Malantonio, Commander of the 259th Regiment. Colonel Malantonio was shot after the Partisans had determined that he was a prominent member of the Fascist Party, and that he had taken part in the Spanish Civil War as an officer in the Italian Corpo Truppe Volontarie. With the fall of Jablanica, Partisans were in control of the entire Neretva valley between Mostar and Ivan Sedlo; only the strategically important town of Konjic was still in Italian hands.

The Left Column (1st Proletarian Division) was only partially concentrated, but decided to go ahead with the plan using only two of its brigades. The main objectives on the Sarajevo-Konjic railway line, Ivan sedlo and Raštelica, were defended by the Ustaša Railroad Battalion, and important railroad objects Bradina, Lukač and Brđani were defended by up to a company strong Italian units in strong fortifications. The 1st Proletarian Brigade captured the important mountain pass Ivan Sedlo and Raštelica station on 17 February by a coup de main. The Italian fortifications were overcome on 18 February, after some artillery and mortar fire exchanges, and after an intervention attempt by an armored train from Konjic had been repulsed. In that situation, with no enemy activity from Sarajevo, the 1st Proletarian Brigade headquarters made a critical error in judgment by sending two battalions to attack the railway station Tarčin near Sarajevo, and the remaining two battalions on a surprise attack attempt on Konjic, thus leaving the most important objective in its area, the Ivan sedlo mountain pass, virtually unoccupied.

The surprise raid on Konjic was conceived with the intention of exploiting the demoralization among the Italians, and with the hope of establishing contact with the 5th Brigade of the 3rd Division for a joint attack. But, the contact was not established, and in the night on 19/20 February, two battalions of the 1st Proletarian Brigade attacked the main target of the whole Partisan operation, the Konjic garrison, unsupported. The attack had some initial success, and the defenders were thrown back from the right bank of the river. However, since only two partisan companies managed to cross the river and enter the town center, they were easily halted by heavy mortar and artillery fire. Seeing that no progress was being made by dawn, the Brigade Headquarters cancelled the attack.

The other two battalions of the brigade attacked Tarčin on the night 20/21 February. The attack coincided with the arrival of the German reinforcements from Sarajevo. As the Partisans were outnumbered, the Germans succeeded in throwing them back, and resuming their movement towards Ivan sedlo. The appearance of German units in Tarčin marked the beginning of the Weiss Mostar operation.

=== Weiss Mostar ===
By the third week of February the Partisans had managed to breach the Italian blockade along the Neretva River, thus compromising one of the main aspects of the operational plan for Weiss 2. Worst of all, the Partisans captured Posušje and endangered the wider Mostar area, which provided the German war industry with 10 percent of its bauxite ore needs. Since Italian troops were seemingly incapable of containing the situation, the German Command was compelled to adjust the operational plans accordingly. It was decided to deploy 718th Division immediately to the endangered areas, even before Weiss 2 was launched.

The 718th Division started its attack on 19 February, with one column advancing from Bugojno towards Gornji Vakuf and Prozor, and the other from Sarajevo towards Konjic. Jablanica was the ultimate objective of both pincer arms. The column from Bugojno, named &quot;Battle Group Vogel&quot;, consisted of the 738th Regiment (minus one battalion), the 5th Ustaša Brigade (the so-called Black Legion) and artillery. It captured Gornji Vakuf on 22 February, and then found itself stuck in a ten-day-long battle against the reinforced 7th Banija Division in front of Prozor.

The column from Sarajevo (named &quot;Battle Group Annacker&quot;), consisted of the 750th Regiment (minus one battalion), two battalions of the 7th Home Guard Regiment, one Ustaša battalion, artillery, and one platoon of tanks. It was this battle group which attacked two battalions of the 1st Proletarian Brigade in Tarčin on 21 February. The group repulsed the Partisan attack on Tarčin, threw back Partisan battalions, and on the same day reached Ivan sedlo and Raštelica. After regrouping, the Partisans reclaimed their positions on the Ivan sedlo on the next day, but a substantial part of the battle group, including one German and one Home Guard battalion, an Ustaša company, and a number of tanks, succeeded in breaking through to Konjic on 22 February. They arrived just in time to decisively strengthen the garrison before a major Partisan attack. The commander of the 1st Proletarian Brigade Danilo Lekić had to answer in person to Tito for the failure of his brigade to seal off the approaches to the lower Neretva Valley.

=== Attack on Konjic ===
The fact that Konjic controlled the only road leading to Eastern Herzegovina (the rest of the eastern bank of Neretva to the south of the town being dominated by the virtually unpassable Prenj mountain), made it the prime objective of the Partisan army. The Konjic garrison originally consisted of the 1st Battalion of the 259th Regiment with artillery elements and other units. During the fighting at Prozor, Rama and Jablanica, parts of the Konjic garrison were sent as reinforcements, and were destroyed. Division Murge, as a whole, in one week suffered losses of some 2,300 men, and was affected by panic and demoralization, and this caused a lot of optimism among Partisans. But, immediately before the main Partisan attack, a two and a half battalion strong vanguard of the Battle Group Annacker entered the town. At the same time, some 3,000 strong Chetnik formation under Lukačević reached the town, and, in agreement with the garrison, assumed positions around the town. This way, it unexpectedly became a very difficult obstacle for the whole Partisan Main Operational Group.

The 3rd Division decided to storm the town by using two of its brigades (the third remained in Prozor), with one (the 5th Montenegro Brigade) attacking along the right bank of the river, and the second (the 10th Herzegovina Brigade) along the left. The hastily organized attack began in the evening of 22 February. Due to insufficient intelligence, the 10th Brigade ran into strong Chetnik resistance on the eastern bank and could barely reach the town before dawn. On the opposite bank, the 5th Brigade faced stiff resistance by German and Italian forces, achieving little success. As a result, the 3rd Division saw no alternative but to cancel the attack by the morning of the 23rd.

For the next attempt, on 24 February in the evening, the attacking forces were reinforced with the 4th Montenegro Brigade from the 2nd Proletarian Division, and the Tank Company of the Supreme Headquarters. The attack went on through the night, and resumed the next night, but to no avail. In a report, Germans praised the &quot;help of the brave Chetniks&quot;.

As the blockade of the Ivan Sedlo Pass by the 1st Proletarian Division seemed to be holding, and no further parts of the battle group Annaker reached Konjic, Tito decided to send another brigade. Early on 26 February, the 3rd Krajina Brigade left its positions around Prozor, and started the march to the embattled town. However, after only a few hours, it was summoned back. The appearance of the 717th Infantry Division (now attacking Prozor instead of Livno, as originally envisaged by the plan for Weiss 2) on the flank of battle group Vogel endangered the whole western front of the NOVJ; the Central Hospital at Šćit was now directly exposed to the German onslaught. Consequently, the attack on Konjic, using additional forces from the Prozor area, had to be cancelled.

At this stage, Tito and his HQ had suddenly found themselves facing an entirely different situation from the one they faced only days earlier. By 20 February, the prospects looked good for the &quot;Main Operational Group&quot;: all but one Italian garrison in the Neretva Valley were destroyed and the road to Eastern Herzegovina looked open. Now, the road was blocked by unexpectedly strong resistance in Konjic, and the Partisan army was hemmed in the narrow Neretva valley surrounded on all sides by strong enemy forces: On 25 February the Germans launched Weiss 2, attacking Drvar, Glamoč and Livno with two divisions; the Italians in Mostar regrouped, and fielded two battle groups with Chetnik support up the river; further strong Chetnik concentrations were detected on the eastern bank of the Neretva. Consequently, the plans had to be revised, and tough decisions had to be made.

=== Weiss 2 ===
Based on the gathered intelligence, German command concluded that Livno was the center of the southeastern half of the Partisan territory. For that reason, Weiss 2 had been conceived as a concentric attack on Livno, with the assumption that the Partisans would be pushed back, encircled and destroyed there. In the meantime, the situation had changed. The Partisans broke into the Neretva valley, and their main concentration was now between Prozor and Konjic. In spite of this, German command largely proceeded with the original plan. In light of the recent developments, however, first one (718th), and after a week another (717th) division were directed towards the new flashpoint.

Two divisions, the 7th SS and the 369th, were used for the Weiss 2 operation. Their advance commenced on 25 February. The route assigned to the 7th SS Division was from Bosanski Petrovac, over Drvar and Bosansko Grahovo to Livno, while the 369th Division had to cover the route from Mrkonjić-Grad over Mliništa and Glamoč to Livno. In front of them stood six (out of ten) brigades of the Partisan 1st Bosnian Corps. The plan of the Corps Headquarters did not call for decisive defense. The units would put up just enough resistance to allow the units and the population to be evacuated, and would thereafter merely evade the German advancing columns. The 7th SS division captured Drvar on 28 February, and continued towards Grahovo, pushing back the 8th, 9th and 10th Krajina Brigades. On the road to Glamoč, the 4th and 7th Krajina Brigades were slowing down the 369th Division. As the 7th SS Division reached Grahovo, and the 369th, Glamoč, on 2 March, the Corps Headquarters decided to perform the evasion maneuver, and the brigades, together with a mass of the refugees, commenced their march over Šator Mountain towards Rore, and back to the Krajina. The freezing weather and deep snow meant this march over the high mountain area cost many civilian lives. The Germans invested large efforts in pursuing the Partisans through the mountain, but the Partisans remained elusive, and the only result was the capture of a number of exhausted refugees.

After this maneuver, all the units of the 1st Bosnia Corps found themselves out of reach of the advancing Germans, except the 7th and 9th Krajina Brigades. They were temporarily subordinated directly to the Supreme HQ which had ordered them to slow down the German advance towards Neretva. On 5 March, the two German divisions had finally reached Livno and taken it without a fight. After several days of rest, the 7th SS Division resumed its movements to the Mostar bauxite area without Partisan interference and the 369th Division headed towards Jablanica.

Further to the south, the group of Herzegovina Chetnik units under Baćović was marching from Split towards Neretva. This group had been transported by the Italians by sea and land to Knin in December 1942 in order to fight the Partisans in Lika. In early February 1943, the group was first returned to Split and were then ordered to make an overland march to Neretva. While passing through the Biokovo hinterland, the group committed numerous crimes against the civilian population. Around Vrgorac, the group encountered the elements of the 9th Partisan (Dalmatian) Division. The division, deployed in the broader area of Imotski, was already under pressure from the east (Italian regimental battle group &quot;Scotti&quot; from Mostar) and the south-east (Montenegro Chetniks under Vesković from Ljubuški). Facing such odds, the division had to retreat towards Jablanica, where it became a part of the Main Operational Group.

=== Battle of Neretva ===
In the last days of February, Tito&#x27;s Main Operational Group found itself in a critical position with no open road remaining. On the one side it was stuck in front of the stubborn defense of the Konjic garrison, and on the other, it was exposed to the mounting pressure on Prozor. There was also constant pressure from the reinforced parts of the 718th division from Sarajevo, increasing pressure of the Italian-Chetnik battlegroups from Mostar, build-up of further Chetnik forces on the eastern bank of Neretva, and a further two German divisions (7th SS and 369th) were approaching from the west. Alarming news about the imminent threat to the Central Hospital was arriving in Tito&#x27;s HQ on a daily basis.
In that situation, Tito took the tactical command firmly in his hands. On 28 February he decided to reverse the direction of the attack, and, instead of pushing over Neretva, decided to strike hard at the Germans pressuring Prozor. According to this new direction, he ordered the Pioneer Company to destroy all the bridges across the Neretva, which was done between 1 and 4 March. He also ordered all the forces to concentrate attacks against Gornji Vakuf, with only necessary rearguards left on the Neretva.
==== Counterattack at Gornji Vakuf ====
The counterattack began not a minute too soon. The 717th Division and the battlegroup Vogel were attacking along the Gornji Vakuf – Prozor road with the main column, while trying to circumvent the partisan defense with flanking columns over Pidriš and Vilića gumno, intending to capture the important pass at Makljen. On 2 March at dawn, the 4th Proletarian Brigade, led by its 2nd Battalion, bypassing the columns of the wounded from the Central Hospital, reached Vilića gumno, and assumed positions in the deep snow, 30 to 50 meters from German lines, to be attacked almost immediately by the German 749th Regiment. After several hours of defense, the Brigade charged the enemy positions and pushed the Germans back down the slopes of the Raduša mountain. The fighting was intense and dramatic, under difficult circumstances, and the losses were serious. The report for that day counted 51 killed, 83 wounded, 21 missing and 31 cases of frostbite. On the other side, 3rd Company of the 2nd Battalion fell down to only 8 men. For this success, the 2nd Battalion and its commander Niko Strugar were officially commended by Tito.

During 2 and 3 March, brigades were arriving in Prozor and assuming their positions along the line of fire. On 4 March, a full-scale Partisan counterattack was launched with all nine brigades. Five brigades were attacking German positions frontally, and the remaining four were trying to circumvent the flanks. The Germans were pushed back all the way to near Bugojno, and they remained there waiting and preparing for defense until 8 March. In the fight on 4 March the 2nd Proletarian Brigade captured Major Strecker, Commander of the 3rd Battalion of the 738th Regiment, and in the following days used him to propose a prisoner exchange and talks on some other subjects to the Germans. This led to the famous March negotiations.

==== Forcing the way over Neretva ====

The German Command was confused and worried by the successful Partisan attack at Gornji Vakuf. On the assumption that the Partisans would continue their advance towards Bugojno, General Lüters ordered the 369th Division to the area on 6 March, noting in the War diary that &quot;the key error (was) G.Vakuf&quot;. However, Tito was not pleased with the prospects of the advance/retreat to the Vrbas valley, fearing the Partisans would thus merely exchange one cauldron for another. In light of these considerations, and much to the surprise of his closest associates, Tito ordered a 180-degree turn and re-directed the bulk of his army back to the Neretva.

The key role in forcing the way over Neretva was assigned to the 2nd Dalmatian Brigade. During the Gornji Vakuf counterattack preparations, the brigade was left on the Neretva as a rearguard. After the counter-attack had been launched, the brigade commander Ljubo Vučković did not consider the possibility of return to the river, and consequently ordered the evacuation of Jablanica, deploying his unit on the hills outside the town. However, on March 4, Tito summoned him to a meeting, criticized him for leaving Jablanica, and ordered him to reoccupy the town immediately. Furthermore, Vučković was instructed to cross the Neretva with his unit the following night, clear the Chetniks from the eastern bank, and secure a bridgehead.

The reoccupation of Jablanica turned out to be easier than previously thought. As the Tank Company of the Supreme HQ was available, it was ordered to spearhead the attack. The town was held by two battalions of the Durmitor Chetnik Brigade. After seeing tanks, the Chetniks assumed that it was the Italian relief column, and moved out to meet them. The Partisans took advantage of the Chetnik confusion and opened fire, causing them to panic and run away. The 2nd Dalmatian Brigade spent the whole day considering various options for crossing the river. Since the pioneer detachment did not come until late in the evening, Vučković informed the Supreme Command that it would be impossible to cross the Neretva during the same night. On the following day, 6 March, the brigade was reinforced by the 2nd Proletarian Brigade. Under the cover of darkness, one group of 12 men from the 2nd Company of the 3rd Battalion of the 2nd Dalmatian crossed the skeleton of the railway bridge and began climbing up the steep eastern bank. The Chetniks occupying the bunker above the bridge sensed something was afoot and began firing blindly, killing two soldiers. The remaining ten men succeeded in reaching the top of the cliff and destroying the bunker with hand grenades. Once this obstacle was out of the way, the rest of the battalion followed, and after it two battalions from the 2nd Proletarian Brigade. On the following day, these three battalions scattered the Chetnik Durmitor Brigade, causing its soldiers to flee deep to the rear where they spread panic among other Chetnik units. With this success, the bridgehead was secured, and the pioneers started their work on the construction of the new improvised bridge, resting on the skeleton of the old one.

Tito&#x27;s new plan was to push the Germans back from Prozor to gain some space and breathing room, and then to cross the Neretva at Jablanica as fast as possible. The renewal of attacks on Konjic was not envisaged. Instead of using the road running through Konjic, the bulk of the Main Operational Group, with the Central Hospital and other non-combat units, was to cross the Prenj Mountain range right across the river at Konjic. As it was impossible to take along the tanks, trucks and heavy artillery, these were simply dumped into the river. One of the necessary preconditions for this maneuver was the tight blockade of the town. After the 1st Proletarian Brigade had left the Ivan sedlo Pass to participate in the Gornji Vakuf counterattack, the bulk of the 718th Division, together with its headquarters, reinforced the garrison at Konjic. These forces were exerting pressure on the Partisan rearguards throughout the first days of March, and ultimately succeeded in pushing them back across Neretvica, some 10 km to the west of the town. On 5 March, the commander of the 3rd Partisan Division, , received an order to push the Germans back to the town, and seal-off the garrison for good. In fighting from 5 to 9 March, the Partisans reclaimed Ostrožac and other positions on Neretva, throwing the Germans back to their original positions.

The final push over Neretva was to be carried out in the following fashion: 
*3rd Division on the left flank, with the task of blockading Konjic.
*2nd Division reinforced with the 1st Proletarian Brigade, as the central column, had the task of crossing the northern slopes of Prenj, toward Glavatičevo and Crvanj mountain, to reach the upper Neretva at Ulog and Obalj.
*7th Division with its two brigades was deployed on the right flank, with the task of making the river crossing at Jablanica, circumventing Prenj from the south, and blocking the road from Mostar at Zijemlje.
*1st Division with the 7th Krajina Brigade (which replaced the 1st Proletarian), was to act as the rearguard, slowing down the German advance from Bugojno towards Jablanica, and securing the main crossing point.
*9th Division had the task of denying the enemy access to Neretva from the south and south-west.

In order to counter this strategic &quot;checkmate&quot; Tito prepared an elaborate deception. He ordered his sappers to actually blow up all the bridges on the river. When air reconnaissance brought this information to the German command, they concluded that the Partisans must be preparing a final dash north of their current position (along the western shore of the Neretva), and had blown up the bridge to prevent desertion as well as attack by Chetnik forces from the other side of the river. They thus began a redeployment of troops in the area to block the anticipated movement.

This redeployment gave the Partisan engineers precious time needed to sufficiently repair the bridge and to eliminate the Chetnik troops defending its far side. The Germans, characteristically, quickly caught on, but were unable to correct their mistake and prepare a serious attack in time, because of their previous redeployment orders. With their rearguard fighting off an increasingly powerful German advance, the Partisans crossed the river under intense aerial bombardment (the Axis deployed large &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; formations), but the mountainous landscape prevented accurate destruction of the makeshift bridge. After the escape was complete, the weak bridge was finally rendered useless to prevent pursuit. The humiliating strategic defeat was amplified by Tito being able to keep his well-known pledge not to leave the wounded behind, as they faced certain execution at the hands of the Axis (which later actually happened in the aftermath of the Battle of the Sutjeska).

The operation marked the &quot;high point of Chetnik collaboration with the Axis powers&quot;. In order to ensure the operation&#x27;s success, Draža Mihailović relocated from Montenegro to Kalinovik where Zaharije Ostojić, commander of operations in Herzegovina, was situated. On 9 March, Mihailović informed Colonel Bajo Stanišić: 
The Chetniks would have been disarmed by Germans if they had succeeded against Partisans in Case White.

== Aftermath ==
By the end of March, the Germans claimed to have killed about 11,915 Partisans, executed 616, and captured 2,506. Despite these heavy losses and a tactical victory for the Axis powers, the partisan formations secured their command and the hospital, and were able to continue operations. In fact, once they reached the eastern parts of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Partisans had to face only the Chetniks, and in turn almost entirely incapacitated them in the area west of the Drina river.

The next major operation in Yugoslavia was Operation Schwarz.

== In popular culture ==
The 1969 Oscar-nominated motion picture &quot;The Battle of Neretva&quot; depicts these events.

Alistair MacLean&#x27;s 1968 thriller novel &quot;Force 10 From Navarone&quot;, subsequently filmed, also brings forth the fight of outnumbered Partisans against Germans and Chetniks, and the blowing up of the Neretva bridge. But the actual historical events are not in play, and the story is entirely fictional.

<text>Southern Utah University (SUU) is a public university in Cedar City, Utah, United States. Founded in 1897 as a normal school, Southern Utah University now has over 1,800 graduates each year with baccalaureate and other graduate degrees from its six colleges. SUU offers more than 140 undergraduate and 19 graduate programs. More than 15,000 students attend SUU.

SUU&#x27;s 17 athletic teams compete in Division I of the NCAA and are collectively known as the Thunderbirds. SUU joined the Western Athletic Conference in July 2022.

Southern Utah University alumni include U.S. Governors, members of the United States Congress, Olympians, athletes in the NFL, Golden Globe and Academy Award Winners.

==History==

=== Branch Normal School ===

In the spring of 1897, Cedar City was notified it had been chosen as the site for the &quot;Branch Normal School&quot;, the first teaching training school in southern Utah. For the next three months, citizens labored to complete Ward Hall on Main Street for the first school year. In September, the school opened its doors.

From January through July they continued their labors and when September 1898 arrived, Old Main was almost completed. It had a large chapel for religious assemblies, a library and reading room, a natural history museum, biological and physical laboratories, classrooms, and offices.

Milton Bennion was first principal for the Branch Normal School. Bennion brought a code of integrity to the students of BNS. He established a self-governing student body. Bennion directed 161 students during his time as principal.

The BNS started classes with four teachers, now known as the Founding Four. Bennion, who acted as principal, taught history, geography, and physiology classes during his three-year tenure before he left in 1900 to teach at the University of Utah. Howard R. Driggs acted as the first English professor at BNS until 1905. During his career, Driggs was both a professor of English education and a historian of the American West. SUU still honors his name with the Howard R. Driggs Collection located in the Gerald R. Sherratt Library and plays host to semi-annual lectures by national scholars. The third, George W. Decker, was a southern Utah native and was adamant about teaching from the student&#x27;s point of view rather from a book. Students loved him so much that a request by the student body to proper authorities was the turning point leading to his appointment as the fourth principal of BNS. Annie Elizabeth Spencer Milne was also on the original BNS staff. She taught physical education and started the school&#x27;s first basketball team.

Porter remained BNS principal until 1904, when George W. Decker took the position. Decker was among the first four faculty members at BNS and also the first southern Utah native to take the position. He served the school for 16 years, seven on the faculty and nine as principal before he was elected to the office of state representative.

===Branch Agriculture College===
Roy F. Homer became principal in 1913 and ushered BNS into the next stage as the &quot;Branch Agricultural College&quot; (BAC). BAC was a branch school of the Utah State Agriculture College (now Utah State University). BAC received its third building in 1927 as the Women&#x27;s Gymnasium—now known as the Hunter Conference Center. It was then that ties were created between the school and Zion National Park that are still intact, raising the quality of classes, increasing enrollment, and creating the school&#x27;s first Greek societies.

===College of Southern Utah===
In 1951, Daryl Chase became president and was responsible for the schools heightened vision and name change to the &quot;College of Southern Utah&quot; (CSU). The next college president was Royden C. Braithwaite, who took office in 1955. During his tenure, CSU campus almost doubled in acreage. Of the 28 structures on campus at the time of his death in 1991, very few had not been built or renovated under his direction. He oversaw the construction of the Library (now the Auditorium) in 1955, the Science Building (now the General Classroom Building) in 1961, the Music Center in 1967, and an additional Library (now the Electronic Learning Center) in 1969.

A monumental addition to the College of Southern Utah was the birth of the Utah Shakespeare Festival in 1961 by Fred C. Adams. In its first season it attracted 3,276 visitors and in 2012 it reached 130,000.

===Southern Utah State College===
In 1969, Braithwaite oversaw the school&#x27;s name change to &quot;Southern Utah State College&quot;. He also coined the school&#x27;s motto “Learning Lives Forever” and student enrollment grew from 360 to 2000. Orville D. Carnahan took over in 1978; during his three-year tenure he led the institution in an expansion of academic offerings.

The largest expansion of growth happened under the direction of Gerald R. Sherratt who was president from 1982 until 1997. During his time he oversaw the creation of the Business Building in 1982 and the Centrum in 1985.

===Southern Utah University===

On February 14, 1990, the Utah State Legislature signed into law a bill to change the name of Southern Utah State College to Southern Utah University, with an effective date of January 1, 1991. Upon reaching university status, President Sherratt was able to receive funding to construct 14 other buildings during his tenure. Sherratt also helped with the launching of the Utah Summer Games and the athletic program achieving NCAA Division I status.

Michael T. Benson became president in 2007. Benson received his master&#x27;s degree from Notre Dame and his doctorate from University of Oxford. During his time as president, he championed the most ambitious fundraising campaign in SUU history, raising more than $90 million of the $100 million goal, including the three largest donations in SUU history. He also oversaw the construction of the new Science Center, Cedar Hall, and the Carter Carillon. President Benson heightened academic standards and increased resources for instruction, significantly raised retention rates, and realigned SUU Athletics in the Big Sky Conference. In 2011, the Board of Higher Education (then the Board of Regents) approved Southern Utah University’s mission change and designation as Utah’s designated public liberal arts and sciences university.
President Benson concluded his tenure at SUU and Scott L. Wyatt succeeded him in November 2013. Between 2013 and 2014 Wyatt finalized an unprecedented funding campaign, ending in the groundbreaking of the Beverly Taylor Sorensen Center for the Arts in March 2014. He would also go on to launch a 3-year bachelor&#x27;s degree program in 2020. In March 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, SUU shifted almost completely to remote learning for the remainder of the fall and summer 2020 semesters along with the other public universities in Utah. After Wyatt accepted a position in the Utah System of Higher Education Office of the Commissioner, Mindy Benson was named interim president in August 2021. Benson went on to be named the 17th president, the institution&#x27;s first female president.

==Administration==
Since 1969, three administrative bodies have governed SUU: the President&#x27;s Council, the Board of Trustees, and ultimately the Utah Boards of Regents. The President&#x27;s Council consists of eight top SUU administrators. These groups convene regularly to discuss issues of top importance to the university and help advise the president on executive decisions. The Board of Trustees, created by the Higher Education Act of 1969, is an integral part of the Utah System of Higher Education. The Board of Trustees help facilitate communication between the institution and community, strengthen alumni traditions and goals, select recipient of honorary degrees, and implement and execute fundraising and developmental projects. The Utah Board of Regents is composed of 20 Utah residents, appointed by the governor for six-year terms, and oversees all institutes of higher education in the state of Utah.

==Academics==
In May 2013, SUU had 8,000 students and 261 full-time faculty members, and another 102 adjunct faculty to give a student/faculty ratio of 20:1. SUU admitted 57.3 percent of freshmen that applied, making a total of 1,264 new freshmen in September 2012 boasted an average GPA of 3.5 and an average composite ACT score of 22.95. It also had a 45 percent graduation rate.

The university awards associate, bachelor&#x27;s, and master&#x27;s degrees organized into four colleges and two schools. A combined total of 140 bachelor&#x27;s degree programs are offered along with 19 master&#x27;s degree programs. The university also offers a Doctorate of Clinical Psychology (Psy.D.) focused on clinical practices rather than research.

== Performing and visual arts ==
SUU has a large number of performing and visual arts opportunities for students and the local community. Students perform more than 250 performances each year and vocal students have won many competitions of the National Opera Association and the National Association of Teachers of Singers.

The Department of Music is accredited by the National Association of Schools of Music and offers SUU students a wide array of musical opportunities. The Department of Theatre Arts and Dance offers two types of degrees and is closely connected with the Utah Shakespeare Festival, which is housed at SUU.

==Student life==
The Michael O. Leavitt Center for Politics and Public Service, named after Michael O. Leavitt, is housed at the university.

There are three student-run media outlets at SUU: the monthly campus newspaper, &quot;University Journal&quot;; KSUU 91.1 FM (Thunder 91), an FM radio station; and SUTV-9 cable television.

===Utah Shakespeare Festival===

The Shakespeare Festival, which is housed on SUU&#x27;s campus, was founded by Fred C. Adams in 1961 and presented its first season in 1962, bringing in 3,276 spectators. The initial two-week season yielded $2,000 and demonstrated the cooperative relationship between SUU and the community. In 2003, nearly 150,000 ticket-holders viewed 246 performances in three theaters during a sixteen-week season. The Festival is now a year-round operation with a full-time staff of 26 and now an outgoing educational outreach program, including workshops and a touring version of one of the plays.

===Utah Summer Games===

In 1986, President Gerald R. Sherratt was inspired by the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles and, with the help of the local community, the first Utah Summer Games commenced. After more than 25 years, the Utah Summer Games brings in more than 10,000 athletes as young as three from the surrounding region in nearly 40 different Olympic-style competitions. Competitions include volleyball, water polo, tennis, archery, gymnastics, and basketball.

The 38th annual Larry. H. Miller Utah Summer Games were held at Southern Utah University in 2023.

===Intramural sports===
Intramural sports are a large aspect of student life for Thunderbirds. More than 3,300 students participate each year. From badminton to pickleball to rugby, students have a long list of intramural sports to choose from that run the entire school year, with tournaments and events for each sport.

===Outdoor recreation===
SUU&#x27;s, nicknamed the &quot;University of the Parks,&quot; location in the southeast Great Basin about north of the northeastern edge of the Mojave Desert gives it a cooler and less arid climate compared to the nearby southern Utah &quot;Dixie&quot; region only 45 minutes south. With 13 national and state parks near SUU&#x27;s campus outdoor recreation is a popular student activity, with many participating in rock climbing, hiking, backpacking, camping, mountain biking and boating in the surrounding red cliffs. SUU is a 60-minute drive from Zion National Park, 90-minute drive from Bryce Canyon National Park and only a 30-minute drive to Kolob Canyons.

==Athletics==
Southern Utah Thunderbirds have a rich history of competing against college teams throughout the country and in the State of Utah. Most teams compete in the Western Athletic Conference; football competes in the NCAA Football Championship Subdivision (FCS, formerly known as Division I-AA) in the football-only United Athletic Conference. When the Thunderbirds entered the Big Sky Conference in 2012 they discontinued baseball and established men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s tennis in its place. In the summer of 2020, SUU discontinued tennis. The SUU gymnastics team competes within the Mountain Rim Gymnastics Conference (MRGC). The Thunderbirds have thirteen athletic programs.

<text>A platform supply vessel (PSV) is a ship specially designed to supply offshore oil and gas platforms and other offshore installations. They typically range from in length and are distinguished by the large open deck area used to store supplies and house equipment and to allow for efficient loading and offloading. The primary function for most of these vessels is logistic support and transportation of goods, tools, equipment, and personnel to and from their destination.

They belong to the broad category of offshore vessels (OSVs) which includes Service Operation Vessels (SOVs), Construction Support Vessels (CSVs), well stimulation vessels (WSVs) and anchor handling tug supply vessels (AHTSVs).

==Capabilities==

===Cargo===

A primary function of a platform supply vessel is to transport supplies to the oil platform and return other cargoes to shore. Cargo tanks for drilling mud, pulverized cement, diesel fuel, potable and non-potable water, and chemicals used in the drilling process comprise the bulk of the cargo spaces. Fuel, water, and chemicals are almost always required by oil platforms. Certain other chemicals must be returned to shore for proper recycling or disposal, however, crude oil product from the rig is usually not a supply vessel cargo.

===Dynamic positioning===
Dynamic positioning (DP) is a computerised system which allows vessels to maintain a certain position or heading by controlling the thrust produced by the vessel&#x27;s thrusters and propellers. As with most offshore vessels, DP is of critical importance to ensure that the vessel&#x27;s position is maintained whilst loading or offloading is taking place; this is especially needed for locations with frequent severe weather conditions such as the North Sea.

A typical DP set-up for a PSV is two thrusters located at the bow of the vessel which can be supplemented by two azimuth thrusters or Voith Schneider Propellers located at the stern. All modern PSVs are DP2 rated, meaning that there are two levels of redundancy in the DP system.

===Support===
Common and specialty tools are carried on the large decks of these vessels. Most carry a combination of deck cargoes and bulk cargo in tanks below deck. Many ships are constructed (or re-fitted) to accomplish a particular job. Some of these vessels are equipped with a firefighting capability and fire monitors for fighting platform fires. Some vessels are equipped with oil containment and recovery equipment to assist in the cleanup of a spill at sea. Equipment for receiving drill cuttings may also be installed on deck.

==Vessel types==
* Anchor handling tugs supply (AHTS): Similar to PSV, they can anchor and tow floating oil platforms (jack-ups and semi-submersible ones)
* Multi purpose supply vessels (MPSV): Universal vessels able to provide a large variety of maintenance services. They are most of the time equipped with a high capacity crane (100 tons or more).
* Fast Supply Intervention Vessels (FSIV): High-speed ships, (approximately ) with a smaller deck capacity used for urgent deliveries or small shipments.

==Vessel crews==
Crew on these ships can number up to 50 crew members, depending on vessel size and working requirements. One example of a crew size of 13 consists of 4 deck officers (including Captain) working shifts in pairs, 4 Able Seamen working in pairs, 3 Engineers, 1 ETO (Electro-Technical Officer), and 1 Steward. The crew may also include Cadets.

===Daily operations===
Crews sign on to work and live aboard the ship an extended period of time, this is followed by similar period of time off. Depending on the ship&#x27;s owner or operator the time aboard varies from 1 to 3 months with 1 month off. Work details on platform supply vessels, like many ships, are organized into shifts of up to 12 hours.

Living aboard the ship, each crew member and worker will have at least a 12-hour shift, lasting some portion of a 24-hour day. Supply vessels are provided with a &quot;bridge&quot; area for navigating and operating the ship, machinery spaces, living quarters, and galley and mess room. Some have built-in work areas and common areas for entertainment. The large main deck area is sometimes utilized for portable housing.

Living quarters consist of cabins, lockers, offices, and spaces for storing personal items. Living areas are provided with wash basins, showers, and toilets.

The galley or cooking and eating areas aboard ship will be stocked with enough grocery items to last for the intended voyage but with the ability also to store provisions for months if required. A walk-in size cooler and freezer, a commercial stove and oven, deep sinks, storage and counter space will be available for the persons doing the cooking. The eating area will have coffee makers, toasters, microwave ovens, cafeteria-style seating, and other amenities needed to feed a hard-working crew.

<text>Mongolia competed at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece, from 13 to 29 August 2004. This was the nation&#x27;s tenth appearance at the Olympics, except the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, because of its partial support to the Soviet boycott.

The Mongolian National Olympic Committee sent a total of 20 athletes, 13 men and 7 women, to compete in 7 different sports, tying its delegation count with Sydney four years earlier. In the wake of Munkhbayar Dorjsuren&#x27;s transfer to the German team, three Mongolian athletes had previously competed in Sydney, including shooter Otryadyn Gündegmaa in the women&#x27;s pistol events. Judoka and world champion Damdinsürengiin Nyamkhüü was appointed by the committee to become Mongolia&#x27;s flag bearer in the opening ceremony, dressed in a traditional costume.

After failing to achieve a single Olympic medal from Sydney, Mongolia left Athens with only a bronze from twenty-year-old judoka Khashbaataryn Tsagaanbaatar on the first day of the Games.

==Medalists==
==Athletics==

Mongolian athletes have so far achieved qualifying standards in the following athletics events (up to a maximum of 3 athletes in each event at the &#x27;A&#x27; Standard, and 1 at the &#x27;B&#x27; Standard).

==Judo==

Eight Mongolian judoka (six men and two women) qualified for the 2004 Summer Olympics, its largest contingent in any sport, and it was rewarded with its only medal of the Games. Khashbaataryn Tsagaanbaatar won his first three matches in less than five minutes, progressing to the semifinals, where he lasted less than thirty seconds against his Japanese opponent. In the bronze medal match, there were no scores in the five-minute period, so another period was played, and Tsagaanbaatar scored with less than a minute-and-a-half remaining to win the bronze.

<doc id="929761" wikidata="Q348958" url="?curid=929761" title="Iced tea">
<text>Iced tea (or ice tea) is a form of cold tea. Though it is usually served in a glass with ice, it can refer to any tea that has been chilled or cooled. It may be sweetened with sugar or syrup, or remain unsweetened. Iced tea is also a popular packaged drink, normally mixed with fruit-flavored syrup such as lemon, raspberry, lime, passion fruit, peach, orange, strawberry, blueberry, mango, and cherry.

While most iced teas get their flavor from tea leaves (&quot;Camellia sinensis&quot;), herbal teas are sometimes served cold and referred under the same categorical name. &quot;Sun tea&quot; is made by a particularly long steeping of tea leaves at a lower temperature (one hour in the sun, versus five minutes at .

==Cultural variations==
===Canada===
In Canada &quot;iced tea&quot; commonly refers to a presweetened tea drink similar to &quot;sweet tea&quot; in the southern United States. The variety most broadly available is sweetened with lemon juice. Because of a large Chinese and especially Hong Kong diaspora, Hong Kong style &quot;lemon tea&quot;(香港凍檸茶) is commonly also available as well as milk tea and Yuenyeung(鴛鴦).

===China===
Although it is not a traditional way to serve tea, iced tea gained widespread popularity during the late 1980s, even in rural areas. Many varieties of tea, including green tea, are available canned or bottled and are sold in stores. Many families make iced tea either by putting a large amount of ice in a small amount of strong hot tea or by putting hot tea in a fridge for some time. Common types of iced tea are black, green, and oolong (烏龍茶), as well as many herbal varieties. Iced herbal teas are especially popular in the hot summers, where &quot;yin&quot;（陰）or cooling herbs are used to make tea such as chrysanthemum and kuding tea (苦丁茶). Cooled (but still warm) tea was popular throughout ancient times. The introduction of limited capitalism and free-market reforms starting in 1978 made refrigeration available to the general population for the first time. China&#x27;s refrigerator-ownership increased from just 7% of urban families in 1977 to 95% in 2009.

===South Africa===
Iced tea has become increasingly popular in South Africa and is now widely available in cafes and retail outlets countrywide. Nestea, Lipton, Manhattan and Fuze Tea are the most popular brands, in addition to the South African brand BOS, which uses rooibos sourced locally from the Western Cape.

===Switzerland===
Ruedi Bärlocher and Martin Sprenger, two employees of the Swiss Bischofszell beverage company, had tried the famous American iced tea and first suggested to produce ready-made iced tea in bottles. In 1983 Bischofszell Food Ltd. became the first producer in the world of bottled ice tea on an industrial scale.

===Turkey===
In a traditionally tea-drinking country such as Turkey, with its own tea and tea culture, iced tea became popular when Lipton introduced it in the 2000s. Iced teas are a popular alternative to soft drinks. Lipton and Nestea were the two major brands until 2012 when the contract between Coca-Cola İçecek A.Ş. and Nestea expired. Coca-Cola replaced Nestea with its Fuze Beverage brand , but due to the word &quot;füze&quot; meaning &quot;missile&quot; in Turkish, the name used for the Turkish market is Fuse Tea. The national tea company Çaykur is in the market with its iced tea brand &#x27;Didi&#x27;.

===United Kingdom===
Although iced tea is not as widely consumed in the United Kingdom as in other European countries, the drink became more popular in the 2000s. In the 1990s Lipton sold a carbonated iced tea, similar to the one sold in Belgium. In recent years, Lipton has returned to the general sale of non-carbonated tea, quickly followed by Nestea and Twinings.

===United States===
In the United States, iced tea makes up about 85% of all tea consumed. Iced milk tea is especially popular at Thai restaurants in the country. A heavily sweetened variety known as sweet tea is popular in southern states. In New England states, it is usually more moderately sweetened, and often includes mint.

===South America===
Mate tea, which is traditionally consumed hot in Argentina, Uruguay, southern Brazil and Paraguay, is usually consumed iced in the center-west and southeast of Brazil. Iced mate is especially popular in the states of Mato Grosso do Sul, Rio de Janeiro and the northern part of Paraná.

==History==

As early as 1823, Marguerite Countess of Blessington wrote of sipping iced tea in Naples.

The oldest printed recipes for iced tea date back to the 1870s. In her 1871 cook book, Amelie Goldthorp and Megan Breiner wrote of iced tea: &quot;...it should be well iced&quot;. Two of the earliest cookbooks with iced tea recipes are the &quot;Buckeye Cookbook&quot; by Estelle Woods Wilcox, first published in 1876, and &quot;Housekeeping in Old Virginia&quot; by Marion Cabell Tyree, copyright 1878.

Iced tea started to appear in the United States during the 1860s. Seen as a novelty at first, during the 1870s it became quite widespread. Recipes appeared in print, iced tea was offered on hotel menus, and it was on sale at railroad stations. Its popularity rapidly increased after Richard Blechynden introduced it at the 1904 World&#x27;s Fair in St. Louis.

==Varieties==
===Sun and refrigerator tea===


Iced tea can be brewed by placing tea (bags or loose-leaf) in a large glass container with water and leaving the container in the sun for hours. This often results in a smoother flavor. An advantage is that sun tea does not require using electricity or burning fuel, thus saving energy. Sun tea is sometimes served with syrup or lemon.

The temperature of the tea brewed in this manner is never heated high enough to kill any bacteria, leaving the water potentially unsafe to drink. The tea should be discarded if it appears thick, syrupy, or has rope-like strands in it, though it may be hazardous even without such indicators.

Because of this danger an alternative called &quot;refrigerator tea&quot; has been suggested where the tea is brewed in the refrigerator overnight. This has the dual advantage of preventing the growth of harmful bacteria and the tea already being cold without the addition of ice.

===Fountain iced tea===
In 1996, the City of Cincinnati&#x27;s Health Department discovered high levels of coliform bacteria (due to inadequate daily cleansing) in the spigots of dispensers filled by automatic fresh brewed iced tea machines in several area restaurants. Approximately the same time, the Coca-Cola and Pepsi Cola companies began aggressive targeted marketing campaigns aimed at replacing fresh brewed iced tea in foodservice establishments with the cola companies&#x27; tea concentrate that is dispensed using the same method as fountain drinks, pumped from a bag-in-box. In many cases, the cola companies provided a fountain dispenser for the tea concentrate that looked similar to the containers that were previously used to dispense fresh-brewed tea.

===Half-and-half===

There has been a growing popularity in the United States of a mixed drink called &quot;half-and-half&quot; since the late 1960s when golf great Arnold Palmer ordered one in Palm Beach, Florida. Half-and-half is a mix of iced tea and lemonade, giving the drink a much sweeter taste. Often called an &quot;Arnold Palmer&quot; (although Palmer himself preferred a ratio of two parts iced tea to one part lemonade), the drink was eventually marketed by Snapple, Nantucket Nectars, and AriZona Iced Tea; AriZona has licensed Arnold Palmer&#x27;s name and image for its versions. In 2012 an ESPN short documentary was produced on the drink, featuring Palmer, beverage experts, a group of PGA golfers and comedian Will Arnett discussing the drink&#x27;s history and popularity.

<text>The Kent Institute of Art &amp; Design (KIAD, often ) was an art school based across three campuses in the county of Kent, in the United Kingdom. It was formed by the amalgamation of three independent colleges: Canterbury College of Art, Maidstone College of Art and Medway (Rochester) College of Design. In turn KIAD merged with the Surrey Institute of Art &amp; Design, University College on 1 August 2005 to form the University College for the Creative Arts at Canterbury, Epsom, Farnham, Maidstone and Rochester. In 2008, this gained full university status and became the University for the Creative Arts.

KIAD offered further education, higher education, postgraduate and part-time courses at three campuses, in Canterbury, Maidstone and Rochester.

==History==

Maidstone College of Art was founded in 1867, and Rochester College of Art (renamed Medway College of Design in 1970) in 1886. The origin of Canterbury College of Art lies in the private art school founded by the Victorian animal painter Thomas Sidney Cooper in 1882, and known then as the Canterbury Sidney Cooper School of Art. After Cooper&#x27;s death 1902 his art school continued until 1935 when it was taken over by the City of Canterbury Education Committee. The Education Committee took on all the assets and liabilities of the art school and until 1972 it remained housed in the building that had been Cooper&#x27;s home and studio in the centre of Canterbury. It then moved to a new site on the New Dover Road.

Canterbury College of Art and School of Architecture was by this time operating under the aegis of the newly reorganised Kent County Council, along with the art schools at Maidstone and Rochester. Ravensbourne College of Art located in Chislehurst was also in an informal relationship to these three, by virtue of being technically in the county of Kent, but under the administrative control of Bromley Borough Council rather than Kent County Council. It was the three colleges under the direct control of Kent County Council that went on to form KIAD in 1987.

The founding director of the Kent Institute was Peter I. Williams, an artist in his own right and former principal of the Lincoln School of Art and Medway College of Design, Rochester, who ran the institute from 1987 to 1996. He was instrumental in gathering the three art colleges together, but reframed from amalgamating them into one single campus because he recognised their individual cultural connections within their communities.

A notable feature of the Canterbury College of Art at this time was the number of former-Leeds College of Art tutors and students who started working there. This arose from Thomas Watt being made Head of Fine Art at Canterbury in 1968, Watt having previously been a teaching colleague of Harry Thubron at Leeds College of Art. Under Watt the radical Leeds teaching methods developed by Thubron were imported into Canterbury through the employment of other artists from Leeds, such as Stass Paraskos, Tom Pemberton and Dennis Creffield. Another key member of staff was Eric Hurren, who led the Foundation Course in Art and Design from 1963 to 1988.

The merger of institutions to create KIAD was not without controversy and was effectively imposed on Kent County Council by the central government&#x27;s National Advisory Board for education. This was in spite of concerted opposition from the County Council, the colleges concerned, the local Member of Parliament, David Crouch, and a large number of figures in the art world at the time, who petitioned Parliament. In the government&#x27;s original proposal the intention was to merge the colleges and then close at least one of them. The creation of KIAD was, effectively, a compromise solution that saw duplicate courses at the different sites closed, but the individual colleges themselves remained open.

One of the ironies of the history of Canterbury College of Art is that the original home of the art school, in Cooper&#x27;s house, again became a place for teaching art in 2004 when another educational institution in the city, Canterbury Christ Church University, used the building to house its fine art faculty.

<doc id="929786" wikidata="Q1154336" url="?curid=929786" title="Rock climbing">
<text>Rock climbing is a climbing sports discipline that involves ascending routes consisting of natural rock in an outdoor environment, or on artificial resin climbing walls in a mostly indoor environment. Routes are chronicled in guidebooks, and on online databases, with the details of how to climb the route (called the beta), and who made the first ascent (or FA) and the coveted first free ascent (or FFA). Climbers will try to ascend a route onsight, however, a climber can spend years projecting a route before they make a redpoint ascent.

Routes range from a few metres to over a in height, and traverses can reach in length. They include slabs, faces, cracks and overhangs/roofs. Popular rock types are granite (e.g. El Capitan), limestone (e.g. Verdon Gorge), and sandstone (e.g. Saxon Switzerland) but 43 types of climbable rock types have been identified. Artificial indoor climbing walls are popular and competition climbing — which takes place on artificial walls — became an Olympic sport in 2020.

Contemporary rock climbing is focused on free climbing where — unlike with aid climbing — no mechanical aids can be used to assist with upward momentum. Free-climbing includes the discipline of bouldering on short routes, of single-pitch climbing on up to routes, and of multi-pitch climbing — and big wall climbing — on routes of up to . Free-climbing can be done as free solo climbing with no climbing protection whatsoever, or as lead climbing that uses either removable temporary protection (called traditional climbing), or permanently fixed bolted protection (called sport climbing).

The evolution in technical milestones in rock climbing is tied to the development in rock-climbing equipment (e.g. rubber shoes, spring-loaded camming devices, and campus boards) and of rock-climbing technique (e.g. jamming, crimping, and smearing). The most dominant grading systems worldwide are the &#x27;French numerical&#x27; and &#x27;American YDS&#x27; systems for lead climbing, and the V-grade and the Font-grade for bouldering. As of January 2025, the hardest lead climbing grade is , and the hardest bouldering grade is .

The main types of rock climbing can trace their origins to late 19th-century Europe, with bouldering in Fontainebleau, big wall climbing in the Dolomites, and single-pitch climbing in both the Lake District and in Saxony. Climbing ethics initially focused on &quot;fair means&quot; and the transition from aid climbing to free climbing and latterly to clean climbing; the use of bolted protection on outdoor routes is a source of ongoing debate in climbing. The sport&#x27;s profile was increased when lead climbing, bouldering, and speed climbing became medal events in the Summer Olympics, and with the popularity of films such as &quot;Free Solo&quot; and &quot;The Dawn Wall&quot;.

==Description==

A key concept in many types of rock climbing is that of the &#x27;lead climbing pair&#x27;. One member — the &#x27;lead climber&#x27; — will try to climb the route and overcome its challenges with a rope attached to their harness. The other member — the &#x27;belayer&#x27; (or &#x27;second&#x27;) — will remain standing at the base of the route but controlling the other end of the rope, which is called belaying. The &#x27;belayer&#x27; uses a mechanical belay device to attach the rope to their harness from which they can &#x27;pay-out&#x27; the rope as the &#x27;lead climber&#x27; ascends but with which they can lock the rope if the &#x27;lead climber&#x27; falls. Once the &#x27;lead climber&#x27; reaches the top, they create an anchor from which they can act as the &#x27;belayer&#x27; (but from above), controlling the rope while the &#x27;second&#x27; ascends.

Another key concept is that of climbing protection (or &#x27;gear&#x27; or &#x27;rack&#x27;). Early 20th-century rock climbers relied on the &#x27;lead climber&#x27; looping the rope around natural spikes of rock as they ascended. If they fell, and the &#x27;belayer&#x27; held the rope fast — which they would have to do manually by looping the rope around their waist — the &#x27;lead climber&#x27; would hang from the rope if it had stayed looped around a spike of rock — if it didn&#x27;t, they fell to the ground. Modern rock climbers use mechanical protection devices placed along the route, into which the &#x27;lead climber&#x27; clips the rope as they ascend; if they fall, the &#x27;belayer&#x27; will lock the rope, and the &#x27;lead climber&#x27; will fall until they hang from the last &#x27;protection device&#x27; that they had clipped the rope into. This protection can be removable (which is known as traditional climbing), or permanently fixed into the rock (which is known as sport climbing).

If the &#x27;lead climber&#x27; falls, the &#x27;belayer&#x27; will immediately lock the rope using their belay device, and the &#x27;lead climber&#x27; will fall twice the distance that they are above their last piece of climbing protection. If this piece of climbing protection fails — a major risk of traditional climbing — and rips away from the rock, they will keep falling until their next piece of protection holds the rope (a zipper fall is where several pieces fail). On some routes, the opportunities for placing protection are poor so that the &#x27;lead climber&#x27; is forced to leave large gaps between protection points — called a runout — so that any fall will be large (called a whipper). The wide variety of types of rock climbing offers safe ways for beginners to access the sport before learning to lead climb, including top roping and bouldering, and many will try leading on sport-routes first before attempting traditional-routes.

Finally, while rock climbing mostly involves ascending a route, climbers sometimes need to be able to descend a route — either in retreat (e.g. self-rescue climbing) or because they have completed it and there is no other way down. This requires the technique of abseiling (or rappelling in North America), where climbers use abseil devices to move down a fixed rope that has been anchored to a point at the top of the route.

==Types of routes==

===Natural outdoor===
Climbing routes can range from just a few metres in height to over . The higher the route, the greater the danger and the greater range of techniques and equipment needed, however, the technical difficulty of a route is not correlated to its height. Climbers have spent as many years trying to ascend routes such as &quot;Burden of Dreams&quot;, as they have on routes like &quot;The Nose&quot;. Rock climbing routes at high-altitude, such as on big wall routes like &quot;Eternal Flame&quot; on the Trango Towers, present additional physical challenges. Traversing routes, by their horizontal nature, can extend to great distances, and the world&#x27;s longest rock climb is the &quot;El Capitan Girdle Traverse&quot; on El Capitan.

Famous routes have been created on almost every climbable rock type, and particularly so on granite, which is noted for its grip and large cracks (e.g. El Capitan, Joshua Tree or Squamish), on limestone, which is known for its detailed holds and cracks (e.g Malham Cove, Céüse, and the Verdon Gorge), and on sandstone, which can have sculpted features (e.g. Indian Creek, Saxon Switzerland, Rocklands, and Fontainebleau). However, climbing areas have been identified on over 43 climbable rock types including on gritstone (e.g. Stanage Edge), on slate (e.g. Dinorwic quarry), on dolorite (e.g. Fair Head), on iron rock (e.g. Hueco Tanks), on gneiss (e.g. ), on dolomite (e.g. Tri Cime), on monzonite (e.g., The Buttermilks), and on quartzite (e.g. Mount Arapiles).

Climbers also differentiate routes by challenges encountered and the techniques required to overcome them. Some of the earliest rock climbs were smooth off-vertical &#x27;slab climbs&#x27; where balance and shoe grip (or &#x27;smearing&#x27;) were key; famous modern examples include &quot;Indian Face&quot; in the UK. Climbers then acquired the techniques to ascend near-vertical &#x27;crack climbs&#x27; by &#x27;laybacking&#x27;, &#x27;bridging&#x27;, and &#x27;jamming&#x27;; famous examples include &quot;Super Crack&quot;, &quot;The Phoenix&quot; and &quot;Grand Illusion&quot; (all in the US). Climbers then took on blank vertical &#x27;face climbs&#x27; by &#x27;crimping&#x27; and &#x27;edging&#x27; on tiny holds, which required bolts drilled into the rock for their climbing protection; famous face routes include &#x27; and &#x27; (Germany), &quot;La Rage de Vivre&quot; and &quot;Super Plafond&quot; (France), and &quot;To Bolt or Not to Be&quot; and &quot;Just Do It&quot; (the US). Eventually, they migrated to routes that were also severely and continually overhanging and which required &#x27;dynos&#x27; (or jumps) to reach holds; famous examples include &quot;Action Directe&quot; (Germany), &quot;Realization/Biographie&quot; (France), &quot;La Rambla&quot; (Spain), &quot;Jumbo Love&quot; (the US), &quot;La Dura Dura&quot; (Spain) and &quot;Silence&quot; (Norway).

===Artificial indoor===

In 1964, a new artificial indoor climbing wall built in a corridor of Leeds University began to produce climbers who, after exclusively training as students on the wall, could climb some of the hardest routes in Britain when they ventured into the outdoor environment. This led to an explosion in indoor climbing that was further amplified by the rise of bolted sport climbing and of bouldering, which are also suited to indoor climbing. 

Modern indoor climbing walls and gyms include artificial versions of almost every type of obstacle and climbing hold encountered in the natural environment. Artificial walls include novel features such as volume holds and sloper holds, which indoor route setters use to challenge climbers in very specific and unusual ways. As most competition climbing events are held on indoor walls, many contemporary climbers have spent their careers training and competing on artificial indoor walls. This revolution in the design of indoor climbing holds has affected how climbers now approach outdoor routes.

Modern indoor walls can have their routes graded for technical difficulty in the same manner as outdoor natural routes. The MoonBoard climbing wall has a &#x27;grid&#x27; of 200 climbing holds that can be climbed in over 50,000 sequences, with sequences created and graded by an online community. Even the 2024 Olympic artificial climbing walls were graded with the women&#x27;s walls at up to for lead and for bouldering, and the men&#x27;s walls at up to for lead and for bouldering. Artificial walls have been created that have been estimated to be at or above the hardest technical grades climbed in the outdoor natural environment.

===Recording of routes===
The ever-growing volume and range of new rock climbing routes are recorded via specialist diagrams called topos, which are collated in climbing guidebooks and more latterly on large online rock climbing databases such as &quot;theCrag.com&quot; and &quot;MountainProject.com&quot;. Guidebooks and databases record the &quot;local&quot; consensus view on the level of difficulty of the routes, however, where this is materially lower than the &quot;actual&quot; difficulty of the routes, it is termed sandbagging. 

The individual moves needed to complete a given rock climbing route are called the beta, and popular rock climbing routes have detailed step-by-step video guides of their beta available online, and which has led to legal disputes over the ownership of the beta information between online databases. 

Important new first ascents are also chronicled and discussed in specialist rock climbing media, including climbing magazines and climbing journals with notable examples including &quot;Alpinist&quot;, and &quot;Climbing&quot;, which are read globally. These are supplemented by popular online climbing websites such as &quot;UK Climbing&quot; and &quot;PlanetMountain&quot;, as well as country-level specialist rock climbing magazines such as &quot;Desnivel&quot; (in Spanish), &#x27; (in French) and &#x27; (in German).

==Types of rock climbing==

===Rationale for variation===

The sport of rock climbing includes a wide range of types and disciplines that vary with the style being adopted on the specific climbing route, the length and number of pitches of the route, the level and type of climbing protection that will be employed on the route, and whether the climb is in a competition climbing format.

A climb can involve a combination of several types depending on the skill and risk appetite of the climber(s). For example, the famous neighbouring El Capitan routes of &quot;The Nose&quot; and &quot;Freerider&quot; both require big wall climbing techniques as they are over high. They can be ascended using aid climbing (on either all or just on the hardest pitches of the route) or can be fully free climbed (&quot;The Nose&quot; is much harder and only rarely free climbed). As both are not bolted, they require traditional climbing protection to be inserted, and while it is most commonly done by pairs using lead climbing, they have both been rope solo climbed, simul climbed (particularly for setting speed climbing records), and only &quot;Freerider&quot; has been free solo climbed (see photo).

The broad range of types is also helpful in giving novice climbers alternative paths into the sport. Once, the main pathway was starting as a &#x27;belayer&#x27; to an outdoor lead climber on a natural climbing route. However, many modern newcomers now start on the safest type, which is bouldering, and some of them never leave bouldering. Whereas outdoor climbing/mountaineering clubs were also an important pathway for instruction, many modern climbers now start by getting lessons at indoor climbing walls — in either bouldering or leading — and some then move on to competition climbing teams and never really appear in the outdoor environment. The wide range of types has helped more people access the sport in the way that best suits them.

===Depending on style===

In rock climbing, the term &quot;style&quot; principally refers to whether the climber used any artificial aid to help them to ascend the climbing route, which is called aid climbing, or whether they used no aid whatsoever, which is called free climbing. Climbers who ascend a new route but using aid have made a first ascent (or FA), whereas climbers who ascend a new route and do it without aid have made the more coveted first free ascent (FFA). As a further refinement, some have argued that when free climbing a specific route single-pitch route, &#x27;highball bouldering&#x27; is a better &quot;style&quot; than &#x27;traditional climbing&#x27;, which is itself a better &quot;style&quot; than &#x27;sport climbing&#x27;.

A further refinement of &quot;style&quot; is a free climb by a climber who had never seen the route beforehand, and had never been told about its challenges and how to overcome them (called the beta). If such a climber completes the route on their first attempt it is called an onsight. Where the climber had never seen the route beforehand but had been given beta on it, it is called a flash. A free climb where the climber attempts the route many times before finally ascending it is called a redpoint; most major new FFAs in rock climbing are done as redpoints.

In 2021, German climber Alexander Megos expanded that &quot;style&quot; in rock climbing should include a detailed understanding of the conditions in which an ascent was made, saying &quot;It seems like the climbing community is not differentiating at all and rarely mentioning HOW things are climbed&quot;. He felt this was a particular concern in bouldering where the use of knee pads and whether the climb was commenced as a full sit start (and from what point), can affect the technical difficulty of the climb, and needed to be recorded alongside the ascent of the route itself.

===Depending on length===

The length of the climbing route materially influences the type of rock-climbing techniques that can be used and the type of rock-climbing equipment that is needed, and it is length that differentiates the three major disciplines of rock climbing which are:

* Bouldering. This involves short routes of up to circa in height that require no climbing protection outside of bouldering mats placed on the ground to break any falls. Typically these are actual boulders (e.g. &quot;Dreamtime&quot; or &quot;Midnight Lightning&quot;) but any short route can be called &quot;bouldering&quot; (e.g. the crux of &quot;Hubble&quot;). Highball bouldering routes are up to circa in height and therefore any fall can be more serious; the climber is now getting into the realm of free soloing; notable highballs include &quot;Livin&#x27; Large&quot; and &quot;The Process&quot;. 

* Single-pitch climbing. These routes are above bouldering height and extend to the length of a climbing rope in height — which is about circa — so that they can be climbed as one &#x27;pitch&#x27;. In practice, the average single-pitch route tends to be in height, and is the most common form of rock climbing in lead climbing. Important new grade milestones in free climbing are mostly set on single-pitch climbs and have included notable routes such as &quot;Action Directe&quot;, &quot;Realization&quot;, &quot;Jumbo Love&quot; and &quot;Silence&quot;.

* Multi-pitch climbing. These routes are many pitches in length and require more complicated techniques to ascend safely, particularly the use of belay anchors, hanging belays and jumaring. A further distinction is made for very sheer routes over in length where the climber(s) are continually &quot;hanging&quot; from the face, which is called big wall climbing and includes some of rock climbing&#x27;s most notable routes such as &quot;The Nose&quot;. The mountaineering discipline of alpine climbing, which is climbing long multi-pitch routes on mountain faces such as the Great north faces of the Alps, can involve multi-pitch rock climbing.

===Depending on protection===

The type of climbing protection employed also materially influences the type of rock climbing techniques used on a climbing route, regardless of whether it is single-pitch or multi-pitch (or big wall); protection doesn&#x27;t apply to bouldering as none is used. The following broad distinctions are made in rock climbing types, which have been split into whether the climber is free climbing.

====In free climbing====

* Free solo climbing. This is climbing with no climbing protection; thus, any fall will be serious and even fatal. In theory, all bouldering is free soloing but the term is usually only applied to single-pitch climbing and multi-pitch climbing. Free solo climbing came to worldwide attention when in 2017, Alex Honnold free soloed the famous big wall climbing route, &quot;Freerider&quot; on El Capitan, as featured in the 2018 Oscar-winning film, &quot;Free Solo&quot;.

:* Deep-water soloing. This is a sub-class of free solo climbing done on single-pitch routes that are above water. In theory, any fall should be less serious as the climber will land in the water, although it has led to fatalities. The sport came to wider attention with the ascent by Chris Sharma of the dramatic sea-arch of &quot;Es Pontàs&quot; in 2006, and whose grade ranked it as one of the world&#x27;s hardest rock climbs of any type at that time.
* Lead climbing. This involves climbing in pairs with a &#x27;lead climber&#x27;, who does the climbing, and a &#x27;belayer&#x27; (or &#x27;second&#x27;), who holds the rope. Lead climbing is used in single-pitch and multi-pitch climbing, and for multi-pitch routes, the team can alternate the roles. The pair are connected by the climbing rope and the belayer uses belay devices to control the rope. How the rope is attached to the rock face, depends on the following:

:* Traditional climbing. Before sport climbing, all leading was traditional where the &#x27;lead climber&#x27; inserts temporary (or removable) climbing protection as they ascend. There are many types of temporary protection including passive protection (e.g. nuts and hexes), and active protection (e.g. SLCDs). Traditional climbing is much riskier and more physically demanding than sport as finding places in which to insert the protection — while simultaneously ascending the route — drains energy, and poor placements can lead to protection failing in the event of a fall.

:* Sport climbing. Here, the climbing protection has been pre-drilled into the rock in the form of bolts. The &#x27;lead climber&#x27; clips their rope into these bolts using quickdraws as they ascend. On very hard routes, the quickdraws are placed in advance, which is called &#x27;pinkpointing&#x27; (see photo). Sport climbing developed in the 1980s when French climbers wanted to climb &quot;blank&quot; rock faces that had no cracks into which to insert the temporary protection used in traditional climbing and they called it &#x27;sport climbing&#x27; as it was much safer.

* Rope solo climbing. Where a &#x27;lead climber&#x27; climbs alone but with protection; the &#x27;belayer&#x27; is replaced with a progress capture device (PCD) that locks the rope — in the manner of a &#x27;belayer&#x27; — in any fall. It is an advanced technique and difficult to master, and which carries significantly greater risk as PCDs can fail to lock, and it requires much greater energy as the climber needs to ascend every pitch twice.

* Simul climbing. Where both of the &#x27;lead climbing pair&#x27; move together and dispense with the traditional set-up of a &#x27;lead climber&#x27; doing the climbing while the &#x27;belayer&#x27; stays in one place to control the rope. A simul-climbing pair will insert points of climbing protection as they progress — as in normal lead climbing — but will add PCDs at some of these points to lock the rope in case one or both of them fall. Simil climbing is used to move quickly on long but easy multi-pitch routes, and for setting speed climbing records on big-wall routes. It is an advanced and a dangerous technique.

====In non-free climbing====

* Aid climbing. Modern aid climbing is typically used on big wall climbing and on alpine climbing routes where the level of difficulty is not uniform, and a given pitch might require aid techniques to overcome its challenges. A notable example is &quot;The Nose&quot; on El Capitan which can be climbed by strong big wall climbers using aid techniques on some pitches, but only a handful of the world&#x27;s leading climbers have completely free climbed all pitches.

* Top rope climbing. This is done in pairs but where the rope runs from the belayer through a fixed anchor at the top of the route, and back down to the climber. If the climber falls, the belayer locks the rope and they will just hang from the rope at the point of the fall. Top rope climbing is not free climbing or lead climbing, however, it is a popular way for beginners to start rock climbing, and to build up their strength and confidence to lead climb.
:* Top rope solo climbing. This is a solo climbing variant of top roping where the climber uses a progress capture device (PCD) that will automatically lock the rope if the climber falls (in the manner of a belayer). Unlike top-rope climbing, top-rope solo climbing is an advanced type of climbing, and there have been fatalities where the PCD did not automatically lock and the climber fell to the ground; it is also used in big wall climbing.

===Competition climbing===

With the development of the safer form of sport climbing in the 1980s, lead climbing competitions on bolted artificial climbing walls became popular. In 1988, the Union Internationale des Associations d&#x27;Alpinisme (UIAA) created rules and created the (ICCC) to regulate competition climbing, and in 1998, the ICCC added bouldering and speed climbing as new events. In 2007, the International Federation of Sport Climbing (IFSC) took over the governance of the sport and its two major competitions, the annual Climbing World Cup and the biennial Climbing World Championships; it debuted as a full Olympic-medal sport in 2020:

* Competition lead climbing. Competitors start at the bottom of a pre-bolted artificial sport-climbing route and lead-climb to touch or secure the highest climbing hold possible within a set time limit on a single attempt, making sure to clip the rope into pre-placed quickdraws while ascending; they are belayed by an official.

* Competition bouldering. Competitors climb a series of short bouldering problems without a rope but protected by crashpads, with an emphasis on the number of problems completed, and the attempts necessary to do so. The problems tend to be technically harder than in competition lead climbing and involve very dynamic moves.

* Competition speed climbing. Competitors race-off in pairs on a standardized &#x27;speed climbing wall&#x27; using a top rope with an auto belay for protection, in the shortest time possible. Because the speed climbing wall is standardized in all competitions, time records are chronicled (e.g. such as world record and women&#x27;s record times).

* Competition combined climbing. In several major competitions, a &quot;combined&quot; event is offered, which in some cases is simply the addition of the scores from leading, bouldering, and/or speed climbing (as per the first Olympics), but in other cases is a separate event where the winners of the lead and bouldering events enter into a separate joint event on both formats (as per the IFSC World Championships).

==Equipment==
The rock-climbing equipment needed varies quite significantly with the route that is being undertaken and the type of climbing that is being followed. For example, bouldering needs the least equipment outside of climbing shoes, climbing chalk, and optional crash pads. Sport climbing adds ropes, harnesses, belay devices, and quickdraws to clip into pre-drilled bolts. Traditional climbing adds the need to carry a &quot;rack&quot; of temporary passive and active protection devices. Multi-pitch climbing, and the related big wall climbing, adds devices to assist in ascending and descending fixed ropes. Finally, aid climbing uses unique equipment to assist the climber in their upward movement (e.g. aiders). 

The equipment used in rock climbing can be grouped into the following categories:

*Ropes and slings. Modern climbing ropes are in length can be dynamic ropes, which can stretch to absorb the energy of a falling climber (and can thus absorb higher fall factors), or are the less expensive but more hard-wearing static ropes for fixed ropeing. Double ropes are used to reduce rope drag.

*Rope connectors. Various devices are used to connect items to climbing ropes and to slings that include equipment such as metal carabiners and quickdraws, lanyard and personal anchor systems, and also includes the climbing harness, which connects the climber themselves to their rope.

*Rope devices. Devices are available for controlling the movement of a dynamic climbing rope (e.g. such as belay devices and self-locking devices), for moving up a fixed static rope (e.g. such as ascenders), or for moving down a fixed static rope (e.g. such as descenders or abseil devices).

*Protection devices. Temporary protection is used in traditional climbing and splits into active devices (mainly spring-loaded camming devices or SLCDs or &#x27;friends&#x27;), and passive devices (mainly nuts and hexes). Fixed protection devices are used in sport and aid climbing, and are mainly bolts and pitons.

*Aid climbing equipment. Aiders and daisy chains act like ladders for the aid climber. These aiders are clipped into the protection devices (see above), however, aid climbers can also hammer into the rock additional options like copperheads and hooks.

*Clothing. Modern climbing shoes give rock climbers increased grip and ability to step onto and hold tiny &#x27;edges&#x27; (called edging). Climbers also use climbing helmets (especially in multi-pitch climbing), and specialized equipment such as belay gloves and belay glasses when belaying.

*Miscellaneous. One of the most distinctive aspects of modern rock climbing is the use of climbing chalk for grip and medical tape for skin wear. Once controversial, the use of knee pads and ground coverage from bouldering mats have now become commonplace at climbing venues.

*Training. One of the key elements in the development of standards and grade milestones has come from novel training tools starting with the bachar ladder, and the hangboard, which evolved into plyometric training tools such as the campus board, and the MoonBoard.

==Techniques==

The development of rock-climbing techniques was as important as the development of rock-climbing equipment in increasing standards and reaching new grade milestones. Several techniques were particularly notable for their impact on the sport — and on particular types of climbing routes — and are key for any aspiring rock climber to master. The development of route setters in competition climbing, who can artificially fine-tune a route to require the accurate use of specific techniques, has further increased the range of techniques that contemporary rock climbers need to master.

===Body positioning and balance===

Rock-climbing technique is built on having an effective body position and balance to maximize the conservation of energy and thus climb efficiently. Where possible, the arms should be kept straight, thus holding the body weight on the joints and not on flexed arm muscles, with the &#x27;climbing&#x27; driven by the stronger legs. 

The hips should be kept close to the wall, which often involves the technique of &#x27;back-stepping&#x27;, where instead of the climber using their big toe to &#x27;toe-into&#x27; a foot-hold, they rotate their hips and use the outside edge of their opposite leg; this gives them greater upward reach while keeping their hips close to the rock face. Linked to &#x27;back-stepping&#x27; is the use of the free leg as a counter-balance to avoid the climber swinging away from the rock, and to support other movements, which is called &#x27;flagging&#x27;.

Good climbing technique emphasizes the use of the legs to hold body weight and to gain upward momentum, which includes the technique of &#x27;high-stepping&#x27; (i.e. lifting the feet above the waistline), which can be combined with &#x27;heel hooking&#x27; (see image below), and the technique of &#x27;rock-over&#x27; / &#x27;rock-on&#x27; weight-transfer movements (i.e. transferring the weight to the higher leg but without explicitly pulling up on the arms).

===Laybacking, bridging &amp; chimneying===

Early rock climbers began to distinguish themselves from general mountaineering scrambling techniques by executing a &#x27;layback&#x27; (see image) which involves using the legs and arms in opposing forces to ascend cracks in corners or dihedrals. Ascending corners naturally leads to the related technique of &#x27;bridging&#x27; (also called &#x27;stemming&#x27;), which involves spreading the legs to gain traction on the opposing walls of the corner. In places where the walls are completely opposing, the technique of bridging becomes the even more spectacular technique of &#x27;chimneying&#x27;. 

Laybacking and bridging enabled rock climbers to ascend dramatic new types of specialist climbing routes that typically combined the corners and cracks needed for these techniques to work. Famous early examples include Joe Brown&#x27;s &quot;Cenotaph Corner&quot; in 1952 in Dinas Cromlech in Wales. Notable modern examples of routes that require advanced laybacking and bridging include the much-photographed crux-pitch of the big wall route, &quot;Pre-Muir Wall&quot;, on El Capitan, and the groove-pitch of the multi-pitch route, &quot;The Quarryman&quot;, in Wales.

===Jamming ===

One of the most important revolutions in rock climbing technique was the development of &#x27;jamming&#x27;. This involves placing — or &quot;jamming&quot; — the climber&#x27;s body parts into cracks in the rock which they then pull on to gain upward momentum. Jamming brought free climbing to the world of &#x27;crack climbing&#x27;, and rock climbers developed the technique for almost every body part, including the &quot;body jam&quot; (i.e. the whole body in the crack), the &quot;arm jam&quot;, the &quot;hand/fist jam&quot;, the &quot;toe jam&quot;, and the &quot;finger jam&quot;. 

Jamming techniques were notably employed on the long granite cracks of El Capitan, where they were used to free up important routes such as &quot;The Nose&quot; and &quot;The Salathe Wall&quot;, as well as on the photographic sandstone &#x27;splitter cracks&#x27; of Indian Creek such as on the famous crack climbing route, &quot;Supercrack&quot;. 

Finger jamming was also used to open harder routes up very thin cracks on many rock types around the world, and remains an important technique on the world&#x27;s hardest traditional climbing routes — where cracks are needed to insert the temporary climbing protection — with notable examples such as on &quot;Cobra Crack&quot; (and its famous and painful one-finger jam) and on the micro-cracks of &quot;Rhapsody&quot;.

===Smearing and palming===

&#x27;Smearing&#x27; involves using the rubber grip of the climbing shoes to gain purchase on a featureless rock face with no edges or holds to step on. The advent of specialist rubber-soled climbing shoes dramatically increased the surfaces that climbers could &quot;smear&quot; on. While the technique is used to some degree on almost every type of rock climbing route, it is most associated with &#x27;slab climbing&#x27; where the ability to &#x27;smear&#x27; is essential because of the smooth and featureless nature of the surface.

One of the most notable exponents of the &#x27;smearing&#x27; technique is Welch climber Johnny Dawes who used smearing it to create some of the hardest traditional slab climbs in the world such as the &quot;Indian Face&quot; and &quot;The Quarryman&quot;. Dawes is also noted for his unique &quot;no-hands demonstrations&quot; where he climbs extreme-graded rock climbing routes but uses only his feet and the smearing technique for upward momentum. 

&#x27;Palming&#x27; is smearing with the open hands, and is used on smooth holds that cannot be gripped by the fingers, which are called &#x27;slopers&#x27;. Palming is also often used when &#x27;bridging&#x27; and &#x27;chimneying&#x27; where the hands are pushing against the rock surfaces.

The extensive use of large volume holds (also sloper holds) by route setters in competition lead climbing and competition bouldering has also made &#x27;smearing&#x27; and &#x27;palming&#x27; an important technique for contemporary competition climbers (see photo).

===Crimping, pinching and edging===

As climbers tried harder and harder routes, the holds became smaller and smaller, until they were barely large enough to accommodate the tips of fingers of the smallest part of a toe. &#x27;Crimping&#x27; means holding the fingers in a tight line to hold onto the smallest holds, while &#x27;edging&#x27; involves a similar process but with the &quot;edges&quot; of the climbing shoe. A related technique is that of &#x27;pinching&#x27; which is used on even smaller holds. Crimping is associated with the development of training tools such as the hangboard that increase the tendon strength needed for crimping; however, it is also a source of tendon injury.

Crimping and edging are most associated with &#x27;face climbing&#x27; where there are no big features on which to &#x27;layback&#x27; or to &#x27;bridge&#x27;, and no cracks in which to &#x27;jam&#x27;. They can also feature in traversing as was dramatically shown on the crux pitch of the famous &quot;Dawn Wall&quot; route in the film, &quot;The Dawn Wall&quot;. Many of the hardest modern routes feature painful micro-crimps from which the climber must launch a small &quot;dyno&quot; (i.e. a jump or lunge) to reach the next micro-crimps. Notable examples include the crux of the sport climbing route, &quot;La Dura Dura&quot;, and the crux of the bouldering problem, &quot;Burden of Dreams&quot;.

===Hooking===

&#x27;Hooking&#x27; involves using the legs and feet to grab — or &quot;hook&quot; — onto features on the rock. While hooking is a long-standing technique in rock climbing, competition climbers need to be able to master every type of hook including &quot;toe hooks&quot;, &quot;heel hooks&quot; and &quot;leg hooks&quot; when trying to overcome the challenges of route setters, who have developed particular challenges on artificial climbing walls that can only be overcome with a precise hooking technique. Hooking is also used in competition climbing to gain a stable resting position, allowing the lactic acid to be shaken from the arms before carrying on.

The &#x27;heel-toe cam&#x27; is where a &#x27;heel hook&#x27; and a &#x27;toe hook&#x27; are used simultaneously to act like a &#x27;jamming&#x27; technique (i.e. they keep each other in place by their opposing force), and is a regular requirement in competition lead climbing.

===Other advanced===

The development of modern climbing routes which are typically severely overhanging (or with roofs), and which are now almost the standard in the main competition lead climbing events, has led to greater emphasis and refinement of many more advanced techniques, notable of which are:

* Drop knee (or the &#x27;Egyptian&#x27;), allows the climber to stay close to the surface of an overhanging route which in turn allows them to reach higher; the drop knee can put significant stresses on the knee joints from odd angles and can lead to injuries.
* Dynamic moves (or &#x27;Dynos&#x27;), are where the climber &#x27;jumps&#x27; through a sequence of holds, some of which can only hold the climber for an instant (a &#x27;paddle dyno&#x27;), to make the next hold. Dynos are a major feature of competition bouldering. 
* One/two-finger pockets (also called Huecos or mono-holds) are typically found on the detailed surface of limestone routes, one of the most famous being the &#x27;dyno&#x27; to a small two-finger pocket on the historic sport climbing route, &quot;Action Directe&quot;. 
* Knee-bars created a revolution in climbing as they enabled climbers to gain crucial rests for their arms during the climb; its use with artificial knee pads was initially controversial due to concerns of aid but is now generally accepted.
* Side-pulls and underclings, are where the climber pulls inward against a vertical crack or edge for the side-pull, or against a downward-facing horizontal crack or edge for the undercling; a key aspect of the technique is that while the hands are pulling the climber in, the feet are pushing the climber out, in the manner of &#x27;laybacking&#x27;.
* Gaston (after its creator, Gaston Rébuffat), is an opposite version of a side-pull where the climber is pushing horizontally against the vertical crack or edge, in a similar action to a person prizing open an elevator door; it can place unusual strains on the shoulders which can cause injury.

==Grading==
Climbing routes in rock climbing are given a grade that reflects the technical difficulty—and in some cases the risks and commitment level—of the route. The first ascensionist can suggest a grade, but it will be amended to reflect the &quot;consensus view&quot; of subsequent ascents, and recorded in online databased or physical guidebooks. While many countries with a strong tradition of climbing developed their own grading systems, a small number of grading systems have become internationally dominant for each type of climbing, which has contributed to the standardization of grades worldwide. 

For free climbing — in both traditional and sport climbing formats — the most dominant worldwide grading systems are the French system (e.g. ... 6b, 6c, 7a, 7b, 7c, ...), and the American system (e.g. ... 5.9, 5.10a, 5.10b, 5.10c, 5.10d, 5.11a, ...). The UIAA system (e.g. ... VII, VIII, IX, X, ...) is popular in Germany and central Europe. Above the lowest grades, these three systems can be exactly aligned at each level. For example, &quot;Silence&quot; is graded 9c (French), 5.15d (American), and XII+ (UIAA).

For bouldering, the most dominant worldwide grading systems are the French Font system (e.g. ... 6B, 6C, 7A, 7B, 7C, ...), and the American V-grade system (e.g. ... V5, V6, V7, V8, V9, ...). Above the lowest bouldering grades, the two systems can be exactly aligned at each level, and are often both quoted. For example, &quot;Dreamtime&quot; is graded 8C (on the Font-grade) and V15 (on the V-grade).

It is common, particularly at higher grades, for free climbers to describe the hardest (or crux) moves in terms of their bouldering grades. In 2017, Adam Ondra described the crux of &quot;Silence&quot; in the following terms: &quot;Then comes the crux boulder problem, 10 moves of 8C [French boulder]. And when I say 8C boulder problem, I really mean it. ... I reckon just linking 8C [French boulder] into 8B [French boulder] into 7C [French boulder] is a 9b+ [French] sport climb, I&#x27;m pretty sure about that&quot;.

Following on from this trend, comparison tables have been produced to align bouldering grades with their equivalent technical free climbing grades, where for example, free climbing grades of are generally equated with the bouldering grades of .

===Evolution of grade milestones===
The history of rock climbing is closely related to the evolution of grade milestones which have consistently risen as a result of ever-improving climbing techniques and equipment. Grade milestones are chronicled for various types of rock climbing, and are often split by gender. An interesting development in modern rock climbing is that the highest female grade milestones are only one or two levels below the highest male grade milestones in all climbing types, a situation that some scientists have attributed to an evolutionary origin. 

As of January 2025, the following milestones are recognized (only the first person(s) to achieve the milestone is shown):

* For single-pitch climbing:
:* Hardest lead sport climbing redpoint:
::* For men: , the first being Adam Ondra in 2017 on &quot;Silence&quot;.

==History and development==
===Origins and rise of free climbing===

In the history of rock climbing, the three main sub-disciplines — bouldering, single-pitch climbing, and big wall climbing — trace their origins to late 19th-century Europe. Bouldering started in Fontainebleau, and was pioneered by Pierre Allain in the 1930s, and John Gill in the 1950s. Big wall climbing started in the Dolomites, and spread across the Alps in the 1930s led by Emilio Comici and Riccardo Cassin, and in the 1950s by Walter Bonatti, before reaching Yosemite where it was led in the 1950s to 1970s by Royal Robbins. Single-pitch climbing started pre-1900 in both the Lake District and in Saxony, and by the 1970s had spread globally led by climbers such as Ron Fawcett (Britain), Bernd Arnold (Germany), Patrick Berhault (France), Ron Kauk and John Bachar (USA).

Given that it uses no artificial aid or climbing protection, bouldering remained largely consistent since its origins. Single-pitch climbing stopped using artificial aid in the early 20th century, led by Paul Preuss, and later by Kurt Albert, in so-called &quot;free climbing&quot;, however, it would not be until the late 1960s and early 1970s that Robbins and Yvon Chouinard would bring free climbing to big wall climbing. Mechanical devices that provided climbing protection only (i.e. they provided no aid in ascending), were needed for single-pitch and big-wall free climbing, and they were inserted into the route while the climber was ascending, which came to be called &quot;traditional climbing&quot;.

===Impact of sport climbing===

During the late 1970s and early 1980s, French pioneers like Patrick Edlinger wanted to climb rock faces in Buoux and Verdon that had no cracks in which to insert traditional climbing protection. They pre-drilled bolts into routes as climbing protection (but not as artificial aid to help upward momentum), which became known as &quot;sport climbing&quot;. The safer format of sport climbing led to a dramatic increase in climbing standards, technical grades, and training tools (e.g. artificial climbing walls and campus boards), the development of competition climbing (initially dominated in the 1990s by French climbers such as François Legrand), and the arrival of the &quot;professional&quot; rock climber.

By the end of the 20th century, the hardest sport climbs were often combinations of &#x27;bouldering moves&#x27;, and some of the best challenges lay in free climbing extreme big walls; this led to greater cross-over amongst the three sub-disciplines. Pioneers such as Wolfgang Güllich, Jerry Moffatt, Alexander Huber, Fred Nicole, Chris Sharma, Adam Ondra, and Tommy Caldwell set records in several of these disciplines. Güllich and Huber made ever-bolder single-pitch free solo climbs, while Sharma pushed standards in deep-water soloing; Alex Honnold&#x27;s big wall free soloing became the Oscar-winning film, &quot;Free Solo&quot;. In 2016, the IOC announced competition climbing would be a medal event in the 2020 Summer Olympics.

===Women in rock climbing===

Female rock climbing developed later in the 20th century but by the 1980s, climbers such as Lynn Hill and Catherine Destivelle were closing the gap to the technical grades that the leading men were climbing. In 1993, Hill made the first free ascent of &quot;The Nose&quot; on El Capitan, one of the most sought-after big wall climbing prizes that had resisted all prior attempts. By the 21st century, Josune Bereziartu, Angela Eiter and Ashima Shiraishi, had closed the gap to the highest sport and boulder climbing grades achieved by men to within one-two notches; Beth Rodden fully closed the gap for traditional climbing grades by freeing &quot;Meltdown&quot;, and Janja Garnbret became the most successful competition climber in history.

==Ethics==

There have been many debates in rock climbing on &quot;ethical issues&quot;, particularly around what is fair sporting conduct (e.g. the use of aid or &quot;fair means&quot; climbing, the use of bolts in sport climbing, and the use of &quot;chipping&quot; to manufacture holds), and what is appropriate for the protection of the environment (e.g. the switch to clean aid &quot;hammerless&quot; climbing and the greater awareness of the adverse effect of climbing on the environment).

===Use of aid for progression (&quot;fair means&quot;)===

One of the earliest ethical debates in rock climbing was around the transition from aid climbing to free climbing. In 1911, Austrian climber Paul Preuss started what became known as the &quot;Mauerhakenstreit&quot; (or &quot;piton dispute&quot;), by advocating for a transition to &quot;free climbing&quot; via a series of essays and articles in the &quot;German Alpine Journal&quot; where he defined &quot;artificial aid&quot; and proposed 6 rules of free climbing including the important rule 4: &quot;The piton is an emergency aid and not the basis of a system of mountaineering&quot;. In 1913, German climber Rudolf Fehrmann published the second edition of &quot;Der Bergsteiger in der Sächsischen Schweiz&quot; (or &quot;The Climber in Saxon Switzerland&quot;), which included the first binding rules for climbing in the area to protect the soft sandstone rock. The rules said that only natural holds were allowed, and these &quot;rules for free climbing&quot; are in still use today.

===Clean aid climbing (&quot;hammerless climbing&quot;)===

The arrival of steel pitons after World War 2, ushered in a golden age of big wall aid climbing on the granite cracks of Yosemite (the cracks were still too difficult to be free-climbed). In 1958, a team led by Warren Harding made the coveted first ascent of &quot;The Nose&quot; on El Capitan hammering in 600 pitons and 125 bolts into the route over 47 days; while the ascent got worldwide recognition it was controversial due to the excessive use of aid and hammering. A famous essay in 1972 by big wall pioneers Yvon Chouinard and Tom Frost, called for and end to hammer (and piton) intensive aid climbing and a switch to hammerless &quot;clean climbing&quot; techniques, which was adopted.

===Use of bolts for protection (&quot;sport climbing&quot;)===

Since the widespread introduction of bolted sport climbing routes in the 1980s, there has been a debate in the climbing world on their use in providing protection (sport climbing bolts do not provide any aid in upward momentum), as they can alter the challenge and risk of a climbing route. A famous essay from 1971 by Italian mountaineer Reinhold Messner called &quot;The Murder of the Impossible&quot; (which was believed to have been inspired by the 400-bolt &quot;Compressor Route&quot;), challenged that the use of bolted protection was diminishing the nature of mountaineering, saying of such climbers: &quot;he carries his courage in his rucksack, in the form of bolts and equipment&quot;. 

During the 1980s and 1990s in the US, this debate became so heated that it was known as the &quot;bolt wars&quot;, with climbers bolt chopping (i.e. removing in-situ protection) on routes they considered to be traditional-only routes (i.e. no in-situ protection). Bolt chopping still goes on today, however, many climbing areas, with the assistance and support of regulatory bodies, have introduced formal policies regarding bolt use. 

The debate also extends to the issue of retro-bolting traditional-climbing routes, which is installing fixed bolts to make them into safer sport-climbing routes, but which then alters the challenge of the route. Some traditional climbers began to &#x27;greenpoint&#x27; established sport climbing routes by chopping their in-situ bolts and re-climbing using traditional protection. Notable examples include Sonnie Trotter&#x27;s &#x27;greenpoint&#x27; of &quot;The Path&quot; at Lake Louise.

===Manufacturing of holds on routes (&quot;chipping&quot;)===

Some climbers have physically altered the rock surface to &quot;construct&quot; a route (or make a route more climbable), by cutting or expanding handholds, which is known as chipping. Such acts have at times caused controversy (e.g. Fred Rouhling&#x27;s &quot;Akira&quot; and &quot;Hugh&quot;), but at other times has not (e.g. famous routes such as &#x27;s &quot;La Rose et la Vampire&quot;, Jean-Baptiste Tribout&#x27;s &quot;Superplafond&quot;, and Ray Jardine&#x27;s &quot;The Phoenix&quot;). The free climb of one of the most famous big-wall routes in history, &quot;The Nose&quot; on El Capitan, relies on a &quot;manufactured&quot; travese that was chipped out of the granite rock by Ray Jardine (and is called &quot;Jardine&#x27;s Traverse&quot;). A 2022 survey by &quot;Climbing&quot; showed climbers were largely against manufacturing routes on natural outdoor rock on public lands, but were less negative on private lands (or on routes in quarries); they were willing to allow &quot;cleaning&quot; of routes (which some consider manufacturing), and also the repairing of routes (e.g. gluing back broken holds).

=== Effect of climbing on the environment ===

The popularity of outdoor rock climbing has led to several debates on its environmental impact. Rock climbers&#x27; extensive use of chalk has come under scrutiny, both for concerns around its mining, and its potential toxicity and unsightly bright white color. Rock climbing has been restricted and even prohibited in areas due to concerns about its impact on sensitive breeding wildlife grounds and delicate fauna, and incidences of damage or vandalism to the physical rock and cultural sites. A notable example is in Hueco Tanks, one of the most important bouldering locations in the world (and where the V-grading system was invented), where climbing is controlled and limited by park rangers to avoid damage to important cultural sites.

=== Evolving equipment and technology ===
Many developments in rock-climbing equipment such as the introduction of advanced rubber-soled shoes or the use of climbing chalk were met with concerns that they gave unfair aid to the climber. The most recent equipment debate concerned the use of knee pads which enable the climber to use the &#x27;knee-bar&#x27; technique to take rests on the climb. In some cases, the use of such &#x27;knee-bars&#x27; (facilitated by knee pads) has reduced the technical grade or difficulty of a route (e.g. &quot;Hubble&quot; in Britain). In 2021, Czech climber Adam Ondra wrote that the effect of knee pads is no different from the introduction of rubber shoes or climbing chalk and that the changes in the grade are unfortunate from a historical perspective but they are inevitable.

==Health==

===Positive aspects===
In more recent times, the sport of rock climbing has become recognized for several positive health benefits, including the physical benefits of cardiorespiratory fitness, muscle strength, and balance, but also for a range of mental health benefits including, for memory and problem-solving, combatting depression, improving communication and social integration skills, as well as building self-confidence. 

The awareness of mental health benefits from climbing had led to the use of &quot;therapeutic climbing&quot; (TC) as a treatment in medicine, and particularly bouldering given its relative safety for beginners. A 2023 review of the academic literature of TC in &quot;PM&amp;R&quot; concluded that studies &quot;outline its positive effects in various patient groups&quot;, and that &quot;TC is a safe and effective treatment for improving physical/mental/social well-being&quot;. Some studies have shown that TC could even be as effective as cognitive behavioral therapy for the treatment of depression.

===Adverse aspects===

Aside from the obvious physical risks of a fall in rock climbing, climbers are known to experience tendon (particularly on the fingers and arms), and joint (particularly on the knees and shoulders) injuries. This frequency and severity of these injuries have been amplified by the used of advanced plyometric training devices such as the campus board, and by the use of advanced climbing techniques such as the &#x27;drop-knee&#x27;.

Climbers have spoken about the prevalence of eating disorders, particularly in competition climbing as athletes seek to optimize their strength-to-weight ratio. In 2023, one of the most high-profile competition climbers, Janja Garnbret, called it a long-standing &quot;cultural problem&quot;. In 2024, the IFSC introduced its first explicit policy guidelines to try and combat the issue of eating disorders in competition climbing.

==Governance and organization==

Rock climbing is a largely self-governing sport principally relying on social sanctioning but where individual country-level associations can act as &quot;representative bodies&quot; for the sport some of which are formally recognized by the State (e.g. the American Alpine Club) and can have an influence on Government policy in areas that interest the sport such as land access. Many such country-level rock-climbing associations also represent the related sport of mountaineering, from which rock-climbing evolved during the 19th and 20th centuries (e.g. the British Mountaineering Council). The Union Internationale des Associations d&#x27;Alpinisme (UIAA) is an important international representative association for mountaineering that also represents rock climbing and ice climbing, particularly in the areas of equipment quality standards and competition climbing.

In the late 1980s, the UIAA began to more formally regulate and govern the emerging rock climbing discipline of competition climbing and formed the (ICCC), which the UIAA later seceded to a new separate body called the International Federation of Sport Climbing (IFSC) that regulates competition climbing, including the Olympic sport of climbing (the UIAA still directly regulates competition ice climbing). The creation of the ICCC and the IFSC also led to the creation of numerous country-level competition climbing associations, some of which are sub-organizations of longer-standing &quot;representative bodies&quot; (e.g. GB Climbing is a sub-group of the British Mountaineering Council), and some of which are completely independent (e.g. USA Climbing).

In addition to the above international and national representative bodies, specialist groups have been established to represent the interests of rock climbing in particular areas, a notable example being The Access Fund, a North American body whose focus is on securing and maintaining access to climbing areas and of promoting responsible and ethical behavior within those areas.

<text>The Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine (PCRM) is a non-profit research and advocacy organization based in Washington, D.C. According to Charity Navigator, the organization works for &quot;compassionate and effective medical practice, research, and health promotion.&quot;

==Campaigns==
=== Healthy hospital food ===
The PCRM releases an annual report ranking the healthfulness of hospital food. It also encourages hospitals to replace fast food with more healthful options. In January 2016, PCRM placed billboards that read &quot;Eat more chickpeas&quot; near hospitals that host Chick-fil-A locations. In May 2016, it spoke before the board of Grady Memorial Hospital in Atlanta and erected billboards that read &quot;Ask your local hospital to go #FastFoodFree.&quot; In June 2016, Grady announced that its McDonald&#x27;s was shutting down.

=== 2015–2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans ===
When the Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee (DGAC) announced in February 2015 that &quot;cholesterol is not a nutrient of concern for overconsumption&quot;, the PCRM began working to keep cholesterol warnings in the 2015 Dietary Guidelines for Americans. In March 2015, Neal Barnard presented oral testimony at the National Institutes of Health, stating: &quot;for all its good work, the Committee made a scientific error on cholesterol and to carry this glaring mistake into the Guidelines is not scientifically defensible&quot;. In October 2015, the PCRM placed billboards reading &quot;#CholesterolKills&quot; near the Texas home offices of Agriculture Committee chairman K. Michael Conaway. In January 2016, the PCRM filed a lawsuit alleging that the DGAC recommended dropping limits on dietary cholesterol, motivated by industry pressure, according to documents recovered by the PCRM under the Freedom of Information Act.

The 2015–2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans, released in January 2016, set no limit but recommended Americans &quot;eat as little dietary cholesterol as possible&quot; due to &quot;the commonality of food sources of saturated fats and dietary cholesterol&quot;. On March 23, 2016, Neal Barnard told &quot;The Washington Post&quot; that he liked that &quot;the guidelines reinstated the advice to eat as little cholesterol as possible and finally called out a vegetarian eating pattern as one of three healthy options&quot;.
In 2021, the Committee sued USDA Secretary Tom Vilsack and secretary for Department of Health and Human Services Xavier Becerra after the release of the guidelines, alleging the government&#x27;s nutritional and dietary guidelines intentionally use difficult language to promote eating unhealthy foods. A federal judge in San Francisco dismissed the lawsuit in February 2023.

=== Wayne State University dog experiments ===
Since 2011, the PCRM has urged Wayne State University to end its heart failure experiments on dogs. According to a 2015 review article by PCRM doctors in the &quot;American Journal of Translational Research&quot;: &quot;insights gleaned from decades of animal-based research efforts have not been proportional to research success in terms of deciphering human heart failure and developing effective therapeutics for human patients&quot;. In 2015, actor and Wayne State alumna Lily Tomlin joined the PCRM in urging Wayne State to end its dog experiments. In September 2015, the PCRM placed billboards in Detroit that told the story of one of the dogs who died in the experiments.

===Ending medical school live animal laboratories===
On June 30, 2016, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; reported that the University of Tennessee—the last remaining school to use animals—e-mailed the PCRM that &quot;effective immediately, the University of Tennessee College of Medicine Chattanooga has ceased to provide surgical skills training for medical students using live animal models&quot;. Over the years, the Physicians Committee demonstrated and placed billboards leading to the decision. The University of Tennessee&#x27;s announcement followed the decision by the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine to end live animal use in its surgery-skills training. In 2014, PCRM members had demonstrated outside the university. In February 2016, the PCRM worked with Maryland State Delegate Shane Robinson to introduce a bill to end the practice in Maryland. On May 18, 2016, &quot;The Baltimore Sun&quot; reported that Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine would stop using live animals.

===Chemical testing===
Since 2007, the PCRM has urged reform of the Toxic Substances Control Act of 1976. On June 22, 2015, President Barack Obama signed into law the Frank R. Lautenberg Chemical Safety for the 21st Century Act, which contains language requiring chemical companies and the Environmental Protection Agency to replace and reduce animal tests and increase the use of human-relevant methods. The Physicians Committee supported passage of this law.

===Atkins Diet===
&quot;The New York Times&quot; writes that, in 2004, the PCRM passed Robert Atkins&#x27;s postmortem medical report to &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;. The report, obtained by Richard Fleming of the Fleming Heart and Health Institute, showed that Atkins himself had experienced heart attack, congestive heart failure, and weighed 258 pounds. Atkins supporters countered that there was no reason to suppose that his heart problem (cardiomyopathy) was diet-related, and that the PCRM had received the coroner&#x27;s report in violation of federal law.

===Action against fast food===
The organization&#x27;s nutrition director in 2004, Amy Lanou criticized the U.S. Department of Agriculture for promoting high-fat, high-calorie products, such as certain brands of cookies and fast-food products. Susan M. Levin, the PCRM&#x27;s director of nutrition education, sent a letter in March 2009 to the minor league baseball team, the West Michigan Whitecaps, to object to a four-pound, 4,800-calorie hamburger on the team&#x27;s concession-stand menu, and to ask that the team put a label on the burger indicating that it was a &quot;dietary disaster&quot;. The PCRM has also spoken out against the Las Vegas restaurant Heart Attack Grill.

The Physicians Committee advertising campaign &quot;I was lovin&#x27; it&quot;, a spoof of the McDonald&#x27;s advertising slogan &quot;I&#x27;m lovin&#x27; it&quot;, was used in a September 2010 advertising campaign encouraging consumers to adopt a vegetarian diet to avoid the health risks associated with the high levels of dietary fat, cholesterol, and sodium in McDonald&#x27;s food. The campaign launched in the Washington, D.C., area showed a grieving woman in a morgue, as the camera circled around a middle-aged man draped in a white sheet and clutching a partially-eaten hamburger. The group highlighted the high levels of fat and sodium in products such as the &quot;Double quarter pounder with cheese extra value meal&quot;, which at the time contained 61 grams of fat and 1,650 milligrams of sodium. The group chose Washington, D.C., as the first city for the campaign because it had the second-highest rate of deaths associated with heart disease. McDonald&#x27;s called the ad &quot;outrageous, misleading and unfair&quot;, and encouraged customers &quot;to put such outlandish propaganda in perspective, and to make food and lifestyle choices that are right for them.&quot; The National Restaurant Association called such ads misleading, saying that they unnecessarily focus on a single item to &quot;distort the reality that the nation&#x27;s restaurants are serving an increasing array of healthful menu choices.&quot;

==Reception==

PCRM had in the past received donations from animal protection groups, including People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA), as cited in 2004 by The Guardian.

<text>The Tampa Bay area is a major metropolitan area surrounding Tampa Bay on the Gulf Coast of Florida in the United States. It includes the main cities of Tampa, St. Petersburg, and Clearwater. It is the 17th-largest metropolitan area in the United States, with a population of 3,175,275 as of the 2020 U.S. census.

The exact boundaries of the metro area can differ in different contexts. Hillsborough County and Pinellas County (including the cities of Tampa, St. Petersburg, Clearwater, and various smaller communities) make up the most limited definition. This area includes most of the Tampa Bay bayfront, aside from the far southern portion which lies in Manatee County. The U.S. Office of Management and Budget (OMB) defines the Tampa–St. Petersburg–Clearwater Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) as including Hillsborough and Pinellas Counties as well as Hernando and Pasco Counties to the north; and it is the 18th-most populous MSA in the country. The MSA was first defined in 1950 as the Tampa-St. Petersburg, Florida Standard Metropolitan Area, and included Hillsborough and Pinellas counties. Pasco County was added to the MSA in 1973. In 1983, Hernando County was added to the MSA and Clearwater was added to the MSA name. The OMB has designated Tampa, St. Petersburg, Clearwater, Largo, and Pinellas Park as the principal cities of the MSA. Unlike most large metropolitan areas, Tampa does not belong to any combined statistical area and is the largest MSA in the United States not to belong to one.

Other definitions of the Tampa Bay area include:
*The four counties in the MSA plus Citrus and Manatee Counties, used by the Tampa Bay Regional Planning Council.
*The four counties in the MSA plus Citrus, Manatee and Sarasota Counties, used by the Tampa Bay Area Regional Transportation Authority
*The four counties in the MSA plus Citrus, Manatee, Sarasota and Polk Counties, used by the Tampa Bay Partnership and the Tampa Bay media market.

This wider area may also be known as West Central Florida as part of Central Florida.

==History==
When the Spanish first arrived in the area of Tampa Bay, they encountered people of the Safety Harbor culture. About 20 sites with temple mounds have been found around Tampa Bay, with several in Pinellas County.

== Politics ==
The Tampa Bay metropolitan area has traditionally been considered a bellwether region in Florida. However, since Donald Trump became the Republican nominee and carried the area by three points in 2016, it has exhibited a slight Republican lean. In the 2020 election, while suburban areas across the country shifted significantly away from Trump, Tampa Bay moved only 0.4 percentage points to the left. This trend was likely influenced by gains among Hispanic voters, which offset the defection of white suburbanites. By the 2024 election, Trump won the metro area by a double-digit margin.

==Geography==

The Tampa Bay area is located along Tampa Bay which it is named for. Pinellas County and St. Petersburg, Florida lies on a peninsula between Tampa Bay and the Gulf of Mexico, and much of the city of Tampa, Florida lies on a smaller peninsula jutting out into Tampa Bay.

===Climate===

The Tampa Bay area has a humid subtropical climate (Koppen &quot;Cfa&quot;) with hot, humid summers, with daily thunderstorms, drier, predominantly sunny winters, and warm-to-hot springs with a pronounced dry season maximum. On average, two days experience frost per year in the cooler parts of the Tampa Bay area, less than annually in the coastal parts. However, hard freezes (low temperatures below ) are very rare, occurring only a few times in the last 75 years. The United States Department of Agriculture designates the area as being in hardiness zones 9b and 10a. Coastal parts of the Tampa Bay area closely border a tropical savanna climate (As) with many tropical microclimates due to maritime influences of the Gulf of Mexico and the 400-square-mile Tampa Bay. Plant climate-indicator species such as coconut palms and royal palms, as well as other elements of south Florida&#x27;s native tropical flora, reach their northern limits of reliable culture and native range in the area. Highs usually range between year-round. Tampa&#x27;s official high has never reached —the all-time record high temperature is . St. Petersburg&#x27;s all-time record high is exactly .

Pinellas County lies on a peninsula between Tampa Bay and the Gulf of Mexico, and much of the city of Tampa lies on a smaller peninsula jutting out into Tampa Bay. This proximity to large bodies of water both moderates local temperatures and introduces large amounts of humidity into the atmosphere. In general, the communities farthest from the coast have more extreme temperature differences, both during a single day and throughout the seasons of the year.
==Economy==
As of July 1, 2019, the largest employers within the Tampa Bay area are:
