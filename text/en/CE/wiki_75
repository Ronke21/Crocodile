<text>Boavista Futebol Clube, commonly known as Boavista (), is a Portuguese professional sports club from the of Porto. Founded on 1 August 1903 by British entrepreneurs and Portuguese textile workers, it is one of the oldest clubs in the country and plays in the Primeira Liga, Portuguese football&#x27;s top flight.

Boavista grew to become an important sports club in Portugal, with sections dedicated to several sports including football, chess, gymnastics, bicycle racing, futsal, volleyball, rink hockey, and boxing, among others, with the most notable being the football section with their trademark chequered white and black shirts.

With 9 major domestic trophies won (1 Championship, 5 Portuguese Cups and 3 domestic Super Cups, all during the presidencies of Valentim Loureiro or João Loureiro, of the Loureiro family), Boavista is the most decorated Portuguese football club after the &quot;Big Three&quot; (Benfica, Porto and Sporting CP). Boavista spent 39 consecutive seasons in the Primeira Liga (50 in total) and, together with Belenenses, is the only team outside the &quot;Big Three&quot; to have won the Portuguese Championship, in the 2000–01 season. Boavista has a rivalry with fellow city club Porto; the matches between the clubs are sometimes called &quot;Invicta derby&quot;.

Its stadium, Estádio do Bessa, was built in 1973, although football had been played there at the former Campo do Bessa since the 1910s, and revamped for use in Euro 2004.

==History==
===Foundation and the chequered shirts (1903–1933)===

The club was founded on 1 August 1903, in the Boavista area of the western part of the city of Porto, by two English brothers, Harry and Dick Lowe. Having received an imported football from their father in England, they founded The Boavista Footballers, and an early rival was another English club in the city, the Oporto Cricket and Lawn Tennis Club. The team had an early schism as its British contingent refused to play on Sundays due to their Anglican faith, while the Catholic locals could only play on Sundays due to work commitments; the locals won, drastically changing the demographics of the club. In 1910 the current name was adopted, and on 11 April that year the ground now occupied by the Estádio do Bessa was inaugurated with a match against Leixões SC. In 1913–14, the team won the inaugural Porto Football Association.

In the 1920s the club increased the number of sports practiced. The team boasted &quot;the best defensive trio of the North&quot;: goalkeeper Casoto and defenders Lúzia and Óscar Vasques de Carvalho. In the following decade, the club lobbied for the legalisation of professionalism after being sanctioned, having been investigated after complaining that FC Porto had paid Boavista&#x27;s Nova to join them. In 1933, the club adopted its black-and-white shirts, based on a French team that club president Artur Oliveira Valença had watched.

===League entry and golden 1970s (1934–1980)===
Boavista&#x27;s first decades in league football saw the club bounce between the Primeira and the Segunda Divisão, winning the latter&#x27;s title in 1937 and 1950. In 1966, they fell to the Terceira Divisão, and stayed there for two years.

The team bounced back to the top flight by 1970 with two consecutive promotions, finished renovation of its stadium two years later and in 1974 hired manager José Maria Pedroto and president Valentim Loureiro. In their first year, Boavista achieved their best classification of fourth in the 1974-1975 championship, and won the Taça de Portugal for the first time after defeating Benfica 2–1 in the final. A year later, the club finished as runners-up to S.L. Benfica by two points, and defended their cup title by defeating Vitória de Guimarães 2–1 in the 1976 final at rival Porto&#x27;s Estádio das Antas; Pedroto left for Porto at the end of the season.

Experienced English manager Jimmy Hagan led the club to its third Taça de Portugal win in five years after defeating Sporting CP 1–0 in the replay of the 1979 final, after a 1–1 draw occurred the day prior. At the beginning of the following season, Porto and Boavista organised the first edition of the Portuguese Supercup, a season-opening match between the league and cup holders. The match was contested at the Estádio das Antas, and Boavista (with new manager Mário Lino) beat Pedroto&#x27;s Porto 2–1 in a violent match where Boavista had two men sent off.

===From contenders to champions and European forays (1980–2003)===

In 1997, Valentim Loureiro was succeeded as president by his son João, who at 34 was the youngest in the whole league. Also, former Portugal international Jaime Pacheco was appointed manager, and led the club to runners-up in 1999 and fourth place in 2000. In 2000–01, they won the derby in the second half of the season against Porto and went on to win the league with a 3–0 win over C.D. Aves on 18 May. This was only the second time that a team from outside the Big Three won the league, after C.F. Os Belenenses in 1946. Pacheco&#x27;s team conceded just 22 goals in 34 games and lost at home only once. The team featured Ricardo in goal, academy product Petit in midfield, Bolivian free-kick specialist Erwin Sánchez in attacking midfield, Duda and Martelinho on the wings, and Brazilian striker Elpídio Silva was the club&#x27;s top scorer with 11 goals.

After finishing runners-up to Sporting a year later, the squad began to break up, with Petit heading to Benfica and fellow midfielder Pedro Emanuel going to Porto; both skippered their new teams. The club rebuilt the Estádio do Bessa for UEFA Euro 2004, contributing to their financial problems. Pacheco left for Spain&#x27;s RCD Mallorca in 2003, returning soon to replace Sánchez briefly as manager the following year, and came back again in October 2006.

Boavista were regulars in UEFA competitions in the 1990 and early 2000s. In the 2002–03 UEFA Cup, they reached the semi-finals before a 2–1 aggregate loss to Celtic due to a late Henrik Larsson strike; they would have faced Porto in the final.

===Downfall and return (2008–present)===
In June 2008, Boavista was sentenced to relegation for its part in the &quot;Apito Dourado&quot; (Golden Whistle) matchfixing scandal, for three games in the 2003–04 season. A year later the club was relegated again: originally saved by promoted club F.C. Vizela being sanctioned for corruption, the team withdrew from the second division for financial reasons.

In January 2013, João Loureiro, pressed by thousands of members of the club to return to the presidency, was elected president once again. After a long legal battle, in June 2013, Boavista was entitled the right to come back to the Primeira Liga. Also, after a negotiation with the creditors of the club, the €65 million debt was cut in half. After a six-year absence, Boavista returned to the Primeira Liga in the 2014–15 season, coached by Petit, a member of the title-winning side of 2001.

In October 2020, Boavista&#x27;s members approved of investment from Spanish-Luxembourgish businessman Gérard Lopez, owner of Ligue 1 club Lille OSC. Petit returned as manager, leading the club to the Taça da Liga semi-finals for the first time in 2021–22.

==Stadium==

The Estádio do Bessa (later Estádio do Bessa XXI) is Boavista&#x27;s home ground, used for football and occasionally for music concerts. The stadium was first used in 1911, then known as &#x27;Campo do Bessa&#x27;.

The stadium had several renovations in its history, namely in 1967–72, where turf was installed as well as floodlights. Like other stadiums used in UEFA Euro 2004, the stadium was rebuilt for the competition, but on top of the old stands, and each one of them at a different time, allowing Boavista to continue playing there. It cost €45,164,726, from which €7,785,735 were supported from the Portuguese state, and featured an all-seater capacity of 28,263 spectators. Plans for improvement actually existed before the organization of the Euro 2004 was given to Portugal in 1999, and by then, the first works were already underway. It was designed by Grupo 3 Arquitectura.

The stadium has also been used several times in matches of the Portuguese national team.

==Colours==
Boavista&#x27;s black-and-white chequered shirt was introduced by journalist and club president Artur Oliveira Valença, based on a French team he had seen.

==Women&#x27;s team==
The women&#x27;s team is one of the strongest in Portugal, having won several titles in a row during the 1990s, as well as the formation U-19, U-17. U-15 and U-13 teams, that won all national championships, and brought up several talented and famous international players.

<text>OAKA Basketball Arena, previously known as Olympic Indoor Hall of O.A.C.A., is a part of the Spyros Louis Olympic Athletic Center of Athens (). It was completed in 1994 and is the largest indoor venue in Greece. It was used for sporting events at the 2004 Summer Olympics. The venue is located in Marousi, a northern suburb of Athens. During its construction, it was considered to be one of the biggest and most modern indoor sports arenas in all of Europe.

The 18,300-capacity arena is accompanied by an adjacent training facility, and a parking lot.

In 2023, Panathinaikos B.C. signed an agreement with the Greek state for a 49-year concession of the asset, making the club the sole tenant and binding it to invest in the renovation of the asset&#x27;s infrastructure. The club has since transferred the responsibility of managing the venue to White Veil S.A., a company which specializes in venue and facilities management, and is also owned by Dimitris Giannakopoulos.

==Construction==

The Olympic Indoor Hall is notable for its distinctive A-frame roof that features four huge pillars, each of which is 35 meters tall, that stand 108 meters apart from each other. According to the Greek Ministry of Sports, it is the largest indoor sporting arena of its kind in the world. The arena is also constructed in a unique way so that an abundant amount of natural light comes into the arena during the day.

The arena seats up to 17,600 for gymnastics events, although only 12,500 seats were made publicly available for the gymnastics competition at the 2004 Olympics. It seats up to 19,443 for basketball games, which includes 300 seats for media members, and 189 seats for VIPs.

A large scale arena renovation was completed in 2004, for the 2004 Summer Olympics.

==2004 Summer Olympics==

The arena was used for artistic gymnastics and trampolining, and also hosted the finals of the basketball matches at the 2004 Summer Olympics. Renovation of the building for the Olympics was completed on 30 June 2004, and it was officially reopened on 10 August 2004, shortly before the beginning of the games.

==Basketball use==
The Indoor Hall is the regular home court for the Greek Basket League professional basketball club Panathinaikos. It is also the primary home court of the senior Greek National Basketball Team.

The arena was used to host the quarterfinals, semifinals, and finals stages of the 1998 FIBA World Championship.

On 4 and 6 May 2007, the Indoor Hall hosted the EuroLeague 2006–07 season&#x27;s Final Four, the semifinals and finals rounds of Europe&#x27;s principal pro club competition in basketball, which saw hometown favourite Panathinaikos win the title.

On 9 December 2007, FIBA announced that the Olympic Indoor Hall was selected as the host of the 2008 FIBA Olympic Qualifying Tournament for the 2008 Summer Olympic Games. At the qualifying tournament, hosts and favourites Greece, along with the German and Croatian national basketball teams, qualified for the final 2008 Olympic Basketball Tournament.

In 2023 Panathinaikos B.C. and the Greek government reached agreement for the exclusive use of the Athens gym for the next 49 years.

==Musical events==
On 18 and 20 May 2006, the Hall hosted the 51st Eurovision Song Contest, that was held in Athens, after Greece&#x27;s victory at the Song Contest in 2005. There were 15,000 seats available for spectators, both for the semifinal and the grand final.

Some of the entertainers who have performed at the arena include Bryan Adams, Maluma, Rotting Christ, Pearl Jam, Enrique Iglesias, Depeche Mode, Jennifer Lopez, Björk, Beyoncé, Slayer, Roger Waters, Aloha from Hell, Tokio Hotel, Helena Paparizou, Sakis Rouvas, Anna Vissi and Cigarettes After Sex.

<text>The Metropolitan School District of Wayne Township is a school district located in Indianapolis, Indiana, United States, serving Wayne Township in western Marion County. It is known for its high school, Ben Davis, which was founded in 1892. The district also operates 2 seventh and eighth grade centers, one ninth grade center, and 11 elementary schools. Recently, a ninth-grade center was built alongside Ben Davis to address the specific needs of ninth grade students. Currently, the former Fulton Junior High has been renovated and reconstructed and reopened in 2007 as Chapel Hill Seventh and Eighth Grade Center. The district received a new superintendent, Dr. Jeff Butts, in 2011.

In addition to the many courses available at Ben Davis, there is the Area 31 Career Center that focuses on upper-class students (juniors and seniors). The courses available at the center include everything from computer programming to cosmetics, and help get a jump-start into entering a college course. Students from 11 high schools in Marion, Hendricks, and Morgan Counties can come to the Career Center at Ben Davis and take courses during the regular school day. The district also has an extensive adult-education program and has opened Ben Davis University High School, a partnership with Vincennes University.

<text>The Faliro Olympic Beach Volleyball Centre is a stadium in the Faliro Coastal Zone Olympic Complex that hosted the beach volleyball competition for the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece. The stadium holds a total of 9,600 individuals, though the public seating capacity was limited to 7,300 during the Olympics. The stadium was officially opened on August 2, 2004, a few weeks before the Olympics, though test events were held at the site a year earlier.

==After the Olympics==
As of August 2014, the venue was in a state of disuse, and was overgrown with plants.

On May 8, 2016 Hellenic Parliament passed law by which Centre was given to Ministry of Justice, Transparency and Human Rights. The stadium is proposed to become rebuilt to a courtroom.

<text>Dinara Mubinovna Safina (, ; ; born April 27, 1986) is a Russian former professional tennis player. She was ranked as the world No. 1 in women&#x27;s singles by the Women&#x27;s Tennis Association (WTA) for 26 weeks, and world No. 8 in doubles. Safina won twelve WTA Tour-level singles titles and nine in doubles, including the women&#x27;s doubles title at the 2007 US Open with Nathalie Dechy. She was the runner-up at three major singles tournaments: the 2008 French Open, 2009 Australian Open, and 2009 French Open, and won an Olympic silver medal in singles at the 2008 Beijing Olympics.

Safina officially retired in 2014 due to a long-term back injury. She is the younger sister of former world No. 1 men&#x27;s player Marat Safin; the brother–sister pair are the first to both achieve the No. 1 singles rankings.

==Biography==
===Early life===

Safina was born in Moscow to Tatar parents. Her mother Rauza Islanova was her trainer when she was younger; while her father is director of the Spartak tennis club in Moscow. Her brother Marat is a former world No. 1 on the ATP Tour. Speaking of growing up in such a successful tennis family, Safina stated: &quot;Being the little sister in such a big tennis family is not an easy situation. Maybe that&#x27;s why it took me longer to develop. My father is very competitive, but my parents didn&#x27;t put pressure on me. I wanted to find my identity. I wanted to be something by myself, like being a big player by myself. So at the beginning I was putting too much pressure on myself. But then gradually I found myself, and I learned how to do better with that situation.&quot; At age eight, Safina and her family moved to Valencia, Spain, and as a result Safina speaks fluent Spanish as well as Russian and English.

===Playing style===
Safina was coached by Glen Schaap, former coach of Anna Chakvetadze and Nadia Petrova, and Željko Krajan, who worked with her during her rise to No. 1 in 2009. From May 2010, she began working with Gastón Etlis. Their partnership ended after several months and in February 2011 she began working with Davide Sanguinetti.

==Tennis career==
===2002===
Safina made her debut in the main draw of a WTA Tour tournament in May 2002, on clay at Estoril, where she lost in the semifinals. She won her first title in Sopot, defeating two seeds – including world No. 24 Patty Schnyder – en route to the final, which she won when opponent Henrieta Nagyová retired during the second set. In doing so, she became the youngest Tour champion in four years and the first qualifier to win a title in three years. She entered the top 100 on the WTA rankings as a result of this win. Later that year, Safina made her debut at a Grand Slam tournament, losing in the second round of the US Open to top seed and eventual champion Serena Williams. In October at Kremlin Cup, she defeated a top 20 player for the first time, world No. 14 Silvia Farina Elia. She finished the season as world No. 68.

===2003===
Safina won her second title over Katarina Srebotnik at Palermo in July 2003. She lost in the first round in her debuts at the Australian Open, French Open and Wimbledon, although she reached the fourth round at the US Open before losing to second seed and eventual champion Justine Henin. She also made the quarterfinals in Doha, Sopot and Shanghai. She beat world No. 11 Magdalena Maleeva in Moscow, her best win at that point. She finished the season as world No. 54.
===2004===
At the Australian Open, Safina defeated a seed at a major event for the first time, upsetting 27th seed Amanda Coetzer in the second round before losing to second seed Kim Clijsters in the third round. However, she failed to make an impact at any of the other Grand Slam tournaments, losing in the second round of the French Open and the first round of both Wimbledon and the US Open, although she pushed eventual runner-up Elena Dementieva to three sets in the latter. She made the third final of her career and first off of clay in October at Luxembourg, losing to Alicia Molik. She finished the season as world No. 44, her first time finishing in the world&#x27;s top 50.

===2005: Fed Cup crown===
Safina continued to climb the rankings in 2005. At the Australian Open, she lost in the second round to Amélie Mauresmo. However, she defeated Mauresmo in the final in Paris three weeks later, in order to win the third title of her career. This marked her first win over a player ranked in the top 5. Following her win, Safina remarked: &quot;You can&#x27;t imagine how happy I am. I can&#x27;t find words to explain how I feel right now. It&#x27;s by far the best day of my career. I played well, took my chances and beat a top 5 player. It&#x27;s just too much in one day.&quot;

Safina won her second title of 2005 in May at Prague, defeating Zuzana Ondrášková in the final. However, she then lost in the first round of the French Open to Virginie Razzano. She won a match at Wimbledon for the first time, eventually losing in the third round to top seed Lindsay Davenport.

After losing in the first round of the US Open to Maria Elena Camerin, Safina made three semifinals in the fall – in Luxembourg, the Tier I Moscow and Hasselt. In Moscow, she defeated world No. 1 Maria Sharapova in the quarterfinals, her first victory over a number one player. She also played a key role in Russia&#x27;s victory against France in the Fed Cup, partnering Elena Dementieva to win the doubles rubber. Speaking in 2008, Safina stated: &quot;that was a great experience in my life [...] it also boosted my confidence because I showed I could play well even with the [French] crowd against me.&quot; Safina finished the year ranked world No. 20, by far her highest finish.

===2006: Top 10 debut, first Grand Slam final in doubles===
Safina started 2006 by losing in the second round of the Australian Open to Sofia Arvidsson. The highlight of the remainder of the spring hardcourt season was a run to the quarterfinals in Indian Wells, defeating fifth seed Anastasia Myskina before losing to Martina Hingis. On clay, Safina reached her first final at a Tier I tournament in Rome, defeating top 10 players Kim Clijsters, Elena Dementieva, and Svetlana Kuznetsova, before being defeated by Hingis.

At the French Open, Safina made the quarterfinals at a Grand Slam for the first time in her career. In the fourth round, she defeated fourth-seeded Maria Sharapova. In the third set, she trailed 1–5 and was down a match point but won after almost 2½ hours of play. She went on to lose to Kuznetsova in the next round. To kick off the grass court season, she reached her first grass court final at &#x27;s-Hertogenbosch, losing to Michaëlla Krajicek.

She finished the season world No. 11.

===2007: US Open doubles champion===
Safina won her first tournament of 2007 in Gold Coast, defeating Martina Hingis in the final. Following the match, Hingis praised Safina, saying that &quot;everyone should watch her because she&#x27;s gonna be maybe even better than her brother&quot;, and that she has &quot;more will and desire&quot; than Safin. She also won the doubles title at the tournament. She then lost in the third round of the Australian Open to Li Na.

Safina reached her second final of the year at the Tier I Charleston in April, after retirements from Tatiana Golovin and Vera Zvonareva in the quarterfinals and semifinals respectively. In the final, she lost to Jelena Janković. After reaching the quarterfinals at both Berlin and Rome, Safina lost to Serena Williams in the fourth round of the French Open. During May, she moved up to world No. 9, the highest ranking of her career at the time.

Safina lost in the fourth round of the US Open to world No. 1 and eventual champion Justine Henin. At the tournament, she partnered Nathalie Dechy to win the women&#x27;s doubles title, her first Grand Slam title. In October, Safina achieved only her second win over a player ranked in the top 10 that season, defeating world No. 6 Anna Chakvetadze en route to the semifinals of Moscow. She finished the season as world No. 16.

===2008: First French Open final, Olympic silver===
Safina started 2008 poorly, winning just 11 of her first 21 matches. Her best result in singles play during this period was a run to the quarterfinals of Miami, defeating Lindsay Davenport in the fourth round. Safina has admitted that she was considering quitting tennis during this period. Meanwhile, she won doubles titles in Gold Coast, partnering Ágnes Szávay; and in Indian Wells, partnering Elena Vesnina.

In May, at the clay-court event in Berlin, Safina defeated world No. 1 Justine Henin in the third round. Safina went on to defeat Serena Williams for the first time in the quarterfinals, ending Williams&#x27;s 17-match winning streak. She then defeated Elena Dementieva in the final to win the first Tier I title of her career. Safina retrospectively called the tournament &quot;the key to her tennis life&quot;. As the 13th seed at the French Open, Safina defeated new world No. 1 Maria Sharapova, having saved a match point. In the quarterfinals, Safina defeated Dementieva, after saving match points again. Then, in her first Grand Slam semifinal, Safina defeated Svetlana Kuznetsova, before losing to Ana Ivanovic in the final. Her results at this tournament caused her ranking to rise to world No. 9.
On grass, Safina lost in the final of &#x27;s-Hertogenbosch to Tamarine Tanasugarn. At Wimbledon, Safina lost in the third round to Israeli Shahar Pe&#x27;er.

At Los Angeles in July, Safina defeated top-seeded Jelena Janković in the semifinals before claiming her second title of the year by defeating Flavia Pennetta in the final. The following week, Safina won the Tier I Montreal, defeating Dominika Cibulková in the final. This marked the first time in her career that she had won titles at back-to-back tournaments, and it moved her up to world No. 6, her highest career ranking at the time. She also won the US Open Series as a result of this victory.

Representing Russia at the Beijing Olympics, Safina defeated world No. 1 Jelena Janković in the quarterfinals in three sets, making her the first player in the history of the WTA Tour to defeat three different reigning World No. 1 players in the same year. In the semifinals, she defeated Li Na in straight sets. In the gold medal match, Safina lost to Dementieva in three sets while serving 23 double faults. She went into the US Open as one of five women who could have taken the world No. 1 ranking, depending on their results in this tournament. However, she lost in the semifinals to the eventual champion Serena Williams. After this tournament, her ranking rose to a career high of world No. 5.

Safina won her third Tier I title of the year and fourth title overall in Tokyo in September, defeating Kuznetsova in the final. This win moved her ranking to a new career-high of world No. 3, before later briefly becoming the No. 2 in October. She qualified for the year-ending WTA Championships for the first time in her career, but she lost all three of her round robin matches. She finished the year ranked No. 3, the first time she had finished a year in the world&#x27;s top 10.

===2009: Australian &amp; French Open finals, world No. 1===
Safina began 2009 by representing Russia with her brother Marat Safin in the Hopman Cup. They lost to the Slovakian team in the final.

Safina played her first WTA Tour tournament of the season in Sydney, where she lost in the final to Elena Dementieva. At the Australian Open, Safina defeated Alizé Cornet in the fourth round. Safina defeated the Australian wild-card entry Jelena Dokić in the quarterfinals and Vera Zvonareva in the semifinals to reach the second Grand Slam final of her career. She lost to Serena Williams in the final in 59 minutes. After losing early in Dubai to Virginie Razzano, Safina went on to the Indian Wells tournament, where she reached the quarterfinals before losing to Victoria Azarenka. In Miami, Safina lost in the third round to Samantha Stosur.

On April 20, Safina became the 19th player, and second Russian after Maria Sharapova, to be ranked world No. 1 by the WTA. Safina and her brother Marat Safin are the first ever brother-sister world No. 1 pair, with Safin having been ranked world No. 1 by the ATP earlier in his career.

Safina started the clay season with fresh determination to win a Grand Slam. Playing in her first tournament as the world No. 1, Safina lost in the final of the indoor clay court event in Stuttgart to Svetlana Kuznetsova. The following week in Rome, Safina defeated Venus Williams in the semifinals, and Kuznetsova in the final. Safina then advanced to the final at the Madrid event, where she defeated Caroline Wozniacki to win her second consecutive title. As the top seed at the French Open, Safina dropped only five games in advancing to the quarterfinals. She eventually advanced to her third Grand Slam final and second straight French Open final, where she lost to Kuznetsova in straight sets.

At Wimbledon, Safina advanced to the fourth round for the first time, where she defeated 2006 champion Amélie Mauresmo. She went on to reach the semifinals before losing to Venus Williams. She lost 1–6, 0–6 which is the biggest defeat for a current number one in WTA Tour history. Her performance invoked criticism about her status as the No. 1 player in particular from the new Wimbledon champion and world No. 2, Serena Williams who openly mocked her credibility as the top player.

After winning a small tournament in Portorož, Safina failed to defend her title in Los Angeles. Despite this, she became the first player to qualify for the WTA Tour Championships. The following week in Cincinnati, Safina advanced to her eighth final of the season, losing to former world No. 1 Jelena Janković. Safina was the top seed at the US Open, but lost in the third round to Petra Kvitová.

Following back-to-back second round losses in Tokyo and Beijing, Safina lost the No. 1 rank to Serena Williams. She regained it two weeks later on October 26. At the WTA Championships, she had a chance to end the season as No. 1 for the first time in her career, but retired due to a back injury in her first round robin match, which she claimed had been bothering her for three months.

===2010: Beginning of career decline===

Safina started 2010 by losing in the quarterfinals to Elena Dementieva in Sydney. At the Australian Open, she reached the fourth round where she retired with a back injury which also forced her to withdraw from tournaments in Dubai, Indian Wells, and Miami.

In her return to competitive tennis for the clay season, Safina lost in the quarterfinals of Stuttgart to Shahar Pe&#x27;er. She struggled through the rest of the clay season, losing her opening matches in Rome, Madrid and the French Open, causing her ranking to drop to No. 20. She later withdrew from Wimbledon after being dealt her fifth straight loss at a warm-up tournament in &#x27;s-Hertogenbosch.

She began the US Open Series at the Bank of the West Classic in Stanford, California, where Safina was given a wildcard. She played veteran Kimiko Date-Krumm in the first round. Safina lost in three sets.

In the first round of the Mercury Insurance Open in San Diego, California, Safina ended her 6 match losing streak when she defeated Alona Bondarenko in the first round. She then lost to Agnieszka Radwańska in the second round.

Safina&#x27;s next tournament was at the Western &amp; Southern Financial Group Masters and Women&#x27;s Open in Cincinnati. In the second round, she lost to Kim Clijsters. Due to her inability to defend her points from 2009, she dropped from world No. 35 to No. 70.
At the Rogers Cup she scored wins over world No. 36 Andrea Petkovic and No. 21 Nadia Petrova to reach the third round, where she lost to sixth seed Francesca Schiavone. Safina defeated Schiavone in the first round of the Pilot Pen Tennis in New Haven, but lost to Maria Kirilenko in the quarterfinals. At the US Open, Safina was eliminated in the first round by Daniela Hantuchová.

Safina accepted a wild card from the Hansol Korea Open, where she defeated qualifier Simona Halep in the first round. She also won against Maria Kirilenko in straight sets. She lost to Klára Zakopalová in the quarterfinals. Safina was unseeded coming into the Pan Pacific Open in Tokyo, where she faced Julia Görges of Germany in the first round, but lost in three sets. At the China Open, Safina lost to Vera Zvonareva in the first round.

===2011: Final year===
At the ASB Classic in Auckland, New Zealand, Safina was defeated by No.2 seed Yanina Wickmayer in the first round. In the Hobart International, facing Marion Bartoli in the first round, she lost again in two sets. At the Australian Open, she was defeated by eventual champion Kim Clijsters in the first round with a double bagel.

At the Malaysian Open, Dinara was able to end her six-match losing streak with her first win since September 2010, defeating Han Xinyun. Then she lost against Šafářová. Safina next competed at BNP Paribas Open, where she reached the fourth round, including wins over 26th seed Daniela Hantuchová and world No. 4 Samantha Stosur. Her run came to an end against Maria Sharapova in the fourth round. Safina announced she would not compete for the rest of 2011 because of a persistent back injury (stress fracture).

Safina allegedly retired from professional tennis, as announced by her brother Marat Safin, on October 7, 2011: &quot;Dinara has decided to end her career&quot;, Safin said. &quot;She has taken the decision relatively well. She considers it just to be the end of a period in her life.&quot; Safin said the main reason for his 25-year-old sister&#x27;s retirement was a chronic back injury. &quot;Everything is all right with her health. She feels good in everyday life, but (the back injury means) she simply can&#x27;t play tennis professionally any more.&quot; However, Dinara Safina herself later that day issued a Twitter message, where she said she had not made any retirement decision yet, and that she needed more time to decide.

===Since 2012===
Dinara announced on June 12, 2012, that she requested wildcards for the Bank of the West Classic in Stanford, the Montreal Open, the Cincinnati Open and the US Open. In a later interview, she announced that she withdrew the requests for wildcard entries for all tournaments for 2012. In late 2012, Safina was linked to doping doctor Luis Garcia del Moral.

In 2014, Safina officially retired from tennis after the final day of Madrid Open following years of injuries.

==Rivalries==
===Safina vs. Kuznetsova===
Safina and fellow Russian Svetlana Kuznetsova met 14 times, with Safina leading their head-to-head 8–6. Kuznetsova led their rivalry on clay courts but trailed their rivalry on hard courts. The pair never met on grass. Their last meeting was in the final of the 2009 French Open, with Kuznetsova winning in straight sets and reversing a semi-final loss to Safina from twelve months earlier.

Safina and Dementieva have been playing each other since 2003, four times on clay, five times on hard and one on grass and carpet, their series ended 6–5 in Dementieva&#x27;s favour. Their most significant meeting was at the final of the 2008 Summer Olympics which Dementieva won in three sets and a gold medal for Russia.

<doc id="927913" wikidata="Q4951568" url="?curid=927913" title="Box step">
<text>Box step is a basic dance step named after the pattern it creates on the floor, which is that of a square or box. It is used in a number of American Style ballroom dances: rumba, waltz, bronze-level foxtrot. While it can be performed individually, it is usually done with a partner. This is the most common dance step in the waltz. In international standard dance competition, there is a similar step called closed change.

In a typical example, the leader begins with the left foot and proceeds as follows.
*First half-box: forward-side-together
*Second half-box: backwards-side-together
Every step is with full weight transfer.

Rhythm varies. For example, it is &quot;1-2-3, 4-5-6&quot; in waltz and &quot;slow quick quick, slow quick quick&quot; in rumba.

In other dances (and in variations) the box may start from the left or right foot, either back or forward, or even sidewise. For example, in the figure of the leader steps (starting with the left foot) &quot;left-together-back, right-together-forward&quot;.

== In waltz ==
For the left box, the leader starts with their feet closed. On beat 1 they step forward with their left foot, then they step to the side with their right foot on 2, closes their left to their right foot on 3; steps back with their right foot on 4, to the side with their left foot on 5, and closes their right to their left foot on 6. During the second and fifth step, the foot is supposed to travel along two sides of the box, rather than along its diagonal.

The follower also starts with their feet closed. On beat 1 they step back with their right foot, then they step to the side with their left foot on 2, closes their right to their left foot on 3; steps forward with their left foot on 4, to the side with their right foot on 5, and closes their left to their right foot on 6.

The right box consists of the same steps only mirrored, that is, left and right feet are exchanged for both leader and follower.

==In popular culture==
This dance was featured in an episode of &quot;Curious George&quot; called &quot;School of Dance&quot;. George first saw the Renkins doing it, then he taught it to Bill, the Quints, the Man with the Yellow Hat, and at the end, Allie.

<doc id="927917" wikidata="Q1349108" url="?curid=927917" title="Madlax">
<text>is a 26-episode Japanese anime television series produced in 2004 by the Bee Train animation studio. Kōichi Mashimo directed &quot;Madlax&quot; and the soundtrack was composed by Yuki Kajiura. The DVD version was released by ADV Films in North America and the United Kingdom and by Madman Entertainment in Australia and New Zealand.

The story revolves around the two young women Margaret and Madlax, who seemingly have little in common and do not know of the other&#x27;s existence at the beginning. Madlax is a legendary mercenary and assassin in the fictional civil war-torn country of Gazth-Sonika, who cannot remember her past or indeed her real name before twelve years ago, when the war started. The other main character is Margaret Burton, the sole heir of a wealthy aristocratic family in the peaceful European country Nafrece. Twelve years before the story begins, an airliner Margaret and her mother were on crashed over Gazth-Sonika, and its passengers, as well as Margaret&#x27;s father who led the rescuers, have been missing ever since. Margaret, however, mysteriously traveled back to Nafrece on her own, losing her memories prior to her return; the only thing she recalls is a single word, &quot;Madlax&quot;. With this thread linking the two girls, they both independently start investigating the powerful crime syndicate Enfant after its enigmatic mastermind shows interest in both of them.

&quot;Madlax&quot; was produced as a spiritual successor to the studio&#x27;s earlier project, &quot;Noir&quot;, and together with &quot;El Cazador de la Bruja&quot;, these series constitute a trilogy exploring the &quot;girls-with-guns&quot; genre. The production of &quot;Madlax&quot; began in 2002 but it wasn&#x27;t until Yōsuke Kuroda joined the project that the series took its final form. While the critics noted the resulting similarities between &quot;Noir&quot; and &quot;Madlax&quot;, they also acknowledged the differences, such as the latter&#x27;s less episodic and more plot-driven style and, in particular contrast to the predominantly realistic &quot;Noir&quot;, incorporation of many supernatural elements, which the audience must often interpret without further explanation.

==Plot==

The first half of the series alternates between the two leads. Madlax is one of the most efficient special ops agents for hire in the war-torn Gazth-Sonika, while Margaret Burton is a sleepy, clumsy amnesiac living in Nafrece, a country styled after France. When a &quot;picture book&quot;, presumably given to Margaret by her late father, attracts the attention of international criminal network Enfant, she discovers that the origins of the book lie in Gazth-Sonika. Enfant&#x27;s top operative, Carrossea Doon, tracks Margaret down but tips off his superiors in the wrong direction, towards Madlax, who has been causing Enfant trouble for some time. Meanwhile, Vanessa Rene, Margaret&#x27;s former tutor whose parents died because of Gazth-Sonikan war, discovers that her current employer, Bookwald Industries, covertly supports the war by supplying both sides with firearms and starts investigating its true cause. Her investigation brings her to Gazth-Sonika, where Madlax is hired as her bodyguard, and together, they uncover data that proves Enfant orchestrated the entire conflict. Enfant eventually intercepts them and they are forced into hiding. Back in Nafrece, Margaret decides to help Vanessa and travels to Gazth-Sonika, accompanied by her devoted and sometimes overprotective maid Elenore Baker and Carrossea Doon.

Eventually, Madlax and Margaret meet and embark on a search for Quanzitta Marison, a Gazth-Sonikan mystic who supposedly knows about Margaret&#x27;s book, Enfant&#x27;s involvement with it, and Enfant itself. Lady Quanzitta does indeed tell them about Enfant and its plans to plunge the entire world into a total war, starting with Gazth-Sonika. She reveals that Enfant&#x27;s leader Friday Monday possesses supernatural powers connected to the three ancient books, one of which belongs to Margaret. Margaret uses her own supernatural abilities and that of her book to return her lost memories. Carrossea, who has been aiding Margaret, requests that his memories be restored as well despite warnings not to do so; he discovers that he, in fact, died 12 years ago and held on to life only by sheer force of will to protect Margaret. Carrossea disappears, and Margaret is captured by Monday who intends to use her abilities to advance his own plans.

While Margaret and Carrossea perform the ritual, Madlax is attacked by Limelda Jorg, a Gazth-Sonikan sniper who holds a grudge against Madlax ever since she failed to stop an assassination by Madlax earlier in the show. Limelda kills Vanessa while targeting Madlax, sending the latter into clinical depression. Elenore and Lady Quanzitta&#x27;s servant Nakhl manage to restore Madlax&#x27;s will to live and persuade her to save Margaret, and the three storm Enfant&#x27;s headquarters together. During the assault, Elenore is killed and Margaret, now under Monday&#x27;s control, shoots Madlax.

Believing Madlax to be dead, Monday commences a ritual to unleash people&#x27;s inhibitions and trigger worldwide anarchy; but Margaret&#x27;s memories return and she snaps out of his mind control. Only now does the audience learn the back-story: back in 1999, Monday drove Margaret&#x27;s father insane with his powers and she was forced to kill her own father. To escape the horrible truth of her patricide, Margaret split herself into three personae: the &quot;memory keeper&quot; Laetitia, the sinful Madlax, and the innocent Margaret herself. Margaret then fuses her three personae back together to undo the ritual she previously performed with Monday, saving the world from insanity. Madlax, who should no longer exist after the fusion, appears and guns down Monday. It becomes apparent that Margaret has once again split herself into three, judging that after twelve years, she no longer has the right to make decisions for her other personae.

When everything is said and done, Margaret fully releases Madlax so she can live her life freely and also adopts Laetitia as her younger sister so she won&#x27;t be alone. Madlax ultimately makes peace with Limelda and they travel together.

==Themes==
&quot;Madlax&quot; is set against the backdrop of Gazth-Sonikan war and the first episodes contrast the tranquil Nafrece with the war-torn Gazth-Sonika; later, the story moves completely to the combat zone, focusing on the central characters, such as Limelda Jorg, and their suffering. In an interview, the director Mashimo stated that &quot;[t]he story is about portraying inner struggles of people, while showing what life is like in this place of madness and this other place of peace&quot;. Accordingly, the series&#x27; title is a portmanteau of two English words, &quot;&quot; and &quot;&quot;, mirroring the authors&#x27; intention to portray the two extremes of human being.

&quot;Madlax&quot; also plays as the story of Margaret Burton&#x27;s search for her psychological identity. Based on the Mashimo Menu theme titles available to her, Yuki Kajiura has suggested an interpretation that while searching for her memories, Margaret meets the other characters (&quot;Gatekeepers&quot;) one after another and learns about the lifestyles (&quot;Gates&quot;) they represent. In the end, she finds her own &quot;Gate&quot;, which is the new identity that finally replaces the one she lost twelve years ago.

==Production==

===Writing===
According to the director Kōichi Mashimo, he envisioned &quot;Noir&quot; and &quot;Madlax&quot; as part of a trilogy exploring the girls-with-guns genre, and soon after the release of the latter, he confirmed having plans to produce the third installment, which would later become &quot;El Cazador de la Bruja&quot;. In late 2002, Mashimo invited Shigeru Kitayama, the producer of &quot;Noir&quot; who once came up with its original idea, to discuss a new series entitled &quot;Madlax&quot;. Kitayama greatly expanded Mashimo&#x27;s original screenplay plan, but it was not until Yōsuke Kuroda was put in charge of the script that the series took its final appearance. It took Kuroda around one year to finish the screenplays for all 26 episodes, during which he was constantly encouraged by Mashimo to add his own original ideas to their initial plan. Kuroda has admitted that at the time he received Mashimo&#x27;s invitation, he felt frustrated after his first project has been canceled by the publisher, so he decided to make &quot;Madlax&quot; &quot;really extravagant&quot;, blending as many genres at once as he could. Kōichi Mashimo, furthermore, admitted that the most unusual plot twists, like Margaret and Madlax&#x27;s connection to each other, were invented by Kuroda and him while drunk.

===Character design===
By comparison with &quot;Noir&quot;, &quot;Madlax&quot; features a much larger primary cast, including multiple recurring male characters, an element nearly absent in the former. It was not so in the original screenplay draft written by Mashimo and Kitayama: for example, &quot;Madlax&quot; was Margaret&#x27;s own nickname and Charlie (Vanessa&#x27;s colleague at Bookwald Industries) had one of the central roles similar to Speedy&#x27;s in &quot;Avenger&quot;. Only the &quot;draft&quot; characters&#x27; names remained of them when Kuroda has rewritten the script. A total of three character designers collaborated on &quot;Madlax&quot; cast: Satoshi Ohsawa (who also worked on &quot;Noir&quot; cast) created the central heroines Margaret and Madlax; Minako Shiba drew Friday Monday and Carrossea Doon; and Satoko Miyachi was entrusted with the &quot;mysterious&quot; characters, Laetitia and Poupee.

===Music===
As with many of studio Bee Train&#x27;s other works, the entire &quot;Madlax&quot; soundtrack was composed by the acclaimed Yuki Kajiura, making it her and Kōichi Mashimo&#x27;s fifth project together. In an interview Kajiura recalls having written the score in a hotel high-rise to save studio costs, and that this change in location helped her to explore different styles of music.

Kajiura and Yuuka Nanri&#x27;s duo FictionJunction Yuuka recorded the series&#x27; opening and ending themes, and &quot;Inside Your Heart&quot;, respectively, as well as two insert songs: &quot;nowhere&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;m here&quot;. Aside from the opening sequence, &quot;Fragments of an Eye&quot; is featured in the series itself: at the end of episode 18 and in the episode 24, when Margaret is humming its tune to herself in the flower field.

In the insert song &quot;nowhere&quot;, there is a frequently repeated background refrain . It doesn&#x27;t have any particular meaning but since the song usually plays when Madlax is fighting, &quot;Yanmaani&quot; has become something of a joke to Japanese fans, claiming that it apparently gives her superpowers.

==Media==

===Television series===

Originally, &quot;Madlax&quot; was broadcast in Japan by TV Tokyo from 5 April to 27 September 2004, from 1:30 to 2:00 a.m. every Tuesday (formally, Monday night). Shortly before the series finished airing, it has been licensed in North America and Europe by ADV Films, which has previously acquired distribution rights for &quot;Noir&quot; and has long had plans to license its successor, as well. The official English dub has been released in the United States under the trademark &quot;MADLAX&quot; on a total of seven DVDs from 12 April 2005 to 28 March 2006. A complete collection was released by ADV on 17 July 2007. &quot;Madlax&quot; has become the first series on which ADV Films&#x27; director and producer David Williams tested the technology of distributing promotional materials via P2P network BitTorrent. As of September 1, 2009, all the titles from ADV&#x27;s catalog, including Madlax, were transferred to AEsir Holdings, with distribution from Section23 Films.

The North-American DVD release contains extras available in English only, such the controversial self-parody &quot;Conversations with SSS&quot; and &quot;Sock Puppet Theater&quot;, an Easter egg live action about Madlax going after Chris Patton, Badgis&#x27; voice actor and an annoying womanizer.

On 7 February 2006, the first episode of &quot;Madlax&quot; aired on Anime Network (which was, like ADV Films, a subsidiary of A.D. Vision at the time). On 4 April, shortly after the last DVD volume has been released, the consequent broadcast was put on halt and until 27 June, only the first 8 episodes were repeated. Since then, the series has been relaunched multiple times. Madman Entertainment, who previously licensed &quot;Noir&quot; in its region, has acquired rights for distribution of &quot;Madlax&quot; in Australia and New Zealand and released it on seven DVD volumes between 20 July 2005 and 26 July 2006. A complete collection was released on 4 April 2007.

===Soundtrack===
The series&#x27; original soundtrack was released on two albums on 21 July and 22 September 2004 by Victor Entertainment. Two singles, &quot;Hitomi no Kakera&quot; and &quot;Inside Your Heart&quot;, were published in the same year by FictionJunction Yuuka, each containing an opening/ending theme and one insert song, as well as their respective karaoke versions.

===Artbook===
&quot;MADLAX the Bible&quot; is a 95-page artbook that was published in Japan on 21 May 2005 by Hobby Japan. Aside from illustrations and artworks for the series, it contains interviews with its authors and voice actors, as well as diverse additional information about the show in Japanese. The artbook has never been published outside Japan. Since the word &quot;Bible&quot; is derived from , meaning &quot;holy books&quot;, it is likely that the artbook&#x27;s title is a reference to the Holy Books that play an important role in the series&#x27; plot.

===Merchandise===
A resin model kit known as &quot;Madlax with Guns&quot; has been produced, featuring a figurine of Madlax dual wielding her signature SIG P210s. A polystone figurine entitled simply &quot;Madlax&quot;, was launched in August 2007. In Japan, a T-shirt with &quot;Madlax&quot; logo has been added to the limited edition of the first DVD volume, and the &quot;first press&quot; of the OST albums came with logotype mousepads.

===Light novel===
A light novel spin-off of the series, titled , has been published on 1 June 2011 by Hobby Japan. Written by Seiya Fujiwara and illustrated by Shunsuke Tagami (neither of whom had been involved in the production of the original TV series), the book focuses on Elenore Baker as the main character in a setting somewhat different from that of the anime. In this continuity, Elenore is a combat-trained maid traveling across the war-torn Gazth-Sonika, looking for the lost Margaret and, along the way, helping the weary locals with their struggles.
==Reception==
&quot;Madlax&quot; was often accused of being secondary and reusing &quot;Noir&quot; stylistic solutions, such as the story premise, the two heroines&#x27; appearance, and the musical style. Nevertheless, some sources praised the story for being more monolithic and consequent than its predecessor&#x27;s, owing to all its episodes and subplots being tightly intertwined and held together by the primary plot.

The majority of reviewers perceived the early episodes of &quot;Madlax&quot; as boring and too slow-paced, but some of the same critics later remarked that the prolonged exposition is crucial to the unusual finale of the series, which fully establishes the series&#x27; own identity and sets it apart from other works. According to them, after the initial volume, the story gets better and better with every new episode, though some have been dissatisfied with its &quot;pseudo-existentialistic&quot; ending. Erica Friedman, the president of Yuricon, highly praised Kuroda&#x27;s script, naming it &quot;the best writing that Bee Train has done&quot;. Professional reviewers welcomed the increased number of sympathetic characters, especially the distinguishable male ones (Friday, Carrossea, Colonel Burton), as opposed to stormtrooper-like operatives of Soldats in &quot;Noir&quot;, but the female character designs were still said to be much more detailed (to the point of fanservice in the case of Madlax) than the more generic male characters.

The high quality of the animation in &quot;Madlax&quot; was generally acknowledged. On the negative side, the episodes that involve computer use and hacking received criticism for their lack of realism. In terms of soundtrack, &quot;Madlax&quot; has not become as innovative as &quot;Noir&quot;, with critics suggesting its OST to be a blend of &quot;Noir&quot; and &quot;.hack//Sign&quot; styles. Nevertheless, the reviewers acknowledged its superiority over the majority of contemporary works. The English translation released by ADV Films was praised for preserving most of the series&#x27; original stylistic aspects and inviting veteran voice actors for the dub. Reviewers went as far as to suggest that several English voices (especially Mike Kleinhenz&#x27;s) match the characters better than the Japanese ones. Others, however, criticized the dub, e.g. Carl Kimlinger of Anime News Network in his 2009 review of the series rated the performance as &quot;wildly uneven, ranging from good ... to plain amateurish&quot;, citing &quot;delivery issues&quot; as main problem of the dub.

The initial slow pacing, especially compared to the first episodes of &quot;Noir&quot;, became a main reason why the audience often dropped watching &quot;Madlax&quot; before it could present its later story turns which eventually resulted in the moderate success of the series. Among other suggested reasons behind the mediocre popularity of the show were: the market saturation, which resulted from other anime series attempting to repeat the success of &quot;Noir&quot; since 2001; the expectable disinterest against a &quot;&quot;Noir&quot; remake&quot;, found among the fans of the first series; the over-the-top action scenes that some felt to be ridiculous; and its unconventional genre, which straddled &quot;Madlax&quot; uncomfortably between fans of mystical science fiction and those who prefer &quot;Noir&quot; strict realism.

<doc id="927932" wikidata="Q143818" url="?curid=927932" title="Peru at the 2004 Summer Olympics">
<text>Peru competed at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece, from 13 to 29 August 2004. This was the nation&#x27;s fifteenth appearance at the Olympics, except the 1952 Summer Olympics in Helsinki.

Comité Olímpico Peruano sent the nation&#x27;s smallest ever team to the Games since the 1956 Summer Olympics in Melbourne. A total of twelve athletes, seven men and five women, competed in ten different sports. Two athletes from the Peruvian team had previously competed in Sydney: butterfly swimmer Juan Pablo Valdivieso and 1984 Olympic silver medalist Francisco Boza in men&#x27;s trap shooting (who became the first Peruvian athlete to participate in seven Olympic Games, surpassing a single edition short of a historic record by fellow shooter Juan Giha). Being the oldest and most sophisticated member of the team, Boza was assigned by the committee to become the nation&#x27;s flag bearer in the opening ceremony. Peru, however, failed to win a single Olympic medal since the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona, where Giha won the silver in the mixed skeet.

==Athletics==

Peruvian athletes achieved qualifying standards in the following athletics events (up to a maximum of 3 athletes in each event at the &#x27;A&#x27; Standard, and 1 at the &#x27;B&#x27; Standard).

<doc id="927942" wikidata="Q17004012" url="?curid=927942" title="Intersex medical interventions">
<text>Intersex medical interventions (IMI), sometimes known as intersex genital mutilations (IGM), are surgical, hormonal and other medical interventions performed to modify atypical or ambiguous genitalia and other sex characteristics, primarily for the purposes of making a person&#x27;s appearance more typical and to reduce the likelihood of future problems. The history of intersex surgery has been characterized by controversy due to reports that surgery can compromise sexual function and sensation, and create lifelong health issues. The medical interventions can be for a variety of reasons, due to the enormous variety of the disorders of sex development. Some disorders, such as salt-wasting disorder, can be life-threatening if left untreated. Additionally, non-consensual surgery or stigmas surrounding intersex individuals may lead to feelings of dysmorphia and negative mental health outcomes. 

Interventions on intersex infants and children are increasingly recognized as human rights issues. Intersex organizations, and human rights institutions increasingly question the basis and necessity of such interventions. In 2011, Christiane Völling won the first successful case brought against a surgeon for non-consensual surgical intervention. In 2015, the Council of Europe recognized, for the first time, a right for intersex persons not to undergo sex-assignment treatment and Malta became the first country to prohibit involuntary or coerced modifications to sex characteristics.

==Purposes of genital reconstructive surgery==
The goals of surgery vary with the type of intersex condition but usually include one or more of the following:

Physical health rationales:
* to improve the potential for fertility
* to provide an outlet for menstruation
* to prevent or reduce urinary tract infections or obstruction
* to reduce risk of cancer in gonads with high risk levels
* to close open wounds or exposed internal organs
* to improve urinary or fecal continence.

Psychosocial rationales:
* to alleviate parental distress over the atypical genital appearance.
* to make the appearance more normal for the person&#x27;s sex of rearing
* to reduce effects of atypical genitalia on psychosexual development and gender identity
* to improve the potential for adult sexual relationships

Both sets of rationales may be the subject of debate, particularly as the consequences of surgical interventions are lifelong and irreversible. Questions regarding physical health include accurately assessing risk levels, necessity and timing. Psychosocial rationales are particularly susceptible to questions of necessity as they reflect parental, social, and cultural concerns. There remains no clinical consensus or clear evidence regarding surgical timing, necessity, type of surgical intervention, degree of difference warranting intervention and evaluation method. Such surgeries are the subject of significant contention, including community activism, and multiple reports by international human rights and health institutions and national ethics bodies.

==Types of intervention==

Interventions include:
* surgical treatment
* hormone treatment
* genetic selection and terminations
* treatment for gender dysphoria
* psychosocial support

Surgical interventions can broadly be divided into &quot;masculinizing surgical procedures&quot; intended to make genitalia more like those of typical XY-males, and &quot;feminizing surgical procedures&quot; intended to make genitalia more like those of typical XX-females. There are multiple techniques or approaches for each procedure. Some of these are needed for variations in degrees of physical difference. Techniques and procedure have evolved over the last 60 years. Some of the different techniques have been devised to reduce complications associated with earlier techniques. There remains a lack of consensus on surgeries, and some clinicians still regard them as experimental.

Some children receive a combination of procedures. For example, a child regarded as a severely undervirilized boy with a pseudovaginal perineoscrotal hypospadias may have midline urogenital closure, third degree hypospadias repair, chordee release and phalloplasty, and orchiopexy performed. A child regarded as a severely virilized girl with congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) may undergo both a partial clitoral recession and a vaginoplasty.

===Masculinizing surgical procedures===

Orchiopexy and hypospadias repair are the most common types of genital corrective surgery performed in infant boys. In a few parts of the world 5-alpha-reductase deficiency or defects of testosterone synthesis, or even rarer forms of intersex account for a significant portion of cases but these are rare in North America and Europe. Masculinizing surgery for completely virilized individuals with XX sex chromosomes and CAH is even rarer. An early procedure was performed by London surgeon Thomas Brand in 1779.

Orchiopexy for repair of undescended testes (cryptorchidism) is the second most common surgery performed on infant male genitalia (after circumcision). The surgeon moves one or both testes, with blood vessels, from an abdominal or inguinal position to the scrotum. If the inguinal canal is open it must be closed to prevent hernia. Potential surgical problems include maintaining the blood supply. If vessels cannot be stretched into the scrotum, or are separated and cannot be reconnected, a testis will die and atrophy.

Hypospadias repair may be a single-stage procedure if the hypospadias is of the first or second degree (urethral opening on glans or shaft respectively) and the penis is otherwise normal. Surgery for third-degree hypospadias (urethral opening on perineum or in urogenital opening) is more challenging, may be done in stages, and has a significant rate of complications and unsatisfactory outcomes. Potential surgical problems: For severe hypospadias (3rd degree, on perineum) constructing a urethral tube the length of the phallus is not always successful, leaving an opening (a &quot;fistula&quot;) proximal to the intended urethral opening. Sometimes a second operation is successful, but some boys and men have been left with chronic problems with fistulas, scarring and contractures that make urination or erections uncomfortable, and loss of sensation. It is increasingly recognized that long-term outcomes are poor.

Epispadias repair may involve comprehensive surgical repair of the genito-urinary area, usually during the first seven years of life, including reconstruction of the urethra, closure of the penile shaft and mobilisation of the corpora.

Urogenital closure closure of any midline opening at the base of the penis. In severe undervirilization a boy may have a &quot;pseudovaginal pouch&quot; or a single urogenital opening in the midline of the perineum. Potential surgical problems: The most complicated aspect of closure involves moving the urethra to the phallus if it is not already there (i.e., repairing a perineal hypospadias). Fistulas, scarring, and loss of sensation are the main risks.

Gonadectomy (also referred to as &quot;orchiectomy&quot;) removal of the gonads. This is done in three circumstances. (1) If the gonads are dysgenetic testes or streak gonads and at least some of the boy&#x27;s cells have a Y chromosome, the gonads or streaks must be removed because they are nonfunctional but have a relatively high risk of developing gonadoblastoma. (2) In rare instances when an XX child has completely virilizing congenital adrenal hyperplasia (Prader stage 5), the ovaries can be removed before puberty to stop breast development and/or menstruation. (3) Gonadectomy can be performed in the equally rare instance of a child with true hermaphroditism virilized enough to raise as male, in which ovaries or ovotestes can be removed. A lifetime of hormone replacement will be required, to avoid osteoporosis and enable sexual functioning.

Chordee release is the cutting of ventral penile skin and connective tissue to free and straighten the penis. A mild chordee, manifest as a well-formed penis &quot;bent&quot; downward by subcutaneous connective tissue, may be an isolated birth defect easily repaired by releasing some of the inelastic connective tissue on the ventral side of the shaft. In a complete chordee the phallus is &quot;tethered&quot; downward to the perineum by skin. A more severe chordee is often accompanied by a hypospadias and sometimes by severe undervirilization: a perineal &quot;pseudovaginal pouch&quot; and bifid (&quot;split&quot;) scrotum with an undersized penis. This combination, referred to as pseudovaginal perineoscrotal hypospadias, is in the spectrum of ambiguous genitalia due to a number of conditions. Scarring and contracture are occasional complications, but most unsatisfactory outcomes occur when a severe hypospadias needs to be repaired as well. Long-term complications can include fistulas between colon or upper rectum and skin or other cavities, or between urethra and perineum. Loss of sensation.

Cloacal repair is among the most complex of the surgeries described here. Bladder exstrophy or more severe cloacal exstrophy is a major birth defect involving inadequate closure and incomplete midline fusion of multiple pelvic and perineal organs as well as the front of the pelvis and lower abdominal wall. The penis and scrotum are often widely bifid (the two embryonic parts unjoined). The penis often cannot be salvaged, although the testes can be retained. Repair may involve closure of the bladder, closure of the anterior abdominal wall, colostomy (temporary or permanent) with reconstruction of the rectum. If the halves of the phallus cannot be joined, they may be removed. The smallest defect in this spectrum is an epispadias. Surgical repair for this is primarily a phalloplasty. Potential surgical problems: Surgery for the more severe degrees of cloacal exstrophy is extensive and usually multistage. A variety of potential problems and complications can occur, including need for long-term colostomy or vesicostomy. In many cases a functional penis cannot be created. Scarring is often extensive and the lower torso severely disfigured even with fairly good outcomes.

Phalloplasty is a general term for any reconstruction of the penis itself, especially for more unusual types of injuries, deformities, or birth defects. The principal difficulty is that erectile tissue is not easily constructed and this limits the surgeon&#x27;s ability to make more than minor size changes. Construction of a narrow tube lined with mucosa (a urethra) is a similar challenge. Minor revisions of the skin are rarely followed by problems. More complicated reconstruction may result in scarring and contracture, which can distort the shape or curvature of the penis, or interfere with erections or make them painful.

Hysterectomy is removal of a uterus. It is rare that a uterus or Müllerian duct derivatives would need to be removed from a child being raised as a boy: see persistent Müllerian duct syndrome. The most common scenario is accidental discovery of persistent Müllerian derivatives or a small uterus during abdominal surgery of a normal boy for cryptorchidism, appendectomy, or bowel disease. Removal would not involve genital surgery. A rarer indication would be that of a completely virilized XX child with congenital adrenal hyperplasia (Prader stage 5) being raised as a male; ovaries and uterus must be removed to prevent breast development and menstruation by early adolescence. Risks are simply those of abdominal surgery.

Testicular prostheses are saline-filled plastic ovoids implanted in the scrotum. They have no function except to provide the appearance and feel of testes. Several sizes are available, but most are implanted in adolescence to avoid repeated procedures to implant larger sizes at puberty. Prostheses made of silastic are no longer available due to safety and perception-of-safety concerns. Potential surgical problems: Foreign body reactions, rarely with infection or erosion of scrotal skin, are minimal but constitute the most significant complication.

Penile augmentation surgery is surgery intended to enlarge a small penis. Early attempts in the 1950s and 1960s involved constructing a tube of non-erectile flesh extending a small penis but the penis did not function. In recent years a small number of urologists have been offering an augmentation procedure that involves moving outward some of the buried components of the corpora so that the penis protrudes more. The girth is augmented with transplantation of the patient&#x27;s fat. This procedure is designed to preserve erectile and sexual function without surgically altering the urethra. This type of surgery is not performed on children and primarily produces a small increase in the size of a normal penis, but would be less likely to produce a major functional change in a severe micropenis. Potential surgical problems include reabsorption of the fat, scarring resulting in interference with erectile function, and issues with physical sensation.

Concealed penis where a normal penis is buried in suprapubic fat. In most cases, when the fat is depressed with the fingers, the penis is seen to be of normal size. This is common in overweight boys before the penile growth of puberty. Surgical techniques have been devised to improve it. The most common problems post-surgery are recurrence with continued weight gain and scarring.

===Feminizing surgical procedures===

In the last 50 years, the following procedures were most commonly performed to make the genitalia more typically female: virilization due to congenital adrenal hyperplasia; genital variations due, for example, to cloacal exstrophy; genital variations in infants with XY or mixed chromosomes to be raised as girls, such as gonadal dysgenesis, partial and complete androgen insensitivity syndrome, micropenis, cloacal and bladder exstrophy. In the 21st century, feminizing surgery to support reassignment of XY infants with non-ambiguous micropenis has been largely discontinued, and surgical reassignment of XY infants with exstrophy or other significant variations or injuries is diminishing. See history of intersex surgery.

Clitorectomy amputation or removal of most of the clitoris, including glans, erectile tissue, and nerves. This procedure was the most common clitoral surgery performed prior to 1970, but was largely abandoned by 1980 because it usually resulted in loss of clitoral sensation. Potential surgical problems: The primary effect of this surgery is a drastic reduction in ability to experience orgasm. The appearance is not very normal. Regrowth of unwanted erectile tissue has sometimes presented problems.

Clitoroplasty, like phalloplasty, is a term that encompasses any surgical reconstruction of the clitoris, such as removal of the corpora. Clitoral recession and reduction can both be referred to as clitoroplasty. Potential surgical problems: Major complications can include scarring, contractures, loss of sensation, loss of capacity for orgasm, and unsatisfactory appearance.

Clitoral recession involves the repositioning of the erectile body and glans of the clitoris farther back under the symphysis pubis and/or skin of the preputium and mons. This was commonly done from the 1970s through the 1980s to reduce protrusion without sacrificing sensation. Outcomes were often unsatisfactory, and it fell into disfavor in the last 15 years. Potential surgical problems: Unfortunately the subsequent sensations were not always pleasant, and erection could be painful. Adults who had a clitoral recession in early childhood often report reduced capacity for enjoyment of sexual intercourse, though similar women who had not had surgery also report a high rate of sexual dysfunction.

Clitoral reduction was developed in the 1980s to reduce size without reducing function. Lateral wedges of the erectile tissue of the clitoris are removed to reduce the size and protrusion. The neurovascular tissue is carefully spared to preserve function and sensation. Nerve stimulation and sensory responses are now often performed during the surgery to confirm function of the sensory nerves. Clitoral reduction is rarely done except in combination with vaginoplasty when substantial virilization is present. Potential problems: The degree to which the goal of preserving sexual sensations is attained is a subject of controversy regarding the necessity of such treatments, and lack of firm evidence of good outcomes. The success of more contemporary approaches was challenged by Thomas in 2004: &quot;confidence in the superiority of modern surgery is almost certainly misplaced as the crucial components of current clitoral reduction surgery are not fundamentally different from those used in specialist centres 20 years ago&quot;.

Vaginoplasty, the construction or reconstruction of a vagina, can be fairly simple or quite complex, depending on the initial anatomy. If a normal internal uterus, cervix and upper vagina (the Müllerian derivatives) exist, and the outer virilization is modest, surgery involves separating the fused labia and widening the vaginal introitus. With greater degrees of virilization, the major challenge of the procedure is to provide a passage connecting the outer vaginal opening to the cervix which will stay wide enough to allow coitus. XY girls or women with partial androgen insensitivity syndrome will have a blind vaginal pouch of varying degrees of depth. Sometimes this can be dilated to a usable depth. Sometimes surgery is performed to deepen it.

The most challenging surgery with the highest complication rate is construction of an entirely new vagina (a &quot;neovagina&quot;). The most common instance of this is when a child will be assigned and raised as a female despite complete virilization, as with Prader 5 CAH, or (in the past) when a genetic male infant with a severely defective penis was reassigned as a female. One method is to use a segment of colon, which provides a lubricated mucosal surface as a substitute for the vaginal mucosa. Another is to line the new vagina with a skin graft. Potential surgical problems: Stenosis (narrowing) of the constructed vagina is the most common long-term complication and the chief reason that a revision may be required when a girl is older. When a neovagina is made from a segment of bowel, it tends to leak mucus; when made with a skin graft, lubrication is necessary. Less common complications include fistulas, uncomfortable scarring, and problems with urinary continence.

Gonadectomy is removal of the gonads. If the gonads are dysgenetic testes or streak gonads and at least some of the cells have a Y chromosome, the gonads or streaks must be removed because they are nonfunctional but have a relatively high risk of developing gonadoblastoma. If the gonads are relatively &quot;normal&quot; testes, but the child is to be assigned and raised as female, (e.g., for intersex conditions with severe undervirilization, or major malformations involving an absent or unsalvageable penis) they must be removed before puberty to prevent virilization from rising testosterone.

Testes in androgen insensitivity are a special case: if there is any degree of responsiveness to testosterone, they should be removed before puberty. On the other hand, if androgen insensitivity is complete, the testes may be left to produce estradiol (via testosterone) to induce breast development, but there is a slowly increasing risk of cancer in adult life. Streak gonads without a Y chromosome cell line need not be removed but will not function. Finally, the gonads in true hermaphroditism must be directly examined; atypical gonads with Y line or potential testicular function should be removed but in rare instances a surgeon may try to preserve the ovarian part of an ovotestis. Potential surgical problems: A lifetime of hormone replacement will be required, to avoid osteoporosis and enable sexual functioning.

Cloacal exstrophy and bladder exstrophy repair is needed regardless of the sex of assignment or rearing. Simple bladder exstrophy in a genetic female does not usually involve the vagina. Cloacal exstrophy in a genetic female usually requires major surgical reconstruction of the entire perineum, including bladder, clitoris, symphysis pubis, and both the vaginal introitus and urethra. However, the uterus and ovaries are normally formed. Severe bladder exstrophy or cloacal exstrophy in genetic males often renders the phallus widely split, small, and unsalvageable. The scrotum is also widely split, though testes themselves are usually normal. From the 1960s until the 1990s, many of these infants were assigned and raised as females, with fashioning of a vagina and gonadectomy as part of the perineal reconstruction.

Potential surgical problems: Surgery for the more severe degrees of cloacal exstrophy is extensive and usually multistage. A variety of potential problems and complications can occur, including need for long-term colostomy or vesicostomy. Creating a functional urethra is difficult and poor healing, with scarring, stricture, or fistula can require a vesicostomy to prevent urinary incontinence. Construction of a functional internal and external anal sphincter can be equally difficult when this has been disrupted as well. Functional problems can warrant a temporary or long-term colostomy. The added challenge for the most severely affected genetic females, and for genetic males who are being raised as females, is construction of a neovagina. Scarring is extensive and the lower torso disfigured even with the best outcomes. Finally, it has become apparent that some XY males (without intersex conditions) who are reassigned and raised as females have not developed a female gender identity and have sought reassignment back to male.

===Hormone treatment===

There is widespread evidence of prenatal testing and hormone treatment to prevent intersex traits. In 1990, a paper by Heino Meyer-Bahlburg titled &quot;Will Prenatal Hormone Treatment Prevent Homosexuality?&quot; was published in the Journal of Child and Adolescent Psychopharmacology. It examined the use of &quot;prenatal hormone screening or treatment for the prevention of homosexuality&quot; using research conducted on fetuses with congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH). Dreger, Feder, and Tamar-Mattis describe how later research constructs &quot;low interest in babies and men – and even interest in what they consider to be men&#x27;s occupations and games – as &quot;abnormal&quot;, and potentially preventable with prenatal dex [amethasone]&quot;.

===Genetic selection and terminations===

The ethics of preimplantation genetic diagnosis to select against intersex traits was the subject of 11 papers in the October 2013 issue of the &quot;American Journal of Bioethics&quot;. There is widespread evidence of pregnancy terminations arising from prenatal testing, as well prenatal hormone treatment to prevent intersex traits.

In April 2014, Organisation Intersex International Australia made a submission on genetic selection via preimplantation genetic diagnosis to the National Health and Medical Research Council recommending that deselection of embryos and fetuses on grounds of intersex status should not be permitted. It quoted research by Professors Morgan Holmes, Jeff Nisker, associate professor Georgiann Davis, and by Jason Behrmann and Vardit Ravitsky. It quotes research showing pregnancy termination rates of up to 88% in 47,XXY even while the World Health Organization describes the trait as &quot;compatible with normal life expectancy&quot;, and &quot;often undiagnosed&quot;. Behrmann and Ravitsky find social concepts of sex, gender and sexual orientation to be &quot;intertwined on many levels. Parental choice against intersex may thus conceal biases against same-sex attractedness and gender nonconformity.&quot;

===Gender dysphoria===

The DSM-5 included a change from using gender identity disorder to gender dysphoria. This revised code now specifically includes intersex people who do not identify with their sex assigned at birth and experience clinically significant distress or impairment, using the language of disorders of sex development. This move was criticized by intersex advocacy groups in Australia and New Zealand.

Additionally, when intersex individuals receive non-consensual surgery at birth, this can lead to life-long trauma and feelings of gender dysphoria. This is because intersex surgery is non-accepting towards intersex individual because it forces them to conform to a binary. There are changing practices surrounding intersex surgery of infants with more hospitals or medical professionals discouraging intersex surgery when the child cannot make the decision themselves. However, there have not been any federal or local policies surrounding non-consensual intersex surgery on infants or children. 

===Psychosocial support===

A 2006 clinician &quot;Consensus Statement on Intersex Disorders and Their Management&quot; attempted to prioritise psychosocial support for children and families, but it also supports surgical intervention with psychosocial rationales such as &quot;minimizing family concern and distress&quot; and &quot;mitigating the risks of stigmatization and gender-identity confusion&quot;.

In 2012, the Swiss National Advisory Commission on Biomedical Ethics argued strongly in favour of improved psychosocial support, saying:

A joint international statement by intersex community organizations published in 2013 sought, amongst other demands:

==Outcomes and evidence==

Specialists at the Intersex Clinic at University College London began to publish evidence in 2001 that indicated the harm that can arise as a result of inappropriate interventions, and advised minimising the use of childhood surgical procedures.

A 2004 paper by Heino Meyer-Bahlburg and others examined outcomes from early surgeries in individuals with XY variations, at one patient centre. The study has been used to support claims that &quot;the majority of women... have clearly favored genital surgery at an earlier age&quot; but the study was criticized by Baratz and Feder in a 2015 paper for neglecting to inform respondents that:
===Chicago consensus statement===

In 2006, an invited group of clinicians met in Chicago and reviewed clinical evidence and protocols, and adopted a new term for intersex conditions: &quot;Disorders of sex development&quot; (DSD) in the journal article &quot;Consensus Statement on Intersex Disorders and their Management&quot;. The new term refers to &quot;congenital conditions in which development of chromosomal, gonadal, or anatomical sex is atypical.&quot; The term has been controversial and not widely adopted outside clinical settings: the World Health Organization and many medical journals still refer to intersex traits or conditions. Academics like Georgiann Davis and Morgan Holmes, and clinical psychologists like Tiger Devore argue that the term DSD was designed to &quot;reinstitutionalise&quot; medical authority over intersex bodies. On surgical rationales and outcomes, the article stated that:
===Changing practices===

Data presented in recent years suggests that little has changed in practice. Creighton and others in the UK have found that there have been few audits of the implementation of the 2006 statement, clitoral surgeries on under-14s have increased since 2006, and &quot;recent publications in the medical literature tend to focus on surgical techniques with no reports on patient experiences&quot;.

===Patient outcomes===

A 2014 civil society submission to the World Health Organization cited data from a large German &quot;Netzwerk DSD/Intersexualität&quot; study:
A 2016 Australian study of persons born with atypical sex characteristics found that &quot;strong evidence suggesting a pattern of institutionalised shaming and coercive treatment of people&quot;. Large majorities of respondents opposed standard clinical protocols.

===2016 Global DSD Update===

A 2016 follow-up to the 2006 Consensus Statement, termed a &quot;Global Disorders of Sex Development Update&quot; stated,
A 2016 paper on &quot;Surgery in disorders of sex development (DSD) with a gender issue&quot; repeated many of the same claims, but without reference to human rights norms. A commentary to that article by Alice Dreger and Ellen Feder criticized that omission, stating that issues have barely changed in two decades, with &quot;lack of novel developments&quot;, while &quot;lack of evidence appears not to have had much impact on physicians&#x27; confidence in a standard of care that has remained largely unchanged.&quot; Another 2016 commentary stated that the purpose of the 2006 Consensus Statement was to validate existing practices, &quot;The authoritativeness and &quot;consensus&quot; in the Chicago statement lies not in comprehensive clinician input or meaningful community input, but in its utility to justify any and all forms of clinical intervention.&quot;

==Controversies and unsettled questions==
Management practices for intersex conditions have evolved over the last 60 years. In recent decades surgical practices have become the subject of public and professional controversy, and evidence remains lacking.

===Comparing early against late surgeries===

Argued or putative advantages of infant surgery:
* Tissue is more elastic and heals better according to many surgeons.
* Genital surgery performed before the age of memory is less emotionally traumatic.
* Surgery in infancy avoids asking adolescent to make a decision that is stressful and difficult even for adults.
* Assuming infant surgery is successful, there is no barrier to engaging in normal sexual activities, and less distortion of psychosexual identity.

Argued or putative advantages of surgery in adolescence or later:
* If outcome is less than satisfactory, early surgery leaves a person wondering if they would have been better off without it.
* Any surgery not absolutely necessary for physical health should be postponed until the person is old enough to give informed consent.
* Genital surgery should be handled differently than other birth defect surgery; this is a type of surgery that parents should not be empowered to make decisions about because they will be under social pressure to make &quot;bad&quot; decisions.
* By mid-adolescence or later, persons may decide that their atypical genitalia do not need to be changed.
* Infant vaginoplasties should not be done because most people who have had them performed report some degree of difficulty with sexual function; even though we have no evidence that adult sexual function will be better if surgery is deferred, the outcomes could not be worse than they currently are after infant surgery.

Others argue that the key questions are not ones of early or late surgery, but questions of consent and autonomy.

===Parental consent===

Parents are frequently considered able to consent to feminizing or masculinizing interventions on their child, and this may be considered standard for the treatment of physical disorders. However this is contested, particularly where interventions seek to address psychosocial concerns. A &quot;BMJ&quot; editorial in 2015 stated that parents are unduly influenced by medicalized information, may not realize that they are consenting to experimental treatments, and regret may be high. Research has suggested that parents are willing to consent to appearance-altering surgeries even at the cost of later adult sexual sensation. Child rights expert Kirsten Sandberg states that parents have no right to consent to such treatments.

===Sensation and sexual function===

Reports published in the early 1990s state that 20-50% of surgical cases result in a loss of sexual sensation.

A 2007 paper by Yang, Felsen and Poppas provided what the authors believe is the first study of clitoral sensitivity after clitoris reduction surgery, but the research was itself the subject of ethical debate. Postoperative patients aged older than five years were &quot;considered candidates&quot; for clitoral sensitivity testing, and 10 of 51 patients were tested, with 9 undergoing extended vibratory sensory testing. The initial tests were performed on the inner thigh, labia majora, labia minora, vaginal introitus and clitoris, with a &quot;cotton tip applicator&quot; and extended tests with a biothesiometer, a medical device used to measure sensitivity thresholds. Values were recorded. The authors note that there are no control data &quot;for assessment of the viability and function of the clitoris in unaffected women.&quot; The ethics of these tests have been criticized by bioethicists, and subsequently defended by the Office for Human Research Protections.

Loss of sexual function and sensation remains a concern in a submission by the Australasian Paediatric Endocrine Group to the Australian Senate in 2013. Clinical decision-making has prioritized perceived advantages from infant clitoral reduction surgery over the potential disadvantages of reduced or distorted sexual sensation. Human rights institutions stress the informed consent of the individual concerned.

===Decision-making on cancer and other physical risks===
In the cases where nonfunctional testes are present, or with partial androgen insensitivity syndrome, there is a risk that these develop cancer. They are removed by orchidectomy or monitored carefully. In a major Parliamentary report in Australia, published in October 2013, the Senate Community Affairs References committee was &quot;disturbed&quot; by the possible implications of current practices in the treatment of cancer risk. The committee stated: &quot;clinical intervention pathways stated to be based on probabilities of cancer risk may be encapsulating treatment decisions based on other factors, such as the desire to conduct normalising surgery… Treating cancer may be regarded as unambiguously therapeutic treatment, while normalising surgery may not. Thus basing a decision on cancer risk might avoid the need for court oversight in a way that a decision based on other factors might not. The committee is disturbed by the possible implications of this...&quot;

===Gender identity issues===

Gender identity and sexuality in intersex children have been problematized, and subjective judgements are made about the acceptability of risk of future gender dysphoria. Medical professionals have traditionally considered the worst outcomes after genital reconstruction in infancy to occur when the person develops a gender identity discordant with the sex assigned as an infant. Most of the cases in which a child or adult has voluntarily changed sex and rejected sex of assignment and rearing have occurred in partially or completely virilized genetic males who were reassigned and raised as females. This is the management practice that has been most thoroughly undermined in recent decades, as a result of a small number of spontaneous self-reassignments to male. Reducing the likelihood of a gender &quot;mismatch&quot; is also a claimed advantage of deferring reconstructive surgery until the patient is old enough to assess gender identity with confidence.

Human rights institutions question such approaches as being &quot;informed by redundant social constructs around gender and biology&quot;.

===Stigma and normality===

Parents may be advised that without surgery, their child will be stigmatized, but they may make different choices with non-medicalized information. However, there is no evidence that surgeries help children grow up psychologically healthy.

Unlike other aesthetic surgical procedures performed on infants, such as corrective surgery for a cleft lip (as opposed to a cleft palate), genital surgery may lead to negative consequences for sexual functioning in later life (such as loss of sensation in the genitals, for example, when a clitoris deemed too large or penis is reduced/removed), or feelings of freakishness and unacceptability, which may have been avoided without the surgery. Studies have revealed how surgical intervention has had psychological effects, affecting well-being and quality of life. Genital surgeries do not ensure a successful psychological outcome for the patient and might require psychological support when the patient is trying to distinguish a gender identity. The Swiss National Advisory Commission on Biomedical Ethics states that, where &quot;interventions are performed solely with a view to integration of the child into a family and social environment, then they run counter to the child&#x27;s welfare. In addition, there is no guarantee that the intended purpose (integration) will be achieved.&quot;

Opponents of all &quot;corrective surgery&quot; on atypical sex characteristics suggest to change social opinion regarding the desirability of having genitalia that look more average, rather than perform surgery to try to make them more like those of other people.

=== Suicide Risks and Well-Being of Intersex Individuals ===
Intersex individuals often do not receive support from their parents or family members. They may experience harm through their families such as being forced to conform to gender expectations, be forced or even without their consent be given treatments or medical interventions, or be completely shut-off from their family if they do not conform to what is expected. When examining suicide within the LGBTI community, it was found that there was limited studies conducted for the intersex community on reasons for committing suicide because researchers studied LGB communities far more frequently. It can be understood that intersex individuals have higher rates of suicide compared to the general population. In a national study conducted in the United States, it was found that &quot;43% of [intersex adults] rated their physical health as fair or poor in comparison to 17.7% of the general U.S population.&quot; 

===Medical photography and display===

Photographs of intersex children&#x27;s genitalia are circulated in medical communities for documentary purposes, and individuals with intersex traits may be subjected to repeated genital examinations and display to medical teams. Problems associated with experiences of medical photography of intersex children have been discussed along with their ethics, control and usage. &quot;The experience of being photographed has exemplified for many people with intersex conditions the powerlessness and humiliation felt during medical investigations and interventions&quot;.

===Secrecy and information provision===

Additionally, parents are not often consulted on the decision-making process when choosing the sex of the child, and they may be advised to conceal information from their child. The Intersex Society of North America stated that &quot;For decades, doctors have thought it necessary to treat intersex with a concealment-centered approach, one that features downplaying intersex as much as possible, even to the point of lying to patients about their conditions.&quot;

===Alternative pathways===

In 2015, an editorial in the &quot;BMJ&quot; described current surgical interventions as experimental, stating that clinical confidence in constructing &quot;normal&quot; genital anatomies has not been borne out, and that medically credible pathways other than surgery do not yet exist.

== Human rights issues ==

The Council of Europe highlights several areas of concern in relation to intersex surgeries and other medical treatment:
* unnecessary &quot;normalising&quot; treatment of intersex persons, and unnecessary pathologisation of variations in sex characteristics.
* access to justice and reparation for unnecessary medical treatment, as well as inclusion in equal treatment and hate crime law.
* access to information, medical records, peer and other counselling and support.
* respecting self-determination in gender recognition, through expeditious access to official documents.

The Council of Europe argues that secrecy and shame have perpetuated human rights abuses and a lack of social understanding of the reality of intersex people. It calls for respect for &quot;intersex persons&#x27; right not to undergo sex assignment treatment&quot;.

Alice Dreger, a US professor of Clinical Medical Humanities and Bioethics, argues that little has changed in actual clinical practice in recent years. Creighton and others in the UK have found that there have been few audits of the implementation of the 2006 statement, clitoral surgeries on under-14s have increased since 2006, and &quot;recent publications in the medical literature tend to focus on surgical techniques with no reports on patient experiences&quot;.

Institutions like the Swiss National Advisory Commission on Biomedical Ethics, the Australian Senate, the Council of Europe, World Health Organization, and UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights and Special Rapporteur on Torture have all published reports calling for changes to clinical practice.

In 2011, Christiane Völling won the first successful case brought against a surgeon for non-consensual surgical intervention. The Regional Court of Cologne, Germany, awarded her €100,000.

In April 2015, Malta became the first country to recognize a right to bodily integrity and physical autonomy, and outlaw non-consensual modifications to sex characteristics. The Act was widely welcomed by civil society organizations.

In June 2017, Joycelyn Elders, David Satcher, and Richard Carmona, three former Surgeons General of the United States published a paper at the Palm Center, calling for a rethink of early genital surgeries on children with intersex traits. The statement reflected on the history of such interventions, their rationales and outcomes, stating:

<doc id="927943" wikidata="Q2916310" url="?curid=927943" title="Sir George Yonge, 5th Baronet">
<text>Sir George Yonge, 5th Baronet, KCB, PC, FRS (; 17 July 1731 – 25 September 1812), of Escot House in the parish of Talaton in Devon, England, was a British Secretary at War (1782–1783 and 1783–1794). He succeeded to his father&#x27;s baronetcy in 1755, which became extinct when he died without children. He is remembered by, among other things, the name of Yonge Street, a principal road in what is now Toronto, Canada, so named in 1793 by the Lieutenant-Governor of Upper Canada, John Graves Simcoe.

==Life and career==
Yonge was born in 1731 at Great House in the parish of Colyton, Devon, the son and heir of Sir William Yonge, 4th Baronet by his second wife Ann Howard. He had a stepbrother, Walter Yonge, from his father&#x27;s first wife Mary Heathcote.

He was educated at Eton College and then at the University of Leipzig. 
He served as a Member of Parliament for his family&#x27;s Rotten Borough of Honiton, Devon, from 1754 to 1761 and again from 1763 to 1796. He was quoted to have often said that he had inherited £80,000 from his father, acquired another £80,000 when he married and £80,000 from Parliament but Honiton had &quot;swallowed it all,&quot; This was due to the huge briberies which were commonplace to influence the electorate in rotten borough elections of the time. Yonge was appointed to the Privy Council of the United Kingdom in 1782, and acted as Governor of the Cape Colony for a short period from 1799 to 1801. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1784 and was invested as a Knight of the Bath in 1788.

In 1755, he inherited Escot House near Ottery St Mary, Devon, on the death of his father. In 1794, he sold it for £26,000 to Sir John Kennaway, 1st Baronet, under whose occupancy it burnt down in 1808.

When Yonge died, indebted, on 25 September 1812 at Hampton Court, the baronetcy died with him. Initially he was interred at the place of his death but his remains were later exhumed and transported by sea to be laid to rest in the family crypt in the parish of Colyton. The re-burial was reputed to have taken place by night in fear that his creditors may seize the body.

==Family==
Yonge married Ann Cleeve, daughter and sole heir of Bourchier Cleeve, on 10 July 1765. Yonge was then 34 years old and Ann 20 or perhaps just 21. Ann&#x27;s father, two days before his death, changed his will to place restrictions on Ann&#x27;s inheritance should she marry someone whom her mother deemed inappropriate. Whether this occurred is not clear.

Ann had no children. She died at Hampton on 7 January 1833.

==Legacy==
Yonge was considered an expert on Roman roads: &#x27;He was a man of letters, an F.R.S., and a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries, to which he communicated an excellent memoir on the subject of Roman roads and camps, in connection with some discoveries that had been made at Mansfield, in Nottinghamshire, and hence the peculiar fitness of naming Yonge Street after him, it being precisely such a road, and adapted to similar uses, as those he had been engaged in examining.

Yonge Street, the main north–south street of Toronto, was built between 1795 and 1796 from Eglinton Avenue to Lake Simcoe. Later the road was extended south to Bloor Street and still later, south to Lake Ontario. Yonge Mills Road and Townline Road Escott Yonge in Front of Yonge Township in Mallorytown, Ontario are named for him as well.

<doc id="927946" wikidata="Q2626334" url="?curid=927946" title="Peter Alliss">
<text>Peter Alliss (28 February 1931 – 5 December 2020) was an English professional golfer, television presenter, commentator, author and golf course designer. Following the death of Henry Longhurst in 1978, he was regarded by many as the &quot;Voice of golf&quot;. In 2012 he was inducted into the World Golf Hall of Fame in the Lifetime Achievement category.

Between 1952 and 1969, Alliss won 20 professional tournaments, including three British PGA Championships, in 1957, 1962 and 1965. He had five top-10 finishes in the Open Championship, coming closest in 1954 at Royal Birkdale when he finished four shots behind the champion Peter Thomson.

Alliss played on eight Ryder Cup teams between 1953 and 1969 with a record of 10 wins, 15 losses and 5 halved matches. He played on Great Britain&#x27;s victorious 1957 Ryder Cup Team. Peter and his father Percy were the first father and son to both participate in and both win the Ryder Cup. Alliss also represented England in the World Cup on 10 occasions.

==Early life==
Alliss&#x27;s father Percy was one of the leading British professional golfers in the 1920s and 1930s, winning many tournaments in Britain and Continental Europe. Peter Alliss was born in Berlin while his father was employed as a club professional at the Wannsee Golf Club. He weighed at birth, reputed to be a European record at the time. Peter had an older brother, Percy Alexander, known as Alec. Alec was born in 1924 and was also a professional golfer.

Percy returned from Germany in early 1932, when Peter was about a year old. Peter attended a private boarding school in the south of England which he left at the age of 14, the minimum school leaving age.

==Professional career==
In 1946, Alliss played golf for England boys against Scotland, winning both his foursomes and singles matches. In the subsequent Boys Amateur Championship, Alliss was the favourite but lost in the quarter-finals to Donald Dunstan from Manchester at the 19th hole.

Alliss turned professional in 1947, at the age of 16, as an assistant to his father at Ferndown Golf Club in Dorset. Peter and Percy travelled to the Royal Liverpool Golf Club in Hoylake to play in the 1947 Open Championship. Peter scored 86 in his first qualifying round on the Championship course and failed to qualify. Percy also struggled on the Hoylake course and failed to qualify by a stroke after rounds of 74 and 82.

In 1948, Alliss impressed in the Coombe Hill Assistants&#x27; Tournament but came to more prominence in the Manchester Evening Chronicle Tournament where his 69 was the only score under 70 on the final day. He finished tied for 9th and won the assistants&#x27; prize. He also won the assistant&#x27;s prize in the West of England Championship. The PGA Assistants&#x27; Championship was restarted in 1949 and Alliss finished tied for 2nd place, five strokes behind Harry Weetman, 10 years his senior.

From June 1949 to June 1951, Alliss served two years&#x27; National Service in the RAF. This limited his golfing activities although he did play in a few tournaments during this period.

In 1952, Alliss finished tied for 5th place in the Coombe Hill Assistants&#x27; Tournament, qualifying him for the Gor-Ray Cup, the Assistants&#x27; Championship, from 20 to 22 May. He won three of his four matches comfortably but only beat John Vamplew at the 21st hole in the quarter-finals. In the 36-hole final he beat Tony Harman 5&amp;4.

Alliss had a slow start to the 1953 season but had a good July, finishing tied for 9th in the Open Championship and third in the Irish Open. In mid-August, Alliss was included in a group of 17 from which the Ryder Cup team would be chosen. The PGA arranged a series of trial matches at Wentworth starting on 23 September, and Alliss performed well enough that he was included in the team which was announced on 26 September. Alliss was just 22 years old, the second youngest British Ryder Cup player at that time, a few months older than Henry Cotton in 1929. Alliss was paired with Harry Weetman in the opening day foursomes but lost 2&amp;1. Late on the final day, all matches had been completed except for the two singles matches involving Alliss against Jim Turnesa and 23-year-old Bernard Hunt against Dave Douglas. The British team needed 1½ points from these two matches to win the Ryder Cup or a point to tie. Alliss had gone 1 up at the 14th but he 3-putted the 15th while Turnesa got down in two from a bunker. Alliss then went out of bounds at the 17th to give Turnesa the lead. Turnesa was in the trees at the last and still short of the green in 3. However, Alliss, just off the green in 2, fluffed his chip, and eventually halved the hole in 6, to guarantee that the USA would retain the Ryder Cup. In the final match, at the 18th, Bernard Hunt missed a 4-foot putt that he needed to hole to win his match and so the USA won 6½ to 5½.

Alliss&#x27;s first major success came in the 1954 Daks Tournament at Little Aston Golf Club. On the final day he was drawn with Bernard Hunt in the first pair out. Alliss scored 70 in the morning round and 67 in the afternoon. Bobby Locke, the eventual runner-up, was able to see Alliss finishing his final round before he started his own. Three hours after Alliss had finished, Locke need a 4 at the last to tie with Alliss. However, he put his second into a bunker at the front of the green and took 5. Alliss and Hunt had taken 4 hours and 10 minutes for their two rounds of the 6,681 yards course. Alliss said: &quot;We took all the time we wanted to play our shots, but we walked smartly between the strokes.&quot; Two weeks later, in the 1954 Open Championship, Alliss improved on his 1953 performance, finishing tied for 8th place. The season ended with Alliss playing for the British Isles against the Rest of Europe in the inaugural Joy Cup.

In early 1955, Alliss travelled to the USA and played in a number of events there. On his return he missed the cut in the Spalding Tournament but then won the 5-round Dunlop Tournament at Wentworth. After this win Alliss had a disappointing season and although he finished tied for 5th in the Dunlop Masters, he was not chosen for the Ryder Cup team. Alliss had not been in the top 7 in the Order of Merit after the Open Championship and was relying on being one of the three selections after the Dunlop Masters. 1956 was a relatively disappointing year, although the year ended on a high note when he won the Spanish Open by 6 strokes at the new course at Real Club de Golf El Prat.

1957 started with Alliss moving from Ferndown to nearby Parkstone Golf Club, where he was appointed full professional, following the death of Reg Whitcombe. The year was much more successful than 1956. In early April he won the PGA Close Championship in Llandudno by 3 strokes. Later in the month, he finished second in the Spalding Tournament and in May he was tied for second in the Swallow-Penfold Tournament. He was third in the Yorkshire Evening News Tournament in June and tied for 12th in the 1957 Open Championship. Qualification rules for the 1957 Ryder Cup had been changed and covered the whole of the 1956 season, ending with the 1957 Open. After his disappointing 1956 Alliss started 1957 in 18th place but his good season lifted him to 5th, earning him a place in the team. His good form continued with a joint-second in the French Open and another second place in the Dunlop Masters. Alliss finished second in the Order of Merit with a stroke average of 71.21, behind Eric Brown on 70.99. The Ryder Cup ended in a rare victory for the British team, although Alliss lost both his matches and was the only British player to lose his singles.

In October 1958, Alliss won the Italian, Spanish and Portuguese Opens in three successive weeks.

His first round of 63 in the 1961 British PGA Championship was a tournament record at the time and remained the joint-lowest round in the tournament until Robert Karlsson&#x27;s round of 62 in 2010.

Alliss&#x27;s competitive career was almost over by the time the European Tour was formally established in 1972, but he played in some events in the Tour&#x27;s early years, making his last appearance on the tour in 1974.

=== Broadcasting career ===
His first television work was for the BBC at the 1961 Open Championship, when he was still a golfer who had competed in the tournament. After his retirement as a player, Alliss worked full-time in television, becoming the lead BBC golf commentator in 1978.

Alliss gave Sean Connery golf lessons before the filming of the 1964 James Bond film &quot;Goldfinger&quot;, which involved a scene where Connery, as Bond, played golf against gold magnate Auric Goldfinger at Stoke Park Golf Club in Buckinghamshire. The lessons started a lifelong love of playing golf for Connery.

Alliss also worked for ESPN and ABC Sports in the United States from 1975 through 2010. He continued to appear as a guest analyst on ESPN&#x27;s coverage of the Open Championship from 2011 to 2015.

As well as being a commentator for the BBC, Alliss also worked part-time for the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, and the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. He was widely regarded as the best known golf broadcaster in Britain. He hosted a total of 140 &quot;Pro Celebrity Golf&quot; TV programmes.

Between 1979 and 1986 Alliss hosted 7 series of &quot;Around with Alliss&quot;, initially broadcast on BBC2. Each series consisted of 6 programmes in which Alliss played a few holes of golf and chatted with a variety of famous people on a number of courses in the UK. 
In 1997 the format was revived for a six-part television series called &quot;A Golfer&#x27;s Travels&quot;. This series featured Alliss in a variety of locations around the world.

Alliss was also involved in golf course architecture. His first course design partner was Dave Thomas, with whom he created over 50 courses, including The Belfry, which has staged the Ryder Cup several times and is now the home of the Professional Golfers&#x27; Association. Alliss then joined forces with Clive Clark, and added another 22 courses to his portfolio (including Old Thorns Golf Course in Hampshire). He was the Club President at Old Thorns Golf Club in Hampshire and also at Castlemartyr Links Golf Club in Cork, Ireland.

Alliss became captain of the Professional Golfers&#x27; Association for the second time in 1987. He was also the president of the British Greenkeepers&#x27; Association, and was the first president of the European Women&#x27;s Professional Golfers&#x27; Association.

In 2002, Alliss was awarded the honorary degree of Doctor of Letters by Bournemouth University. In 2003, Alliss published an illustrated book, &quot;Peter Alliss&#x27;s Golf Heroes&quot;, which won the &#x27;Best Illustrated Book&#x27; category of the British Sports Book Awards. In July 2005, he was honoured by the University of St Andrews, shortly before The Open Golf Championship, with the honorary degree of Doctor of Laws.

In 2012, Alliss was chosen to receive the Golf Foundation&#x27;s &#x27;Spirit of Golf award&#x27; not only in recognition of the way he had made the sport entertaining in the eyes of young people, but also for the support he had given to junior golf and his commitment to the Golf Foundation over many years.

Alliss revealed that in 1993 he turned down an appointment as Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) for services to golf.

In 2014, Alliss helped to create and provide commentary on the video flyovers of all five course layouts of a favourite classic links course at Seaton Carew Golf Club in North East England, and commented during these programmes that the Seaton links were &quot;the tenth oldest in England and a true championship links to challenge all levels of players.&quot;

Alliss was a patron of the Wildlife Ark Trust, which is committed to the conservation in the UK of the red squirrel and the water vole.

===Criticism of players===
In 1999, Alliss received criticism from sections of the British media for scathing comments he made when Jean van de Velde folded in the Open Championship at Carnoustie. The Frenchman had a triple-bogey seven on the final hole when he only needed a double-bogey six to win the Open. During his commentary, Alliss branded Jean van de Velde&#x27;s actions as &quot;totally ridiculous&quot; and said he was guilty of &quot;pure madness&quot;. Some critics accused Alliss of being &quot;curmudgeonly&quot;, to which he responded that &quot;...it certainly wasn&#x27;t my intention&quot;.

Alliss is reported to have previously had a frosty relationship with Nick Faldo, after Faldo was infuriated at Alliss describing him as &quot;a typical only child&quot;. However, Alliss and Faldo later went on to work together at ABC Sports from 2004 to 2007, and again as part of the BBC&#x27;s broadcast commentary team for the 2012 Open Championship.

In May 2008, Alliss was involved in a heated exchange of views with English golfer Nick Dougherty over the course conditions at Wentworth Club during the BMW PGA Championship. After Alliss had spoken out in his commentary against the poor scoring from players and their complaints over the condition of the Wentworth greens, Dougherty accused Alliss of &quot;disgusting commentary&quot; and of being &quot;out of touch&quot;. Dougherty said: &quot;I wish we could have taken him out there and shown him how difficult it was.&quot; Alliss responded by accusing Dougherty and his generation of being &quot;delicate&quot;, &quot;thin-skinned&quot;, and unable to take constructive criticism.

In a 2011 interview, Alliss criticised Tiger Woods, saying: &quot;The aura has gone. He used to be nicer and he became grumpy. He hasn&#x27;t done anything to recapture the public&#x27;s affection.&quot; Alliss said that he doesn&#x27;t believe that Woods will surpass Jack Nicklaus&#x27;s record of 18 major championships. A year earlier, in 2010, Alliss said of Woods: &quot;I think his father has a lot to do with how Tiger is. His father was a frightening bully.&quot;

During the 2013 Open Championship at Muirfield, Alliss criticised Ian Poulter for making what he said were &quot;childish comments&quot; after his opening round of 72 in the tournament. Poulter said some of the pin positions were a &quot;joke&quot; and the 18th needed a &quot;windmill and a clown face&quot;, like a crazy golf course. Alliss responded by saying: &quot;Poulter&#x27;s remarks are just childish. You can&#x27;t say stuff about windmills and clown&#x27;s faces. It&#x27;s just ridiculous. I never heard Jack Nicklaus or Arnold Palmer come out with comments like that. A lot of others give up before they even get going. It&#x27;s a PhD not an O-level.&quot;

==Personal life==
Alliss was first married in 1953 to Joan McGuinness. They had two children, Gary (born 1954) and Carol (born 1960). In 1972, Alliss married his second wife, Jackie. With Jackie, Alliss had two daughters, Sara and Victoria and two sons, Simon and Henry. Victoria was born severely disabled and died at the age of 11. Gary is a professional golfer and teacher and was captain of the Great Britain and Ireland PGA Cup team in 2007 and 2009.

For over 30 years Alliss lived in the village of Hindhead in Surrey, in a large house set in five acres of land. In 2010, at the age of 79, Alliss said that he was still able to shoot a golf score under his age (fewer shots than 79).

==Death==
Alliss died on 5 December 2020, aged 89 at his home in Surrey, England. His death was described as &quot;unexpected but peaceful&quot;. Barbara Slater, director of BBC Sport, said: &quot;Peter was the voice of golf. He transcended the sport as one of its greatest broadcasters of his generation.&quot;

<doc id="927949" wikidata="Q1334525" url="?curid=927949" title="Em (typography)">
<text>An em (from &quot;em quadrat&quot;) is a unit in the field of typography, equal to the currently specified point size. For example, one em in a 16-point typeface is 16 points. Therefore, this unit is the same for all typefaces at a given point size.

The em space is one &quot;em&quot; wide.

Typographic measurements using this unit are frequently expressed in decimal notation (e.g., 0.7 em) or as fractions of 100 or 1000 (e.g.,  em or  em). The number of pixels per em varies depending on system.

== History ==
In metal type, the point size (and hence the &quot;em&quot;, from &quot;em quadrat&quot;) was equal to the line height of the metal body from which the letter rises. In metal type, the physical size of a letter could not normally exceed the em.

A digital font&#x27;s design space in digital type is called the em, which is a grid with arbitrary resolution. Scaling the em to a particular point size is how imaging systems—whether for screen or print—work.

In digital type, the relationship of the height of particular letters to the em is arbitrarily set by the typeface designer. However, as a very rough guideline, an &quot;average&quot; font might have a cap height of 70% of the em, and an x-height of 48% of the em.
== Obsolete alternative definition ==
In some older texts, but not all, the em is defined, or said to have been defined, as the width of the capital &#x27;M&#x27; in the current typeface and point size. Possibly, this is because the &#x27;M&#x27; (or &#x27;m&#x27;) sort in such cases cast the full-width of the quad (also known as &quot;em quad&quot;, &quot;mutton quad&quot;, or &quot;m quadrat&quot;); and thus, the width of the sort would equal its point size.

Note however, that in the oldest attested English text from 1683 mentioning em (as &quot;m&quot; or m quadrat), this alternative definition is not used, and also not in many other older texts.
== CSS ==
In Cascading Style Sheets, the &quot;em&quot; unit is the height of the font in nominal points or inches. The actual, physical height of any given portion of the font depends on the user-defined DPI setting, current element font-size, and the particular font being used.

To make style rules that depend only on the default font size, another unit was developed: the rem. The rem &quot;«rem unit»&quot;, or root-em, is the font size of the root element of the document. Unlike the em, which may be different for each element, the rem is constant throughout the document.

<text>Bartholomew Consolidated School Corporation (BCSC) is a public school district located in Columbus, Indiana, United States. Its boundaries include all but two townships in Bartholomew County, Indiana. BCSC serves 11,000+ students (PreK-12, and Adult Education) on 18 campuses. 11 elementary, 3 high school, 2 middle school, 1 early childhood center, and 1 adult education center.

 BCSC School Board officers are President Nicole Wheeldon, Vice-President Rich Stenner, and Secretary Todd Grimes. BCSC is led by Superintendent Dr. Chad Phillips.

==History==

In 1981 &quot;The Republic&quot; argued that while school closures were difficult for the community, it was understandable that the school district allow a tertiary institution such as Ivy Tech or Indiana University–Purdue University Indianapolis to use school space that is no longer needed.

In 1985 &quot;The Republic&quot; editorial board praised the board of trustees for selecting Ralph Lieber as the superintendent.

==Curriculum==

Universal Design for Learning: BCSC uses Universal Design for Learning (UDL) as its instructional framework. It optimizes learning by reducing barriers in curricula and supports educators to design appropriately challenging instruction that meets the needs of all learners. The UDL framework also has supported BCSC to align initiatives and resources at the district level, moving from engaging in “random acts of improvement” to a unified vision of school change. All educator professional development must be grounded in UDL principles.

Positive Behavior Instruction and Support: BCSC has established school-based Positive Behavior Instruction and Support (PBIS) teams to ensure that all students have access to the most effective instructional and behavioral practices possible. PBIS supports educators to develop a continuum of scientifically-based behavior and academic supports, use data to make decisions and solve problems, arrange the environment to prevent the development and occurrence of problem behavior, teach and encourage pro-social skills and behaviors, implement evidence-based behavioral practices with fidelity and accountability, and monitor student performance and progress continuously. Researchers have suggested PBIS as an effective strategy for addressing racial and ethnic disproportionality in school discipline and the concomitant achievement gaps across racial and ethnic groups (Eber, Upreti, &amp; Rose, 2010).

Educational Pathways: Educational pathways allow students to explore college and career opportunities that align with their interests, strengths, and competencies. Examples include:
* Senior Project: A graduation requirement that calls on students to select a topic, pursue relevant community-based experience, and produce a research paper, project or a product, portfolio, and presentation. Every senior project must demonstrate clear alignment with Indiana’s Common Core Standards and demonstrate application of problem solving and authentic, real-world learning.
* Columbus Area Career Connection (C-4): Provides high school students with career and technical education organized into clusters, including: Agricultural Science/Business, Business Management and Finance, Communications, Computer Technology, Construction Engineering Technology, Engineering Manufacturing Technology, Health Careers, Human Services (including Early Childhood Education, Cosmetology, and Culinary Arts), Protective Services, and Transportation.
* Seamless High School Post-Secondary Education: An engineering and advanced manufacturing immersion program featuring aligned courses that feed into Mechanical Engineering degree programs at Indiana University/Purdue University Columbus (IUPUC) and the Purdue University School of Technology, and/or the Advanced Manufacturing program Ivy Tech State College.
* Columbus Signature Academy (CSA): In the first K-12 Project- and Problem-based Learning magnet school in the nation, students work collaboratively using technology to solve authentic problems and create real-world projects.

The school board voted to accept the addition of the &quot;Law in a Free Society&quot;, a civics education program, into the curriculum in February 1979.

<text>St. Paul&#x27;s School is a 500-room brick edifice in the Village of Garden City, New York, United States. As of 2010, the building is not currently used.

==History==
St. Paul&#x27;s was built by Cornelia Stewart, widow of Alexander Stewart, and dedicated in his honor. This building is of High Victorian Gothic design. The architect was William H. Harris. The cornerstone was laid on June 18, 1879, with attended by Cornelia Stewart, her brother Charles Clinch, Henry Hilton, and Abram Newkirk Littlejohn, the first Episcopal Bishop of Long Island. It took James L&#x27;Hommedieu four years to complete construction of this massive E-shaped building. It was crowned with a slate roof and a clock and bell tower. There were laboratories, classrooms, libraries, several dining halls, kitchens, a large reception parlor, permanent workspaces for staff, a beautiful gothic chapel, with seating for 400, dormitory space for 300 students, with spacious interior apartments on the top floors for teachers.

It opened in 1883 as a military school for boys, owned by the Episcopal Diocese of Long Island. In 1884, the St. Paul&#x27;s football team won the New York area championship. The school also had baseball and ice hockey teams. St. Paul&#x27;s remained a military school for only 10 years, afterward becoming a college preparatory academy.

At the turn of the 20th century, headmaster Rev. Frederick Luther Gamage stated the school&#x27;s mission to be to &quot;develop manly, Christian character, a strong physique, and the power to think.&quot; During Father Gamage&#x27;s tenure, a benefactor, George Bywater Cluett, an owner of the Cluett, Peabody and Company, a collar and shirt making firm in Troy, New York, provided funds for a gymnasium to be constructed as a memorial to Cluett&#x27;s son, Alfonzo Rockwell Cluett, who had been a student of Headmaster Gamage, approximately class of 1896, and after graduating from Yale University in 1900, died the following Christmas Eve of typhoid fever.

Approximately 1906, William Bradford Turner, a direct descendant of Massachuttes Bay Colony Governor William Bradford, enrolled at St. Paul&#x27;s in the third form (i.e. ninth grade); Turner would later go on to posthumously win the Congressional Medal of Honor, being killed in World War I.

In 1907, Headmaster Gamage left St. Paul&#x27;s, and some of its prestigious students, like Turner, and donors, like Cluett, went with him to found Trinity-Pawling School upstate. However, the school continued to prosper.

After the World Series finished in 1917, the pennant winning teams, the Chicago White Sox and New York Giants, came to St. Paul&#x27;s to play an exhibition baseball game to entertain the soldiers of the United States Army Rainbow Division, which was encamped nearby in Garden City. Participants in that game for the New York Giants included Manager John McGraw, and Jim Thorpe. The White Sox players included those soon to be infamous in the Black Sox Scandal.

The brother of United States President Donald Trump, Fred Trump, graduated from St. Paul&#x27;s in 1956. Their father, Fred Trump Sr., donated money to improve the soccer field, which was temporarily renamed Trump Field.

In 1970, a new gymnasium field house was built, and named for Father Nicholas Feringa, the former headmaster. At the opening, it was the largest indoor sports fieldhouse on Long Island, with four contiguous basketball courts. The New York Nets professional basketball team used it as their training facility, splitting the basketball complex with the students. Future Hall of Famer Rick Barry was on the Nets at that time, with the Nets using the same gym and the same locker rooms concurrently with the St. Paul&#x27;s students.

In 1991, St. Paul&#x27;s owner, the Episcopal Diocese of Long Island, entered bankruptcy, and being forced to sell its assets, St. Paul&#x27;s shut down. The Village of Garden City negotiated a &quot;friendly condemnation&quot;, and obtained the buildings and all 48 acres of land. The village has used the gymnasiums and athletic fields, but basic maintenance has been neglected.
The AIA Architectural Guide to Nassau and Suffolk Counties describes the building as having &quot;poly-chromatic voussoir arched windows, elaborate cast-iron balustrades, and Dorchester stone trim.&quot; The building was selected in 2003 by the Preservation League of New York State as one of its &quot;Seven to Save&quot; endangered properties.

Saint Paul&#x27;s featured prominently in the book published by then President&#x27;s Donald Trump&#x27;s niece, Mary L. Trump, &quot;Too Much and Never Enough&quot;, in which she explains that both of President Trump&#x27;s brothers, her own father Fred Trump Jr. and her uncle Robert Trump were alumni of Saint Paul&#x27;s. The book goes on to describe pranks by Freddie Trump&#x27;s friends including one by Homer Godwin.

==Development and demolition==

In 1993, the building was sold to the Incorporated Village of Garden City. The residents of Garden City were unable to come up with a viable plan to use the school for a different purpose. The Mayor of Garden City appointed a committee to make recommend uses for the buildings which recommended that the property be redeveloped, and leased for 99 years to a private senior assisted living company. The proposal was controversial because there was no municipal use of the buildings and because the proposal increased the building footprint and decreased green space, as well as lack of significant tax revenues.

In 1995, Tishman Speyer Properties conducted a preliminary inspection and evaluation on the potential to adapt the St. Paul&#x27;s buildings as the new Garden City High School. Tishman Speyer submitted four preliminary designs to the Garden City Board of Education for their consideration. The proposal was supported by many of the younger families; however, the Eastern Property Owners Association vigorously lobbied the Board of Education not to consider it out of fear it would cost more, and the Board of Education eventually took it off the table. Ironically, the alternative cost of renovating the Garden City Middle and High School subsequently proved to be even more.
In 2004, the Village Board of the Incorporated Village of Garden City voted to dedicate St. Paul&#x27;s School&#x27;s 48 acre (194,000 m2) site as parkland, with then Mayor Barbara Miller voting twice to break the tie of 4 board members in favor and 4 members opposed, on December 16. Removal of its designation as parkland would require the approval of the New York State Legislature.

In 2008, a Village-wide opinion poll was held, and the results were: Approve Demolition: 2,272 votes (45.4%); Approve Mothballing of Main Building: 1,857 votes (37.1%); Approve of the Avalon Bay proposal: 873 votes (17.5%). The total Voter Turnout was 5,002.

In 2014, an annex known as Ellis Hall, built in 1969 to provide additional school space, was demolished, although preservation plans included saving the annex.

<text>The Botany of Desire: A Plant&#x27;s-Eye View of the World is a 2001 nonfiction book by journalist Michael Pollan. Pollan presents case studies mirroring four types of human desires that are reflected in the way that we selectively grow, breed, and genetically engineer plants. Each of the book&#x27;s four parts discusses a different plant and a corresponding human desire for which it historically has been cultivated: the apple for sweetness; the tulip for beauty; cannabis for intoxication; and the potato for control.

The stories presented are a blend of plant science and natural history, ranging from the true story of Johnny Appleseed, to Pollan&#x27;s first-hand research with sophisticated cannabis hybrids in Amsterdam, to the paradigm-shifting possibilities of genetically engineered potatoes. Pollan also discusses the limitations of monoculture, specifically the adoption in Ireland of a single breed of potato (the Irish Lumper) which made the Irish population who depended on it in the 1840s inordinately vulnerable to a fungus to which the breed had no resistance, resulting in the Great Famine. Farmers in Peru, where the potato had ultimately originated, traditionally grew hundreds of distinct varieties, minimizing their exposure to any given pest and thereby the risk of famine.

<text>Cockspur Rum is a rum beverage from the Eastern Caribbean island nation of Barbados. It has been produced by Hanschell Inniss Ltd. since 1884. It has a rooster as its emblem.

Barbados is the country of origin of rumbullion, as it was originally called in the 18th century. Danish merchant Valdemar Hanschell established a liquor store in the 19th century where the rum was first distilled. Cockspur blends its rum while aging it in oak barrels, and it contains forty percent alcohol by volume.

The rum won the &quot;International Wine and Spirit Competition&#x27;s&quot; Gold Medal in 1981, 1984, and 1989. Proof66.com listed Cockspur among its &quot;Top 20 rated rums in the world&quot;.

Hanschell Inniss sponsored a three-year deal between 1987 and 1990 with the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) to sponsor the National Club Championship. This was renamed the &quot;Cockspur Cup&quot; for 2004.

<doc id="927996" wikidata="Q239793" url="?curid=927996" title="Ferrari F430">
<text>The Ferrari F430 (Type F131) is a sports car produced by the Italian automobile manufacturer Ferrari from 2004 until 2009 as a successor to the Ferrari 360. The car is an update to the 360 with exterior and performance changes. It was unveiled at the 2004 Paris Motor Show. The F430 was succeeded by the 458 which was unveiled on 28 July 2009. An estimated 16,750 F430s were produced between 2005 and 2009.

==Overview==

===Design===

Designed by Pininfarina in collaboration with Frank Stephenson (Director of Ferrari-Maserati Concept Design and Development), the body styling of the F430 was revised from its predecessor, the 360, to improve its aerodynamic efficiency. Although the drag coefficient remained the same, the downforce was greatly enhanced. Despite sharing the same basic Alcoa Aluminium chassis, roofline, doors, and glass, the car looked significantly different from the 360. A great extent of Ferrari heritage was included in the exterior design. At the rear, the Enzo&#x27;s tail lights and engine cover vents were added. The car&#x27;s name was etched on the Testarossa-styled driver&#x27;s side mirror. The large oval openings in the front bumper are reminiscent of Ferrari racing models from the 60s, specifically the 156 &quot;shark nose&quot; Formula One car.

===Engine===
The F430 features a V8 engine of the &quot;Ferrari-Maserati&quot; F136 family. This new power plant was a significant change for Ferrari, as all previous Ferrari V8&#x27;s were descendants of the Dino racing program of the 1950s. This fifty-year development cycle came to an end with the entirely new engine used in the F430, the architecture of which replaced the Dino-derived V12 in most other Ferrari cars. The engine&#x27;s output specifications are: , at 8,500 rpm and of torque at 5,250 rpm, 80% of which is available below 3,500 rpm. Despite a 20% increase in displacement, engine weight grew by only along with a decrease in diameter for easier packaging. The connecting rods, pistons and crankshaft were all entirely new, while the 4-valve cylinder head, valves and intake trumpets were directly retained from Formula 1 engines, for ideal volumetric efficiency. The F430 has a top speed in excess of and can accelerate from 0 to in 3.6 seconds, 0.6 seconds quicker than the old model.

===Brakes===
The brakes on the F430 were developed in close cooperation with Brembo and Bosch, resulting in a new cast-iron alloy for the discs. The new alloy includes molybdenum which has a better heat dissipation performance. The F430 was also available with the optional Carbon fibre-reinforced Silicon Carbide (C/SiC) ceramic composite brake package. Ferrari claimed the carbon ceramic brakes will not fade even after 300-360 laps at their test track.

===Features===
The F430 featured the &quot;E-Diff&quot;, a computer-controlled limited slip active differential which can vary the distribution of torque based on inputs such as steering angle and lateral acceleration.

Other notable features include the first application of Ferrari&#x27;s manettino steering wheel-mounted control knob. Drivers can select from five different settings which modify the vehicle&#x27;s ESC system, &quot;Skyhook&quot; electronic suspension, transmission behavior, throttle response, and E-Diff. The feature is similar to Land Rover&#x27;s &quot;Terrain Response&quot; system.

The F1 automated manual transmission was built by Graziano Trasmissioni.

The Ferrari F430 was available with exclusive Goodyear Eagle F1 GSD3 EMT tires, which have a V-shaped tread design, run-flat capability, and OneTRED technology.

In the US, the company requested an exemption from the airbag design requirements, which was eventually granted, allowing the car to continue to be sold in the US.

==Variants==

===F430 Spider===
The F430 Spider is the convertible version of the F430. It was unveiled at the 2005 Geneva Motor Show, making it Ferrari&#x27;s 21st road-going convertible.
The car was designed by Pininfarina with aerodynamic simulation programs used for Formula 1 cars.
The conversion from a closed top to an open-air convertible is a two-stage folding-action; the roof panel automatically folds away inside a space above the engine bay. The interior and performance of the Spider are identical to that of the coupé with an increase in the weight and decrease in the top speed by .

===430 Scuderia===
Serving as the successor to the 360 Challenge Stradale, the 430 Scuderia (&quot;scuderia&quot; meaning &quot;stable&quot;, but also used in the context of motor racing teams, including Ferrari&#x27;s own) was unveiled by Michael Schumacher at the 2007 Frankfurt Auto Show. Aimed to compete with cars like the Porsche 911 GT2 and the Lamborghini Gallardo Superleggera (&quot;superleggera&quot; meaning super light weight), it is lighter (by ) and more powerful ( at 8,500 rpm and of torque at 5,250 rpm) than the standard F430. Increased power comes from a revised intake, exhaust, and an ion-sensing knock-detection system that allows for a higher compression ratio in the engine. Thus the weight-to-power ratio is reduced from 2.96 kg/hp to 2.5 kg/hp.
In addition to the weight saving measures, the Scuderia&#x27;s single-clutch automated manual gained improved &quot;Superfast&quot; software, known as &quot;Superfast2&quot;, for faster 60 millisecond shift times. A new traction control system combined the F1-Trac traction from the 599 GTB and stability control with the E-Diff electronic differential. The Ferrari 430 Scuderia accelerates from 0- in 3.6 seconds, with a top speed of .

===Scuderia Spider 16M===

To commemorate Ferrari&#x27;s 16th victory in the Formula 1 Constructor&#x27;s World Championship in 2008, Ferrari unveiled the Scuderia Spider 16M at World Finals in Mugello. It is a convertible version of the 430 Scuderia.

The engine is rated at at 8,500 rpm and of torque at 5,250 rpm. The car has a dry weight of ( lighter than the F430 Spider) and a kerb weight of . The chassis was stiffened to cope with the extra performance available and the car featured many carbon fibre parts and weight saving measures as standard such as lightened front and rear bumpers. Unique 5-spoke forged wheels were specifically produced for the 16M and helped to considerably reduce unsprung weight with larger front brakes and calipers added for extra stopping power (also featured on 430 Scuderia). It accelerates from 0- in 3.7 seconds, with a top speed of .&lt;ref name=&quot;italiaspeed.com/2008/cars&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

499 cars were produced beginning early 2009 and all were pre-sold to select clients.

==Special editions==

===F430 Spider Bio Fuel===
A version of the F430 Spider that runs on ethanol, called the F430 Spider Bio Fuel, was on display at the 2008 Detroit Auto Show. It had the same 4.3 litre V8 engine as the standard car, producing , with a 4% increase in torque and with 5% less carbon dioxide emissions than the standard F430 Spider.

===SP1===

The F430-based Ferrari SP1 (Special Project Number 1), was the first one-off special produced by the Ferrari Portfolio Coachbuilding Programme, also known as the Special Projects Programme (SP). The body was designed by former Pininfarina designer Leonardo Fioravanti, at the behest of Junichiro Hiramatsu, a Japanese businessman who was the former president of the Ferrari Club of Japan and an avid collector; he had admired Fioravanti&#x27;s 1998 F100 prototype.

==Racing==

===F430 Challenge===
The F430 Challenge is the track version of the F430, designed for the Ferrari Challenge. The engine remained untouched but the vehicle&#x27;s weight was reduced, resulting in a top speed of . The production model was unveiled at the Los Angeles Auto Show in January 2005.

===F430 GTC===

Built since 2006 by &quot;Ferrari Corse Clienti&quot; department in collaboration with , the F430 GTC is a racing car designed to compete in international GT2 class competition, such as in the American Le Mans Series, Le Mans Series, and FIA GT Championship. F430 GTCs also compete at the 24 Hours of Le Mans. The GTC was the fastest and most developed racing version of the F430.

In FIA GT2 championship, in order to render the car performances more uniform, the cars are forced to run with a specific minimum weight and with an engine restrictor that depends on the engine displacement. Hence Ferrari destroked the 4.3 L V8 engine to 4.0 L in order to compete in the 3.8–4.0 L class in GT2 class racing, which is allowed to race with a minimum weight of . In this race configuration, the engine produces somewhat less power, at . If they were to use the 4.3-litre engine, the minimum weight of the F430 would increase by , and the 4.0-litre engine thus yields a better power-to-weight ratio.

The F430 GTCs won their class championships in the ALMS and FIA GT, as well as scoring class wins at the 2007, 2009 and 2010 12 Hours of Sebring, at the 2008 and 2009 24 Hours of Le Mans and at the 2008 and 2009 Petit Le Mans.

===F430 GT3===

Originally based on the F430 Challenge, the F430 GT3 is a specialised racing car developed in 2006 by JMB Racing for the FIA GT3 European Championship and other national GT championships such as British GT and FFSA GT. It is mechanically similar to the F430 Challenge but has better-developed aerodynamics and more power.

The car uses the same 4.3 L V8 engine, tuned to produce , making the GT3 more powerful than its GT2 counterpart. However, due to the GT3 regulations stating that the car must have a power-to-weight ratio of around 2.6 kg/hp, the car weighs in race trim (driver and fuel excluded), which is roughly more than the GT2 spec car. Despite the higher power, it is significantly slower than the GT2 version; for example, in the 2007 Spa 24 Hours endurance race, in which both models were entered, the GT3 spec vehicles&#x27; best qualification time was around 8 seconds slower per lap than that set by the GT2 spec vehicle.

===430 GT3 Scuderia===
Developed by Kessel Racing for the 2009 season, the 430 GT3 Scuderia is the successor of the previous F430 GT3.

==Recall==
In February 2009, Ferrari recalled about 2,000 (2005–2007) F430 Spiders in the U.S., due to the risk that heat from the engine could cause the convertible top&#x27;s hydraulic hoses to fracture and leak flammable fluid onto the engine, resulting in a fire.

While only in their second season, Passke and Rasmussen won the 2003 World Championship in Birmingham. This was the first time in 20 years that the title was won by Denmark. The same year, Paaske and Rasmussen achieved yet another historical result by winning China Open and were thereby the first Europeans to win the title. The following 12 months Paaske and Rasmussen held the number one position on the world ranking list. Lars Paaske and Jonas Rasmussen have never lost a match when representing the Danish National team in the Thomas Cup.

Lars Paaske played well on National ground, winning the Denmark Open MD title with Jonas Rasmussen in 2004 and 2006 and in 2007 they came second.

In 2008 Paaske became European Champion in MD and now Paaske and Rasmussen are chasing the missing medal in their collection, an Olympic medal. 
Lars Paaske represented Denmark in Sydney in 2000 together with Martin Lundgaard, in 2004 together with Jonas Rasmussen and in 2008 in Beijing also with Jonas Rasmussen.

In March 2010, Paaske and Rasmussen beat fellow countrymen Boe &amp; Morgenson to win the 2010 All England Open in Men&#x27;s doubles.

<doc id="928007" wikidata="Q7045816" url="?curid=928007" title="Noble and Greenough School">
<text>The Noble and Greenough School, commonly known as Nobles, is a coeducational, nonsectarian day and five-day boarding school in Dedham, Massachusetts, a suburb of Boston. It educates 638 boys and girls in grades 7–12. The school&#x27;s campus borders the Charles River.

The school&#x27;s list of notable alumni includes Harvard University president A. Lawrence Lowell, Nobel laureate George Minot, and two governors of Massachusetts. In addition, Nobles previously operated an elementary school, which educated U.S. President John F. Kennedy.

==History==

=== Founding and move to Dedham ===
In 1866, Washington University in St. Louis Latin professor George Washington Copp Noble returned to Boston and founded Noble&#x27;s Classical School as an all-boys college-preparatory school. He renamed the school to Noble &amp; Greenough School in 1892, when his son-in-law James Greenough joined the faculty. The school was originally a for-profit entity run by the Noble family, but in 1913, after Greenough&#x27;s death, a coalition of Nobles alumni purchased the school from Noble and reorganized the school as a nonprofit corporation under the control of a board of trustees.

Nobles historically drew most of its students from &quot;the fashionable families of Greater Boston&quot;; sociologist Digby Baltzell called it &quot;Proper Boston&#x27;s most exclusive day school.&quot; The school primarily catered to members of the Episcopal Church; a 1954 alumnus recalled that when he was at Nobles, there were only two non-Episcopalian students. (A Unitarian, John Richardson &#x27;04, served as president of the Nobles board from 1921 to 1964.) In its early days, Nobles cycled through a series of buildings in Boston. In 1922, at the peak of the country day school movement, the school moved to suburban Dedham, where it has remained ever since. (In the 1920s, Nobles, Roxbury Latin, and Belmont Hill all set up campuses in the Boston suburbs.) The property had previously been the estate of Albert W. Nickerson, a Nobles grandparent, who had commissioned Frederick Law Olmsted to lay out the site. Nickerson&#x27;s Richardsonian Romanesque mansion, popularly dubbed &quot;the Castle,&quot; now serves as the school&#x27;s dining hall.

In 1926, shortly after moving to Dedham, Nobles discontinued its primary school program. In response, a coalition of Nobles parents (including Joseph Kennedy Sr.) started the Dexter School. One of the Nobles elementary school students who transferred to Dexter was third-grader John F. Kennedy.

=== Predecessors ===
Nobles is descended from various Boston college-preparatory day schools, all of which primarily prepared students for the Harvard College entrance examinations. The curriculum of these schools was primarily classical, as until 1887, Harvard required applicants to study both Latin and Greek. Moreover, even after 1887, Harvard still required applicants to demonstrate either &quot;an elementary working knowledge&quot; of Latin and Greek, or advanced preparation in mathematics or natural sciences. According to James Greenough, in practice, only students &quot;especially adapted to the study of mathematics and natural science&quot; could get into Harvard without studying the classics.

In the nineteenth century, most public high schools lacked the resources to employ a classics teacher. By contrast, classically oriented private schools like Nobles and its predecessors were very successful at preparing students to pass Harvard&#x27;s entrance exams.

* In 1851, Boston Latin School headmaster Epes Sargent Dixwell resigned from BLS to found Dixwell&#x27;s Private Latin School. From 1846 to 1870, Dixwell&#x27;s and Nobles supplied 12% of Harvard undergraduates, more than every other Boston-area private day school combined.
* Dixwell retired in 1872 and was succeeded by John Prentiss Hopkinson, who renamed the school Hopkinson School. Hopkinson was the brother-in-law of Harvard president Charles Eliot, and from 1870 to 1895, Hopkinson&#x27;s was Harvard&#x27;s third-largest feeder school, with 331 students. Other Hopkinson&#x27;s teachers included Arthur Volkmann and James Greenough, both of whom eventually joined the Nobles faculty.
* Hopkinson retired in 1897 and redistributed his remaining students between Nobles and Volkmann School, which Arthur Volkmann had opened in 1895. From 1906 to 1915, Nobles and Volkmann&#x27;s were Harvard&#x27;s fourth- and tenth-largest feeder schools, with 232 and 133 students; if combined, they would have been the second-largest, behind Boston Latin and ahead of Phillips Exeter. Nobles and Volkmann&#x27;s merged in 1917 due to declining enrollment at Volkmann&#x27;s; amidst anti-German sentiment in the United States during World War I, newspapers had falsely accused the Prussian-born Volkmann of being a German spy.
Nobles claims the history and alumni of Volkmann School. In 1966, Volkmann&#x27;s alumni erected a monument to their alma mater on the Nobles campus. It is less clear whether Nobles claims the alumni of Dixwell&#x27;s or Hopkinson&#x27;s. The school does not claim Dixwell&#x27;s 1851 foundation date. However, Nobles&#x27; Latin prize is named after Epes Dixwell, and in 1923 Nobles erected a plaque honoring Dixwell&#x27;s alumnus Gerrit Smith Miller, an early pioneer of American football.

=== Recent years ===
Nobles began admitting black students in 1964 and girls in 1974. The school had initially attempted to merge with Winsor School, an all-girls prep school in Boston, but negotiations were unsuccessful.

In 2017, Harvard&#x27;s student newspaper reported that Nobles was Harvard&#x27;s fourth-largest feeder school, behind Boston Latin School, Phillips Academy, and Stuyvesant High School. From 2019 to 2023, the school sent 52 students (out of roughly 650) to Harvard. Many of these students come through Nobles&#x27; athletic programs. In the 2020–21 school year, Nobles was the single largest contributor to the Harvard Crimson varsity teams, with 15 students on Harvard rosters. 14 of these 15 students were on the lacrosse, ice hockey, and rowing teams.

From 2013 to 2018, Nobles conducted a $137 million fundraising campaign, which increased the school&#x27;s endowment by $60 million and raised funds to build a new library and renovate the Castle.

Nobles has had only seven heads of school in over 150 years. In 2017, Catherine J. Hall became Nobles&#x27; first female Head of School. During her tenure, the percentage of self-identified students of color increased from 35% in the 2018–19 school year to 49% in the 2023–24 school year. The percentage of students on financial aid increased from 28% to 30% during the same timeframe.

=== List of Heads of School ===
== Admissions and student body ==

Nobles is primarily a day high school, although it operates a middle school for 110 students and a five-day boarding program for 50 students. The school enrolled 638 students in the 2023–24 school year, 49% of whom identified as students of color, and 30% of whom were on financial aid.

Nobles had a 16% admission rate in 2023. Students are primarily admitted in the seventh and ninth grades (55 and 65 incoming students per year, respectively). In the 2023–24 school year, 39% of Nobles students came from public schools, 8% from charter or parochial schools, and 53% from private schools.

== Finances ==

=== Tuition and financial aid ===
In the 2023–24 school year, Nobles charged 5-day boarding students $68,600 and day students $62,600.

Nobles provides need-based financial aid and commits to meet 100% of each admitted student&#x27;s demonstrated financial need. In the 2023–24 school year, 30% of students were on financial aid, and the average aid grant was $44,935 (75% of day student tuition).

=== Endowment and expenses ===
In its Internal Revenue Service filings for the 2021–22 school year, Nobles reported total assets of $328.0 million, net assets of $270.6 million, investment holdings of $191.7 million, and cash holdings of $22.8 million. Nobles also reported $46.2 million in program service expenses and $9.1 million in grants (primarily student financial aid).

== Athletics ==
Nobles competes in the Independent School League, a group of day and boarding schools in Greater Boston. The school&#x27;s website says that 74 Nobles teams have won ISL championships and that as of the 2023–24 school year, 87% of the varsity teams &quot;have had a winning record in the past 10 years.&quot; In the 2014–15 school year, eight Nobles alumnae were on the Harvard women&#x27;s hockey team.

=== Rivalries ===
Nobles&#x27; primary athletic rival was initially Volkmann&#x27;s. After the two schools merged and Nobles left Boston for Dedham, the rivalry shifted to Milton Academy, located in the nearby suburb of Milton. In contrast to Nobles&#x27; Episcopalian base, Milton historically educated Boston&#x27;s Unitarian elite, giving a religious edge to the rivalry. The rivalry predates the move to Dedham, as the two schools began playing football in 1886; as such, Nobles-Milton is the nation&#x27;s fifth-oldest high school football rivalry. However, Nobles did not beat Milton until 1932, after the move to Dedham.

Nobles also counts Roxbury Latin School as a secondary rival.

Since neither Milton nor Roxbury Latin sponsor rowing, Nobles&#x27; primary crew rival is Groton School, a matchup dating back to 1922.

<doc id="928010" wikidata="Q2282444" url="?curid=928010" title="Seven-league boots">
<text>Seven-league boots are an element in European folklore. The boots allow the person wearing them to take strides of seven leagues per step, resulting in great speed. The boots are often presented by a magical character to the protagonist to aid in the completion of a significant task. From the context of English language, &quot;seven-league boots&quot; originally arose as a translation from the French , popularised by Charles Perrault&#x27;s fairy tales.

Mentions of the legendary boots are found in:
* France – Charles Perrault&#x27;s &quot;Hop o&#x27; My Thumb&quot;; Madame d&#x27;Aulnoy&#x27;s &quot;The Bee and the Orange Tree&quot;; Marcel Proust&#x27;s &quot;In Search of Lost Time&quot;.
* Germany – The Brothers Grimm&#x27;s &quot;Sweetheart Roland&quot;; Adelbert von Chamisso&#x27;s &quot;Peter Schlemiel&quot;; Goethe&#x27;s &quot;Faust&quot; (Mephistopheles uses them at the start of Part Two, Act Four); Wilhelm Hauff&#x27;s &quot;Der Kleine Muck&quot;.
* Norway – Peter Christen Asbjørnsen and Jørgen Moe&#x27;s &quot;Soria Moria Castle&quot;.
* Britain – Richard Doyle&#x27;s &quot;Jack the Giant Killer&quot;; John Masefield&#x27;s &quot;The Midnight Folk&quot;; C. S. Lewis&#x27;s &quot;The Pilgrim&#x27;s Regress&quot;; Master Merlin (Pseudonym) and Dugald A. Steer&#x27;s &quot;Wizardoligy, A Guide to Wizards of the World&quot;; Terry Pratchett&#x27;s &quot;The Light Fantastic&quot;; Jonathan Stroud&#x27;s&quot; The Bartimaeus Trilogy&quot;; Jenny Nimmo&#x27;s &quot;Midnight for Charlie Bone&quot;; Diana Wynne Jones&#x27;s &quot;Howl&#x27;s Moving Castle&quot;; Evelyn Waugh&#x27;s &quot;The Loved One&quot;; E. Nesbit&#x27;s &quot;The Enchanted Castle&quot;; George Eliot&#x27;s &quot;The Mill On The Floss&quot;.
* United States – Zane Grey&#x27;s &quot;The Last of the Plainsmen&quot;; Ruth Chew&#x27;s &quot;What the Witch Left&quot;; Gail Carson Levine&#x27;s &quot;The Two Princesses of Bamarre&quot;; Mark Twain&#x27;s &quot;The Innocents Abroad&quot;; Roger Zelazny&#x27;s &quot;Bring Me the Head of Prince Charming&quot;; Clair Blank&#x27;s &quot;Beverly Gray at the World&#x27;s Fair&quot;; Kelly Barnhill&#x27;s &quot;The Girl Who Drank the Moon&quot;; and Nathaniel Hawthorne&#x27;s &quot;The Village Uncle&quot;.
* Russia – Arkady and Boris Strugatsky&#x27;s &quot;Monday Starts on Saturday&quot;.

== Etymology ==
From the context of the English language, &quot;seven-league boots&quot; originally arose as a translation from the French , popularised by Charles Perrault&#x27;s fairy tales. A league (roughly ) was considered to represent the distance walked in an hour by an average man. If a man were to walk seven hours per day, he would, then, walk seven leagues, or about . In the 17th century, postboys&#x27; boots were called &quot;seven-league boots&quot;. While some suggest that the &quot;seven leagues&quot; references the distance between post houses (postboys would only have their boots touch the ground at every coach inn, when changing the horses), this is inaccurate: the distance between coach inns was fixed at no more than five leagues.

== Other variations ==

=== In fiction ===
==== Folklore ====
* Russian folklore has a similar magic item called (fast-pace boots), which allows the person wearing them to walk and run at an amazing pace.
* In Finnish and Estonian translations of stories with seven-league boots, they are often translated as (Finnish) and (Estonian), literally &quot;boots of seven Scandinavian miles&quot;.
* Japanese scholar Kunio Yanagita listed a tale titled &quot;The Thousand-ri Boots&quot; from Yamanashi and wondered about its great similarity to a tale in the &quot;Pentamerone&quot; with a pair of seven-league boots.
* In Latvian tales, the phrase &quot;nine-mile boots&quot; () is used.
* Jewish Folklore: the concept of kefitzat haderek (קפיצת הדרך), jumping, or folding, the way, is a concept found in Talmud, midrash, folklore, and mysticism.

<text>Michael &quot;Scotty&quot; Scott (born February 11, 1945) is an American entrepreneur, who was the first CEO of Apple Computer from February 1977 to March 1981. Formerly director of manufacturing at National Semiconductor, Scott was persuaded by Mike Markkula to take the CEO position at Apple, as the co-founders — Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak — were both seen as insufficiently experienced for the job at the time.

==Career ==
After graduating from the California Institute of Technology, Scott worked at Fairchild Semiconductor where he shared a cubicle with Mike Markkula and Gene Carter; all 3 would later end up working together at Apple.

=== Apple ===
Attempting to set an example for all businesses, in 1979, Scott declared there would be no typewriters at Apple. In 1979 and 1980, Jef Raskin&#x27;s Macintosh project was a four-person research effort. It wasn&#x27;t considered important within Apple and was almost canceled a couple of times. When Apple had another major reorganization in the fall of 1980, it was terminated again, but Raskin pleaded with Scott and Markkula for more time and was granted three more months to show that he was really onto something.

On February 25, 1981, the day known as &quot;Black Wednesday&quot; at the company, Scott personally fired forty Apple employees, including half of the Apple II team, in a belief that they were redundant. Later in the afternoon he assembled the remaining employees with a keg of beer and explained the firings by stating, &quot;I used to say that when being CEO at Apple wasn&#x27;t fun anymore, I&#x27;d quit. But now I&#x27;ve changed my mind — when it isn&#x27;t fun any more, I&#x27;ll fire people until it&#x27;s fun again.&quot;

Following this abrupt event, he was moved to vice chairman, a title with little power, and Mike Markkula, the man who had hired Scott, replaced him.

Scott left Apple officially on July 10, 1981, stating in his resignation letter:
===Later career===

From 1983 to 1988, Scott led Starstruck, a private firm that attempted to create a sea-based satellite-launching rocket. He also began supporting non-profit organizations, such as the Seattle Opera and the California Institute of Technology in their efforts to apply personal computers to their needs.

===Gemstone expert===

Scott has since become an expert on colored gemstones, having written a book on them and assembled a collection that has been exhibited at the Bowers Museum in Santa Ana, California. He also sponsored Rruff, a project creating a complete set of high-quality spectral data from well-characterized minerals. The mineral rruffite (IMA 2009-077) was named for the Rruff project and the mineral scottyite (IMA 2012-027) for Michael Scott.

<text>The Wadiyar dynasty,() also referred to as the Wadiyars of Mysore (also spelt Wodeyer, Odeyer, and Wadeyar), is a late-medieval Indian royal family of former maharajas of Mysore from the Urs clan originally based in Mysore city. The Wadiyar dynasty claims descent from the Yaduvanshi Jadaun Rajputs who migrated from Gujarat to Vijayanagara. Here they assumed the title ‘Wadiyar’ which stands for ‘Lord’ in the local Kannada language.

As Maharajas of Mysore, the Wadiyars ruled the Kingdom of Mysore from the late 1300s until 1950. Members of the Wadiyar dynasty and the Urs clan have also been royal advisers as dewans to their reigning siblings, cousins, nephews, or distant relatives. Some members have also commanded army divisions as &quot;dalvoys&quot; (commander-in-chief) for their reigning monarch.

During the late 14th century, the family was originally &quot;poleygars&quot; (Kannada for garrison) defending the regions in and around Mysore town for the Vijayanagara Empire, their feudal overlords. With the fall and decline of the empire in the 17th century, the Wadiyars declared independence when Timmaraja Wodeyar II seized the nearby town of Srirangapattana, the seat of Tirumala, Sriranga II&#x27;s viceroy, in 1610. Between 1766 and 1799, when Hyder Ali and Tipu dictated the kingdom, the Wadiyar rulers as maharajas were largely nominal without any actual powers. After Tipu&#x27;s execution in 1799, the East India Company which governed large territories in India at that time restored the kingdom back to the Wadiyars under a subsidiary alliance. After India&#x27;s independence from the Crown, the ruling Maharaja Jayachamaraja Wadiyar ceded the kingdom to the newly formed Dominion of India.

==Name==
In Kannada, the common noun &quot;odeyaru&quot; ( ) is the plural form of &quot;odeya&quot; (ಒಡೆಯ) which means &quot;lord&quot; or &quot;lordship&quot;. The first poleygar and raja of Mysore, Yaduraya, assumed the term as his titular proper noun.

Members of the Wadiyar dynasty hail from the Urs clan; upon adoption or by heredity, they assume the title &quot;Wadiyar&quot; and their immediate family therewith, the latest instance of its happening with the present head of the family Yaduveer Wadiyar upon his coronation in 2015.

==History==
The Wadiyars claim descent from the Hindu deity Krishna. Legend has it that they arrived from Dvārakā. However, historians like P. V. Nanjaraj Urs, Shyam Prasad, Nobuhiro Ota, David Leeming, and Aya Ikegame instead suggest that the Wadiyars were local feudal lords who purported Puranic ancestry and claimed to be the direct descendants of the Lunar Dynasty.

=== Vassal fiefdom ===
The Wadiyar dynasty started when Yaduraya, a garrison leader (&quot;poleygar&quot;), was made the prefect of Mysore and the surrounding regions by his overlord Harihara II of the Vijayanagara Empire in 1399. With this, Yaduraya assumed the title Raja and the honorary surname Wadiyar. He and his successors ruled the fiefdom of Mysore as rajas under the vassalage of the Vijayanagara Empire until around 1553.

=== Independent kingdom ===
The Vijayanagara Empire disintegrated in 1565. With the fall of the empire, Mysore became an independent kingdom, the first independent king being Timmaraja Wodeyar II, the great-great-great-grandson of the founding ruler Yaduraya. Thimmaraja&#x27;s nephew Raja Wodeyar I expanded the borders of the kingdom. In 1610, he moved the capital from Mysore to nearby island town of Srirangapattana on the river Kaveri, which provided strategic protection against military attacks. Raja Wadiya&#x27;s cousin and successor down the line Kanthirava Narasaraja I expanded the frontiers of the kingdom to Trichy in present-day Tamil Nadu. The kingdom reached its peak under Kanthirava&#x27;s grand-nephew Devaraja Wodeyar II, who reformed the administration of the kingdom by dividing it into 18 departments (called &quot;chavadis&quot;); he also introduced a coherent system of taxation.
===During Hyder Ali and Tipu===
From 1760 to 1799, the rule of the Wadiyar dynasty was essentially nominal, with real power firmly in the hands of the Commander-in-chief and later self-proclaimed sultan, Hyder Ali, and his son and successor Tipu. The two, ruling the sultanate from Srirangapattana, expanded the kingdom aggressively.

===Independent kingdom in a subsidiary alliance===
After Tipu&#x27;s defeat in the Siege of Srirangapattana during the Fourth Anglo-Mysore War in 1799, the British restored the Kingdom to the Wadiyars under a subsidiary alliance that required an annual payment as tribute. The capital was moved back to Mysore. The four-year-old infant prince Krishnaraja Wodeyar III, adopted son of the previous ruler Chamaraja Wadiyar IX, was anointed as the Maharaja of Mysore.

In 1831, on a specious plea of non-payment by Krishnaraja Wodeyar III, the kingdom was placed under Mysore Commission that lasted from 1831 to 1881. Mark Cubbon and L. B. Bowring were among the well-known commissioners of the period.

In 1868, upon Krishnaraja Wodeyar III&#x27;s demise, his five-year-old grandson Chamaraja Wadiyar X became the heir to the throne. When in 1881 he attained the age of majority, through an act of parliament, the British once again transferred power back to the Wadiyars. The maharaja changed the English spelling of their royal name from Wodeyar to Wadiyar. He established the Mysore Representative Assembly; the first of its kind in Princely India.

Chamaraja Wadiyar X&#x27;s son and successor Krishnaraja Wadiyar IV earned great fame as a saintly king, and his kingdom was hailed as &quot;Ramarajya&quot; by Mahatma Gandhi–as an ideal kingdom comparable to the one ruled by Lord Rama.

Krishnaraja Wadiyar IV&#x27;s nephew, successor, and the last reigning king of the Wadiyar dynasty, Jayachamarajendra Wadiyar, ruled from 1940 until 1950. Upon India&#x27;s independence from the British crown in 1947, Jayachamarajendra Wadiyar ceded his kingdom to the new provisional Dominion of India but continued as Maharajah until India became a Republic in 1950.

=== Dissolution of the kingdom ===
Jayachamarajendra Wadiyar became the rajapramukh of the renamed Mysore State from 1950 to 1956. After the reorganisation of Indian states on a linguistic basis in 1956, he was appointed Governor of the integrated Mysore State (present Karnataka State), a post which he held until 1964. He was then appointed Governor of Madras (now Tamil Nadu) for two years.

The Indian Constitution continued to recognise him as the Maharajah of Mysore until 1971, when titles and privy purses of maharajas were abolished by the Government of India under Indira Gandhi. The maharajah died in 1974.

His only son Srikantadatta Narasimharaja Wadiyar became the head of the family; he was a member of the Indian Parliament.

Upon Srikantadatta Wadiyar&#x27;s demise 2013, his widowed wife Devi Pramoda Wadiyar adopted Yaduveer Wadiyar, who was anointed as the maharaja of Mysore and the head of the family in 2015.
== Residences ==
Mysore Palace has been the official residence of the Wadiyars for most of the family&#x27;s recorded history. Briefly, Srirangapattana was also the seat of the Wadiyars. By the early 1900s, Bangalore had seen significant infrastructural development and had become a secondary residence for the Wadiyars at the Bangalore Palace.

== Alamelamma&#x27;s Curse ==
With a declining Vijayanagara Empire, in 1610 Raja Wadiyar conquered the fort of Srirangapattana from Tirumala, the Vijayanagara viceroy stationed there. Tirumala is said to have retired to the nearby town of Talakadu with his two wives. At about the same time, Tirumala suffered from a terminal disease; his condition deteriorated and he eventually died.

One of his wives was Alamelamma, a staunch devotee of Ranganayaki, the consort of Lord Ranganatha, the presiding deity of the famous Adi-Ranga temple in the island fortress of Srirangapatna. Alamelamma had a large amount of jewellery, including a fine nose ring studded with a large pearl. As a widow, customs forbade jewellery on her. She frequently lent the jewels to the temple of Ranganayaki. Every Tuesdays and Fridays, Ranaganayaki&#x27;s idol would be decorated with the jewellery, returned to Alamelamma&#x27;s safe custody for rest of the week.

On one instance, the temple requested the king&#x27;s soldiers to fetch the jewels from Alamelamma as has become a practice. An approaching king&#x27;s emissaries, headed by Chief Courtier Ramanath Molahalli, seems to have scared her off. To escape an ill-presumed imminent wrath of the king, she ran over to a cliff overlooking the Kaveri river into the whirlpool and cursed before plunging to her own death, &quot;may Talakadu become a barren expanse of land, Malangi turn into a whirlpool, and may kings of Mysore never beget children to all eternity&quot; (Kannada: ತಲಕಾಡು ಮರಳಾಗಲಿ, ಮಾಲಂಗಿ ಮಡುವಾಗಲಿ, ಮೈಸೂರು ದೊರೆಗಳಿಗೆ ಮಕ್ಕಳಿಲ್ಲದೆ ಹೋಗಲಿ; transliteration: talakāḍu maral̤āgali, mālaṃgi maḍuvāgali, maisūru dŏrĕgal̤igĕ makkal̤illadĕ hogali).

=== Alamelamma&#x27;s idol ===
Learning of this accident, the king felt repentant and had an idol of Alamelamma made in gold, installed it in the palace, and worshipped it as a deity. To this day, the idol can be found in Mysore Palace. The king&#x27;s only surviving son, Narasaraja Wadiyar, died (believed to be an effect of the curse in folklore).

The Dasara festivities inside the palace end on the evening of Navarathri with a formal pooja to Alamelamma. Another interesting part of the story is that the Alamelamma temple is under the care of her legal heirs. Strangely, these priests/caretakers appear to be cursed by the same curse, following the same pattern afflicting the Wadiyars.

=== Talakadu and Malangi ===

Talakadu and Malangi are two small towns near Tirumakudalu Narasipura on the banks of the Kaveri where the river takes a bend. To date, most parts of Talakadu lie under sand, and the village of Malangi is slowly eroding due to whirlpools. Talakadu&#x27;s temples lie buried in a vast expanse of sand and are dug up and exposed every 12 years. At Malangi, on the other hand, the river is at its deepest. Whether these phenomena appeared only after Alamelamma&#x27;s curse in 1610 is a matter of conjecture.

== Family tree of the Wadiyars ==

=== Direct lineage from Yaduraya ===
Raja Yaduraya is recorded as the founding ruler of the Kingdom of Mysore. The sixteenth maharaja Krishnaraja Wodeyar I was the last direct male lineage of Raja Yaduraja. However, Krishnaraja Wodeyar I&#x27;s successor was his adopted son, Maharaja Chamaraja Wodeyar VII from the Ankanahalli Urs branch. After him, Maharaja Chamaraja Wodeyar III&#x27;s second daughter Rajakumari Chikkadevi&#x27;s family with the Bettada Kote Urs branch takes over the monarchy.







=== Bettada Kote (Hill Fort) Urs branch ===
The Bettada Kote Urs was one of the larger &quot;jagirs&quot;, or feudal estates, in the Kingdom of Mysore. After the death of the 22nd ruler Maharaja Chamaraja Wodeyar VIII, his widowed queen mother Maharani Lakshmi Devi adopted Chamaraja Wodeyar IX of the Bettada Kote Urs branch which continues to-date.








=== Kalale Urs branch ===







=== Maddur Urs branch ===







== Contributions ==
The Wadiyars were patrons of fine arts, fostering a number of famous musicians, writers and painters. Their contributions to music and literature has rendered the city of Mysore a cultural centre of Karnataka.

<text>The Aermacchi AL-60 is a light civil utility aircraft of the late 1950s and early 1960s, originally designed by Al Mooney of Lockheed in the United States. After the company decided not to build the aircraft in the US, it was manufactured in small quantities in Mexico, and a few were assembled in Argentina (Santa Isabel, Córdoba) by Aviones Lockheed-Kaiser Argentina. It was also built in quantity under licence by Aermacchi in Italy and Atlas Aircraft Corporation in South Africa.

==Design and development==
In the late 1950s, the American aircraft designer Al Mooney, who had recently joined Lockheed after leaving the company that bore his name, was given the task of designing a utility aircraft, the CL-402, suitable for use in underdeveloped countries. As Lockheed could not build the design at an economic price in the United States, it was instead intended for the aircraft to be built under licence outside the United States, where labour costs were lower. The first prototype CL-402, powered by a Continental IO-470-G engine, flew for the first time at Lockheed&#x27;s Marietta, Georgia on 15 September 1959, with a second prototype, powered by a turbocharged TSIO-470-B engine rated at followed a few months later. 

The initial production deal was made with Mexico, where a joint venture, Lockheed-Azcarate SA (LASA) was set up to build the CL-402 as the LASA-60, with a factory being built near San Luis Potosí. Type certification by the US Federal Aviation Administration was received on 5 April 1960. While it was planned that 240 aircraft would be built by LASA by 1963, the type was less popular than hoped, with LASA stopping production in April 1962. LASA built 41 LASA-60s, with 18 aircraft purchased by the Mexican Air Force.

A second joint venture was set up with Argentina, between Lockheed and Industrias Kaiser Argentina, with the name Aviones Lockheed-Kaiser. Production began of a batch of 16 aircraft in 1961, but was stopped after 11 had been completed.
In Italy, Aermacchi purchased a licence to produce the type, first in its original configuration as the AL-60B, then in a modified version for various African customers as the AL-60C. This latter version changed from the original tricycle undercarriage to a taildragger arrangement.

The AL-60C version was built under license by Atlas Aircraft Corporation in South Africa. This aircraft was known as Atlas C4M Kudu. Over 40 aircraft were built and served the South African Air Force between 1974 and 1991.

A number of C4M Kudu aircraft are still flying privately and have proven well in the role of skydive release aircraft. They have been re-engined with turbine engines. This design is known as the Atlas Angel or Turbine Kudu.

In 1968 Macchi sold the rights to the aircraft to Northwest Industries of Edmonton, Alberta, Canada and the design was developed into the Northwest Ranger, with development continuing until 1972.

<text>Chan Chong Ming (born 16 February 1980) is a Malaysian former badminton player and a current head coach of Malaysian national women&#x27;s doubles squad. He is two-time Commonwealth Games gold medalists in the men&#x27;s doubles, winning the title in 2002 and 2006. Chan also won the men&#x27;s doubles bronze medals at the World Championships in 2001 and 2005; in the Asian Games in 2002; Asian Championships in 2004; and at the SEA Games in 2001 and 2005. He also helps the national team win the mixed team title at the Commonwealth Games in 2006, and the men&#x27;s team title at the SEA Games in 2001 and 2005. Chan reached a career high as world number 1 in the men&#x27;s doubles in April 2002.

== Career ==
Chan competed in badminton at the 2004 Summer Olympics with his then partner, Chew Choon Eng. In the first round, they defeated Theodoros Velkos and George Patis of Greece, but were then defeated in the round of 16 by Zheng Bo and Sang Yang of the China.

After his unsuccessful outing in the Olympic Games, Chan&#x27;s regular doubles partner was changed to Koo Kien Keat. Together, they claimed 2005 Denmark Open title. Chan Chong Ming and Koo Kien Keat won the Malaysia Open in 2006 which was held in Kuching, Sarawak and became the new hope for Malaysia in the men&#x27;s doubles. However, at the 2006 World Championships, they conceded a walkover due to Chan&#x27;s father&#x27;s death. In the Swiss Open, Chan and Koo defeated Carsten Mogensen and Mathias Boe in a thrilling 17–14, 8-15, and 17–14 final match. On the run up to the Doha Asian Games XV, Chan sustained an injury which prompted their coach, Rexy Mainaky, to split them, partnering Koo Kien Keat with Tan Boon Heong for the games instead. Chan and Koo&#x27;s partnership ended when Koo won the title with his new partner.

Chan&#x27;s partner was changed to Hoon Thien How who was Tan Boon Heong&#x27;s ex-partner. Chan and Hoon won the Kuala Lumpur Open at the end of 2006. Chan and Hoon Thien How won their first title in New Zealand after beating Johan Wiratama and Albertus Njoto of Hong Kong.

Chan paired again with Chew. In the late 2008, Chan established a company named Pioneer Sdn Bhd with Wong Choong Hann, Choong Tan Fook, Lee Wan Wah and Chew Choon Eng. They trained young players in the two centres in Kota Damansara and Bandar Mahkota Cheras. Chan married Janice Lee on 6 January 2008.

<text>Portage Township was one of the sixteen original townships in Summit County, Ohio. It was located in the middle of Summit County. It included the cities/towns of Akron and Cuyahoga Falls as well as an earlier part of Middlebury. Eventually, the township was absorbed by Akron and Cuyahoga Falls and ceased to exist.
When created, it was in area and included Survey Town 2, Range 11 in Western Reserve. The township derived its name from the Portage Path, which extends north to south through the middle of the township.

==Geography==
Portage Township lays between the other original townships of Copley, Northampton, Tallmadge, and Coventry. In time, several villages were established within Portage, including the village of Middlebury in the southeast, Akron in the south and Cuyahoga Falls in the northeast.

==History==

The first white settler who settled in Portage was Major Miner Spicer in 1810, in &quot;Spicertown&quot;, now located at the corner of Spicer and Carroll streets Ohio. The township was formally organized at a meeting held in the house of Warren H. Clark in 1838 with first offer:

* Trustees: Wm. B. Mitchell, Simon Perkins, Jr., George Babcock; Clerk, Horace K. Smith
* Treasurer, Samuel A. Wheeler.

In the early days, Portage Township was sparsely populated. Most of the land was titled to one landholder, Simon Perkins, and the land was not easily arable due to variable terrain.

The history of Portage Township is challenging to reconstruct, since it is often considered as an appendage to the town of Akron.

===Counties===
Portage Township&#x27;s land has been in the following counties:

<text>Charles Clifton Finch (April 4, 1927 – April 22, 1986) was an American politician who served as the 57th governor of Mississippi from 1976 to 1980.

== Early life ==
Finch was born on April 4, 1927 in the village of Pope in Panola County, Mississippi. He was the eldest of five children of Christine (McMinn) and Carl Finch. His parents were poor farmers. He was educated in Panola County schools and at the age of 18 he enlisted in the U.S. Army. During World War II and he served with the 88th Infantry Division in the Italian Campaign as a howitzer gunner. After the war, Finch returned home and attended a school for veterans. He purchased a truck and hauled logs until an economic downturn occurred. He then got a job operating heavy machinery for a construction company in Guam, while also working part-time as a barber. After fourteen months he returned to Mississippi and used his earnings to help his father rebuild his house, which had burned down. He passed General Educational Development tests and then enrolled at the University of Mississippi at Oxford in 1953. In 1958, he graduated from the University of Mississippi School of Law. During this time he worked variously as a campus police officer, bulldozer driver, dragline operator, and cotton measurer. He married Zelma Smith, a schoolteacher, on December 14, 1953. They had four children together.

== Early political career ==
Finch opened a law practice in Batesville after earning his law degree. He specialized in damage suits, and in time became very financially successful. In 1959 he was elected over eight opponents to the Mississippi House of Representatives, where he served from 1960 to 1964. During this time Finch supported racial segregation and backed Governor Ross Barnett&#x27;s efforts to preserve segregation in the state. In 1964 and again in 1968, he was elected district attorney for the Seventeenth Judicial District. In 1971, he was an unsuccessful candidate for lieutenant governor. Despite his loss, he continued to make appearances around the state.

== Gubernatorial career ==
=== Election ===
Finch ran for the office of Governor of Mississippi in 1975, facing William F. Winter and Maurice Dantin in the Democratic primary. Most political observers initially doubted Finch&#x27;s chances, and he placed far behind Winter in public polls. He cast himself as &quot;the workingman&#x27;s candidate&quot;; to do this, he used a lunch pail bearing his name as his campaign symbol and spent one day a week performing a blue collar job, including installing a car engine, pumping fuel, pricing groceries, and driving a bulldozer. He reasoned, &quot;When I sit down and open up my lunch box with that man or that woman who has been working side by side with me, sweating just like me, they know that I am sincere.&quot; His one major policy proposal was the creation of a Mississippi Internal Development Assistance System (MIDAS), which entailed coordinated action among state agencies to finance and supply workers to new industries, issue low-interest long-range loans to spur development, and increased marketing to attract outside investment. He shied away from journalists, not holding press conferences and avoiding television interviews.

Winter denounced Finch&#x27;s tactics as mere gimmicks, saying, &quot;I am convinced that the people do not want a clown or stuntman leading you for four years.&quot; Finch retorted, &quot;If they call them rednecks, clown, or whatever, then I&#x27;m proud to be one.&quot; Winter led the first primary with 36 percent of the vote, while Finch came second with 32 percent and Dantin placed third. Finch repeated his blue collar message in anticipation of the runoff, though Winter attacked him for lacking a substantive program. Winter suggested the two debate, but Finch declined, saying he was &quot;too busy to give Winter a platform.&quot; He also increased his outreach to black voters, greeting a winning Miss Black America contestant at the airport and running a television ad showing him speaking about his youth to a black man. In the runoff, Finch won with 58 percent of the vote—one of the largest victories ever in a gubernatorial runoff—taking 442,864 votes to Winter&#x27;s 324,749 votes.

The 1975 general election marked the first time in decades that the Republican Party offered a serious candidate for gubernatorial office, Gil Carmichael. A black politician, Henry J. Kirksey, also ran as an independent. Carmichael offered specific proposals and stances, while Finch largely ignored him and espoused vague and confused statements, such as describing himself as &quot;progressive, but conservative.&quot; The election was close, with Finch winning with just slightly more than half the vote; the margin was about 50,000 votes, and black voters proved key to his victory. In the same election, Evelyn Gandy won the lieutenant governorship, and Democrats retained control of the state legislature. Carmichael drew 47 percent of the vote, a high figure for a statewide Republican candidate at that time. Finch was inaugurated on January 20, 1976.

=== Executive action ===
In office, Finch held monthly &quot;work days&quot;, whereby he would perform menial jobs to keep in contact with constituents. As governor, he helped save Mississippi&#x27;s savings and loan industry from collapse, and provided flood relief after the 1979 Easter flood. During his tenure several people of minority status were elevated to positions of responsibility. He appointed the first black woman to the State College Board, selected a black man to lead the Governor&#x27;s Office of Minority Affairs, and expanded the Minority Affairs Council to include Chinese people, Choctaw Native Americans, and more African Americans. His actions to increase minority representation in government remained largely nominal; only seven percent of his first-year appointments went to African Americans.

Finch&#x27;s tenure was marred by scandals. A federal grand jury conducted a three-year-long investigation into his administration and several state agencies were accused of corruption and mismanagement. Finch was never found guilty of any wrongdoing, though some of his aides and appointees were indicted. His marital tensions also received media coverage, as it was rumored that he and his wife fought in the Governor&#x27;s Mansion. One rumor reported in the Jackson media suggested that Zelma shot Finch in the mansion during a heated debated about rumored affairs, though no evidence has ever been produced to substantiate the story. She eventually moved out, and Finch told the press that she was mentally ill. In 1979 his wife filed for divorce. By the end of his term, his approval ratings were the lowest among any Mississippi public official.

=== Legislative action ===
Many of Finch&#x27;s proposals, including a repeal of the state sales tax on food and drugs, were rebuffed by the legislature. He pushed for an amendment to the state constitution to allow for gubernatorial succession, provoking the ire of leading businessmen and legislators. He convinced the Senate to approve such an amendment but the measure was defeated in the House of Representatives. He signed the act which abolished the State Sovereignty Commission.

=== Political affairs ===
At the time Finch took office, the Mississippi Democratic Party was split into two factions: the Regulars and the Loyalists. The split traced back to the 1960s, when black Democrats created the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party to challenge segregationist delegations at Democratic National Conventions. The segregationists became the Regulars, while the integrated forces became the Loyalists. Attempts to reconcile the factions in the early 1970s had failed. Following his election, Finch pledged to reunite the two blocs. The factions reached a compromise, whereby a white Regular and a black Loyalist would serve together as co-chairs of the party executive committee.

While still governor, Finch ran for the United States Senate in 1978, but he was defeated in the Democratic party primary by Maurice Dantin, who then lost in the general election to the Republican U.S. Representative Thad Cochran. Some critics accused him of neglecting his gubernatorial responsibilities in favor of advancing his own career. He left gubernatorial office on January 22, 1980.

== Presidential campaign ==
After leaving office, Finch declared his candidacy in the 1980 Democratic presidential primaries against incumbent U.S. President Jimmy Carter. Entering the campaign shortly before the New Hampshire presidential primary, he failed to secure the 1,000 signatures needed before the filing deadline to have his name placed on the ballot and declared that he would be a write-in candidate. Garnering almost no national traction, he withdrew his candidacy in June.

== Later life ==
Finch resumed practicing law following his exit from politics. He died on April 22, 1986, at his law office in Batesville, Mississippi after a massive heart attack. He was subsequently buried at the Magnolia Cemetery in Batesville. Historian Chris Danielson wrote, &quot;The fusion of the white and black wings of the state Democratic Party was Finch&#x27;s greatest legacy. This action integrated and modernized the state Democrats and finally led to a shedding of the party&#x27;s segregationist past.&quot;

<text>Luluk Hadiyanto (born 8 June 1979) is a badminton player from Indonesia, specialized in men&#x27;s doubles and former world number one with doubles partner Alvent Yulianto.

==Early years==
&quot;Lulu&quot; as he is fondly called, was a member of badminton club PB Djarum. He was born in the small village of Pengkolrejo, in the district of Japah, Blora, Central Java. He was the first son of three siblings of the couple Edi Sunarto and Sulami, his parents both educators at an elementary school. His father encouraged both his sports career in Jakarta and his educational development in Solo. In 1999 he was finally accepted in the National Squad at the Pelatnas Cipayung.

==Career==
His first big international success came in 2001 winning the Thailand Open with Sigit Budiarto.
In partnership with fellow countryman Alvent Yulianto, Hadiyanto won four top tier international men&#x27;s doubles titles in 2004; the Thailand, Korea, Singapore, and Indonesia Opens. They achieved a number one world ranking that year despite a disappointing 2004 Olympics which saw them eliminated in the round of 16. Since 2004 Hadiyanto and Yulianto have struggled to achieve top form. Second place finishes in the quadrennial Asian Games (2006); and the Japan (2007) and Korea (2008) Opens (now called Super Series events) have been their highest finishes in major international tournaments, though they won the Indonesian national title in 2007. In 2006 they also won a bronze medal at the Asian Badminton Championships in Johor Bahru, Malaysia.

After a disappointing 21-19, 14-21, 14-21, first round loss against the Japanese Keita Masuda &amp; Tadashi Ohtsuka at the 2008 Olympics with Alvent Yulianto, the couple split partnership and Luluk left the National team of Indonesia. From 2009 Luluk Hadiyanto as an independent then first partnered Candra Wijaya and then more frequently Joko Riyadi. Still in men&#x27;s doubles Luluk Hadiyanto won his last big event, the 2009 Vietnam Open with new partner Joko Riyadi, seeded 7th beating 1st seeded Malaysian doubles pair Choong Tan Fook &amp; Lee Wan Wah 21-17, 22-20 in the semi-finals and then another Malaysian couple Hoon Thien How &amp; Ong Soon Hock in the final of this BWF Grand Prix event in straight games 21-19, 22-20. In 2010 Luluk Hadiyanto again formed a doubles combination with Candra Wijaya. In the middle of 2011 Luluk changed partnership one last time prior to retirement, he coupled up with fellow Indonesian Imam Sodikin Irawan.

<doc id="928041" wikidata="Q4720268" url="?curid=928041" title="Alexander Turney Stewart">
<text>Alexander Turney Stewart (October 12, 1803 – April 10, 1876) was an Irish- American entrepreneur who moved to New York and made his multimillion-dollar fortune in the most extensive and lucrative dry goods store in the world.

Stewart was born in Lisburn, Ulster, Ireland, and abandoned his original aspirations of becoming a Presbyterian minister to go to New York City in 1823. He spent a short time teaching before returning to Ireland to receive the money his grandfather had left him, purchase some Belfast linens and laces, and return to New York to open a store.

Stewart had extraordinary skill in business, and by 1846 he had built a large marble-fronted store on Broadway between Chambers Street and Reade Street, which was devoted to the wholesale branch of his business. In 1862 he built a new store covering an entire city block between Broadway and Fourth Avenue and between 9th and 10th streets. It was eight stories tall and attracted the wonder and business of upscale New York. Trainloads of wealthy customers from outlying cities came to shop.

Stewart made most of his money through wholesaling and especially New York City real estate. 
He opened branches of the company in other parts of the world and owned several mills and factories. He had an annual income of US$1,843,637 in 1863 (equivalent to $ million in ). His business success is estimated to have made him one of the twenty wealthiest people in history as of 2007, with a fortune equivalent to approximately US$90 billion in 2012.

==Early years==
Alexander Turney Stewart was born in Lisburn, Ireland, to Scottish Protestant parents on October 12, 1803. Three weeks after his birth, Stewart&#x27;s farmer father died of tuberculosis. About two years later Stewart&#x27;s mother remarried and followed her new husband to America, leaving Stewart behind to be raised by his grandfather, John Torney.

Torney wanted his only grandson to become a minister in the Church of Ireland. At age seven Stewart was sent to a village school, and in 1814 entered Mr. Neely&#x27;s English Academy. When Stewart&#x27;s grandfather died in 1816 he was brought into the home of Thomas Lamb, an Irish Quaker.

Upon completing his formal education at Belfast Academical Institution he wrote to his mother in New York City. While incubating a desire to move there, the fifteen-year-old Stewart was prevailed upon by Lamb to gain some business experience by earning money as a grocer in Belfast. Quickly wearying of the work, Stewart packed his bags in the spring of 1818 and left for New York with the $500 he had earned as a bag boy.

After six weeks at sea, Stewart arrived at his mother&#x27;s home. He became a $300-a-year tutor at Isaac N. Bragg&#x27;s Academy, a school for wealthy youths on Roosevelt Street, and joined an Episcopal church run by Reverend Edward Mitchell. There he met his future wife, Cornelia Mitchell Clinch, the daughter of Susannah Banker and James Clinch, a wealthy ship chandler. Cornelia&#x27;s brother Charles P. Clinch (1797–1880) was Acting Collector of the Port of New York.

==A. T. Stewart &amp; Co.==
Historians know little about Stewart&#x27;s life between 1818 and 1822, except that he returned to Ireland upon receiving his grandfather&#x27;s inheritance of value between US$5,000 and $10,000. The will pertaining to Stewart stated:

:I bequeath to my dear grandson ALEXANDER all the rest of my property, houses, and land, with the appurtenances thereto, stock, crop, and chattels of every kind. The money arising from the sale of the property devised to him to be subject to the payment by my said grandson ALEXANDER T. STEWART of an annuity to his grandmother, MARTHA STEWART, of three guineas a year during her life.

Upon returning to New York City in 1823, Stewart married Cornelia on October 16. Before marrying, Stewart opened his first store, located at 283 Broadway, which sold Irish fabrics and domestic calicos purchased with funds from his inheritance and earnings as a tutor.

The store opened on September 1, 1823, just across from City Hall Park, north of Chambers Street on the opposite side of Broadway from where his later Marble Palace was to stand. Rented for $375 a year, it measured 12.5 feet wide by 30 feet deep, rather small by today&#x27;s standards but average during the 19th century. A larger front section used for the business was divided by a thin wall from a smaller back section which served as Stewart&#x27;s residence.

Unlike other dry goods competitors located along Pearl Street, Stewart placed his store several blocks west on Broadway. He believed customers would travel to buy goods where they could most easily find the best prices, stating that the key to success was not where the store was placed, but rather where &quot;to obtain wholesale trade to undersell competitors&quot;.

When first opening the store, Stewart placed cases full of merchandise along the sidewalk in front of the store as a way of advertising his establishment. Stewart claimed that &quot;the messy clutter in front of the store and pushing crowds advertised the business.&quot;

As he rose to the top of the retail developers, Stewart included no signs on any place of his store and did not use any advertisements until May 13, 1831. He felt that anyone who wanted to shop in his store would &quot;know where it was located.&quot;

A natural salesman, Stewart realized that &quot;you will deal with ignorant, opinionated and innocent people. You will often have an opportunity to cheat them. If they could, they would cheat you, or force you to sell at less than cost. You must be wise, but not too wise. You must never actually cheat the customer, even if you can... You must make her happy and satisfied, so she will come back.&quot; Stewart held that the key to establishing a great business was to make friends with the customers and encourage their return, i.e., to focus on customer service.

Between 1845 and 1846, the construction and finishing details of one of Stewart&#x27;s most famous buildings, the &quot;Marble Palace&quot; at 280 Broadway, were completed. This establishment, &quot;the cradle of the department store&quot;, sent A. T. Stewart &amp; Company to the top of America&#x27;s most successful retailers.

The building, originally four stories over a ground floor supported on cast-iron Corinthian columns, survives at 280 Broadway at the corner of Chambers Street, just across from his first store. It offered imported European women&#x27;s clothing. In addition to its merchandise, the second floor offered the first women&#x27;s &quot;fashion shows&quot; as full-length mirrors enabled women to view themselves from different angles.

The Italianate design, faced with Tuckahoe marble, featured four floors of pedimented windows, the first commercial building in the United States to display an extravagant exterior. Inside, Stewart wanted not only to display his merchandise, but to emphasize natural light from the structure&#x27;s central rotunda and high ceilings.

&quot;The Marble Palace&quot; was the first &quot;big store&quot; that sold merchandise and was a huge financial success. In 1855 Stewart&#x27;s personal fortune was estimated to be $2.25 million. In 1856 Stewart expanded his merchandise to include furs, &quot;the best and most natural skins&quot;, as customers were told. In the 1850s, he also followed other retailers such as Macy&#x27;s, Lord and Taylor and B. Altman and Company to the area which was to be called &quot;Ladies&#x27; Mile&quot;, on Broadway and Sixth Avenue between 9th Street and 23rd Street.
However, in 1862, Stewart&#x27;s largest department store, referred to as the &quot;Iron Palace&quot;, was built. This six-story building, with its cast-iron front, glass dome skylight and grand emporium, employed up to 2,000 people. The immense structure occupied a major portion of a city block near Grace Church, from Broadway and Ninth Street to Tenth Street and Astor Place. The establishment&#x27;s nineteen departments included silks, dress goods, carpets, and toys.

By 1877 it had expanded to thirty departments, carrying a wide variety of items. As noted by &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;a man may fit up his house there down to the bedding, carpets and upholstery.&quot;

The Iron Palace building was taken over in 1882 by Hilton, Hughes &amp; Co. (who were associates of Stewart), then by Wanamaker&#x27;s department store in 1896, ultimately burning down in 1956. Drawings of the interior from the Hilton, Hughes era.

===Mail order business===
A. T. Stewart &amp; Company did not go unnoticed throughout the country. Along with his successful retail store in New York City, Stewart also established himself as one of the wealthiest men in the United States by allowing women all over the country to purchase and order items from his wholesale department store.

Beginning in 1868, Stewart began receiving letters from women in rural parts of the United States requesting his merchandise. Stewart promptly replied to these letters and orders by sending out the requested products and even paying the postage. Once their orders were received, women would send back the payment for them.

Seeing potential for the mail order business, by 1876 Stewart had hired twenty clerks to read, respond and mail out the entailed orders. That year he profited by over $500,000 from the mailing business alone. Stewart&#x27;s mail-order business&#x27; efficiency, convenience and profits gained so much attention from all over the country that other famous businesses such as Sears, Montgomery Ward and Spiegel&#x27;s followed in his footsteps.

==Defeated for Secretary of the Treasury==
In March 1869 President Ulysses S. Grant offered Stewart the position of Secretary of the Treasury (after Joseph Seligman had declined it), but he was not confirmed by the United States Senate. One impediment to Stewart&#x27;s appointment was a provision in the 1789 law which established the Treasury Department, prohibiting an importer from heading the Department. Grant requested the two houses of Congress to override the provision, but upon the objection of Charles Sumner, the request was not considered in the Senate. The main reason was that Republicans were angry with Stewart for supporting President Andrew Johnson, and for opposing high protective tariffs that the Republican Party promoted in its appeal to industry.

==Fifth Avenue mansion==
In 1869 and 1870 A. T. Stewart built the first of the grand Fifth Avenue palaces, on the northwest corner of 34th Street, across from the &quot;doyenne&quot; of New York society, Caroline Schermerhorn Astor. His architect, as for the store, was John Kellum. When all of Fifth Avenue was of brownstone rowhouses, Stewart&#x27;s fireproof structure in French Second Empire style was faced with marble.

It had three main floors and an attic in a mansard roof. A mezzanine floor at cornice height was used for storage. The house was separated from the sidewalks by a moat-like light well that lit the service areas in the basement. The main parlor ran the full length of the house&#x27;s Fifth Avenue frontage.

On the death of Stewart&#x27;s widow in 1886, it was rented as premises for the Manhattan Club and was portrayed in paint in 1891 by Childe Hassam. The structure was razed in 1901 to make way for the new premises of the Knickerbocker Trust Company. Elements from the Mansion were salvaged, and survive, incorporated into the structures of Our Lady of Lourdes Church (Manhattan) on 142nd Street and the Ross-Hand Mansion in Nyack.

==Central Railroad==
Stewart incorporated the Central Railroad of Long Island in 1871 and completed it in 1873, running from Long Island City through his development at Garden City to a brick yard at (Old) Bethpage and docks at Babylon. This became part of the Long Island Rail Road system in 1876, and the parts that have not been abandoned are the Hempstead Branch and Central Branch. The brickyard continued into existence until 1981, variously known as Bethpage Brickworks, Queens County Brick Manufacturing Company, and (after Nassau County split from Queens County in 1899) Nassau Brick Company.

==Death and influence==
Before Stewart died in 1876, he had succeeded in creating his own manufacturing facilities. He wanted to have his own mills to supply his wholesale and retail operations. With these mills, located in New York and New England, Stewart produced his own woolen fabrics and employed thousands of workers. Stewart also served on several New York State Chamber of Commerce Committees between 1862 and 1871. Though never elected as a New York State officer, he attended Lincoln&#x27;s funeral as a Chamber delegate.

Before his death he was building at Hempstead Plains, Long Island, the village of Garden City, with the purpose of affording his employees comfortable and airy housing at a moderate cost. After his death, his wife Cornelia erected several buildings in his memory, including St. Paul&#x27;s School and The Cathedral of the Incarnation, Garden City; the latter also served as a mausoleum to both Stewart and his wife.

Stewart died as one of the richest men in New York, just behind a Vanderbilt and an Astor. Worth an estimated $50 million, Stewart, unlike New York&#x27;s other wealthy men who made their millions through real estate, had earned his wealth in retail trade. Out of the twenty-four clerks who entered A. T. Stewart &amp; Company in 1836, six still worked for the company in 1876. To these long-term employees, Stewart showed his gratitude by leaving them more than $250,000 (equivalent to $ in ) in his will.

The body of Stewart was stolen from its tomb, between nine o&#x27;clock on the evening of November 6, and daylight on the morning of November 7, 1878, 2 years, 6 months, 24 days after his burial at St. Mark&#x27;s Church in-the-Bowery. The remains were held for $20,000 ransom. The ransom was paid and remains were returned, although never verified as his. A local legend states that the mausoleum holding his remains is rigged with security devices that will cause the bells of the Cathedral to ring if ever disturbed.

According to biographer Harry Resseguie, his vast fortune was soon lost. It:
Was either wasted in inept business ventures, poured into charities never contemplated by its owner, or frittered away in dissipation, luxurious living, or in fees to a swarm of lawyers during a quarter-century of litigation over the estate. 
The bulk of the Stewart fortune, willed to Mrs. Stewart with Judge Henry Hilton as trustee, was the subject of protracted litigation, although a swarm of long-lost Turney relatives were quickly dismissed. Claims were based in part on Mrs. Stewart&#x27;s hasty transfer of the dry goods business in 1876 to Hilton, in exchange for the $1,000,000 willed to Hilton, who carried on the business under the name E. J. Denning &amp; Co.

Mrs. Stewart, who lived quietly in New York and at the Grand Union Hotel in Saratoga Springs, New York, which she inherited, died of pneumonia October 25, 1886, and ex-Judge Hilton died there 24 August 1899.

In 1896, the Iron Palace was bought by John Wanamaker and reopened as &quot;Wanamaker&#x27;s&quot;. The Philadelphian Wanamaker had long been an admirer of Stewart and stated that one of his best qualities was his &quot;personal attention to the details of the business... He could have had others to look after the details — they have to be looked after, but few attend to sweeping up, and that&#x27;s what Stewart did.&quot; In 1917 the &quot;New York Sun&quot; newspaper bought Stewart&#x27;s Marble Palace for its main offices. In 1966 the building was designated a landmark by the City of New York.

===Posthumous libel===
On May 1, 1890, a notice appeared in the &quot;New York Times&quot; announcing Joseph Pulitzer, Julius Chambers, et al. had been indicted for posthumous criminal libel against Alexander T. Stewart. The newspaper reprinted a letter to District Attorney Fellows citing statements in an April 14–19 series of articles in the &quot;New York World&quot; accusing Stewart of &quot;a dark and secret crime&quot;, as the man who &quot;invited guests to meet his mistresses at his table&quot;, and as &quot;a pirate of the dry goods ocean.&quot;

<text>The , also commonly referred to simply as or , was an elite combat unit of the German Army () that fought on the Eastern Front in World War II.

Originally formed in 1921, it was known as the and served as a ceremonial guard unit and by the 1939 had grown into a regiment of the combined German armed forces. The regiment would later be expanded and renamed in 1942, and after significant reorganization was renamed in May 1943. In November 1944, while the division retained its status as a division, some of its subordinate units were expanded to divisional status, and the whole group of divisions were reorganized as .

==1939–1942==
The Infantry Regiment Grossdeutschland was activated on 14 June 1939. The regiment saw action in France in 1940, and took part in the invasion of Yugoslavia in April 1941. It was attached to Panzer Group 2 in the opening phases of Barbarossa, and was nearly destroyed in the Battle of Moscow in late 1941. On the last day of February 1942, the remnants of the regiment absorbed two battalions of reinforcements that arrived from Neuruppin and the regiment was reconstituted. It later moved to Orel, and on 1 April 1942 the former Infantry Regiment Großdeutschland was reinforced and expanded into the &quot;Infanterie-Division &quot;Großdeutschland&quot; (mot.)&quot; (motorized Infantry Division Grossdeutschland) using newly arrived troops from Germany.

The division was assigned to XXXXVIII Panzer Corps during the opening phases of Fall Blau, the Wehrmacht&#x27;s 1942 strategic summer offensive in southern Russia. During the combined Soviet winter offensives Operation Uranus and Operation Mars in late November through mid-December, the division fought near Rzhev, where it was rendered combat ineffective. By November 18, 1942, the division only had 7 Panzer II, 1 Panzer III, 19 Panzer IV, and 3 Sd.Kfz. 265 Panzerbefehlswagen operational. 

In January–February 1943, &quot;Großdeutschland&quot; and XXXXVIII Panzer Corps, along with the II SS Panzer Corps took part in the Third Battle of Kharkov. The division had 5 Panzer II, 20 Panzer III, 85 Panzer IV, 9 Tiger I, 2 Panzerbefehlswagen, and 26 Flammpanzer III available at that time. The division fought alongside the 1.SS Division &quot;Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler&quot;, 2. SS Division &quot;Das Reich&quot; and 3.SS Division &quot;Totenkopf&quot; during these battles. The division&#x27;s losses as total write-offs at that time amounted to 1 Panzer III, 12 Panzer IV, and 1 Tiger I. After the conquest of Kharkov, the &quot;Großdeutschland&quot; was again pulled back and refitted.

On 19 May 1943, with the addition of armoured personnel carriers and Tigers the division was redesignated &quot;Panzergrenadier Division Großdeutschland&quot; (Armored Infantry Division Grossdeutschland), though, in reality, it now had more armored vehicles than most full-strength panzer divisions.

==1943–1945==


The newly re-equipped division was subordinated to the XXXXVIII Panzer Corps, part of Fourth Panzer Army, and took part in the Battle of Kursk. During the buildup period, a regiment of two battalions were equipped with the new Panther tanks, which were plagued by technical problems, suffering from engine fires and mechanical breakdowns before reaching the battlefield. The division has 4 Panzer II, 23 Panzer III, 68 Panzer IV, 15 Tiger I, 8 command tanks, and 14 Flammpanzer III available. By 7 July, the division had only 80 of its 300 tanks still fit for combat. After the Kursk offensive was canceled, the division was transferred back to Army Group Center and resumed its role as a mobile reserve. The Tiger I tank company was expanded to a battalion, becoming the III. Battalion of the Panzer Regiment. Großdeutschland saw heavy fighting around Karachev before being transferred back to XLVIII Panzer Corps in late August. For the rest of 1943, &quot;Großdeutschland&quot; retreated across Ukraine, and in 1944 into Romania, where it took part in the First Battle of Târgu Frumos. By May 31, 1944, the division had 14 Panzer IV, 90 Panthers, and 40 Tiger I tanks. 

In early August, the division was transferred to East Prussia from Army Group South Ukraine. Over the next months, &quot;Großdeutschland&quot; was involved in heavy fighting in both East Prussia, including a counter-attack on Wilkowischken and the Baltic States, suffering high casualties in both men and materiel. The division was nearly destroyed during the battles in the Memel bridgehead.

In November 1944, while the division and several attached units were redesignated as &quot;Panzerkorps Großdeutschland&quot;. By March 1945, the Panzer Grenadier Division &quot;Großdeutschland&quot; had been reduced to around 4,000 men after the Battle of Memel. It had only 1 StuG III, 1 Panzer IV, 5 Panthers, and 6 Tiger I tanks by March 15, 1945. By 25 April 1945, the division was engaged in heavy fighting in the battles around Pillau. Eight hundred men of the division were evacuated on ferries via the Baltic Sea and surrendered to British forces in Schleswig-Holstein on May 9. The rest were either killed or captured during the fighting in Pillau or surrendered to Soviet forces on May 9 on the Vistula spit.

==War crimes==

During the battle of France, soldiers of the division perpetrated the summary executions of hundreds of Black prisoners of war in French service. These executions were racially motivated, as German troops had been conditioned by Nazi propaganda to see Black people as subhuman. In several instances, Black prisoners of war were separated from White ones and murdered by soldiers of the division, including on 10 June 1940, where 150 Black prisoners were massacred in Erquinvillers. Another mass killing committed by the division was the Chasselay massacre, where on 19 and 20 June hundreds of Black prisoners of war were murdered in Chasselay, Rhône.

===Reprisals===

The book &quot;German Army and Genocide&quot; mentions the following incident, from the invasion of Yugoslavia:

Part of the photographic presentation for the book includes a photo where the &quot;Großdeutschland&quot; cuff title on the officer is clearly visible. The subject of Grossdeutschland&#x27;s complicity in many subsequent war crimes in Russia and Ukraine, was the subject of the book by Omer Bartov &quot;The Eastern Front, 1941–45, German Troops, and the Barbarization of Warfare&quot; (1986, ).

Under existing international law at the time, reprisals were permitted though the Allied nations and Nazi Germany had differing interpretations of the law. In postwar war crimes trials, reprisal killings were deemed to be illegal, a conclusion enshrined in international law by the United Nations.

<text>Legends (aka VH1&#x27;s Legends) is a music biography television series on VH1. Originally sponsored by AT&amp;T Corporation, this series documents those artists (living or dead) who have made a significant contribution to music history to be profiled on the show (as opposed to VH1&#x27;s companion series, &quot;Behind the Music&quot;, which profiles mostly moderately significant artists).

The show goes in-depth into the entire career of the artist(s), with each episode containing rare concert and music video footage.

The initial episodes were narrated by Kris Kristofferson, however other narrators have included Sheryl Crow, Steven Tyler (of Aerosmith), Ossie Davis, Tate Donovan, Levon Helm, Henry Rollins, Charlie Rose, and James Justice. Recent episodes have been narrated by William Baldwin (husband of singer Chynna Phillips).

Tina Turner, Elton John, and John Lennon are the only artists so far to have been profiled on both &quot;Legends&quot; and &quot;Behind the Music&quot;.

<text>Saint-Gilles (; Provençal: &quot;Sant Geli&quot;; ) or Saint-Gilles-du-Gard is a commune in the Gard department in southern France.

It is the second most populous commune in the Nîmes metropolitan area.

==History==
The abbey of Saint-Gilles was founded during the seventh century traditionally by the hermit Saint Giles (Latin &quot;Ægidius&quot;), whose relics the abbey possessed. The commune formed around the nucleus of the abbey, which was the first stopping point for pilgrims bound for Santiago de Compostela in Spain, who were following the &quot;via Tolosana&quot; that led from Arles to Toulouse and crossed the Pyrenees to join other routes at Puente La Reina, thence to Santiago along the Via Compostelana. The former abbey church was listed in 1998 among the UNESCO World Heritage Sites, as part of the Routes of Santiago de Compostela in France. The abbey church&#x27;s west portal is among the most beautiful of the great Romanesque portals and a definitive example of the Provençal Romanesque. The church has three naves and a famed spiral staircase of cantilevered stone steps (in the now destroyed part of the church). During the French Wars of Religion the Protestants fortified themselves within the abbey, which was severely damaged.

The shrine of Saint Gilles, located in the crypt of the church, is the subject of pilgrimage in particular by women wishing to become pregnant or dealing with infertility.

Saint-Gilles was the birthplace of Guy Foulques, Pope Clement IV (died 1268), whose natal house is now a museum of the archaeology, ethnology and ornithology of the Camargue.

Saint-Gilles is more recently the birthplace of the author Georges-Jean Arnaud (born 1928).

==Geography==
Saint-Gilles is located at the northern edge of the &quot;Petite Camargue&quot;, between Arles (15 km) and Nîmes (16 km). With a land area of 153.73 km2 (59.355 sq mi), it is rather large by continental French standards, although many of the communes in this part of France are among the largest in area in Metropolitan France.

==Population==
==Transportation==
The Nîmes-Alès-Camargue-Cévennes Airport, sometimes called Garons Airport, is located on the territory of the commune.

<text>In differential topology, the jet bundle is a certain construction that makes a new smooth fiber bundle out of a given smooth fiber bundle. It makes it possible to write differential equations on sections of a fiber bundle in an invariant form. Jets may also be seen as the coordinate free versions of Taylor expansions.

Historically, jet bundles are attributed to Charles Ehresmann, and were an advance on the method (prolongation) of Élie Cartan, of dealing &quot;geometrically&quot; with higher derivatives, by imposing differential form conditions on newly introduced formal variables. Jet bundles are sometimes called sprays, although sprays usually refer more specifically to the associated vector field induced on the corresponding bundle (e.g., the geodesic spray on Finsler manifolds.)

Since the early 1980s, jet bundles have appeared as a concise way to describe phenomena associated with the derivatives of maps, particularly those associated with the calculus of variations. Consequently, the jet bundle is now recognized as the correct domain for a geometrical covariant field theory and much work is done in general relativistic formulations of fields using this approach.

==Jets==
Suppose &quot;M&quot; is an &quot;m&quot;-dimensional manifold and that (&quot;E&quot;, π, &quot;M&quot;) is a fiber bundle. For &quot;p&quot; ∈ &quot;M&quot;, let Γ(p) denote the set of all local sections whose domain contains &quot;p&quot;. Let be a multi-index (an &quot;m&quot;-tuple of non-negative integers, not necessarily in ascending order), then define:

:formula_1

Define the local sections σ, η ∈ Γ(p) to have the same &quot;r&quot;-jet at &quot;p&quot; if

:formula_2

The relation that two maps have the same &quot;r&quot;-jet is an equivalence relation. An &quot;r&quot;-jet is an equivalence class under this relation, and the &quot;r&quot;-jet with representative σ is denoted formula_3. The integer &quot;r&quot; is also called the order of the jet, &quot;p&quot; is its source and σ(&quot;p&quot;) is its target.

==Jet manifolds==
The &quot;r&quot;-th jet manifold of π is the set

:formula_4

We may define projections &quot;πr&quot; and &quot;π&quot;&quot;r&quot;,0 called the source and target projections respectively, by

:formula_5

If 1 ≤ &quot;k&quot; ≤ &quot;r&quot;, then the &quot;k&quot;-jet projection is the function &quot;πr,k&quot; defined by

formula_6

From this definition, it is clear that &quot;πr&quot; = &quot;π&quot; &quot;π&quot;&quot;r&quot;,0 and that if 0 ≤ &quot;m&quot; ≤ &quot;k&quot;, then &quot;πr,m&quot; = &quot;πk,m&quot; &quot;πr,k&quot;. It is conventional to regard &quot;πr,r&quot; as the identity map on &quot;J r&quot;(&quot;π&quot;) and to identify &quot;J&quot; 0(&quot;π&quot;) with &quot;E&quot;.

The functions &quot;πr,k&quot;, &quot;π&quot;&quot;r&quot;,0 and &quot;πr&quot; are smooth surjective submersions.

A coordinate system on &quot;E&quot; will generate a coordinate system on &quot;J r&quot;(&quot;π&quot;). Let (&quot;U&quot;, &quot;u&quot;) be an adapted coordinate chart on &quot;E&quot;, where &quot;u&quot; = (&quot;xi&quot;, &quot;uα&quot;). The induced coordinate chart (&quot;Ur&quot;, &quot;ur&quot;) on &quot;J r&quot;(&quot;π&quot;) is defined by

formula_7

where

formula_8

and the formula_9 functions known as the derivative coordinates:

formula_10

Given an atlas of adapted charts (&quot;U&quot;, &quot;u&quot;) on &quot;E&quot;, the corresponding collection of charts (&quot;U r&quot;, &quot;u r&quot;) is a finite-dimensional &quot;C&quot;∞ atlas on &quot;J r&quot;(&quot;π&quot;).

==Jet bundles==
Since the atlas on each formula_11 defines a manifold, the triples &quot;formula_12&quot;, &quot;formula_13&quot; and &quot;formula_14&quot; all define fibered manifolds. In particular, if &quot;formula_15&quot;is a fiber bundle, the triple &quot;formula_14&quot; defines the &quot;r&quot;-th jet bundle of π.

If &quot;W&quot; ⊂ &quot;M&quot; is an open submanifold, then

:formula_17

If &quot;p&quot; ∈ &quot;M&quot;, then the fiber formula_18 is denoted formula_19.

Let σ be a local section of π with domain &quot;W&quot; ⊂ &quot;M&quot;. The &quot;r&quot;-th jet prolongation of σ is the map formula_20 defined by

:formula_21

Note that formula_22, so formula_23 really is a section. In local coordinates, formula_23 is given by

:formula_25

We identify &quot;formula_26&quot; with formula_27 .

=== Algebro-geometric perspective ===
An independently motivated construction of the sheaf of sections formula_28&quot; is given&quot;.&quot;

Consider a diagonal map formula_29, where the smooth manifold formula_30 is a locally ringed space by formula_31 for each open formula_32. Let formula_33 be the ideal sheaf of formula_34, equivalently let formula_33 be the sheaf of smooth germs which vanish on formula_34 for all formula_37. The pullback of the quotient sheaf formula_38 from formula_39 to formula_30 by formula_41 is the sheaf of k-jets.

The direct limit of the sequence of injections given by the canonical inclusions formula_42 of sheaves, gives rise to the infinite jet sheaf formula_43. Observe that by the direct limit construction it is a filtered ring.

===Example===
If π is the trivial bundle (&quot;M&quot; × R, pr1, &quot;M&quot;), then there is a canonical diffeomorphism between the first jet bundle formula_44 and &quot;T*M&quot; × R. To construct this diffeomorphism, for each σ in formula_45 write formula_46.

Then, whenever &quot;p&quot; ∈ &quot;M&quot;

:formula_47

Consequently, the mapping

:formula_48

is well-defined and is clearly injective. Writing it out in coordinates shows that it is a diffeomorphism, because if &quot;(xi, u)&quot; are coordinates on &quot;M&quot; × R, where &quot;u&quot; = idR is the identity coordinate, then the derivative coordinates &quot;ui&quot; on &quot;J1(π)&quot; correspond to the coordinates ∂&quot;i&quot; on &quot;T*M&quot;.

Likewise, if π is the trivial bundle (R × &quot;M&quot;, pr1, R), then there exists a canonical diffeomorphism between formula_44and R × &quot;TM&quot;.

==Contact structure==
The space &quot;Jr&quot;(π) carries a natural distribution, that is, a sub-bundle of the tangent bundle &quot;TJr&quot;(π)), called the &quot;Cartan distribution&quot;. The Cartan distribution is spanned by all tangent planes to graphs of holonomic sections; that is, sections of the form &quot;jrφ&quot; for &quot;φ&quot; a section of π.

The annihilator of the Cartan distribution is a space of differential one-forms called contact forms, on &quot;Jr&quot;(π). The space of differential one-forms on &quot;Jr&quot;(π) is denoted by formula_50 and the space of contact forms is denoted by formula_51. A one form is a contact form provided its pullback along every prolongation is zero. In other words, formula_52 is a contact form if and only if
:formula_53
for all local sections σ of π over &quot;M&quot;.

The Cartan distribution is the main geometrical structure on jet spaces and plays an important role in the geometric theory of partial differential equations. The Cartan distributions are completely non-integrable. In particular, they are not involutive. The dimension of the Cartan distribution grows with the order of the jet space. However, on the space of infinite jets &quot;J∞&quot; the Cartan distribution becomes involutive and finite-dimensional: its dimension coincides with the dimension of the base manifold &quot;M&quot;.

===Example===
Consider the case &quot;(E, π, M)&quot;, where &quot;E&quot; ≃ R2 and &quot;M&quot; ≃ R. Then, &quot;(J1(π), π, M)&quot; defines the first jet bundle, and may be coordinated by &quot;(x, u, u1)&quot;, where

:formula_54

for all &quot;p&quot; ∈ &quot;M&quot; and σ in Γ&quot;p&quot;(π). A general 1-form on &quot;J1(π)&quot; takes the form

:formula_55

A section σ in Γ&quot;p&quot;(π) has first prolongation

:formula_56

Hence, &quot;(j1σ)*θ&quot; can be calculated as

:formula_57

This will vanish for all sections σ if and only if &quot;c&quot; = 0 and &quot;a&quot; = −&quot;bσ′(x)&quot;. Hence, θ = &quot;b(x, u, u1)θ0&quot; must necessarily be a multiple of the basic contact form θ0 = &quot;du&quot; − &quot;u1dx&quot;. Proceeding to the second jet space &quot;J2(π)&quot; with additional coordinate &quot;u2&quot;, such that

:formula_58

a general 1-form has the construction

:formula_59

This is a contact form if and only if

:formula_60

which implies that &quot;e&quot; = 0 and &quot;a&quot; = −&quot;bσ′(x)&quot; − &quot;cσ′′(x)&quot;. Therefore, θ is a contact form if and only if

:formula_61

where θ1 = &quot;du&quot;1 − &quot;u&quot;2&quot;dx&quot; is the next basic contact form (Note that here we are identifying the form θ0 with its pull-back formula_62 to &quot;J2(π)&quot;).

In general, providing &quot;x, u&quot; ∈ R, a contact form on &quot;Jr+1(π)&quot; can be written as a linear combination of the basic contact forms

:formula_63

where

:formula_64

Similar arguments lead to a complete characterization of all contact forms.

In local coordinates, every contact one-form on &quot;Jr+1(π)&quot; can be written as a linear combination

:formula_65

with smooth coefficients formula_66 of the basic contact forms

:formula_67

&quot;|I|&quot; is known as the order of the contact form formula_68. Note that contact forms on &quot;Jr+1(π)&quot; have orders at most &quot;r&quot;. Contact forms provide a characterization of those local sections of &quot;πr+1&quot; which are prolongations of sections of π.

Let ψ ∈ Γ&quot;W&quot;(&quot;πr+1&quot;), then &quot;ψ&quot; = &quot;jr+1&quot;σ where σ ∈ Γ&quot;W&quot;(π) if and only if formula_69

==Vector fields==
A general vector field on the total space &quot;E&quot;, coordinated by formula_70, is

:formula_71

A vector field is called horizontal, meaning that all the vertical coefficients vanish, if formula_72 = 0.

A vector field is called vertical, meaning that all the horizontal coefficients vanish, if &quot;ρi&quot; = 0.

For fixed &quot;(x, u)&quot;, we identify

:formula_73

having coordinates &quot;(x, u, ρi, φα)&quot;, with an element in the fiber &quot;TxuE&quot; of &quot;TE&quot; over &quot;(x, u)&quot; in &quot;E&quot;, called a tangent vector in &quot;TE&quot;. A section

:formula_74

is called a vector field on &quot;E&quot; with

:formula_75

and ψ in &quot;Γ(TE)&quot;.

The jet bundle &quot;Jr(π)&quot; is coordinated by formula_76. For fixed &quot;(x, u, w)&quot;, identify

:formula_77

having coordinates

:formula_78

with an element in the fiber formula_79 of &quot;TJr(π)&quot; over &quot;(x, u, w)&quot; ∈ &quot;Jr(π)&quot;, called a tangent vector in &quot;TJr(π)&quot;. Here,

:formula_80

are real-valued functions on &quot;Jr(π)&quot;. A section

:formula_81

is a vector field on &quot;Jr(π)&quot;, and we say formula_82

==Partial differential equations==
Let &quot;(E, π, M)&quot; be a fiber bundle. An &quot;r&quot;-th order partial differential equation on π is a closed embedded submanifold &quot;S&quot; of the jet manifold &quot;Jr(π)&quot;. A solution is a local section σ ∈ Γ&quot;W&quot;(π) satisfying formula_83, for all &quot;p&quot; in &quot;M&quot;.

Consider an example of a first order partial differential equation.

===Example===
Let π be the trivial bundle (R2 × R, pr1, R2) with global coordinates (&quot;x&quot;1, &quot;x&quot;2, &quot;u&quot;1). Then the map &quot;F&quot; : &quot;J&quot;1(π) → R defined by

:formula_84

gives rise to the differential equation

:formula_85

which can be written

:formula_86

The particular

:formula_87

has first prolongation given by

:formula_88

and is a solution of this differential equation, because

:formula_89

and so formula_90 for &quot;every&quot; &quot;p&quot; ∈ R2.

==Jet prolongation==
A local diffeomorphism &quot;ψ&quot; : &quot;Jr&quot;(&quot;π&quot;) → &quot;Jr&quot;(&quot;π&quot;) defines a contact transformation of order &quot;r&quot; if it preserves the contact ideal, meaning that if θ is any contact form on &quot;Jr&quot;(&quot;π&quot;), then &quot;ψ*θ&quot; is also a contact form.

The flow generated by a vector field &quot;Vr&quot; on the jet space &quot;Jr(π)&quot; forms a one-parameter group of contact transformations if and only if the Lie derivative formula_91 of any contact form θ preserves the contact ideal.

Let us begin with the first order case. Consider a general vector field &quot;V&quot;1 on &quot;J&quot;1(&quot;π&quot;), given by

:formula_92

We now apply formula_93 to the basic contact forms formula_94 and expand the exterior derivative of the functions in terms of their coordinates to obtain:

:formula_95

Therefore, &quot;V1&quot; determines a contact transformation if and only if the coefficients of &quot;dxi&quot; and formula_96 in the formula vanish. The latter requirements imply the contact conditions

:formula_97

The former requirements provide explicit formulae for the coefficients of the first derivative terms in &quot;V1&quot;:

:formula_98

where

:formula_99

denotes the zeroth order truncation of the total derivative &quot;Di&quot;.

Thus, the contact conditions uniquely prescribe the prolongation of any point or contact vector field. That is, if formula_100 satisfies these equations, &quot;Vr&quot; is called the r&quot;-th prolongation of &quot;V&quot; to a vector field on &quot;Jr(π).

These results are best understood when applied to a particular example. Hence, let us examine the following.

===Example===
Consider the case &quot;(E, π, M)&quot;, where &quot;E&quot; ≅ R2 and &quot;M&quot; ≃ R. Then, &quot;(J1(π), π, E)&quot; defines the first jet bundle, and may be coordinated by &quot;(x, u, u1)&quot;, where

:formula_101

for all &quot;p&quot; ∈ &quot;M&quot; and &quot;σ&quot; in Γ&quot;p&quot;(&quot;π&quot;). A contact form on &quot;J1(π)&quot; has the form

:formula_102

Consider a vector &quot;V&quot; on &quot;E&quot;, having the form

:formula_103

Then, the first prolongation of this vector field to &quot;J1(π)&quot; is

:formula_104

If we now take the Lie derivative of the contact form with respect to this prolonged vector field, formula_105 we obtain

:formula_106

Hence, for preservation of the contact ideal, we require

:formula_107

And so the first prolongation of &quot;V&quot; to a vector field on &quot;J1(π)&quot; is

:formula_108

Let us also calculate the second prolongation of &quot;V&quot; to a vector field on &quot;J2(π)&quot;. We have formula_109 as coordinates on &quot;J2(π)&quot;. Hence, the prolonged vector has the form

:formula_110

The contact forms are

:formula_111

To preserve the contact ideal, we require

:formula_112

Now, &quot;θ&quot; has no &quot;u&quot;2 dependency. Hence, from this equation we will pick up the formula for &quot;ρ&quot;, which will necessarily be the same result as we found for &quot;V1&quot;. Therefore, the problem is analogous to prolonging the vector field &quot;V1&quot; to &quot;J&quot;2(π). That is to say, we may generate the &quot;r&quot;-th prolongation of a vector field by recursively applying the Lie derivative of the contact forms with respect to the prolonged vector fields, &quot;r&quot; times. So, we have

:formula_113

and so

:formula_114

Therefore, the Lie derivative of the second contact form with respect to &quot;V2&quot; is

:formula_115

Hence, for formula_116 to preserve the contact ideal, we require

:formula_117

And so the second prolongation of &quot;V&quot; to a vector field on &quot;J&quot;2(π) is

:formula_118

Note that the first prolongation of &quot;V&quot; can be recovered by omitting the second derivative terms in &quot;V2&quot;, or by projecting back to &quot;J1(π)&quot;.

==Infinite jet spaces==
The inverse limit of the sequence of projections formula_119 gives rise to the infinite jet space &quot;J∞(π)&quot;. A point formula_120 is the equivalence class of sections of π that have the same &quot;k&quot;-jet in &quot;p&quot; as σ for all values of &quot;k&quot;. The natural projection π∞ maps formula_120 into &quot;p&quot;.

Just by thinking in terms of coordinates, &quot;J∞(π)&quot; appears to be an infinite-dimensional geometric object. In fact, the simplest way of introducing a differentiable structure on &quot;J∞(π)&quot;, not relying on differentiable charts, is given by the differential calculus over commutative algebras. Dual to the sequence of projections formula_122 of manifolds is the sequence of injections formula_123 of commutative algebras. Let&#x27;s denote formula_124 simply by formula_125. Take now the direct limit formula_126 of the formula_125&#x27;s. It will be a commutative algebra, which can be assumed to be the smooth functions algebra over the geometric object &quot;J∞(π)&quot;. Observe that formula_126, being born as a direct limit, carries an additional structure: it is a filtered commutative algebra.

Roughly speaking, a concrete element formula_129 will always belong to some formula_125, so it is a smooth function on the finite-dimensional manifold &quot;Jk&quot;(π) in the usual sense.

===Infinitely prolonged PDEs===
Given a &quot;k&quot;-th order system of PDEs &quot;E&quot; ⊆ &quot;Jk(π)&quot;, the collection &quot;I(E)&quot; of vanishing on &quot;E&quot; smooth functions on &quot;J∞(π)&quot; is an ideal in the algebra formula_125, and hence in the direct limit formula_126 too.

Enhance &quot;I(E)&quot; by adding all the possible compositions of total derivatives applied to all its elements. This way we get a new ideal &quot;I&quot; of formula_126 which is now closed under the operation of taking total derivative. The submanifold &quot;E&quot;(∞) of &quot;J&quot;∞(π) cut out by &quot;I&quot; is called the infinite prolongation of &quot;E&quot;.

Geometrically, &quot;E&quot;(∞) is the manifold of formal solutions of &quot;E&quot;. A point formula_120 of &quot;E&quot;(∞) can be easily seen to be represented by a section σ whose &quot;k&quot;-jet&#x27;s graph is tangent to &quot;E&quot; at the point formula_135 with arbitrarily high order of tangency.

Analytically, if &quot;E&quot; is given by φ = 0, a formal solution can be understood as the set of Taylor coefficients of a section σ in a point &quot;p&quot; that make vanish the Taylor series of formula_136 at the point &quot;p&quot;.

Most importantly, the closure properties of &quot;I&quot; imply that &quot;E&quot;(∞) is tangent to the infinite-order contact structure formula_137 on &quot;J∞(π)&quot;, so that by restricting formula_137 to &quot;E&quot;(∞) one gets the diffiety formula_139, and can study the associated Vinogradov (C-spectral) sequence.

==Remark==
This article has defined jets of local sections of a bundle, but it is possible to define jets of functions &quot;f: M&quot; → &quot;N&quot;, where &quot;M&quot; and &quot;N&quot; are manifolds; the jet of &quot;f&quot; then just corresponds to the jet of the section

:&quot;grf: M&quot; → &quot;M&quot; × &quot;N&quot;
:&quot;grf(p)&quot; = &quot;(p, f(p))&quot;

(&quot;grf&quot; is known as the graph of the function &quot;f&quot;) of the trivial bundle (&quot;M&quot; × &quot;N&quot;, π1, &quot;M&quot;). However, this restriction does not simplify the theory, as the global triviality of π does not imply the global triviality of π1.

Matão was first populated by coffee growers at the beginning of the 1890s. The settlers constructed a small chapel in 1894, and in 1895 called their settlement Senhor do Bom Jesus das Palmeiras. The settlement was renamed Matão in 1897 and became a district of Araraquara. It became an independent municipality on August 27, 1898. The region attracted more small-scale farmers in the 1890s, and development was furthered by the construction of a railroad line, the Estrada de Ferro Araraquara, which was built to connect Rio Claro, in São Paulo State, to Cuiabá, the capital city of Mato Grosso. The rail line reached Matão by 1899. The municipality comprised three districts, Matão, Dobrada and São Lourenço do Turvo, until 1964 when Dobrada became a separate municipality.

<text>Mountain whites were white Americans (usually poor) living in Appalachia and the inland region of the Antebellum South. They were generally small farmers, who inhabited the valleys of the Appalachian range from western Virginia spanning down to northern Georgia and northern Alabama.

==History==
They were often isolated from the rest of Southern society and civilization during the Antebellum South (1783–1861). Because of this, few owned slaves and many were more likely to be critical of slavery. As independent small farmers living on the harsh American frontier, their interests were starkly different from those of white Southerners that lived on commercial plantations or in large cities. They were also able to retain many of their customs, which they brought over from their European roots, that had long since died out.

Mountain whites generally despised the aristocratic structure found in much of the Deep South, where rich slave-owning planters controlled legislatures and stood as cultural heroes and figures for most southerners. During the Civil War, some communities of mountain whites were deeply split by those who identified with the Union and those who identified with the Confederacy. Pro-Union attitudes were likelier to prevail in the Upland South where mountain whites lived, where in the case of western Virginia, this sentiment was seen as one of the leading causes of West Virginia&#x27;s secession from the rest of the state. Voters in the mountain areas of Eastern Tennessee elected Republican Party members of Congress for since 1859, with the exception of four years.

Mountain whites also developed their own styles of music which borrowed from Scottish and Irish tradition as many were of Scots-Irish descent. The music of mountain whites contributed heavily to the formation of what would become bluegrass music.

==Identity==

People classified as &quot;Mountain whites&quot; during the time of the Antebellum South were noted for their impoverished conditions. They were also noted for putting cultural importance on folk magic, old European folk songs, and their unique dialect.

<doc id="928084" wikidata="Q17165126" url="?curid=928084" title="History of intersex surgery">
<text>The history of intersex surgery is intertwined with the development of the specialities of pediatric surgery, pediatric urology, and pediatric endocrinology, with our increasingly refined understanding of sexual differentiation, with the development of political advocacy groups united by a human qualified analysis, and in the last decade by doubts as to efficacy, and controversy over when and even whether some procedures should be performed.

Prior to the medicalization of intersex, Canon and common law referred to a person&#x27;s sex as male, female or hermaphrodite, with legal rights as male or female depending on the characteristics that appeared most dominant. The foundation of common law, the &quot;Institutes of the Lawes of England&quot; described how a hermaphrodite could inherit &quot;either as male or female, according to that kind of sexe which doth prevaile.&quot; Single cases have been described by legal cases sporadically over the centuries. Diodorus Siculus is the first to record medical procedures associated with intersex gender affirmation surgery in his account of the life of Callon of Epidaurus. Modern ideas of medicalization of intersex and birth defects can be traced to French anatomist Isidore Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire (1805–1861), who pioneered the field of teratology.

Since the 1920s, surgeons have attempted to &quot;fix&quot; an increasing variety of conditions. Success has often been partial and surgery is often associated with minor or major, transient or permanent complications. Techniques in all fields of surgery are frequently revised in a quest for higher success rates and lower complication rates. Some surgeons, well aware of the immediate limitations and risks of surgery, feel that significant rates of imperfect outcomes are no scandal (especially for the more severe and disabling conditions). Instead they see these negative outcomes as a challenge to be overcome by improving the techniques. Genital reconstruction evolved within this tradition. In recent decades, nearly every aspect of this perspective has been called into question, with increasing concern regarding the human rights implications of medical interventions.

== Surgical pioneering and constructed gender ==
In the Byzantine Empire &quot;reconstructive&quot; surgeries on intersex people were performed at least from the seventh century on, in Alexandria possibly as early as the 2nd century. Paul of Aegina (c. 625 – c. 690), quoting Leonidas (Alexandria, 2nd – 3rd centuries), describes in section LXIX (On Hermaphrodites) of his sixth book four types of intersex and how to &quot;cure&quot; three of them by surgically removing the &quot;useless parts&quot;. In the next section (LXX, On Extirpation of the Nympha and Cauda Pudendi) he deals with clitoromegaly and how to remove the enlarged clitoris.

In 1779, in England, a seven-year-old intersex child, initially assigned female, underwent the first recorded surgery during modern times, resulting in their reassignment as male.

In the United States genital reconstructive surgery was pioneered between 1930 and 1960 by urologist Hugh Hampton Young and other surgeons at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore and other major university centers. Understanding of intersex conditions was relatively primitive, based on identifying the type of gonad(s) by palpation or by surgery. Since ability to determine even the type of gonads in infancy was limited, sex of assignment and rearing were determined mainly by the appearance of the external genitalia. Most of Young&#x27;s intersex patients were adults willingly seeking his help with physical problems of genital function.

Demand for surgery increased dramatically with better understanding of the condition congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) and availability of a new treatment (cortisone) by Lawson Wilkins, Frederick Bartter and others around 1950. For the first time, virilized infants with this variation were surviving and could be operated upon. A conflation was then established between life-saving treatment and cosmetic surgeries. Hormone assays and karyotyping to ascertain sex chromosomes, and the availability of testosterone for treatment led to partial understanding of androgen insensitivity syndrome. Within a decade, most intersex cases could be accurately diagnosed and their future development predicted with some degree of confidence.

As the number of children with intersex conditions referred to Lawson Wilkins&#x27; new pediatric endocrinology clinic at Hopkins increased, it was recognized that doctors &quot;couldn&#x27;t tell by looking&quot; at the external genitalia, and many errors of diagnosis based on outward appearance had led to anomalous sex assignments. Although it seems obvious now that a doctor could not announce to an eight-year-old boy and his parents that &quot;we have just discovered that you are &#x27;really&#x27; a girl, with female chromosomes, and ovaries and uterus inside, and we recommend that you change your sex to match your chromosomes and internal organs,&quot; a few such events occurred around the world as doctors and parents tried to make use of new information.

Genital reconstructive surgery at that time was primarily performed on older children and adults. In the early 1950s, it consisted primarily of the ability to remove an unwanted or nonfunctional gonad, to bring a testis into a scrotum, to repair a milder chordee or to change the position of the urethra in hypospadias, to widen a vaginal opening, and to remove a clitoris.

John Money, a pediatric clinical psychologist in the new &quot;Psychohormonal Research Unit&quot; at Hopkins, and his partners, John and Joan Hampson, analyzed these assignments and reassignments in an attempt to learn the timing and sources of gender identity. In most of these patients, gender identity seemed to follow the sex of assignment and sex of rearing more closely than it did genes or hormones. This apparent primacy of social learning over biology became part of the intellectual underpinning of the feminist movement of the 1960s. In its application to children with intersex conditions, this thesis that sex was a many-faceted social construction changed the management of ambiguous genitalia from &quot;determination of the baby&#x27;s real sex&quot; (by checking gonads or chromosomes) to &quot;determination of what sex should be assigned&quot;.

The most common intersex surgery offered in childhood was amputation of the clitoris and widening of the vaginal opening to make the genitals of a girl with CAH appear more conformed to the expectations. However, by the late 1950s surgical techniques for transforming assigned male at birth patients to their preferred genitals were being developed in response to requests for such surgery from transgender patients.

==Rise of infant surgery and &quot;nurture over nature&quot;==
By the 1960s, the young specialties of pediatric surgery and pediatric urology at children&#x27;s hospitals were universally admired for bringing infant birth defect surgery to new levels of success and safety. These specialized surgeons began to repair wider varieties of birth defects at younger ages with better results. Earlier correction reduced the social &quot;differentness&quot; of a child with a cleft lip, or club foot, or skull malformation, or could save the life of an infant with spina bifida.

Genital corrective surgeries in infancy were justified by (1) the belief that genital surgery is less emotionally traumatic if performed before the age of long-term memory, (2) the assumption that a firm gender identity would be best supported by genitalia that &quot;looked the part,&quot; (3) the preference of parents for an &quot;early fix,&quot; and (4) the observation of many surgeons that connective tissue, skin, and organs of infants heal faster, with less scarring than those of adolescents and adults. However, one of the drawbacks of surgery in infancy was that it would be decades before outcomes in terms of adult sexual function and gender identity could be assessed.

In North American and European societies, the 1960s saw the beginning of the &quot;sexual revolution&quot;, characterized by increased public interest and discussion about sexuality, recognition of the value of sexuality in people&#x27;s lives, the separation of sexuality from reproduction by increasing availability of contraception, the lessening of many social barriers and inhibitions related to sexual behavior, and social acknowledgment of women&#x27;s sexuality. In this era, genes and hormones were thought not to have a strong influence on any aspect of human psychosexual development, gender identity, or sexual orientation.

The 1970s and 1980s were perhaps the decades when surgery and surgery-supported sex reassignment were most uncritically accepted in academic opinion, in most children&#x27;s hospitals, and by society at large. In this context, enhancing the ability of people born with abnormalities of the genitalia to engage in &quot;normal&quot; heterosexual intercourse as adults assumed increasing importance as a goal of medical management. Many felt that a child could not become a happy adult if his penis was too small to insert in a vagina, or if her vagina was too small to receive a penis.

By 1970, surgeons still considered it easier to &quot;dig a hole&quot; than &quot;build a pole&quot;, but had abandoned &quot;barbaric&quot; clitorectomies in favor of &quot;nerve sparing&quot; clitoral recession and promised orgasms when the girls grew up. Pediatric endocrinology, surgery, child psychology, and sexuality textbooks recommended sex reassignment for a male whose penis was irreparably malformed or &quot;too small to stand to urinate or penetrate a vagina,&quot; because the surgeons claimed to be able to construct vaginas where none existed. The majority of these genetic males who were reassigned and surgically converted had cloacal exstrophy-type malformations or extreme micropenis (typically less than 1.5 cm).

In 1972 John Money published his influential text on the development of gender identity, and reported successful reassignment at age 22 months of a boy (David Reimer) who had lost his penis to a surgical accident. This experiment proved not to be as successful as Money claimed. David Reimer grew up as a girl, but never identified as one. Academic sexologist Milton Diamond later reported that Reimer failed to identify as female since the age of 9 to 11, making the transition to living as a male at age 15. The specific case of David Remier and his rejection of female gender identity despite being socialized and medicalized as a girl showed gender identity as inherent to a person. The surgeries and hormone replacement on David Remier caused the development of gender dysphoria. Reimer later went public with his story to discourage similar medical practices. He later died by suicide, owing to suffering years of severe depression, financial instability, and a troubled marriage.

==Complications arise==

Throughout the 1980s pediatric surgery textbooks recommended female assignment and feminizing reconstructive surgery for XY infants with a severely inadequate phallus. Nevertheless, in the 1980s several factors began to induce a decline in the frequency of certain types of genital surgery. Pediatric endocrinologists had realized that some boys with micropenis had deficiency of growth hormone which could be improved with hormones rather than surgery, and over the next decade a couple of reports suggested adult outcome as males was not as bad as expected for the boys with micropenis who had not had surgery. Although textbooks were slower to reflect the change, few reassignment surgeries for isolated micropenis were carried out by the 1990s.

In the 1980s research in both animals and humans began to provide evidence that sex hormones play an important role in early life in promoting or constraining adult sex-dimorphic sexual behavior and even gender identity. Examples of apparent androgen determination of gender identity in XY people with 5-alpha-reductase deficiency in the Dominican Republic had been published, along with reports of masculinized behavior in girls with congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH), and unsatisfactory sexual outcomes in adult women with CAH. Many endocrinologists were becoming skeptical that reassignment of genetic males to females was just a matter of learning and appearance, or that the newer clitoral reductions would be more successful than clitoral recessions.

However, feminizing reconstructive surgery continued to be recommended and performed throughout the 1990s on most virilized infant girls with CAH, as well as infants with ambiguity due to androgen insensitivity syndrome, gonadal dysgenesis, and some XY infants with severe genital birth defects such as cloacal exstrophy. Masculinizing reconstructive surgery continued on boys with severe hypospadias and the other conditions outlined above, with continued modifications and refinements intended to reduce unsatisfactory outcomes.

==Patient advocacy groups speak up==

By 1990, biological factors were being reported for a wide variety of human behaviors and personality characteristics. The idea that culture accounted for all the differences between men and women seemed as obsolete as psychotherapy for homosexuality.

A more abrupt and sweeping re-evaluation of reconstructive genital surgery began about 1993, triggered by a combination of factors. One of the major factors was the rise of patient advocacy groups that expressed dissatisfaction with several aspects of their own past treatments. The Intersex Society of North America was the most influential and persistent, and advocated postponing genital surgery until a child is old enough to display a clear gender identity and consent to the surgery. Recommendations from these voices ranged from the unexceptionable (ending shame and secrecy, and providing more accurate information and counseling) to the radical (assigning a third sex or no sex at all to intersex infants). The idea that possession of abnormal genitalia in and of itself does not constitute a medical crisis was stressed. The claims of advocacy groups have been resisted. In response to a demonstration by members of the Intersex Society of North America outside the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics in October 1996, the academy issued a press statement stating that:
In addition to ignoring patients&#x27; voices, physicians involved in intersex care had embarrassingly little long-term outcome data to support their claims. In 1997 a patient account was published which could not be ignored. David Reimer&#x27;s tragic story, told in both popular and medical publications, was widely interpreted by the public and many physicians as a cautionary tale of medical hubris, of the folly of attempting to foil nature with nurture, of the importance of early hormones on brain development, and the risks and limitations of surgery. Some clinicians proposed a moratorium on pediatric sex reassignment, particularly of undervirilized males as females, due to a lack of data that rearing or appearance of genitalia play a major part in gender identity development. Those clinicians encouraged delaying surgery until elected by adolescents to preserve sexual sensitivity.

Similar controversy occurred in Europe and Latin America. In 1999 Colombia&#x27;s constitutional court limited the ability of parents to consent to genital surgery for infants with intersex conditions. A number of advocacy groups argue against many forms of genital surgery in childhood. In 2001, British surgeons argued for deferring vaginoplasty until adulthood on grounds of poor outcomes for women who were operated on as infants.

==Outcomes and evidence==

A 2004 paper by Heino Meyer-Bahlburg and others examined outcomes from early surgeries in individuals with XY variations, at one patient centre. The study has been used to support claims that &quot;‘the majority of women...have clearly favored genital surgery at an earlier age&quot; but the study was criticized by Baratz and Feder for neglecting to inform respondents that:
In 2006, an invited group of clinicians met in Chicago and reviewed clinical evidence and protocols, argued that and adopted a new term for intersex conditions: &quot;Disorders of sex development&quot; (DSD). More specifically, these terms refer to &quot;congenital conditions in which development of chromosomal, gonadal, or anatomical sex is atypical.&quot; The term has been controversial and not widely adopted outside clinical settings: the World Health Organization and many medical journals still refer to intersex traits or conditions. Academics like Georgiann Davis and Morgan Holmes, and clinical psychologists like Tiger Devore argue that the term DSD was designed to &quot;reinstitutionalise&quot; medical authority over intersex bodies.

On surgical rationales and outcomes, the &quot;Consensus Statement on Intersex Disorders and their Management&quot; stated that:
Data presented in recent years suggests that little has changed in practice. Creighton and others in the UK have found that there have been few audits of the implementation of the 2006 statement, clitoral surgeries on under-14s have increased since 2006, and &quot;recent publications in the medical literature tend to focus on surgical techniques with no reports on patient experiences&quot;. A 2014 civil society submission to the World Health Organization cited data from a large German &quot;Netzwerk DSD/Intersexualität&quot; study:
A 2016 Australian study of persons born with atypical sex characteristics found that &quot;strong evidence suggesting a pattern of institutionalised shaming and coercive treatment of people&quot;. Large majorities of respondents opposed standard clinical protocols.

A 2016 follow-up to the 2006 Consensus Statement, termed a &quot;Global Disorders of Sex Development Update&quot; stated, 
A 2016 paper on &quot;Surgery in disorders of sex development (DSD) with a gender issue&quot; repeated many of the same claims, but without reference to human rights norms. A commentary to that article by Alice Dreger and Ellen Feder criticized that omission, stating that issues have barely changed in two decades, with &quot;lack of novel developments&quot;, while &quot;lack of evidence appears not to have had much impact on physicians&#x27; confidence in a standard of care that has remained largely unchanged.&quot; Another 2016 commentary stated that the purpose of the 2006 Consensus Statement was to validate existing practices, &quot;The authoritativeness and &quot;consensus&quot; in the Chicago statement lies not in comprehensive clinician input or meaningful community input, but in its utility to justify any and all forms of clinical intervention.&quot;

== Recent developments ==

Institutions like the Swiss National Advisory Commission on Biomedical Ethics, the Australian Senate, the Council of Europe, World Health Organization, and UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights and Special Rapporteur on Torture have all published reports calling for changes to clinical practice and an end to harmful practices.

In 2011, Christiane Völling won the first successful case brought against a surgeon for non-consensual surgical intervention. The Regional Court of Cologne, Germany, awarded her €100,000.

In April 2015, Malta became the first country to recognize a right to bodily integrity and physical autonomy, and outlaw non-consensual modifications to sex characteristics. The Act was widely welcomed by civil society organizations.

In 2017, Human Rights Watch and Interact Advocates for Intersex Youth published a report documenting the negative effects of medically unnecessary surgeries on intersex children in the US, as well as the pressure placed on parents to consent to the operations without full information. California State Legislature passed a resolution condemning the practice in 2018.

The same year, Amnesty International published a report on the situation of intersex persons in Denmark and Germany and launched a campaign for intersex human&#x27;s rights: &quot;First, Do No Harm: ensuring the rights of children born intersex&quot;.

On July 28, 2020, Lurie Children&#x27;s Hospital became the first children&#x27;s hospital in the United States to cease medically unnecessary, cosmetic surgery on intersex infants and publicly apologize to past intersex individuals harmed by such surgeries.

<text>Reservoir State Park is a state park located in the town of Lewiston in Niagara County, New York, United States. The park is situated on the south shore of the Robert Moses Power Plant Reservoir, north of the city of Niagara Falls.

==Park description==
Reservoir State Park is situated within the boundaries of the Robert Moses Niagara Hydroelectric Power Plant property. The park is owned and financially supported by the New York Power Authority and operated by the New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation.

The park offers picnic tables with pavilions, a playground, a nature trail, hiking, biking, fishing, cross-country skiing, sledding, snowmobiling, and fields for model airplane flying. There is a 150 yd long field that can be used as a golf driving range. The park also includes three tennis courts, eight softball diamonds, two basketball courts, and a roller hockey court.

A $6 million improvement project, funded by the New York Power Authority under an agreement with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, was completed at the park in 2012. The project focused on refurbishing many of the park&#x27;s sports fields, improving accessibility at the park&#x27;s playground, and constructing a warming hut near the sledding hill.

<text>Fu Haifeng (born 23 August 1983) is a Chinese badminton player.

==Sport career==
Combining Fu Haifeng&#x27;s impressive power with his regular partner Cai Yun&#x27;s impressive speed, Cai and Fu have been one of the world&#x27;s leading men&#x27;s doubles teams since 2004. They have won numerous top tier events on the world circuit including the venerable All England Open Championships in 2005 and 2009 and the BWF World Championships in 2006, 2009, 2010 and 2011. Cai and Fu have helped China win five consecutive Thomas Cup (Men&#x27;s Team World Badminton Championships) (2004, 2006, 2008, 2010, and 2012) and four consecutive Sudirman Cup (World Team Championships) (2005, 2007, 2009 and 2011). Cai and Fu also competed together in the Olympic games 3 times, including the 2004, the 2008 Olympic Games and the 2012 Olympic Games. They were eliminated in the quarterfinals in 2004 in Athens, and in 2008 in Beijing were silver medalists, losing a close final to Indonesia&#x27;s Markis Kido and Hendra Setiawan.

At the 2010 BWF World Championships in Paris, they—being the fifth seed—beat the third seed Danish pair Mathias Boe and Carsten Mogensen 21–11, 21–18 in the quarterfinals. In the semifinals, they defeated the second seed Indonesian Olympic Champions Markis Kido and Hendra Setiawan 21–16, 21–13. In the finals, they overcame the first seed and Malaysian world no. 1 Koo Kien Keat and Tan Boon Heong 18–21, 21–18, 21–14 to win the world title for the 3rd time. They are the first Men&#x27;s Doubles pair to achieve this feat.

Cai and Fu went on to win the China Masters Super Series. Being the fifth seed, they first defeated their second seed compatriots Xu Chen and Guo Zhendong 21–11, 21–16 in the quarterfinals. In the semifinals, they made a great comeback against the third seed South Korean rival Lee Yong-dae and Jung Jae-sung 20–22, 21–13, 21–17. Cai and Fu then clinched their second China Masters title by defeating the fourth seed South Korean pair Yoo Yeon-seong and Ko Sung-hyun in 2 sets 21–14, 21–19. Cai and Fu won their third title in a row by winning the Yonex Japan Open Super Series. They, being the fifth seed, beat the young Korean Pair Cho Gun-woo and Kwon Yi-goo 21–14, 16–21, 21–12 in the quarterfinals. In the semifinals, they defeated their promising compatriots Zhang Nan and Chai Biao 21–17, 21–16. In the finals, they made a great comeback again against the first seed and Malaysian world no. 1 Koo Kien Keat and Tan Boon Heong 18–21, 21–14, 21–12 to win their first Japan Open title.

At the 2012 Summer Olympics, they defeated Denmark&#x27;s Mathias Boe and Carsten Mogensen in the final to win the gold medal.

Having had 1 Olympic gold medal and 4 World Championship titles, as well as many other titles, Cai and Fu are one of the most successful men&#x27;s doubles pair in badminton history.

An ancillary badminton achievement of Fu is that while competing in the 2005 Sudirman Cup, one of his smashes was clocked at 332 km/h (206 mph), the fastest propulsion of a shuttle on record. Fu also fired a 303 km/h smash during game 3 of the 2010 BWF World Championships men&#x27;s doubles final, which was confirmed by the commentator Gillian Clark as the fastest of the tournament. The fastest smash by Fu during the 2011 Sudirman Cup final was clocked at 291 km/h.

In 2014, Fu played with mixed doubles champion Zhang Nan in the All England Super Series. They lost to the Indonesian pair Muhammad Ahsan and Hendra Setiawan in the quarter finals 21-23 20–22. Later on it, they took revenge at Denmark Open Super Series, and became the champion after beating top seed Korean pair Lee Yong-dae and Yoo Yeon-seong in 2 straight sets in the final.

In 2015, his partnership with Zhang Nan was stable after reaching several Super Series Finals such as Singapore Open, Indonesia Open, Japan Open, All England as runners-up.

In 2016, they won the Singapore Open Super Series after beating the top seed from Korea Lee/Yoo in 2 straight sets at semi final. Their performance later in several Super Series was not so climatic. They were seeded 4th in the Olympic Games in Rio, as Fu claimed his second gold medal in men&#x27;s doubles category after beating Malaysian&#x27;s pair Tan/Goh in 3 sets. He ends his career having reached 3 consecutive finals in the Olympic Games with two different partners, winning gold twice.

<doc id="928111" wikidata="Q6904489" url="?curid=928111" title="Montauk Point State Park">
<text>Montauk Point State Park is a state park located in the hamlet of Montauk, at the eastern tip of Long Island in the Town of East Hampton, Suffolk County, New York. Montauk Point is the easternmost extremity of the South Fork of Long Island, and thus also of New York State.

==History==
The park contains the Montauk Point Light, which was authorized by the Second Congress, under President George Washington in 1792. Construction began on June 7, 1796 and was completed on November 5, 1796. The lighthouse and adjacent Camp Hero were heavily fortified with huge guns during World War I and World War II. Those gun emplacements and concrete observation bunkers (which are also at nearby Shadmoor State Park and Camp Hero State Park) are still visible.

&quot;Amistad&quot;, a Spanish ship taken over by slaves in 1839, was captured by &quot;Washington&quot; near Montauk Point. The slaves were allowed to briefly disembark here before being re-imprisoned and taken to New London, Connecticut for trial. The Amistad case was heard before the Supreme Court of the United States, where John Quincy Adams successfully argued that the slaves had been kidnapped. Following the trial, the slaves were permitted to return to Africa. The case fanned the debate over the abolition of slavery.

==Park description==
Montauk Point State Park features picnic tables, a food concession, playground, fishing, seasonal hunting, and trails for hiking and cross-country skiing.

Suffolk Transit&#x27;s S94 route also serves the park seasonally connecting it with Montauk Village. The park is located at the end of New York State Route 27.

==In Literature==
A memory of this district is related in Lydia Sigourney&#x27;s poem , published in her &quot;Scenes in my Native Land&quot;, 1845.

On 1 July 2010, it was announced that DTCC had acquired all of the shares of Avox Limited, based in Wrexham, North Wales. Deutsche Börse had previously held over 76% of the shares. On 20 March 2017, it was announced that Thomson Reuters acquired Avox.

DTCC entered into a joint venture with the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) known as New York Portfolio Clearing, that would allow &quot;investors to combine cash and derivative positions in one clearinghouse to lower margin costs&quot;.

DTCC supported the Customer Protection and End User Relief Act (H.R. 4413; 113th Congress), arguing that it would &quot;help ensure that regulators and the public continue to have access to a consolidated and accurate view of the global marketplace, including concentrations of risk and market exposure&quot;.

DTCC collateral requirements for brokerages created difficulty for users during the GameStop short squeeze.

In reaction to the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, on March 3, 2022, DTCC blocked Russian securities from the Bank of Russia and The Ministry of Finance of the Russian Federation.

==Operations==

===DTC===
The Depository Trust Company (DTC) was the original securities depository.

Established in 1973, it was created to reduce costs and provide efficiencies by immobilizing securities and making &quot;book-entry&quot; changes to show ownership of the securities. DTC moves securities for NSCC&#x27;s net settlements, and settlement for institutional trades (which typically involve money and securities transfers between custodian banks and broker-dealers), as well as money market instruments. In 2022, DTC processed $2.5 quadrillion in transactions. In addition to settlement services, DTC retains custody of 3.5 million securities issues valued at $87.1 trillion, including securities issued in the United States and more than 170 other countries. DTC is a member of the U.S. Federal Reserve System, and a registered clearing agency with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Most large U.S. broker-dealers and banks are full DTC participants, meaning that they deposit and hold securities at DTC. DTC appears in an issuer&#x27;s stock records as the sole registered owner of securities deposited at DTC. DTC holds the deposited securities in &quot;fungible bulk&quot;, meaning that there are no specifically identifiable shares directly owned by DTC participants. Rather, each participant owns a pro rata interest in the aggregate number of shares of a particular issuer held at DTC. Correspondingly, each customer of a DTC participant, such as an individual investor, owns a pro rata interest in the shares in which the DTC participant has an interest.

Because the securities held by DTC are for the benefit of its participants and their customers (i.e., investors holding their securities at a broker-dealer), frequently the issuer and its transfer agent must interact with DTC in order to facilitate the distribution of dividend payments to investors, to facilitate corporate actions (i.e., mergers, splits, etc.), to effect the transfer of securities, and to accurately record the number of shares actually owned by DTC at all times.

===NSCC===

The National Securities Clearing Corporation (NSCC) is the original clearing corporation, and provides clearing and serves as the central counterparty for trades in the U.S. securities markets. It was an outgrowth of &quot;multilateral netting&quot;, which led to the formation of the National Securities Clearing Corporation (NSCC) in 1976.

Established in 1976, it provides clearing, settlement, risk management, central counterparty services, and a guarantee of completion for certain transactions for virtually all broker-to-broker trades involving equities, corporate and municipal debt, American depositary receipts, exchange-traded funds, and unit investment trusts. NSCC also nets trades and payments among its participants, reducing the value of securities and payments that need to be exchanged by an average of 98% each day. NSCC generally clears and settles trades on a &quot;T+1&quot; basis. NSCC has roughly 4,000 participants, and is regulated by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
===FICC===

The Fixed Income Clearing Corporation (FICC) provides clearing for fixed income securities, including treasury securities and mortgage backed securities

FICC was created in 2003 to handle fixed income transaction processing, integrating the Government Securities Clearing Corporation and the Mortgage-Backed Securities Clearing Corporation. The Government Securities Division (GSD) provides real-time trade matching (RTTM), clearing, risk management, and netting for trades in U.S. government debt issues, including repurchase agreements or repos. Securities transactions processed by FICC&#x27;s Government Securities Division include Treasury bills, bonds, notes, zero-coupon securities, government agency securities, and inflation-indexed securities. The Mortgage-Backed Securities Division provides real-time automated and trade matching, trade confirmation, risk management, netting, and electronic pool notification to the mortgage-backed securities market. Participants in this market include mortgage originators, government-sponsored enterprises, registered broker-dealers, institutional investors, investment managers, mutual funds, commercial banks, insurance companies, and other financial institutions.

===Global Trade Repository===

DTCC created Deriv/SERV LLC In 2003 to help resolve over the counter (OTC) derivatives challenges of the time. It provides automated matching and confirmation services for derivatives trades, including credit, equity, and interest rate derivatives. It also provides related matching of payment flows and bilateral netting services. Deriv/SERV&#x27;s customers include dealers and buy-side firms from 30 countries. In 2006, Deriv/SERV processed 2.6 million transactions.

From 2006 this service was complemented by the Trade Information Warehouse (TIW), an infrastructure that records all credit derivatives transactions, such as credit default swaps. This proved specifically useful in September 2008 by helping authorities and market participants understand exposures to failing or fragile counterparties such as Lehman Brothers or AIG. Partly based on that experience, the G20 in 2009 decided to mandate derivatives trade reporting across all derivatives asset classes (interest rates, currencies, equity, credit, and commodities), with the reports collected by regulated Trade Repositories. The reporting mandate was subsequently enshrined in legislation in the respective jurisdictions, e.g. the Dodd–Frank Act in the U.S. and EMIR in the European Union.

In May 2011, the International Swaps and Derivatives Association selected DTCC to build up a global industry-wide infrastructure to comply with the G20 mandate, and the service was started in December 2011. The trade repository service was branded Global Trade Repository (GTR) in 2012. It was deployed that year in the U.S. under CFTC supervision, and in 2013 in Australia under ASIC supervision, Hong Kong as an agent of HKMA, Japan under FSA supervision, and Singapore under MAS supervision. In November 2013, DTCC obtained a license from ESMA to operate its trade repository in the European Union, based in London and starting in February 2014, and in 2019 that service was extended to Switzerland under FINMA supervision. From 2018, DTCC built up its GTR infrastructure to also support securities financing transaction reporting in the European Union under the EU Securities Financing Transactions Regulation (SFTR). In the wake of Brexit, DTCC created an EU entity based in Dublin, which ESMA registered as an EU trade repository in late 2020, which on 1 January 2021 took over part of the activity previously reported to the UK trade repository. In compliance with legislation in the individual jurisdictions, DTCC operates trade repositories under several legal entities across the world, but keeps the original vision of a globally integrated reporting utility.

In 2019, DTCC rebranded its derivatives and trade repository businesses, including the GTR and TIW, as Repository and Derivatives Services (RDS).

===EuroCCP===

European Central Counterparty (EuroCCP) used to be a European subsidiary of DTCC from 2008 to 2020. It provides equities clearing services on a pan-European basis. Headquartered in London, EuroCCP is a UK-incorporated Recognised Clearing House regulated by the UK&#x27;s Financial Services Authority (FSA). In December 2019, EuroCCP announced it would be purchased by Cboe Global Markets.

EuroCCP began operations in August 2008, initially clearing for the pan-European trading platform Turquoise. EuroCCP has subsequently secured appointments from additional trading platforms and now provides central counterparty services for equity trades to Turquoise, SmartPool, NYSE Arca Europe and Pipeline Financial Group Limited. EuroCCP clears trades in more than 6,000 equities issues for these trading venues. In October 2009, EuroCCP began clearing and settling trades made on the Turquoise platform in 120 of the most heavily traded listed Depositary Receipts.

Citi Global Transaction Services acts as settlement agent for trades cleared by EuroCCP, which now provides clearing services in 15 major national markets in Europe: Austria, Belgium, France, Denmark, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Finland, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, United Kingdom, Switzerland, Sweden and Spain. Trades are handled in seven different currencies: the Euro, British Pound, U.S. Dollar, Swiss Franc, Danish Krone, Swedish Krona, and Norwegian Krone.

===Other operations===

DTCC Solutions is DTCC&#x27;s subsidiary, formerly named Global Asset Solutions, delivering information-based and business processing solutions relative to securities and securities transactions to financial intermediaries globally, such as Global Corporation Action Validation Service (GCA VS) and Managed Accounts Service.

<doc id="928126" wikidata="Q3139238" url="?curid=928126" title="Sutton, London">
<text>Sutton is a town in the London Borough of Sutton in South London, England. It is the administrative headquarters of the Outer London borough, on the lower slopes of the North Downs. It is south-southwest of Charing Cross, one of the fourteen metropolitan centres in the London Plan.

An ancient parish originally in the county of Surrey, Sutton is recorded in the &quot;Domesday Book&quot; of 1086 as having two churches and about 30 houses. Its location on the London to Brighton turnpike from 1755 led to the opening of coaching inns, spurring its growth as a village. When it was connected to central London by rail in 1847, it began to grow into a town, and it expanded further in the 20th century. It became a municipal borough with Cheam in 1934, and became part of Greater London in 1965.

Sutton has the largest library in the borough, several works of public art and four conservation areas. It is home to several large international companies and the sixth most important shopping area in London, centred on Sutton High Street. Sutton railway station is the largest station in the borough, offering frequent services by Southern and Govia Thameslink to Central London and other destinations, including Wimbledon and St Albans. It is home to the Royal Marsden Hospital and the Institute of Cancer Research.

Future plans for Sutton as of 2024 include creating the world&#x27;s second largest cancer research campus and improving connectivity to central London and the London Underground through the Sutton Link tram project (currently awaiting funding).

==Geography==

===Geology, soil and elevations===
Sutton is one of several towns located on a narrow bed of Thanet Sands which extends from Croydon in the east, to Epsom in the west. To the south of this belt is chalk of the North Downs, and to the north is clay. The belt of Thanet sands allowed wells to provide clean water, and this attracted settlements from a very early date. The Sutton and Cheam Water Company began operations in 1864, and by 1900 had built 142 miles of mains. The company merged with the East Surrey Water Company in 1996 to form Sutton and East Surrey Water.

Elevations in and around the town range from AOD in Belmont to in Sutton Common, at the start of the Pyl Brook stream.

===Location===
Sutton has formed part of Greater London since 1965. The town is often referred to as &quot;Sutton&quot;, &quot;Sutton, London&quot;, or &quot;Sutton, Surrey&quot; for mailing addresses. Surrey was the former Postal County and remains the historic or traditional county in which Sutton lies. This is because Greater London was formally created in 1965, and county boundaries were changed in 1974. However, the General Post Office had already established an independent system for defining the UK&#x27;s Postcode Areas to ensure efficient mail sorting. Royal Mail&#x27;s Flexible Addressing policy allows for these variations. If Sutton were to join the London postal district, it would fall under the SW postcode area and be one of the following: SW21, SW22, or SW23. There is another, much smaller Sutton in Surrey, near Dorking. Sutton mainline railway station is known as &quot;Sutton (London)&quot; by Southern (Govia Thameslink Railway).

Its location is approximately southwest of Charing Cross, London and south of the City of London, placing it within easy reach of Central London. Sutton is also approximately west of Croydon, London, north-east of Epsom, Surrey, and south-east of Kingston upon Thames, London.

In addition to the St Nicholas church grounds, there are two areas of green space within the town centre, Sutton Green and Manor Park.
Sutton Green is at the northern end of Sutton High Street, near All Saints Church. It is bordered by a row of detached Victorian villas to the west, the High Street to the east and Bushey Road to the south. The green dates from 1810, when it was awarded to the residents of Sutton under the Sutton Common Enclosure Award. Victoria Gardens, a smaller area of green space which once included a pond, lies across the road from Sutton Green.

To the north of Sutton Green are Rose Hill Park East and Rose Hill Park West, to the east and west respectively of the main thoroughfare Angel Hill/Rosehill. Rose Hill Park East contains Greenshaw Woods, for which Greenshaw High School is named.

Manor Park lies opposite the police station. It was opened by the chairman of the then Sutton Urban District Council in 1914, and its fountain was added in 1924–1925. A plaque on the pool surround states: &quot;This fountain was presented to the town by Councillor Chas Yates Chairman of Sutton U.D.C.1924–25&quot;

The park is the site of the Sutton War Memorial, which was unveiled in 1921 by Sir Ralph Forster, a resident whose son had died in the war. The memorial, in portland stone, consists of a large ornamental cross on a plinth. 524 men who died in the First World War are commemorated on the memorial. There are four depictions of angels on the plinth overlooking the park.

The current Manor Park Café opened in October 2010. It is eco-friendly and has a range of environmental features, including its straw-bale construction, giving the building a potential lifespan of over 200 years. It was designed by Amazonails Architectura, and constructed by a mixed team of builders. It was London&#x27;s first energy-efficient building to use this construction method.

In the south of Sutton starts Banstead Downs, which extends for around a mile south towards neighbouring Banstead. Banstead Downs is a large Site of Special Scientific Interest, covering . Banstead Golf Course is on the northern slopes.

Local Nature Reserves
Sutton contains two Local Nature Reserves.

*The Anton Crescent Wetland reserve has ponds, willow carr and reedbeds. It provides a habitat for birds such as the green sandpiper and common snipe.
*Devonshire Avenue Nature Area is a Site of Borough Importance for Nature Conservation, Grade II. It is mainly neutral grassland. A notable species is the small blue butterfly, which is rare in the borough.

==History==
===Origin of the name===
The placename Sutton is recorded in the 1086 Domesday Book as &quot;Sudtone&quot;. It is formed from Old English &#x27;sūth&#x27; and &#x27;tūn&#x27;, meaning &#x27;south farm&#x27;.

===Pre 1700===
Archaeological finds in the region date back thousands of years, including the excavation of a Roman villa in Beddington. An implement from the neolithic age was found in Sutton town centre. The Roman road of Stane Street formed part of the northern boundary of the parish.

Sutton was recorded as Sudtone in a charter of Chertsey Abbey believed to date from the late 7th century, when the Manor was granted to the Abbot of Chertsey by Frithwald, Governor of Surrey. Some sources state the name as Suthtone or Sudtana.
The 1086 Domesday Book records Sutton as spanning about 800 acres, and having about 30 houses and 200 people. It states that the Abbot of Chertsey held the manor. In 1538 it was sold to King Henry VIII and granted to Sir Nicholas Carew of Beddington. When Sir Nicholas was sentenced to death, the King seized the manor. Queen Mary restored it to Francis, son of Sir Nicholas. It later became a Crown possession again until King Charles II granted it to the Duke of Portland, who sold it in 1669. It changed hands regularly thereafter.
From the time of Domesday until the 19th century, Sutton formed a parish in the Wallington hundred of Surrey in the feudal system.

Jose Glover, who was Rector of Sutton from 1628 to 1636, became a pioneer of printing in the English colonies of North America and one of the people instrumental in establishing Harvard College in the 1630s.

===1700 to 1900===

The road from London to Banstead Downs, through Sutton, was a haven for highwaymen in the 18th century. In 1755, two turnpike roads, which met at Sutton, were built: one from London to Brighton (Brighton Road), the other from Carshalton to Ewell (Cheam Road). The toll bars for the roads were originally located by the Cock Hotel, a coaching inn at the junction. The inn&#x27;s sign straddled the Brighton road.

The London to Brighton stagecoach began in 1760, and the Cock Hotel was the 9am stop for coaches leaving the city. Regular contact beyond the town brought expansion and sophistication. Small businesses opened up, at first related to travelers and later to provide goods for neighbouring areas. The toll bars moved away from the junction as Sutton expanded, remaining in use until 1882.
Sutton railway station was opened in 1847. Following the arrival of the new, fast link to central London, Sutton&#x27;s population more than doubled between 1851 and 1861, and the village became a town. New housing was built in the Lind Road area, and called &quot;New Town&quot;. A pub built in 1854 on the corner of Lind Road was named the Jenny Lind, after the famous Swedish opera singer Johanna Maria Lind, who was visiting friends in the area in 1847 and enchanted locals with her singing. It has recently been renamed the Nightingale, also after the singer, who was known as the Swedish Nightingale.

In about 1852 a residential school was built alongside the Sutton to Epsom Downs railway near Brighton Road. The building was designed by Edwin Nash and contained administrative, dining, dormitory and teaching areas. Boys were taught manual skills like shoemaking and metal working. Girls were taught such skills as needle work, laundry work, and ironing with a view to making them good servants, wives and mothers. Up to 1856, when large parts of it were destroyed by fire, the boys&#x27; and girls&#x27; sections were on the same site but after 1856 the girls&#x27; were moved into a new building on the other side of the railway in Banstead Road (now called Cotswold Road).

Sutton Water Company was incorporated in 1863, and the provision of water mains allowed houses to be built outside the Thanet Sands area. The Lord of the Manor, Mr Thomas Alcock, sold land for housing, and Sutton&#x27;s population more than doubled again between 1861 and 1871, spurred by the development of upmarket Benhilton in north Sutton.
The High Street near the top was known as Cock Hill until the 1880s – the shops on the east side were built in 1880, ten years after those on the west side. The grand and decorative London and Provincial Bank building (now home to Barclays Bank) was built overlooking the historic crossroads in 1894. Designed in the French Renaissance architectural style, it is four storeys tall and forms a prominent local landmark. There is a series of arches at ground level, and an ornate entrance where the roads meet.

In 1884 Sutton High School for Girls was founded by the then Girls&#x27; Public Day School Trust.

In 1899 Sutton County Grammar School (now Sutton Grammar School for Boys) opened.
In 1897 Sutton Masonic Hall was built in Grove Road. Freemasons have met there since its foundation, apart during World War II when the military requisitioned it and it served as a shelter for displaced people.

In 1898 a new, larger Cock Hotel replaced the original one.

===20th century===

By 1901, the town&#x27;s population had reached 17,223 as further housing was built and the High Street was developed.

In 1902 the Banstead Road site of the South Metropolitan Industrial school was bought by the Metropolitan Asylums Board. The site later became the Downs Schools and then the Downs Hospital. It is now shared between the Royal Marsden and Sutton Hospitals, the Institute of Cancer Research, and the site of a new school to be opened in 2019.
The Sutton Adult School and Institute opened in 1910 in a large Edwardian building in Benhill Avenue. It later became the &quot;Thomas Wall Centre&quot;, named after the area&#x27;s benefactor of Wall&#x27;s sausage and ice cream fame. Thomas Wall&#x27;s lack of education led to a desire to encourage learning in others, resulting in the establishment of a trust and the construction of the institute. The adult school is said to have had the best premises in the UK: by 1915 there were social clubs, a library, clubs for maternity and horticulture, debating and temperance societies, a legal advice committee, bible study and English literature classes, and what was claimed to be the finest public gymnasium in southern England.

During World War II bombing was not as heavy as in central London – 434 bombs in total were dropped on Sutton and Cheam, and the Commonwealth War Graves Commission lists 187 civilian casualties.

In 1950, in order to widen the High Street, the Cock Hotel was demolished. However, the inn sign and its fingerposts survive, overlooking the historic crossroads. The sign and fingerposts were given Grade II listed status by English Heritage on 18 April 2018.

In 1959 a local resident, George Edgar Alcock, started a campaign to preserve a unique avenue of copper beech trees. This campaign led the same year to the formation of the Sutton and Cheam Society, a local amenity group. A plaque commemorating Mr Alcock&#x27;s life is situated at the junction of Christchurch Park with Brighton Road.

==Governance==

Sutton came within the area of the Metropolitan Police District in 1840. The parish of Sutton adopted the Local Government Act 1858 in 1882 and a local board was formed to govern the area. The Local Government Act 1894 reformed it as Sutton Urban District.

In 1928 the area of the urban district was expanded to include the parish of Cheam, and renamed Sutton and Cheam. The town became a municipal borough in 1934, and the civil parishes were merged in 1949. The municipal borough was abolished in 1965 and its former area became part of the London Borough of Sutton in Greater London.

For Westminster elections, Sutton is part of the Sutton and Cheam constituency, formed in 1945. The Member of Parliament is Luke Taylor, of the Liberal Democrats, and has been since the 2024 General Election.

On a local level, the London Borough of Sutton Council has been run by a Liberal Democrat majority since 1990.

==Population and demography==
Most of Sutton, including the town centre, falls under the SM1 postcode area, though places south of Sutton railway station are part of SM2 instead, and the western part of Sutton Common is in SM3.

The population of the town was counted as 58,880 including the Sutton Central, Sutton South, Sutton North, Sutton West and Belmont Wards in the 2021 United Kingdom census, while the borough overall counted 209,639.
A majority of the town&#x27;s population is in the middle class ABC1 social group.

==Architecture==
Sutton is mainly the product of the railways, which arrived in the town in the mid-19th century. So, although it already existed (as a village with coaching inns) in the horse and carriage era, most of the town&#x27;s earliest architecture is Victorian. A few buildings date from before the Victorian era. The mid-18th century Georgian &quot;Sutton Lodge&quot; on Brighton Road is thought to be the oldest fully surviving building in the former parish of Sutton. The lodge was initially the farmhouse of the former Sutton Farm. Later, the farmland around the lodge was sold off for house building. The lodge itself survived and was bought by Sutton Council, for use as a day centre. During its early history it may have served as a hideaway for the future King George IV and his mistresses. The building is Grade II listed.
The High Street and the central area housing has a majority of Victorian architecture; Edwardian architecture is also represented, especially among the town&#x27;s housing stock. Of architectural interest because of its particularly varied style is the Victorian residential quarter east of the high street known as Newtown, where no single developer was in overall charge. The town features more recent architectural styles from the 1930s (including some art deco and moderne).

The most prominent examples of 21st century architecture include the Aspects and Lamborne apartment buildings and the new police station extension. Aspects was created out of a former office building; it was reclad in a terracotta colour and three additional floors were added at the top for penthouses. With a total of eighteen floors, it can be seen from across Sutton. By contrast, the Lamborne was newly built.

In 2003 the extension to Sutton Police Station was completed and officially opened the following year by Commissioner Sir John Stevens. The extension, which is far larger than the original Edwardian listed building to which it is attached, is used by Sutton CID, the criminal justice unit and the borough intelligence unit.

===Conservation areas===


There are four conservation areas in the town of Sutton (among several others within the wider borough of Sutton). One is in the town centre and the other three are residential. The areas are:
*&quot;The Sutton Town Centre High Street Crossroads Conservation Area&quot;, which was designated in 2011 and is noted for the &quot;vivid, Victorian, polychrome brick and stone façades&quot; of the High Street buildings.
*&quot;The Landseer Road Conservation Area&quot; of grand, finely detailed, Edwardian villa houses.
*&quot;The Grove Avenue Conservation Area&quot; of mainly modernist houses.
*&quot;The Sutton Garden Suburb Conservation Area&quot;, whose homes in the Arts and Crafts style contributed to the garden city movement.

===Russettings===
&quot;Russettings&quot; is a large house built in 1899 on a -acre plot at 25 Worcester Road. It was among the last of several similar upper-middle-class houses built in the vicinity. It was originally occupied by George Smith and his wife Mary, who was the sister of local benefactor Thomas Wall. Smith had his initials GS put on the façade of the red-brick building, which was designed by Frederick Wheeler in an Arts and Crafts style.

Features include gabled roofs, large chimneys, bay windows, a green copper dome and a porch with a tiled roof and marble floor. With the newly formed London Borough of Sutton in 1965, the house became the Sutton Register Office.

==Places of worship==
There are three churches in the town centre: Trinity Church and St Nicholas Church on St Nicholas Way and Sutton Baptist Church on Cheam Road.

Other churches in the town include All Saints Church in the north, St Barnabas in the east and Christ Church in the south (all Anglican); and two Roman Catholic churches, Our Lady of the Rosary to the east, and the Church of the Holy Family by Sutton Green. The Salvation Army have a centre in Benhill Avenue. Most recently, Hope Church Sutton was established in November 2015 and meets at Sutton Grammar School.

Sutton Synagogue is located on Cedar Road, south of the town centre.

===Trinity United Reformed and Methodist Church===
The Grade II listed Trinity Church is in the Gothic style, with its exterior in Kent ragstone. Its tall, square tower is the most striking architectural feature and makes the building a landmark. Its &quot;crown and lantern&quot; spire is a very unusual feature, shared with two cathedrals — St Giles&#x27; Cathedral in Edinburgh and Newcastle Cathedral.

The present building, officially opened in 1907, was renamed Trinity Methodist Church following the Methodist Union in 1932. In 1972 the Congregational and Presbyterian Churches united, and the Congregational and Methodist congregations in Sutton also united, with Trinity becoming a joint United Reformed and Methodist church.

===Sutton Baptist Church===

In contrast to the other two town centre churches, the Baptist Church is relatively modern—it was designed by the architect Nugent Cachemaille-Day (1896–1976) using mainly traditional materials, such as brick and tile, in a style influenced by the Arts and Crafts Movement. Built by Messrs. Pitchers Ltd of Holloway in 1934, the church took little more than half-a-year to build, and its design aroused interest not only locally, but also in church and architectural circles nationwide.

The church is noted within the borough for its contemporary brick design with long walls and concave sweeps in the moderne style. The windows are in simple clean lines, in a simplified Gothic style. The interior has much exposed brickwork and sweeping pointed arches, which are highlighted by the directions in which the bricks are laid.
===St Nicholas Church===
The Grade II listed St Nicholas Church is the oldest of the three town centre churches, and is surrounded by a small ancient graveyard, which is wooded. It is in ecumenical partnership with other denominations and in a Team Ministry with other Anglican churches.

Many of Sutton&#x27;s notable historic residents are buried in the churchyard. These include Mr Horward Orme, the final owner of the manor house; Dorothy Mason, wife of Sir William Brownlow, 4th Baronet; William Talbot, 1st Earl Talbot; and 185 orphans from the Metropolitan District School. The orphans&#x27; graves are marked by a memorial put up by the church&#x27;s Sunday school children in 1921. A large World War II bomb landed on the churchyard in 1940. It destroyed several graves, but the church building itself remained intact.

===All Saints Church===
Just to the north of Sutton town centre at the foot of Angel Hill in All Saints Road is All Saints Church, Benhilton. Its large size and prominent location make it a local landmark. Its parish was created in 1863, and the foundation stone of the Grade II* listed building was laid in the same year, designed by Samuel Sanders Teulon in the Gothic Revival style. The then lord of the manor, Thomas Alcock, gave £18,000 towards the building, plus the land for the church, the vicarage and a school. The church was conceived as an amenity for an estate of upper class Victorian housing which Alcock was developing on the land to the east.

There is a historic churchyard around the church, which includes several significant tombs. It is wooded, including yew trees beside the path to the north porch.

English Heritage describe the church as &quot;a very fine building in the decorated style of the early 14th century&quot;.

===St. Barnabas Church===
To the east of the town centre is St Barnabas Church, which was built between 1882 and 1884 by architects R H Carpenter and Benjamin Ingelow. Its purpose was to serve the Newtown area of Sutton, which was developed in the second half of the 19th century.

Architecturally, the church is a red brick building with stone dressings, and is in the Gothic Revival style. Its nave has five bays, and is supported inside by columns with clustered shafts and a timber scissors truss roof.

===Christ Church===

To the south of the town centre in Christchurch Park sits Christ Church, Sutton. It was built in 1888 by architects Newman &amp; Jacques. Additions were made c. 1910 to 1912 by J D Round.

The church was built as part of the 19th century expansion of the town. With the growing population to the south of the parish church of St Nicholas in the town centre, the need was recognised for the people living in the south to have a more local church. The building was sited among the then lavender fields east of Brighton Road. The church has the largest auditorium in Sutton, and comprises a nave of five bays, a chancel, apse, north and south aisles, chapel, narthex and vestries.

===Church of Our Lady of the Rosary and Church of the Holy Family===
To the east of the town centre, on St Barnabas Road, is the Church of Our Lady of the Rosary. It was built and consecrated in 1892, before it was enlarged in 1912; in 1932 the church&#x27;s current altar was consecrated by the then Roman Catholic Bishop of Southwark, Peter Amigo.

The Church of the Holy Family, though closer to the town centre, is more recent, starting as Holy Family Church Hall in the 1960s. The current church was built in 1988, two years after being given its own parish.

==Culture==

Sutton has a range of public art, a large library, a music venue and a cinema and theatre. It is a hub for filming in south-west London.
===Sutton Central Library&#x27;s Art Gallery Space===
Sutton Central Library&#x27;s Art Gallery aims to provide the London Borough of Sutton&#x27;s residents with a wide range of contemporary art, heritage and history experiences. The gallery space is available for hire to professional artists, collectives and non-profit groups wishing to exhibit their work individually or as a group. Entrance to the gallery and access to the exhibition is free for all members of the public, except for specific events.

===Imagine festival of arts===
In 2006 the annual Imagine festival of arts was launched. It has since gained Arts Council England funding.

===Public art===

Sutton town centre contains six main works of public art, as well as several other works. Of the main works, three are murals and three are sculptures.

====Sutton heritage mosaic====

There is a large town centre mosaic measuring high and wide covering the whole of a three-storey wall in the town square near the Waterstone&#x27;s bookshop. One of the largest examples of wall art in Britain, it was commissioned by the London Borough of Sutton to celebrate the borough&#x27;s heritage.
 Created by artists Gary Drostle and Rob Turner, the mosaic was made from vitreous ceramic tesserae (small tiles made of glass and clay), and put in place in 1994.

It was designed by Rob Turner, and shows several aspects of Sutton&#x27;s heritage and local history. The centre-piece is the depiction of Henry VIII&#x27;s palace at Nonsuch.

A plaque describing the panels was installed in 2011, and unveiled by Councillor Graham Tope, who said: 
====Wellesley Road mural====

There is a large mural in Wellesley Road, about a hundred yards south of the railway station. It was created by the street artist, Eva Mena, who is from Bilbao, Spain and a leading practitioner in the urban art movement. The mural dates from 2008, and was completed in three days.

It was commissioned by the owner of a cleaning firm keen to promote local art, and depicts an image of Erykah Badu, the American singer-songwriter. The painting covers the entire side wall of Indepth House, a small office building occupied by the firm.
====Sutton twin towns mural====

The &quot;twin towns mural&quot; is a set of seven individual paintings inset within seven mock window frames on the side of a Victorian commercial building at the junction of the High Street with Sutton Court Road. The paintings depict scenes of the London Borough of Sutton and its four European twins: Gagny, a suburb of Paris; Gladsaxe in Copenhagen; Minden in Germany; and Charlottenburg-Wilmersdorf in Berlin.

The paintings were designed and painted on to plywood by public artists, Gary Drostle and Rob Turner and were unveiled in 1993 on the 25th anniversary of Sutton&#x27;s twinning with Wilmersdorf. The five twins are each painted with their heraldic shield above images of their key features. Each twin also has its own plant to symbolise environmental awareness; for Sutton this is a beech tree, from which Carshalton Beeches in the borough gets its name.

====Sutton armillary====
The Millennium Dial armillary was dedicated to the town in the year 2000 by the Rotary Club. It is in the form of an historical timepiece, and it serves three purposes: first, to tell the time; secondly, to commemorate time through various inscriptions including the Rotary motto &quot;Service Above Self&quot; and distances to nearby areas such as Kingston upon Thames; and thirdly, to commemorate the work which the Rotary Club has done.

The armillary is a popular feature of the town, and it continues to provide a focus for the town centre. It marks not just the new millennium but also the central part that the Rotary has played in the welfare of Sutton since 1923.

It was originally installed in the former &quot;Millennium Garden&quot;, but was slightly re-positioned in 2011 to the edge of the central square, in front of the Waterstones bookshop.
====The Messenger====
The Messenger statue is a sculpture in bronze with very dark patination completed by David Wynne, OBE in 1981 of a large horse and rider. The horse, with a slightly raised left leg, looks towards the railway station. The rider, seated bareback, raises his left hand in the air above his head and his right hand to his mouth, as if calling. It is fully life-size and mounted on a 7-foot plinth of marble and granite slabs. The total height is .

The statue was commissioned by the then Business Press International Ltd, and upkeep of the work then fell to Reed Business Information, who occupied Quadrant House at the time. It was a major commission for the sculptor, which took four years from his first idea and inspiration, through to roughing out, refining and foundry to the final unveiling and installation. The company wanted him to illustrate its fundamental business, communication, but to convey the idea of it, rather than simply represent it in a completely obvious way. The statue is located by the main entrance to Quadrant House, adjacent to Sutton station.

====Transpose 2002====

&quot;Transpose 2002&quot; is a sculpture by Michael Dan Archer, located at the junction of Carshalton Road and Langley Park Road, about 250 yards from the town&#x27;s historic central crossroads. It is 7 metres (23 feet) in height, 1.5 metres (5 feet) in width and 1.5 metres in depth, and made of Chinese granite and stainless steel. It is composed of a steel blade-like structure next to a granite form. The blade contains a grid allowing the sun to shine through on to the granite.

The sculpture was commissioned jointly by Chartwell Land, B&amp;Q and the London Borough of Sutton. As its name suggests, it dates from 2002. Archer says his sculptures &quot;primarily invoke the massiveness and physicality of stone and its relationship to architecture, humanity and landscape&quot;.

The design, location and dimensions of &quot;Transpose 2002&quot; all combine to make it a significant landmark for those entering Sutton town centre from an easterly direction along Carshalton Road.
===Rainbow crossing===

In mid-2020, a permanent rainbow pedestrian crossing in honour of the borough&#x27;s LGBT+ community was installed in St. Nicholas Way, adjacent to the Sutton Civic Centre, a prominent location in Sutton town centre. This makes Sutton one of fewer than ten London boroughs to have permanent LGBT+ rainbow crossings. Tyrone Ashby, Sutton LGBTQ+ Forum Chair, said:

&quot;Having a rainbow crossing will show visitors to Sutton that we are signalling an inclusive environment for LGBTQ+ communities – we are showing our true colours as an open, diverse and accepting borough and we have Pride in our hearts.&quot;

===Transgender crossing===

In May 2021 the country&#x27;s first transgender pedestrian crossing was painted in Sutton town centre, near the north end of Sutton High Street. Its installation was timed to coincide with International Day Against Homophobia, Transphobia and Biphobia.

Cllr Jake Short, Sutton Council&#x27;s Lead Member for Equalities, said: &quot;I am delighted to see this celebration of the richness and diversity that our transgender community brings to Sutton. Until transgender people and other minority groups are able to live without fear of discrimination or hate, we must continue to demonstrate our support and stand with them to clearly demonstrate our commitment to eliminating transphobia.&quot;

===Diversity mural===
Sutton Council is planning to create a large mural in the town centre celebrating diversity in the borough. Using local artists, it will be installed on the wall of Sutton College on St Nicholas Way. Completion was expected in the summer of 2021.

===Commemorative bench===
A bench dedicated to female victims of male violence was unveiled in Trinity Square in Sutton town centre in March 2022, created by local artists Samia Tossio and Hana Horack, following the murders in 2021 of Sarah Everard and Sabina Nessa. Having a brightly coloured mosaic surface themed with hearts and stars, the inscription reads, &quot;Never commit, excuse or remain silent&quot; (words used by the White Ribbon Campaign) and &quot;Remembering women who died from male violence&quot;. Plans for the bench were conceived by the &quot;Reclaim Sutton&#x27;s Streets&quot; campaign group, following a vigil for Sabina Nessa in the same location in 2021 held around a &quot;tree of remembrance&quot; decorated with yarn-bombing.
Sutton mayor, Trish Fivey, said at the unveiling: &quot;Today, we&#x27;re here to unveil this very moving tribute to all women and girls who have died as a result of male violence, no matter who they were or where they lived.&quot; Also present was Sarah McGuinness, chair of Reclaim Sutton&#x27;s Streets, who said: &quot;Campaigning to end violence against women and girls ... can be met with resistance ... but the movement grows ... as day after day women are abused and killed. Having such a beautiful mosaic memorial not only shines light on all the women who have been lost to male violence, it also educates and calls to action ...&quot;

===Literary facilities===
Sutton Library is situated close to the top of the town, near St Nicholas Church, and is part of a complex which contains the Civic Offices and Sutton College. It is the largest library in the borough. Opened in 1975, it was extensively refurbished in 2004 to meet changing customer needs. It was the first public library to appoint a library writer-in-residence; the first to establish a CD and video lending library; and the first to offer a full public library service on Sundays. The library is arranged over four storeys, and the lending and reference facilities extend to a reader&#x27;s lounge; café and shop; IT facilities; opportunities to listen to music; and a children&#x27;s library themed around the world&#x27;s environments.

Art exhibitions are held in the library&#x27;s Europa Gallery.

===Sutton Life Centre===
The Sutton Life Centre situated in Alcorn Close, just off Sutton Common Road, is an £8 million facility designed to improve life chances for younger people and encourage good citizenship. Aiming to encourage community engagement and involvement, the centre was opened on 27 October 2010 by the then Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg.

The centre&#x27;s key feature – &quot;The Lifezone&quot; – is a virtual street, a room with giant projection screens on all walls using film-set technology. It aims to provide an &quot;immersive learning environment&quot; through the use of surround sound, evocative lighting and interactive features. Using these media, pupils are shown real-life scenes from Sutton&#x27;s streets to teach them about citizenship, personal safety and the environment.
===Theatre and cinema===

Theatre

The Secombe Theatre (named after Sir Harry Secombe) was in Cheam Road, adjacent to the Holiday Inn hotel. The theatre was opened by Sir Harry, who lived in Sutton for over 30 years. The theatre was created in 1984 out of a former Christian Science church building dating from 1937. The theatre was operated together with the Charles Cryer Studio Theatre in Carshalton, formerly by the London Borough of Sutton.
In 2014 Sutton Council requested bids to take over the running of the theatres, and in January 2015 the bid by the new &quot;Sutton Theatres Trust&quot; was given approval by the council&#x27;s environment and neighbourhood committee to take over the theatres. In August 2016 the trust went into administration and the theatre closed permanently.

Cinema

The former Granada Cinema opened in 1934 as the Plaza Theatre in Carshalton Road, where Sutton Park House now stands. The ten-screen Empire Cinema, opened in 1991 opposite the St. Nicholas shopping centre.

Planned cultural hub

A new cultural hub, combining cinema, theatre, performing arts classes, food and drink is planned for late 2023. To be known as &quot;Throwley Yard&quot;, it will take over the premises of a former nightclub in Throwley Road in Sutton town centre. The renovation of the premises is being funded by the Government&#x27;s Future High Streets Fund, and the facility will be run by Really Local Group. The local Council sees it as part of its commitment to the local economy and culture &quot;by creating spaces for community, business, and artists to grow&quot;. It will be carbon-neutral.

===Media===
Along with Wimbledon Studios, Sutton is a hub for filming in south-west London.

&quot;The Return of Mr Bean&quot; was filmed in Sutton High Street.

Episodes of &quot;The Bill&quot; were filmed in Sutton.

The E4 sitcom &quot;Phoneshop&quot;, was filmed in a vacant shop unit in Sutton High Street.

Scenes for the Hollywood film &quot;Black Sea&quot; were shot outside Sutton Grammar School in 2013. Jude Law is seen getting in and out of a car, while pupils leave the school.

===Music===

Sutton Symphony Orchestra was founded in 1946. It has given an average of three concerts every season.

The 300 capacity Boom Boom Club in West Sutton host rock gigs.

====The Sound Lounge====

The Sound Lounge, a grassroots concert venue, opened in December 2020 in Sutton High Street in the former premises of Royal Bank of Scotland. It hosts live performances of blues, Americana, folk and roots music. The venue includes a plant-based, carbon-neutral café, and hosts visual art exhibitions, theatre and dance. Following the easing of lockdown, it had a limited reopening in April 2021 for outdoor food and drink consumption and vinyl record sales at the Union Music Store within. As at 21 April, live music events were booked for most weekend nights as far forward as October 2021. A women&#x27;s theatre event was due to take place on 27 June, and Sunday jazz afternoons with vegan roast are planned.

On 1 July 2021 the venue became the country&#x27;s first grassroots music venue to be certified as carbon neutral. A wide variety of measures have been put in place to achieve neutrality. In addition to the fully plant-based menu for the café, these include getting all energy from renewable sources, not sending any waste to landfill and maintaining an allotment garden on site for zero-carbon produce for the café.

====The Rolling Stones====

The Rolling Stones were first spotted at the Red Lion public house (now the Winning Post) in Sutton High Street. The band played several early gigs there in 1963, and, during one, the audience included impresario/music manager Giorgio Gomelsky, who spotted the band and signed them up for a residency at Richmond&#x27;s Crawdaddy Club, months before they made the charts.
It was at the pub that Charlie Watts and Bill Wyman, on 23 January 1963, became permanent members of the band:

In 2011, the Winning Post was added to a list of buildings and structures of local significance.

==Economy==
Sutton is one of the eleven major metropolitan centres identified in the London Plan in a borough that benefits from very low crime by London standards. The town contains a major retail district, centred on Sutton High Street.

Sutton has over 6,800 businesses, an increase of about 19% since 1994. 863 new companies were formed in Sutton in 2012, the highest number since records began. Most of these were small or medium-sized, but several large businesses, such as RELX, the information and analytics company, are also present and have office space in the town: RELX occupies Sutton Park House opposite the police station, and is a major local employer.
Another important business locally is subsea engineering company Subsea 7.

Sutton Park House was the former office of G4S and Crown Agents Bank, a provider of the wholesale foreign exchange and cross-border payments services, was headquartered in Quadrant House, in the town centre, until 2024. 

There is a town centre manager, who works in partnership with local businesses, the police and transport providers to promote the centre and its economic development. The manager acts as the focal point for a range of initiatives funded by the council and other partners. &quot;Opportunity Sutton&quot; and Sutton Chamber of Commerce also play a part in the local economy.

===Health and research===
====Royal Marsden Hospital and Institute of Cancer Research====
The Royal Marsden Hospital has a longstanding presence in Sutton, on a site at the southern end of the town acquired in 1962. The Institute of Cancer Research is located next to the hospital, and in 2012 the institute&#x27;s Centre for Molecular Pathology opened.

In 2014, The Royal Marsden Hospital, the Institute of Cancer Research and the co-located St Helier University Hospitals NHS Trust set out a vision for a &quot;world class&quot; life sciences cluster (&quot;Sutton for Life&quot;) on the site, focusing on the provision of enhanced facilities for drug discovery. The then Mayor of London, Boris Johnson, visited the facility that year, and lent his support to the plans for what would be the world&#x27;s second biggest cancer research campus.

In December 2014, the Institute was named in The Times Higher Education league table the country&#x27;s leading university, ahead of Oxford and Cambridge, in recognition of its contribution to society.
In June 2023 the Oaks Cancer Centre was opened by Prince William. Patients, clinicians and researchers will all be co-located in the centre to promote improved collaboration. The new Charles Wolfson Rapid Diagnostic Centre, which will provide people with quicker diagnoses, is based in the centre. Prince William said: &quot;As President of The Royal Marsden, I am delighted to be here with you today to celebrate the opening of a remarkable treatment and research facility, that will transform the lives of cancer patients. The Oak Cancer Centre is a major milestone in both The Royal Marsden&#x27;s history and the future of early diagnosis...For the first time, this state-of-the-art Centre brings together hundreds of researchers alongside patients. This will deliver truly integrated &quot;bench to bedside&quot; studies that will speed up the development and translation of new personalised treatments – not just for Royal Marsden patients here, but for cancer patients worldwide.&quot;

====London Cancer Hub====
In February 2016, further plans for the site were released: the &quot;London Cancer Hub&quot;, a partnership between the Institute of Cancer Research, the Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust and the London Borough of Sutton, will bring together 10,000 scientists, and clinical and support staff and provide space for biotech and pharma companies to carry our research and development. The aim is to increase the number of clinical trials and innovative drugs, and to work in partnership with industry to increase treatments for patients.

The London Cancer Hub includes a new secondary school, which specialises in the life sciences. Leisure facilities in the form of shops, cafés and hotel space for patients and families are also planned. The Hub is expected to be twice the size – at 265,000 square metres – of the existing research and treatment space. It will facilitate collaboration between different scientific fields. By 2018 the Institute of Cancer Research will develop the first phase of the plans with 20,000 square metres of drug discovery facilities.

In September 2016 Sutton Council&#x27;s housing, economy and business committee approved a provisional framework of the plans. It was noted that site&#x27;s transformation would attract a total investment of £1 billion over its lifetime.

In March 2021 it was announced that a new &quot;Innovation Gateway&quot; would open in the London Cancer Hub in Sutton in late 2021. The first business occupying the Innovation Gateway, a medical technology company developing a technology platform to support personalised dose administration, moved in in July 2022.

In October 2021, the Centre for Cancer Drug Discovery, sited in a new 7,300 square metre building costing £75 million, was opened by Princess Anne.

===Town centre regeneration===

Several major building projects are underway or have recently been completed in the town centre:

Sutton Point, at the southern end of the town centre, will include a hotel, apart-hotel, apartments (with a car club), a health club, shops, restaurants and office space. Construction of the £90 million scheme was awarded by the developer CNM Estates to the building firm Ardmore Group, and was due for completion in December 2018.

The Old Gas Works, a major development by LXB Retail Properties at the north end of the High Street, including apartments, a Sainsbury&#x27;s supermarket, retail units and a landscaped square with fountain was completed in 2016. The scheme represented a £50 million investment in the town.

Subsea 7 has expanded in Sutton, making it the site of its new world headquarters. The firm moved within the town to a new, purpose-built, five-storey, 17,500 square metre office building. Four hundred jobs were created, mainly by relocation, taking the workforce in Sutton to 780. Construction of the £39 million development by Galliford Try started in 2014, and was completed in late 2016.

In September 2015 the council appointed a design team led by Bilfinger GVA to produce plans covering the next 15 years for the central area of the town. The plans include identifying sites for new housing and commercial space, a possible new primary school and improved transport links, including the introduction in 2020 of Sutton Link Tramlink trams to Sutton station. The plans require the retention of the &quot;high-quality Victorian, Edwardian and Mock Tudor buildings that reflect the historic core of the town centre&quot;

In June 2016 a masterplan titled &quot;Sutton 2031: Planning for our Future&quot; was published by the council. Its plans include new developments, enhanced public space and improvements to transport. It will include:
*&quot;A range of immediate High Street projects&quot;
*&quot;Transforming the St Nicholas Centre&quot;
*&quot;Creating a new south London destination with culture, leisure and restaurant activity&quot;
*&quot;Redeveloping the Civic Centre&quot;

The council plans to sell several properties, including the Civic Centre site, Sutton Library, Russettings, and the disused Secombe Theatre, to develop new homes, including affordable housing. Over the next ten years, the St Nicholas Centre will be replaced with higher-quality buildings featuring shops, restaurants, bars, new council offices, a library, and a community hub.

====Heritage Action Zone====
In March 2017 it was announced that Sutton town centre had been designated one of the first ten Heritage Action Zones by Historic England. Gaining this status will unlock resources to enhance the historic environment, including the conservation area, to encourage economic growth. Heritage will be made a central consideration for new developments in the area to retain the town&#x27;s distinct architectural nature.

===Retailing===

Retailing history

Retailing has been a major part of the Sutton economy since the Victorian era. The oldest retail business currently operating in Sutton, Pearson Cycles, dates from the 1860s – it was originally a blacksmith shop, but in the 1890s changed to bicycle making and repair. The Pearsons have run the cycle business from the same High Street location ever since. It has been recognised by Guinness World Records as the oldest bicycle shop in the world.

Retail environment

Sutton is London&#x27;s sixth most important retail centre, and attracts shoppers from a wide area. Sutton High Street runs for nearly a mile from Sutton Green to Sutton station, and hosts many of the country&#x27;s main high street names.

It is often the chosen location for new retail ventures, for example the Sutton branch of the Waterstones bookshop chain was the first to have a café installed.

Shopping centres

There are two covered shopping centres situated near the middle of the retail area. The larger of these is the St. Nicholas Centre with three levels, and five levels for the former Debenhams anchor store. Times Square is the smaller one – it opened in 1985, and was re-launched in 2017 following a refit. &quot;The refit was assessed as being of high quality and making a significant contribution to the regeneration of the town centre.&quot;

Restaurants and bars
Sutton has several restaurants, patisseries, coffee bars, gastropubs and bars. The central area is pedestrianised, and the extra space encourages the provision of pavement seating.

Sutton&#x27;s range of restaurants has expanded in recent years, and now includes examples of French, Lebanese, British, vegan, Malaysian, Thai, Pakistani, Portuguese, Turkish, Sri Lankan and Japanese cuisine, in addition to the more longstanding Italian, Indian and Chinese establishments. One French restaurant was in the 2013 Good Food Guide and was Michelin-listed then.

Pop-up market

A &quot;pop-up&quot; market is held every month at the northern end of Sutton High Street. It is part of a programme to support local entrepreneurs starting their own business. Products and crafts on sale include natural cosmetics, jewellery and handmade clothing.

Street performance

The high street and town square host street performances, including music, arts and theatre. Markets are held from time to time, including French, Italian and Continental markets, as well as arts and crafts fairs.

In August and September the high street hosts the outdoor &quot;Sunset Cinema,&quot; where films are shown in the evening to an audience seated in deckchairs. The scheme, the only one of its kind in London, aims to encourage greater use of local restaurants and bars. The High Street has hosted a country music festival with live music and dancing for the last two summers. A temporary mini-golf course is set up during August.

Green wall
There is a green wall or &quot;vertical garden&quot; in the shopping area, designed aesthetically and to improve air quality and biodiversity. It provides additional breeding and nesting options in the vicinity and safeguards local flora and fauna. It helps to offset the carbon footprint, lowers the heat island effect of the urban area and reduces smog from traffic fumes. The green wall covers the façade of a large High Street store, and is in bloom all year round.
==Transport==

Sutton station is the town&#x27;s major station, from where frequent direct trains run to several main central London stations − London Victoria, London Bridge, Blackfriars, City Thameslink and, for Eurostar services, St Pancras International. The station is served by Thameslink and Southern.

The fastest of the Victoria-bound trains from Sutton station take 25 minutes (stopping at Carshalton and Clapham Junction).

As well as these direct trains to central London, there are also direct services to destinations outside central London including Banstead, Dorking, Epsom, Leatherhead, Luton, Horsham, St Albans, West Croydon and Wimbledon.

West Sutton and Sutton Common stations are both on the Thameslink lines to Wimbledon and on to central London direct. Being on the Thameslink line, they continue on to stations both within and the other side of London.

Local bus services are operated by London General, London United, Transport UK and Metrobus. There are express coach services to Heathrow Airport and Gatwick Airport.

Road traffic is diverted away from a largely pedestrianised town centre, and there are many designated cycle routes in Sutton, along with links to neighbouring towns. There are three main car parks in the town centre and a car club.

===Sutton Tube Station===

In the early 1920s, Sutton was slated to become part of the London Underground network by creating a Sutton Underground Station. The plan was for Sutton to serve as the final stop for both the Northern Line and the District Line. To facilitate this, the Wimbledon to Sutton route was constructed. However, due to the outbreak of World War I, funding shortages led to the Northern Line extension being halted at Morden, and Sutton remained and still remains without direct underground service

===Sutton Link and TramLink===

In 2014 a consultation was held into options for the route of a proposed TramLink extension from Wimbledon to Sutton. 
The Sutton Link was a proposed new tram line in South London, connecting Sutton Train Station to Colliers Wood Tube Station via St Helier. Proposed since the early 2000s, consultations on the proposed route took place in the late 2010s. A preferred route was announced in February 2020, with the Sutton-to-Colliers-Wood alignment being selected. However, financial issues caused by the COVID-19 pandemic led Transport for London to put the project on hold in July 2020. Although the plan would later be revisited in the London Plan 2021.

<doc id="928130" wikidata="Q388565" url="?curid=928130" title="Rifamycin">
<text>The rifamycins are a group of antibiotics that are synthesized either naturally by the bacterium &quot;Amycolatopsis rifamycinica&quot; or artificially. They are a subclass of the larger family of ansamycins. Rifamycins are particularly effective against mycobacteria, and are therefore used to treat tuberculosis, leprosy, and mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) infections.

The rifamycin group includes the classic rifamycin drugs as well as the rifamycin derivatives rifampicin (or rifampin), rifabutin, rifapentine, rifalazil and rifaximin. Rifamycin, sold under the trade name Aemcolo, is approved in the United States for treatment of travelers&#x27; diarrhea in some circumstances.

The name &quot;rifamycin&quot; (originally &quot;rifomycin&quot;) was derived from the 1955 French film &quot;Rififi&quot;.

== Bacterium ==
&quot;Streptomyces mediterranei&quot; was first isolated in 1957 from a soil sample collected near the beach-side town of St Raphael in southern France. The name was originally given by two microbiologists working with the Italian drug company Group Lepetit SpA in Milan, the Italian Grazia Beretta, and Pinhas Margalith of Israel.

In 1969, the bacterium was renamed &quot;Nocardia mediterranei&quot; when another scientist named Thiemann found that it has a cell wall typical of the Nocardia species. Then, in 1986, the bacterium was renamed again &quot;Amycolatopsis mediterranei&quot;, as the first species of a new genus, because a scientist named Lechevalier discovered that the cell wall lacks mycolic acid and is not able to be infected by the Nocardia and Rhodococcus phages.
Based on 16S ribosomal RNA sequences, Bala et al. renamed the species in 2004 &quot;Amycolatopsis rifamycinica&quot;.

== First drugs ==
Rifamycins were first isolated in 1957 from a fermentation culture of &quot;Streptomyces mediterranei&quot; at the laboratory of Gruppo Lepetit SpA in Milan by two scientist named Piero Sensi and Maria Teresa Timbal, working with the Israeli scientist Pinhas Margalith. Initially, a family of closely related antibiotics was discovered referred to as Rifamycin A, B, C, D, E. The only component of this mixture sufficiently stable to isolate in a pure form was Rifamycin B, which unfortunately was poorly active. However, further studies showed that while Rifamycin B was essentially inactive, it was spontaneously oxidized and hydrolyzed in aqueous solutions to yield the highly active Rifamycin S. Simple reduction of Rifamycin S yielded the hydroquinone form called Rifamycin SV, which became the first member of this class to enter clinical use as an intravenous antibiotic. Further chemical modification of Rifamycin SV yielded an improved analog Rifamide, which was also introduced into clinical practice, but was similarly limited to intravenous use. After an extensive modification program, Rifampin was eventually produced, which is orally available and has become a mainstay of Tuberculosis therapy
Lepetit filed for patent protection of Rifamycin B in the UK in August 1958, and in the US in March 1959. The British patent GB921045 was granted in March 1963, and U.S. Patent 3,150,046 was granted in September 1964. The drug is widely regarded as having helped conquer the issue of drug-resistant tuberculosis in the 1960s.

== Clinical trials ==
Rifamycins have been used for the treatment of many diseases, the most important one being HIV-related tuberculosis. A systematic review of clinical trials on alternative regimens for prevention of active tuberculosis in HIV-negative individuals with latent TB found that a weekly, directly observed regimen of rifapentine with isoniazid for three months was as effective as a daily, self-administered regimen of isoniazid for nine months. But the rifapentine-isoniazid regimen had higher rates of treatment completion and lower rates of hepatotoxicity. However, the rate of treatment-limiting adverse events was higher in the rifapentine-isoniazid regimen.

The rifamycins have a unique mechanism of action, selectively inhibiting bacterial DNA-dependent RNA polymerase, and show no cross-resistance with other antibiotics in clinical use. However, despite their activity against bacteria resistant to other antibiotics, the rifamycins themselves suffer from a rather high frequency of resistance. Because of this, Rifampin and other rifamycins are typically used in combination with other antibacterial drugs. This is routinely practiced in TB therapy and serves to prevent the formation of mutants that are resistant to any of the drugs in the combination. Rifampin rapidly kills fast-dividing bacilli strains as well as &quot;persisters&quot; cells, which remain biologically inactive for long periods of time that allow them to evade antibiotic activity. In addition, rifabutin and rifapentine have both been used against tuberculosis acquired in HIV-positive patients. Although Tuberculosis therapy remains the most important use of Rifampin, an increasing problem with serious Multiple Drug Resistant bacterial infections has led to some use of antibiotic combinations containing Rifampin to treat them.

== Mechanism of action ==
The antibacterial activity of rifamycins relies on the inhibition of bacterial DNA-dependent RNA synthesis. This is due to the high affinity of rifamycins for the prokaryotic RNA polymerase. The selectivity of the rifamycins depends on the fact that they have a very poor affinity for the analogous mammalian enzyme. Crystal structure data of the antibiotic bound to RNA polymerase indicates that rifamycin blocks synthesis by causing strong steric clashes with the growing oligonucleotide (&quot;steric-occlusion&quot; mechanism). If rifamycin binds the polymerase after the chain extension process has started, no inhibition is observed on the biosynthesis, consistent with a steric-occlusion mechanism. Single step high level resistance to the rifamycins occurs as the result of a single amino acid change in the bacterial DNA dependent RNA polymerase.

== Biosynthesis ==
The first information on the biosynthesis of the rifamycins came from studies using the stable isotope Carbon-13 and NMR spectroscopy to establish the origin of the carbon skeleton. These studies showed that the ansa chain was derived from acetate and propionate, in common with other polyketide antibiotics. The naphthalenic chromophore was shown to derive from a propionate unit coupled with a seven carbon amino moiety of unknown origin. The general scheme of biosynthesis starts with the uncommon starting unit, 3-amino-5-hydroxybenzoic acid (AHBA), via type I polyketide pathway (PKS I) in which chain extension is performed using 2 acetate and 8 propionate units. AHBA is believed to have originated from the Shikimate pathway, however this was not incorporated into the biosynthetic mechanism. This is due to the observation that 3 amino-acid analogues converted into AHBA in cell-free extracts of &quot;A. mediterranei&quot;.

The &quot;rif&quot; cluster is responsible for the biosynthesis of rifamycins. It contains genes &#x27; through &#x27;, which were shown to biosynthesize AHBA.[10] &#x27;, &#x27;, &#x27;, and &#x27; are believed to act as transaminases in order to form the AHBA precursor kanosamine. &quot;RifH&quot; encodes aminoDAHP synthase that catalyzes the condensation between 1-deoxy-1-imino-d-erythrose 4-phosphate and phosphoenolpyruvate. &#x27; through &#x27; encode a type I polyketide synthase module, with the loading module being a non-ribosomal peptide synthetase. In all, &#x27; assemble a linear undecaketide and are followed by &#x27;, which encodes an amide synthase and causes the undecaketide to release and form a macrolactam structure. Moreover, the &quot;rif&quot; cluster contains various regulatory proteins and glycosylating genes that appear to be silent. Other types of genes seem to perform post-synthase modifications of the original polyketide.

== Derivatives ==
Lepetit introduced Rifampicin, an orally active rifamycin, in 1966. Rifabutin, a derivative of rifamycin S, was invented by Italian drug manufacturer Achifar in 1975 and came onto the US market in 1992. Hoechst Marion Roussel (now part of Aventis) introduced rifapentine to the US market in 1998, with Achifar having synthesized it in 1965. Use of rifapentine remains uncommon as a treatment for pulmonary tuberculosis, and treatment with rifapentine is given on the basis of careful selection of patients.

Rifaximin is an oral rifamycin marketed in the US by Salix Pharmaceuticals that is poorly absorbed from the intestine. It has been used to treat hepatic encephalopathy and traveler&#x27;s diarrhea.

<doc id="928134" wikidata="Q300447" url="?curid=928134" title="A Kind of Magic">
<text>A Kind of Magic is the twelfth studio album by the British rock band Queen, released on 2 June 1986 by EMI Records in the UK and by Capitol Records in the US. It is based on the soundtrack to the film &quot;Highlander&quot;, directed by Russell Mulcahy.

&quot;A Kind of Magic&quot; was Queen&#x27;s first album to be released since they had received acclaim for their performance at Live Aid in 1985. It was an immediate hit in the UK, going straight to number one and selling 100,000 copies in its first week. It remained in the UK charts for 63 weeks, selling 600,000 in the UK alone. The album spawned four hit singles: the album&#x27;s title track &quot;A Kind of Magic&quot;, &quot;One Vision&quot;, &quot;Friends Will Be Friends&quot;, and &quot;Who Wants to Live Forever&quot;, which features an orchestra conducted by Michael Kamen, while the album&#x27;s final track, &quot;Princes of the Universe&quot;, is the theme song to &quot;Highlander&quot;.

Although Queen would release another two albums with Freddie Mercury still alive, &quot;A Kind of Magic&quot; would turn out to be his last album promoted with a concert tour, due to his diagnosis with AIDS the following year.

==Background and recording—&quot;A Kind of Magic&quot; and &quot;Highlander&quot;==
The album enjoys the status of an unofficial soundtrack for the 1986 film &quot;Highlander&quot;, for which no official soundtrack album was released. The title, &quot;A Kind of Magic&quot;, derived from one of the lines character Connor MacLeod (Christopher Lambert) says to describe his immortality. Six out of nine songs on the album appeared in the film, although in different versions. The three songs that did not appear in &quot;Highlander&quot; are &quot;Pain Is So Close to Pleasure&quot;, &quot;Friends Will Be Friends&quot; and &quot;One Vision&quot;, which was featured a year earlier in the film &quot;Iron Eagle&quot;. Conversely, a recording of &quot;Theme from New York, New York&quot; made specifically for a scene in &quot;Highlander&quot; does not appear on &quot;A Kind of Magic&quot;, and in fact has never been released in album form to date. Band member Brian May, according to a statement he made on the &quot;Greatest Video Hits 2&quot; DVD (2003), had, at least at that point, the intention to work on a proper &quot;Highlander&quot; soundtrack in the future. In one scene, a snippet of &quot;Hammer to Fall&quot; plays on a radio, a song from the previously released &quot;The Works&quot; album.

==Songs==
===Side one===
====&quot;One Vision&quot;====

After Queen&#x27;s contribution to Live Aid, Freddie Mercury was enthusiastic about the band and soon after called them to go to the studio and write a song together which became &quot;One Vision&quot;. All four band members were credited as songwriters; however, Roger Taylor stated in an interview with Australian TV that originally it had been his song, with lyrics reflecting Martin Luther King Jr. He joked that &quot;that rotter Freddie&quot; changed all his lyrics with additions like &quot;one shrimp, one prawn, one clam, one chicken&quot;, and even name-checked John Deacon. Brian May played the opening synth section using a Yamaha DX-7. The sessions were filmed and later released on the 2003 DVD set &quot;Greatest Video Hits 2&quot;. The song does not appear in &quot;Highlander&quot;, but was used in the 1986 movie &quot;Iron Eagle&quot;.

====&quot;A Kind of Magic&quot;====

&quot;A Kind of Magic&quot; was written by Taylor. He has admitted writing down some lyrics, which proved to be the basis for both &quot;One Vision&quot; and &quot;A Kind of Magic&quot;, something made obvious by the demo of the song appearing for the first time on the 2011 Universal bonus EP, which mixes some lyrics. Later on, unbeknownst to Taylor who had gone to the US for a few days, Mercury took it over, &quot;polished&quot; the lyrics, added the bassline, some connectors and re-arranged the structure. Regardless, the new, more pop-oriented version was still credited to Taylor. It was this version that was featured on the album, released as a single and included their auxiliary live musician, Spike Edney, playing some keyboards. The heavier, rockier alternate version, also making its official debut on the 2011 Universal bonus EP, played during the end credits of &quot;Highlander&quot;. The song was covered by Elaine Paige in 1988 on her album called &quot;The Queen Album&quot;.

====&quot;One Year of Love&quot;====

&quot;One Year of Love&quot; is a song by John Deacon. The album version features him playing Yamaha DX7 synth, a string orchestra conducted by Lynton Naiff and a saxophone played by Steve Gregory. Deacon decided to substitute the guitar components with a saxophone solo after a discussion with May, who does not appear in the song. It was released as a single only in France and Spain, and appeared during a bar scene and an instrumental piano version appeared in a scene where Connor Macleod was in Brenda Wyatt&#x27;s apartment in &quot;Highlander&quot;. It was also covered by Elaine Paige on &quot;The Queen Album&quot; in 1988 and later by Dutch singer Stevie Ann in 2006.

====&quot;Pain Is So Close to Pleasure&quot;====

&quot;Pain Is So Close to Pleasure&quot; was written by Mercury and Deacon. Beginning as a riff idea by May, Deacon and Mercury subsequently turned that into a Motown-style song, with Deacon playing rhythm guitar. A slightly remixed and reworked version was released as a single in 1986, reaching No. 26 on the Dutch charts. The title also appears as a line in &quot;One Year of Love&quot;.

====&quot;Friends Will Be Friends&quot;====

&quot;Friends Will Be Friends&quot; is a song by Mercury and Deacon, with lyrics written by Mercury. It is one of the last of Mercury&#x27;s piano ballads, and bears some similarity to &quot;Play the Game&quot; and &quot;We Are the Champions&quot;. It did not feature in &quot;Highlander&quot;. It was noted as being a modern update of the 1970s Queen rock anthems &quot;We Are the Champions&quot; and &quot;We Will Rock You&quot;, and reached No. 14 in the UK. During the Magic Tour, the song was played between &quot;We Will Rock You&quot; and &quot;We Are The Champions&quot;, the traditional closing songs of Queen live performances.

===Side two===
====&quot;Who Wants to Live Forever&quot;====

&quot;Who Wants to Live Forever&quot; was composed by May, and sung in the album version as a duet between himself and Mercury. Synthesizer parts are played on a Yamaha DX-7 by May, and the orchestra was arranged and conducted by Michael Kamen. Deacon did not participate, and Taylor played some drum-machine parts and contributed backing vocals. Percussion was taken over by the orchestra as well as double bass, in spite of Taylor and Deacon miming those parts respectively in the video. It serves as somewhat of a &quot;love theme&quot; of &quot;Highlander&quot;, as it adds to the sub-plot of the movie. In the film, Mercury sings the opening of the song as well, unlike the album version, which has May singing.

====&quot;Gimme the Prize (Kurgan&#x27;s Theme)&quot;====
&quot;Gimme the Prize&quot; was written by May. This song is widely known for its heavy metal features. It is featured in &quot;Highlander&quot;, and also samples various lines from the film, most notably &quot;I have something to say: It&#x27;s better to burn out than to fade away&quot; and &quot;There can be only one&quot;, spoken by actors Clancy Brown (The Kurgan) and Christopher Lambert (Connor MacLeod) respectively. Director Russell Mulcahy states in the DVD commentary that this was his least favourite of the band&#x27;s songs used in the film because he does not like heavy metal. May also commented to a Japanese magazine in 1986 that both Mercury and Deacon hated the song.

====&quot;Don&#x27;t Lose Your Head&quot;====
&quot;Don&#x27;t Lose Your Head&quot; was composed by Taylor and features singer Joan Armatrading in a vocal cameo. The song takes its name from a line spoken in &quot;Highlander&quot;, and is played for a short time when Kurgan kidnaps Brenda. The song then segues into a cover of &quot;Theme from &quot;New York, New York&quot;&quot;, though it is only a small clip. It is also featured in an episode of &quot;&quot; titled &quot;&quot;. An instrumental version of the track entitled &quot;A Dozen Red Roses for My Darling&quot; is featured as the B-side to &quot;A Kind of Magic&quot;.

====&quot;Princes of the Universe&quot;====

&quot;Princes of the Universe&quot; is the film&#x27;s theme song and the only song on the album for which Mercury received sole credit. It is quite a complex and heavy work, showing Queen returning to their hard rock roots. The song is played in the opening credits of &quot;Highlander&quot;. The music video uses clips and scenery from the movie, as well as a cameo by Christopher Lambert, who fights with Mercury on part of the film set at Elstree Studios, London on 14 February 1986. The song&#x27;s name comes from the original working title of the film.

==Singles==
* Queen recorded &quot;One Vision&quot;, released in the UK on 4 November 1985, the first after their much-lauded appearance at the Live Aid concert. It did well on the charts, reaching No. 7 in the UK and making the top ten throughout Europe. The song appeared in &quot;Iron Eagle&quot;.

==Reception==
&quot;Rolling Stone&quot; described the album as &quot;heavy plastic&quot;, concluding: &quot;This band might as well put some pomp back in its rock. Its members are never going to make it as dignified elder statesmen&quot;. &quot;The Times&quot; described the album as one of &quot;the most spectacularly successful releases this year&quot;, yet questioned its appeal, asking, &quot;why does it not extend to those of us who are given the records to review?&quot; &quot;People Weekly&quot; wrote: &quot;There&#x27;s hardly a personal expression, let alone an intimate one, in this album... The group can be dazzling. In this case they&#x27;re just overbearing&quot;. &quot;Kerrang!&quot;″s Paul Henderson wondered &quot;how much of the album is the &#x27;real&#x27; Queen and how much is the result of the constraints/musical slant imposed upon them by writing material to go with a movie&quot;, concluding that &quot;only a band of Queen&#x27;s stature (...) could put out an album of such diverse songs without disappointing a sizeable portion of their fans&quot;.

In a retrospective review, Greg Prato of AllMusic wrote: &quot;It may not have been as cohesive as some of their other albums, but &quot;A Kind of Magic&quot; was their best work in some time&quot;. Queen biographer Mark Blake wrote: &quot;The album&#x27;s confused origins made for a somewhat uneven listening experience... only the title cut and &#x27;Who Wants to Live Forever&#x27; were songs that would survive the album&#x27;s natural shelf life. Like every Queen record since &quot;Jazz&quot;, &quot;A Kind of Magic&quot; was a so-so album, cleverly loaded with two or three potential hit singles&quot;.

In the 1994 edition of &quot;The Guinness All Time Top 1000 Albums&quot;, the album was voted  171 in the all-time greatest rock and pop albums. In 2006, a national BBC poll saw the album voted the 42nd-greatest album of all time. In 2007, &quot;Classic Rock&quot; ranked &quot;A Kind of Magic&quot; the 28th-greatest soundtrack album of all time.

<doc id="928136" wikidata="Q1427090" url="?curid=928136" title="Flandy Limpele">
<text>Flandy Limpele (born 9 February 1974) is an Indonesian former badminton player and coach. He competed in four Summer Olympic Games: Atlanta 1996, Sydney 2000, Athens 2004, and Beijing 2008.

== Career ==
===Player===
A doubles specialist, at various times Limpele has focused on either men&#x27;s doubles or mixed doubles during his long career in international badminton. His earliest appearances in the final rounds of major events came in mixed doubles in the mid-1990s. However, he first broke through internationally in men&#x27;s doubles at the 1999 Korea Open with Eng Hian. His subsequent men&#x27;s doubles titles, most of them with Hian, have included the Denmark (2000), Singapore (2002, 2006), Japan (2002), Bitburger (2002), and German (2003) Opens, and the Copenhagen Masters (2000, 2004). Hian and Limpele briefly represented England from 2001 until 2003. They later returned to represent Indonesia for 2004 Summer Olympics. Flandy and Eng were runners-up at the prestigious All-England Championships in 2002, and bronze medalists at the 2004 Athens Olympics.

After 2004 Limpele gravitated back to mixed doubles. In 2006 he teamed with Vita Marissa to win a number of top tier events including the Singapore, Japan, French, and Chinese Taipei Opens, as well as the Southeast Asian Games title. They were bronze medalists at the 2007 World Championships in Kuala Lumpur, and won the Badminton Asia Championships together in 2008.

Not an especially powerful hitter, Limpele&#x27;s strengths have been his racket-work, tactical astuteness, and anticipation.

===Coaching===
Flandy appointed as Malaysian men&#x27;s doubles coach in 2020, replacing Paulus Firman.

===Participation at Indonesian Team===
* 5 times at Sudirman Cup (1997, 1999, 2001, 2005, 2007)
* 1 time at Thomas Cup (2004)

== Personal life ==
When he was young, he joined the SGS Bandung badminton club. His parents are Erik Limpele (father) and Nelcy Oroh (mother). His hobby is football. Normally people called him Flandy.

<doc id="928146" wikidata="Q422652" url="?curid=928146" title="Rifampicin">
<text>Rifampicin, also known as rifampin, is an ansamycin antibiotic used to treat several types of bacterial infections, including tuberculosis (TB), &quot;Mycobacterium avium&quot; complex, leprosy, and Legionnaires&#x27; disease. It is almost always used together with other antibiotics with two notable exceptions: when given as a &quot;preferred treatment that is strongly recommended&quot; for latent TB infection; and when used as post-exposure prophylaxis to prevent &quot;Haemophilus influenzae&quot; type b and meningococcal disease in people who have been exposed to those bacteria. Before treating a person for a long period of time, measurements of liver enzymes and blood counts are recommended. Rifampicin may be given either by mouth or intravenously.
Common side effects include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and loss of appetite. It often turns urine, sweat, and tears a red or orange color. Liver problems or allergic reactions may occur. It is part of the recommended treatment of active tuberculosis during pregnancy, though its safety in pregnancy is not known. Rifampicin is of the rifamycin group of antibiotics. It works by decreasing the production of RNA by bacteria.
Rifampicin was discovered in 1965, marketed in Italy in 1968, and approved in the United States in 1971. It is on the World Health Organization&#x27;s List of Essential Medicines. The World Health Organization classifies rifampicin as critically important for human medicine. It is available as a generic medication. Rifampicin is made by the soil bacterium &quot;Amycolatopsis rifamycinica&quot;.

== Medical uses ==
=== Mycobacteria ===
Rifampicin is used for the treatment of tuberculosis in combination with other antibiotics, such as pyrazinamide, isoniazid, and ethambutol. For the treatment of tuberculosis, it is administered daily for at least six months. Combination therapy is used to prevent the development of resistance and to shorten the length of treatment. Resistance of &quot;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&quot; to rifampicin develops quickly when it is used without another antibiotic, with laboratory estimates of resistance rates from 10−7 to 10−10 per tuberculosis bacterium per generation.

Rifampicin can be used alone in patients with latent tuberculosis infections to prevent or delay the development of active disease because only small numbers of bacteria are present. A Cochrane review found no difference in efficacy between a 3- to 4-month regimen of rifampicin and a 6-month regimen of isoniazid for preventing active tuberculosis in patients not infected with HIV, and patients who received rifampicin had a lower rate of hepatotoxicity. However, the quality of the evidence was judged to be low. A shorter 2-month course of rifampicin and pyrazinamide had previously been recommended but is no longer recommended due to high rates of hepatotoxicity.

Rifampicin should be taken on an empty stomach with a glass of water. It is generally taken either at least one hour before meals or two hours after meals.

Rifampicin is also used to treat nontuberculous mycobacterial infections including leprosy (Hansen&#x27;s disease) and &quot;Mycobacterium kansasii&quot;.

With multidrug therapy used as the standard treatment of Hansen&#x27;s disease, rifampicin is always used in combination with dapsone and clofazimine to avoid causing drug resistance.

It is also used in the treatment of &quot;Mycobacterium ulcerans&quot; infections as associated with Buruli ulcer, usually in combination with clarithromycin or other antibiotics.

=== Other bacteria and protozoans ===
In 2008, tentative evidence showed rifampicin may be useful in the treatment of methicillin-resistant &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot; (MRSA) in combination with other antibiotics, including in difficult-to-treat infections such as osteomyelitis and prosthetic joint infections. As of 2012, if rifampicin combination therapy was useful for pyogenic vertebral osteomyelitis was unclear. A meta-analysis concluded that adding adjunctive rifampicin to a β-lactam or vancomycin may improve outcomes in staphylococcus aureus bacteremia. However, a more recent trial found no benefit from adjunctive rifampicin.

It is also used as preventive treatment against &quot;Neisseria meningitidis&quot; (meningococcal) infections. Rifampicin is also recommended as an alternative treatment for infections by the tick-borne pathogens &quot;Borrelia burgdorferi&quot; and &quot;Anaplasma phagocytophilum&quot; when treatment with doxycycline is contraindicated, such as in pregnant women or in patients with a history of allergy to tetracycline antibiotics.

It is also sometimes used to treat infections by &quot;Listeria&quot; species, &quot;Neisseria gonorrhoeae&quot;, &quot;Haemophilus influenzae&quot;, and &quot;Legionella pneumophila&quot;. For these nonstandard indications, antimicrobial susceptibility testing should be done (if possible) before starting rifampicin therapy.

The Enterobacteriaceae, &quot;Acinetobacter&quot; species, and &quot;Pseudomonas&quot; species are intrinsically resistant to rifampicin.

It has been used with amphotericin B in largely unsuccessful attempts to treat primary amoebic meningoencephalitis caused by &quot;Naegleria fowleri&quot;.

Rifampicin can be used as monotherapy for a few days as prophylaxis against meningitis, but resistance develops quickly during long-term treatment of active infections, so the drug is always used against active infections in combination with other antibiotics.

Rifampicin is relatively ineffective against spirochetes, which has led to its use as a selective agent capable of isolating them in materials being cultured in laboratories.

=== Viruses ===
Rifampicin has some effectiveness against vaccinia virus.

=== Pathogen susceptibility ===
The minimum inhibitory concentrations of rifampicin for several medically significant pathogens are:
* &quot;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&quot; — 0.002 – 64 μg/mL
* &quot;Mycobacterium bovis&quot; — 0.125 μg/mL
* &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot; (methicillin resistant) — ≤ 0.006–256 μg/mL
* &quot;Chlamydia pneumoniae&quot; — 0.005 μg/mL

===Primary biliary cholangitis===

Rifampicin is used to treat itchiness caused by primary biliary cholangitis. The treatment-related adverse effects include hepatotoxicity, nephrotoxicity, hemolysis, and interactions with other drugs. For those reasons as well as some ethical concerns regarding off-label use of antibiotics, rifampin as a very effective preventive antibiotic for meningitis, is not considered appropriate for itchiness.

=== Hidradenitis suppurativa ===
Rifampicin with clindamycin has been used to treat the skin disease hidradenitis suppurativa.

== Adverse effects ==
The most serious adverse effect is hepatotoxicity, and people receiving it often undergo baseline and frequent liver function tests to detect early liver damage.

The more common side effects include fever, gastrointestinal disturbances, rashes, and immunological reactions. Taking rifampicin usually causes certain bodily fluids, such as urine, sweat, and tears, to become orange-red in color, a benign side effect that nonetheless can be frightening if it is not expected. This may also be used to monitor effective absorption of the drug (if drug color is not seen in the urine, the patient may wish to move the drug dose farther in time from food or milk intake). The discolorization of sweat and tears is not directly noticeable, but sweat may stain light clothing orange, and tears may permanently stain soft contact lenses. Since rifampicin may be excreted in breast milk, breastfeeding should be avoided while it is being taken.

Other adverse effects include:
* Liver toxicity—hepatitis, liver failure in severe cases
* Respiratory—breathlessness
* Cutaneous—flushing, pruritus, rash, hyperpigmentation, redness and watering of eyes
* Abdominal — nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramps, diarrhea
* Flu-like symptoms—chills, fever, headache, arthralgia, and malaise. Rifampicin has good penetration into the brain, and this may directly explain some malaise and dysphoria in a minority of users.
* Allergic reaction—rashes, itching, swelling of the tongue or throat, severe dizziness, and trouble breathing

== Chemical structure ==
Rifampicin is a polyketide belonging to the chemical class of compounds termed ansamycins, so named because of their heterocyclic structure containing a naphthoquinone core spanned by an aliphatic ansa chain. The naphthoquinonic chromophore gives rifampicin its characteristic red-orange crystalline color.

The critical functional groups of rifampicin in its inhibitory binding of bacterial RNA polymerase are the four critical hydroxyl groups of the ansa bridge and the naphthol ring, which form hydrogen bonds with amino acid residues on the protein.

Rifampicin is the derivative of rifamycin SV.

== Interactions ==
Rifampicin is the most powerful known inducer of the hepatic cytochrome P450 enzyme system, including isoenzymes CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP3A4, CYP3A5, and CYP3A7. It increases metabolism of many drugs and as a consequence, can make them less effective, or even ineffective, by decreasing their levels. For instance, patients undergoing long-term anticoagulation therapy with warfarin have to increase their dosage of warfarin and have their clotting time checked frequently because failure to do so could lead to inadequate anticoagulation, resulting in serious consequences of thromboembolism.

Rifampicin can reduce the efficacy of birth control pills or other hormonal contraception by its induction of the cytochrome P450 system, to the extent that unintended pregnancies have occurred in women who use oral contraceptives and took rifampicin even for very short courses (for example, as prophylaxis against exposure to bacterial meningitis).

Other interactions include decreased levels and less effectiveness of antiretroviral agents, everolimus, atorvastatin, rosiglitazone, pioglitazone, celecoxib, clarithromycin, caspofungin, voriconazole, and lorazepam.

Rifampicin is antagonistic to the microbiologic effects of the antibiotics gentamicin and amikacin. The activity of rifampicin against some species of mycobacteria can be potentiated by isoniazid (through inhibiting mycolate synthesis) and ambroxol (through host directed effects in autophagy and pharmacokinetics).

== Pharmacology ==

=== Mechanism of action ===

Rifampicin inhibits bacterial DNA-dependent RNA synthesis by inhibiting bacterial DNA-dependent RNA polymerase.

Crystal structure data and biochemical data suggest that rifampicin binds to the pocket of the RNA polymerase β subunit within the DNA/RNA channel, but away from the active site. The inhibitor prevents RNA synthesis by physically blocking elongation, and thus preventing synthesis of host bacterial proteins. By this &quot;steric-occlusion&quot; mechanism, rifampicin blocks synthesis of the second or third phosphodiester bond between the nucleotides in the RNA backbone, preventing elongation of the 5&#x27; end of the RNA transcript past more than two or three nucleotides.

In a recent study rifampicin was shown to bind to cytochrome P450 reductase and alter its conformation as well as activity towards supporting metabolism of progesterone via CYP21A2.

=== Mechanism of resistance ===
Resistance to rifampicin arises from mutations that alter residues of the rifampicin binding site on RNA polymerase, resulting in decreased affinity for rifampicin. Resistance mutations map to the &quot;rpoB&quot; gene, encoding the beta subunit of RNA polymerase. The majority of resistance mutations in &quot;E. coli&quot; are in 3 clusters on &quot;rpoB&quot;. Cluster I is amino acids 509 to 533, cluster II is amino acids 563 to 572, and cluster III is amino acid 687.

When describing mutations in &quot;rpoB&quot; in other species, the corresponding amino acid number in &quot;E. coli&quot; is usually used. In &quot;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&quot;, the majority of mutations leading to rifampicin resistance are in cluster I, in a 81bp hotspot core region called RRDR for &quot;rifampcin resistance determining region&quot;. A change in amino acid 531 from serine to leucine arising from a change in the DNA sequence of TCG to TTG is the most common mutation. Tuberculosis resistance has also occurred due to mutations in the N-terminal region of &quot;rpoB&quot; and cluster III.

An alternative mechanism of resistance is through Arr-catalyzed ADP-ribosylation of rifampicin. With the assistance of the enzyme Arr produced by the pathogen &quot;Mycobacterium smegmatis,&quot; ADP-ribose is added to rifampicin at one of its ansa chain hydroxy groups, thereby inactivating the drug.

=== Resistance in tuberculosis ===
Mycobacterial resistance to rifampicin may occur alone or along with resistance to other first-line antitubercular drugs. Early detection of such multidrug or extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis is critical in improving patient outcomes by instituting appropriate second-line treatments, and in decreasing transmission of drug-resistant TB. Traditional methods of detecting resistance involve mycobacterial culture and drug susceptibility testing, results of which could take up to 6 weeks. Xpert MTB/RIF assay is an automated test that can detect rifampicin resistance, and also diagnose tuberculosis. A Cochrane review updated in 2014 and 2021 concluded that for rifampicin resistance detection, Xpert MTB/RIF was accurate, that is (95%) sensitive and (98%) specific.

===Pharmacokinetics===
Orally administered rifampicin results in peak plasma concentrations in about 2–4 hours. 4-Aminosalicylic acid (another antituberculosis drug) significantly reduces absorption of rifampicin, and peak concentrations may be lower. If these two drugs must be used concurrently, they must be given separately, with an interval of 8 to 12 hours between administrations.

Rifampicin is easily absorbed from the gastrointestinal (GI) tract; its ester functional group is quickly hydrolyzed in bile, and it is catalyzed by a high pH and substrate-specific esterases. After about 6 hours, almost all of the drug is deacetylated. Even in this deacetylated form, rifampicin is still a potent antibiotic; however, it can no longer be reabsorbed by the intestines and is eliminated from the body. Only about 7% of the administered drug is excreted unchanged in urine, though urinary elimination accounts for only about 30% of the drug excretion. About 60% to 65% is excreted through feces.

The half-life of rifampicin ranges from 1.5 to 5.0 hours, though hepatic impairment significantly increases it. Food consumption inhibits its absorption from the GI tract, and the drug is more quickly eliminated. When rifampicin is taken with a meal, its peak blood concentration falls by 36%. Antacids do not affect its absorption. The decrease in rifampicin absorption with food is sometimes enough to noticeably affect urine color, which can be used as a marker for whether or not a dose of the drug has been effectively absorbed.

Distribution of the drug is high throughout the body, and reaches effective concentrations in many organs and body fluids, including the cerebrospinal fluid. Since the substance itself is red, this high distribution is the reason for the orange-red color of the saliva, tears, sweat, urine, and feces. About 60% to 90% of the drug is bound to plasma proteins.
== Use in biotechnology ==
Rifampicin inhibits bacterial RNA polymerase, and is commonly used to inhibit the synthesis of host bacterial proteins during recombinant protein expression in bacteria. RNA encoding for the recombinant gene is usually transcribed from DNA by a viral T7 RNA polymerase, which is not affected by rifampicin.

== History ==
In 1957, a soil sample from a pine forest on the French Riviera was brought for analysis to the Lepetit Pharmaceuticals research lab in Milan, Italy. There, a research group headed by Piero Sensi and Maria Teresa Timbal discovered a new bacterium, Nocardia mediterranei. Nocardia mediterranei produces a class of previously unknown molecules with antibiotic activity. Because Sensi, Timbal and the researchers were particularly fond of the French crime story &quot;Rififi&quot; (about a jewel heist and rival gangs), they decided to call these compounds rifamycins. Derivatives of one molecule, rifamycin B, which itself possess minimal antibiotic activity yielded several highly active antibiotics, one of the earliest which was used as a medicine being rifamycin SV, which was introduced in some countries for the parenteral and topical treatment of infections due to gram-positive bacteria and infections of the biliary tract. After two years of attempts to obtain more stable semisynthetic products, a new molecule with high efficacy and good tolerability was produced in 1965 and was named rifampicin.

Rifampicin was first sold in Italy in 1968 and was approved by the FDA in 1971.

== Society and culture ==
===Cancer-causing impurities===

In August 2020, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) became aware of nitrosamine impurities in certain samples of rifampin. The FDA and manufacturers are investigating the origin of these impurities in rifampin, and the agency is developing testing methods for regulators and industry to detect the (MNP). MNP belongs to the nitrosamine class of compounds, some of which are classified as probable or possible human carcinogens (substances that could cause cancer), based on laboratory tests such as rodent carcinogenicity studies. Although there are no data available to directly evaluate the carcinogenic potential of MNP, information available on closely related nitrosamine compounds was used to calculate lifetime exposure limits for MNP.

As of January 2021, the FDA continues to investigate the presence of (MNP) in rifampin or (CPNP) in rifapentine approved for sale in the US.

=== Names ===
Rifampicin is the INN and BAN, while rifampin is the USAN. Rifampicin may be abbreviated R, RMP, RA, RF, or RIF (US).

Rifampicin is also known as rifaldazine, rofact, and rifampin in the United States, also as rifamycin SV.

Its chemical name is .

Rifampicin is available under many brand names worldwide.

<doc id="928150" wikidata="Q859763" url="?curid=928150" title="Bigsby vibrato tailpiece">
<text>The Bigsby vibrato tailpiece (or Bigsby for short) is a type of mechanical vibrato device for electric guitar designed by Paul Bigsby and produced by the Bigsby Electric Guitar Company (currently an independently operated subsidiary of Fender Musical Instruments Corporation). The device allows musicians to bend the pitch of notes or entire chords with their pick hand for various effects.

Bigsby was inspired to create a new vibrato system after being tasked by Merle Travis to repair the Kauffman Vibrola on his Gibson L-10. The Bigsby system would debut in 1951, with the first example going to Travis. By the mid-1950s, Bigsby had ceased production of his own guitars and began only producing a range of vibrato tailpieces.

==Design==
The Bigsby vibrato unit is installed on the top of the guitar and includes a &#x27;rocking bridge&#x27;, not a &#x27;roller bridge&#x27;. The lever arm of the Bigsby is spring-loaded and attached to a pivoting metal bar, around which the strings of the guitar are installed. In the neutral or unused position, the pressure of the spring counterbalances the pull of the strings, resulting in constant pitch when the strings are played. When the arm of the Bigsby is pushed down towards the top of the guitar, the bridge rocks forward causing the strings to loosen, lowering their pitch. When the arm is released, the strings return to normal pitch. The arm may also be lifted to raise the pitch of the strings. The Bigsby is highly controllable within its range of motion and usually requires little force to operate. It is ideally suited to musicians who use slow, subtle, or extended bends. It has limited range compared to vibrato units using longer springs contained internally. Competing units, like the Floyd Rose and the Fender &quot;synchronized tremolo&quot; (or strat-style) are therefore preferred by some players.

Bigsby vibratos are still factory-installed on a variety of electric guitars, including certain instruments branded as PRS (Starla), Epiphone, Fender, Gibson, Gretsch, Guild, Hamer, Ibanez, and Schecter Guitar Research, as well as luthiers companies such as MotorAve. Many electric guitars can also be retrofitted with a Bigsby, which requires no additional routing, but may require additional holes to be drilled. Adapters, such as the models sold by Vibramate, can be used to install a Bigsby Vibrato on a guitar without drilling any holes. Variations in guitars, such as between flat top and archtop, require different models of Bigsby.

==Ownership==
Bigsby was sold by its previous owner, Gretsch, to Fender Musical Instruments Corporation in January 2019.

<doc id="928166" wikidata="Q2475745" url="?curid=928166" title="Siberia Airlines Flight 1812">
<text>Siberia Airlines Flight 1812 was a commercial flight shot down by the Ukrainian Air Force over the Black Sea on 4 October 2001, en route from Tel Aviv, Israel, to Novosibirsk, Russia. The aircraft, a Soviet-made Tupolev Tu-154, carried 66 passengers and 12 crew members. Most of the passengers were Israelis visiting relatives in Russia. There were no survivors. The crash site is about 190 km west-southwest of the Black Sea resort of Sochi, 140 km north of the Turkish coastal town of Fatsa and 350 km south-southeast of Feodosiya in Crimea. The crash was caused by a missile launched during joint Ukrainian-Russian military air-defence exercises at the Russian-controlled training ground of the 31st Russian Black Sea Fleet Research center on Cape Opuk near the city of Kerch in Crimea. Ukraine eventually admitted that it might have caused the crash, probably by an errant S-200 missile fired by its armed forces. Ukraine paid $15 million to surviving family members of the 78 victims ($200,000 per victim).

== History ==
Flight 1812 departed Tel Aviv with a destination of Novosibirsk. It proceeded at an altitude of over the Black Sea when the Russian ground control center in Sochi suddenly lost contact with the airliner. Soon afterward, the pilot of an Armenian plane crossing the sea nearby reported seeing the Russian plane explode before it crashed into the sea at about 13:45 Moscow time (09:45 GMT). Most of the passengers were Israelis visiting their relatives in Russia. No one on board survived. 

A national day of mourning was instituted in Israel with a moment of silence, flags at half-mast and schools teaching special lessons on the tragedy. A monument to the victims was built in Ben Shemen forest in Israel.

Occurring less than a month after the September 11 attacks in the United States, the crash was initially suspected by Russian officials to be an act of terrorism, and they denied American reports that it was caused by an S-200 missile.
Later, the Moscow-based Interstate Aviation Committee ruled that the crash was caused by an accidental Ukrainian S-200 missile strike during military training exercises staged off Cape Opuk in Crimea.

Initial private assessments by American military officials determined that the crash was caused by an S-200 missile that had overshot its target drone—which had been destroyed successfully by an S-300 fired at the same time—and instead of self-destructing, locked on the passenger plane about further away and detonated over the plane.

Russian officials dismissed the American claim as &quot;unworthy of attention,&quot; and Russian president Vladimir Putin told the press the next day that &quot;the weapons used in those exercises had such characteristics that make it impossible for them to reach the air corridor through which the plane was moving.&quot; Ukrainian military officials initially denied that their missile had brought down the plane; they reported that the S-200 had been launched seaward and had successfully self-destructed. Defense ministry spokesman Konstantin Khivrenko noted that &quot;neither the direction nor the range (of the missiles) correspond to the practical or theoretical point at which the plane exploded.&quot;

However, some Ukrainian officials later admitted that their military had probably shot down the airliner. Ukrainian officials speculated that water interference caused the missile to veer off course. Ukraine reportedly banned the testing of Buk, S-300 and similar missile systems for a period of seven years following this incident.

On 7 October 2001, it was reported that the main fuselage of the aircraft, believed to contain the black box recorder, was thought to be at a depth of , which was too deep for divers to retrieve.

== Compensation payments ==
=== Israeli citizens ===
On 20 November 2003, an ex gratia compensation agreement was signed between the governments of Ukraine and Israel. It was later ratified by the relatives of the victims. In addition to compensation issues, the agreement stated that &quot;Ukraine is not legally responsible for the accident that occurred to the plane and free of any obligations regarding it.&quot; Commenting on the agreement, Gen. Oleksandr Kuz&#x27;muk, the former minister of defense who lost his job after the accident, told media that &quot;the payments were a humane action, not the admission of guilt.&quot;

=== Russian citizens ===
Ukraine agreed to pay the families of each of the 38 Russian victims the sum of $200,000, the same amount that it had paid to the families of the 40 Israeli victims. The settlement was ratified by the Russian parliament in May 2004 and President Vladimir Putin signed it into law in June 2004.

=== Additional compensation claims ===

==== Pechersk local court ====
Some relatives of the crash victims refused to accept the compensation offered by Ukraine. They brought a civil suit against the Ukrainian government to Pechers&#x27;ky local court in Kyiv. During the court hearings, Ministry of Defence of Ukraine representatives stated that the airplane &quot;could not be brought down by a Ukrainian missile&quot; according to the forensic examination of the plane&#x27;s debris, radar information and technical capabilities of the missiles. They also argued that the Soviet-made identification friend or foe system of the missile in question would have prevented it from striking the Soviet-made airliner. The lawyer representing the plaintiffs argued that the fault of the Ukrainian government was effectively proven by the fact that it had negotiated the compensations for relatives of the Israeli victims.

==== Appeals in courts ====
On 22 August 2007, a Kyiv appeals court dismissed the victims&#x27; relatives&#x27; suit against the defence ministry, ruling that military of Ukraine bore no liability for the accident. The court decision conflicts with report of the IAC group that had investigated the accident on Russia&#x27;s behalf.

==== Siberian Airlines lawsuit ====
Between 2003 and 2005, the Ukrainian government paid $15.6 million in compensation to the relatives of the victims. In 2004, Siberian Airlines filed a lawsuit against the Ministry of Defence of Ukraine and the Ukraine State Treasury at a Kyiv court, seeking more than $15.3 million in compensation for the loss of the jet. However, in September 2011 the Kyiv Interregional Commercial Court of Appeal rejected a compensation claim from Siberian Airlines. An appeal to Kyiv&#x27;s Economic Court of Appeals was rejected in May 2012. The ruling was further upheld in December 2012 by Ukraine&#x27;s Supreme Commercial Court.
, the court proceedings continued, but they were disrupted by the Maidan protests.

<text>Kim Dong-moon (; born 22 September 1975) is a retired South Korean badminton player who won major titles between the mid-1990s and the mid-2000s (decade), and widely regarded as one of finest men&#x27;s doubles and mixed doubles players in badminton history. Kim captured the world attention when he unexpectedly winning the gold medal in the mixed doubles event with Gil Young-ah at the 1996 Atlanta Summer Olympics. On his path to greatness, he won gold medals both in men&#x27;s and mixed doubles at the 1999 World Championships. Kim and Ra Kyung-min, partnered up to become one of the strongest mixed doubles pairings of that time. They did not drop a single match from April to November in 2003. They won 10 straight victorious tournaments: 9 consecutive Grand Prix events and one World Championship title. Their excellent results in 2003 earned Kim and Ra the Eddie Choong Player of the Year award. He captured this award previously by himself in 2002. Despite their domination, the golden couple crashed in the second round against the Danish partnership of Jonas Rasmussen and Rikke Olsen at the 2004 Athens Olympics. Kim however redeemed himself with a gold medal in men&#x27;s doubles with Ha Tae-kwon. After the 2004 Olympics, Kim retired from playing and married his former mixed doubles partner, Ra in 2005. Kim is currently the only South Korean player to have ever won Olympic gold in both the men&#x27;s and mixed doubles events. He was inducted into the BWF Hall of Fame in 2009.

==Career==

<text>The Caproni Ca.37 was a ground attack aircraft designed and built in Italy by Caproni around 1916.

==Design and development==
During 1916 Caproni embarked on the design of a small light ground attack aircraft which followed the design philosophy of its much larger cousins the Ca.3 and Ca.4.

The Ca.37 followed the twin boom layout with central nacelle, which housed the tandem cockpits and the Lancia Tipo 4 6-cylinder in-line piston engine, driving a 2-bladed pusher propeller. The tail-plane spanned across the two tail-booms and mounted two all-flying rudders for yaw control. Twin main-wheel units were strut mounted under each boom which also carried wooden tail-skids.

The front cockpit was to house a gunner with a flexibly mounted machine-gun. Small bombs were also to be carried for trench attacks and anti-personnel attacks.

Limited further development, in the form of streamlined pod and booms, was carried out as the Ca.38, but no production resulted.

==Variants==
;Ca.37: The sole Ca.37 prototype.
;Ca.38:A new-build aircraft, or conversion of the sole Ca.37, with streamlined pod and booms for improved performance, but still no production orders.

<text>Jabil Inc. is an American multinational manufacturing company involved in the design, engineering, and manufacturing of electronic circuit board assemblies and systems, along with supply chain services, primarily serving original equipment manufacturers. It is headquartered in the Gateway area of St. Petersburg, Florida. It is one of the largest companies in the Tampa Bay area.

==History==
Founded in 1966 in the Detroit area, Jabil initially focused on circuit board assembly production and repair for Control Data Systems. The company name, Jabil, derives from the combination of the first names of its founders, James Golden and Bill Morean. After Golden exited the business, Bill Morean&#x27;s son, William, joined the company and gradually began to shape its direction by signing new contracts, including an offer to purchase a majority stake in the company.

In 1979, Jabil established a high-volume manufacturing partnership with General Motors (GM), moving towards automated manufacturing and advanced assembly technology.

In 1981, Jabil introduced independent test engineering and development services. A year later, the company started volume production of circuit boards with manual surface-mount technology (SMT) processes. By 1984, Jabil had implemented computer-aided design services for production. A year later, the company transitioned to highly automated volume production using SMT processes. Towards the end of the 1980s, Jabil adopted the automated tape-automated bonding (TAB) process for circuit board production.

In 1982, Jabil moved its headquarters from Detroit to St. Petersburg, Florida.

In April 1993, Jabil became a publicly traded company, listing its shares on the New York Stock Exchange.

In 1997, Jabil expanded its manufacturing capacity and workforce, completing a new 120,000-square-foot building in St. Petersburg.

In 2001, Jabil was added to the S&amp;P 500 Index. 

In 2013, William D. Morean retired and was succeeded by Timothy Main as board chairman. Later, William E. Peters was named president and Mark Mondello was appointed CEO.

In 2014, Jabil was moved from the S&amp;P 500 Index to the S&amp;P MidCap 400 Index.

In 2017, Jabil announced that it would be closing its first European international plant in Livingston, United Kingdom, by the end of the year. Two hundred sixty-six employees in Livingston would lose their jobs. Jabil laid off approximately 400 people in September 2016, 100 of those being corporate employees located in St. Petersburg Florida. In March 2024, the company announced it would lay off 120 workers in Vancouver, Washington.

In January 2023, it was reported that Jabil had started manufacturing components for AirPods in India. In December 2023, Jabil rejoined the S&amp;P 500 index.

On 19 April 2024, Jabil announced that CEO Kenny Wilson would take paid leave pending an investigation related to company policies, although not affecting the company&#x27;s financial statements or reporting. Following Wilson&#x27;s leave, which began on April 15, CFO Michael Dastoor was appointed as interim CEO by the board of directors. Following the completion of the investigation, Wilson resigned from the company and Dastoor was named CEO.

===Acquisitions and mergers===
Jabil has acquired numerous companies and arms of companies. Their acquisitions have expanded their presence in countries such as China, Mexico, India, Spain, the Netherlands and Russia. 

In 1999, Jabil began its operations in China by acquiring GET Manufacturing.

In 2005, Jabil acquired Varian&#x27;s electronics manufacturing business for $195 million. A year later, Jabil expanded its operations to Taiwan and acquired Green Point for $881 million through its subsidiary Jabil Circuit Taiwan.

In 2011, Jabil acquired Telmar Network, a communication network service provider based in Texas.

In February 2013, Jabil acquired Nypro for $665 million in cash. The purchase was completed in July 2013.

In 2015, Jabil acquired Shemer Group, an Israeli metal fabrication company specializing in contract manufacturing for high-tech capital equipment manufacturers. In the same year, the company acquired Plasticos Castella, a Spain-based food and consumer packaging manufacturer.

<doc id="928216" wikidata="Q2872602" url="?curid=928216" title="Autological word">
<text>An autological word (or homological word) expresses a property that it also possesses. For example, the word &quot;word&quot; is a word, the word &quot;English&quot; is (in) English, the word &quot;writable&quot; is writable, and the word &quot;&quot; has five syllables.

The opposite, a heterological word, does not apply to itself. For example, the word &quot;palindrome&quot; is not a palindrome, &quot;unwritable&quot; is writable, and &quot;monosyllabic&quot; has more than one syllable.

Unlike more general concepts of autology and self-reference, this particular distinction and opposition of autological and heterological words is uncommon in linguistics for describing linguistic phenomena or classes of words, but is current in logic and philosophy where it was introduced by Kurt Grelling and Leonard Nelson for describing a semantic paradox, later known as Grelling&#x27;s paradox or the Grelling–Nelson paradox.

<text>Denyse Julien (born 22 July 1960, in Rouyn-Noranda, Quebec) is a Canadian former badminton player noted for her versatility and longevity.

==Career==
Between 1981 and 2004 Julien won a record 31 Canadian National Championship events, thirteen in singles, eight in women&#x27;s doubles, and ten in mixed doubles. She also captured five events at the Canadian Open Championships, including women&#x27;s singles in 1989. Julien earned four individual medals at the quadrennial Commonwealth Games. These include a silver medal in singles (1990), and a silver (1986) and two bronzes (1990, 1994) in women&#x27;s doubles. Julien&#x27;s record in another quadrennial competition, the Pan American Games, has been particularly noteworthy. A few months shy of her 35th birthday she won all three events at Mar del Plata, Argentina in 1995 when badminton was introduced into these Games. She won medals in each event at the next competition in Winnipeg in 1999, and a silver in women&#x27;s doubles and a gold in mixed doubles at the 2003 competition in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic. 
Julien won a number of titles in Europe, including women&#x27;s singles at French (1982) and Welsh (1991, 1995) Opens, women&#x27;s doubles at the Austrian International (1983), and mixed doubles at the Portugal Open (1998). She competed in three Olympic Games (1992, 1996, 2004), the highlight of which was winning two rounds of singles at the 1992 Games in Barcelona before bowing to China&#x27;s reigning world champion Tang Jiuhong.

<text>Iva Majoli (born 12 August 1977) is a Croatian former professional tennis player who played for both Yugoslavia and Croatia. She won three WTA Tier I singles tournaments and upset the world No. 1, Martina Hingis, to win the women&#x27;s singles title at the 1997 French Open. Majoli reached a career-high singles ranking of world No. 4, in February 1996.

==Early and personal life==
Majoli was born in Zagreb in SR Croatia, SFR Yugoslavia to Stanko (father), and Dragica (mother). She has an older brother Drago and an older sister Nina.

==Career==
===Early years===
In her early years, Iva Majoli was coached by her father Stanko, Jelena Genčić, and Nick Bollettieri, whose academy she joined in 1990. She turned professional in September the same year, when she played her first professional match in Makarska, representing Yugoslavia, losing in the first round to Ruxandra Dragomir. 
Majoli had her WTA main draw debut at the 1992 Virginia Slims of Houston in April. Aged 14 and ranked No. 537, she reached the quarterfinals as a wildcard entry, beating Lindsay Davenport and world no. 24 Lori McNeil, before losing to the eventual finalist Zina Garrison. Later that year she played her first Grand Slam at the 1992 US Open, reaching the 2nd round. She reached two more WTA quarterfinals that year, at the 1992 Bank of the West Classic in Oakland (beat Karina Habšudová and Lori McNeil, lost to world no.1 Monica Seles) and at the Indianapolis Tennis Classic (beat world no. 14 Nathalie Tauziat in the 2nd round). She finished her first full WTA season ranked no. 50, improving 748 spots.

===1993 and 1994: First WTA final, Grand Slam second week and top 20 ranking===
Majoli reached two quarterfinals in 1993, at the 1993 Virginia Slims of Chicago in February (lost to Mary Joe Fernández in 3s) and at the Bank of the West Classic in Oakland (lost to no. 3 Martina Navratilova in 3s). At the 1993 French Open, she reached the second week of Roland Garros in her first attempt without dropping a set, beating the 15th seed Sabine Hack of Germany, and losing to Steffi Graf 4:6 6:7 in the 4th round, having led 4:2 in the first set and 6:5 in the second. After the match, the media dubbed her &quot;the new Monica Seles&quot;. She finished the year ranked no 46 and received the WTA Newcomer of the Year award.

In 1994 Majoli reached three WTA finals, at the Asia Women&#x27;s Tennis Open Osaka (lost to Manuela Maleeva-Fragniere in 3s in the last match of Maleeva&#x27;s career), at the Barcelona Ladies Open (beat Conchita Martínez and Magdalena Maleeva, lost to Arantxa Sánchez Vicario), and at the Nokia Grand Prix Essen (beat Anke Huber, lost to Jana Novotná). Other notable results include a semifinal showing at Indian Wells (lost to Graf), a semifinal at Hilton Head (beat world no.6 Gabriela Sabatini for her first career top-10 victory, lost to Conchita Martínez in 3s), and at the Acura U.S. Women&#x27;s Hardcourt Championships where she beat Pam Shriver and Mary Joe Fernández, before losing to Sánchez Vicario. She also defended her 4th-round points at the French Open and reached the 4th round at the US Open. On June 20, 1994, she entered the top 20 ranking, aged 16 years and 10 months. In November, Majoli qualified for the year-end championship at the Virginia Slims of New York for the first time in her career, losing to Novotná in the first round. She finished the year at a career-high ranking of world no. 13.

===1995: First Tier I title, Grand Slam QF and top 10 ranking===
Majoli started the 1995 season reaching the semifinals in Tokyo in January and Paris in February. In April, she again reached the finals of WTA Barcelona, and again lost to Sánchez Vicario. In June she reached the quarterfinals of a Grand Slam for the first time in her career, beating Mary Pierce in the 4th round at the French Open (l. to Kimiko Date in the quarterfinals). In October the same year she recorded a 10-match winning streak which included four top-10 victories and her first two WTA titles in two consecutive weeks. Majoli&#x27;s first career title came at the WTA Zurich, a Tier 1 tournament, where she scored upsets over Jana Novotná, Chanda Rubin and Mary Pierce in the final, winning the title with a 6-4 6–4 scoreline. The following week Majoli won the WTA Filderstadt, again beating Pierce and Rubin and upsetting Gabriela Sabatini in the final 6-4 7–6. After Filderstadt, Majoli reached her new career-high ranking of world no. 9 in October 1995, at the age of 18 years and 2 months. She would stay in the top 10 for 138 consecutive weeks. At the end of the year Majoli qualified for the WTA finals for the second year in a row, again losing in the first round, this time to C. Martinez after leading 6:1 4:1.

===1996: Second Tier I title and top 5 ranking===

Majoli started the 1996 by playing at the Australian open for the first time in her career. She went on to reach the quarterfinals without dropping a set, and then lost to the eventual champion Monica Seles. After the Australian Open, Majoli captured her second Tier I title in Tokyo, where she beat the reigning world no. 1 Monica Seles in the quarterfinals, the future no. 1 Martina Hingis in the semifinals, and the former no. 1 Arantxa Sánchez Vicario in the final. After Tokyo, Majoli reached her career-high ranking of world no. 4. at the age of 18 years, 5 months and 24 days. She kept this ranking for 51 weeks in total.

After Tokyo, Majoli reached the final of WTA Paris (l. to Julie Halard-Decugis 5-7 6–7) and won WTA Essen (beat Novotná in the final 7–6 in the third set). After reaching at least the final in three of the last four tournaments, Majoli lost in the quarterfinals of Hilton Head and the second round of WTA Bol in her native Croatia. She bounced back at the 1996 Rome where she reached the semifinals (l. to C. Martinez) and the semifinals of Berlin (l. to Graf). After Berlin, Majoli briefly led the Championships Race standings. At the 1996 French Open Majoli again lost to Graf in the quarterfinals. Other notable results include her fourth WTA final of the season at Leipzig (l. to Huber), semifinals at Zuerich where she was the defending champion (l. to Novotná), and the quarterfinals as the 1996 Atlanta Olympics (l. to eventual champion Davenport). She qualified for the season-ending WTA finals for the third year in a row, beating Huber and Martinez and losing to Hingis in the semifinals. Majoli finished the year at no. 8, with a 41-17 W/L ratio and almost half of those wins coming on indoor carpet surface.

===1997: Grand Slam title at the French Open===
The most successful season of Iva Majoli&#x27;s career started with a quarterfinal showing at Sydney and a loss to Patty Schnyder in the first round of the Australian Open. She bounced back in February, winning her first title of the season (fifth in career) at Hanover (beat Novotná in the final after saving a match point). In April, Majoli won her second title of the season at the WTA Hamburg (beat Pierce and Dragomir-Ilie). In June, she won the 1997 French Open singles title, defeating Sandra Kleinová, Alexandra Fusai, Ann Grossman, Lindsay Davenport (after trailing 7:5 4:0), Ruxandra Dragomir and Amanda Coetzer (winning the last five games in the third set, after falling behind 2-5). In the final Majoli beat the 16-year-old Martina Hingis in straight sets, 6–4, 6–2. Majoli played aggressively from the baseline to end Hingis&#x27;s 37-match winning streak and prevented Hingis from winning the Grand Slam (Hingis later won Wimbledon and the US Open in 1997 making this her only defeat in a Grand Slam tournament that year). Majoli was the lowest seed (at the time) to win a Grand Slam singles title in Open Era and, at 19 years of age, the 11th teenager to win Roland Garros. Majoli followed this with her career-best showing at Wimbledon, where she beat Irina Spîrlea in the 4th round (9-7 third set) to reach the quarterfinals (l. to Anna Kournikova). She went 7-9 for the rest of the season, reaching two semifinals (in Atlanta and Chicago) and qualifying for the season-ending WTA finals for the fourth consecutive year (l. to Tauziat in the quarterfinals). Majoli finished the year at no.6, with a career best 45 matches won (23 losses), going 19–4 on clay.

===Post 1997-career: Struggling with injuries===

In 1998 Majoli&#x27;s best results were SF in February at 1998 Toray Pan Pacific Open (l. to Hingis) and EA-Generali Ladies Linz, where she suffered a back injury and retired during match vs. Van Roost. Later in the year Majoli withdrew from Indian Wells and Miami with bronchitis. As a defending champion at Roland Garros, she came back from 3-1 down in third set to defeat world no. 6 C. Martinez in 4r to reach QF (l. to world No. 2 Davenport in 3s). At 20 years of age, this was the last top-10 victory of Majoli&#x27;s career and her final showing in a second week of a Grand Slam tournament. Majoli fell out of Top 10 on May 11 and Top 20 on August 31 and withdrew from Zurich and Filderstadt with a persistent right shoulder injury which would plague her for the remainder of her tennis career.

Her best result in 1999 was a 3rd round showing at Hilton Head (d. world no 15 Spirlea in 3s). Majoli missed the Italian and German Opens, Roland Garros and Wimbledon due to the right shoulder injury and lost in the 1st round in the next five events. Having undergone the shoulder surgery after the US Open, Majoli missed the next six months of playing and returned at the 2000 Ericsson open in Miami, losing to Fabiola Zuluaga. Ranked no. 459, Majoli won her first match in over 11 months at Hilton Head, and reached her first WTA semifinal in over two years in Madrid. At WTA Kuala Lumpur as a WC (and ranked at no. 109), Majoli reached her first final since winning 1997 Roland Garros, upsetting No. 2 seed Dokic en route (l. to Nagyova). After falling as low as No. 466 on April 10, Majoli finished the season ranked No. 73 and won the 2000 WTA Comeback of the year award.

In 2001 Majoli continued her slow but steady climb up the rankings. She played all four Grand Slams for the first time since 1998, and reached another singles final at the 2001 Challenge Bell in Quebec (l. to Meghann Shaughnessy). At Paris Indoors Majoli won her first WTA doubles tournament, partnering Virginie Razzano. Other notable results include a QF showing at Tokyo Pan Pacific. At Charleston, Majoli upset No. 13 seed Dokic and stretched world No. 1 Hingis to 3s in 3r. In the 3rd round at the US Open came within two points of upsetting world No. 1 Hingis in third-set tie-break before falling 6:7 in the decider. Majoli finished the year ranked no. 32.

In 2002, ranked world No. 58, Majoli reached the final of the Family Circle Cup Tier I tournament in Charleston. She defeated Coetzer and Sandrine Testud before defeating Patty Schnyder in the final for her first win in five meetings. This was the first title for Majoli since the 1997 Roland Garros and the final title of Majoli&#x27;s career. She extended her winning streak to ten matches by reaching the final of the 2002 Croatian Bol Ladies Open later that month and reached no. 22 ranking on August 26, highest since October 1998. However, her ranking started to continually decline since, and Majoli only reached one more WTA semifinal in the next two years (at 2003 Sarasota Clay Court Classic). In September 2003 Majoli dropped out of top 100 and in April 2004 out of top 200. On June 12, 2004, she announced her retirement from the game, at the age of 26. Majoli made a brief comeback in professional tennis at the 2015 Kremlin Cup, where she received a wildcard with Anastasia Bukhanko in the doubles draw.

In 2012, she was selected to be the non-playing captain of the Croatian Fed Cup team.

==Personal life==
In 2006, Majoli announced that she was engaged and pregnant with her first child. She married a local businessman, Stipe Marić, on 9 September 2006, with Jennifer Capriati and Mary Pierce attending the wedding. She gave birth to her daughter Mia on 31 October 2006. Majoli and Marić divorced in 2012. Majoli married Roberto Calegari in 2022.

In 2007, Majoli participated in the second season of the Croatian version of &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot;. Her partner was Marko Herceg. She was eliminated in the fourth episode.

<doc id="928225" wikidata="Q1130421" url="?curid=928225" title="Follow the Reaper">
<text>Follow the Reaper is the third studio album by Finnish melodic death metal band Children of Bodom. It was released in Finland on 30 October 2000 by Spinefarm Records, and on 22 January 2001 internationally by Nuclear Blast Records. The album is the first on which the band seriously moved toward a power metal-inspired sound, brought by Hypocrisy frontman and new producer Peter Tägtgren. Many songs on the album became live setlist favorites, such as &quot;Everytime I Die&quot;, &quot;Hate Me!&quot;, and the title track. The song &quot;Mask of Sanity&quot; is a remake of the song &quot;Talking of the Trees&quot; from their early demo &quot;Shining&quot; (released as &quot;IneartheD&quot;). A deluxe edition featuring two bonus tracks was released in 2006.

&quot;Follow the Reaper&quot; was recorded and mixed at Tägtgren&#x27;s Abyss studio in Sweden. Tägtgren replaced Anssi Kippo, with whom Children of Bodom had recorded all of their previous releases. The songs on the album were all recorded in D standard tuning (D, G, C, F, A, D), which was also used on &quot;Hatebreeder&quot;.

<doc id="928231" wikidata="Q4763500" url="?curid=928231" title="Anglican Diocese of New Westminster">
<text>The Diocese of New Westminster is one of five dioceses of the Ecclesiastical Province of British Columbia and the Yukon of the Anglican Church of Canada. The see city is Vancouver. The current bishop is the Most Reverend John Stephens. He was consecrated as the coadjutor bishop on January 23, 2021, installed as diocesan bishop on February 28, 2021, and elected as the Metropolitan of British Columbia and Yukon on January 18, 2025. The Dean of New Westminster and rector of the cathedral (Christ Church Cathedral) is the Very Reverend Christopher Pappas and the Executive Archdeacon is the Venerable Nick Pang.

The diocese encompasses about 78,000 square kilometres of the Lower Mainland in the civil province of British Columbia, comprising the Regional Districts of Metro Vancouver, Fraser Valley, Sunshine Coast, Powell River and part of the Regional District of Squamish-Lillooet (including Squamish and Whistler).

The diocese was established in New Westminster in 1879 and incorporated April 18, 1893 (An Act to incorporate the Anglican Synod of the Diocese of New Westminster {Statutes of British Columbia 1893, Chapter 45 with amendments to 1961 {1900, 1915, 1961} 18th April 1893) , but with the considerable growth of the City of Vancouver, the see city was moved there in 1929. There are, therefore, two churches styled as &quot;cathedrals&quot; in the diocese — Christ Church Cathedral in Vancouver has been the cathedral since 1929, while Holy Trinity Cathedral in New Westminster was the cathedral from 1892 to that date. Although no longer a cathedral, the diocesan synod allowed Holy Trinity to keep the title &quot;cathedral&quot; as a courtesy for historical reasons (it is, strictly speaking, a pro-cathedral).

The diocese has 62 active parishes and 4 emerging faith communities with approximately 10,000 members on its parish rolls according to the recent statistics stated in the official publication Topic.

The diocese has traditionally been at the forefront of progressive causes in the Anglican Communion. In 1976, David Somerville was one of the first bishops of the Canadian Church to ordain women to the priesthood (women had been ordained as deacons previously). In 2002, the diocese became the centre of an international controversy within the Anglican Communion due to its decision to bless same-sex unions. Several conservative ecclesiastical provinces in the communion, particularly those in Africa, have severed relations with the diocese over the issue (&quot;see Homosexuality and the Anglican Communion&quot;).

At the May 11, 2016, meeting of the diocesan council the governing body of the diocese unanimously passed the following motion:
That Diocesan Council, on behalf of the Diocese of New Westminster:
I. Accept the invitation of the Episcopal Diocese of Northern Philippines to enter into a companion relationship seeking opportunities for prayer, mutual learning, and witness to the gospel (the &quot;Companion Relationship&quot;);
II. undertake an annual evaluation of the Companion Relationship to ensure that the Companion Relationship satisfies the mutual goals of the two dioceses (the &quot;Annual Evaluations&quot;); and
III. ask the Bishop to appoint members from the Diocese of New Westminster to a joint-diocesan working group to oversee the Companion Relationship and to undertake the Annual Evaluations. Then-Bishop Brent Alawas of the Episcopal Diocese of Northern Philippines (as of 2022, Bishop Alawas is currently the Presiding Bishop of the Episcopal Church in the Philippines) travelled from Bontoc to Vancouver on May 12, 2016 and was present as a guest speaker at the diocesan mission conference on May 14, 2016

The diocesan offices, gathering space, meeting rooms and archives are located at 1410 Nanton Avenue in the Shaughnessy section of the City of Vancouver.

==Coat of arms and badge==
The coat of arms and badge are both official marks for the diocese. In practice, the crest is generally used more when the bishop is involved directly, and the badge when specifically referencing only the diocese.

The coat of arms, with much history behind it, was acquired by Bishop Gower in 1960. It strongly references that of Westminster Abbey, London, UK.

The badge (a blue circle, gold cross and birds over white wave) was created for the diocesan communications committee with the help of Robert Watt, Chief Herald of Canada, and officially adopted at the 2007 diocesan synod.

The badge is a proper heraldic symbol for use on diocesan and parish materials. It incorporates key elements of the diocesan coat of arms, but is less detailed, and the badge is easier to reproduce properly than the very detailed coat of arms.
