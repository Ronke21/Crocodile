<text>Flirty Fishing (FFing) is a form of evangelism by sexual intimacy practised from around 1974 to 1987 by the cult Children of God, currently known as The Family International (TFI). Female members of Children of God, or &quot;fisherwomen,&quot; would apply their sex appeal on &quot;fish&quot; — men from outside the cult (often, but not always, having sex) — using the occasion to proselytize and seek donations. 

Children of God have defended it as a way of &quot;bearing witness&quot; for Jesus to people who would not otherwise be open to it. According to some sources, over 200,000 men were &quot;fished&quot; and over 10,000 babies were born to cult women between 1971 and 2001. The practice was curtailed as sexually transmitted diseases spread through the cult, and then abandoned in 1987, reportedly because of the spread of AIDS.

==Etymology, definition, rationale==
The term is derived from Matthew 4:19 from the New Testament, in which Jesus tells two fishermen that he will make them &quot;fishers of men&quot;. Cult leader David Berg extrapolated from this that women in his movement should be &quot;flirty fishers&quot; (also called &quot;bait&quot; or &quot;fisherwomen&quot;). The targeted men were called &quot;fish&quot;. The cult published several documents with exact instructions. Flirty Fishing was defined as using sex appeal for proselytizing.

According to The Family&#x27;s history, &quot;Father David [Berg] arrived at the rather shocking conclusion that Christians were therefore free through God&#x27;s grace to go to great lengths to show the Love of God to others, even as far as meeting their sexual needs.&quot; While acknowledging that this interpretation scandalized &quot;many religious institutions&quot;, The Family maintained that &quot;many people, most of whom would never even go near a church, were reached and won to Christ through this very humble, honest, open and intimately human approach to witnessing.&quot; A Family spokesman John Francis describes the main &quot;fish&quot; involved as &quot;lonely traveling businessmen&quot; staying in hotels.

==Practice==
The Children of God practised flirty fishing and escort servicing from 1974 until 1987, when it was officially abandoned, in part because of the AIDS epidemic.

Researcher Bill Bainbridge obtained data from TFI suggesting that, from 1974 until 1987, members had sexual contact with 223,989 people while practicing Flirty Fishing. As the women were expected to keep exact records of their &quot;fruits&quot; (successes), a 1988 statistic showed that more than 223,000 men had been &quot;fished&quot; since 1978—and that FFing had nevertheless continued into 1988. Though the cult had no problem ignoring Christian norms on fornication, it did follow Christian beliefs when it came to birth control. Sources differ on whether birth control was forbidden or simply discouraged. The practice also resulted in numerous pregnancies, the offspring of which were termed &quot;Jesus babies&quot; by the organization. According to Don Lattin, between 1971 and 2001 &quot;more than 13,000&quot; children were born to followers of David Berg; &quot;women with six, eight, 10, 13 kids were not uncommon&quot; in the Family. The &quot;first child conceived through &#x27;flirty fishing&#x27;, was born to Berg’s common-law wife, Karen Zerby&quot;, but was fathered by &quot;a waiter she picked up in the Canary Islands&quot;.

Ex-member and critic, David Hiebert, states the practice was &quot;used to curry political favor&quot; in countries CoG had migrated to. &quot;They would target special people—in the media, lawyers, in the government.&quot; According to James Chancellor,

=== ESing ===

The financial benefit of Flirty Fishing soon advanced from mere flirting/&quot;loving sexually&quot;, to &quot;escort servicing&quot; (ESing)—described as &quot;making FFing pay&quot; by Berg—in which female cult members would work as regular call girls for escort agencies or freelance, and &quot;witness&quot; (proselytize) to their clients merely when the occasion offered itself.

According to author James Chancellor,

== Impact on members and criticism==
Critical ex-members of CoG also point to Family publications from this period. A 1987 &quot;Basic Training Handbook&quot; offers &quot;explicit advice on sex among prepubescent teens. There&#x27;s also something called &#x27;My Little Fish&#x27; containing nude photographs of a young boy and an adult woman embracing.&quot;

Flirty Fishing has been compared to prostitution. One scholar, (Susan Raine) describes its &quot;terminology and ... imagery&quot; as &quot;saturated with the rhetoric of prostitution&quot;. Describing a couple of images from internal Children of God literature on FFing sent by Berg to Children of God communes and later released by ex-members, Raine says one is &quot;of a woman wearing hot pants, a bra, and high-heeled boots ... dangling a fishhook from her hand ... the caption below reads &#x27;FISHERS OF MEN!. Another &quot;portrays a woman as a mermaid impaled on a hook, but embracing a man, this time with the heading &#x27;HOOKER FOR JESUS (One &quot;Mo Letter&quot; written by David Berg and distributed to members of CoG was entitled &quot;God&#x27;s Whores?&quot;.)

<text>George Pirkis Kidd (June 6, 1917 – July 22, 2004) was a Scottish-Canadian diplomat. He was the first Canadian ambassador to Israel in 1954 and was the ambassador to Cuba at the time of the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962.

He was born in Glasgow, Scotland and later moved to Canada with his parents. He was wounded in action at the Battle of Normandy during World War II.

Kidd was posted as Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary to the Canadian embassy in Havana a few months after the American embassy closed in early 1961. A few days after the John F. Kennedy assassination, he expressed the opinion in a confidential memo (released in 1999) that, although he considered it unlikely, Cuban involvement in the killing could not be ruled out. He served in the same role for Haiti starting in 1962.

He was deputy director of the Canadian International Development Agency from 1967 to 1971. He served as High Commissioner to Nigeria and Sierra Leone from 1974 to 1977. After he retired in 1977, he served on the board of trustees of the Art Gallery of Greater Victoria and the board of governors of the University of Victoria.

He died at the age of 87 from complications after hip surgery.

<text>The New Zealand sea lion (Phocarctos hookeri), once known as Hooker&#x27;s sea lion, and as (for both male and female) or (male) and (female) in Māori, is a species of sea lion that is endemic to New Zealand and primarily breeds on New Zealand&#x27;s subantarctic Auckland and Campbell islands, and have in recent years been slowly breeding and recolonising around the coast of New Zealand&#x27;s South and Stewart islands. The New Zealand sea lion numbers around 12,000 and is one of the world&#x27;s rarest sea lion species. They are the only species of the genus Phocarctos.

==Physiology and behaviour==

New Zealand sea lions are one of the largest New Zealand animals. Like all otariids, they have marked sexual dimorphism; adult males are long and weigh , while adult females are long and weigh . At birth, pups are long and weigh ; the natal pelage is a thick coat of dark brown hair that becomes dark gray with cream markings on the top of the head, nose, tail and at the base of the flippers. Adult females&#x27; coats vary from buff to creamy grey with darker pigmentation around the muzzle and the flippers. Adult males are blackish-brown with a well-developed black mane of coarse hair reaching the shoulders. New Zealand sea lions are strongly philopatric.

The New Zealand sea lion&#x27;s terrestrial behaviour is unique among other pinniped species. In the breeding season, female New Zealand sea lions gradually move inland with their pups to protect them from harassment by males, wind, storms, and potential parasitic infections. They can move up to inland, from sandy beaches to tall grasses, and into forests. They are the only pinniped species known to disperse far inland and have a preference for forests.

==Distribution==
The main breeding populations are at the Auckland and Campbell Islands in the New Zealand subantarctic, where approximately 99% of the species&#x27; annual pup production occurs. There are currently three functioning breeding rookeries on the Auckland Islands. Most sea lions are born on Dundas Island. A smaller rookery exists at Sandy Bay on Enderby Island and the smallest rookery is on Figure of Eight Island. An even smaller rookery at South East Point on Auckland Island appears to now have been abandoned. The other major breeding area is the Campbell Islands.

Historically, New Zealand sea lions were distributed all over mainland New Zealand and Stewart Island, but were extirpated from these areas due to human hunting activities. For the first time in over 150 years, sea lions began breeding again on the South Island coast in 1993, on the Otago Peninsula after Mum gave birth. Other small populations of breeding sea lions have recently begun to establish in various parts of the Stewart Island coastline and have been observed on the Catlins coast south of the Clutha River.

Recent DNA information indicates the New Zealand sea lion is a lineage previously restricted to subantarctic regions. Somewhere between 1300 and 1500 AD, a genetically distinct mainland lineage was wiped out by the first Maori settlers, and the subantarctic lineage has since then gradually filled the ecological niche. It has been inferred from middens and ancient DNA that a third lineage was made extinct at the Chatham Islands due to predation by the Moriori people.

==Diet and predation==
New Zealand sea lions are known to prey on a wide range of species including fish such as Antarctic horsefish and Patagonian toothfish, cephalopods (e.g. New Zealand arrow squid and yellow octopus), crustaceans, seabirds and other marine mammals, and even New Zealand fur seals. Studies indicate a strong location effect on diet, with almost no overlap in prey species comparing sea lions at Otago Peninsula and Campbell Island, at the north and south extents of the species&#x27; breeding range. New Zealand sea lions are in turn preyed on by great white sharks, with 27% showing evidence of scarring from near-miss shark attacks in an opportunistic study of adult New Zealand sea lions at Sandy Bay, Enderby Island.

==Status==

New Zealand sea lions are considered the most threatened sea lion in the world. The species&#x27; status is largely driven by the main breeding population at the Auckland Islands, which declined by ~50% between 2000 and 2015. The 2013 sea lion pup production count on the Auckland Islands showed the number of pups born on the islands has risen to 1931, from the 2012 figure of 1684 (dead pups are also counted, since the annual pup count is used to assess the population of breeding females, but not future births when the counted pups mature). The 2013 number was the highest in five years. The Campbell Island population &#x27;appears to be increasing slowly&#x27; and births here comprise ~30% of the species&#x27; total. The Otago and Stewart Island sea lion populations are currently small, though increasing. Population estimates for the whole species declined from ~15,000 in the mid-1990s to 9,000 in 2008 (based on the number of pups born).

In 2010, the Department of Conservation—responsible for marine mammal conservation—changed the New Zealand Threat Classification System ranking from Nationally Endangered to Nationally Critical. The Department of Conservation estimates that Auckland Islands&#x27; sea lions, nearly 80% of the total, could be functionally extinct by 2035. However, the New Zealand Ministry for Primary Industries considers research on which this prediction is based is low quality and &#x27;should not be used in management decisions&#x27;. In 2015, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) changed the classification of this species to &quot;Endangered&quot;, based on low overall population size, the small number of breeding populations and the projected trend of the Auckland Islands breeding population.

In 2019, the New Zealand sea lion&#x27;s status was found to have improved and they are now &quot;Nationally Vulnerable&quot;. Their overall rate of population decline has slowed in most breeding locations and Stewart Island was officially recognised as a new breeding colony in 2018. Their global IUCN status remains &quot;Endangered&quot;.

==Threats==

===Subsistence hunting and commercial sealing===
Subsistence hunting and commercial harvest of sea lions greatly reduced the breeding range and population size of New Zealand sea lions between the 13th and 19th Centuries. In 1893, sealing for both New Zealand sea lions and New Zealand fur seals was prohibited by law in New Zealand.

===Commercial fishery bycatch===
In the 1990s, as the volume of squid fishing around the Auckland Islands increased, numbers of sea lions were captured as bycatch and drowned in the squid trawl nets. The government uses a modelling system to set a fishing-related mortality limit (FRML) each year. If the limit is predicted to be exceeded, the Minister of Primary Industries may close the fishery. The last time the FRML was exceeded was in 2000, though a number of closures occurred in the 1990s.

In late February 2013, the first observed sea lion mortalities in the Auckland Island squid fleet in three years occurred. Juvenile sea lions slipped through the grid at the opening of the net into its cod end. The 23-cm grid aperture is designed to hold adult sea lions in the SLED (sea lion exclusion device) and yet still allow squid to pass into the net. In 2013, one adult female was taken as incidental bycatch.

In August 2013, the seasonal southern blue whiting fleet captured 21 male sea lions in fishing grounds more than 100 km off the Campbell Islands. Four were released alive. No captures were reported by government observers the year before. The government responded to the captures by requesting the vessels try sea lion exclusion devices (SLEDs) to reduce this bycatch.

The estimated captures in the 2014 season were 11.58% of the FRML. The proportion of vessels in the Auckland Island squid fishery with government observers has increased over the years, providing independent reports of bycatch based on observation rather than computer model estimates. During the 2014 season, the observers&#x27; coverage was of 84% of tows. In the concluded 2014 season, two sea lions were reportedly captured in the fishery.

====Sea lion exclusion devices====
In 2001, the sea lion exclusion device (SLED) was introduced into the Auckland Island squid fishery to reduce sea lion bycatch. Conservation advocates have supported SLED use to protect other marine animals or sharks. Since 2007, all vessels in the Auckland Islands fishery have been equipped with SLEDs. Some scientists do not believe sea lions survive the interaction with a SLED, though the Ministry for Primary Industries (MPI) believes the direct effect of fishing-related mortality on the sea lion population is minimal. MPI has concluded that a sea lion has an 85% chance of escaping the SLED and a 97 per cent probability of surviving a SLED escape, though it says this estimate may be &#x27;mildly pessimistic&#x27;.

===Food limitation===
Food availability is a well-known, major cause of population change in pinniped species. The Auckland Islands population has displayed numerous indicators of food limitation during the recent decline in breeder numbers, including: poor maternal condition, delayed maturation, years with very low pupping rate, low survival of pups born and long-term shifts in diet composition. Starvation was provisionally identified as cause of mortality for 62% of pups necropsied at Campbell Island in 2015, when 58% of all pups born were estimated to have died in the first month of life.

===Disease===
Though the Auckland Island sea lion pup production is highly variable, a decline trend for some years followed the outbreak of an introduced bacterial disease caused by a &quot;Campylobacter&quot; species in 1998 which killed an estimated 53% of newborn pups and 20% of adult females. In 2002, another probably introduced bacterial disease caused by &quot;Klebsiella pneumoniae&quot; killed 32% of pups, and in 2003 another 21% of the pups. Since 2002, &quot;K. pneumoniae&quot; bacteria have caused significant mortality in the sea lion pups at Enderby Island. Infected pups have meningitis, as well as sepsis. On 12 March 2014, the Conservation Minister Nick Smith was quoted as saying an &quot;excessive focus on fishing bycatch&quot; existed and 300 pups had died the previous summer from an as yet unidentified disease. 
===Mainland threats===
The mainland population was estimated to reach 1000 animals by 2044, leading to issues of &#x27;marine protected areas, local fishing quotas and numbers management&#x27;.

New Zealand sea lions are projected to potentially distribute all around mainland New Zealand, but they face potential human conflicts, especially due to their unique inland movement behaviour. New Zealand sea lions have been hit by cars on roads, and deliberately killed, harassed, and clubbed. There have also been incidents of disturbance from domestic dogs. Infrastructure such as roads and fences also pose as barriers to their inland movement. Females and pups on the mainland have also adapted to commercial pine plantations, which are privately-owned lands.

In order ensure the protection of New Zealand sea lions, the Department of Conservation works to engage with local communities and spread awareness on this species&#x27; recolonisation and behaviour.

<text>The Garn–St Germain Depository Institutions Act of 1982 (, , enacted October 15, 1982) is an Act of Congress that deregulated savings and loan associations and allowed banks to provide adjustable-rate mortgage loans. It is disputed whether the act was a mitigating or contributing factor in the savings and loan crisis of the late 1980s.

The bill, whose full title was &quot;An Act to revitalize the housing industry by strengthening the financial stability of home mortgage lending institutions and ensuring the availability of home mortgage loans,&quot; was a Reagan Administration initiative.

The bill is named after its sponsors, Congressman Fernand St Germain, Democrat of Rhode Island, and Senator Jake Garn, Republican of Utah. The bill had broad support in Congress, with co-sponsors including Charles Schumer and Steny Hoyer. The bill passed overwhelmingly, by a margin of 272–91 in the House.

An important consumer change was to allow anyone to place real estate, consisting of one to four dwelling units, into their own trust without triggering the due-on-sale clause. The due-on-sale clause allows lenders to foreclose on a current loan upon transfer to another. This greatly facilitates the use of trusts to pass property to heirs and minors. It may also protect the property of wealthy or risky owners against the possibility of future lawsuits or creditors, because the trust owns the property, not the individuals at risk. The bill states &quot;... a lender may not exercise its option pursuant to a due-on-sale clause upon ... a transfer into an inter vivos trust in which the borrower is and remains a beneficiary and which does not relate to a transfer of rights of occupancy in the property[.]&quot; (The Garn st Germain Depository Institutions Act of 1982, (U.S.C.) 1701j-3(d)(8).)

Title VIII of the act, &quot;Alternative Mortgage Transactions&quot;, allowed banks to provide adjustable-rate mortgage loans.

The bill&#x27;s passage is considered an important shift in the Democratic Party&#x27;s positioning on economic regulation, as the party had historically defended New Deal era financial regulations, but had now come to favor financial deregulation. According to a 2022 study, this shift happened as a consequence of the congressional reforms of the 1970s, which undermined parochial and Southern populist interests within the Democratic Party. These parochial and populist interests favored a decentralized banking system. The party subsequently pursued deregulatory reforms that it perceived as beneficial to savers and consumers.

<doc id="910471" wikidata="Q5641200" url="?curid=910471" title="Halcyon Days (Steve Roach, Stephen Kent and Kenneth Newby album)">
<text>Halcyon Days is a collaborative album by the ambient musicians Steve Roach, Stephen Kent and Kenneth Newby. This album was recorded in the period from December 17 to 28, 1995. At that time most of the United States were experiencing severe winter weather, but the Sonoran Desert region, where this album was recorded, was enjoying a period temperate calm and clear skies.

While recording this album, Kent and Newby, along with their families, stayed at Roach&#x27;s home in Tucson. While there, the group enjoyed casual walks through the surrounding desert, serving as inspiration for their daily creative explorations in the studio.

Halcyon is the ancient Greek name for a bird now believed to be the kingfisher. In Greek Mythology Alcyone was a queen whose husband Ceyx was killed when his ship was lost at sea. She was overcome by grief and tried to drown herself, but the gods took pity on her and transformed her into a kingfisher. In the myth, the seas are calmed during a two-week period surrounding the winter solstice, when Alcyon&#x27;s descendants lay their eggs on the still water. This period is known as the Halcyon Days.

The music has a predominantly acoustic quality although much of the percussion and textures are rendered by computer algorithms designed by Kenneth Newby (Halcyon Days, Calyx Revelation, Rainfrog Dreaming) or programmed by Steve Roach (First Day, Kingfisher Flight), with didgeridoo and flute. Sampled electroacoustic textures are used throughout with only limited use of synthesizers. On some tracks, Stephen Kent plays a cello, in a fashion that resembles the sintir, a Moroccan plucked stringed instrument with a sound resembling an upright bass. This gives these tracks slight jazz overtones.

<text>The Inuvialuit (sing. Inuvialuk; &quot;the real people&quot;) or Western Canadian Inuit are Inuit who live in the western Canadian Arctic region. They, like all other Inuit, are descendants of the Thule who migrated eastward from Alaska. Their homeland – the Inuvialuit Settlement Region – covers the Arctic Ocean coastline area from the Alaskan border, east through the Beaufort Sea and beyond the Amundsen Gulf which includes some of the western Canadian Arctic Islands, as well as the inland community of Aklavik and part of Yukon. The land was demarked in 1984 by the Inuvialuit Final Agreement.

==History and migration==
 

The Inuvialuit Settlement Region was primarily inhabited by &quot;Siglit&quot; Inuit until their numbers were decimated by the introduction of new diseases in the second half of the 19th century. Nunatamiut, Alaskan Inuit, moved into traditional Siglit areas in the 1910s and 20s, enticed in part by renewed demand for furs from the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company and European markets. The Nunatamiut who settled in the Siglit area became known as Uummarmiut. Originally, there was an intense dislike between the Siglit and the Uummarmiut, but these differences faded over the years, and the two aboriginal peoples intermarried. With improved healthcare and Nunatamiut intermarriage, the Inuvialuit now number approximately 3,100.

In the 1930s, the Inuvialuit were involved in a Canadian government scheme to introduce reindeer herding as the primary economic driver of the Western Arctic. At tremendous expense, thousands of domesticated animals were herded from Alaska to the new Mackenzie Delta community of Reindeer Station. Indigenous Sámi people were imported from Norway to teach Inuvialuit men how to care for their own individual herds. However, the program was relatively unsuccessful, as it required a lonely lifestyle and was less lucrative than traditional hunting and trapping.

The Inuvialuit Settlement Region Traditional Knowledge Report of 2006 identified additional naming characteristics. Those Inuvialuit who live in the west are called &quot;Ualinirmiut&quot; (&quot;Ualiniq&quot;) by the people of the east. The Inuvialuit who occupy the east are known as &quot;Kivaninmiut&quot; (&quot;Kivaliniq&quot;) by the people of the west.

The Inuit of Ulukhaktok are neither Siglit nor Uummarmiut but are Copper Inuit and refer to themselves as &quot;Ulukhaktokmuit&quot; after &quot;Ulukhaktok&quot;, the native name for what used to be called Holman.

The proposed Mackenzie Valley Pipeline would have passed through both Inuvialuit and Gwich&#x27;in territory before the abandonment of the project in 2017.

==Language==
The traditional language is known as Inuvialuktun and it is made up of three or four dialects. Uummarmiutun, spoken by the Uummarmiut of Aklavik and Inuvik, is an Inupiatun dialect but is usually associated with Inuvialuktun. Siglitun is spoken by the Siglit of Sachs Harbour, Paulatuk, Tuktoyaktuk and Inuvik. Kangiryuarmiutun is used by the Kangiryuarmiut of Ulukhaktok. Kangiryuarmiutun is essentially the same as Inuinnaqtun which is also used in the Nunavut communities of Kugluktuk, Bathurst Inlet and Cambridge Bay. Natsilingmiutut used by the Netsilingmiut of Gjoa Haven, Taloyoak, Kugaaruk and Repulse Bay in Nunavut. Uummarmiutun, Siglitun and Inuinnaqtun (Kangiryuarmiutun) are all written using Latin script while Natsilingmiutut is written in Inuktitut syllabics.

==Culture==
Year-round, Inuvialuit hunt caribou from the Cape Bathurst and Bluenose herds, and have also shared the Porcupine herd with the Gwich’in. There has been some tension between the Inuvialuit and the Gwich’in over caribou hunting. Other activities are seasonal:
* Spring: fishing, geese hunting, grizzly hunting
* Summer: whaling, fishing, gathering berries, roots and medicinal plants
* Autumn: fishing, sealing, geese hunting, and plant gathering
* Winter: fishing, sealing, polar bear hunting

Traditional games include:
* &quot;akimuq&quot;: high kick game
* &quot;ayahaaq&quot;: string game
* &quot;iglukisaaq&quot;: juggling rocks
* &quot;mak&quot;: played by trying to make a person laugh
* &quot;napataak&quot;: darts; played with a wooden handle and sharp nail

==Communities==
The area of the land covered by the Inuvialuit Settlement Region is . Aklavik (Aklavik Indian Band, Ehdiitat Gwich’in Council) and Inuvik (Nihtat Gwich’in Council) are shared with the Gwich’in people, who are represented by the Gwich’in Tribal Council.

<doc id="910477" wikidata="Q1519482" url="?curid=910477" title="Gestational hypertension">
<text>Gestational hypertension or pregnancy-induced hypertension (PIH) is the development of new hypertension in a pregnant woman after 20 weeks&#x27; gestation without the presence of protein in the urine or other signs of pre-eclampsia. Gestational hypertension is defined as having a blood pressure 
greater than 140/90 on two occasions at least 6 hours apart.

== Signs and symptoms ==
No single diagnostic test currently exists to predict the likelihood of developing gestational hypertension. High blood pressure is the major sign in diagnosing gestational hypertension. Some women with gestational hypertension may present asymptomatic, but a number of symptoms are associated with the condition.

Symptoms
* Edema
* Sudden weight gain
* Blurred vision or sensitivity to light 
* Nausea and vomiting 
* Persistent headaches 
* Increased blood pressure

==Risk factors==
Maternal causes
*Obesity
*Mothers under 20 or over 40 years old
*Past history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension (particularly gestational hypertension) and renal disease
* Pre-existing hypertension
* Thrombophilias (anti-phospholipid syndrome, protein C/S deficiency, factor V Leiden)
* Having donated a kidney
Pregnancy
*Multiple gestation (twins or triplets, etc.)
*Placental abnormalities:
** Hyperplacentosis: Excessive exposure to chorionic villi
** Placental ischemia
Family history
* Family history of pre-eclampsia

==Diagnosis==
===Conditions===

There exist several hypertensive states of pregnancy:
;Gestational hypertension
:Gestational hypertension is usually defined as having a blood pressure higher than 140/90 measured on two separate occasions, more than 6 hours apart, without the presence of protein in the urine and diagnosed after 20 weeks of gestation.
;Pre-eclampsia
:Pre-eclampsia is gestational hypertension plus proteinuria (&gt;300 mg of protein in a 24-hour urine sample). Severe pre-eclampsia involves a blood pressure greater than 160/110, with additional medical signs and symptoms. HELLP syndrome is a type of pre-eclampsia. It is a combination of three medical conditions: hemolytic anemia, elevated liver enzymes and low platelet count.
;Eclampsia
:This is when tonic-clonic seizures appear in a pregnant woman with high blood pressure and proteinuria.

Pre-eclampsia and eclampsia are sometimes treated as components of a common syndrome.

==Treatment==

There is no specific treatment, but is monitored closely to rapidly identify pre-eclampsia and its life-threatening complications (HELLP syndrome and eclampsia).

Drug treatment options are limited, as many antihypertensives may negatively affect the fetus. ACE inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, and direct renin inhibitors are contraindicated in pregnancy as they are teratogenic. Methyldopa, hydralazine, nifedipine, and labetalol are most commonly used for severe pregnancy hypertension.

The fetus is at increased risk for a variety of life-threatening conditions, including pulmonary hypoplasia (immature lungs). If the dangerous complications appear after the fetus has reached a point of viability, even though still immature, then an early delivery may be warranted to save the lives of both mother and baby. An appropriate plan for labor and delivery includes selection of a hospital with provisions for advanced life support of newborn babies.

Exercise during pregnancy can help prevent hypertension as it can improve not only health for the mother but also the child. Exercise can regulate the energy needs required during pregnancy while also decreasing inflammation. Regular exercise can also lower the increased stress levels associated with pregnancy.

There have been significant findings on how exercising can help reduce the effects of hypertension just after one bout of exercise. Exercising can help reduce hypertension as well as pre-eclampsia and eclampsia. There have been findings in recent studies suggesting that exercising according to recommended guidelines during pregnancy can reduce the risk of developing gestational hypertensive disorder by 30%. The CDC recommends that during pregnancy, the pregnant women should exercise 150 minutes each week specifically focusing on aerobic activity at a moderate intensity. 

The acute physiological responses include an increase in cardiac output (CO) of the individual (increased heart rate and stroke volume). This increase in CO can inadvertently maintain the amount of blood going into the muscles, improving functionality of the muscle later. Exercising can also improve systolic and diastolic blood pressure making it easier for blood to pump to the body. Through regular bouts of physical activity, blood pressure can reduce the incidence of hypertension. A recent meta-analysis presented that exercise interventions in pregnant women could reduce both systolic and diastolic blood pressure. The meta-analysis study found that exercise is more likely to reduce the risk of hypertensive disorder of pregnancy in women who are more prone to developing hypertensive disorders of pregnancy. Risk factors that influence the likelihood of developing hypertensive disorders of pregnancy include, a maternal age of 40 or more, pre-pregnancy obesity, excess weight gain during pregnancy and gestational diabetes. 

Aerobic exercise has been shown to regulate blood pressure more effectively than resistance training. Compared to having a sedentary lifestyle, being physically active in aerobic exercise for 30-60 minutes 2-7 times a week significantly decreases the risk of gestational hypertension in pregnancy compared to a sedentary individual who is pregnant. It is recommended to see the effects of exercising, that a person should aim for 5-7 days/ week of aerobic exercise. This type of exercise should have an intensity of light to moderate, utilizing ~85% of max heart rate (220-age). Aerobic has shown a decrease in SBP by 5-15mmHg, versus resistance training showing a decrease of only 3-5mmHg. Aerobic exercises such as jogging, rowing, dancing, or hiking can decrease SBP the greatest. The decrease in SBP can regulate the effect of hypertension ensuring the baby will not be harmed. Resistance training takes a toll on the cardiovascular system in untrained individuals, leading to a reluctance in prescription of resistance training for hypertensive reduction purposes. 

==Evolutionary considerations==

===Humans===
Gestational hypertension is one of the most common disorders seen in human pregnancies. Though relatively benign on its own, in roughly half of the cases of gestational hypertension the disorder progresses into pre-eclampsia, a dangerous condition that can prove fatal to expectant mothers. However, gestational hypertension is a condition that is fairly rare to see in other animals. For years, it has been the belief of the scientific community that gestational hypertension and pre-eclampsia were relatively unique to humans, although there has been some recent evidence that other primates can also develop similar conditions, albeit due to different underlying mechanisms. The underlying cause of gestational hypertension in humans is commonly believed to be an improperly implanted placenta. Humans have evolved to have a very invasive placenta to facilitate better oxygen transfer from the mother to the fetus, to support the growth of its large brain.

===Origins of the placenta===

The origins of gestational hypertension may lie with the development of humans&#x27; hemochorial placenta. A hemochorial placenta optimizes the amount of oxygen and nutrients that can be absorbed into the fetal blood supply, while at the same time ensuring rapid diffusion of wastes away from the fetus. This hemochorial placenta differs from lower primates&#x27; epitheliochorial placentae in the way that it allows the fetal tissues to interact directly with the mother&#x27;s blood. The hemochorial placenta thereby promotes more rapid diffusion to and from the fetal blood supply. 
In animals with epitheliochorial placentae such as horses and pigs, the greatest resistance to maternal blood flow in the vascular system was found within the placenta. However, in animals with hemochorial placental structures such as rodents and primates, the vascular resistance in the placenta was low, leading scientists to the conclusion that the greatest resistance to maternal blood flow is found elsewhere in the maternal vascular system. The high vascular resistance outside of the placenta leads to higher maternal blood pressure throughout the body.

The fetal cells that implant into the uterine wall are known as the trophoblast. The hemochorial placenta bathes the fetal trophoblast in maternal blood by forming lacunae, or lakes, of the mother&#x27;s blood that surround fetal tissue. The lacunae are filled by the spiral arteries, which means that the mother&#x27;s blood pressure is the driving force behind the introduction of new blood, which contains both oxygen and food for the fetus, to the system. It is thought that humans need the increased diffusion provided by the hemochorial placenta in order to grow the large brains compared to their body size that distinguish them from other primates.

===Incorrect placental implantation===
It is thought that &quot;failings&quot; in normal hemochorial placental structure lead to pre-eclampsia and gestational hypertension. The human placenta implants &quot;earlier, deeper, and more extensively&quot; into the uterine wall, which can potentially lead to many problems that are found in human pregnancies, but not as much in other animals. Miscarriage and pre-eclampsia are both very rare in other species, but are two of the most common pregnancy-related diseases in humans. The genetic roots of gestational hypertension and pre-eclampsia are certain, as women with a family history of the condition are three times more likely to develop it when they are pregnant.

One of the potential causes of gestational hypertension and pre-eclampsia is when the trophoblast does not invade far enough into the uterine lining. When the fetus&#x27;s trophoblast does not fully extend into the uterine wall, the spiral arteries do not become fully converted into low-resistance channels. It has been found that this incomplete conversion of spiral arteries increases the resistance to uterine blood flow during pregnancy, and that this occurrence was associated with gestational hypertension. One potential cause of this incomplete breach of the spiral arteries that leads to gestational hypertension is a mistaken immune response by the maternal tissue, reaction to the alien fetal tissue. Therefore, it is clear that the complication of gestational hypertension has roots in the early implantation of the fetus in the uterine wall, an implantation technique that is unique to humans.

The highly invasive placenta that is found in humans is thought to be linked to humans&#x27; high circulating levels of the hormones CG and hCG. It has been shown that the higher the levels of these hormones, the deeper the trophoblast&#x27;s invasion into the uterine wall. Instances of gestational hypertension and pre-eclampsia have been shown to occur when the invasion of the uterine wall is not deep enough, because of lower CG and hCG levels in the mother.

===Evolutionary tradeoff===
Despite these risks for gestational hypertension, the hemochorial placenta has been favored because of its advantages in the way that it aids in diffusion from mother to fetus later in pregnancy. The bipedal posture that has allowed humans to walk upright has also led to a reduced cardiac output, and it has been suggested that this is what necessitated humans&#x27; aggressive early placental structures. Increased maternal blood pressure can attempt to make up for lower cardiac output, ensuring that the fetus&#x27;s growing brain receives enough oxygen and nutrients. The benefits of being able to walk upright and run on land have outweighed the disadvantages that come from bipedalism, including the placental diseases of pregnancy, such as gestational hypertension. Similarly, the advantages of having a large brain size have outweighed the deleterious effects of having a placenta that does not always convert the spiral arteries effectively, leaving humans vulnerable to contracting gestational hypertension. It is speculated that this was not the case with Neanderthals, and that they died out because their cranial capacity increased too much, and their placentae were not equipped to handle the fetal brain development, leading to widespread pre-eclampsia and maternal and fetal death.

Gestational hypertension in the early stages of pregnancy (trimester 1) has been shown to improve the health of the child both in its first year of life, and its later life. However, when the disease develops later in the pregnancy (subsequent trimesters), or turns into pre-eclampsia, there begin to be detrimental health effects for the fetus, including low birth-weight. It has been proposed that fetal genes designed to increase the mother&#x27;s blood pressure are so beneficial that they outweigh the potential negative effects that can come from pre-eclampsia. It has also been suggested that gestational hypertension and pre-eclampsia have remained active traits due to the cultural capacity of humans, and the tendency for midwives or helpers to aid in delivering babies.

===Relevance of evolutionary history===
It is the goal of evolutionary medicine to find treatments for diseases that are informed by the evolutionary history of a disease. It has been suggested that gestational hypertension is linked to insulin resistance during pregnancy. Both the increase in blood sugar that can lead to gestational diabetes and the increase in blood pressure that can lead to gestational hypertension are mechanisms that mean to optimize the amount of nutrients that can be passed from maternal tissue to fetal tissue. It has been suggested that techniques used to combat insulin insensitivity might also prove beneficial to those with gestational hypertension. Measures to avoid insulin resistance include avoiding obesity before pregnancy, minimizing weight gain during pregnancy, eating foods with low glycemic indices, and exercising.

<text>The Great Lakes Valley Conference (GLVC) is a college athletic conference affiliated with the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) at the Division II level. Its fifteen member institutions are located in the U.S. states of Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, and Missouri. There are also four associate members who participate in sports not sponsored by their home conference.

==History==
===Formation===


The GLVC grew out of discussions that started in 1972 between the athletic directors of Kentucky Wesleyan College, Bellarmine College (today Bellarmine University), and Indiana State University at Evansville (renamed University of Southern Indiana in 1985), with the goal of forming a men&#x27;s basketball conference. The discussions eventually included Indiana Central University (renamed University of Indianapolis in 1986), Saint Joseph&#x27;s College, and Ashland College (today Ashland University). On July 7, 1978, at a meeting in Louisville hosted by Bellarmine, these six schools formed the GLVC, with the intention of competing in the 1978–79 season. Ashland, though considered a charter member, did not begin conference play until the league&#x27;s second season, in 1979–80. From the time of its founding, the GLVC has been a member of NCAA Division II.

While the origins of the conference&#x27;s name are lost to history, its initial footprint was bordered by the Great Lakes in the north and the Ohio Valley in the south. Following Southern Indiana&#x27;s departure in July 2022, Indianapolis is the only remaining charter member.

The GLVC has been led by a full-time commissioner since 1996, first Carl McAloose (1996–2000), then Jim Naumovich (2000–present). The conference office is located in Indianapolis. From 1978 to 1996, the Faculty Athletics Representatives (FARs) of the member institutions were responsible for operating the conference. The FARs (rather than the athletic directors) still cast the institutional votes at meetings where the presidents and chancellors are not present. This feature gives the GLVC a governance structure that is unique among Division I and Division II conferences.

Though conceived as a men&#x27;s basketball league, the GLVC from the start planned to sponsor championships in golf, tennis, baseball, cross country, and track &amp; field. The conference crowned golf and tennis champions in 1978-79 and added cross country and baseball the following year. Soccer became the sixth sport rather than track &amp; field, with the first conference tournament held in 1980. In 1982, when the demise of the Association of Intercollegiate Athletics for Women (AIAW) brought women&#x27;s college athletics under the NCAA, the GLVC began to sponsor women&#x27;s sports. Within two years, the conference added women&#x27;s championships in basketball, tennis, cross country, volleyball, and softball.

===Expansion of membership and sport sponsorship===
The conference experienced steady growth through the first three decades of its existence, expanding from six members to sixteen. The first addition was Lewis University in 1980, followed in 1984 by Indiana University – Purdue University Fort Wayne (IPFW; the athletic program is now Purdue Fort Wayne), then Northern Kentucky University in 1985 and Kentucky State University in 1989. The conference lost its first members with the departure of Ashland and Kentucky State, effective summer 1995, but increased in size when Quincy University, Southern Illinois University Edwardsville (SIUE) and the University of Wisconsin–Parkside began competition that fall, followed by the University of Missouri–St. Louis (UMSL) one year later. These changes initiated a westward shift in the GLVC&#x27;s geographical footprint that has continued to the present.

The 1990s also featured an expansion in sports sponsorship. In 1995–96 the GLVC crowned its first champions in women&#x27;s soccer and in men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s track and field. Women&#x27;s golf was added in 1998–99, followed by men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s indoor track and field in 1999–2000. These additions increased the total number of conference sports from eleven to seventeen.

After IPFW left in 2001 to move to Division I, the GLVC considered further expansion, but not before redefining conference membership in 2005 to require the athletic program of each member to include seven core sports (men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s basketball, women&#x27;s volleyball, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s soccer, softball, and baseball). The eleven members at the time all sponsored these sports, and subsequent new members would be required to sponsor them as well. Previously, the GLVC had no sports sponsorship requirement other than the NCAA Division II minimum (that every member must sponsor at least ten sports, including men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s basketball). The conference began awarding the Commissioner&#x27;s Cup to the member institution with the greatest success across the seven core sports, while continuing to award its All-Sports Trophy to the most successful program overall.

In the fall of 2005, the GLVC welcomed three more members—Drury University, Rockhurst University, and the University of Missouri-Rolla (known as Missouri University of Science and Technology, or Missouri S&amp;T, since 2008). SIUE left for Division I and the Ohio Valley Conference in 2008, but the conference continued to grow with the additions of Maryville University and the University of Illinois Springfield, which began GLVC competition in the fall of 2009. The GLVC reached sixteen members with the admission of William Jewell College, which began competing in fall 2011.

As the conference continued to grow, basketball remained its strongest sport, and the conference tournament, usually including both genders at the same neutral site, became its signature event. A GLVC team played in the championship game of the NCAA Division II men&#x27;s basketball tournament in eleven consecutive seasons (1993-94 through 2003–4). Kentucky Wesleyan, winner of four men&#x27;s national championships prior to the creation of the GLVC, won four more as a conference member, while Southern Indiana, Bellarmine, and Drury won one apiece, and Northern Kentucky won two women&#x27;s national championships. Meanwhile, the GLVC became the leading Division II conference in swimming and diving. During its first decade in the conference, Drury won ten men&#x27;s national championships and four women&#x27;s national championships in the sport. After men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s swimming and diving became conference sports in 2013–14, the annual GLVC swimming and diving meet grew to become the most financially lucrative of the conference&#x27;s championship events, surpassing the basketball tournament.

The admission of William Jewell, approved in October 2009, gave the conference six football-playing members (along with Indianapolis, Kentucky Wesleyan, St. Joseph&#x27;s, Quincy, and Missouri S&amp;T), the minimum number needed to sponsor the sport. This set in motion plans to crown a football champion, ultimately starting in fall 2012. The addition of football in the GLVC&#x27;s 35th year of competition was a historic move, as no conference at any level of the NCAA (Division I, II, or III) founded without football had ever added it after existing for so long as a non-football conference. Before competition began, the original six football-playing members were joined by new full member McKendree University and the GLVC&#x27;s first associate members, Central State University and Urbana University, to give the conference nine teams for its initial football season. Though they competed in the GLVC for just one year, Central State and Urbana eventually were followed by a dozen other schools admitted to the league as associates in one or more sports while maintaining full membership elsewhere.
Just as the GLVC was adding football, the conference lost two of its premier basketball programs. In the fall of 2012, Northern Kentucky moved to Division I and the Atlantic Sun Conference (ASUN), and one year later, Kentucky Wesleyan left to become a charter member of the newly formed Great Midwest Athletic Conference (G-MAC). Meanwhile, the GLVC welcomed Truman State University into the conference, to begin competition in 2013–14. The additions of McKendree (coinciding with the departure of Northern Kentucky) and Truman State (coinciding with the departure of Kentucky Wesleyan) kept the GLVC at sixteen members.

In 2014, a unique interconference football partnership with the Mid-America Intercollegiate Athletics Association (MIAA) allowed Lincoln University and Southwest Baptist University to join the GLVC in football while otherwise remaining MIAA members. That autumn, the GLVC became the first NCAA Division II conference to create an inclusive league-wide digital streaming network – the GLVC Sports Network (GLVCSN), which subsequently broadcast football and all other conference sports.

Drury and Bellarmine started wrestling programs for the 2016–17 season, enabling the conference to add wrestling as its 21st championship sport. The initial seven-team GLVC wrestling lineup also included Indianapolis, Maryville, McKendree, Truman State, and Wisconsin–Parkside, all former Division II wrestling independents.

In July 2017, the GLVC announced the addition of men&#x27;s lacrosse as its 22nd championship sport, in partnership with the Gulf South Conference (GSC) and Peach Belt Conference (PBC). The initial six-team lineup for spring 2018 included Indianapolis, Maryville, and four southern associate members (Young Harris College, the University of Alabama in Huntsville, the University of Montevallo, and Shorter University). The partnership lasted for three seasons, after which the GLVC and GSC-PBC each had enough lacrosse-playing members to offer separate championships in the sport.

===Recent history===
Charter member St. Joseph&#x27;s College closed in May 2017 because of financial troubles. One year later, Wisconsin–Parkside left the GLVC to join the Great Lakes Intercollegiate Athletic Conference (GLIAC). Their departures reduced the conference to fourteen members.

In fall 2019 conference membership returned to 16 with the addition of two schools from the MIAA, Southwest Baptist (elevated from football-only associate to full membership) and Lindenwood University. Their admission voided the MIAA-GLVC football partnership of the previous five seasons (2014 through 2018) and resulted in Lincoln rejoining MIAA football. After just one year the conference reverted to fifteen members, as charter member Bellarmine moved to Division I and the ASUN, effective fall 2020.

In 2019 the GLVC and G-MAC established the annual America&#x27;s Crossroads Bowl in Hobart, Indiana, featuring their highest-ranking football teams not qualifying for the NCAA Division II playoffs. In the 2021 and 2022 seasons, members of the two conferences also played a two-game crossover in the third and fourth Saturdays of the football season.

The GLVC added two women&#x27;s sports for 2019–20, bowling and lacrosse, bringing the total number of conference sports to 24. In women&#x27;s bowling, the initial lineup included 2017 national champion McKendree, fellow full members Drury, Lewis, and Maryville, plus associate members Lincoln, the University of Central Missouri, and Upper Iowa University. In women&#x27;s lacrosse, the initial lineup in spring 2020 consisted of seven full members—regional powers Lindenwood and Indianapolis, along with Lewis, Maryville, McKendree, Quincy, and Rockhurst. The two sports were an immediate success, with Lindenwood (2021) and Indianapolis (2022) winning national championships in women&#x27;s lacrosse and McKendree (2022) winning its second national title in women&#x27;s bowling.

In March 2020, GLVC winter and spring sport competitions ended when the NCAA suspended play due to the COVID-19 pandemic. For the 2020–21 academic year, the GLVC held its fall 2020 conference sport competitions in spring 2021. Of the sixteen Division II conferences sponsoring football at the time, the GLVC was one of just four (with the G-MAC, Mountain East Conference, and South Atlantic Conference) to crown a football champion in spring 2021.

The most recent departures from the GLVC came at the end of the 2021–22 academic year, when charter member Southern Indiana joined Lindenwood in moving to Division I and the Ohio Valley Conference, temporarily reducing the league to thirteen schools. They were replaced by associate member Upper Iowa, admitted to the GLVC as a full member effective fall 2023, and former football associate Lincoln, admitted effective fall 2024.

With the addition of new members, the GLVC amended the core sports requirement that had been in place since 2005. Starting in 2023–24, all full members must sponsor men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s basketball, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s soccer, four additional men&#x27;s sports, and four additional women&#x27;s sports.

In July 2024, the GLVC announced that it would begin sponsoring men&#x27;s volleyball in the 2026 season (2025–26 academic year), with an initial lineup consisting of full members Maryville, Missouri S&amp;T, Quincy, Rockhurst, and Southwest Baptist, plus associate members Roosevelt University and Thomas More University. In January 2025, the GLVC announced that it would begin sponsoring STUNT, also in the 2026 season (2025–26 academic year), with an initial lineup consisting of full members Maryville, Quincy, Southwest Baptist, Drury, and Lewis, plus associate member East Stroudsburg University. These additions brought the total number of conference sports sponsored to 26 (13 men&#x27;s, 13 women&#x27;s).

===Divisional play===
The GLVC first adopted divisional play in 1996, for women&#x27;s volleyball only. That sport competed in Blue and Green divisions (named for the conference&#x27;s colors) until 2004, when it returned to a single table. All other sports competed in a single table until the conference expanded to fourteen members in 2005, when two seven-team divisions were adopted for basketball and most other core sports.

The organizational structure of the conference has varied dramatically since then, reflecting changes in membership and in the overall number of league members. As an added variable, the same structure has never been applied across all sports in any given year. For example, since 2005, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s basketball has played in two divisions in ten seasons (from 2005–06 through 2008–09 and again from 2011–12 through 2016–17), three divisions in five seasons (2009–10, 2010–11, 2017–18, 2020–21, and 2021–22), and in a single table in four seasons (2018–19, 2019–20, 2022–23, and 2023–24). Meanwhile, during the same years, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s soccer always played a single table. Two-division structures have been labeled East-West or Blue-Green, while three-division structures have been labeled East-West-North or East-West-Central.

As of 2024–25, the GLVC has divisional play in men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s tennis, and plays a single table in all other sports with regular season competition.

===Membership timeline===



==Sports sponsorship==
===Conference sports===
The seven sports indicated with a green background were designated &quot;core sports&quot; and required of all full members from 2005 to 2023. Effective fall 2023, all full members are required to sponsor men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s basketball, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s soccer, four additional men&#x27;s sports, and four additional women&#x27;s sports.

===Men&#x27;s conference sports, by school===

===Women&#x27;s conference sports, by school===

===Non-conference NCAA sports, by school===


===NCAA emerging sports for women, by school===
These sports are not yet sponsored by enough NCAA members nationwide to be added to the official list of championship sports. Triathlon has had the status of an emerging sport since 2014, wrestling since 2020, and STUNT since 2023. Wrestling becomes an official NCAA championship sport in 2025–26. No full GLVC member sponsors any of the remaining current emerging sports (acrobatics &amp; tumbling, equestrian, and rugby).


===Non-NCAA varsity sports===
Some GLVC members give varsity status to teams in non-NCAA sports and to other club teams, such as men&#x27;s bowling (because the NCAA governs only the women&#x27;s sport). Other examples are sprint football, a weight-restricted variant of American football, sponsored by Quincy, and the men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s ice hockey teams of McKendree and Maryville, which compete at the club level in the American Collegiate Hockey Association (ACHA). While some GLVC members administer their club sports through their athletics departments, others operate their club sports as student organizations outside of athletics.

==Conference facilities==
==National champions==
Since the founding of the conference, members of the GLVC have won 34 NCAA Division II national championships and two NCAA National Collegiate championships (indicated in green). &quot;National Collegiate&quot; is the NCAA&#x27;s official term to describe championship events open to members of more than one NCAA division.

<text>Maureen Lucille Hemphill ( Miller; January 26, 1937) is a retired Canadian politician from the province of Manitoba. She served in the cabinet of NDP Premier Howard Pawley, and was an unsuccessful candidate for the party&#x27;s leadership in 1988.

She is the daughter of James Leroy Miller and Elaine Agnes McParlor, born in Grand Forks, British Columbia, and was educated at Bralorne. She served on the Assiniboine South School Board in 1969, 1970 and 1973. She married H. David Hemphill but they had divorced by the 1980s.

Hemphill first ran for the provincial legislature in 1977, in the southwest Winnipeg riding of Charleswood. She came a distant second behind Progressive Conservative leader Sterling Lyon, whose party defeated Edward Schreyer&#x27;s New Democratic Party to win the election.

The Manitoba NDP regained power under Howard Pawley&#x27;s leadership in 1981, and Hemphill was easily elected for the north-central Winnipeg riding of Logan (former Mayor of Winnipeg Stephen Juba came a distant second behind her running as an independent candidate). Hemphill was appointed Minister of Education on November 30, 1981, and retained this position for the entirety of the Pawley government&#x27;s first mandate. She increased state support for private and parochial schools while holding this portfolio, despite the NDP&#x27;s historical objections to such funding.

Hemphill was re-elected without difficulty in 1986 (defeating future Liberal MLA Kevin Lamoureux) and was appointed Minister of Business Development and Tourism on April 17, 1986. On September 21, 1987, a cabinet shuffle made her the Minister of Community Services.

After the Pawley government lost a parliamentary vote of non-confidence in 1988, Hemphill became a candidate to serve as the party&#x27;s new leader. She placed fourth on the first ballot, and gave her support to third-place candidate Andy Anstett, who was eliminated on the second ballot. Afterward, she supported Len Harapiak, who lost to Gary Doer.

Hemphill was re-elected in the 1988 Manitoba general election, albeit by a reduced margin. She was not a candidate in 1990.

In 1993, Hemphill ran for the national New Democratic Party in the riding of Winnipeg North Centre, but placed second to incumbent Liberal David Walker.

<text>The British Army Training Unit Suffield (BATUS) is a British Army unit located at the vast training area of Canadian Forces Base Suffield near Suffield, Alberta, Canada. BATUS is the British Army&#x27;s largest armoured training facility, and it can accommodate live-firing and tactical effect simulation (TES) exercises up to battle group level. CFB Suffield is seven times the size of the Salisbury Plain Training Area in England and 19% of the size of Northern Ireland, offering the British Army the ability to conduct large exercises that UK military bases cannot accommodate.

== History ==

A British chemical weapons testing facility was located in French-controlled Algeria. However, upon the conquest of France by Germany in 1940, the facility was lost. The British could find no suitable location in the UK, and an agreement was signed between Canada and the UK to allow the Suffield area to become available to British scientists for testing. Consequently, British and Canadian forces employed the area for a variety of experiments. Upon the end of World War II, the British departed the Suffield area and it was formally taken over by the Canadian Defence Research Board.

In 1969, Colonel Gaddafi led a coup in Libya, took control of the country and proceeded, after negotiations, to close down British military installations located at El Adem and Tobruk, and American installations located near Tripoli. This presented the UK with a problem, as there were no areas large enough to allow the British Army to undertake large-scale armoured warfare exercises in Europe. In 1971 a 10-year lease was signed between the British and Canadian Governments that authorized battle group training to take place in the Suffield area by the British Army. In January 1972, the British Army Training Unit Suffield was formally established. In July, the first live rounds were fired by the 4th Royal Tank Regiment Battle Group. In 1981, the lease for Suffield was extended, and in 1991, the lease was again extended. In 2006, on the expiration of this lease, the British and Canadian governments concluded an agreement that would allow British forces to maintain their training practices in Canada indefinitely.

Reports in September 2020 suggested that tank training at BATUS could be brought to an end as the Challenger 2 tanks age. Mayor of nearby city Medicine Hat, Ted Clugston (along with local MP Glen Motz) expressed concern about this, saying the base has been a &quot;major economic stabilizing force since the 1970s&quot;. A 2007 estimate suggested that the unit injects $100 million into the local economy. In November 2021, reports suggested that the base would be closed in favour of the Omani-British Joint Training Area in Oman, however this was denied by Defence Secretary Ben Wallace who added that the base would see &quot;change&quot; but would not close. The MOD Press Office stated that the base would remain &quot;a vital training base for the British Army&quot;.

In October 2021, 29 (BATUS) Flight AAC, which provided range reconnaissance, CASEVAC (casualty evacuation) and limited lift of passengers and equipment to BATUS with Gazelle helicopters, was placed in suspended animation, leaving BATUS with no UK aviation support.

In 2023, all British military assets were removed from Suffield after the UK MOD announced reduction of training areas for the next two years.

As of December 2024, the British Army was not using the base.

== Current ==

Due to the hostile winters, BATUS conducts training from May to October each year. This normally consists of four to six battle groups (BGs) each exercising for around 30–38 days, supported by the BATUS permanent and temporary staff and a dedicated enemy (traditionally provided by a single nominated regiment). There are relatively few service personnel permanently posted to BATUS (229 as of 2019, along with 250 dependent children), but their numbers are significantly increased by temporary staff who form the bulk of the Operations Group (Ops Gp) who design and deliver the most complex live fire and simulated fully instrumented training for Armoured, Infantry and Strike Battlegroups. This, as well a large proportion of the camp-based supporting organisations, including a dedicated logistics squadron and a REME workshop. Permanent postings to BATUS last two years. French-speaking local actors are often hired for exercises, to give soldiers experience of working with non-English-speaking civilians.

A 30-day exercise, Prairie Fire, operates four times a year. It aims to precisely replicate the experience of being transported to a warzone, fighting, and returning to the UK. During the exercise, soldiers fight fictional &quot;Donovians&quot; in &quot;Atropia&quot;.

1,400 soldiers and over 1,000 vehicles, including 22 Challenger 2 tanks and 103 Bulldog armoured fighting vehicles (AFVs), are based in BATUS, alongside an undisclosed number of Warrior infantry fighting vehicles (IFVs), AS-90 self-propelled artillery, Trojan combat engineering vehicles, Titan armoured bridge layers and formerly Gazelle helicopters, until their retirement in October 2023 (previously used by 29 (BATUS) Flight AAC).

<text>Kelmė (; ; Yiddish: קעלם) is a city in northwestern Lithuania, a historical region of Samogitia. It has a population of 8,206 and is the administrative center of the Kelmė District Municipality.

==Name==
Kelmė&#x27;s name is likely derived from the Lithuanian word &quot;kelmynės&quot;, literally: &quot;the stubby place&quot;, because of the forests that were there at the time of its founding. The Yiddish name is Kelm, as in Kelm Talmud Torah.

==History==
Kelmė was first mentioned in 1416, the year that Kelmė&#x27;s first church was built. It was located in the Duchy of Samogitia in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania within the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth.

Prior to World War II, Kelmė () was home to a famous Rabbinical College, the Kelm Talmud Torah. According to an 1897 census, 2,710 of Kelme&#x27;s 3,914 inhabitants were members of the town&#x27;s Jewish population, the vast majority of whom were merchants and traders and lived in the town. Most of the Jews in Kelmė rural district were murdered during a mass execution on 29 July 1941. On August 22 a second mass execution occurred. On 2 October 1941, some Kelmė and Vaiguva Jews were murdered in Žagarė. The executions were committed by the Germans soldiers, auxiliary police and Lithuanian collaborators. In total, the number of victims is 1,250-1,300 people.

<text>The National Socialist Front (, NSF) was at the time of its dissolution the largest Neo-Nazi political party in Sweden. The organization was founded in Karlskrona on 8 August 1994. It became a political party on 20 April 1999, the 110th birthday of Adolf Hitler. The party&#x27;s official newspaper—now defunct—was named &quot;Den Svenske Nationalsocialisten&quot; (&quot;The Swedish National Socialist&quot;), also known as &quot;Den Svenske&quot; (&quot;The Swedish&quot;).

The party ran in the municipal council elections in Karlskrona in 2002, but only attracted 0.5% of the votes which was not sufficient for a mandate. In 2006 the party entered the elections at a national level. There it gained 1,417 votes, or 0.03% (in order to enter the Swedish parliament a party needs at least 4% of the total votes). The party was most successful in Trollhättan, where it received 208 votes or 0.65%, although this was not enough to enter the municipal assembly. 2006 was the best election year in the party&#x27;s history.

In 2007, the NSF demonstrated in Stockholm for the release of Holocaust denier Ernst Zündel.

The party had as its main goals the abolition of democracy, the repatriation of immigrants, internment of communists into work camps, a repeat of the Holocaust and the implementation of scientific racism and cutting taxes for families with many genetically healthy children. The NSF also launched a campaign to defend Mel Gibson over the criticism he received from Abraham Foxman for making the film &quot;The Passion of the Christ&quot;.

The National Socialist Front had a mandatory political uniform dress code during marches and demonstrations, which included a black combat-sweater or shirt, black military-cap, boots, khaki-coloured combat pants and the party&#x27;s logo on the arms. This uniform was taken out of use after the police stated in 2006 that it was a hate crime to wear them during demonstrations. The members of the party often wore a blue T-shirt with yellow text that said &quot;NSF&quot; after this.

==History==
The party was formed in 1994 by a number of sympathisers of the former White Aryan Resistance (Swedish: Vitt Ariskt Motstånd) in Karlskrona. From the beginning 1994 to December 1999, the party was led by Anders Högström. When he left, he introduced a so-called reich council consisting of Anders Ärleskog and Daniel Höglund. Anders Högström left NSF to instead become involved in the Social Democrats. As of April 1999, the National Socialist Front saw itself as a party political organization, but never registered a party designation.

Several people related to the organization were convicted of violent crime which was against the public. Among other things, the perpetrators of the Malexander murders 1999 had connections to NSF. One of the perpetrators, Andreas Axelsson, had previously been a member of NSF in a shorter period, and an ex-neo-Nazi and Yugoslav Wars mercenary and war criminal Jackie Arklöv, who assumed responsibility for the shooting of the two policemen, had written a letter to NSF&#x27;s partition.

The National Socialist Front was sometimes focussed on media because of outward activities such as demonstrations and fly-spreading. NSF&#x27;s former uniform was abolished before the 2006 election and then a blue T-shirt with yellow text was often used on which it was called &quot;NSF&quot;. The previous uniforms included: black military-like cap, party logo tags on the arms, black long-sleeved sweater, beige combat pants and optional black boots. Among the propaganda party spread there was an extensive sale of white power products, including CDs, via the Internet.

== Party program ==
The organization was hierarchically structured with a central management and subgroups. The action program showed that the organization worked for, among other things, national self-sufficiency, repatriation of all overseas immigrants, establishing a state race control to &quot;secure the mental and biological health of the Nordic race&quot; as well as state control of mass media. The overall objective was to &quot;pave the way for a national socialist power access&quot; and then abolish democracy. The National Socialist Front would introduce a people&#x27;s government under the Nordic leadership and responsibility principle, consisting of expert representatives selected within the various professions, which would only serve the people in the country of birth. Even the death penalty for serious sexual offenses and treason was included in the program. The organizationion wanted Sweden to exit from the European Union and the United Nations. The party also wanted to abolish the aid to communist states and dictatorships.

==Dissolution==
The National Socialist Front was officially dissolved on 22 November 2008. A new party, the People&#x27;s Front (&quot;Folkfronten&quot;), was founded at the same time with the same people in charge. The People&#x27;s Front was later reconstituted as the Party of the Swedes which ran in the 2010 and 2014 general elections and received about 1,000 votes in the 2014 election to the European Parliament, before being dissolved the following year.

<text>The C.D. Howe Building (French: Édifice C.D.-Howe) is an office tower in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, that is the home of Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada, the Office of the Auditor General and other smaller tenants. It was built by Olympia and York. The federal government sold the land to O&amp;Y for a dollar and signed an agreement to lease the final building for a set rate until 2012. The eleven-story building was opened in 1978. The building site was once The Embassy Restaurant from 1953 to 1974.

== Description ==

It was named after C. D. Howe, a noted federal minister in the 1930s, 1940s and 1950s. It is located at the prominent intersection of Bank Street and Sparks Street. The lower levels of the building contain a shopping mall named 240 Sparks. The mall covers 3 floors with 50 stores including a Holt Renfrew store (closed 2015).

The most notable element of the building&#x27;s interior is the amount of greenery and the large waterfall. Public Works and Government Services greened the rooftop to address environmental concerns including energy conservation, storm water management, biodiversity, and air quality, and to provide the occupants a landscaped tranquil outdoor space. More than 30% of the roof is landscaped and grows indigenous flowers, grasses and shrubs. Another 30% of the rooftop uses green roof technology. The C.D. Howe Building was included amongst other architecturally interesting and historically significant buildings in Doors Open Ottawa in both 2012 and 2014.
The two elevator banks contain two storey tall cars that rise in a large atrium that stretches the entire height of the building.

The C.D. Howe Building was recognized by the Building Owners and Managers Association (BOMA) as the &quot;Government Office Building of the Year - Canada&quot; in 1997/98 for excellence in management. The award was presented to the Property Manager, Ronald Vadeboncoeur RPA, FMA, CPM in Halifax, Nova Scotia. He accepted on behalf of his team, including key members: Sue Baxter, Barry O&#x27;Regan, Paul Anderson, Celine Maisonneuve, Pierre Boucher and Frank Donovan.

<doc id="910505" wikidata="Q7249983" url="?curid=910505" title="Proof-theoretic semantics">
<text>Proof-theoretic semantics is an approach to the semantics of logic that attempts to locate the meaning of propositions and logical connectives not in terms of interpretations, as in Tarskian approaches to semantics, but in the role that the proposition or logical connective plays within a system of inference.

==Overview==

Gerhard Gentzen is the founder of proof-theoretic semantics, providing the formal basis for it in his account of cut-elimination for the sequent calculus, and some provocative philosophical remarks about locating the meaning of logical connectives in their introduction rules within natural deduction. The history of proof-theoretic semantics since then has been devoted to exploring the consequences of these ideas.

Dag Prawitz extended Gentzen&#x27;s notion of analytic proof to natural deduction, and suggested that the value of a proof in natural deduction may be understood as its normal form. This idea lies at the basis of the Curry–Howard isomorphism, and of intuitionistic type theory. His inversion principle lies at the heart of most modern accounts of proof-theoretic semantics.

Michael Dummett introduced the very fundamental idea of logical harmony, building on a suggestion of Nuel Belnap. In brief, a language, which is understood to be associated with certain patterns of inference, has logical harmony if it is always possible to recover analytic proofs from arbitrary demonstrations, as can be shown for the sequent calculus by means of cut-elimination theorems and for natural deduction by means of normalisation theorems. A language that lacks logical harmony will suffer from the existence of incoherent forms of inference: it will likely be inconsistent.

<doc id="910509" wikidata="Q350793" url="?curid=910509" title="Hybrid bicycle">
<text>Hybrid bicycles blend characteristics from more specialized road bikes, touring bikes and mountain bikes. The resulting &quot;hybrid&quot; is a general-purpose bike that can tolerate a wide range of riding conditions and applications. Their stability, comfort and ease of use make them popular with novice cyclists, casual riders, commuters, and children.

Hybrids typically borrow the flat, straight handlebars and upright seating posture of a mountain bike, which many bicyclists find comfortable and intuitive. Hybrids also employ the lighter weight, thinner wheels and smooth tires of road bikes, allowing for greater speed and less exertion when riding on the road. Hybrid bikes often have places to mount racks and bags for transporting belongings, much like a touring bike.

Hybrid bikes have spawned numerous sub-categories satisfying diverse ridership. They are classified by their design priorities, such as those optimized for comfort or fitness — and those offered as city, cross or commuter bikes.

==History==

From the early 20th century until after World War II, the utility roadster constituted most adult bicycles sold in the United Kingdom and in many parts of the British Empire. In Britain, the roadster declined noticeably in popularity during the early 1970s, as a boom in recreational cycling caused manufacturers to concentrate on lightweight , affordable derailleur sport bikes, actually slightly-modified versions of the racing bicycle of the era. In the 1980s, U.K. cyclists began to shift from road-only bicycles to all-terrain models such as the mountain bike. The mountain bike&#x27;s sturdy frame and load-carrying ability gave it additional versatility as a utility bike, usurping the role previously filled by the roadster. By 1990, the roadster was almost dead; while annual U.K. bicycle sales reached an all-time record of 2.8 million, almost all of them were mountain and road/sport models. A different situation, however, was occurring in most Asian countries: roadsters are still widely made and used in countries such as China, India, Thailand, Vietnam and others as well in parts of north-western Europe. 

==Trekking bike==

A trekking bike is a hybrid with all the accessories necessary for bicycle touringmudguards, pannier rack, lights etc.

==Cross bike==
Cross bikes use a road bicycle frame similar to a racing or sport/touring bicycle, and are normally equipped with nearly flat handlebars to provide a more upright riding position than a racing or sport/touring bike. As a hybrid bike intended for general recreational and utility use, the &quot;cross bike&quot; differs from the cyclo-cross bicycle, which is a racing bicycle purposely designed to compete in the sport of cyclo-cross competition. Cross bikes are fitted with 700c (ISO 622) wheels using somewhat wider semi-treaded tires () than those fitted to most racing or sport/touring models.
The additional tire width and tread is intended to give the cross bike hybrid some ability to deal with rough or littered surfaces that might be encountered on paved or unpaved bike trails, such as gravel, leaves, hard-packed sand, and shallow mud. Most cross bikes are biased towards moderate off-pavement use and light weight, and as such are not normally fitted with fenders, lights, or carrier racks. The larger 700c wheels are a little faster on paved surfaces and can give an advantage for longer trips or for touring purposes.

==Commuter bike==
The commuter bike is a hybrid designed specifically for commuting over short or long distances. It typically features derailleur gearing, 700c wheels with fairly light tires, a carrier rack, full fenders, and a frame with suitable mounting points for attachment of various load-carrying baskets or panniers. It sometimes, though not always, has an enclosed chainguard to allow a rider to pedal the bike in long pants without entangling them in the chain. A well-equipped commuter bike typically features front and rear lights for use in the early morning or late evening hours encountered at the start or end of a business day.

==City bike==

Similar to the commuter bike, the city bike is more optimized for urban commuting. Unlike the European city bike, it has mountain bike heritage, gearing, and strong yet lightweight frame construction. It usually features mountain bike-sized 26-inch (ISO 559) wheels, a more upright seating position, and &quot;middleweight&quot; heavy belted tires designed to withstand road hazards commonly found in the city, such as broken glass. Using a sturdy welded chromoly or aluminium frame derived from the mountain bike, the city bike is more capable at handling urban hazards such as deep potholes, drainage grates, and jumps off city curbs. City bikes are designed to have reasonably quick, yet solid and predictable handling, and are normally fitted with full fenders for use in all weather conditions. A few city bikes may have enclosed chainguards, others may have suspension forks, similar to mountain bikes. City bikes may also come with front and rear lighting systems for use at night or in bad weather.

==Comfort bike==

Another subclass of the hybrid category is the comfort bike. Comfort bikes are essentially modern versions of the old &quot;roadster&quot; and &quot;sports roadster&quot; bicycle, though modern comfort bikes are often equipped with derailleur gears rather than hub gears. They typically have a modified mountain bike frame with a tall head tube to provide an upright riding position, 26-inch (ISO 559) or 28-inch (ISO 622) wheels, and &quot;middleweight&quot; smooth or semi-slick tires. Comfort bikes typically incorporate such features as front suspension forks, seat post suspension with wide plush saddles, and drop-center, angled North Road-style handlebars designed for easy reach while riding in an upright position.

<text>The colobium sindonis (Latin for &quot;shroud tunic&quot;) is a simple sleeveless white linen shift worn by British monarchs during part of the coronation service. It symbolises divesting oneself of all worldly vanity and standing bare before God. The monarch is continually robed and disrobed during the ceremony, according to ancient custom.

Following the anointing in the coronation service, the colobium sindonis is placed over the monarch&#x27;s clothes, and then the supertunica, a long robe of gold brocade, is placed over that. Wearing these garments, the monarch is invested with the regalia, crowned and enthroned. Both garments are removed before the final procession out of the abbey. Both of these robes are of very ancient design; those used by the medieval kings of England were said to have been used by King Edward the Confessor at his coronation in 1043, however these were destroyed by the Parliamentarians after the English Civil War. Up until George V, a new colobium sindonis was usually made for each coronation; however, Charles III wore his great grandfathers George V colobium sindonis for his coronation in 2023.

<text>Arctocephalus forsteri (common names include the Australasian fur seal, South Australian fur seal, New Zealand fur seal, Antipodean fur seal, or long-nosed fur seal) is a species of fur seal found mainly around southern Australia and New Zealand. The name &quot;New Zealand fur seal&quot; is used by English speakers in New Zealand; kekeno is used in the Māori language. , the common name long-nosed fur seal has been proposed for the population of seals inhabiting Australia.

Although the Australian and New Zealand populations show some genetic differences, their morphologies are very similar, and thus they remain classed as a single species. After the arrival of humans in New Zealand, and particularly after the arrival of Europeans in Australia and New Zealand, hunting reduced the population to near-extinction.

==Description==
Males have been reported as large as ; their average weight is about . Males can be long. Females are between 30 and 50 kg (66-110 lbs) on average, and can be as long as . Newborn pups are 3.3–3.9 kg (7.3-8.6 lbs) on average, and between 40 and 55 cm (1.3-1.8 ft) long. At 290 days old males are about , and females are about . Like other otariids, they have external ears and hind flippers that rotate forward, which visibly distinguish them from true seals. They have a pointy nose with long pale whiskers. Fur seals are covered by two layers of fur. The coat is grey-brown on their back, and lighter on their belly. Some have white tips on longer upper hairs, which can give them a silver-like appearance.

So called &quot;Upland Seals&quot; once found on Antipodes Islands and Macquarie Island have been claimed as a distinct subspecies with thicker furs by scientists although it is unclear whether these seals were genetically distinct.

==Distribution==
The species occurs in Australia and New Zealand. It is found in the coastal waters and on the offshore islands of southern Australia, from the south-west corner of Western Australia to just east of Kangaroo Island in South Australia, and also in southern Tasmania and the subantarctic Macquarie Island. Small populations are forming in Bass Strait and coastal waters of Victoria and New South Wales as far as the mid-north coast. Before the arrival of humans in New Zealand, the species bred around all the New Zealand mainland and its subantarctic islands. There are now established and expanding colonies around the entire South Island, on Stewart Island and all of the New Zealand subantarctic islands. There are also newly established breeding colonies on the North Island.

==Behaviour==

===Diving===
The species can &quot;porpoise&quot; out of the water when travelling quickly at sea. They can dive deeper and longer than any other fur seal. Females can dive for about 9 minutes and to a depth of about 312 metres, and can dive deeper and longer in autumn and winter. Males can dive for about 15 minutes to a depth of about 380 metres. On average, the species typically only dives for 1–2 minutes. When they dive for food they dive deeper during the day but shallower at night, because during the day their prey typically migrates to deeper depths and migrates back up during the night (diel vertical migration).
Lactating females alter their dive patterns in order to regularly care for their young. Dives are shorter, from around 9 minutes down to 5 minutes. Several longer trips may be taken at first to find patches of prey. The shorter dives then utilise these patches. Due to the differences in diving pattern between males and females, there is very little inter-sexual competition for food sources. Males typically forage over continental shelf breaks in deeper water, while females typically utilise the continental shelf as foraging grounds. It is believed that differences in diving abilities and depths could be the cause of some sexual dimorphism between males and females.

Diving behaviour by the pups begins in the months leading up to weaning, when the pups are nursing less. The pups begin to dive from the age of 6–10 months, yet weaning is known to occur between the ages of 8 and 11 months, so the young pups do not have much time to learn to forage. The pups need to progressively develop nocturnal diving skills while they still have their mothers&#x27; milk to fall back on if dives are unsuccessful. Age, physiological development, and experience are important factors for success in hunting and contribute to the development of the pups&#x27; diving ability and behaviour. This transitional period, when young pups are becoming nutritionally independent while their foraging efficiency is rather low, is a time of high risk, and mortality can be very high. Based on scat samples, it has been found that the pups start by eating cephalopods and eventually making their way to fish, but this may just be a result of prey availability during different times of the year.

===Communication===
Males vocalise through a bark or whimper, either a guttural threat, a low-intensity threat, a full threat, or a submissive call. Females growl and also have a high-pitched pup attraction wail call. Pup-attraction calls allow communication from longer distances. Once together, females use olfactory recognition to confirm the pup as their own. In males, the full neck display is a non-combative posture that functions as a threat to surrounding males by which they are able to assess each other&#x27;s dominance status.

===Reproduction===
Females mature between 4 and 6 years old, and males mature between 8 and 10 years old. These seals are polygynous. Males obtain and guard territory in late October before females arrive. Often females mate only once a year, and this usually occurs eight days postpartum for about 13 minutes on average. Females have a delayed implantation of the fertilised egg, so that implantation on the uterine wall does not occur for 3 months. Gestation occurs for 9 months Females are more aggressive near the time of birth, and do not like to be approached right after birth. Females will continue to reproduce until their death which is on average between 14 and 17 years of age.

Females first arrive on the shore between November and January, just a few days before giving birth, and stay close to the birth site for up to ten days. When they are close to labour they become very restless and irritable. When beginning labour, which can last as much as five hours, they lie down and toss their head in the air, straining forward on their fore flippers, lifting their hind quarters, or moving laterally, before slowly lowering their head down, a process they repeat until they finally give birth. In one study, observations of the actual birth, starting from when the pup was first seen, found an average of 2 minutes for a head-first delivery, but an average of 6.5 minutes if the pup came out tail first. Immediately after birth the mother begins frequently sniffing the newborn pup to better identify when she has to find it after a trip out to sea. Pups are fairly mature at birth, and within 60 minutes they start suckling for about 7 minutes. Eventually the suckling can exceed 33 minutes.

The mothers may take from 45 minutes to 3 days before leaving the pups to swim, and 6–12 days to go on longer feeding trips. Even then, the mothers tend to not leave the pups for longer than 2 days. When the pups are about 21 days old they have been seen to congregate into little pods while their mothers are away. When the females return they only feed their own pups, and have been seen to be hostile toward pups that are not their own.

Female seals have been documented to have a gradual increase in trips for feeding throughout lactation. It has been found that mothers who have sons made longer foraging trips then the mothers who had daughters during the lactation period. When observing growth patterns in the male and female pups within two cohorts, it is recognised that the growth patterns are similar, however the males grow faster and are weaned off nursing heavier in some years. Suckling can occur for about 300 days. Pups start to eat solid food just before weaning, and are eventually weaned around September, when they disperse.

Pup mortality has been attributed to both natural factors and human interaction. The biggest natural cause of death for pups is starvation, followed by suffocation in the amnion, stillbirth, trampling, drowning, and predation. Human factors include the handling of pups, tagging, and human presence in general.

==Diet==
Their diet includes cephalopods, fish, and birds. In New Zealand, New Zealand octopus and arrow squid make up most of their cephalopod diet. Individuals located near their southern range limit have been known to eat penguins as part of their diet. Stomach contents have been analysed and shown to include Australian anchovy, barracouta, &quot;Paralichthyes&quot; flounders, broadgilled hagfish, pouched lamprey, red cod, school shark, and many other species. Further analysis of otoliths from their scat show that for fish prey species, lanternfishes composed the majority of their fish diet, followed by Australian anchovies, ahuru, and hoki. There are different factors that affect their diet, such as season, sex, breeding, surrounding colony, oceanography, and climatic patterns.

==Predators==
Known predators are killer whales, sharks, male New Zealand sea lions, and possibly leopard seals. New Zealand sea lions are also known to target pups as their prey. Several regurgitations by sea lions have been found to contain remains of fur seal pups, some with plastic tags previously attached to female fur seal pups.

==Human impact==

Before the arrival of humans, the seals bred around all of New Zealand. Hunting by the first New Zealand settlers, the Māori, reduced their range. Commercial hunting from shortly after the European discovery of New Zealand in the 18th century until the late 19th century reduced the population near to extinction.

Today, commercial fisheries are one of the main causes of death in New Zealand fur seals, usually by entanglement and drowning. Monitoring of these pinnipeds in the Kaikōura region found that entanglements with green trawl nets and plastic strapping tape were the most common. A little less than half of the individuals were successfully released with good chances of survival even after significant entanglement wounds. It has been estimated by the Royal Forest and Bird Protection Society that over 10,000 seals could have drowned in nets between 1989 and 1998. They are also known to have been shot by commercial and recreational fishermen, because they are assumed to interfere with fishing gear. How often these shootings occur is unknown, but pressure groups have stated that the conflict between the seals and commercial fisheries is expected to increase. On 21 August 2014, two decomposing animals were found beheaded near Louth Bay in South Australia. The circumstances of their deaths were considered suspicious and an investigation followed their discovery. In 2015, several conservative members of Parliament encouraged public debate around the potential implementation of seal culling in South Australia in response to increasing interactions with South Australian commercial fisheries. , the killing of long-nosed fur seals remains an illegal act.

Human activity near seal rookeries has been correlated with distress and panic, resulting in indirect deaths of pups. The use of metal cattle ear tags on pups has also been associated with a decrease in pup fitness due to incomplete healing of the tag site.

=== Legislative protection ===

====Australia====
In Australian Commonwealth waters, &quot;Arctocephalus forsteri&quot; is protected under the &quot;Environment Protection Biodiversity Conservation (EPBC) Act 1999,&quot; under which it is listed as a protected marine species. The species is also protected within the jurisdictions of the following Australian states:
The species received protection by the creation of the 16 million hectare Macquarie Island Marine Park, located on the eastern side of Macquarie island. In 2000, the Tasmanian government extended the Macquarie Island Nature Reserve by 3 nautical miles surrounding the island.

====New Zealand====
In New Zealand, the species is protected by the &quot;Marine Mammals Protection Act 1978&quot;, which works to conserve marine animal species; it specifies that all wild pinnipeds cannot be touched or fed.

<text>The Empire of Atlantium is a micronation and secular,
pluralist progressive lobby group based in New South Wales, Australia.

&quot;&quot; described Atlantium in 2006 as &quot;a refreshing antidote to the reactionary self-aggrandisement of so many micronations&quot;, and &quot;an extremely sophisticated nation-state experiment, as well as an entirely serious claimant to legitimate statehood&quot;. The book&#x27;s entry on Atlantium notes its espousal of &quot;progressive, liberal policies&quot; and characterises it as a &quot;secular humanist utopia&quot;.

Among the causes Atlantium supports are the right to unrestricted international freedom of movement, the right to abortion, the right to assisted suicide and decimal calendar reform.

In 2015, the micronation had almost 3,000 &quot;citizens&quot;, most of whom signed up online from over a hundred countries, and have never been to Atlantium.

==History==

Atlantium was established in 1981 by three Sydney teenagers – George Francis Cruickshank, Geoffrey John Duggan and Claire Marie Coulter (née Duggan). The three claimed a &quot;provisional territory&quot; in the southern suburb of Narwee as Atlantium&#x27;s first capital, and declared Cruickshank to be Sovereign head of state, with the title &quot;Emperor George II&quot;. Geoffrey Duggan was elected as prime minister in 1982, serving until 1986. Damian Scott held the position from 1986 to 1988 and Kevin Fanucchi became Prime Minister in 1988, but by 1990, when the original group members had graduated from university and moved away, the group ceased to be active.

In 1999 Cruickshank purchased an apartment in the inner Sydney suburb of Potts Point, and soon after revived Atlantium, launching a website, which was instrumental in attracting new members. The apartment, known as the Imperium Proper, became the second capital of Atlantium. Concordia became the third capital of Atlantium on 12 January 2008, when the rural Province of Aurora, approximately southwest of Sydney, was created. The Atlantium website describes Aurora as Atlantium&#x27;s &quot;global administrative capital, ceremonial focal point and spiritual homeland&quot;.

==Status and operations==

The Atlantium website used several different self-descriptions, including &quot;self-declared state&quot;, &quot;aspirant microstate&quot; and &quot;global sovereign state&quot;. In line with its claim to be a &quot;primarily non-territorial&quot; state Atlantium does not maintain any formal territorial claims; however, it does promote the idea that Cruickshank&#x27;s apartment, and the Province of Aurora, have extraterritorial status. In practice these properties remain under Australian jurisdiction.

No established nation had recognised Atlantium&#x27;s sovereignty claims, and it had no reciprocal diplomatic relations. Atlantium had appointed &quot;unaccredited diplomatic representatives&quot; called &quot;Imperial Legates&quot; in the United States, Pakistan, Poland, Brazil, India, Italy, Iran, Singapore, Serbia and Switzerland. The group had awarded &quot;Imperial Honours&quot; to various recipients, generally in recognition of political activism or for service to local communities.

==Stamps, coins and banknotes==

Stamps, coins and banknotes were sold by Atlantium, which used a decimal currency system of 100 imperial centi to the imperial solidus. Atlantium&#x27;s website claimed that the profits from those sales are used for &quot;the Empire&#x27;s ongoing operations&quot; as well as charitable causes.

The earliest documented media report referring to Atlantium is a 1984 philatelic magazine article about its cinderella stamp releases. There were 12 issues of Atlantian stamps.

Atlantium minted coins, though the levels of Atlantian economic activity remained low. The first coin was the 20th anniversary 10 solidi coin, which has a likeness of George Cruickshank as the obverse and the imperial eagle as the reverse. In 2011, a 30 solidi coin was issued to commemorate the 30th anniversary of Atlantium. The coin had the likeness of George Cruickshank on the obverse and the wedge-tailed eagle (&quot;Aquila audax&quot;) on the reverse and was struck in cupronickel and plated with 9 carat gold. Banknotes of Atlantium were denominated in imperial solidi (10, 25, 50 and 100 imperial solidi) and are currently divided into a 2006 series and a 2007 series.

==Citizenship==

, Atlantium had almost 3,000 citizens from (and still therein residing due to the small area of the Empire of Atlantium) over 100 countries. The website names individuals holding such functions as minister, director, magister and imperial legate. Atlantium said its citizenship does not supersede existing citizenships. Atlantians contend that they are all dual citizens, and that Atlantium actively encourages its citizens to participate in the political processes of their resident countries.

In late 2016, Atlantium stopped accepting citizenship requests according to a reply posted on the official Facebook page. On 1 January 2018 the citizen application process was re-opened, charging a US$25 fee.

<doc id="910519" wikidata="Q5659251" url="?curid=910519" title="Harmonic conjugate">
<text>In mathematics, a real-valued function formula_1 defined on a connected open set formula_2 is said to have a conjugate (function) formula_3 if and only if they are respectively the real and imaginary parts of a holomorphic function formula_4 of the complex variable formula_5 That is, formula_6 is conjugate to formula_7 if formula_8 is holomorphic on formula_9 As a first consequence of the definition, they are both harmonic real-valued functions on formula_10. Moreover, the conjugate of formula_11 if it exists, is unique up to an additive constant. Also, formula_7 is conjugate to formula_6 if and only if formula_6 is conjugate to formula_15.

==Description==
Equivalently, formula_16 is conjugate to formula_7 in formula_10 if and only if formula_7 and formula_6 satisfy the Cauchy–Riemann equations in formula_9 As an immediate consequence of the latter equivalent definition, if formula_7 is any harmonic function on formula_23 the function formula_24 is conjugate to formula_25 for then the Cauchy–Riemann equations are just formula_26 and the symmetry of the mixed second order derivatives, formula_27 Therefore, a harmonic function formula_7 admits a conjugated harmonic function if and only if the holomorphic function formula_29 has a primitive formula_4 in formula_31 in which case a conjugate of formula_7 is, of course, formula_33 So any harmonic function always admits a conjugate function whenever its domain is simply connected, and in any case it admits a conjugate locally at any point of its domain.

There is an operator taking a harmonic function &quot;u&quot; on a simply connected region in formula_34 to its harmonic conjugate &quot;v&quot; (putting e.g. &quot;v&quot;(&quot;x&quot;0) = 0 on a given &quot;x&quot;0 in order to fix the indeterminacy of the conjugate up to constants). This is well known in applications as (essentially) the Hilbert transform; it is also a basic example in mathematical analysis, in connection with singular integral operators. Conjugate harmonic functions (and the transform between them) are also one of the simplest examples of a Bäcklund transform (two PDEs and a transform relating their solutions), in this case linear; more complex transforms are of interest in solitons and integrable systems.

Geometrically &quot;u&quot; and &quot;v&quot; are related as having &quot;orthogonal trajectories&quot;, away from the zeros of the underlying holomorphic function; the contours on which &quot;u&quot; and &quot;v&quot; are constant cross at right angles. In this regard, &quot;u&quot; + &quot;iv&quot; would be the complex potential, where &quot;u&quot; is the potential function and &quot;v&quot; is the stream function.

==Examples==

For example, consider the function formula_35

Since
formula_36
and
formula_37
it satisfies
formula_38
(formula_39 is the Laplace operator) and is thus harmonic. Now suppose we have a formula_3 such that the Cauchy–Riemann equations are satisfied:

formula_41
and
formula_42

Simplifying,
formula_43
and
formula_44
which when solved gives
formula_45

Observe that if the functions related to and were interchanged, the functions would not be harmonic conjugates, since the minus sign in the Cauchy–Riemann equations makes the relationship asymmetric.

The conformal mapping property of analytic functions (at points where the derivative is not zero) gives rise to a geometric property of harmonic conjugates. Clearly the harmonic conjugate of &quot;x&quot; is &quot;y&quot;, and the lines of constant &quot;x&quot; and constant &quot;y&quot; are orthogonal. Conformality says that contours of constant and will also be orthogonal where they cross (away from the zeros of ). That means that &quot;v&quot; is a specific solution of the orthogonal trajectory problem for the family of contours given by &quot;u&quot; (not the only solution, naturally, since we can take also functions of &quot;v&quot;): the question, going back to the mathematics of the seventeenth century, of finding the curves that cross a given family of non-intersecting curves at right angles.

==Harmonic conjugate in geometry==

There is an additional occurrence of the term harmonic conjugate in mathematics, and more specifically in projective geometry. Two points &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; are said to be harmonic conjugates of each other with respect to another pair of points &quot;C, D&quot; if the cross ratio (&quot;ABCD&quot;) equals −1.

<doc id="910527" wikidata="Q5162593" url="?curid=910527" title="Conrad Santos">
<text>Conrado de Regla Santos (November 26, 1934 – February 29, 2016) was a politician in the province of Manitoba, Canada. He was a member of the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 1981 to 1988, and again from 1990 to 2007. Conrado as his family and friends called him, had three children: Evelyn Santos, Conrad Santos and Robert Santos.

The son of Federico Santos and Marcelina de Regla, he was born in the Philippines and was educated at Harvard University and the University of Michigan, receiving a PhD in political science from the latter institution. He moved to Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada in 1965 after receiving a teaching position at the University of Manitoba, where he retired from in 2008. Santos has also worked as a consultant for the Instituto Centro-Americano de Administracion Publica in Costa Rica, and was a board member of the Citizenship Council of Manitoba from 1977 to 1980.

He sought the New Democratic Party of Manitoba (NDP) nomination for Fort Garry in the 1973 election, but was defeated. He ran for the Winnipeg City Council in 1977 and 1980, but lost both times.

Santos was first elected to the Manitoba legislature in the 1981 provincial election as a New Democrat in the northwest Winnipeg riding of Burrows, defeating NDP-turned-Progressive Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA) Ben Hanuschak. He was re-elected in the 1986 election. In June 1984, there were unconfirmed rumours that he was considering a move to the Progressive Conservative Party.

Santos lost the Burrows NDP nomination to Doug Martindale in 1988, and subsequently entered the party&#x27;s leadership election. He was not regarded as a prominent candidate, and received only five votes on the first ballot. He ran for mayor of Winnipeg in 1989, and finished a distant fourth.

In 1990, Santos won the NDP nomination for Broadway by a single vote over Marianne Cerilli, whose candidacy was supported by the party leadership. He defeated Liberal incumbent Avis Gray in the 1990 general election, and was re-elected in the 1995 election. In 1995, he endorsed Lorne Nystrom&#x27;s bid to lead the federal NDP.

When the Broadway riding was eliminated by redistribution in 1999, Santos won the NDP nomination in Wellington (also in Winnipeg&#x27;s northwest), and was returned by a wide margin in the 1999 provincial election. He was again re-elected in the 2003 election.

Santos was named Deputy Speaker after the elections of 1986 and 1999.

Santos left the New Democratic Party caucus shortly before the 2007 provincial election after being accused of improperly selling party membership cards. He campaigned as an independent, and finished last in a field of five candidates. He later pleaded guilty to paying the membership fees of as many as one hundred new party members, during the time when he was trying to retain his nomination. He was fined $200 under the provincial Election Finances Act, as well as court fees of $150. His lawyer argued that Santos was simply trying to help his low-income supporters, saying that the MLA &quot;didn&#x27;t have the heart&quot; to request membership fees from people who were unable to feed their families.

He married Emerita Maglaya. Santos died in Winnipeg on February 29, 2016, at the age of 81.

<doc id="910529" wikidata="Q649127" url="?curid=910529" title="South American fur seal">
<text>The South American fur seal (Arctocephalus australis) breeds on the coasts of Peru, Chile, the Falkland Islands, Argentina, Uruguay and Brazil. The total population is around 250,000. However, population counts are sparse and outdated. Although Uruguay has long been considered to be the largest population of South American fur seals, recent census data indicates that the largest breeding population of A. a. australis (that breeds in Chile, the Falkland Islands, Argentina, Uruguay) are at the Falkland Islands (estimated pup abundance ~36,000) followed by Uruguay (pup abundance ~31,000). The population of South American fur seals in 1999 was estimated at 390,000, a drop from a 1987 estimate of 500,000 - however a paucity of population data, combined with inconsistent census methods, makes it difficult to interpret global population trends.

==Description==
South American fur seals have a dark grey or brown coat of fur. Adult males are much larger than females, with thicker necks and larger shoulders. Males also develop manes of longer guard hairs on their neck and shoulders.
Size of the seals varies based on region, but on average, adult males measure up to 2 m long and weigh 150–200 kg and females measure up to 1.5 m long and weigh 30–60 kg. Newborns are 60 to 65 cm and 3.5 to 5.5 kg.

==Distribution and habitat==
The South American fur seal is found on neotropical ocean coasts from the Paracas Peninsula of southern Peru south to Cape Horn on the Pacific coast, and northward to southern Brazil on the Atlantic coast. They are also found on the Falkland Islands, Staten Island, and Escondida Island. 
&quot;A. australis&quot; seals prefer rocky shores and islands, particularly those with steep slopes. They have been found in sea caves in Peru, where some climb up to 15 m to find a spot to rest. There have been isolated records from continental Ecuador, the Galápagos Islands, and the Gorgona Island (Colombia). 
Anatomical information for the southern fur seals, &quot;Arctocephalus&quot; spp., is scant. In addition, little is known about the foraging ecology of South American fur seals. Recent tracking studies reveal that South American fur seals breeding at the Falkland Islands use a vast area of the Patagonian Shelf.

==Subspecies==
Two subspecies are currently recognised:
* &quot;A. a. australis&quot; - Falkland Islands
* &quot;A. a. gracilis&quot; - South America

The New Zealand fur seal is sometimes considered a subspecies of &quot;A. australis&quot;.

<text>Amundsen Gulf is a gulf located mainly in the Inuvik Region, Northwest Territories, Canada with a small section in the Kitikmeot Region of Nunavut. It lies between Banks Island and Victoria Island and the mainland. It is approximately in length and about across where it meets the Beaufort Sea.
The Amundsen Gulf was explored by Norwegian explorer Roald Amundsen between 1903 and 1906. The gulf is at the western end of the famous Northwest Passage, a route from the Atlantic Ocean to the Pacific.

Few people live along the shores of the gulf, but there are a few towns and communities, including Sachs Harbour, Ulukhaktok, and Paulatuk. Heading north in the gulf one would find the Prince of Wales Strait. Heading southeast and east, the gulf leads through the Dolphin and Union Strait, past Simpson Bay and into the Coronation Gulf. From there one would go through the Dease Strait and into the Queen Maud Gulf, and eventually head northeast into the Victoria Strait. Heading west and northwest a traveller would first enter the Beaufort Sea and then the Arctic Ocean.
The entire gulf is in the Arctic tundra climate region, characterized by extremely cold winters. In late winter the Amundsen Gulf is covered in sea ice. Most of the ice breaks up in July during a normal year, with some areas in the far eastern and northern part of the gulf only breaking up in August.

Beluga whales, seals, Arctic char, cod, and even salmon use the waters of the gulf. Sockeye and pink salmon appeared for the first time in nearby waters between 1999 and 2001.

<doc id="910535" wikidata="Q2259176" url="?curid=910535" title="Common land">
<text>Common land is collective land (sometimes only open to those whose nation governs the land) in which all persons have certain common rights, such as to allow their livestock to graze upon it, to collect wood, or to cut turf for fuel.

A person who has a right in, or over, common land jointly with another or others is usually called a commoner.

In Great Britain, common land or former common land is usually referred to as a common; for instance, Clapham Common and Mungrisdale Common. Due to enclosure, the extent of common land is now much reduced from the hundreds of square kilometres that existed until the 17th century, but a considerable amount of common land still exists, particularly in upland areas. There are over 8,000 registered commons in England alone.

==Origins==

Originally in medieval England the common was an integral part of the manor, and was thus part of the estate held by the lord of the manor under a grant from the Crown or a superior peer (who in turn held his land from the Crown; it is sometimes said that the Crown was held to ultimately own all land under its domain). This manorial system, founded on feudalism, granted rights of land use to different classes. These could be &quot;appurtenant&quot; rights whose ownership attached to tenancies of particular plots of land held within a manor. A commoner would be the person who, for the time being, was the occupier of a particular plot of land. Most land with appurtenant commons rights is adjacent to the common. Other rights of common were said to be &quot;in gross&quot;, that is, they were unconnected with tenure of land. This was more usual in regions where commons were more extensive, such as in the high ground of Northern England or in the Fens, but also included many village greens across England and Wales. 

Historically manorial courts defined the details of many of the rights of common allowed to manorial tenants, and such rights formed part of the copyhold tenancy whose terms were defined in the manorial court roll.

Example rights of common are:

* Pasture. Right to pasture cattle, horses, sheep or other animals on the common land. The most widespread right.
* Piscary. Right to fish.
* Turbary. Right to take sods of turf for fuel.
* Common in the Soil. This is a general term used for rights to extract minerals such as sands, gravels, marl, walling stone and lime from common land.
* Mast or pannage. Right to turn out pigs for a period in autumn to eat mast (beech mast, acorns and other nuts).
* Estovers. Right to take sufficient wood for the commoner&#x27;s house or holding; usually limited to smaller trees, bushes (such as gorse) and fallen branches.

On most commons, rights of pasture and pannage for each commoner are tightly defined by number and type of animal, and by the time of year when certain rights could be exercised. For example, the occupier of a particular cottage might be allowed to graze fifteen cattle, four horses, ponies or donkeys, and fifty geese, whilst the numbers allowed for their neighbours would probably be different. On some commons (such as the New Forest and adjoining commons), the rights are not limited by numbers, and instead a &quot;marking fee&quot; is paid each year for each animal &quot;turned out&quot;. However, if excessive use was made of the common, for example, in overgrazing, a common would be &quot;stinted&quot;, that is, a limit would be put on the number of animals each commoner was allowed to graze. These regulations were responsive to demographic and economic pressure. Thus rather than let a common become degraded, access was restricted even further.

The lord of the manor must only exercise his rights so far as to leave a &quot;sufficiency&quot; of resource for commoners. This was at issue in 1889 when the lord of the manor and owner of Banstead Downs and Heath, a Mr Hartopp, excavated gravel and threatened to reduce the available pasture. The meaning of sufficiency was challenged in court, expert witnesses stated that the grazing capacity was 1,200 animals, the commoners rights totalled 1,440 animals, and 600 animals were normally turned out. It was decided sufficiency was whether enough grazing would be available for all the animals that could be turned out. The judgment was that &quot;The Lord is bound to leave pasture enough to satisfy the commoners rights whether such rights are to be exercised or not&quot;. Commoners also have the right to &quot;peaceful enjoyment&quot; of their rights, so that they cannot be hindered by the lord of the manor. This was first proposed in 1500 and became case law in 1827.

==Types of common==

===Pasture commons===
Pasture commons are those where the primary right is to pasture livestock. In the uplands, they are largely moorland, on the coast they may be salt marsh, sand dunes or cliffs, and on inland lowlands they may be downland, grassland, heathland or wood pasture, depending on the soil and history. These habitats are often of very high nature conservation value, because of their very long continuity of management extending in some cases over many hundreds of years. In the past, most pasture commons would have been grazed by mixtures of cattle, sheep and ponies (often also geese). The modern survival of grazing on pasture commons over the past century is uneven.

The use of hefting (or heafing) – the characteristic of some breeds of sheep for example, keeping to a certain &quot;heft&quot; (a small local area) throughout their lives – allows different farmers in an extensive landscape such as moorland to graze different areas without the need for fences while maintaining their effective individual interest in them, as each ewe remains on her particular area. Lambs usually learn their heft from their mothers. Also known as &#x27;hoofing&#x27; in some areas like North Yorkshire. This ability to keep sheep from straying without fences is still an important factor in sheep farming on the extensive common land in upland areas.

===Arable and haymeadow commons===
Surviving commons are almost all pasture, but in earlier times, arable farming and haymaking were significant, with strips of land in the common arable fields and common haymeadows assigned annually by lot. When not in use for those purposes, such commons were grazed. Examples include the common arable fields around the village of Laxton in Nottinghamshire, and a common meadow at North Meadow, Cricklade.

===Lammas rights===
&quot;Lammas rights&quot; entitled commoners to pasture following the harvest, between Lammas day, 12 August (N.S.), to 6 April, even if they did not have other rights to the land. Such rights sometimes had the effect of preventing enclosure and building development on agricultural land.

==Enclosure and decline==

Most of the medieval common land of England was lost due to enclosure. In English social and economic history, enclosure or inclosure is the process which ends traditional rights such as mowing meadows for hay, or grazing livestock on common land formerly held in the open field system. Once enclosed, these uses of the land become restricted to the owner, and it ceases to be land for the use of commoners. In England and Wales the term is also used for the process that ended the ancient system of arable farming in open fields. Under enclosure, such land is fenced (&quot;enclosed&quot;) and &quot;deeded&quot; or &quot;entitled&quot; to one or more owners. The process of enclosure began to be a widespread feature of the English agricultural landscape during the 16th century. By the 19th century, unenclosed commons had become largely restricted to large areas of rough pasture in mountainous areas and to relatively small residual parcels of land in the lowlands.

Enclosure could be accomplished by buying the ground rights and all common rights to accomplish exclusive rights of use, which increased the value of the land. The other method was by passing laws causing or forcing enclosure, such as Parliamentary enclosure. The latter process of enclosure was sometimes accompanied by force, resistance, and bloodshed, and remains among the most controversial areas of agricultural and economic history in England.

Enclosure is considered one of the causes of the British Agricultural Revolution. Enclosed land was under control of the farmer who was free to adopt better farming practices. There was widespread agreement in contemporary accounts that profit making opportunities were better with enclosed land. Following enclosure, crop yields and livestock output increased while at the same time productivity increased enough to create a surplus of labour. The increased labour supply is considered one of the factors facilitating the Industrial Revolution.

Following the era of enclosure, there was relatively little common land remaining of value although some residual commoners remained until the end of the Second World War. By that time lowland commons had become neglected because the commoners were able to find better-paid work in other sectors of the economy. As a result they largely stopped exercising their rights; relatively few commoners exist today.

==Modern use==
Much common land is still used for its original purpose. The right to graze domestic stock is by far the most extensive commoners right registered, and its ongoing use contributes significantly to agricultural and rural economies. Rights to graze sheep are registered on 53% of the Welsh and 16% of the English commons. Cattle are registered on 35% of Welsh and 20% of English commons, whilst horses and ponies are registered on 27% of Welsh and 13% of English commons. In some cases rights to graze goats, geese and ducks are registered, whilst in others the type of livestock is not specified. These figures relate to the number of common land units, and due to discrepancies in the registers and large numbers of small commons with no rights in England, the apparent distinction between Wales and England may be exaggerated.

Today, despite the diverse legal and historical origins of commons, they are managed through a community of users, comprising those who hold rights together with the owner(s) of the soil. Such communities generally require joint working to integrate all interests, with formal or informal controls and collaborative understandings, often coupled with strong social traditions and local identity.

However, 26% of commons in Wales, and as many as 65% in England, have no common rights shown on the registers. Such areas are derived from wastes of manors, where rights probably existed formerly. When such open habitats are no longer grazed they revert to scrub and then dense woodland, losing the grassy or heathland vegetation which may have occupied the land continuously for many centuries. In 2007, Ashdown Forest, the Sussex heathland which was the setting for the Winnie-the-Pooh stories, became the centre of a dispute between some local residents and the forest&#x27;s governing body, the Board of Conservators, which is responsible for administering the forest&#x27;s 24 km2 of common land. The conservators wished to restore the forest&#x27;s landscape to one that predominantly consisted of heathland—its defining characteristic until the mid-twentieth century, but something that was in danger of being lost after the Second World War as a result of the advance of woodland into traditional heathland areas when, as one commentator stated:

The conservators were forced to intervene to stem the invasion of trees, scrub and bracken that threatened the ecologically precious heathlands, cutting down saplings, removing scrub and mowing the bracken. Some residents complained that the results looked like a First World War battle field. This is not a problem restricted to this common, but according to Jonathan Brown writing in the Independent on 21 April 2007 &quot;similar debates are raging between locals and the authorities at other heathland areas in the New Forest and Surrey&quot;.

In 2008 the Foundation for Common Land was created in the UK to try to enhance the understanding and protection of commons.

==Governing law in England and Wales==
The legal position concerning common land has been confused, but recent legislation has sought to remedy this and remove the legal uncertainties so that commons can be better used and protected.

Most commons are based on ancient rights under British common law, which pre-date statutes passed by the Parliament of England. The exact usufruct rights which apply to individual commons were in some cases documented, but more often were based on long-held traditions. A major reform began in 1965, with a national register of common land which recorded the land ownership and the rights of any commoners, and two other important statutes have followed.

Owners of land in general have all the rights of exclusive ownership, to use the land as they wish. However, for common land the owner&#x27;s rights are restricted, and other people known as commoners have certain rights over the land. The landowner may retain other rights to the land, such as rights to minerals and large timber, and to any common rights left unexercised by the commoners. The commoners will continue to exercise their rights, or have a document which describes their rights, which may be part of the deeds of another property. A number of commoners still exercise rights, for example, there are 500 practising commoners in the New Forest, and there is a federation of commoners in Cumbria. In many cases commons have no existing commoners, the rights having been neglected.

===Erection of Cottages Act 1588===
It was a common a belief that if a squatter and their friends could—between sunrise and sunset in a single day—build a house on common land, raise the roof over their head and light a fire in the hearth, then they would have the right of undisturbed possession. The belief—sometimes called &quot;keyhole tenure&quot;, and which persisted as recently as the early 20th century—was actually a fallacy, but to stop landless peasants unlawfully squatting on commons, the Erection of Cottages Act 1588 (31 Eliz. 1. c. 7) was introduced.

===Commons Act 1876===

Under the (39 &amp; 40 Vict. c. 56) some 36 commons in England and Wales were regulated. The act also enabled the confirmation of orders providing for the inclosure of common land or common fields.

===Commons Act 1899===

The (62 &amp; 63 Vict. c. 30) provides a mechanism of enabling district councils and National Park authorities to manage commons where their use for exercise and recreation is the prime consideration and where the owner and commoners do not require a direct voice in the management, or where the owner cannot be found. There are at least 200 schemes of management made under the 1899 act.

===Law of Property Act 1925===

The Law of Property Act 1925 (15 &amp; 16 Geo. 5. c. 20), which still forms the core of English property law, has two provisions for common land:
* Section 193 gave the right of the public to &quot;air and exercise&quot; on metropolitan commons and those in pre-1974 urban districts and boroughs. This constituted about one fifth of the commons, but the 1925 act did not give this right to commons in essentially rural areas (although some urban districts had remarkably rural extent, such as the Lakes Urban District), which had to wait for the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000.
* Section 194 restricted the inclosure of commons, which would now require Ministerial consent.

===Commons Registration Act 1965===

The UK government regularised the definitions of common land with the Commons Registration Act 1965 (c. 64), which established a register of common land.

Not all commons have owners, but all common land by definition is registered under Commons Registration Act 1965, along with the rights of any commoners if they still exist. The registration authorities are the county councils, and when there is no ownership, a local council, such as a parish council is normally given guardianship by vesting the property under section 8 the act.

An online database of registered common land was compiled by DEFRA in 1992–93 as part of a survey of the condition and wildlife of commons. The official up to date registers of common land are held by the commons registration authorities.

The following registration information is held:

* Land Section

This includes a description of the land, who applied to register the land, and when the land became finally registered. There are also related plans which show the boundaries of the land.

* Rights Section

This includes a description of the rights of common (e.g. a right to graze a certain number of sheep), the area of common over which the right is exercisable, the name of the holder of the right and whether the right is attached to land in the ownership of the holder of the right (the commoner) or is a right held in gross i.e. unattached to land.

* Ownership Section

This includes details of the owner(s) of the common land. Entries in this section however, are not held to be conclusive.

Numerous inconsistencies and irregularities remained, mainly because a period of only three years was given for registration submissions. However, there is now an opportunity to clear these up under the 2006 act, and to add land omitted under the 1965 act.

===Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000===
Other than for those commons covered by the Law of Property Act 1925, the Commons Act 1899 and certain other statutes, the public did not have the right to use or enjoy common land if they were not a commoner. However, the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000 (c. 37) gave the public the freedom to roam freely on all registered common land in England and Wales. The new rights were introduced region by region through England and Wales, with completion in 2005. Maps showing accessible areas have been produced, and are available online as &quot;open access maps&quot; produced by Natural England. Commons are included in the public access land now shown on the Ordnance Survey Explorer maps.

===Commons Act 2006===
The Commons Act 2006 (c. 26) is an important recent piece of legislation.

The act:

* Enables commons to be managed more sustainably by commoners and landowners working together through commons councils with powers to regulate grazing and other agricultural activities
* Provides better protection for common land and greens – this includes reinforcing existing protections against abuse, encroachment and unauthorised development
* Recognises that the protection of common land has to be proportionate to the harm caused and that some specified works can be carried out without the need for consent
* Requires commons registration authorities to bring their registers up-to-date by recording past changes affecting the registers during a &#x27;transitional period&#x27;, and to keep the registers up-to-date by recording new changes affecting the registers – commons registration authorities will have new powers to correct many of the mistakes in the registers
* Sets out new, clearer criteria for the registration of town or village greens
* Prohibits the severance of rights of common grazing, preventing commoners from selling, leasing or letting their rights away from the property to which rights are attached, though temporary severance of such rights is permitted for renewable terms of up to two years (in England) and five years (in Wales).

Several hundred square kilometres of &#x27;waste land&#x27; that was provisionally registered under the Commons Registration Act 1965 was not, in fact, finally registered. As a consequence, it ceased to be recognised as common land. A partial remedy for this defect in the earlier legislation is provided by the Commons Act 2006. Under Schedule 2(4) to the Act, applications that failed to achieve final registration under the 1965 Act may, in certain circumstances, be reconsidered – offering, in effect, a second chance for the land to be confirmed (&#x27;re-registered&#x27;) as common. Land that is re-registered in this way will enjoy the special legal protection afforded to common land. It will also become subject in due course to the public right of access introduced by the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000; or depending on location, may qualify as a section 193 &#x27;urban&#x27; common (in which case, it would also be subject to a right of access for horse-riders).

==Management==
===Fencing===

The act of transferring resources from the commons to purely private ownership is known as &quot;enclosure&quot;, or (especially in formal use, and in place names) &quot;Inclosure&quot;. The inclosure acts were a series of private acts of Parliament, mainly from about 1750 to 1850, which enclosed large areas of common, especially the arable and haymeadow land and the better pasture land.

The maintenance of fences around a common is the responsibility of the occupiers of the adjacent enclosed land, not (as it would be with enclosed land) the responsibility of the owners of the grazed livestock. This can lead to difficulties where not all adjacent occupiers maintain their fences properly. However the fencing of land within a registered common is not allowed, as this is a form of enclosure and denies use of the land to others.

A celebrated landmark case of unauthorised fencing of a common was in 1866 by Lord Brownlow who illegally enclosed 434 acres of Berkhamsted Common to add to his Ashridge Estate. Brownlow had failed to buy out the commoners, so resorted to this action. A public outcry followed, and the Commons Preservation Society found a champion in Augustus Smith who had the inclination and the money to act, and himself held commons rights. Smith hired 120 navvies armed with hammers, chisels and crowbars, who on the night of 6 March 1866, under the aegis of the newly formed Commons Preservation Society (now the Open Spaces Society), felled to the ground two miles of iron railings. Soon after, local people flocked in. Lord Brownlow took action against Augustus Smith and the court case lasted until 1870 when it ended with the complete vindication of Smith.

===Controls on development===
Development of common land is strictly controlled. The government states that common land should be open and accessible to the public, and the law restricts the kind of works that can be carried out on commons. HM Planning Inspectorate is responsible for determining applications under the 2006 Act regarding common land in England, and several other pieces of legislation regarding commons and greens. All applications are determined on behalf of the Secretary of State for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra).

Under section 38 of the Commons Act 2006, you need consent to carry out any restricted works on land registered as common land under the Commons Registration Act 1965. Restricted works are any that
prevent or impede access to or over the land. They include fencing, buildings, structures, ditches, trenches, embankments and other works, where the effect of those works is to prevent or impede access. They also include, in every case, new solid surfaces, such as for a new car park or access road.

===Boards of conservators and commons councils===
Some commons are managed by boards of conservators for the wider public benefit. However, for areas where these are not established, or an improved system is required, the Commons Act 2006 provides for the establishment of commons councils to manage common land.

The Standard Constitution Regulations relating to commons councils were formally approved in April 2010, and commons councils are most likely to be useful where they can improve current management practices. This may be where commons are in agricultural use, but where it can be difficult to reach agreement on collective management. Commons councils are voluntary and can be established only where there is substantial support among those with interests in the land, such as; the commoners (especially those who actively exercise their rights); owners and other legal interests.

Commons councils enable decisions to be made by majority voting, so relieving the burden of trying to reach unanimous decisions. They will have the power to make rules about agricultural activities, the management of vegetation, and the exercise of common rights, which are binding on all those with interests on a common.

===Roadways===

Commons are often crossed by unfenced public roads, and this leads to another problem on modern pasture commons where grazing survives (or is to be reintroduced). Historically, the roads would have been cart-tracks, and there would have been no conflict between their horse-drawn (or ox-drawn) traffic and the pastured animals, and no great difficulty if pastured animals wandered off the common along the roads. However, these roads now have fast motorised traffic which does not mix safely with animals. To continue (or restore) grazing, such roads may need fencing or at least blocking at the edge of the common with cattle grids – however fencing a common is reminiscent of the process of enclosure, historically fatal to its survival, and permission for fencing on a common is a strictly controlled process within the UK planning system.

Public roads through enclosed common land were made to an accepted width between boundaries. In the late eighteenth century this was at least , but from the 1790s this was decreased to , and later as the normal maximum width. The reason for these wide roads to was to prevent excessive churning of the road bed, and allow easy movement of flocks and herds of animals.

==Finland and Sweden ==
A partition unit is a corporation that owns common land. In this case, the land is not state-owned or in joint-ownership under a trust, but is owned by a definite partition unit, a legal partnership whose partners are the participating individual landowners. Common lands and waterways owned by a partition unit were created by an agreement where certain land was reserved for the common use of all adjacent landowners. For the most part, this was due to the Great Partition (Swedish: storskiftet, Finnish: isojako), which started in 1757 and was largely complete by the 1800s. Earlier, the land of a village was divided into narrow stripes of farmland for each to own in an open-field system, with the remainder commonly owned. Work on the land was collective. In the Great Partition, villages were organized as corporations termed partition units (Swedish: skifteslag, Finnish: jakokunta), and land was divided into large chunks that were divided among the households (commoners) for individual cultivation and habitation. Land or waterways that remained undivided was kept by the partition unit as commons, owned by the partition unit. Later, Gustav III claimed the yet unclaimed forest for the Crown – this was the origin of the large forest holdings of the state in Sweden and Finland. Today, partition units are a common way of owning waterways.

==Ireland==

In Ireland, commonage () is a holding held by two or more persons in specified shares or jointly and originally purchased from the Irish Land Commission under the Land Purchase Acts (1885 and 1903). Traditionally, tenants on large estates rented their land from the landlord. The farm consisted of an enclosed parcel of land and permission to use nearby unenclosed land belonging to the landlord. In many areas access unenclosed land (the &quot;hill&quot;) was vital as it allowed the tenant to keep livestock and gain a cash income.

There are over 4,500 commonages in Ireland, with 11,000–14,000 farmers having grazing rights. of commonage is currently grazed, mostly in counties Mayo, Galway, Sligo, Donegal, Kerry and Wicklow. It is generally used for grazing sheep in upland areas. Overgrazing in the 1980s and 1990s led to damage to hill areas and river banks; numbers are now limited.

In Gaelic Ireland, prior to the Norman-English conquest of Ireland (begun in the 12th century AD, not complete until the late 16th century), land was owned by tribes. A portion of the tribe&#x27;s territory, known as the &quot;Fearan Fine&quot; (&quot;tribe&#x27;s quarter&quot;) was held in common by the entire tribe. This was generally low-quality land, used for grazing pigs and cattle, and was leased to tribe members for a year at a time.

==Scotland==
Commoning has probably existed in Scotland for over a millennium. However, there is no modern legislation relating to commons which formally identifies the extent of common land or clarifies the full range of rights. The right of turbary – the ability to cut peat as fuel – clearly exists in large parts of Scotland, whilst the scale of such rights, and the extent to which they are utilised, remain unknown. The main work undertaken on Scottish commons concerns grazing, using a pragmatic definition, where such commons were defined as pastures with multiple grazing rights and/or multiple graziers.

There are seven main historic types of common land in Scotland, some of which have similarities to common land in England and Wales.

===Commonties===
The overwhelming majority of areas of common land in lowland Scotland and the Highland fringes were &quot;commonties&quot;. A commonty is an area of land where the rights of property or use are shared by two or more neighbouring (though not necessarily adjacent) landowners. They are not therefore truly &#x27;common&#x27; land in the sense that anyone can use them, and this distinction meant that it was often very easy for commonties to be divided between landowners after a series of Acts permitting this were passed by the Parliament of Scotland in the 17th century, most notably the 1695 Act for the Division of Commonties. As a result, the number of commonties declined very rapidly in the 18th and 19th centuries.

===Common mosses===
Common mosses were areas of bog where the right to dig peat for fuel were shared by neighbouring landowners. They are therefore similar to commonties and most commonties included a common moss. However the difficulties of dividing such wet areas meant that they were left out of many commonty divisions and many common mosses may still survive, un-noticed because of the decline of peat-cutting.

===Run rig===
Run rig is a system of agriculture involving the cultivation of adjacent, narrow strips of raised land (rigs). Traditionally adjacent rigs would be used by different farmers and the rigs were periodically re-allocated between them. The system was common throughout Scotland until the 18th century, but survived longer in the Western Highlands, where runrig was often associated with an adjacent area of common hill grazing which was also shared by the same farmers as the runrig.

===Scattalds===
Scattalds are unique to Shetland and are based on udal law, rather than the feudal law that predominated in the rest of Scotland. However, Scattalds are very similar to commonties and many were divided under the same 1695 Act that allowed for the division of commonties.

===Crown Commons===
Crown Commons were areas of land held directly by the crown and therefore the common rights that could be used were rights of use rather than rights of property. Unlike commonties, the rights to use crown commons (for example for grazing livestock) were available to anyone, not just the neighbouring landowners. There are no crown commons left in Scotland; those that survived into the 20th century were taken over by the Crown Estate.

===Greens and loans===
Greens were small areas of common land near a settlement where livestock could be kept overnight, markets held and other communal activities carried out. Sometimes they were adjacent to drovers&#x27; roads near river crossing points or overnight accommodation. Most were genuinely common land with only the Crown holding any title to them. A loan was a common route through private property allowing access to an area of common land or other public place. As the traditional uses of greens and loans declined, they were often absorbed by the neighbouring landowners.

===Burgh commons===
Burgh commons were areas of common land where property rights or privileges of use were held by the burgh for their inhabitants. They could include any of the other six types of common land and were sometimes shared with landowners outside the burgh. By the early 19th century, most burgh commons had been appropriated by the wealthy landowners who dominated burgh councils, and very few have survived.

==United States==

Common land, an English development, was used in many former British colonies, for example in Ireland and the United States. The North American colonies adopted the English laws in establishing their own commons. Famous examples include the Boston Common in Massachusetts and the New Haven Green in New Haven, Connecticut, some of the oldest commons in the United States.

<doc id="910541" wikidata="Q1066492" url="?curid=910541" title="Stellenbosch University">
<text>Stellenbosch University (SU) (, ) is a public research university situated in Stellenbosch, a town in the Western Cape province of South Africa. Stellenbosch is the oldest university in South Africa and the oldest extant university in Sub-Saharan Africa, which received full university status in 1918. Stellenbosch University designed and manufactured Africa&#x27;s first microsatellite, SUNSAT, launched in 1999.

Stellenbosch is organised in 139 departments across 10 faculties offering bachelor&#x27;s (NQF 7) to doctoral degrees (NQF 10) in the English and Afrikaans language. Across five campuses in the Western Cape, the university is home to 32,000 students.

The students of Stellenbosch University are nicknamed &quot;Maties&quot;. The term probably arises from the Afrikaans word &quot;tamatie&quot; (meaning tomato, and referring to the maroon sports uniforms and blazer colour). An alternative theory is that the term comes from the Afrikaans colloquialism &quot;maat&quot; (meaning &quot;buddy&quot; or &quot;mate&quot;), originally used diminutively (&quot;maatjie&quot;) by the students of the University of Cape Town&#x27;s precursor, the South African College.

== History ==
The origin of the university can be traced back to the Stellenbosch Gymnasium, which was founded in 1864 and opened on 1 March 1866. The first five students matriculated in 1870, but capacity did not initially exist for any tertiary education. However, in the 1870s, the Cape Colony&#x27;s first locally elected government took office and prioritised education. In 1873, four of the five 1870 matriculates became the institution&#x27;s first graduates by attaining the &quot;Second Class Certificate&quot; through distance learning, and the gymnasium&#x27;s student numbers rose to over a hundred.

In 1874, a series of government acts provided for colleges and universities, with generous subsidies and staff. A personal intervention by the Prime Minister in the same year ensured that Stellenbosch qualified, after initially being allocated to be purely a secondary school. Later in 1874, the institution acquired its first Professor and, in the coming few years, its capacity and staff grew rapidly. Its first academic senate was constituted at the beginning of 1876, when several new premises were also acquired. The first MA degree (in Stellenbosch and in South Africa) was completed in 1878, and also in that year, the Gymnasium&#x27;s first four female students were enrolled.

The institution became the Stellenbosch College in 1881, and was located at the current Arts Department. In 1887, this college was renamed Victoria College; when it acquired university status on 2 April 1918 it was renamed once again, to Stellenbosch University. Initially only one university was planned for the Cape but after the government was visited by a delegation from the &quot;Victoria College&quot;, it was decided to allow the college to be a university if it could raise £100,000. Jannie Marais, a wealthy Stellenbosch farmer, bequeathed the money required before his death in 1915. There were certain conditions to his gift which included Dutch/Afrikaans having equal status to English and that the lecturers teach at least half their lectures in Dutch/Afrikaans. By 1930, very little, if any, instruction was delivered in English.

In December 2014, specialists at the university performed the first successful penis transplantation on a 21-year-old man.

Stellenbosch University was the first African university to sign the Berlin Declaration on Open Access to Knowledge in the Sciences and Humanities.

=== Name ===
Although the university was originally named the University of Stellenbosch (Afrikaans: Universiteit van Stellenbosch), it nowadays uses two forms: the English version &quot;Stellenbosch University&quot; (abbreviated SU) and the Afrikaans version &quot;Universiteit Stellenbosch&quot; (abbreviated US). In all its official documents, such as degree certificates, as well as the university coat of arms, both the English &quot;Stellenbosch University&quot; and the Afrikaans &quot;Universiteit Stellenbosch&quot; are used.

== Facilities ==

=== Location ===

Stellenbosch is located about 50 kilometres from Cape Town, and is situated on the banks of the &quot;Eersterivier&quot; (&quot;First River&quot;) in the famous wine-growing region and is encircled by picturesque mountains. Teaching at Stellenbosch University is divided across five campuses.

* Main campus in Stellenbosch
* Bellville Park Campus (Business School)
* Saldanha Campus (Military Science)
* Tygerberg Campus (Medicine and Health Sciences)
* Ukwanda Rural Clinical (Medicine and Health Sciences)

=== Faculties ===
Stellenbosch University consists of 139 departments across 10 faculties.
* AgriSciences
* Arts and Social Sciences
* Economic and Management Sciences
* Education
* Engineering
* Law
* Medicine and Health Sciences (Tygerberg)
* Military Science (Saldanha Bay)
* Science
* Theology

The Southern African node of the Pan-African University is based in South Africa and will concentrate on space sciences.

This decision was connected with South Africa&#x27;s bid to host the Square Kilometre Array of radio telescopes. In September 2009 Jean-Pierre Ezin, African Union commissioner for science, said the node at the University of Stellenbosch in South Africa was hoped to open in February 2010. According to &quot;University World News&quot;, however, &quot;The PAU project continues in other regions although Southern Africa has been lagging behind.&quot;

=== Sports facilities ===
Stellenbosch University has the facilities for the more than 30 competitive and recreational sports that are supported by the university include Danie Craven Stadium, Indoor and Outdoor Swimming Pools, the Coetzenburg Centre, a multi-purpose center for ceremonies and indoor sports, playing fields, including two artificial hockey fields, a gymnasium, and a new football complex.

=== Sporting codes ===
The university offers several sports to its students. Some of them are athletics, bouldering, badminton, basketball, canoeing, cricket, cross country running, cycling, fencing, golf, gymnastics, field hockey, judo, kendo, netball, rowing, rugby union, soccer, squash, surfing, swimming, taekwondo, tennis, underwater hockey, volleyball, water polo, and yachting.

=== Facilities and services ===

==== Libraries ====
The Stellenbosch University Library has collections scattered around the campus outside of the main facility, and all of which are catalogued on a computerized database, using the university&#x27;s original mainframe, a UNIVAC. There are several other satellite libraries servicing the different faculties, including the Theology Library, Law Library and Tygerberg Medical Library.

==== University facilities ====
Stellenbosch University also has a Conservatory, with two concert halls. The Conservatory is the home of the internationally acclaimed Stellenbosch University Choir, who, along with being the oldest South African choir have received numerous awards overseas. The university also has a 430-seat theatre, known as the HB Thom Theatre and an open-air amphitheatre. Accompanying these facilities is the university&#x27;s own Drama Department, under the guidance of the Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences. The department regularly puts on plays, dramas, productions, cabarets and musicals.

==== Botanical garden ====

The Stellenbosch University Botanical Garden is the oldest university botanical garden in South Africa.

==== Student center ====
The Langenhoven Students&#x27; Centre (&quot;Neelsie&quot;) houses the Student Representative Council, a food court, a cinema, a post office, a shopping centre, an advice office and all the student societies&#x27; offices. Student bands and various entertainment and activity promotions usually appear in the main food court during lunch hour.

==== Campus radio ====
The university has its own radio station known as MFM (Matie FM), situated in the Neelsie. It broadcasts a mix of music, news, entertainment and campus news over the entire Stellenbosch area at 92.6 FM.

==== Campus newspaper ====
The university also distributes regular publications, &quot;Die Matie&quot; (appearing every fortnight) for its students and &quot;Kampusnuus&quot; (appearing monthly) for its staff. An official yearbook, &quot;Stellenbosch Student&quot;, is published annually and presented to all graduating students. &quot;Matieland&quot; is the name of the official alumni magazine. It is published twice a year and distributed to some 100 000 alumni and friends of the university.

== Language ==
Stellenbosch University has historically been a predominantly Afrikaans-medium university. However, as the student body became more diverse, pressure mounted for more classes in English. Today, the university&#x27;s language policy promotes multilingualism as a means to increase equitable access for all students and staff. Afrikaans, English and Xhosa are used in academic, administrative, professional and social contexts, and classes are offered in Afrikaans and English.

At postgraduate level the language of tuition is determined by the composition of the class. Most advanced postgraduate courses are conducted in English. According to the 2016 language profile of the university, 40.7% of its students stated Afrikaans as their home language, 46.1% stated English, 0.9% stated English and Afrikaans, and 3.1% of students stated isiXhosa as their home language.

The language policy is still an ongoing issue for the university, since it is one of the very few tertiary institutions in South Africa offering instruction in Afrikaans. It is situated in the Western Cape province, where 67% of the population have Afrikaans as home language, and the only one of four universities in the province to offer degree courses in Afrikaans. The university annually hosts the SU &quot;Woordfees&quot;, a predominantly Afrikaans-language festival of the written and spoken word.

== Student profile ==
== Student housing ==
Stellenbosch has 34 residence halls in configurations for women only, men only and mixed gender. Each residence is supervised by a resident head assisted by a House Committee of senior students. The House Committee assists students with security, maintenance, and social programs. Each first year student on campus gets access to a be-well mentor who assist them with their social-emotional transition from school to university. Each residence for undergrads incorporates a laundry room, a common living room and a dining hall where meals are provided for which students book beforehand on their student account.

The number of available rooms in university residences is limited, which requires some students to find private boarding. Students in private lodgings are assigned to one of 6 Commuter Student Organisations (CSO), also known as Private Wards. These CSOs give private students exposure to the same campus experience as students residing in residences. The oldest residence is Wilgenhof men&#x27;s residence, established in 1903.

The CSO wards along with the Residence Halls are grouped into six clusters with nearby residences to form student communities (a seventh cluster is on the Tygerberg campus). For each of these clusters, a hub facility is being built, of which three have already been completed, namely amaMaties, Wimbledon and Victoria. In this way, commuter students can enjoy the same benefits as residence students, such as mentor support, meals and a well-appointed place to go to between classes.

== Rankings ==

The university is one of three public universities in the Western Cape and one of about 20 universities in the country.

<text>A curandero (, &quot;healer&quot;; f. , also spelled , , f. ) is a traditional native healer or shaman found primarily in Latin America and also in the United States. A curandero is a specialist in traditional medicine whose practice can either contrast with or supplement that of a practitioner of Western medicine. A curandero is claimed to administer shamanistic and spiritistic remedies for mental, emotional, physical and spiritual illnesses. Some curanderos, such as Don Pedrito, the Healer of Los Olmos, make use of simple herbs, waters, or mud to allegedly effect their cures. Others add Catholic elements, such as holy water and pictures of saints; San Martin de Porres for example is heavily employed within Peruvian &quot;curanderismo&quot;. The use of Catholic prayers and other borrowings and lendings is often found alongside native religious elements. Many curanderos emphasize their native spirituality in healing while being practicing Catholics. Still others, such as Maria Sabina, employ hallucinogenic media and many others use a combination of methods. Most of the concepts related to &quot;curanderismo&quot; (the practice of curanderos) are Spanish words, often with medieval, vernacular definitions.

==History in Latin America==
The term &quot;curanderos&quot; can be traced back to the Spanish colonization of Latin America. Curanderos in this part of the world are the result of the mixture of traditional Indigenous medicinal practices and Catholic rituals. There was also an influence from African rituals brought to Latin America by slaves. Curandero/a comes from the root &quot;curar&quot; in Spanish which literally translates to cure. Thus, a curandero/a is one who heals. Curanderos go beyond Western medicine, linking illness with evil spirits. This extends a curandero&#x27;s duties to cover not only physical ailments but also psychological and interpersonal issues. Among the illnesses that Curandero/a&#x27;s help with range from the mundane stomach ache to certain spiritual illnesses such as &quot;susto, mal de ojo,&quot; and even reversing black magic. Traditional communities see all of these issues as a loss of spirit. They believe that the curanderos can enter different dimensions where they are able to find the solutions to a person&#x27;s illness or problem. Furthermore, they believe that God or the Higher Creator gives curanderos difficult and painful experiences so that they are better able to assist their patients. In Colonial Latin America, female folk healers, or curanderas, were often conflated with &quot;brujas&quot; (witches), which refers to those who cast spells; although curanderas were persecuted during such times, it is likely because they were females in positions of authority, not because of their healing methods. Today many women and men continue the curandero tradition in Mexico and the southwestern United States.

==History in the United States==
Historically, in the United States, curanderos were only found in concentrated Amerindian populations. It was largely thought that curanderos mainly practiced in New Mexico &amp; along the Mexico–United States border. However, recent historical research shows that the practice of &quot;curanderismo&quot; (traditional healing) was not restricted to the American Southwest. The practice of &quot;curanderismo&quot; was prevalent in the 1880s in Northeastern Tennessee.

In the mid- to late 1970s the rise in ethnic minority and immigrant populations grew in tandem with the public presence of curanderos in areas outside of the historical geographic regions of the United States which had large Indigenous populations. Since the 1990s, it has become more commonplace to see curanderos in northern-tier cities in the United States.

==Types of curanderos==
There are many different types of curanderos. &quot;Yerberos&quot; are primarily herbalists. &quot;Hueseros&quot; are bone and muscle therapists who emphasize physical ailments. &quot;Parteras&quot; are midwives. &quot;Oracionistas&quot; work primarily through the power of prayer. Other types include &quot;sobadors,&quot; who are masseurs, and &quot;brujos&quot; or &quot;brujas&quot;, who are witch doctors.

Among these broader terms, there are several subspecialties. For instance, &quot;yerberos&quot; who work primarily with tobacco to heal patients are known as &quot;tabaqueros&quot;. Healers who work primarily with ayahuasca are known as &quot;ayahuasqueros&quot;. Healers who work with peyote are known as &quot;peyoteros&quot;.

Although many curanderos do have a specialty and may identify with it, that does not mean that these healing modalities are necessarily strict and do not overlap. As an example, an oracionista may also be a yerbera, and so on.

==Practices of curanderos==
Hispanics might seek out curanderos if the properties of their bodies are &quot;hot&quot; and &quot;cold&quot;. Most of these practicing curanderos do not have formal medical training and inherit their gift or learn through being an apprentice. Often these faith healers have no office and work out of their homes. A significant factor why Hispanics seek out help from a curandero is because it is more affordable. Western medicine can often be more expensive, and some Hispanic families do not have the resources needed to be able to pay for them. Depending on the curandero, they might not charge for their services or just ask for a small offering or fee. You can find them in Hispanic communities to allow the members more accessibility to their services. Other reasons these communities might seek out services offered by curanderos are the language barrier and their immigration status. Curanderos are found in Spanish communities and can communicate better about their diagnoses and treatment. Unlike hospitals or healthcare workers that might have difficulty with a language barrier and complex medical terminology.

Communicating correctly to your patients is essential, but it is even more challenging if you do not speak the language or do not have an interpreter. As for their immigration status, it can be challenging to get health care from government support, especially for undocumented. Many of these Latinos will pay in cash for health care services they do receive out of fear of getting their immigration status reported.

Curanderos and at-home remedies come as an advantage to these individuals if they cannot pay cash but will do so if things get severe and do not better with other remedies first. Considering that these practices align more with Hispanic cultural views and beliefs, many of these individuals used curanderos and traditional medicine or alternative medicine in their home country. It can also be seen as a way of preserving these cultural views. Spiritual healing is another reason why curanderos might be sought out, and Hispanics feel that medical providers cannot help heal spiritual issues that the body might deal with.

Clients find that curanderos are healers of both the body and spirit. If needed, a curandero can cast out the evil spirits that might reside in someone&#x27;s body and do a full spiritual cleanse. These are practices one will not find western medical providers performing or trying to achieve. It is found that most Hispanics who seek curanderos for their services are born in their home country as opposed to Hispanics born in the United States. Hispanics who are less integrated into life in the United States seek these healers to connect and feel familiar with their home countries&#x27; traditionalism. These Hispanic community members can be dissatisfied with diagnoses or Western medicine practices. They feel that their provider does not believe in their folk illnesses, much less know how to approach and treat them.

==Traditional illnesses and curses==
Among some of the illnesses that curanderos treat are: &quot;espanto&quot; (&quot;scare&quot;) or &quot;susto&quot; (&quot;fright&quot;); detaching or warding off vampiric &quot;espiritus&quot; (spirits); defending against or negating &quot;brujeria&quot; (&quot;witchcraft&quot; or &quot;sorcery&quot;), such as &quot;mal de ojo&quot; (&quot;evil eye&quot;) or other ill intent; clearing illnesses associated with &quot;mal aire&quot; or &quot;mal viento&quot; (&quot;evil air&quot; or &quot;evil wind&quot;); treating &quot;mal projimo&quot; (&quot;bad neighbor&quot;), an illness caused by having negative thoughts or feelings towards another individual, or conversely, a group of people feeling negatively towards the patient being treated, both of which can lead to harm to the individual.

===Consequences of encounters with &quot;duendes&quot;===
A curandero can treat the negative consequences of encounters a person has had had with a &quot;duende&quot; (a &quot;spirit creature&quot; such as a pixie, imp, fairy, leprechaun, brownie, dwarf, gnome, or troll). A &quot;duende&quot; can be a beneficial, neutral, or malicious spirit. &quot;Duendes&quot; are believed to live in the countryside of Latin American countries.

===Effects of &quot;mal aire&quot; or &quot;mal viento&quot;===
&quot;Mal aire&quot; or &quot;mal viento&quot; is something invisible movements of the air are believed to cause. These can be defined as the result of &quot;bad&quot; or &quot;evil&quot; air or an illness caused by hot or cold air. For example, if a person is outside on a hot day but enters a much cooler building, they can catch an &quot;aire&quot;. This can also be caused by supernatural forces carried through the wind. Something can be caught by walking around or encountering places with bad energy. Examples of such places can be graveyards, abandoned houses, and other places where these &quot;bad&quot; forces reside. The harmful energy attaches itself to a person when such forces are encountered and can quickly takes over their entire body. It is believed that this harmful energy can also result in the decaying of a person&#x27;s internal organs and can be fatal if left untreated. Many other common symptoms of &quot;mal aire&quot; include headaches, nausea, fatigue, diarrhea, and paleness.

===Soul loss===
A person can &quot;lose their soul&quot; (also known as soul loss) when being frightened or experiencing a frightening experience. This is called &quot;espanto&quot; or &quot;susto&quot;. Usually, susto has much milder symptoms, and children and babies are more prone to getting in regarding this illness. Examples of such experiences that can cause this is having scary dreams, receiving devastating news, facing a wild animal, etc. Symptoms associated with this disease can be nausea, crying, bad dreams, and insomnia.

For all of the illnesses mentioned above, a curandero can perform a &quot;mal limpieza&quot; (&quot;purge of evil&quot; or &quot;cleansing of evil&quot;) in order to get rid of the &quot;bad&quot; and restore the client to health. Examples of materials used in these limpizas are sugar, liquor, holy water, perfume, eggs, chickens, and Guinea pigs. Others include a dog&#x27;s skull, a dove&#x27;s blood, and a head from a doll, or some other power object. Limpieza can also be performed with plants. These magical plants can be helpful in cleaning houses as well. If a house has been abandoned or something terrible has happened in it, such as a sudden death or act of violence, a curandero will do a ritual that cleanses the home from all the &quot;mal&quot; (&quot;evil&quot;). Once a limpieza has occurred, the materials used in it are disposed of. Given that the &quot;mal&quot; has been transferred to them, they must be disposed of far from human inhabitants in order to prevent others being harmed.

==Further information==
In the 21st century as the popularity of alternative medicines grow, some curanderos are concerned about the appropriation of these practices.

The Moche people of ancient Peru often depicted curanderos in their art.

In the Andes, one of the instruments of the &quot;curandero&quot; is the &quot;chonta&quot;, a lance carved from the chonta palm, &quot;Bactris gasipaes&quot;, thought to be imbued with magical powers. The palm grows only in the Amazon basin and is the object of a brisk commerce. The Jivaro people of the Amazon Rainforest use the hardwood of the chonta to carve their spears. The shaman is also known as &quot;chonteador&quot;, and his most important wand is the &quot;chonta defensa&quot;; if he dies without disciples, the &quot;chonta&quot; is thrown, wrapped in rubands and weighted with stones, to the bottom of a lake with the belief that its power will reemerge when a new shaman will take office. The shamans also use wands of &quot;huatulco&quot; wood, &quot;Loxopterygium huasango&quot;.

<doc id="910545" wikidata="Q860340" url="?curid=910545" title="Kunai">
<text>A is a Japanese tool thought to be originally derived from the masonry trowel. The two widely recognized kinds are the short &quot;kunai&quot; (小苦無 shō-&quot;kunai&quot;) and the big &quot;kunai&quot; (大苦無 &quot;dai-kunai&quot;). Although a basic tool, the &quot;kunai&quot;, in the hands of a martial arts expert, could be used as a multi-functional weapon. The &quot;kunai&quot; is commonly associated with the ninja, who in folklore used them to climb walls.

== Design ==

A &quot;Kunai&quot; normally had a leaf-shaped wrought blade in lengths ranging from and a handle with a ring on the pommel for attaching a rope. The attached rope allowed the &quot;kunai&quot;&#x27;s handle to be wrapped to function as a grip, or to be strapped to a stick as a makeshift spear; to be tied to the body for concealment; to be used as an anchor or piton, and sometimes to be used as the Chinese rope dart. Contrary to popular belief, &quot;kunai&quot; were not designed to be used primarily as throwing weapons. Instead, &quot;kunai&quot; were primarily tools and, when used as weapons, were stabbing and thrusting implements.

Varieties of &quot;kunai&quot; include short, long, narrow-bladed, saw-toothed, and wide-bladed. In some cases, the &quot;kunai&quot; and the &quot;Nishikori&quot;, a wide-bladed saw with a dagger-type handle, are difficult to distinguish.

==Uses==

The &quot;kunai&quot; was originally used by peasants as a multi-purpose gardening tool and by workers of stone and masonry. The blade is made of soft iron and is left unsharpened because the edges are used to smash relatively soft materials such as plaster and wood, for digging holes, and for prying. Normally, only the tip is sharpened.

=== Weapon ===
Many ninja weapons were adapted from farming tools, not unlike those used by Shaolin monks in China. Since &quot;kunai&quot; were cheaply produced farming tools of proper size and weight and could be easily sharpened, they were readily available to be converted into simple weapons. As a weapon, the &quot;kunai&quot; is larger and heavier than a shuriken and with the grip could also be used in hand-to-hand combat more readily than a shuriken. 

As with ninjutsu, the exaggeration persistent in ninja myths played a large role in creating the popular culture image of &quot;kunai&quot;. In fictional depictions of ninjas, the &quot;kunai&quot; is commonly portrayed as a steel knife that is used for stabbing or particularly throwing, sometimes confused with the shuriken.

===Masonry===
The &quot;kunai&quot; was used in masonry to shape stonework.

<doc id="910547" wikidata="Q434550" url="?curid=910547" title="Jerome of Prague">
<text>Jerome of Prague (; ; 1379 – 30 May 1416) was a Czech scholastic philosopher and theologian. Jerome was one of the chief followers of Jan Hus and was burned for heresy at the Council of Constance.

==Early life==
Jerome was born in Prague, Kingdom of Bohemia (now the Czech Republic), in 1379 and graduated from the Charles University of Prague in 1398. He later studied at Oxford University where he first became familiar with the reformist teachings of John Wycliffe. He was a philosopher, theologian, university professor, and church reformer who dedicated his life to eradicate those church doctrines and dogmas he found to be corrupt. He was constantly in and out of jail. His radical ideas eventually brought about his death by execution as a heretic to the church, but made him a martyr for the Protestant Reformation and followers of Jan Hus (known as Hussites).

He was well-educated and spent most of his life traveling, trying to incite religious reform in various cities. It was for his criticisms rather than heresy that he was martyred.

==Early life and education==
Jerome spent time teaching at the universities of Paris, Cologne, and Heidelberg, but was accused of heresy at all these universities and forced to return to Bohemia. He spent much of his life traveling about various universities, but frequently returned to Bohemia where he was virtually safe from any prosecution. He earned popular renown, as his rhetoric and oratory skills were acclaimed and often roused the public into demonstrations against the church, although they sometimes ended badly. He secured, in 1399, permission to travel. In 1401 he returned to Prague, but in 1402 visited England, where, at Oxford University, he copied out the &quot;Dialogus&quot; and &quot;Trialogus&quot; of John Wycliffe, and thus evinced his interest in Lollardry. He became an ardent and outspoken advocate of realism and, thereafter, of Wyclifism; charges of which were constantly getting him into trouble. In 1403 he went to Jerusalem, in 1405 to Paris. There he took his master&#x27;s degree, but Jean Gerson drove him out. In 1406 he took the same degree at the University of Cologne, and a little later at the University of Heidelberg.

He was no safer in Prague, where he returned and where, in 1407, he took the same degree. In that year he returned to Oxford, but was again compelled to flee. During 1408 and 1409 he was in Prague, and there his pronounced Czech preferences aroused opposition to him in some quarters. Early in January 1410, he made a cautious speech in favour of Wycliffe&#x27;s philosophical views, and this was cited against him at the Council of Constance four years later. In March 1410, a papal bull against Wycliffe&#x27;s writings was issued, and on the charge of favouring them, Jerome was imprisoned in Vienna, but managed to escape to Moravia. For this he was excommunicated by the bishop of Kraków. Returned to Prague, he appeared publicly as the advocate of Hus. Popular legend attributes to Jerome leadership of a protest in which papal bulls were first strung around the neck of a prostitute in a cart and then carried to the pillory in Prague to be publicly burned, but the leader was actually Wok of Waldstein.

==Middle life and teachings==

Jerome tended to teach radical ideas pertaining to Roman Catholic doctrine, namely that God&#x27;s teachings were directly accessible to a Christian without need for the church or church officials. He taught that one should obey the direct teachings of Jesus, even when they conflicted with those of the Catholic Church. He was largely a follower of the ideologies of both church reformers John Wyclif and Jan Hus. As his teachings were contrary to those of the Roman Catholic Church, he was constantly on the run from authorities. Hus, although much less disruptive in his approach, was a mentor for Jerome.

Jerome incited public demonstrations in Paris, Vienna, Prague, and everywhere in between; most of these demonstrations took place in cities with universities where Jerome taught. Teaching at universities allowed Jerome to reach a broad audience. In Kraków, he was publicly examined as to his acceptance of the forty-five articles which the enemies of Wyclif had made up from Wyclif&#x27;s writings and which they asserted represented Wyclif&#x27;s heretical teachings. Jerome declared that he rejected them in their general tenor.

==Trial and death==
When, on 11 October 1414, Hus left for the Council of Constance, Jerome assured him that if needed, he would come to his assistance, contrary to the wishes of Hus. Upon Hus&#x27; arrival in Constance he was arrested and imprisoned. Jerome kept his promise, even though Hus and other friends of Jerome warned him not to come. On 4 April 1415, he arrived at Constance. Predictably, he created a stir in the town.

Jerome&#x27;s friends persuaded him to return to Bohemia. But on his way back he was arrested in Hirschau on 20 April and taken to Sulzbach, where he was imprisoned, and was returned to Constance on 23 May. He was immediately arraigned before the council on the charge of fleeing a citation.

The humanist Poggio Bracciolini, present in those days in Constance, left a direct testimony of Girolamo&#x27;s trial and execution, through a letter in Latin addressed to Leonardo Bruni on the same day as he was sentenced to the stake.

:Conducted in public and commanded to respond to each accusation, for a long time he refused to answer, stating that he would first clarify his position rather than respond to the specific accusations made by his opponents [...] But deny him this possibility, so he said below: &quot;What iniquity is this, which for a good 340 days I have been in a very hard prison, in a thousand ugliness, in the filth, in the stocks, in the lack of everything, while you have always listened to my accusers and detractors, and &quot;Now do you not want to listen to me for an hour? Having given them an audience for so long, they have persuaded you that I am a heretic, an enemy of faith and a persecutor of the church. You have judged in your minds that I am a wicked man, before having could have known which man I really am. But I remind you that you are men, not gods, you are mortal, not immortal, you can spend, err, be deceived and seduced [...]&quot;

:But having been repeatedly interrupted by the clamor and noise of many, in the end it was decided in the Council that Girolamo mainly replied on the errors of which he was accused, and that he was then granted the faculty of being able to speak as much as he wanted [...]

The accusations of being a detractor of the papacy and of the Roman pope, enemy of the cardinals, persecutor of the prelates and of the clergy and enemy of the Christian religion, rejected the doctrinal orthodoxy on the doctrine of the Eucharist, and he was insulted with titles of hypocrite and donkey.

The hearing was postponed three days later, he was allowed to speak: he remembered the fate of Socrates, Plato&#x27;s imprisonment, the tortures suffered by Anaxagoras and Zeno, the death of Boethius and the condemnations of John the Baptist, of Christ and of saint Stephen. &quot;But being the whole weight of the cause placed on the witnesses of the prosecution, with many reasons he showed that they should not be trusted, showing that they had said all those things not for the sake of truth but out of hatred, malevolence and envy [...] They were the minds of the surrounding contracted and bent almost to mercy [...]&quot;.

Everyone was waiting for him to admit and retract his errors and ask for forgiveness but &quot;in the end he began to praise a certain John Hus, who had been condemned to the stake and said he had been a good man, just, holy and not worthy of that death. Prepared with a strong and constant mind to support any suspicion rather than giving in to his enemies, to those false witnesses, who will not be able to lie before God, when they will have to give an account of things said. The pain of the surrounding was great and everyone wished he was spared death, if he really had been sincere. Girolamo, persevering in his convictions, praised that Giovanni and confirmed that he had never heard him say anything against the state of the church of God, but against the perverse customs of the clerics, against the arrogance and pomp of the prelates, also devastators of church property. Since the assets of the churches had to be distributed first to the poor, then to the pilgrims and to the church factory, it was not worthy to spend them with prostitutes, at banquets, in horses, in dogs, in pumping clothes and in so many other unworthy things of the religion of Christ&quot;.

He was still given two days to confess his alleged faults; after which, on May 30, 1416, it was judged a heretic by the council and condemned to the stake.

:To whom he came with a playful forehead and with a happy face, not frightened by fire, not by torments, not by death, and there was never any stoic who, like him, sustained death with such a strong and constant heart. When he arrived at the place of torture, he stripped himself of his clothes and, kneeling down, greeted the pole to which he was then tied with many ropes and was tightened, naked, with a chain. After much wood had been placed around his chest and kidneys, mixed with straw, and fire was set, Girolamo began to sing a certain hymn, which was interrupted by smoke and flames.

His condemnation was predetermined in consequence of his open acceptance of the heretical views and ideas of Wyclif, especially on the Eucharist, and his open admiration for Hus and his doctrines. Refusing to recant those beliefs, the council used the conditions of imprisonment to coerce Jerome to recant his heresies. In public sessions of the council on 11 and 23 September 1415 Jerome abjured his heresies and renounced Wyclif and Hus. In letters to the king of Bohemia and the University of Prague, he declared that he had become convinced that Hus had been rightfully burned for heresy. (Hus had been burned at the stake while Jerome was imprisoned.) However, he remained imprisoned as the council rightly doubted the sincerity of his recantation. On 23 May 1416, and on 26 May, he was again brought before the council in order for them to ascertain the truth of his abjuration. On the second day he withdrew his recantation, and as a result, having &quot;again fallen&quot; back into heresy, he was condemned by the council and handed over to the secular authorities to be burned. Subsequently, Jerome was claimed as a martyr of the Hussites and adopted by later Protestants such as John Foxe to demonstrate a historical “past&quot; for the new denominations of the sixteenth century Protestant Reformation.

<text>The men&#x27;s [[beach volleyball]] event at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece, was held at the Olympic Beach Volleyball Centre located at the Faliro Coastal Zone Olympic Complex.

==Medalists==
==Pool play==
The 24 competing teams were split equally into six pools of four, and each team played each of the other teams in their pool a best of three set match (so that the number of pool matches, P, played by each team was 3).

The teams in each pool were ranked first through fourth based on the number of matches won, W. In the event of a two-way tie, the winning team in the head-to-head match finished ahead. In a three-team tie, the total number of points each team won and lost during all matches involving only the three tied teams were added up, and the bottom-ranked team of the three was decided by the &quot;points for&quot; to &quot;points against&quot; ratio; the other two teams were then ranked according to the outcome of the head-to-head match. The top two teams from each pool and the four best third placed teams (based on: first, matches won; second (in the event of a tie), set ratio SF/SA; and third (if there is still a tie), points ratio PF/PA) progressed through to the round of sixteen (single elimination tournament).

Two points (Pts) were awarded for each match win (W) and one point was given for each loss (L).&lt;br&gt;
In individual matches, all winners are shown in bold.&lt;br&gt;

<text>Holbeach Air Weapons Range is a United Kingdom Ministry of Defence academic air weapons range (AWR) situated between Boston and King&#x27;s Lynn in the civil parish of Gedney on The Wash, in Lincolnshire, eastern England.

It was originally associated with RAF Sutton Bridge, but in the 1950s was named Royal Air Force Holbeach before adopting its current name in the mid 2000s when control was passed to the Defence Training Estate.

The remote air range opened in 1926 as an air gunnery range attached to and established by Royal Air Force Practice Camp Sutton Bridge (later named RAF Sutton Bridge). Use of the range began on 27 September 1926, with biplanes firing and dropping bombs over the area formally known as &quot;Holbeach Air Gunnery and Bombing Range&quot;, and colloquially simply as Holbeach Marsh Range.

During the late 1950s, when RAF Sutton Bridge was reduced to a care and maintenance role, the coastal marshland air gunnery range was renamed to RAF Holbeach Bombing Range and it became later parented to RAF Marham as an Air Weapons Range (AWR) within RAF Strike Command. On 1 April 2006 the defence estates&#x27; administration was transferred to the Ministry of Defence—Defence Training Estate East (DTE East), located at West Tofts Camp in West Tofts near Thetford in Norfolk; now renamed Defence Infrastructure Organisation East (DIO East).

DIO are responsible for operational support—planning, building, maintaining and servicing the &#x27;Holbeach Air Weapons Range&#x27; infrastructure. The air range estate is administered at a local level by a DIO Training Safety Officer (TSO), who is responsible for the day-to-day delivery of a safe training environment. RAF Air Command, who is the top level budget holder, control the core RAF station site which encompasses an area of 716 hectares. RAF air traffic control personnel staff the air range control tower supported by civilian range staff outsourced to Landmarc Solutions.

==Facilities==
The range extends over an area of , which includes 3,100 hectares of intertidal mudflats and 775 hectares of salt marsh, the air weapons range provides facilities for RAF and NATO-allied aircraft to practise dropping bombs and firing their aircraft weapons, including pre-deployment training. Since 1993 this has included night bombing and helicopter operations. The range training facilities are used by air force squadrons stationed in the United Kingdom and occasionally by units flying directly from airbases in Europe. An array of eight static range targets, include several retired merchant ships which have been beached on the sands of The Wash for this purpose. Observation towers (&quot;Quadrants&quot;) parallel to the target line are manned and allow the fall of aircraft ordnance to be calculated for accuracy by means of triangulation. The range includes a helicopter landing pad near the main control tower and since 2010 a new range headquarters building.

Most of the air range, including the control tower and four observation towers (Quadrants) are in the parish hamlets of Dawsmere and Gedney Drove End, but it does overlap with Holbeach to the west. On UK Civil Aviation Authority issued aeronautical charts the military Danger Area is found marked and identified by the code WRDA D207/II or the ICAO code EG D207 (Weapons Range Danger Area or United Kingdom Danger - 207), the danger altitude is usually up to twenty-three thousand feet AMSL.

== Past activity ==
In the past Holbeach Air Gunnery Bombing Range has served the intense activity of many types of British and foreign military aircraft using its target training range facilities. For example, from now historical propeller biplane types such as the Armstrong Whitworth Siskin, Hawker Woodcock, Gloster Grebe, Gloster Gamecock, Fairey III, Fairey Flycatcher, Bristol Bulldog, Hawker Fury and Gloster Gauntlet. Then the Bristol Blenheim, Fairey Battle, Hawker Hurricane, Supermarine Spitfire, de Havilland Mosquito, Westland Lysander, North American P-51 Mustang and Grumman Avenger, to now decommissioned succeeding jet aircraft types such as the Gloster Meteor, English Electric Canberra, de Havilland Venom, Hawker Hunter, USAF F-100D Super Sabre, Blackburn Buccaneer, McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II, USAF General Dynamics F-111 Aardvark, Harrier jump jet, SEPECAT Jaguar and Panavia Tornado, to name a few. Including, the still in service USAF F-16 Fighting Falcon, USAF B-1 Lancer, USAF B-2 Spirit, IAF Sukhoi Su-35, USAF HH-60G Pave Hawk (from 56th Rescue Squadron) and USAF A-10 Thunderbolt.

== Present activity ==
At the present time current aircraft types such as the Eurofighter Typhoon, Lockheed Martin F-35B Lightning II (No. 617 Squadron RAF), USAF McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle/F-15E Strike Eagle (from 48th Fighter Wing), BAE Hawk trainer and AgustaWestland Apache AH1 helicopters can be seen operating on the range at various times of the day, including on occasions USAF Bell Boeing CV-22B Osprey (from 7th Special Operations Squadron), USAF Lockheed Martin F-35A Lightning II (495th Fighter Squadron), Boeing Chinook, AgustaWestland AW159 Wildcat, AugustaWestland Merlin and Aerospatiale Puma HC helicopters. The range also hosts frequent forward air control (FAC) or joint terminal attack controller (JTAC) exercises.

===Strafing target courts===

RAF Holbeach also has facilities (strafing courts) for scoring aircraft strafing runs (aircraft firing runs on ground targets) using acoustic sensor scoring systems. The ground strafing targets consist of several four-metre square nets, each with an orange centred square bullseye. The Acoustic Air Weapons Scoring System (AWSS) which is located beneath a protection berm focus on the target screen and run at high speed, catching the supersonic profile of the incoming projectile, and triangulating its position concurrent with counting the event. The AWSS sensor modes can display rounds per minute results and the location of the strafe projectiles in the target area. The angle of attack and the horizontal approach angle are also calculated. This result is transmitted to the control tower, where it is displayed to the Air Traffic Controller for relaying to the pilot. The range also has semi-automatic bomb and rocket scoring systems.

==Heraldic badge==
The station&#x27;s RAF heraldic badge features a vertical sword through a crown. The circular frame coloured with RAF blue reads &#x27;Royal Air Force Station Holbeach&#x27; and the motto is &quot;Defend and Strike&quot;.

<text>&quot;Morning Mood&quot; () is part of Edvard Grieg&#x27;s &quot;Peer Gynt&quot;, Op. 23, written in 1875 as incidental music to Henrik Ibsen&#x27;s play of the same name, and was also included as the first of four movements in &quot;Peer Gynt Suite No. 1&quot;, Op. 46.

==Music==
Written in E major, the melody uses the pentatonic scale and alternates between flute and oboe. Unusually, the climax occurs early in the piece at the first &quot;forte&quot; which signifies the sun breaking through. The time signature is and the tempo instruction is &quot;Allegretto pastorale&quot;. It is orchestrated for flutes, oboes, clarinets, bassoons, horns, trumpets, timpani, and string section. A performance takes about four minutes.

==Setting==
The piece depicts the rising of the sun during Act 4, scene 4, of Ibsen&#x27;s play, which finds Peer Gynt stranded in the Moroccan desert after his companions took his yacht and abandoned him there while he slept. The scene begins with the following description: &quot;Dawn. Acacias and palm trees. Peer [Gynt] is sitting in his tree using a wrenched-off branch to defend himself against a group of monkeys.&quot;

As the &quot;Peer Gynt&quot; suites take their pieces out of the original context of the play, &quot;Morning Mood&quot; is not widely known in its original setting, and images of Grieg&#x27;s Scandinavian origins more frequently spring to the minds of its listeners than those of the desert it was written to depict.

Construction of Honington airfield, which was undertaken by John Laing &amp; Son, began in 1935, and the station was opened on 3 May 1937. Squadrons of RAF Bomber Command using the airfield prior to the Second World War were:
* No. 77 Squadron RAF (Hawker Harts and Vickers Wellesleys) (July 1937 – July 1938)
* No. 102 Squadron RAF (Handley Page Heyford) (July 1937 – July 1938) – Moved to RAF Driffield
* No. 75 Squadron RAF (Handley Page Harrow and Vickers Wellington) (July 1938 – July 1939) – Moved to RAF Stradishall.
* No. 215 Squadron RAF (Harrow and Wellington) (July 1938 – July 1938) – Moved to RAF Bassingbourn.
* IX Squadron (Wellington Mk Is, later changing to Mk lAs.) (4 September 1939 – 1940).

IX Squadron flew the first RAF bombing raid of the Second World War on 4 September 1939 flying a sortie against the Kriegsmarine in the Baltic resulting in the loss of two Wellingtons.

In July 1940, No. 311 (Czech) Squadron RAF formed at Honington with Wellingtons, later moving to RAF East Wretham in November 1940.

Then, in May 1941, a Wellington returning from a night trip attempted to land at Honington with its wheels retracted. It skidded to one side and crashed into the main bomb dump where it burst into flames. Group Captain J. A. Gray and Squadron Leader J. A. McCarthy, the station medical officer, were the first on the scene of the crash. Both entered the burning aircraft in an attempt to rescue the crew who were trapped and, between them, they saved two crew-members. For their gallantry, both officers were awarded the George Medal.

===United States Army Air Forces use===

In June 1942, the airfield was transferred to the USAAF and was upgraded to a Class A Bomber base. Honington was assigned USAAF designation Station 375.
* 314th Service Group

USAAF Station Units assigned to RAF Honington were:
: 467th Service Squadron; HHS 314th Service Group
* 18th Weather Squadron
* 68th Station Complement Squadron
* 9th Depot Repair Squadron
* Headquarters (Western Base Section)
Regular Army Station Units included:
* Headquarters &amp; Headquarters Battery (386th Anti-Aircraft Artillery Battalion)
* 386th Anti-Aircraft Artillery AW Battalion
* 386th Anti-Aircraft Artillery Battalion
* 1097th Signal Company
* 1178th Quartermaster Company
* 1221st Military Police Company
* 1599th Ordnance Supply &amp; Maintenance Company
* 2017th Engineer Fire Fighting Platoon

====1st Strategic Air Depot====
Under USAAF control, an additional facility, called Troston, was constructed to the west of the main airfield as a specialized air depot for the repair of badly-damaged B-17 Flying Fortress bombers and supporting the 3d Bomb Division located in the area. Badly damaged Fortresses were often instructed to crash land at Honington on return from operations, particularly if their landing gear could not be lowered, as this avoided the necessity to dismantle and transport the aircraft from its home base for repair.

====364th Fighter Group====

In addition to the air depot, Honington also housed an operational fighter unit when the 364th Fighter Group took up residence at Honington in February 1944, arriving from Santa Maria AAF, California. The group was under the command of the 67th Fighter Wing of the VIII Fighter Command.

The group consisted of the following squadrons:
* 383d Fighter Squadron (N2)
* 384th Fighter Squadron (5Y)
* 385th Fighter Squadron (5E)

The 364th FG flew escort, dive-bombing, strafing, and patrol missions in France, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Germany.

Converted from Lockheed P-38 Lightnings to North American P-51 Mustangs in the summer of 1944 and from then until the end of the war flew many long-range escort missions heavy bombers that attacked oil refineries, industries, and other strategic objectives at Berlin, Regensburg, Merseburg, Stuttgart, Brussels, and elsewhere. The 364th received a Distinguished Unit Citation for an escort mission on 27 December 1944 when the group dispersed a large force of German fighters that attacked the bomber formation the group was escorting on a raid to Frankfurt.

The group patrolled the English Channel during the Normandy invasion in June 1944, and, while continuing escort operations, supported ground forces in France after the invasion by strafing and bombing locomotives, marshalling yards, bridges, barges, and other targets.

The 364th also flew air-sea rescue missions, engaged in patrol activities, and continued to support ground forces as the battle line moved through France and into Germany. Took part in the effort to invade the Netherlands by air, September 1944; the Battle of the Bulge, December 1944 – January 1945; and the assault across the Rhine, March 1945.
Although the last mission by the 364th took place on 25 April 1945, the group did not depart until November, returning to Camp Kilmer, New Jersey, for inactivation. Even then, Honington remained the lone Eighth Air Force outpost in the UK becoming Fighter Command HQ on 5 October. Honington was the last USAAF station to be returned to the RAF. By the beginning of 1946, the airfield remained the only active station which had been used by the Eighth Air Force and a fitting ceremony was planned to mark its closure and official handing back to the Royal Air Force. On 26 February, Brigadier General Emil Kiel – the Eighth Fighter Command commander – was present to hand over the keys of the station to Air Marshal Sir James Robb, AOC RAF Fighter Command. An RAF band played &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot; as the Stars and Stripes were lowered for the RAF Ensign to be hoisted in its place. The airfield, which was the first transferred to the United States Army Air Forces for its use in 1942, was the last to be returned to the Air Ministry.

===Back to Royal Air Force control===

RAF Honington was then used by RAF Transport Command. The station provided support the Berlin Airlift and was transferred to RAF Bomber Command in 1949. It accommodated storage facilities for No. 94 Armament Maintenance Unit in the 1950s and a 9,000 ft concrete runway was completed in 1956.

Bomber squadrons, 10, XV, 44, and 57 flying the English Electric Canberra were based at the station from 1955 to 1957 and 10 and XV Squadrons saw action in the Suez Crisis.

In 1956, RAF Honington also became a V bomber base: squadrons, Nos, 7, 90, and 199 flew Vickers Valiant while squadron Nos, 55 and 57 flew Handley Page Victors.

In 1965 the station was put into reserve to accommodate the proposed General Dynamics F-111 fleet: the married quarters were used for evacuees from the Aden Emergency at that time.

The station then became home to Hawker Siddeley (Blackburn) Buccaneer bombers from November 1969. Squadron Nos. 12, 15 and 16 were formed. 15 and 16 squadrons moved to RAF Laarbruch in West Germany in 1971. No. 237 OCU (Operational Conversion Unit) was formed at Honington when the RAF took over Buccaneer training from the Royal Navy. 208 and 216 squadrons were also based there. The Buccaneer fleet (12, 208, and 237 OCU) moved to RAF Lossiemouth in Scotland.
The station was then selected to become a base for the RAF&#x27;s Panavia Tornado fleet in 1981. In August 1982 IX(B) Squadron was reformed at RAF Honington, becoming the world&#x27;s first operational Tornado squadron. Equipment included the WE.177 nuclear bomb. IX Squadron relocated to RAF Bruggen in Germany in 1986. No. 45 Squadron was the sole occupant until XIII Squadron formed there in January 1990.

=== RAF Regiment Depot ===
On 15 July 1992, it was announced that the Tornados would depart Honington and that the station would relinquish its primary flying role and become the RAF Regiment Depot. As a result, the TWCU moved to Lossiemouth (to replace the Buccaneers) in November 1993. Honington ceased to be a flying station on 1 February 1994 when No. 13 Squadron relocated to RAF Marham. The Depot moved in June 1994, when RAF Catterick in North Yorkshire, home of the previous depot, transferred to the British Army.

RAF Honington became the home to 611 Volunteer Gliding Squadron due to the closure of RAF Watton in April 2012, requiring their conversion to the Grob 109B Vigilant motor glider until the closure of that unit in 2016.

During 2018, No. 2 Squadron RAF Regiment moved to RAF Brize Norton in Oxfordshire, completing the move in September of that year. No. 20 Wing RAF Regiment (Defence Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear (CBRN) Wing) disbanded on 1 April 2019 having been at Honington since 2011. The CBRN role was taken over by 28 Engineer Regiment of the Royal Engineers, with No. 27 Squadron RAF Regiment coming under army command, before disbanding in October 2021.

== Role and operations ==
RAF Honington&#x27;s mission statement is &quot;Delivering Air Force Protection Capability for the RAF and Defence&quot;. The station is the single hub for RAF Force Protection, incorporating the RAF Regiment Headquarters and the RAF Police Headquarters. Together they are responsible for protecting the RAF at home and abroad. The station is home to over 1,500 military personnel, civil servants and contractors. RAF Honington is home to three RAF Regiment field squadrons. Through the RAF Force Protection Centre and RAF Regiment Training Wing, the station also provides initial and advanced training for members of the RAF Regiment and specialist training for the RAF&#x27;s entire Force Protection capability. The RAF Police is the service police branch of the Royal Air Force and Honington is home to the RAF Police Headquarters. It also accommodates No. 1 (Tactical) Police Squadron which provides field policing, and reserve unit No. 3 (Tactical) Police Squadron (Royal Auxiliary Air Force) which provides a general policing and aviation security capability.

== Heritage ==
=== Station badge and motto ===
RAF Honington&#x27;s badge, awarded in June 1956, features the head of St. Edmund in front of two crossed arrows pointing downwards. The head of St. Edmund represents the nearby town of Bury St Edmunds which is approximately to the south east of the station, in whose coat of arms the representation is featured. The arrows in saltire, represent St. Edmund&#x27;s martyrdom.

The station&#x27;s motto (&quot;Pro anglia valens&quot;) is in Latin and translates into English as &quot;Valiant for England&quot;.

=== Built heritage ===

Two Second World War era hardened field fortifications survive within the airfield boundary. The Pickett-Hamilton forts were designated as scheduled monuments by English Heritage (now Historic England) in September 2002. The forts were constructed in late 1940 in order to provide ground defence for the airfield. A third example is thought to have been destroyed during redevelopment of the station after the war.

The forts were designed to be lowered into the ground while not in use; as such they would be inconspicuous and would not interfere with the passage of taxiing aircraft or vehicles. The forts could be raised to about above ground level where each would pose a physical impediment to aircraft and vehicles and from where a small crew could fire rifles or light machine guns.

The examples at Honington are described by Historic England as having &quot;importance as comparatively rare surviving examples of an unusual and innovative type of airfield defence installation. The outer structure and lifting heads of both remain in good condition, and the example which is in working order, with its principal internal fittings intact, is of particular interest.&quot;

<doc id="910566" wikidata="Q7762699" url="?curid=910566" title="The Screaming Tribesmen">
<text>The Screaming Tribesmen were an Australian rock band formed in Brisbane, Queensland in 1981 by mainstay Mick Medew on lead vocals and lead guitar. With various line-ups they released three studio albums, &quot;Bones and Flowers&quot; (October 1987), &quot;Blood Lust&quot; (1990) and &quot;Formaldehyde&quot; (1993), before disbanding in 1998. They reformed in 2011 for performances until June 2012. Australian musicologist, Ian McFarlane, described how they, &quot;fashioned a memorable brand of 1960s-inspired pop rock that combined equal parts existential lyric angst, melodic inventiveness and strident guitar riffs.&quot;

== History ==

The Screaming Tribesmen were formed in Brisbane in 1981 by mainstay Mick Medew on lead vocals and lead guitar, (ex-31st), with John Hartley on bass guitar and Murray Shepherd on drums (both ex-the Fun Things). They had met when their bands performed on the same bill at local venues. The Screaming Tribesmen developed &quot;a grassroots following&quot; and their early material included the 31st&#x27;s tracks, &quot;Igloo&quot; and &quot;A Stand Alone&quot;, which had been co-written by Medew and Ron Peno.

Peno explained writing his lyrics, &quot;[&#x27;Igloo&#x27;] actually came from me reading Franz Kafka&#x27;s &quot;Metamorphosis&quot;. It was me talking about an igloo being all white and positive, the Shoeshine Boys being negative... I dunno, one of those silly things I was going through when I was very young.&quot; Peno felt the early line-up of the Screaming Tribesmen, &quot;didn&#x27;t work out&quot;, and left in 1981 to join another local group, the End.

The Screaming Tribesmen&#x27;s debut four-track extended play, &quot;Screaming Tribesman&quot;, appeared on EMI&#x27;s Custom Records label in early 1982. Steve Gardner of &quot;Divine Rites&quot; described how its, &quot;production has a rough and ready punk style and the songs vary from the 60&#x27;s R&amp;B of &#x27;Turn on Your Love Light&#x27; to the fairly straight punk of &#x27;Trans 43&#x27;. It was followed by a second four-track EP, &quot;I Don&#x27;t Wanna Know&quot;, in 1983. Their first two singles, &quot;Igloo&quot; (October 1983) and &quot;A Stand Alone&quot; (November 1984) were produced by Chris Masuak via Citadel Records. By the end of 1983 Medew had relocated the band to Sydney, with Hartley and Shepherd returning to Brisbane early in the following year.

Medew formed a new line-up in July 1984 with Masuak (ex-Radio Birdman, the Hitmen) on guitar, piano and backing vocals; Mark Kingsmill on drums and Tony Robertson (both ex-the Hitmen, New Christs) on bass guitar. Kingsmill left to join Hoodoo Gurus a month later, Chris Welch played a few shows &amp; left to join Died Pretty replaced by Michael Charles on drums, and Robertson left on the same day as Chris Welch was replaced by Bob Wackley on bass guitar ( Bob Hood, ex-Razar, Grooveyard) in November. In September 1985 they issued their next four-track EP, &quot;Date with a Vampyre&quot;, also produced by Masuak. Gardner observed, &quot;[the] title track of this record features a crunching riff that hooks hard over the top of a stuttering drumbeat and is one of the great songs of the mid 80s. The other 3 tracks aren&#x27;t quite as strong, but the overall effect is good enough to make this record one of the indisposable classics of the period.&quot; Warwick Fraser (ex-Feather, Hoi Polloi) replaced Charles in 1986 on drums.

Their next EP, &quot;Top of the Town&quot;, had six tracks; it was released in September 1986 on the boutique, Rattlesnake Records label, which was co-produced by Masuak with Alan Thorne. Ian McFarlane, an Australian musicologist described it as, &quot;a more lightweight guitar-pop sound, and failed to live up to expectations.&quot; In January 1987 they toured eastern Australia before starting to record their first full-length album in the following month, &quot;Bones and Flowers&quot; (October 1987), with Masuak and Thorne co-producing. The title, &quot;referred to the mix in the band&#x27;s
music – between loud, hard-edged rock, and &#x27;pretty songs&#x27;.&quot; McFarlane felt they had &quot;returned to their hard rock roots.&quot;

&quot;Bones and Flowers&quot; provided two singles, &quot;I&#x27;ve Got a Feeling&quot; (September 1987) and &quot;Casualty of Love&quot; (March 1988). The band toured the United States in support of the album, while at home they had a run of Alternative hits. In the US their work had regular airplay on the College Radio circuit. Their first music video, &quot;I&#x27;ve Got a Feeling&quot;, featured on US MTV&#x27;s &quot;120 Minutes&quot;. It reached No. 1 on the KROQ charts in Los Angeles and No. 7 on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Modern Rock chart. Gardner felt, &quot;you are likely to have been put off by the arena-rock treatment they give the song, but if you listen closely, you can hear the usual brilliant guitar line basis that the [group] use for most of their best songs.&quot;

In April 1989 Fraser, Masuak and Wackley all left the group. Medew formed a new line-up with members of Melbourne band, Radio Luxembourg, Jeff Silver on bass guitar and Ritchie Hine on drums and former Kings of the Sun guitarist, Glenn Morris. This line-up released a five-track, EP, &quot;Take Cover&quot;, with cover versions in late 1989. The group&#x27;s second album, &quot;Blood Lust&quot;, appeared in March 1991. McFarlane observed, &quot;[it] included a couple of the band&#x27;s heaviest ever songs like &#x27;High Priestess&#x27;, &#x27;Frozen Tracks&#x27;, &#x27;Something Dangerous&#x27; and &#x27;Queen of the Night Time World&#x27;.&quot;

Morris departed and was briefly replaced by Brian Mann on guitar, during 1989 and 1990, who was replaced in turn by Ash Geary before Morris returned at the end of 1992. In late 1991 Hine was replaced by Celibate Rifles&#x27; Paul Larsen on drums. The group released another album, &quot;Formaldehyde&quot; (July 1993), co-produced by Rob Younger, the Screaming Tribesmen and Mike Wood. Tony Cardinal (ex-Candy Harlots) replaced Larsen on drums.

Medew continued to tour, write and record with various line-ups. He resumed performing as Mick Medew and the Rumours featuring ex-the Screaming Tribesmen and Lost Boys, Chris Dixon and Ash Geary, with bass player, Paul Hawker. In 1997 the Screaming Tribesmen were reformed by Medew with Cardinal and Andy Newman on bass guitar and keyboards (ex-Trans 262, Rattlesnake Shake, Manifestations). McFarlane noted that they, &quot;fashioned a memorable brand of 1960s-inspired pop rock that combined equal parts existential lyric angst, melodic inventiveness and strident guitar riffs.&quot; Adrian Cunningham determined, &quot;Unfortunately, as time went on the band descended into b-grade hard rock and denim clichés. But they will be forever lionised for the cavernous guitar and haunting melody and lyrics of &#x27;Igloo&#x27;.&quot;

In January 2011 Medew performed a set of the Screaming Tribesmen songs in Sydney with former guitarist and song writing partner, Masuak. In September of that year, the line-up of Fraser, Masuak, Medew and Wackley reformed for a series of shows on the Australian east coast beginning with the Gathering Festival, Brisbane. They subsequently performed in Melbourne and Sydney, on the back of CD re-issues, &quot;Date with a Vampyre&quot; / &quot;Top of the Town&quot; and &quot;Bones and Flowers&quot; via Australian label, Grown Up Wrong. The band played at the Azkena Rock Festival in Spain and toured France throughout June 2012 and disbanded soon after.

<text>The Inside Passage () is a coastal route for ships and boats along a network of passages which weave through the islands on the Pacific Northwest coast of the North American Fjordland. The route extends from southeastern Alaska in the United States, through western British Columbia in Canada, to northwestern Washington state in the United States. Ships using the route can avoid some of the bad weather in the open ocean and may visit some of the many isolated communities along the route. The Inside Passage is heavily travelled by cruise ships, freighters, tugs with tows, fishing craft, pleasure craft, and ships of the Alaska Marine Highway, BC Ferries, and Washington State Ferries systems. Coast Guard vessels of both Canada and the United States patrol and transit in the Passage. 

The term &quot;Inside Passage&quot; is also often used to refer to the ocean and islands around the passage itself.

==Route==
It is generally accepted that the southernmost point of the Inside Passage is Olympia, Washington, which is also the southernmost point of Puget Sound. Moving north, the passage continues into the waters of the greater Salish Sea. It then passes through the Strait of Georgia and Johnstone Strait, between northeastern Vancouver Island and the coast of mainland British Columbia. From there it continues further northwest into the Alaska Panhandle. The northernmost points of the Passage are Haines and Skagway at the head of the Lynn Canal. As a result of often uncertain weather, large tidal range, fast or unpredictable currents, and infrequent safe anchorages, navigating the Inside Passage can be difficult. 

During the Klondike Gold Rush the passage was one of the sea routes from Seattle and California, carrying American prospectors northward.

Today, approximately 36,000 recreational cruising boats utilize portions of the Inside Passage route. The nonprofit Marine Exchange of Alaska plots and follows vessel traffic in the Alaskan section of the Inside Passage. Captain Warren Good has catalogued some 3,641 shipwrecks along the Alaska portion of the Passage. The Underwater Archeological Society of British Columbia conducts periodic Regional Shipwreck Surveys.

===Washington portion===
Washington&#x27;s portion of the route is made up almost entirely of the waterways of Puget Sound. Starting from the southernmost point of Budd Inlet, the waterway turns toward the northeast and broadens as it becomes the Nisqually Reach of Puget Sound. The waterway then continues northeast, through the Tacoma Narrows, northward toward the San Juan Islands just southeast of the border with Canada.

===British Columbia portion===
British Columbia&#x27;s 1,125 km (700 mi) portion of the route includes the wide, protected Strait of Georgia between Vancouver Island and the B.C. mainland, the narrow Johnstone Strait and Discovery Passage between Vancouver Island and the mainland, Blackfish Sound at the northern end of Vancouver Island as well as a long stretch of 400 km (250 mi) between islands and reaches or along the wider and more exposed Hecate Strait near Haida Gwaii (formerly the Queen Charlotte Islands). From Fitz Hugh Sound northwards, the route is sheltered from Pacific winds and waves by the various large islands in the area such as Princess Royal Island and Pitt Island. This section includes a series of channels and straits, from south to north: Fisher Channel, Lama Passage, Seaforth Channel, Milbanke Sound, Finlayson Channel, Sarah Passage, Tolmie Channel, Princess Royal Channel (includes Graham Reach and Fraser Reach), McKay Reach, Wright Sound, Grenville Channel, Arthur Passage, and Chatham Sound.

===Alaska portion===

Alaska&#x27;s portion of the Inside Passage extends from north to south and from east to west. The area encompasses 1,000 islands and thousands of coves and bays. While the Alexander Archipelago in Alaska provides some protection from the Pacific Ocean weather, much of the area experiences strong semi-diurnal tides. Lynn Canal is the northernmost waterway of the Inside Passage.

==Tourism==
The Inside Passage is a popular tourism destination. The coastal mountain ranges and islands offer wildlife viewing and opportunities for boating, fishing, kayaking, camping and hiking. Wildlife viewing in the region ranges from birding to whale watching and bear viewing. Designated bear viewing is available at Anan Creek near Wrangell and at Pack Creek Bear Sanctuary on Admiralty Island near Juneau.

The most popular way to explore the Inside Passage during summer is by cruise ship. Over 2 million people take cruises each year in this region, impacting the local economy significantly. Because there are few restrictions on ship size, all of the large main line cruise ships offer Inside Passage itineraries. Some of the major players include Norwegian, Disney, Princess, Celebrity Cunard, etc. Most of these cruises offer round-trips from either Vancouver or Seattle. Cruise ship travel in 2020 was cancelled due to the Coronavirus Pandemic and uncertainty continued through February 2022 when Canada had kept cruise ships banned. 

Although a smaller industry, there are also a handful of expedition cruises that explore the Inside Passage. These ships tend to be smaller than main line cruises and focus more on wildlife watching. National Geographic operate several expedition boats here.

==1994 Transit Fee Crisis==
During the salmon treaty negotiations in early 1994, Canada concluded that the United States was not responsive to Canada&#x27;s concerns. 
Accordingly, on June 15, 1994, Canada imposed a transit fee on all US commercial fishing boats using the Canadian Inside Passage. This fee was eventually lifted through bilateral negotiations. The crisis remained peaceful and there were no violent incidents between US fishing boats and Canadian enforcement officials.

In response to the Canadian action, on October 24, 1995, the US Congress passed an amendment to the Fishermen&#x27;s Protective Act, adding provisions permitting the U.S. government to directly reimburse US fishers for fines and other costs associated with seizures by foreign governments.

==Cultural references==
British author Jonathan Raban described his journey by boat through the Inside Passage from Seattle to Juneau in his 1999 travelogue &quot;Passage to Juneau: A Sea and Its Meanings&quot;.

In &quot;The Curve of Time&quot; (1961), Canadian travel writer M. Wylie Blanchet chronicled her travels by boat in the 1920s and 1930s with her five children throughout the Inside Passage waters between Vancouver Island and the mainland. Blanchet&#x27;s biographer states that the book has become &quot;one of the leading books on cruising the Inside Passage from the southeast coast of Vancouver Island to Cape Caution&quot;.

<doc id="910574" wikidata="Q2574100" url="?curid=910574" title="Pratt &amp; Whitney TF30">
<text>The Pratt &amp; Whitney TF30 (company designation JTF10A) is a military low-bypass turbofan engine originally designed by Pratt &amp; Whitney for the subsonic F6D Missileer fleet defense fighter, but this project was cancelled. It was later adapted with an afterburner for supersonic designs, and in this form it was the world&#x27;s first production afterburning turbofan, going on to power the F-111 and the F-14A Tomcat, as well as being used in early versions of the A-7 Corsair II without an afterburner. First flight of the TF30 was in 1964 and production continued until 1986.

==Design and development==

In 1958, the Douglas Aircraft Company proposed a short-range, four-engined jet airliner to fill the gap below its new DC-8 intercontinental, known internally as the Model 2067. Intended to be marketed as DC-9, it was not directly related to the later twin-engined Douglas DC-9. Pratt &amp; Whitney (P&amp;W) had offered its JT8A turbojet for the airliner, but Douglas preferred to go with a turbofan engine, which would have a greater fuel efficiency than a turbojet. P&amp;W then proposed the JT10A, a half-scale version of its newly developed JT8D turbofan. Development of the new design began in April 1959, using the core of the JT8. Douglas shelved the model 2067 design in 1960, as the targeted US airlines preferred the newly offered Boeing 727.

In 1960, the United States Navy selected the JT10A, designated TF30-P-1, to power the proposed Douglas F6D Missileer, but the project was canceled in April 1961. Meanwhile, the TF30 had been chosen by General Dynamics for its entrant in the TFX competition for the United States Air Force and USN, which was selected for production as the F-111. The version of the TF30 for the F-111 included an afterburner.

==Operational history==

===F-111===

The F-111A, EF-111A and F-111E used the TF30-P-3 turbofan. The F-111 had problems with inlet compatibility, and many faulted the placement of the intakes behind the disturbed air of the wing. Newer F-111 variants incorporated improved intake designs and most variants featured more powerful versions of the TF30 engine. The F-111E was updated to use TF30-P-103 engines, the F-111D included the TF30-P-9/109, the FB-111A used the TF-30-P-7/107, and the F-111F had the TF30-P-100. 

RAAF F-111Cs were upgraded with the unique P-108 version, using a P-109 engine mated to a P-107 afterburner. The F-111 Engine Business Unit (later taken over by TAE) at RAAF Base Amberley became the world experts on the TF-30 in the years after the USAF retired their fleet and achieved extraordinary increases in reliability of the TF-30. 

The TF30 proved itself to be well-suited to the requirements of a high-speed low-altitude strike aircraft with a relatively long operational range, and F-111s in all guises would continue to use TF30s until their retirement.

===A-7===
In 1964, the subsonic LTV A-7A Corsair II won the US Navy&#x27;s VAL competition for a light attack aircraft to replace the Douglas A-4 Skyhawk. The A-7A used a non-afterburning variant of the TF30, which would also power the improved A-7B and A-7C. In 1965, the USAF selected the A-7D as a replacement for its fast-jet F-100 and F-105 supersonic fighter-bombers in the close air support role. Though the USAF had wanted the TF30, Pratt &amp; Whitney was unable to meet the production timetable, because its facilities were already committed to producing other engines. Instead of producing the TF30 under license for P&amp;W, the Allison Engine Company offered to the Air Force its TF41 turbofan, a license-built version of the RB.168-25R Spey. The USAF selected the more powerful TF41 for the A-7D, as did the USN, for its similar A-7E.

===F-14===
The Grumman F-14 Tomcat with the TF30-P-414A was underpowered, because it was the Navy&#x27;s intent to procure a jet fighter with a thrust-to-weight ratio (in clean configuration) of 1 or better (the US Air Force had the same goals for the F-15 Eagle and F-16 Fighting Falcon). However, due to reliability issues with the intended Pratt &amp; Whitney F401 engines and the intent to incorporate as many of the systems of the failed Navy version of the F-111, the F-111B, into the project, it was deemed that the initial production run of F-14s utilize the F-111B&#x27;s powerplant. The F-14A&#x27;s thrust-to-weight ratio was similar to the F-4 Phantom II; however, the new fuselage and wing design provided greater lift and a better climb profile than the F-4. The TF30 was found to be ill-adapted to the demands of air combat and was prone to compressor stalls at high angle of attack (AOA), if the pilot moved the throttles aggressively. Because of the Tomcat&#x27;s widely spaced engine nacelles, compressor stalls at high AOA were especially dangerous because they tended to produce asymmetric thrust that could send the Tomcat into an upright or inverted spin, from which recovery was very difficult.

The F-14&#x27;s problems did not afflict TF30 engines in the USAF and RAAF F-111s to nearly the same extent. The F-111, while technically designated as a &quot;fighter,&quot; was actually used as a ground attack aircraft and tactical bomber. A typical ground strike mission is characterized by less abrupt changes in throttle, angle of attack and altitude than an air-to-air combat mission. While it can still involve hard and violent maneuvers to avoid enemy missiles and aircraft, these maneuvers are generally still not nearly as hard and violent as those required in air-to-air combat, and the F-111 is a larger and less-maneuverable aircraft. Though the F-14A entered service with the Navy powered by the Pratt &amp; Whitney TF30, by the end of the decade, following numerous problems with the original engine, the Department of Defense began procuring General Electric F110-GE-400 engines and installed them in the F-14A Plus (later redesignated to F-14B in 1991), which entered service with the fleet in 1988. These engines solved the reliability problems and provided nearly 30% more thrust, achieving a 1:1 dry thrust to weight ratio with a low fuel load. The subsequent F-14D, a combination of both remanufactured/upgraded F-14As and new manufacture F-14Ds, also used F110-GE-400 engines.

<text>Imjin Barracks is a British Army installation situated near Innsworth in Gloucestershire, that is home to the headquarters of NATO&#x27;s Allied Rapid Reaction Corps (ARRC).

==History==
Imjin Barracks is located at the site of the former RAF Innsworth, which was a non-flying Royal Air Force station between 1940 and 2008.
The station opened in 1940, the first unit based there being No 7 School of Technical Training, which trained engine and airframe fitters and mechanics. In December 1941, No 2 WAAF Depot was opened at Innsworth and from then on the station became increasingly associated with the women&#x27;s branch of the service. Eventually it was decided to reserve the station almost exclusively for WAAF training, including barrage balloon training amongst other vital roles. 

In 1951, the headquarters of the RAF Record Office which had been based nearby in Gloucester and Barnwood, moved to the station and gained Group status. Three years later, in 1954, No. 5 Personnel Despatch Unit arrived, charged with the administration and processing of personnel selected for overseas service.

Just after the war ended, the RAF Base Accounts Office moved from York to Gloucester and grew into the Central Pay Office and became part of the RAF Personnel and Training Command, which formed in 1994, based at Innsworth. 

In 2005 it was announced that HQ Personnel and Training Command was to co-locate with HQ RAF Strike Command at RAF High Wycombe. The new collocated HQ&#x27;s were subsequently merged to form Air Command and the decision was taken to close RAF Innsworth. The drawdown took place over the next three years with elements of the Personnel Management Agency moved to High Wycombe and RAF Cranwell. RAF Innsworth finally closed on 31 March 2008.

==Army control==
The Innsworth site is now managed by the Army and has been renamed Imjin Barracks. When the RAF vacated the site in 2008, elements of AFPAA (renamed Defence Business Services in 2014) including the MoD Medal Office and Joint Casualty and Compassionate Centre continued to operate from the site.

In 2010, the barracks also became home to the NATO Allied Rapid Reaction Corps (ARRC), a 3-star headquarters with more than 400 permanent staff from 21 contributing nations, which relocated from the Rheindahlen Military Complex in Germany.

The barracks were named after the Battle of the Imjin River because of the connection with the Gloucestershire Regiment, which formed part of the United Nations contingent in the Korean War, and was thought to be an appropriate name for the headquarters of ARRC, which is a multinational force.

<doc id="910587" wikidata="Q290687" url="?curid=910587" title="Adult (band)">
<text>Adult (stylized as ADULT.) is an American band from Detroit, Michigan, formed in 1998 by married couple Nicola Kuperus and Adam Lee Miller. The band integrates vocals with drum machines, analog synthesizers and electronic/punk elements. Both band members have art degrees. Miller has a painting degree, and Kuperus a photography degree.

==History==
Before forming Adult, Miller was one half of the band Le Car and released solo material under the name Artificial Material. Adult began releasing albums in 1998 under the pseudonym &quot;Plasma Co.&quot; Initially, the band members were uncredited and not publicized, but by the time &quot;Anxiety Always&quot; was released, Adult was listed as husband-and-wife team Adam Lee Miller and Nicola Kuperus. Miller and Kuperus are also the founders of the Ersatz Audio record label. When launching their tour in support of the D.U.M.E. EP, Adult announced that they had become a trio with the addition of guitarist Samuel Consiglio. The trio was short-lived – Consiglio left the band at the start of 2006. While popular in their home city of Detroit, they also enjoy a cult following throughout the rest of the US and are also very popular in Germany and the United Kingdom. They toured with Trans Am in 2002, and in May 2003, the band made its first headlining tour in the United States; gigs across Europe followed soon after. 

Adult have remixed other artists, most notably Felix da Housecat, Fischerspooner, Ladytron, A Number of Names, The Faint, Erase Errata and Bis. Kuperus (who is also responsible for Adult&#x27;s album artwork and photography) has sung on the recordings of other electronic acts including Death in Vegas, Swayzak and Chicks On Speed. Kuperus has also showcased her photography at museums around the United States and Europe. Between 2008 and 2010, Adult produced the film &quot;thee Three Graces tryptic: Decampment, Traditions &amp; Possession(s)&quot;, which was only shown with Adult performing the score live. It was screened at Anthology Film Archives (NY), Detroit Institute of Arts (Detroit), Distrital y Cineteca National: Mexico City Film Festival amongst other theaters. In 2010, Adult wrote and recorded the original score to the film OPEN by Jake Yuzna. In 2013, the art museum Mattress Factory in Pittsburgh invited Adult to contribute an installation; the result was called &quot;Diptyching&quot; which included audio, video, and the re-creation of a life size façade of a house. In conjunction with the piece, Adult released a limited edition 12&quot; Work/Wreck which included the music from the installation.

Adult&#x27;s eighth studio album, &quot;Perception is/as/of Deception&quot;, was released in April 2020 on Dais.

<doc id="910601" wikidata="Q6990649" url="?curid=910601" title="Nelson Memorial, Swarland">
<text>The Nelson Memorial, Swarland is a white freestone obelisk at Swarland in north Northumberland, England. Erected in 1807, two years after the death of Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson, victor of the Battle of Trafalgar, it was placed by his friend and sometime agent, Alexander Davison, who owned an estate centred on the now demolished Swarland Hall. It is a Grade II listed monument.

This relatively obscure memorial stands by the old A1 (the great road between Morpeth and Alnwick, according to an 1868 gazetteer).

Davison made his fortune in the late 18th century after travelling to Quebec, where he met and became a friend of the 24-year-old Nelson, who was commanding HMS &quot;Albemarle&quot;, which was docked at Quebec City during the War of American Independence. Later in life, Nelson engaged Davison as an agent to represent him at naval tribunals dealing with the distribution of the spoils of battle.

The obelisk is not the only Nelson memorial at Swarland. A line of trees on the estate represents the Nile delta, whilst other groups of trees represent the positions of French and British ships engaged in the Battle of the Nile. 
There are three inscriptions on the monument; from top to bottom:

*England expects every man to do his duty
*Victory 21 October 1805 (&quot;the date referring to the Battle of Trafalgar&quot;)
*Not to Commemorate the Public Virtues and Heroic Achievements of Nelson, which is the duty of England; But to the Memory of Private Friendship, this erection is dedicated by Alexander Davison, Swarland Hall

The erection of the memorial arguably represented the zenith of Davison&#x27;s social standing; he was imprisoned for a year for fraud in 1808, and never recovered his position.

In contemporary times, the memorial has become obscure since the course of the road changed when the A1 passing Swarland was converted to a dual carriageway. Davison&#x27;s obelisk lies on the old A1, used only by local traffic, hidden from the main road by a stand of trees.

Carved onto the face of the obelisk are two Ordnance Survey bench marks, and on the south side is Ordnance Survey flush bracket number 1973. Maps indicate the height of the flush bracket as 117 metres above sea level. The stonemason&#x27;s name is carved on the top of the plinth on the north side.

The monument and site was restored by the local authorities, and a plaque erected, in about 2003.

<text>The Women&#x27;s [[beach volleyball]] event at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece, was held at the Olympic Beach Volleyball Centre located at the Faliro Coastal Zone Olympic Complex. The gold medal went to Kerri Walsh and Misty May who had a perfect record in the tournament, losing not a single set.
The reigning champions from the 2000 Olympics, Natalie Cook and Kerri Ann Pottharst, both had new partners for Athens and coincidentally met at the last sixteen stage where Cook&#x27;s team took the honours. Adriana Behar and Shelda Bede repeated their 2000 Olympic result, taking silver.

==Pool play==

The 24 competing teams were split equally into six pools of four, and each team played each of the other teams in their pool a best of three set match (so that the number of pool matches, P, played by each team was 3).

The teams in each pool were ranked first through fourth based on the number of matches won, W. In the event of a two-way tie, the winning team in the head-to-head match finished ahead. In a three-team tie, the total number of points each team won and lost during all matches involving only the three tied teams were added up, and the bottom-ranked team of the three was decided by the &quot;points for&quot; to &quot;points against&quot; ratio; the other two teams were then ranked according to the outcome of the head-to-head match. The top two teams from each pool and the four best third placed teams (based on: first, matches won; second (in the event of a tie), set ratio SF/SA; and third (if there is still a tie), points ratio PF/PA) progressed through to the round of sixteen (single elimination tournament).

Two points (Pts) were awarded for each match win (W) and one point was given for each loss (L).&lt;br&gt;
In individual matches, all winners are shown in bold.&lt;br&gt;
In group tables, advancing teams are highlighted.

<text>The 94th Division was a unit of the United States Army in World War I, and of the Organized Reserve Corps in 1921 until 1942.

The 94th Infantry Division was a unit of the United States Army in World War II, and of the United States Army Reserve from 1956 until 1963. It continued in the Army Reserve as the 94th Command Headquarters (Divisional) from 1963 until the Army&#x27;s realignment of reserve component combat arms into the Army National Guard in 1967.

The 94th Army Reserve Command (later redesignated 94th Regional Support Command and 94th Regional Readiness Command) was a regional command and control headquarters over most United States Army Reserve units throughout the six New England states of Maine, Massachusetts, Vermont, New Hampshire, Connecticut, and Rhode Island. For forty years, beginning in the late 1960s, the United States Army Reserve was divided up into a varying number of regional, branch-immaterial commands. Originally designated &quot;army reserve commands&quot; (&quot;ARCOMs&quot;), several were disbanded in and around 1995, while the remainder were redesignated &quot;regional support commands&quot; (&quot;RSCs&quot;) at that time and re-dubbed &quot;regional readiness commands&quot; (&quot;RRCs&quot;) in 2001. In addition to the RRCs, several mission-oriented commands were established, including such as training divisions and engineer commands. Like most RRCs, the 94th Regional Readiness Command was scheduled to be deactivated in fiscal year 2009 as part of the Army Reserve&#x27;s reorganization into a functionally based command structure reporting to respective major Army commands (&quot;MACOMs&quot;); plans were altered, the 94th became a training division headquartered at Fort Lee, now Fort Gregg-Adams.

The 94th ARCOM/RSC/RRC wore the shoulder sleeve insignia of the 94th Infantry Division but did not, according to the United States Army Center of Military History, perpetuate the lineage of the old division and was thus not entitled to the division&#x27;s battle honors, as it is against Army policy for TDA organizations, such as ARCOMs, RSCs and RRCs, to perpetuate the lineage of TO&amp;E units, such as infantry divisions. Army Regulation 840-10 dictates that the distinguishing flag of an RRC features a white-bordered, 38.1 cm (15 in.) tall rendering of the shoulder sleeve insignia on a plain blue background, rather than on the horizontally divided bi-colour background of red over blue as carried by an infantry division.

Although the 94th RRC did not carry the lineage of the 94th Infantry Division, today&#x27;s 94th Military Police Company (formerly under the 94th RRC) carries the lineage of the World War II Military Police Platoon, 94th Infantry Division. The 94th Military Police Company also served in Desert Storm, Bosnia, and most recently Iraq. In 2003-04 the 94th MPs added a battle streamer to their guidon when they were awarded the Valorous Unit Award for their actions in al-Anbar, hunting Iraqi Ba&#x27;ath members after the collapse of government and conducting Counter-Insurgency Operations against the increasing militant uprisings in Al-Qaim, Rutbah, Haditha, Baghdad, Ramadi and Fallujah. The 94th MPs were also awarded The &quot;Order of the Spur&quot; by Colonel Teeples of the 3d Armored Cavalry Regiment (3CR), as a nod to the combat action of the 94th Military Police Company during their mission with the 3d Cavalry Regiment. The history and spirit of the Military Police Platoon, 94th Infantry Division of World War II lives on with them.

The 94th Division (Force Sustainment) is a unit of the United States Army Reserve, charged with providing sustainment training throughout the United States. The division is based at Fort Gregg-Adams, Virginia and is subordinate to the 80th Training Command. The division has subordinate brigades that perform military occupational specialty (MOS) reclassification training. The division has brigades in the Continental United States and a multi-functional brigade in Puerto Rico. The 94th Infantry Division&#x27;s standard (flag) and lineage bestowed upon the 94th Division (Force Sustainment) at its activation in 2009.

==World War I==
The 94th Division originated in 1918 and was intended to be formed with Spanish-speaking troops enlisted from Puerto Rico. The Army found that it lacked enough Spanish-speaking instructors to train men for the support and service units of the division, so it was agreed to create it as a &quot;paper&quot; division comprising only four infantry regiments, like the 93rd Division. The infantry regiments were assigned numbers 373–376, which would have been associated with the National Army&#x27;s 94th Division. The 373rd and 374th Infantry Regiments were organized with Hispanic Puerto Ricans, while the 375th Infantry was organized with Afro–Puerto Ricans. The 376th Infantry was never organized. With the close of World War I, the units were disbanded at Camp Las Casas, Puerto Rico.

One of the division&#x27;s nicknames, the &quot;Neuf-Cats,&quot; most likely comes from this era, as most World War I combat involving Americans occurred in French-speaking areas and the number &quot;94&quot; was pronounced in French as &quot;Neuf-Quatre&quot;, literally, &quot;Nine-Four&quot;. As the pronunciation of the numeral four in French is similar to the English word &quot;cat,&quot; the division decided to adopt this as a nickname and pluralized it.

==Inter-war years==
The 94th Division was constituted in the Organized Reserve (present-day United States Army Reserve) on 24 June 1921, allotted to the First Corps Area, and assigned to the XI Corps. The division was further allotted to the state of Massachusetts as its home area. The 373rd-375th Infantry Regiments were allotted to Puerto Rico&#x27;s 211th Infantry Brigade as part of a hypothetical division which was never organized, and the 376th Infantry was assigned to the 94th Division. To flesh out the rest of the 94th Division&#x27;s infantry, the 301st and 302nd Infantry Regiments (part of the 76th Division in World War I) were assigned, along with the newly-constituted 419th Infantry. The 76th Division retained only its World War I-era 304th Infantry, taking the 385th Infantry from the 97th Division and adding the newly-constituted 417th and 418th Infantry Regiments, while the 97th Division took the 76th Division&#x27;s 303rd Infantry and retained the 386th-388th Infantry Regiments.

The 94th Division headquarters was organized in November 1921 at the Custom House Tower in Boston, and remained there until activated for World War II. The designated mobilization and training station for the division was Camp Devens (redesignated Fort Devens in 1931), Massachusetts, and it was also the location where much of the division&#x27;s training activities occurred in the interwar years. 

The 94th Division was originally nicknamed the &quot;Pilgrim Division&quot; in reference to the cultural history of Massachusetts. A shoulder sleeve insignia featuring a Native American with bow and arrow was authorized on 21 July 1922. This design was superseded 6 September 1923 by one depicting the black silhouette of a Puritan carrying a blunderbuss on his shoulder, on a gray circle, with the wording of the new design&#x27;s description was amended on 22 December of the same year.

For the few years when the division headquarters was called to duty for annual training as a unit, it often trained with the staff of the 18th Infantry Brigade, 9th Division, at Camp Devens. The annual training of the enlisted personnel of the headquarters included staff training, branch-specific training, and division-level command post exercises. For several years, the division conducted a “Special Officers Camp” at Camp Devens for unassigned officers, officers who could not attend training with their assigned units, and basic officer training for recent Reserve Officers&#x27; Training Corps and Citizens Military Training Camp commissionees. The division’s subordinate units trained all over the First Corps Area. The infantry regiments, for example, held their annual training primarily with the units of the 18th Infantry Brigade at Camp Devens and Fort Ethan Allen, Vermont. Other units, such as the special troops, artillery, engineers, aviation, medical, and quartermaster, trained at various posts in the First, Second, and Third Corps Areas, often with the active units of the 1st and 9th Divisions. For example, the division artillery trained at Fort Ethan Allen with the 7th Field Artillery; the 319th Engineer Regiment trained at Fort DuPont, Delaware, with the 1st Engineer Regiment; the 319th Medical Regiment trained at Carlisle Barracks, Pennsylvania, with the 1st Medical Regiment; and the 319th Observation Squadron trained with the 5th Observation Squadron at Mitchel Field, New York. 

In addition to the unit training camps, the infantry regiments rotated responsibility to conduct the Citizens Military Training Camps at Camp Devens each year. On a number of occasions, the division participated in First Corps Area and First Army command post exercises in conjunction with other Regular Army, National Guard, and Organized Reserve units. However, Organized Reserve units were even more seriously under-strength and received even less equipment and funds with which to train than did Regular and Guard units, which meant that the 94th Division did not participate in the various First Corps Area maneuvers and the First Army maneuvers of 1935, 1939, and 1941 as an organized unit due to lack of enlisted personnel and equipment. Instead, the officers and a few enlisted reservists were assigned to Regular and Guard units to fill vacant slots and bring the units up to war strength for the exercises. Additionally, some officers were assigned duties as umpires or support personnel.

==World War II==
===Re-formed ===
The 94th Division, like the other divisions of the Organized Reserve was not mobilized as a complete unit. In August 1940, President Franklin D. Roosevelt was given permission by Congress to order all members and units of the National Guard and all members of the Organized Reserve to active duty for one year. The officers and men of the 94th Division were subsequently individually assigned to existing Regular Army and National Guard units as needed, leaving the division virtually unmanned. The majority of mid-level officers (captains through lieutenant colonels) in the U.S. Army during the Second World War were Reserve officers. As such, the 94th provided leaders to every theater in the war.

Before Organized Reserve infantry divisions were ordered into active military service, they were reorganized on paper as &quot;triangular&quot; divisions under the 1940 tables of organization. The headquarters companies of the two infantry brigades were consolidated into the division&#x27;s cavalry reconnaissance troop, and one infantry regiment was removed by inactivation. The field artillery brigade headquarters and headquarters battery became the headquarters and headquarters battery of the division artillery. Its three field artillery regiments were reorganized into four battalions; one battalion was taken from each of the two 75 mm gun regiments to form two 105 mm howitzer battalions, the brigade&#x27;s ammunition train was reorganized as the third 105 mm howitzer battalion, and the 155 mm howitzer battalion was formed from the 155 mm howitzer regiment. The engineer, medical, and quartermaster regiments were reorganized into battalions. In 1942, divisional quartermaster battalions were split into ordnance light maintenance companies and quartermaster companies, and the division&#x27;s headquarters and military police company, which had previously been a combined unit, was split.

With virtually all of the division&#x27;s personnel having gone off to war without it, the 94th Division existed only on paper when its shoulder sleeve insignia was changed on 5 September 1942 to a half-black, half-gray circle with the Arabic numerals 9 and 4 superimposed in reverse colors. Ten days later, on 15 September 1942, the division was ordered into active military service as the 94th Infantry Division at Fort Custer near Kalamazoo, Michigan. To effect the initial organization of the 94th, the officer cadre below regimental level and the entire enlisted cadre was selected from the soldiers of the 77th Infantry Division, then stationed at Fort Jackson, South Carolina. Enlisted fillers to bring the division to full strength were not yet available and it was realized that the range facilities at Camp Custer would be inadequate to train an infantry division, so the Army Ground Forces ordered the 94th Infantry Division to Camp Phillips, near Salina, Kansas, in October 1942. From 5 to 20 December, filler replacements were received at Camp Phillips at the rate of 1,000 per day. The division remained at Camp Phillips until August 1943, and then trained at the Tennessee Maneuver Area until November 1943 before moving to a temporary station at Camp Forrest, near Tullahoma, Tennessee. During the maneuvers in Tennessee, the 94th Division was ordered to furnish 1,500 men as overseas replacements, and each of the 94th Infantry Division&#x27;s infantry battalions also transferred 100 men to the 8th Infantry Division, which had been alerted for overseas movement. The 94th Infantry Division then moved to Camp McCain, Mississippi, where it was alerted for overseas movement in May 1944. 

On 10 July 1944, the 376th Infantry Regiment was honored by Army and civilian dignitaries as the first &quot;Expert Infantry Regiment&quot; in U.S. Army history, meaning at least sixty-five percent of its soldiers had earned the Expert Infantryman Badge. The other two regiments of the 94th Infantry Division, the 301st and 302nd, qualified three days after the 376th as Expert Infantry Regiments, although they did not match the record of the latter regiment, which also had every company qualify for the &quot;Expert Infantry Company&quot; streamer.

===Combat chronicle===
Following a brief stay in England, the 94th landed on Utah Beach, France on D-Day + 94, 8 September 1944, and moved into Brittany to relieve the 6th Armored Division and assume responsibility for containing some 60,000 German troops besieged in their garrisons at the Channel ports of Lorient and Saint-Nazaire. The 94th inflicted over 2,700 casualties on the enemy and took 566 prisoners before being relieved by the 66th Infantry Division on New Year&#x27;s Day 1945.

As part of General George Patton&#x27;s United States Third Army, the 94th Infantry Division (&quot;94th ID&quot;) was known as &quot;Patton&#x27;s Golden Nugget&quot;. Moving east, the division relieved the 90th Infantry Division on 7 January 1945, taking positions in the Saar-Moselle Triangle south of Wasserbillig, facing the Siegfried Switch Line. Fresh for the fight, the 94th shifted to the offensive, 14 January, seizing Tettingen and Butzdorf that day. The following day, the Nennig-Berg-Wies area was wrested from the enemy, severe counterattacks followed, and it was at Nennig that the Germans gave the division its nickname &quot;Roosevelt&#x27;s Butchers&quot; for stacking the dead in houses and along roads and refusing prisoners, lacking the means to guard and transport them. Butzdorf, Berg, and most of Nennig changed hands several times before being finally secured. On the 20th, an unsuccessful battalion attack against Orscholz, eastern terminus of the switch position, resulted in loss of most of two companies. In early February, the division took Campholz Woods and seized Sinz. On 19 February 1945, supported by heavy artillery and air support, the division launched a full-scale attack with all three regiments, storming the heights of Munzigen Ridge, to breach the Siegfried Line switch-line defenses and clear the Berg-Munzingen Highway.

Moving forward, the 94th Infantry Division and the 10th Armored Division secured the area from Orscholz and Saarburg to the confluence of the Saar and Moselle Rivers by 21 February 1945. At Ayl, General Patton ordered troops to cross the Saar immediately, against the advice of many of his officers. Under command of Lieutenant Colonel William A. McNulty, the 94th&#x27;s 3rd Battalion, 301st Infantry Regiment crossed the icy and swollen Saar on 23 February 1945.

Despite Lt. Col. McNulty&#x27;s own preparatory reconnaissance in absence of other adequate intelligence and undertaken at considerable personal risk, many men and materiel were lost during the very ill-prepared Saar crossing. Two of the three crossings sites were eventually abandoned due to heavy and pinpoint German artillery and machinegun fire. After establishing a bridgehead at Serrig, the 376th Infantry Regiment was detached to assist the 10th Armored Division in the capture of Trier. By 2 March 1945, the division stretched over a 10-mile front, from Hocker Hill on the Saar through Zerf, and Lampaden to Ollmuth. A heavy German attack near Lampaden achieved penetrations, but the line was shortly restored, and on 13 March, spearheading XX Corps, the division broke out of the Ruwer River bridgehead by ford and bridge. Driving forward, the 94th reached the Rhine on 21 March, where it fought in the Battle for Ludwigshafen. Ludwigshafen was taken on 24 March, in conjunction with Combat Command A of the 12th Armored Division.

The division then moved by rail and motor to the vicinity of Krefeld, Germany, relieving the 102nd Infantry Division on 3 April and assuming responsibility for containing the western side of the Ruhr Pocket from positions along the Rhine. With the reduction of the pocket in mid-April, the division was assigned military government duties, first in the Krefeld and later in the Düsseldorf areas.

By mid-April, the division relieved the 101st Airborne Division and assumed military government duties, first in the Krefeld vicinity and later around Düsseldorf. It was in that status when hostilities were declared at an end on 7 May 1945. From mid-June until the end of November, the division served the military government in Czechoslovakia.

The 94th Infantry Division was inactivated at Camp Kilmer, New Jersey on 9 February 1946.

==Cold War==
===94th Infantry Division===
The division was reactivated in the United States Army Reserve in 1956. On 14 May of that year, the &quot;9/4&quot; shoulder sleeve insignia was rescinded, and the former Puritan shoulder sleeve insignia (with a minor change in the design) was reinstated.

===94th Command Headquarters (Divisional)===
The division was redesignated the 94th Command Headquarters (Divisional) on 16 October 1963, and was deactivated in 1967 as part of the compromise between U.S. Secretary of Defense Robert S. McNamara who wanted to merge the Army Reserve into the Army National Guard, and the United States Congress who wanted to maintain the Army Reserve as it then existed. Under the compromise plan, all of the combat divisions and most separate combat brigades of the Army Reserve were deactivated with a corresponding increase in the National Guard; at the same time, non-divisional combat support and combat service support units were reallocated in the Army Reserve.

===94th Army Reserve Command===

Under the aforementioned compromise plan agreed to by the Congress and the Defense Department, the fourteen area corps were deactivated; in their place, eighteen army reserve commands (&quot;ARCOMs&quot;) were established. Commanded by a reserve major general, each ARCOM served as a regional non-tactical peacetime headquarters for unrelated support units. Each ARCOM was, in turn, assigned to one of five continental U.S. armies (&quot;CONUSAs&quot;) under Continental Army Command (&quot;CONARC&quot;). On 22 April 1968, the number and shoulder-sleeve insignia of the former 94th Division were re-allocated to the new 94th U.S. Army Reserve Command (&quot;ARCOM&quot;), headquartered at Hanscom Air Force Base, Massachusetts and subordinate to First United States Army.

Two company-level units within the 94th ARCOM served in the Vietnam War: Headquarters &amp; Headquarters Company, 513th Maintenance Battalion (Direct Support); and the 241st Military Intelligence Detachment.

94th ARCOM units participated annually in Exercise REFORGER (from REturn of FORces to GERmany) and Operation Bright Star throughout the Cold War. These exercises were intended to ensure that NATO and the United States military had the ability to quickly deploy forces to West Germany and Egypt in the event of a conflict with the Soviet Union.

In 1980, the peacetime Army Reserve chain of command was overlaid with a CAPSTONE wartime trace. In an expansion of the roundout and affiliation program begun ten years earlier, CAPSTONE purported to align every Army Reserve unit with the active and reserve component units with which they were anticipated to deploy. Units maintained lines of communication with the units—often hundreds or thousands of miles away in peacetime—who would presumably serve above or below them in the event of mobilization. This communication, in some cases, extended to coordinated annual training opportunities.

Many of the 94th&#x27;s units and individual soldiers rotated through Honduras in the 1980s. Operation Fuertes Caminos (&quot;strong roads&quot;) provided villagers with roads on which to move their crops to market, while providing invaluable real-world training and experience to reserve engineers, medical personnel, logisticians and others.

Operation Nordic Shield was held in the summer of 1987. Units of the 94th ARCOM; principally the 187th Infantry Brigade (Separate), the 167th Support Group (Corps) and their subordinate battalions and companies; deployed to Canadian Forces Base Gagetown in southern New Brunswick, to simulate the defense of Iceland against Warsaw Pact forces, the CAPSTONE mission of both the 187th and 167th.

Units under the 94th Army Reserve Command participated in a series of mobilization exercises in the 1980s, including the Selected Reserve Call-Up (23–25 October 1987), Golden Thrust &#x27;88 (November 1988), and Proud Eagle 90 (12 October through 2 November 1989). Each of these was designed to evaluate not only the units&#x27; ability to prepare to mobilize, but to examine the mobilization processes, systems, and logistical coordination so as to find and correct the unanticipated flaws.

In 1990–1991, over 1,000 soldiers from the 94th ARCOM served overseas in support of Operation Desert Shield and Desert Storm. Despite the commonly held belief that CAPSTONE traces were set in stone, the process of selecting units to mobilize and deploy largely ignored CAPSTONE.

==Post Cold War==
===94th Regional Support Command===

The ARCOM&#x27;s Puritan shoulder sleeve insignia reverted again to the &quot;9/4&quot; design on 27 November 1991.

Operation Nordic Shield II was held in the summer of 1992. As they did five years before, units of the 94th ARCOM; principally the 187th Infantry Brigade (Separate), the 167th Support Group (Corps) and their subordinate battalions and companies; deployed to Canadian Forces Base Gagetown in southern New Brunswick, to simulate the defense of Iceland against Warsaw Pact forces, the CAPSTONE mission of both the 187th and 167th. Part of the 1992 exercise included lanes training as part of the United States Army Forces Command&#x27;s &quot;Bold Shift&quot; initiative to reinforce unit war-fighting task proficiency.

In 1995, the 94th ARCOM was redesignated the 94th Regional Support Command (RSC) and moved from Hanscom Air Force Base to Fort Devens, Massachusetts.

The 94th RSC deployed soldiers to Honduras and Guatemala in 1999 in support of Operation New Horizon, and later to the Balkans in support of Operation Joint Guardian and Operation Joint Forge. Continuing with Operation New Horizon, the command deployed members of the 94th Military Police Company to Rambala-Bocas del Toro, Panama in spring 2007.

==Global War on Terror==
After 11 September 2001, the 94th RSC deployed soldiers in support of Operations Noble Eagle, Enduring Freedom and Iraqi Freedom. Mission areas include Continental United States (&quot;CONUS&quot;), Afghanistan, Uzbekistan, Iraq, Kuwait, the Horn of Africa and Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.

The 804th Medical Brigade, a major subordinate command of the 94th Regional Support Command, mobilized at Fort Devens and trained for combat in support of operations in Kuwait (and eventually Iraq) at Fort Drum, New York in February 2003. The 804th arrived in Kuwait in March 2003 and assumed command and control of over 4400 soldiers in five countries in support of both Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom. In mid-February 2004 the 804th arrived back at Fort Devens after successfully completing an over 12-month activation. The 804th conducted a relief-in-place/transfer-of-authority with the 8th Medical Brigade from New York City.

In December 2002, the 94th RSC moved into its final headquarters at Fort Devens, Massachusetts.

===94th Regional Readiness Command===
In August 2003, the 94th RSC was redesignated the 94th Regional Readiness Command (RRC).

At its end, the 94th Regional Readiness Command was made up of more than 6,000 citizen-soldiers serving within fifty-six units located throughout New England.

The 94th RRC mobilized and deployed over twenty units and more than 2,500 soldiers in support of the Global War on Terror.

===94th Division rebirth in the 21st century===

In September 2008, the 94th Training Division (Force Sustainment) entered &quot;carrier status&quot;, under the command of Brigadier General Mark Corson, at Ft. Lee, Virginia. The division is one of three major divisions under the umbrella of the 80th Training Command (The Army School System), the third-largest command organization in the U.S. Army Reserve.

On 17 October 2009, the 94th Training Division was reactivated, under the command of Brigadier General Karen LeDoux, at Ft. Lee, Virginia. The activation ceremony included many of the veterans of who served in the 94th Infantry Division during World War II. The event included the 3rd Infantry Regiment (The Old Guard) and its Fife and Drum Corps.

The 94th Training Division&#x27;s original red and blue colors flown by the division during World War II were returned by Army Heraldry.

==Insignia==
===Shoulder sleeve insignia (SSI)===
* Native American design: Featured a Native American with bow and arrow.
* Puritan design:
** Description: On a disc silver gray, edged with a black border, depicting the black silhouette of a Puritan carrying a flintlock blunderbuss on his shoulder. (This insignia was derisively referred to by some as the &quot;Puking Pilgrim&quot;.)
** Symbolism: Being organized in New England, the armed Puritan symbolized colonial era militiamen who were the figurative (and, in some cases, literal) ancestors of the division&#x27;s soldiers. 
* &quot;9/4&quot; design:
** Description: a black Arabic numeral &quot;9&quot; on the silver gray and a silver gray Arabic numeral &quot;4&quot; on the black. The diameter is .
** Symbolism: The insignia represents the numerical designation of the unit.
* Background:
** A design featuring a Native American with bow and arrow was authorized for the 94th Division on 21 July 1922.
** The above design was superseded by approval of the design of a Puritan carrying a blunderbuss on his shoulder on 6 September 1923.
** The above approval was amended to change the wording of the description on 22 December 1923.
** The Puritan design was superseded by design featuring the Arabic numerals &quot;9&quot; and &quot;4&quot; on 5 September 1942.
** The &quot;9/4&quot; design was rescinded (canceled) on 14 May 1956. The same letter reinstated the Puritan shoulder sleeve insignia, with a minor change in the design, for the 94th Infantry Division.
** The Puritan design was redesignated for the 94th Command Headquarters (Divisional) on 16 October 1963.
** The Puritan design was authorized for the 94th Army Reserve Command on 22 April 1968.
** The Puritan design was rescinded (canceled) on 27 November 1991. The same letter reinstated the &quot;9/4&quot; design.
** The insignia was redesignated effective 16 July 2003 for the 94th Regional Readiness Command.

===Distinctive unit insignia (DUI)===
* Description: A gold color metal and enamel device, high overall, consisting of a nonagon divided diagonally from lower left to upper right, the upper area light gray and the lower area black, bearing overall a blue oblong with long axis vertical, charged with a gold silhouette of the bust of a Puritan with flintlock blunderbuss on his shoulder.
* Symbolism: The diagonally divided gray and black background refers to the shoulder sleeve insignia worn by the 94th Infantry Division during World War II, and by the 94th ARCOM/RSC/RRC in 1991–2009. The geometric four-sided figure commemorates the four European campaign honors. Blue is the color used for infantry. The bust of the Puritan with flintlock blunderbuss is from the shoulder sleeve insignia worn during the period 1923–1942 and 1956–1991. It represents the history and traditions of the area with which past and present organizations have always identified. The nine sides of the device and the four sides of the oblong also allude to the numerical designation of the unit.
* Background: The distinctive unit insignia was originally authorized for the 94th U.S. Army Reserve Command on 4 June 1970. It was reassigned and authorized for 94th U.S. Army Regional Support Command on 16 April 1996. The insignia was redesignated effective 16 July 2003 for the U.S. Army 94th Regional Readiness Command.

==Nicknames==
* &quot;Pilgrim Division&quot; (pre-World War II)
* &quot;Neuf-Cats&quot; (official, derived from the French &quot;neuf quatre&quot;, meaning &quot;nine four&quot;)
* &quot;Patton&#x27;s Golden Nugget&quot; (unofficial while assigned to Third U.S. Army in 1945)
* &quot;Roosevelt&#x27;s Bloody Butchers&quot; (unofficial German nickname)

==Legacy==
* Until the re-merger of the division&#x27;s and division HHC&#x27;s lineages with those of the reserve command and reserve command HHC, only the Londonderry, New Hampshire-based 94th Military Police Company, retained direct lineage to the 94th Infantry Division&#x27;s organic structure.
* In 1963, a separate infantry brigade was organized in the US Army Reserve using the lineage of the division&#x27;s 1st Brigade. As a separate brigade, however, it was granted its own shoulder sleeve insignia. The 187th Infantry Brigade was inactivated in 1994.
* State Highway 94 in Colorado, Connecticut, New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania are numbered after the 94th Infantry Division.
* Interstate 94 (I-94) in southwestern Michigan is named the 94th Infantry Division Highway. It runs past Fort Custer where the division was formed and trained during World War II.
*The 94th Infantry Division also has a World War II reenacting unit by the same name. The 94th Infantry Living History Alliance was formed in 2004 and has been working with the veterans and divisional histories to accurately portray the division. They are honored by the 94th Infantry veterans and alliance as being Division&#x27;s official living historians.

==Popular culture==
The movie &quot;Everyman&#x27;s War&quot; (Thad T. Smith, 2009) is about a platoon of the 94th Infantry Division near Saint-Nazaire (France) in September 1944 and during the battle of the Bulge.

<text>Twike, based in Rosenthal, is a German manufacturer of light electric vehicles in the European Union vehicle class L5e (US motorcycle).
The main product, the Twike (a portmanteau of the words &quot;twin&quot; and &quot;bike&quot;), is a human-electric hybrid vehicle (HEHV) designed to carry two passengers and cargo. Essentially a velomobile with an electrical hybrid engine, it can be driven in electric-only mode or electric + pedal power mode.

== History ==

=== Prototype by ETH Zurich ===
The Twike 1 prototype was designed by students at ETH Zurich. It was developed for the 1986 EXPO in Vancouver . The tricycle, initially conceived in Switzerland, was originally designed as a pure velomobile without motor assistance. Inspired by the success of the Twike I, a group of enthusiasts began developing the second generation as a step towards a vehicle for everyday road use.

=== Twike 2 with electric motor ===
In order to be able to compete with other cars in everyday use, a prototype with electric assistance was developed and presented to the public in 1991 as the Twike II. In 1992, Twike AG, based in Gelterkinden, Switzerland, was founded to bring the prototype to series production. It was developed in collaboration with Alusuisse-Lonza Holding and shown for the first time at the HEUREKA exhibition in Zurich.

=== Series production from 1995 ===
In 1992, Twike AG decided to further develop the Twike II into a series vehicle and began looking for capital and customers. Production of the Twike III began in 1995, three years later. In the course of the first year, the reformed AG produced and sold 190 vehicles, mainly in Switzerland and Germany. In 1999, Twike AG merged with the Swiss company S-LEM AG, which was allowed to assemble the Twike itself from 1997, to form SwissLEM AG, based in Hochdorf, Switzerland.

=== FINE Mobile from 1998 ===
In 1998, FINE Mobile GmbH (&quot;Forum für Intelligente und Nachhaltige Elektro-Mobile&quot;) was founded, initially based in Augsburg. The aim of the shareholders was to be the general importer for Germany. In the same year, FINE Mobile also launched the German production line. Kits imported from Switzerland were finally assembled in Germany. One reason for this was the German approval regulations, which required, for example, a laminated glass windshield, while the Swiss series was equipped with Plexiglas. 

=== Twike GmbH ===
When SwissLEM went bankrupt in the summer of 2002, FINE Mobile took over the production and brand rights for the Twike. In 2002, the company headquarters were also relocated from Augsburg to Rosenthal. Since then, FINE Mobile GmbH from Rosenthal has been the rights holder and sole producer of the Twike worldwide. At the beginning of 2020, FINE Mobile GmbH changed its name to TWIKE GmbH.

== Products ==

=== Twike 1 ===
The Twike 1 is a two-seater bicycle with a body. The ergonomic and aerodynamic experiment was developed by Swiss students at ETH Zurich. The idea was presented at the EXPO in Vancouver in 1986. The concept is based on a recumbent bike in which two people pedal side by side. The first Twike model was purely muscle-powered and not electrified. It weighed 50 kg and could be accelerated to a speed of up to 50 km/h. In 1986, it won an award for ergonomics at the World Expo in Vancouver.

=== Twike 2 ===

The Twike 2 was introduced in 1991. It had a belt pedal drive with continuously variable mechanical transmission and a DC motor powered by NiCd batteries to drive the vehicle. With the support of an electric motor, the hybrid model&#x27;s suitability for everyday use was significantly improved.

=== Twike 3 ===
The Twike 3 has been built almost unchanged since its development was completed in 1995. Only minor modifications have been made to the body, interior and batteries since then. Since the start of construction, well over 1,000 vehicles have been built by hand. Due to the constant improvement in battery capacity during the construction period, the range of the Twike 3 has increased from around 60 km initially to over 610 km recently.

==== Gallery Twike 3 ====
===== Construction =====
The Twike 3 is essentially a velomobile constructed from lightweight materials such as aluminum (frame) and plastic (shell) with an electric drive. The light electric vehicle of the EU vehicle class L5e can be operated either purely electrically or additionally with pedal power to increase the range. The platform of the three-wheel design corresponds to the basic shape of a &quot;delta&quot; with a (steerable) front wheel and a rear axle with two wheels and is designed to carry two people plus freight. Both the engine and batteries, the luggage compartment and a large part of the weight of the people being transported are placed on the rear axle with a low center of gravity. This results in favorable tipping stability. The hood of the Twike 3 serves as an additional roll bar and carries the laminated glass window (subject to registration in Germany) or a lighter Plexiglas window and the removable convertible or targa top.

===== Operating =====
The Twike 3 is steered using a sidestick (steering lever) between the seats. Two two-stage buttons on the sidestick are used for acceleration and braking, including recuperation. A control panel in the middle of the cab contains the controls for the headlights, rear fog light, hazard warning lights, windshield heating fan, on/off switch and the on-board computer. To the left of the driver is the handbrake lever with further integrated controls: High beam, windshield wipers and horn. To get in, the hood is raised forwards, supported by a gas spring. Acceleration and braking are controlled by two two-stage buttons on the right-hand steering lever. For emergency braking and for stopping or parking, the driver operates the pedal system using the back pedal. In addition to extending the range, the switchable pedal drive also has a fitness function.

===== Motor =====
For propulsion, the Twike 3 has a three-phase electric motor with a rated output of 3 kW and a peak output of up to 9 kW. The two rear wheels are driven directly by a motor via a differential gear. This enables the vehicle to reach a speed of 85 km/h on level ground. A pedal drive is installed for the driver and passenger. It can be operated independently of each other, but is not necessary for propulsion. The pedal assistance is designed for speeds of up to 70 km/h as standard. On some models, the gear ratio is increased so that you can pedal comfortably even at top speed. Acceleration from a standstill using muscle power is not intended and can only be achieved with intensive effort, even on flat terrain.

===== Power supply =====
Battery technology has made considerable progress since the Twike was launched. The Twike 3 initially used NiCd batteries, later Li-Mn. The introduction of Li-ion batteries in the 2008 model year represented a major leap forward in terms of range and cycle stability. The Twike was the first series-produced vehicle in the world to use Li-ion batteries. The Twike 3 was last produced with lithium-ion batteries in five performance classes. The smallest battery unit delivers 3.53 kWh with a range of more than 80 km and the largest 24.7 kWh with a range of up to 613 km. The battery can be charged at a conventional household socket, but also at a public charging station. The energy is also recovered during the journey through regenerative braking, and the electric system is relieved by the pedal system, which transfers its power directly to the drivetrain. Both systems work in parallel and not in series.

===== Consumption and range =====
The weight of the Twike 3 is 240-350 kilograms. Depending on the battery and driving style, the range is between 40 and 613 km with a consumption of around 4 to 7 kWh/100 km. This corresponds to 14.4-25.2 megajoules/100 km. The significantly lower energy consumption compared to the combustion engine is due to the much higher efficiency of the electric drive, the aerodynamically favorable design with a small cross-sectional area and the lightweight construction (aluminum, plastic). The moderate top speed and regenerative braking also have a positive effect on the Twike 3&#x27;s fuel consumption. In 2020, the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) carried out a fuel consumption comparison of various electric vehicles registered in the USA. The Tesla Model 3 Long Range AWD, model year 2021, was ranked first in the table with a consumption of 25 kWh / 100 miles (equivalent to 15.5 kWh / 100 km). The 25-year-old technology of the Twike 3 undercuts this value by at least half.

=== Twike 4 ===
To further develop the basic concept of the Twike 3, the Twike 4, initially under the name TW4XP (&quot;Threewheeler for X Prize&quot;), has been developed and tested since 2009. The exterior and interior are very different from its predecessor. The Twike 4 is steered with two sidesticks by pulling back and forth. It has pedals that act as a foot brake. The aim of the completely new development was to significantly improve the Twike in terms of performance, riding characteristics and comfort. The Twike 4 never went into series production, but as a prototype it came third out of 136 teams at the Automotive X Prize in the USA in 2010. A former BMW engineer advised on the chassis, while the software and the electric vehicle architecture were developed by EDAG in Fulda. The Twike 4 has been optimized for use at 120 km/h on the highway.

==== Gallery Twike 4 ====
=== Twike 5 ===
A frame concept of the Twike 5 was first presented at the Geneva Motor Show in 2019. In contrast to the Twike 4, which was intended as a prototype from the outset, the 5 model is being developed for series production. Overall, the aim is to create a vehicle with a top speed of 190 km/h that is more similar to a conventional car in terms of driving comfort and safety. The similarities with the Twike 3 are limited to the EU vehicle class and the possibility of reducing the vehicle&#x27;s energy consumption through muscular assistance, apart from the delta suspension. Instead of a direct pedal drive with a chain, a pedal generator (300 watts, standard on the driver&#x27;s side, optional on the passenger&#x27;s side) is used. 
==== Construction ====
Development of the Twike 5 began in 2015 with the aim of taking a leading role in short-distance transportation in the automotive market. The lightweight electric vehicle combines a recumbent bike, e-bike and e-car and consists of a modular safety cell with an aluminum frame and roll bar made of high-strength steel. It is to be encased in natural fiber-reinforced plastic. In comparison to the Twike 3, the batteries, as in the Zwike 4, move from the rear as a space-saving floor plate under the seats. This results in a lower center of gravity. The optimum tipping stability of the tricycle has been improved and, with a vehicle width of 1.55 m, is at its optimum and corresponds to that of a sports car. In addition, the 5 Series has a new hood concept, is 100 kg lighter and has a double trailing arm swing arm with wheel bearing flange for classic car rims on the front axle. The rear axle is equipped with a twistable DeDion composite suspension with stabilizer bar.

==== Operating ====
An important innovation is the new steering system with acceleration rocker introduced on the Twike 4, including a 2-stage push button for acceleration and electric braking. Two mechanically connected sidesticks are used for steering. It corresponds to the principle of cable steering. If the left hand pulls the lever backwards, the Twike 5 moves to the left. If the right hand pulls the lever, the Twike 5 moves to the right. The speed can be changed continuously on both levers of the steering system. Cruise control, controls for indicators, lights, windshield wipers and a scroll and select function for the screen are also integrated into the handles. A driving license for the old class B or the new class A1 is required for the vehicle.

==== Motor ====
The main drive is provided by a 70 kilowatt synchronous motor with reduction gearbox and rear-wheel drive. According to the manufacturer, the drive reaches a speed of up to 190 km/h in the largest battery configuration. Simulated acceleration from 0 to 100 km/h takes the vehicle a minimum of 3.8 seconds. Up to 20 percent at city speeds can be achieved by pedaling.

==== Power supply ====
The Twike 5 is available in two sizes. The lithium-ion battery modules vary between 18 and 36 kWh. In addition to a one-hour charge at a DC charging station, a discharged battery can also be charged within 10 hours using a household plug. In addition, braking energy is fed back into the battery during operation. The &quot;Human Power Hybrid&quot; concept provides for electricity to be generated through active pedaling and to flow directly into the battery.

==== Consumption and range ====
The company offers the TWIKE 5 model in two variants with different battery sizes. Although the same motor is installed in all models, the battery size influences the range and performance. The 18 kWh battery size has a range of over 250 km. With the 36 kWh variant, a range of over 500 km will be possible. The driver can increase the range manually using the built-in pedals.

<text>The Assembly were a British synth-pop project formed in 1983 in Basildon, England, by Vince Clarke (songwriting, keyboards, backing vocals) and Eric Radcliffe (songwriting, production).

Feargal Sharkey was hired as a guest vocalist for the A-side of the duo&#x27;s only single, &quot;Never Never&quot;. Clarke and Radcliffe had planned to use a different singer on each track the duo recorded, but the duo disbanded after the release of &quot;Never Never&quot;.

==Band history==
Clarke founded the Assembly shortly after disbanding Yazoo (featuring vocalist Alison Moyet), upon completion and distribution of Yazoo&#x27;s 1983 album, &quot;You and Me Both&quot;.

The Assembly marked the most involved phase of Clarke&#x27;s long-term professional relationship with sound engineer Radcliffe, who had contributed significant influences to the recordings of Clarke&#x27;s previous bands, Depeche Mode and Yazoo. However, the Assembly project never became a full-fledged band and resulted in only one single release, the UK hit &quot;Never Never&quot;. It featured a sampled guitar track triggered note for note on a Fairlight CMI. The sound was augmented by session musician Clem Clempson on electric guitar.

Former Undertones frontman Feargal Sharkey was hired to sing on this track. Clarke and Radcliffe had planned to use a different singer on each track the group recorded, but none were released after &quot;Never Never&quot;.

The other track on the single, &quot;Stop/Start&quot;, was an instrumental, featuring Clarke&#x27;s signature songwriting style with syncopation that gradually became the downbeat of the musical phrase.

Despite the commercial success of the single, the Assembly was no longer a functioning entity by the end of 1984. Clarke went on to form Erasure with vocalist and co-songwriter Andy Bell in 1985. Although Erasure worked with Radcliffe on some of their early work, they eventually began working with other producers and engineers, including Flood. Sharkey, for his part, began a successful solo career in 1984, and achieved his only UK number one single in 1985 with &quot;A Good Heart&quot;.

&quot;Never Never&quot; was re-released on CD single in 1996 with four tracks, containing both the normal and extended versions of both the title song, and &quot;Stop/Start&quot;. The music video for &quot;Never Never&quot;, filmed at Upminster Windmill in the London Borough of Havering, was featured on the first &quot;Now That&#x27;s What I Call Music!&quot; video in 1983, though it did not feature on the corresponding compilation album.

==Reunion==
In May 2011, Sharkey appeared on stage during the Erasure set at Mute Records&#x27; Short Circuit music festival for a one-off performance of &quot;Never, Never&quot; with Clarke.

<doc id="910628" wikidata="Q888219" url="?curid=910628" title="Bob Roberts">
<text>Bob Roberts is a 1992 American satirical mockumentary film written, directed by, and starring Tim Robbins. It depicts the rise of Robert &quot;Bob&quot; Roberts Jr., a right-wing politician who is a candidate for an upcoming United States Senate election. Roberts is well financed, due mainly to past business dealings, and is well known for his folk music, which presents conservative ideas with gusto. Many of the scenes mimic scenes from &quot;Dont Look Back&quot;.

The film is Robbins&#x27; directorial debut and is based on a short segment of the same title, featuring the same character that Robbins portrayed on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;. It marked Jack Black&#x27;s film debut.

==Plot==
&quot;Bob Roberts&quot; takes place in Pennsylvania in 1990. It depicts a fictitious senatorial race between a conservative Republican folk singer, Bob Roberts, and the incumbent Democrat, Brickley Paiste. The film is shot through the perspective of Terry Manchester, a British documentary filmmaker who is following the Roberts campaign. Through Manchester&#x27;s lens we see Roberts travel across the state and sing about drug users, lazy people and the triumph of traditional family values and laissez-faire capitalism over the rebelliousness and social justice causes of the 1960s. Even though the Roberts campaign team officially avoids manifestations of open bigotry, their songs, speech and mannerisms are rife with snobbish dog whistles and racist and sexist innuendos, and Manchester&#x27;s footage reveals casual use of homophobic slurs.

Complementing Manchester&#x27;s neutral perspective are reflections by Senator Paiste, TV anchor Kelly Noble and investigative reporter Bugs Raplin, among others. Paiste is convinced that Roberts is a master manipulator linked to the National Security Council, the CIA and the military–industrial complex. Throughout the campaign, Raplin attempts to use the documentary being made about Roberts to expose him to the public as a fraud. Raplin believes that Roberts&#x27; anti-drug charity, Broken Dove, is connected to an old CIA drug trafficking scheme, citing Roberts&#x27; campaign chairman Lukas Hart III&#x27;s past in the Phoenix Program as proof. Shortly after an acerbic and disastrous interview with Roberts, Kelly Noble points out that his potential for success comes from subverting stereotypes by using his music, a tool of protest typical of the left during the counterculture years, as a vector for postmodern far-right politics.

As the campaign continues, Paiste remains in the lead until a scandal arises involving him and a young woman who was seen emerging from a car with him. Paiste claims that she was a friend of his granddaughter whom he was driving home, but he cannot shake the accusations. Roberts&#x27; campaign suffers a setback as well, when Raplin&#x27;s accusations briefly gain traction and result in a subpoena on Lukas Hart III for unpaid housing loans rumored to be redirected to drug trafficking.

As the election approaches, Roberts is asked to appear on a network&#x27;s sketch comedy show. When Roberts announces that he will not be playing the song he had originally proposed, a dispute breaks out between the cast and producers of the show. This new song turns out to be nothing more than a thinly veiled campaign endorsement, and an angry staff member of the network pulls the plug mid-performance. As Roberts is leaving the studio, he is seemingly shot by a would-be assassin. Raplin, who has been causing problems for the campaign, is initially linked to the shooting, but he is later cleared when it is found that due to constrictive palsy in his right hand he physically could not have fired the gun. Following the incident, Raplin contends that Roberts was never actually shot and that the gun was fired into the ground. Raplin&#x27;s allegations are not confirmed on camera by Roberts campaign member Delores Perrigrew when she is questioned by Manchester, but she does show clear signs of remorse and abruptly quits the campaign.

The campaign is boosted by public support following the assassination attempt, and Roberts wins the election with 52 percent of the vote. Although Roberts claims that his wounds have left him paralyzed from the waist down, he is seen tapping his feet at a celebration party. While Terry Manchester is interviewing Roberts&#x27; supporters outside the new senator&#x27;s hotel, a boy runs up shouting, &quot;He&#x27;s dead, he&#x27;s dead, they got him!&quot; When Manchester asks him what he is talking about, the boy shouts, &quot;Bugs Raplin! He&#x27;s dead! They got him!&quot; A joyful celebration breaks out among Roberts&#x27; supporters, the shot changes to an image of his hotel room, and an upright walking shadow suggesting Roberts&#x27; profile passes the window before the lights go out. The film ends with a radio news report about Raplin&#x27;s death at the hands of a right-wing fanatic and a shot of Manchester standing in the Jefferson Memorial, looking at the words, &quot;I have sworn upon the altar of God eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over the mind of man&quot;, inscribed there.

==Cast==
==Style==
The film&#x27;s style is drawn from a number of real and mock documentaries, and its shots are crafted to create this effect, in many cases through the use of hand-held cameras. Not only does Roberts&#x27; character draw from 1960s-era iconography of Bob Dylan, it also contains scenes inspired by the 1967 documentary, &quot;Dont Look Back&quot;, made about the singer, employing a similar cinema verité style. &quot;Bob Roberts&quot; also draws from Rob Reiner&#x27;s 1984 mockumentary &quot;This Is Spinal Tap&quot;, which Robbins states is one of his favorite films, and directly references this during the scene in which Roberts gets lost in an auditorium attempting to find the stage before his performance. In the case of Gore Vidal&#x27;s character, the majority of the lines were not scripted, and instead Vidal based his role upon his own political beliefs, and his real-life positions on many of the fictional election topics.

A soundtrack album was not released because Robbins did not wish the songs to be heard outside the context of the film.

==Reception and legacy==
On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a score of 93% based on 44 reviews, with an average rating of 7.5/10. Its consensus reads: &quot;Behind and in front of the camera, Tim Robbins delivers a landslide comedic victory with &quot;Bob Roberts&quot; – a shrewdly crackling lampoon of modern politics.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 70% based on reviews from 26 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;. Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade B+ on scale of A to F.

Roger Ebert gave the film three out of four stars, stating: &quot;I like &quot;Bob Roberts&quot; – I like its audacity, its freedom to say the obvious things about how our political process has been debased.&quot; However, Ebert also stated that the thread about the investigative journalism doesn&#x27;t work, commenting &quot;if [the film] had been only about campaign tactics and techniques, I would have liked it more.&quot;

While critics and audiences responded to this film by connecting Roberts’ character to various political figures, such as George H. W. Bush and Pennsylvania Representative and later Senator Rick Santorum, Robbins has said that the film related more to the political system in general than any specific politician. Much of Robbins&#x27; commentary addresses the role of the media in election campaigns. Some have critiqued Robbins for his approach toward political satire, stating that his references to Reagan Era politics and the rebelliousness of the 1960s are simply too anachronistic in the context of the 1990s, but others have praised it for framing political commentary as a Hollywood comedy. In 2018, Robbins said: &quot;&quot;Bob Roberts&quot; came true&quot;, referring to President Donald Trump. In July 2024, following an attempted assassination of Trump, a conspiracy theory emerged that it was staged akin to what happens in &quot;Bob Roberts&quot;. Robbins condemned the theory, writing on X: &quot;Those that are denying the assassination attempt was real are truly in a deranged mindset.&quot;

The film grossed $4.5 million in the United States and Canada and $8 million worldwide.

==Awards==
The film won the Georges Delerue Award for Best Soundtrack/Sound Design at Film Fest Gent in 1992.

<doc id="910635" wikidata="Q2448817" url="?curid=910635" title="Trans Am (band)">
<text>Trans Am is a three-piece American band from Bethesda, Maryland, that was one of the originators of &quot;post-rock&quot; in the mid-1990s. Their work combines elements of Krautrock, heavy metal, hardcore punk, synthpop, electronic music, and folk music. Since their inception, the group has toured with Tortoise, Pan Sonic, the Fucking Champs, and Tool.

==Biography==
Nathan Means (bass, keyboards, vocoder, vocals), Philip Manley (lead guitar, bass, keyboards, vocals), and Sebastian Thomson (drums, bass, keyboards, guitar, vocals) formed Trans Am in 1990 near Washington, D.C. The band started as a HarDCore project but their sound evolved as the members finished college to include additional influences, such as new wave, classic rock, and experimental rock. In 1995, they began recording their music, which until 1998 was almost entirely instrumental. Their sound is generally marked with acoustic and electronic drums, guitars, electronics, and a varying amount of often-heavily processed vocals. Instrumental virtuosity (especially on drums) is a focal point. All of their albums have been released on the Chicago-based independent record label Thrill Jockey.

Trans Am&#x27;s self-titled debut, recorded after just a few rehearsals, contained instrumentals which were largely improvised versions of simple rock-oriented motifs based loosely on 1970s bands such as Boston, Bachman–Turner Overdrive, and Yes. The album was produced by John McEntire of labelmates Tortoise at Idful Music Corporation, in Chicago. Afterwards, the band opened for Tortoise on a brief US tour.

In 1996, Trans Am released a self-titled EP, which showed a greater reliance on electronics. The group expanded that approach to album length on &quot;Surrender to the Night&quot; (1997) and &quot;The Surveillance&quot; (1998). Their sound during this period was reminiscent of such acts as Kraftwerk, Can, and New Order, interspersed with more rock-oriented material. Also in 1996, they appeared on a split 12&quot; with Wingtip Sloat. One track from that record, &quot;Starjammer&quot;, was later included on the highbrow electronica label Mille Plateaux&#x27;s double-CD compilation &quot;In Memoriam Gilles Deleuze&quot;. In their live shows, the band began to incorporate trigger devices and MIDI-wired beatboxes in order to perform their electronics-heavy songs. Around the time of the release of &quot;The Surveillance&quot;, Trans Am started to perform material with vocoder-heavy vocals by Nathan Means.

Their fourth album, &quot;Futureworld&quot;, came out in 1999. The first side of this album featured songs with vocoder and the second side had all instrumentals, including the sprightly &quot;Cocaine Computer&quot;. A music video for the title song was filmed and released. In 2000, the group followed up with the double album &quot;Red Line&quot;, recorded in their own National Recording Studio. A rarities collection, &quot;You Can Always Get What You Want&quot;, was also released that year.

In 2002, Trans Am released &quot;TA&quot;, complete with tongue-in-cheek promo photos featuring the band in boy band-esque matching white outfits. &quot;TA&quot;&#x27;s cover art was a parody of a REO Speedwagon best-of collection. Though the album was essentially a spoof of the electroclash genre, it was mostly panned by music critics.

During the 2004 U.S. election year, Trans Am released the politically charged &quot;Liberation&quot;, an album that questioned the George W. Bush presidency and addressed such issues as the 2003 invasion of Iraq, the War on Terror, and paranoia.

&quot;Sex Change&quot;, the band&#x27;s sixth studio album, was released in 2007. Following the release, Trans Am did a tour of the United States with Zombi and The Psychic Paramount, seventeen shows opening for Tool, and they played the Thrill Jockey 15th anniversary show in Chicago, Illinois.

Also in 2007, Trans Am contributed to the soundtrack of the video game &quot;After Burner: Black Falcon&quot; for the PSP.

In April 2017, Trans Am released &quot;California Hotel&quot;, an eight-song album on Thrill Jockey.

<doc id="910642" wikidata="Q5594376" url="?curid=910642" title="Grand Canyon of the Tuolumne">
<text>The Grand Canyon of the Tuolumne is the notable canyon section of the river valley of the Tuolumne River, located within Yosemite National Park, in Tuolumne County and the Sierra Nevada, California.

As defined by the United States Geological Survey, the canyon begins at Glen Aulin and ends directly above Hetch Hetchy Valley.

==Geography==
The Grand Canyon of the Tuolumne starts at Glen Aulin, immediately below the confluence of Cold Canyon, Conness Creek, and the Tuolumne River. Here, the valley walls pull away from each other and become steeper. The water meanders and forms deep pools.
After the waterfall that marks the end of Glen Aulin, the canyon becomes deeper again, and roughly V-shaped in cross section. The walls are not as steep and bare as those of Yosemite Valley. The flora of the valley bottom is a haphazard melange of chaparral, manzanita scrub and oak woodland characteristic of the foothills and lowlands with a coniferous forest reminiscent of (but different from) that found above the canyon rim. This vegetation clings and clambers up every ledge of the valley walls to the top, giving it a lusher appearance than Yosemite Valley, though this area in fact experiences a drier climate.

Many dramatic waterfalls are found in the Grand Canyon of the Tuolumne. Whereas Yosemite Valley&#x27;s celebrated falls occur on tributary streams along the sides, these lie on the main river itself. Many watercourses do join the Tuolumne River, but their canyons form deep clefts in the sides of the Grand Canyon and descend to its bottom. The Tuolumne&#x27;s own bed, beginning even above Glen Aulin, is fashioned as a great staircase punctuated by waterfalls.

Perhaps the greatest of these is Waterwheel Falls, named for a dramatic circular plume of water that appears when the river and the winds run high. A few kilometres below Glen Aulin, the walls of the lower canyon pinch together to form a narrow chasm of less than in length, the Muir Gorge. A short way below the Muir Gorge, the Grand Canyon widens again, much as it does at Glen Aulin, though here it is deeper. This broad plain bears the name of &quot;Pate Valley.&quot; Some below here, Hetch Hetchy Reservoir (created by O’Shaughnessy Dam) claims the Tuolumne River.

==Recreation==
A trail runs along the Tuolumne River from its headwaters to below Pate Valley (though it leaves the valley floor for some time to avoid the impassable Muir Gorge). It is diligently built, but due to the nature of the terrain it is often rocky, steep and generally difficult. The walking distance from the Tioga Road to the Glen Aulin High Sierra Camp is roughly . White Wolf campground, southeast of Hetch Hetchy Reservoir, is within day-hiking distance of the canyon rim, but the return trip from the very bottom is long and steep. Between the eastern tip of the reservoir and the point where the trail begins the climb to White Wolf, the valley is a trackless wilderness.

<doc id="910645" wikidata="Q208549" url="?curid=910645" title="Mediterranean monk seal">
<text>The Mediterranean monk seal (Monachus monachus) is a monk seal belonging to the family Phocidae. , it is estimated that fewer than 700 individuals survive in three or four isolated subpopulations in the Mediterranean, (especially) in the Aegean Sea, the archipelago of Madeira and the Cabo Blanco area in the northeastern Atlantic Ocean. It is believed to be the world&#x27;s rarest pinniped species. It is the only extant species in the genus Monachus.

==Description==
This species of seal grows from approximately long at birth up to an average of as adults, females slightly shorter than males. Males weigh an average of and females weigh , with overall weight ranging from . They are thought to live up to 45 years old; the average life span is thought to be 20 to 25 years old and reproductive maturity is reached at around age four.

The monk seals&#x27; pups are about long and weigh around , their skin being covered by 1–1.5 centimeter-long, dark brown to black hair. On their bellies, there is a white stripe, which differs in color and shape between the two sexes. In females the stripe is usually rectangular in shape whereas in males it is usually butterfly shaped. This hair is replaced after six to eight weeks by the usual short hair adults carry. Adults will continue to molt annually, causing their color vibrancy to change throughout the year.

Pregnant Mediterranean monk seals typically use inaccessible undersea caves while giving birth, though historical descriptions show they used open beaches until the 18th century. There are eight pairs of teeth in both jaws.

Believed to have the shortest hair of any pinniped, the Mediterranean monk seal fur is black (males) or brown to dark grey (females), with a paler belly, which is close to white in males. The snout is short broad and flat, with very pronounced, long nostrils that face upward, unlike their Hawaiian relative, which tend to have more forward nostrils. The flippers are relatively short, with small slender claws. Monk seals have two pairs of retractable abdominal teats, unlike most other pinnipeds.

===Reproduction===
Very little is known of this seal&#x27;s reproduction. As of 2020, it is thought that there are roughly 500 pairs of monk seals remaining in the world. Scientists have suggested that they are polygynous, with males being very territorial where they mate with females. Although there is no breeding season since births take place year-round, there is a peak in September, October, and November. Although mating will take place in the water, females will give birth and care for the pups on beaches or underwater caves. The use of underwater caves may have begun in order to make predatory actions almost impossible as these caves are difficult to access. Because they will stay with the pups to nurse and protect, they use their stored fat reserves to nurse. Data analysis indicates that only 29% of pups born between September and January survive. One cause of this low survival rate is the timing of high surf around the areas of breeding, creating a threat to young pups. As well, if a female determines that her environment is not a safe one, she can initiate an abortion, indirectly lowering the population. Because of smaller populations there is an increase in genetic events such as inbreeding and lack of genetic variation. During other months of the year, pups have an estimated survival rate of 71%.

In 2008, lactation was reported in an open beach, the first such record since 1945, which could suggest the seal could begin feeling increasingly safe to return to open beaches for breeding purposes in Cabo Blanco.

Pups make first contact with the water two weeks after their birth and are weaned at around 18 weeks of age; females caring for pups will go off to feed for an average of nine hours. Most female individuals are believed to reach maturity at four years of age unto which they will begin to breed. Males begin to breed at age six. The gestation period lasts close to a year. However, it is believed to be common among monk seals of the Cabo Blanco colony to have a gestation period lasting slightly longer than a year.

==Diet==
Mediterranean monk seals are diurnal and feed on a variety of fish and mollusks, primarily octopus, squid, and eels, up to 3 kg per day. Although they commonly feed in shallow coastal waters, they are also known to forage at depths up to 250 meters, with an average depth varying between specimens. Monk seals prefer hunting in wide-open spaces, enabling them to use their speed more effectively. They are successful bottom-feeding hunters; some have even been observed lifting slabs of rock in search of prey.

==Habitat==

The habitat of this pinniped has changed over the years. In ancient times, and up until the 20th century, Mediterranean monk seals had been known to congregate, give birth, and seek refuge on open beaches. In more recent times, they have left their former habitat and now only use sea caves for these activities. Often these caves are inaccessible to humans. Frequently their caves have underwater entries, and many caves are positioned along remote or rugged coastlines.

Scientists have confirmed this is a recent adaptation, most likely due to the rapid increase in human population, tourism, and industry, which have caused increased disturbance by humans and the destruction of the species&#x27; natural habitat. Because of these seals&#x27; shy nature and sensitivity to human disturbance, they have slowly adapted to try to avoid contact with humans completely within the last century, and, perhaps, even earlier. The coastal caves are, however, dangerous for newborns, and are causes of major mortality among pups when sea storms hit the caves.

==Distribution and status== 
The Mediterranean monk seal can be found in the Mediterranean Sea off of Croatia, Cyprus, Greece, and Turkey, as well as the North Atlantic Ocean off of Mauritania and Western Sahara. It may be locally-extinct (extirpated) in and around Albania, Corsica, Egypt, France, Italy, Libya, Malta, Monaco, Montenegro, southern Spain (and the Balearic Islands), and Tunisia. Its status in Algeria, Israel, Lebanon, Morocco and Syria is unknown.

This earless seal&#x27;s historical range extended from the northern Atlantic coastline of Western Africa east to the Black Sea, including all offshore islands within the Mediterranean, the Canary Islands, Madeira, Desertas, Porto Santo, and as far west as the Azores. Vagrants could be found as far south as The Gambia and the Cape Verde (Cabo Verde) islands, and as far north as Portugal to Northern Spain and the Bay of Biscay to the coast of Brittany.

Several causes provoked a dramatic population decrease over time: on one hand, commercial hunting (especially during the Roman Empire and Middle Ages) and, during the 20th century, eradication by fishermen, who used to consider it a pest due to the damage the seal causes to fishing nets when it preys on fish caught in them; and, on the other hand, coastal urbanization and pollution.

Some seals have survived in the Sea of Marmara, but the last report of a seal in the Black Sea dates to 1997. Monk seals were present at Snake Island until the 1950s, and several locations such as the and Doğankent were the last known hauling-out sites post-1990.

Nowadays, its entire population is estimated to be less than 700 individuals widely scattered, which qualifies this species as endangered. Its current very sparse population is one more serious threat to the species, as it only has two key sites that can be deemed viable. One is the Aegean Sea (250–300 animals in Greece, with the largest concentration of animals in Gyaros island, and some 100 in Turkey); the other important subpopulation is in the Atlantic Ocean, in the Western Saharan portion of Cabo Blanco (around 270 individuals which may support the small, but growing, nucleus in the Desertas Islands – approximately 30–40 individuals). There may be some individuals using coastal areas among other parts of Western Sahara, such as in Cintra Bay.

These two key sites are virtually in the extreme opposites of the species&#x27; distribution range, which makes natural population interchange between them impossible. All the other remaining subpopulations are composed of less than 50 mature individuals, many of them being only loose groups of extremely reduced size – often less than five individuals.

Other remaining populations are in southwestern Turkey and the Ionian Sea (both in the eastern Mediterranean). The species status is virtually moribund in the western Mediterranean, which still holds tiny Moroccan and Algerian populations, associated with rare sightings of vagrants in the Balearic Islands, Sardinia, and other western Mediterranean locations, including Gibraltar.

In Sardinia the Mediterranean monk seal was last sighted in May 2007 and April 2010. The increase of sightings in Sardinia suggests that the seal occasionally inhabits the Central Eastern Sardinian coasts, preserved since 1998 by the National Park of Golfo of Orosei.

Colonies on the Pelagie Islands (Linosa and Lampedusa) were destroyed by fishermen, which likely resulted in local extinction.

===Cabo Blanco 1997 die off and recovery===
Cabo Blanco, in the Atlantic Ocean, is the largest surviving single population of the species, and the only remaining site that still seems to preserve a colony structure. In the summer of 1997, more than 200 animals or two-thirds of its seal population were wiped out within two months, compromising the species&#x27; viable population. While opinions on the precise causes of this epidemic remain divided between a morbillivirus or, more likely, a toxic algae bloom, the mass die-off emphasized the precarious status of a species already regarded as critically endangered throughout its range.

Numbers in this all-important location started a slow-paced recovery ever since. A small but incipient (up to 20 animals by 2009) sub-population in the area had started using open beaches. In 2009, for the first time in centuries, a female delivered her pup on the beach (open beaches is the optimal habitat for the survival of pups, but had been abandoned due to human disturbance and persecution in past centuries).

Only by 2016 the colony had recovered to its previous population (about 300 animals). This was made possible by a recovery plan financed by Spain. Also in 2016, a new record of births was set for the colony (83 pups).

However, the threat of a similar incident, which could severely reduce or wipe out the entire population, remains.

===Recent sightings===


In June 2009, there was a report of a sighting off the island of Giglio, in Italy. 
On 7 January 2010, fishermen spotted an injured Mediterranean monk seal off the coasts of Tel Aviv, Israel. When zoo veterinarians arrived to help the seal, it had slipped back into the waters. Members of the Israel Marine Mammal Research and Assistance Center arrived at the scene and tried to locate the injured mammal, but with no success. This was the first sighting of the species in the region since Lebanese authorities claimed to have found a population of 10–20 other seals on their coasts 70 years earlier. In addition, the seal was also sighted a couple of weeks later in the northern kibbutz of Rosh Hanikra.

In April 2010, there was a report of a sighting off the island of Marettimo, in the Egadi Islands off the coast of Italy, in Trapani Province. In November 2010, a Mediterranean monk seal, supposedly aged between 10 and 20, had been spotted in Bodrum, Turkey. On 31 December 2010, the BBC Earth news reported that the MOM Hellenic Society had located a new colony of seals on a remote beach in the Aegean Sea. The exact location was not communicated so as to keep the site protected. The society was appealing to the Greek government to integrate the part of the island on which the seals live into a marine protected area.

On 8 March 2011, the BBC Earth news reported that a pup seal had been spotted on 7 February while monitoring a seal colony on an island in the southwestern Aegean Sea. Soon after, it showed signs of weakness and it was taken to a rehabilitation centre to try to save it. The aim is to release it back into the wild as soon as it is strong enough. In April 2011, a monk seal was spotted near the Egyptian coast after long absence of the species from the nation.

On 24 June 2011, the Blue World Institute of Croatia filmed an adult female underwater in the northern Adriatic, off the island of Cres and a specimen of unverified sex on 29 June 2012. On 2 May 2013 a specimen was seen on the southernmost point of Istrian peninsula near the town of Pula. On 9 September 2013, in Pula a male specimen swam to a busy beach and entertained numerous tourists for five minutes before swimming back to the open sea. In summer 2014 sightings in Pula have occurred almost daily and monk seal stayed multiple times on crowded city beaches, sleeping calm for hours just few meters away from humans. To prevent accidents and preserve monk seal, local city council acquired special educational boards and installed on city beaches. Despite clear instructions, an incident occurred with a tourist harassing a seal. The whole event was filmed. Less than a month later on 25 August 2014 this female monk seal was found dead in the Mrtvi Puć bay near Šišan, Croatia. Experts said it was natural death caused by her old age.
In 2012, a Mediterranean monk seal, was spotted in Gibraltar on the jetty of the private boat owners club at Coaling Island.

In the week of 22–28 April 2013, what is believed to have been a monk seal was viewed in Tyre, southern Lebanon; photographs have been reported among many local media. A study by the Italian Ministry of the Environment in 2013 confirmed the presence of monk seals in marine protected area in the Egadi Islands. In September and October 2013, there were a number of sightings of an adult pair in waters around RAF Akrotiri in British Sovereign Base waters in Cyprus.

In November 2014, an adult monk seal was reportedly seen inside the port of Limassol, Cyprus. A female monk seal, called Argyro by the locals, was repeatedly seen on beaches of Samos island in 2014 and 2015, and two were reported in April 2016. In 2017, Argyro was shot and killed.

On 7 April 2015, a large floating &quot;fish&quot; was reported near Raouche, Beirut in Lebanon, and collected by a local fisherman. This turned out to be the body of a female monk seal known to have been resident there for some time. Further investigations revealed that she was pregnant with a pup.

On 13 August 2015, ten monk seals were spotted in Governor&#x27;s Beach, Limassol, Cyprus.

On 6 January 2016, a monk seal climbed aboard a parked boat in Kuşadası.

On 10 April 2016, a monk seal was spotted and photographed by a group of foreign exchange students and local bio-engineers in a creek in Manavgat District in Turkey&#x27;s southern Antalya Province. According to the scientists involved in local projects to protect the animals, this was the first ever documented sighting of a monk seal swimming in a river. Possible reasons for the animal&#x27;s appearance included better opportunities for hunting, as well as higher salinity levels due to lower water levels.

On 26 April 2016, two monk seals were spotted at the municipal baths area of Paphos, Cyprus.

On 18 October 2016, a monk seal was captured on video around Gulf of Kuşadası.

On 3 November 2016, a monk seal was spotted at the coast of Gialousa in Cyprus.

On 13 June 2017, a specimen was spotted and photographed by a group of fishermen off the coasts of Tricase in the south of Italy.

In early 2018 a mother and her pup were spotted around Paphos Harbour in Cyprus.

In November 2018, a young monk seal was spotted at the coast of Karavostasi in Cyprus, only to be found dead at the same area a few days later.

On 15 March 2019, a monk seal was spotted and photographed by a group of citizens at a marina in Kuşadası.

On 20 July 2019, a monk seal was spotted in Protaras bay area in Cyprus.

On 27 January 2020, a young monk seal was recovered dead from Torre San Gennaro in Apulia.

On 15 December 2020, a monk seal was spotted and videotaped while seated on a sunlounger in Samos Island, Greece.

On 24 July 2021, a previously rescued and rehabilitated monk seal nicknamed &quot;Kostis&quot; was found dead in the waters of the Cycladic islands. MOm, the Hellenic Society for the Study and Protection of the Monk Seal reported that the seal had been executed at close range with a spear gun. Additionally, MOm pledged a €18,000 bounty for any evidence that &quot;will lead to the arrest of the person(s) responsible for the killing of the seal, known as Kostis.&quot;

On 24 April 2023, a large monk seal was spotted at Korakonisi, Zakynthos in Greece. It stayed on the surface for around a minute observing onlookers and then dived and was not seen again on that day.

On 12 May 2023, a healthy adult female monk seal was observed and photographed resting for at least a few hours on the beach in Jaffa near Tel Aviv, Israel. Israel&#x27;s Nature and Park Authority has been monitoring since then this seal dubbed &quot;Yulia&quot;, estimated at twenty years of age, spotted by eastern Mediterranean researchers in recent years in Turkey and Lebanon, where she is known as &quot;Tugra&quot;. International consultation assessed that she is in normal molt to shed her winter coat, mostly relaxing on the section of beach that has been fenced off for her, and occasionally going into the water.

On 5th of July 2024, a monk seal was spotted in Malta after an absence of 30 years.

==Preservation==

Damage inflicted on fishermen&#x27;s nets and rare attacks on offshore fish farms in Turkey and Greece are known to have pushed local people towards hunting the Mediterranean monk seal, but mostly out of revenge, rather than population control. Preservation efforts have been put forth by civil organizations, foundations, and universities in both countries since as early as the 1970s. For the past 10 years, many groups have carried out missions to educate locals on damage control and species preservation. Reports of positive results of such efforts exist throughout the area.

In the Aegean Sea, Greece has allocated a large area for the preservation of the Mediterranean monk seal and its habitat. The Greek Alonissos Marine Park, that extends around the Northern Sporades islands, is the main action ground of the Greek MOm organisation. MOm is greatly involved in raising awareness in the general public, fundraising for the helping of the monk seal preservation cause, in Greece and wherever needed. Greece is currently investigating the possibility of declaring another monk seal breeding site as a national park and also has integrated some sites in the NATURA 2000 protection scheme. The legislation in Greece is very strict towards seal hunting, and in general, the public is very much aware and supportive of the effort for the preservation of the Mediterranean monk seal.

The complex politics concerning the covert opposition of the Greek government towards the protection to the monk seals in the eastern Aegean in the late 1970s is described in a book by William Johnson. Oil companies apparently may have been using the monk seal sanctuary project as a stalking horse to encourage greater cooperation between the Greek and Turkish governments as a preliminary to pushing for oil extraction rights in a geopolitically unstable area. According to Johnson, the Greek secret service, the YPEA, were against such moves and sabotaged the project to the detriment of both the seals and conservationists, who, unaware of such covert motivations, sought only to protect the species and its habitat.

One of the largest groups among the foundations concentrating their efforts towards the preservation of the Mediterranean monk seal is the Mediterranean Seal Research Group (Turkish: &quot;Akdeniz Foklarını Araştırma Grubu&quot;) operating under the Underwater Research Foundation (Turkish: &quot;Sualtı Araştırmaları Derneği&quot;) in Turkey (also known as SAD-AFAG). The group has taken initiative in joint preservation efforts together with the Foça municipal officials, as well as phone, fax, and email hotlines for sightings.

Preservation of the species requires both the preservation of land and sea, due to the need for terrestrial haul-out sites and caves or caverns for the animal to rest and reproduce. Even though responsible scuba diving instructors hesitate to make trips to known seal caves, the rumor of a seal sighting quickly becomes a tourist attraction for many. Irresponsible scuba diving trips scare the seals away from caves which could become habitation for the species.

The Environment and Urbanization Minister of Turkey announced on 18 November 2019 that a plan was proposed to further preserve the species to allow the sub species of Foça, Gökova, Datça and Bozburun to increase in numbers.

==Conservation==
Under the auspices of the Convention on Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS), also known as the Bonn Convention, the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) concerning Conservation Measures for the Eastern Atlantic Populations of the Mediterranean Monk Seal was concluded and came into effect on 18 October 2007. The MoU covers four range States (Mauritania, Morocco, Portugal and Spain), all of which have signed, and aims at providing a legal and institutional framework for the implementation of the Action Plan for the Recovery of the Mediterranean Monk Seal in the Eastern Atlantic.

As there are indications of small population increases in the subpopulations, as of 2015, the Mediterranean monk seal&#x27;s IUCN conservation status has been updated from critically endangered to endangered in keeping with the IUCN&#x27;s speed-of-decline criteria.

== In culture ==
The Mediterranean monk seal occasionally appears in Classical mythology. In Homer&#x27;s &quot;The Odyssey&quot;, the sea god Proteus is shown herding monk seals for Poseidon. The mythical hero Phocus of Aegina (with &quot;phokos&quot; literally translating to seal in Greek) was the son of the nereid Psamathe, and was conceived while she was transformed into a seal. The ancient city of Phocis (and possibly Phocaea) was named after Phocus, and the city of Phocaea took on the monk seal as an emblem. This has been thought to either be due to the myth of Phocus&#x27; birth, or monk seals formerly inhabiting the area where Phocaea was established. There is only a single known surviving depiction of the monk seal from antiquity, this being on a Caeretan hydria likely created by Phocaean refugees in Etruria.

Despite its mythological connections and association with certain peoples, the monk seal still seems to have generally been reviled and feared by the ancient Greeks and Romans due to its form and smell, as well as its association with the unknown nature of the ocean. Many Greek and Roman metaphors and idioms portrayed the seal in a negative light. This antipathy may have contributed to its long-term decline in numbers by spurring persecution of the species.

On the other hand, a 2000-year-old grave with a skeleton of a Mediterranean monk seal was found during archaeological excavations in the port of Rhodes in Greece; and the seal was buried with a ritual that was used for human burials. The skeleton is now exhibited in the Aquarium of Rhodes.

In the 11th century BC, the Assyrian king Tiglath-Pileser I was gifted several animals by the Egyptian pharaoh Ramesses XI, including a crocodile and an unknown creature known as the &quot;river-man&quot;. These animals were displayed in the menagerie of his son Ashur-bel-kala, and are portrayed on several of Ashur&#x27;s obelisk fragments. A pair of hind flippers on one partial fragment has been identified with the &quot;river-man&quot;, and if so indicate that the &quot;river man&quot; was almost certainly a monk seal.

When the 1979 Mediterranean Games were organised in Split, SR Croatia, SFR Yugoslavia the mascot of the event was a Mediterranean monk seal named Adriana.

<text>Scorpio Rising is a 1963 American experimental short film shot, edited, co-written and directed by Kenneth Anger, and starring Bruce Byron as Scorpio. Loosely structured around a prominent soundtrack of 1960s pop music, it follows a group of bikers preparing for a night out.

Anger shot most of the film in New York City over the course of three months. His unique style makes extensive use of colorful non-diegetic lighting. Central themes include the occult, biker subculture, homosexuality, Christianity and Nazism. &quot;Scorpio Rising&quot; also explores the worship of rebel icons of the era, such as James Dean and Marlon Brando (referred to by Anger as Byron&#x27;s &quot;heroes&quot;, likely a direct reference to the trope of the Byronic hero).

The film premiered on October 29, 1963, at the Gramercy Arts Theater in New York City. It became the subject of protests and a lawsuit by the American Nazi Party, an obscenity prosecution overturned by the California Supreme Court, and a copyright lawsuit by the Lutheran Church. &quot;Scorpio Rising&quot; received praise from film critics and was credited with igniting leather gear and motorcycles as a fad in New York.

The film is recognized as a predecessor to the development of the modern music video and has influenced directors such as Martin Scorsese, John Waters, and Nicolas Winding Refn. In 2022, it was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

==Plot==
&quot;Scorpio Rising&quot; is structured in four parts. In &quot;Boys &amp; Bolts&quot; men work on their motorcycles. They dress themselves in leather and pose. &quot;Image Maker&quot; introduces the biker Scorpio. He gets ready to go out, and the film begins intercutting images of Jesus. &quot;Walpurgis Party&quot; shows a biker Sabbath. Their behavior escalates as they moon each other, simulate sodomy, and strip one man&#x27;s clothes off and cover his genitals in mustard. In the final part &quot;Rebel Rouser&quot;, Scorpio holds a destructive ceremony, intercut with images of Jesus, Adolf Hitler, and Nazi iconography. A biker crashes, with the final shot showing the words &quot;Blessed Blessed Oblivion&quot; tattooed on his arm.

==Production==
===Casting===

After living in Europe for several years, Anger returned to the United States, staying in Brooklyn, New York with Marie Menken and Willard Maas. He encountered a group of bikers who met at Coney Island every weekend. He got to know them by photographing their bikes.

Anger&#x27;s first choice for the lead actor was Jim Powers; however, Powers died in a car crash. Anger was in Times Square when he first met Richard MacAulay, who went by the name Bruce Byron as an homage to James Byron Dean. Byron also used his astrological sign Scorpio as a nickname, which became the name of the main character.

===Photography===

Anger spent seven days shooting Byron&#x27;s scenes. While Byron&#x27;s wife Rosemary was out of town, they filmed scenes at his apartment in Greenwich Village. He carried around an amulet with a scorpion for good luck. Byron was an ex-Marine. Byron&#x27;s home was decorated with picture of his idols, James Dean and Marlon Brando. By chance, Brando&#x27;s appearance in &quot;The Wild One&quot; was broadcast while they were filming, so Anger shot it off of the television. &quot;His favorite reading material was the comics&quot;, and Anger used images from &quot;Li&#x27;l Abner&quot;. Anger shot Byron snorting methamphetamine.

Byron and his wife attended a Halloween party in Brooklyn. Anger bought them four barrels of beer. Anger only filmed the men who attended because they didn&#x27;t want their girlfriends to be filmed. They initiated a new member by spreading mustard on his genitals. Later that night, they went to an empty, deconsecrated church. The next day, the group went up to a dirt motorcycle track near Walden Pond for their last long-distance race before winter began. One racer died on camera when his motorcycle tipped over and he broke his neck in the crash.

Anger spent three months in New York filming the bikers. He shot on Ektachrome reversal film. Anger&#x27;s design makes extensive use of non-diegetic lighting, rendering his subjects in non-natural hues for artistic effect.

In Los Angeles, Anger met a model from Bob Mizer&#x27;s Athletic Model Guild. He filmed the man in a leather jacket. &quot;This image is a conscious homage to the physique pictorial art of my friend Bob Mizer that had a physique magazine called &quot;Physique Pictorial&quot;...sort of like, deliberate, self-conscious posing.&quot;

===Post-production===
Anger edited the film while he was living in Los Angeles. According to him, one day he received a package containing a 16 mm film. He assumed it was for him until he watched it and found that it was an episode of &quot;The Living Bible&quot; titled &quot;Last Journey to Jerusalem&quot;, intended for a Sunday school class at a nearby Lutheran church. He decided to incorporate it into &quot;Scorpio Rising&quot;, tinting the footage blue. Biographer Bill Landis suggests that Anger more likely purchased the film in a camera store.

In contrast to many of his other films which use dissolves to create a dreamlike mood, Anger relies exclusively on direct cuts in &quot;Scorpio Rising&quot;. Color became an important device for structuring the film. The dominant color of the film moves from blue to red and ends with green.

Anger described his discovery of Bobby Vinton&#x27;s &quot;Blue Velvet&quot; as &quot;magick&quot;. He had music selected for rest of &quot;Boys &amp; Bolts&quot; but needed a song for the scenes where the bikers dress themselves. He turned on the radio and &quot;exercised his will&quot;, and &quot;Blue Velvet&quot; was playing. Anger decided to pay for the rights to the songs so that he could submit &quot;Scorpio Rising&quot; to film festivals. The clearance cost him $8,000, amounting to roughly half of the film&#x27;s budget.

==Music==
&quot;Scorpio Rising&quot; is considered by some to be the first drama film to feature a rock and roll soundtrack. Anger&#x27;s use of music was inspired by the experience of seeing people at Coney Island playing music out of their radios.

# Ricky Nelson – &quot;Fools Rush In (Where Angels Fear to Tread)&quot;
# Little Peggy March – &quot;Wind-Up Doll&quot;
# The Angels – &quot;My Boyfriend&#x27;s Back&quot;
# Bobby Vinton – &quot;Blue Velvet&quot;
# Elvis Presley – &quot;(You&#x27;re the) Devil in Disguise&quot;
# Ray Charles – &quot;Hit the Road Jack&quot;
# Martha and the Vandellas – &quot;(Love Is Like a) Heat Wave&quot;
# The Crystals – &quot;He&#x27;s a Rebel&quot;
# Claudine Clark – &quot;Party Lights&quot;
# Kris Jensen – &quot;Torture&quot;
# Gene McDaniels – &quot;Point of No Return&quot;
# Little Peggy March – &quot;I Will Follow Him&quot;
# The Surfaris – &quot;Wipe Out&quot;

==Release==

The film premiered on October 29, 1963, at the Gramercy Arts Theater in New York City. It was screened at the in 1963 and the International West German Short Film Festival in 1964.

When Bleecker Street Cinema in Greenwich Village switched from being a repertory cinema to a first-run theater, its first program was a double bill of &quot;Scorpio Rising&quot; and &quot;The Brig&quot; by Jonas Mekas. It continually drew large crowds, with lines around the block. Byron showed up regularly on his Harley-Davidson motorcycle and greeted attendees. Within the rising underground film scene, &quot;Scorpio Rising&quot; became the most widely distributed movie. Its popularity was credited with igniting leather gear and motorcycles as a fad in New York.

===Lawsuits===
When the film was screened at an art theater in Los Angeles, it was protested by the American Nazi Party on the basis that it insulted their flag. The police were ultimately called to the site and arrested the theater manager for public obscenity and canceled the film&#x27;s run. This happened March 7, 1964 at the Cinema Theater.

Michael Getz was arrested and charged with for screening the film. Prosecutor Warren Wolfe argued that &quot;Scorpio Rising&quot;″s homosexual content was a &quot;depiction of certain degenerate activity&quot;, and therefore obscene. He asserted that, for a few frames in the part scene, a man&#x27;s penis was visible. The judge ruled that the film was obscene, and Getz was convicted.

The case was appealed to the California Supreme Court, where the case was settled in Getz&#x27;s favor. This happened on December 19, 1964. It cost the Cinema Theater $7,000 to defend itself in court. Anger explained in an interview:

The Nazi Party sued Anger for defamation. The Lutheran Church sued him for copyright infringement, but his use was found to be fair use.

==Critical response==
&quot;Scorpio Rising&quot; was praised by West Coast critics upon its initial release. When screened in New York City in 1964, the film garnered additional positive reviews from &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, &quot;Variety&quot; and &quot;Newsweek&quot;. A 1966 review by Brendan Gill called it &quot;a strong and, despite its unpleasant subject matter, beautiful movie&quot;.

Nora Sayre of &quot;The New York Times&quot; reviewed the film in 1975 stating, &quot;Oddly enough, the references to the nineteen-fifties, which seemed dated and rather ponderous in 1965, don&#x27;t make the film appear old-fashioned now. Admittedly, one then saw it in an unfortunate context – draped in the mystique of the underground, when a number of inferior films employed some similar imagery, such as the juxtaposition of Christ and hipsters, or close-ups of all-purpose skulls. But after a decade&#x27;s education in put-ons, one can savor the impudent freshness of &quot;Scorpio&quot; today.&quot;

==Legacy==

&quot;Scorpio Rising&quot; is now recognized as a predecessor to the development of the music video. Director Martin Scorsese, having seen the film at a screening by Mekas during the mid 1960s, has cited the film as a major influence on his work. He stated that &quot;the way Anger used music in that film, in such perfectly magical harmony with the images, opened my thinking about the role music could play in movies.&quot; John Waters has similarly pointed to the use of music in &quot;Scorpio Rising&quot; as influential. Nicolas Winding Refn identified the film as an inspiration for &quot;Bronson&quot; and &quot;Drive&quot;. The title of his 2009 film &quot;Valhalla Rising&quot; is an homage to Anger&#x27;s &quot;Scorpio Rising&quot; and &quot;Lucifer Rising&quot;.

In the 2012 &quot;Sight &amp; Sound&quot; poll, the film received votes from five film critics and one director. &quot;Scorpio Rising&quot; is now part of Anthology Film Archives&#x27; Essential Cinema Repertory collection. In 2022, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

At the suggestion of Yukio Mishima, the Art Theatre Guild in Japan named Theatre Scorpio after the film.

The third album by British electronic band Death in Vegas takes its name from the film. The band asked Anger to make an accompanying film, to which he responded, &quot;I haven&#x27;t even listened to your squalid little dirge.&quot; In 2012, British indie pop band Peggy Sue released a cover album with 12 of 14 songs from the film&#x27;s soundtrack.

<text>Mohamed Benaissa (; 3 January 1937 – 28 February 2025) was a Moroccan politician who was the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Morocco from 1999 to 2007.

==Background==
Benaissa was born in Asilah, Morocco on 3 January 1937. He received a bachelor&#x27;s degree in communications from the University of Minnesota in 1963, which also awarded him an honorary doctorate in 2007.

Benaissa died on 28 February 2025, at the age of 88.

==Career==
After studying at Columbia University, Benaissa went on to serve the United Nations and the UN Food and Agriculture Organization for approximately eleven years, first as press attache to the UN Moroccan Mission in New York (1965), then as information officer at the UN headquarters in New York and in Addis Ababa (1965–1967), regional information adviser for Africa at the UN Food and Agriculture Organization in Accra, Ghana (1967–1971), communications adviser for the FAO at Rome (1961–1974), director of the information division at the same (1974–1976), and finally as Assistant-Secretary General at the UN World Food Conference (1974–1975). Benaissa returned to Morocco to become Member of Parliament for the city of Asilah from 1977 to 1983, and then Mayor of Asilah in 1984, a position to which he has been reelected three times up to 2010. From 1977 to 1985 he served as chief editor to &quot;Al Mithaq&quot; (Arabic) and &quot;Al Maghrib&quot; (French) dailies, the newspapers of the Rassemblement National des Indépendants (RNI) party to which he then belonged.

Benaissa was the Minister of Culture from 1985 to 1992, and the Moroccan Ambassador to the United States from 1993 to 1999. In April 1999, King Hassan II appointed Benaissa to the position of Minister of Foreign Affairs just three months before the former&#x27;s death. Benaissa remained in his position under Hassan&#x27;s successor, King Mohammed VI, until he was replaced by Foreign Minister Delegate Taieb Fassi Fihri in the government formed on 15 October 2007 under Prime Minister Abbas El Fassi.

==Books and recognition==
Benaissa was author (with Tahar Benjelloun) of &quot;Grains de Peau&quot; (1974) and of essays and papers on development and communications. In 1989 Asilah was recipient of the Aga Khan Award for Architecture for the urban development project. In 2010, Benaissa won the Sheikh Zayed Book Award &quot;Culture Personality of the Year&quot;, an award worth about $300,000.

==Aboubakr Jamaï defamation suit==
In April 2000, Benaissa filed a defamation lawsuit against editors Aboubakr Jamaï and Ali Amar of the Moroccan news weekly &quot;Le Journal Hebdomadaire&quot; for a 1999 series of articles alleging that Benaissa had profited from the sale of an official residence during his tenure as Ambassador to the United States. Jamaï later speculated that Benaissa &quot;was waiting for a signal&quot; to attack the papers and that he saw his opportunity following the announcement of a government ban. In 2001, the pair were found guilty, and sentenced to pay damages to Benaissa of 2 million dirhams (US$200,000). In addition, Jamaï was sentenced to three months&#x27; imprisonment, and Amar to two months. Reporters Without Borders sided with the editors, however, immediately calling for the Moroccan Justice Minister to overturn the verdict and asserting that &quot;Fines should not be used by the authorities with the aim of halting the appearance or publication of a media&quot;.

<text>The &quot;The Sporting News&quot; Rookie of the Year Award is an annual Major League Baseball (MLB) award established in 1946 by &quot;The Sporting News&quot;. For the first three years (1946–1948) and again in 1950, there was a single award. In 1949 and since 1951, the award has been given to a rookie from both the American League and National League. In 1961 and from 1963 through 2003, &quot;The Sporting News&quot; split the rookie award into two separate categories, Rookie Pitcher of the Year and Rookie Player of the Year (in each league).

<doc id="910662" wikidata="Q1399895" url="?curid=910662" title="Object relations theory">
<text>Object relations theory is a school of thought in psychoanalytic theory and psychoanalysis centered around theories of stages of ego development. Its concerns include the relation of the psyche to others in childhood and the exploration of relationships between external people, as well as internal images and the relations found in them. Adherents to this school of thought maintain that the infant&#x27;s relationship with the mother primarily determines the formation of their personality in adult life. Attachment is the bedrock of the development of the self, i.e. the psychic organization that creates one&#x27;s sense of identity.

== Theory ==
While its groundwork derives from theories of development of the ego in Freudian psychodynamics, object relations theory does not place emphasis on the role of biological drives in the formation of personality in adulthood. This school of thought instead suggests that a person&#x27;s pattern of relations to others as an adult is shaped by experiences of caregivers during infancy. Caregivers and other figures in the infant&#x27;s life are termed &quot;objects.&quot; An adult who experienced neglect or abuse in infancy expects similar behavior from others who, through transference, remind them of the neglectful or abusive parent from their past.

The first &quot;object&quot; in an individual&#x27;s psyche is usually an internalized image of the mother. Internal objects are formed by the patterns in one&#x27;s experience of being taken care of as an infant, which may or may not be accurate representations of the actual, external caretakers. Objects are usually internalized images of one&#x27;s mother, father, or other primary caregiver. However, they can also consist of parts of a person, such as an infant relating to the breast rather than to their mother as a whole person.

Later experiences can reshape these early patterns, but objects often continue to exert a strong influence throughout life. Objects are initially comprehended in the infant mind by their functions and are termed &quot;part objects&quot;. The breast that feeds the hungry infant is the &quot;good breast,&quot; while a hungry infant that finds no breast understands the breast to be the &quot;bad breast.&quot; With a &quot;good enough&quot; facilitating environment, part object functions eventually transform into a comprehension of whole objects. This corresponds with the ability to tolerate ambiguity, to see that both the &quot;good&quot; and the &quot;bad&quot; breast are a part of the same mother figure.

==History==
The initial line of thought emerged in 1917 with Sándor Ferenczi. Subsequently, early in the 1930s, Harry Stack Sullivan, established what is known as interpersonal theory. British psychologists Melanie Klein, Donald Winnicott, Harry Guntrip, Scott Stuart, and others extended object relations theory during the 1940s and 1950s. In 1952, Ronald Fairbairn formulated his theory of object relations.

The term has been used in many different contexts, which led to different connotations and denotations. While Fairbairn popularized the term &quot;object relations,&quot; Klein&#x27;s work tends to be most commonly identified with the terms &quot;object relations theory&quot; and &quot;British object relations,&quot; at least in contemporary North America, though the influence of the British Independent Group—which argued that the primary motivation of the child is object seeking rather than drive gratification—is becoming increasingly recognized. 

Klein felt that the psychodynamic battleground that Freud proposed occurs very early in life, during infancy. Furthermore, its origins are different from those that Freud proposed. The interactions between infant and mother are so deep and intense that they form the focus of the infant&#x27;s structure of drives. Some of these interactions provoke anger and frustration; others provoke strong feelings of dependence as the child begins to recognize that the mother is more than a breast from which to feed. These reactions threaten to overwhelm the infant&#x27;s sense of self. The way in which the infant resolves the conflict, Klein believed, is reflected in the adult&#x27;s personality.

Sigmund Freud originally identified people in a subject&#x27;s environment with the term &quot;object&quot; to identify people as the object of drives. Fairbairn took a radical departure from Freud by positing that humans are fundamentally motivated not by seeking fulfillment of a drive but by seeking the satisfaction that comes of being in relation to real others. Klein and Fairbairn were working along similar lines. Unlike Fairbairn, however, Klein always held that she was not departing from Freudian theory, rather simply elaborating early developmental phenomena consistent with Freudian theory.

Within the London psychoanalytic community, a conflict of loyalties took place between Klein and object relations theory (sometimes referred to as &quot;id psychology&quot;) and Anna Freud and ego psychology. In London, those who refused to choose sides were termed the &quot;middle school,&quot; whose members included Winnicott and Michael Balint. Klein&#x27;s theories became popular in South America, while Anna Freud&#x27;s garnered an American allegiance. Anna Freud was particularly influential in American psychoanalysis in the 1940s, 1950s, and 1960s. American ego psychology was furthered in the works of Hartmann, Kris, Loewenstein, Rapaport, Erikson, Jacobson, and Mahler. 

===Fairbairn&#x27;s theory of attachment===
Fairbairn described how people who were abused as children internalize that experience. The &quot;moral defense&quot; is the tendency seen in survivors of abuse to take all the bad upon themselves, each yielding the moral evil so the caretaker-object can be regarded as good. This is a use of splitting as a defense to maintain an attachment relationship in an unsafe world. In one particular example of this circumstance, Fairbairn introduced a four-year-old girl who had suffered a broken arm at the hands of her mother to a doctor friend of his, who told the little girl that they were going to find her a new parent. The girl, now panicked and unhappy, replied that she wanted her &quot;real mommy.&quot; Fairbairn asked, &quot;You mean the mommy that broke your arm?&quot; &quot;I was bad,&quot; the girl replied. From this exchange, he theorized that she needed to believe that her love object (mother) was entirely good to firmly believe she would one day receive the love and nurturing she needed—in an attempt to recuperate these needs, she used the moral defense to make &quot;herself&quot; bad in order to preserve her mother&#x27;s goodness.

==Kleinian object relations theory==

===Unconscious phantasy ===
Klein termed the psychological aspect of instinct unconscious &quot;phantasy&quot; (deliberately spelled with &#x27;ph&#x27; to distinguish it from the word &#x27;fantasy&#x27;). Phantasy is a given of psychic life which moves outward towards the world. These image-potentials are given a priority with the drives and eventually allow the development of more complex states of mental life. Unconscious phantasy in the infant&#x27;s emerging mental life is modified by the environment as the infant has contact with reality.
From the moment the infant starts interacting with the outer world, he is engaged in testing his phantasies in a reality setting. I want to suggest that the origin of thought lies in this process of testing phantasy against reality; that is, that thought is not only contrasted with phantasy, but based on it and derived from it.
The role of unconscious phantasy is essential in the development of a capacity for thinking. In Bion&#x27;s terms, the phantasy image is a preconception that will not be a thought until experience combines with a realization in the world of experience. The preconception and realization combine to take form as a concept that can be thought. The classic example of this is the infant&#x27;s observed rooting for the nipple in the first hours of life. The instinctual rooting is the preconception. The provision of the nipple provides the realization in the world of experience, and through time, with repeated experience, the preconception and realization combined to create the concept. Mental capacity builds upon previous experience as the environment and infant interact.

The first bodily experiences begin to build up the first memories, and external realities are progressively woven into the texture of phantasy. Before long, the child&#x27;s phantasies are able to draw upon plastic images as well as sensations—visual, auditory, kinæsthetic, touch, taste, smell images, etc. And these plastic images and dramatic representations of phantasy are progressively elaborated along with articulated perceptions of the external world.

With adequate care, the infant is able to tolerate increasing awareness of experience which is underlain by unconscious phantasy and leads to attainment of consecutive developmental achievements, &quot;the positions&quot; in Kleinian theory.

===Projective identification===
As a specific term, projective identification is introduced by Klein in &quot;Notes on some schizoid mechanisms.&quot;

[Projection] helps the ego to overcome anxiety by ridding it of danger and badness. Introjection of the good object is also used by the ego as a defense against anxiety. ... The processes of splitting off parts of the self and projecting them into objects are thus of vital importance for normal development as well as for abnormal object-relation. The effect of introjection on object relations is equally important. The introjection of the good object, first of all the mother&#x27;s breast, is a precondition for normal development ... It comes to form a focal point in the ego and makes for cohesiveness of the ego. ... I suggest for these processes the term &#x27;projective identification&#x27;.

Klein imagined this function as a defense which contributes to the normal development of the infant, including ego structure and the development of object relations. The introjection of the good breast provides a location where one can hide from persecution, an early step in developing a capacity to self-soothe.

Ogden identifies four functions that projective identification may serve. As in the traditional Kleinian model, it serves as a defense. Projective identification serves as a mode of communication. It is a form of object relations, and &quot;a pathway for psychological change.&quot; As a form of object relationship, projective identification is a way of relating with others who are not seen as entirely separate from the individual. Instead, this relating takes place &quot;between the stage of the subjective object and that of true object relatedness&quot;.

===Paranoid-schizoid and depressive positions===
The positions of Kleinian theory, underlain by unconscious phantasy, are stages in the normal development of ego and object relationships, each with its own characteristic defenses and organizational structure. The paranoid-schizoid and depressive positions occur in the pre-oedipal, oral phase of development.

In contrast to Fairbairn and later Guntrip, Klein believed that both good and bad objects are introjected by the infant, the internalization of good objects being essential to the development of healthy ego function. Klein conceptualized the depressive position as &quot;the most mature form of psychological organization&quot;, which continues to develop throughout the life span.

The depressive position occurs during the second quarter of the first year. Prior to that the infant is in the paranoid-schizoid position, which is characterized by persecutory anxieties and the mechanisms of splitting, projection, introjection, and omnipotence—which includes idealizing and denial—to defend against these anxieties. Depressive and paranoid-schizoid modes of experience continue to intermingle throughout the first few years of childhood.

====Paranoid-schizoid position====
The paranoid-schizoid position is characterized by part object relationships. Part objects are a function of splitting, which takes place in phantasy. At this developmental stage, experience can only be perceived as all good or all bad. As part objects, it is the function that is identified by the experiencing self, rather than whole and autonomous others. The hungry infant desires the good breast who feeds it. Should that breast appear, it is the good breast. If the breast does not appear, the hungry and now frustrated infant, in its distress, has destructive phantasies dominated by oral aggression towards the bad, hallucinated breast.

Klein notes that in splitting the object, the ego is also split. The infant who phantasies destruction of the bad breast is not the same infant that takes in the good breast, at least not until obtaining the depressive position, at which point good and bad can be tolerated simultaneously in the same person and the capacity for remorse and reparation ensue.

The anxieties of the paranoid schizoid position are of a persecutory nature, fear of the ego&#x27;s annihilation. Splitting allows good to stay separate from bad. Projection is an attempt to eject the bad in order to control through omnipotent mastery. Splitting is never fully effective, according to Klein, as the ego tends towards integration.

====Depressive position====
Klein saw the depressive position as an important developmental milestone that continues to mature throughout the life span. The splitting and part object relations that characterize the earlier phase are succeeded by the capacity to perceive that the other who frustrates is also the one who gratifies. Schizoid defenses are still in evidence, but feelings of guilt, grief, and the desire for reparation gain dominance in the developing mind.

In the depressive position, the infant is able to experience others as whole, which radically alters object relationships from the earlier phase. &quot;Before the depressive position, a good object is not in any way the same thing as a bad object. It is only in the depressive position that polar qualities can be seen as different aspects of the same object.&quot; Increasing nearness of good and bad brings a corresponding integration of ego.

In a development which Grotstein terms the &quot;primal split&quot;, the infant becomes aware of separateness from the mother. This awareness allows guilt to arise in response to the infant&#x27;s previous aggressive phantasies when bad was split from good. The mother&#x27;s temporary absences allow for continuous restoration of her &quot;as an image of representation&quot; in the infant mind. Symbolic thought may now arise, and can only emerge once access to the depressive position has been obtained. With the awareness of the primal split, a space is created in which the symbol, the symbolized, and the experiencing subject coexist. History, subjectivity, interiority, and empathy all become possible.

The anxieties characteristic of the depressive position shift from a fear of being destroyed to a fear of destroying others. In fact or phantasy, one now realizes the capacity to harm or drive away a person who one ambivalently loves. The defenses characteristic of the depressive position include the manic defenses, repression and reparation. The manic defenses are the same defenses evidenced in the paranoid-schizoid position, but now mobilized to protect the mind from depressive anxiety. As the depressive position brings about an increasing integration in the ego, earlier defenses change in character, becoming less intense and allowing for an increased awareness of psychic reality.

In working through depressive anxiety, projections are withdrawn, allowing the other more autonomy, reality, and a separate existence. The infant, whose destructive phantasies were directed towards the bad mother who frustrated, now begins to realize that bad and good, frustrating and satiating, it is always the same mother. Unconscious guilt for destructive phantasies arises in response to the continuing love and attention provided by caretakers.

[As] fears of losing the loved one become active, a very important step is made in the development. These feelings of guilt and distress now enter as a new element into the emotion of love. They become an inherent part of love, and influence it profoundly both in quality and quantity.

From this developmental milestone comes a capacity for sympathy, responsibility to and concern for others, and an ability to identify with the subjective experience of people one cares about. With the withdrawal of the destructive projections, repression of the aggressive impulses takes place. The child allows caretakers a more separate existence, which facilitates increasing differentiation of inner and outer reality. Omnipotence is lessened, which corresponds to a decrease in guilt and the fear of loss.

When all goes well, the developing child is able to comprehend that external others are autonomous people with their own needs and subjectivity.

Previously, extended absences of the object (the good breast, the mother) was experienced as persecutory, and, according to the theory of unconscious phantasy, the persecuted infant phantisizes destruction of the bad object. The good object who then arrives is not the object which did not arrive. Likewise, the infant who destroyed the bad object is not the infant who loves the good object.

In phantasy, the good internal mother can be psychically destroyed by the aggressive impulses. It is crucial that the real parental figures are around to demonstrate the continuity of their love. In this way, the child perceives that what happens to good objects in phantasy does not happen to them in reality. Psychic reality is allowed to evolve as a place separate from the literalness of the physical world.

Through repeated experience with good enough parenting, the internal image that the child has of external others, that is the child&#x27;s internal object, is modified by experience and the image transforms, merging experiences of good and bad which becomes more similar to the real object (e.g. the mother, who can be both good and bad). In Freudian terms, the pleasure principle is modified by the reality principle.

Melanie Klein saw this surfacing from the depressive position as a prerequisite for social life. Moreover, she viewed the establishment of an inside and an outside world as the start of interpersonal relationships.

Klein argued that people who never succeed in working through the depressive position in their childhood will, as a result, continue to struggle with this problem in adult life. For example: the cause that a person may maintain suffering from intense guilt feelings over the death of a loved one, may be found in the unworked- through depressive position. The guilt is there because of a lack of differentiation between phantasy and reality. It also functions as a defense mechanism to defend the self against unbearable feelings of sadness and sorrow, and the internal object of the loved one against the unbearable rage of the self, which, it is feared, could destroy the internal object forever.

====Further thinking regarding the positions====
Wilfred Bion articulates the dynamic nature of the positions, a point emphasised by Thomas Ogden, and expanded by John Steiner in terms of &#x27;&quot;The equilibrium between the paranoid-schizoid and the depressive positions&quot;&#x27;. Ogden and James Grotstein have continued to explore early infantile states of mind, and incorporating the work of Donald Meltzer, Esther Bick and others, postulate a position preceding the paranoid-schizoid. Grotstein, following Bion, also hypothesizes a transcendent position which emerges following attainment of the depressive position. This aspect of both Ogden and Grotstein&#x27;s work remains controversial for many within classical object relations theory.

===Death drive===
Sigmund Freud developed the concept object relation to describe or emphasize that bodily drives satisfy their need through a medium, an object, on a specific focus. The central thesis in Melanie Klein&#x27;s object relations theory was that objects play a decisive role in the development of a subject and can be either part-objects or whole-objects, i.e. a single organ (a mother&#x27;s breast) or a whole person (a mother). Consequently, both a mother or just the mother&#x27;s breast can be the focus of satisfaction for a drive. Furthermore, according to traditional psychoanalysis, there are at least two types of drives, the libido (mythical counterpart: Eros), and the death drive, mortido (mythical counterpart: Thanatos). Thus, the objects can be receivers of both love and hate, the affective effects of the libido and the death drive.

==Fairbairn&#x27;s model==

Ronald Fairbairn was impressed with the work of Klein, particularly in her emphasis on internalized objects, but he objected to the notion that internalization of external objects was based on the death instinct. The death instinct is a remnant of the Freudian model that was emphasized in Klein&#x27;s model, and her model assumes that human behavior is motivated by a struggle between the instinctual forces of love and hate. Klein believed that each human being was born with an inborn death instinct which motivated the child to imagine hurting their mother during the schizoid period of development. The child attempts to protect themselves from becoming overwhelmed by hate by internalizing, or taking into themselves, memories of the loving aspects of their parents to counteract the hateful components. Fairbairn&#x27;s model also emphasized the internalization of external objects, but his view of internalization was not based on instinctual drive, but rather the child&#x27;s normal desire to understand the world around them.

Fairbairn began his theory with his observation of the child&#x27;s absolute dependency on the good will of their mother. The infant was dependent on their maternal object (or caretaker) for providing them with all of his physical and psychological needs, as Fairbairn noted in the following passage:The outstanding feature of infantile dependence is its unconditional character. The infant is completely dependent upon its object not only for his existence and physical well being, but also for the satisfaction of his psychological needs...In contrast, the very helplessness of the child is sufficient to render him dependent in an unconditional sense...He has no alternative but to accept or reject his object – an alternative that is liable to present itself to him as a choice between life and death (Fairbairn, 1952, 47).

The model is completely interpersonal in that there are no biological drives of inherited instincts. When the maternal object provides a sense of safety and warmth, the child&#x27;s innate &quot;central ego&quot; is able to take in new experiences, which allows the child to expand their contact with the environment beyond the tight orbit of their mother. This is the beginning of the process of differentiation, or separation from the parent, which eventuates into a new and unique individual. As long as the maternal object continues to provide emotional warmth, support, and a sense of safety, the child will continue to develop throughout childhood. However, if the parent fails to consistently provide these factors, the child&#x27;s emotional and psychological development stops and the child regresses and remains undifferentiated from their mother. The following quote illustrates the basis of Fairbairn&#x27;s model:
The greatest need of a child is to obtain conclusive assurance (a) that he is genuinely loved as a person by his parents, and (b) that his parents genuinely accept his love. It is only in so far as such assurance is forthcoming in a form sufficiently convincing to enable him to depend safely upon his real objects that he is able to gradually renounce infantile dependence without misgiving. In the absence of such assurance his relationship with his objects is fraught with too much &quot;anxiety over separation&quot; to enable him to renounce the attitude of infantile dependence: for such a renunciation would be equivalent in his eyes to forfeiting all hope of ever obtaining the satisfaction of his unsatisfied emotional needs. Frustration of his desire to be loved as a person and have his love accepted is the greatest trauma that a child can experience (Fairbairn, 1952:39–40). 

The counterintitutive result of maternal (or paternal, if the father is the primary caregiver) failure is that the child becomes &quot;more, rather than less, dependent&quot; upon the caregiver, because by failing to meet the child&#x27;s needs, the child has to remain dependent in the hope that love and support will be forthcoming in the future. Over time, the failed support of the child&#x27;s developmental needs leaves them further and further behind their similarly aged peers. The emotionally abandoned child must turn to their own resources for comfort, and turns to their inner world with its readily available fantasies, in an attempt to partially meet their needs for comfort, love and later, for success. Often these fantasies involve other figures who have been self-created. According to Fairbairn, the child&#x27;s turn toward the inner world protects them from the harsh reality of their family environment, but turns them away from external reality: &quot;All represent &quot;relationships with internalized objects, to which the individual is compelled to turn in default of satisfactory relationships in the outer world&quot; (Fairbairn, 1952, 40 italics in the original).

=== Fairbairn&#x27;s structural theory ===
Fairbairn realized that the child&#x27;s absolute dependence on the good will of their mother made them intolerant of accepting or even acknowledging that they are being abused, because that would weaken their necessary attachment to his parent. The child creates a delusion that they live in a warm cocoon of love, and any information that interferes with this delusion is forcibly expelled from their consciousness, as they cannot face the terror of rejection or abandonment at three, four or five years of age. The defense that children use to maintain their sense of security is dissociation, and they force all memories of parental failures (neglect, indifference or emotional abandonments) into their unconscious. Over time the neglected child develops an ever expanding memory bank of event after event of being neglected. These dissociated interpersonal events are always in pairs, a self in relationship to an object. For example, a child who is neglected dissociates a memory of themselves as a frightened confused self who has been neglected by a remote and indifferent parent. If these events are repeated again and again, the child&#x27;s unconscious groups the memories into a view of the self and a view of the parent, both which are too toxic and upsetting to be allow into consciousness. The paired dissociations of self and object that accrued from rejections were called the antilibidinal ego (the child&#x27;s frightened self) and the rejecting object (the indifferent or absent parent). Thus, in addition to the conscious central ego, which relates to the nurturing and supportive parts of the parent (called the ideal object), the child has a second view of self and object in his unconscious: the antilibidinal ego and the rejecting object. 

No child can live in a world devoid of hope for the future. Fairbairn had a part time position in an orphanage, where he saw neglected and abused children. He noticed that they created fantasies about the &quot;goodness&quot; of their parents and eagerly looked forward to being reunited with them. He realized that these children had dissociated and repressed the many physical and emotional outrages that they had been subjected to in the family. Once in the orphanage, these same children lived in a fantasy world of hope and expectation, which prevented them from psychological collapse. The fantasy self that the child develops was called the libidinal self (or libidinal ego) and it related to the very best parts of the parents, who may have shown interest or tenderness toward their child at one time or another, which the needy child then enhances with fantasy. The fantasy enhanced view of the parent was called the exciting object by Fairbairn, which was based on the excitement of the child as he spun his fantasy of a reunion with his loving parents. This pair of self and objects is also contained in the child&#x27;s unconscious, but he may call them into awareness when he is desperate for comfort and support (Fairbairn, 1952, 102–119).

Fairbairn&#x27;s structural model contains three selves that relate to three aspects of the object. The selves do not know or relate to each other, and the process of dissociation and the development of these structures is called the splitting defense, or splitting.

* The child&#x27;s central ego relates to the Ideal object when the parent is supportive and nurturant.
* The antilibidinal ego relates only to the rejecting object, and these structures contain the child&#x27;s fear and anger as well as the parent&#x27;s indifference, neglect or outright abuse.
* The libidinal ego relates only to the exciting object, and these structures contain the overly hopeful child who relates to the exciting over-promising parent. 

The Fairbairnian object relations therapist imagines that all interactions between the client and the therapist are occurring in the client&#x27;s inner object relations world, in one of the three dyads. The Fairbairnian object relations therapist also uses their own emotional reactions as therapeutic cues. If the therapist is feeling irritated at the client, or bored, that might be interpreted as a re-enactment of the Antilibidinal Ego and the Bad Object, with the therapist cast in the role of Bad Object. If the therapist can patiently be an empathic therapist through the client&#x27;s re-enactment, then the client has a new experience to incorporate into their inner object world, hopefully expanding their inner picture of their Good Object. Cure is seen as the client being able to receive from their inner Good Object often enough to have a more stable peaceful life.

==Continuing developments==
Attachment theory, researched by John Bowlby and others, has continued to deepen our understanding of early object relationships. While a different strain of psychoanalytic theory and research, the findings in attachment studies have continued to support the validity of the developmental progressions described in object relations. Recent decades in developmental psychological research, for example on the onset of a &quot;theory of mind&quot; in children, has suggested that the formation of the mental world is enabled by the infant-parent interpersonal interaction which was the main thesis of British object-relations tradition (e.g. Fairbairn, 1952).

While object relations theory grew out of psychoanalysis, it has been applied to the general fields of psychiatry and psychotherapy by such authors as N. Gregory Hamilton and Glen O. Gabbard. In making object relations theory more useful as a general psychology N. Gregory Hamilton added the specific ego functions to Otto F. Kernberg&#x27;s concept of object relations units.

<text>The Pratt &amp; Whitney F100 (company designation JTF22) is a low bypass afterburning turbofan engine. It was designed and manufactured by Pratt &amp; Whitney to power the U.S. Air Force&#x27;s &quot;FX&quot; initiative in 1965, which became the F-15 Eagle. The engine was to be developed in tandem with the F401 which shares a similar core but with an upscaled fan for the U.S. Navy&#x27;s F-14 Tomcat. The F401 was later abandoned due to costs and reliability issues. The F100 also powered the F-16 Fighting Falcon for the Air Force&#x27;s Lightweight Fighter (LWF) program.

==Development==

In 1967, the United States Navy and United States Air Force issued a joint engine Request for Proposals (RFP) for the F-14 Tomcat and the FX, which became the parallel fighter design competition that led to the F-15 Eagle in 1970. This engine program was called the IEDP (Initial Engine Development Program) and was funded and managed out of the Aeronautical Systems Division (ASD) at Wright-Patterson AFB. Under ASD, a Systems Project Office Cadre was assigned to manage both the FX Aircraft and Engine definition phase. The Turbine Engine Division of the Air Force Propulsion Laboratory was employed in a support role to assist ASD Systems Engineering in evaluations of technical risks. Later upon selection of the F-15 the ASD engineering cadre became the F-15 Systems Project Office.
The IEDP was created to be a competitive engine design/demonstration phase followed with a down select to one winning engine design and development program. General Electric and Pratt &amp; Whitney were placed on contract for an approximately 18-month program with goals to improve thrust and reduce weight to achieve a thrust-to-weight ratio of 8. At the end of the IEDP, General Electric and Pratt &amp; Whitney submitted proposals for their engine candidates for the aircraft that had been selected in the FX Competition, the McDonnell Douglas F-15. The Pratt &amp; Whitney proposal was selected as the winner and the engine was designated the F100. The Air Force would award Pratt &amp; Whitney a contract in 1970 to develop and produce F100-PW-100 (USAF) and F401-PW-400 (USN) engines. The Navy would use the engine in the planned F-14B and the XFV-12 project but would cut back and later cancel its order after the latter&#x27;s failure due to costs and reliability issues, and chose to continue to use the Pratt &amp; Whitney TF30 engine from the F-111 in its F-14s.

==Variants==
The F100 is a twin spool, axial flow, afterburning turbofan engine. It has a 3-stage fan driven by a two-stage low-pressure turbine and a 10-stage compressor driven by a two-stage high-pressure turbine. The initial F100-PW-100 variant generates nearly of thrust in full afterburner and weighs approximately , achieving its target thrust-to-weight ratio of 8 and providing the F-15 with its desired thrust-to-weight ratio of greater than 1:1 at combat weight.

===PW-100/200===
The F100-PW-100 first flew in an F-15 Eagle in 1972 with a maximum continuous power rating of , military power of , and afterburning thrust of with 5-minute limit. Due to the advanced nature of engine stemming from ambitious performance goals, numerous problems were encountered in its early days of service including high wear, stalling and &quot;hard&quot; afterburner starts. These &quot;hard&quot; starts could be caused by failure of the afterburner to start or by extinguishing after start, in either case the large jets of jet fuel were lit by the engine exhaust resulting in high pressure waves causing the engine to stall; these stagnation stalls usually occurred at high Mach and high altitude, and could seriously damage the turbine if the condition was not corrected. The problems were contributed by pilots making much more abrupt throttle changes than previous fighters and engines due to the excess thrust available. Early problems were eventually solved by the development of the F100-PW-220 in the early 1980s, which the -100 could be upgraded to.

The F-16 Fighting Falcon entered service with the F100-PW-200; compared to the -100, the -200 had some additional redundancies for single-engine reliability as well as almost identical thrust ratings. In particular, a &quot;proximate splitter&quot; — an extension of the internal casing behind the fan that splits the core and bypass airflow — was introduced on the -200 that reduced the severity of the high pressure waves from &quot;hard&quot; afterburner starts. This greatly reduced the rate of stagnation stalls, and the -200 on the F-16 saw much better reliability than the -100 on the F-15, although some of the issues from the -100 remained. Similarly, these problems were eventually solved by the F100-220, which the -200 could be upgraded to as well.

===PW-220/220E===
Due to the unsatisfactory reliability, maintenance costs, and service life of the F100-100/200, Pratt &amp; Whitney was eventually pressured into upgrading the engine to address these issues. The Air Force also began funding the General Electric F101 Derivative Fighter Engine, which eventually became the F110, as a competitor to the F100 to coerce more urgency from Pratt &amp; Whitney. The result of Pratt &amp; Whitney&#x27;s improvement efforts was the F100-PW-220, which eliminates almost all stall-stagnations and augmentor instability issues from the -100 as well as doubling time between depot overhauls. Reliability and maintenance costs were also drastically improved, and the engine incorporates a digital electronic engine control (DEEC). The -220 engine produces static thrust of in military (intermediate) power and afterburning, very slightly lower than the static thrust of the -100/200, but the -220 has better dynamic thrust across most of the envelope.

The F100-220 was introduced in 1986 and was installed on the F-15 and F-16, gradually replacing the -100/200. Seeking a way to drive unit costs down, the USAF implemented the Alternate Fighter Engine (AFE) program in 1984 (nicknamed &quot;The Great Engine War&quot;), under which the engine contract would be awarded through competition; the -220 would be Pratt &amp; Whitney&#x27;s initial offering in the AFE program, competing with the General Electric F110-GE-100. The F-16C/D Block 30/32s were the first to be built with the common engine bay, able to accept the existing F100-200/220 engine (Block 32) or the F110-100 (Block 30). A non-afterburning variant, the F100-PW-220U powers the Northrop Grumman X-47B UCAV. The -100 and -200 series engines could be upgraded to become equivalent to -220 specifications; the &quot;E&quot; abbreviation from 220E is for &quot;equivalent&quot; and given to engines which have been upgraded as such.

====Specifications (F100-220)====
===PW-229===
The F100-PW-229 and its competitor, the General Electric F110-GE-129, were the result of the USAF seeking greater power for its tactical aircraft through the Improved Performance Engine (IPE) program in the 1980s. It was developed under company designation PW1128; in addition to greater thrust, the -229 incorporates the reliability and durability improvements of the -220 as well as an enhanced DEEC. Compared to earlier variants, the -229 has a higher turbine inlet temperature, higher airflow of , and lower bypass ratio. The first engine was flown in 1989 and produced thrust of (dry/intermediate thrust) and with augmentation. The -229 powers late model F-16C/D Block 52s, F-16V Block 72s and F-15Es. Visually, the -229 can be distinguished from the -100/200/220 by its black composite external nozzle flaps, or &quot;turkey feathers&quot;, when mounted rather than the metallic ones of the earlier variants.
A variant of the -229 fitted with a 3-dimensional axisymmetric thrust vectoring nozzle, referred by Pratt &amp; Whitney as the Pitch/Yaw Balance Beam Nozzle (P/YBBN), was tested on the F-15 ACTIVE (Advanced Control Technology for Integrated Vehicles) in the 1990s. The nozzle could vector the exhaust up to 20 degrees from the axial line in any direction.

In 2007, the F100-PW-229EEP (Engine Enhancement Package) began development to increase reliability and number of accumulated cycles between depot overhauls. This was done by applying technology from the F100-PW-232 (see below), which in turn incorporated technology and advancements from the F119 program for the F-22, as well as (for -229EEP) from the F135 program for the F-35; the -229EEP incorporates updated turbine materials, cooling management techniques, compressor aerodynamics, split cases (top and bottom) and updated DEEC software. Deliveries of the -229EEP began in 2009 and existing -229s can be upgraded to this configuration during scheduled depot maintenance.

====Specifications (F100-229)====
===PW-232===
The F100-PW-232, originally called F100-PW-229A (Advanced), was a further enhanced variant that incorporated engineering advances and technology from Pratt &amp; Whitney&#x27;s F119 engine for the F-22 as well as operational experience from the -229; development began in the late 1990s. Both the -232 and its competitor, the General Electric F110-GE-132, were designed to make full use of the F-16&#x27;s Modular Common Inlet Duct (MCID), or &quot;Big Mouth&quot; inlet introduced in the Block 30 variant. The fan module was redesigned for increased airflow of and greater reliability; it incorporated stages with wide chord blades and disk formed into a single piece called an integrally-blades rotor (IBR), or blisk. The stators were also redesigned for better aerodynamics to improve stall margin. The -232 could produce of thrust in intermediate power and in afterburner; alternatively it could produce the same thrust levels as the -229 but increase inspection intervals by 40%. The -232 was not pursued by the USAF, but many of the improvements were incorporated into the -229EEP to increase its reliability and inspection intervals.

====Specifications (F100-229A/232)====
===Derivatives===
The F401 was the naval development of the F100 and designed in tandem. It was intended to power the F-14B Tomcat and Rockwell XFV-12, but the engine was canceled due to costs and development issues. The PW1120 turbofan was a smaller derivative of the F100; it was installed as a modification to a single F-4E fighter jet, and powered the canceled IAI Lavi.

<text>Lewis University is a private Lasallian university in Romeoville, Illinois, United States. It enrolls around 6,600 students in more than 80 undergraduate programs, 35 graduate programs, and accelerated programs for working adults. It is also where the National Weather Service in Chicago/Romeoville is located.

==History==
Lewis University was founded in 1932 by the Archdiocese of Chicago and Bishop Bernard J. Scheil as the &quot;Holy Name Technical School&quot;. The school gets its name from philanthropist Frank J. Lewis who funded the construction of many of the school&#x27;s buildings. During these early days, aviation technology courses were chosen as the special emphasis of instruction, becoming the origin of today&#x27;s highly regarded Department of Aviation and Transportation Studies. The school was incorporated in 1934 under the name Lewis Holy Name Technical School. In 1935, it became Lewis Holy Name School of Aeronautics, a name which is engraved in stone on the building now known as the Philip Lynch Theatre at the Oremus Fine Arts Center.

During World War II, normal classes were suspended as the campus was given to the United States Navy to train pilots. The campus is adjacent to the Lewis University Airport. Regular classes resumed in late 1944 and the college soon adopted a more traditional arts and science curriculum. Women were admitted for the first time in 1949. Three years later, the school&#x27;s name was changed to the &quot;Lewis College of Science and Technology&quot;. The institution&#x27;s name was shortened to simply &quot;Lewis College&quot; in 1962 and finally received its current name of &quot;Lewis University&quot; in 1973.

In 2004 and 2005, Lewis enrolled more than 5,000 total students. In 2019, Lewis University offered more than 80 undergraduate majors and programs of study, an accelerated degree completion option for working adults, various aviation programs, and 35 graduate programs. The university also offers degree programs in Albuquerque, New Mexico.

In 2016, David J. Livingston, former president of Lourdes University in Sylvania, Ohio, succeeded James Gaffney as the 10th president of the university. Gaffney retired after 28 years of leadership and service to Lewis University and its students.

== Athletics ==

The Lewis athletic teams are called the Flyers. The university is a member of the Division II level of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), primarily competing in the Great Lakes Valley Conference (GLVC) for most of its sports since the 1980–81 academic year; while its men&#x27;s volleyball team compete in the Midwestern Intercollegiate Volleyball Association (MIVA). Since it is not a sponsored sport at the Division II level, the men&#x27;s volleyball team is the only program that plays in Division I.

Prior to joining the NCAA, Lewis was a member of the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA), primarily competing in the Chicagoland Collegiate Athletic Conference (CCAC) from 1954–55 to 1979–80.

Lewis competes in 24 intercollegiate varsity sports: Men&#x27;s sports include baseball, basketball, bowling, cross country, golf, lacrosse, soccer, swimming, tennis, track &amp; field and volleyball; while women&#x27;s sports include basketball, bowling, cross country, golf, lacrosse, soccer, softball, stunt, swimming, tennis, track &amp; field and volleyball.

<text>The 96th Infantry Division was an infantry division (military) of the United States Army. It was formed in 1918 and served in World War I and in the Pacific War during World War II. It was reformed after the war and was part of the United States Army Reserve until 1965.

In 1967 the number &quot;96&quot; was resurrected for a U.S. Army Reserve area administrative headquarters, the 96th Army Reserve Command. Technically it had no lineage connection to the 96th Infantry Division. With a number of redesignations, it continues in service in the 21st Century. Effective 17 September 2008, it became the 96th Sustainment Brigade, with its headquarters located at Fort Douglas, Salt Lake City, Utah.

==World War I==

On 5 September 1918, the War Department directed the organization of the 96th Division at Camp Wadsworth, South Carolina. Plans called for the division to include a headquarters, headquarters troop, the 191st Infantry Brigade (381st and 382nd Infantry Regiments and 362nd Machine Gun Battalion), 192nd Infantry Brigade (383rd and 384th Infantry Regiments and 363rd Machine Gun Battalion), 361st Machine Gun Battalion, 171st Field Artillery Brigade (64th-66th Field Artillery Regiments and 22nd Trench Mortar Battery), 321st Engineers, 621st Field Signal Battalion, and 321st Train Headquarters and Military Police (Ammunition, Engineer, Sanitary, and Supply Trains). 

The 171st Field Artillery Brigade (including the 321st Ammunition Train) was to be organized at Camp Kearny, California, while it was intended that the 191st Infantry Brigade would be organized in France from the 3rd and 4th Pioneer Infantry Regiments. Formation of the division began in October with the appointment of Major General Guy Carleton to command. By the end of October and the Armistice of 11 November 1918, the strength of the division was only around 3,100 officers and men and training had not progressed beyond the elementary phases, and it was ordered demobilized on 30 November 1918.

==Interwar period==
The 96th Division was reconstituted in the Organized Reserve on 24 June 1921, allotted to the Ninth Corps Area, and assigned to the XIX Corps. The division was further allotted to the states of Oregon and Washington as its home area. The division headquarters was organized on 7 October 1921 at the New Post Office Building in Portland, Oregon, and remained there until activated for World War II. To encourage esprit de corps, in September 1922 the division’s officers adopted the nickname “Columbia Division” after the majestic Columbia River, which neatly ran through the middle of the division’s home area. To maintain communications with the officers of the division, the division staff published a newsletter appropriately nicknamed &quot;The Columbian.&quot; The newsletter informed the division’s members of such things as when and where the inactive training sessions were to be held, what the division’s summer training quotas were, where the camps were to be held, and which units would be assigned to help conduct the Citizens Military Training Camps. 

The designated mobilization and training station for the division was Camp Lewis (later redesignated Fort Lewis in 1931), Washington, the location where much of the 96th’s training activities occurred over the next 20 years. For the few summers when the division headquarters was called to duty for training as a unit, it usually trained with the staff of the 3rd Division at Camp Lewis. The subordinate infantry regiments of the division held their summer training primarily with the units of the 3rd Division&#x27;s 5th Infantry Brigade at Fort Lewis or Vancouver Barracks, Washington. Other units, such as the special troops, artillery, engineers, aviation, medical, and quartermaster, trained at various posts in the Ninth Corps Area with Regular Army units of the same branch. For example, the 321st Engineer Regiment usually trained with elements of the 6th Engineer Regiment at Fort Lewis or Fort Lawton, Washington; the 321st Medical Regiment trained with the 3rd Medical Regiment at Camp Lewis; and the 321st Observation Squadron trained with the 91st Observation Squadron at Crissy Field, California. In addition to the unit training camps, the infantry regiments of the division rotated responsibility to conduct the Citizens Military Training Camps training held at Camp Lewis each year. 

On a number of occasions, the division participated in Ninth Corps Area and Fourth Army command post exercises (CPXs) in conjunction with other Regular Army, National Guard, and Organized Reserve units. These training events gave division staff officers’ opportunities to practice the roles they would be expected to perform in the event the division was mobilized. Unlike the Regular and Guard units in the Ninth Corps Area, the 96th Division did not participate in the various Ninth Corps Area maneuvers and the Fourth Army maneuvers of 1937, 1940, and 1941 as an organized unit due to lack of enlisted personnel and equipment. Instead, the officers and a few enlisted reservists were assigned to Regular and Guard units to fill vacant slots and bring the units up to full peace strength for the exercises. For the 1937 maneuver, for example, about 200 of the division’s officers were attached to the National Guard&#x27;s 41st Division (Idaho, Montana, Oregon, Washington, and Wyoming) to allow that unit to function as an almost full-strength division. Additionally, some officers were assigned duties as umpires or as support personnel.

==World War II==
The 96th Division was ordered into active service on 15 August 1942, eight months after the Attack on Pearl Harbor brought the United States into World War II. Before Organized Reserve infantry divisions were ordered into active military service, they were reorganized on paper as &quot;triangular&quot; divisions under the 1940 tables of organization. The headquarters companies of the two infantry brigades were consolidated into the division&#x27;s cavalry reconnaissance troop, and one infantry regiment was removed by inactivation. The field artillery brigade headquarters and headquarters battery became the headquarters and headquarters battery of the division artillery, and its three field artillery regiments were reorganized into four battalions. The engineer, medical, and quartermaster regiments were reorganized into battalions. In 1942, divisional quartermaster battalions were split into ordnance light maintenance companies and quartermaster companies, and the division&#x27;s headquarters and military police company, which had previously been a combined unit, was split.

===World War II combat chronicle===

Before Organized Reserve infantry divisions were ordered into active military service, they were reorganized on paper as &quot;triangular&quot; divisions under the 1940 tables of organization. The two infantry brigade headquarters were converted to provide personnel for other units, and the 380th Infantry Regiment was disbanded. The 192nd Infantry Brigade headquarters company was converted into the division&#x27;s 96th Reconnaissance Troop, while the 191st Infantry Brigade headquarters formed the core of the division&#x27;s headquarters company. The field artillery brigade headquarters and headquarters battery became the headquarters and headquarters battery of the division artillery. Its three field artillery regiments were reorganized into four battalions; one battalion was taken from each of the two 75 mm gun regiments to form two 105 mm howitzer battalions, the brigade&#x27;s ammunition train was reorganized as the third 105 mm howitzer battalion, and the 155 mm howitzer battalion was formed from the 155 mm howitzer regiment. The engineer, medical, and quartermaster regiments were reorganized into battalions. In 1942, divisional quartermaster battalions were split into ordnance light maintenance companies and quartermaster companies, and the division&#x27;s headquarters and military police company, which had previously been a combined unit, was split.

After initial training at Camp White in southern Oregon, the 96th Infantry Division participation in the Oregon Maneuver combat exercise in the fall of 1943. Major General James L. Bradley commanded the 96th Infantry Division throughout its entire life in World War II. His assistant division commander, Brigadier General (later Major General) Claudius M. Easley, who would later be killed in action on Okinawa on 19 June 1945, personally supervised and emphasized the 96th Division&#x27;s marksmanship training, leading to the 96th&#x27;s nickname of &quot;Deadeye Division&quot;. 

The 96th Infantry Division trained in the Hawaiian Islands from July to September 1944, before entering combat in an assault landing in Leyte Gulf, Philippine Islands, between Tanauan and Dulag on 20 October 1944. Enemy resistance in the beachhead area was quickly broken and the Division had advanced to and secured the Tanauan-Dagami-Tabontabon sector by 9 November after heavy fighting. The Division continued to wipe out resistance on the island, engaging in small unit actions, patrolling, probing, and wiping out pockets of Japanese. Chalk Ridge was taken, 12 December 1944, and major organized resistance was at an end by Christmas Day. The next 3 months were spent in mopping up, security duty, training, and loading for the coming invasion of Okinawa.

The Division left the Philippines, 27 March 1945, for Okinawa, making an assault landing on the island, 1 April 1945. The landing was unopposed and a beachhead was established near Sunabe, 1–3 April. Resistance stiffened considerably as the Division advanced to Kakazu Ridge, where fighting was fierce, 7–16 April. The 96th assaulted and cracked the fanatically defended enemy defense line, Tanabaru-Nishibaru, 17–23 April, and after advancing slightly against extremely determined resistance, was relieved on 30 April by the 77th Infantry Division. The Division trained and rested, 1–9 May, while elements mopped up bypassed enemy pockets and then returned to the offensive, 10 May, attacking and capturing Conical-Sugar Hill Ridge on 21 May, thus breaking the right flank of the Shuri defenses. Heavy rains the following week slowed down the advance. The offensive was resumed, 30 May, against weakening enemy resistance; Japanese north of Yonabaru-Shuri-Naha Road area were cleared out. Resistance stiffened again, 3 June, and Laura Hill was taken, 14 June 1945, only after a bloody fight; the last important Japanese defense position, the Yuza-Dake, Yaeju-Dake Hill mass, was secured by 17 June, and on 22 June all resistance was declared at an end. The Division patrolled an area from Chan to Ogusuku until 30 June.

After resting in July, the Division left Okinawa for Mindoro, in the Philippines, and engaged in a training program. The Division left the Philippines, 17 January 1946, for the United States.

The division was inactivated on 3 February 1946, at Camp Anza, California.

== Postwar infantry division 1946–1965 ==
The division was reactivated within the Army Reserve on 31 December 1946, commanded by Colonel Ross J. Wilson of Kalispell, Montana. The division headquarters was Fort Missoula, Montana. Major units were located at Great Falls, Montana, Phoenix, Arizona, and Salt Lake City. The division appears to have kept the 381st, 382nd, and 383rd Infantry Regiments. In August 1948, Colonel LeRoy H. Anderson of Conrad, Montana was appointed as the Commander. The headquarters moved to Helena, Montana, and then transferred to Fort Douglas, Utah in 1962. Major General Michael B. Kauffman was named commander, followed by Brigadier General Ray D. Free. Within four months in 1963 the division became first an operational headquarters, then a command headquarters. The 96th Command Headquarters was inactivated on 31 December 1965.

However some previous elements of the division remained active within the newly activated 191st Infantry Brigade.

== Reserve headquarters from 1967 ==
On 22 December 1967, the Department of the Army announced that Salt Lake City, Utah had been chosen as the site for one of the eighteen new nationwide Army Reserve Command (ARCOM) headquarters. The ARCOM would command all Army Reserve units in Utah, Idaho and Montana. In March 1968, the number &quot;96&quot; was assigned to the command. The Department of the Army allowed ARCOMs to wear the shoulder sleeve insignia and numerical designation of previously active infantry divisions but did not convey upon ARCOMs the lineages of those divisions, as it is against Army policy for TDA units, such as ARCOMs, to perpetuate the lineages of TO&amp;E units, such as divisions. Also in March the 259th Quartermaster Battalion, an ARCOM unit in Pleasant Grove, Utah was ordered to active duty. In September, the 259th transferred overseas for duty in Vietnam and served with distinction, being awarded the Meritorious Unit Commendation. It was released from active duty on 18 September 1969. Sterling R. Ryser succeeded Major General Free as ARCOM commander in early 1969. In 1971 with the merger of the Fourth and Fifth Army areas, the 96th ARCOM&#x27;s span of command was increased to include North Dakota, South Dakota, Wyoming, and Colorado. In 1973 the command was again reorganized, gaining the state of New Mexico and losing North and South Dakota.

Since 1974, 96th ARCOM units have trained with their regular Army counterparts throughout the United States, Europe, and Asia. Franklin McKean was appointed Commanding General in 1975, followed by Larry Morris in 1979. In 1984, the ARCOM was again reorganized, losing New Mexico and regaining North and South Dakota. Richard O. Christiansen was appointed as Commanding General. In 1985, the 96th ARCOM was geographically the largest Army Reserve Command in the United States. The ARCOM consisted of 94 units and 9,320 reservists, augmented by 243 full-time soldiers and 288 civilian employees. On 9 April 1989 Donald M. Bagley was appointed Commanding General.

In 1991, 3rd Battalion, 87th Infantry Regiment, located in Colorado, was mobilized for security duties in Germany during the Gulf War. In 1993 MG Richard F. Reeder assumed command of the 96th ARCOM. In 1996, as part of the US Army Reserve Command restructuring, the 96th ARCOM became the 96th Regional Support Command. After the end of the Cold War, the command was finally redesignated the 96th Regional Readiness Command. Subordinate units of the 96th RRC have been deployed to Iraq, Afghanistan, and Djibouti in support of the Global War on Terror from 2001. Units have also been deployed to Bosnia and Herzegovina and Kosovo as part of peacekeeping operations in the Balkans.

Effective 17 September 2008, the 96th Regional Readiness Command was reorganized and redesignated as the 96th Sustainment Brigade, with its headquarters located at Fort Douglas, Salt Lake City, Utah. The 96th Sustainment Brigade deployed for Operation Iraqi Freedom in 2009. The brigade returned to the United States in May 2010.

In 2015, members of the headquarters element mobilized in support of Operation Inherent Resolve fighting Daesh in Iraq and Syria, providing support to Special Operations Command Central, and returned to the U.S. in April 2016.

<text>Fire-King is an Anchor Hocking brand of glassware similar to Pyrex. It was formerly made of low expansion borosilicate glass and ideal for oven use. Currently it is made of tempered soda-lime-silicate glass in the US and borosilicate in Japan

==History==
Fire-King was originally produced in the 1940s for everyday use, rather than display. It was often sold in bags of flour as a promotional item or was given away at gas stations. Fire-King could also be purchased at local grocery and hardware stores. Several varieties of Fire-King dishes were made; nesting bowls, dessert bowls, glass beverage containers, casserole dishes, mugs and more. The vintage nesting bowls, produced by the Anchor Hocking Company, are one of the most sought after collectible dishes of this type.

On Dec 21, 2010, Fire-King Japan or Fire-King Japan Co., Ltd. was founded in Japan to revive Fire-King milk glass. Officially opening to the public in 2011 in Tokyo, Japan, the company sells a variety of mugs and other dishes in various colors such as milk glass, jade-ite, and rose-ite. Their current CEO is Naoyuki Koike.

==Products==
The Fire-King line includes bowls, casseroles, cups, plates, serving platters, creamers, vases and more. Fire-King is not designed for dishwasher use, which can dull its original lustre and remove any applied paint decorations.
Fire-King Japan has lines that use the American vintage molds of various mugs and other dishes. Many of these also include reproductions of the vintage decals as well as new decal collaborations with brands such as Disney and Mos Burger. In addition brands such as Beams and GoHemp create clothing and accessories with the Fire-King logo.

==Patterns and colors==
There are many decaled patterns that are very popular including Blue Mosaic, Wheat, Primrose, Fleurette, Forget Me Not and Anniversary Rose. Patterns with solid glass colors are Swirl/Shell (1965–76), Sheaves of Wheat (Laurel 1952-63), Kimberly Diamond, Jane Ray, Alice, Fish Scale, Three Bands (1952–56) Restaurant Ware, 4000 Line and 1700 Line.
Fire-King solid glass colors come in jadeite, burgundy, rose-ite (creamy pink) (not to be confused with “pink swirl” which is a pink fired on color over opaque white glass), turquoise blue, azur-ite (light pale blue), white, ivory-white and ivory. It can also be a fired-on coating over crystal in shades of pastel green, pastel blue, pastel peach, pastel yellow, primary orange, primary blue, primary yellow and primary green. These fired on colors are part of the pattern Rainbow. There are also fired-on Lustre color finishes that comes in several patterns and a few colors on dinnerware such as grey, white, pink and the commonly found Peach Lustre. There is also a bakeware set and mixing bowl set in “copper tint” fired-on color (over white opaque glass) which looks very similar to peach lustre, but is just a little more subtle in its shade of copper.
Jadeite Restaurant Ware is most popular among some collectors. It is a creamy jade color. In 2000 Anchor Hocking re-debuted Fire-King in Jadeite. The pieces have been made from new molds and are not the same as the older Fire-King items. They are also stamped &quot;Fire-King, 2000.&quot;

<text>Jérémie Émile Patrick Bonnelame (born October 24, 1938) is a Seychellois political figure and diplomat. He was Secretary-General of the Indian Ocean Commission from 1993 to 1997, Minister of Foreign Affairs from 1997 to 2005, and was the Permanent Representative of the Seychelles to the United Nations from 2005 to 2007. He was the Chairman of the Constitutional Appointment Authority from July 2007 to July 2014(CAA).

==Life and career==
Bonnelame was born on Mahé Island in the Seychelles. He worked as a teacher at the Modern Secondary School of Seychelles from 1967 to 1975, as well as Editor-in-Chief of &quot;L&#x27;Écho des Îles&quot;, a Catholic monthly. He was subsequently Director-General of Information from 1978 to 1979, then Principal Secretary in the Ministry of Education from 1979 to 1980, Principal Secretary in the Ministry of External Relations from 1981 to 1983, and Principal Secretary in the Ministry of Education and Information from 1983 to 1986.

He entered the government as Minister of Manpower in 1986, serving in that position until 1988; he was then Minister of Transport from 1988 to 1989 and Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries from 1989 to 1993. He was not included in the government named on August 3, 1993 and was instead appointed as Secretary-General of the Indian Ocean Commission in the same year. He remained in that post until he returned to the Seychellois government as Minister of Foreign Affairs in August 1997.

Bonnelame was replaced as Foreign Minister in February 2005 and was instead nominated as Permanent Representative of the Seychelles to the United Nations and Ambassador to a number of countries, including the United States, by President James Michel. The National Assembly approved the nomination on March 1. Presenting the motion for its approval, Leader of Government Business Patrick Herminie noted Bonnelame&#x27;s extensive experience as a politician and diplomat; the opposition chose to abstain from the vote, acknowledging that Bonnelame was qualified for the post but questioning the selection of a man of Bonnelame&#x27;s age, expressing the view that a younger person would be more suitable. Bonnelame presented his credentials as Permanent Representative on May 13, 2005; he also presented his credentials as Ambassador to the United States in May and presented his credentials as High Commissioner to Canada on June 7.

In mid-2007, Bonnelame was appointed as Chairman of the Constitutional Appointment Authority (CAA); he was replaced by Ronald Jumeau as Permanent Representative to the UN and as Ambassador to the US. In April 2008, Bonnelame was additionally appointed by President Michel as a member of a constitutional review commission.

<text>Fever Dreams (2004) is an album by the American ambient musician Steve Roach. The music consists of bizarre, hallucinatory textures and tribal percussion. The first track, &quot;Wicked Dream&quot;, was co-composed with Patrick O&#x27;Hearn.

This album is continued with &quot;Holding the Space – Fever Dreams II&quot;.

==Concept==
When Roach had arrived home after one of his many extended trips to Australia, he had also caught a rare virus native to the country just before his flight. As a result, Roach underwent a series of hallucinations as internal temperatures rose to heights of 107 °F. After 3 weeks, Roach had made a full recovery.

When asked at a later appearance, Roach stated that &quot;After the fever I couldn&#x27;t wait to get started on &quot;Fever Dreams&quot;. It was a very intense experience, and I think now I&#x27;ll be able to harness that kind of experience into this album.&quot; Since the fever, Roach has taken measures to apply any necessary immunities before any more of his trips.

<doc id="910691" wikidata="Q1026837" url="?curid=910691" title="California Memorial Stadium">
<text>California Memorial Stadium, also known simply and commonly as Memorial Stadium, is an outdoor college football stadium on the West Coast of the United States, located on the campus of the University of California in Berkeley, California. It is the home field for the California Golden Bears of the Atlantic Coast Conference (beginning in the fall of 2024).

Opened in 1923, the venue currently seats around 63,000 for football; its playing field runs northwest to southeast at an approximate elevation of above sea level. It has been named one of the top college football stadiums by various publications,&quot;&quot; and it was listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places on November 27, 2006.

Memorial Stadium was funded from public contributions, as a memorial to Californians who lost their lives in World War I (1917–18). The chair of the architectural committee was John Galen Howard, the university&#x27;s chief architect, and his influence is evident in the stadium&#x27;s neoclassical motif. In addition to its unique architecture, the stadium&#x27;s position at the foot of the Berkeley Hills provides top row spectators with panoramic views of San Francisco Bay and west side viewers with views of the Berkeley Hills and Strawberry Canyon. This has earned it a reputation as one of the most scenic venues in college football.

Traditionally, during all football games and especially during the Big Game against Stanford, the hill overlooking the eastern side of Memorial Stadium attracts spectators hoping to watch a game for free, earning the nickname &quot;Tightwad Hill&quot;.
==Before Memorial Stadium==

===West Field===
On February 14, 1885, the first football game was played on the University of California campus between the hometown Bears and a football club from San Francisco known as the Merions. The field was located where the Valley Life Sciences Building currently stands (), and the game drew some 450 spectators. In subsequent years, the field was officially named West Field and seating capacity was expanded to around 5,000. However, by 1904, California&#x27;s football team had become so popular that West Field became too small, therefore, the university decided to build a new stadium with an excess of 20,000 seats.

===California Field===
California Field opened its doors in 1904 to replace the antiquated West Field and the boosted capacity allowed California to host important games for the first time. While playing at West Field, the Bears played important games (namely the Big Game) at neutral site venues in San Francisco and with a new over 20,000-seat stadium, California was able to host the first Big Game played outside of San Francisco. The new stadium was located much closer to the center of campus (where Hearst Gymnasium now stands) and was able to draw unprecedented crowds for the time. California Field is also notable because it is where many of California&#x27;s longstanding traditions began to take form. In 1910, the first card stunt was performed at the Big Game and after victories, the students would &quot;serpentine&quot; around the field—something that is mentioned in the song &quot;Big C&quot;. California Field is also where the Golden Bears gained national prominence under head coach Andrew Latham Smith. Four of the Bears&#x27; five consecutive undefeated seasons were played at California Field; the stadium was home to three of California&#x27;s four straight claimed national championships. Because of this success, it became evident that California needed an even larger venue to host its football team; therefore, the team and its fans began pushing for a new stadium.

===The drive to build Memorial Stadium===
The early 1920s saw four major collegiate venues open in the State of California: Stanford Stadium, the Rose Bowl, the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, and California Memorial Stadium. With the success of the California football program and the openings of the new football venues for Stanford and USC, the campus community was nearly unanimous in its desire to see the Bears get a new stadium of their own. One of the first proposals for a new stadium was on the south-western corner of the campus where Edwards Stadium and Evans Diamond currently stand. This proposal was eventually rejected and the regents settled on a site at the mouth of Strawberry Canyon. The location caused considerable controversy, with objections rising from local community arguing that it would &quot;ruin the beauty of the canyon, destroy the canyon as a natural biological laboratory for the University, and create traffic and transportation problems.&quot; There were also protests from homeowners whose homes would be demolished, as well as those whose views would be blocked by the building. However, the popularity of Andy Smith&#x27;s &quot;Wonder Teams&quot; prevailed and fundraising began in 1922.

The $1 million stadium was funded completely by 10,000 seat subscriptions at $100 per subscription, the fundraising drive through these subscriptions was a complete success having sold out in less than ten days. With the funding secured, the university broke ground in January 1923 hoping to open the new stadium in time for the 1923 Big Game.

=== Construction ===
Because the stadium would be directly atop the Hayward Fault, it was constructed out of two halves, the eastern side was built into the hills, while the west side contained the main structure built in the neo-classical architecture style to resemble the Roman Coliseum. Expansion joints were placed where the two sides connected, allowing them to separately move during an earthquake. During the construction 2,500 pine trees were planted on what became known as the Tightwad Hill.

==Original California Memorial Stadium: 1923–2010==
===History===
California played its first seven games of the 1923 season at old California Field preparing to open the new 75,000-seat stadium at Strawberry Canyon for the final game of the season—the Big Game—against Stanford. Both teams were having a good season in 1923 with California going undefeated up to that point (with a tie to Nevada) and Stanford going into the Big Game with a record of 7–1. Leading up to the first game at Memorial Stadium, some in the media suggested to Bears coach Andy Smith that the opening of new stadiums was cursed: Stanford lost the first game played at Stanford Stadium while USC lost the inaugural game of both the Rose Bowl and the Los Angeles Coliseum. Smith simply replied, &quot;Why, of course they did, it was always California they invited to help dedicate their stadiums.&quot; The Bears went on to win the inaugural game at California Memorial Stadium by a final score of 9–0, beating Stanford for the fifth straight year and securing their fourth straight undefeated season.

When California Memorial Stadium opened in 1923, the permanent capacity of the venue was around 75,000 and expandable to around 85,000. For important games, the university would bring out temporary bleachers that would stand around the eastern rim of the stadium. It was during this time, that California set their all-time attendance record in 1947 with an announced crowd of 83,000 for a game against Navy.
As the California football team&#x27;s fortunes on the field began to fall in the second half of the century and there was a demand for wheelchair seating along the eastern rim, the university did away with the temporary bleachers bringing the stadium&#x27;s maximum football capacity back down to the permanent capacity of 75,000.

Due to the seismic vulnerability of the old press box, the University of California dismantled the structure and installed a temporary facility that stood until the 2010 season. The installation of the temporary press box brought the stadium&#x27;s capacity down to 73,347 and then down to 72,516 for the 2004 season. California brought the seating capacity further down to 67,537 with tarps being placed over four sections (one in each corner). The university did remove the tarps, however, for important games allowing a full 72,516 to attend. Because of safety concerns, the university brought the capacity down to 71,799 for the 2008 season.

After the 2010 season, the entire west side of the bowl was demolished and rebuilt. The stands in the original stadium descended right down to the football field, and the view from the lowest midfield seats on the west side could be blocked by the standing visiting team members. To eliminate this problem, the surface of the field was lowered four feet to allow unobstructed seats in the first few rows during the 2010-12 renovation. The capacity of the refurbished stadium is now 63,186, and was sold out for the first game of the 2012 season in a 31-24 Cal loss against the University of Nevada Wolf Pack.

===Capacity===


===Other major events===
California Memorial Stadium has seen a number of major events throughout the years other than California football. Before 1970, the general commencement exercises of the University of California were regularly held at Memorial Stadium. The large campus-wide commencement, however, was cancelled in 1970 because of the many protests that were taking place at the time—university officials at the time did not see it wise to have such a large gathering annually with the protests going on. General Commencements have since returned to the University of California campus, with the exercises being performed at Memorial Stadium, Haas Pavilion, Hearst Greek Theatre, and most recently Edwards Stadium. On March 23, 1962, to commemorate Charter Day (the anniversary of the founding of the University of California), President John F. Kennedy gave a speech at Memorial Stadium in front of an above capacity crowd of 88,000.

====Soccer====
Real Madrid and Inter Milan played at Memorial Stadium on July 26, 2014, one of their matches in the 2014 International Champions Cup. The match, played before a sold-out crowd of 62,583, ended in a 1–1 tie after regulation and Inter Milan won the shootout 3–2. The usual artificial turf was converted and this match was played on natural grass.
====Oakland Raiders====
The NFL&#x27;s Oakland Raiders played their second game of the 1973 regular season at Memorial Stadium. The game against the defending Super Bowl champion Miami Dolphins was moved from the Raiders&#x27; regular home, the Oakland Coliseum, because of a scheduling conflict with the Oakland Athletics, who hosted the Minnesota Twins at the Coliseum the following night. The Raiders ended the Dolphins&#x27; NFL record 18-game winning streak with a 12–7 victory on four field goals by 45-year-old George Blanda on September 23. Several preseason games were also played at the stadium in the early 1970s.

Ultimately, in response to traffic and parking issues associated with these games (while Cal games drew a large number of students who live on or near campus and walk to the games, Raider games attracted fans from a larger geographic area who were used to tailgating at the Coliseum and were more likely to drive to games), the City of Berkeley passed a Professional Sports Events License Tax in which the city collected 10% of all gate receipts, making the staging of professional games inside the city cost-prohibitive. The Raiders were granted an injunction from the city collecting the tax, arguing that the tax was a regulatory measure rather than a revenue measure, and was therefore an improper regulation on land held in trust by the Regents of the University of California. However, the grant of the injunction was reversed by the California Court of Appeals, who found it to be a revenue measure, despite the fact that the city had made the measure immediately effective &quot;due to danger to the public peace, health, and safety of the City of Berkeley as a result of the holding of professional sports events there.&quot;

===Playing surface===
Originally a natural grass field, AstroTurf was installed in Memorial Stadium in 1981 and remained for fourteen seasons. Natural grass returned in 1995, and varsity football practices were held at Witter Rugby Field, saving the stadium&#x27;s grass field for game days only. In 2003, Momentum Turf, an infilled artificial turf similar to FieldTurf, was installed. This allowed for minimal maintenance and increased utilization of the stadium, for football practices and other sports, on the space-limited campus. The field is also marked for international soccer, but this wider dimension allows little reserve room beyond the official lines.

==Renovation: 2010–2012==

===Need for renovation===

The Hayward Fault passes directly under the playing field of Memorial Stadium (nearly from goal post to goal post.), where right-lateral strike-slip motion is shifting the east half of the building to the south at a rate of 1.2 mm/yr; during its construction, expansion joints had been placed in the walls of the stadium to maintain the integrity of the building. A 1998 seismic safety study on the California campus gave the stadium a &quot;poor&quot; rating (meaning that the building represents an &quot;appreciable life hazard&quot; in an earthquake), and estimated the cost of making the structure safe at $14 million. Because the stadium is on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places and because of the nostalgia that surrounds the site, the university decided that a retrofit and renovation (as opposed to building a new stadium elsewhere) would be the best scenario for the California football program. In February 2005, Chancellor Robert Birgeneau announced plans to renovate Memorial Stadium, improving the existing facilities and creating a safer environment for the fans as well as the people that work at the stadium. HNTB Architecture and STUDIOS Architecture were the architects for the renovation of the stadium and the new Simpson Center for Student-Athlete High Performance.

===Phase I===
Phase I consisted of building the Simpson Center for Student-Athlete High Performance next to the west wall of the stadium. The center was built to be the home of football and 12 of California&#x27;s Olympic sports that were previously housed in Memorial Stadium. The center saw the construction of new locker rooms, offices meeting rooms, training and sports medicine facilities, and an academic center in the SAHPC. The roof of the athletic center also acts as a pedestrian plaza. Phase I of the renovations were originally scheduled to begin the spring and summer of 2006 but was delayed by a court injunction due to three lawsuits against the project. A small group of tree-sitters occupied the oak grove on the west side of the stadium beginning on the &quot;Big Game&quot; day in December 2006 but in September 2008 the court injunction was lifted, the protesters came down, and construction of the athletic center began. The Simpson Center for Student-Athlete High Performance (originally SAHPC) opened in the Fall of 2011 and became 100% operational in January 2012.

===Phase II===

On January 19, 2010, the UC Board of Regents approved the retrofit and renovation of California Memorial Stadium. The $321 million project commenced in June 2010 and was completed in time for the 2012 season. The Bears played at AT&amp;T Park in San Francisco for the 2011 season while the renovations were being made.
The west side of the stadium was demolished and rebuilt except for the outer wall. Club levels, a new press box, bathrooms and concession stands were added. The surface of the field was lowered four feet to improve the view from the lowest midfield seats on the west side, which previously were blocked by standing visiting team members.
A surface rupture block was placed in each end zone where the fault line passes through the stadium. These blocks can move independently from the rest of the stadium and were built on top of three feet of sand and plastic sheets. Expansion joints were placed between the surface rupture blocks and the rest of the stadium.

===Phase III===
Phase III of the Memorial Stadium renovation and retrofit is the renovation of the stadium&#x27;s east side by adding modern amenities to that side of the stadium. Originally, this part of the project was to begin in the Fall of 2009, but because of the delay of phase II, the east side&#x27;s improvements have been delayed indefinitely. The eventual improvements on the east side of the stadium called for an extension of the concourse to wrap around the stadium, new restrooms, ADA seating, and vendors.

==Renovation financing==

For the stadium&#x27;s $321 million renovation and a new $153 million Student-Athlete High Performance Center, the university incurred a controversial $445 million of debt, which it planned to finance with the sale of special stadium seats in the Endowment Seating Program. Before the start of the stadium reconstruction, Professor Brian Barsky showed that the financial plan was unrealistic and calculated that although $215 million had been claimed to have been raised as of January 15, 2010, the true figure was closer to only about $20 million as of December 2010, and that the total financial obligation including interest would exceed a billion dollars.
 
His calculations were subsequently corroborated by the Wall Street Journal, which reported in April 2012 that only $31 million had been received as of the end of December 2011; this was followed by further reporting of poor seat sales in the Endowment Seating Program. As of June 30, 2016, the fund balance was $60.98 million, far short of the $215 million that had been claimed five years earlier. The roughly $18 million interest-only annual payments on the debt consumes 20% of Cal&#x27;s athletics budget and 15% of the campus structural deficit; principal repayment begins in 2032 when the annual debt payment will rise to about $26 million per year, about $28 million in 2033, about $30 million per year for 2034–2038, and about $37 million per year for 2039–2044. The debt payments are scheduled to continue for 100 years from its 2013 inception, concluding in 2113. On November 3, 2017, Chancellor Carol Christ announced that the university would overtake the earthquake retrofitting expenses part of the renovation. This amount is estimated to be approximately 60 percent of the total expenses or $200 million with the remaining expenses still being retained by the athletic department. Exactly where in the budget the funds would be taken was not announced, although the chancellor did state that they would not be taken out of student tuition or tax-payer funds for the university. It was not ruled out that the money could be taken out of funds for academic departments.

==Renovated California Memorial Stadium: 2012–present==

===Opening ceremony===

The University of California reopened the stadium on September 1, 2012, for a home football game against the University of Nevada. This was the first football game in Berkeley since the end of the 2010 season. The sellout crowd of 63,186 watched the Nevada Wolf Pack spoil the grand re-opening with a 31–24 victory, Cal&#x27;s first loss to Nevada at home since before the original stadium opened in 1923. There were many noticeable differences between the new, more modern stadium and the old stadium that closed in 2010. Except the historic façade, the entire west side of the stadium was demolished, allowing the university to make the venue seismically safe, and add modern amenities. Most noticeable changes included club seating, along with a new pressbox, atop the western stands. The east side, however, has remained relatively unchanged. The stadium was originally dedicated to the memory of those Californians that were lost in World War I, and on October 6, 2012, the university rededicated California Memorial Stadium in the memory of all Californians who sacrificed their lives in service to the nation.

===Capacity===
Because of the inclusion of seat back and bench back seating in the same footprint as before, the renovation and retrofit reduced the seating capacity by around 10,000 seats. Original estimates stated that the official stadium capacity would be around 63,000–65,000, down from the 71,799 capacity that Memorial Stadium had in 2010. Capacity at the beginning of the 2012 season ended up at 63,186. Since 2022, the four southernmost sections have been tarped off, and a terrace was built in the middle, connected to the concourse.

2012–present: 63,186&lt;br&gt;Estimate during construction: 62,717

===Playing surface===
The playing field was lowered to improve sight lines, and surfaced with Matrix Turf, an artificial turf with crumb rubber infill along with a silica pea gravel base to allow improved field drainage. In 2017, the playing surface was changed to FieldTurf as part of Cal&#x27;s transition to its new partnership with Under Armour. In 2023, the turf was replaced with sod, and the endzones became gold, likely to Cal&#x27;s new partnership with Nike.

===Kabam naming rights===
In December 2013, Cal Athletics announced a 15-year $18 million naming rights deal with Kabam, at the time the largest naming rights agreement in the history of college athletics. Under the agreement, the field was called Kabam Field at California Memorial Stadium. In July 2017, Kabam pulled out of the deal.

===FTX naming rights===
In August 2021, Cal Athletics announced a 10-year $17.5 million naming rights deal with FTX. Under the agreement the field was known officially as FTX Field at California Memorial Stadium. In November 2022, the deal was suspended and FTX&#x27;s logo was removed from the field surface amid FTX&#x27;s bankruptcy.

==Proposal for city name change==
&quot;Tshwane&quot; is the Setswana name of the Apies River, which flows through the city. The origin of the name of the river is unclear. It may mean &quot;place &quot;-e&quot; of the black cow, &quot;tshwana&quot;, from ceremonies where a black cow was sprinkled with water from the river to end a drought.

Two other common explanations are demonstrably untrue. One is that it is the Tswana for the motto of Tshwane Municipality, &quot;We are the same&quot;. However, this appears to be promoted only for its emotional value; if anything, it would mean &quot;we are not the same&quot; in Tswana (&quot;ga re tshwane&quot;). Another common misunderstanding is that it is the Tswana word for &quot;little monkeys&quot;; although &quot;Tshwane&quot; resembles &quot;tshwene&quot; (the Tswana word for baboon), baboons are not little and the words are not the same. &quot;Little monkeys&quot; is actually a translation of the &quot;Afrikaans&quot; name &quot;Apies&quot;.
In 2005, politicians in the South African capital voted to rename the city Tshwane and retain the name Pretoria for the city centre only.
The &quot;Sunday Times&quot; used the word &quot;Tshwane&quot; to refer to the Pretoria area for a short period in 2005. The state-controlled SABC also started using the term in its evening news broadcasts, for a period, but by 2010, had reverted to &quot;Pretoria&quot;. Private media outlets continued to refer to the metropolitan area as Pretoria. The &quot;Pretoria News&quot;, the main newspaper in the metropolitan area did not appear to have plans to change its name as of early 2006, although it has adopted the slogan &quot;The paper for the people of Tshwane&quot;. 
On 21 May 2005, the Pretoria Civil Action Committee, a group consisting of business, labour, cultural, civil and political leaders opposed to the name change organised a protest in the Pretoria city centre. They marched to the office of Arts and Culture Minister Pallo Jordan and handed him a petition signed by 3,000 University of Pretoria students as well as other petition documents. Former president FW De Klerk, a Nobel prize winner and the last president under apartheid, also raised concerns about the change.

In November 2005, the Advertising Standards Authority found that advertising proclaiming that Tshwane, rather than Pretoria, was the capital of South Africa was misleading.

===Proposed renaming of Pretoria===
On 5 December 2000, a number of former Pretoria municipalities, as well as others that fell outside the Greater Pretoria area, were combined into one area called the City of Tshwane Metropolitan Municipality. The city of Pretoria remained largely intact in this municipality. On 26 May 2005, the South African Geographical Names Council unanimously approved a recommendation by the Tshwane Metro Council that the name Pretoria be changed to Tshwane, but approval from the Geographical Names Council is only a preliminary step in the process.

The legal process involved is as follows:
# Recommendation to the Geographical Names Council.
# Council approves/rejects recommendation (approved 26 May 2005).
# Council gives its recommendation to the Arts and Culture Minister.
# Minister approves/rejects recommendation.
# Approved/rejected name is published in the Government Gazette.
# Any person or body unhappy with the name change can complain within one month of above.
# The minister can consult the Geographical Names Council with concerns raised.
# The minister&#x27;s decision, along with the reasons for it, are published
# The minister will then take the matter before parliament where the central government will decide on whether to change the name or not based on the information before it.

Some groups attached themselves to the Pretoria name change issue, including the trade union Solidarity, which, along with the Pretoria Civil Action Committee, threatened legal action should the name change be recommended by the minister. In early August 2007, it was reported in the press that the municipality, after consulting with the Gauteng provincial government had withdrawn the application to change the name, and was instead contemplating a plan to change all road signs pointing to &quot;Pretoria&quot; to &quot;Tshwane&quot; or the &quot;City of Tshwane&quot; across the country. This plan raised threats of legal action from both political groupings opposed to the renaming, and concerns from municipal officials about the possibility of vandalism to the proposed signs.

In 2010, the Ministry of Arts and Culture prepared to publish the registration of Tshwane as a place name, in the Government Gazette. However, the registration was withdrawn at the last minute, which was explained by the minister. Although it was too late to remove the name from printing in the &quot;Government Gazette&quot;, the retraction of the name registration was published the following week in the gazette. In November 2011, Kgosientso Ramokgopa, who had been elected mayor earlier that year, vowed to push forward with the renaming in 2012.

==Management and corruption==
As in other parts of the country, the Tshwane Metropolitan Municipality experiences high levels of corruption. Significant resources of the Special Investigation Unit (SIU) were dedicated to this region since 2010. The screening of applicants for management positions has also been criticized.

When, by November 2020, businesses and residents owed the metro R12 billion, the metro outsourced its credit management to 34 debt collecting agencies after normal means were ineffectual. This was expected to increase the metro&#x27;s income levels, cash flow and capacity for service delivery. In 2021, its debt with Eskom stood at over R200 million, and the utility labeled it as a municipality with a poor payment record. When in August 2022 its debt stood at R1.152 billion, Eskom warned that the city&#x27;s electricity may be disconnected.

In February 2022, its debtors book stood at R17 billion and Tshwane implemented the &quot;Tshwane Yatima&quot; project to disconnect the power and/or water supply to 420 businesses, besides that of some state departments (Public Works and Infrastructure owing R355 million) and embassies, SARS, the Navy and SAPS headquarters and Hatfield Gautrain station due to non-payment of their electricity or municipal accounts. The University of Pretoria paid the bill of its Hillcrest campus under protest at the last minute.

Among the private homes, the village proper contains the Queensville Cemetery, a post office, a United Church of Canada, and a complex containing a fire hall, a community centre, a public park with softball diamond, tennis courts and playground. Guy Paul Morin and Christine Jessop were neighbours in Queensville in 1984, and John Candy once owned a home approximately 1 km south of Queensville.

At one time, there were plans to build Ontario&#x27;s first private university in Queensville. The site for the proposed university would have been east of Leslie on the north side of Queensville side road. It was expected that the university would occupy and employ 1,000 people.

Queensville was home to the largest Antique Mall in York Region. The mall closed in the fall of 2019.

<doc id="910717" wikidata="Q7767594" url="?curid=910717" title="The Swan (TV series)">
<text>The Swan is an American reality television series broadcast by the Fox Broadcasting Company (Fox). It premiered on April 7, 2004, while its eighteenth and final episode aired on December 20, 2004. The series was hosted by Irish television presenter Amanda Byram.

&quot;The Swan&quot; has garnered negative reception from critics and audiences. Criticism of the series often focused on the promotion of a negative body image for women. Despite the negative reception, &quot;The Swan&quot; premiered to high ratings and averaged around 9 million viewers over the course of its first season. Since its conclusion, most contestants have voiced satisfaction with their participation in the series. According to producers, the show&#x27;s purpose was to increase the self-esteem of its contestants. In 2013, Fox announced plans to revive the series as a two-hour television special titled Celebrity Swan, but as of 2018 it was no longer in development.

==Premise==
Each episode of the series followed two self-proclaimed &quot;ugly ducklings&quot; who, over the course of a three-month period, experienced an extreme makeover from a team that included a personal trainer, therapist, dentist, and cosmetic surgeons. Whichever woman was deemed more attractive at the end of the three months would move forward to compete in a beauty pageant held at the end of the season. Following the pageant, whichever contestant received the most votes for the greatest transformation would be given the title &quot;The Swan&quot;.

==Production==
In 2005, Rebecca Hertz, a writer of the series, admitted that the series&#x27; staff manufactured dialogue and situations throughout the editing process. Hertz claimed that she falsely made it appear as though contestant Rachel Love-Fraser&#x27;s husband was unhappily married to her, stating, &quot;In a pre-interview, I led her husband to say Rachel looks average, but he thought she looked beautiful. I cut it down to him saying she looks average, so he sounded like a mean, horrible a–hole. He was furious when he saw the show&quot;.

==Series overview==

==Reception==
===Television viewership and ratings===
The series premiered to 15 million viewers.

===Critical response===
The series received a negative reception from television critics. Gillian Flynn of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; claimed the series was &quot;a misogynistic mix of TV&#x27;s twin vices: commercialism and conformity.&quot; &quot;USA Today&quot;″s Robert Bianco believed the series to be &quot;[h]urtful and repellent even by reality&#x27;s constantly plummeting standards,&quot; further describing it as an advertisement for plastic surgery. &quot;Variety&quot;″s Brian Lowry similarly claimed that the series glorified plastic surgery; however, he praised its graphics and music. Gaby Wood of &quot;The Guardian&quot; criticized the series&#x27;s premise, stating, &quot;the winner on &quot;The Swan&quot; is the woman who is thought to have undergone the greatest &#x27;overall transformation&#x27; — in other words, the one who appears least like her former self.&quot;

Journalist Jennifer Pozner, in her book &quot;Reality Bites Back&quot;, calls &quot;The Swan&quot; &quot;the most sadistic reality series of the decade&quot;. Journalist Chris Hedges also criticized the show in his 2009 book &quot;Empire of Illusion&quot;, writing &quot;&quot;The Swan&quot;&#x27;s transparent message is that once these women have been surgically &#x27;corrected&#x27; to resemble mainstream celebrity beauty as closely as possible, their problems will be solved&quot;. Feminist scholar Susan J. Douglas criticized the show in her book &quot;The Rise of Enlightened Sexism&quot; for its continuation of a negative female body image, claiming that the series showed &quot;the narrow physical standards to which women are expected to conform, the sad degree to which women internalize these standards, the lengths needed to get there, and the impossibility for most of us to meet the bar without, well, taking a box cutter to our faces and bodies&quot;. Author Alice Marwick described the show as &quot;body culture media&quot;, in which plastic surgery is framed as &quot;a morally correct solution to personal problems&quot;.

===Cultural impact===
In 2013, second-season contestant Lorrie Arias spoke publicly about problems she attributed to her participation in &quot;The Swan&quot;, including unresolved surgery complications and mental health problems she says were exacerbated by her appearance on the program.

In 2010, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; ranked the program the worst reality television show ever produced.

It was also the subject of the first episode of the 2024 VICE docuseries &quot;Dark Side of Reality TV&quot;.

<text>A Browser Helper Object (BHO) is a DLL module designed as a plugin for the Microsoft Internet Explorer web browser to provide added functionality. BHOs were introduced in October 1997 with the release of version 4 of Internet Explorer. Most BHOs are loaded once by each new instance of Internet Explorer. However, in the case of Windows Explorer, a new instance is launched for each window.

BHOs are still supported as of Windows 10, through Internet Explorer 11, while BHOs are not supported in Microsoft Edge.

== Implementation ==
Each time a new instance of Internet Explorer starts, it checks the Windows Registry for the key &quot;HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\Browser Helper Objects&quot;. If Internet Explorer finds this key in the registry, it looks for a CLSID key listed below the key. The CLSID keys under Browser Helper Objects tell the browser which BHOs to load. Removing the registry key prevents the BHO from being loaded. For each CLSID that is listed below the BHO key, Internet Explorer calls CoCreateInstance to start the instance of the BHO in the same process space as the browser. If the BHO is started and implements the IObjectWithSite interface, it can control and receive events from Internet Explorer. BHOs can be created in any language that supports COM.

== Examples ==
Some modules enable the display of different file formats not ordinarily interpretable by the browser. The Adobe Acrobat plug-in that allows Internet Explorer users to read PDF files within their browser is a BHO.

Other modules add toolbars to Internet Explorer, such as the Alexa Toolbar that provides a list of web sites related to the one you are currently browsing, or the Google Toolbar that adds a toolbar with a Google search box to the browser user interface.

The Conduit toolbars are based on a BHO that can be used on Internet Explorer 7 and up. This BHO provides a search facility that connects to Microsoft&#x27;s Bing search.

== Concerns ==
The BHO API exposes hooks that allow the BHO to access the Document Object Model (DOM) of the current page and to control navigation. Because BHOs have unrestricted access to the Internet Explorer event model, some forms of malware (such as adware and spyware) have also been created as BHOs.

For example, the Download.ject malware is a BHO that is activated when a secure HTTP connection is made to a financial institution, then begins to record keystrokes for the purpose of capturing user passwords. The MyWay Searchbar tracks users&#x27; browsing patterns and passes the information it records to third parties. The C2.LOP malware adds links and popups of its own to web pages in order to drive users to pay-per-click websites.

Many BHOs introduce visible changes to a browser&#x27;s interface, such as installing toolbars in Internet Explorer and the like, but others run without any change to the interface. This renders it easy for malicious coders to conceal the actions of their browser add-on, especially since, after being installed, the BHO seldom requires permission before performing further actions. For instance, variants of the ClSpring trojan use BHOs to install scripts to provide a number of instructions to be performed such as adding and deleting registry values and downloading additional executable files, all completely transparently to the user.

In response to the problems associated with BHOs and similar extensions to Internet Explorer, Microsoft debuted an &quot;Add-on Manager&quot; in Internet Explorer 6 with the release of Service Pack 2 for Windows XP (updating it to IE6 Security Version 1, a.k.a. SP2). This utility displays a list of all installed BHOs, browser extensions and ActiveX controls, and allows the user to enable or disable them at will. There are also free tools (such as BHODemon) that list installed BHOs and allow the user to disable malicious extensions. Spybot S&amp;D advanced mode has a similar tool built in to allow the user to disable installed BHO.

<text>Northern Kentucky University is a public university in Highland Heights, Kentucky, United States. Established in 1968, it is the youngest of Kentucky&#x27;s eight public universities. The university has seven constituent colleges in arts and science, business, education, informatics, health, and the Salmon P. Chase College of Law.

==History==
Northern Kentucky University began in 1948, when an extension campus for the University of Kentucky was opened in Covington, Kentucky, known as the UK Northern Extension Center. After 20 years in operation as an extension center for UK, it became an autonomous four-year college under the name Northern Kentucky State College (NKSC). In 1970, W. Frank Steely was hired as the first president. The following year, the Salmon P. Chase College of Law, formerly an independent law school in Cincinnati, merged with Northern Kentucky State College. The main campus moved from Covington to Highland Heights, Kentucky, in 1972. NKSC awarded its first bachelor&#x27;s degrees in 1973. Rapid expansion resulted in the school being upgraded to university status in 1976.

Since its founding in 1968 and elevation to university status in 1976, Northern Kentucky University has expanded with construction projects, new colleges and a larger, more diverse student body. The university has increased its admissions standards.

===Presidents===
==Campus==

Northern Kentucky University&#x27;s main campus in Highland Heights, Kentucky, is situated on of rolling countryside along U.S. Route 27, just off of Interstate 275 and Interstate 471, seven miles (11 km) southeast of Cincinnati, Ohio. The campus was built beginning in the early 1970s, and the first building, Nunn Hall, opened in 1972. Although most of the university&#x27;s students commute daily to the campus, approximately 2,000 students live on campus. In recent years, the university has been in the process of expanding its campus and facilities. The Truist Arena is a 9,400-seat arena completed in 2008. It serves as the primary venue for athletics on campus, and also as a venue for entertainment. A Student Union building opened in 2008. The Landrum Academic Center houses an Anthropology Museum. The university campus is also the first educational institute in the world to have a laser-projection planetarium; it is part of the Dorothy Westerman Hermann Natural Science Center.

The campus located in Covington, Kentucky, closed in 2008. It mainly served nontraditional and adult students and also hosted the Program for Adult-Centered Education and Emergency Medical Technology programs. Northern Kentucky University&#x27;s Grant County Center, located in Williamstown, is a partnership between the Grant County Foundation for Higher Education and Northern Kentucky University.

The Japanese Language School of Greater Cincinnati is a weekend supplementary Japanese school held at the Mathematics, Education and Psychology Center (MP), formerly known as the Business Education Psychology (BEP) Building. It was scheduled to move to NKU in July 1993.

===Libraries===
Northern Kentucky&#x27;s main library is the W. Frank Steely Library, completed in 1975 and named after the first president of the university. The library contains over 850,000 volumes, more than 18,000 bound periodicals, and approximately 1.4 million microforms. The two-floor Chase Law Library is Northern Kentucky&#x27;s other library on campus, contains more than 313,000 volumes and 57,000 monographic and serial titles.

===Civic engagement===
Corporate and university partnerships include The Scripps Howard Center for Civic Engagement the Fifth/Third Entrepreneurial Center the Metropolitan Education and Training Services Center, the Center for Applied Informatics, and Fidelity Investments. Other centers on campus include the Center for Applied Anthropology, the Institute for Freedom Studies, the Center for Environmental Restoration the Small Business Development Center the Institute for New Economy Technologies the Center for Environmental Education the Center for Integrative Natural Science and Mathematics and the Chase Local Government Law Center.

==Academics==


Northern Kentucky University&#x27;s academic programs are organized into seven colleges. The College of Informatics, founded in 2006, replaced the College of Professional Studies. In July 2015, the School of the Arts was created, uniting the Music, Theatre &amp; Dance, and Visual Arts programs within the College of Arts &amp; Sciences. In 2018, the former Honors Program became the Honors College.
* College of Arts and Sciences
** School of the Arts
* Haile College of Business

Northern Kentucky University students are also a part of individual chapters in numerous honor societies. Northern Kentucky&#x27;s Alpha Beta Phi chapter of Phi Alpha Theta, the International History Honor Society, has won 18 consecutive best chapter awards.

===Admissions===
Northern Kentucky University only considers for admission applicants with a 2.0 or above unweighted high school GPA, those with a 2.75 and greater unweighted high school GPA are admitted regardless of ACT or SAT scores, and the university has a 90% acceptance rate. For those submitting test scores, the 2021–2022 final release data by IPEDS reflects scores of admitted students that were 1020-1240 for the SAT and 20-26 for the ACT.

==Student life==

There are several fraternities and sororities on campus. There is a Student Government Association.

&quot;The Northerner&quot; is Northern Kentucky&#x27;s student-run newspaper. The university is also home to an independent, student-run Internet radio station Norse Code Radio. Northern Kentucky University formerly hosted the award-winning public radio station, WNKU, founded in 1986, until the station was sold in 2017.

NorseMediaTV is the PEG access Public-access television cable TV station run by Northern Kentucky University. It airs on channel 818 on Cincinnati Bell Fioptics cable and 18 digital/96 analog on Insight Cable of Northern Kentucky. NorseMediaTV students and faculty produce many original programs, a weekly talk show, various sporting events, and entertainment programming. Many NorseMedia programs have won awards at the local (Blue Chips), regional (Philos) and national (Telly) levels, usually in the professional categories. Students in the program at NKU are invited to create and assist in producing the Electronic Media &amp; Broadcasting programs for the station.

==Athletics==

The university&#x27;s teams for both men and women are nicknamed &quot;Norse&quot;. Their mascot is named Victor E. Viking. Northern Kentucky University joined the Horizon League on July 1, 2015, after leaving the Atlantic Sun Conference. The 2016–17 school year was the first in which NKU is eligible for NCAA Division I championships, following the completion of its four-year reclassification period to D-I.

<text>The Chilkoot Trail is a 33-mile (53 km) trail through the Coast Mountains that leads from Dyea, Alaska, in the United States, to Bennett, British Columbia, in Canada. It was a major access route from the coast to Yukon goldfields in the late 1890s. The trail became obsolete in 1899 when a railway was built from Dyea&#x27;s neighbor port Skagway along the parallel White Pass trail.

The U.S. portion of the Chilkoot Trail and Dyea Site were designated a National Historic Landmark in 1978, following creation of Klondike Gold Rush National Historical Park in 1976. In 1987, the B.C. portion of the trail was designated Chilkoot Trail National Historic Site. In 1998, the centennial of the gold rush, the National Historic Site in British Columbia joined with the U.S. National Historical Park to form Klondike Gold Rush International Historical Park. In 2022, the portion of the trail in Alaska was designated Chilkoot National Historic Trail, part of the National Trails System.

==History==
===Indigenous use===
Tlingit Indigenous people used the trail as a vital trade route to trade for resources available in the interior. As pressures from American settlers and the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company weakened the traditional Tlingit trading system, the Chilkoot Trail slowly became utilized by explorers and prospectors.

The name &quot;Chilkoot Trail&quot; is a partial translation of the trail&#x27;s Tlingit name, namely &quot;Chilkoot Dei•yi&quot;, which means &quot;Chilkoot-owned Trail&quot;. The trail&#x27;s English name omits the reference to ownership. In addition, the second word of &quot;Chilkoot Dei•yi&quot; sounds like the name for the village of Dyea. Prior publications state that &quot;Dyea&quot; was derived from &quot;to pack&quot; [&quot;yaa&quot;] or &quot;carrying place&quot; [&quot;yaa yé&quot;]. However, the presence of the initial \d\ sound in &quot;Dyea&quot; casts doubt on those latter possibilities, and suggests that the first syllable had been &quot;dei&quot; (as in &quot;dei-yi&quot;).

===Klondike era===
The Klondike Gold Rush (1896–1899) transformed the Chilkoot Trail into a mainstream transportation route to Canada&#x27;s interior. The gold rush was primarily focused in the region around Dawson City in Yukon and the Yukon River. Of the several overland routes, the Chilkoot Trail was the most direct, least expensive, and, soon enough, most popular.

The other primary route to the headwaters of the Yukon River, however, was also based out of Skagway: the rival White Pass route. The White Pass route was slightly longer but less rigorous and steep, whereas the Chilkoot was shorter and more difficult. Skagway, because of its deepwater harbor, served as the principal port for both routes (nearby Dyea, the beginning of the Chilkoot Trail, was built on the extensive, shallow Taiya River delta).

Prospectors who chose the Chilkoot were ferried to Dyea by small boat or ferry. Soon, both Skagway and Dyea were bustling tent cities as sensationalist headlines of the gold rush spurred men from across the United States to leave their jobs and families and gain passage up the Inside Passage to Skagway.

As it became apparent that many of the prospectors who chose the Chilkoot simply were not going to survive the arduous terrain and harsh weather, Canada&#x27;s North-West Mounted Police (now the Royal Canadian Mounted Police) declared that prospectors could only enter Canada if they had at least one ton of gear, enough to supply a prospector for one year (the Klondike supply list).

Prospectors ferried the gear from campsites along the trail, slowly moving closer to the headwaters of the Yukon. With all the equipment and supplies being transported, alternative methods, especially those with a little supplemental income, sprouted up. Many prospectors purchased pack animals (although that method was more commonly used on the rival White Pass), and many others paid Tlingit Indians to haul gear on a per-pound rate from campsite to campsite.

====Tramways====

Aerial tramway companies soon were hauling tons of gear over the head of the prospectors every day. By the end of the Chilkoot Trail&#x27;s heyday, there were five distinct tramway operations on different parts of the trail competing for the influx of gear and money in the region. Many of the trams constituted world-class engineering feats of the era.

===Post-Klondike===
After the Klondike Gold Rush, the trail became more or less deserted. Prospectors late to the gold rush now made their way to the Yukon on the new White Pass and Yukon Route narrow-gauge railroad, which took them all the way to Whitehorse, Yukon in the Yukon Territory.
In 1969, the U.S. and Canadian governments jointly declared their intention to make Chilkoot Trail a component of a Klondike Gold Rush International Historic Park. The U.S. portion was eventually established in 1976 as Klondike Gold Rush National Historical Park, comprising part of Pioneer Square in downtown Seattle, Washington, various sites throughout Skagway, Alaska, the abandoned town site of Dyea, Alaska, and the U.S. portion of the Chilkoot Trail.

The Canadian portion of the trail was christened Chilkoot Trail National Historic Site, one of several sites that comprise the Canadian national park associated with the Klondike. Klondike Gold Rush NHP and Chilkoot Trail NHS together form Klondike Gold Rush International Historical Park, a designation introduced at the time of the centennial of the gold rush in 1998.

==Current status==

The Chilkoot Trail is a popular recreational trail among residents of Southeast Alaska and Yukon Territory. The trail also attracts many tourists from abroad. To manage demand, and to prevent overuse and maintain the remote character of the trail, the National Park Service and Parks Canada allow no more than 50 backpackers to begin the trail each day by way of a permit system.

In return for these fees, both countries have full-time trail maintenance crews, ranger/warden stations, well-designed campgrounds, and have placed numerous interpretive signs adjacent to notable historical sites and objects.

The official hiking season (when rangers are on-duty and trail crew is on-site) varies, but usually begins in late May and ends in early September. Peak demand runs from June through August. Avalanche danger lingers into late May, as well as large snow fields that slow progress, whereas September is associated with rain and colder weather.

The Chilkoot is also a challenging ultra-run. The fastest known time belongs to ultramarathoner Geoff Roes in 5 hours and 27 minutes.

==Route and attractions==
The Chilkoot trail features a number of natural and historical sites as shown on the map. By following the numbers on the map from south to north, the hiker will go along the same route as the old prospectors. The trip normally takes three to five days and to stay for the night, a number of designated campgrounds are made. The trail is roughly divided into three climatic zones: coastal rainforest, high alpine (above tree limit) and boreal forest. In the end it is connected to White Pass historical railway leading back to Skagway the modern port of the trail. In the following, the points of the map are highlighted with bold letters.

=== Dyea ===

Dyea is a ghost town located at the convergence of the Taiya River and Taiya Inlet on the south side of the Chilkoot Pass within the limits of the Municipality of Skagway Borough, Alaska. Confidence man and crime boss Soapy Smith, famous for his underworld control of the neighboring town of Skagway in 1897-98 is believed to have had control of Dyea as well.

The port at Dyea had shallow water, while neighboring Skagway had deep water. For a brief period between 1897 and 1899, this trail and town were full of prospectors. Dyea was abandoned when the White Pass and Yukon Route railroad chose the White Pass Trail, which begins in Skagway, over the Chilkoot Trail. By 1905, most of the buildings had been demolished or removed.

===Coastal rainforest zone===

The trail begins in Dyea, a ghost town and campground, 15 minutes from Skagway. From the trailhead, the route winds through coastal rainforest along to the Taiya River. The first campsite is Finnegan&#x27;s Point. This stretch of the trail is in flat terrain with no substantial obstacles.

The trail becomes noticeably cooler after Finnegan&#x27;s Point owing to cool air sinking down from snow and ice fields in the surrounding mountains. Numerous streams also cascade down the mountain sides. This stretch of the trail contains the least amount of visible artifacts. The next camp is Canyon City. Many hikers, especially those desiring a more modest pace or those who have had a late start, stop at Canyon City the first night. The shelter located at Canyon City houses many gold rush-era artifacts.

Close to the Canyon City campsite are the Canyon City ruins. Canyon City was a tent city during the gold rush and its ruins—building foundations, a large restaurant stove, a large boiler—are still visible. The ruins are accessible by crossing the Taiya River by suspension footbridge.

After Canyon City ruins, the trail diverges away from the river for the first time as the river disappears into a small canyon (Canyon City&#x27;s namesake) and climbs up valley wall, traversing sub-alpine forest. For many sections of the trail, old telegraph and tram wires are exposed adjacent to the trail. For the gold rush prospectors, this section of the trail was one of the most difficult. In winter, when the Taiya River was frozen, the gold rush stampeders could easily travel up the ice highway; however, in the summer this segment was described as &quot;the worst piece of trail on the road, fairly muddy with many boulders and with some short, steep ascents and descents in and out of small gulches.&quot;

The next landmark is Pleasant Camp. There is an informational trail sign at the original site of Pleasant Camp, a quarter mile before the present Pleasant Camp campground. Pleasant Camp marks the reunion of the trail with Taiya River and serves as a lightly used, small campground. From Pleasant Camp the trail is fairly flat and weaves through forest and over small creeks.

The trail next comes to Sheep Camp, the last campground on the American side of the trail as well as the final resting stop before the trek up Chilkoot Pass. It is the largest of the campsites on the American side of the trail.

After leaving Sheep Camp and before the U.S. ranger station, the trail passes through a large avalanche chute. The slide has wiped out all previously existing forest and leaves a young brushy and alder-dominated landscape. A short distance after the ranger station is a small museum of gold rush-era artifacts in an old cabin. Soon after leaving the cabin the sub-alpine forest slowly yields to a treeless alpine landscape that allows a grand view of the rapidly narrowing Taiya River valley. As the trail climbs in altitude, its path becomes more improved, often demarcated by yellow markers planted in snowfields.

===High alpine zone===
Within sight of the pass, and at the base of the &quot;Golden Stairs&quot; (the long difficult incline that leads to the pass), are The Scales. The Scales were a weight station where freight would be reweighed before the final trek to the pass. Often, Native packers would demand higher packing rates. The Scales also hosted a small tent city, including six restaurants, two hotels, a saloon, and many freighting offices and warehouses. The imposing Golden Stairs also prompted many would-be prospectors to turn around, often leaving behind their required ton of equipment. Because of this, and the snow&#x27;s preserving properties, artifacts are prevalent at this altitude, including many remnants of wooden structures.

After The Scales is the final push up to the Chilkoot Pass: the fabled Golden Stairs. The Golden Stairs acquired its name from the steps that prospectors painstakingly carved into the snow and ice of the pass and has retained the name ever since. At the pass proper, at the Canada–US border, is a warming cabin and part-time Parks Canada warden station. Occasionally, if a party is making poor time, the warden or U.S. ranger will offer the warming cabin as an overnight shelter so to not risk the group from being caught in the barren and exposed alpine landscape between the pass and Happy Camp. There are also many artifacts scattered about the Golden Stairs and ridge lines surrounding the pass, including a cache of intact (canvas, wood, etc.) prefabricated boats on the southeastern side of the pass.

Stone Crib is situated a half mile after the pass. Stone Crib served as the terminus of the Chilkoot Railroad and Transport Company&#x27;s aerial tramway, a huge rocky counterbalance for the tram. This function is still apparent today with the wooden structure collapsed along the west side of the valley.

The trail wends its way by a series of alpine lakes: First Crater Lake, Morrow Lake, and finally Happy Camp.

===Boreal forest zone===
The trail continues to pass another couple of lakes—Long Lake and Deep Lake—before crossing tree line. Adjacent to Deep Lake, and amidst tree line, is another campground. The Canadian half of the Chilkoot Trail, in the rain shadow of the Coast Mountains, is much dryer, and pine forest, first appearing at Deep Lake, readily contrasts to the more lush temperate rain forest on the U.S. half before Chilkoot Pass.

After the trail passes Deep Lake, the outlet river runs parallel to the trail for a short distance before entering a small canyon. Many boat and boat-related artifacts are visible in this area. The trail continues at a gentle decline until the turquoise-colored Lake Lindeman comes into view and the trail concludes its descent to the Lake Lindeman campground, the headquarters of Canadian trail operations.

The trail climbs a steep bluff after Lindeman and offers an expansive view of the lake and surrounding forest. After Lake Lindeman, the trail passes Bare Loon Lake and the Bare Loon Lake campground.

The trail diverges after Bare Loon Lake. One branch continues to Lake Bennett and the tracks of the White Pass &amp; Yukon Route railroad. The other branch, the Log Cabin cut-off, connects with the Klondike Highway, but was closed by Parks Canada in 2010.

Bennett consists of a campground, a White Pass and Yukon Route depot, several houses (all private property) belonging to White Pass employees or First Nations citizens, and the only gold rush-era building still standing along the trail today, the renovated St. Andrew&#x27;s Presbyterian Church. Pilings from bygone piers dot the lakeshore and an assortment of cans and other metal artifacts are scattered throughout the woods.

==Campgrounds==
As shown on the route map there are nine designated, maintained campgrounds on the Chilkoot Trail. Camping is allowed in these places only. Hikers must use their own tents or shelters as the cabins at the campgrounds are for warming and cooking only. For cooking a backpacking stove must be brought along, even though wood stoves are available in some places. Open fires are prohibited. Use of campgrounds must be planned in advance.

In addition to the camps, a U.S. Ranger Station is located north of Sheep Camp to present the history of the pass and inform about weather and trail conditions before crossing the summit.

=== Finnegan&#x27;s Point ===
This campground is located adjacent to the Taiya River while the valley is still relatively flat. The mosquitoes are very bad at Finnegan&#x27;s Point partly due to its location and the abundance of standing water. The campsite itself includes a canvas warming and cooking shelter with mosquito screens, bear-proof food storage locker, an outhouse, and ample tent sites. Finnegan&#x27;s Point often takes in very few hikers because of its proximity to the trailhead, and most parties pass Finnegan&#x27;s Point within a few hours. However, for slower parties and those with a late start on the trail, Finnegan&#x27;s Point is often the campground of choice.

The campground receives its name from Pat Finnegan, who enterprised to collect bridge-crossing tolls from stampeders. Finnegan&#x27;s Point consisted of a &quot;huddle of tents surrounding a hard core of blacksmith shop, saloon, and a restaurant.&quot;

=== Canyon City ===
The second-largest campground on the American side of the trail. It is located next to small tributary of the Taiya River. Canyon City includes a log cabin with a wood stove and several bunks (although sleeping is not permitted inside park shelters), several shelves for cooking, and a small porch for drying gear. This cabin was built by the CCC and juvenile delinquents in the 60s. Canyon City includes 16 campsites and two outhouses as well as food lockers and bear poles.

=== Pleasant Camp ===

This is the smallest of the campgrounds on the American side of the trail. It is located next to a sandbar in the Taiya River and consists of a canvas warming and cooking shelter, a small number of campsites, a bear pole and food lockers. Pleasant Camp usually serves as a spillover campsite if Sheep Camp is full. There is a sign near the cooking shelter notifying backpackers whether Sheep Camp is at capacity or can still take backpackers.

=== Sheep Camp ===
This is the largest of the American campsites. It is located adjacent to a braided Taiya River. Occasionally avalanches, rockslides, or exceptional rains, will flood Sheep Camp. Sheep Camp consists of two canvas shelters, 3 outhouses, and over 20 campsites. A large post-and-beam picnic pavilion was completed by the trail crew in 2017. The collapsed CCC cabin was rebuilt in 2018 by the trail crew. The only U.S. Ranger Station on the trail is located just a few hundred meters south of Sheep Camp and the ranger during the official season gives a nightly presentation on the history of the pass and current weather and trail conditions. From Sheep Camp many hikers leave early in the morning—as early as 4 a.m.—for the summit push into Canada. During the official hiking season the park ranger stationed just south of Sheep Camp gives a quick presentation outlining the route over the pass, the weather forecast, and snow conditions every evening in the pavilion. Rangers recommend 7.5 to 10 hours for a group to travel from Sheep Camp to Happy Camp.

=== Happy Camp ===

Happy Camp is the only campground on the Chilkoot Trail in the alpine. A very small wooden warming cabin, an outhouse, and a modest number of campsites are all available at this campsite. Happy Camp owes its name to the relief prospectors (and hikers) experienced from arriving at the first outpost after the pass. The camp is situated in a true alpine ecosystem and receives heavy use because of its location.

=== Deep Lake ===
Deep Lake is one of only two campgrounds on the trail without permanent or semi-permanent shelter. Deep Lake includes an outside cooking area, bear proof lockers for food, and a small number of campsites. It is notable, however, for its scenic location, between the indigo hues of Long and Deep Lakes.

=== Lake Lindeman ===

The largest campground on the Canadian side. It includes separate north and south campsites, a small cluster of buildings for the trail warden and trail crew, a dock and Parks Canada powerboat, a canvas shelter containing a museum of photographs and small library on the outdoors and Klondike history, and a web of trails leading among the remains of the old town. The north and south campsites each include a large wooden cabin that serves as a cooking and warming shelter, numerous bear poles, and several picnic tables. The campsite is located on the site of what was Lindeman City during the gold rush: a cemetery of deceased prospectors from the gold rush era remains, as well as numerous foundations, former fire rings, old latrine holes, the ruts of Lindeman City&#x27;s main street, and a plethora of artifacts ranging from broken wine and beer bottles to tin cans. Lake Lindeman hosts a small tent museum containing photographic displays and a small library of books on the Chilkoot, the outdoors, and other Canadian parks.

=== Bare Loon Lake ===

Bare Loon Lake is the second campground without semi-permanent shelter, though it now includes a pavilion-style cooking shelter. Located on a small ridge above Lake Lindeman in a pine forest and overlooking the Bare Loon Lake, the campground is one of the most beautiful on the trail. It includes two outhouses, a helicopter pad, and food lockers.

=== Bennett ===
This camp is the end of the trail. Several structures maintained by the White Pass and Yukon Route are clustered around the tracks, as well as a private First Nations residence. The campground is relatively small and includes bear poles, picnic tables, and an outhouse.

==Safety==
Bears are the primary safety concern in the park. It is very common for hikers to encounter them. Firearms are not permitted on the Canadian side of Klondike Gold Rush International Historical Park. Almost all parties take bear spray and/or bear bangers as repellents, but most importantly both sides of the park mandate smart bear practices. It is required to stow food in bear-safe locations.

Weather and terrain also pose a challenge to hikers. There are few risks in the forest regions of the trail, however once the trail climbs into the alpine, weather and the elements pose more of a concern; the same does vertigo. Often the American ranger from Sheep Camp sweeps late in the day up to Chilkoot Pass to monitor for straggling groups that may not make Happy Camp and would be in need of emergency shelter.

<doc id="910742" wikidata="Q7300952" url="?curid=910742" title="Real Life (1979 film)">
<text>Real Life is a 1979 American comedy film starring Albert Brooks (in his directorial debut), who also co-authored the screenplay alongside Monica Johnson and Harry Shearer. It is a spoof of the 1973 reality television program &quot;An American Family&quot; and portrays a documentary filmmaker named Albert Brooks who attempts to live with and film a dysfunctional family for one full year.

Charles Grodin co-stars as the family&#x27;s patriarch who allows cameras in his Arizona home. Real-life producer Jennings Lang also has an acting role in &quot;Real Life&quot;.

==Plot==
Documentary film producer Albert Brooks leads a project meant to encapsulate the joys, sorrows and intimacy of real life by filming a regular American family, the Yeagers, at all times for a full year using expensive cameras: some installed on walls, and four large helmet-like ones worn by a camera crew that follows Brooks and the family in and out of their neighboring homes.

The Yeagers are sent on vacation and filming starts as they arrive back at the airport, causing immediate nervousness in the family. Brooks takes an hour off to do antiquing while the Yeagers have pizza and argue about rules at the dinner table. The father, Warren, makes a few unsympathetic remarks and ends up eating alone.

Doctors Howard Hill and Ted Cleary are there to observe the project&#x27;s integrity and progress. Cleary does not appreciate Brooks&#x27; intrusive method of constantly filming the family, worrying that their hold on reality is being threatened.

The mother, Jeanette, leaves the house without cameras to unwind and meets Brooks later to thank him by inviting him to an appointment at the gynecologist. Brooks is thrilled until Jeanette kisses him, which he dislikes. He warns her that he is no better than her husband and that his charisma &quot;doesn&#x27;t run deep&quot;.

The gynecologist refuses to be on camera because of a damning news story that ran about him years ago. Brooks offers him $500 to accept but then recognizes the man as &quot;the baby broker&quot; from the news story, causing the gynecologist to refuse the deal.

Warren brings the crew to witness a day at his work as a veterinarian. Being nervous from the cameras, he starts surgery on a horse by accidentally ordering an anesthetic drug twice, which kills the animal. He asks Brooks to not show the footage in the film, but Brooks will not agree to that.

Jeannette&#x27;s grandmother dies and the family enters a deep depression. Trying to cheer the family up, Brooks invites Jeanette to a dinner date which she declines, having reconsidered her attraction to him. Brooks then shows up to the house in a clown costume to cheer the kids, but they are at school. While still in costume, Brooks is asked to sit down with Warren and Jeannette, where Warren confesses to fearing he may be on the verge of a nervous breakdown. Brooks dismisses the claim, saying that it is okay to be sad and confused as long as one does not &quot;clam up&quot;.

After a meeting with the doctors, some scientists from the institute, and a film producer obsessed with getting movie stars involved, Dr. Cleary leaves the project, disapproving of how the family is being treated. The family returns to a happier, more harmonious lifestyle until Cleary&#x27;s book on the project is published, calling it &quot;mind-control&quot; and &quot;psychological rape&quot;. The book attracts attention to the family from newscasters, much to the anger of Brooks and the discomfort of the Yeagers.

Dr. Hill, the institute and the film producer call for the early termination of the project. Brooks brings the Yeagers to the meeting and, to his surprise, they also want to end the project. Despite his pleas and threats for them to stay, they do not change their minds and the producer calls for the Yeagers to be paid in full to apologize for the stress they endured. 

While dressing back into the clown costume for a benefit at a children&#x27;s hospital, in a desperate attempt to find a solid ending to the film, Brooks recalls the endings of famous films and decides to copy &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot;. He elatedly burns down the Yeagers&#x27; house, though no one is harmed.

==Reception==
Roger Ebert gave the film one star out of four and wrote that it &quot;gets most of its laughs in the first 10 minutes, slides into a long middle stretch of repetitive situations and ends on a note of embarrassing hysteria. An idea is not enough for a movie. Characters have to be developed, comic situations have to be set up before they can pay off and the story should have a conclusion instead of a dead stop. &quot;Real Life&quot; fails in all of those areas — fails so miserably that it lets its audiences down.&quot; 

Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot; praised the film as an &quot;often very funny assault on manners, moviemaking, an allegedly typical American family and everything its members hold dear ... Its manner is deadpan and sly, so sly that some viewers may not find it comic at all. But for anyone well-disposed toward Mr. Brooks, who is never without his absolute insincerity and irrational good cheer, &quot;Real Life&quot; is full of delightful nonsense, a very funny account of one man&#x27;s crusade to capture all the truth and wisdom that money can buy.&quot; 

&quot;Variety&quot; said: &quot;Expanding on the deadpan satiric tone of the short parodies and pseudo-documentaries he&#x27;s filmed in the past for NBC&#x27;s &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; into his first feature, Albert Brooks has come up with a mostly very funny (though uneven) take-off on social-minded docu filmmaking that stands to draw boxoffice support from the young adult, primarily college crowd that&#x27;s made the late-night tv show the success it is.&quot; 

Gene Siskel of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; gave the film three-and-a-half stars out of four, and wrote: &quot;Admittedly, documentary filmmaking doesn&#x27;t sound like the greatest subject to be satirized, but &quot;Real Life&quot; is full of undeniable laughs.&quot; 

Charles Champlin of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; called Grodin &quot;wonderful to watch&quot; and thought that the film &quot;generates some spectacular moments,&quot; but &quot;the movie, like the experiment, runs out of steam well before it is finished and, like many a promising routine, is stuck for a sock ending.&quot; 

Gary Arnold of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; stated: &quot;Albert Brooks may be the Woody Allen of the 1980s. His extraordinary first feature, &quot;Real Life&quot;, demonstrates a potential genius for movie comedy and is animated by a peculiarly fertile and subtle imagination.&quot; 

David Ansen of &quot;Newsweek&quot; wrote that the film &quot;doesn&#x27;t quite come off, for all its funny ideas. It feels like a 30-minute gag stretched to fill a feature film, and the repetitiousness of the situation gets wearisome. It&#x27;s a one-note movie, and Brooks&#x27;s performance doesn&#x27;t help: he&#x27;s like an aggressive emcee who doesn&#x27;t know when to shut up and turn the show over to his guests. That may be the point, but it&#x27;s also the problem.&quot;

&quot;Real Life&quot; holds a rating of 84% on Rotten Tomatoes based on 25 reviews, with an average score of 6.80/10.

<text>&#x27; or On Interpretation&quot;&quot;&#x27; (Greek: , ) is the second text from Aristotle&#x27;s &quot;Organon&quot; and is among the earliest surviving philosophical works in the Western tradition to deal with the relationship between language and logic in a comprehensive, explicit, and formal way. The work is usually known by its Latin title.

The work begins by analyzing simple &quot;categoric&quot; propositions, and draws a series of basic conclusions on the routine issues of classifying and defining basic linguistic forms, such as &quot;simple terms&quot; and &quot;propositions&quot;, nouns and verbs, negation, the &quot;quantity&quot; of simple propositions (primitive roots of the quantifiers in modern symbolic logic), investigations on the &quot;excluded middle&quot; (which to Aristotle is not applicable to future tense propositions—the problem of future contingents), and on modal propositions.

The first five chapters deal with the terms that form propositions. Chapters 6 and 7 deal with the relationship between affirmative, negative, universal and particular propositions. These relationships are the basis of the well-known square of opposition. The distinction between universal and particular propositions is the basis of modern quantification theory. The last three chapters deal with modalities. Chapter 9 is famous for the discussion of the sea-battle. (If it is true that there will be a sea-battle tomorrow, then it is true &quot;today&quot; that there will be a sea-battle. Thus a sea-battle is apparently unavoidable, and thus necessary. Another &quot;interpretation&quot; would be: that we cannot know that which has not yet come to pass. In other words: if there is a sea battle tomorrow then it is true today that tomorrow there will be a sea battle. So, only if we can know whether or not there will be a sea battle tomorrow then can we know if there will be a sea battle).

== Contents ==

&quot;Chapter 1&quot;. Aristotle defines words as symbols of &#x27;affections of the soul&#x27; or mental experiences. Spoken and written symbols differ between languages, but the mental experiences are the same for all (so that the English word &#x27;cat&#x27; and the French word &#x27;chat&#x27; are different symbols, but the mental experience they stand for—the concept of a cat—is the same for English speakers and French speakers). Nouns and verbs on their own do not involve truth or falsity.

&quot;Chapter 2&quot;. A noun signifies the subject by convention, but without reference to time.

&quot;Chapter 3&quot;. A verb carries with it the notion of time. &#x27;He was healthy&#x27; and &#x27;he will be healthy&#x27; are tenses of a verb. An untensed verb indicates the present, the tenses of a verb indicate times outside the present.

&quot;Chapter 4&quot;. The sentence is an expression whose parts have meaning. The word &#x27;cat&#x27; signifies something, but is not a sentence. Only when words are added to it do we have affirmation and negation.

&quot;Chapter 5&quot;. Every simple proposition contains a verb. A simple proposition indicates a single fact, and the conjunction of its parts gives a unity. A complex proposition is several propositions compounded together.

&quot;Chapter 6&quot;. An affirmation is an assertion of something, a denial an assertion denying something of something. (For example, &#x27;a man is an animal&#x27; asserts &#x27;animal&#x27; of &#x27;man&#x27;. &#x27;A stone is not an animal&#x27; denies &#x27;animal&#x27; of stone&#x27;).

&quot;Chapter 7&quot;. Terms. Some terms are universal. A universal term is capable of being asserted of several subjects (for example &#x27;moon&#x27;—even though the Earth has one moon, it may have had more, and the noun &#x27;moon&#x27; could have been said of them in exactly the same sense). Other terms are individual. An individual or singular term (&#x27;Plato&#x27;) is not predicated (in the same) sense of more than one individual.

A universal affirmative proposition, such as, &#x27;Every man is mortal&#x27; and a universal negative proposition having the same subject and predicate, such as, &#x27;No man is mortal,&#x27; are called &quot;contrary&quot;. A universal affirmative proposition (&quot;Every man is mortal&quot;) and the non-universal denial of that proposition in a way (&quot;Some men are not mortal&quot;) are called &quot;contradictories&quot;. Of contradictories, one must be true, the other false. Contraries cannot both be true, although they can both be false, and hence their contradictories are both true. For example, both &#x27;Every man is honest&#x27; and &#x27;No man is honest&#x27; are false. But their contradictories, &#x27;Some men are not honest&#x27; and &#x27;Some men are honest,&#x27; are both true.

&quot;Chapter 8&quot;. An affirmation is single, if it expresses a single fact. For example, &#x27;every man is mortal&#x27;. However, if a word has two meanings, for example if the word &#x27;garment&#x27; meant &#x27;man and horse&#x27;, then &#x27;the garment is white&#x27; would not be a single affirmation, for it would mean &#x27;the man and horse are white&#x27;, which is equivalent to the two simple propositions &#x27;a man is white and a horse is white&#x27;.

&quot;Chapter 9&quot;. Of contradictory propositions about the past and present, one must be true, the other false. But when the subject is individual, and the proposition is future, this is not the case. For if so, nothing takes place by chance. For either the future proposition such as, &#x27;A sea battle will take place,&#x27; corresponds with future reality, or its negation does, in which case the sea battle will take place with necessity, or not take place with necessity. But in reality, such an event might just as easily not happen as happen; the meaning of the word &#x27;by chance&#x27; with regard to future events is that reality is so constituted that it may issue in either of two opposite possibilities. This is known as the problem of future contingents.

&quot;Chapter 10&quot;. Aristotle enumerates the affirmations and denials that can be assigned when &#x27;indefinite&#x27; terms such as &#x27;unjust&#x27; are included. He makes a distinction that was to become important later, between the use of the verb &#x27;is&#x27; as a mere copula or &#x27;third element&#x27;, as in the sentence &#x27;a man is wise&#x27;, and as a predicate signifying existence, as in &#x27;a man is [i.e. exists]&#x27;.

&quot;Chapter 11&quot;. Some propositions appear to be simple, but are really composite. In a single proposition, the nouns referring to the subjects combine to form a unity. Thus, &#x27;two-footed domesticated animal&#x27; applies to a &#x27;man&#x27;, and the three predicates combine to form a unity. But in the term &#x27;a white walking man&#x27; the three predicates do not combine to form a unity of this sort.

&quot;Chapter 12&quot;. This chapter considers the mutual relation of modal propositions: affirmations and denials which assert or deny possibility or contingency, impossibility or necessity.

&quot;Chapter 13&quot;. The relation between such propositions. Logical consequences follow from this arrangement. For example, from the proposition &#x27;it is possible&#x27; it follows that it is contingent, that it is not impossible, or from the proposition &#x27;it cannot be the case&#x27; there follows &#x27;it is necessarily not the case&#x27;.

&quot;Chapter 14&quot;. Is there an affirmative proposition corresponding to every denial? For example, is the proposition &#x27;every man is unjust&#x27; an affirmation (since it seems to affirm being unjust of every man) or is it merely a negative (since it denies justice)?

== Square of opposition (logical square) and modal logic ==

The logical square, also called square of opposition or square of Apuleius has its origin in the four marked sentences to be employed in syllogistic reasoning: Every man is white, the universal affirmative and its negation Not every man is white (or Some men are not white), the particular negative on the one hand, Some men are white, the particular affirmative and its negation No man is white, the universal negative on the other. Robert Blanché published with Vrin his book &quot;Structures intellectuelles&quot; in 1966 and since then many scholars think that the logical square or square of opposition representing four values should be replaced by the logical hexagon which by representing six values is a more potent figure because it has the power to explain more things about logic and natural language. The study of the four propositions constituting the square is found in Chapter 7 and its appendix Chapter 8. Most important also is the immediately following Chapter 9 dealing with the problem of future contingents. This chapter and the subsequent ones are at the origin of modal logic.

==Translations==

<text>Quincy University (QU) is a private Franciscan college in Quincy, Illinois, United States. Founded in 1860, it has an enrollment of approximately 1,300 undergraduate and graduate students across five constituent schools.

==History==
=== 1860s-1890s ===
A small group of Franciscan friars left Germany in 1858 to serve the German-speaking population in what was then the frontier state of Illinois. On February 6, 1860, they founded the institution as St. Francis Solanus College. This school was established at the corner of 8th and Maine Street. Under the leadership of Fr. Anselm Mueller, who served as president for a total of 37 years beginning in 1863, the institution moved to its current location on what is now College Avenue.

Quincy University was involved in educating Army reservists and Navy cadets during World War II, and enrollment grew after the Second World War. The institution first enrolled over 1,000 students in the late 1950s. In response to this enrollment growth, several new buildings were planned and put up during the 1950s and 1960s. 

From its founding, Quincy University has embraced a deep commitment to the liberal arts while recognizing the importance of professional programs. The earliest course catalogs, from the 1870s, combined a strong focus on the liberal arts with courses in accounting and other &quot;commercial&quot; programs. Quincy University continues to offer majors in the liberal arts and in the professions. 

=== 1900s-1990s ===
Quincy University typically enrolled under 300 students until the 1930s. The first woman enrolled at the institution in the 1920s, and women were regularly admitted beginning in 1932. From the 1870s until the 1950s, the great majority of campus courses and activities occurred in Francis Hall, a large building renowned for its beauty and strong German architectural influences.

Following two other name changes during the twentieth century, the current name, Quincy University, was adopted in 1993. The university name was used in part to recognize the addition of graduate programs.

The Franciscan friars made up the majority of the faculty until the late twentieth century. The distinctive Franciscan intellectual tradition remains central to the institution&#x27;s mission and values. Since the founding of the institution, many Franciscan friars in the Midwest have been educated at Quincy University. Today, the institution is home to people of all faiths, who are welcomed in the Franciscan tradition of hospitality.

=== 2000s-present ===
In 2016 the institution announced that it was having significant financial issues. At the time of the announcement the school was running a $5 million deficit. A plan was developed to cut costs, and major donors helped get the institution past the crisis. In November 2018, the institution received $2.25 million from the U.S. Department of Education to expand students&#x27; access to science, technology, engineering and math.

In 2020, the institution initiated its distinctive Success by Design program, in which each undergraduate student completes and annually updates an individualized student success plan. The program also emphasizes high-impact learning experiences, such as undergraduate research and internships, along with multiple sources of mentoring and advising.

In 2021, the Oakley family of Quincy announced a $6.5 million gift to the institution which included naming of the Oakley School of Business. This gift is more than double the previous largest gift to the institution.

==Academics==
Quincy University is organized into five schools:
*School of Fine Arts &amp; Communication

===Accreditations===
Quincy University is accredited by the Higher Learning Commission. QU also has specialized accreditation from the Council for Accreditation of Counseling and Related Educational Programs (CACREP).

==Campus==
Quincy University&#x27;s compact, walkable campus is located in a residential area, a few blocks away from Quincy&#x27;s Broadway Avenue shopping and business district. Public transit service to campus is provided by Quincy Transit Lines.

Historic Francis Hall is at the center of campus and was built and expanded between 1871 and 1898. The campus also features distinctive examples of Mid-Century modern architecture in its residence halls and classroom and administration buildings. Friar&#x27;s Field, a large lawn that held various athletic fields during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, now creates a park-like setting for the campus. The newest additions to campus include a large health and fitness center and an apartment-style residence hall.

The historic campus holds several noteworthy traditional and contemporary public art installations. The Brenner Library includes the highly regarded Gray Gallery, which features art exhibitions throughout the year.

The chapel was built in 1911 and has been renovated on several occasions. The chapel design was shortened and modified to preserve the baseball field then located just to the north of Francis Hall.

A former Franciscan seminary is now part of Quincy University, just a few minutes to the north of the institution&#x27;s historic campus. Now called the North Campus, this extensively renovated facility houses most of the Division of Science and Technology, the Connie Niemann Center for Music, and the Quincy Media Inc. television studio. The institution&#x27;s soccer stadium and softball complex are located adjacent to the North Campus. The football stadium and baseball field are part of the main campus and feature distinctive limestone walls. The football and baseball facilities were built in the 1930s and have been extensively renovated.

Campus life at Quincy University involves several student clubs and activities, including three Greek-letter organizations. Greek houses are located on campus.

Each year, the Inaugural ceremony brings together faculty, staff, new students, and parents to celebrate the beginning of the college experience for new students. Following a procession by the faculty in academic regalia, the ceremony takes place in St. Francis Solanus Church, a Franciscan parish located across the street from Quincy University.

==Students and alumni==
The student body at Quincy University is about 52% men and 48% women. Most students come from Illinois and Missouri, but several other states in the Midwest and South are well represented at QU. Over 15,000 Quincy University alumni live in all 50 states and 12 foreign countries.

==Athletics==

Men&#x27;s volleyball competes in the Midwestern Intercollegiate Volleyball Association as a de facto member of NCAA Division I. Sprint football, a weight-restricted form of American football that is not governed by the NCAA, will become QU&#x27;s newest varsity sport in fall 2022.
