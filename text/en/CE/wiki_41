<text>The Noon Universe (Russian term: &quot;Мир Полудня&quot; or &quot;Мир Полдня&quot; – &quot;World of Noon&quot;; also known as the “Wanderers’ Universe”) is a fictional future setting for a number of hard science fiction novels written by Arkady and Boris Strugatsky. The universe is named after &quot;&quot;, chronologically the first novel from the series and referring to humanity reaching its noon in the 22nd century.

According to Arkady Strugatsky, the brothers at first did not make a conscious effort to create a fictional universe. Rather, they reused characters and settings from prior works whenever they found it convenient. It was only later that they began drawing on common themes and plot threads from various novels to create newer works.

== Description ==
The victory of communism and the advance of technological progress on the Earth of the Noon Universe has resulted in an overabundance of resources and eliminated the need for most types of manual labor.

Mankind is capable of near-instantaneous interstellar travel. Earth&#x27;s social organization is presumably communist and can be described as a highly technologically advanced anarchistic meritocracy. There is no state structure, no institutionalized coercion, no police etc., yet the society&#x27;s functioning is safeguarded by raising everyone as responsible individuals, with the guidance of a set of High Councils accepted by everyone in each particular field of activity.

The main governing body is the World Council, which is composed of the brightest scientists, historians, doctors and teachers. Local matters are handled by the regional versions of the council. Planetary councils are present on each Earth colony (such as in &quot;Rainbow&quot;) as well, but &quot;colony&quot; in this context refers to a planet that was not home to any sentient life before the arrival of Terran settlers. In the Noon Universe, Earth has never attempted to seize permanent control over any other civilization.

There is the COMCON (COMmission for CONtacts) in charge of contacts with aliens and the secret service COMCON-2 for clandestine operations.

===Sentient races===
The universe is populated by a number of sentient races. Some of them are humanoid, and others are so alien that humanity did not realise for decades that they were sentient. Several sentient races maintain diplomatic relations with Earth&#x27;s society. Many planets in the Noon Universe are inhabited by races identical to humans in all but minor genetic differences. It has been speculated that they were humans who wound up on other worlds by the manipulations of the Wanderers (as &quot;Beetle in the Anthill&quot; shows, that is hardly unprecedented).

The Wanderers are the most mysterious race in the Noon Universe. Technologically advanced and highly secretive, the Wanderers are suspected of manipulating sentient beings throughout Noon Universe for their own purposes. While those purposes remain unclear, it is hinted that they try to &quot;progress&quot; various sentient beings, including the human race.

The following sentient species are depicted: Ark Megaforms (негуманоиды Ковчега), Garrotian Snails (слизни Гарроты), Golovans (Голованы, sentient dogs), Humans, Ludens (людены, who are superhumans), Leoniders (леонидяне) Tagorians (тагоряне) Wanderers (Странники, a superrace).

Other possibly-sentient species that are mentioned in the books are &quot;septoids&quot; (see &quot;&quot;) whose sentience is not really confirmed, semi-sentient prehistoric molluscs &quot;katapumoridako&quot; (see &quot;The Time Wanderers&quot;) and the unidentified sentient creature killed by Pol Gnedykh in the Kroox solar system (&quot;Noon: 22nd Century&quot;).

===Progressors===
One of the controversial occupations in the Noon Universe is that of the progressors, agents embedded in less-advanced humanoid civilizations in order to accelerate their development or to resolve their problems. Progressors&#x27; methods range from rescuing local scientists and artists to overthrowing local governments. Konstantin Šindelář, the Czech translator of the Strugatsky brothers&#x27; works (among others) and the biographer of the Strugatsky brothers consider the phenomenon of &quot;progressorship&quot; to be one of the major concepts introduced into the social science fiction. Progressorship is a considerable element in the novels &quot;Beetle in the Anthill&quot; in which the term was first introduced and &quot;The Waves Extinguish the Wind&quot;, but literary critics agree that the idea, although unnamed, may be found in the 1962 novel &quot;Escape Attempt&quot; and that a number of subsequent novels, notably &quot;Hard to Be a God&quot;, deal with progressorship.

COMCON-2 suspects that the Wanderers act as progressors with respect to the Earth and try to counteract them.

== Works ==
These works by the Strugatsky brothers are set in the Noon Universe (listed chronologically):

* &quot;&quot; (&quot;Полдень. XXII век&quot;, first published 1961)
* &quot;Escape Attempt&quot; (&quot;Попытка к бегству&quot;)
* &quot;Far Rainbow&quot; (&quot;Далекая Радуга&quot;)
* &quot;Hard to Be a God&quot; (&quot;Трудно быть богом&quot;)
* &quot;Disquiet&quot; (&quot;Беспокойство&quot;) – the initial variant of the &quot;Snail on the Slope (Улитка на склоне)&quot;
* &quot;Prisoners of Power&quot; (The Inhabited Island) (&quot;Обитаемый остров&quot;)
* &quot;Space Mowgli&quot; (&quot;Малыш&quot;)
* &quot;The Kid from Hell&quot; (&quot;Парень из преисподней&quot;)
* &quot;Beetle in the Anthill&quot; (&quot;Жук в муравейнике&quot;)
* &quot;The Time Wanderers&quot; (&quot;Волны гасят ветер&quot;)

There are loose connections to early stories &quot;The Land of Crimson Clouds (&quot;Страна багровых туч&quot;)&quot;, &quot;The Way to Amalthea (&quot;Путь на Амальтею&quot;)&quot;, &quot;Space Apprentice (&quot;Стажеры&quot;)&quot;, &quot;The Final Circle of Paradise&quot; (through &quot;Ivan Zhilin&quot;), &quot;Ispytanie SKIBR&quot;, &quot;Chastnye predpolozheniya&quot;, mainly through &quot;Bykov&quot;″s family.

In the early 1990s, the Strugatsky brothers began writing what they intended to be a final Noon Universe novel. It would have tied up some of the plot threads that were left unresolved in previous novels. However, after the death of Arkady Strugatsky, the surviving brother, Boris, felt that he could not bring himself to finish the novel. The book would have been named &quot;White Ferz&quot; (). &quot;Ferz&quot; or &quot;Vizier&quot; is the Russian masculine term for the queen in chess. The Strugatsky brothers planned the book as a direct sequel of &quot;Prisoners of Power&quot; following the story of infiltration of the progressor Maxim Kammerer into the elite of the Island Empire.

In the late 1990s, a series of fiction by notable Russian sci-fi writers, titled &#x27;, was published in Russia with an endorsement of Boris Strugatsky. The pieces in the series build upon Strugatsky brothers&#x27; ideas and works, and many of them are set in the Noon Universe. In particular, Aleksandr Lukyanov wrote the novel &#x27;, author&#x27;s vision of what the novel &quot;White Ferz&quot; could have been. More various Strugatsky fanfics were published later.

From 1996 to 2015, there was a re-release of all Noon Universe novels as part of the &#x27; series. This re-release is notable being accompanied with introductory articles written by literary critics from the perspective of Noon Universe historians looking back on the events of the said novels several decades later, as well as with the excerpts of Boris Strugatsky&#x27;s memoirs &#x27;.

== Major personalities ==
* Lev Abalkin (Абалкин, Лев)
* Leonid Gorbovsky (Горбовcкий, Леонид)
* Maxim Kammerer (Каммерер, Максим)
* Gennady Komov (Комов, Геннадий)
* Rudolf Sikorski (Сикорски, Рудольф)
* Maya Glumova (Глумова, Майя)

== Planets ==
* Ark (Ковчег): described in &quot;Space Mowgli&quot;; a barren world very similar to Earth in all aspects except the biosphere, which is unbelievably poor. For example, the oceans of the planet are empty (no fish, no algae, no mammals) but are quite suitable for protein life. The planet was chosen by progressors as a refuge and a new home for the population of Pant, a planet in danger of a global natural catastrophe. The name was given after the biblical Ark built by Noah. Initial plans were to gradually change the biosphere of Ark to make it more similar to the Pantian one and then to transfer all Pantians to their new home. Considering the low technological advancement level of Pantians, they should not have noticed anything at all. However, the plan was canceled when the non-humanoid native civilization of Ark (Megaforms) was discovered. It is nowhere stated in Strugatsky&#x27;s books whether the &quot;Ark Project&quot; (started in 2160 AD) was ever completed and how. The local civilization of Ark is nearly as enigmatic as the Wanderers. An official contact with them was never established although the Ark Megaforms employed a human agent to communicate with progressors working on the surface of Ark. The agent was Piere &quot;The Kid&quot; Semyonov, a 13-year-old human whose parents died in 2147 when their spaceship &quot;Pilgrim&quot; was shot down by Wanderers&#x27; satellite. Although Megaforms negotiated (through their agent) to drive progressors away from their home world, no further attempt to share technologies or cultural developments was registered.
* Arkanar (Арканар): The capital of the Arkanar kingdom on an unnamed planet, the setting of the novel &quot;Hard to Be a God&quot;. The society is in the state of a feudal system. In some critical works on Strygatskys the planet is sometimes called Aurora, suggested by critic . There is a detailed description of Aurora based on the novel and Strugatskys&#x27;s interviews written by biologist, popular scientist and science fiction writer Sergey Yastrebov.
* &quot;Blue sands planet&quot;: the planet visited by the spaceship &quot;Taimyr&quot;, which returned in 2117.
* Earth (Земля).
* &quot;Garrota&quot; (Гаррота): the home planet of Garrotian snails (слизни Гарроты), a non-humanoid alien race that took humans and their technology for a product of their own imagination. The planet is briefly mentioned in &quot;Space Mowgli&quot;, and no further information about either the race or the planet is available.
* &quot;Giganda&quot; (Гиганда): a planet populated by humans, the native planet of the protagonist from &quot;The Kid from Hell&quot;. For a long time, the two superpowers of the planet, &quot;Alai Duchy&quot; and &quot;the Empire&quot;, were drawn into a total war conflict that has been ended only when Earth&#x27;s progressors started an undercover anti-war activity in 2177 AD. One of the planet&#x27;s natives, a teenager elite troops cadet of the Alai Duchy was taken to Earth and introduced to its advanced society. Despite repeated efforts to integrate him, he failed to adjust. He then chose to be returned to Giganda. Discovered in 2136 AD.
* Hope (Надежда): described briefly in &quot;Beetle in the Anthill&quot;, it is another planet populated by humans whose technological advancement is roughly equal to that of Earth in the 20th century. In approximately 2123 AD, a massive ecological catastrophe (probably a man-made one) devastated the planet causing its inhabitants to age at an unnatural pace after the twelfth year of life. Wanderers, apparently believing that a new, clean environment is the cure, have transported most of the population of Hope to an unknown planet using some sort of enhanced interplanetary transport (&quot;null-T&quot;), but few people decided to remain and became a subject of a consequent hunt by Wanderers through a sophisticated system of traps, especially for children. Discovered in 2162 AD.
* &quot;Leonida&quot; (Леонида): the home planet of Leonidans, a humanoid alien race that lives in a perfect symbiosis with the planet&#x27;s biosphere. Leonida is located in EN-23 system, its only moon is called Palmyra (Пальмира) and its day-night cycle lasts a bit longer than 27 hours. The planet was apparently the first one with an Earth-like climate suitable for humans&#x27; existence. The planet was perhaps named after its discoverer, Leonid Gorbovsky. Discovered in 2133 AD.
* &quot;Mars&quot;: the solar planet featured in the Noon Universe. Mars has complex forms of indigenous plant and animal life, but none is sentient. It also has many artifacts of an ancient supercivilization, assumed to be remnants of the Wanderers. An abandoned city is at the North Pole, and the moons Phobos and Deimos are discovered to be artificial satellites constructed by the Wanderers.
* &quot;Pandora&quot; (Пандора): a planetwide holiday resort. It is mostly covered with jungle swarming with dangerous alien fauna (like &quot;crayfish-spiders&quot; or &quot;tahorgs&quot;) that young people just love to hunt. Every year dozens of people are killed or seriously injured on Pandora despite countless safety measures by Earth&#x27;s government. No local sentient species are registered. Pandora is apparently located in a system with two suns. Pandora&#x27;s skies were a training ground for Goloans, when humans shared the space traveling technologies with them during the &quot;Golovans in Space&quot; project. Discovered before 2119 AD (exact date unknown).
* &quot;Panta&quot; (Панта): a planet endangered by a global catastrophe, an explosion of its own sun as a part of standard stellar evolution. Unfortunately, there were sentient species identical to humans on the planet and so they had to be deported from it (&quot;Ark Project&quot;) to another one. The first choice was Ark, but since the discovery of a sentient alien race there, progressors have apparently changed their mind. Discovered approximately in 2161 AD.
* &quot;Rainbow&quot; (Радуга): the setting of the novel &quot;Far Rainbow&quot;.
* &quot;Ruzhena&quot; (Ружена): an Earth-like planet in VK-71016 system. Valentin Petrov, the leader of the expedition that discovered it, named the planet after his wife, Ruzhena Naskova, but the planet was not really hospitable since two members of the spaceship crew perished on it, and Petrov himself lost an arm. &quot;Ruzhena&quot; is described in &quot;Частные предположения&quot;, a book tha has been never translated in English and contains only a vague connection to the Noon Universe.
* &quot;Saraksh&quot; (Саракш): the setting of the novel &quot;Prisoners of Power&quot;.
* &quot;Saula&quot; (Саула): the setting of the novel &quot;An Attempt to Escape&quot;.
* &quot;Tagora&quot; (Тагора): the home planet of Tagorians, a lizard-like alien race, the first one that Earth ever contacted. It is mentioned in &quot;An Attempt to Escape&quot; that there is a human resident (or spy) on Tagora whose name is presumably Benny Durov (Бенни Дуров) and that he is a progressor working under cover to study Tagorian technology. Discovered in the end of 21st century although full-scale contact was established in 2122 AD.
* &quot;Tissa&quot; (Тисса): a planet in EN-63061 system. It is famous mostly for an incident that happened shortly after a Freelance Search Group (FSG) expedition discovered it. For some reason, the members of the group could not establish a radio connection to any human world or spaceship except for their own mother ship on the orbit of Tissa, and its computers kept telling them that Earth and all other human settlements were destroyed by global catastrophes and that they are the only remaining humans in the universe. After the group was rescued, psychologists decided that was a case of temporary madness or a mass suggestion. Tissa is mentioned only in &quot;The Time Wanderers&quot;. Discovered in 2193 AD.
* &quot;Vladislava&quot; (Владислава): the first planet (apart from Mars) on which Wanderers&#x27; traces were found (artificial satellites and an abandoned city). Also, the planet is known for its extremely turbulent atmosphere, which was conquered only by famous Leonid Gorbovsky. However, there is some protein life on the planet, although none are sentient. Vladislava is located in EN-17 solar system. Discovered in 2121 AD.
* &quot;Yaila&quot; (Яйла): an even harsher and more dangerous version of Pandora. Infamous for its monstrous fauna (such as &quot;Yaila Dragon&quot;, presumably, a reptile with an enormous regeneration potential). Its impenetrable jungle and swamps make it considered by many to be just another planet-wide resort, but only the toughest and most experienced hunters generally dare to visit Yaila.

== Reception, analysis, and influence ==
The setting is a future utopia that gets gradually deconstructed as the authors become disillusioned with the Soviet Union and move away from the &quot;technological optimism... depicting a quasi-Marxist perfection&quot; to address the failures of the Soviet society. In writing about the Noon Universe, the Strugatsky brothers have been argued to have created their own utopian ideology, or &quot;amateur personal metaphysics&quot;, that is based on the primacy of science like more modern view of transhumanism.

Critic Ezra Glinter described the Noon Universe as a socialist utopia in which humanity has survived its crises but still has problems to solve, and in which the conflict is between &quot;the good and the better&quot;.

It has been suggested that James Cameron&#x27;s &quot;Avatar&quot;&#x27;s lush jungle planet has been inspired by the planet Pandora of Noon Universe.

Noon Universe&#x27;s human civilization has been described as techno-patriarchal and some of the antagonists as eco-matriarchal.

<text>Air Zimbabwe (Pvt) Ltd (operating as Air Zimbabwe) is the national carrier of Zimbabwe, headquartered on the property of Robert Gabriel Mugabe International Airport, in Harare. From its hub at Robert Gabriel Mugabe International Airport, the carrier used to operate a network within southern Africa that also included Asia and London-Gatwick. Following financial difficulties, Air Zimbabwe ceased operations in late February 2012. Serving a reduced domestic network, the carrier resumed operations for a short period between and early July 2012, when flights were again discontinued. Some flights were restarted on a discontinuous basis in that year. The airline resumed operating some domestic routes as well as the regional service to Johannesburg on a daily basis in April 2013.

The company has been a member of the International Air Transport Association, and of the African Airlines Association since 1981. , it is owned by the Government of Zimbabwe.

==History==

===Early years===
The entity that eventually became Air Zimbabwe formally came into being on 1 September 1967, when the Government of Rhodesia created &#x27;Air Rhodesia Corporation&#x27; to succeed Air Rhodesia, a wholly owned subsidiary of Central African Airways Corporation (CAAC) that had existed since 1964 as a domestic airline within Rhodesia. Following the dissolution of CAAC at the end of 1967, Air Rhodesia inherited CAAC operations, as well as a fleet of Boeing, DC-3 and Viscount aircraft. It became the short-lived &#x27;Air Zimbabwe Rhodesia&#x27; in 1978, and finally &#x27;Air Zimbabwe&#x27; in April 1980 when the Republic of Zimbabwe was formed. Services connecting Harare with South Africa (Durban and Johannesburg) had been operated before the country gained its independence. Scheduled services began on 2 April 1980 to London Gatwick. The company had leased a Boeing 707 from South African Airways until May 1981, when three Boeing 707-320Bs were bought from Lufthansa. That year, flights to Frankfurt were inaugurated. The airline recorded a ZWL 330,000 (£220,000) profit for the fiscal year that ended on 30 June 1980.
During 1982, a service to Perth and Sydney commenced; it was run in cooperation with Qantas and flown with Qantas Boeing 747SP aircraft. In that year, the Government directed Air Zimbabwe and the national freighter airline Affretair to merge their operations; the freighter company was eventually taken over by Air Zimbabwe in July 1983. The cargo carrier continued its operations under the Affretair brand. During 1983, Air Zimbabwe became a member of the International Air Transport Association (IATA); it also extended its regional routes to Gaborone, Lilongwe, Lusaka and Nairobi.
By March 1985, Air Zimbabwe had 1,443 employees and the fleet comprised five Boeing 707-320Bs and seven Viscount 700s. At this time, the airline flew domestic services linking Harare with Buffalo Range, Bulawayo, Gweru, Hwange National Park, Kariba, Masvingo and Victoria Falls, regional services to Blantyre, Durban, Gaborone, Johannesburg, Lusaka and Nairobi, and intercontinental flights to Athens, Frankfurt and London; the Harare–Perth–Sydney route offered using Qantas Boeing 747SP aircraft was flown in association with Air Zimbabwe. A Boeing 737-200 that had been leased from Maersk was returned to the lessor in 1986 and the first of three owned Boeing 737-200s was phased in and put into service in that year; the second and third aircraft of the type were delivered in and July 1987. The additional capacity permitted route extensions to Dar es Salaam, Manzini, Maputo and Mauritius. A BAe 146-200 was bought in 1987 for domestic routes. Also in 1987, the airline announced its intentions to acquire Ilyushin Il-62s and -86s and Yakovlev Yak-42s instead of Western-built aircraft. These plans never materialised and Air Zimbabwe placed an order for two Boeing 767-200s. With registration Z-WPE and named &quot;Victoria Falls&quot;, the first Boeing 767-200ER entered the fleet in November 1989. The Boeing 707 was retired from serving long-haul routes shortly afterwards; these aircraft were still used to cover regional routes. The Viscount was definitely withdrawn from service in November 1989. The airline phased in the second 767-200ER (Z-WPF, named &quot;Chimanimani&quot;) in late 1990. Two Fokker 50s were ordered in April 1995; they were delivered a month later.

===Financial turmoil and service disruption===
In February 2004, it was revealed that the company had been temporarily suspended by the IATA over unpaid debts. In late October 2006, the prices of Air Zimbabwe tickets increased up to 500%, partly due to the inflation in the country rising to over 1,000%—at that time the Zimbabwean Central Bank stated that it could not continue supporting Air Zimbabwe and other money-losing state companies—and partly because the airline was in need of foreign currency to pay for fuel, spare parts, and catering. A foreign exchange crisis in the country led to the cancellation of the carrier&#x27;s operations in late 2005, following the lack of hard currency to pay for the fuel. In 2006, it was disclosed that passenger numbers had fallen from 1 million in 1999 to 23,000 in 2005.

In May 2011, the airline was suspended from IATA&#x27;s international financial and booking system over unpaid booking fees. It was announced in early November 2011 that the government would absorb a  million debt in order to make the company more attractive to foreign investors. Already in December 2011, the carrier struggled to provide its regional and overseas services amid aircraft impoundments over unpaid debts.

In January 2012, the airline came under judicial management. Following a failed revival attempt, in which the pilots refused to resume domestic services over  million in unpaid salaries and allowances, it was announced on 24 February 2012 that Air Zimbabwe would be grounded indefinitely. In March of the same year, the government of Zimbabwe established &quot;Air Zimbabwe Private Limited&quot; as the new owner of the carrier after disbanding the airline&#x27;s former parastatal owner &quot;Air Zimbabwe Holdings&quot; and absorbing a  million debt. The airline resumed flying on a continuous basis in early May 2012, yet using a single aircraft and serving only three domestic destinations—Bulawayo, Harare and Victoria Falls—and only for a short period of time until the grounding of the aircraft on 2 July 2012. The airline was reactivated in late November 2012, with a reduced flight scheme serving the Harare–Johannesburg route. Reports indicated the carrier resumed domestic operations connecting Bulawayo, Harare and Victoria Falls, as well as the regional route to Johannesburg, on a daily basis in April 2013, ahead of the &quot;2013 Zimbabwe International Trade Fair&quot;. Approximately 600 employees out of more than 1,000 had been laid off by late May 2013 as part of cost-cutting measures aimed at recapitalising the airline. The Zimbabwe Tourism Authority revealed in June 2013 that the airline&#x27;s market share suffered a steep decrease in the year ending 31 December 2012, with a 0.8% participation in this period down from 27% in the same period of 2009.

In May 2017 Air Zimbabwe was added to the list of air carriers banned in the European Union as a result of not meeting EU safety standards.

, Air Zimbabwe&#x27;s debts were estimated to be  million. On 8 June 2018, it was reported that Air Zimbabwe has debts of more than $300 million and can no longer fly to most destinations due to threats by debtors to impound its aircraft. With mounting debt and only three of its aircraft operational, the airline was put under administration on 6 October 2018.

On 26 March 2020, the airline was forced to suspend all flights indefinitely due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The airline was subsequently forced to put all employees on unpaid leave and was in the process of creating a post-pandemic masterplan. It returned to flying domestic routes in September and regional routes in October 2020.

By March 2023, Air Zimbabwe reported clearing its debt to IATA, and was hoping to resume London-Harare flights.

== Corporate affairs ==

===Ownership and management===
Since March 2012 the airline has been operated through Air Zimbabwe Private Limited, which is wholly owned by the Zimbabwe Government, although there have long been plans to privatise the airline in some degree.

Chipo Dyanda is the airline chairwoman, . In October 2016, Simba Chikore was appointed to be the Chief Operating Officer (COO), amid much controversy and accusations of nepotism as he is also the son-in-law to Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe. Captain Ripton Muzenda was appointed as the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) in late August 2016. He eventually, resigned 15 months after his appointment, ultimately suing the company for allegedly violating contract terms. Simba resigned from Air Zimbabwe in November 2017.

===Business trends===
Air Zimbabwe has been loss-making for many years, with irregular services. Although the airline is government owned, full annual reports are not published. Audited accounts were last presented in 2008, and despite press reports that audits have been completed for the years 2009 to 2012, these do not appear to have been published.

Various performance figures have been publicly professed, but are subject to change and may therefore not be accurate (for example, the number of employees have allegedly remained fixed in recent years). Recent financial figures (2014 to 2018) are from the &#x27;Reconstruction Report&#x27; by the airline administrator Grant Thornton, as reported by the &quot;Zimbabwe Independent&quot;. Publicised figures (for years ending 31 December):

===Network development===
The Harare–Beijing service was launched in November 2004, following an increase of the Chinese–Zimbabwean economic ties. Likewise, the carrier added Kuala Lumpur to its network in 2009. A capacity boost was disclosed to occur on the Harare–London-Gatwick route effective 1 April 2011. The Harare–London route that was once served by both British Airways and Air Zimbabwe had become one of the most lucrative routes for Air Zimbabwe since the British carrier discontinued the service in 2007.

As part of its recovery strategy, the airline in April 2020 has launched a comprehensive revival plan. The airline is planning new routes from Victoria Falls, as well as from Harare.
Victoria Falls will connect local resorts (Buffalo Range, Kariba, Matopos, and Hwange) and regional destinations in Windhoek (Namibia), Maun (Botswana) and Cape Town (South Africa). 
The main Harare hub will introduce regular flights to Lusaka (Zambia), Cape Town, Dubai (UAE) and Lubumbashi and Kinshasa (both in the Democratic Republic of Congo). through to Dubai in the United Arab Emirates (UAE).

In February 2011 the airline temporarily suspended its flights to Johannesburg over likely impoundments of its planes by creditors due to unpaid debts. Regional and domestic services were suspended for a short period in May 2011, following both the grounding of its Boeing 737-200 fleet by the Civil Aviation Authority of Zimbabwe (CAAZ) over maintenance concerns, and the impoundment of a leased aircraft from Zambezi Airlines over a unpaid debt. Operations resumed in late May 2011, following an agreement between the two airlines, yet the aircraft was repossessed by the owner in late June 2011. In mid-June 2011, flights to London and South Africa were temporarily suspended because of a due debt with fuel suppliers. Owing both to the grounding of the 737-200 fleet and to fuel shortages in the country, domestic services were suspended and regional flights were operated on an irregular basis. The airline started regularising medium- and short-haul operations in July 2011, as it got clearance from the CAAZ to operate one of its three grounded 737-200. Operations were discontinued again in late July 2011, this time due to a pilots&#x27; strike, resuming in mid-September after a 50-day-long strike. Once again, overseas and domestic flights were temporarily cancelled in early November 2011, this time owing to an unpaid debt with fuel providers. Overseas routes resumed on 11 November 2011. However, flights to the United Kingdom and South Africa were suspended in January 2012 over likely impoundments of the airline&#x27;s aircraft for outstanding debts.

===Overview===
Following is a list of destinations Air Zimbabwe flies to, according to its scheduled services, . Terminated destinations are also shown.

==Fleet==

===Current fleet===
, the Air Zimbabwe fleet consists of the following aircraft:
===Historic fleet===
The airline previously operated the following aircraft:
* BAe 146-100

* Boeing 707-320B
* Boeing 737-500
* Fokker 50
* Viscount 700
* Viscount 800
===Fleet development===
Two Viscount 800s were purchased from Dan-Air in the early 1980s, to replace the Viscount 700s inherited from Air Rhodesia that were near the end of their life; these aircraft flew for the company until their retirement in 1989.

The initial fleet of five Boeing 707s sourced from Lufthansa replaced the Boeing 720 aircraft used by Air Rhodesia. These 707s joined the Vickers Viscount fleet, that was strengthened by the addition of two Viscounts 810s from Dan Air. The airline saw the incorporation of the Boeing 737-200 into the fleet in 1985. Long-haul operations that were once operated with the 707s were gradually shifted to the newly acquired Boeing 767-200ER aircraft; the first of them entered the fleet in late 1989. A British Aerospace BAe 146 was added to the fleet from the Zimbabwean Air force in the 1980s. Leased Fokker 50s were used from 1995 but proved unsuitable to the hot and high conditions and were returned to the lessor.

In late 2010 the airline announced it had ordered two Airbus A340-500s to serve the Harare–Beijing and Harare–London routes; the order was later cancelled after the company failed to raise the money. In late June 2011, Air Zimbabwe was forced to return the Boeing 737-500 it was hiring from Zambezi Airlines to partially compensate the lack of equipment following the grounding of its Boeing 737-200 fleet, as it was unable to afford the costs of its leasing. The aircraft was mainly used to operate the Harare–Johannesburg route; it was disclosed the company had to fly the route using one of their Boeing 767s.

Despite versions for the acquisition of new aircraft were officially declined in July 2011 owing to a precarious cash position, it was disclosed that the airline bought an Airbus A340-500 and an Airbus A320, both new, in August 2011. , there had been discrepant versions over the acquisition of new Airbus aircraft, since the secretary of the Zimbabwean Ministry of Transport has denied the transaction, but there exist records for the delivery of an A320 to the company. The introduction of A320 services was informed in May 2013, when it replaced the Boeing 767s on the Harare–Johannesburg route. 

On 20 January 2020, the airline received the first of 2 Boeing 777-200 jets from Malaysia Airlines.

==Accidents and incidents==
According to the Aviation Safety Network, the company has not had a fatal accident since Air Rhodesia was renamed Air Zimbabwe in 1980. The only hull-loss accident is listed below.

*July 1984: A Vickers 756D Viscount, registration Z-YNI, was damaged beyond repair in an incident on the grounds of Harare International Airport. It was withdrawn from service and transferred to the airport fire department for use as a training aid.

In June 1999 the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; published a story, later withdrawn, in which the reporter Gaby Plattner claimed she had flown from Kariba to Hwange on an Air Zimbabwe service, and that the flight departed without a co-pilot, and during the flight the pilot was locked out of the cockpit, and had to use an axe to chop down the door. The newspaper later stated that this story was untrue. The carrier then sued the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; and also CNN, after it ran a story claiming it was the most dangerous airline in the world.

<doc id="916244" wikidata="Q368884" url="?curid=916244" title="Chrysler Cordoba">
<text>The Chrysler Cordoba was introduced as a full-sized luxury car based on the Chrysler Newport that was marketed during the 1970 model year. It was also applied to a show car exhibited that year. 

The nameplate was then applied to an intermediate-sized two-door personal luxury car starting with the 1975 model year. The Cordoba was manufactured by Chrysler in North America over two generations until the 1983 model year. 

The personal luxury version was the company&#x27;s first model produced specifically for that market segment and the first Chrysler-branded vehicle smaller than full-size. 

The name was taken from the Spanish city of Córdoba, Spain.

==Background==

In the early 1960s, when other upmarket brands were expanding into smaller cars with such models as the Mercury Comet and Buick Skylark, Chrysler publicly declared that there would &quot;never&quot; be a smaller Chrysler. The 1962 full line catalog proclaims on the rear cover: &quot;There&#x27;s not a jr. edition in the whole family!&quot;. The 1963 Chrysler prestige catalog described the New Yorker models as having &quot;no jr. edition car.&quot;

==Cordoba de Oro concept==

Chrysler developed a concept car, the Cordoba de Oro, which was shown at the 1970 Chicago Auto Show. Designed by Chrysler’s design chief, Elwood Engel, the show car was future-oriented with an angular wedge-shaped body that later evolved into the “fuselage aesthetic.&quot; Its advanced features included a cantilevered roof with no A-pillars between the windshield and the side windows, as well as a thermostatically controlled air intake with horizontal experimental headlights inside the grille.

==1970 Newport Cordoba==

The Chrysler Newport Cordoba name was introduced in the spring of 1970 as a specially trimmed individual model based on the Chrysler Newport available in either two-door or four-door hardtop body designs. This full-size model was a &quot;limited edition luxury car, designed to introduce you to Chrysler&quot; and consisted of an exclusive &quot;Cordoba Gold&quot; paint with matching wheels, wheel covers, and grille fascia, the side molding had textured vinyl inserts, an &quot;Espanol&quot; vinyl roof cover featured a distinctive pattern, and the hood ornament included an &quot;Aztec&quot; eagle. The Aztec motif continued into the interior with textured antique gold vinyl seats and door panels as well as special dash and glovebox appliqué. Chrysler marketing described these as a &quot;quiet Spanish motif&quot;. 

Included in the base price were the two-barrel carburetor V8 along with a special gold vinyl roof as well as the exterior and interior Axtec trim. Adding an automatic transmission, power steering, H78x15 fiberglass-belted whitewall tires, and a &quot;golden tone&quot; AM radio raised the price to $4,241.65. A total of 3,741 Newport Cordobas were produced for 1970, of which 1,868 were two-door hardtops, and 1,873 were four-door hardtops.

==Development==

Chrysler initially designed the 1974 Cordoba to be the all-new Plymouth Sebring for 1975, which was to share bodies with the Dodge Charger SE. Instead, a decision was made to position the model as a personal luxury car and introduce it as the first small Chrysler. The Cordoba was available with smaller, more economical engines than other Chryslers, and rode on a wheelbase, less than its next largest sibling. 

Córdoba is the name of a city in Spain, which was intended to evoke some noteworthy meaning with customers. However, the only thing remotely Hispanic about Chrysler Cordoba was its name. Even the car&#x27;s emblem is a stylized version of the Argentine cordoba coin, and there is also a Córdoba Province, Argentina.

The marketing theme was also carried out with the somewhat baroque trim inside the vehicle. The first spokesperson for the car was Richard Basehart; however, Chrysler secured movie and television actor Ricardo Montalbán as the car&#x27;s advertising spokesman through its entire run. Notable was his eloquent praise of its &quot;rich Corinthian leather&quot; interior.

Chrysler had previously sought to evoke a Spanish exotic flair in their products when they introduced the 1929 DeSoto Six with model names of &quot;cupe&quot;, &quot;coche&quot; and &quot;de Lujo&quot;, or Spanish for &quot;coupe&quot;, &quot;coach&quot;, and &quot;deluxe&quot;, while the roadster was called the &quot;Roadster Espanol&quot;.

The single-body style coupe model was one of Chrysler&#x27;s few genuine successes during the 1970s. At a time when the automaker was teetering on bankruptcy, demand for Cordobas exceeded supply for its first years, with the production of over 150,000 units for the inaugural 1975 models, and the highest number built in 1977, with 183,000 units. Half of the Chrysler division production during this period (and occasionally more) was composed of Cordobas. This model helped to revive the division. The model combined &quot;just the right amount of amount of neoclassic styling with the prestige of the Chrysler nameplate.&quot;

==First generation (1975–1979)==
The Cordoba was introduced by Chrysler for the 1975 model year as an upscale personal luxury car, competing with the Oldsmobile Cutlass, Buick Regal, and Mercury Cougar. However, the Cordoba was initially intended to be marketed under the Plymouth marque. Model names Mirada, Premier, Sebring, and Grand Era were associated during the development project. All except Grand Era would be used on later Chrysler, Dodge, and Eagle vehicles, though only the Dodge Mirada would be related to the Cordoba. However, losses from the newly introduced full-size C-body models due to the 1973 oil crisis encouraged Chrysler executives to seek higher profits by marketing the model under the more upscale Chrysler brand. 

The car was a success, with over 150,000 units sold in 1975, a sales year that was otherwise dismal for the company. Gauges, except the tachometer, were standard. For the 1976 model year, sales increased slightly to 165,000. The mildly revised 1977 version also sold well, with just under 140,000 cars. The success of using the Chrysler nameplate strategy is contrasted to the far fewer sales of its similar and somewhat cheaper corporate cousin, the Dodge Charger SE.

Interiors were more luxurious than the Dodge Charger SE and much more than the top-line standard intermediates (Plymouth Fury, Dodge Coronet) with a velour cloth notchback bench seat and folding armrest standard. Optionally available were bucket seats upholstered in Corinthian leather with a center armrest and cushion, or, at extra cost, a center console with floor shifter and storage compartment. The dashboard and door panels featured simulated burled elm trim and metal stampings in 1975, while the 1976 through 1979 models featured simulated rosewood trim. A 60/40 bench seat was introduced in 1976, and other seating/upholstery options were added each year through 1979. The first-generation B-body Cordoba was very opulent for the price.

The original design endured only minor changes for three years before various factors contributed to a decline in sales. For 1978, there was a modest restyling with the then-popular rectangular headlights in a stacked configuration (the Dodge Charger SE kept its round headlamps for 1978 rather than the rectangular stacked design of the Cordoba). A Chrysler designer, Jeffrey Godshall, wrote in &quot;Collectible Automobile&quot; magazine that this restyling was viewed as &quot;somewhat tacky&quot; and eliminated much of the visual appeal that 1975 through 1977 Cordobas had been known for. The restyle also made the car appear heavier than the predecessor versions at a time when other cars in this class were being downsized to smaller dimensions such as the Ford Thunderbird in 1977 as well as the Chevrolet Monte Carlo and Pontiac Grand Prix in 1978.

The Cordoba&#x27;s sales decline in 1978 and 1979 could also be attributed to the introduction of the smaller Chrysler LeBaron in mid-1977 which was available in both sedan and coupe models and offered similar personal-luxury styling and options. At the same time, Chrysler&#x27;s financial position and quality reputation were in steady decline. Rising gas prices and tightening fuel economy standards made the Cordoba&#x27;s nearly weight with or V8 engines obsolete.

For 1979 a $2,040 &quot;300&quot; option package was offered on the Cordoba, featuring an all-white exterior, &quot;Chrysler 300&quot;-style grille, and a four-barrel 360 V8 engine. The Chrysler 300 was advertised and marketed as a separate model, not as a &quot;Cordoba 300.&quot;


==Second generation (1980–1983)==
The Cordoba was downsized for the 1980 model year. The smaller, second-generation model used the J-platform dating to the 1976 F-body Plymouth Volaré, and its rebadged variant, the Dodge Mirada. Chrysler also revived the Imperial for 1981 as a third variant of the J-platform.

The Cordoba and Mirada standard engine was the Slant six rated at . The detuned V8 was an option (standard on the Imperial, with EFI), and the (code E58) V8. This higher-output option was not popular, with fewer than 100 cars ordered and was discontinued after the 1980 model year.

The 1980 and 1981 LS model (which was intended to be the &quot;300&quot;) featured an aerodynamic-appearing nosecone (nearly identical to that on the &quot;Mirada&quot;) with a &quot;crosshair&quot; grille. Other features of this model were the deletion of the vinyl roof cover and a monotone color exterior.

The second-generation Cordoba sales were down substantially. The U.S. automobile industry&#x27;s downsizing of vehicles also affected personal luxury models. For example, the Chevrolet Monte Carlo shrank in size in 1978 and the Ford Thunderbird was downsized for the 1980 model year. 

With changes in the marketplace, Chrysler increasingly concentrated on its compact, front wheel drive models with four and six-cylinder engines. The Cordoba was discontinued in 1983.

===Powertrains===
The Slant-6 was standard and the V8 optional for the 1981 through 1983 model years.


==NASCAR==

Both the first- and second-generation Cordobas appeared in NASCAR. Ed Negre campaigned on occasion during the 1978 and 1979 seasons. Buddy Arrington ran a second-generation car in the 1982 through 1984 seasons, alternating with Dodge Miradas and Chrysler Imperials. The Cordoba was no more aerodynamic than the other Mopars. The owner/driver never won a race, but was &quot;able to collect 26 top 10s and $334,000 in career earnings.&quot;

==Collectibility==
There are examples of Chrysler Cordobas available for collectors. However, the cars were not viewed as valuable or worth saving after the 1990s, with good examples going to the scrap yards. There is not much aftermarket support for these vehicles so collectors may encounter challenges if a complete restoration is needed.

Regarding the 300 version, &quot;Consumer Guide&quot; described in 2007 that &quot;the &#x27;79 could become a minor collectible in the distant future, but LS prospects seem slim to non-existent at this time.&quot;

<text>Peter Benjamin Lewis (November 11, 1933 – November 23, 2013) was an American businessman who was the chairman of Progressive Insurance Company.

==Early life and education==
Lewis was raised in a Jewish family in Cleveland Heights, Ohio, the oldest of four children born to Helen and Joseph Lewis. His father — who had co-founded a small auto insurance company named Progressive Insurance with Jack Green in 1937 — was grooming Lewis to work at the company when he died at age 48 while Lewis was a junior at Cleveland Heights High School. He graduated with an A.B. in politics from Princeton University in 1955 after completing a senior thesis titled &quot;The Financially Irresponsible Motorist -a Problem in Practical Politics.&quot;

==Career==
After college, Lewis joined Progressive Insurance as an underwriting trainee. In 1965, he and his mother borrowed $2.5 million, pledging their majority stake as collateral, and completed a leveraged buyout of Progressive. Lewis became chief executive officer of a company which had 40 employees at that time. He subsequently grew the business and, by the 1960s, Progressive had over 100 employees and $6 million in annual revenue. Lewis focused on insuring high-risk drivers — where premiums were greater — using an innovative pricing system and consumer-friendly service offering competitor quote matching and instant claims service. He also brought in a slew of young, enthusiastic workers and devolved decision-making downward, fostering a relaxed yet disciplined and creative corporate culture.

As of 2010, Progressive had grown to 27,250 employees, with sales of $15.0 billion and had become the third-largest auto insurance company in the United States. In 2000, Lewis retired as CEO of Progressive, though he remained as chairman of the board.

==Philanthropy and political contributions==
Lewis frequently donated money to charities and liberal political groups. He was a patron of the arts, even going so far as to display Andy Warhol&#x27;s 10-part series of China&#x27;s Chairman Mao Zedong in 1974 at Progressive&#x27;s office in Mayfield Village. Lewis&#x27;s personal and corporate contemporary art collection is well known — the corporate collection is displayed at Progressive Insurance offices.

In September 2012 Lewis signed the Giving Pledge promising to give at least half his wealth to charity.
Lewis made donations to:

* Princeton University (A Frank Gehry designed science library, $60 million; the Lewis-Sigler Institute for Integrative Genomics, $55 million; Lewis Center for the Arts, $101 million. Total $233 million to date.)
* Case Western Reserve University (The Weatherhead School of Management Peter B. Lewis Building, another Frank Gehry design, $36.9 million, out of $61.7 total building cost)
* Marijuana Policy Project (Donated $3,000,000 to MPP in 2007.) 
* The Guggenheim Museum ($50 million)
* America Coming Together and MoveOn.org (with George Soros matching his $10 and $2.5 million, respectively)
* American Civil Liberties Union $15 million
* The Democratic Party
* Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies-sponsored MDMA/PTSD Research in the US, Switzerland and Israel $750,000 [www.maps.org]
* Menorah Park (Peter B. Lewis Aquatic &amp; Therapy Center)
* Traction
* Support of California&#x27;s Proposition 19 also known as the Regulate, Control &amp; Tax Cannabis Act (Donation of $159,005 on 10/15/2010)
* Support for Washington Initiative 502 with contributions totaling $2,038,700
* Oberlin College (The Peter B. Lewis Gateway Center, a hotel and conference center that will be the cornerstone of Oberlin&#x27;s Green Arts District; $5 million gift out of a total cost of $32 million.)

Lewis was a trustee of Princeton University, former chairman of the board of directors at the Guggenheim Museum (resigned January 19, 2005), and served on the board of the Cleveland Museum of Art. Although Lewis often gave substantial gifts to artistic and educational organizations, he also had a reputation for — often forcefully — insisting that such organizations be financially accountable and financially sound; in 2002, Lewis said he would no longer give to Case or Cleveland&#x27;s University Circle neighborhood or to any Cleveland Charities due to poor civic and organizational leadership and management. While he did restrict Cleveland giving, he did not follow through completely on that threat.

Lewis was an advocate of taxing and regulating the use and sale of marijuana and was one of the main financial backers of the campaign to legalize the use of marijuana for medical use in the United States. In January 2000, Lewis was arrested and charged in New Zealand for possession of marijuana. Lewis pleaded guilty to three charges and paid a substantial fine, though under New Zealand law he was not required to serve time in jail or prison. According to his lawyer, Marie Dyhrberg, Lewis used the marijuana on the advice of his doctor for pain relief after the partial amputation of his leg in 1998.

==Personal life==
In 1955, Lewis married Toby Devan. They amicably divorced in 1981. They had three children: Ivy, Jonathan and Adam Joseph. He had homes in Miami, Cleveland, New York City, and Aspen, Colorado; he also traveled around the world on his motor yacht, &quot;Lone Ranger&quot;. Since 1985, his ex-wife Toby, who had worked at the Cleveland Center for Contemporary Art, took over the expansive Progressive art collection.

In September 2013, he married his long-time companion, Janet Rosel of Cleveland.

Lewis died of a heart attack at his home in Coconut Grove, Florida, on November 23, 2013, twelve days after his 80th birthday. He was interred at Mayfield Cemetery in Cleveland Heights, Ohio. His net worth at the time of his death was $1.25 billion.

<doc id="916249" wikidata="Q8031228" url="?curid=916249" title="Women in the world wars">
<text>During both world wars, women were required to undertake new roles in their respective national war efforts. Women across the world experienced severe setbacks as well as considerable societal progress during this timeframe. The two world wars hinged as much on industrial production as they did on battlefield clashes. While some women managed to enter the traditionally male career paths, women, for the most part, were expected to be primarily involved in &quot;duties at home&quot; and &quot;women&#x27;s work,&quot; especially after the wars were over. On the other hand, the two wars also victimized women and subjected them to numerous incidences of sexual violence, abuse, and death.

During World War I, women in the Western world, including Europe, Canada, and the United States, contributed to the war efforts on both the home fronts and the battlefields. Women&#x27;s employment rates skyrocketed in domestic and industrial sectors. Nursing became one of the most popular professions in military employment during these years. In Asia, women&#x27;s labor in the cotton and silk industries became essential for the economy. Before 1914, few countries, including New Zealand, Australia, and several Scandinavian nations, had given women the right to vote (see Women&#x27;s suffrage). Still, otherwise, women were minimally involved in the political process. Women&#x27;s participation in WWI fostered the support and development of the suffrage movement, including in the United States.

During the Second World War, women&#x27;s contributions to industrial labor in factories located on the home front kept society and the military running while the world was in chaos. Women in the Western World also gained more opportunities to serve directly in their country&#x27;s armed forces, which they had limited opportunities to do in WWI. At the same time, women faced a significant amount of abuse during this time; the Japanese military systematically raped women across Asia, and Jewish women were physically abused, raped, and murdered in Nazi concentration camps across Europe.

The participation of women in the world wars catalyzed the later recruitment of women in many countries&#x27; armed forces. Women&#x27;s involvement in these wartime efforts exposed their commitment to serving their country and preserving national security and identity.

==World War I==

===Europe===

In Great Britain just before World War I, there were 24 million adult women, and 1.7 million worked in domestic service, 200,000 worked in the textile manufacturing industry, 600,000 worked in the clothing trades, 500,000 worked in commerce, and 260,000 worked in local and national government, including teaching. The British textile and clothing trades, in particular, employed far more women than men and were regarded as &#x27;women&#x27;s work.&#x27; By 1914 nearly. 5.09 million out of the 23.8 million women in Britain were working. Thousands worked in munitions factories (see Canary Girl, Gretna Girls), offices, and large hangars to build aircraft. Women were also involved in knitting socks for the soldiers on the front, as well as other voluntary work, but as a matter of survival, women had to work for paid employment for the sake of their families. Many women worked as volunteers serving at the Red Cross, encouraged the sale of war bonds, or planted &quot;victory gardens.&quot;

The First World War allowed women in Great Britain to participate in the workforce, including assembly lines. In Great Britain, this was known as a process of &quot;Dilution&quot; and was strongly contested by the trade unions, particularly in the engineering and shipbuilding industries. For the duration of both world wars, women sometimes did take on skilled &quot;men&#x27;s work.&quot; However, by the agreement negotiated with the trade unions, women undertaking jobs covered by the Dilution agreement lost their jobs at the end of the First World War.

Although women were still paid less than men in the workforce, pay inequalities were starting to diminish as women were now getting paid two-thirds of the typical pay for men, a 28% increase. However, the extent of this change is open to historical debate. In part because of female participation in the war effort, Canada, the United States, Great Britain, and several European countries extended suffrage to women in the years after the First World War.

British historians no longer emphasize the granting of woman suffrage as a reward for women&#x27;s participation in war work. Historian Martin D. Pugh argues that senior politicians primarily determined women&#x27;s suffrage. The suffragettes had been weakened, Pugh argues, by repeated failures before 1914 and by the disorganizing effects of war mobilization; therefore, they quietly accepted these age-related restrictions, which were approved in 1918 by a majority of the War Ministry and each political party in Parliament. More generally, G. R. Searle(2004) argues that the British debate was essentially over by the 1890s and that granting suffrage in 1918 was primarily a byproduct of voting for male soldiers. Women in Britain finally achieved suffrage on the same terms as men in 1928.

Nursing became almost the only area of female contribution that involved being at the front and experiencing the war. In Britain, Queen Alexandra&#x27;s Royal Army Nursing Corps, First Aid Nursing Yeomanry, and Voluntary Aid Detachment started before World War I. The VADs were not allowed in the front line until 1915.

In other European countries, such as in the 1918 Finnish Civil War, more than 2,000 women fought in the paramilitary Women&#x27;s Red Guards. The only belligerent to deploy female combat troops in substantial numbers was the Russian Provisional Government in 1917. Its few &quot;Women&#x27;s Battalions&quot; fought well but failed to provide the expected propaganda value and were disbanded before the end of the year. In the later Russian Civil War, the Bolsheviks employed women infantry.

Women living in present-day Slovakia, under the rule of the Habsburg monarchy at the time of the First World War, only sometimes upheld the pro-war attitude that dominated central Europe. Furthermore, their dissenting attitudes towards war heightened, especially when members of their own families, such as their husbands, were conscripted into the army. Women expressed their disapproval by creating feminist organizations such as the Hungarian Feminist&#x27;s Association to encourage pacifism. Habsburg monarchy women also expressed their disapproval through public protestation.

=== United States ===
The involvement of women in World War I played a vital role in the U.S.’s victory. They filled in the jobs the men left behind to fight in the war. Women did not physically fight in combat, but their contribution consisted of behind-the-scenes work at home, raising money, and working to keep the country up and running. Without the efforts of women, tens of thousands of men needed at the front would have been tied to jobs in agriculture, industry, and home-front military and not available for wartime service, and the success of America&#x27;s military effort may have been in the balance. Every housewife in the U.S. was asked to sign a pledge card that had to food and assignments completed.

Thousands of women in the United States formed and/or joined organizations that worked to bring relief to the war-torn countries in Europe, even before official American entry into the war in April 1917. Everyone contributed to the efforts of the war regardless of their social class. Upper-class women were the primary founders and members of voluntary wartime organizations, mainly because they could afford to devote much of their time and money to these efforts.  Middle- and lower-class women also participated in these organizations and drives, although they were more likely to serve as nurses in the military or replace men in their jobs on the home front as the men went off to war.  For the first time in American history, women from every part of the class spectrum were serving in the war in some capacity.

There were many tasks and jobs that the women did that went unaccounted for in history because they mainly focused on the contribution of the men in the war. Women in World War I revealed the vast jobs that they did, such as enlisting in the navy, army, and factory jobs. They became members of the social welfare program entitled the American Red Cross. They assigned duties that would help out the soldiers that were overseas, such as organizing bloods drives, giving vaccinations, and packaging food. Women worked locally within their state by aiding traveling soldiers and raising money to support the war efforts. Furthermore, women serving for the American Red Cross also had the opportunity to serve in Europe, where the war was mostly taking place. Abroad, these women worked as nurses, recreational volunteers, chemists, and more.Over 12,000 women were enlisted in auxiliary roles in the United States Navy and Marine Corps during the First World War. About 400 of them died in that war.

===Asia===
Thousands of migrants came from Asia to Europe during WWI in order to assist with the war efforts in Great Britain, with approximately 92,000 war workers coming from China alone. European powers relied on a male labor force in winning the war, thus leaving families divided at home.

In the years leading up to the First World War, the cotton and silk industries grew exponentially in Japan. More than 80% of Japanese female citizens worked in these textile industries during and nearing the end of WWI. Their working conditions were poor, as the female employees were subjected to malnutrition and serious illnesses such as tuberculosis while living together in unsanitary dormitories.

=== Canada ===
Over 2,800 women served with the Royal Canadian Army Medical Corps during the First World War and it was during that era that the role of Canadian women in the military first extended beyond nursing. Women were given paramilitary training in small arms, drill, first aid and vehicle maintenance in case they were needed as home guards. Forty-three women in the Canadian military died during WWI.

==World War II==

===The United States===
During WWII, 6 million women were added to the workforce, resulting in a major cultural shift. With the men fighting in the wars, women were needed to take on responsibilities that the men had to leave behind.

Women in World War II took on various roles from country to country. World War II involved global conflict on an unprecedented scale; the absolute urgency of mobilizing the entire population made the expansion of the role of women inevitable. Rosie the Riveter became an emblem of women&#x27;s dedication to traditional male labor.

With this expanded horizon of opportunity and confidence and the extended skill base that many women could now give to paid and voluntary employment, women&#x27;s roles in World War II were even more extensive than in the First World War. By 1945, more than 2.2 million women worked in war industries, especially in munitions plants. They participated in building ships, aircraft, vehicles, and weaponry. Women also worked on farms, drove trucks, provided logistic support for soldiers, and entered professional areas of work that were previously the preserve of men. In the Allied countries, thousands of women enlisted as nurses in front-line units. According to historian D’Ann Campbell, “Between 1942 and 1945, 140,000 women served in the WACs, 100,000 in the WAVES, 23,000 in the Marines, 13,000 in the SPARS, and 74,000 in the Army and Navy Nurse Corps”. Women became officially recognized as a permanent part of the U.S. armed forces after the war with the passing of the Women&#x27;s Armed Services Integration Act of 1948.

Out of one million African Americans serving in WWII, 600,000 of them were women. Four thousand women served in the Women&#x27;s Army Corps, and 330 served as nurses. African-American women fought for African-American rights through media, social activism, etc. A person&#x27;s race was heavily divided, and in the year 1943, there were a documented 242 violent events against African Americans regardless of whether they served in the war effort or not.

The Second World War also expanded labor employment opportunities for black women across the United States. Specifically, industrial labor became more common among black females, as black female employment in the industrial sector increased by 11.5% during this time. Nearing the end of the war, black females working in industrial occupations were the first to be fired from their jobs; as a result, they then turned to professions such as maids or laundry pressers.

===Europe===
Several hundred thousand women in European countries served in combat roles, especially in anti-aircraft units.[] Many women served in the major government organizations such as the OSS. These operations were mainly used as counterintelligence and spying sorts of activity. Such is the case in Operation Sauerkraut, where women were used in Allied POW camps to convert German and Czech POWs into Allied propaganda machines and then would be sent back over the lines and into Germany.

Women were used quite frequently in many roles during and in the French Resistance towards Nazi oppression with roughly 12% of all resistance fighters being women.  

The French Forces of the Interior (FFI) began to see the importance of using women during the war and thus many gender roles and standards were dropped to accompany these new demands for participants in the resistance. These women then began to take on the same jobs and roles as French men such as scouting out German troops and movements, helping to guide Allied troops, and even helping to sweep out any remaining Germans from captured or Allied-occupied towns and regions.

Women in groups such as the Office of Strategic Services (OSS) also helped aid the resistance fighters by supplying firearms, ammunition, and other important resources to the cause and resistance. United States groups supplied many of these resources such as small pistols known as the &quot;liberator&quot; which was pocketable and easy to conceal in a purse or coat. Resistance women used these to great success in taking out German troops in heavily occupied cities and towns in order to gain more German resources for resistance use. 
Germany had presented an ideal female role at home, but the urgent need for war production led to the hiring of millions of German women for factory and office work. Even so, the Nazi regime declared the role of women in German society to strictly fall along the lines of motherhood. Yet, the role of motherhood was only offered to white, German blooded women because the Nazi regime promoted the sterilization of women for “reasons of racial hygiene”.

Jewish women were encouraged to obtain an abortion in order to limit the increase of Jewish genetics, and a series of mass sterilizations occurred in Nazi concentration camps. Beyond mass sterilizations, women in concentration camps across Europe in the Second World War experienced sexual violence and abuse by many SS guards, though the notion that the camps fostered a systematic rape of its prisoners has not been affirmed by scholars. While other women were able to obtain jobs and new opportunities in other parts of the world during this time period, it is important to note that this was not the case for a majority of Jewish and even Gypsy women in Europe.

Millions of Jewish women in the Holocaust were killed, and the Nazis also killed other women who belonged to groups they were committing genocide against, such as women with disabilities and Roma women.

=== Asia ===
Women, called comfort women, were forced into sexual slavery by the Imperial Japanese Army before and during World War II. In other words, the comfort women were a part of a systematic rape used by Japan, especially among the armed forces in the Second World War. Korean women were especially used. The Japanese Imperial Army based these women within “Comfort Stations” near the battlefields in order to have sex with them. Aging from eleven to twenty years old, the comfort women were kidnapped from their homes in order to serve the Japanese army. In March 1932, it became known by a high ranking man in the Japanese military named Okamura Yasuji, that there were numerous rapes committed by Japanese military personnel in Shanghai. Okamura Yasuji ordered Okabe Naosaburo, a senior member of the Japanese military, to create comfort stations with the idea that it would help prevent Japanese soldiers from raping civilians. The other justification for comfort stations was to prevent people in the Japanese army from contracting sexually transmitted diseases. In recent years, political elites in Japanese society have denied the systematic rape of the comfort women during the World War II period, including former Japanese Prime Minister Abe. Despite recent controversy over this topic in Japanese politics and education, numerous researchers have proven that Japanese Comfort Women were subjected to sexual slavery and should be recognized for their unjust treatment.

=== Australia ===

Australian women during World War II played a larger role than they had during The First World War, when they primarily served as nurses and additional homefront workers. Many women wanted to play an active role in the war, and hundreds of voluntary women&#x27;s auxiliary and paramilitary organisations had been formed by 1940. A shortage of male recruits forced the military to establish female branches in 1941 and 1942. Women entered roles which had traditionally been limited to men, but continued to receive lower wages.

===Canada===

Canadian women in the world wars became indispensable because these were total wars that required the maximum effort from the civilian population. Canadian women participated in many ways to contribute to the war efforts. Many Canadian women did volunteer work to help raise money to help those affected by the war. The money raised by Canadian women was used to help refugees that came over with little to nothing. Canadian women also went out of their way to buy things with money they raised like a scarf or a tooth brush that they could send to troops to help them while they were overseas. It was because of the hard volunteer work that many Canadian women had chosen to take on that would lead to the federal government creating the Department of National War Services in June 1940 and then eventually a women&#x27;s division was added a year later in the fall of 1941 to help with the workload of about fifty organizations. It is important to note that many women who came from high schools gave up their summer vacations to work the agricultural fields due to a rising shortage of male labor workers. There were also many Canadian Jewish women that had served in World War II. In fact, there were about 50,000 Canadian Jewish women that served in the Canadian military during World War II. Many Canadian Jewish women who enlisted into the military had served in all branches of the military. Some were even stationed overseas. Most Canadian Jewish women who enlisted served at least 2 and a half years in the military. The Canadian Jewish women who served in the military typically had non-combative positions in the military. Some Canadian Jewish women did office work in the military and others did medical work for the military to help the wounded. Historians debate whether there was much long-term impact on the postwar roles of women.

<doc id="916257" wikidata="Q2118368" url="?curid=916257" title="Regional policy">
<text>Regional policy is the sum of a series of policies formulated according to regional differences to coordinate regional relations and regional macro operation mechanism, which affects regional development at the macro level. It includes regional economic policy, regional social policy, regional environmental policy, regional political policy, regional cultural policy, etc.Regional policy aims to improve economic conditions in regions of relative disadvantage, either within a nation or within a supranational grouping such as the European Union. Additionally, a regional policy may try to address high levels of unemployment and lower-than-average per capita incomes. Its main tool is public investment.

==Regional policy in the European Union==

Although the European Union is one of the richest parts of the world, there are large internal disparities of income and opportunity between its regions. The May 2004 Enlargement, followed by accession of Bulgaria and Romania in January 2007, has widened these gaps. Regional policy transfers resources from richer to poorer regions.

“Regional policy targets all regions and cities in the European Union in to support job creation, business competitiveness, economic growth, sustainable development, and improve citizens’ quality of life.”

The argument for regional policy is that it is both an instrument of financial solidarity and a powerful force for economic integration.

===Regional policy in Italy===
The major Italian experience of regional policy is the Cassa per il Mezzogiorno, set up in the mid-1950s to foster economic development in southern Italy. Originally intended to last for six months, it survived until 1984.

New roads, irrigation projects and developments in infrastructure were built in an area where local communities had suffered seriously from poverty, de-population and high levels of emigration. Tourism projects attempted to exploit Calabria’s beaches.

===Regional policy in the United Kingdom===
UK regional policy was born during the economic depression of the 1930s, when heavy industries in the north were devastated. &quot;Assisted Areas&quot; were established, within which companies could acquire grants or capital allowances – known as Regional Selective Assistance (RSA) – in return for protecting jobs.

The overall pattern of policy changed little in the next forty years. Despite criticism by a 1970s Royal Commission that it was &quot;Empiricism run mad; a game of hit and miss played with more enthusiasm than success&quot;, governments of both parties maintained Assisted Areas. Under the 1980s Thatcher government, regional policy was significantly rolled back, with Assisted Areas substantially reduced in size.

The post-1997 Labour administration reorganised regional policy, with RSA replaced by Selective Finance for Investment in England and Scotland. UK policy has been subject to EU regional policy framework, with its strong injunctions against unfair competition (generally meaning state aid).

==Regional policy in China==

In China, regional policy is delivered through multi-level governance that involves central government, provinces, counties, townships and villages. The key role in regional policy and regional development plays The Department of Regional Economy under the Chinese National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC). The development of regional policy in China can be divided into three stages.

Balanced development in the early 30 years of New China (1949-1978)

The balanced development policy implemented in the early 30 years of the founding of the People&#x27;s Republic of China is a process of the top-down one-way directive plan. The central government uses the national financial resources to implement major projects (infrastructure, national defense), carry out investment and construction, and adjust and control the layout of productivity. From the spatial level, it carries out strategic planning, guidance and control characterized by the unity of regional development. It established a number of industrial bases with initial scale, and laid the foundation for China&#x27;s industrialization construction. 

During China&#x27;s Third Front construction, concerns of invasion by the Soviet Union or the United States prompted the development of infrastructure, industry, and specialized talent remote regions, ultimately laying a foundation for continued economic development in China&#x27;s western regions even after the end of the initiative.It was distributed in the scattered mountainous areas, with the priority given to heavy industry, especially military industry. The development of light industry was insufficient, and there was a shortage of materials. In addition, the tendency of &quot;attaching importance to the mainland but less to the coast&quot; in the application of the balanced development policy has restrained the economic development.

After a Party Work Conference in May 1973 resolved to re-direct state investment efforts from the Third Front to the northeast and the coastal regions, the Third Front was no longer the country&#x27;s most critical economic objective.

Unbalanced development in reform and opening up (1979-1998)

At the end of 1978, China began the historical process of reform and opening up, and profoundly summed up the lessons of the &quot;Cultural Revolution&quot; and the disadvantages of planned economy. During this period, unbalanced development was highly praised, which basically dominated the economic layout and regional development of China. In order to make some areas rich first, it encourages coastal cities and regions with low cost, quick effect, easy project landing and convenient foreign trade to develop first, and open up the riverside, belt and inland areas in stages, with emphasis and efficiency. Specific measures include establishment of special economic zones, economic and technological development zones and coastal port cities, etc.

Coordinated development since the new millennium (1999-)

At this stage, China implements the regional policy of &quot;four plates&quot; and &quot;three support belts&quot; as a whole, and promotes coordinated and complementary development among regions and narrow the regional economic gap under the guidance of major strategies. Specific measures include The Belt and Road Initiative, the development of the &quot;Beijing Tianjin Hebei&quot;, the Yangtze River economic belt, the development of the Yangtze River economic belt, the construction of the Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macao.

After more than 20 years of reform and opening up, the unbalanced development strategy is oriented by &quot;efficiency&quot; and adopts the policy of inclining to the East, which promotes the rapid development of economic core areas such as the Pearl River Delta, the Yangtze River Delta and the Bohai rim, and economic growth poles such as Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen and Guangzhou.

During the 2000s, China&#x27;s coastal areas continued to outpace its interior in economic development. The thinking of China&#x27;s regional economic development has turned to the coordinated and balanced way of &quot;maintaining the priority development momentum of the eastern region and accelerating the development of the central and western regions&quot;.

As regional disparities widened however, coastal areas became a major source of investment for inland areas.Manufacturing that was lower on the value chain trended towards moving inland. This trend was termed &quot;industrial transfer.&quot; Developing Chinese policymakers reacted by further encouraging industrial transfer.

In the early 2000s, the government began to finance construction of cross-regional transportation to improve accessibility to, and develop of, China&#x27;s interior regions. In March 2004, Premier Wen Jiabao announced The Rise of the Central Regions during his delivery of the Annual Report of the State Council. This initiative was added to the Politburo&#x27;s agenda in 2006.

Western development and Northeast Revitalization are other main regional policy directions.

Specific Regional Policy

Special economic zone

In 1979, Deng Xiaoping first proposed the establishment of &quot;export special zone&quot;. In 1990, the State Council approved the establishment of Shanghai Waigaoqiao Free Trade Zone, the first free trade zone in New China. In 2001, China joined the WTO to participate in international competition and cooperation. Since 2003, the State Council has issued a series of documents to build an energy-saving society. The development mode of low-carbon economy has become China&#x27;s transformation of economic development mode and adjustment China (Shanghai) pilot Free Trade Zone, the first free trade zone in China, was officially established in 2013. The policy includes related keywords as bonded zone, western development, free trade zone, scientific and technological innovation, WTO entry, low-carbon economy, regional preferential policies, foreign direct investment.

Main functional areas

China&#x27;s regional economy has formed an overall strategy of &quot;four major plates&quot; for the development of the west, the revitalization of the northeast, the rise of the central region and the first development of the East. The main functional areas are the implementation of the overall strategy of regional development. The land and space are divided into four categories: optimized development, key development, restricted development and prohibited development. The policy includes keywords such as coordinated development, cultivated land protection, the rise of Central China, industrial agglomeration, tax preference, public services, economic compensation, ecological compensation, revitalization of Northeast China, and circular economy.

One belt and one road

<text>Keratin 1 is a Type II intermediate filament (IFs) of the intracytoplasmatic cytoskeleton. Is co-expressed with and binds to Keratin 10, a Type I keratin, to form a coiled coil heterotypic keratin chain. Keratin 1 and Keratin 10 are specifically expressed in the spinous and granular layers of the epidermis. In contrast, basal layer keratinocytes express little to no Keratin 1. Mutations in &quot;KRT1&quot;, the gene encoding Keratin 1, have been associated with variants of the disease bullous congenital ichthyosiform erythroderma in which the palms and soles of the feet are affected. Mutations in &quot;KRT10&quot; have also been associated with bullous congenital ichthyosiform erythroderma; however, in patients with KRT10 mutations the palms and soles are spared. This difference is likely due to Keratin 9, rather than Keratin 10, being the major binding partner of Keratin 1 in acral (palm and sole) keratinocytes.

Type II cytokeratins are clustered in a region of chromosome 12q12-q13.

== Interactions ==

Keratin 1 has been shown to interact with desmoplakin and PRKCE.

<doc id="916272" wikidata="Q231334" url="?curid=916272" title="Barbara of Cilli">
<text>Barbara of Cilli or Barbara of Celje (Hungarian: &quot;Cillei Borbála&quot;, German: &quot;Barbara von Cilli,&quot; Slovenian and Croatian&quot;: Barbara Celjska,&quot; 1392 – 11 July 1451), was the Holy Roman Empress and Queen of Hungary and Bohemia by marriage to Holy Roman Emperor Sigismund. She was actively involved in politics and economy of her times, independently administering large feudal fiefdoms and taxes, and was instrumental in creating the famous royal Order of the Dragon. She served as the regent of Hungarian kingdom in the absence of her husband four times: in 1412, 1414, 1416, and 1418.

== Biography ==
Barbara was born in Celje, in the Duchy of Styria (today Slovenia), as the daughter and youngest child of Herman II, Count of Celje, and his wife, Countess Anna of Schaunberg.

Barbara was engaged in 1405 to Sigismund of Bohemia, King of Hungary, the youngest son of Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor. The marriage likely took place in December 1405.

===Queen and empress===
Sigismund succeeded to the rule in Germany (1410), Bohemia (1419) and was crowned Holy Roman Emperor himself in 1433, giving her the equivalent titles.

She spent most of her time on her Hungarian fiefdoms, while her spouse devoted his time elsewhere. She served as the regent of Hungary during his absences in 1412, 1414, 1416 and 1418. In 1429, she participated at the congress of Łuck. She was crowned Queen of Hungary in 1408, Queen of Germany in 1414 (being the last consort to be crowned in Aachen), Holy Roman Empress in 1433 and Queen of Bohemia in 1437, shortly before her husband&#x27;s death. In 1409, Barbara gave birth to a daughter, Elizabeth, Sigismund&#x27;s only surviving issue and heiress, who married King Albert II of Germany.

Barbara was richer than any precedent queen. In 1409, the former estates of the Ban of Slavonia was bestowed upon Barbara. She had a difficult phase though, when in 1419, rumours reached Sigismund that she had an affair with a German knight during his stay at Konstanz. The king took away the queen&#x27;s possessions, dissolved her entourage and exiled her to Oradea. During the Christmas of 1419, Bishop George of Passau and Hofmeister Louis of Oettingen tried to arrange a reconciliation. Barbara fell on her knees begging for the king&#x27;s forgiveness but Sigismund refused to listen, until the 10-year-old Elizabeth intervened on behalf of her mother. She was allowed to hold her own court again in 1423 only. In 1424, her husband lavishly compensated her for her lost estates. Barbara was given, among others, the counties of Zvolen and Trenčín, as well as the revenues of Kremnica. The northern estates mortgaged to her included: Diósgyőr in 1427, Liptov in 1430, part of the Stibor inheritance in 1434. Her household became slightly more modest than her previous one. A notable feature was that the highest offices were now occupied by simple knights, instead of illustrious barons, like what had happened in the time of the Angevin rulers and Mary.

She was an energetic regent who also functioned as the head military commander in the case the country was attacked. In 1431, Hungary was beleaguered by Hussite forces twice. During the second one, they even infringed on Barbara&#x27;s fiefs, notably Liptov. In October, at her castle in Old Buda, she learned of the situation in Liptov and possibly also the occupation of the Likava Castle by the Hussites. She immediately instructed Kremnica to follow the lead of Hanns Wallenroth and sent a large force to relieve Liptov. In October, she moved to Vígľaš, where she organized the defence against the Hussites led by Messenpek and planned the reconquest of Likava Castle. On 13 October 1431, Barbara sent a letter to the city of Košice, in which she informed them about loss of Likava and gave the order that their military divisions should be incorporated to her army as soon as possible. After this under the command of her military commander and main chronicler Stefan Poharnok (&quot;Stefan the Cupbearer&quot;), the army undertook the reconquering of Likava Castle. According to Dvořáková, &quot;the lack of sources do not permit us to determine when Barbara got Likava back, and whether a Hussite garrison operated for several years at Likava, as some historians assume.&quot;, but &quot;It is possible that Barbara&#x27;s energetic interventions allowed her to send a strong force to the Liptov region in a short time, causing the Hussites to leave
the Liptov and return to the Turiec region and then head down the Nitra valley to the city of Nitra.&quot; On 24 October, again she wrote to Košice, procuring from them crossbows and arrows (that would be paid by one-thirtieth tax from her collectors) as well as asking them for gunpowder or at least sulphur in the case they did not have it.

Barbara took an ambivalent position towards the Hussites. At first she attacked them vigorously in a manifesto published in July 1427 and in another published in October 1431. But in her later days, she worked behind the scenes to support the Hussite champion George Podiebrad.

There are about 250 extant charters issued in her name between 1406 and 1438 and now kept at The Hungarian National Archives preserved.

Mark Whelan notes that as the Roman queen, Barbara, through correspondence with Vienna or the Teutonic Order, was able to secure construction expertise (that she needed for her fortresses) from her German subjects, who provided a &quot;far richer base of skills&quot; than what she could find in the Hungarian kingdom. This seemed to be the result of what she saw in a travel to Vienna (she likely accompanied Sigismund to a Reichstag held in Vienna). She also accompanied Sigismund to the imperial diets held in Breslau (1420), Nuremberg (1422) and to Pressburg (1429). She took on her role as the first lady of Europe in the Council of Constance (1414), performing ceremonial duties. She is remembered by many contemporaries as the emperor&#x27;s young, vital and beautiful consort. Her liberal behaviours, encouraged by her husband, provoked protests from moralists though. Jean de Montreuil, secretary of the French King (who hated Sigismund), wrote that, &quot;Nowhere in the world is a more indulgent husband (than Sigismund), who not only lets his wife do anything she wants, but ultimately even encourages her to take part in public dances, speak with everyone and relate to people in such a friendly way that it is said that those who do not know her (personally) would not consider her as a queen but as a
woman of some low trade.&quot; He was especially shocked that &quot;merchant&#x27;s wives, various bawds, and people without important positions&quot; came to see the queen and left her apartment freely, in a way impossible in the French court.

====Founding of the Order of the Dragon====
On 12 December 1408, the ruling couple together with twenty-two of the leading barons founded the Order of the Dragon. Barbara was the co-publisher of the founding charter, in which she appeared as an equal partner to Sigismund and other founders. The proclaimed purpose of the Order was to support the ruling couple, elevate the dignity of the Hungarian king as well as to combat pagans. According to Dvořáková, &quot;members of the order were bound to defend the queen and her children of both sexes in their domain and properties, even in the event of the king&#x27;s death. Several of Barbara&#x27;s relatives were among the founding members of the order: aside from her father Hermann, also her brother Frederick of Cilli, her brother-in-law Nicholas of Gara with his son John, who had an interest in keeping power in the hands of Barbara and her potential offspring even after the death of Sigismund.&quot;

===Conflict with Albert II===
Days before the death of her gravely ill husband on 9 December 1437 at Znojmo, as a pretext to confiscate her large fiefdoms in the Hungarian kingdom (where she rivaled the king himself in number of fiefdoms and castles), she was quickly accused by her son-in-law Albert II of Germany of the Habsburg dynasty and his chancellor Kaspar Schlick of plotting against Sigismund, for which she was swiftly transported to prison in Bratislava castle and later forced to relinquish most of her possessions, including her dower. Conflict with the new king was inevitable, and Barbara soon decided to find shelter in the Polish royal court, where she was in exile from 1438 to 1441. The King of Poland decided to give her financial support by granting her Sandomierz as a fief, according to the chronicle of Jan Długosz.

===Later life===
In 1441, two years after the death of her arch-rival King Albert II of Germany, she moved to Mělník in Bohemia – a fiefdom given to her by her deceased husband. All her Hungarian fiefdoms were already lost; some of them belonged to her daughter, Queen Elisabeth. Later she reconciled with her daughter and renounced her rights to Hungarian possessions (1441). She spent the rest of her life as dowager queen in Bohemia. She seems to have retreated from political life, although the Habsburg court saw her as dangerous and tried to accuse her of heresy, alchemy, and immoral and agnostic behavior, for which she received the sobriquet &quot;Messalina of Germany&quot;.
She died of the plague epidemic in Mělník and was buried in St. Andrew&#x27;s chapel of St. Vitus Cathedral in Prague.

==Cultural depictions==

Recently, scholarly interest in Barbara&#x27;s life and career has been increasing. Modern portrayals tend to show the late medieval ruler in a much more positive light than medieval writings. Historians pay more attention to her independent character, her notable political achievements, her shrewd administrative of her property, her versatile nature (she spoke several languages and was a practicing alchemist).

===Historiography===
====Barbara&#x27;s personality====
Late medieval and early modern scholars often presented the empress in a bad light, highlighting her sexual deviancy. Daniela Dvořáková opines that the major creator of this negative image was Aeneas Silvius Piccolomini, later Pope Pius II, who hated the Cillis and also worked for Holy Roman Emperor Frederick III, who also harboured enmity towards the Cillis (in 1436, Sigismund raised the Cillis, who had been vassals to the Habsburgs, to princes, without the consent of Frederick, who was at that time Duke Frederick V of Austria). Later, the historian Johannes Cuspinian (1473–1529) further developed the sensual, negative image created by Piccolomini. Cuspinian was the first author who compared Barbara with the Roman empress Messalina. Later, Johann Jakob Fugger (1516–1575) associated Barbara with the enduring label &quot;the German Messalina&quot; (&quot;Teutsche Messalina&quot;) 

Barbara returned as the focus of biographical research through two early Leipzig dissertation in 1755 and 1759. In 1908, Hans von Chilian, again in Leipzig, published the dissertation &quot;Barbara von Cilli&quot;, in which the queen-empress was recognized as a brilliantly gifted individual. Recently, together with the extraordinary development of research on Sigismund, more attention has also been paid to Barbara.

Recent research, such as those of Rolanda Fugger Germadnik (&quot;the leading Slovene expert on Barbara of Cilli&quot;) or Daniela Dvořáková, aims at clearing the queen&#x27;s name of the old disreputable accusations. She is now presented as an early emancipated, energetic, self-confident woman of profound education, who has been demonized unfairly.

====Barbara as a politician====
Dvořáková opines that Barbara &quot;ranks among the most fascinating female historical figures of the first half of the 15th century&quot;, although until now she has been in the shadow of her more celebrated husband. According to the researcher, &quot;The cohabitation of Sigismund and Barbara was built not only on affection or even love, but also on their mutually beneficial cooperation. Thanks to her wealth, multiplied by good management, a well-thought-through financial policy, as well as the choice of capable people, the queen always had money available, which her husband always needed. Due to his absolute occupation in politics, he did not have the capacity to devote himself to the administration of his own properties.&quot; By the end of her husband&#x27;s reign, she held 30 castles, equal to the number held by the king, while the Cilli counts held 17. Dvořáková opines that Barbara&#x27;s imprisonment after or shortly before the death of Sigismund was either without her husband&#x27;s knowledge or manipulation of the dying Sigismund, likely on behalf of her son-in-law, King Albert of Austria. Dvořáková points out that it was the inevitable fate of self-confident queens, without the protection of their husbands, to end up badly in that era – which can be seen in the cases of Elizabeth of Bosnia, widow of Louis I the Great; Barbara&#x27;s daughter Elizabeth of Luxembourg or Beatrice of Naples, widow of Matthias Corvinus.
Machilek praises Dvořáková&#x27;s work for successfully portraying Barbara as a gifted, self-confident ruler who displayed a non-conformist attitude in her widowhood.

Sandra B. Weiss notes that Barbara relied especially upon her mountain (mining) estates (in 1427, Sigismund gave up on his rights on the mining tax for gold, silver, iron, and lead – except copper – in all mining towns, in exchange for the thirtieth tariff) to build her authority and even oppose Sigismund&#x27;s will, which led to her eventual imprisonment.

According Philip J. Potter, Barbara was instrumental in the founding of the Order of the Dragon. She used her dynasty&#x27;s prestige to promote the Order&#x27;s standing.

Ansgar Frenken remarks that the queen is now &quot;expressly honored as an independent political subject and her political role as Hungarian regent as well as administrator of her own properties is emphasized.&quot;

Kondor notes that Barbara&#x27;s organizational skills are now widely recognized by scholars. Jörg K. Hoensch though does point out that during the period of 1416–1419, when Barbara was forced to govern alone without the other two members (Garai and Kanizsai) of the regency council (&quot;Regentschaftsrat&quot;) that Sigismund appointed when he left Hungary, she was unable to cope with the situation. Chilian also notes the various problems with the defense against the Ottomans, other border incidents and armed robberies Hungary had in this period. Fößel argues though that these incidents were either not indicators of success in ruling the country or not acute problems during that period. Martin Uhrmacher praises Amalie Fößel&#x27;s article &quot;Barbara von Cilli. Gemahlin Sigismunds und ungarische Königin&quot; for an updated portrait, in which the author defends the queen from clichés but does not leave the ruling couple&#x27;s action uncriticized.

On the turbulent events happened before and after Sigismund&#x27;s death, Roitner opines that it is hard to determine who was the person that ordered Barbara&#x27;s arrest as well as her specific ambitions during that period.

====Barbara and the occult====
Barbara is recognized as a practicing alchemist and astrologer. Her involvement in the occult has also contributed to her reputation as a godless, dangerous woman. &#x27;s 1904 &quot;Geschichte der Pharmazie&quot; (&quot;History of pharmacy&quot;) describes the queen-empress as a fraudulent alchemist. According to Stanislav Južnič, Barbara – the richest female alchemist of all times – used very expensive but easily breakable tools for her experiments, thus today there is not much hope of obtaining a preserved specimen.

===Legends and anecdotes===
In Croatian folklore, Barbara is often identified with the figure of the Black Queen. The black queen is described as a lady with long black hair, who dressed herself in black. There are dark legends about Black Queen-Barbara that are still widely known today, including:
*The queen had many lovers. When she did not like them anymore, she had them thrown over the wall of her castle.
*She was a bird-whisperer who kept a pet black raven that would attack people on her command.
*She asked the Devil to protect Medvedgrad against invading Turks, offering her own life to him. Later she tried to trick the devil but failed. A version recounts that she offered 12 buckets of gold to anyone who could bring her around the fortress of Medvedgrad twelve times. But nobody managed to do this due to all the hidden traps around the fortress. She was turned into a snake. But once every hundred years, on a certain day, it is possible for a man who, if he encounters her in the form of a snake, to remove the curse by a kiss.

Barbara supposedly had many lovers. Dvořáková says that these adultery stories are based on very shaky ground. For example, the German knight Johannes de Wallenroth (whose involvement with Barbara is written down by the Bavarian historian Enoch Widmann, who lived two centuries after Barbara) actually served in her court and possibly later boasted about the queen&#x27;s favour when he retired to Germany, but it is hard to imagine that Sigismund would tolerate him to the degree that he could continue to work for her many years after the alleged uncovering of infidelity.

She has even been portrayed as a lesbian vampire – a beautiful (one of the traits older chroniclers and historians agreed about her) but nefarious creature. She allegedly kept a female harem during her exile in Melnyk and had orgies with young girls. The vampiristic stories originated at least partly from Piccolomini&#x27;s account, which claims that, after the death of Albrecht, Barbara (who did not believe in the afterlife according to Piccolomini) and Elizabeth used to desecrate the Holy Communion by drinking real human blood. This would, even by modern medical standards, qualify Barbara as a &quot;living vampire&quot; (a person who drinks human blood). McNally comments that, &quot;So, how can one evaluate the role of Barbara von Cilli? During a time when royalty in both western and eastern Europe could barely sign their names, Barbara knew German, Hungarian, Czech, Latin, and even a little Polish. She lived a comparatively free life in the manner of the Italian Renaissance with emphasis upon individual freedom. In fact, Barbara appears to have been an early example of an emancipated woman, who probably frightened her male contemporaries and led to her nefarious reputation as a lesbian vampire.&quot;

===Depictions in arts===
====Contemporary arts====


*She was present in the &quot;Reminiscences&quot; of Helene Kottanner, a lady-in-waiting to Barbara&#x27;s daughter Queen Elizabeth and one of the first known female memoirist.

====Later depictions====
=====Visual art=====
*Slovenian artist Rudolf Španzel created a depiction of hers.
*In 2020, Renáta Fučíková pays tribute to Barbara with an illustration in a series about Czech heroines.

=====Prose=====
*In 1941, Ján Greža wrote the novel &quot;Barbora Cellská &quot; about Barbara. 
*She is a character in &quot;Das Lächeln der Imperia&quot; by Antje Windgassen. The main character is Gabriella Cognati, a courtesan who calls herself Imperia and is the mistress of Sigismund. The relationship between Barbara and Gabriella is friendly. The story is tied to the 1414 Council of Constance.
*Mircalla, Countess Karnstein (the female vampire Carmilla), the title character of Carmilla, a 1872 Gothic novella by Sheridan Le Fanu, is likely based on the legendary image of Barbara as a vampire.
*Barbara is featured as the main character in the wraparound narrative of the story collection &quot;Waggish Tales of the Czechs&quot;. Referred to as &quot;Queen Barbota,&quot; Barbara is portrayed as a somewhat ribald character who, bedridden and bored during her pregnancy, engages her women-in-waiting in telling her moral tales. According to the book&#x27;s foreword, these are &quot;lusty, uproarious, sometimes cruelly brutal yarns, recited with the coarse gusto and abounding virility of a healthy outdoor people&quot;. Queen Barbota takes great delight in them.
*In August 2023, the German horror fiction author Markus Heitz will publish the novel &quot;Die Schwarze Königin&quot;. The story is about a young man named Len (a &quot;Drăculești&quot; and the last descendant of Vlad II Dracul) going to Prague and Banat, assisted by his friend Klara (an ex-history professor) via the internet. He comes into contact with the world of the past, in which Barbara von Cilli and Vlad II fought against vampires living underground in Transylvania and Wallachia.

=====Theater=====
*Václav Renč wrote the 1944 four-act drama &quot;Barbora Celská&quot;.

=====Films=====
* In the 1986 Czechoslovakian television film &quot;Zikmund recený Selma rysavá&quot;, the queen-empress is portrayed by Milena Dvorská.

===Commemoration===
In 2014 (the 600th Anniversary of the Council of Constance and Barbara&#x27;s coronation as Queen of Germany), the Provincial Museum of Celje organized the Year of Barbara of Cilli. Also in 2014, a €2 commemorative coin depicting the queen hold a sceptre was issued on behalf of Slovenia, designed by Matej Ramšak.

On 19 November and 10 December 2022, Konstanz will organize the event &quot;Barbara von Cilli – Kaiserin, Alchemistin, Vampir&quot;.

<doc id="916278" wikidata="Q14864152" url="?curid=916278" title="Keratin 7">
<text>Keratin, type II cytoskeletal 7 also known as cytokeratin-7 (CK-7) or keratin-7 (K7) or sarcolectin (SCL) is a protein that in humans is encoded by the &quot;KRT7&quot; gene. Keratin 7 is a type II keratin. It is specifically expressed in the simple epithelia lining the cavities of the internal organs and in the gland ducts and blood vessels.

== Function ==

Keratin-7 is a member of the keratin gene family. The type II cytokeratins consist of basic or neutral proteins which are arranged in pairs of heterotypic keratin chains coexpressed during differentiation of simple and stratified epithelial tissues. This type II cytokeratin is specifically expressed in the simple epithelia lining the cavities of the internal organs and in the gland ducts and blood vessels. The genes encoding the type II cytokeratins are clustered in a region of chromosome 12q12-q13. Alternative splicing may result in several transcript variants; however, not all variants have been fully described.

Keratin-7 is found in simple glandular epithelia, and in transitional epithelium. Epithelial cells of the lung and breast both contain keratin-7, but some other glandular epithelia, such as those of the colon and prostate, do not. 

==Immunohistochemistry==

Because the keratin-7 antigen is found in both healthy and neoplastic cells, antibodies to CK7 can be used in immunohistochemistry to distinguish ovarian and transitional cell carcinomas (staining positive) from colonic and prostate cancers (negative), respectively. It is commonly used together with CK20 when making such diagnoses.

<doc id="916280" wikidata="Q476608" url="?curid=916280" title="TVN (Polish TV channel)">
<text>TVN (Polish pronunciation: ) (stylized in all lowercase) is a Polish free-to-air television station, network and a media and entertainment group in Poland. It was co-founded by Polish businessmen Mariusz Walter, Jan Wejchert and Swiss entrepreneur Bruno Valsangiacomo. It is owned by TVN Group, which as of April 2022, is a subsidiary of Warner Bros. Discovery. The current CEO is Katarzyna Kieli (who is also president and managing director of Warner Bros. Discovery Poland).

TVN is available by satellite, cable television and digital terrestrial television.

In 2004, with its debut on the Warsaw Stock Exchange, the company became a public limited company. In March 2015, U.S. broadcaster Scripps Networks Interactive bought a 52.7% majority stake in TVN for €584 million. In July 2015, SNI bought out TVN&#x27;s remaining owners, ITI Group and Canal+ Group, for €584 million, giving it full ownership.

On March 6, 2018, SNI was, in turn, acquired by Discovery, Inc. for US$14.6 billion. Liberty Global, which operated pay television provider UPC Polska, is a major shareholder in Discovery. The European Commission thus required TVN to ensure that TVN24 and TVN24 BiS remain available to third-party television providers.

==History==

In March 1997, Grupa TVN obtained permission from The National Council of Radio Broadcasting and Television to broadcast in central and northern parts of Poland. A few months later Grupa TVN acquired , which had a license to broadcast in southern Poland.

The channel was launched nationwide as TVN on 3 October 1997. In its early months, the high costs of buying foreign content led to TVN trying to find a uniquely Polish strategy for its programming, as both TVP and Polsat had occupied a significant part of the import revenue. One year after its launch, the channel was plagued by low ratings, management issues and regulatory problems, such as the conflicts between ITI and CME and the rescinsion of its broadcasting license in northern Poland. During the first four years the network was run by its founder Mariusz Walter. In 2001 Piotr Walter became chief executive officer, replacing his father.

In 2004 TVN was available in 86% of Polish households. Since 2004 TVN has been listed on the Warsaw Stock Exchange. On 29 April 2004 TVN launched TVN International, an entertainment and news channel for Polish viewers living abroad. In 2005 TVN acquired rights to organise and broadcast Sopot International Song Festival until 2010, and has acquired said rights again from 2017. In 2006 TVN launched its high definition version, TVN HD, which was the first HD television channel in Poland.

TVN is a supporter of the Hybrid Broadcast Broadband TV (HbbTV) initiative that is promoting and establishing an open European standard for hybrid set-top boxes for the reception of broadcast TV and broadband multimedia applications with a single user interface, and conducted the first tests of HbbTV services in Poland in March 2012.

On 16 March 2015, TVN announced a sale of a 52.7% controlling stake to the U.S. broadcaster Scripps Networks Interactive (SNI) for €584 million, subject to regulatory approval. In July 2015, SNI bought out the remaining owners for €584 million. SNI was, in turn, acquired by Discovery Communications (now Discovery Inc.) for US$14.6 billion, in a sale completed 6 March 2018.

===Conflict with Law and Justice government (2021)===
TVN tends to be strongly critical of the Law and Justice (PiS) party, since it was sworn to power in 2015. Historian and columnist Timothy Garton Ash, writing for The Guardian, praised &quot;Fakty TVN&quot;&#x27;s critical coverage of government issues when harshly criticising Telewizja Polska&#x27;s &quot;Wiadomości&quot; (&quot;News&quot;).The &quot;Facts&quot; is not BBC-style impartial: it clearly favours a more liberal, pro-European Poland and is strongly anti-PiS. But unlike the so-called &quot;News&quot;, it is still definitely professional, high quality, reality-based journalism.Since 2020 the conflict between TVN and the PiS worsened, to a degree that, by July 2021, a group of PiS lawmakers, submitted to parliament a draft amendment that would prevent companies from outside the European Economic Area taking control of Polish radio and television stations. This would mean that Discovery, the owner of TVN, might be forced to divest its ownership. The Agreement, then PiS&#x27; coalition partner, was opposed to this, they instead proposed a change that would allow companies from countries in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) to own more than 49% of shares in Polish media companies, which would mean no change to the American ownership of the channel.

However, opposition, as well as representatives from European Union and the United States criticized the law, and international observers expressed fear that the law is threatening press freedom in Poland. The law has been criticized for &quot;threatening the largest ever US investment in Poland&quot;. This also led to protests within the country, with a number of demonstrations on 10 August.

On 11 August 2021, the bill was passed via the Sejm on a vote of 228 to 216, with 10 abstentions, as a result, TVN&#x27;s licence could expire on September 26.

On 30 August 2021, the Chairman of the National Council of Radio Broadcasting and Television sent to the TV operators a decision to move the licence of sister channel TVN24 into the Discovery Communications Benelux B.V. license, based in the Netherlands. The decision ensures the continuity of broadcasting the TVN24 program after 26 September 2021, regardless of the results of the ongoing conflict with Law and Justice government. On 24 September 2021 - two days before the expiration of the previous licence - TVN24 was granted a new Polish licence.

On 18 December 2021, the bill was passed via the Sejm. The Sejm voted in favor 229-212 with 11 abstentions to override the Senate&#x27;s veto. Law and Justice (PiS) party and allied opposition group Kukiz&#x27;15 voted for the bill, against was the remaining opposition with the exception of far-right Confederation, which abstained. The bill was vetoed by Polish President Andrzej Duda on 27 December 2021.

<text>Keratin 6A is one of the 27 different type II keratins expressed in humans. Keratin 6A was the first type II keratin sequence determined. Analysis of the sequence of this keratin together with that of the first type I keratin led to the discovery of the four helical domains in the central rod of keratins. In humans Keratin 6A is encoded by the &quot;KRT6A&quot; gene.

== Keratins ==

Keratins are the intermediate filament proteins that form a dense meshwork of filaments throughout the cytoplasm of epithelial cells. Keratins form heteropolymers consisting of a type I and a type II keratin. Keratins are generally expressed in particular pairs of type I and type II keratin proteins in a tissue-specific and cellular differentiation-specific manner.

The keratin proteins of epithelial tissues are commonly known as &quot;keratins&quot; or are sometimes referred to as &quot;epithelial keratins&quot; or &quot;cytokeratins&quot;. The specialized keratins of hair and nail are known as &quot;hard keratins&quot; or &quot;trichocyte keratins&quot;. Trichocytes are the specialized epithelial cells from which hair and nail are composed. Trichocyte keratins are similar in their gene and protein structure to keratins except that they are especially rich in the sulfur-containing amino acid cysteine, which facilitates chemical cross-linking of the assembled hard keratins to form a more structurally resilient material.

Both epithelial keratins and hard keratins can be further subdivided into type I (acidic) keratins and type II (neutral-basic) keratins. The genes for the type I keratins are located in a gene cluster on human chromosome 17q, whereas the genes for type II keratins are located in a cluster on human chromosome 12q (the exception being K18, a type I keratin located in the type II gene cluster).

== Keratin 6A ==

Keratin 6A (protein name K6A; gene name &quot;KRT6A&quot;), is a type II cytokeratin, one of a number of isoforms of keratin 6 encoded by separate genes located within the type II keratin gene cluster on human chromosome 12q. It is found with keratin 16 and/or keratin 17 in the palm and sole epidermis, the epithelial cells of the nail bed, the filiform papillae of the tongue, the epithelial lining of oral mucosa and esophagus, as well as the hair follicles. This keratin 6 isoform is thought to be the most abundant of the K6 isoforms.

The &quot;KRT6A&quot; gene consists of 9 exons separated by 8 introns and is located in the type II keratin gene cluster on human &quot;chromosome&quot; 12q. Keratin 6B and keratin 6C are encoded by the neighbouring genes, which are identical in intron-exon organization to &quot;KRT6A&quot; and are more than 99% identical in their DNA coding sequences.

Keratin 6A has been shown to have antimicrobial properties, and is the main antimicrobial factor in the eye.

== Genetic disorders ==

Mutations in the genes expressing this protein is associated with the PC-K6A subtype of pachyonychia congenita, an inherited disorder of the epithelial tissues in which keratin 6A is expressed, particularly leading to structural abnormalities of the nails, the epidermis of the palms and soles, and oral epithelia.

==Immunohistochemistry==
The expression of keratin 6A is often tested together with keratin 5, using CK5/6 antibodies, which target both keratin forms.

<doc id="916290" wikidata="Q11215470" url="?curid=916290" title="E-boat">
<text>E-boat was the Western Allies&#x27; designation for the fast attack craft (German: Schnellboot, or &quot;S-Boot&quot;, meaning &quot;fast boat&quot;; plural &quot;Schnellboote&quot;) of the Kriegsmarine of Nazi Germany during World War II; &quot;E-boat&quot; could refer to a patrol craft from an armed motorboat to a large &quot;Torpedoboot.&quot; The name of E-boats was a British designation using the letter &quot;E&quot; for &quot;Enemy&quot;.

The main wartime production boats, from &quot;S26&quot; onwards (but often designated the &quot;S100&quot; class), were very seaworthy, heavily armed and capable of sustaining , briefly accelerating to . These were armed with torpedoes and Flak guns; commonly one 37 mm at the stern, one 20 mm at the bow with a twin mount amidships, plus machine guns. Armament varied and some &quot;S26&quot; class boats substituted a 40mm Bofors or, less commonly, a 20mm &quot;flakvierling&quot; (quadruple mount) for the aft 37mm cannon.

The &quot;S26&quot; class boats – which provided the bulk of the wartime deliveries – were long and in beam. Their diesel engines provided a range of , substantially greater than the gasoline-fueled American PT boats and British motor torpedo boats (MTBs).

As a result of early war experience of combat against the fast and powerful S-boats, the Royal Navy created its MGB force and later developed better-matched MTBs, using the Fairmile &#x27;D&#x27; hull design.

== History ==

=== Development ===
This design was chosen because the theatre of operations of such boats was expected to be the North Sea, English Channel and the Western Approaches. The requirement for good performance in rough seas dictated the use of a round-bottomed displacement hull rather than the flat-bottomed planing hull that was more usual for small, high-speed boats. The shipbuilding company Lürssen at Vegesack, Bremen, overcame many of the disadvantages of such a hull and, with the private motor yacht &quot;Oheka II&quot; in 1926, produced a craft that was fast, strong and seaworthy. It was also very light, being constructed of wooden planking over alloy frames. This attracted the interest of the &quot;Reichsmarine&quot;, which in November 1929 ordered a similar boat but fitted with two torpedo tubes. This became the &quot;S1&quot;, and was the basis for all subsequent E-boats.

After experimenting with the &quot;S1&quot;, the Germans made several improvements to the design. Small rudders added on either side of the main rudder could be angled outboard to 30 degrees, creating at high speed what is known as the Lürssen Effect. This drew in an &quot;air pocket slightly behind the three propellers, increasing their efficiency, reducing the stern wave and keeping the boat at a nearly horizontal attitude&quot;. This was an important innovation as the horizontal attitude lifted the stern, allowing even greater speed, and the reduced stern wave made E-boats harder to see, especially at night.

The rounded wood planking hull helped reduce weight, and flattened at the stern area, the aft section area was reduced at high speeds, it allowed more hydrodynamic lift.

====Layout====
The internal layout of the E-boat remained the same for all types. Its length was generally divided by eight transverse bulkheads (made of 4mm steel below the waterline and slightly thinner light metal alloy above) into nine watertight compartments. From bow to stern, these were:
# Containing a trimming tank, the anchor chain storage locker, forward &quot;head&quot; (WC) and crew washroom;
# the accommodation for senior ratings (six bunks, including one in a separate curtained-off compartment for the coxswain);
# comprising the captain&#x27;s cabin on the starboard side, and the radio room on the port side;
# the two forward fuel tanks (capacity 2 x 3,000 litres), one on either side of a centreline walkway, located directly below the bridge;
# the forward engineroom, housing the two wing engines, still with a central walkway between them;
# the second engineroom held the engine driving the central shaft, with a walkway on each side, flanked next to the hull by auxiliary machinery;
# the two largest of the fuel tanks (each of capacity 3,150 litres), again on either side of a central walkway, with a third (smaller) tank of 1,490 litres below the deck;
# the junior ratings&#x27; accommodation, with bunks for fourteen men, plus the galley and the stern &quot;head&quot;; the boat&#x27;s magazine was also in this compartment;
# the two aft fuel tanks (capacity 2 x 2,000 litres) and rudder gear.

Note that the earliest (shorter) boats lacked the first transverse bulkhead, and thus the senior ratings&#x27; accommodation was included in the first watertight compartment.

====Personnel====
The earliest six boats had a crew of 12 men, but by the time of the &quot;S7&quot; and &quot;S14&quot; types (&quot;S7&quot; to &quot;S25&quot;) the manning had increased to 18 men. The &quot;S26&quot; class required a complement of between 21 and 24 men, and this remained generally constant for all subsequent boats (except the ex-Italian and KS and LS boats). This comprised a commanding officer (usually an &quot;Oberleutnant zur See&quot;), a Chief Boatswain (&quot;Oberbootsmann&quot;), a Helmsman (&quot;Matrosen-Gefreiter&quot;), about six seamen including those operating semaphore and engine telegraph posts (&quot;Matrosen&quot;), a Chief Engineer (&quot;Obermaschinist&quot;), three engineer NCOs (&quot;Maschinenmaaten&quot;), six engine-room ratings (usually &quot;Heizer&quot;), two radio operators (&quot;Funkgefreiter&quot; or &quot;Funkgast&quot;) for radio communications including decoding, and a torpedo mechanic (&quot;Torpedomechanikergefreiter&quot;) who doubled as the boat&#x27;s cook.

Crew members could earn an award particular to their work — the &quot;Schnellbootkriegsabzeichen&quot; — denoted by a badge depicting an E-boat passing through a wreath. The criteria were good conduct, distinction in action, and participating in at least twelve enemy actions. It was also awarded for particularly successful missions, displays of leadership or being killed in action. It could be awarded under special circumstances, such as when another decoration was not suitable.

=== Operations with the Kriegsmarine ===
E-boats were primarily used to patrol the Baltic Sea and the English Channel in order to intercept shipping heading for the English ports in the south and east. As such, they were up against Royal Navy and Commonwealth, e.g., Royal Canadian Navy contingents leading up to D-Day, motor gunboats (MGBs), motor torpedo boats (MTBs), motor launches, frigates and destroyers. They were also transferred in small numbers to the Mediterranean, and the Black Sea by river and land transport. Some small E-boats were built as boats for carrying by auxiliary cruisers.

E-boats were organisationally under the command of the &quot;Seekriegsleitung&quot; or SKL (the naval warfare command, responsible for the planning, execution and direction of naval warfare), and were administratively organised into flotillas, each originally comprising 8 boats. Consequently most orders for new construction were placed in batches of eight boats, or of multiple of eight. The first half-flotilla (&quot;1st Schnellbootshalbflotille&quot;) was formed in July 1932, but was reorganised as &quot;1st Schnellbootsflotille&quot; in June 1935. A second flotilla was established in August 1938, and a third in 1940. Eventually there were fourteen operational flotillas, numbered 1st to 11th plus 21st, 22nd and 24th, together with three training flotillas (&quot;Schnellbootsschulflotille&quot;). Each flotilla required the backup of a depot ship; initially this was provided by the converted steamer &quot;Nordsea&quot;, but from 1934 a series of purpose-built tenders were commissioned - the &quot;Tsingtau&quot; in 1934, followed by the &quot;Tanga&quot; (in 1939), &quot;Carl Peters&quot; and &quot;Adolf Lüderitz&quot; in 1940, and finally the &quot;Herman von Wissmamm&quot; and &quot;Gustav Nachtigal&quot;.
E-boats of the 6th &amp; 9th flotillas from Cherbourg attacked Exercise Tiger on 28 April 1944, causing about 749 American Army and Navy casualties.

The E-boats of the 9th flotilla were the first naval units to respond to the invasion fleet of Operation Overlord. They left Cherbourg harbour at 5 a.m. on 6 June 1944. On finding themselves confronted by the entire invasion fleet, they fired their torpedoes at maximum range and returned to Cherbourg.

During World War II, E-boats claimed 101 merchant ships totalling 214,728 tons. Additional claims include 12 destroyers, 11 minesweepers, eight landing ships, six MTBs, one torpedo boat, one minelayer, one submarine, and a number of smaller craft such as fishing boats. They also damaged two cruisers, five destroyers, three landing ships, one repair ship, one naval tug, and numerous other merchant vessels. Sea mines laid by the E-boats sank 37 merchant ships totalling 148,535 tons, a destroyer, two minesweepers, and four landing ships.

E-boat crews were awarded 23 Knight&#x27;s Cross of the Iron Crosses and 112 German Crosses in Gold.

====Operations in the Black Sea====
To boost Axis naval strength in the Black Sea, the OKW ordered to the region the transfer of six E-boats of the 1st S-flotilla, the last to be released from action in the Baltic Sea before refit. The Romanian port of Constanța, in the Black Sea, was chosen as the S-flotilla&#x27;s headquarters. Transporting the six boats overland from Germany to Romania was an impressive logistical feat. The superstructure and all weapons were removed, leaving only the hull. After a long road journey of 60 hours, the boats arrived at Ingolstadt, where they were transferred back to water and towed towards Linz. Upon reaching the Austrian city, the superstructure was rebuilt, then the journey continued down the Danube to Galați, where the main engines were installed. The E-boats then continued on their own power towards Constanța, where refitting was completed.

The first two boats, &quot;S26&quot; and &quot;S28&quot;, arrived in Constanța on 24 May 1942, the second pair, &quot;S72 and S102&quot; on 3 June, and the final pair, &quot;S27&quot; and &quot;S40&quot; 10 days later. After the sinking of &quot;S27&quot; by a malfunctioning torpedo, four more reserve boats, &quot;S47&quot;, &quot;S49&quot;, &quot;S51&quot; and &quot;S-52&quot; were dispatched to the Black Sea, in order to replace boats undergoing maintenance. &quot;S28&quot;, &quot;S72&quot; and &quot;S102&quot; were soon relegated to the Constanța Shipyard for engine replacement, leaving only &quot;S26&quot; and the newly commissioned &quot;S49&quot; operational. On 1 January 1944, the 1st S-flotilla numbered six operational boats: &quot;S26&quot;, &quot;S42&quot;, &quot;S47&quot;, &quot;S49&quot;, &quot;S52&quot; and &quot;S79&quot;, while &quot;S28&quot;, &quot;S40&quot;, &quot;S45&quot; and &quot;S51&quot; were all out of commission, undergoing repair in Constanța. Three more boats were shipped down the Danube and were being reconstructed at Constanța. On 1 June 1944, 8 boats were operational in Constanța: &quot;S28&quot;, &quot;S40&quot;, &quot;S47&quot;, &quot;S49&quot;, &quot;S72&quot;, &quot;S131&quot;, &quot;S148&quot; and &quot;S149&quot;. The boats were however penned in harbor, due to fuel shortage. During July, &quot;S26&quot;, &quot;S28&quot;, &quot;S40&quot; and &quot;S42&quot; were transferred to Sulina at the mouth of the Danube, where &quot;S42&quot; was fitted with a new propeller. They were joined by &quot;S72&quot; in early August, the rest of the boats remaining in Constanța. On 19 August, &quot;S26&quot;, &quot;S40&quot; and &quot;S72&quot; were destroyed in port by a Soviet air attack. On 22 August &quot;S148&quot; hit a mine and sank near Sulina, and on the following day, &quot;S42&quot;, &quot;S52&quot; and &quot;S131&quot; were destroyed in Constanța by a Soviet air attack. What remained of the S-flotilla was disbanded after Romania switched sides on the same day.

===Yugoslav Navy===
Eight E-boats were built by Lürssen, Vegesack for the Yugoslav Navy from 1936 to 1939. These were named &quot;Orjen&quot;, &quot;Durmitor&quot;, &quot;Suvobor&quot;, &quot;Kajmakcalan&quot;, &quot;Velebit&quot;, &quot;Dinaira&quot;, &quot;Rudnik&quot; and &quot;Triglav&quot;. Each measured 28.00 (overall)/27.70 (waterline) x 4.46 x 1.51 m (91 ft 10in/90 ft 10in x 14 ft 4in x 4 ft 11in) and 51 tonnes standard (61.7 tonnes full load). Three Daimler-Benz BF2 petrol engines of 1,100 hp each = 3,300 hp = 33 kts, while they carried 5.8 tonnes of petrrol to give them a radius of 265 nmiles @ 33 knots. Each carried two 550mm torpedo tubes, a 40mm gun and 16 men. &quot;Kajmakcalan&quot; and &quot;Durmitor&quot; escaped to Alexandria in April 1941 to join the Allies; the other six fell into Italian hands and became &quot;Ms41&quot; to &quot;Ms46&quot;, four of them eventually captured by the Germans and refitted with standard 533 mm torpedoes (see below under &quot;&quot;S2 &quot; class&quot;).

===Italian MS boat===

The poor seaworthiness of the Italian-designed MAS boats of World War I and early World War II led its navy to build its own version of E-boats, the CRDA 60 t type, classed MS (&quot;Motosilurante&quot;). The prototype was designed on the pattern of the six German-built E-boats captured from the Yugoslav Navy in 1941. Two of them sank the British light cruiser in August 1942, the largest warship to be sunk by fast torpedo craft in the Second World War.
After the war these boats served with the Italian Navy, some well into the 1970s.

=== Service in the Spanish Navy ===
The &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; supplied the Spanish Francoist Navy with six E-boats (&quot;S1&quot; to &quot;S6&quot;) in December 1936 during the Spanish Civil War, and sold six more (&quot;S73&quot;, &quot;S78&quot;, &quot;S124&quot;, &quot;S125&quot;, &quot;S126&quot; and &quot;S134&quot;) to them in 1943 during the Second World War. Another six were built in Spain with some assistance from Lürssen. A motor boat of the early series, either the &quot;Falange&quot; or the &quot;Requeté&quot;, laid two mines off Almería that crippled the British destroyer HMS &quot;Hunter&quot; on 13 May 1937. The German-built boats were discarded in the 1960s, while some of the Spanish-built ones served until the early 1970s.

=== Service in China ===
The Chinese Nationalist Navy had three &quot;S7&quot;-class boats during the Second Sino-Japanese War.

&quot;Yue-22&quot; was destroyed by Japanese planes, &quot;Yue-371&quot; was sunk by its sailors to avoid being captured by the Japanese soldiers and &quot;Yue-253&quot; was captured by the People&#x27;s Liberation Army during the Chinese Civil War. &quot;Yue-253&quot; was renamed &quot;Hoiking&quot; (海鯨), meaning &quot;Seawhale&quot; in Chinese. The People&#x27;s Liberation Army Navy used it as a patrol boat until 1963.

The Chinese Nationalist government also ordered eight E-boats and a tender, &quot;Qi Jiguang&quot; (戚繼光). These were all taken over while under construction by the &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; in 1939. The E-boats had MB502 diesels and were shorter (by 2.18m) than the standard &quot;S26&quot; design of boats. They were re-numbered as &quot;S30&quot; to &quot;S37&quot;, while the &quot;Qi Jiguang&quot; was renamed &quot;Tanga&quot;.

===Service in the Romanian Navy===
Germany sold four E-boats to Romania on 14 August 1944. These vessels displaced 65 tons, had a top speed of 30 knots generated by three Mercedes-Benz engines totalling and were armed with two 500 mm (19.685 in) torpedo tubes. Each of the four boats had a crew of 25. They were numbered 10 to 13 (formerly &quot;S151&quot;, &quot;S152&quot;, &quot;S153&quot; and &quot;S154&quot;) and served in the Romanian Navy until at least 1954.

=== Post-war service ===

==== Royal Navy ====
At the end of the war about 34 E-boats were surrendered to the British. Three boats, &quot;S130&quot; (renamed &quot;P5230&quot;), &quot;S208&quot; (&quot;P5208&quot;) and &quot;S212&quot; (&quot;P5212&quot;) were retained for trials.

===== Operation Jungle =====

The Gehlen Organization, an intelligence agency established by American occupation authorities in Germany in 1946 and manned by former members of the Wehrmacht&#x27;s &quot;Fremde Heere Ost&quot; (Foreign Armies East), used the Royal Navy&#x27;s E-boats in order to infiltrate its agents into the Baltic states and Poland. Royal Navy Commander Anthony Courtney was struck by the potential capabilities of former E-boat hulls, and John Harvey-Jones of the Naval Intelligence Division was put in charge of the project. He discovered that the Royal Navy still had two E-boats, &quot;P5230&quot; and &quot;P5208&quot;, and had them sent to Portsmouth, where one of them, &quot;P5230&quot; (ex-&quot;S130&quot;), was modified to reduce its weight and increase its power with the installation of two Napier Deltic engines of each.

Lieutenant-Commander was assigned to command a German crew, recruited by the British MI6 and funded by the American Office of Policy Coordination. The missions were assigned the codename &quot;Operation Jungle&quot;. The boats carried out their missions under the cover of the British Control Commission&#x27;s Fishery Protection Service, which was responsible for preventing Soviet navy vessels from interfering with German fishing boats and for destroying stray mines. The home port of the boats was Kiel, and operated under the supervision of Harvey-Jones. Manned by Klose and his crew, they usually departed for the island of Bornholm waving the White Ensign, where they would hoist the Swedish flag for a dash to Gotland, and there they would wait for orders from Hamburg. The first mission consisted in the landing of Lithuanian agents at Palanga, Lithuania, in May 1949, and the last one took place in April 1955 in Saaremaa, Estonia. During the last two years of the operation, three new German-built motorboats replaced the old E-boats. Klose was later assigned the command of a patrol boat in the &quot;Bundesmarine&quot; and became commander-in-chief of the fleet before his retirement in 1978.

==== Royal Danish Navy ====
In 1947, the Danish navy bought twelve former Kriegsmarine boats. These were further augmented in 1951 by six units bought from the Royal Norwegian Navy. The last unit, the P568 &quot;Viben&quot;, was retired in 1965.

==== Royal Norwegian Navy ====
After World War II, the Norwegian Navy received a number of former Kriegsmarine boats. Six boats were transferred to Denmark in 1951.

== Survivor ==
There is just one surviving E-boat, identified as &quot;S130&quot;. It was built as hull No. 1030 at the Schlichting boatyard in Travemünde. &quot;S130&quot; was commissioned on 21 October 1943 and took an active part in the war, participating in the Exercise Tiger attack and attacks on the D-Day invasion fleet.

According to Dutch military historian Maurice Laarman:
In 1945, &quot;S130&quot; was taken as a British war prize (FPB 5030) and put to use in covert operations. Under the guise of the &quot;British Baltic Fishery Protection Service&quot;, the British Secret Intelligence Service MI-6 ferried spies and agents into Eastern Europe. Beginning in May 1949, MI-6 used &quot;S208&quot;, (Kommandant Hans-Helmut Klose) to insert agents into Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, and Poland. The operations were very successful and continued under a more permanent organisation based in Hamburg. In 1952, &quot;S130&quot; joined the operation and the mission was enlarged to include signal intelligence (SIGINT) equipment. In 1954/55, &quot;S130&quot; and &quot;S208&quot; were replaced by a new generation of German S-boote.
&quot;S130&quot; was returned to the newly formed Bundesmarine in March 1957, and operated under the number &quot;UW 10&quot;. Serving initially in the &quot;Unterwasserwaffenschule&quot; training sailors in underwater weaponry such as mines and torpedoes, she later became a test boat under the name EF 3.

&quot;S130&quot; was on display in Wilhelmshaven, Germany, having formerly been used as a houseboat.

&quot;S130&quot; was purchased and towed from Wilhelmshaven to the Husbands Shipyard, Marchwood, Southampton, England in January 2003, under the auspices of the British Military Powerboat Trust. In 2004, &quot;S130&quot; was taken to the slipway at Hythe, where, under the supervision of the BMPT, she was prepared and then towed to Mashfords yard in Cremyll, Cornwall, England to await funding for restoration. In 2008, &quot;S130&quot;, having been purchased by the Wheatcroft Collection, was set up ashore at Southdown in Cornwall to undergo restoration work involving Roving Commissions Ltd. In July 2020, &quot;S130&quot; was still awaiting restoration, with the intention that upon completion it would be a museum-ship at the Richmond dry docks in Bideford, Devon.

== Variants and vessels ==
The &quot;Schnellboot&quot; design evolved over time. The first groups had a pair of torpedo tubes fitted on the foredeck, but from &quot;S26&quot; onwards the forecastle had been raised so that the torpedo tubes were built into the structure.

===&quot;S1&quot;===
The first post-WW1 torpedo boat was ordered in November 1929 to be built by Lürssen at Vegesack, near Bremen, in 1930 as their Yard No. 12120, using mahogany and light metal composite. Originally numbered as &quot;UZ(S)16&quot;, it was commissioned into the Reichmarine on 7 August 1930. It was renamed &quot;W1&quot; on 31 March 1931, and then as &quot;S1&quot; on 16 March 1932. It measured 26.8 x 4.2 x 1.06 metres (87 ft x 13 ft 9in x 3 ft 6in) and had a displacement of 39 tons standard (50 tons full load). Powered by three Daimler-Benz BF2 12-cylinder 900 hp petrol engines on three shafts, with a rating of 2,700 bhp, it had a sustained speed of 34.2 knots (maximum 39.8 knots). It carried two 500mm (19.685 inch) torpedo tubes and one 20mm flak gun. It had a complement of 12 (later 18) men. Along with the next five boats (&quot;S2&quot; to &quot;S6&quot;), it was stricken on 10 December 1936 and sold to Spain as &quot;Badajoz&quot; (renamed &quot;LT15&quot; in 1939).

The number &quot;S1&quot; was re-used in 1939. Five boats had been ordered by Bulgaria from Lürssen, Vegesack, of which the first four were delivered as &quot;F1&quot; to &quot;F4&quot;. The fifth boat was retained in Germany and given the number &quot;S1&quot;. These were petrol-engined boats, similar to the &quot;S2&quot; class built for the Kriegsmarine. Although commissioned in 1939, its petrol engines gave frequent problems, and on 10 September 1940 its stern was rammed (by &quot;S13&quot;) in Vlissingen, and was later removed from active service.

===&quot;S2&quot; class===
The first production of the E-boat in 1931, a lengthened version of the prototype &quot;S1&quot;. The first two were ordered from Lürssen on 28 April 1931 and the other two on 16 July 1931. Each measured 27.95 x 4.2 x 1.06 metres (91 ft 8in x 13 ft 9in x 3 ft 6in) and had a displacement of 46.5 tons standard (58 tons full load). Powered by Daimler-Benz petrol engines on three shafts, with a rating of 3,300 bhp, they had a speed of 33.8 knots. Armament and men as in &quot;S1&quot;. They formed a &quot;Half Flotilla&quot; and were used for training crews for later E-boats; all were stricken on 10 December 1936 (along with &quot;S1&quot;) for transfer to Spain.
The numbers &quot;S2&quot; to &quot;S5&quot; were re-used in 1943. Eight petrol-engined boats similar to the original &quot;S2&quot; class had been ordered from Lürssen, Vegesack, and completed in 1937-39 for that navy as &quot;Orjen&quot;, &quot;Durmitor&quot;, &quot;Suvobor&quot;, &quot;Kajmakcalan&quot;, &quot;Velebit&quot;, &quot;Dinaira&quot;, &quot;Rudnik&quot; and &quot;Triglav&quot;. When Italy occupied Yugoslavia in April 1941, two of them (&quot;Durmitor&quot; and &quot;Kajmakcalan&quot;) escaped to Alexandria and served with the Allied forces, while the other six were commissioned into the Italian Navy as &quot;Ms41&quot; to &quot;Ms46&quot;. In September 1943 &quot;Ms41&quot; (ex &quot;Orjen&quot;) at Monfalcone and &quot;Ms45&quot; (ex &quot;Suvobor&quot;) at Cattolica were scuttled, while the other four were captured by the Germans on 9 September and renamed &quot;S2&quot; (ex &quot;Velebit&quot;), &quot;S3&quot; (ex &quot;Dinara&quot;), &quot;S4&quot; (ex &quot;Triglav&quot;) and &quot;S5&quot; (ex &quot;Rudnik&quot;); all four were scuttled by the Germans at Salonika in October 1944.

===&quot;S6&quot;===
The first diesel-powered boat was also ordered from Lürssen, Vegesack on 28 August 1932. Its dimensions and other details were the same as for &quot;S7&quot; to &quot;S9&quot;. It was stricken and sold to Spain on 10 December 1936 (together with the preceding petrol-engined boats) and renamed &quot;Toledo&quot; (renamed &quot;LT14&quot; in 1939 and stricken in 1942).

===&quot;S7&quot; class===
Built from 1933 onwards. Similar to &quot;S6&quot;, but with an improved hull form, these were the first operational diesel boats. The first three, ordered (together with &quot;S6&quot;) on 26 August 1932, were fitted with MAN L7 19/30 diesels on three shafts giving a speed of 36.5 knots and measured 75.8 tonnes standard (95 tonnes full load), while the last four - ordered on 20 July 1932 - were equipped with the more reliable Daimler-Benz MB502 diesels of 3,960 hp to produce 35 knots, and were 78 tonnes standard (92 tonens full load). They had a fuel capacity of 10.5 tonnes, giving them a radfius of 600 nmiles @ 30 knots. All measured 32.36 x 5.06 x 1.36 m (106 ft 2in x 16 ft 6in x 4 ft 6in) except that &quot;S10&quot; to &quot;S13&quot; had a draught of 1.42m (4 ft 8in). These carried the larger 533mm (21-inch) torpedoes rather than the 500mm of the petrol-driven boats; two torpedo tubes were mounted on the forecastle, and the boats also carried a single 20mm MgC/30 gun, with a crew of 18 (later 21) men.
===&quot;S14&quot; class===
Improved &quot;S7&quot; type, ordered on 16 July 1934 (first two) and 5 November 1935 (last two) with new MAN L11 (11-cylinder) engines producing 6,150 hp, which proved unsatisfactory. Enlarged hull, measuring 34.62 x 5.26 x 1.67 m (113 ft 7in x 17 ft 3in x 5 ft 6in) and displacing 92.5 tonnes standard (105.4 tonnes full load). After &quot;S17&quot; was broken up, the surviving three boatrs were transferred to the Fast A/S Group in 1940.
===&quot;S18&quot; class===
Built from 1937 onwards. Two new boats were ordered on 21 December 1936 (&quot;S18&quot; and &quot;S19&quot;) and six more boats (&quot;S20&quot; to &quot;S25&quot;) on 29 December 1937. Almost identical to the &quot;S14&quot; class, but with 3 Mercedes Benz MB501 engines (of total 6,000 hp) instead of MAN engines. The bridge, which had been in front of the wheelhouse on earlier designs, was raised to the wheelhouse roof to increase all-round visibility.
===1938 Orders===
In May 1938 it was planned to order six additional boats every year until 1943 (thus providing a projected &quot;S26&quot; to &quot;S61&quot;). However, a speeding-up of production was decided on. Twelve additional boats were ordered - all from Lürssen - in August 1938. These were of two different models, due to accommodating different Daimler-Benz diesels.

====&quot;S26&quot; class====

The larger type (&quot;S26&quot; to &quot;S29&quot;), were ordered on 2 August, and entered service in 1940. Beginning with this model, the two torpedo tubes on the foredeck were encased within a high forecastle deck. This type were slightly lengthened from the &quot;S18&quot; design so that the engine compartments could accommodate the larger 20-cylinder diesels, they measured 34.94 x 5.28 x 1.67 m (114 ft 8in x 17 ft 4in x 5 ft 6in), giving a displacement of 92.5 tons (112 tons full load). These dimensions would be retained for all subsequent boats (except for the somewhat smaller &quot;S30&quot; class), as the basic design and layout would remain unchanged. The three Daimler Benz engines each produced 2,000 hp for a total rating of 6,000 hp, providing 39 knots.

====&quot;S30&quot; class====
The other eight boats (&quot;S30&quot; to &quot;S37&quot;) were 2.18 m (7 ft 2in) shorter than the &quot;S26&quot; type and 22 cm (8.66 in) narrower. This is because their engines were the 16-cylinder (2,000 hp) Daimler-Benz MB502 diesels. They were originally ordered on 9 August (a week after &quot;S26&quot; to &quot;S29&quot;) for the Chinese (Nationalist) Navy (the last two initially from Naglo, Berlin, but the contract was later switched to Lürssen), and were sequestered for use by the Kriegsmarine. As they were already under construction at the outbreak of war, they were mostly completed before the &quot;S26&quot; type boats. 
===1939 Orders===

24 more boats were ordered - all from Lürssen (&quot;S44&quot; and &quot;S45&quot; were first scheduled to be built by Stettiner Oderwerk, but in the event all of this batch were contracted to Lürssen - on 24 September 1939. The pre-war Mobilisation New Construction Programme had called for 48 new boats per year, but this target was raised to 60 boats in September 1939 by the Naval War Staff. They called for a fleet level of 40 to 50 operational boats, with 16 being built annually as replacements. Sixteen were virtually identical with the &quot;S26&quot; type (measuring 34.94 m in length and with 20-cylinder MB501 diesels), other than simplified ventilators and other minor changes. This design was to provide almost all of the &quot;Schnellboote&quot; built in Germany for the rest of the war. 
While until this date all boats had been procured from Lürssen, but the German Navy had been seeking a second yard to add to its construction capacity, and on 25 September a contract for eight boats (numbered from &quot;S101&quot; to &quot;S108&quot;) to the standard &quot;S26&quot; design was awarded to Schlichting-Werfk at Travemünde. This second builder was assigned a new series of numbers in the &quot;101 range to distinguish them from the Lürssen boats.
Following the outbreak of war, another eight boats were ordered from Lürssen on 14 November 1939 to the same &quot;Schnellboot 1939&quot; design as the &quot;S30&quot; group (measuring 32.76 m in length and with 16-cylinder MB502 diesels),
===1940 orders===
On 4 June 1940 a further batch of boats to the &quot;S26&quot; design was ordered. This comprised 8 boats from Lürssen (&quot;S62&quot; to &quot;S69&quot;) and 9 boats from Schlichting (&quot;S109&quot; to &quot;S117&quot;). &quot;S67&quot; introduced an improved design with a partially armour-plated cupola (the &quot;Kalotte&quot; or &quot;skull cap&quot;) over the bridge, providing protection from weather as well as small arms fire, with a lower profile. From 1943 orders onwards, this armoured bridge became standard, and was also retro-fitted to many of the earlier boats. Various armaments were carried including 40 mm Bofors or 20 mm Flak aft, MG34 &quot;Zwillingsockel&quot; midships. &lt;br&gt;(Note the designation &#x27;38b&#x27; sometimes seen is not Kriegsmarine nomenclature and originated in a postwar American hobby publication).


Following the German occupation of France in June 1940, the Naval War Staff decided that 160 E-boats were now needed (comprising 26 flotillas), with 8 flotillas based in France and 6 each in Norway, the Baltic and the North Sea. On 26 August an additional four boats (&quot;S70&quot; to &quot;S73&quot;) were ordered from Lürssen, and in December Schlichting were given another order, this time for eight boats (&quot;S118&quot; to &quot;S125&quot;),

===1941 orders===

Another 40 boats were ordered in 1941, 16 from Lürssen on 3 January (numbered &quot;S74&quot; to &quot;S89&quot;), another 16 from the same yard on 18 September (numbered &quot;S90&quot; to &quot;S100&quot; and from &quot;S134&quot; to &quot;S138&quot;) and 8 from Schlichting at Travemünde (&quot;S126&quot; to &quot;S133&quot;), also on 18 September. 


===1942 orders===
Orders for a further 16 boats were given to Lürssen on 24 February 1942. The first 12 of these were numbered &quot;S139&quot; to &quot;S150&quot;; the next sixteen numbers were allocated to construction at Schiedam in Holland, so the final four of the Lürssen batch were numbered &quot;S167&quot; to &quot;S170&quot;.

===&quot;S151&quot; class===
Eight smaller torpedo boats were building for the Dutch Navy at Gusto Werf, Schiedam (near Rotterdam) as &quot;TM54&quot; to &quot;TM61&quot; inclusive. When Holland was occupied by the Germans, these were seized and completed (with some design modifications) by German and Dutch shipyard workers and renumbered as &quot;S151&quot; to &quot;S158&quot;. They measured 28.3 x 4.46 metres (92 ft 10in x 14 ft 7in), displacing 57 tons. Originally the Germans planned to sell these to Bulgaria, and they were formed as the new 7th S-flotilla in October 1941, but the Kriegsmarine&#x27;s need for them in the Mediterranean had caused them to be sent south via the French inland waterways. They were authorised to transfer to the Mediterranean on 15 July 1942, and arrived there on 8 October, finally reaching Augusta, Sicily on 15 December, when they became operational.

Eight further vessels had been intended by the Dutch Navy as &quot;TM62&quot; to &quot;TM70&quot;, and material had been collected for their construction at Schiedam. They were cancelled with the German occupation in May 1940; they were re-ordered (as &quot;S159&quot; to &quot;S166&quot;) from Gusto Werf on 11 July 1941, but construction of these stopped in April 1942.

Continuation of &quot;S139&quot; batch

All these were part of the order placed on 24 February 1942, and the first three were identical to &quot;S139&quot; batch. However the final boat, &quot;S170&quot;, was the prototype (along with &quot;S228&quot; at Travemünde) for the final series of boats ordered in December 1943 (few of which were completed) with the first MB518 engines of 3,000 hp for evaluation; her details were the same as for that final series of orders. 
===1943 orders===

Needing to increase production, orders for two batches of vessels were placed during the first half of 1943, totalling sixty boats. An order for sixteen boats was placed with Lürssen&#x27;s yard on 15 January 1943 (&quot;S171&quot; to &quot;S186&quot;), and another order for eight boats with Schlichting at Travemünde on the same day (&quot;S187&quot; to &quot;S194&quot;). On 7 May another batch was ordered from the same builders - twenty-four from Lürssen (&quot;S195&quot; to &quot;S218&quot;) and twelve from Schlichting (&quot;S219&quot; to &quot;S230&quot;), although the final two from the Schlichting order were seemingly deferred, to be re-included in the much larger order placed in December.

Like the &quot;S139&quot; batch, almost all of these were a metre longer than the original &quot;S26&quot; class in order to have room to fit the new supercharged MB511 engines. The sole exception was &quot;S228&quot; - the final boat from this batch to be completed at Travemünde, which was that yard&#x27;s prototype for the final mass series which were ordered in December 1943, built to carry the new MB518 diesels, and was thus the equivalent test-bed at that yard to &quot;S170&quot; from Lürssen. All the other 57 boats completed from this batch had MB 511 diesels fitted.
The final batch ordered on 4 December 1943 comprised a massive total of 282 units - &quot;S229&quot; to &quot;S260&quot; (32 boats) from Schlichting; &quot;S301&quot; to &quot;S425&quot; (125 boats) from Lürssen; and &quot;S701&quot; to &quot;S825&quot; (125 boats) from Danziger Waggon at Danzig. The first four of the Schlichting boats (&quot;S229&quot; to &quot;S230&quot;) were completed by April 1945 but not placed into service; these were presumably broken up in the shipyard following the cessation of hostilities. Of the projected numbers from the other two builders only the first five from Lürssen and 9 from Danzig were completed. Another seven were launched but not completed; these were scuttled in the North Sea, while fourteen more were scrapped in the Lürssen shipyard (&quot;S308&quot; to &quot;S328&quot;) and others at Travemünde and Danzig. The remainder were all cancelled.
===&quot;S501&quot; class===
These small ex-Italian Navy boats of the Baglietto fast type (or &quot;MAS526&quot; type) were taken over by the Germans in the Black Sea on 20 May 1943. The first seven of these measured 18.7 x 4.7 x 1.5 m (61 ft 4in x 15 ft 5in x 4 ft 11in) and displaced 25.2 tons (29.4 tons full load). These 2-shaft boats were driven by 2 Isotta-Fraschini petrol engines of 2,000 hp to reach 42 knots. They carried two 450mm torpedoes plus one MG or 20mm gun, and 6 depth charges, with a crew of 10. All 7 were transferred to the Romania in August 1943, but seized by the USSR on 5 September 1943.
===&quot;S601&quot; class===
Further small ex-Italian Navy boats of the Baglietto fast type (of various classes) were taken over by the Germans.
===&quot;S700&quot; class===
Late war design proposal with stern torpedo tubes and 30 mm gun turret forward. These were intended to be slightly larger, of prefabricated construction, and to be propelled by the supercharged MB518 engines. They were to have carried two stern-firing torpedo tubes in addition to the usual two bow tubes, with a special 30mm gun in a bow turret. These were ordered from Danziger Waggonfabrik at Danzig on 4 December 1943 as &quot;S701&quot; to &quot;S825&quot; (125 boats), but only the first nine boats were built, and these were completed to &quot;S100&quot; design specification with MB511 diesel engines after the production of the MB518 engine was cancelled due to Allied bombing. The other boats were cancelled or scrapped unfinished in the shipyard. 

In the 1944 Programme it was intended to increase production of E-boats to deliver 150 boats per annum, but this level was never achieved. In November 1944 there were 292 boats on order, of which 138 were under construction, usually awaiting delivery of the new MB518 engines, while the other 154 boats were unstarted. Eventually, as the ability to provide engines increased, only 19 of the 138 boats were actually completed.

===KS-boats (&quot;Kleinst Schnellboote&quot;), originally KM-series (&quot;Küstenminenleger&quot;)===
A class of small fast attack craft designed as offensive mine-layers (rated &quot;Küstenminenleger&quot;), able to carry up to 4 mines, and to operate close to enemy shores. They measured 15.95 x 3.50 x 1.10 m (52 ft 4in x 11 ft 6in x 3 ft 7in); 15/16 tonnes standard (18/19 tonnes full load). Powered by 2 BMW MB507 12-cylinder aero engines producing 1,650 hp (32 knots), although four boats (nos. 1, 2, 5 and 6) had two Junkers 4-cylinder diesels of 1,500 hp to produce speeds of 30/40.9 knots; radius 225 miles at 25 knots. A total of 36 were ordered (most on 29 and 31 July 1940, but &quot;KM1&quot; to &quot;KM4&quot; were ordered on 26 August, and &quot;KM25&quot; and &quot;KM26&quot; on 11 October 1940), but as their engines proved unreliable, they were not used in their intended role and instead most were employed in lakes and rivers, being attached to the Peipusee Flotilla (&quot;KM3&quot; to the Ladogasee Flotilla). As minelayers they carried four TMB mines and a single Mg39 gun, plus a crew of 6. 21 boats were equipped with 2 x 450mm fixed stern torpedo tubes replkacing the mines, and were reclassed as KS-boats (&quot;Kleinst Schnellboote&quot;), retaining their original numbers but replacing the &quot;KM&quot; prefix by &quot;KS&quot;. 

Of the unreclassified boats, &quot;KM27&quot; to &quot;KM30&quot; were all sunk by Soviet aircraft in the Gulf of Bothnia during 1943.

===LS-boats (&quot;Leichte Schnellboote&quot;)===
Another class of even smaller fast attack boat, not intended to operate independently, but to be based on auxiliary cruisers or other vessels operating in overseas areas. They measured 12.50 x 3.46 x 1.02 m (41 ft x 11 ft 4in x 3 ft 4in). These 2-shaft boats weighed 11.5 - 13 tons. The first six were powered by two Junkers 6-cyl JuMo205 aircraft engines, they reached 38 knots. Later boats had two Daimler-Benz MB507 12-cyl diesels of 2,000 hp reaching 40.9 knots, and with an endurance of 300 miles at 30 knots. They carried two 450mm torpedo tubes (instead of up to 4 mines), but had depth charges and a single 20mm MG (in an enclosed turret), plus 7 men. A total of 34 of these boats were ordered, the prototype from Naglo Werft, Berlin, and all the others from Dornier Werft, Friedrichshafen, but the prototype was not completed and only the next eleven were completed; another six (&quot;LS13&quot; to &quot;LS18&quot;) were taken over by France incomplete following the war&#x27;s end, and completed for them; the final 16 (&quot;LS19&quot; to &quot;LS34&quot;) were cancelled in 1944.

<text>Billings Bridge Shopping Centre is a shopping mall located in the Billings Bridge neighbourhood of Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. It is a medium-sized community mall with 83 stores and services. Roughly 7.5 million people visit the mall every year and sales are about $527/sq foot. When built, it was the first strip mall in Ottawa, although it has since become an enclosed mall. It is located immediately south of the Rideau River on the corner of Bank Street and Riverside Drive. The mall&#x27;s anchor stores are Walmart and Your Independent Grocer.

Billings Bridge Shopping Centre opened in 1954 as &quot;the first one-stop shopping destination to serve all of the City of Ottawa&quot; according to its owners. At it was Ottawa&#x27;s first strip mall. The mall originally consisted of just six stores, of which only Reitmans remains to this day. CIBC and Fairweather were also very early tenants which still remain.

In the years following the mall&#x27;s opening, twenty stores in the mall were staying open past 6 pm on weekdays, the required time of closure by City of Ottawa by-law. As of 1956, the six units that took the municipality to court lost their appeal in court.

The mall opened an expansion in November 1961, and another in March 1962, the latter bringing it to 33 stores. This made it one of Ottawa&#x27;s largest shopping centres. The parking lot also expanded from 500 spots to 1400. The 1962 addition added an Ogilvy&#x27;s department store, the first location in a shopping centre, Steinberg&#x27;s, and a Woolworth&#x27;s. A 1961 &quot;Ottawa Citizen&quot; article covering a mall expansion claimed &quot;the new centre by its accessibility to through highways, will become not only one of the largest shopping plazas in the district but one of the finest in the country.&quot; The Ogilvy&#x27;s store was rebranded as a Robinson&#x27;s in 1984 after which it was replaced by discount retailer Zellers in 1996, by Target in 2013 and then by Walmart in 2016.

Billings Bridge Shopping Centre was converted into an enclosed mall in 1972. A twelve-storey office tower was also added during an expansion in 1975.

Billings Bridge Station opened on November 2, 1996, providing bus service via the southeast Transitway. It continues to serve as a major hub for OC Transpo bus services.

In the late 1990s, a &quot;remerchandizing program&quot; brought in a number of new stores to replace old ones and &quot;provide the proper tenant mix to suit this particular trade area and the shopping centre&#x27;s customer base.&quot; In 1998–99, a renovation was carried out to add a two-storey glass atrium as a main entrance and a new food court on the second floor. In July 2006, another major renovation program was started which expanded the mall by .

In 2004, Brian Card, president of Corporate Research Group said, &quot;Billings Bridge&#x27;s proximity to public transit, office buildings and growing population centres has helped it to withstand competition from big-box power centres when other shopping centres have been hard-hit.&quot; Barry Nabatian, general manager of Market Research Corporation, argued that the South Keys Shopping Centre had taken the role as &#x27;regional mall&#x27; in the south of Ottawa, as it was larger, more popular, and had higher sales/sq foot. A 2005 article by &quot;Ottawa Business Journal&quot; said that the &quot;lack of a major anchor department store has kept it from becoming a regional centre.&quot; Today the mall is considered a &#x27;community&#x27; shopping centre.

&quot;Jidaigeki&quot; show the lives of the samurai, farmers, craftsmen, and merchants of their time. &quot;Jidaigeki&quot; films are sometimes referred to as chambara movies, a word meaning &quot;sword fight&quot;, though chambara is more accurately a subgenre of &quot;jidaigeki&quot;. &quot;Jidaigeki&quot; rely on an established set of dramatic conventions including the use of makeup, language, catchphrases, and plotlines.

==Types==

Many &quot;jidaigeki&quot; take place in Edo, the military capital. Others show the adventures of people wandering from place to place. The long-running television series &quot;Zenigata Heiji&quot; and &quot;Abarenbō Shōgun&quot; typify the Edo &quot;jidaigeki&quot;. &quot;Mito Kōmon&quot;, the fictitious story of the travels of the historical &quot;daimyō&quot; Tokugawa Mitsukuni, and the &quot;Zatoichi&quot; movies and television series, exemplify the traveling style.

Another way to categorize &quot;jidaigeki&quot; is according to the social status of the principal characters. The title character of &quot;Abarenbō Shōgun&quot; is Tokugawa Yoshimune, the eighth Tokugawa &quot;shōgun&quot;. The head of the samurai class, Yoshimune assumes the disguise of a low-ranking , a samurai in the service of the shogun. Similarly, Mito Kōmon is the retired vice-shogun, masquerading as a merchant. 

In contrast, the coin-throwing Heiji of &quot;Zenigata Heiji&quot; is a commoner, working for the police, while Ichi (the title character of &quot;Zatoichi&quot;), a blind masseur, is an outcast, as were many disabled people in that era. In fact, masseurs, who typically were at the bottom of the professional food chain, was one of the few vocational positions available to the blind in that era. &quot;Gokenin Zankurō&quot; is a samurai but, due to his low rank and income, he has to work extra jobs that higher-ranking samurai were unaccustomed to doing.

Whether the lead role is samurai or commoner, &quot;jidaigeki&quot; usually reach a climax in an immense sword fight just before the end. The title character of a series always wins, whether using a sword or a &quot;jitte&quot; (the device police used to trap, and sometimes to bend or break, an opponent&#x27;s sword).

==Roles==
Among the characters in &quot;jidaigeki&quot; are a parade of people with occupations unfamiliar to modern Japanese and especially to foreigners. Here are a few:

===Warriors===

The warrior class included samurai, hereditary members in the military service of a &quot;daimyō&quot; or the &quot;shōgun&quot;, who was a samurai himself. &quot;Rōnin&quot;, samurai without masters, were also warriors, and like samurai, wore two swords, but they were without inherited employment or status. &quot;Bugeisha&quot; were men, or in some stories women, who aimed to perfect their martial arts, often by traveling throughout the country. &quot;Ninja&quot; were the secret service, specializing in stealth, the use of disguises, explosives, and concealed weapons.

===Craftsmen===
Craftsmen in &quot;jidaigeki&quot; included metalworkers (often abducted to mint counterfeit coins), bucket-makers, carpenters and plasterers, and makers of woodblock prints for art or newspapers.

===Merchants===
In addition to the owners of businesses large and small, the &quot;jidaigeki&quot; often portray the employees. The &quot;bantō&quot; was a high-ranking employee of a merchant, the &quot;tedai&quot;, a lower helper. Many merchants employed children, or &quot;kozō&quot;. Itinerant merchants included the organized medicine-sellers, vegetable-growers from outside the city, and peddlers at fairs outside temples and shrines. In contrast, the great brokers in rice, lumber and other commodities operated sprawling shops in the city.

===Governments===
In the highest ranks of the shogunate were the &quot;rojū&quot;. Below them were the &quot;wakadoshiyori&quot;, then the various &quot;bugyō&quot; or administrators, including the &quot;jisha bugyō&quot; (who administered temples and shrines), the &quot;kanjō bugyō&quot; (in charge of finances) and the two &quot;Edo machi bugyō&quot;. These last alternated by month as chief administrator of the city. Their role encompassed mayor, chief of police, and judge, and jury in criminal and civil matters.
The machi bugyō oversaw the police and fire departments. The police, or , included the high-ranking and the below them; both were samurai. In they often have full-time patrolmen, and , who were commoners. (Historically, such people were irregulars and were called to service only when necessary.) Zenigata Heiji is an . The police lived in barracks at Hatchōbori in Edo. They manned &quot;ban&#x27;ya&quot;, the watch-houses, throughout the metropolis. The was the symbol of the police, from to .

A separate police force handled matters involving samurai. The &quot;ōmetsuke&quot; were high-ranking officials in the shogunate; the &quot;metsuke&quot; and &quot;kachi-metsuke&quot;, lower-ranking police who could detain samurai. Yet another police force investigated arson-robberies, while Shinto shrines and Buddhist temples fell under the control of another authority. The feudal nature of Japan made these matters delicate, and jurisdictional disputes are common in &quot;jidaigeki.&quot;

Edo had three fire departments. The &quot;daimyō-bikeshi&quot; were in the service of designated &quot;daimyōs&quot;; the &quot;jōbikeshi&quot; reported to the shogunate; while the &quot;machi-bikeshi&quot;, beginning under Yoshimune, were commoners under the administration of the &quot;machi-bugyō&quot;. Thus, even the fire companies have turf wars in the &quot;jidaigeki&quot;.
Each &quot;daimyō&quot; maintained a residence in Edo, where he lived during &quot;sankin-kōtai&quot;. His wife and children remained there even while he was away from Edo, and the ladies-in-waiting often feature prominently in &quot;jidaigeki&quot;. A high-ranking samurai, the &quot;Edo-garō&quot;, oversaw the affairs in the &quot;daimyō&quot;″s absence. In addition to a staff of samurai, the household included &quot;ashigaru&quot; (lightly armed warrior-servants) and &quot;chūgen&quot; and &quot;yakko&quot; (servants often portrayed as flamboyant and crooked). Many &quot;daimyōs&quot; employed doctors, &quot;goten&#x27;i&quot;; their counterpart in the shogun&#x27;s household was the &quot;okuishi&quot;. Count on them to provide the poisons that kill and the potions that heal.

===Other===
The cast of a wandering &quot;jidaigeki&quot; encountered a similar setting in each &quot;han.&quot; There, the &quot;karō&quot; were the &quot;kuni-garō&quot; and the &quot;jōdai-garō&quot;. Tensions between them have provided plots for many stories.

==Conventions==
There are several dramatic conventions of &quot;jidaigeki&quot;:

*The heroes often wear eye makeup, and the villains often have disarranged hair.
*A contrived form of old-fashioned Japanese speech, using modern pronunciation and grammar with a high degree of formality and frequent archaisms.
*In long-running TV series, like &quot;Mito Kōmon&quot; and &quot;Zenigata Heiji&quot;, the lead and supporting actors sometimes change. This is done without any rationale for the change of appearance. The new actor simply appears in the place of the old one and the stories continue. This is similar to the James Bond film series or superhero films, in contrast with e.g. the British television program &quot;Doctor Who&quot;.
*In a sword fight, when a large number of villains attacks the main character, they never attack at once. The main character first launches into a lengthy preamble detailing the crimes the villains have committed, at the end of which the villains then initiate hostilities. The villains charge singly or in pairs; the rest wait their turn to be dispatched and surround the main character until it is their turn to be easily defeated. Sword fights are the grand finale of the show and are conducted to specially crafted theme music for their duration.
*On television, even fatal sword cuts draw little blood, and often do not even cut through clothing. Villains are chopped down with deadly, yet completely invisible, sword blows. Despite this, blood or wounding may be shown for arrow wounds or knife cuts.
*In chambara films, the violence is generally considerably stylized, sometimes to such a degree that sword cuts cause geysers of blood from wounds. Dismemberment and decapitation are common as well.

===Proverbs and catchphrases===
Authors of &quot;jidaigeki&quot; work pithy sayings into the dialog. Here are a few:

* : Like bugs that fly into the fire in the summer (they will come to their destruction)
* : A wolf in sheep&#x27;s clothing (literally, a parasite in the lion&#x27;s body)
* : Fires and brawls are the flower of Edo
* : &quot;The eight hundred neighborhoods of Edo&quot;
* : &quot;On the road you need a companion&quot;

The authors of series invent their own catchphrases called that the protagonist says at the same point in nearly every episode. In &quot;Mito Kōmon&quot;, in which the eponymous character disguises himself as a commoner, in the final sword fight, a sidekick invariably holds up an accessory bearing the shogunal crest and shouts, : &quot;Back! Can you not see this emblem?&quot;, revealing the identity of the hitherto unsuspected old man with a goatee beard. The villains then instantly surrender and beg forgiveness. 

Likewise, Tōyama no Kin-san bares his tattooed shoulder and snarls, : &quot;I won&#x27;t let you say you forgot this cherry-blossom blizzard!&quot; After sentencing the criminals, he proclaims, : &quot;Case closed.&quot;

==Influence==
&quot;Star Wars&quot; creator George Lucas has admitted to being inspired significantly by the period works of Akira Kurosawa, and many thematic elements found in &quot;Star Wars&quot; bear the influence of Chanbara filmmaking. In an interview, Lucas has specifically cited the fact that he became acquainted with the term &quot;jidaigeki&quot; while in Japan, and it is widely assumed that he took inspiration for the term Jedi from this.

<text>Type II keratins (or Type II cytokeratins) constitutes the Type II intermediate filaments (IFs) of the intracytoplasmatic cytoskeleton, which is present in all mammalian epithelial cells. The type 2 cytokeratins consist of basic or neutral, high molecular weight proteins which in vivo are arranged in pairs of heterotypic Type I and Type II keratin chains, coexpressed during differentiation of simple and stratified epithelial tissues. It has been seen that Type II Keratins are developed before Type 1 keratins during human embryonic development.

Type II cytokeratins are encoded on chromosome 12q and encompasses: CK1, CK2, CK3, CK4, CK5, CK6, CK7 and CK8. Their molecular weight ranges from 52 kDa (CK8) to 67 kDa (CK18).

Overall, keratin type 2 plays a crucial role in maintaining the strength and integrity of the skin, hair, and nails. Mutations in keratin genes can lead to various genetic disorders that affect these tissues, such as epidermolysis bullosa simplex, a rare condition characterized by blistering and erosion of the skin and mucous membranes.

== Keratin 2 Types: 2A and 2B ==
Type II Keratins are divided into 2 subtypes: Type IIA Keratins and Type IIB Keratins. Type 2A keratins are expressed in tissues that require high levels of mechanical stress, such as the soles of the feet, while type 2B keratins are expressed in tissues that are subject to less stress, such as the palms of the hands.

=== Type IIA Keratins ===

Type IIA Keratins are characterized by their expression in tissues that undergo high stress, like soles of the feet or palms of the hand. There are several different type 2A keratins that have been identified in humans, including K1, K2, K9, K10, K77, and K78. These keratins are expressed in a tissue-specific manner, with K1, K2, and K10 being predominantly expressed in the epidermis, while K9, K77, and K78 are expressed in the nail bed and hair follicles.

Type IIA keratins have a unique structural feature that allows them to form coiled-coil dimers, which then assemble into tetramers and eventually into intermediate filaments. This structural organization provides the mechanical strength and resilience necessary to withstand the stresses experienced by the tissues in which they are expressed. Mutations in type 2A keratin genes can lead to various genetic disorders, such as epidermolytic hyperkeratosis (EHK) and palmoplantar keratoderma (PPK), which are characterized by hyperkeratosis and blistering of the skin on the palms and soles.

=== Type IIB Keratins ===
Type IIB keratins are a group of intermediate filament proteins that are primarily expressed in epithelial tissues, such as the skin, nails, and hair follicles. They belong to the keratin family of proteins, which are characterized by their highly conserved alpha-helical coiled-coil domains. Keratin type IIB is encoded by the KRT6B gene and is often co-expressed with the equivalent keratin type IIA (KRT6A) in a variety of epithelial tissues. Together, these two proteins form heterodimers that assemble into intermediate filaments, which provide mechanical stability and resistance to mechanical stress. In addition to their structural role, type IIB keratins have been shown to play important roles in wound healing, inflammation, and cell migration. Dysregulation of type IIB keratin expression or mutations in the KRT6B gene have been associated with a variety of skin disorders, including psoriasis, epidermolysis bullosa, and pachyonychia congenita.

<doc id="916327" wikidata="Q3541093" url="?curid=916327" title="Trudeaumania">
<text>Trudeaumania was the term used throughout 1968 to describe the excitement generated by Pierre Elliott Trudeau&#x27;s entry into the April 1968 Liberal Party of Canada leadership election. Trudeau won the leadership election and was sworn in as prime minister. Trudeaumania continued during the subsequent federal election (in which the Liberals won a strong majority government) and during Trudeau&#x27;s early years as prime minister. Decades later, Trudeau&#x27;s son, Justin Trudeau, drew a similar international reaction when he became prime minister himself in 2015.

== &quot;Trudeaumania&quot; and Pierre Elliott Trudeau ==

According to much contemporary journalism during the election, many young people in Canada, especially young women, were influenced by the 1960s counterculture and identified with Trudeau, an energetic nonconformist who was relatively young. They were dazzled by his &quot;charm and good looks&quot;, and a large fan base was claimed to exist throughout the country. He would often be stopped in the streets for his autograph or for photographs. Trudeau had once sympathized with Marxists and had spent time in the democratic socialist Cooperative Commonwealth Federation, and many of his fans were attracted to his culturally liberal stances (he legalized homosexuality and created more flexible abortion and divorce laws as Justice Minister under Prime Minister Lester B. Pearson). Trudeau was also admired for his laid-back attitude and his celebrity relationships; in that word&#x27;s prevailing use at the time, describing a modern, &quot;hip and happening person&quot;, he was often described as a swinger.

When Pearson announced his intention to step down, Trudeau entered the race for the Liberal leadership. His energetic campaign attracted widespread media attention and mobilized many who saw Trudeau as a symbol of generational change. On April 6, Trudeau was elected leader on the fourth ballot, with the support of 51 percent of the delegates. He was sworn in as prime minister on April 20, and subsequently called an election for June 25. A high point happened during Trudeau&#x27;s election campaign during the annual Saint-Jean-Baptiste Day parade in Montreal, when rioting Quebec separatists threw rocks and bottles at the grandstand where Trudeau was seated. Rejecting the pleas of his aides that he take cover, Trudeau stayed in his seat, facing the rioters, without any sign of fear. The image of the politician showing such courage impressed the Canadian people. He handily won the election the next day, with the Liberals winning a comfortable majority government; this was the party&#x27;s first majority victory since 1953.

Trudeaumania began to abate as a media theme in the early 1970s due to rising inflation and rising unemployment; in the 1972 election, Trudeau lost his majority and narrowly won a minority government. However, he served a total of 15 and a half years as prime minister (from 1968 to 1979 and 1980 to 1984) and won two additional majority governments in 1974 and 1980. Trudeau is remembered as one of Canada&#x27;s most polarizing politicians and prime ministers, fondly recalled by many Central and Eastern Canadians. He was, however, deeply unpopular among conservative and nationalist thinkers, especially in Quebec and the western provinces; opposition to Trudeau was particularly vehement in Alberta, which long viewed him as an adversary for his National Energy Policy of 1980-85, leading to a renewal of western alienation. Trudeau was nevertheless named the Canadian Newsmaker of the 20th Century by the Canadian Press at the dawn of the year 2000. When he died later that year, there was an outpouring of public grief, and he was again named Newsmaker of the Year for 2000 itself. In 2004, he was voted the third-Greatest Canadian by CBC viewers, after Terry Fox and Tommy Douglas. 

A Canadian board game of the early 1980s, &quot;True Dough Mania&quot;, was titled with a pun on the phenomenon. The game was a satire on Canadian politics.

== Criticisms ==

Some revisionist historians of Canadian politics deny that Trudeaumania ever substantially existed, or believe that it was largely a media invention to promote Pierre Trudeau or sell newspapers, similar to the over-romanticized description of John F. Kennedy&#x27;s term as Camelot. Robert Wright critiques the persistent media myth of &quot;the hipster Montrealer who drove up to Ottawa in his Mercedes in 1965,&quot; and Paul Litt, claiming that the phrase was made up by newspaper columnist Lubor Zink, similarly views the phenomenon as exaggerated by supportive journalists and pundits, including Peter C. Newman and Pierre Berton.

== Justin Trudeau ==

In 2015, Pierre Trudeau&#x27;s son, Justin Trudeau, became prime minister after he led the Liberals to a majority government in the 2015 federal election. When Justin&#x27;s face was in the international press, he drew comments of a similar nature online as a senior Canadian politician who was unexpectedly young looking and handsome in the general public&#x27;s opinion.

<text>Keratin 14 is a member of the type I keratin family of intermediate filament proteins. Keratin 14 was the first type I keratin sequence determined.
Keratin 14 is also known as cytokeratin-14 (CK-14) or keratin-14 (KRT14). In humans it is encoded by the &quot;KRT14&quot; gene.

Keratin 14 is usually found as a heterodimer with type II keratin 5 and form the cytoskeleton of epithelial cells.

==Pathology==
Mutations in the genes for these keratins are associated with epidermolysis bullosa simplex and dermatopathia pigmentosa reticularis, both of which are autosomal dominant mutations.

<text>David Watson Ford (born March 23, 1967, in Edmonton, Alberta) is a Canadian slalom canoeist who has competed since the mid-1980s and is still actively competing. He is Canada&#x27;s most successful slalom paddler.

==Career==

Ford has won two medals in the K1 event at the ICF Canoe Slalom World Championships. In 1999 he became the first non-European to win the World Championship title. Ford followed up with a World Championship silver in 2003. In 2003 he also won the overall World Cup title in K1. He was named Male Athlete of the Year at the 2003 Canadian Sport Awards, and was inducted into the BC Sports Hall of Fame in 2005.

Ford has competed in five Summer Olympics, earning a fourth-place finish in the K1 event in Athens in 2004. He had a sixth-place finish in the same event in 2008 in Beijing. Ford could not get a sixth appearance in the 2012 Summer Olympics, as of his elbow tendons had ruptured prior to the qualifier, and with no time for the required surgery, countless injections were unable to produce an adequate result for him to paddle to his abilities.

==World Cup individual podiums==


:1 Pan American Championship counting for World Cup points

==Personal life==

On April 25, 2009, Ford married Canadian alpine skier Kelly VanderBeek. They have a son, Cooper.

<text>Jiang Tingxi (, 1669–1732), courtesy name Yangsun (), was a Chinese painter, and an editor of the encyclopedia &quot;Complete Classics Collection of Ancient China&quot;.

Jiang was born in Changshu, Jiangsu. Besides the name Yangsun, he was also known by his courtesy name Youjun (), as well as the pseudonyms Nansha (), Qingtong Jushi, Qiujun, and XiGu ().

The 5020-volume state-sponsored encyclopedia &quot;Complete Classics Collection of Ancient China&quot; () was published in 1726 and had been compiled by Chen Menglei and Jiang Tingxi during the reigns of the Kangxi and Yongzheng emperors in the Qing dynasty.

As an official painter and grand secretary to the imperial court, Jiang used a wide variety of artistic styles, and focused particularly on paintings of birds and flowers. He was also proficient in calligraphy. His works influenced later court painters, including Yu Sheng (), Yu Zhi ().

Although better known for his &quot;Complete Classics Collection of Ancient China&quot;, Jiang also contributed—along with other scholars—in the compilation of the &quot;Daqing Yitongzhi&quot; (&#x27;Gazetteer of the Qing Empire&#x27;). This geographical gazetteer was provided with a preface in 1744 (more than a decade after Jiang&#x27;s death), revised in 1764, and reprinted in 1849.

Apart from cultural activity, as a holder of the &quot;jinshi&quot; degree Tinxi performed the important duties in the Qing government&#x27;s Office of Military Finance, on par with Zhang Tingyu (headed by Yinxiang, the Yongzheng Emperor&#x27;s brother).

<text>Type I keratins (or Type I cytokeratins) are cytokeratins that constitute the Type I intermediate filaments (IFs) of the intracytoplasmatic cytoskeleton, which is present in all mammalian epithelial cells. Most of the type I keratins consist of acidic, low molecular weight proteins which in vivo are arranged in pairs of heterotypic Type I and Type II keratin chains, coexpressed during differentiation of simple and stratified epithelial tissues.

Type I keratins are encoded on chromosome 17q and encompasses: K9, K10, K11, K12, K13, K14, K15, K16, K17, K18, K19 and K20. Their molecular weight ranges from 40 kDa (K19) to 64 kDa (K9).

<text>Viktor Vladimirovich Khlebnikov, better known by the pen name  (; – 28 June 1922), was a Russian poet and playwright, a central part of the Russian Futurist movement, but his work and influence stretch far beyond it. Influential linguist Roman Jakobson hailed Khlebnikov as &quot;the greatest world poet of our century&quot;.

==Biography==
Viktor Vladimirovich Khlebnikov was born in 1885 in Malye Derbety, Astrakhan Governorate, Russian Empire (in present-day Kalmykia). He was of Russian, Armenian and Zaporozhian Cossack descent. His younger sister, Vera Khlebnikova, was an artist. He moved to Kazan, where he attended school. He then attended school in Saint Petersburg. He eventually quit school to become a full-time writer. His earliest works are from 1908.

In 1909-10, he met the to-be Russian Futurists Vasily Kamensky, David Burliuk, and Vladimir Mayakovsky. Soon Khlebnikov would belong to Hylaea, the most significant Russian Futurist group (along with Mayakovsky, Aleksei Kruchenykh, David Burliuk and Benedikt Livshits). However, he had already written many significant poems before the Futurist movement in Russia had taken shape. Among his contemporaries, he was regarded as &quot;a poet&#x27;s poet&quot; (Mayakovsky referred to him as a &quot;poet for producers&quot;) and a maverick genius. Khlebnikov was involved in the publication of &quot;A Slap in the Face of Public Taste&quot; in 1912, which was a critical component of the Russian futurist poetry.

Khlebnikov is known for poems such as &quot;Incantation by Laughter&quot;, &quot;Bobeobi Sang The Lips&quot;, &quot;The Grasshopper&quot; (all 1908-1909), &quot;Snake Train&quot; (1910), the prologue to the Futurist opera &quot;Victory over the Sun&quot; (1913), dramatic works such as &quot;Death&#x27;s Mistake&quot; (1915), prose works such as &quot;Ka&quot; (1915), and the so-called &#x27;super-tale&#x27; (сверхповесть) &quot;Zangezi&quot;, a drama written partly in zaum. He published &quot;Selected Poems with Postscript, 1907–1914&quot; circa 1914. Kazimir Malevich and Pavel Filonov co-illustrated it.

In his work, Khlebnikov experimented with the Russian language, drawing upon its roots to invent huge numbers of neologisms, and finding significance in the shapes and sounds of individual letters of Cyrillic. Along with Kruchenykh, he originated zaum, a language defying translation. He wrote futurological essays about such things as the possible evolution of mass communication (&quot;The Radio of the Future&quot;) and transportation and housing (&quot;Ourselves and Our Buildings&quot;). He described a world in which people live and travel about in mobile glass cubicles that can attach themselves to skyscraper-like frameworks, and in which all human knowledge can be disseminated to the world by radio and displayed automatically on giant book-like displays at streetcorners. In 1912, he also published a method to predict historical events; one of the examples given was a &quot;collapse of an empire in 1917&quot;.

Although Khlebnikov had supported the 1917 Russian Revolution and shared many of its utopian visions, his works were criticized by the Soviets for not conforming to the structures of socialist realism.

In 1921, he was able to travel to Persia; excited at his arrival, he wrote poems chronicling exciting events and the sights around him. He also made friends with several dervishes. He was forced to go back to Russia in August of that year.

In his final years, Khlebnikov became fascinated with Slavic mythology and Pythagorean numerology, drawing up long &quot;Tables of Destiny&quot; decomposing historical intervals and dates into functions of the numbers 2 and 3.

Khlebnikov died while a guest in the house of his friend Pyotr Miturich near Kresttsy, in June 1922. There has been no medical diagnosis of his last illness; he suffered from gangrene and paralysis (he seems not to have recovered the use of his legs after his 1920 hospitalization in Kharkov), and it has been suggested that he died of blood poisoning or toxemia.

A minor planet 3112 Velimir discovered by Soviet astronomer Nikolai Stepanovich Chernykh in 1977 is named after him.

<text>An exclusive economic zone (EEZ), as prescribed by the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, is an area of the sea in which a sovereign state has exclusive rights regarding the exploration and use of marine resources, including energy production from water and wind.

It stretches from the outer limit of the territorial sea (22.224 kilometres or 12 nautical miles from the baseline) out 370.4 kilometres (or 200 nautical miles) from the coast of the state in question. It is also referred to as a maritime continental margin and, in colloquial usage, may include the continental shelf. The term does not include either the territorial sea or the continental shelf beyond the 200 nautical mile limit. The difference between the territorial sea and the exclusive economic zone is that the first confers full sovereignty over the waters, whereas the second is merely a &quot;sovereign right&quot; which refers to the coastal state&#x27;s rights below the surface of the sea. The surface waters are international waters.

==Definition==
Generally, a state&#x27;s exclusive economic zone is an area beyond and adjacent to the territorial sea, extending seaward to a distance of no more than out from its coastal baseline. The exception to this rule occurs when exclusive economic zones would overlap; that is, state coastal baselines are less than apart. When an overlap occurs, it is up to the states to delineate the actual maritime boundary. Generally, any point within an overlapping area defaults to the nearest state.

The exclusive economic zone stretches much further into sea than the territorial waters, which end at from the coastal baseline (if following the rules set out in the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea). Thus, the exclusive economic zones includes the contiguous zone.

States also have rights to the seabed of what is called the extended continental shelf up to from the coastal baseline, beyond the exclusive economic zones, but such areas are not part of their exclusive economic zones. 

The legal definition of the continental shelf does not correspond exactly to the geological meaning of the term, as it also includes the continental rise and slope, and the entire seabed within the exclusive economic zone.

==Origin and history==
The idea of allotting nations&#x27; EEZs to give them more control of maritime affairs outside territorial limits gained acceptance in the late 20th century.

Initially, a country&#x27;s sovereign territorial waters extended (range of cannon shot) beyond the shore. In modern times, a country&#x27;s sovereign territorial waters extend to beyond the shore. One of the first assertions of exclusive jurisdiction beyond the traditional territorial seas was made by the United States in the Truman Proclamation of 28 September 1945. However, it was Chile and Peru respectively that first claimed maritime zones of 200 nautical miles with the Presidential Declaration Concerning Continental Shelf signed by Chilean President Gabriel Gonzalez Videla on 23 June 1947 and by Peruvian President Jose Luis Bustamante y Rivero through Presidential Decree No. 781 of 1 August 1947

It was not until 1982 with the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea that the 200 nautical mile exclusive economic zone was formally adopted.

==Disputes==
The exact extent of exclusive economic zones is a common source of conflicts between states over marine waters.

===Unresolved===

====Arctic Ocean====

* A wedge-shaped section of the Beaufort Sea, an area that reportedly contains substantial oil reserves, is disputed between Canada and the United States.

====Caribbean Sea====

* In 1996, the Dominican Republic and United Kingdom signed an agreement establishing a simplified equidistance boundary between the British Overseas Territory of Turks and Caicos and the Dominican Republic. Mouchoir Bank fell on the Turks and Caicos side of the boundary, and Silver and Navidad Banks on the Dominican Republic side. However, the agreement was not subsequently ratified by either party. Instead, the Dominican Republic declared itself an archipelagic state in 2007, claiming sovereignty over Mouchoir Bank and extending its EEZ beyond the boundary agreement with the United Kingdom. The United Kingdom does not accept the archipelagic status and maritime boundaries claimed by the Dominican Republic.
* Since 2007, the Dominican Republic in Hispaniola considers itself an archipelagic state, encroaching the long-established median or equidistance line dividing the EEZ of the Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico, and claiming portion of the EEZ claimed by the United States in relation to the archipelago of Puerto Rico, itself an unincorporated U.S. territory. The United States does not accept the archipelagic status and maritime boundaries claimed by the Dominican Republic. Victor Prescott, an authority in the field of maritime boundaries, argues that, as the coasts of both states are short coastlines with few offshore islands, an equidistance line is appropriate.

====Indian Ocean====

* Mauritius claims an EEZ for Tromelin Island from France and an EEZ in respect of the British Indian Ocean Territory from the UK. An Exclusive Economic Zone covering 2.3 million square kilometres is claimed by Mauritius.

====Mediterranean Sea====

* Croatia&#x27;s ZERP (Ecological and Fisheries Protection Zone) in the Adriatic Sea caused friction with Italy and Slovenia, and caused problems during the accession of Croatia to the European Union.
* Turkey claims a portion of Cyprus&#x27;s claimed EEZ based on Turkey&#x27;s definition that no islands, including Cyprus, can have a full EEZ and should only be entitled to 12 nautical miles. Furthermore, the internationally unrecognized Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (TRNC) also claims portions of Cyprus&#x27;s claimed EEZ. Turkey also disputes Greece&#x27;s EEZ for the same reason in regards to its islands in the Aegean Sea. Turkey is one of few countries to not have signed UNCLOS.
*Greece claims that the maritime deal between the internationally recognized GNA government of Libya and Turkey is illegal and it signed a counter agreement with Egypt.
* Lebanon claims that the agreement between Cyprus and Israel overlapped its own EEZ.

====Pacific Ocean====

* The South China Sea is the setting for several ongoing disputes between regional powers including China, Taiwan, Vietnam, the Philippines, Indonesia, Malaysia and Brunei.
* Japan claims an EEZ around Okinotorishima, but this is disputed by China, Taiwan, and South Korea, who claim it is an islet which is incapable of generating an EEZ.
* China and South Korea debates over the boundaries of EEZs in the East China Sea and Yellow Sea, including Socotra Rock, a source for territorial dispute.

===Potential===
Regions where a permanent ice shelf extends beyond the coastline are also a source of potential dispute.

===Resolved===
* The Cod Wars between the United Kingdom and Iceland occurred periodically over many decades until they were resolved with a final agreement in 1976.
* In 1992, the Canada–France Maritime Boundary Case, which centred on the EEZ around the French islands of Saint Pierre and Miquelon, was decided by an arbitral tribunal that concurred on the whole with the arguments put forth by Canada. France was awarded 18% of the area it had originally claimed.
* In 1999, following the Hanish Islands conflict, the Permanent Court of Arbitration ruled that the EEZs of Yemen and Eritrea should be demarcated equidistantly between the mainlands of the two nations, without taking account of sovereignty over the islands.
* In 2009, in a dispute between Romania and Ukraine over Snake Island, the UN International Court of Justice decided that Snake Island has no EEZ beyond 12 nautical miles of its own land.
* In 2010, a dispute between Norway and Russia about both territorial waters and EEZ with regard to the Svalbard archipelago as it affects Russia&#x27;s EEZ due to its unique treaty status was resolved. A treaty was agreed in principle in April 2010 between the two states and subsequently officially ratified, resolving this demarcation dispute. The agreement was signed in Murmansk on 15 September 2010.
* In 2014, the Netherlands and Germany resolved an old border dispute regarding the exact location of the border in the Dollart Bay.

==Transboundary stocks==
Fisheries management, usually adhering to guidelines set by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), provides significant practical mechanisms for the control of EEZs. Transboundary fish stocks are an important concept in this control.
Transboundary stocks are fish stocks that range in the EEZs of at least two countries. Straddling stocks, on the other hand, range both within an EEZ as well as in the high seas, outside any EEZ. A stock can be both transboundary and straddling.

==By region or country==

===Region===

====Caribbean Sea====

====Atlantic and Indian Oceans====

====Pacific Ocean====

===Country===
====Algeria====
Algeria on 17 April 2018 established an exclusive economic zone (EEZ) off its coasts by Presidential Decree No. 18-96 of 2 Rajab 1439 corresponding to 20 March 2018. The permanent mission of Spain to the United Nations on 27 July 2018 declared its disagreement with the EEZ announced by Algeria and that the government of Spain indicated its willingness to enter into negotiations with the government of Algeria with a view to reaching a mutually acceptable agreement on the outer limits of their respective exclusive economic zones, The same was done by the Italian mission on 28 November 2018. The two countries indicated that the Algerian measure had been taken unilaterally and without consulting them.

On 25 November 2018, the Algerian Ministry of Foreign Affairs sent an oral note in response to the Spanish protest, explaining that the Algerian government does not recognize the largely exorbitant coordinates contained in Royal Decree 236/2013, which overlap with the coordinates of Presidential Decree n° 18–96 establishing an exclusive economic zone off the coast of Algeria. The Algerian government wished to emphasize that the unilateral delimitation carried out by Spain is not in conformity with the letter of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and has not taken into consideration the configuration, the specific characteristics, and the special circumstances of the Mediterranean Sea, in particular for the case of the two countries whose coasts are located face to face, as well as the objective rules and relevant principles of international law to govern the equitable delimitation of the maritime areas between Algeria and Spain, in accordance with article 74 of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. Algeria expressed its willingness to negotiate for a just solution.

On 20 June 2019, a communication from Algeria was sent. It was addressed to the Italian embassy and the Spanish embassy in Algiers to show their eligibility in Algeria&#x27;s exclusive economic zone.

====Argentina====
Considering the maritime areas claimed, the total area of Argentina reaches 3,849,756 km2. The recognized Argentine EEZ area is 1,159,063 km2.

====Australia====


Australia&#x27;s exclusive economic zone was declared on 1 August 1994, and extends from 12 to 200 nautical miles from the coastline of Australia and its external territories, except where a maritime delimitation agreement exists with another state. To the 12 nautical miles boundary is Australia&#x27;s territorial waters. Australia has the third largest exclusive economic zone, behind France and the United States, but ahead of Russia, with a total area of 8,148,250 square kilometres, which actually exceeds its land territory.

The United Nations Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf (CLCS) confirmed, in April 2008, Australia&#x27;s rights over an additional 2.5 million square kilometres of seabed beyond the limits of Australia&#x27;s EEZ. Australia also claimed, in its submission to the UN Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf, additional Continental Shelf past its EEZ from the &quot;Australian Antarctic Territory&quot;, but these claims were deferred on Australia&#x27;s request. However, Australia&#x27;s EEZ from its Antarctic Territory is approximately 2 million square kilometres.

====Brazil====


Brazil&#x27;s EEZ includes areas around the Fernando de Noronha Islands, Saint Peter and Saint Paul Archipelago, and the Trindade and Martim Vaz Islands.
====Canada====

Canada is unusual in that its exclusive economic zone, covering , is slightly smaller than its territorial waters. The latter generally extend only 12 nautical miles from the shore but also include inland marine waters such as Hudson Bay (about across), the Gulf of Saint Lawrence and the internal waters of the Arctic Archipelago.

====Chile====
Chile&#x27;s EEZ includes areas around the Desventuradas Islands, Easter Island, and the Juan Fernández Islands.

In 2020 and 2022, Chile submitted its partial claims to the United Nations Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf (CLCS) to extend its maritime continental margin.

====China====


The first figure excludes all disputed waters, while the last figure indicates China&#x27;s claimed boundaries, and does not take into account adjacent powers&#x27; claims.

====Croatia====

Croatia proclaimed Ecological and Fisheries Protection Zone in 2003, but it was not enforced toward other European Union states especially Italy and Slovenia. The zone was upgraded to EEZ in 2021 together with Italy and Slovenia. Territorial waters has 18,981 km2, while internal waters located within the baseline cover an additional 12,498 km2, and EEZ covers 24,482 km2 for a total of 55,961 km2. 

====Cyprus====
Cyprus EEZ covers 98,707 square km (38,100 square miles). Cyprus&#x27; EEZ borders those of Greece, Turkey, Syria, Lebanon, Israel and Egypt. 

====Denmark====
The Kingdom of Denmark includes the constituent country (&quot;selvstyre&quot;) of Greenland and the constituent country (&quot;hjemmestyre&quot;) of the Faroe Islands.

====Ecuador====

Area: 1,077,231 km2

====France====

Due to its numerous overseas departments and territories scattered on all oceans of the planet, France possesses the largest EEZ in the world, covering . The EEZ of France covers approximately 7% of the total surface of all the EEZs of the world, whereas the land area of the French Republic is only 0.45% of the total land area of Earth.

====Germany====
Germany declared the establishment of its exclusive economic zone in the North and Baltic Seas on 1 January 1995. The relevant German legal provisions that are applicable within the EEZ include the Maritime Task Act (Seeaufgabengesetz) from 1965, the Maritime Facilities Act (Seeanlagengesetz) from 2017, and prior to that the Sea Facilities Ordinance (Seeanlagenverordnung) from 1997, the Federal Mining Act (Bundesberggesetz) and the Regional Planning Act (Raumordnungsgesetz).

The German EEZ has an area of 32,982 km2. About 70% of the EEZ covers Germany&#x27;s entire North Sea area, while some 29% encompasses the Baltic Sea area.

====Greece====

Greece forms the southernmost part of the Balkan peninsula in the Mediterranean Sea. It includes many small islands which vary between 1,200 and 6,000 in the Aegean Sea and the Ionian Sea. The largest islands are Crete, Euboea, Lesbos, Rhodes and Chios.

Greece&#x27;s EEZ is bordered to the west by Albania and Italy, to the south by Libya and Egypt, and to the east by Cyprus and Turkey.

====India====

India is currently seeking to extend its EEZ to 350 miles.

====Indonesia====

Indonesia has the 6th largest exclusive economic zone in the world. The total size is . It claims an EEZ of 200 nautical miles from its shores. This is due to the 13,466 islands of the Indonesian Archipelago. It has the 2nd largest coastline of 54,720 km (34,000 mi). The five main islands are: Sumatra, Java, Borneo, Sulawesi, and Western New Guinea. There are two major island groups (Nusa Tenggara and the Maluku Islands) and sixty smaller island groups.

====Ireland====

Ireland&#x27;s exclusive economic zone was reported to be the location of a Russian military exercise in January 2022. Russia&#x27;s exercise was then moved outside the economic zone.

====Israel====
In 2010, an agreement was signed with Cyprus concerning the limit of territorial waters between Israel and Cyprus at the maritime halfway point, a clarification essential for safeguarding Israel&#x27;s rights to oil and underwater gas reservoirs. The agreement was signed in Nicosia by Israeli Infrastructure Minister Uzi Landau and the Cypriot Foreign Minister Markos Kyprianou. The two countries agreed to cooperate in the development of any cross-border resources discovered and to negotiate an agreement on dividing joint resources.

====Italy====
Italy has an EEZ of . The country claims an EEZ of 200 nautical miles from its shores, and its three coastlines are the Tyrrhenian Sea to the west, the Ionian Sea to the south and the Adriatic Sea to the east. Italy&#x27;s EEZ is limited by maritime boundaries with neighboring countries to the northwest, east and southeast.

Italy&#x27;s western sea territory stretches from the west coast of Italy on the Tyrrhenian Sea, including the island of Sardinia. The island of Sicily is in the southernmost area. Lampedusa, a tiny island in the Mediterranean Sea, is the country&#x27;s southernmost point. Italy shares treaty-defined maritime boundaries with France, Spain, Algeria, Tunisia, Libya, Malta, Greece, Albania, Montenegro, Croatia and Slovenia.

====Japan====


Japan has the world&#x27;s eighth-largest exclusive economic zone, covering . It claims an EEZ of 200 nautical miles from its shores.

Japan has disputes over its EEZ boundaries with all its Asian neighbors (China, Russia, South Korea, and Taiwan). The above, and relevant maps at the Sea Around Us Project both indicate Japan&#x27;s claimed boundaries, and do not take into account the claims of adjacent jurisdictions.

Japan also refers to various categories of &quot;shipping area&quot; – Smooth Water Area, Coasting Area, Major or Greater Coasting Area, Ocean Going Area – but it is unclear whether these are intended to have any territorial or economic implications.

====Malaysia====
====Mexico====

Mexico&#x27;s exclusive economic zones cover a total surface area of 3,269,386 km2, and places Mexico among the countries with the largest areas in the world.

====New Zealand====

New Zealand&#x27;s EEZ covers , which is approximately fifteen times the land area of the country. Sources vary significantly on the size of New Zealand&#x27;s EEZ; for example, a recent government publication gave the area as roughly 4,300,000 km2. These figures are for the EEZ of New Zealand proper, and do not include the EEZs of other territories in the Realm of New Zealand (the Cook Islands, Niue, Tokelau, and the &quot;Ross Dependency&quot;).

====North Korea====

The exclusive economic zone of North Korea stretches 200 nautical miles from its basepoints in both the West Sea (Yellow Sea) and the Sea of Japan. The EEZ was declared in 1977 after North Korea had contested the validity of the Northern Limit Lines (NLL) set up after the Korean War as maritime borders. The EEZ has not been codified in law and North Korea has never specified its coordinates, making it difficult to determine its specific scope.

In the West Sea, the EEZ remains unspecified in the Korea Bay because China has not determined its own EEZ in the area. The border between the North Korean and South Korean EEZs in the West Sea cannot be determined because of potential overlap and disputes over certain islands.

In the Sea of Japan, the North Korean EEZ can be approximated to be trapezoidal-shaped. The border between North Korea and Russia&#x27;s respective EEZs is the only such border that has been determined in East Asia. Here, the EEZ does not cause many problems, even with regards to South Korea, because the sea is not thought to be rich in resources.

====Norway====
Norway has a large exclusive economic zone of 819,620 km2 around its coast. The country has a fishing zone of 1,878,953 km2, including fishing zones around Svalbard and Jan Mayen.

In April 2009, the United Nations Commission for the Limits of the Continental Shelf approved Norway&#x27;s claim to an additional 235,000 square kilometres of continental shelf. The commission found that Norway and Russia both had valid claims over a portion of the shelf in the Barents Sea.

====Pakistan====

Area: 

The coast of Pakistan is long, extending from Sir Creek in the east to Gwatar Bay in the west and the EEZ extends up to which is equivalent to more than 30% of its land area and ranks sixty-sixth in the world by area.

Pakistan had an EEZ of before their case was accepted by UNCLCS. Pakistan Navy with the help of the National Oceanographic Organization (NIO) initiated the continental shelf case at ministerial level in 1995.

On 26 Aug 2013, a seven-member sub-commission with members from Japan, China, Mozambique, Kenya, Denmark, Georgia and Argentina was formulated at UNCLCS to evaluate the technical details of Pakistan&#x27;s case and after a year accepted Pakistan&#x27;s claim.

On 13 March 2015, UN Commission on the Limits of Continental Shelf (UNCLCS) accepted recommendations for extension of the outer limits of the continental shelf on Pakistan&#x27;s case so far 80 countries had submitted claims to UNCLCS out of which recommendations of 22 countries including Pakistan had been finalised.

It was a historic event in the country&#x27;s history when Pakistan became the first country in the region to have its continental shelf extended to 350 nm.

Some of the claimed territories overlapped the Omani claim. It is believed that the verdict in favour of Pakistan was announced after successful negotiation with Oman.

====Peru====

Area: 857,000 km2

====Philippines====


The Philippines&#x27; EEZ covers .

====Poland====

The Polish EEZ covers the area of within the Baltic Sea.

====Portugal====
Portugal has the 20th largest EEZ in the world. Presently, it is divided in three non-contiguous sub-zones:
* Continental Portugal 327,667 km2
* Azores 953,633 km2
* Madeira 446,108 km2
* Total : 1,727,408 km2
Portugal submitted a claim to extend its jurisdiction over an additional 2.15 million square kilometres of the adjacent continental shelf in May 2009, resulting in an area with a total of more than 3,877,408 km2. The submission, as well as a detailed map, can be found in the Task Group for the extension of the Continental Shelf website.

Spain previously objected to the EEZ&#x27;s southern border, maintaining that it should be drawn halfway between Madeira and the Canary Islands. But Portugal exercises sovereignty over the Savage Islands, a small archipelago north of the Canaries, claiming an EEZ border further south. Spain has no longer disputed the Portuguese claim since 2015.

====Romania====
Area: 23,627 km2

====Russia====

Russia&#x27;s exclusive economic zone, the world&#x27;s fourth largest, is composed of:

* Kaliningrad (Baltic Sea) – 11,634 km2
* Saint Petersburg (Baltic Sea) – 12,759 km2
* Barents Sea – 1,308,140 km2
* Black Sea (without the Crimean EEZ) – 66,854 km2
* Pacific – 3,419,202 km2
* Siberia – 3,277,292 km2
* Total – 8,095,881 km2

====Senegal====

Area: 158,861 km2

====Somalia====
Area: 825,052 km2

====South Africa====
South Africa&#x27;s EEZ includes both that next to the African mainland and that around the Prince Edward Islands, totalling 1,535,538 km2.

* Mainland – 1,068,659 km2
* Prince Edward islands – 466,879 km2

====South Korea====
Area: 300,851 (225,214) km2
====Spain====
Area: 1,039,233 km2

====Sri Lanka====
====Thailand====
Area: 299,397 km2

====Turkey====
Turkey&#x27;s EEZ is bordered by Georgia, Russia, Ukraine, Romania and Bulgaria in the Black Sea to the north, Greece in the Aegean Sea to the west, and Cyprus and Syria in the Mediterranean Sea to the south. Turkey is one of the few countries to not have signed UNCLOS and disputes Greece&#x27;s and Cyprus&#x27; EEZ.

====United Kingdom====

The United Kingdom has the world&#x27;s fifth-largest exclusive economic zone of square km. It comprises the EEZs surrounding the United Kingdom, the Crown Dependencies, and the British Overseas Territories. The figure does not include the EEZ of the British Antarctic Territory.

The EEZ associated with the Falkland Islands and South Georgia are disputed by Argentina. The EEZ of the Chagos Archipelago, also known as the British Indian Ocean Territory, is also disputed with Mauritius which considers the archipelago as a part of its territory.

† A part of the overseas territory of , which together has an EEZ of 1,641,294 square km.

====United States====

The United States&#x27; exclusive economic zone is the second-largest in the world, covering 11,351,000 km2. Areas of its EEZ are located in three oceans as well as the Gulf of Mexico, and the Caribbean Sea. Only France, with its widespread administrative departments and overseas territories in the North Atlantic, the Caribbean, the Indian Ocean, and in extensive island chains of the Pacific, has a larger EEZ than the United States.

Note, the totals in the table actually add up to 12,234,403 square km and 4,723,705 square miles.

====Vietnam====

Vietnam claims an exclusive economic zone (EEZ) of with 200 nautical miles from its shores. These figures do not include the claimed EEZ areas of the Paracel Islands and the Spratly Islands. Vietnam has disputes mainly with the People&#x27;s Republic of China due to the nine-dash line.

<text>Bramwell is a British television series starring Jemma Redgrave as Dr. Eleanor Bramwell, a woman challenging the domination of men in the medical establishment, who runs a free hospital for the poor in the East End of London, during the late Victorian era. The series was produced by Whitby Davison Productions in association with Carlton Television, and was shown on ITV 22 May 1995 to 18 June 1998, in a total of four series.

==Plot==
===Series 1===
The series begins in 1895 with Dr. Eleanor Bramwell, working in a London hospital. She is treated as an inferior by the male doctors, and her opinions are often ignored. After a disagreement with a senior doctor, Eleanor is dismissed. Her father, Dr. Robert Bramwell, recommends she join him in his private practice of rich, elderly clients. Fortunately, Eleanor receives a better offer. Lady Peters, a friend of the family, offers to fund a small hospital in a London slum, where Eleanor will treat the impoverished locals. Together, Eleanor and Lady Peters establish The Thrift, a free hospital with six beds. The Thrift is named for its location on Thrift Street. The staff of the hospital rapidly expands. Stiff, serious Nurse Carr is hired to assist Eleanor, and Mr. Bentley, a former patient with an amputated foot, is hired to act as a porter. Eleanor quickly finds the hospital desperately requires an anaesthetist but has little money to pay for one. She begs a former colleague, Dr. Joe Marsham to work at The Thrift part-time and he agrees on the condition that he will be able to perform surgery as well (which he does free in order to enhance his skills). The first series focuses on the ups and downs of The Thrift. Each episode usually focuses on one patient or event occurring at The Thrift. Social issues of the time are often tackled such as racism, alcoholism or the conditions in the workhouse. Near the end of the season, it appears that Eleanor will be married to a family friend but breaks the engagement when she realises she will be forced to give up her work. As the season closes, Lady Peters becomes seriously ill. Her personal physician misdiagnoses her condition and by the time her true condition is realised, it is too late to save her. After her death, her fortune is left to The Thrift.

===Series 2===
In the Second Series, The Thrift attempts to survive without Lady Peters&#x27; guidance, management and financial assistance. A new character, Dr. Finn O&#x27;Neill is introduced when a cholera epidemic occurs in the area and Finn assists in the hospital. Eleanor, Robert and Dr. Marsham intensely dislike Finn and blame him for the death of a patient. Mr. Bentley also falls ill and because of a miscalculation in medication dosages, dies of poisoning. To assist the impoverished Bentley family, Eleanor hires Mr. Bentley&#x27;s teenage son, Sidney, to act as the porter. Eleanor, despite her original opinions of Dr. O&#x27;Neill, falls in love with him in the last episode of the season. They enjoy a brief romance but are soon separated. Finn is forced to take a two-year position in Chicago but promises to marry Eleanor on his return. Robert Bramwell disapproves of Eleanor&#x27;s relationship with Finn and is shocked when Eleanor admits she consummated the relationship with Finn. The usually close and happy relationship between Eleanor and her father is severely strained.

===Series 3===
Series Three begins a year after Finn&#x27;s leaving. He has returned to England for a conference and takes this opportunity to visit Eleanor. Eleanor confirms that she still wishes to be married to Finn in a year when he permanently returns to England. Mr. Marsham considers taking a better position in Edinburgh, but remains at The Thrift when his wife is diagnosed with breast cancer. The cancer is too advanced to save her and she dies in Dr. Marsham&#x27;s arms. Finn returns, but with shocking news. He has married a young daughter of an American colleague. Eleanor is crushed by the news and is forced to take a vacation from The Thrift. The Thrift struggles to manage without her for several months while she stays in the countryside with friends. It begins to appear that Eleanor, because of her fragile state, will never be able to work again, but she discovers a measles epidemic occurring in the village. The outbreak causes Eleanor to rediscover her passion for medicine and her strong personality. She returns to London. Eleanor is once more forced to see Finn when his new bride becomes sick. As Eleanor cares for her, Finn admits his marriage was purely for money and status. He suggests that Eleanor become his mistress so that he can enjoy the benefits of marriage while still having Eleanor. She refuses and insists she does not love him. In the meantime, Robert has become engaged to a wealthy widow, Alice Costigan. Robert attempts to insist that Eleanor stay with him and Alice once they move, but Eleanor refuses. Robert withdraws all financial support, leading Eleanor to propose to Dr. Marsham. He instead proposes to her, and she accepts.

===Series 4===
The fourth and final series included only two episodes and was dramatically different from the previous three series. Robert Bramwell and Alice Costigan make no appearance in the series, and their whereabouts are not mentioned. Sidney Bentley no longer appears but is replaced by another teenage porter, Tom. Tom appears in only one episode, before enlisting in the army. In the two episodes, Eleanor allows The Thrift to perform medical check-ups on soldiers, which leads to her meeting Major Quarrie. She and Marsham disagree about her decision and decide to end the engagement. Eleanor has an affair with Major Quarrie, despite their clearly different personalities and interests, resulting in a pregnancy. Eleanor makes plans to give the child up for adoption as Major Quarrie is not interested in marriage and will be going to fight in the Boer War in a fortnight. She becomes obsessed with locating the child of a patient at The Thrift and searches the slums. She ignores her responsibilities at The Thrift, alienates her friends and coworkers. Her behaviour forces the manager of The Thrift and Dr. Marsham to dismiss her. She is devastated. At the last minute, Major Quarrie leaves the military and proposes to Eleanor. She accepts his offer because she will be able to keep the child if she is married and because she loves him. Major Quarrie is also clearly besotted with Eleanor. The series ends at the church inside which the two will marry.

<text>Keratin, type I cytoskeletal 10 also known as cytokeratin-10 (CK-10) or keratin-10 (K10) is a protein that in humans is encoded by the &quot;KRT10&quot; gene. Keratin 10 is a type I keratin.

== Function ==

Keratin-10 is a member of the type I (acidic) cytokeratin family, which belongs to the superfamily of intermediate filament (IF) proteins. Keratins are heteropolymeric structural proteins which form the intermediate filament. These filaments, along with actin microfilaments and microtubules, compose the cytoskeleton of epithelial cells. Mutations in this gene are associated with epidermolytic hyperkeratosis. This gene is located within a cluster of keratin family members on chromosome 17q21.

==Interactions==
Keratin 10 has been shown to interact with AKT1.

<text>Thaddeus Cahill (June 18, 1867 – April 12, 1934) was a prominent american inventor of the early 20th century. He is widely credited with the invention of the first electromechanical musical instrument, which he dubbed the telharmonium.

He studied the physics of music at Oberlin Conservatory in Oberlin, Ohio. After working as a clerk for Congress in Washington D.C. to pay for his college studies, he graduated from the Columbian (now George Washington University) Law School in 1889. He became convinced that music could be made with electricity (and also worked on an electric typewriter). He showed his first teleharmonium to Lord Kelvin in 1902. That year he established a laboratory at Holyoke, where he was joined by his brother, Arthur T. Cahill, and where the two would first demonstrate the teleharmonium to a public audience.

Cahill had tremendous ambitions for his invention; he wanted telharmonium music to be broadcast into hotels, restaurants, theaters, and even houses via the telephone line. At a starting weight of 7 tons (and up to 200 tons) and a price tag of $200,000 (approx. $5,514,000 today), only three telharmoniums were ever built, and Cahill&#x27;s vision was never fully implemented.

<text>Keratin 20, often abbreviated CK20, is a protein that in humans is encoded by the &quot;KRT20&quot; gene.

Keratin 20 is a type I cytokeratin. It is a major cellular protein of mature enterocytes and goblet cells and is specifically found in the gastric and intestinal mucosa.

In immunohistochemistry, antibodies to CK20 can be used to identify a range of adenocarcinoma arising from epithelia that normally contain the CK20 protein. For example, the protein is commonly found in colorectal cancer, transitional cell carcinomas and in Merkel cell carcinoma, but is absent in lung cancer, prostate cancer, and non-mucinous ovarian cancer. It is often used in combination with antibodies to CK7 to distinguish different types of glandular tumour.

<text>Keratin, type I cytoskeletal 19 (Keratin-19)) also known as cytokeratin-19 (CK-19) is a 40 kDa protein that in humans is encoded by the &quot;KRT19&quot; gene. Keratin-19 is a type I keratin.

== Function ==
Keratin-19 is a member of the keratin family. The keratins are intermediate filament proteins responsible for the structural integrity of epithelial cells and are subdivided into cytokeratins and hair keratins.

Keratin-19 is a type I keratin. The type I cytokeratins consist of acidic proteins which are arranged in pairs of heterotypic keratin chains. Unlike its related family members, this smallest known acidic cytokeratin is not paired with a basic cytokeratin in epithelial cells. It is specifically found in the embryonic &quot;periderm&quot;, the transiently superficial layer that envelops the developing epidermis. The type I cytokeratins are clustered in a region of chromosome 17 (q12-q21).

== Use as biomarker ==
CYFRA 21-1, a soluble fragment of KRT19, is a tumor marker of various types of cancer, including lung, breast, stomach, pancreas, ovary. KRT19 is commonly expressed in carcinomas of these organs and CYFRA 21-1 is produced when KRT19 is cleaved during cell apoptosis.

Due to its high sensitivity, KRT19 is the most used marker for the RT-PCR-mediated detection of tumor cells disseminated in lymph nodes, peripheral blood, and bone marrow of breast cancer patients. Depending on the assays, KRT19 has been shown to be both a specific and a non-specific marker.

False positivity in CYFRA 21-1 / KRT19 RT-PCR studies include:
* illegitimate transcription (expression of small amounts of KRT19 mRNA by tissues in which it has no real physiological role)
* haematological disorders (KRT19 induction in peripheral blood cells by cytokines and growth factors, which circulate at higher concentrations in inflammatory conditions and neutropenia)
* the presence of pseudogenes (two KRT19 pseudogenes, KRT19a and KRT19b, have been identified, which have significant sequence homology to KRT19 mRNA. Subsequently, attempts to detect the expression of the authentic KRT19 may result in the detection of either or both of these pseudogenes)
* sample contamination (introduction of contaminating epithelial cells during peripheral blood sampling for subsequent RT-PCR analysis).
* trauma and stress (such as shear stress, heat shock, toxins, infection, aging and oxidative stress such as from smoking), which increase KRT19 expression and cell apoptosis
* weight loss and muscle wasting/apoptosis (KRT19 is expressed in muscle)

Moreover, Ck-19 is widely applied as post-operative diagnostic marker of papillary thyroid carcinoma.

Keratin-19 is often used together with keratin 8 and keratin 18 to differentiate cells of epithelial origin from hematopoietic cells in tests that enumerate circulating tumor cells in blood.

== Interactions ==
Keratin-19 has been shown to interact with Pinin.

<doc id="916375" wikidata="Q6583590" url="?curid=916375" title="Zheng (surname)">
<text>Zheng (, ) is a Chinese surname. It is the 7th name on the &quot;Hundred Family Surnames&quot; poem. In 2006, Zheng ranked 21st in China&#x27;s list of top 100 most common surnames. Zheng belongs to the second major group of ten surnames which makes up more than 10% of the Chinese population. Zheng was a major surname of the rich and powerful during China&#x27;s Tang dynasty.

In Republic of China (Taiwan) and Hong Kong, the name is normally romanized as Cheng or Tcheng (occasionally romanized as Chang in Hong Kong although that variant is more commonly used for another Chinese name, Zhang). In Malaysia, Cheng is commonly romanized as Cheng, Cheang, Chang, Tay, Tee and Teh. It is spelled as Tay in Singapore, The in Indonesia, and Ty in Philippines, from the Hakka, Hokkien and Teochew pronunciation of the character. It is also romanized as Dang from Hokchew.

The surname also has taken form outside of Chinese societies: in Korean, the name is written 정 and transliterated as Jeong, Jung, or Chung. It is the fifth most common Korean surname (after Kim, Lee, Park, and Choi), with about 4.85% of the South Korean population (2,230,611 people) having this name.

== Origin ==
The Zheng surname originated in Henan. In 806 BC, King Xuan, the penultimate king of the Western Zhou dynasty, enfeoffed his younger brother Prince You, who became posthumously known as Duke Huan of Zheng, at Zheng (present-day Hua County, Shaanxi). Duke Huan was killed along with King You of Zhou when the Quanrong tribes sacked the Zhou capital Haojing in 771 BC. Duke Huan was succeeded by his son Duke Wu, who helped King Ping of Zhou establish the Eastern Zhou dynasty in Luoyang, and his feudal state of Zheng was also moved east to present-day Henan. His descendants and many people of the state later adopted Zheng as their surname.

The city of Xingyang is considered as the origin place of the people whose surname is Zheng. Today, Xingyang is under the administration of the prefecture-level city of Zhengzhou (鄭州) which translates to &quot;Settlement of Zheng&quot;. Zhengzhou is the capital of Henan province and is located within the boundaries of the ancient state of Zheng (state). There is also another city called Xinzheng (&quot;New Zheng&quot;), also under the administration of Zhengzhou.

The Zheng clan character (鄭) is featured prominently on the flag of the short-lived rebel Kingdom of Tungning founded by Ming-loyalist Koxinga (who had the surname Zheng) in Taiwan. Also called the Kingdom of Formosa. 

During the Tang dynasty the Li family of Zhaojun , the Cui family of Boling , the Cui family of Qinghe , the Lu family of Fanyang , the Zheng family of Xingyang , the Wang family of Taiyuan , and the Li family of Longxi were the seven noble families between whom marriage was banned by law. The marriages between the families were performed clandestinely after the prohibition was implemented on the seven families by Emperor Gaozong. Their status as &quot;Seven Great surnames&quot; became known during Gaozong&#x27;s rule.

Of the top 30 cities in China, 郑 ranked 4th most common surname in the city of Fuzhou.

<doc id="916382" wikidata="Q945475" url="?curid=916382" title="Coleslaw">
<text>Coleslaw or cole slaw (from the Dutch term , meaning &#x27;cabbage salad&#x27;), also known simply as slaw, is a side dish consisting primarily of finely shredded raw cabbage with a salad dressing or condiment, commonly either vinaigrette or mayonnaise. This dish originated in the Netherlands in the 18th century. Coleslaw prepared with vinaigrette may benefit from the long lifespan granted by pickling.

Coleslaw has evolved into various forms globally. The only consistent ingredient in coleslaw is raw cabbage, while other ingredients and dressings vary widely. Some popular variations include adding red cabbage, pepper, shredded carrots, onions, grated cheese, pineapple, pears, or apples, and using dressings like mayonnaise or cream.

== History ==

The term &quot;coleslaw&quot; arose in the 18th century as an anglicisation of the Dutch term (&quot;kool&quot; in Dutch sounds like &quot;cole&quot;) meaning &quot;cabbage salad&quot;. The &quot;cole&quot; part of the word ultimately derives from the Latin , meaning cabbage.

The 1770 Dutch cookbook &quot;The Sensible Cook&quot; () contains a recipe attributed to the author&#x27;s Dutch landlady, who mixed thin strips of cabbage with melted butter, vinegar, and oil. The most commonly prepared recipe for coleslaw is a recent innovation, owing to the invention of mayonnaise during the mid-18th century.

According to &quot;The Joy of Cooking&quot; (1997), raw cabbage is the only entirely consistent ingredient in coleslaw; the type of cabbage, dressing, and added ingredients vary widely. Vinaigrette, mayonnaise, and sour cream-based dressings are all listed; bacon, carrots, bell peppers, pineapple, pickles, onions, and herbs are mentioned explicitly as possible added ingredients.

== Variations and similar dishes ==

There are many variations of the recipe, which include the addition of other ingredients such as red cabbage, pepper, shredded carrots, onion, grated cheese, pineapple, or apple, mixed with a salad dressing such as mayonnaise or cream. Various seasonings, such as celery seed, may be added. The cabbage may come in finely minced pieces, shredded strips, or small squares. Other slaw variants include broccoli slaw, which uses shredded raw broccoli instead of cabbage. Cream, sour cream, or buttermilk are also popular additions. Buttermilk coleslaw is most commonly found in the southern United States.

=== Europe ===
Traditional German &quot;Krautsalat&quot; (cabbage salad) consists of finely shredded cabbage marinated with oil and vinegar. Sometimes onions or apples are added.

Coleslaw with cooked ham and sliced pepper (julienne cut) in Italy is called &quot;insalata capricciosa&quot; (capricious salad).

In Poland, cabbage-based salads resembling coleslaw are commonly served as a side dish with the second course at dinner, next to meat and potatoes. There is no fixed recipe, but typical ingredients include shredded white cabbage (red and Chinese cabbage are also common), finely chopped onions, shredded carrots, and parsley or dill leaves, with many possible additions. These are seasoned with salt, black pepper and a pinch of sugar and tossed with a dash of oil (typically sunflower or rapeseed) and vinegar, while mayonnaise-based dressings are uncommon. An alternative, usually served with fried fish, is made with sauerkraut, squeezed to eliminate excess salty brine and similarly tossed with carrots, onions, black pepper, sugar and oil. Any simple salad of that kind, i.e. one made with shredded raw vegetables, is known as a &quot;surówka&quot; ( &#x27;raw&#x27;). If cabbage is the base ingredient, it is called a &quot;surówka z (kiszonej) kapusty&quot;, or a &quot;(soured) cabbage salad&quot;. The English name &quot;coleslaw&quot; is mainly associated with the mayonnaise-dressed cabbage. It is often written as &quot;colesław&quot; or &quot;kolesław&quot; (), because of the similarity to many names ending with &quot;-sław&quot; (e.g. Bolesław).

In Eastern Slavic cultures (Russia, Ukraine and Belarus), a salad of fresh shredded cabbage mixed with carrots, apples, cranberries etc., is traditionally dressed with unrefined sunflower oil. The cabbage can be marinated before with vinegar producing &quot;cabbage provençal&quot; (). A similar salad is also made of sauerkraut.

In Sweden, a particular type of cabbage salad made with a seasoned vinaigrette is typically served with pizza and known as &quot;pizzasallad&quot; (pizza salad). When other vegetables are added, the recipe may be called &quot;råkostsallad&quot; (raw-food salad) or &quot;veckosallad&quot; (week salad), noting its long fridge-life. The term coleslaw (, or ) is reserved for cabbage salad with mayonnaise-based dressing and is typically seen as American cuisine.

In the United Kingdom, coleslaw often contains carrot and onion in addition to cabbage and is usually made with mayonnaise or salad cream. Some variations include grated cheese such as cheddar, nuts such as walnuts and dried fruits such as sultanas or raisins.

=== America ===
In the United States, coleslaw often contains buttermilk, mayonnaise or substitutes, and carrot. However, many regional variations exist, and recipes incorporating prepared mustard or vinegar without the dairy and mayonnaise are also common. Barbecue slaw, also known as red slaw, is made using ketchup and vinegar rather than mayonnaise. It is frequently served alongside North Carolina barbecue, including Lexington style barbecue, where, unlike in the rest of the state, a red slaw is the prevailing variety.

Hot slaw, which is flavored with jalapeño chilies and mustard, was named the first official state food of Tennessee in 2024.

=== Middle East ===
In Israel, a common coleslaw type consists of red cabbage and mayonnaise. It often includes salt, pepper, and lemon juice. The salad is often served as a topping option at food stands. It is also mass-produced and purchased in stores.

<text>Keratin 18 is a type I cytokeratin. It is, together with its filament partner keratin 8, perhaps the most commonly found products of the intermediate filament gene family. They are expressed in single layer epithelial tissues of the body. Mutations in this gene have been linked to cryptogenic cirrhosis. Two transcript variants encoding the same protein have been found for this gene.

Keratin 18 is often used together with keratin 8 and keratin 19 to differentiate cells of epithelial origin from hematopoietic cells in tests that enumerate circulating tumor cells in blood.

==Interactions==
Keratin 18 has been shown to interact with Collagen, type XVII, alpha 1, DNAJB6, Pinin and TRADD.

Keratin 17 is a type I cytokeratin. It is found in nail beds, hair follicles, sebaceous glands, and other epidermal appendages. Mutations in the gene encoding this protein lead to PC-K17 (previously known as Jackson-Lawler) type pachyonychia congenita and steatocystoma multiplex.

== Interactions ==

Keratin 17 has been shown to interact with CCDC85B.

<text>In Hamiltonian mechanics, a primary constraint is a relation between the coordinates and momenta that holds without using the equations of motion. A secondary constraint is one that is not primary—in other words it holds when the equations of motion are satisfied, but need not hold if they are not satisfied The secondary constraints arise from the condition that the primary constraints should be preserved in time. A few authors use more refined terminology, where the non-primary constraints are divided into secondary, tertiary, quaternary, etc. constraints. The secondary constraints arise directly from the condition that the primary constraints are preserved by time, the tertiary constraints arise from the condition that the secondary ones are also preserved by time, and so on. Primary and secondary constraints were introduced by Anderson and Bergmann and developed by Dirac.

The terminology of primary and secondary constraints is confusingly similar to that of first- and second-class constraints. These divisions are independent: both first- and second-class constraints can be either primary or secondary, so this gives altogether four different classes of constraints.

<text>Meeting of the minds (also referred to as mutual agreement, mutual assent, or consensus ad idem) is a phrase in contract law used to describe the intentions of the parties forming the contract. In particular, it refers to the situation where there is a common understanding in the formation of the contract. Formation of a contract is initiated with a proposal or offer. This condition or element is considered a requirement to the formation of a contract in some jurisdictions.

== History ==
Richard Austen-Baker has suggested that the perpetuation of the idea of &quot;meeting of minds&quot; may come from a misunderstanding of the Latin term &quot;consensus ad idem&quot;, which actually means &quot;agreement to the [same] thing&quot;. There must be evidence that the parties had each, from an objective perspective, engaged in conduct manifesting their , and a contract will be formed when the parties have met such a requirement.

==Concept in academic work==
German jurist Friedrich Carl von Savigny is usually credited with developing the will theory of contract in his work &quot;System des heutigen Römischen Rechts&quot; (1840).

Sir Frederick Pollock is one person known for expounding the idea of a contract based on a meeting of minds, at which time it gained much support in the courts.

Oliver Wendell Holmes wrote in 1897 that a meeting of minds was really a fiction.

The English contracts scholar Richard Austen-Baker has suggested that the perpetuation of the concept into current times is based on a confusion of it with the concept of a &quot;consensus ad idem&quot; (&quot;agreement to the same [thing]&quot;) which is an undoubted requirement of synallagmatic contracting, and that this confusion may be the result of recent ignorance of Latin.

==Use in case law==
In &quot;Household Fire and Carriage Accident Insurance Co Ltd v Grant&quot; (1879) 4 Ex D 216, Thesiger LJ said, in the course of a judgment on the postal rule,

In &quot;Carlill v Carbolic Smoke Ball Company&quot; [1893] 1 QB 256, Bowen LJ said,

In &quot;Balfour v Balfour&quot; [1919] 2 KB 571, Atkin LJ said,

In &quot;Baltimore &amp; Ohio R. Co. v. United States&quot; (1923) the US Supreme Court said an implied in fact contract is,

The reasoning is that a party should not be held to a contract that they were not even aware existed. A mutual promise between friends over simple personal matters should not be a situation where legal remedies are to be used. Equally, any such agreement where the obligation is primarily a moral one rather than a legal one should not be enforceable. It is only when all parties involved are aware of the formation of a &quot;legal obligation&quot; is there a meeting of the minds.

However, the awareness of a legal obligation is established, not through each party&#x27;s subjective understanding of the terms, but on &quot;objective indicators,&quot; based on what each party said and did.

Under the formalist theory of contract, every contract must have six elements: offer, acceptance, consideration, &quot;meeting of the minds&quot;, capacity and legality. Many other contracts, but not all types of contracts, also must be in writing and be signed by the responsible party, in an element called form. 

==Vices of consent==
Mutual assent is vitiated by actions such as fraud, undue influence, duress (see per minas), mutual mistake, or misrepresentation. This may render a contract void or unenforceable.

<text>Aleksei Yeliseyevich Kruchyonykh (; 9 February 1886 – 17 June 1968), also romanized Kruchenykh due to confusion about , was a Russian poet, artist, and theorist, perhaps one of the most radical poets of Russian Futurism, a movement that included Vladimir Mayakovsky, David Burliuk and others. Born in 1886, he lived in the time of the Russian Silver Age of literature, and together with Velimir Khlebnikov, another Russian Futurist, Kruchenykh is considered the inventor of &quot;zaum&quot;, a poetry style utilising nonsense words. Kruchonykh wrote the libretto for the Futurist opera &quot;Victory Over the Sun&quot;, with sets provided by Kazimir Malevich. In 1912, he wrote the poem &quot;Dyr bul shchyl&quot;; four years later, in 1916, he created his most famous book, &quot;Universal War&quot;.

He is also known for his &quot;Declaration of the Word as Such&quot; (1913): &quot;The worn-out, violated word &quot;lily&quot; is devoid of all expression. Therefore I call the lily &quot;éuy&quot; – and original purity is restored.&quot;

==Biography==
Kruchonykh was born on 21 February 1886, in the Kherson region of the Russian Empire; his parents were peasants. With the intention of becoming an artist, he went to Odessa Art School and the Moscow School of Painting, Sculpture and Architecture, publishing caricatures and occasionally exhibiting to make a living, but changed his mind in 1912 to be a poet instead.
Soon after he met the Burliuk brothers, he became a major poet of Cubo-Futurism, a style he helped to launch with his friends David Burliuk, Vladimir Mayakovsky, Mikhail Larionov, and others. He helped write the drafts for the most famous Cubo-Futurist manifesto, &quot;A Slap in the Face of Public Taste&quot;, published in 1912, notable for its statement to throw the writers of old &quot;off the steamboat of modernity&quot;. The first example of zaum poetry was by him; called &quot;Dyr bul shchyl&quot;, it was published in a 1913 book called &quot;Pomada&quot;. Together with Velemir Khlebnikov, he is considered inventor of this poetry style. Kruchenykh was also the first Russian poet to try writing a poem only using vowels. Soon he became one of the most prolific Cubo-Futurist writers, alongside Elena Guro, Khlebnikov, and others. The books were often lithographed by hand, illustrated by fellow Futurists, and titles included &quot;A Little Duck&#x27;s Nest of... Bad Words&quot;, &quot;Hermits: a Poem&quot;, &quot;Worldbackwards&quot;, and &quot;Explodity&quot;. They were also sometimes in collaboration with each other; for example, with Olga Rozanova, he invented the &quot;samopismo&quot;, a kind of Futurist book where text and images are literally connected.
He went to the house of the composer Mikhail Matyushin with Kazimir Malevich that summer (Khlebnikov was supposed to visit him too, but he lost the cheque to pay for his train ticket that Matyushin had sent him); they collaborated to write the Futurist opera &quot;Victory over the Sun&quot;, with music by Matyushin, prologue by Khlebnikov, libretto by Kruchenykh, and set designs by Malevich. This opera remains his most famous work; it is about a group of Futurists who capture the sun and defy gravity, much to the annoyance to everybody else. It premiered at the Luna Park Theatre at St. Petersburg, in a performance organised by the Union of the Youth. This play was written in a sort of zaum, the costumes were of cardboard, and a real aeroplane and aviator made an appearance; the audience booed throughout the show, and overall it caused great outrage. He, like his friends, also caused shock when he took to lecturing and poetry recitals, and on one occasion, he had to use his shoes to fight back the enraged audience from leaping up and attacking him. Another time, he spilled tea over many of the audience, an event which was probably intentional. &quot;Universal War&quot; was published in 1916; he illustrated it himself, with abstract collages. During the war he served as a technical draftsman.

Shortly after the October Revolution of 1917, he moved to Tiflis, Georgia, as part of a railway construction team; with his friend the Georgian Cubo-Futurist Ilia Zdanevich, who also happened to be in the country, they founded the avant-garde group 41° (the number refers to the temperature of a high fever). There, also, somebody founded an institute devoted to the study of his work and life so far, but this was probably just a joke. After Zdanevich left Georgia (first to Turkey, then to France), Kruchenykh returned to Russia in 1921, publishing more books, writing essays, and lecturing with friends; his views soon became so shocking the authorities decided to restrict his access to publishers, so he made his books himself. When the Soviets banned the avant-garde, he got a job as an archivist and gave up poetry. He also collected and sold rare books and manuscripts written by the people of his generation, eventually falling into obscurity with only occasional acknowledgment from the public. In 1932 he wrote his memoirs. He died of pneumonia in 1968.

==Legacy==

The Russian punk band Grazhdanskaya Oborona have a reggae-styled song called &quot;Posveshtenie A. Kruchyonykh&quot; (&quot;Homage to A. Kruchyonykh&quot;) on their 1990 concept album &quot;Instruktsiya po vyzhivaniyu&quot;.

<text>Werner Henke (13 May 1909 – 15 June 1944) was the commander of German submarine in the Battle of the Atlantic of World War II. &quot;U-515&quot; was sunk by the US task group 22.3, commanded by Daniel V. Gallery on 9 April 1944 and Henke was captured along with about 40 of his crew. He was shot and killed while attempting to escape from the POW interrogation center in Fort Hunt, Virginia in the United States.

==Early life and naval career==
Henke was raised in Rudak, a small village just outside Thorn. When Thorn became part of Poland in 1920, the Henke family moved to Celle in the Province of Hanover. Henke joined the &quot;Reichsmarine&quot; in April 1934 after several years in the merchant marine.

Henke attended the Naval Academy at Mürwik and served on the pocket battleship . In five years&#x27; training he spent only one week studying U-boat warfare. He spent nearly two years stationed at the Pillau (now Baltiysk) naval base starting in 1937. In May 1939 he was assigned to the battleship , where he participated in the first shots of World War II in the Battle of Westerplatte.

In April 1940, he commenced six weeks of training at the U-boat school at Neustadt in Holstein. Before completing this training however, he was convicted of desertion and sent to a punishment unit. In November, he was assigned to .

== &quot;U-515 &quot; ==
In November 1941, he was sent to submarine commander&#x27;s school, and on 21 February 1942 &quot;U-515&quot; was commissioned with Henke in command.

Henke was captured when &quot;U-515&quot; was sunk at 15:10 on 9 April 1944 in the mid-Atlantic north of Madeira at by bombs from the US escort carrier and depth charges from the destroyer escorts , , and . 40 survivors were taken on by the warships.

== Death ==
A British propaganda broadcast had accused Henke of shooting British survivors of , a passenger ship that &quot;U-515&quot; had sunk on 7 December 1942. Henke therefore believed the British wanted to try him as a war criminal. Knowing this, Captain Gallery, hoping to extort intelligence from him or his crew, threatened to turn him over to the British if he did not cooperate. Gallery was successful in getting Henke to sign a paper agreeing to cooperate with interrogators. Henke reneged on the agreement but upon seeing that their captain had agreed to talk, many of his crew signed similar agreements and did cooperate.

Henke was interned in the interrogation center known as P. O. Box 1142 in Fort Hunt, Virginia, where his interrogators threatened to hold him to his agreement to cooperate or be extradited to England to face war crimes charges. On 15 June 1944, he dashed to the fence of the interrogation center and began to climb over. He continued to climb after being ordered to stop and a guard shot him dead with a sub-machine gun.

== Aftermath ==

Henke was posthumously promoted to Korvettenkapitän and is interred at The Post Cemetery in Fort George G. Meade, Maryland, along with 32 other German POWs and 3 Italian POWs.

A ceremony is held at the gravesite every year on Volkstrauertag in November, the German equivalent of Memorial Day, at which the Naval attaché of the German embassy in Washington, DC, lays a wreath with a ribbon in the colors of the German flag in commemoration of all those buried at this gravesite. It is not uncommon to see flowers in front of the grave.

*Spanish Cross in Bronze (6 June 1939)
*Sudetenland Medal (23 October 1940)

<doc id="916433" wikidata="Q1991147" url="?curid=916433" title="Hot Bird">
<text>Hot Bird (also styled Hotbird) is a group of satellites operated by Eutelsat, located at 13°E over the equator (orbital position) and with a transmitting footprint over Asia, Europe, North Africa, Americas and the Middle East.

Only digital radio and television channels are transmitted by the Hot Bird constellation, both free-to-air and encrypted. In addition there are a few interactive and IP services. The satellites currently operate at 13° East and are numbered 13B, 13E and 13G. The satellites have been broadcasting digital-only since TV5Monde switched off its analogue signal in 2010.

== List of satellites ==
== Satellite details ==

=== Hot Bird 1 ===
Hot Bird 1 was launched by Ariane 44LP on 28 March 1995. The 13° east slot predates the launch, with Eutelsat I F-1 having been located there as early as 1983, and Eutelsat II F-1 having also served time at the location. It has reached end-of-life.

=== Hot Bird 3 ===
Hot Bird 3 was launched by Ariane 44LP on 2 September 1997 and intended to be moved to 10°E to become Eurobird 10. During the drift from 13°E to 10°E, the satellite suffered loss of power from one solar array. It was nevertheless successfully moved to 10°E, but could only operate at a reduced capacity. Since then, it is operating at 4°E under the name Eurobird 4. At last it was moved to 75°E and renamed to ABS_1B. It has reached end-of-life.

=== Hot Bird 4 ===
Hot Bird 4 was launched by Ariane 42P on 27 February 1998 and redeployed to 7°W in July 2006, becoming Atlantic Bird 4 / Nilesat 103.

=== Hot Bird 5 ===
Hot Bird 5 was launched by Atlas-2A on 9 October 1998 and re-located to 25.5°E and renamed Eurobird 2. Six transponders are leased to Arabsat under the name Badr 2, after having been called Arabsat 2D.

=== Hot Bird 6 (Hot Bird 13D) ===
Hot Bird 6 was launched by Atlas V 401 on 21 August 2002. Starting on 12 June 2009, the day of Iranian elections, deliberate interference affecting this satellite was traced to Iran. Hot Bird 6 is the primary carrier for BBC Persian Television. As of 2013, it was replaced by Hot Bird 10 (Hot Bird 13D).

=== Hot Bird 7/7A (Hot Bird 13E) ===
Hot Bird 7 was lost in December 2002 during the Ariane 5 ECA launch. Its replacement, Hot Bird 7A (a Spacebus 3000B3) was successfully launched on 11 March 2006. Hot Bird 7A was renamed Eurobird 9A in February 2009.

In December 2011 Eutelsat announced, that their satellite assets will be renamed under a unified brand name effective from March 2012. This satellite became Eutelsat 9A. In 2016 it was renamed Hot Bird 13E.

=== Hot Bird 8 (Hot Bird 13B) ===
Hot Bird 8 was launched by Proton on 5 August 2006. With a launch mass of 4.9 tonnes, Hot Bird 8 is the largest and the most powerful broadcast satellite serving Europe.

=== Hot Bird 9 (Hot Bird 13C) ===
Hot Bird 9 was launched by Ariane 5 ECA in December 2008. Its entry into service enabled the Hot Bird 7A satellite to be redeployed to 9° East and rebranded Eurobird 9A, increasing capacity to 38 transponders at this orbital position. From March 2012, Hot Bird 9 became Eutelsat Hot Bird 13C and during the second quarter of 2023 Hot Bird 13G replace Hot Bird 9 at Eutelsats&#x27;s 13° East position.

This satellite renamed Eutelsat 10A now is located at 10.5° East for occasional feeds, data or inactive frequency

=== Hot Bird 10 (Eutelsat 33E) ===
Hot Bird 10 was launched by Ariane 5 ECA in February 2009 with NSS-9, Spirale A and Spirale B. It was initially commissioned as Atlantic Bird 4A at 7°W. When Atlantic Bird 7 became operational, it was renamed Eutelsat 3C and was colocated with Eutelsat 3A at 3° East. Later it became Hot Bird 13D and in 2016 Eutelsat 33E. This satellite is located at 33° East.

=== Hot Bird 13F ===
Hot Bird 13F was launched by Falcon 9 Block 5 in October 2022. The launch mass of the satellite is 4,476 kg (9,868 lb). The satellite has been produced by Airbus Defence and Space and it&#x27;s based on Eurostar Neo bus. The satellite is designed to use PPS5000 plasma propulsion engine (developed by Safran and using xenon) to get to geostationary orbit.

=== Hot Bird 13G ===
Hot Bird 13G was launched by Falcon 9 Block 5 in November 2022. The satellite is very similar to Hot Bird 13F. Hot Bird 13G is active and replaces satellite 13C at orbital position 13°E.

<doc id="916439" wikidata="Q3062035" url="?curid=916439" title="Hair keratin">
<text>Hair keratin is a type of keratin found in hair and the nails.

== Function ==

Originating from the embryonic epidermis, the hair follicle evolves into one of the most complex structures in the human body, comprising 7–8 distinct tissue sections. The base of the hair follicle contains the bulb, housing dermal fibroblasts known as the dermal papilla, crucial for morphogenesis and the hair follicle&#x27;s cyclic activity. Encircling these cells is the matrix cell region, the hair follicle&#x27;s proliferative compartment, responsible for the formation of different follicle compartments (except the ORS) and the production of crucial structural elements of hair - hair keratins and associated proteins known as KAPs.

Keratin is a crucial fibrous protein found in animals, constituting tough structures like hair, feathers, nails, and horns. It&#x27;s classified based on tissue origin and sulfur content: soft keratins have lower sulfur, while hard keratins, found in hair and claws, contain more sulfur, creating a stronger structure. Keratins belong to two types - acidic Type I and neutral-basic Type II, further categorized into Type I a and b, and Type II a and b. The initial step in forming keratin is the alignment of type I and type II keratin polypeptides to create a heterodimer, which then aggregates into higher-order structural units. Similar to other intermediate filament subunit proteins, a prevalent secondary structure exists: a well-preserved, central alpha-helical domain made up of four coiled-coil segments along with non-helical end-terminal domains that vary in sequences and lengths [14]. Recent findings suggest that the interaction between acidic and basic soft keratins initiates with the creation of a heterodimer. This heterodimer comprises an acidic and a basic monomeric keratin. Two of these heterodimers then combine to form a tetramer, which subsequently polymerizes, resulting in the formation of the final 10-nanometer filamentous structure.

=== Stability ===
Due to their role as structural stabilizers in epithelial cells, keratin filaments have garnered significant interest across biology, embryology, pathology, and dermatology. This fundamental cytoskeletal function extends beyond individual cell levels. Typically, keratin filaments are integrated into desmosomes (see Fig. 1b, d) and hemidesmosomes, contributing not only to cell-to-cell stability but also to the attachment to the basement membrane and the connective tissue within a particular epithelium. In non-stratified (simple) epithelia of internal organs experiencing minimal mechanical stress, only a few keratin types form sparsely distributed filaments within the cytoplasm. However, a more substantial number of keratin types participate in the intermediate filament cytoskeletal framework of squamous epithelia, which becomes more prominent in cornified stratified epithelia like the epidermis covering the body&#x27;s outer surface. Here, keratins are abundant and densely packed, forming tonofilaments.

=== Wound Healing ===
Recent attention has been drawn to the remarkable wound-healing capabilities and excellent biocompatibility of keratin derived from human hair. While recombinant keratin proteins produced via recombinant DNA technology offer higher purity compared to extracted keratin, their wound-healing properties have remained unclear. Two recombinant trichocyte keratins—human type I hair keratin 37 and human type II hair keratin 81—were expressed using a bacterial expression system and subsequently forming recombinant keratin nanoparticles (RKNPs) through ultrasonic dispersion. It has been revealed that RKNPs significantly boosted cell proliferation and migration in laboratory settings. Moreover, when applied to dermal wounds in vivo, RKNPs facilitated improved wound healing, leading to enhanced epithelialization, vascularization, collagen deposition, and remodeling. Importantly, tests for in vivo biocompatibility showed no signs of systemic toxicity.  RKNPs have potential as a promising approach for advancing wound healing and suggests new avenues for developing keratin-based biomaterials.

=== Reduced Bleeding ===
In vivo haemostasis efficacy studies were conducted using rat models of liver puncture and femoral artery injury. For both models, K37 and K81 (10 mg) were applied to cover the wound areas. In the liver puncture model, bleeding time significantly decreased with recombinant K37 (approximately 38 s) and K81 (approximately 40 s) compared to the vehicle alone (approximately 170 s, p &lt; .01), with notably reduced total blood loss (p &lt; .01). Furthermore, in the femoral artery injury model, the recombinant keratin proteins significantly reduced bleeding time compared to the control group (approximately 50 s vs. 270 s). Notably, K37 and K81 exhibited stronger haemostatic effects than extracted keratins (approximately 80 s) in treating rat liver injury.  Additionally, the recombinant keratin proteins demonstrated a robust capacity to promote the formation of a fibrin clot at the injury site, effectively stopping the bleeding. Consequently, recombinant human hair keratins offer potential for developing novel haemostatic products based on keratin biomaterials.

== Types ==
There are two types of hair keratin:
* acidic &quot;type I hair keratin&quot; 
**type I hair keratin 1, 
**type I hair keratin 2, 
**type I hair keratin 3A, 
**type I hair keratin 3B, 
**type I hair keratin 4, 
**type I hair keratin 5, 
**type I hair keratin 6, 
**type I hair keratin 7, 
**type I hair keratin 8, 
* basic &quot;type II hair keratin&quot;
**type II hair keratin 1, 
**type II hair keratin 2, 
**type II hair keratin 3, 
**type II hair keratin 4, 
**type II hair keratin 5, 
**type II hair keratin 6, 

== Associated proteins ==

The hair shaft is majorly composed of hair keratins and their associated proteins (KRTAPs). KRTAPs are products of diverse gene families resulting from gene duplication events in their evolutionary history. These genes are typically small, comprising a single exon less than 1,000 base pairs long. Over the last decade, numerous KRTAP genes have been identified across mammals, including humans. They are categorized into three groups based on their amino acid composition: high sulfur (with &lt;30 mol% cysteine), ultrahigh sulfur (&gt;30 mol% cysteine), and high glycine/tyrosine. Hair keratins form intermediate filaments (KIFs) within trichocytes, specialized cells that contribute to hair formation. As these cells move upward in the cortex, KIFs aggregate, surrounded by a space called the matrix. KRTAPs, also known as KAPs, are a significant part of this matrix between KIFs. It&#x27;s suggested that KRTAPs play a role in establishing a cross-linked network with KIFs, contributing to the creation of the rigid hair shaft.

== Gene expression ==
During hair growth, as follicle bulb cells swiftly transform into cortical or cuticle hair keratinocytes, approximately 50-100 keratin genes become activated at the transcriptional level. However, this intricate process can be simplified into a few highly preserved gene families. In cortical keratinocytes, distinct patterns of keratin gene expression are evident, indicating the presence of different hierarchical transcription processes among various cell types. Examination of keratin gene promoter regions reveals conserved sequence motifs that might govern these cell-specific traits. Moreover, through the isolation of related sheep and human cuticle keratin genes, conserved DNA motifs and expression patterns during cuticle cell differentiation have been discovered. Further, the expression of sheep wool follicle IF and high-sulfur keratin genes in transgenic mice suggests that the regulatory DNA elements and proteins associated with hair keratin genes maintain functional conservation across mammalian species.

== Clinical significance ==

=== Breast cancer ===
Keratin constitutes a large multigene family known as cytokeratins. These cytokeratins are differentially expressed across various epithelial types and have been extensively studied as markers for breast cancer. They are categorized into acidic type I and basic-to-neutral type II cytokeratins. The intermediate filament network is formed by the necessary pairing of equal amounts of type I and type II keratins. While hair keratins, such as KRT81, are typical in hard-keratinized structures like hair and nails, they are thought to serve as structural proteins specific to these organs without expression elsewhere, such as the mammary gland.

KRT81, a type II hair keratin, is a major hair protein expressed in the hair cortex. Interestingly, despite being typically associated with hair structures, KRT81 expression has been observed in the SKBR3 human breast cancer cell line and metastatic lymph nodes of breast carcinomas, but not in normal breast epithelial cells. Moreover, the expressed KRT81 was found to be a 5′-truncated isoform (ΔHb1), with the full-length protein not being expressed. However, the exact function of this truncated form in breast cancer cells remains unclear.

Western blot analysis detected the presence of the complete 55-kDa KRT81 in various human breast cancer cell lines (MCF7, SKBR3, MDA-MB-231), normal human mammary epithelial cells (HMEC), and non-neoplastic cells (MCF10A). Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction confirmed the expression of the full-length KRT81, encompassing its 5&#x27; region, in breast cells. Immunohistochemical and immunofluorescence examinations located KRT81 within the cytoplasm. Additionally, in KRT81-knockdown MDA-MB231 cells, zymography illustrated decreased MMP9 activity, while scratch and invasion assays demonstrated diminished cell migration and invasion capabilities. This presents the first evidence of complete KRT81 expression in both normal breast epithelial cells and breast cancer cells. Furthermore, the findings suggest that KRT81 plays a role in the migration and invasion of breast cancer cells.

<text>Eutelsat S.A. is a French satellite operator. Providing coverage over the entire European continent, the Middle East, Africa, Asia and the Americas, it is the world&#x27;s third-largest satellite operator in terms of revenues.

Eutelsat&#x27;s satellites are used for broadcasting nearly 7,000 television stations, of which 1,400 are in high-definition television, and 1,100 radio stations to over 274 million cable and satellite homes. They also serve requirements for TV contribution services, corporate networks, mobile communications, Internet backbone connectivity and broadband access for terrestrial, maritime and in-flight applications. Eutelsat is headquartered in Paris, France. Eutelsat Communications Chief Executive Officer is currently Eva Berneke.

In October 2017, Eutelsat acquired Noorsat, one of the leading satellite service providers in the Middle East, from Bahrain&#x27;s Orbit Holding Group. Noorsat is the premier distributor of Eutelsat capacity in the Middle East, serving blue-chip customers and providing services for over 300 TV channels almost exclusively from Eutelsat&#x27;s market-leading the Middle East and North Africa neighbourhoods at 7/8° West and 25.5° East.

On 26 July 2022, Eutelsat announced a merger with LEO satellite internet operator OneWeb. When the merger was completed in September 2023, the company became a subsidiary of a new entity, &quot;Eutelsat Group&quot;.


== History ==
The European Telecommunications Satellite Organization (Eutelsat) was originally set up in 1977 (), by 17 European countries as an intergovernmental organisation (IGO). Its role was to develop and operate a satellite-based telecommunications infrastructure for Europe. The Convention establishing the European Telecommunications Satellite Organization Eutelsat was opened for signature in July 1982 and entered into force on 1 September 1985.

In 1982, Eutelsat decided to start operations of its first TV channel (Satellite Television) on the Orbital Test Satellite (OTS) in cooperation with European Space Agency (ESA). This was the first satellite-based direct-to-home TV channel launched in Europe. In 1983, Eutelsat launched its first satellite to be used for telecommunications and TV distribution

Initially established to address satellite telecommunications demand in Western Europe, Eutelsat rapidly developed its infrastructure to expand coverage to additional services (i.e. TV) and markets, such as Central and Eastern Europe in 1989, and the Middle East, the African continent, and large parts of Asia and the Americas from the 1990s.

Eutelsat was the first satellite operator in Europe to broadcast television channels direct-to-home. It developed its premium neighbourhood of five Hot Bird satellites in the mid-1990s to offer capacity that would be able to attract hundreds of channels to the same orbital location, appealing to wider audiences for consumer satellite TV.

With the general liberalisation of the telecommunications sector in Europe, Eutelsat&#x27;s assets, liabilities and operational activities were transferred to a private company called Eutelsat S.A. established for this purpose in July 2001. The structure role and activities of the new intergovernmental organisation Eutelsat IGO evolved. According to Eutelsat IGO&#x27;s amended constitution in 2016, the main purpose of Eutelsat IGO has been to ensure that Eutelsat S.A. observes the Basic Principles set forth in the Eutelsat Amended Convention entered into force in November 2002. These Basic Principles refer to public service/universal service obligations, pan European coverage by the satellite system, non-discrimination and fair competition. The Executive Secretary of Eutelsat IGO participates in all meetings of the Board of Directors of Eutelsat Communications S.A. and Eutelsat S.A. as an observer to the Board (&quot;censeur&quot;).

In April 2005, the principal shareholders of Eutelsat S.A. grouped their investment in a new entity (Eutelsat Communications), which is now the holding company of the Group owning 95.2% of Eutelsat S.A. on 6 October 2005. As of 2009, the holding company owned 96.0% of Eutelsat S.A.

On 31 July 2013, Eutelsat Communications announced the 100% acquisition of Satélites Mexicanos, S.A. de C.V. (&quot;Satmex&quot;) for US$831 million in cash plus the assumption of US$311 million in Satmex debt, pending government and regulatory approvals. The transaction was finalized on 2 January 2014. Based in Mexico, Satmex operates three satellites at contiguous positions, 113° West (Satmex 6), 114.9° West (Satmex 5) and 116.8° West (Satmex 8) that cover 90% of the population of the Americas.

In December 2015, the company announced a partnership with Facebook to launch an internet satellite over Africa by 2016 where Facebook lease all of a satellite&#x27;s high throughput Ka-band capacity, however, the satellite was destroyed during launch preparations.

In December 2020, Eutelsat launched Eutelsat Konnect, a domestic broadband service targeting remote localities, in the United Kingdom with a planned subsequent launch across Europe.

In July 2021, Eutelsat launched Eutelsat Quantum, the first full software-defined satellite. It will enable users, notably in the Government and Mobility markets, to actively define and shape performance and reach thanks to its software-based design.

In December 2021, Eva Berneke was appointed Chief Executive Officer to replace Rodolphe Belmer. She will take up her position on 1 January 2022.

In March 2022, in the context of the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine and growing censorship in Russia, two of the Russian packagers active on the 36°E Eutelsat satellites, NTV Plus (a subsidiary of Gazprom Media) and Trikolor, unilaterally interrupted broadcasting of 8 international news channels (BBC World, CNN, Deutsche Welle, Euronews, France 24, NHK World, RAInews 24, TV5 Monde). This interruption was denounced by the Denis Diderot Committee, made up of academics and professionals from the European audiovisual sector, which published a report and launched a petition asking for sanctions from the European Union and Eutelsat IGO against the two operators. The petition is signed by all members of the Ukrainian regulatory body, the National Radio and Television Council.

== Distribution of East European TV ==
Eutelsat continues to collaborate with Russian TV platforms such as NTV-Plus and Tricolor. In France, the association Denis Diderot Committee has started a petition to put pressure on the EU to get Eutelsat to drop cooperation with the Russian channels. In a press release, the association writes that it is &#x27;paradoxical and unforgivable&#x27; that European satellites are used to broadcast Russian channels, which &#x27;only spread the Kremlin&#x27;s official state propaganda.

As top manager of French Eutelsat, Danish Eva Berneke defended the strategy in a podcast interview with Techmediet Radar: &quot;It is clear that then we would have to wave goodbye to some Russian customers, who would then move on to some Russian satellites or something else&quot;. Media spokesman Kasper Sand Kjær of the Danish Social Democrats comments this decision with: &quot;I think everyone should decide for themselves which side you want to stand on in the story. I do not believe that one can get through the time we are in right now by saying that one is neutral&quot;.

Jim Phillipoff, co-founder of the Denis Diderot Committee explained further that Eutelat&#x27;s declared &quot;neutrality&quot; is rather dubious granted the fact that Eutelsat only offers channels on to Russian customers but not independent Russian-language broadcasts, which could help break information monopoly of the Russian state. As described above, Russian customers already actively censored western channels in their broadcasts on 36°E, which made the claims of Eutelsat&#x27;s neutrality even more absurd.

== Services ==
In June 2021, Eutelsat launched Eutelsat Advance, an end-to-end managed connectivity service, including network interconnection, a management portal and APIs for service providers and their clients. Available via Eutelsat&#x27;s certified network of partners, Eutelsat Advance enables service providers in Enterprise, Maritime, Aviation, Government and Telecoms to enhance their service portfolio by increasing the range of connectivity services they offer.

In September 2018, Eutelsat announced Cirrus, which enabled broadcasters to deliver content to satellite and over-the-top media service. Viewers can watch content on screens, phones and tablets, access multiple programmes, record and rewind and view detailed programme information.

With a global fleet of satellites and associated ground infrastructure, Eutelsat enables clients across Video, Data, Government, Fixed and Mobile Broadband markets to communicate effectively to their customers, irrespective of their location. Over 6800 television channels operated by leading media groups are broadcast by Eutelsat to one billion viewers across the world equipped for DTH reception or connected to terrestrial networks.

== Satellites ==
Eutelsat sells capacity on 36 satellites located in geosynchronous orbit between 139° West and 174° East. On 1 March 2012, Eutelsat changed the names of its satellites. The group&#x27;s satellites mostly take the Eutelsat name, with the relevant figure for their orbital position and a letter indicating their order of arrival at that position. On 21 May 2014, Eutelsat Americas (formerly Satmex) aligned its satellite names with the Eutelsat brand.

<text>Karen Cockburn (born October 2, 1980) is a Canadian trampoline gymnast. She won a bronze medal at the 2000 Summer Olympics in the individual event. She won a gold medal at the 2003 Trampoline World Championships in Hannover, Germany in the same event and a bronze in the team event. At the 2004 Summer Olympics and 2008 Summer Olympics, she won a silver medal in the individual event.

==Background==
Cockburn was born in Toronto and grew up in North York, Ontario. She began trampolining at age 11, and was a student at York University. She is a member of the Skyriders Trampoline Place and is coached by Dave Ross.

Following the Lake Placid and Quebec City World Cup competitions that took place in April 2007, the FIG World Rankings were updated. The women&#x27;s ranking saw four time World Champion and five time World Cup Final winner Irina Karavaeva of Russia retake top place from Cockburn in Women&#x27;s Individual Trampoline after Karavaeva won the gold medal at both of the World Cups. Cockburn and her partner, Rosannagh MacLennan, were ranked first in Women&#x27;s Synchronised Trampoline following their two winning performances in 2007.

==Career==
After winning the Canadian National Trampoline Championships seven years in a row, Cockburn made an error in her second routine (of three) and came in 6th place in the 2005 finals on June 1, 2005. She was beaten by her partner in synchronized trampoline, Rosannagh MacLennan. Later in June, she competed in the Trampoline World Cup and came in 3rd in the individual competition and won gold in synchronized trampoline with Rosannagh MacLennan. In September 2005 at the Trampoline World Championships in Eindhoven, Netherlands, the pair came 2nd in synchronized trampoline and Cockburn came 6th in the individual event.

In the 2006 Canadian National Trampoline championships in Quebec City, Cockburn regained her title beating MacLennan into second place, on May 20, 2006. On November 25, 2006, Cockburn won both the Individual gold medal and, with MacLennan, the synchronized gold medal at the Trampoline and Tumbling World Cup Final competition in Birmingham. In April 2007 at the Lake Placid Trampoline World Cup, the Cockburn and MacLennan achieved a new female synchronised trampoline routine world record for difficulty with a DD of 14.20.

At the 2007 Canadian Trampoline Championships in Regina, Saskatchewan, Cockburn took first place, edging out MacLennan by 2.5 points with a score of 106.90 in the Women&#x27;s Senior Individual trampoline category. In the category of synchronized trampoline, Cockburn and MacLennan won the gold with a score of 131.70.

On November 3, 2007, at the 2007 Trampoline World Championships in Quebec City, Cockburn and MacLennan won the synchronised event, maintaining their unbroken string of nine first-place finishes in World Cup and World Championships. In the individual final, Cockburn did not complete her routine and finished in 8th place. However, her and MacLennan&#x27;s rankings in the preliminary round earned two women&#x27;s places at the 2008 Olympic Games for Canada.

On June 7, 2008, Cockburn won her 10th Senior Women&#x27;s Trampoline Canadian Championship in Calgary, beating MacLennan into second place. Both women, however, with Jason Burnett were named to compete for Canada at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing.

Cockburn qualified for the finals in 4th place, and on August 18, 2008, she won a silver medal in the women&#x27;s final at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing. She was the only trampoline athlete to have won a medal at every Olympic Games at which the event has been competed until her 4th-place finish in the 2012 London Olympics. She was selected as Canada&#x27;s flag bearer for the closing ceremonies of the Beijing 2008 Olympics.

Following the 2008 Olympic Games, Cockburn did not compete again until the 2009 Canadian National Championships in Hamilton, Ontario. She came in second place after Rosannagh MacLennan. In the synchronised competition, she paired with MacLennan but they did not complete one routine and came in second place. She regained the Canadian National Championship in 2010 at Kamloops, British Columbia with MacLennan coming in 2nd place.

In the 2009 Trampoline World Championships in St Petersburg, Russia, Cockburn won the Bronze medal in Individual trampoline in her first international competition since the Beijing Olympics. She also won a silver medal in Synchronised Trampoline with her usual partner Rosannagh Maclennan.

In 2011, Cockburn did not compete in the Canadian National Championships and was sick for the Finals of the 2011 Pan American Games. In the 2011 Trampoline World Championships in Birmingham, England, Cockburn and MacLennan secured two places for Canadian women in the 2012 Summer Olympics and Cockburn won a Silver medal for the synchronised trampoline event (with MacLennan) and a Bronze medal for the Team competition.
In 2012, Cockburn finished in 4th place in the 2012 Summer Olympics&#x27;s individual trampoline.

In 2014, Cockburn resumed training after giving birth to a daughter in 2013. She is attempting to qualify for the 2015 Pan-American Games to be held in Toronto. She stated that she wanted to compete in a major international event before her hometown crowd before she retired. She competed in the 2014 Canadian National Champuionships in Ottawa and was third.
While training at the Trampoline World Championships in Daytona Beach, Florida, in November 2014, she landed badly and broke her ankle forcing her to withdraw from the competition.

Cockburn received the honour of being selected to pronounce the athletes&#x27; oath in front of her home crowd in Toronto during the opening ceremonies of the 2015 Pan-American Games. Competing at these games, she placed third in the women&#x27;s individual trampolining event.
On July 16, 2017, at the 2017 Canadian National Trampoline and Tumbling Championships, Karen Cockburn officially retired at a ceremony held to honour her contribution to the sport.

As of 2019 she was the National Team Director for Trampoline Gymnastics at Gymnastics Canada.

==Personal life==
&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2013, she gave birth to a daughter.

Her autobiography, called &quot;Karen Cockburn: Soaring High&quot;, was published in November 2007.

<doc id="916446" wikidata="Q5386427" url="?curid=916446" title="Eric Eldred">
<text>Eric Eldred (born 1943) is an American literacy advocate and the proprietor of the unincorporated Eldritch Press. Eldred was lead plaintiff in &quot;Eldred v. Ashcroft&quot;, a lawsuit that challenged the constitutionality of the Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act but lost in the U.S. Supreme Court in 2003 with the lawyer Lawrence Lessig. He co-founded Creative Commons and served on its board of directors.

Eric Eldred has been described as a former computer programmer and systems administrator, a Boston writer, and a New Hampshire-based technical analyst. He is an independent scholar and first published online all of Nathaniel Hawthorne&#x27;s works, as well as scanning many works for Project Gutenberg and others.

== Biography ==
Eldred grew up in Florida, graduated from Harvard University in 1966 (philosophy, general studies), and then became a conscientious objector during the Vietnam War. He was ordered to work for two years as alternative service, at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, where he was a respiratory therapist and a chief pulmonary technologist until 1987. After he bought an Apple II computer in 1980, he was active in Apple users&#x27; groups and went to Harvard Extension School (programming and technical writing, C.A.S. 1991). Then he worked as an engineer at Apollo Computer (later Hewlett-Packard), and Cahners Publishing as a technical analyst and computer magazine journalist, then for Wang Government Services as a senior Unix systems administrator, before becoming disabled from repetitive strain injury.

During 2004–05, he lived in an Internet Bookmobile traveling the U.S. visiting schools and libraries and special events to show readers how to print their own free books.

Eldred is divorced, with three (triplet) daughters.

== Eldritch Press ==
Eldritch Press is a website which republished the works of others in the public domain (no longer subject to copyright). For some years, Eldritch Press ran on a Linux server from Eldred&#x27;s home and is now hosted by Ibiblio and no longer maintained by him. Its principal feature was experimentation with HTML formats and the inclusion of graphics (while maintaining accessibility for blind readers) for online books that earlier had mostly been in ASCII format. Since the works, and Eldred&#x27;s derivative works based on them, are in the public domain, anyone can make use of them, host them, and create more works of their own without payment or credit.

In 2004, Eldred was denied a permit at Walden Pond State Reservation to print and give away free copies of &quot;Walden&quot; on the 150th anniversary of its publication. In 2005, Eldred returned with a permit, secured with the help of the Berkman Center for Internet and Society at Harvard Law School, to print and give away copies of the book, and to demonstrate to readers how to self-publish and regain control of their own culture.

== &quot;Eldred v. Ashcroft&quot; ==
In 1998, the Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act was passed, preventing Eldred&#x27;s plans to scan and publish works first published in the US after 1922. He later became the lead plaintiff in &quot;Eldred v. Ashcroft&quot;, a lawsuit that challenged the constitutionality of this act, but lost in the US Supreme Court in 2003.

<doc id="916454" wikidata="Q326009" url="?curid=916454" title="2000 Summer Olympics medal table">
<text>The 2000 Summer Olympics, officially known as the Games of the XXVII Olympiad, were a summer multi-sport event held in Sydney, New South Wales, Australia, from 15 September to 1 October 2000. A total of 10,651 athletes from 199 nations represented by National Olympic Committees (NOCs) (with four individual athletes from East Timor because the country had no NOC), including the Olympic debuts of Eritrea, Micronesia and Palau. The games featured 300 events in 28 sports across 39 disciplines, including the debuts of synchronized diving, taekowndo, triathlon, trampolining, women&#x27;s modern pentathlon and women&#x27;s weightlifting as official Olympic medal events.

Athletes from 80 countries won at least one medal, a new record, with 52 nations winning at least one gold medal. The United States won the most gold medals, with 37, and the most medals overall, with 93. It was the second consecutive Summer Olympic Games that the United States led the medal count in both gold and overall medals. Host nation Australia finished the Games with 58 medals overall (16 gold, 25 silver, and 17 bronze). Cameroon, Colombia, Latvia, Mozambique and Slovenia won a gold medal for the first time in their Olympic histories, while Vietnam, Barbados, Macedonia, Kuwait, Kyrgyzstan, and Saudi Arabia won their first ever Olympic medals. Among individual athletes, Australia&#x27;s Ian Thorpe, the Netherlands&#x27; Leontien van Moorsel and Inge de Bruijn and the United States&#x27; Jenny Thompson and Lenny Krayzelburg won the most gold medals at the games with three each and Russian tympanist Alexei Nemov won the most overall medals with six (two gold, one silver and three bronze).
==Medal table==
The medal table is based on information provided by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and is consistent with IOC conventional sorting in its published medal tables. The table uses the Olympic medal table sorting method. By default, the table is ordered by the number of gold medals the athletes from a nation have won, where a nation is an entity represented by a NOC. The number of silver medals is taken into consideration next and then the number of bronze medals. If teams are still tied, equal ranking is given and they are listed alphabetically by their IOC country code.

Events in boxing result in a bronze medal being awarded to each of the two competitors who lose their semi-final matches, as opposed to fighting in a third place tie breaker. Another combat sport, judo, uses a repechage system which also results in two bronze medals being awarded.

There were two ties for medals in athletics. No gold medal and two silver medals were awarded due to second-place ties in the women&#x27;s 100 metres while a tie for third place in the women&#x27;s high jump saw two bronze medals being awarded. In swimming events, there were two more ties for medals. There was a two-way tie for first place in the men&#x27;s 50 metre freestyle, which resulted in two gold medals and no silver medals being awarded. Two bronze medals were awarded in the women&#x27;s 100 metre freestyle due to a tie for third place.

<doc id="916456" wikidata="Q420682" url="?curid=916456" title="Guaifenesin">
<text>Guaifenesin, also known as glyceryl guaiacolate, is an expectorant medication taken by mouth and marketed as an aid to eliminate sputum from the respiratory tract. Chemically, it is an ether of guaiacol and glycerine. It may be used in combination with other medications. A 2014 study found that guaifenesin does not affect sputum volume in upper respiratory infections (the upper respiratory system includes most breathing parts &quot;above&quot; the lungs).
Side effects may include dizziness, sleepiness, skin rash, and nausea. While it has not been properly studied in pregnancy, it appears to be safe. It has been alleged to work in 2023 by making airway secretions more liquid, even as it has been demonstrated not to work.
Guaifenesin has been used medically since at least 1933. It is available as a generic medication and over-the-counter (OTC). In 2022, it was the 295th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 400,000 prescriptions. In 2022, the combination dextromethorphan/guaifenesin was the 290th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 400,000 prescriptions.

==Medical uses==
Guaifenesin is used to try to help with coughing up thick mucus. It is sometimes combined with the antitussive (cough suppressant) dextromethorphan, such as in Mucinex DM or Robitussin DM. It is also combined with ephedrine in Primatene and Bronkaid tablets for symptomatic relief of asthma. Guaifenesin is combined with phenylephrine and paracetamol in certain Lemsip formulations.

A Cochrane review identified three clinical trials assessing guaifenesin for the treatment of acute cough, with one finding significant benefit and the other two trials finding that it was not effective.

==Side effects==
Although generally well-tolerated, side effects of guaifenesin may include an allergic reaction (rare), nausea, vomiting, dizziness, or headache.

==Pharmacology==

===Mechanism of action===
Guaifenesin might act as an expectorant by increasing the volume and reducing the viscosity of secretions in the trachea and bronchi via stimulation of the gastric mucosa. This stimulation leads to an increased parasympathetic activity in the respiratory tract via the so-called gastro-pulmonary reflex, although some in vitro studies suggested that it might also act directly on the respiratory epithelium. This increase in volume and reduction in viscosity aids in the flow of respiratory tract secretions, allowing ciliary movement to carry the loosened secretions upward toward the pharynx. Thus, guaifenesin may increase the efficiency of the cough reflex and facilitate the removal of the secretions. Additionally, guaifenesin has a demonstrated central antitussive effect.

==History==
Similar medicines derived from the guaiac tree were used as a generic remedy by American indigenous peoples when explorers reached North America in the 16th century. The Spanish encountered guaiacum wood &quot;when they conquered Santo Domingo; it was soon brought back to Europe, where it acquired an immense reputation in the sixteenth century as a cure for syphilis and certain other diseases...&quot;

The 1955 edition of the &quot;Textbook of Pharmacognosy&quot; states: &quot;Guaiacum has a local stimulant action which is sometimes useful in sore throat. The resin is used in chronic gout and rheumatism, whilst the wood is an ingredient in the compound concentrated solution of sarsaparilla, which was formerly much used as an alternative in syphilis.&quot;

In the US, guaifenesin was first approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1952. Although previously deemed &quot;Generally Regarded as Safe&quot; in its original approval, the drug received a New Drug Application for the extended-release version, which received approval on 12 July 2002. Because of this, the FDA then issued letters to other manufacturers of &quot;timed-release&quot; guaifenesin to stop marketing their unapproved versions, leaving Adams Respiratory Therapeutics in control of the market. In 2007, Adams was acquired by Reckitt Benckiser. The drug is now sold over-the-counter by many companies, alone and in combination.

==Veterinary use==
Guaifenesin&#x27;s neurological properties first became known in the late 1940s. Guaifenesin is a centrally acting muscle relaxant used routinely in large-animal veterinary surgery. Guaifenesin is used in combination with, for example, ketamine, since guaifenesin does not provide analgesia or produce unconsciousness. In horses, the drug&#x27;s biological half-life is 77 minutes. Premedication with xylazine (1.1 mg/kg) can reduce the dose required from 163 mg/kg (in geldings) to just 88 mg/kg.

== Society and culture ==
=== Brand names ===
Guaifenesin is taken by mouth, and is supplied as a tablet, a capsule, an extended-release (long-acting) tablet, dissolving granules, and a syrup. It is available under many brand names, as either the sole active ingredient or part of a combination drug. Drugs combined with guaifenesin in over-the-counter preparations include the cough-suppressant dextromethorphan, analgesics such as paracetamol/acetaminophen, and decongestants such as ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, or phenylephrine.

=== Economics ===
In 2014, sales of guaifenesin were estimated to be approximately $135 million per year in the United States.

==Research==
===Guaifenesin in fibromyalgia===

In the 1990s, Paul St. Amand, M.D., suggested guaifenesin as part of a fibromyalgia treatment protocol. The results of a one-year 1996 randomized clinical trial did not support the hypothesis. As of 2015, the FDA had not approved guaifenesin as a drug treatment for the disorder. However, results of a 2017 multicenter, placebo-controlled, repeat-dose, parallel study of 77 randomly assigned adults, suggested potential for OTC dose of oral guaifenesin 1200 mg BID to provide symptomatic relief of upper back musculoskeletal pain and spasm.

<text>The Deepwater Navigation Course &quot;Danube – Black Sea&quot; is a deep-water canal in the Danube Delta that runs through the Danube Delta distributaries Chilia, Old Istambul and &quot;Bystroe&quot; or &quot;Bystre&quot;. Through most of its length it coincides with the Romania-Ukraine border that stretches along Danube. The canal is served by the Ukrainian state company Ukrainian Sea Ports Authority and its piloting services branch Delta Lotsman. A portion of the canal, Bystroe, which stretches through the territory of Ukraine rather than along the main course raised concerns in Romania which emphasized ecological issues as it stretches through the Ukrainian Biosphere Reserve &quot;Danube Delta&quot;.

==Description==
Originally the distributary (Bystroe or Bystre) of Danube Delta was among the main Soviet (and Soviet Ukraine) waterways until 1959, when its exploitation stopped due to silting that occurred after Romanian authorities on a political initiative created own Danube – Black Sea Canal away from the border with the Soviet Union.

After the Prorva distributary became silted in 1997, Ukraine was left without its own deep-water
canal between the Danube and the Black Sea. According to the Ukrainian NGO International Centre for Policy Studies, the use of Romanian Sulina distributary costs Ukraine ₴0.7-1.2 million annually.

There was a project proposed by Ukraine to reopen its navigation. According to official Ukrainian plans, it was to be completed in 2008. The intent was to provide a deep-water route from the Danube to the Black Sea under Ukrainian control, in order to reduce ship transit costs and provide an alternate route to Romania.

Initial dredging started in 2004 and the canal was declared open on May 10, 2007, for ships not exceeding 4.5 meters in draft. 

===Safety===
Along the whole course of the Ukrainian deepwater shipping course there established modern systems of navigation and shipping safety. Navigational equipment of the sea shipping courses corresponds to the system of the International Association of Marine Aids to Navigation and Lighthouse Authorities (IALA), region A; and the Basic provisions on navigation along Danube.

The shipping safety is provided by marine pilots and other piloting services of the Ukrainian state company Delta Lotsman. Navigational services are provided with modern specialized ships, GPS coastal stations, AIS coastal navigation as well as radar automated posts.

All objects are integrated into one regional system of ship traffic management &quot;Dunai&quot; which provides not only ship traffic safety, but also greatly improves efficiency of ship traffic. The traffic participants are presented with operational meteorological and hydrological information, traffic status information, factors that might complicate shipping, etc. According to the Ministerial order #132 of 24 May 2005 for navigation and hydrographic provision of Danube shipping safety is responsible the state company &quot;Derzhhidrohrafiya&quot;.

The pilot project provides a traffic speed limit of ships along the sea access canal and Bystroe distributary 7 knots. At the other sites of shipping course the speed is regulated by local rules of shipping. It is recommended to limit the approach of vessels to sea access canal at wind speeds of over 15 meters per second and a wave height of 2 meters.

==Dispute between Romania and Ukraine==

Ecologists, including the World Wildlife Fund, have raised significant concerns about damage to the Danube Delta ecosystem. An inquiry commission established under the auspices of the Convention on Environmental Impact Assessment in a Transboundary Context (of which Romania and Ukraine are both signatories) unanimously decided that the canal would have a significant adverse ecological impact.

In 2004 the European Commission issued a &quot;Statement on Opening of Bystroye Canal in Ukraine&quot; saying that &quot;The European Commission deeply regrets the reported opening to navigation of the initial part of the Bystroye canal between the River Danube and the Black Sea. The canal route goes through a specially protected UNESCO World Heritage area in the Danube Delta which is also subject to the international Ramsar Convention on the protection of wetlands.&quot; The Ukrainian NGO International Centre for Policy Studies also protested the decision of the Ukrainian government, writing that &quot;in its desire to get the canal as soon as possible, the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine did not pay proper attention to considering all the alternatives, and approved an unjustified decision that violates Ukraine’s environmental interests and will heap greater expenditures upon the budget than those intended to be reduced by the building of the canal&quot;.

After the apparent failure of diplomatic efforts, the government of Romania, where most of the Danube Delta lies, is reportedly considering building a 20 km canal that would absorb the Danube&#x27;s water upstream of Ukraine&#x27;s small piece of the river, in order to render the planned Bastroye Channel useless and thereby discourage Ukraine from attempting such a project. The Romanian canal would be designed so that it could be shut at any time, returning the river more or less to its current state.

The Danube Delta has been a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1991. The European Union has repeatedly asked Ukraine to halt the project, as have Romania and the United States. The Worldwide Fund for Nature has said the canal threatens the delta&#x27;s most important wetland, where 70 percent of the world&#x27;s white pelicans and 50 percent of pygmy cormorants live.

The official inauguration of the project was scheduled for Ukrainian Independence Day August 24, 2004, but was postponed until August 26. On August 24, around 140 non-profit organisations and trade unions submitted an open letter at the Ukrainian embassy in Bucharest, Romania saying the project may endanger more than 280 bird species and 45 freshwater fish species living in the delta. &quot;If Ukraine goes ahead with its plan ... the delta will become a fetid swamp,&quot; said a statement by one of the unions. On August 26 Ukraine officially inaugurated the project and the Romanian government announced plans to bring a lawsuit against Ukraine at The Hague-based International Court of Justice, invoking the Ramsar Convention on wetlands. 

In May 2005, parties of the Aarhus Convention agreed on political sanctions against Ukraine. Ukraine announced the temporary halt of the project in June, 2005.
In February 2006 &quot;The Conference for the Sustainable Development of the Danube Delta&quot; was held in Odesa with participation of Romania, Moldova and Ukraine and involved international organizations, work on the channel is still planned in accordance with international conventions.

In 2023, after 20 years of dispute, Romania and Ukraine reached an agreement according to which Romania would not object to Ukraine&#x27;s expansion of the canal as long as the project complied with environmental protection provisions.

<doc id="916486" wikidata="Q5687875" url="?curid=916486" title="Hazel Dickens">
<text>Hazel Jane Dickens (June 1, 1925 – April 22, 2011) was an American bluegrass singer, songwriter, double bassist and guitarist. Her music was characterized not only by her high, lonesome singing style, but also by her provocative pro-union, feminist songs. Cultural blogger John Pietaro noted that &quot;Dickens didn’t just sing the anthems of labor, she lived them and her place on many a picket line, staring down gunfire and goon squads, embedded her into the cause.&quot; &quot;The New York Times&quot; extolled her as &quot;a clarion-voiced advocate for coal miners and working people and a pioneer among women in bluegrass music.&quot; With Alice Gerrard, Dickens was one of the first women to record a bluegrass album. She was posthumously inducted into the International Bluegrass Music Hall of Fame alongside Gerrard in 2017.

==Career==
Hazel Dickens was born in Montcalm, West Virginia, on June 1, 1925, the eighth of eleven siblings in a mining family of 6 boys and 5 girls. Many of Hazel&#x27;s relatives were miners, including her brothers, cousins, and, eventually, her brothers-in-law. Her father worked as a minister at a Primitive Baptist church and played the banjo.

After Hazel&#x27;s oldest sister moved to Baltimore in the 1940s, Hazel and her parents decided to follow suit. They arrived in Baltimore in the 1950s at different times—Hazel earlier—where she got a job working in a factory. She met Mike Seeger, younger half-brother of Pete Seeger and founding member of the New Lost City Ramblers, through her brother Robert, who had met him at a TB (Tuberculosis) hospital where Seeger was working at the time. Dickens and Seeger became active in the Baltimore-Washington area bluegrass and folk music scene during the 1960s, playing in living rooms and later on in bars with Bob Baker&#x27;s bluegrass band as the area&#x27;s folk movement began to gain traction. The group played a mixture of traditional tunes Hazel had learned over the course of her childhood in Mercer County as well as contemporary bluegrass music popularized by groups such as The Stanley Brothers, Flatt &amp; Scruggs, and Bill Monroe. Dickens and Seeger left Baker&#x27;s group around 1958.

During this time she also established a collaborative relationship with Alice Gerrard, who married Mike Seeger in 1970, and as &quot;Hazel &amp; Alice&quot; recorded two albums for the Folkways label: &quot;Who&#x27;s That Knocking (And Other Bluegrass Country Music)&quot; (1965) and &quot;Won&#x27;t You Come &amp; Sing for Me&quot; (1973). Dickens and Gerrard were bluegrass bandleaders at a time when the vast majority of bluegrass bands were led by men. Together, they recorded two additional albums on Rounder Records, but Hazel &amp; Alice broke up in 1976 and Dickens pursued a solo career where her music and songwriting became more political.

Dickens used her music to try and make a difference in the lives of non-unionized mine workers and feminists. Dickens started to write more about the lives of miners and wrote a song titled &quot;Black Lung&quot; about her brother, Thurman, who died from the disease. She wrote a song titled &quot;Coal Mining Women&quot; about the hardships women faced in the coal mining world. In 1978, Dickens performed at the Vandalia Gathering in Charleston, West Virginia, both solo and then with the former coal-miner turned musician, Carl Rutherford. Dickens began to be seen as an activist and a voice for the working people.

She appeared in the Oscar-winning documentary &quot;Harlan County, USA,&quot; which centers on the struggle of the county&#x27;s miners union against scab workers, wage rights, and health conditions; she contributed four songs to the film&#x27;s soundtrack. She also appeared in the films &quot;Matewan&quot; and &quot;Songcatcher&quot;.

==Death==
In 2011, Dickens died in a Washington, D.C. hospice from complications of pneumonia. She was buried in Princeton, West Virginia at Roselawn Memorial Gardens. After her death, it was incorrectly reported in major media that she had been born on June 1, 1935, but her relatives and public records confirmed the earlier date of June 1, 1925.

Stating that &quot;music saves mountains&quot;, fans and supporters of Dickens&#x27;s activism announced a special memorial, &quot;Tribute to West Virginia Music Legend Hazel Dickens&quot; at the Charleston, West Virginia, Cultural Center on June 5, 2011.

<doc id="916492" wikidata="Q752843" url="?curid=916492" title="Borland Kylix">
<text>Borland Kylix is a compiler and integrated development environment (IDE) formerly sold by Borland, but later discontinued. It is a Linux software development environment based on Borland Delphi and Borland C++ Builder, which runs under Microsoft Windows. Continuing Delphi&#x27;s classical Greek theme, Kylix is the name for an ancient Greek drinking cup. The closest supported equivalent to Kylix is the free Lazarus IDE package, designed to be code-compatible with Delphi. As of 2010 the project has been resurrected in the form of Delphi cross compiler for Mac and Linux, as shown in the Embarcadero&#x27;s Delphi and C++ Builder roadmap. As of September 2011 with Kylix discontinued the framework for cross-platform development by Embarcadero is FireMonkey.

==Features==
Kylix supports application programming using Object Pascal and C++, and is particularly suited to the development of command line utilities and (especially) GUI applications, but not well suited to low-level programming, such as the development of device drivers or kernel modules.

Though it interacts poorly with many Linux window managers, the IDE is basically the Delphi 5 IDE running on top of Wine, with a fast native code compiler, and tools for code navigation, auto-completion, parameter-name tooltips, and so on. The debugger is capable, but very slow to load, and can crash the whole IDE.

Kylix features CLX, a Linux version of Borland&#x27;s VCL [Visual Component Library], which is (mostly) a component-based control library, not unlike Visual Basic or .NET&#x27;s WinForms. Like other component-oriented libraries, CLX contains both visual components (such as buttons and panels) and non-visual components (such as timers). The IDE makes it easy to select components and place them on a form, editing properties and event handlers with an &quot;Object Inspector&quot;.

Delphi&#x27;s VCL is an object-oriented wrapper over raw Win32 controls, that maps Win32 messages and APIs to properties and events and is thus significantly easier to use than the raw API. As such, VCL is tightly bound to Windows, and Kylix&#x27;s CLX is built on top of Trolltech&#x27;s Qt library. CLX is not 100% compatible with VCL, and most Delphi programs require some effort to port to Kylix, even if they stick to the Borland libraries and avoid any direct OS calls. However, Qt is a portable library and, starting with Delphi 6, Borland provided CLX on Windows as well, providing a measure of back-portability.

==History==
On September 28, 1999, Inprise Corporation announced its development of a high performance Linux application development environment that will support C, C++, and Delphi development, code named &quot;Kylix&quot;, with release date set for year 2000.

On March 24, 2000, Inprise/Borland Corporation hosted more than 200 third-party authors, consultants, trainers and tool and component vendors for the first in a series of worldwide events designed to prepare third party products and services for Kylix.

On March 7, 2001, Borland Software Corporation announced the release of Borland Kylix, after it had been offered to U.S. customers of Dell Precision 220, 420 and 620 Workstations beginning in February 2001.

On October 23, 2001, Borland Software Corporation announced the release of Borland Kylix 2.

On August 13, 2002 Borland Software Corporation announced the release of Borland Kylix 3.

In 2005, Borland reportedly moved to discontinue Kylix development.

Danny Thorpe seems to have been largely responsible for getting Borland to fund a Linux version of Delphi, and he did a lot of the work necessary to make the Delphi compiler produce Linux executables. While both Delphi and Kylix run on 32-bit Intel processors, Linux uses different register conventions than Windows and, of course, the executable and library file formats are different; see DLL, EXE, ELF for details.

==Legacy==
In 2009 Embarcadero posted the current Delphi and C++ Builder roadmap. As part of project Delphi &quot;X&quot; cross compilation for Mac and Linux was planned.

Embarcadero is planning to release a new version of Kylix (without backward compatibility), but it will not hold a special name (Kylix). It will be a part of Delphi (and C++Builder) where one can code and compile in Delphi Windows IDE and deploy to Linux. C++Builder version will be also available.

This roadmap item remained a couple versions on the roadmap as point for &quot;future versions&quot; but disappeared from roadmaps in the XE3-4 timeframe. Parts of project X went in production with XE2 and 3 though, but for mobile targets and OS X.

In 8 Feb 2016, Embarcadero Technologies, Inc. announced an updated roadmap that indicates Linux server support in upcoming RAD Studio 10.2 (code name &quot;Godzilla&quot;) development track, aka the Fall release. Linux desktop support was not mentioned. On March 22, 2017, Embarcadero Technologies, Inc. announced the release of RAD Studio 10.2.

<doc id="916495" wikidata="Q2750567" url="?curid=916495" title="Cytokeratin">
<text>Cytokeratins are keratin proteins found in the intracytoplasmic cytoskeleton of epithelial tissue. They are an important component of intermediate filaments, which help cells resist mechanical stress. Expression of these cytokeratins within epithelial cells is largely specific to particular organs or tissues. Thus they are used clinically to identify the cell of origin of various human tumors.

==Naming==
The term &quot;cytokeratin&quot; began to be used in the late 1970s, when the protein subunits of keratin intermediate filaments inside cells were first being identified and characterized. In 2006 a new systematic nomenclature for mammalian keratins was created, and the proteins previously called &quot;cytokeratins&quot; are simply called &quot;keratins&quot; (human epithelial category). For example, cytokeratin-4 (CK-4) has been renamed keratin-4 (K4). However, they are still commonly referred to as cytokeratins in clinical practice.

==Types==

There are two categories of cytokeratins: the acidic type I cytokeratins and the basic or neutral type II cytokeratins. Within each category, cytokeratins are numbered in order of decreasing size, from high molecular weight (HMWCKs) to low molecular weight (LMWCKs). Cytokeratins are usually found in heterodimeric pairs of acidic and basic subunits of similar size.

Expression of these cytokeratins is largely organ or tissue specific. The subsets of cytokeratins which an epithelial cell expresses depends mainly on the type of epithelium, the moment in the course of terminal differentiation and the stage of development. Thus a specific cytokeratin expression profile allows the identification of epithelial cells. Furthermore, this applies also to the malignant counterparts of the epithelia, (carcinomas), as the cytokeratin profile is generally retained. Thus the study of cytokeratin expression by immunohistochemistry techniques is a tool of immense value widely used for tumor diagnosis and characterization in surgical pathology.

==Molecular biology==
The cytokeratins are encoded by a family encompassing 30 genes. Among them, 20 are epithelial genes and the remaining 10 are specific for trichocytes.

All cytokeratin chains are composed of a central α-helix-rich domain (with a 50 to 90% sequence identity among cytokeratins of the same type and around 30% between cytokeratins of different type) with non-α-helical N- and C-terminal domains. The α-helical domain has 310-150 amino acids and comprises four segments in which a seven-residue pattern repeats. Into this repeated pattern, the first and fourth residues are hydrophobic and the charged residues show alternate positive and negative polarity, resulting in the polar residues being located on one side of the helix. This central domain of the chain provides the molecular alignment in the keratin structure and makes the chains form coiled dimers in solution.

The end-domain sequences of type I and II cytokeratin chains contain in both sides of the rod domain the subdomains V1 and V2, which have variable size and sequence. The type II also presents the conserved subdomains H1 and H2, encompassing 36 and 20 residues respectively. The subdomains V1 and V2 contain residues enriched by glycines and/or serines, the former providing the cytokeratin chain a strong insoluble character and facilitating the interaction with other molecules. These terminal domains are also important in defining the function of the cytokeratin chain characteristic of a particular epithelial cell type.

Two dimers of cytokeratin group into a keratin tetramer by anti-parallel binding. This cytokeratin tetramer is considered to be the main building block of the cytokeratin chain. By head-to-tail linking of the cytokeratin tetramers, the protofilaments are originated, which in turn intertwine in pairs to form protofibrils. Four protofibrils give place to one cytokeratin filament.

==Cell biology==
In the cytoplasm, keratin filaments associate laterally with each other to create bundles of ~50 nm radius. The radius of these bundles is set by the interplay between long range electrostatic repulsion and short range hydrophobic attraction. These keratin bundles span a complex network which extends from the surface of the nucleus to the cell membrane. Numerous accessory proteins are involved in the genesis and maintenance of such structure.

This association between the plasma membrane and the nuclear surface provides important implications for the organization of the cytoplasm and cellular communication mechanisms. Apart from the relatively static functions provided in terms of supporting the nucleus and providing tensile strength to the cell, the cytokeratin networks undergo rapid phosphate exchanges mediated depolymerization, with important implications in the more dynamic cellular processes such as mitosis and post-mitotic period, cell movement and differentiation.

Cytokeratins interact with desmosomes and hemidesmosomes, thus collaborating to cell–cell adhesion and basal cell–underlying connective tissue connection.

The intermediate filaments of the eukaryotic cytoskeleton, which the cytokeratins are one of its three components, have been probed to associate also with the ankyrin and spectrin complex protein network that underlies the cell membrane.

<text>He Ying (, born April 17, 1977, in Jilin) is an archer from the People&#x27;s Republic of China who has competed at three Summer Olympics.

==Career==

===1996 Summer Olympics===

In 1996 Atlanta Olympics He won the silver in the women&#x27;s individual event. She competed again in 2000 in Sydney but did not win a medal.

===2004 Summer Olympics===
He achieved the second Olympic silver medal of her career at the 2004 Summer Olympics in the team event. With teammates Lin Sang and Zhang Juanjuan, He defeated Australia, Ukraine and Chinese Taipei in the elimination rounds before falling to South Korea in the gold medal match by a single match.

He placed 4th in the individual ranking round with a score of 667. He went on to defeat Helen Palmer of Great Britain, Melissa Jennison of Australia and Kirstin Jean Lewis of South Africa in the first three rounds, her encounter with Jennison going to a final arrow shoot-off.

In the quarterfinals, He faced eventual bronze medalist Alison Williamson of Great Britain. He was red carded for shooting out of turn, resulting in her highest scoring shot being declared void. She later missed the target entirely with her 10th shot, Williamson winning by a score of 109–89. The Chinese team officials planned to appeal against the result but failed to do so within the allowed time. Her final ranking in the individual competition was 8th.

<doc id="916502" wikidata="Q6495369" url="?curid=916502" title="Late binding">
<text>In computing, late binding or dynamic linkage—though not an identical process to dynamically linking imported code libraries—is a computer programming mechanism in which the method being called upon an object, or the function being called with arguments, is looked up by name at runtime. In other words, a name is associated with a particular operation or object at runtime, rather than during compilation. The name dynamic binding is sometimes used, but is more commonly used to refer to dynamic scope.

With early binding, or static binding, in an object-oriented language, the compilation phase fixes all types of variables and expressions. This is usually stored in the compiled program as an offset in a virtual method table (&quot;v-table&quot;). In contrast, with late binding, the compiler does not read enough information to verify the method exists or bind its slot on the v-table. Instead, the method is looked up by name at runtime.

The primary advantage of using late binding in Component Object Model (COM) programming is that it does not require the compiler to reference the libraries that contain the object at compile time. This makes the compilation process more resistant to version conflicts, in which the class&#x27;s v-table may be accidentally modified. (This is not a concern in just-in-time compiled platforms such as .NET or Java, because the v-table is created at runtime by the virtual machine against the libraries as they are being loaded into the running application.)

==History==
The term &quot;late binding&quot; dates back to at least the 1960s, where it can be found in &quot;Communications of the ACM&quot;. The term was widely used to describe calling conventions in languages like Lisp, though usually with negative connotations about performance.

In the 1980s Smalltalk popularized object-oriented programming (OOP) and with it late binding. Alan Kay once said, &quot;OOP to me means only messaging, local retention, and protection and hiding of state-process, and extreme late-binding of all things. It can be done in Smalltalk and in LISP. There are possibly other systems in which this is possible, but I&#x27;m not aware of them.&quot;

In the early to mid-1990s, Microsoft heavily promoted its COM standard as a binary interface between different OOP programming languages. COM programming equally promoted early and late binding, with many languages supporting both at the syntax level.

In 2000, Alex Martelli coined the term &quot;duck typing&quot; to refer to a similar concept, but with a different emphasis. While late binding generally focuses on implementation details, duck typing focuses on the ability to ignore types and concentrate on the methods an object currently has.

==Late binding implementations==
===Late binding in dynamically-typed object-oriented languages===
In most dynamically-typed languages, the list of methods on an object can be altered at runtime. This requires late binding.

===Late binding in Lisp===
In Lisp, late bound global function calls are efficiently looked up at runtime via a symbol&#x27;s function cell. These function bindings are mutable.

Example using an interactive Clozure Common Lisp session:
? (defun foo ()
 (bar pi)) ; a still undefined function BAR gets called
;Compiler warnings :
; In FOO: Undefined function BAR
FOO

? (defun bar (x) ; now we define it
 (* x 2))
BAR

? (foo) ; calling foo and it uses the recent definition of BAR
6.283185307179586D0

? (defun bar (x) ; now we redefine BAR
 (* x 1000))
BAR

? (foo) ; FOO now calls the new function, there is no need to recompile/link/load FOO
3141.592653589793D0

? (type-of &#x27;bar) ; BAR is a symbol
SYMBOL

? (symbol-function &#x27;bar) ; the symbol BAR has a function binding
#&lt;Compiled-function BAR #x302000D1B21F&gt;

===Late binding in C++===
In C++, late binding (also called &quot;dynamic binding&quot;) refers to what normally happens when the codice_1 keyword is used in a method&#x27;s declaration. C++ then creates a so-called virtual table, which is a look-up table for such functions that will always be consulted when they are called.

===Late binding in COM languages===
In COM programming a late-bound method call is performed using the IDispatch interface. Some COM-based languages such as Visual Basic 6 have syntactical support for calling this interface. This is done by defining the variable&#x27;s type as Object. Others such as C++ require that you explicitly call GetIDsOfNames to look up a method and Invoke to call it.

===Late binding in .NET===
In .NET, late binding refers to overriding a codice_1 method like C++ or implementing an interface. The compiler builds virtual tables for every virtual or interface method call which is used at run-time to determine the implementation to execute.

Also like COM and Java, the Common Language Runtime provides reflection APIs that can make late binding calls. The use of these calls varies by language.

With C# 4, the language also added the &quot;dynamic&quot; pseudo-type. This would be used in place of the Object type to indicate that late binding is desired. The specific late binding mechanism needed is determined at runtime using the Dynamic Language Runtime as a starting point.

Visual Basic uses them whenever the variable is of type Object and the compiler directive &quot;Option Strict Off&quot; is in force. This is the default setting for a new VB project. Prior to version 9, only .NET and COM objects could be late bound. With VB 10, this has been extended to DLR-based objects.

===Late binding in Java===
There are three definitions for late binding in Java.

Early documents on Java discussed how classes were not linked together at compile time. While types are statically checked at compile time, different implementations for classes could be swapped out just prior to runtime simply by overwriting the class file. As long as the new class definition had the same class and method names, the code would still work. In this sense it is similar to the traditional definition of late binding.

Currently, it is popular to use the term late binding in Java programming as a synonym for dynamic dispatch. Specifically, this refers to Java&#x27;s single dispatch mechanism used with virtual methods.

Finally, Java can use late binding using its reflection APIs and type introspection much in the same way it is done in COM and .NET programming. Generally speaking those who only program in Java do not call this late binding. Likewise the use of &quot;duck typing&quot; techniques is frowned upon in Java programming, with abstract interfaces used instead.

Oracle, the current owner of Java, has been known to use the term late binding in the &quot;duck typing&quot; sense when discussing both Java and other languages in the same documentation.

===Early vs. late binding in PL/SQL and Ada===
When using early binding between Ada and a database-stored procedure, a timestamp is checked to verify that the stored procedure has not changed since the code was compiled. This allows for faster executions and prevents the application from running against the wrong version of a stored procedure.

When using late binding the timestamp check is not performed, and the stored procedure is executed via an anonymous PL/SQL block. While this can be slower, it removes the need to recompile all of the client applications when a stored procedure changes.

This distinction appears to be unique to PL/SQL and Ada. Other languages that can call PL/SQL procedures, as well as other database engines, only use late binding.

==Criticism==
Late binding has poorer performance than an early bound method call. Under most implementations, the correct method address must be looked up by name with each call, requiring relatively expensive dictionary search and possibly overload resolution logic. In most applications, the extra compute and time required is negligible on modern computers.

For some compilers, late binding may prevent the use of static type checking. When making a late bound call, the compiler has to assume that the method exists. This means a simple spelling error can cause a run-time error to be thrown. Modern compilers avoid this by ensuring that every possible call must have an implementation during compilation.

Late binding may prevent forms of static analysis needed by an integrated development environment (IDE). For example, an IDE&#x27;s &quot;go to definition&quot; feature may not function on a late-bound call, if the IDE has no way to know which class the call may refer to. A modern IDE easily solves this especially for object-oriented languages since a late-bound method always specifies an interface or base class, which is where &quot;go to definition&quot; leads, and &quot;find all references&quot; can be used to find all implementations or overrides.

<text>Evangelia Psarra (; born 17 June 1974 in Thessaloniki) is a Greek archer who has competed at the Summer Olympics six times from 2000 to 2020.

==Career==
At the 2004 Summer Olympics, Psarra entered the women&#x27;s competition as Greece&#x27;s best hope for a medal having finished eighteenth overall at the 2003 World Archery Championships. She placed 8th in the women&#x27;s individual ranking round with a 72-arrow score of 652. In the first round of elimination, she faced 57th-ranked Jo-Ann Galbraith of Australia. Psarra defeated Galbraith 138-116 in the 18-arrow match to advance to the round of 32. In that round, she faced 25th-ranked Turkish archer Zekiye Keskin Satir, defeating her 163-161. Psarra then defeated 24th-ranked Almudena Gallardo of Spain 160-152, advancing to the quarterfinals, where she faced Park Sung-hyun of Korea. A poor shot with her first arrow however led to defeat against the South Korean, though Psarra said she did not feel disappointed with the result. The final score of 111-101 in the 12 arrow match placed Psarra 7th overall in women&#x27;s individual archery. Psarra was also a member of the 5th-place Greek team in the women&#x27;s team archery competition.

At the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, Psarra finished her ranking round with a total of 613 points. This gave her the 50th seed for the final competition bracket in which she faced Chen Ling in the first round. The local Chinese favourite archer won the confrontation with 110-101 and eliminated Psarra straight away.

Psarra lost to Bombayla Devi Laishram of India in the first knockout round at the 2012 Summer Olympics.

===2016: Fifth Olympics===
Psarra narrowly missed qualifying for the 2016 Summer Olympics at the Final Qualification Tournament in Antalya in June 2016, which allocated the remaining six positions available for the women&#x27;s individual event. She and Spain&#x27;s Adriana Martín both suffered defeats at the tournament&#x27;s quarter-final stage, but because Martín&#x27;s total match score of 128 points exceeded Psarra&#x27;s own score of 126, the Spaniard claimed the final qualification position on countback. The withdrawal of an archer from Côte d&#x27;Ivoire in July however led to a vacant position, which was assigned to Greece as the highest ranked nation without an Olympic berth. The Greek National Olympic Committee subsequently nominated the 42-year-old Psarra for her fifth Olympic Games.

Psarra entered Rio de Janeiro as the most experienced Olympian in the field, finishing the ranking round in fifty-fifth place. She was eliminated in the first round for her third Olympic Games in a row, losing to Japan&#x27;s Kaori Kawanaka by seven set points to three. Following the Olympics, Psarra was one of four archers to donate apparel and equipment used in Rio de Janeiro to the Olympic Museum in Lausanne.

<doc id="916521" wikidata="Q1984414" url="?curid=916521" title="Ngāti Porou">
<text>Ngāti Porou is a Māori iwi traditionally located in the East Cape and Gisborne regions of the North Island of New Zealand. It has the second-largest affiliation of any iwi, behind Ngāpuhi, with an estimated 92,349 people according to the 2018 census. The traditional rohe or tribal area of Ngāti Porou extends from Pōtikirua and Lottin Point in the north to Te Toka-a-Taiau (a rock that used to sit in the mouth of Gisborne harbour) in the south. The Ngāti Porou iwi comprises 58 hapū (sub-tribes) and 48 mārae (meeting grounds).

Mount Hikurangi features prominently in Ngāti Porou traditions as a symbol of endurance and strength, and holds tapu status. In these traditions, Hikurangi is often personified. Ngāti Porou traditions indicate that Hikurangi was the first point to surface when Māui fished up the North Island from beneath the ocean. His canoe, the &quot;Nuku-tai-memeha&quot;, is said to have been wrecked there. The Waiapu River also features in Ngāti Porou traditions.

==History==

===Pre-European history===

Ngāti Porou takes its name from the ancestor Porourangi, also known as Porou Ariki. He was a direct descendant of Toi-kai-rākau, Māui (accredited in oral tradition with raising the North Island from the sea), and Paikea the whale rider.

Although Ngāti Porou claim the &quot;Nukutaimemeha&quot; as their foundation canoe, many Ngāti Porou ancestors arrived on different canoes, including &quot;Horouta&quot;, &quot;Tākitimu&quot; and &quot;Tereanini&quot;. The descendants of Porourangi and Toi formed groups that spread across the East Cape through conquest and through strategic marriage alliances.

Genealogical associations with other iwi also arise through direct descent from Ngāti Porou ancestors:
* Kahungunu, descending from Ueroa (the second son of Porourangi), is the founding ancestor of Ngāti Kahungunu.
* Taua, descended from Kahungunu, is a prominent ancestor in Te Whānau-ā-Apanui genealogy.
* Ngāti Raukawa and the Tainui iwi have association through Porourangi&#x27;s daughter Rongomaianiwaniwa and through the marriage of the ancestress Māhinaarangi to Tūrongo.
* Tahupōtiki, younger-brother to the Porourangi, is Ngāi Tahu&#x27;s founding ancestor.

===Colonial history===
Ngāti Porou sustained heavy losses over the course of the Musket Wars, a period of heightened warfare between iwi unleashed by the adoption of firearms and resulting power imbalances. The iwi&#x27;s first experience of musket warfare came in 1819, when a raid by Ngāpuhi rangatira Te Morenga led to the capture and killing of many members, including two rangatira. That same year a second attack by Hongi Hika of Ngāpuhi and Te Haupa of Ngāti Maru targeted the iwi’s pā at Wharekahika Bay, but Te Haupa was slain and the raid was repelled at the cost of heavy casualties. Heavy defeats came at the hands of a raiding party led by the Ngāpuhi rangatira Pōmare I and Te Wera Hauraki, who through force and guile sacked the pā of Okauwharetoa and Te Whetumatarau near Te Araroa. Te Wera Hauraki’s forces would then move on to sack additional pā in the area of Waiapu River and Whareponga Bay. A final defeat at the hands of Ngāpuhi took place in 1823, when a preemptive attack by a large army of Ngāti Porou warriors on Pōmare’s trespassing forces in Te Araroa was cut down in open field by musket fire. The rangatira Taotaoriri was then able to negotiate a favorable peace between the two iwi, a deal sealed by his marriage to the Ngāti Porou noblewoman Hikupoto and the return of Rangi-i-paea, who had been abducted and married to Pōmare in a previous raid. This peace was to have important religious consequences, as a number of Ngāti Porou rangatira freed by Ngāpuhi in later negotiations would go on to spread the Christianity they had adopted from European missionaries during the course of their captivity.

A second wave of violence rocked Ngāti Porou starting in 1829, when the presence of Ngāti Porou passengers on the ship where the Ngāti Awa rangatira Ngarara was assassinated by Ngāpuhi marked the iwi as a target for retribution. Minor raids by Ngāti Awa and their allies Whakatōhea and Te Whānau-ā-Apanui in 1829 and 1831 resulted in the deaths of some Ngāti Porou, which triggered retaliatory action from the iwi. In 1832 Ngāti Porou joined forces with Ngāpuhi, Rongowhakaata, and Te Aitanga-a-Māhaki to seize Kekeparaoa pā and expel the four hundred Whakatōhea members who had come to occupy it after being unilaterally invited to do so by a Te Aitanga-a-Māhaki hapū. A second 1832 raid, this time against Te Whānau-ā-Apanui, did not meet with the same success, as the defenders of Wharekura pā rebuffed the attackers and slew two Ngāti Porou rangatira. Two years later, a retaliatory raid by Te Whānau-ā-Apanui was in turn rebuffed by forces under the rangatira Kakatarau, whose father Pakura was killed at Wharekura. Ngāti Porou then joined forces with Te Wera’s Ngāpuhi and Te Kani-a-Takirau’s Rongowhakaata to attack Te Whānau-ā-Apanui at Te Kaha Point’s formidable Toka a Kuku pā. After six months of siege and heavy fighting, including the defeat of numerous sorties and the routing of a relief force of fourteen hundred warriors from Whakatōhea, Ngāi Tai, and Ngāti Awa, the attackers eventually proved unable to seize the pā and returned home. The extraordinary battlefield feats of the Christian Ngāti Porou rangatira Piripi Taumata-a-Kura lent him enormous prestige, which he soon leveraged to convert other Ngāti Porou rangatira and lead Te Whānau-ā-Apanui and Ngāti Porou to a peace accord in 1837.

The waning of the Musket Wars and the unifying influence of Christianity ushered in a period of relative calm and cultural development. Ngāti Porou chiefs were also signatories to the Treaty of Waitangi in 1840. Ngāti Porou experienced substantial economic growth during the 1850s.

During the 1860s, the Pai Mārire religious movement spread through the North Island, and eventually came into conflict with the New Zealand Government. From 1865–1870, a civil war emerged within Ngāti Porou between Pai Mārire converts seeking the creation of an independent Māori state (supported by Pai Mārire from other regions) and other Ngāti Porou advocating tribal sovereignty and independence. This conflict is generally viewed as part of the East Cape War.

===Modern history===

Ngāti Porou once again enjoyed peace and economic prosperity during the late 19th century. The 1890s saw the emergence of Sir Āpirana Ngata, who contributed greatly to the revitalisation of the Māori people. During the early 20th century, the population of Ngāti Porou increased substantially. They were active in their participation in both World Wars.

After World War II, large numbers of Ngāti Porou began emigrating from traditional tribal lands and moving into larger urban areas, in a trend reflected throughout New Zealand. A large portion of the tribal population now lives in Auckland and Wellington.

==Hapū and marae==

==Governance==

Te Rūnanga o Ngāti Porou was established in 1987 to be the tribal authority of the iwi. It is organised into a whānau and hapū development branch, economic development branch, and a corporate services branch, and aims to maintain the financial, physical and spiritual assets of the tribe. The common law trust is overseen by a board, with two representatives from each of the seven ancestral zones. As of 2022, the Rūnanga is based in Gisborne, and is chaired by Selwyn Parata, with George Reedy as the chief executive.

The trust administers Treaty of Waitangi settlements under the Ngati Porou Claims Settlement Act, represents the iwi under the Māori Fisheries Act, and is the official iwi authority for resource consent consultation under the Resource Management Act. Its rohe is contained within the territory of Gisborne District Council, which is both a regional and district council.

==Media==

Radio Ngāti Porou is the official station of Ngāti Porou. It is based in Ruatoria and broadcasts on in Tikitiki, at Tolaga Bay, in Gisborne, in Ruatoria, and at Hicks Bay.

<text>Calas () are dumplings composed primarily of cooked rice, yeast, sugar, eggs, and flour; the resulting batter is deep-fried. It is traditionally a breakfast dish, served with coffee or cafe au lait, and has a mention in most Creole cuisine cookbooks. Calas are also referred to as Creole rice fritters or rice doughnuts.

==History==
The origin of calas is most often credited to slaves who came from rice-growing regions of Africa. A 1653 French recipe, &quot;beignets de riz&quot;, lends support to a French origin as well. The name &quot;calas&quot; is said to have come from the Nupe word &quot;kara&quot; (&quot;fried cake&quot;). According to &quot;The Dictionary of American Food &amp; Drink&quot;, the word calas was first printed in 1880.
Creole street vendors, typically women, sold the fresh hot calas in New Orleans&#x27; French Quarter, with the cry, &quot;Bel calas tout chauds!&quot; (Creole for &quot;Beautiful calas, still hot&quot;). These vendors, called &quot;calas women&quot;, would sell their pastries in the early morning from covered baskets or bowls carried upon their heads.

Writers in the first decade of the 20th century refer to the increasing rarity of calas as street food. Though not widely sold, calas continued to be made at home using leftover rice, and was a typical breakfast food in early 20th-century New Orleans.

After World War II, while the beignet remained popular, the calas became more and more obscure. From a breakfast food it evolved into a Mardi Gras and First Communion treat among Louisiana Creole families. It could be specially requested at some restaurants. Through the efforts of food preservationists, interest in calas was revived and it began to appear on the menus of some restaurants.

==Preparation==
In early recipes for calas, rice was boiled and cooled, then yeast added to make a sponge that was allowed to proof overnight. From this a batter was made by adding eggs, sugar and a little flour for binding. Rice flour was preferable but difficult to obtain, according to Eustis. A dash of salt might be included, and a grating of nutmeg was a typical addition. The batter was dropped by spoonfuls into deep, boiling lard and fried until browned. Modern recipes reflect the changes in available ingredients, cooking practices, and taste. Baking powder is sometimes used in place of yeast; vegetable oil is substituted for lard; savory variations have been developed.

<text>Nikolaos &quot;Nikos&quot; Kaklamanakis (, born 19 August 1968, in Athens) is the Greek Gold-medal winner who lit the Olympic torch in the opening ceremony of the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens. He was named one of the 1996 Greek Male Athletes of the Year.

Kaklamanakis participated in five consecutive Olympic Games from 1992 to 2008, reaching the medal race in all five of them. He won the gold medal at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta and the silver medal at the 2004 Olympics in Athens, while he was ninth in Barcelona (1992), sixth in Sydney (2000) and eighth in Beijing (2008).

==Biography==
One of the most popular athletes in Greece, Nikolaos Kaklamanakis is a three-time Mistral class windsurfing world champion and a gold medalist at the 1996 Summer Olympics in Sailing. He won silver in the event at the 2003 World Championships in Cádiz, Spain, behind Przemek Miarczynski of Poland. In the 2000 Summer Olympics he took the 6th place, while in the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Kaklamanakis took the silver medal behind Gal Fridman of Israel. Four years later, in the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games he finished 8th in the Men Sailing Race.

Kaklamanakis faced legal action from the Hellenic Sailing Federation in 2019 for alleged defamation. The lawsuit stemmed from statements Kaklamanis made during a speech in the Hellenic Parliament, criticizing certain practices within the federation. In 2022, the court acquitted Kaklamanis, ruling that there was no intent to defame.

Microsoft Configuration Manager product suite
* Configuration Manager Current Branch 2303, released April 2023

SMS went through three major iterations:
* The 1.x versions of the product defined the scope of control of the management server (the site) in terms of the NT domain being managed.
* With the 2.x versions, that site paradigm switched to a group of subnets to be managed together.
* With SMS 2003 the site could also be defined as one or more Active Directory sites.

The most frequently used feature is a software deployment, which provides installation and updating of Windows Apps, legacy applications, and Operating Systems across a business enterprise.

SMS 2003 saw the introduction of the Advanced Client. The Advanced Client communicates with a more scalable management infrastructure, namely the Management Point. (A Management Point (MP) can manage up to 25000 Advanced Clients.) Microsoft introduced the Advanced Client to provide a solution to the problem where a managed laptop might connect to a corporate network from multiple locations and thus should not always download content from the same place within the enterprise (though it should always receive policy from its own site). When an Advanced Client is within another location (SMS Site), it may use a local distribution point to download or run a program, which can conserve bandwidth across a WAN.

== System requirements ==
The basic system requirements for Configuration Manager are variable and dependent on the scale of configuration.

== Product branding and naming ==
Microsoft Configuration Management has gone through two brand changes. Both resulted in reducing confusion with other initialism as well as including the software in a Microsoft systems management portfolio.
In 2007, System Management Service (SMS) became System Center Configuration Manager (SCCM). This helped avoid confusion with the Short Message Service (SMS) initialism and added the product, along with other system management tools, under a unified System Center brand.
In 2019 Configuration Manager moved to the Microsoft Endpoint Manager suite to better align it with Microsoft Intune and related endpoint management products. This change also helped reduce confusion of the oft-used initialism SCCM that is common in other industries such as The Society of Critical Care Medicine (SCCM). In 2023 the term &quot;endpoint&quot; was removed to rename the product to Microsoft Configuration Manager.

Throughout the life of the product, many acronyms, initialisms, and abbreviations have been used to refer to the software including
* SMS
* SCCM
* CM
* MECM
* MEMCM
* MCM
* ConfigMgr
* Config Man

However, Microsoft has stated and documented that the official name is one of the following
* Microsoft Configuration Manager
* Configuration Manager
* ConfigMgr

<text>Ngāti Kahungunu is a Māori iwi located along the eastern coast of the North Island of New Zealand. The iwi is traditionally centred in the Hawke&#x27;s Bay and Wairārapa regions. The Kahungunu iwi also comprises 86 hapū (sub-tribes) and 90 marae (meeting grounds).

The tribe is organised into six geographical and administrative divisions: &quot;Wairoa&quot;, &quot;Te Whanganui-ā-Orotū&quot;, &quot;Heretaunga&quot;, &quot;Tamatea&quot;, &quot;Tāmaki-nui-a Rua&quot; and &quot;Wairarapa&quot;. It is the 4th largest iwi in New Zealand by population, with 82,239 people identifying as Ngāti Kahungunu in the 2018 census.

==Early history==
===Pre-colonisation===
Ngāti Kahungunu trace their origins to the &quot;Tākitimu&quot; waka, one of the Māori migration canoes which arrived on New Zealand&#x27;s North Island around 1100–1200 AD, according to Ngāti Kahungunu traditions. According to local legend, Tākitimu and its crew were completely &quot;tapu&quot;. Its crew comprised men only: high chiefs, chiefs, tohunga and elite warriors. No cooked food was eaten before or during the voyage. The captain of &quot;Tākitimu&quot; was Tamatea Arikinui. He left the &quot;waka&quot; at Tauranga in the Bay of Plenty or at Turanga, near modern-day Gisborne, travelling overland until he arrived at Ahuriri (now part of Napier) in the Hawke&#x27;s Bay Region. The waka &quot;Tākitimu&quot; itself continued its voyage to the South Island under a new captain, Tahu Pōtiki, from whom the South Island iwi of Ngāi Tahu takes its name.

According to oral history, Kahungunu was the great-grandson of Tamatea Arikinui and was born in present-day Kaitaia. It has been widely recounted that Kahungunu travelled extensively through the North Island during his early adulthood, eventually settling on the East Coast of the North Island. He married several times during his travels, and as a result there are many North Island hapū that trace their lineage directly back to Kahungunu. Many of his marriages were arranged for diplomatic purposes, uniting various iwi against their enemies, forming bonds and securing peace. At some point, Kahungunu arrived at Māhia Peninsula, where he pursued and married Rongomaiwahine, a woman from Nukutaurua who was a chief in her own right. She was famously beautiful, and according to legend had issued a challenge to Kahungunu, insulting his charismatic reputation and inviting him to prove himself worthy of her. Kahungunu accepted the challenge, murdered her husband and, after numerous trials, succeeded in obtaining Rongomaiwahine&#x27;s consent to marry. The iwi Ngāti Kahungunu and Ngāti Rongomaiwahine both descend from this marriage.

====Heretaunga====
The eldest son of Kahungunu and Rongomaiwahine was named Kahukura-nui. His children included two sons, Rākei-hikuroa and Rakai-pāka. Rākei-hikuroa wanted his favourite son Tū-purupuru to be pre-eminent chief over Ngāti Kahungunu. The twin sons of his nephew Kahutapere seemed to threaten this plan, so they were murdered. Kahutapere defeated Rakei-hikuroa at the Battle of Te Paepae o Rarotonga. After this, he led a migration of his families and followers from Nukutaurua on the Māhia Peninsula to Heretaunga, the region known today as Hawke&#x27;s Bay. Accompanying Rākei-hikuroa from Māhia to Heretaunga was a son from one of his first marriage, Taraia. Not long after their arrival in Heretaunga, Taraia succeeded Rākei-hikuroa as the leader of their people, and he proved to be a proficient strategist in the struggle for dominance of the region, displacing the Whatumamoa, Rangitāne, Ngāti Awa, and elements of the Ngāti Tara iwi, which lived in Petane, Te Whanganui-a-Orotu and Waiohiki. Within Taraia&#x27;s lifetime, Heretaunga was brought under the control of his people, who became the first of the Ngāti Kahungunu in that area.

The descendants of Rākei-hikuroa split into various hapū. Allegiances shifted, and Māori geopolitics in the region was largely played out as an internal struggle for dominance among the hapū of Ngāti Kahungunu, broken up by intermittent raids from Ngāti Porou and repeated attempts by Ngāti Raukawa to settle in Heretaunga.Initially, the descendants of Rākei-hikuroa were divided between Te Hika a Ruarauhanga, the descendants of his first wife, and Te Hika a Pāpāuma, the descendants of his second. After four generations, this conflict was resolved, when Te Whatuiāpiti of Pāpāuma married Te Huhuti, of Ruarauhanga. Their courtship is considered to be one of the great romances of Māori tradition. Subsequently, a new conflict arose between his descendants, Ngāti Te Whatuiāpiti, and the descendants of Taraia, Ngāti Te Ūpokoiri. Ngāti Te Whatuiāpiti settled in the Kaimanawa ranges, but were driven out by Ngāti Tūwharetoa in a war in the sixteenth of seventeenth centuries.

Over time, some Ngāti Kahungunu hapū settled in the Wairarapa region, finding a relatively peaceful existence there until the arrival of European settlers.

====Wairoa====
When Rākei-hikuroa departed for Heretaunga, Rakai-pāka and his sister Hinemanuhiri remained in the Gisborne area, but they were subsequently defeated in battle and migrated south to the northern Hawke&#x27;s Bay, where his descendants settled at Nūhaka and became the Ngāti Rakaipaaka hapū. Four generations later, their chief Te Huki solidified the hapū&#x27;s position throughout the region with a series of diplomatic marriages, a process referred to as &quot;setting the net of Te Huki,&quot; but was killed by Te Whānau-ā-Apanui.

Hinemanuhiri&#x27;s son Tama-te-rangi took control of the Wairoa River valley from Ngāi Tauira and established Ngāi Tamaterangi. The chief Kotore is said to have coined the name Ngāti Kahungunu in the next generation, shortly before he was killed in an attack led by Te Whānau-ā-Apanui. The west and east banks of the Wairoa were split between the brothers Tapuwae Poharutanga o Tukutuku and Te Maaha, who fought one another, but were subsequently re-joined through intermarriage. In the late eighteenth century, their children, led by Te Kahu-o-te-rangi and Te-O-Tane, won a crushing victory over Te Whānau-ā-Apanui at the Battle of Whāwhāpō. After this, Ngāti Kahungunu&#x27;s position in the northern Hawkes&#x27; Bay was secure. Later Te Kahu-o-te-rangi attempted to kill Te-O-Tane, but failed and they eventually reconciled.

===Early 19th century===
In 1807, the Musket Wars broke out as chiefs from the northern Ngāpuhi, now equipped with firearms, launched attacks on weaker tribes to the south. The ongoing conflict reached the east coast when, in 1822, a Ngāti Tuwharetoa war party led by Mananui Te Heuheu Tukino II crossed into Ngāti Kahungunu territory. Armed with muskets, Te Heuheu had come to assist Ngāti Te Ūpokoiri in retaking their lost pā of Te Roto-a-Tara, a fortified island in Lake Roto-a-Tara near the present-day site of Te Aute in Heretaunga. The pā had historically been an important strategic asset of Ngāti Te Ūpokoiri, but it had recently been occupied by Tangiteruru, a Ngāti Porou chief who had invaded Heretaunga with the help of Ngāti Maru. After the arrival of Te Heuheu&#x27;s war party, Tangiteruru abandoned the pā. However it was swiftly reoccupied by Te Pareihe, a young chief of Ngāti Te Whatuiāpiti. Te Heuheu laid siege to the pā but failed to capture it. After his brother was killed in a skirmish at nearby Waimarama, Te Heuheu abandoned his siege of Roto-a-Tara and raided the pā at Waimarama instead. Following this, he returned to Ngāti Tuwharetoa to regroup and prepare for a second assault on Te Roto-a-Tara. Returning weeks later, Te Heuheu was joined by a Ngāti Raukawa war party led by Te Whatanui, and together they devised a plan to assault the island fortress. They constructed a causeway enabling them to make the crossing from the shore of the lake to Te Roto-a-Tara pā. Te Pareihe commanded such a strong resistance in the ensuing battle that Te Heuheu and Te Whatanui were thrown back in total defeat, with the loss of over 500 chiefs. Te Pareihe abandoned Te Roto-a-Tara after the battle and moved to Pōrangahau.

Although he had beaten back a superior force at Te Roto-a-Tara, Te Pareihe knew that the defence of Heretaunga was unsustainable without the advantage of firearms. He and fellow Ngāti Kahungunu chief Tiakitai forged an alliance with Te Wera Hauraki, a chief from Ngāpuhi who had settled on the Māhia Peninsula. Together, their forces retook Te Roto-a-Tara pā from Ngāi Te Upokoiri, who had occupied the fortress island after Te Pareihe escaped to Pōrangahau. But when news reached the alliance that a huge coalition of Waikato and Tuwharetoa warriors were amassing to attack Heretaunga, Te Wera agreed to protect Te Pareihe and the Ngāti Kahungunu at his fortress settlement in Māhia. Hence, in late 1823, Te Pareihe led an exodus of Ngāti Kahungunu refugees from Heretaunga to Māhia, setting off from the beach at Waimarama. Some chiefs, such as Kurupo Te Moananui, Te Hapuku, and Tiakitai, remained in Heretaunga, but most joined the exodus. By the late 1830s hostilities had ended and the Ngāti Kahungunu diaspora began returning to Heretaunga.

In 1840 a number of Ngāti Kahungunu chiefs were signatories to the Treaty of Waitangi.

===Colonisation===
The spread of European settlement eventually reached Ngāti Kahungunu territory, and led to the rapid acquisition of Māori land by The Crown during the 1850s and 1860s. Chiefs from the Heretaunga area, such as Te Hapuku and Henare Tomoana lost significant areas of land in sales that have since been labelled &quot;extortionate,&quot; and which later became matters of dispute and protest. The loss of land during this period led to the emergence of the Repudiation Movement, a coalition of Ngāti Kahungunu leaders who sought to halt the rapidity of land loss in the region, and to dispute past sales.

In 1868 the Eastern Māori electorate was established in the New Zealand Parliament to provide parliamentary representation for Māori in the east of the North Island, an area encompassing Ngāti Kahungunu. The first representatives for the electorate were Ngāti Kahungunu chiefs Tareha Te Moananui (1868–1871), Karaitiana Takamoana (1871–1879), and Henare Tomoana (1879–1881). The effectiveness of Māori parliamentary representation during this period was hampered by a lack of fluent English on the part of the elected Māori representatives, and by a lack of confidence in the European parliamentary system itself, which was seen as incapable of protecting Māori interests. As a result, the Kotahitanga movement emerged in the 1890s to advocate for the establishment of an independent Māori parliament. It convened parliamentary style meetings at Pāpāwai Marae in Wairārapa and at Waipatu in Heretaunga, where key issues of importance for Māori were debated. However, by 1902 Te Kotahitanga had failed to gain recognition from the New Zealand Parliament and was therefore dissolved in favour of local Māori Councils, which were established in 1900.

==20th century history==

===Political leadership===

At the outset of the 20th century, a new generation of Māori leaders were beginning to participate in the Ngāti Kahungunu political landscape. Te Aute College had opened in 1854 near Hastings, and in the 1880s and 1890s it was attended by Āpirana Ngata, Maui Pomare, Te Rangi Hīroa (Sir Peter Buck), and Paraire Tomoana. In 1897 they formed the Te Aute College Students&#x27; Association and became active participants in public life, often mediating between the Crown and hapū in matters of local land management. In 1909 the group was joined by James Carroll and became known as the Young Māori Party. Hukarere Girls’ College and St Joseph&#x27;s Māori Girls&#x27; College were also established within the region.

===First World War===

When the First World War broke out in 1914, a number of Māori leaders responded by committing the support of their respective hapū and iwi. Alumni of the Young Māori Party, some of whom were now parliamentarians, were generally in favour of Māori enlistment and were involved in recruitment campaigns. Āpirana Ngata and Māui Pōmare were the most aggressive proponents of Māori enlistment, and in Ngāti Kahungunu they received the support of Paraire Tomoana, who was the son of the chief Henare Tomoana. Tomoana worked with Ngata to drive Māori recruitment campaigns both within Ngāti Kahungunu and throughout other areas of the North Island.

Many men from Ngāti Kahungunu were among the Māori who enlisted for war. They were organised into the New Zealand (Māori) Pioneer Battalion. The battalion participated in the Gallipoli campaign in 1915 and the Western Front between 1916 and 1918. In January 1918 Paraire Tomoana published the words of &quot;E Pari Ra&quot;, a piece written for soldiers lost in battle. After the war this tune was adopted by the Royal New Zealand Navy as their official slow march. Other songs composed by Tomoana were &quot;Tahi nei taru kino&quot;, &quot;I runga o nga puke&quot;, &quot;Hoki hoki tonu mai&quot;, &quot;Hoea ra te waka nei&quot;, &quot;Pokarekare Ana&quot;, and the haka &quot;Tika tonu&quot;. The songs have since become treasured anthems of Ngāti Kahungunu, and in some cases were adopted by other iwi due to their wartime popularity.

===Second World War===

After the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939, many men from Ngāti Kahungunu again enlisted and fought overseas, primarily with the 28th (Māori) Battalion. Soldiers from the Ngāti Kahungunu region were generally organised into &#x27;D&#x27; Company of the battalion, along with men from Waikato, Maniapoto, Wellington and the South Island. Additionally, &#x27;D&#x27; Company also consisted of some soldiers from the Pacific Islands, and from the Chatham Islands and Stewart Island. The battalion fought in the Greek, North African and Italian campaigns, during which it earned a formidable reputation as an extremely effective fighting force. It was also the most decorated New Zealand battalion of the war. Following the end of hostilities, the battalion contributed a contingent of personnel to serve in Japan as part of the British Commonwealth Occupation Force, before it was disbanded in January 1946. Wiremu Te Tau Huata was a well known officer from Ngāti Kahungunu, having served as the Māori Battalion&#x27;s military chaplain.

===Late 20th century===
By 1946 only a small percentage of land in the Ngāti Kahungunu region had been retained by Māori, and the traditional agrarian communities at the core of Māori society were beginning to break down as returned servicemen found employment and settled in urban areas, such as Wairoa, Napier, Hastings, and Masterton. By the year 1966, 70% of Māori men (throughout New Zealand in general) were now working in urban employment centres, particularly freezing works, sawmills, the transport industry (including road maintenance), the construction industry, and various types of factory work. In Hawke&#x27;s Bay, thousands of Māori worked at the Whakatu and Tomoana freezing works sites, near Hastings. However the regional economy and well-being of the Māori community was profoundly impacted when both plants closed; Whakatu in 1986 and Tomoana in 1994.

==Taiwhenua and hapū==
The iwi contains a total of 86 &quot;hapū&quot;. For administrative purposes they can be divided into six &quot;taiwhenua&quot; (regions), from north to south: Wairoa, Te Whanganui-a-Orotū, Heretaunga, Tamatea, Tāmaki nui-ā-Rua, and Wairarapa. Several hapū are found in multiple &quot;taiwhenua&quot;.

Wairoa is roughly equivalent to the Wairoa District, containing the area south of the Wharerata Ranges at Poverty Bay, including the Wairoa River and the Mahia Peninsula. There are twenty-six hapū:
Te Whanganui-a-Orotū covers the area roughly from the Mohaka River down to the Ngaruroro River (i.e. the northern part of Hastings District plus Napier). There are fifteen hapū:
Heretaunga is roughly equivalent to the part of Hastings District south of the Ngaruroro River, including Hastings. There are twenty-seven &quot;hapū&quot;:
Tamatea is roughly equivalent to Central Hawke&#x27;s Bay District. There are eighteen hapū:
Tāmaki nui-ā-Rua is roughly equivalent to Tararua District (i.e. the northern half of Wairarapa. It contains seven hapū:
Wairarapa covers the rest of the Wairarapa, down to the Cook Strait. It contains twenty-five hapū:
==Ngāti Kahungunu Iwi Incorporated (NKII)==

===Organisational structure of NKII ===
In 1988, Te Rūnanganui o Ngāti Kahungunu Incorporated was established as a centralised organisation responsible for iwi development, but it went into receivership in 1994. The organisation re-emerged with a new constitution in 1996 under the name Ngāti Kahungunu Iwi Incorporated (NKII). An election was held in 1997, resulting in the establishment of an elected board of trustees and a new mandate to govern iwi development. Elections are held every three years, and all adults with a whakapapa link to a hapū of Ngāti Kahungunu are eligible to vote. The chairperson of the board of trustees usually represents the iwi in political affairs.

In accordance with the constitution of Ngāti Kahungunu Iwi Inc, the board of trustees consists of ten &quot;tangata whenua&quot; representatives:

*One representative is elected within each of the six geographic and administrative divisions of the Ngāti Kahungunu area: &quot;Wairoa&quot;, &quot;Te Whanganui-ā-Orotū&quot;, &quot;Heretaunga&quot;, &quot;Tamatea&quot;, &quot;Tāmaki-nui-a Rua&quot; and &quot;Wairarapa.&quot; The constitution requires that a candidate for election to any of these positions must already be an elected board member of the &quot;Taiwhenua&quot; (local governing body) of the respective geographical subdivision.
*Two representatives are elected at large by registered members of Ngāti Kahungunu who reside outside of the Ngāti Kahungunu region. This electorate is referred to in the constitution as the &quot;Taurahere Runanga.&quot; Candidates for election to these positions must have a whakapapa link to a hapū of Ngāti Kahungunu. 
*One representative is elected as a kaumātua; a respected elder of the iwi who is proficient in Ngāti Kahungunu tikanga, kawa (traditional legal protocols), and reo. This representative is elected directly to the board by other kaumātua of Ngāti Kahungunu. 
*One representative is elected at large by the iwi membership to the chair of the board of trustees. To be eligible for this position, the candidate must already be an elected board member of a &quot;Taiwhenua&quot; of one of the geographical subdivisions of the iwi. In addition, the candidate must be proficient in Ngāti Kahungunu tikanga, kawa, and reo. As a special provision, if the incumbent chairperson&#x27;s term as a board member of a &quot;Taiwhenua&quot; expires during their tenure as chair of the iwi board, it does not disqualify them from seeking re-election.

The board employs a General Manager and staff, which oversees the operational affairs of the iwi organisation. General Managers have included Labour member of parliament Meka Whaitiri. An asset holding company was also established in 2005 to manage the iwi&#x27;s investment portfolio. The company&#x27;s directors include former rugby player Taine Randell.

===Leadership===
When Te Rūnanganui o Ngāti Kahungunu Incorporated was established in 1988, its first chairperson was Pita Sharples. By 1994 a rapid succession of other chairpeople had led the organisation, while severe disharmony between board members was increasingly hampering the board&#x27;s effectiveness. As a result, a case was brought to the High Court of New Zealand, where the dysfunctionality of the board was given as evidence of the need for the court to intervene. The court placed Te Rūnanganui o Ngāti Kahungunu Incorporated into receivership, and placed it under the jurisdiction of the Māori Land Court.

After the creation of a new constitution, the period of receivership ended and in 1996 the organisation was renamed Ngāti Kahungunu Iwi Incorporated. The first election for the new board took place in March 1997. Ngahiwi Tomoana of Heretaunga and Toro Waka of Te Whanganui-ā-Orotū were elected chairman and deputy chairman respectively.

===Ngāti Kahungunu Treaty settlements===

While NKII is the mandated iwi organisation (MIO) in charge of iwi development and overseeing the fisheries settlement it received in 2004, Ngāti Kahungunu have settled their Treaty settlements of historical grievances on a hapu basis. Because of this, Ngāti Kahungunu has seven separate entities that have (or are in the process of) received their Treaty settlements to govern for their respective affiliate hapu and whanau. This is contrary to a centralised iwi entity that has more power than its hapu/hapu collectives.

===Radio Kahungunu===

Radio Kahungunu is the official station of Ngāti Kahungunu. It began as Tairawhiti Polytechnic training station Te Toa Takitini 2XY, making two short-term broadcasts on 1431 AM in December 1988, and October and November 1989. It was relaunched in 1990 as Radio Kahungunu 2XT, sharing the 765 AM frequency with Hawke&#x27;s Bay&#x27;s Racing Radio and Radio Pacific. It began broadcasting full-time in late 1991, moved dedicated studios at Stortford Lodge in the late 1990s, and began an FM simulcast on 4 September 2000. It broadcasts from Hastings, and is available on and in Hawkes Bay.

<text>The Mountain Eagle is a 1926 silent film, and Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s second as director, following &quot;The Pleasure Garden&quot;. The film, a romantic drama set in Kentucky, is about a widower (Bernhard Goetzke) who jealously competes with his crippled son (John F. Hamilton) and a man he loathes (Malcolm Keen) over the affections of a schoolteacher (Nita Naldi). The film was mostly produced at the Emelka Film studios in Munich, Germany in autumn of 1925, with exterior scenes shot in the village of Obergurgl in the State of Tyrol, Austria. Production was plagued with problems, including the destruction of a village roof and Hitchcock experiencing altitude sickness. Due to producing the film in Germany, Hitchcock had more directorial freedom than he would have had in England, and he was influenced by German cinematic style and technique.

The film was released in Germany in May 1926 and screened for its British distributors in October 1926. It was met with disapproval and it was not until after the success of Hitchcock&#x27;s &quot;The Lodger: A Story of the London Fog&quot; that the film was released in the UK in May 1927. The film received mixed reviews and Hitchcock himself told François Truffaut he was relieved that the film was lost. Six surviving stills of &quot;The Mountain Eagle&quot; are reproduced in Truffaut&#x27;s book, and further stills have been found. In 2012, a set of 24 still photographs was found in an archive of one of Hitchcock&#x27;s close friends. The Cine Tirol Film Commission has described it as &quot;the most wanted film in the world&quot;; the British Film Institute has the film on the top of their &quot;BFI 75 Most Wanted&quot; list of missing films, and is actively searching for it.

==Plot==
The film is set in Kentucky, where J. P. Pettigrew&#x27;s (Bernhard Goetzke) wife had died giving birth to their son Edward (John F. Hamilton), born disabled. Pettigrew loathes John &#x27;Fear o&#x27; God&#x27; Fulton (Malcolm Keen) who was also in love with Pettigrew&#x27;s wife. Pettigrew later witnesses his now-grown son making love to schoolteacher Beatrice (Nita Naldi), and confronts her about the relationship. He attempts to take her in his arms, but Beatrice rejects his advances. Edward sees this and flees the village.

Pettigrew is incensed at both Beatrice&#x27;s rejection and the loss of his son, and thus attempts to have Beatrice arrested as a wanton harlot. John forestalls Pettigrew&#x27;s plan by marrying Beatrice and taking her to his cabin where they fall in love. Beatrice becomes pregnant. Pettigrew seeks revenge by having John thrown in prison for murdering his (missing) son.

A year later, John breaks out of prison and attempts to flee with Beatrice and their child. However, Beatrice falls ill and John must return to the village for a doctor. There he finds that Edward has reappeared. John&#x27;s affairs are now cleared up and he is legally free from the charge of murder. Pettigrew is subsequently shot and wounded (contemporary sources differ on this point), and is no longer a threat to John and his family.

==Cast==

* Nita Naldi as Beatrice
* Malcolm Keen as John &#x27;Fear o&#x27; God&#x27; Fulton
* John F. Hamilton as Edward Pettigrew
* Bernhard Goetzke as J.P. Pettigrew

==Preservation status==
&quot;The Mountain Eagle&quot; is the only completed feature film directed by Hitchcock that is considered a lost film, meaning that no prints are known to exist. Six surviving stills are reproduced in François Truffaut&#x27;s book. More stills have since been located, many of which are reproduced in Dan Auiler&#x27;s book. A lobby card for the film was found in a box of broken frames at a flea market in Rowley, Massachusetts. In 2012, a set of 24 still photographs were found in the archive of one of Hitchcock&#x27;s close friends. Although these images gave clues to the film and its story, they were taken on the set rather than being stills from the film itself. They were auctioned off in Los Angeles for $6,000 (£3,700). Hitchcock&#x27;s notebooks were also found, documenting his journey to Obergurgl by train, horse and cart, and by foot.

Both &quot;The Pleasure Garden&quot; and &quot;The Mountain Eagle&quot; were produced in co-operation with Emelka Film Studios in Munich, Germany. The film was mostly shot at Emelka in Munich in autumn 1925, and the film exteriors were shot on location in Obergurgl, in what is now the municipality of Sölden in the State of Tyrol in southwestern Austria, the Ötztal Alps standing in for the mountains and hollows of Kentucky. Due to producing the film in Germany, Hitchcock had more directorial freedom than he would have had in England, and influences in the technique and style of German cinema are evident in his early works.

Production was plagued with problems. Poor weather during the location shoot was a constant source of trouble, and Hitchcock and the crew had an uneasy relationship with the locals. Hitchcock ordered the clearance of snow from a meadow and ordered the local volunteer fire brigade to blast it away, causing the roof of a nearby building to collapse. The mayor demanded compensation of one shilling, but Hitchcock gave the woman who owned the house two shillings to cover the repair work and the inconvenience. Hitchcock offended the locals by refusing to stay at the village inn, and when he was taken ill with altitude sickness, he blamed the sickness on his reaction to the guttural sound of their accents.

==Reception==
The film was initially screened for its British distributors in October 1926, but they did not think much of the film and decided to shelve it. However, due to the runaway success of &quot;The Lodger: A Story of the London Fog&quot;, which was released in February 1927, the producers decided to release &quot;The Mountain Eagle&quot; three months later on 23 May 1927.

Writing in 1949, the academic Peter Noble inadvertently started a rumour repeated by many authors since, of the film being released in the United States as &quot;Fear o&#x27; God&quot;. Noble&#x27;s assertion is contradicted by the title on the surviving US lobby card and film historian J. Larry Kuhns, who claims the film was never released under that title.

The film, distributed by Gainsborough Pictures, was neither a critical nor commercial success; Leonard J. Leff states that the film &quot;impressed neither the distributor nor the public&quot;. Like Hitchcock&#x27;s other early films, the film was criticised for a lack of realism; an early review by &quot;Bioscope&quot; stated that &quot;in spite of skilful and at times brilliant direction, the story has an air of unreality.&quot; Hitchcock himself considered &quot;The Mountain Eagle&quot; to be mundane melodrama best forgotten, and described the film to François Truffaut as &quot;awful&quot; and a &quot;very bad movie&quot;, and stated that he was not sorry that there are no known prints. After being bitterly disappointed with his first two films, Hitchcock believed that his directing career would soon be over, although he later described &quot;Waltzes from Vienna&quot; (1934) to be the &quot;lowest ebb&quot; of his career. Film historian J. Lary Kuhns, however, states in the book &quot;Hitchcock&#x27;s Notebooks&quot; by Dan Auiler that one contemporary writer called &quot;The Mountain Eagle&quot; far superior to &quot;The Lodger&quot;. &quot;The Guardian&quot; describes the film as &quot;a ripping yarn about a dastardly father, a crippled son, a lovely schoolteacher and an innocent imprisoned&quot;.

William Rothman considers both &quot;The Pleasure Garden&quot; and &quot;The Mountain Eagle&quot; to be &quot;equally worthy of study&quot;. The Cine Tirol Film Commission has described &quot;The Mountain Eagle&quot; as &quot;the most wanted film in the world&quot;. In 1992, the British Film Institute released its first &quot;Missing Presumed Lost&quot; list of films, and in January 2010 they announced that they had begun actively searching for some 75 missing films, including &quot;The Mountain Eagle&quot;.

<doc id="916547" wikidata="Q6737997" url="?curid=916547" title="Major-General George R. Pearkes Building">
<text>The Major-General George R. Pearkes Building (often abbreviated as just Pearkes, ) is an office building located downtown Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. It is the principal location of Canada&#x27;s National Defence Headquarters (NDHQ); while NDHQ comprises a collection of offices spread across the National Capital Region, the Pearkes Building is its primary base. Located at 101 Colonel By Drive, it is often referred to as &#x27;101 Col By&#x27;.

As of 2022, the building is occupied by senior defence and military staff, procurement and policy officials, intelligence specialists, legal affairs and staff involved in infrastructure.

==History==

The building, named after Major-General George R. Pearkes, was constructed between 1969 and 1974, and was originally intended for use by the Department of Transport. When a planned National Defence Headquarters complex on the LeBreton Flats was not built, however, DND acquired the Colonel By Drive structure. In 1972, the Department of Transportation moved into Place de Ville&#x27;s newly completed Tower C.

The concept for the group of buildings was developed by French town planner Jacques Gréber immediately after World War II at the invitation of Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King. Gréber, a proponent of boulevards and highways as opposed to rail corridors, advised that the city redevelop the east bank of the Rideau Canal which was, at that time, covered with railway tracks leading to Ottawa Union Station.

This design was accomplished with the removal of the station tracks and relocation of passenger rail service to a new suburban station; the Ottawa Union Station building has since become the Government Conference Centre. The remaining land that contained the coach yard for Ottawa Union Station was vacant and ready for developments that would contain the Pearkes Building and the Rideau Centre.

Architects John C. Parkin, Searle, Wilby, and Rowland designed the buildings in the then-popular Brutalist style. They were conceived as the first phase of the planned redevelopment, the Rideau Centre, which opened in 1983, being the second phase.

===Relocation===

The Pearkes Building underwent extensive renovations from the mid-1990s as each floor was gutted to replace the hodge podge of outdated offices and furnishings dating to the building&#x27;s opening in 1974. Modular office furnishings produced by CORCAN (constructed in Canadian prisons) were installed.

By the mid-2000s it became apparent that the NDHQ complex at the Pearkes Building was overcrowded, forcing DND to spread some headquarters staff across the National Capital Region. Sizeable NDHQ offices have been established in the past, or are still currently located in, Place Export Canada, the Constitution Building, l&#x27;Esplanade Laurier, Louis St Laurent Building (Gatineau, Quebec) and the Berger Building, among others.

Cutbacks among high-technology companies in the Ottawa region led DND to consider buying a surplus JDS Uniphase campus in suburban Barrhaven at the intersection of Merivale Road and Prince of Wales Drive, west of the Ottawa International Airport. JDS&#x27;s former Barrhaven campus comprises two large buildings with extensive computer networking capacity, and was advertised for sale at a fraction of its construction cost. The location was perceived to be far more secure, being set back from public roads, with ample parking and transit connections for the several thousand employees it was designed to support. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police now occupy this property.

As of 2017, DND was in the process of relocating some of their personnel to the former Nortel R&amp;D facility at Carling Campus. However, DND dismissed rumours that other federal government agencies would occupy the Pearkes building; it will still be used by DND staff.

The reported relocation of additional DND personnel to NDHQ Carling was expected to be complete by 2028. By January 2022, the Pearkes building was half-empty, despite plans to have all staff relocated to NDHQ Carling for renovations to start, which would require four years to complete. In August 2023, a new operational headquarters facility is planned for construction at NDHQ Carling with contracts finalized by 2025, which would eventually allow for the eventual vacating of 101 Colonel By Drive by 2035.

==Design==

===Attack vulnerability===

The threat of terrorist attacks in recent decades, particularly following the September 11, 2001 attacks, led to the permanent closure of an access road that runs beneath the connecting section of the two structures comprising the MGen George R. Pearkes Building. The interior mezzanine corridor connecting the north and south towers has been closed to all but pass holders since the 1990s.

A dramatic architectural feature (and potential vulnerability), it was initially cordoned off using temporary concrete barriers. Work has now been completed permanently closing off the thoroughfare that formerly linked Nicholas Street to Colonel By Drive and the adjacent Rideau Canal by building permanent concrete barriers, metal fencing, and a gatehouse equipped with the capability to stop unauthorised vehicles from entering.

<doc id="916552" wikidata="Q12337" url="?curid=916552" title="Corkscrew">
<text>A corkscrew is a tool for drawing corks from wine bottles and other household bottles that may be sealed with corks. In its traditional form, a corkscrew simply consists of a pointed metallic helix (often called the &quot;worm&quot;) attached to a handle, which the user screws into the cork and pulls to extract it. Corkscrews are necessary because corks themselves, being small and smooth, are difficult to grip and remove, particularly when inserted fully into an inflexible glass bottle. More recent styles of corkscrew incorporate various systems of levers that further increase the amount of force that can be applied outwards upon the cork, making the extraction of difficult corks easier.

==History==
The design of the corkscrew may have been derived from the gun worm, which was a device from at least the early 1630s used by men to remove unspent charges from a musket&#x27;s barrel in a similar fashion.

The corkscrew is possibly an English invention, due to the tradition of beer and cider, and &quot;Treatise on Cider&quot; by John Worlidge in 1676 describes &quot;binning of tightly corked cider bottles on their sides&quot;, although the earliest reference to a corkscrew is, &quot;steel worm used for the drawing of Corks out of Bottles&quot; from 1681.

In 1795, the first corkscrew patent was granted to the Reverend Samuel Henshall, in England. The clergyman affixed a simple disk, now known as the Henshall Button, between the worm and the shank. The disk prevents the worm from going too deep into the cork, forces the cork to turn with the turning of the crosspiece, and thus breaks the adhesion between the cork and the neck of the bottle. The disk is designed and manufactured slightly concave on the underside, which compresses the top of the cork and helps keep it from breaking apart.

A person who collects corkscrews is a &quot;helixophile.&quot;

==Types==

===Basic===
In its traditional form, a corkscrew is simply a steel screw attached to a perpendicular handle, made of wood or some other material. The user grips the handle and screws the metal point into the cork, until the helix is firmly embedded, then a vertical pull on the corkscrew extracts the cork from the bottle. The handle of the corkscrew allows for a commanding grip to ease removal of the cork.

=== Winged corkscrew ===

The winged corkscrew, sometimes called a cork extractor, butterfly corkscrew, owl corkscrew, Indian corkscrew, or angel corkscrew, has two levers, one on either side of the worm. As the worm is twisted into the cork, the levers are raised. Pushing down the levers draws the cork from the bottle in one smooth motion. The most common design has a rack and pinion connecting the levers to the body. The head of the central shaft is frequently modified to form a bottle opener, or foil cutter, increasing the utility of the device. Corkscrews of this design are particularly popular in household use.

In 1880, William Burton Baker was issued British Patent No. 2950 for his double lever corkscrew, with both levers sliding onto the upper end of the shank. 

The first American patent was in 1930 granted to the Italian Domenico Rosati who emigrated to Chicago, Illinois, to work as bartender before the prohibition. Rosati&#x27;s design had an exposed rack and pinion mechanism. Such design was adapted by other brands as the wine-market grew in popularity.

The winged owl version, with two side-plates covering the rack and pinion mechanism, was first designed and manufactured in 1932 by the Spanish industrial designer David Olañeta for his brand BOJ and was later adopted by others, such as the 1936 US Patent No. 98,968 by Richard Smythe marked HOOTCH-OWL.

=== Sommelier knife ===

A sommelier knife, waiter&#x27;s friend or wine key is a corkscrew in a folding body similar to a pocket knife. It was conceived by the German Karl Wienke in 1882 and patented in Germany, England, and America.

An arm extends to brace against the lip of the bottle for leverage when removing the cork. Some sommelier knives have two steps on the lever, and often also a bottle opener. A small hinged knife blade is housed in the handle end to be used in cutting the foil wrapping the neck of many wine bottles. A corkscrew of this type can be used more quickly (and with more &quot;show&quot; or panache) than a wing-type corkscrew.

The term &quot;wine key&quot; came into existence due to the German inventor&#x27;s last name, Wienke, which is difficult for English speakers to pronounce. When ordering the product from catalogs, the meaning and origins of the new Wienke Corkscrew gradually became lost and it was simply referred to as a &quot;Winekey&quot; or wine key. Patent number 283,731, August 21, 1883, simply refers to it as &quot;C.F.A. WIENKE LEVER CORKSCREW.&quot; 
=== Twin-prong cork puller ===

Also known as butler&#x27;s friend or &quot;Ah-So&quot; (from the German , meaning &quot;Now I understand!&quot;), the twin-prong cork puller can extract a stopper without damaging it, to allow for sampling the wine before re-inserting the stopper. The stopper is removed by pushing the prongs between the cork and the neck of the bottle, and twisting the stopper out of the bottle. Replacing the stopper involves taking it between the two prongs, then twisting it into the bottle and pulling out the prongs. It can also extract a stopper in bad condition.
=== Lever corkscrew ===

The lever or &quot;rabbit&quot; corkscrew is operated using a pair of handles which are used to grip the neck of the bottle, and a lever which is simply pressed down to twist the screw into the cork, then lifted to extract the cork. Expelling the cork from the device is done with a similar press/lift action. This style of corkscrew is much bulkier, and typically much more expensive, than other styles, but is much faster.

===Mounted corkscrew===
The mounted corkscrew was invented in the late 1800s for use in homes, hotel bars, and restaurants in an era where all bottles were stopped with corks. They are screwed or clamped to counters or walls. When beer began to be sold in bottles, bars required a speedy way to open them. Most early mounted corkscrews were designed to open beer bottles with short corks. Modern ones are made for longer wine corks.
===Screwpull===

In 1979, Herbert Allen introduced the &quot;Screwpull&quot; corkscrew. The device was meant to make opening wine bottles fool-proof.

The Screwpull wraps around the top of the bottle, with a plastic screw that simply needs to be turned to remove the cork, without effort. The spiral is coated with Teflon, which reduces friction as it twists into the cork, ensuring it is removed intact without pulling.

The Screwpull is part of The Museum of Modern Art’s permanent collection.

The company was sold to Le Creuset in 1992.

===Others===
There are many other styles of corkscrew which are not widely used in consumer settings, such as high-priced elaborate devices for specialists, and for industrial uses.

<text>Credit Suisse First Boston (also known as CSFB and CS First Boston) was the investment banking affiliate of Credit Suisse headquartered in New York.

The company was created by the merger of First Boston Corporation and Credit Suisse Group in 1988 and was active in investment banking, capital markets and financial services. In 2006, Credit Suisse reorganized and merged CS First Boston into the parent company and retired use of the &quot;First Boston&quot; brand. In 2022, as part of a major restructuring, Credit Suisse began the process of spinning out the investment bank into an independent company and revived the brand. The process ultimately failed, and Credit Suisse was merged into rival Swiss bank UBS.

==History==

===Credit Suisse / First Boston 50 / 50 Joint Venture (1978–1988)===
&quot;Main Article First Boston&quot;

In 1978, Credit Suisse and First Boston Corporation formed a London-based 50-50 investment banking joint venture called &quot;Financière Crédit Suisse-First Boston&quot;. This joint venture later became the operating name of Credit Suisse&#x27;s investment banking operations.

=== Transition to CS First Boston (1988–1996)===

Credit Suisse acquired a 44.5 percent stake in First Boston in 1988. The investment bank acquired its shares held by the public and the company was taken private. In 1989, the junk bond market collapsed, leaving First Boston unable to redeem hundreds of millions it had lent for the leveraged buyout of Ohio Mattress Company, maker of Sealy mattresses, a deal that became known as &quot;the burning bed&quot;. Credit Suisse bailed them out and acquired a controlling stake in 1990. Although such an arrangement was arguably illegal under the Glass–Steagall Act, the Federal Reserve U.S. bank regulator concluded that the integrity of the financial markets was better served by avoiding bankruptcy, even though it meant a de facto merger of a commercial bank with an investment bank.

=== CS First Boston (1996–2006) ===

In the mid-1990s, Credit Suisse became Credit Suisse First Boston (commonly referred to as CSFB or CS First Boston) expanding beyond the London franchise.

Conflict with Credit Suisse First Boston in Europe began creating problems for Credit Suisse. First Boston in New York and CSFB in London had their own management teams, with competing salesmen in each other’s territory and in the Pacific region. In 1996, Credit Suisse purchased the remaining stake of CS First Boston from its management and rebranded the European, U.S., and Asia Pacific investment banks as Credit Suisse First Boston, making one global brand. In the late 1990s, CSFB purchased the equity division of Barclays Bank, Barclays de Zoete Wedd (&quot;BZW&quot;). BZW was considered second-tier and CSFB reportedly bought BZW from Barclays for £1 plus assumption of debt - primarily to obtain BZW&#x27;s client list. A permanent injunction prevented First Boston from offering shares in Gulf Oil company, due to lack of interest in share offering, and the Iraq Desert Storm campaign. A Nevada judge issued a cease and desist order to stop Barclays from taking American owned assets and offering them to international buyers from Iran, Iraq, Syria, Egypt, and North Korea.

In 2000, Credit Suisse First Boston spent $13 billion to buy Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette (also known as DLJ) as stock markets were peaking. By the time the acquisition closed in 2001, stock markets were down significantly. The deal led to a culture clash that triggered the departures of key bankers. In order to keep top bankers, CSFB handed them three-year guaranteed contracts, swelling costs relative to revenue and leading to two years of losses at the investment bank.

At the same time, the newly global CSFB became a leading high-tech banker, acting as lead (or co-lead) underwriter in the IPOs of Amazon.com and Cisco Systems, as well as one-time high fliers such as Silicon Graphics, Intuit, Netscape, and VA Linux Systems. CSFB also did significant deals for Apple Computer, Compaq and Sun Microsystems, among others. In 2000, at the height of the tech boom, technology deals generated $1.4 billion in revenue for CSFB. The head of CSFB&#x27;s tech group, Frank Quattrone, reportedly made $200 million in bonuses between 1998 and 2000.

After the collapse in technology shares in 2001, Credit Suisse replaced CSFB’s CEO Allen Wheat with Morgan Stanley&#x27;s John Mack, who was charged with turning around the investment bank. Mack fired 10,000 employees, or one-third of CSFB&#x27;s workforce, although many former DLJ bankers continued to collect guaranteed pay long after they were gone. Also in 2001, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the Justice Department began investigating how CSFB allocated IPOs of technology companies. The probe led to the conviction of Frank Quattrone in 2004, who was found guilty of urging employees to destroy documents after he learned about the investigation. He was ultimately acquitted of substantially all charges upon appeal in 2006.

Announced in 2005, Credit Suisse retired the First Boston name on January 16, 2006, in order to “allow Credit Suisse to communicate as an integrated organization to clients, employees and shareholders.” The move led some to speculate that the name change reflected the diminished luster of the once great First Boston name as a result of years of mismanagement and scandal. However, its strategy is consistent with that of other large, international financial conglomerates. Citigroup has eliminated the Salomon Brothers name from its investment banking business, and UBS AG has done the same with the SG Warburg, Dillon Read and Paine Webber names. Deutsche Bank has effectively retired the Bankers Trust and Morgan Grenfell names.

=== Credit Suisse Investment Banking Division (2006–2022) ===

In 2006, the newly reorganized investment banking division of Credit Suisse replaced the CSFB brand and entity. Credit Suisse retired the &#x27;First Boston&#x27; name to &quot;allow Credit Suisse to communicate as an integrated organization to clients, employees, and shareholders.&quot;

The Irish High Court referred to advertisements by Credit Suisse First Boston in a judgment in February 2013. Mr. Justice Michael Moriarty said that while the volume of material produced by the Revenue Commissioners in an application to investigate tax-evading offshore bank accounts may have been &quot;somewhat excessive&quot;, it related to matters which had been discussed in all media, including &quot;the conduct of banking institutions both in Ireland and elsewhere, as exemplified by the Credit Suisse First Boston sequence of advertisements in the Irish Times&quot;.

=== Return to CS First Boston (2022–2023)===
On October 27, 2022, Credit Suisse announced its intention to restructure its investment bank by transitioning its capital markets and advisory activities to a newly created independent bank, CS First Boston. By October 30, 2022, Credit Suisse had reflected &quot;CS First Boston&quot; as the name of its investment banking division. UBS began the process of acquiring Credit Suisse in March 2023. By 2024, Credit Suisse First Boston ceased again to exist.

<doc id="916571" wikidata="Q1521187" url="?curid=916571" title="Tide pool">
<text>A tide pool or rock pool is a shallow pool of seawater that forms on the rocky intertidal shore. These pools typically range from a few inches to a few feet deep and a few feet across. Many of these pools exist as separate bodies of water only at low tide, as seawater gets trapped when the tide recedes. Tides are caused by the gravitational pull of the sun and moon. A tidal cycle is usually about 25 hours and consists of two high tides and two low tides.

Tide pool habitats are home to especially adaptable animals, like snails, barnacles, mussels, anemones, urchins, sea stars, crustaceans, seaweed, and small fish. Inhabitants must be able to cope with constantly changing water levels, water temperatures, salinity, and oxygen content. At low tide, there is the risk of predators like seabirds. These pools have engaged the attention of naturalists and marine biologists, as well as philosophical essayists: John Steinbeck wrote in &quot;The Log from the Sea of Cortez&quot;, &quot;It is advisable to look from the tide pool to the stars and then back to the tide pool.&quot; 

Some examples have been artificially augmented to enable safer swimming (for example without waves or without sharks) in seawater at certain states of the tide.

==Zones ==

The rocky shoreline exhibits distinct zones with unique characteristics. These zones are created by the tidal movements of water along the rocky shores from high to low-tide. They are:

* The supralittoral zone or splash zone: area above the high-tide mark, which is virtually a terrestrial environment. Occasionally gets splashed, but never gets covered by the ocean.
* The intertidal fringe: area around the high-tide mark. 
* The intertidal or littoral zone: area between the high and low-tide marks. Can be further divided into high, mid, and low intertidal zones, which are explained below in more depth.
* The sublittoral or subtidal zone: area below the low-tide mark.

The presence and abundance of flora and fauna vary between zones along the rocky shore. This is due to niche adaptations in response to the varying tides and solar exposure.

Tide pools exist in the intertidal zone (the area within the tidal range), which is submerged by the sea at high tides and during storms. At other times, the rocks may undergo other extreme conditions, such as baking in the sun or being exposed to cold winds. Few organisms can survive such harsh conditions.

===High Tide Zone===
The high tide zone is flooded during each high tide, which occurs once or twice daily. Organisms must survive wave action, currents, and long exposure to the sun and open air. This zone is predominantly inhabited by seaweed and invertebrates, such as sea anemones, sea star, chitons, crabs, green algae, and mussels. Marine algae provide shelter for nudibranchs and hermit crabs. The same waves and currents that make life in the high tide zone difficult bring food to filter feeders and other intertidal organisms.

=== Mid Tide Zone ===
This zone is constantly covered and uncovered by water, so its inhabitants have adapted to surviving in these conditions. More plants and animals live here, compared to the high tide zone, because they are not exposed to drying conditions for so long. During low tide, anemones close up and mussels close their shells to keep in moisture. They reopen when the tide returns and brings them food. 

===Low Tide Zone===
This area is mostly submerged and is exposed only during unusually low tide. It usually teems with life and has far more marine vegetation, especially seaweeds. Organisms in this zone do not have to be as well adapted to drying out and temperature extremes. Low tide zone organisms include abalone, anemones, brown seaweed, chitons, crabs, green algae, hydroids, isopods, limpets, mussels, and sometimes even small vertebrates such as fish. Seaweeds provide shelter for many animals, like sea slugs and urchins that are too fragile for other zones. These creatures can grow to larger sizes because there is more available energy and better water coverage: the water is shallow enough to allow additional sunlight for photosynthetic activity, with almost normal levels of salinity. This area is also relatively protected from large predators because of the wave action and shallow water.

==Marine life==


Tide pools provide a home for many organisms such as sea stars, mussels and clams. Inhabitants deal with a frequently changing environment: fluctuations in water temperature, salinity, and oxygen content. Hazards include waves, strong currents, exposure to midday sun and predators.

Waves can dislodge mussels and draw them out to sea. Gulls pick up and drop sea urchins to break them open. Sea stars prey on mussels and are eaten by gulls themselves. Black bears are known to sometimes feast on intertidal creatures at low tide. Although tide pool organisms must avoid getting washed away into the ocean, drying up in the sun, or being eaten, they depend on the tide pool&#x27;s constant changes for food. Tide pools contain complex food webs that can vary based on the climate.

===Fauna===
The sea anemone &quot;Anthopleura elegantissima&quot; reproduces clones of itself through a process of longitudinal fission, in which the animal splits into two parts along its length.
The sea anemone &quot;Anthopleura sola&quot; often engages in territorial fights. The white tentacles (acrorhagi), which contain stinging cells, are for fighting. The sea anemones sting each other repeatedly until one of them moves.

Some species of sea stars can regenerate lost arms. Most species must retain an intact central part of the body to be able to regenerate, but a few can regrow from a single ray. The regeneration of these stars is possible because the vital organs are in the arms.

Sea urchins (&quot;Echinoidia&quot;) move around tide pools with tube like feet. Different species of urchin have different colors, and many are seen in tide pools. With spines, some filled with poison like with &quot;Toxopnesutes pileolus&quot;, that protect them from predators they feed almost undisturbed in tide pools. Algae and other microorganism are the food sources that attract them to the tide pools.

The presence of the California mussel increases the supply of inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus in coastal marine tide pools which allows the ecosystem the nutrients to be more productive. The shell of a California mussel is primarily composed of Aragonite and Calcite which are both polymorphs of Calcium carbonate. Climate change and ocean acidification has led to a decrease in these amounts important compounds in California Mussel shells over many years.

Lichens and barnacles live in the splash zone. Different barnacle species live at very tightly constrained elevations, with tidal conditions precisely determining the exact height of an assemblage relative to sea level. The intertidal zone is periodically exposed to sun and wind, conditions that can cause barnacles to become desiccated. These animals, therefore, need to be well adapted to water loss. Their calcite shells are impermeable, and they possess two plates which they slide across their mouth opening when not feeding. These plates also protect against predation.

Many species of Hermit crab are commonly found in tide pool environments. The long-wristed hermit crab (Pagurus longicarpus) has been found to become stranded in tide pools and are forced to inhabit gastropod shells in response to the rapidly changing temperature of the pools. Hermit crabs of different or the same species compete for the snail shells that are available.

Many fish species can live in tidepools. Tidepool fishes are those inhabiting the intertidal zone during part or the entirety of their life cycle, including residents displaying morphological, physiological and behavioral adaptations to withstand the fluctuating environment and non-residents that use the intertidal as juvenile habitat, feeding or refuge ground, or as transient space between nearshore areas. Tidepools fishes can be classified as residents and non-residents (sometimes called transients or visitors). Residents are those that spend the whole lifetime in the tidepools. Non-resident species are commonly divided into two groups: secondary residents (also known as partial residents or opportunists) and transients (which can be further classified as tidal and seasonal transients). Secondary residents are species that spend only a portion of their life history in tidepools, typically during their juvenile stage, before moving on to adult subtidal habitats. Transients, on the other hand, may temporarily inhabit tidepools for various reasons such as foraging, seeking refuge, or transit. Unlike residents, transients lack specialized adaptations for intertidal life and typically occupy large tidepools for a relatively short period, ranging from a single tidal cycle to a few months. The Tidepool sculpin is a species of fish that is named for its tide pool habitat. The Tidepool Sculpin has been found to show preferences for certain tide pools and will return to their tide pool of choice after being removed from it. This is a behavior known as Homing (biology). These fish crawl on the floor of tide pools using a back and forth movement of their tail fin and a rotating motion of their pectoral fins.

Multiple species of Amphipods (Amphipoda) can be found in coastal tide pools. These small crustaceans provide an important food source for predator species as well as limiting the growth of algae attached to vegetation.

===Flora===
Sea palms (&quot;Postelsia&quot;) look similar to miniature palm trees. They live in the middle to upper intertidal zones in areas with greater wave action. High wave action may increase nutrient availability and moves the blades of the thallus, allowing more sunlight to reach the organism so that it can photosynthesize. In addition, the constant wave action removes competitors, such as the mussel species &quot;Mytilus californianus&quot;.

Recent studies have shown that &quot;Postelsia&quot; grows in greater numbers when such competition exists; a control group with no competition produced fewer offspring than an experimental group with mussels; from this it is thought that the mussels provide protection for the developing gametophytes. Alternatively, the mussels may prevent the growth of competing algae such as &quot;Corallina&quot; or &quot;Halosaccion&quot;, allowing &quot;Postelsia&quot; to grow freely after wave action has eliminated the mussels.

Coralline algae &quot;Corallinales&quot; are predominant features of mid and low intertidal tide pools. Calcium carbonate (CaCO3) takes the form of calcite in their cell walls providing them with a hard outer shell. This shell protects from herbivores and desiccation due to lack of water and evaporation. Many forms of the Coralline algae bring herbivores, such as mollusks &quot;Notoacmea&quot;, to the tide pools during high tides, increasing the biomass of the area. Once low tides comes, these herbivores are exposed to carnivores in the areas, fueling the food web.

=== Coastal predators ===
Tide pools are often surrounded by coastal predators who feed on tide pool flora and fauna. These predators play an important role in the tide pool food web and create competition for resources.

<text>The European Telecommunications Satellite Organization (Eutelsat IGO) is an intergovernmental organisation consisting of 49 member states. It is headquartered in Paris, France. The mission of Eutelsat IGO is to maintain the rights to use radio frequencies and orbital locations which were assigned collectively to the Member States by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) and to oversee the operations of Eutelsat S.A. so as to ensure that the company complies with the international Eutelsat Convention. Eutelsat IGO plays an active role within the global telecommunications community and is a key actor in the satellite business sector.

== History ==
The European Telecommunications Satellite Organization was created in 1977 on an interim basis by 17 European countries, members of the European Conference of Postal and Telecommunications Administrations (CEPT). Its purpose was to provide Europe with a satellite infrastructure for a wide range of telecommunications services. The Convention establishing the European Telecommunications Satellite Organization Eutelsat was opened for signature in July 1982 and entered into force on 1 September 1985.

The main mission of Eutelsat was the design, development, construction, operation and maintenance of the space segment for international public telecommunications services in Europe. Eutelsat started by providing space segment capacity for basic telecommunications and audio-visual services and rapidly expanded its activities to the provision of services for analogue and digital television, radio broadcasting, business telecommunications, multimedia communications, messaging and positioning in Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Asia and the American continent.

Following the liberalisation of the telecommunications sector in Europe, the Eutelsat Member States decided in May 1999 to restructure the organisation. On 2 July 2001, all assets, liabilities and operational activities of the intergovernmental organisation were transferred to Eutelsat S.A., a private company established in Paris for this purpose. The original Eutelsat Convention was amended with the agreement of the Member States and the amendments entered into force on a definitive basis on 28 November 2002.

There is an agreement between Eutelsat IGO and Eutelsat S.A. for the use of the name Eutelsat. When written in capital letters and followed by IGO it refers to the international organisation while the companies of the Eutelsat Group write Eutelsat in small letters in order to avoid potential confusion.

== Purposes ==
Since its restructuring in 2001, the structure, role, mission and activities of Eutelsat IGO have evolved to reflect developments in the fields of regulation, technology and markets for Fixed Satellite Services.

The primary purpose of Eutelsat IGO is to ensure that Eutelsat S.A. observes the Basic Principles set forth in Article III a) of the Amended Convention referring to public service/universal service obligations, pan European coverage by the satellite system, non-discrimination and fair competition. This supervisory task is executed primarily through the participation of the Executive Secretary on the boards of directors of Eutelsat S.A. and its parent company Eutelsat Communications (Paris Stock Exchange symbol: ETL) as an observer &quot;(censeur)&quot;. This gives him the right to obtain information and voice opinions without having the right to vote.

Eutelsat IGO also ensures continuity of the rights to use radio frequencies of the ITU Radio regulations for the space segment which was transferred to Eutelsat S.A.

Other key activities of Eutelsat IGO include ongoing monitoring of the regulatory environment in European countries and continued collaboration with other international organisations. Eutelsat IGO has the status of an International Organization Operating Satellite Systems (IOOSS) in all three sectors of the ITU and the Executive Secretary and Secretariat participate regularly in International Telecommunication Union (ITU) activities and events of relevance to the Organisation. Since June 2008, Eutelsat IGO has also held permanent Observer status with the United Nations Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space (COPUOS). The current Executive Secretary of Eutelsat IGO is a Commissioner of the United Nations Broadband Commission for Digital Development and the Organisation is actively advocating for the work undertaken by the commission. The 2018 Report on the State of the Broadband issued in September 2018 featured a contribution from the satellite industry.

Annual tripartite meetings are organised between the Heads of Eutelsat IGO, International Telecommunications Satellite Organization (ITSO) and International Mobile Services Organization (IMSO) with a view to discuss matters of mutual interest and give further consideration for joint initiatives. On 15 May 2019, Eutelsat IGO signed an Agreement on Cooperation with Intersputnik giving the two organisations a mutual observer status. In addition, Eutelsat IGO holds Observer status in Regional Commonwealth (RCC) in the field of communications, an association of several former Soviet republics, which are now independent states.

== Structure ==
Eutelsat IGO consists of the Assembly of Parties to the Eutelsat Convention which meets ordinarily every two years and the Secretariat which is the permanent body of the Organisation. The Secretariat is headed by the Executive Secretary who is appointed for a four-year mandate by and is responsible to the Eutelsat IGO Assembly of Parties. The Executive Secretary is the legal representative of Eutelsat IGO and an observer (censeur) on the Board of Directors of Eutelsat S.A.

Piotr Dmochowski-Lipski of Poland was reelected to the post of Executive Secretary for a second term by the Assembly of Parties in March 2021.

He succeeded Christian Roisse of France, Executive Secretary from 2005 to 2017, and Birgitta Näslund of Sweden, Executive Secretary from 2001 to 2005.

<text>Children of Heaven () is a 1997 Iranian family drama film written and directed by Majid Majidi. The plot follows a brother and sister, and their adventures over a lost pair of shoes. It received positive reviews, and was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film in 1998.

==Plot==
Nine-year-old Ali fetches his six-year-old sister Zahra&#x27;s pink shoes after a cobbler has repaired them. While purchasing potatoes, Ali leaves the shoes, hidden in a bag outside among the vegetables. A homeless man unknowingly picks up the bag, thinking it is garbage. Frantic, Ali, thinking the shoes fell behind the crates, knocks over the display and is chased away by the grocer.

Ali&#x27;s family, living in a poor South Tehran neighbourhood, has financial troubles, so he fears telling his parents he has lost Zahra&#x27;s shoes. The landlord argues with Ali&#x27;s mother because she is five months behind on the rent, and the grocer has also not been paid in a while. Ali tells Zahra about the shoes and begs her not to tell their mother; she agrees. That night, Ali&#x27;s father scolds him for not helping his ill mother. As the siblings do their homework, they pass notes to each other discussing how to cope with their predicament. They ultimately devise a scheme to share Ali&#x27;s Converse sneakers: Zahra will wear them to school in the morning and return them to Ali at midday so he can wear them to his afternoon classes. Ali, among two others, scores high on a test, and his teacher awards him a gold-colored pen; he gives it to Zahra to partially make up for losing her shoes. However, the uncomfortable arrangement leads to Ali being late three times in a row, no matter how hard he runs; the first time, the principal ignores him, the second, he receives a warning, and the third, Ali is ordered to leave and return with his hardworking father. Ali&#x27;s teacher, noticing Ali&#x27;s tears, persuades the principal that Ali is the top of his class and to give the boy one more chance.

One day, Zahra notices her missing pink shoes on another student&#x27;s, Roya&#x27;s, feet. After class, Zahra secretly follows Roya home. She later brings Ali with her for a confrontation, but from hiding, they discover that Roya&#x27;s father is blind and leave without further action. When Roya does well in her studies, her father buys her new violet shoes and throws away Zahra&#x27;s. Zahra is dismayed when she finds out from her new friend.

Ali&#x27;s father, anxious to earn more, borrows some gardening equipment and heads off with Ali to the rich suburbs of North Tehran to find gardening work. They try many places without success, though Ali proves to be a great help to his tongue-tied father. They happen upon a mansion wherein a six-year-old boy named Alireza lives under the care of his grandfather. While Ali plays with Alireza, his father works. When finished, Ali&#x27;s father is surprised and elated by how generous the grandfather is. On the way home, Ali mentions in passing that Zahra could use a new pair of shoes; his father says that new shoes for his children are a good idea. However, their elation is short-lived as their bicycle&#x27;s brakes fail, and the father is injured in the resulting crash.

Finally, Ali learns of a high-profile children&#x27;s 4-kilometer footrace involving many schools in the province; the third prize is one week at a vacation camp and a pair of sneakers. Ali sees this as his chance to earn a new pair of shoes for Zahra. To his bitter disappointment, in a hard-fought dash to the finish, he accidentally places first. Ali returns home, where Zahra is waiting for him. However, before he can reveal to his sister his disappointment in his placement, she is called away by their mother. In a separate scene, there is a quick shot of the children&#x27;s father&#x27;s bicycle as he&#x27;s riding home, showing a pair of white and a pair of pink shoes among his purchases. In the final shot, Ali, dejected as his sneakers are torn from the race, is shown dipping his bare blistered feet in a pool.

Some versions include an epilogue, revealing that Ali eventually achieves success in a racing career.

&quot;Children of Heaven&quot; premiered in February 1997 at the Tehran Fajr Film Festival and was awarded several national film awards. It opened in the US on January 22, 1999, and earned a US box office total of $933,933. The worldwide total was $1,628,579.

===Critical reception===
Critical response to the film was highly positive. Some critics compared it to Vittorio de Sica&#x27;s &quot;Bicycle Thieves&quot; (1948). Roger Ebert&#x27;s review in the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; called it &quot;very nearly a perfect movie for children&quot; that &quot;lacks the cynicism and smart-mouth attitudes of so much American entertainment for kids and glows with a kind of good-hearted purity&quot;.

In 1998, it became the first Iranian film to be nominated for an Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film, losing to the Italian film &quot;Life Is Beautiful&quot; by Roberto Benigni. The majority of its US earnings came after the nomination was announced.

It competed for the Grand Prize at the American Film Institute&#x27;s festival of 1997.

While watching the film, Singaporean filmmaker Jack Neo and his wife were moved to &quot;holding hands and crying after seeing the love shared by the children&quot;. &quot;Children of Heaven&quot; inspired Neo to explore issues faced by Singaporean youths in his 2002 film &quot;I Not Stupid&quot;.

<doc id="916586" wikidata="Q5030106" url="?curid=916586" title="Canadian Home Video Rating System">
<text>The Canadian Home Video Rating System (CHVRS) is a voluntary rating classification system applied to films on VHS and DVDs. It is administered by the Motion Picture Classification Corporation of Canada, a subsidiary of the Motion Picture Association – Canada (MPA–C). Ratings are &quot;averaged&quot; from ones given by participating provincial film boards: Alberta, British Columbia (whose ratings are also followed in Manitoba and Saskatchewan), Maritimes (New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, and Prince Edward Island), and Ontario, and applied by the distributor to home video packaging.

== Canadian Home Video Ratings System ==

Canada has no federal rating system for the theatrical release of motion pictures; such controls lie in the jurisdiction of the provinces and is enacted through six film classification boards across the country. However this system for home video (on cassette, DVD, etc.) came into effect in May 1995, at the initiative of the Canadian Motion Picture Distributors Association and it works as a uniform Canadian ratings system.

Although the CHVRS is a voluntary industry classification some of the provinces have incorporated it into legislation regarding home video sales and rentals, and CHVRS labelling is found on most home video products sold in Canada. Saskatchewan, Manitoba, and the Maritime provinces have regulations requiring CHVRS labelling or the equivalent while British Columbia, Alberta, and Ontario do not, although most provinces have additional regulations regarding the labelling and display of adult video material.

In Quebec, a separate classification system is in effect under provincial law and administered by the Ministry of Culture and Communications (prior to 2017 administered by the Régie du cinéma). All home video products sold in the province must be appropriately labelled.

== Classifications ==


The CHV rating system is as follows:
== Information Pieces ==
Beginning in 2003, &quot;information pieces&quot; are applied depending on the pieces used by the provinces for a certain film. The information pieces are as follows:

Not Recommended For Young Children - The film may be inappropriate for young children. An example might be the death of a family pet, a complicated family breakdown, or images considered frightening or disturbing for the very young. 

Not Recommended For Children - The film may include scenes that reflect a more mature situation, such as drug use/abuse.

Frightening Scenes - The film contains images that might shock or frighten a person. These scenes might be found in a thriller, suspense, or war genre.

Mature Theme - Contains images or storylines that may be disturbing or incomprehensible to minors. The film may contain portrayals of domestic violence, racism, religious matters, death, or controversial social issues.

Coarse Language - Product contains profanity, threats, slurs, sexual references, or sexual innuendo.

Crude Content - Material or humour that is unrefined or coarse and that may be seen as harsh, rude, or offensive.

Nudity - Contains images of full frontal, partial, or rear nudity. Context will be determined by the situation, clarity, detail, repetition, and whether the nudity is in a non-sexual or sexual situation.

Sexual Content - Film may contain images and/or verbal references of sexual themes, sexual innuendo, fondling, implied sexual activity, and simulated sexual activity.

Violence - May contain restrained portrayals of non-graphic violence, portrayals of violence with some bloodletting and/or tissue damage, and frequent more prolonged portrayals of violence resulting in bloodletting and tissue damage. The degree, frequency and intensity of the acts of violence will be factors in the classification decision.

Disturbing Content - Indicates the expected natural reaction by an audience to any elements of a film, including the tone of a film, pertaining to distress or suffering. This includes the implication or threat of physical and/or psychological violence, even when violence is not depicted.

Substance Abuse - Descriptive scenes depicting the use of illegal substances, the excessive use of tobacco, or the use of alcohol resulting in impairment.

Gory Scenes - Graphic images of bloodletting and/or tissue damage. Includes horror or war representations. Degree, frequency, and intensity will also be a major factor in the classification decision. Any media with this category requires at least a 14A rating.

Explicit Sexual Content - Sexual acts, shown in full, clear, unequivocal, and realistic detail, that may or may not be gratuitous to the film. It is true that this category can only be used with the R rating.

Brutal Violence - Visually explicit portrayals of violence, which may be characterized by extreme brutality, extreme bloodletting, and/or extreme tissue damage. May include images of torture, horror, or war. This category is mostly used with the 18A rating or higher, however the 14A rating may use this category depending on the content level.

Sexual Violence - The degradation of an individual in a sexual manner. May contain images of non-consensual acts with the intent to inflict harm, for example: simulated rape, and/or the use of threat to force compliance in sexual activity.

Language May Offend - Contains language that may be offensive to some groups, i.e. sacrilegious language such as Goddamn; also used for PG films that contain explicatives.

== Process ==
In order to determine an average rating, a numerical value is applied to each of the five rating classifications. The eight participating provincial ratings are applied the appropriate numerical value and then an average is calculated. For example, if a film receives five 14As and three 18As, the numerical values would be 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, and 4 (the Maritimes count as three provinces, and Saskatchewan is counted separately from British Columbia) which gives an average of 3.4, which would equate to a 14A Canadian Home Video Rating.

== Notes ==

The rating symbols are embedded in the artwork or stickers applied to the packaging by the distributor. When the system was introduced in 1995, many of the provinces did not use a rating similar to the 18A (or in some cases, the R category). This results in numerous inconsistencies and misprints.

Home video ratings in Canada do not necessarily correspond with similar ratings in the United States or elsewhere. For example, sexually explicit series such as &quot;Girls&quot;, &quot;Orange is the New Black&quot;, and &quot;Shameless&quot;, all TV-MA rated under the U.S. system, are only rated 14A under the Canadian system. Other series with sexual and violent content, such as &quot;Bitten&quot; and &quot;Black Sails&quot; have been released to DVD and Blu-ray in Canada with no content rating at all.

<doc id="916587" wikidata="Q424631" url="?curid=916587" title="Polyvinyl butyral">
<text>Polyvinyl butyral (or PVB) is a resin mostly used for applications that require strong binding, optical clarity, adhesion to many surfaces, toughness and flexibility. It is prepared from polyvinyl alcohol by reaction with butyraldehyde. The major application is laminated safety glass for automobile windshields. Trade names for PVB-films include KB PVB, GUTMANN PVB, Saflex, GlasNovations, Butacite, WINLITE, S-Lec, Trosifol and EVERLAM. PVB is also available as 3D printer filament that is stronger and more heat resistant than polylactic acid (PLA).

==Applications==

===Automotive and architectural===
Laminated glass, commonly used in the automotive and architectural fields, comprises a protective interlayer, usually polyvinyl butyral, bonded between two panels of glass. The bonding process takes place under heat and pressure. When laminated under these conditions, the PVB interlayer becomes optically clear and binds the two panes of glass together. Once sealed together, the glass &quot;sandwich&quot; (i.e., laminate) behaves as a single unit and looks like normal glass. The polymer interlayer of PVB is tough and ductile, so brittle cracks will not pass from one side of the laminate to the other.

===Colors===
PVB interlayer can be manufactured in colored sheets, such as for the blue or green &quot;shade band&quot; at the top edge of many automobile windshields. PVB interlayers can also be manufactured in different colors for architectural laminated glass.

===Solar modules===
PVB has gained acceptance among manufacturers of photovoltaic thin film solar modules. The photovoltaic circuit is formed on a sheet of glass using thin film deposition and patterning techniques. PVB and a second sheet of glass (called back glass) are then placed directly on the circuit. The lamination of this sandwich encapsulates the circuit, protecting it from the environment. Current is extracted from the module at a sealed terminal box that is attached to the circuit through a hole in the back glass. Another common laminant used in the solar industry is ethylene-vinyl acetate (EVA).

===Non-film applications===
PVB resins (provided by the manufacturer in powdered or granulated form) are also utilized in a range of applications including technical ceramic (temporary) binders, inks, dye transfer ribbon inks, paints &amp; coatings (including wash primers), binders for reflective sheet and binders for magnetic media. PVB resin is particularly useful at bonding to metals, ceramics and other inorganics.

==Properties of PVB-laminated glass==
Annealed glass, heat-strengthened, or tempered glass can be used to produce laminated glass. While laminated glass will crack if struck with sufficient force, the resulting glass fragments tend to adhere to the interlayer rather than falling free and potentially causing injury.

In practice, the interlayer provides three beneficial properties to laminated glass panes: first, the interlayer functions to distribute impact forces across a greater area of the glass panes, thus increasing the impact resistance of the glass; second, the interlayer functions to bind the resulting shards if the glass is ultimately broken; third the viscoelastic interlayer undergoes plastic deformation during impact and under static loads after impact, absorbing energy and reducing penetration by the impacting object as well as reducing the energy of the impact that is transmitted to impacting object, e.g. a passenger in a car crash. Thus, the benefits of laminated glass include safety and security. Laminated glass also has decorative applications. The interlayer can be colored or patterned.

==History==
PVB was invented in 1927 by the Canadian chemists Howard W. Matheson and Frederick W. Skirrow. PVB has been the dominant interlayer material since the late 1930s. It is manufactured and marketed by a number of companies worldwide, including:

* Saflex made by Eastman in Kingsport, Tennessee
*S-Lec films and powdered resins made by Sekisui in Kyoto, Japan, Winchester, Kentucky, Geleen &amp; Roermond, The Netherlands and Cuernavaca, Mexico 
*Kuraray Europe GmbH manufactures Trosifol and Mowital / Pioloform PVB products in Frankfurt, Germany
*Chang Chung Petrochemicals Co. Ltd of Taiwan manufactures WINLITE brand PVB products
*EVERLAM in Hamm-Uentrop, Germany markets its eponymous Everlam brand

The market for laminated glass products is mature. With only minor modifications, the PVB interlayer sold today is essentially identical to the PVB sold 30 years ago. Since its introduction in 1938, the worldwide market for PVB interlayer has been dominated by a handful of large chemical companies. As a result, inventive efforts have tended toward methods of making the interlayer itself cheaper to manufacture, or making the interlayer easier to handle and less prone to material defects during the process of fabricating laminated glass.

==Other interlayer materials==
Other types of interlayer materials are in use, including polyurethanes such as Duraflex-brand thermoplastic polyurethane film, manufactured by Bayer MaterialScience, Leverkusen, Germany.

<text>George Price (June 9, 1901 – January 12, 1995) was an American cartoonist who was born in Fort Lee, New Jersey. After doing advertising artwork in his youth, Price started doing cartoons for &quot;The New Yorker&quot; magazine in 1929. He continued contributing to the &quot;New Yorker&quot; well into his eighties, displaying a talent for both graphic innovation (many of his cartoons consisted of a single, unending line) and for a wit that somehow combined the small issues of domestic life with a topical sensibility.

Born on June 9, 1901, in the Coytesville section of Fort Lee, New Jersey, Price lived in nearby Tenafly and died on January 12, 1995, at Englewood Hospital and Medical Center.

<doc id="916590" wikidata="Q4887898" url="?curid=916590" title="Mission creep">
<text>Mission creep is the gradual or incremental expansion of an intervention, project or mission, beyond its original scope, focus or goals, a ratchet effect spawned by initial success. Mission creep is usually considered undesirable due to how each success breeds more ambitious interventions until a final failure happens, stopping the intervention entirely. 

The term was originally applied exclusively to military operations, but has recently been applied to many other fields, making the phrase autological. The phrase first appeared in 1993, in articles published in &quot;The Washington Post&quot; and in &quot;The New York Times&quot; concerning the United Nations peacekeeping mission during the Somali Civil War.

==History==

===Somali Civil War===
The first two articles to use the term in the &quot;Washington Post&quot; were both by columnist Jim Hoagland (&quot;Prepared for Non-Combat&quot;, April 15, 1993, and &quot;Beware &#x27;mission creep&#x27; In Somalia&quot;, July 20, 1993). The &quot;New York Times&quot; used the term for the first time in an article by correspondent John H. Cushman, Jr. written after the October 4, 1993 firefight in the capital of Somalia, Mogadishu, in which eighteen American military personnel were killed.

The U.S. and subsequent United Nations mission in Somalia (Restore Hope) would seem to be a classic example of mission creep. Begun in late 1992 as a U.S. humanitarian relief operation in the final months of the George H. W. Bush administration, the intervention was converted into a U.N. operation on June 4, 1993. While the initial Bush administration justification for entering Somalia focused on &quot;humanitarian assistance,&quot; realities on the ground helped drive ever growing requirements. On June 5, 1993, Somali warlord Mohamed Farrah Aidid&#x27;s clan forces killed 23 Pakistani peacekeepers who were part of the UNISOM II mission. This battle led to a UN Security Council decision seeking to capture those responsible for the deaths of the Pakistani peacekeepers. Along with growing objectives seeking longer term stability (rather than short-term humanitarian assistance), the search for Aidid fostered a more confrontational environment through the summer of 1993. In October 1993, 18 American soldiers died in the Battle of Mogadishu. This incident led to a much more defensive U.S. and UN presence in Somalia. U.S. forces withdrew in early 1994 and all UN forces were withdrawn in late February and early March 1995 during Operation United Shield.

===First Libyan Civil War===
In the context of the First Libyan Civil War, the phrase was used frequently with regard to the intervention on the part of the multi-state coalition. It appeared as early as March 7, 2011, when a Reuters article wrote that Britain&#x27;s vision of a no-fly zone over the country would be &quot;likely to experience &#x27;mission creep&#x27; and move closer to American thinking on the need to target (Libyan leader) Gaddafi&#x27;s defenses&quot;. On March 31, 2011, with the campaign in its second week, U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates told a Senate hearing that &quot;I am preoccupied with avoiding mission creep and avoiding having an open-ended, very large-scale American commitment in this respect&quot;. A joint article written by the leaders of the United Kingdom, United States and France that appeared on April 14, 2011, stated that Gaddafi &quot;must go, and for good&quot;. Some British MPs warned that this statement represented mission creep, as it exceeded the parameters of UN Resolution 1973, which stressed humanitarian objectives and did not include regime change as a stated goal.

===Retroactive applications of the term===
Although the term mission creep is a 1990s invention, examples can be observed throughout military history. For instance, many of the wars of Louis XIV&#x27;s France began with small limited goals, but quickly escalated to much larger affairs.

Another early example of mission creep is the Korean War. It began as an attempt to save South Korea from invasion by the North, but after that initial success expanded to an attempt to reunite the peninsula, a goal that eventually proved unattainable. That attempt resulted in a long and costly retreat through North Korea after the intervention of the Chinese. NBC reporter David Gregory has cited the Vietnam War as an important example of mission creep, defining it as &quot;the idea of, you know, gradually surging up forces, having nation-building goals, and running into challenges all along the way.&quot;

In 1956, Aneurin Bevan, politician and architect of Britain&#x27;s National Health Service, gave a speech before the House of Commons on December 5 against Britain&#x27;s mission creep in the Suez Crisis against Egypt. &quot;I have been looking through the various objectives and reasons that the government have given to the House of Commons for making war on Egypt, and it really is desirable that when a nation makes war upon another nation it should be quite clear why it does so. It should not keep changing the reasons as time goes on.&quot; The speech was considered one of the 14 greatest speeches of the 20th century by &quot;The Guardian&quot;, along with speeches by Churchill, Kennedy, and Mandela. Eventually the United States, the Soviet Union, and the United Nations played major roles in forcing Britain, France and Israel to withdraw from Egypt.

===Non-military examples===
Another example of a non-military use of the term mission creep is in connection with fusion centers. Fusion centers were originally created as a counter-terrorism measure in the wake of the September 11 attacks in 2001 via the Department of Homeland Security. Fusion centers were intended to facilitate the collaboration and sharing of information across various levels of government and private sector entities connected with Americas&#x27;s critical infrastructures. By 2011 there were 72 fusion centers in the United States. Fusion centers have been criticized for sharing information on crimes other than terrorism - potentially violating the civil rights of American citizens - which has been described as mission creep.

The International Monetary Fund, founded to maintain fixed exchange rates for developed countries, transitioned to funding developing countries in the 1970s. In 2005, scholars Sarah Babb and Ariel Buira remarked that the evolving goals of the IMF represented mission creep.

Within recent decades U.S. police forces (and SWAT teams in particular) have become increasingly militarized and expanded in focus in a manner described by &quot;The Economist&quot; as mission creep.

<text>Imola (; or ) is a city and &quot;comune&quot; in the Metropolitan City of Bologna, located on the river Santerno, in the Emilia-Romagna region of northern Italy. The city is traditionally considered the western entrance to the historical region Romagna.

The city is best-known as the home of the Autodromo Enzo e Dino Ferrari which hosts the Formula One Emilia Romagna Grand Prix and formerly hosted the San Marino Grand Prix, named after the independent nation of San Marino around 100 km to the south. 

== History ==
Sometime around 82 BCE, the Roman dictator L. Cornelius Sulla founded the city, which was originally known eponymously in ancient times as &quot;Forum Cornelii&quot; (&quot;Forum of Cornelius&quot;). The city was an agricultural and trading centre, famous for its ceramics.

The name Imola was first used in the 7th century by the Lombards, who applied it to the fortress (the present Castellaccio, the construction of which is attributed to the Lombard Clefi), whence the name passed to the city itself. According to Paul the Deacon, Imola was in 412 the scene of the marriage of Ataulf, King of the Visigoths, to Galla Placidia, daughter of Emperor Theodosius the Great. In the Gothic War (535–552), and after the Lombard invasion, it was held alternately by the Byzantines and barbarians.

With the exarchate of Ravenna, it passed under papal authority. In the ninth century, Fausto Alidosi defended the city against the Saracens and Hungarians. In the tenth century, Troilo Nordiglio acquired great power. This and the following centuries witnessed incessant wars against the Ravennatese, the Faentines and the Bolognese, as well as the internecine struggles of the Castrimolesi (from &quot;Castro Imolese&quot;, &quot;castle of Imola&quot;) and the &quot;Sancassianesi&quot; (from San Cassiano). Amid these conflicts, the republican constitution of the city was created. In the contest between pope and emperor, Imola was generally Ghibelline, though it often returned to the popes (e.g. in 1248). Several times, powerful lords attempted to obtain the mastery of the city (Alidosi, 1292; Maghinardo Pagano, 1295). Pope Benedict XII turned the city and its territory over to Lippo II Alidosi with the title of pontifical vicar, the power remaining in the family Alidosi until 1424, when the condottiero Angelo della Pergola, &quot;capitano&quot; for Filippo Maria Visconti, gained the supremacy (see also Wars in Lombardy). In 1426 the city was restored to the Holy See, and the legate (later Cardinal) Capranica inaugurated a new regime in public affairs.

Various condottieri later ruled in the city, such as the Visconti; several landmark fortresses remain from this period. In 1434, 1438, and 1470, Imola was conferred on the Sforza, who had become dukes of Milan (Lombardy). It was again brought under papal authority when it was bestowed as dowry on Caterina Sforza, the bride of Girolamo Riario, nephew of Pope Sixtus IV. Riario was invested with the Principality of Forlì and Imola. This proved advantageous to Imola, which was embellished with beautiful palaces and works of art (e.g. in the cathedral, the tomb of Girolamo, murdered in 1488 by conspirators of Forli). The rule of the Riarii, however, was brief, as Pope Alexander VI deprived the son of Girolamo, Ottaviano, of power, and on 25 November 1499, the city surrendered to Cesare Borgia. After his death, two factions, that of Galeazzo Riario and that of the Church, competed for control of the city. The ecclesiastical party was victorious, and in 1504 Imola submitted to Pope Julius II. The last trace of these contests was a bitter enmity between the Vaini and Sassatelli families.

In 1797, the revolutionary French forces established a provisional government at Imola. In 1799, it was occupied by the Austrians, and in 1800, it was united to the Cisalpine Republic. After Napoleon&#x27;s defeat in 1815, The Congress of Vienna returned Imola to the papacy, where it would remain until joining itself to the rapidly expanding Kingdom of Sardinia in 1860 (which became the Kingdom of Italy the following year).

== Sport ==

The main sport venue in Imola is the Imola Circuit, which was opened in the 1950s and holds many racing events every year. The circuit has hosted Formula One in the 1980 Italian Grand Prix, from 1981 to 2006 as part of the San Marino Grand Prix and from 2020 as part of the Emilia Romagna Grand Prix. The city has dedicated multiple memorials and public spaces to Ayrton Senna and Roland Ratzenberger, who lost their lives in the circuit during the 1994 San Marino Grand Prix. The death of Senna was an event that shocked the sporting world and led to heightened Formula One safety standards.

The city has hosted multiple international and national cycling events like the 1968 UCI Road World Championships, 2020 UCI Road World Championships and 2021 Italian National Road Race Championships.

The city has two professional basketball teams, Virtus Imola (founded in 1936) and Andrea Costa Imola (founded in 1967). Both of them play in the &quot;PalaRuggi&quot; sports hall.

The city&#x27;s professional soccer team, Imolese Calcio 1919, plays in a stadium located inside the Circuit, &quot;Stadio Romeo Galli&quot;.

The city has two swimming pools and from 2020 until 2024 will host the Italian Federal breaststroke swimming training center.

== Main sights ==
*&quot;Imola Circuit &quot;(Imola Circuit)
*&quot;Rocca Sforzesca &quot;(Sforza Castle), built under the reign of Girolamo Riario and Caterina Sforza. Now houses a Cinema d&#x27;Estate which shows films in July and August. It also is the location of the world-famous International Piano Academy &quot;Incontri col Maestro&quot;, founded in 1989 by Franco Scala.
*&quot;Palazzo Tozzoni&quot; (Tozzoni&#x27;s Mansion), built between 1726 and 1738 by the architect Domenico Trifogli, civic art museum since 1981.
*&quot;Duomo&quot; (cathedral), dedicated to San Cassiano. Erected from 1187 to 1271, it was repeatedly restored in the following centuries, until a large renovation was held in 1765–1781. The façade dates to 1850.
*&quot;Convento dell&#x27;Osservanza&quot;, including the church of &quot;San Michele&quot; from 1472, to which later a convent with two cloisters was added. It houses a sarcophagus of Lucrezia Landriani (1496), mother of Caterina Sforza. The interior has a nave and an aisles, finished in 1942; it houses a fresco attributed to Guidaccio da Imola (1472). In the apse is a Byzantine-style crucifix from the 15th century. The first cloister, dating to 1590, had originally 35 frescoes of stories of St. Francis, 15 of which went lost. In the garden annexed to the church is a precious &quot;Pietà&quot; in terracotta of late-15th century Bolognese or Faenza school.
*&quot;Santuario della Beata Vergine del Piratello&quot; and &quot;Cimitero del Piratello&quot;. On 27 March 1483 a pilgrim named Stefano Manganelli witnessed a miracle at Piratello in which a vision of the Madonna requested that the people of Imola build her a shrine, leading to the establishment of a monastery and the Santuario della Beata Vergine. The monastery was dissolved during the Napoleonic suppressions of the early 1800s The &quot;Cimitero del Piratello&quot; was authorized in 1817 and opened several years later, occupying the former convent cloisters adjacent to the Santuario (designated a Basilica by Pope Pius XII in 1954). The cemetery was further developed in 1916 with the addition of the Campo Monumentale.

Other buildings include the Farsetti and the Communal palaces. In the latter is a fresco representing Clement VII and Charles V (1535) passing through the city. The public library was established in 1747 by the Conventual priest Setti. In the 16th century, the Accademia degli Industriosi flourished.

===Green areas===
*The Acque Minerali Park, located next to Santerno river, on the hills of the city. The park was established in the early 20th century; the discovery of mineral water occurred in 1830.
*The Tozzoni Park, located on a big hilly area on the side of the city; it became a public area in 1978. The Tozzoni family bought the park in 1882 and used it as a hunting reserve, naming it &quot;Parco del Monte&quot; (Italian: &quot;Park of the Mountain&quot;).

<doc id="916602" wikidata="Q482793" url="?curid=916602" title="Newtype">
<text>is a monthly magazine originating from Japan covering anime and, to a lesser extent, manga, &quot;seiyū&quot;, science fiction, &quot;tokusatsu&quot;, and video games. It was launched by publishing company Kadokawa Shoten on March 8, 1985, and has since been released in Japan on the 10th of every month. 

&quot;Newtype Korea&quot; was formerly published in Korea. Spin-off publications of &quot;Newtype&quot; also exist in Japan, such as &quot;Newtype Hero&quot; and &quot;Newtype the Live,&quot; which are dedicated to &quot;tokusatsu,&quot; and &quot;NewWORDS,&quot; which is geared toward a more adult market, as well as numerous limited-run versions such as &quot;Clamp Newtype&quot;. An English language version, &quot;Newtype USA&quot;, was published in North America between 2002 and 2008.

The magazine&#x27;s name comes from the &quot;Newtypes&quot; in the Universal Century timeline of the &quot;Gundam&quot; series, specifically &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam&quot; (1979) and its sequel &quot;Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam&quot; (1985). &quot;Newtype&quot; launched a week after &quot;Zeta Gundam&quot; began airing on March 2, 1985.

==Content==
===Columns===
&quot;Newtype&quot; runs several columns per month, typically written by creators within the anime and manga industries. Past and current contributors include Satsuki Igarashi (of Clamp), Mahiro Maeda, and Gilles Poitras. &quot;Newtype USA&quot; included columns from more history-minded writers (such as Jonathan Clements) as well as individuals involved in the US anime industry (such as Monica Rial).

===Manga===
&quot;Newtype&quot; usually contains a center insert with regularly serialized manga (often to be later published in tankōbon form by Kadokawa). The magazine is perhaps best known in Japan for serializing Mamoru Nagano&#x27;s &quot;The Five Star Stories&quot;.

Manga serialized in &quot;Newtype USA&quot; varied due to licensing reasons. They had included &quot;Full Metal Panic!&quot;, &quot;Angel/Dust&quot;, &quot;Chrono Crusade&quot;, &quot;Lagoon Engine Einsatz&quot;, &quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion: Angelic Days&quot;, the &quot;Aoi House 4-koma&quot;, &quot;Angel/Dust Neo&quot;, and &quot;Kobato.&quot; only several of which actually appeared in the Japanese &quot;Newtype&quot;.

===Fiction===
Light novels have also been serialized within the Japanese version of the magazine in the past: these have included &quot;For the Barrel&quot; (an abstract adaptation of the &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam&quot; novel trilogy); a novelization of &quot;Overman King Gainer&quot; (accompanied by illustrations from the show&#x27;s character designer, Kinu Nishimura); and the Yoshiyuki Tomino story &quot;Gaia Gear&quot;, set in the far future of &quot;Gundam&quot;″s Universal Century timeline.

===Television schedule===
A large insert within the magazine usually contains a television schedule for anime and tokusatsu programs set to run on various Japanese networks throughout the coming month, accompanied by synopses for each aired episode and network ratings for each show from the previous month.

===Art-related material===
&quot;Newtype&quot; contains a tip column for working with computer graphics in manga-style illustration, written by a different guest illustrator (or group of illustrators, in some cases) each month. The column generally centers around working with Adobe Photoshop and Corel Painter.

In the Japanese version (and in the early months of the American version), the last page of &quot;Newtype&quot; is usually reserved for one of a series of art pieces or illustrations (accompanied by comment or short column) from a known anime illustrator. Perhaps the best known of these is the &quot;GUNDAM FIX&quot; illustration series by Hajime Katoki, which placed mecha from the Gundam franchise within real-world photographic contexts. Other illustrators who have contributed to this back page in the past include Yoshikazu Yasuhiko (who ran a series of illustrations devoted to &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam: The Origin&quot;) and Hisashi Hirai (who ran a series devoted to his designs for &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam SEED&quot;, titled &quot;Gundam SEED RGB&quot;).

==International versions==
&quot;Newtype USA&quot; included both translated Japanese content and original U.S. material. Content included anime, manga, music, game, toy and model reviews, director interviews, artist profiles, and regular columns by industry experts, tastemakers and deep-cover insiders. &quot;Newtype USA&quot; also included bonus content, such as posters, postcards, a centerfold spread, serialized manga, and a DVD insert. &quot;Newtype USA&quot; was published by A.D. Vision, parent company of the anime distributor ADV Films and manga publisher ADV Manga, but the magazine still featured content and promotional material from properties distributed by competing publishers. About 70% of the material is translated from the Japanese release, including matching cover and front story, and articles from American writers. Subscriptions on initial release were expected to hit 50,000.

The first &quot;Newtype USA&quot; issue was published in November 2002 (a preview issue of Newtype USA featuring RahXephon was distributed selectively at anime and comic conventions in the late summer of 2002). and ended publication after the February 2008 issue. After its initial print run, sealed polybagged back issues of Newtype USA are considered highly collectible. It was replaced in 2008 with &quot;PiQ&quot; magazine, which ceased publication after four issues.

&quot;Newtype&quot; was also published in South Korea by Daiwon C.I. under the name &quot;Newtype Korea&quot;. The first issue was released in July 1999, and the magazine lasted until June 2015 when the last issue was published. The magazine included translated Japanese content, with added emphasis on domestic Korean animation projects. Daiwon C.I. also used the Newtype branding for a line of imported Japanese animation DVDs and light novels, called &quot;Newtype DVD&quot; and &quot;Newtype Light Novel&quot;, respectively. Both the original Japanese and English editions used the &quot;right-to-left&quot; format while the Korean edition is reversed.

<text>Carlos Polestico Garcia (; November 4, 1896 – June 14, 1971), often referred to by his initials CPG, was a Filipino teacher, poet, orator, lawyer, public official, political economist, guerrilla and Commonwealth military leader who was the eighth President of the Philippines from 1957 to 1961. He previously served as the fourth Vice President of the Philippines from 1953 to 1957. 

A lawyer by profession, Garcia entered politics when he became the representative of Bohol’s 3rd district in the House of Representatives. He then served as a senator from 1945 to 1953. 

He was the Nacionalista Party&#x27;s nominee for vice president as the running mate of Ramon Magsaysay in the presidential election of 1953, which they won. After the death of Magsaysay in 1957, he succeeded to the presidency, winning a full term in his own right in the presidential election that same year. He was subsequently defeated by his vice president Diosdado Macapagal in the 1961 presidential election.

==Early life and education==
Garcia was born in Talibon, Bohol, Philippines on November 4, 1896, to Policronio Garcia and Ambrosia Polestico, who were both natives of Bangued, Abra.

Garcia grew up with politics, with his father serving as a municipal mayor for four terms. He acquired his primary education in his native town Talibon, then took his secondary education in Cebu Provincial High School, now Abellana National School, both at the top of his class. Initially, he pursued his college education at Silliman University in Dumaguete, Negros Oriental, and later studied at the Philippine Law School, then the College of Law of National University, where he earned his law degree in 1923 and later, where he was awarded the honorary degree Doctor of Humanities, &quot;Honoris Causa&quot; from the National University in 1961. He also received an honorary doctorate degree from Tokyo University in Japan. He was among the top ten law students in the 1923 bar examination.

Rather than practicing law right away, he worked as a teacher for two years at Bohol Provincial High School. He became famous for his poetry in Bohol, where he earned the nickname &quot;Prince of Visayan Poets&quot; and the &quot;Bard from Bohol.&quot;

==Political career==
Garcia entered politics in 1925, scoring an impressive victory to become representative of the third district of Bohol. He was elected for another term in 1928 and served until 1931. He was elected governor of Bohol in 1933, but served only until 1941 when he successfully ran for Senate, but he was unable to serve due to the Japanese occupation of the Philippines during World War II. He assumed the office when Congress re-convened in 1945 after Allied liberation and the end of the war. When he resumed duties as senator after the war, he was chosen Senate majority floor leader. The press consistently voted him as one of the most outstanding senators. Simultaneously, he occupied a position in the Nacionalista Party.

== Vice-presidency (1953–1957) ==


Garcia was the running mate of Ramon Magsaysay in the 1953 presidential election in which both men won. He was appointed secretary of foreign affairs by President Magsaysay, and for four years served concurrently as vice-president.

Garcia acted as chairman of the eight-nation Southeast Asian Security Conference held in Manila in September 1954, which led to the development of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization (SEATO).

== Presidency (1957–1961) ==


===Accession===
At the time of President Magsaysay&#x27;s sudden death due to an airplane crash on March 17, 1957, Garcia was heading the Philippine delegation to the SEATO conference then being held at Canberra, Australia. Having been immediately notified of the tragedy, Vice President Garcia enplaned back for Manila. Upon his arrival, he directly reported to Malacañang Palace to assume the duties of president. Chief Justice Ricardo Paras of the Supreme Court administered the oath of office, which took place at 5:56 PM PHT on March 18, 1957. President Garcia&#x27;s first actions were to declare a period of national mourning and to preside over the burial ceremonies for Magsaysay.

===1957 presidential election===
President Garcia won a full term as president with a landslide win in the national elections of November 12, 1957. Garcia, the Nacionalista candidate, garnered around 2.07 million votes or 41% of the total votes counted, defeating his closest rival, Jose Y. Yulo of the Liberal Party. His running mate, House Speaker Jose B. Laurel Jr., lost to Pampanga 1st district Representative Diosdado Macapagal. This was the first time in Philippine electoral history where a president was elected by a plurality rather than a majority, and in which the winning presidential and vice-presidential candidates came from different parties. Garcia took his oath of office on December 30, 1957, at the Independence Grandstand in Manila, commencing his second consecutive and only full term. The oath of office was administered by Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the Philippines Ricardo Paras. Juan Pajo, the then-governor of Bohol, held the Bible which Garcia took oath on, breaking the tradition wherein it is held by presidential spouses.

=== Administration and cabinet ===
===Anti-Communism===
After much discussion, both official and public, the Congress of the Philippines, finally, approved a bill outlawing the Philippine Communist Party. Despite the pressure exerted against the congressional measure, Garcia signed the aforementioned bill into law as Republic Act No. 1700 or the Anti-Subversion Act on June 19, 1957.

The act was superseded by Presidential Decree No. 885, entitled &quot;Outlawing Subversive Organization, Penalizing Membership Therein and For Other Purposes&quot;, and was later amended by Presidential Decree No. 1736 and later superseded by Presidential Decree No. 1835, entitled, &quot;Codifying The Various Laws on Anti-Subversion and Increasing the Penalties for Membership in Subversive Organization.&quot; This, in turn, was amended by Presidential Decree No. 1975. On May 5, 1987, Executive Order No. 167 repealed Presidential Decrees No. 1835 and No. 1975 as being unduly restrictive of the constitutional right to form associations.

On September 22, 1992, Republic Act No. 1700, as amended, was repealed by Republic Act No. 7636 during the administration of Fidel V. Ramos, which legalized the Communist Party of the Philippines, other underground movements and subversion, though sedition remained a crime.

===Economy===
The Garcia administration&#x27;s pro-nationalist stance on the country&#x27;s economy was disliked by foreign countries especially by the United States. To counter Garcia&#x27;s economic controls, as early as 1957, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) pressured the Philippines that if the country did not lift their controls, then the Philippines shall not receive any loans from the IMF. According to central bank governor Miguel Cuaderno Sr., the United States rejected the Philippines&#x27; request for a stabilization loan of 25 million USD. The passage of the &quot;Filipino First Policy&quot; further worsened the relations of the U.S. with the Philippines.

====Filipino First policy====

Garcia exercised the &quot;Filipino First Policy&quot;, for which he was known. This policy heavily favored Filipino businessmen over foreign investors. He was also responsible for changes in retail trade which greatly affected the Chinese businessmen in the country. In a speech during a joint session of Congress on September 18, 1946, Garcia said the following:

Despite deteriorating relations with the U.S. as a result of this policy, the Philippines utilized it to induce industrialization and put Filipinos in control of industry and economy. The Philippines&#x27; manufacturing sector grew to 29 percent per year from 1949 to 1960. The manufacturing sector was considered the fastest growing sector accounting for 8.1 percent of the Philippine economy in 1949 to 17.7 percent by 1960. During his term, a wider push for machinery was introduced, especially by nationalist entrepreneurs and the industrial working class.

===Foreign relations===

Unlike his predecessor, Ramon Magsaysay, Garcia adopted a pro-Asia stance. He supported the establishment of the Association of Southeast Asia (ASA) along with Malaya and Thailand. To expand membership of the association, original members, including the Philippines under Garcia, deliberately deleted provisions from the 1961 Bangkok Declaration that contained Cold War content.

====Bohlen–Serrano Agreement====
During his administration, he acted on the Bohlen–Serrano Agreement, which shortened the lease of the American military bases from 99 years to 25 years and made it renewable after every five years. This favored non-U.S. aligned Asian countries including China. Aside from that, Garcia also forged close relations with Asian U.S. allies like Taiwan, South Korea, and Japan. However, these moves by the Philippines did not sit well with the U.S.

===Austerity program===
In the face of the trying conditions in the country, Garcia initiated what has been called &quot;The Austerity Program&quot;. His administration was characterized by its austerity program and its insistence on a comprehensive nationalist policy. On March 3, 1960, he affirmed the need for complete economic freedom and added that the government no longer would tolerate the dominance of foreign interests (especially American) in the national economy. He promised to shake off &quot;the yoke of alien domination in business, trade, commerce and industry&quot;. Garcia was also credited with his role in reviving Filipino cultural arts. The main points of the Austerity Program were:

# The government&#x27;s tightening up of its controls to prevent abuses in the over shipment of exports under license and in under-pricing as well.
# A more rigid enforcement of the existing regulations on barter shipments.
# Restriction of government imports to essential items.
# Reduction of rice imports to minimum. 
# An overhauling of the local transportation system to reduce the importation of gasoline and spare parts.
# The revision of the tax system to attain more equitable distribution of the payment-burden and achieve more effective collection from those with ability to pay.
# An intensification of food production.

The program was hailed by the people at large and confidence was expressed that the measures proposed would help solve the standing problems of the Republic.

===Hydroelectric power development===
The Garcia administration had ambitious plans to develop the hydroelectric potential of the Philippines. The first in Mindanao which aimed to boost the Maria Cristina Falls from 100,000 to 750,000 kilowatts for an industrial complex in Iligan. The second, on the Angat River in Central Luzon, is near Manila which will provide 230,000 kilowatts to support a new industrial complex, costing 20 million USD. The third project on the Agno River in Northern Luzon which aimed to electrify rural areas, while smaller hydroelectric projects in the Visayan Islands will be funded locally.

=== Creation of the International Rice Research Institute ===
President Garcia, with the strong advocacy of Agriculture and Natural Resources Secretary Juan G. Rodriguez, invited the Ford Foundation and the Rockefeller Foundation &quot;to establish a rice research institute&quot; in Los Baños, Laguna. This led to the establishment of the International Rice Research Institute in 1960.

=== Republic Cultural Award ===
In addition to his laws and programs, the Garcia administration also put emphasis on reviving the Filipino culture. In doing so, the Republic Cultural Award was created. To this day, the award is being given to Filipino artists, scientists, historians, and writers.

===Opposition===
The Garcia administration faced opposition from the U.S. and Magsaysay supporters. The United States campaigned against Garcia accusing his administration of rampant corruption. Magsaysay supporters, on the other hand, wanted to restore the &quot;spirit of Magsaysay’s honest and energetic administration&quot;. Magsaysay supporters were divided into two parties: the Progressive Party and the Liberal Party.

===1961 presidential election===

At the end of his second term, he ran for re–election in the presidential elections of November 14, 1961, but was defeated by Vice President Diosdado Macapagal, who belonged to the rival Liberal Party.

== Post-presidency and death (1961–1971) ==

After his failed re-election bid, Garcia retired to Tagbilaran to resume life as a private citizen.

On June 1, 1971, Garcia was elected delegate of the 1971 Constitutional Convention, where delegates elected him as president of the convention. However, on June 14, 1971, Garcia died from a heart attack on 5:57 p.m. at his Manila residence along Bohol Avenue (now Sergeant Esguerra Avenue), Quezon City.

Garcia was the first layman to lie in state in Manila Cathedral—a privilege once reserved for the Archbishops of Manila—and the first president to be buried at the Libingan ng mga Bayani.

==Family==
On May 24, 1933, he married Leonila Dimataga. The couple had a daughter, Linda Garcia-Campos.

<text>In vascular diseases, endothelial dysfunction is a systemic pathological state of the endothelium. The main cause of endothelial dysfunction is impaired bioavailability of nitric oxide.

In addition to acting as a semipermeable membrane, the endothelium is responsible for maintaining vascular tone and regulating oxidative stress by releasing mediators, such as nitric oxide, prostacyclin and endothelin, and by controlling local angiotensin-II activity.

Dysfunctional endothelium is characterized by vasoconstriction, increased vascular permeability, thrombosis, and inflammation. This pathological state is often associated with elevated levels of biomarkers such as prothrombin time, D-dimer, von Willebrand factor, fibrin degradation products, C-reactive protein (CRP), ferritin, Interleukin 6 (IL-6), and plasma creatinine. The result of this endothelial dysregulation is a cascade of adverse effects, including vasoconstriction, vascular leakage, thrombosis, hyperinflammation, and a disrupted antiviral immune response. These changes contribute to the progression of vascular diseases.

In a healthy state, the endothelium exhibits vasodilation, tightly controlled vascular permeability, and anti-thrombotic and anti-inflammatory properties. This balance ensures the smooth functioning of the vascular system.

=== Atherosclerosis ===

Endothelial dysfunction may be involved in the development of atherosclerosis and may predate vascular pathology. Endothelial dysfunction may also lead to increased adherence of monocytes and macrophages, as well as promoting infiltration of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) in the vessel wall. Oxidized LDL is a hallmark feature of atherosclerosis, by promoting the formation of foam cells, monocyte chemotaxis, and platelet activation, leading to atheromatous plaque instability and ultimately to rupture. Dyslipidemia and hypertension are well known to contribute to endothelial dysfunction, and lowering blood pressure and LDL has been shown to improve endothelial function, particularly when lowered with ACE inhibitors, calcium channel blockers, and statins. Steadily laminar flow with high shear stress in blood vessels protects against atherosclerosis, whereas disturbed flow promotes atherosclerosis.

===Nitric oxide===
Nitric oxide (NO) suppresses platelet aggregation, inflammation, oxidative stress, vascular smooth muscle cell migration and proliferation, and leukocyte adhesion. A feature of endothelial dysfunction is the inability of arteries and arterioles to dilate fully in response to an appropriate stimulus, such as exogenous nitroglycerine, that stimulates release of vasodilators from the endothelium like NO. Endothelial dysfunction is commonly associated with decreased NO bioavailability, which is due to impaired NO production by the endothelium or inactivation of NO by reactive oxygen species. As a co-factor for nitric oxide synthase, tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) supplementation has shown beneficial results for the treatment of endothelial dysfunction in animal experiments and clinical trials, although the tendency of BH4 to become oxidized to BH2 remains a problem.

=== Testing and diagnosis ===

In the coronary circulation, angiography of coronary artery responses to vasoactive agents may be used to test for endothelial function, and venous occlusion plethysmography and ultrasonography are used to assess endothelial function of peripheral vessels in humans.

A non-invasive method to measure endothelial dysfunction is % Flow-Mediated Dilation (FMD) as measured by Brachial Artery Ultrasound Imaging (BAUI). Current measurements of endothelial function via FMD vary due to technical and physiological factors. Furthermore, a negative correlation between percent flow mediated dilation and baseline artery size is recognised as a fundamental scaling problem, leading to biased estimates of endothelial function.

von Willebrand factor is a marker of endothelial dysfunction, and is consistently elevated in atrial fibrillation. 

A non-invasive, FDA-approved device for measuring endothelial function that works by measuring Reactive Hyperemia Index (RHI) is Itamar Medical&#x27;s EndoPAT. It has shown an 80% sensitivity and 86% specificity to diagnose coronary artery disease when compared against the gold standard, acetylcholine angiogram. This results suggests that this peripheral test reflects the physiology of the coronary endothelium.

Since NO maintains low tone and high compliance of the small arteries at rest, a reduction of age-dependent small artery compliance is a marker for endothelial dysfunction that is associated with both functional and structural changes in the microcirculation. Small artery compliance or stiffness can be assessed simply and at rest and can be distinguished from large artery stiffness by use of pulsewave analysis.

=== Endothelial dysfunction and stents ===
Stent implantation has been correlated with impaired endothelial function in several studies. Sirolimus eluting stents were previously used because they showed low rates of in-stent restenosis, but further investigation showed that they often impair endothelial function in humans and worsen conditions. One drug used to inhibit restenosis is iopromide-paclitaxel.

=== COVID-19 complication in the lungs ===

COVID-19 can present with an acute lung injury manifestation that arises from endothelial dysfunction.

=== Risk reduction ===
Treatment of hypertension and hypercholesterolemia may improve endothelial function in people taking statins (HMGCoA-reductase inhibitor), and renin angiotensin system inhibitors, such as ACE inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor antagonists. Calcium channel blockers and selective beta 1 antagonists may also improve endothelial dysfunction. Life style modifications such as smoking cessation have also been shown to improve endothelial function and lower the risk of major cardiovascular events.
