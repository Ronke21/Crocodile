<text>Peredvizhniki (, ), often called The Wanderers or The Itinerants in English, were a group of Russian realist artists who formed an artists&#x27; cooperative in protest of academic restrictions; it evolved into the &quot;Society for Travelling Art Exhibitions&quot;, in short &quot;Peredvizhniks&quot;, in 1870.

== History ==

In 1863 a group of fourteen students decided to leave the Imperial Academy of Arts in Saint Petersburg. The students found the rules of the Academy constraining; the teachers were conservative and there was a strict separation between high and low art. In an effort to bring art to the people, the students formed an independent artistic society; The Petersburg Cooperative of Artists (Artel). In 1870, this organization was largely succeeded by the Association of Travelling Art Exhibits (Peredvizhniki) to give people from the provinces a chance to follow the achievements of Russian Art, and to teach people to appreciate art. The society maintained independence from state support and brought the art, which illustrated the contemporary life of the people from Moscow and Saint Petersburg, to the provinces.

From 1871 to 1923, the society arranged 48 mobile exhibitions in St. Petersburg and Moscow, after which they were shown in Kiev, Kharkov, Kazan, Oryol, Riga, Odessa and other cities.

== Influence of literary critics ==

Peredvizhniki were influenced by the public views of the literary critics Vissarion Belinsky and Nikolai Chernyshevsky, both of whom espoused liberal ideas. Belinsky thought that literature and art should attribute a social and moral responsibility. Like most Slavophiles, Chernyshevsky ardently supported the emancipation of serfs, which was finally realized in the reform of 1861. He viewed press censorship, serfdom, and capital punishment as Western influences. Because of his political activism, officials prohibited publication of any of his writing, including his dissertation; but it eventually found its way to the art world of nineteenth-century Russia. In 1863, almost immediately after the emancipation of serfs, Chernyshevsky&#x27;s goals were realized with the help of Peredvizhniki, who took the pervasive Slavophile-populist idea that Russia had a distinguishable, modest, inner beauty of its own and worked out how to display it on canvas.

== Subjects of the paintings ==

Peredvizhniki portrayed the many-sided aspects of social life, often critical of inequities and injustices. But their art showed not only poverty but also the beauty of the folk way of life; not only suffering but also fortitude and strength of characters. Peredvizhniki condemned the Russian aristocratic orders and autocratic government in their humanistic art. They portrayed the emancipation movement of Russian people with empathy (for example, &quot;The Arrest of a Propagandist&quot;, &quot;Refusal of Confession&quot;, and &quot;They Did Not Expect Him&quot; by Ilya Yefimovich Repin). They portrayed social-urban life, and later used historic art to depict the common people (&quot;The Morning of the Streltsy Execution&quot; by Vasily Surikov).

During their blossoming (1870–1890), the Peredvizhniki society developed an increasingly wider scope, with more natural and free images. In contrast to the traditional dark palette of the time, they chose a lighter palette, with a freer manner in their technique. They worked for naturalness in their images, and the depiction of people&#x27;s relationship with their surroundings. The society united most of the highly talented artists of the country. Among Peredvizhniki there were artists of Ukraine, Latvia, and Armenia. The society also showed the work of Mark Antokolski, Vasili Vereshchagin, and Andrei Ryabushkin. The work of the critic and democrat Vladimir Stasov was important for the development of Peredvizhniki&#x27;s art. Pavel Mikhailovich Tretyakov showed the work of these artists in his gallery and gave them important material and moral support.

== Landscape as the most popular genre of Peredvizhniki ==

Landscape painting flourished in the 1870s and 1880s. Peredvizhniki painted mainly landscapes; some, like Polenov, used plein air technique. Two painters, Ivan Shishkin and Isaak Levitan, painted only landscapes of Russia. Shishkin is still considered to be the Russian &quot;Singer of forest&quot;, while Levitan&#x27;s landscapes are famous for their intense moods. The Russian landscape gained importance as a national icon after Peredvizhniki.

Peredvizhniki painted landscapes to explore the beauty of their own country and encourage ordinary people to love and preserve it. Levitan once said, &quot;I imagine such a gracefulness in our Russian land – overflowing rivers bringing everything back to life. There is no country more beautiful than Russia! There can be a true landscapist only in Russia&quot;. Peredvizhniki gave a national character to landscapes, so people of other nations could recognize Russian landscape. The landscapes of Peredvizhniki are the symbolic embodiments of Russian nationality.

== Reproduction of works ==

Even though the number of travelling exhibition visitors from the provinces was increasing during the years, the main audience was the urban elite. Local photographers created the first reproductions of Peredvizhniki&#x27;s paintings, which helped popularize the works and could be bought at exhibitions. &quot;Niva&quot; magazine also published illustrated articles about the exhibitions. Since 1898, the landscapes of the society have been used in the postcard industry. Various books of poems were published with the illustrations of landscapes. Ordinary Russian people at that time could not afford to go to Moscow or Saint Petersburg, so popularization of Russian art made them familiar with a number of Russian art masterpieces. Even now publishers use the reproductions in textbooks as a visual icon of national identity.

== Decline of creativity ==

As the authority and public influence of the society steadily grew, government officials had to stop their efforts to repress the members. Attempts were made to subordinate their activity, and raise the falling value of Academy of Arts-sanctioned works. By the 1890s, the Academy of Arts structure was including Peredvizhniki art in its classes and history, and the influence of the artists showed in national art schools.

<doc id="905909" wikidata="Q3561844" url="?curid=905909" title="Vladimir Platonov">
<text>Vladimir Petrovich Platonov (; ; born 1 December 1939, Stayki village, Vitebsk Region, Byelorussian SSR) is a Soviet, Belarusian and Russian mathematician. He is an expert in algebraic geometry and topology and member of the Russian Academy of Sciences.

From 1992–2004 he worked at research centers in the United States, Canada and Germany.

== Education ==

In 1961 Platonov graduated with highest distinction from Belarusian State University. In 1963 he received his Ph.D. from the Academy of Sciences of Belarus. In 1967, Platonov received his Doctor of Science degree from the Academy of Sciences of USSR.

== Career ==
At age 28 Platonov received a title of full professor at Belarus State. This made him the youngest full professor in the nation&#x27;s history. In 1972 he became an Academician of the National Academy of Sciences of Belarus and its President (1987–1993). He has been an Academician of the Russian/USSR Academy of Sciences since 1987. He was the Director of the Institute of Mathematics of the Academy of Sciences of Belarus from 1977 to 1992.

== Research ==
His interests are algebra, algebraic geometry and number theory. He solved the Strong approximation problem, developed the reduced K-theory and solved the Tannaka–Artin problem. He solved the Kneser-Tits and Grothendieck problems. Together with F. Grunewald he solved the arithmeticity problem for finite extensions of arithmetic groups and the rigidity problem for arithmetic subgroups of algebraic groups with radical. Platonov solved the rationality problem for spinor varieties and the Dieudonne problem on spinor norms.

Platonov was an invited speaker of the International Congresses of Mathematicians in Vancouver (1974), Helsinki (1978) and the European Congress of Mathematicians in Budapest (1996).

He is a member of the Canadian Mathematical Society and from 1993 to 2001 was a Professor of the Faculty of Mathematics of the University of Waterloo in Waterloo, Ontario, Canada.

He is the author, with Andrei Rapinchuk, of &quot;Algebraic Groups and Number Theory&quot;.

He currently works as a Chief Science Officer of Scientific Research Institute of System Development (NIISI RAN).

== Assault conviction ==
On November 9, 1999, Platonov appeared in court on a bail hearing on a charge of attempted murder for an attack on his wife. He was convicted of assault. The court gave him a conditional sentence of two years. In September 2001, Platonov took early retirement as a professor of the University of Waterloo.

==Awards==
*Order of the Red Banner of Labour
*1968: Lenin Komsomol Prize, for a series of works in topological group theory
*1978: Lenin Prize in Science and Technology, for a fundamental series of works &quot;Arithmetics of Algebraic Groups and Reduced K-Theory&quot; (&quot;Арифметика алгебраических групп и приведенная К-теория&quot;)
*1993: Humboldt Prize

<doc id="905911" wikidata="Q371140" url="?curid=905911" title="Europeras">
<text>Europeras is a series of five operas by the composer John Cage. Cage explained the punning title thus: &quot;For two hundred years the Europeans have been sending us their operas. Now I&#x27;m sending them back.&quot;

==Europeras I and II==
Europeras I and II were premiered by the Frankfurt Opera in December 1987 after a delay caused by fire; both call on the full resources of the house and apply the technique of indeterminacy to plot, stage directions, lighting, costuming, props, and sets, as well as to the music, drawn from fragments of the 18th and 19th century repertoire and intermittently drowned out by a taped Opera Mix, &quot;as if you were shouting to someone on the opposite side of the street and a large truck passes by.&quot;

The libretto, in twenty-four scenarios, likewise juxtaposes traditional operatic episodes: the libretto begins &quot;Dressed as an Irish princess, he gives birth; they plot to overthrow the French.&quot; The area of the stage is divided into 64 quadrants corresponding to the I Ching and the nineteen singers share the space with dancers. Cage said &quot;What I wanted to do was to have the programs such that if twelve people were sitting in a row each one would be looking at a different opera.&quot; There is no conductor; performers are instead guided by large projections of a digital clock according to strict time intervals. Cage even went so far as to hand out two separate sets of librettos to the audience at the premiere, themselves culled from previous operatic works.

No recordings have yet been released of &quot;Europeras I and II.&quot;

==Europeras III and IV==
Europeras III and IV were commissioned by the Almeida Festival in London and premiered in 1990, subsequently touring. Both prominently feature gramophones, the former in combination with two pianists (replacing the orchestra). The latter is a chamber piece for singer, gramophone and table lamp.

Mode Records issued a 2-CD set of &quot;Europeras III and IV&quot; in 1995: catalog # 37/38.

<text>The Crown of England traditionally exercised the right to impose import duties for the regulation of trade and the protection of domestic industry. New impositions of this kind were imposed by Elizabeth I on currants and tobacco (1601) and extended by King James I to most imports (1608) after a favourable ruling in Bates&#x27; Case (1606). John Bates was a merchant from the Levant Company who refused to pay the import duty on currants.

In the face of Parliament&#x27;s angry protests in 1610, the tax was amended to ensure that the greatest impact fell on foreign merchants.

Impositions were among the prerogative rights that King James I was to give up under the Great Contract of 1610, as drawn up by Lord Treasurer Robert Cecil, then Lord Salisbury, in return for an immediate sum to pay off Royal debt and an annual subsidy that would greatly increase income. However negotiations fell through, mainly because both sides kept changing what they wanted out of the Contract.

The prerogative of imposing any kind of tax without parliamentary authority was ultimately abolished as part of the Glorious Revolution with the Bill of Rights 1689.

<text>Peter Woodthorpe (25 September 1931 – 13 August 2004) was an English actor who supplied the voice of Gollum in the 1978 Bakshi version of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; and the BBC&#x27;s 1981 radio serial. He also provided the voice of Pigsy in the cult series &quot;Monkey&quot; and played Max, the pathologist, in early episodes of &quot;Inspector Morse&quot;.

==Early life==
Woodthorpe was educated at Archbishop Holgate&#x27;s Grammar School. He was a national serviceman in the Royal Navy as part of naval intelligence.

==Career==
In 1955, Woodthorpe portrayed Estragon in the first British production of &quot;Waiting for Godot&quot;. He had then just finished his second year reading Biochemistry at Magdalene College, Cambridge, and expected to return after a run of a few weeks. When the play was successful, faced with the choice of dropping out either from Cambridge or from the play, he chose to stay with the play and his acting career. In 1960, he played Aston in the first production of Harold Pinter&#x27;s &quot;The Caretaker&quot; at the Arts Theatre, in London, prior to transferring to the West End&#x27;s Duchess Theatre on 30 May 1960. He also starred as Oxford in the Broadway musical &quot;Darling of the Day&quot;. He was later a member of the Royal Shakespeare Company, appearing in productions of &quot;Much Ado About Nothing&quot;, &quot;Henry V&quot;, &quot;The Merchant of Venice&quot; and &quot;The Lower Depths&quot;.

In 1964 and 1965, he made three films for cinematographer-turned-director Freddie Francis: &quot;The Evil of Frankenstein&quot; (1964), &quot;Hysteria&quot; (1965) and &quot;The Skull&quot; (1965), the first two for Hammer Films and the last for Amicus Productions. His characters in these films were all sleazy, corrupt and manipulative types (a hypnotist, a nudie photographer and a corrupt landlord).

Other television appearances include as the writer Honoré de Balzac in the BBC series &quot;Notorious Woman&quot; (1974) and as the corrupt Councillor George Webb in the episode &quot;Not a Very Civil Civil Servant&quot; of London Weekend Television&#x27;s action drama &quot;The Professionals&quot; (1978).

One of Woodthorpe&#x27;s best-remembered roles was the guest role of Reg Trotter, father of Del Boy, in the 1983 Christmas special &quot;Thicker than Water&quot;, an episode of the BBC sitcom &quot;Only Fools and Horses&quot;. In 1984, he and Lennard Pearce (who starred on the programme as Grandad Trotter, Reg&#x27;s father, and appeared alongside him in that episode) were seen together again in the &quot;Minder&quot; episode &quot;The Balance of Power&quot;.

After 1994, he recorded the voices of Toad, Great White Stag and Whistler in a BBC Young Collection audiotape version of &quot;the Animals of Farthing Wood&quot;.

==Death==
Woodthorpe died at the age of 72 on 13 August 2004 in Banbury, Oxfordshire, following a short illness.

<doc id="905936" wikidata="Q2707551" url="?curid=905936" title="Ladies of the Canyon (album)">
<text>Ladies of the Canyon is the third studio album by the Canadian singer-songwriter Joni Mitchell, released on Reprise Records in 1970. It peaked at No. 27 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, and has been certified platinum by the RIAA. The title makes reference to Laurel Canyon, a center of popular music culture in Los Angeles during the 1960s, where Mitchell lived while she was writing the album. Specifically, Mitchell lived and wrote at 8217 Lookout Mountain Avenue, the house which is the subject of Graham Nash&#x27;s &quot;Our House&quot;. The album includes several of Mitchell&#x27;s most noted songs, such as &quot;Big Yellow Taxi&quot;, &quot;Woodstock&quot; and &quot;The Circle Game&quot;.

==Album content==

The album is notable for its expansion of Mitchell&#x27;s artistic vision and its varied song topics (ranging from the aesthetic weight of celebrity, to observation of the Woodstock generation, to the complexities of love). &quot;Ladies of the Canyon&quot; is often viewed as a transition between Mitchell&#x27;s folky earlier work and the more sophisticated, poignant albums that were to follow. In particular, &quot;For Free&quot; foreshadows the lyrical leitmotif of the isolation triggered by success that would be elaborated upon in &quot;For the Roses&quot; and &quot;Court and Spark&quot;. The sparse, alternative-tuning laden sound of later records comes to the forefront on &quot;Ladies of the Canyon&quot;.

Of all of Mitchell&#x27;s work, this album is the most related to her long-standing friendships and relationships with Crosby, Stills, Nash, &amp; Young (whose rock arrangement of &quot;Woodstock&quot; was one of their four radio hits in 1970). Mitchell was living with Graham Nash at the time much of the album was written. A number of the album&#x27;s songs, including the aforementioned &quot;Ladies of the Canyon&quot; and &quot;Woodstock&quot;, feature densely stacked, wordless harmony overdubs reminiscent of David Crosby&#x27;s oeuvre; Crosby himself performed &quot;For Free&quot; for many years. &quot;The Circle Game&quot;, one of the artist&#x27;s early signature songs, features background vocals from all four.

==Critical reception==

Reviewing for &quot;The Village Voice&quot; in 1970, Robert Christgau found &quot;Ladies of the Canyon&quot; &quot;superior to her previous work, richer lyrically and more compelling musically.&quot; He said the album&#x27;s second half is &quot;almost perfect, and the arrangements are intelligent throughout&quot;, but found Mitchell&#x27;s voice weak and her wordplay inconsistent. Years later in &quot;Christgau&#x27;s Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies&quot; (1981), he said that, despite the occasional &quot;laughably high school&quot; wordplay, Mitchell&#x27;s reliance on piano suggests &quot;a move from the open air to the drawing room ... that&#x27;s reflected in richer, more sophisticated songs.&quot; In 2000 it was voted number 731 in Colin Larkin&#x27;s &quot;All Time Top 1000 Albums&quot;.

==Legacy==
&quot;Big Yellow Taxi&quot; has become a standard over the years, and it was sampled by Janet Jackson. It has been used repeatedly to call attention to environmental injustices, as it makes reference to the use of DDT, the Foster Botanical Garden and the Royal Hawaiian Hotel.

In 1995 Annie Lennox performed the song &quot;Ladies of the Canyon&quot; and released it as the B-side of her single &quot;No More I Love You&#x27;s&quot;. &quot;Ladies of the Canyon&quot; discusses three real women, Annie Burden, Estrella Berosini, and Trina Robbins.

Singer-songwriter Lana Del Rey included a cover of the song &quot;For Free&quot; as part of several dates of her 2019 Norman Fucking Rockwell! Tour. A studio version of the cover featuring Zella Day and Weyes Blood was also included in her 2021 album &quot;Chemtrails over the Country Club&quot;. The song critiques the “pop cash nexus” and centers the musical talent of a street busker.

&quot;Rainy Night House&quot; discusses Mitchell&#x27;s brief relationship with Leonard Cohen, and a specific night they spent together in his childhood home.

One of &quot;Ladies of the Canyon’s&quot; most lauded tracks is “Woodstock,” which has been heralded as an anthem of 1969’s Woodstock Music and Art Fair. Woodstock is a well known event in the history of the 1960s countercultural revolution.

&quot;The Young and the Restless&quot; star Jess Walton stated that she was the owner of one of the houses featured on the album&#x27;s cover.

<text>The Royal Book of Oz (1921) is the fifteenth book in the Oz series, and the first to be written after L. Frank Baum&#x27;s death. Although Baum was credited as the author, it was written entirely by Ruth Plumly Thompson. It was followed by &quot;Kabumpo in Oz&quot; (1922).

==Plot summary==

The Scarecrow is upset when Professor Woggle-bug tells him that he has no family, so he goes back to the corn-field where Dorothy Gale found him to trace his &quot;roots.&quot; When he fails to return, Dorothy and the Cowardly Lion set out to search for him. They meet an elderly knight, Sir Hokus of Pokes. They also meet the Doubtful Dromedary and the Comfortable Camel. Together, they have several curious adventures while searching for the Scarecrow.

In this novel the Scarecrow discovers that, in a previous incarnation, he was human. More specifically, he was the Emperor of the Silver Islands, a kingdom located deep underground beneath the Munchkin region of Oz, inhabited by people who resemble Chinese people. When Dorothy first discovered the Scarecrow (in &quot;The Wonderful Wizard of Oz&quot;) he was hanging from a beanpole in a cornfield; it now develops that this pole descends deep underground to the Silver Islands. The Emperor of the Silver Islands had been transformed into a crocus by an enemy magician; this magical crocus had sprouted and grown into the beanpole all the way up to the surface of the earth. When the farmer placed his scarecrow on the beanpole, the spirit of the transformed Emperor entered the Scarecrow&#x27;s body, causing him to come to life.

The Scarecrow digs at the base of the beanpole and slides down the beanpole to the Silver Islands. The islanders hail him as the Emperor, returned to save his people. After spending some time in his former kingdom ruling the quarrelsome Silver Islanders, the Scarecrow decides to return to Oz and continue his carefree existence there. The islanders, however, are reluctant to let him go, and plot to change him back into his human form, an 85-year-old man. Dorothy and her party reach the Silver Islands, rescue the Scarecrow from the islanders, and accompany him back to the Emerald City. Sir Hokus, the Comfortable Camel, and the Doubtful Dromedary become residents of the Emerald City.

==Authorship==
The original introduction claimed that the book was based on notes by Baum, but this claim has been contested and disproven. The notes, titled &quot;An Oz Book&quot;, are known from four typewritten pages found at his publisher&#x27;s, but their authenticity as Baum&#x27;s work has been disputed. Even if genuine, they are tied to &quot;John Dough and the Cherub&quot; and bear no resemblance to Thompson&#x27;s book.

In 1964, Thompson, in a letter, claimed that this note idea was fabricated by the publishers &quot;to bridge the gap between Baum&#x27;s books and&quot; hers. Thompson also asserted that she did not utilize any notes of Baum&#x27;s. After submission of the manuscript, the publisher requested the story be completely rewritten. However, Thompson threatened to publish the book elsewhere without the Oz elements, and the publisher decided to publish the book as written.

Beginning in the 1980s, some editions have correctly credited Thompson, although the cover of the 2001 edition by Dover Publications credits only Baum.

==Later Oz stories==
Sir Hokus and the Comfortable Camel return as principal characters in &quot;The Yellow Knight of Oz&quot;.

<doc id="905950" wikidata="Q239586" url="?curid=905950" title="Mark Tewksbury">
<text>Mark Roger Tewksbury, (born February 7, 1968) is a Canadian former competitive swimmer. He is best known for winning the gold medal in the 100-metre backstroke at the 1992 Summer Olympics. He also hosted the first season of &quot;How It&#x27;s Made&quot;, a Canadian documentary series, in 2001.

Tewksbury was awarded the Meritorious Service Medal (Civil Division) in 1993 for being a &quot;motivational speaker and a gifted athlete.&quot;

==Competitive swimming==
Raised in Calgary, Alberta, Tewksbury trained at the University of Calgary.

He competed at the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul, South Korea, and won a silver medal as a member of Canada&#x27;s relay team. For some years he ranked as one of the top backstrokers in the world; never a strong below-the-water swimmer, he was unmatched on the surface, but, as the importance of below-the-water swimming increased, Tewksbury&#x27;s ranking began to fall.

Going into Barcelona, Tewksbury was ranked fourth in the world and most pundits picked one of the powerful American swimmers to win gold. American Jeff Rouse, world record holder in the 100m backstroke, had beaten Tewksbury at the 1991 Pan Pacific Games and 1991 World Aquatics Championships the year before and was heavily favored to win gold. Using an underwater dolphin kick start Rouse took off to an early lead, leaving Tewksbury to play catch-up on both laps. Tewksbury would pass Rouse on the last stroke of the race, beating the American by just six one hundredths of a second—the same margin of victory Rouse had bested Tewksbury the year before at World Championships. Tewksbury would credit using visualization during his preparation to help instill self-belief and calm in the moments before the Olympic final.

Tewksbury&#x27;s gold medal was Canada&#x27;s first at the Barcelona games and the first Canadian gold in swimming since the Communist-boycotted 1984 Olympics in Los Angeles. Tewksbury also won a bronze medal in the relay event in Barcelona. He made the cover of &quot;Time&quot; magazine. He was inducted into the Canadian Olympic Hall of Fame, Canada&#x27;s Sports Hall of Fame, and the International Swimming Hall of Fame and was named Canada&#x27;s Male Athlete of the Year. After the Barcelona games, Tewksbury retired from swimming.

==Post-swimming career==
After retirement, Tewksbury received a number of high-profile endorsement deals and worked as an athlete representative with the International Olympic Committee (IOC), a position from which he resigned in disenchantment in 1998, accusing the IOC of rampant corruption. He was also part of the group of former Olympic athletes that was pushing for the resignation of IOC President Juan Antonio Samaranch. Only months after the scandal surrounding the 2002 Salt Lake City Olympic winter Games broke, Tewksbury became prominent around the world as a critic of the IOC and demanded reforms to the system.

In 1993, Tewksbury and Mark Leduc both gave interviews about their homosexuality to the CBC Radio series &quot;The Inside Track&quot; for &quot;The Last Closet&quot;, a special episode about homophobia in sports; however, as neither was ready to fully come out at the time, both interviews were given anonymously and recorded through voice filters. In December 1998, Tewksbury officially came out as gay; he subsequently lost a six-figure contract as a motivational speaker because he was &quot;too openly gay.&quot;

Tewksbury was also highly critical of Swimming Canada&#x27;s organization in the wake of the national team&#x27;s poor performance at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, where they failed to medal. He suggested that there was a lack of accountability within Swim Canada, and that head coach Dave Johnson was given too much power.

Tewksbury became a prominent advocate for gay rights and gay causes in Canada and the world. On May 16, 2003, Tewksbury joined the board of directors for the 2006 World Outgames in Montreal and was named co-president. He was a panelist at the 2003 National Gay and Lesbian Athletics Conference in Cambridge, Massachusetts, on a panel of LGBT Olympians that also included rower Harriet Metcalf and high jumper Brian Marshall.

Tewksbury was the narrator for the TV show &quot;How It&#x27;s Made&quot; during the first season. In 2006, he published his second book, an autobiography entitled &quot;Inside Out: Straight Talk from a Gay Jock&quot;. Tewksbury remains a public figure working as a motivational speaker, a television commentator for swimming events, and a continued activist. He is a board member of the Gay and Lesbian Athletics Foundation.

On November 30, 2006 Tewksbury was the Master of Ceremonies for the Tribute to former Prime Minister Paul Martin at the Liberal Party of Canada&#x27;s Leadership and Biennial Convention in Montreal.

During the 2008 Summer Olympics, Tewksbury served as CBC Sports&#x27; swimming analyst alongside play-by play announcer Steve Armitage.

In December 2008 Tewksbury was invited by the government of France to speak at the United Nations in New York City on the day that a declaration was introduced that affirms gay rights and seeks to decriminalize homosexuality.

On September 19, 2009, Tewksbury was inducted into Canada&#x27;s LGBT Human Rights Hall of Fame, the Q Hall of Fame Canada, in honour of his outstanding achievements and efforts to end discrimination in the sports world.

On August 5, 2010, he was named the chef de mission of the 2012 Canadian Summer Olympic team.

In 2015, Tewksbury was presented the Bonham Centre Award from The Mark S. Bonham Centre for Sexual Diversity Studies, University of Toronto, for his contributions to the advancement and education of issues around sexual identification.

On July 23, 2015, Tewksbury presented his gold medal to the Canadian Museum for Human Rights in Winnipeg for an exhibit promoting the power of sport to influence positive change.

In 2017, Tewksbury was chosen as a Grand Marshal for the Fierté Canada Pride Montreal.

In May 2019, Tewksbury performed an autobiographical one-man show called &quot;Belong&quot;, which was produced by Wordfest and staged at the DJD Dance Centre in Calgary. The performance was a spin-off of his 2018 staged reading called &quot;50 &amp; Counting&quot; at Buddies in Bad Times theatre in Toronto. &quot;Belong&quot; was then restaged in January 2020 as part of One Yellow Rabbit theatre’s 34th annual High Performance Rodeo in Calgary.

In 2020, he became a Companion of the Order of Canada.

In 2022, he appeared as a panelist in &quot;Canada Reads&quot;, advocating for Esi Edugyan&#x27;s novel &quot;Washington Black&quot;.

<text>PPG Industries, Inc. is an American Fortune 500 company and global supplier of paints, coatings, and specialty materials. With headquarters in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, PPG operates in more than 70 countries around the globe. By revenue it is the second largest coatings company in the world behind Sherwin-Williams. It is headquartered in PPG Place, an office and retail complex in downtown Pittsburgh, and is known for its glass facade designed by Postmodern architect Philip Johnson.

== History ==
=== 19th century ===

Pittsburgh Plate Glass Company was founded in 1883 by Captain John Baptiste Ford and John Pitcairn, Jr., at Creighton, Pennsylvania.

PPG soon became the United States&#x27; first commercially successful producer of high-quality, thick flat glass using the plate process. PPG was also the world&#x27;s first plate glass plant to power its furnaces with locally produced natural gas, an innovation which rapidly stimulated widespread industrial use of the cleaner-burning fuel.

PPG expanded quickly. By 1900, known as the &quot;Glass Trust&quot;, it included 10 plants, had a 65 percent share of the U.S. plate glass market, and had become the nation&#x27;s second largest producer of paint. Today, known as PPG Industries, the company is a multibillion-dollar, Fortune 500 corporation with 150 manufacturing locations around the world. It now produces coatings, glass, fiberglass, and other chemicals.

Pitcairn served as a director of PPG from its start, its president from 1897 to 1905, and chairman of the board from 1894 until his death in 1916.

=== 20th century ===
Ditzler Color Company, established in 1902 in Detroit as an automotive color concern, was purchased by Pittsburgh Plate Glass Company (now PPG) in 1928. On 19 December 1968 the company changed its name to PPG Industries, Inc., to show its diverse offerings. In the mid-1980s, Cipisa, a Spanish paint company was acquired and renamed PPG Ibérica and its CEO, Pere Nadal Carres, became CEO of PPG Ibérica. In 1990 PPG founded Transitions Optical as a joint venture with Essilor.

In October 2000, PPG Industries announced it had agreed to buy Courtaulds Aerospace for $512.5 million. Based in Glendale, California, the aerospace business has annual sales of approximately $240 million, employs 1,200 people. It manufactures sealants in Glendale, California and Shildon, England; coatings and sealants in Mojave, California; glazing sealants at Gloucester City, New Jersey; and coatings at Gonfreville, France. The business also operates 14 application-support centers located in North America, Europe, Africa, Asia, and Australia.

=== 21st century ===
==== 2000s ====
In 2006, the company rolled out a two-tiered pay system which resulted in massive strikes at union locations across the country. The system, now in place company-wide for non-salaried employees, provides lower rates of pay and fewer benefits to those employed after the roll-out than those employed before the roll-out. In West Virginia, after a bitter five-month strike, the company still refused to eliminate the two-tiered system. In Lake Charles, Louisiana, the employment contracts of union employees had to be extended during a strike regarding the two-tiered system.

In 2007, the company was involved in a lawsuit on failing to disclose a purchase reduction of its two major auto glass customers.

In 2007, PPG in Australia acquired Barloworld Coatings (Australia) Pty Limited, producer of the Taubmans, Bristol, and White Knight brands of paint.

On 2 January 2008, PPG acquired the SigmaKalon Group of companies for $3.2 billion from private investment firm Bain Capital, strongly increasing its paint and specialty coatings business.

In 2008, PPG renamed their automotive glass division PGW (Pittsburgh Glass Works) and sold a majority of it to Kohlberg &amp; Company. PPG retained 40% ownership of PGW until March 2016 when they sold their stake to automotive parts salvage company LKQ Corporation.

==== 2010s ====
In 2012, PPG acquired Dyrup A/S, founded in Denmark in 1928 as &quot;S. Dyrup &amp; Co A/S&quot; by Sigurd Dyrup and Axel Monberg and Ejnar Thorsen of MT Højgaard, some of whose brands are Dyrup, GORI (outdoor woodcare paint), and Bondex.

In April 2013, PPG completed the acquisition of AkzoNobel North American architectural coatings business including Glidden, Liquid Nails, and Flood brands. 2013 revenue was US$15.1 billion, while assets were US$15.9 billion.

On April 1, 2014, PPG finalized the sale of Transitions Optical to its joint venture partner, Essilor International of France; however, PPG&#x27;s technical center in Monroeville will continue to provide research and development services for Transitions. On November 5, 2014, PPG closed a deal, to purchase Mexican Consorcio Comex, S.A. de C.V. (“Comex”) for $2.3 billion 

In April 2015, PPG Industries completed the acquisition of REVOCOAT, a global supplier of sealants. Chuck Bunch remains Executive Chairman, while Michael McGarry serves as President &amp; CEO.

In July 2016, PPG announced its sale of the flat glass business to Vitro, a glass manufacturer based in Mexico, for $750 million.

In October 2016, Pittsburgh Post-Gazette announced the acquisition of the naming rights to Consol Energy Center by PPG; the facility will be known as PPG Paints Arena.

In September 2017, PPG announced the sale of its remaining fiberglass operations to Nippon Electric Glass for $541 million. This was following PPG&#x27;s 2016 sale of its European fiberglass operations to NEG, and divesting its ownership in two other Asian fiberglass joint ventures.

=====Attempted acquisition of AkzoNobel=====

In March 2017, the company launched an unsolicited takeover bid of €20.9 billion, which was promptly rejected by AkzoNobel&#x27;s management. Days later, the company launched an increased bid of €24.5 billion, which was again rejected by AkzoNobel&#x27;s management. A number of shareholders urged AkzoNobel to explore the offer and subsequent negotiations. In April, activist investor Elliott Investors called for the removal of the Chairman of Akzo, Antony Burgmans, following Akzo&#x27;s refusal to enter talks with PPG. Elliott, which has a 3.25% stake in the company, claimed it was one of a group of investors that met the Dutch legal threshold of 10% voting-share support, which is needed to call an extraordinary meeting to vote on a proposal to remove Burgmans. On April 13, Templeton Global Equity said it was among another group of investors calling for an extraordinary meeting of AkzoNobel shareholders to discuss Burgmans&#x27; continued tenure as chairman. Later in the same month Akzo outlined its plan to separate its chemicals division and pay shareholders €1.6 billion in extra dividends, in order to attempt to hold off PPG. The new Akzo strategy was dismissed by PPG, which claimed that their offer represented better value for shareholders, supported by activist Akzo shareholder Elliot Advisors. On April 24, a day before Akzo&#x27;s annual meeting of shareholders, PPG increased its final offer by approximately 8% to $28.8 billion (€26.9 billion, €96.75 per share), with Akzo&#x27;s share price rising 6% to a record of €82.95 per share. Akzo shareholder Columbia Threadneedle Investments urged the company to open dialogue with PPG, whilst PPG claimed that the deal would add to earning within its first year. Great Britain&#x27;s largest pension scheme investors, Universities Superannuation Scheme (USS), urged Akzo to engage with PPG. On 2 May, &quot;Reuters&quot; revealed that the supervisory board of Akzo was meeting to discuss how to deal with PPG&#x27;s third offer, still maintaining it did not value the company highly enough. In early May, Akzo again rejected PPG&#x27;s bid, citing the deal still undervalues the company, as well as potentially facing antitrust risks, and not addressing other concerns such as &quot;cultural differences&quot;. Under Dutch company law, PPG must now decide to either make a formal bid or walk away. In early June PPG chose to abandon pursuit.

==== 2020s ====
In 2020, PPG won an Adhesives and Sealants Council (ASC) Innovation Award for &quot;High Strength, Highly Ductile Structural Adhesive PR 2930&quot;. In May 2021, PPG completed the acquisition of Wörwag, a German coating manufacturer.

On October 17, 2024, PPG announced its intent to sell its architectural coatings business in the U.S. and Canada to American Industrial Partners for $550 million. Brands included in the sale are Glidden, Dulux (in Canada), Liquid Nails, Homax, Pittsburgh Paints and Stains, Flood, Sico and Manor Hall. The sale also includes 750 company owned retail stores, 6,600 independent dealer stores, and shelf facings at 8,100 retail and home improvement store locations.

==Financial record==
PPG reported a net profit for each fiscal year in the period 2013 to 2022. 


==Environmental record==

In November 2010, PPG agreed to remove 700,000 tons of toxic waste from Canal Crossing, a brownfield site in Jersey City, New Jersey where the company operated a chromium processing plant between 1954 and 1963. Stringent standards were agreed to in a federal court settlement.

Lime Lake Reclamation Project of PPG Industries in Barberton, Ohio, received special awards in the National Beneficial Use of Biosolids Program from Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) region 5 in 1998.

According to the book &quot;Strangers in Their Own Land&quot; by Arlie Russell Hochschild, Pittsburgh Plate Glass ordered employees to dump toxic tar in Bayou D&#x27;Inde in Lake Charles, Louisiana.

==In sports==
PPG has been involved in sports for numerous years, including being the primary sponsor for the CART Indy car series from 1980 to 1997. The company has been a partner of Team Penske in CART, IndyCar Series and NASCAR Cup Series since 1984. Since the race&#x27;s inception in 1994, PPG has sponsored the trophy for the Brickyard 400.

On October 4, 2016, it was announced that The Consol Energy Center in Pittsburgh would be giving up its naming rights, and transferred to PPG, making the arena named the PPG Paints Arena.

PPG also partners with Formula 1 racing teams. They have a partnership with Williams F1 Team since 2017.

PPG is the prime sponsor of John Force Racing and makes all their cars and paints and decals them before each NHRA race.

<doc id="905953" wikidata="Q359433" url="?curid=905953" title="Christopher Greenup">
<text>Christopher Greenup (c. 1750 – April 27, 1818) was an American politician who served as a U.S. Representative and the third Governor of Kentucky. Little is known about his early life; the first reliable records about him are documents recording his service in the Revolutionary War where he served as a lieutenant in the Continental Army and a colonel in the Virginia militia.

After his service in the war, Greenup helped settle the trans-Appalachian regions of Virginia. He became involved in politics, and played an active role in three of the ten statehood conventions that secured the separation of Kentucky from Virginia in 1792. He became one of the state&#x27;s first representatives, and served in the Kentucky General Assembly before being elected governor in a race where, due to his immense popularity, he ran unopposed.

Greenup&#x27;s term in office was marred by accusations that he had participated in the Burr Conspiracy to align Kentucky with Spain prior to the former&#x27;s separation from Virginia, but he vigorously and successfully rebutted these charges. Following his term as governor, he became less active in the political arena. He died on April 27, 1818. Greenup County, Kentucky and its county seat were both named in his honor.

==Early life in Virginia==
Christopher Greenup was most likely born in Fairfax County in the Virginia Colony around 1750. His early education was attained at the local schools of the area. He learned surveying and studied law under Colonel Charles Binns at Charles City County, Virginia. During the American Revolutionary War, he served in Grayson&#x27;s Additional Continental Regiment as a lieutenant, and may have seen action at Brandywine and Germantown. He resigned his commission during the Valley Forge encampment in 1778, but later served as a colonel in the Virginia militia.

In 1781, Greenup helped settle the area now known as Lincoln County, Kentucky where he spent time as a surveyor and a land speculator. He was admitted to practice law in the county court in 1782. Following Virginia&#x27;s creation of Kentucky County in 1783, he was admitted to the bar of the district court of Harrodsburg and served as clerk from 1785 to 1792. In 1783, he became one of the original trustees of Transylvania Seminary (later to become Transylvania University.) He purchased two lots of land in Lexington and served as the clerk of the town&#x27;s trustees.

In 1785, Greenup was elected to represent Fayette County for a single term in the Virginia House of Delegates. During his service, he was appointed to a committee with Benjamin Logan and James Garrard to make recommendations on ways to further divide the area that would become Kentucky. The committee was also responsible for revising acts and surveys related to land and water surveys in the area. The committee ultimately recommended the creation of three new counties – Bourbon, Madison, and Mercer. When Mercer County was created later that year, Greenup was appointed a justice there. In 1786, Greenup served as a quartermaster in Benjamin Logan’s expedition against the Shawnees in the Ohio country.

During this time, Greenup continued to practice law in Fayette County and pursued various other interests. He was a founding member of the Danville Political Club and in 1787, he joined the Kentucky Society for Promoting Useful Knowledge. Future Kentucky Governors Isaac Shelby and James Garrard, as well as future Supreme Court justice Thomas Todd were also members of the Society. In 1789, he helped organize the Kentucky Manufacturing Society. Later, he was appointed to the Kentucky River Company, a group dedicated to improving infrastructure on the Kentucky River.

On July 9, 1787, during a brief return to Virginia, Greenup married Mary Catherine (&quot;Cathy&quot;) Pope of Hanover County, Virginia; the couple had two children – Nancy and William.

==Political career in Kentucky==
Greenup served as clerk of the first Kentucky statehood convention in Danville in 1784. He was elected as a delegate to the second and sixth statehood conventions in 1785 and 1788, respectively, and was a trustee of the city of Danville in 1787. H.E. Everman, biographer of fellow delegate James Garrard, noted that despite Greenup&#x27;s excellent legal background and legislative experience, his lack of oratorical skills prevented him from taking more of a leadership role in the conventions.

When Kentucky was admitted to the Union in 1792, Greenup moved to Frankfort where he was rewarded for his efforts on behalf of the state by being chosen as an elector for the state&#x27;s senators and governor. He also served in the first Kentucky Senate. Following this, he was appointed to the court of oyer and terminer, but resigned immediately to accept a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives. He was one of Kentucky&#x27;s first two representatives in the House, and was elected to three successive terms, serving from November 9, 1792, to March 3, 1797. In 1798, he was elected to the Kentucky House of Representatives, representing Mercer County. He also served as clerk of the state senate from 1799 to 1802.

Greenup was a candidate for governor of Kentucky in 1800, but was runner-up to James Garrard in a four-man race that also included Benjamin Logan and Thomas Todd. Greenup garnered a majority of the vote in fifteen counties, just one fewer than Garrard, but Garrard enjoyed strong support in the populous central Kentucky counties and received 8,390 votes, compared with 6,746 for Greenup, 3,996 for Logan, and 2,166 for Todd. Garrard appointed Greenup judge of the circuit court in 1802. After the Kentucky Senate refused to confirm Garrard&#x27;s Secretary of State, Harry Toulmin, as registrar of the land office, Garrard nominated Greenup. Greenup, however, intended to make another run at the governorship, and at his request, Garrard withdrew the nomination days later.

Greenup resigned his circuit judgeship on June 5, 1804, to make another run for governor. Immensely popular, he ran unopposed, and served as governor from September 4, 1804, to September 1, 1808. During Greenup&#x27;s administration, the state chartered the Bank of Kentucky and the Ohio Canal Company; Greenup became a director of the former in 1807. Despite his popularity, however, he was unable to pass much of his proposed agenda, which included provision of public education and reforms to the militia, courts, revenue system, and penal system.

A partisan Frankfort newspaper implicated Greenup in the Burr conspiracy, but he successfully defended himself and preserved his reputation. He deployed the Kentucky militia along the Ohio River to defend the state from any threat that might result from the Burr conspiracy, but that threat had largely dissipated by 1807.

Following his term as governor, Greenup was chosen as a presidential elector for the ticket of James Madison and George Clinton. In 1812, he became a justice of the peace in Franklin County. In August 1812, Kentucky Secretary of State Martin D. Hardin recommended to Governor Isaac Shelby that Greenup be appointed Assistant Secretary of State. Shelby made the appointment, and when Hardin, resigned December 15, 1812, Shelby nominated Greenup as his replacement. The Kentucky Senate approved the nomination on February 3, 1813, and Greenup served until his resignation on March 13, 1813.

==Personal life and death==
On October 22, 1807, Greenup&#x27;s wife Mary died in the Governor&#x27;s Mansion. According to legend, her ghostly image has appeared in clock faces and mirrors inside the mansion.

Greenup died April 27, 1818, at Blue Lick Springs Resort, where he had traveled seeking relief from his rheumatism. He is buried in the Frankfort Cemetery. Greenup County, Kentucky was named in his honor, as was its county seat of Greenup, Kentucky.

<text>Human height or stature is the distance from the bottom of the feet to the top of the head in a human body, standing erect. It is measured using a stadiometer, in centimetres when using the metric system or SI system, or feet and inches when using United States customary units or the imperial system.

In the early phase of anthropometric research history, questions about height measuring techniques for measuring nutritional status often concerned genetic differences.

Height is also important because it is closely correlated with other health components, such as life expectancy. Studies show that there is a correlation between small stature and a longer life expectancy. Individuals of small stature are also more likely to have lower blood pressure and are less likely to acquire cancer. The University of Hawaii has found that the &quot;longevity gene&quot; FOXO3 that reduces the effects of aging is more commonly found in individuals of small body size. Short stature decreases the risk of venous insufficiency.

When populations share genetic backgrounds and environmental factors, average height is frequently characteristic within the group. Exceptional height variation (around 20% deviation from average) within such a population is sometimes due to gigantism or dwarfism, which are medical conditions caused by specific genes or endocrine abnormalities.

The development of human height can serve as an indicator of two key welfare components, namely nutritional quality and health. In regions of poverty or warfare, environmental factors like chronic malnutrition during childhood or adolescence may result in delayed growth and/or marked reductions in adult stature even without the presence of any of these medical conditions.

== Determinants of growth ==
The study of height is known as &quot;auxology&quot;.

Growth has long been recognized as a measure of the health of individuals, hence part of the reasoning for the use of growth charts. For individuals, as indicators of health problems, growth trends are tracked for significant deviations, and growth is also monitored for significant deficiency from genetic expectations. Genetics is a major factor in determining the height of individuals, though it is far less influential regarding differences among populations. Average height is relevant to the measurement of the health and wellness standard of living and quality of life of populations.

Humans grow fastest (other than in the womb) as infants and toddlers, rapidly declining from a maximum at birth to roughly age 2, tapering to a slowly declining rate, and then, during the pubertal growth spurt (with an average girl starting her puberty and pubertal growth spurt at 10 years and an average boy starting his puberty and pubertal growth spurt at 12 years), a rapid rise to a second maximum (at around 11−12 years for an average female, and 13−14 years for an average male), followed by a steady decline to zero. The average female growth speed trails off to zero at about 15 or 16 years, whereas the average male curve continues for approximately 3 more years, going to zero at about 18−19, although there is limited research to suggest minor height growth after the age of 19 in males. These are also critical periods where stressors such as malnutrition (or even severe child neglect) have the greatest effect.

Moreover, the health of a mother throughout her life, especially during her critical period and pregnancy, has a role. A healthier child and adult develops a body that is better able to provide optimal prenatal conditions. The pregnant mother&#x27;s health is essential for herself but also the fetus as gestation is itself a critical period for an embryo/fetus, though some problems affecting height during this period are resolved by catch-up growth assuming childhood conditions are good. Thus, there is a cumulative generation effect such that nutrition and health over generations influence the height of descendants to varying degrees.

The age of the mother also has some influence on her child&#x27;s height. Studies in modern times have observed a gradual increase in height with maternal age, though these early studies suggest that trend is due to various socio-economic situations that select certain demographics as being more likely to have a first birth early in the mother&#x27;s life. These same studies show that children born to a young mother are more likely to have below-average educational and behavioural development, again suggesting an ultimate cause of resources and family status rather than a purely biological explanation.

In 1988 it was observed that first-born males were shorter than later-born males. However, in 2013 the reverse observation was made. The study authors suggest that the cause may be socio-economic in nature.

===Genetics ===
The precise relationship between genetics and environment is complex and uncertain. Differences in human height is 60−80% heritable, according to several twin studies and has been considered polygenic since the Mendelian-biometrician debate a hundred years ago. A genome-wide association (GWA) study of more than 180,000 individuals has identified hundreds of genetic variants in at least 180 loci associated with adult human height. The number of individuals has since been expanded to 253,288 individuals and the number of genetic variants identified is 697 in 423 genetic loci. In a separate study of body proportion using sitting-height ratio, it reports that these 697 variants can be partitioned into 3 specific classes, (1) variants that primarily determine leg length, (2) variants that primarily determine spine and head length, or (3) variants that affect overall body size. This gives insights into the biological mechanisms underlying how these 697 genetic variants affect overall height. These loci do not only determine height, but other features or characteristics. As an example, 4 of the 7 loci identified for intracranial volume had previously been discovered for human height.
Height, like other phenotypic traits, is determined by a combination of genetics and environmental factor. A child&#x27;s height based on parental heights is subject to regression toward the mean, therefore extremely tall or short parents will likely have correspondingly taller or shorter offspring, but their offspring will also likely be closer to average height than the parents themselves. Genetic potential and several hormones, minus illness, is a basic determinant for height. Other factors include the genetic response to external factors such as diet, exercise, environment, and life circumstances.

===Environmental and epigenetic effects===
The effect of environment on height is illustrated by studies performed by anthropologist Barry Bogin and coworkers of Guatemala Mayan children living in the United States. In the early 1970s, when Bogin first visited Guatemala, he observed that Mayan Indian men averaged in height and the women averaged . Bogin took another series of measurements after the Guatemalan Civil War, during which up to a million Guatemalans fled to the United States. He discovered that Maya refugees, who ranged from six to twelve years old, were significantly taller than their Guatemalan counterparts. By 2000, the American Maya were taller than the Guatemalan Maya of the same age, largely due to better nutrition and health care. Bogin also noted that American Maya children had relatively longer legs, averaging longer than the Guatemalan Maya (a significantly lower sitting height ratio).

The Nilotic peoples of Sudan such as the Shilluk and Dinka have been described as some of the tallest in the world. Dinka Ruweng males investigated by Roberts in 1953−1954 were on average tall, and Shilluk males averaged . The Nilotic people are characterized as having long legs, narrow bodies and short trunks, an adaptation to hot weather. However, male Dinka and Shilluk refugees measured in 1995 in Southwestern Ethiopia were on average only and tall, respectively. As the study points out, Nilotic people &quot;may attain greater height if privileged with favourable environmental conditions during early childhood and adolescence, allowing full expression of the genetic material.&quot; Before fleeing, these refugees were subject to privation as a consequence of the succession of civil wars in their country from 1955 to the present.

Attributed as a significant reason for the trend of increasing height in parts of Europe are the egalitarian populations where proper medical care and adequate nutrition had been relatively equally distributed as of 2004. The uneven distribution of nutritional resources makes it more plausible for individuals with better access to resources to grow taller, while individuals with worse access to resources have a lessened chance of growing taller.

Changes in diet (nutrition) and a general rise in quality of health care and standard of living are the cited factors in Asian populations. Malnutrition including chronic undernutrition and acute malnutrition is known to have caused stunted growth in various populations. This has been seen in North Korea, parts of Africa, certain historical Europe, and other populations. Developing countries such as Guatemala have rates of stunting in children under 5 living as high as 82.2% in Totonicapán, and 49.8% nationwide.

Average height in a nation is correlated with protein quality. Nations that consume more protein in the form of meat, dairy, eggs, and fish tend to be taller, while those that obtain more protein from cereals tend to be shorter. Therefore, populations with high cattle per capita and high consumption of dairy live longer and are taller. Historically, this can be seen in the cases of the United States, Argentina, New Zealand and Australia in the beginning of the 19th century. Moreover, when the production and consumption of milk and beef is taken to consideration, it can be seen why the Germanic people who lived outside of the Roman Empire were taller than those who lived at its heart.

== Role for an individual ==
=== Connection to health ===

Studies show that there is a correlation between small stature and a longer life expectancy. Individuals of small stature are also more likely to have lower blood pressure and are less likely to acquire cancer. The University of Hawaii has found that the &quot;longevity gene&quot; FOXO3 that reduces the effects of aging is more commonly found in individuals of a small body size. Short stature decreases the risk of venous insufficiency. Certain studies have shown that height is a factor in overall health while some suggest tallness is associated with better cardiovascular health and shortness with longevity. Cancer risk has also been found to grow with height. Moreover, scientists have also observed a protective effect of height on risk for Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, although this fact could be a result of the genetic overlap between height and intracraneal volume and there are also genetic variants influencing height that could affect biological mechanisms involved in Alzheimer&#x27;s disease etiology, such as insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1).

Nonetheless, modern westernized interpretations of the relationship between height and health fail to account for the observed height variations worldwide. Cavalli-Sforza and Cavalli-Sforza note that variations in height worldwide can be partly attributed to evolutionary pressures resulting from differing environments. These evolutionary pressures result in height-related health implications. While tallness is an adaptive benefit in colder climates such as those found in Europe, shortness helps dissipate body heat in warmer climatic regions. Consequently, the relationships between health and height cannot be easily generalized since tallness and shortness can both provide health benefits in different environmental settings.

In the end, being excessively tall can cause various medical problems, including cardiovascular problems, because of the increased load on the heart to supply the body with blood, and problems resulting from the increased time it takes the brain to communicate with the extremities. For example, Robert Wadlow, the tallest human known to verifiable history, developed difficulty in walking as his height increased throughout his life. In many of the pictures of the latter portion of his life, Wadlow can be seen gripping something for support. Late in his life, although he died at age 22, he had to wear braces on his legs and walk with a cane; and he died after developing an infection in his legs because he was unable to feel the irritation and cutting caused by his leg braces.

Sources are in disagreement about the overall relationship between height and longevity. Samaras and Elrick, in the Western Journal of Medicine, demonstrate an inverse correlation between height and longevity in several mammals including humans.

Women whose height is under may have a small pelvis, resulting in such complications during childbirth as shoulder dystocia.

A study done in Sweden in 2005 has shown that there is a strong inverse correlation between height and suicide among Swedish men.

A large body of human and animal evidence indicates that shorter, smaller bodies age more slowly, and have fewer chronic diseases and greater longevity. For example, a study found eight areas of support for the &quot;smaller lives longer&quot; thesis. These areas of evidence include studies involving longevity, life expectancy, centenarians, male vs. female longevity differences, mortality advantages of shorter people, survival findings, smaller body size due to calorie restriction, and within-species body size differences. They all support the conclusion that smaller individuals live longer in healthy environments and with good nutrition. However, the difference in longevity is modest. Several human studies have found a loss of 0.5 years/centimeter of increased height (1.2 yr/inch). But these findings do not mean that all tall people die young. Many live to advanced ages and some become centenarians.

In medicine, height is measured to monitor child development, this is a better indicator of growth than weight in the long term. For older people, excessive height loss is a symptom of osteoporosis. Height is also used to compute indicators like body surface area or body mass index.

=== Occupational success ===

There is a large body of research in psychology, economics, and human biology that has assessed the relationship between several physical features (e.g. body height) and occupational success. The correlation between height and success was explored decades ago. Shorter people are considered to have an advantage in certain sports (e.g. gymnastics, race car driving, etc.), whereas in many other sports taller people have a major advantage. In most occupational fields, body height is not relevant to how well people are able to perform; nonetheless several studies found that success was positively correlated with body height, although there may be other factors such as sex or socioeconomic status that are correlated with height which may account for the difference in success.

A demonstration of the height-success association can be found in the realm of politics. In the United States presidential elections, the taller candidate won 22 out of 25 times in the 20th century. Nevertheless, Ignatius Loyola, founder of the Jesuits, was and several prominent world leaders of the 20th century, such as Vladimir Lenin, Benito Mussolini, Nicolae Ceaușescu and Joseph Stalin were of below-average height. These examples, however, were all before modern forms of multimedia, i.e. television, which may further height discrimination in modern society. Further, growing evidence suggests that height may be a proxy for confidence, which is likewise strongly correlated with occupational success.

=== Extremes ===
The tallest living man is Sultan Kösen of Turkey at , and the tallest living woman is Rumeysa Gelgi, also of Turkey, at . The tallest man in modern history was Robert Wadlow (1918−1940), from Illinois, United States, who was at the time of his death. The tallest woman in modern history was Zeng Jinlian (1964−1982) of China, who measured at the time of her death. The shortest adult human on record was Chandra Bahadur Dangi (1939−2015) of Nepal at .

Until the wedding of former Chinese professional basketball player Sun Mingming on 4 August 2013, the tallest living married couple were ex-basketball players Yao Ming and Ye Li (both of China), standing at and respectively, giving a combined height of . They married in Shanghai, China, on 6 August 2007.

== Pre-modern period ==

In general, modern humans living in developed countries are taller than their ancient counterparts, but this was not always the case.

===Pre-modern times===
Certain ancient human populations were quite tall, even surpassing the average height of the tallest of modern countries. For instance, certain hunter-gatherer populations living in Europe during the Paleolithic Era and India during the Mesolithic Period averaged heights of around for males, and for females.

Human height worldwide sharply declined with the advent of the Neolithic Revolution, likely due to significantly less protein consumption by agriculturalists as compared with hunter-gatherers.

During the Bronze Age, height varied significantly by region. The people of the Indus Valley Civilization were among the tallest in the world, with an average height of for males and for females. The people of Ancient Egypt stood around for males and for females. The Ancient Greeks averaged for males and for females. The Romans were slightly taller, with an average height of for males and for females.

===18th century===
In the first half of the eighteenth century, the average height of an English male was , and the average height of an Irish male was , according to a study by economist John Komlos and Francesco Cinnirella. The estimated mean height of English, German, and Scottish soldiers was − for the period as a whole, while that of Irish was . The average height of male slaves and convicts in North America was .

Before the mid-nineteenth century, there were cycles in height, with periods of increase and decrease; however, apart from the decline associated with the transition to agriculture, examinations of skeletons show no significant differences in height from the Neolithic Revolution through the early 1800s.

===19th century===
In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, people of European descent in North America were far taller than those in Europe and were one of the tallest in the world. The original indigenous population of Plains Native Americans was also among the tallest populations of the world at the time. Some studies also suggest that there existed the correlation between the height and the real wage, moreover, the correlation was higher among the less developed countries. The difference in height between children from different social classes was already observed by the age of two.

The average height of Americans and Europeans decreased during periods of rapid industrialization, possibly due to rapid population growth and broad decreases in economic status. This has become known as the early-industrial growth puzzle (in the U.S. context the Antebellum Puzzle). In England during the early nineteenth century, the difference between the average height of English upper-class youth (students of Sandhurst Military Academy) and English working-class youth (Marine Society boys) reached , the highest that has been observed.

In general, there were no significant differences in regional height levels throughout the nineteenth century. The only exceptions of this rather uniform height distribution were people in the Anglo-Saxon settlement regions who were taller than the average and people from Southeast Asia with below-average heights. However, at the end of the nineteenth century and in the middle of the first globalization period, heights between rich and poor countries began to diverge. These differences did not disappear in the deglobalization period of the two World wars. In 2014, Baten and Blum found that in the nineteenth century, important determinants of height were the local availability of cattle, meat and milk as well as the local disease environment. In the late twentieth century, however, technologies and trade became more important, decreasing the impact of local availability of agricultural products.

====Netherlands====
Data derived from burials show that before 1850, the mean stature of males and females in Leiden, the Netherlands was respectively and . The average height of 19-year-old Dutch orphans in 1865 was .

From 1830 to 1857, the average height of a Dutch person decreased, even while Dutch real GNP per capita was growing at an average rate of more than 0.5% per year. The worst decline was in urban areas that in 1847, the urban height penalty was . Urban mortality was also much higher than in rural regions. In 1829, the average urban and rural Dutchman was . By 1856, the average rural Dutchman was and urban Dutchman was .

In the late nineteenth century, the Netherlands was a land renowned for its short population, but as of 2012 Dutch people were among the world&#x27;s tallest, with young men averaging tall.

==Modern period==
In the 150 years since the mid-nineteenth century, the average human height in industrialised countries has increased by up to . However, these increases appear to have largely levelled off.

A 2004 report citing a 2003 UNICEF study on the effects of malnutrition in North Korea, due to &quot;successive famines,&quot; found young adult males to be significantly shorter. In contrast South Koreans &quot;feasting on an increasingly Western-influenced diet,&quot; without famine, were growing taller. The height difference is minimal for Koreans over forty years old, who grew up at a time when economic conditions in the North were roughly comparable to those in the South, while height disparities are most acute for Koreans who grew up in the mid-1990s a demographic in which South Koreans are about taller than their North Korean counterparts as this was a period during which the North was affected by a harsh famine where hundreds of thousands, if not millions, died of hunger. A study by South Korean anthropologists of North Korean children who had defected to China found that eighteen-year-old males were shorter than South Koreans their age due to malnutrition.

The height of British children growing up during the years of austerity has decreased: As of 2019, the average five-year-old boy measured and the average girl . They were shorter and more obese than many of their European peers.

Adult height between populations often differs significantly. For example, the average height of women from the Czech Republic is greater than that of men from Malawi. This may be caused by genetic differences, childhood lifestyle differences (nutrition, sleep patterns, physical labor), or both.

Depending on sex, genetic and environmental factors, shrinkage of stature may begin in middle age in some individuals but tends to be universal in the extremely aged. This decrease in height is due to such factors as decreased height of inter-vertebral discs because of desiccation, atrophy of soft tissues, and postural changes secondary to degenerative disease.

Working on data of Indonesia, the study by Baten, Stegl and van der Eng suggests a positive relationship of economic development and average height. In Indonesia, human height has decreased coincidentally with natural or political shocks.

== Average around the world ==

As with any statistical data, the accuracy of the findings may be challenged. In this case, for the following reasons:

*Some studies may allow subjects to self-report values. Generally speaking, self-reported height tends to be taller than measured height, although the overestimation of height depends on the reporting subject&#x27;s height, age, gender and region.
*Test subjects may have been invited instead of random sampling, resulting in sampling bias.
*Some countries may have significant height gaps between different regions. For instance, one survey shows there is gap between the tallest state and the shortest state in Germany. Under such circumstances, the mean height may not represent the total population unless sample subjects are appropriately taken from all regions with using weighted average of the different regional groups.
*Different social groups can show different mean height. According to a study in France, executives and professionals are taller, and university students are taller than the national average. As this case shows, data taken from a particular social group may not represent a total population in some countries.
*Height measurement can vary over the course of a day, due to factors such as a decrease from exercise done directly before measurement (i.e. inversely correlated), or an increase since lying down for a significant period of time (i.e. positively correlated). For example, one study revealed a mean decrease of in the heights of 100 children from getting out of bed in the morning to between 4 and 5 p.m. that same day. Such factors may not have been controlled in all of the following studies.

Men from Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Netherlands, Montenegro and Serbia have the tallest average height.

A 2005 study found teenagers from the Dinaric Alps to be the tallest people in the world.

Dinka people are sometimes noted for their height, with the Tutsi of Rwanda believed to be the tallest people in Africa. In a sample of 52 Dinka Agaar, Roberts and Bainbridge reported a mean height of . In 227 Dinka Ruweng, they reported . Both figures derived from 1953 to 1954. In Tibet, the Khampas are known for their tall height. Mean height of male Khampas is .

== Measurement ==
Height measurements are by nature subject to statistical sampling errors even for a single individual. In a clinical situation, height measurements are seldom taken more often than once per office visit, which may mean sampling taking place a week to several months apart. The smooth 50th percentile male and female growth curves illustrated above are aggregate values from thousands of individuals sampled at ages from birth to age 20. In reality, a single individual&#x27;s growth curve shows large upward and downward spikes, partly due to actual differences in growth velocity, and partly due to small measurement errors.

For example, a typical measurement error of plus or minus may completely nullify 0.5 cm of actual growth resulting in either a &quot;negative&quot; 0.5 cm growth (due to overestimation in the previous visit combined with underestimation in the latter), up to a growth (the first visit underestimating and the second visit overestimating) in the same elapsed period between measurements. Note there is a discontinuity in the growth curves at age 2, which reflects the difference in recumbent length (with the child on his or her back), used in measuring infants and toddlers, and standing height typically measured from age 2 onwards.

Crown-rump length is the measurement of the length of human embryos and fetuses from the top of the head (crown) to the bottom of the buttocks (rump). It is typically determined from ultrasound imagery and can be used to estimate gestational age.

Until two years old, recumbent length is used to measure infants. Length measures the same dimension as height, but height is measured standing up while the length is measured lying down. In developed nations, the average total body length of a newborn is about , although premature newborns may be much smaller.

Standing height is used to measure children over two years old and adults who can stand without assistance. Measure is done with a stadiometer. In general, standing height is about less than recumbent length.

Surrogate height measurements are used when standing height and recumbent length are impractical. For sample Chumlea equation use knee height as indicator of stature. Other techniques include: arm span, sitting height, ulna length, etc.

<text>TrueCrypt is a discontinued source-available freeware utility used for on-the-fly encryption (OTFE). It can create a virtual encrypted disk within a file, encrypt a partition, or encrypt the whole storage device (pre-boot authentication).

On 28 May 2014, the TrueCrypt website announced that the project was no longer maintained and recommended users find alternative solutions. 
Though development of TrueCrypt has ceased, an independent audit of TrueCrypt (published in March 2015) has concluded that no significant flaws are present. Two projects forked from TrueCrypt: VeraCrypt (active) and CipherShed (abandoned).

== History ==

TrueCrypt was initially released as version 1.0 in February 2004, based on E4M (Encryption for the Masses). Several versions and many additional minor releases have been made since then, with the most current version being 7.1a.

=== E4M and SecurStar dispute ===
Original release of TrueCrypt was made by anonymous developers called &quot;the TrueCrypt Team&quot;. Shortly after version 1.0 was released in 2004, the TrueCrypt Team reported receiving email from Wilfried Hafner, manager of SecurStar, a computer security company. According to the TrueCrypt Team, Hafner claimed in the email that the acknowledged author of E4M, developer Paul Le Roux, had stolen the source code from SecurStar as an employee. It was further stated that Le Roux illegally distributed E4M, and authored an illegal license permitting anyone to base derivative work on the code and distribute it freely. Hafner alleges all versions of E4M always belonged only to SecurStar, and Le Roux did not have any right to release it under such a license.

This led the TrueCrypt Team to immediately stop developing and distributing TrueCrypt, which they announced online through usenet. TrueCrypt Team member David Tesařík stated that Le Roux informed the team that there was a legal dispute between himself and SecurStar, and that he received legal advisement not to comment on any issues of the case. Tesařík concluded that should the TrueCrypt Team continue distributing TrueCrypt, Le Roux may ultimately be held liable and be forced to pay consequent damages to SecurStar. To continue in good faith, he said, the team would need to verify the validity of the E4M license. However, because of Le Roux&#x27;s need to remain silent on the matter, he was unable to confirm or deny its legitimacy, keeping TrueCrypt development in limbo.

Thereafter, would-be visitors reported trouble accessing the TrueCrypt website, and third-party mirrors appeared online making the source code and installer continually available, outside of official sanction by the TrueCrypt Team.

In the FAQ section of its website, SecurStar maintains its claims of ownership over both E4M and Scramdisk, another free encryption program. The company states that with those products, SecurStar &quot;had a long tradition of open source software&quot;, but that &quot;competitors had nothing better to do but to steal our source code&quot;, causing the company to make its products closed-source, forcing potential customers to place a substantial order and sign a non-disclosure agreement before being allowed to review the code for security.

Le Roux himself has denied developing TrueCrypt in a court hearing in March 2016, in which he also confirmed he had written E4M.

=== Version 2.0 ===
Months later on 7 June 2004, TrueCrypt 2.0 was released. The new version contained a different digital signature from that of the original TrueCrypt Team, with the developers now being referred to as &quot;the TrueCrypt Foundation.&quot; The software license was also changed to the open source GNU General Public License (GPL). However, given the wide range of components with differing licenses making up the software, and the contested nature of the legality of the program&#x27;s release, a few weeks later on 21 June, version 2.1 was released under the original E4M license to avoid potential problems relating to the GPL license.

Version 2.1a of the software was released on 1 October 2004 on codice_1 sub-domain. By May 2005, the original TrueCrypt website returned and codice_1 redirected visitors to codice_3.

=== End of life announcement ===
On 28 May 2014, the TrueCrypt official website, codice_3, began redirecting visitors to codice_1 with a HTTP 301 &quot;Moved Permanently&quot; status, which warned that the software may contain unfixed security issues, and that development of TrueCrypt was ended in May 2014, following Windows XP&#x27;s end of support. The message noted that more recent versions of Windows have built-in support for disk encryption using BitLocker, and that Linux and OS X had similar built-in solutions, which the message states renders TrueCrypt unnecessary. The page recommends any data encrypted by TrueCrypt be migrated to other encryption setups and offered instructions on moving to BitLocker. The SourceForge project page for the software at codice_6 was updated to display the same initial message, and the status was changed to &quot;inactive&quot;. The page also announced a new software version, 7.2, which only allows decryption.

Initially, the authenticity of the announcement and new software was questioned. Multiple theories attempting to explain the reason behind the announcement arose throughout the tech community.

Shortly after the end of life announcement of TrueCrypt, Gibson Research Corporation posted an announcement titled &quot;Yes... TrueCrypt is still safe to use&quot; and a Final Release Repository to host the last official non-crippled version 7.1a of TrueCrypt. They no longer host the final release repository as of 2022.

Truecrypt.org has been excluded from the Internet Archive Wayback Machine. The exclusion policy says they will exclude pages at the site owner&#x27;s request.

== Operating systems ==
TrueCrypt supports Windows, OS X, and Linux operating systems. Both 32-bit and 64-bit versions of these operating systems are supported, except for Windows IA-64 (not supported) and Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard (runs as a 32-bit process). The version for Windows 7, Windows Vista, and Windows XP can encrypt the boot partition or entire boot drive.

=== Independent implementations ===
There is an independent, compatible implementation, tcplay, for DragonFly BSD and Linux.

The Dm-crypt module included in default Linux kernel supports a &quot;TrueCrypt&quot; target called &quot;tcw&quot; since Linux version 3.13.

== Encryption scheme ==

=== Algorithms ===
Individual ciphers supported by TrueCrypt are AES, Serpent, and Twofish. Additionally, five different combinations of cascaded algorithms are available: AES-Twofish, AES-Twofish-Serpent, Serpent-AES, Serpent-Twofish-AES and Twofish-Serpent. The cryptographic hash functions available for use in TrueCrypt are RIPEMD-160, SHA-512, and Whirlpool. Early versions of TrueCrypt until 2007 also supported the block ciphers Blowfish, CAST-128, TDEA and IDEA; but these were deprecated due to having relatively lower 64-bit security and patent licensing issues.

The practical security provided by TrueCrypt depends altogether on the applied encyption algorithms and their different weaknesses. TrueCrypt by itself offers no extra protection against a weak trusted algorithm.

=== Modes of operation ===
TrueCrypt currently uses the XTS mode of operation. Prior to this, TrueCrypt used LRW mode in versions 4.1 through 4.3a, and CBC mode in versions 4.0 and earlier. XTS mode is thought to be more secure than LRW mode, which in turn is more secure than CBC mode.

Although new volumes can only be created in XTS mode, TrueCrypt is backward compatible with older volumes using LRW mode and CBC mode. Later versions produce a security warning when mounting CBC mode volumes and recommend that they be replaced with new volumes in XTS mode.

=== Keys ===
The header key and the secondary header key (XTS mode) are generated using PBKDF2 with a 512-bit salt and 1000 or 2000 iterations, depending on the underlying hash function used.

== Plausible deniability ==
TrueCrypt supports a concept called plausible deniability, by allowing a single &quot;hidden volume&quot; to be created within another volume. In addition, the Windows versions of TrueCrypt have the ability to create and run a hidden encrypted operating system whose existence may be denied.

The TrueCrypt documentation lists many ways in which TrueCrypt&#x27;s hidden volume deniability features may be compromised (e.g. by third-party software which may leak information through temporary files, thumbnails, etc., to unencrypted disks) and possible ways to avoid this. In a paper published in 2008 and focused on the then latest version (v5.1a) and its plausible deniability, a team of security researchers led by Bruce Schneier states that Windows Vista, Microsoft Word, Google Desktop, and others store information on unencrypted disks, which might compromise TrueCrypt&#x27;s plausible deniability. The study suggested the addition of a hidden operating system functionality; this feature was added in TrueCrypt 6.0. When a hidden operating system is running, TrueCrypt also makes local unencrypted filesystems and non-hidden TrueCrypt volumes read-only to prevent data leaks. The security of TrueCrypt&#x27;s implementation of this feature was not evaluated because the first version of TrueCrypt with this option had only recently been released.

There was a functional evaluation of the deniability of hidden volumes in an earlier version of TrueCrypt by Schneier et al. that found security leaks.

=== Identifying TrueCrypt volumes ===
When analyzed, TrueCrypt volumes appear to have no header and contain random data. TrueCrypt volumes have sizes that are multiples of 512 due to the block size of the cipher mode and key data is either 512 bytes stored separately in the case of system encryption or two 128 kB headers for non-system containers. Forensics tools may use these properties of file size, apparent lack of a header, and randomness tests to attempt to identify TrueCrypt volumes. Although these features give reason to suspect a file to be a TrueCrypt volume, there are, however, some programs which exist for the purpose of securely erasing files by employing a method of overwriting file contents, and free disk space, with purely random data (i.e. &quot;shred&quot; &amp; &quot;scrub&quot;), thereby creating reasonable doubt to counter pointed accusations declaring a file, made of statistically random data, to be a TrueCrypt file.

If a system drive, or a partition on it, has been encrypted with TrueCrypt, then only the data on that partition is deniable. When the TrueCrypt boot loader replaces the normal boot loader, an offline analysis of the drive can positively determine that a TrueCrypt boot loader is present and so lead to the logical inference that a TrueCrypt partition is also present. Even though there are features to obfuscate its purpose (i.e. displaying a BIOS-like message to misdirect an observer such as, &quot;Non-system disk&quot; or &quot;disk error&quot;), these reduce the functionality of the TrueCrypt boot loader and do not hide the content of the TrueCrypt boot loader from offline analysis. Here again, the use of a hidden operating system is the suggested method for retaining deniability.

== Performance ==
TrueCrypt supports parallelized encryption for multi-core systems and, under Microsoft Windows, pipelined read/write operations (a form of asynchronous processing) to reduce the performance hit of encryption and decryption. On newer processors supporting the AES-NI instruction set, TrueCrypt supports hardware-accelerated AES to further improve performance. The performance impact of disk encryption is especially noticeable on operations which would normally use direct memory access (DMA), as all data must pass through the CPU for decryption, rather than being copied directly from disk to RAM.

In a test carried out by &quot;Tom&#x27;s Hardware&quot;, although TrueCrypt is slower compared to an unencrypted disk, the overhead of real-time encryption was found to be similar regardless of whether mid-range or state-of-the-art hardware is in use, and this impact was &quot;quite acceptable&quot;. In another article the performance cost was found to be unnoticeable when working with &quot;popular desktop applications in a reasonable manner&quot;, but it was noted that &quot;power users will complain&quot;.

=== Incompatibility with FlexNet Publisher and SafeCast ===

Installing third-party software which uses FlexNet Publisher or SafeCast (which are used for preventing software piracy on products by Adobe such as Adobe Photoshop) can damage the TrueCrypt bootloader on Windows partitions/drives encrypted by TrueCrypt and render the drive unbootable. This is caused by the inappropriate design of FlexNet Publisher writing to the first drive track and overwriting whatever non-Windows bootloader exists there.

== Security concerns ==

TrueCrypt is vulnerable to various known attacks which are also present in other disk encryption software releases such as BitLocker. To prevent those, the documentation distributed with TrueCrypt requires users to follow various security precautions. Some of those attacks are detailed below.

=== Encryption keys stored in memory ===
TrueCrypt stores its keys in RAM; on an ordinary personal computer the DRAM will maintain its contents for several seconds after power is cut (or longer if the temperature is lowered). Even if there is some degradation in the memory contents, various algorithms can intelligently recover the keys. This method, known as a cold boot attack (which would apply in particular to a notebook computer obtained while in power-on, suspended, or screen-locked mode), has been successfully used to attack a file system protected by TrueCrypt.

=== Physical security ===
TrueCrypt documentation states that TrueCrypt is unable to secure data on a computer if an attacker physically accessed it and TrueCrypt is used on the compromised computer by the user again (this does not apply to a common case of a stolen, lost, or confiscated computer). The attacker having physical access to a computer can, for example, install a hardware/software keylogger, a bus-mastering device capturing memory, or install any other malicious hardware or software, allowing the attacker to capture unencrypted data (including encryption keys and passwords), or to decrypt encrypted data using captured passwords or encryption keys. Therefore, physical security is a basic premise of a secure system. Attacks such as this are often called &quot;evil maid attacks&quot;.

=== Malware ===
TrueCrypt documentation states that TrueCrypt cannot secure data on a computer if it has any kind of malware installed. Malware may log keystrokes, thus exposing passwords to an attacker.

=== The &quot;Stoned&quot; bootkit ===
The &quot;Stoned&quot; bootkit, an MBR rootkit presented by Austrian software developer Peter Kleissner at the Black Hat Technical Security Conference USA 2009, has been shown capable of tampering TrueCrypt&#x27;s MBR, effectively bypassing TrueCrypt&#x27;s full volume encryption. Potentially every hard disk encryption software is affected by this kind of attack if the encryption software does not rely on hardware-based encryption technologies like TPM, or if the attack is made with administrative privileges while the encrypted operating system is running.

Two types of attack scenarios exist in which it is possible to maliciously take advantage of this bootkit: in the first one, the user is required to launch the bootkit with administrative privileges once the PC has already booted into Windows; in the second one, analogously to hardware keyloggers, a malicious person needs physical access to the user&#x27;s TrueCrypt-encrypted hard disk: in this context this is needed to modify the user&#x27;s TrueCrypt MBR with that of the Stoned bootkit and then place the hard disk back on the unknowing user&#x27;s PC, so that when the user boots the PC and types his/her TrueCrypt password on boot, the &quot;Stoned&quot; bootkit intercepts it thereafter because, from that moment on, the Stoned bootkit is loaded before TrueCrypt&#x27;s MBR in the boot sequence. The first type of attack can be prevented as usual by good security practices, e.g. avoid running non-trusted executables with administrative privileges. The second one can be successfully neutralized by the user if he/she suspects that the encrypted hard disk might have been physically available to someone he/she does not trust, by booting the encrypted operating system with TrueCrypt&#x27;s Rescue Disk instead of booting it directly from the hard disk. With the rescue disk, the user can restore TrueCrypt&#x27;s MBR to the hard disk.

=== Trusted Platform Module ===
The FAQ section of the TrueCrypt website states that the Trusted Platform Module (TPM) cannot be relied upon for security, because if the attacker has physical or administrative access to the computer and you use it afterwards, the computer could have been modified by the attacker e.g. a malicious component—such as a hardware keystroke logger—could have been used to capture the password or other sensitive information. Since the TPM does not prevent an attacker from maliciously modifying the computer, TrueCrypt will not support the TPM.

== Security audits ==
In 2013 a graduate student at Concordia University published a detailed online report, in which he states that he has confirmed the integrity of the distributed Windows binaries of version 7.1a.

A crowdfunding campaign attempting to conduct an independent security audit of TrueCrypt was successfully funded in October 2013. A non-profit organization called the Open Crypto Audit Project (OCAP) was formed, calling itself &quot;a community-driven global initiative which grew out of the first comprehensive public audit and cryptanalysis of the widely used encryption software TrueCrypt&quot;. The organization established contact with TrueCrypt developers, who welcomed the audit. Phase I of the audit was successfully completed on 14 April 2014, finding &quot;no evidence of backdoors or malicious code&quot;. Matthew D. Green, one of the auditors, added &quot;I think it&#x27;s good that we didn&#x27;t find anything super critical.&quot;

One day after TrueCrypt&#x27;s end of life announcement, OCAP confirmed that the audit would continue as planned, with Phase II expected to begin in June 2014 and wrap up by the end of September. The Phase II audit was delayed, but was completed 2 April 2015 by NCC Cryptography Services. This audit &quot;found no evidence of deliberate backdoors, or any severe design flaws that will make the software insecure in most instances&quot;. The French National Agency for the Security of Information Systems (ANSSI) stated that while TrueCrypt 6.0 and 7.1a have previously attained ANSSI certification, migration to an alternate certified product is recommended as a precautionary measure.

According to Gibson Research Corporation, Steven Barnhart wrote to an email address for a TrueCrypt Foundation member he had used in the past and received several replies from &quot;David&quot;. According to Barnhart, the main points of the email messages were that the TrueCrypt Foundation was &quot;happy with the audit, it didn&#x27;t spark anything&quot;, and that the reason for the announcement was that &quot;there is no longer interest [in maintaining the project].&quot;

According to a study released 29 September 2015, TrueCrypt includes two vulnerabilities in the driver that TrueCrypt installs on Windows systems allowing an attacker arbitrary code execution and privilege escalation via DLL hijacking. In January 2016, the vulnerability was fixed in VeraCrypt, but it remains unpatched in TrueCrypt&#x27;s unmaintained installers.

== Legal cases ==

=== Operation Satyagraha ===
In July 2008, several TrueCrypt-secured hard drives were seized from Brazilian banker Daniel Dantas, who was suspected of financial crimes. The Brazilian National Institute of Criminology (INC) tried unsuccessfully for five months to obtain access to his files on the TrueCrypt-protected disks. They enlisted the help of the FBI, who used dictionary attacks against Dantas&#x27; disks for over 12 months, but were still unable to decrypt them.

=== &quot;United States v. John Doe&quot; ===
In 2012 the United States 11th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that a &quot;John Doe&quot; TrueCrypt user could not be compelled to decrypt several of his hard drives. The court&#x27;s ruling noted that FBI forensic examiners were unable to get past TrueCrypt&#x27;s encryption (and therefore were unable to access the data) unless Doe either decrypted the drives or gave the FBI the password, and the court then ruled that Doe&#x27;s Fifth Amendment right to remain silent legally prevented the Government from making them do so.

=== David Miranda ===
On 18 August 2013 David Miranda, partner of journalist Glenn Greenwald, was detained at London&#x27;s Heathrow Airport by Metropolitan Police while en route to Rio de Janeiro from Berlin. He was carrying with him an external hard drive said to be containing sensitive documents pertaining to the 2013 global surveillance disclosures sparked by Edward Snowden. Contents of the drive were encrypted by TrueCrypt, which authorities said &quot;renders the material extremely difficult to access&quot;. Detective Superintendent Caroline Goode stated the hard drive contained around 60 gigabytes of data, &quot;of which only 20 have been accessed to date.&quot; She further stated the process to decode the material was complex and &quot;so far only 75 documents have been reconstructed since the property was initially received.&quot;

&quot;Guardian&quot; contributor Naomi Colvin concluded the statements were misleading, stating that it was possible Goode was not even referring to any actual encrypted material, but rather deleted files reconstructed from unencrypted, unallocated space on the hard drive, or even plaintext documents from Miranda&#x27;s personal effects. Greenwald supported this assessment in an interview with &quot;Democracy Now!&quot;, mentioning that the UK government filed an affidavit asking the court to allow them to retain possession of Miranda&#x27;s belongings. The grounds for the request were that they could not break the encryption, and were only able to access 75 of the documents that he was carrying, which Greenwald said &quot;most of which were probably ones related to his school work and personal use&quot;.

=== Lauri Love ===
In October 2013, British–Finnish activist Lauri Love was arrested by the National Crime Agency (NCA) on charges of hacking into a US department or agency computer and one count of conspiring to do the same. The government confiscated all of his electronics and demanded he provide them with the necessary keys to decrypt the devices. Love refused. On 10 May 2016 a District Judge (Magistrate&#x27;s Court) rejected a request by the NCA that Love be forced to turn over his encryption keys or passwords to TrueCrypt files on an SD card and hard drives that were among the confiscated property.

=== James DeSilva ===
In February 2014, an Arizona Department of Real Estate IT department employee, James DeSilva, was arrested on charges of sexual exploitation of a minor through the sharing of explicit images over the Internet. His computer, encrypted with TrueCrypt, was seized, and DeSilva refused to reveal the password. Forensics detectives from the Maricopa County Sheriff&#x27;s Office were unable to gain access to his stored files.

=== Druking ===
In the special prosecutor investigation for Druking in South Korea, the special prosecutor decrypted some of the files encrypted by TrueCrypt by guessing the passphrase.

The special prosecutor said the hidden volumes were especially difficult to deal with. He decrypted some of encrypted files by trying words and phrases the druking group had used elsewhere as parts of the passphrase in order to make educated guesses.

== License and source model ==

TrueCrypt was released as source-available, under the &quot;TrueCrypt License,&quot; which is unique to the TrueCrypt software. As of version 7.1a (the last full version of the software, released Feb 2012), the TrueCrypt License was version 3.0. It is not part of the panoply of widely used open source licenses. The Free Software Foundation (FSF) states that it is not a free software license.

Discussion of the licensing terms on the Open Source Initiative (OSI)&#x27;s license-discuss mailing list in October 2013 suggests that the TrueCrypt License has made progress towards compliance with the Open Source Definition but would not yet pass if proposed for certification as Open Source software. According to current OSI president Simon Phipps:

...it is not at all appropriate for [TrueCrypt] to describe itself as &quot;open source&quot;. This use of the term &quot;open source&quot; to describe something under a license that&#x27;s not only unapproved by OSI but known to be subject to issues is unacceptable. ... As OSI director and open source expert Karl Fogel said, &quot;The ideal solution is not to have them remove the words &#x27;open source&#x27; from their self-description, but rather for their software to be under an OSI-approved open source license.&quot;

As a result of its questionable status with regard to copyright restrictions and other potential legal issues, major Linux distributions do not consider the TrueCrypt License free: TrueCrypt is not included with Debian, Ubuntu, Fedora, or openSUSE.

===End of life and license version 3.1===
28 May 2014 announcement of discontinuation of TrueCrypt also came with a new version 7.2 of the software. Among the many changes to the source code from the previous release were changes to the TrueCrypt License — including removal of specific language that required attribution of TrueCrypt as well as a link to the official website to be included on any derivative products — forming a license version 3.1.

Cryptographer Matthew Green, who had help raise funds for TrueCrypt&#x27;s audit noted a connection between TrueCrypt&#x27;s refusal to change the license and their departure-time warning. &quot;They set the whole thing on fire, and now maybe nobody is going to trust it because they&#x27;ll think there&#x27;s some big evil vulnerability in the code.&quot;

On 16 June 2014, the only alleged TrueCrypt developer still answering email replied to a message by Matthew Green asking for permission to use the TrueCrypt trademark for a fork released under a standard open source license. Permission was denied, which led to the two known forks being named VeraCrypt and CipherShed as well as a re-implementation named tc-play rather than TrueCrypt.

== Trademarks ==
In 2007 a US trademark for &quot;TrueCrypt&quot; was registered under the name of &quot;Ondrej Tesarik&quot; with a company name &quot;TrueCrypt Developers Association&quot; and a trademark on the &quot;key&quot; logo was registered under the name of &quot;David Tesarik&quot; with a company name &quot;TrueCrypt Developers Association&quot;.

In 2009 the company name &quot;TrueCrypt Foundation&quot; was registered in the US by a person named David Tesarik. The TrueCrypt Foundation non-profit organization last filed tax returns in 2010, and the company was dissolved in 2014.

<doc id="905964" wikidata="Q794151" url="?curid=905964" title="Open Water (film)">
<text>Open Water is a 2003 American survival horror thriller film. The story concerns an American couple who go scuba diving while on vacation, only to find themselves stranded miles from shore in shark-filled waters when the crew of their boat accidentally leaves them behind.

The film is loosely based on the true story of Tom and Eileen Lonergan, who in 1998 went out with a scuba diving group, Outer Edge Dive Company, on the Great Barrier Reef, and were accidentally left behind because the dive-boat crew failed to take an accurate headcount.

The film was financed by the husband and wife team of writer/director Chris Kentis and producer Laura Lau, both avid scuba divers. It cost $120,000 to make and was bought by Lions Gate Entertainment for $2.5 million after its screening at the Sundance Film Festival. Lions Gate spent a further $8 million on distribution and marketing. The film ultimately grossed $55.5 million worldwide (including $30 million from the North American box office alone).

Before filming began, the Lonergans&#x27; experience was re-created for an episode of ABC&#x27;s &quot;20/20&quot;, and the segment was repeated after the release of &quot;Open Water&quot;. Clips from the film were also featured on NBC in &quot;Troubled Waters&quot;, a &quot;Dateline&quot; episode (July 7, 2008) with Matt Lauer interviewing two professional divers, Richard Neely and Ally Dalton, who were left adrift at the Great Barrier Reef by a dive boat on May 21, 2008.

==Plot==
Daniel Kintner and Susan Watkins are frustrated that their hard-working lives do not allow them to spend much time together. They go on a scuba-diving vacation to help improve their relationship. On their second day, they join a group scuba dive. A head count is taken, and the passenger total is recorded as 20. Daniel and Susan decide to separate briefly from the group while underwater. Half an hour later, the group returns to the boat; two members of the group are inadvertently counted twice, so the dive master thinks that everyone is back on board, and the boat leaves the site. However, Daniel and Susan are still underwater, unaware that the others have returned to shore. When they resurface, the boat has gone. They believe that the group will soon return to recover them.

Stranded at sea, it slowly dawns on Daniel and Susan that their boat is not coming back for them. They bicker, battle bouts of hunger and mental exhaustion, and realize they have probably drifted far from the dive site. They also realize that sharks have been circling them below the surface. Soon, jellyfish appear, stinging them both, while sharks come close. Susan receives a small shark bite on the leg but does not immediately realize it. Daniel goes under and discovers a small fish feeding on the exposed flesh of her bite wound. Later, a shark bites Daniel, and the wound begins to bleed profusely. Susan removes her weight belt and uses it to apply pressure to Daniel&#x27;s wound, but he appears to go into shock. After night falls, sharks return and attack Daniel during a storm, killing him. The next morning, Daniel and Susan&#x27;s belongings are finally noticed on the boat by a crew member, and he realizes that they must have been left at the dive site. A massive search for the couple begins immediately.

Susan realizes that Daniel is dead and releases him into the water, where sharks pull him down in a feeding frenzy. After putting on her mask, she looks beneath the surface and sees several large sharks circling her. Susan looks around one last time for any sign of coming rescue. Seeing none, she removes her scuba gear and disappears below the water. Sometime later, a fishing crew cuts open a newly caught shark&#x27;s stomach, finding a diving camera (apparently that of Daniel and Susan). One of the fishermen states offhandedly to another, &quot;Wonder if it works.&quot;

==Cast==
* Blanchard Ryan as Susan Watkins
* Daniel Travis as Daniel Kintner
* Saul Stein as Seth
* Michael E. Williamson as Davis
* Cristina Zenato as Linda
* John Charles as Junior
* Estelle Lau as Affected-Ear Diver

==Production==
The filmmakers used live sharks, as opposed to the mechanical ones used in &quot;Jaws&quot; or the computer-generated fish in &quot;Deep Blue Sea&quot;. The film strives for authentic shark behavior, shunning the stereotypical exaggerated shark behavior typical of many films. The movie was shot on digital video. As noted above, the real-life events that inspired this story took place in the southern Pacific Ocean, and this film moves the location to the Atlantic Ocean, being filmed in The Bahamas, the United States Virgin Islands, the Grenadines, and Mexico.

During the audition, Chris Kentis and Laura Lau made it clear to Blanchard Ryan and Daniel Travis that they would work with real sharks in the film and that it was non-negotiable. &quot;So I was like &#x27;okay, that&#x27;s fine&#x27; and I hadn&#x27;t been offered the part or anything yet, and then when I was offered the part, that had already been negotiated,&quot; said Blanchard.

==Reception==
&quot;Open Water&quot; received mostly positive reviews. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 71% based on 196 reviews with an average rating of 6.57/10. The consensus reads: &quot;A low-budget thriller with some intense moments.&quot; On Metacritic, the film holds a score of 63 out of 100, based on reviews from 38 critics&#x27; reviews, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;.

Most critics praised the film for its intensity and minimalist filmmaking, although it was not as well-received by audiences. Writing in the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;, Roger Ebert praised the film highly: &quot;Rarely, but sometimes, a movie can have an actual physical effect on you. It gets under your defenses and sidesteps the &#x27;it&#x27;s only a movie&#x27; reflex and creates a visceral feeling that might as well be real&quot;. In a much less favorable review, A. O. Scott in &quot;The New York Times&quot; lamented that it &quot;succeeds in mobilizing the audience&#x27;s dread, but it fails to make us care as much as we should about the fate of its heroes&quot;.

===Box office===
&quot;Open Water&quot; was produced for $120,000, and grossed $1 million in 47 theaters on its opening weekend. Its final worldwide gross is $54.7 million.

===Accolades===
==Sequels==
In 2006, a film marketed as a sequel titled &quot;Open Water 2: Adrift&quot; was released, although its plot is unrelated to &quot;Open Water&quot;. A third film in the series titled, &quot;Open Water 3: Cage Dive&quot; was released in 2017, following the first film&#x27;s plot of being a survival shark film, although unrelated story-wise.

<doc id="905971" wikidata="Q249288" url="?curid=905971" title="Three Amigos">
<text>¡Three Amigos! is a 1986 American Western comedy film directed by John Landis, written by Lorne Michaels, Steve Martin, and Randy Newman (who also wrote the film&#x27;s songs), produced by Michaels and George Folsey Jr. (who also served as second unit director), and starring Martin, Chevy Chase, Martin Short, Alfonso Arau, Tony Plana, Patrice Martinez, and Joe Mantegna. It is the story of three American silent film stars who are mistaken for real heroes by the suffering people of a small Mexican village. The actors must find a way to live up to their reputation and stop a malevolent group of bandits.

Orion Pictures released &quot;Three Amigos&quot; on December 12, 1986, and it earned $39.2 million against a budget of $25 million.

==Plot==

In 1916, the bandit El Guapo and his gang collect tribute from the Mexican village of Santa Poco. Carmen, the village leader&#x27;s daughter, searches for someone who can rescue her townspeople. Visiting a village church, she sees a silent film featuring The Three Amigos, a trio of gunfighters who protect the vulnerable. Believing they are real heroes, Carmen sends a telegram asking them to come and stop El Guapo.

At Goldsmith Pictures in California, Lucky Day, Dusty Bottoms, and Ned Nederlander, the actors who portray the Amigos, demand a salary increase for their next project but their supervisor Harry Flugelman dismisses them from the studio instead. They soon receive Carmen&#x27;s telegram, misinterpreting it as a job offer to perform a show in Santa Poco. The Amigos enter the studio to retrieve their costumes and head for Mexico.

At a cantina near Santa Poco, a German pilot inquires about El Guapo and demands respect for his friends who will arrive soon. The Amigos stop at the cantina in costume soon afterward and are assumed to be the German&#x27;s friends. They mistake the fearful patrons for star-struck fans and perform a cheerful song and dance (&quot;My Little Buttercup&quot;). After they leave, the German&#x27;s associates arrive and shoot up the cantina when the off-guard patrons mock their fine clothes. Carmen picks up the Amigos and takes them to the village, where they are pampered in the best house in town.

The following day, when El Guapo&#x27;s men raid the village, the Amigos do a Hollywood-style stunt show that leaves the men bemused. The bandits ride off, making the villagers think they have defeated the enemy. The village throws a victory party for the Amigos. The following day, El Guapo and his gang come to Santa Poco and call them out, but they think it&#x27;s another show. After Lucky is shot, they realize they are confronting real bandits and beg for mercy, explaining that they are harmless actors. El Guapo decides they are not worth killing, orders the village looted, and kidnaps Carmen. The Amigos leave Santa Poco in disgrace.

Ned persuades Lucky and Dusty to defeat El Guapo and become real heroes. They try summoning a magical swordsman to locate El Guapo, but Dusty botches the ritual and shoots the swordsman. At his hideout, El Guapo prepares for his 40th birthday party, when he will accept a shipment of weapons from the German and then bed Carmen. The Amigos find the hideout by following the German&#x27;s plane and swinging in from the outer wall with mixed results. Lucky is immediately captured and chained in a dungeon, Dusty crashes into Carmen&#x27;s room, and Ned is suspended from a piñata.

Lucky frees himself, but Dusty and Ned are discovered and held captive. The German, having idolized Ned&#x27;s quick-draw and gun-spinning pistol skills in childhood, challenges him to a shootout. Ned kills the German, and Lucky holds El Guapo at gunpoint long enough for Carmen and the Amigos to escape in the German&#x27;s plane.

Returning to Santa Poco with El Guapo&#x27;s army in pursuit, the Amigos rally the villagers to stand up for themselves with their best talent, sewing. The bandits arrive and are shot at by Amigos from all sides, forcing them to retreat as El Guapo takes a fatal wound. The villagers, all dressed as Amigos, gather around him. He compliments the Three Amigos on their cleverness, then shoots Lucky in the foot before dying.

The villagers offer the Amigos all their money, but they refuse it, stating, &quot;Our reward is that justice has been done.&quot; They then ride off into the sunset.

==Production==
The film was written by Steve Martin, Lorne Michaels, and Randy Newman. Martin had the initial idea and commissioned two writers to write it, but he didn&#x27;t like their script. When he showed the script to Michaels, he suggested they throw out the other script and that the two of them co-write the movie. They wound up adding Randy Newman as a co-writer to work on the songs for the movie. Martin originally had the working title &quot;Three Caballeros&quot;, the same as the Disney cartoon.

Newman contributed three original songs: &quot;The Ballad of the Three Amigos&quot;, &quot;My Little Buttercup&quot;, and &quot;Blue Shadows on the Trail&quot;, and the musical score was composed by Elmer Bernstein.

The film was shot outside Grants, New Mexico, and in Simi Valley, California; Coronado National Forest; Old Tucson Studios; Culver City and Hollywood.

During post-production, John Landis was on trial over the &quot;Twilight Zone&quot; tragedy and could only edit at night. When he turned his final cut over to the studio, they took over and removed many scenes.

Martin performed his own lasso tricks for the film — a skill he acquired at the age of twelve while working at Disneyland.

The production went through many cast changes before filming. Martin had been attached to the project since 1980 and he, Dan Aykroyd, and John Belushi were originally going to star. At one point, Steven Spielberg was slated to direct; he wanted Martin, Bill Murray, and Robin Williams to play Lucky, Dusty, and Ned, respectively. After Belushi was offered the part, it next went to John Candy. Candy recommended Short to Martin, as they had worked together at SCTV. Martin and Short became close friends and continue to perform together. Candy was later seen riding a horse in the 1991 film &quot;Delirious&quot;. While Steve Martin has top billing in some posters as well as DVD covers today, Chevy Chase has top billing in the film itself.

Martin reportedly developed tinnitus after filming a pistol-shooting scene. But in an interview with &quot;Pitchfork&quot;, he clarified that the tinnitus was from years of listening to loud music and performing for noisy crowds.

There were difficulties between the main actors and Landis. Most famously, Chase refused to tell a particular joke that he thought would make his character look like a &quot;moron&quot;. Chase agreed to do the line after Landis threatened to give it to Short instead. Chase recalled making a &quot;hideous&quot; insult about Landis&#x27;s supposed lack of stunt precautions at a cliff, in reference to Landis&#x27;s ongoing &quot;Twilight Zone&quot; accidental death trial, which Landis overheard on live microphone and over which he nearly started a fistfight. Chase later said that making this movie was &quot;the most fun I&#x27;ve ever had&quot;.

===Deleted scenes===
Several deleted scenes were included in the Blu-ray release. An alternative opening features Santo Poco being pillaged by El Guapo and his men, prompting Carmen&#x27;s search for help. Extended sequences of the Three Amigos at the studio mansion and backlot lead into another deleted subplot involving an up-and-coming rival actress at the studio, Miss Rene (Fran Drescher). A billboard featuring a Miss Rene film is visible when the Amigos steal their costumes from the studio.

A number of deleted scenes featuring Sam Kinison as a mountain man were lost, as were most of Drescher&#x27;s other scenes.

==Music==
Elmer Bernstein wrote the score for &quot;Three Amigos&quot; and Randy Newman wrote the songs.

==Reception==

===Box office===
&quot;Three Amigos&quot; grossed $39.2 million in the U.S.

===Critical response===
On Rotten Tomatoes the film holds an approval rating of 45% based on 42 reviews and an average rating of 5.2/10. The site&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;&quot;Three Amigos!&quot; stars a trio of gifted comedians and has an agreeably silly sense of humor, but they&#x27;re often adrift in a dawdling story with too few laugh-out-loud moments.&quot; On Metacritic it has a weighted average score of 52 out of 100 based on 13 reviews, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;. Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade &quot;B&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave the film one star out of four, writing, &quot;The ideas to make &quot;Three Amigos&quot; into a good comedy are here, but the madness is missing.&quot; Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that it was &quot;likable&quot; but lacked a &quot;distinctive style&quot;, though certain jokes are crafted with &quot;enjoyable sophistication&quot;. Caroline Wetsbrook of &quot;Empire&quot; awarded the film three out of five stars and wrote that it was &quot;good-natured enough to sustain its ultimately thin premise&quot;.

Neil McNally of the website &quot;Den of Geek&quot; called it a cult film that was &quot;unfairly overlooked&quot; when first released and praised the performances of Martin, Chase, and Short; the comedic timing of Landis&#x27;s direction; and Bernstein&#x27;s &quot;sweeping, majestic&quot; score. The film was ranked 79th on Bravo&#x27;s list of the &quot;100 Funniest Movies&quot;.

<text>The Xavante (also Shavante, Chavante, Akuen, A&#x27;uwe, Akwe, Awen, or [[Akwen]]) are an indigenous people, comprising about 30,000 individuals within the territory of eastern Mato Grosso state in Brazil. They speak the Xavante language, part of the Jê language family.

==History==
They were enslaved in the 18th century, after which they have tried to avoid contact. A temporary coexistence with westernized society in the 19th century in the state of Goiás, was followed by withdrawal to Mato Grosso (between 1830 and 1860). They were &quot;re-discovered&quot; during the 1930s. From 1946 to 1957, they were brought under Getúlio Vargas&#x27; National Integration Program, but still experienced massacres and disease. Due to this history, they have a distrust of non-Xavante people. Today they are still wary of any approach of non-Xavante, called &quot;waradzu&quot;.

The Xavante leader Mário Juruna was the first indigenous Brazilian to become a federal representative.

The Xavante, like other indigenous tribes, were treated badly by the government beginning in the 1960s, the Xavante were moved from their homeland in Mato Grosso to a southern, malnourished area of Brazil. There, thousands of natives died due to disease, famine and warfare. Within the last decade, the Xavante have been relocated back to their original lands. Unfortunately, due to landgrabbing and squatters, the land was destroyed. Lush forest was burned to create sparse wasteland and pasture.

==Genetic origins==
A 2015 genetic study reached a surprising conclusion about the origins of the Xavante people. Unlike other Native American peoples, the Paiter-Surui, Karitiana, and Xavante have an ancestry partially related to indigenous Australasian populations of the Andaman Islands, New Guinea, and Australia. Scientists speculate that the relationship derives from an earlier people, called &quot;Population Y&quot;, in East Asia from whence both groups diverged 15,000 to 30,000 years ago, the future Australasians migrating south and the remote ancestors of the Xavante northward finding their way to the New World and to the interior Amazon Basin.

==Culture==
The people may be most famous for their dualistic societal structure. Two clans, the Âwawẽ and Po&#x27;reza&#x27;õno compose the culture, and marriage is not allowed between members of the same clan. An example of inter-clan relationships are the traditional log races, where the two clans compete in a race to carry palm tree trunks weighing as much as 80 kg to a defined point.

The Xavante are also known for their complex initiation rituals for young males, such as when small wooden sticks are inserted in the earlobes at the age of fourteen. As time passes, the size of these adornments is increased for the rest of their lives.

In 1996 the Brazilian heavy metal band Sepultura stayed and recorded with the Xavante people, who are featured on their album &quot;Roots&quot;. A small number of Xavante even travelled to São Paulo to partake in Sepultura&#x27;s Barulho Contra Fome (&quot;Noise Against Hunger&quot;) concert in 1998 that marked the start of their tour for their follow-up album, &quot;Against&quot;, where their presence was featured in the music video for the song &quot;Choke&quot;.

<text>European multilateral defence procurement refers to the collective armaments purchasing policies of European nations.

European countries hope to establish a profitable export competing the American one.

==Industry==
In 2015, the German Krauss-Maffei Wegmann (KMW) and French Nexter merged under a joint holding company KMW+Nexter Defense Systems. Both companies are major producers of military land systems. 

Other major European defence contractors include:
*Airbus Defence and Space — (Europe)
*Airbus Helicopters — (Europe)
*BAE Systems — (UK)
*Dassault Aviation — (France)
*Damen Group — (Netherlands)
*Diehl Defence — (Germany)
*Kongsberg Defence &amp; Aerospace — (Norway)
*Leonardo S.p.A., including the former AgustaWestland — (Italy)
*Naval Group — (France)
*Navantia — (Spain)
*Rheinmetall — (Germany)
*Rolls-Royce — (UK)
*Saab Group — (Sweden)
*Safran — (France)
*Thales Group — (France)
*ThyssenKrupp Marine Systems — (Germany)

==Products==
Then British Prime Minister Tony Blair came under pressure from President Bill Clinton to select Raytheon&#x27;s future missile to arm the Eurofighter, however the UK government selected the European Meteor air-to-air missile.

Airbus Group CEO Tom Enders has called the difficulties in coordinating European investment in the A400M program a &quot;horror&quot;, and said &quot;I am determined, at least for my company, not to ever again walk into such a program&quot;.

French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel have signalled their countries intention to co-operate on the development of a future combat aircraft to be produced as a replacement for Dassault Rafale and Eurofighter Typhoon.

== Code of Conduct on Defence Procurement ==
The European Union has adopted a code of conduct with the objective to inject transparency and competition into the military procurement. It is administered by the EDA and under its scope are contracts under Article 346 of TFEU, of at least €1 million and with the exclusions of weapons of mass destruction, cryptographic equipment and other procurements.

As of 2009 the code is adopted by Norway and all EDA members except Romania, who may join later.

<doc id="905988" wikidata="Q51632441" url="?curid=905988" title="Spanish influence on Filipino culture">
<text>The Spanish influence on Filipino culture originated from the Spanish East Indies, which was ruled from Mexico City and Madrid. A variety of aspects of the customs and traditions in the Philippines today can be traced back to Spanish and Novohispanic (Mexican) influence.

==Background==

Spanish settlement in the Philippines first took place in the 1500s, during the Spanish colonial period of the islands, which were ruled as a territory of New Spain (Mexico), until the independence of the Mexican empire in 1821; thereafter they were ruled from Spain itself. The conquistador Miguel López de Legazpi left New Spain and founded the first Spanish settlement in Cebu in 1565 and later established Manila as the capital of the Spanish East Indies in 1571. The Philippine Islands are named after King Philip.
Spaniards are referred to by Filipinos as &quot;Kastila&quot; (Castilian) named after the former Kingdom of Castile, now a region of Spain. The small population of Filipinos which have Spanish ancestry are descendants of people from Spain and New Spain (Mexico) who came during the colonial era. Another term for them is Spanish Filipino.

==History before Hispanization==
Some of the societies scattered in the islands remained isolated but many evolved into states that developed substantial trade and contacts with the peoples of Eastern and Southern Asia, including those from India, China, Japan and other Austronesian islands (The Malay Archipelago).

The 1st millennium saw the rise of the harbor principalities and their growth into maritime states composed of autonomous barangays independent of, or allied with larger nations which were either Malay thalassocracies, led by Datus or Indianized kingdoms governed by Rajahs.

==Language==

Philippine Spanish (Spanish: Español Filipino, Castellano Filipino) is a variant of standard Spanish spoken in the Philippines. It is a Spanish dialect of the Spanish language.

Chavacano, a Spanish-based creole, is spoken in the Zamboanga Peninsula (where it is an official language), Davao, and Cotabato in Mindanao, and Cavite in Luzon.

In addition to English, Filipinos today speak a variety of languages including Cebuano, Tagalog, Ilocano, Ilonggo, and Bikolano, all of which are 90% Austronesian languages, and contain several Spanish loanwords. Despite years of colonial rule, the Philippines retained its culture and various languages.

The most common languages spoken in the Philippines today are English and Filipino, the national language that is a standardised form of Tagalog. Spanish was an official language of the country until immediately after the People Power Revolution in February 1986 and the subsequent ratification of the 1987 Constitution. The new charter dropped Spanish as an official language and today it is very rare to find a native Spanish speaker, less than 0.1% of the population.

However, the government of Gloria Macapagal Arroyo, the fourteenth president of the Philippines and a Hispanophone, reintroduced the study of Spanish into the state school system.

==Name of the Philippines==
The name of the Philippines comes from the king of Spain Philip II. It was given by the Spanish explorer Ruy López de Villalobos who named the islands of Samar and Leyte &quot;Las Islas Felipinas&quot; (The Philippine Islands), during his expedition in 1543. Throughout the colonial period, the name Felipinas (Philippines) was used, and became the official name of the Philippines.

There are many provinces in the Philippines with Spanish names, such as Nueva Vizcaya, Nueva Écija (Nueva Ecija), Laguna, Isabela, Quirino, Aurora, La Unión (La Union), Marinduque, Antique, Negros Occidental, Negros Oriental, Nueva Segovia and Valle de Compostela.

Many cities and towns are also named in Spanish, such as Medellin, La Libertad, Naga, Camarines Sur (prior to 1919 was known as &quot;Nueva Cáceres&quot;), Las Piñas, Prosperidad, Isabela, Sierra Bullones, Angeles, La Paz, Esperanza, Buenavista, Pilar, La Trinidad, Garcia Hernandez, Trece Martires, Los Baños, and many more. There are numerous other towns and cities named after saints, such as San Fernando, Santa Rosa, San Isidro, San José, San Juan and San Pablo, as well as after Spanish places like Madrid, Santander, Toledo, Cádiz, Valencia, Murcia, Lucena, and Pamplona.

Other native Filipino names are spelled using Spanish orthography, such as Cagayán de Oro, Parañaque, and Cebú.

===Filipino Spanish surnames===
A Spanish or Latin-sounding surname does not necessarily denote Spanish ancestry in the Philippines. The names were adopted when a Spanish naming system was implemented.

After the Spanish conquest of the Philippine islands, many early Christianized Filipinos assumed surnames based on religious instruments or the names of saints. This resulted in many people surnamed &quot;de Los Santos&quot; (&quot;of the Saints&quot;), &quot;de la Cruz&quot; (&quot;of the Cross&quot;), &quot;del Rosario&quot; (&quot;of the Rosary&quot;), &quot;Bautista&quot; (&quot;Baptist&quot;), and &quot;de Jesus&quot; (&quot;of Jesus&quot;).

On November 21, 1849, the Spanish Governor-General of the Philippine Islands, Narciso Clavería, decreed the systematic distribution of surnames and the implementation of the Spanish naming system for the Filipinos. This produced the &quot;Catálogo alfabético de apellidos&quot; (&quot;Alphabetical Catalogue of Surnames&quot;) listing Hispanicized Chinese and Filipino words, names, and numbers. Surnames of Spanish nobility and several colonial administrators, which include the preposition &quot;de&quot; as a nobiliary particle, were explicitly prohibited. Many names which resulted are not common to the Hispanophone world, because they were Hispanicized from the original Filipino or Chinese. This new naming system also did away with the Filipino custom of siblings taking different surnames.

==Religion==

The Philippines is one of two predominantly Christian countries in Asia, the other being East Timor. About 81% of the population is Catholic, 11% belong to Protestant or other Christian denominations, 5.6% are Muslim, and about 2% practice other religions or are irreligious.

Filipinos at home set up altars in the Hispanic tradition adorned with Catholic images, flowers, and candles. During fiestas, most communities organise church services and religious processions in honor of a patron saint, hold funfairs and concerts, and feast with a variety of Filipino foods.

===Festivities===
All major Christian holidays are observed as official national holidays in the Philippines. Spanish culture and Christianity has influenced the customs and traditions of the Philippines.

Every year on the 3rd Sunday of January, the Philippines celebrates the festival of the &quot;Santo Niño&quot; (Holy Child Jesus), the largest being held in Cebu City.

===Holidays===
*January 1 – New Year&#x27;s Day (Bagong Taon)
*March or April – Semana Santa (Holy Week or Easter)
*October 31 to November 2 – Day of the Dead, Araw ng mga Kaluluwa (All Souls&#x27; Day), and Todos Los Santos (All Saints&#x27; Day) where families spend much of the 3 days and 3 evenings visiting their ancestral graves, showing respect and honoring the departed relatives by feasting, decorating and offering prayers.
*December 24 – Nochebuena (The Good night or Christmas Eve)
*December 25 – Christmas (Pasko)

==Arts, literature and music==
Hispanic influence is based on Indigenous, and European tradition. Folk dance, music and literature have remained intact in the 21st century. These were introduced from Spain in the 16th century and can be regarded as largely Hispanic in the constitution, which has remained in the Philippines for centuries.

==Cuisine==

The cuisine in the Philippines reflects the influences of Spanish, Mexican and Asian cuisine.

They include:

*Afritada
*Albóndigas
*Arroz a la valenciana
*Arroz caldo
*Bistek
*Brazo de Mercedes

==Business==

In the business community, the Philippine Chamber of Commerce and Industry (PCCI) plays an integral role in the economic, political and social development of the nation. Historically, the chamber can be traced back as early as the 1890s with the inauguration of the Cámara de Comercio de Filipinas. This organisation was composed mainly of Spanish companies such as the Compañia General de Tabacos de Filipinas, Fábrica de Cerveza San Miguel, and Elizalde y Cía, among other Spanish, and Philippine companies.

During the first half of the 20th-century commerce, and industrial trades with other Hispanic countries declined due to the United States administration of the Philippines and the Second World War. However, the resurgence of trade between Spain and Latin American nations had risen toward the closing of the century. 1998 marked the centennial celebration of Philippine independence and opened a new opportunity for both Hispanic and Filipino businesses to reconnect their historic ties as trade partners.

<doc id="905994" wikidata="Q4460112" url="?curid=905994" title="Disappearance of Tom and Eileen Lonergan">
<text>Thomas Joseph Lonergan (born 28 December 1964) and Eileen Cassidy Lonergan (née Hains; born 3 March 1969) were a married American couple who were unintentionally abandoned in the Coral Sea off Australia&#x27;s northeast coast on 25 January 1998 during a group scuba-diving trip aboard MV &quot;Outer Edge&quot;. The boat crew did not note their absences until two days later, on 27 January. While search efforts resulted in the discovery of personal effects presumed to be those of the Lonergans, the discoveries did not lead to their rescue. Neither has been found, and both are presumed dead.

The couple&#x27;s disappearance and deaths resulted in &quot;a crisis of confidence in north Queensland&#x27;s dive industry&quot; and resulted in tighter mandatory safety regulations for diving boats in Australia. Their disappearances also served as the inspiration for the 2003 film &quot;Open Water&quot;.

==Background==
Thomas Joseph Lonergan and Eileen Hains, both graduates of Louisiana State University, were married in Jefferson, Texas on 24 June 1988.

==Disappearance==
On 25 January 1998, the Lonergans were scuba diving with a group at St. Crispin&#x27;s Reef in Australia&#x27;s Great Barrier Reef. The boat transporting the group to the dive site departed before the Lonergans returned from the water. None of the vessel&#x27;s crew or passengers noticed that the two had not returned to the boat.

At the time of the incident, the couple had recently completed a two-year tour of duty with the Peace Corps at Funafuti atoll in the small South Pacific island nation of Tuvalu and were repeating that work in Fiji.

==Investigations and trial==

The couple were not discovered to be missing until two days later, on 27 January 1998, after a bag containing their belongings was found onboard the dive boat. A massive air and sea search took place over the following three days.

In February 1998, a women&#x27;s wetsuit matching Eileen Lonergan&#x27;s size washed ashore in north Queensland. Upon examination of barnacle growth on the wetsuit, it was determined it had likely been submerged in the ocean since January. It also bore tears along the buttocks and armpit areas, presumed by examiners to have resulted from contact with coral.

Several theories regarding the couple&#x27;s disappearance were suggested. At the time, it was suggested that the Lonergans might have staged their disappearance. However, the Lonergans&#x27; bank accounts were never touched, and their insurance policies were not claimed.

Excerpts from Tom Lonergan&#x27;s diary were found and described a man who was looking for a &quot;quick and peaceful&quot; death. Eileen&#x27;s writings expressed that she had chosen to stay with Tom, no matter the outcome. However, according to Eileen&#x27;s parents and family, the diary entries were taken out of context. The family, the coroner Noel Nunan, and the Port Douglas police claim that only the pages that would validate the suicide theory were leaked to the press, whereas the majority of the diaries remain unread except by the coroner, Port Douglas police, and the Hains family.

In June 1998, six months after the disappearance, more of the couple&#x27;s diving gear was found washed ashore on a Port Douglas beach approximately from where the Lonergans were lost. Among these items were inflatable dive jackets marked with the Lonergans&#x27; names, along with their compressed air tanks and one of Eileen&#x27;s fins. Also recovered was a weathered diver&#x27;s slate (a device used for communicating underwater) that reportedly read: &quot;Monday Jan 26; 1998 08am. To anyone who can help us: We have been abandoned on A[gin]court Reef by MV Outer Edge 25 Jan 1998 3pm. Please help to rescue us before we die. Help!!!&quot;

Eileen&#x27;s father, John Hains, suspected that the couple ultimately became dehydrated and disoriented and succumbed to drowning or sharks. During the inquest, experts speculated that based on the state of the gear recovered, the couple had likely not experienced an animal attack but rather succumbed to delirium resulting from dehydration, which caused them to remove their diving outfits voluntarily. Without the buoyancy provided by their gear, experts testified the couple would have been unable to tread water for long and would have soon drowned.

The coroner dismissed suggestions that the Lonergans had died by suicide or faked their disappearance and formally charged Geoffrey Ian &quot;Jack&quot; Nairn, skipper of the dive boat, with their unlawful killing. He was later found not guilty, but his company Outer Edge Dive was fined after pleading guilty to negligence and folded. Queensland&#x27;s government also introduced stiffer regulations, including the requirement that captains and dive masters independently confirm passenger headcounts.

==Media==
The American film &quot;Open Water&quot; (2003) was inspired by the Lonergans&#x27; disappearance. The film is set in the Caribbean and involves two divers who are abandoned at sea following an incorrect headcount.

<doc id="906006" wikidata="Q3687343" url="?curid=906006" title="State Council of the Polish People's Republic">
<text>The Council of State of the [[Polish People&#x27;s Republic|Republic of Poland]] () was introduced by the Small Constitution of 1947 as an organ of executive power. The Council of State consisted of the President of the Republic of Poland as chairman, the Marshal and Vice-marshals of the Sejm, President of the Supreme Audit Office, and potential other members. The Council of State had the power to approve decrees issued by the Council of Ministers, exercise supreme control over the local national councils, approve promulgation of laws concerning the budget and military draft, declare a state of emergency and martial law, initiate legislation, and others.

Under the 1952 Constitution of the Polish People&#x27;s Republic, the office of the President of Poland was eliminated and the Council of State became a collective head of state organ. According to Article 29 of the constitution, the Council of State consisted of seventeen people: the chairman, four deputy chairmen, the secretary, and eleven other members. All were elected by the Sejm from its members during the parliament&#x27;s first session after elections. They were usually chosen from the deputies representing the Polish United Workers&#x27; Party (PZPR), although occasionally deputies from PZPR&#x27;s satellite parties, United People&#x27;s Party (ZSL) and Alliance of Democrats (SD) were elected. In practice, the council (and the Polish state) was often represented by its chairman, who may have been referred to as the president of Poland by foreign representatives. The council ratified or renounced international agreements, appointed and recalled representatives of Poland to other states and to international organizations; it conferred orders and had the power of pardon. Some of its other constitutional functions were:

* calling elections to the Sejm and convening its sessions,
* issuing decrees during periods between Sejm sessions (the decrees had to be later accepted by the Sejm),
* initiating legislation,
* determining binding interpretations of Sejm statues.

When the Sejm was not in session (in practice, for most of the year), the Council of State had the power to issue decrees that had the force of law. These decrees had to be approved by the Sejm at its next session. Due to the principles of democratic centralism, however, such approvals were usually a mere formality.

The Council of State institution was eliminated on 19 July 1989 by a constitutional amendment. Some of its functions were transferred to the reestablished office of the President of Poland.

<text>The Kennebecasis Valley, also known as simply Kennebecasis ( ), its abbreviated term 
KV, as well as &quot;The Valley,&quot; is a valley region in the Canadian province of New Brunswick. It encompasses the suburban towns of Quispamsis and Rothesay, both situated along the lower Kennebecasis River. The Kennebecasis Valley also encompassed the former villages that were amalgamated by Quispamsis and Rothesay.

The Kennebecasis Valley has its own regional police force and fire department, the Kennebecasis Valley Fire Department, which has two stations, one in each town. Both of these departments overlook both Quispamsis and Rothesay. The Kennebecasis Valley is known for its large deer population, with the area having its own Nuisance Deer Management Assistance Program.

== History ==
Although there is no recollection of how the Kennebecasis Valley began, there is the existence of the Kennebecasis Valley Women&#x27;s Institute which stretches as far back as 1917. In 1972, the Kennebecasis Valley was described as encompassing six communities, those being Rothesay, Quispamsis, Renforth, Gondola Point, Fairvale, and East Riverside-Kinghurst. Following the January 1, 1998 amalgamations of the former communities into either Quispamsis or Rothesay, the communities encompassed by the Kennebecasis Valley lowered to two.

== Education ==
The Kennebecasis Valley has two high schools: Rothesay High School for Rothesay, and Kennebecasis Valley High School for Quispamsis. At one point, Kennebecasis Valley High School served the entire Kennebecasis Valley as well as the nearby town of Hampton prior to the openings of Hampton High School (1992) and Rothesay High School (1998).

== Events ==
In 1997, the first annual Kennebecasis Valley Summer Festival was held by establishments along the Old Hampton Road in Quispamsis and former village of Fairvale.

The Kennebecasis Valley has its own Santa Claus parade hosted annually by both towns. The KV Santa Claus Parade is held in late November, starting at the Kennebecasis Valley High School and stretching about down Hampton Road.

<text>Im Dong-hyun (; ; born 12 May 1986) is a South Korean archer. He competes for the South Korean national team and is a former world number one. He has 20/200 vision in his left eye and 20/100 vision in his right eye, meaning he needs to be 10 times closer to see objects clearly with his left eye, compared to someone with perfect vision.

==Career==
===2004 Summer Olympics===
At the 2004 Summer Olympics, Im set a world record in the 72 arrow men&#x27;s individual ranking round, with a score of 687 (it was not recognized by the International Olympic Committee as an Olympic record, however, as the ranking round took place on 12 August, before the 2004 opening ceremony). He then won his first three elimination matches, advancing to the quarterfinals. In the quarterfinals, Im faced Hiroshi Yamamoto of Japan, losing to the eventual silver medalist 111–110 in the 12-arrow match. Im was placed 6th overall.

Im was also a member of Korea&#x27;s gold medal men&#x27;s archery team at the 2004 Summer Olympics.

===2006 Asian Games===
In 2006, he competed at the 2006 Asian Games and won two gold medals in the individual and South Korean team.

===2008 Summer Olympics===
At the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, Im finished his ranking round with a total of 670 points, nine points behind leader Juan René Serrano. This made him the eighth seed for the final competition bracket in which he faced Ali Salem in the first round, beating the Qatari 108–103. In the second round Im was too strong for Butch Johnson (115–106), but in the third round another American, Vic Wunderle, eliminated him with 113–111.

Together with Lee Chang-hwan and Park Kyung-mo, he also took part in the team event. With his 670 score from the ranking round combined with the 676 of Park and the 669 of Lee the Koreans were in first position after the ranking round, which gave them a straight seeding into the quarter-finals. With a score of 224–222 they were too strong for the Polish team and in the semi-final they beat home nation China 221–218. In the final Italy came close, but South Korea took the title with 227–225.

===2012 Summer Olympics===
On 27 July 2012 at the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, he set a new world record score of 699 in the ranking round at Lord&#x27;s Cricket Ground, beating his compatriot Kim Bub-min by one point. Although he was the top seed after the ranking round, he was eliminated in the round of 16, losing 7–1 to Rick van der Ven. Im did win a bronze medal with the South Korean team.

<text>Meredith Douglas Young, (born September 20, 1940 in Tracadie, New Brunswick) is a Canadian politician both provincial and federal spanning two decades.

==Provincial politics==
He was first elected to the Legislative Assembly of New Brunswick in 1978 as a Liberal Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA). He was elected leader of the New Brunswick Liberal Party in 1982, but resigned within a year of his rising to that post due to a poor showing in the 1982 provincial election. When the Liberals formed a government under Frank McKenna in 1987, Young served as Minister of Fisheries.

==Federal politics==
Young left provincial politics to run in the 1988 federal election for the Liberal Party of Canada, and was elected to the House of Commons of Canada as a Liberal Member of Parliament (MP).

With the election of a Liberal government in the 1993 election, the new Prime Minister, Jean Chrétien, appointed Young to the Canadian cabinet as Minister of Transport. In that position, Young privatized Canada&#x27;s air navigation system, creating Nav Canada, eliminated the Crow Rate which regulated the cost western farmers had to pay to transport their goods via rail, and privatized the Canadian National Railway.

In January 1996, he became Minister of Employment and Immigration (subsequently retitled Minister of Human Resources Development) and Minister of Labour. In October 1996, he was appointed Minister of National Defence and Minister of Veterans Affairs.

As Defence Minister, Young generated much criticism when, in 1997, he suspended the formal inquiry into the Somalia Affair in which Canadian troops had been accused of mistreating prisoners in Somalia in 1993.

In one of the chief upsets of the 1997 election, Young was defeated in his riding by Yvon Godin of the New Democratic Party. The Liberal government&#x27;s changes to Unemployment Insurance were a key factor in his defeat because of the large number of seasonal workers in Young&#x27;s riding. This was also a factor in the defeat of Young&#x27;s Cabinet colleague and fellow Maritimer David Dingwall.

Since his defeat, Young has worked in Ottawa as a lobbyist. Despite his Liberal affiliations, Young supported the candidacy of Tom Long to lead the right-wing Canadian Alliance in that party&#x27;s leadership election in 2000.

He supported Stéphane Dion for the leadership of the Liberal Party.

<text>António Branco (born 1957), is a famous Portuguese clown who performs as Batatinha (meaning &quot;small potato&quot;).

In the early years of his career, Batatinha worked with another famous Portuguese clown named Palhaço Croquete. Since their separation, he has worked with Companhia.

Batatinha had a show with Companhia on Portuguese national television (RTP) called &quot;Vamos ao Circo&quot;. Shortly after they had a daily show called &quot;Batatoon&quot; on the Portuguese television station TVI that lasted from 1998 until 2002, when Batatinha and his colleague Companhia had a public spat live on TV (though they refuse to admit that physical aggressions were exchanged). In 2003, Batatinha and Companhia parted ways and since then Batatinha has performed solo.

In January 2011, the pair was reunited on TV and solved their differences and united once again as the popular clown duo.
In 2011, Batatinha participated on the RTP television show Último a Sair, a spoof of reality-TV shows in character as the clown.

<doc id="906044" wikidata="Q81672" url="?curid=906044" title="Attempted murder">
<text>Attempted murder is a crime of attempt in various jurisdictions.

==Canada==
Section 239 of the &quot;Criminal Code&quot; makes attempted murder punishable by a maximum of life imprisonment. If a gun is used, the minimum sentence is four, five or seven years, dependent on prior convictions and relation to organized crime.

==United Kingdom==
===England and Wales===
In English criminal law, attempted murder is the crime of simultaneously preparing to commit an unlawful killing and having a specific intention to cause the death of a human being under the King&#x27;s Peace. The phrase &quot;more than merely preparatory&quot; is specified by the Criminal Attempts Act 1981 to denote the fact that preparation for a crime by itself does not constitute an &quot;attempted crime&quot;.

In England and Wales, as an &quot;attempt&quot;, attempted murder is an offence under section 1(1) of the Criminal Attempts Act 1981 and is an indictable offence which carries a maximum penalty of life imprisonment (the same as the mandatory sentence for murder). The corresponding legislation for Northern Ireland is section 3(1) of the Criminal Attempts and Conspiracy (Northern Ireland) Order 1983 (No.1120 (N.I.13)).

The &quot;mens rea&quot; (&quot;Latin&quot; for the &quot;guilty mind&quot;) for murder is an intention to kill or cause grievous bodily harm, whereas attempted murder depends on an intention to kill and an overt act towards committing homicide. Attempted murder is only the planning of a murder and acts taken towards it, not the actual killing, which is the murder. This makes the offence very difficult to prove and it is more common for a lesser charge to be preferred under the Offences against the Person Act 1861.

However, in &quot;R v Morrison&quot; [2003] 1 WLR 1859, the Court of Appeal considered the issue of alternative verdicts on an indictment with a single count of attempted murder. Morrison had gone into a shop with two other men on a robbery with a firearm. They demanded money and one of the men shot at the shopkeeper who suffered only minor injury. The prosecution had many opportunities to add other counts before the trial but failed to act. Having heard the case, the judge expressed his view that the jury could consider an attempted grievous bodily harm (GBH) under section 18 of the 1861 Act and Morrison was duly convicted of attempting to cause grievous bodily harm. The Court of Appeal confirmed that attempting to cause grievous bodily harm is a valid alternative to attempted murder because there can be no intention to kill someone without the intention also to cause grievous bodily harm.

This is a practical decision to ensure that the criminal justice system did not allow a guilty person to walk away because only one charge had been preferred. But it is not necessarily a good general principle because, in euthanasia for example, a person assisting intends to cause death, but with no suffering. That attempting to cause grievous bodily harm must be an alternative verdict should the intended victim not die would be a strange outcome because there is no intention to cause any long-lasting and serious injury: the two attempted offences have different &quot;mens rea&quot; requirements so that proof of intent to murder would not necessarily meet the requirement for section 18 of the 1861 Act.

First, acting deliberately and intentionally or recklessly with extreme disregard for human life, the person attempted to kill someone; and the person did something that was a substantial step toward committing the crime. Mere preparation is not considered a substantial step toward committing a crime.

====Proof of &quot;mens rea&quot;====

There must be more than merely preparatory acts and, although the defendant may threaten death, this may not provide convincing evidence of an intention to kill unless the words are accompanied by relevant action, e.g. finding and picking up a weapon and making serious use of it, or making a serious and sustained physical attack without a weapon.

====Duress, necessity and marital coercion====
The defences of duress and necessity are not available to a person charged with attempted murder. Conversely, the statutory defence of marital coercion is, on the face of the statute, available to a wife charged with attempted murder.

====History====
Prior to 1967, sections 11 to 15 of the Offences against the Person Act 1861 created a number of offences of attempting to commit murder by various specified means (ss.11 to 14), and an offence of attempting to commit murder by any means not specified in those offences (s.15).

After the repeal of these offences by the Criminal Law Act 1967, attempted murder was allowed to subsist at common law until the enactment of the 1981 Act.

===Scotland===
Attempted murder is a crime at common law in Scotland. Attempted murder is the same as the offence of murder in Scots law with the only difference being that the victim has not died. The offence of murder was defined in &quot;Drury v HM Advocate&quot;:

Intention can be inferred from the circumstances of the case. Wicked recklessness is determined objectively and is &quot;recklessness so gross that it indicates a state of mind which falls to be treated as wicked and depraved as the state of mind of a deliberate killer.&quot; As with all common law offences in Scotland, the maximum punishment available is life imprisonment.

<doc id="906046" wikidata="Q2264148" url="?curid=906046" title="Jehane Noujaim">
<text>Jehane Noujaim (, ) (born May 17, 1974) is an American documentary film director best known for her films &quot;Control Room&quot;, &quot;Startup.com&quot;, &quot;Pangea Day&quot; and &quot;The Square.&quot; She has co-directed &quot;The Great Hack&quot; and &quot;The Vow&quot; with Karim Amer.

== Background ==
Noujaim was born to a Lebanese father and an American mother who was born in Connecticut. She was raised in Kuwait and Cairo and moved to Boston by the age of 10, in 1984. She attended Milton Academy.

In 1992, Noujaim matriculated to Harvard University, where she initially intended to study medicine. She later switched to visual arts and philosophy after taking an interest in photography and filmmaking, graduating magna cum laude in 1996.

==Career==

=== 2000-2005 ===
While studying at Harvard University, Noujaim worked alongside her fellow peers towards developing &quot;Blue Hill Avenue&quot;, about the operations of gangs in Roxbury, Boston. Also during the duration of her degree, Noujaim notably worked under mentor Robb Moss.

In 2002, before her graduation, Noujaim was awarded the Gardiner fellowship under which she directed &quot;Mokattam&quot;, an Arabic film about a garbage-collecting village near Cairo in Egypt.

Noujaim joined the MTV news and documentary division as a segment producer for the documentary series &quot;UNfiltered&quot;.

In 2001, she left to produce and direct &quot;Startup.com&quot; under the guidance of documentary filmmaker D.A. Pennebaker in association with Pennebaker Hegedus Films. The feature-length documentary won the DGA and IDA Awards for best documentary. From collaboration with D.A. Pennebaker and Hegedus throughout her career, Noujaim&#x27;s filmmaking techniques take insight from cinéma verité. Noujaim was awarded the Jacqueline Donnet Emerging Documentary Filmmaker Award in 2004.

She has since worked in both the Middle East and the United States as a cinematographer on various documentaries including &quot;Born Rich,&quot; &quot;Only the Strong Survive,&quot; and &quot;Down from the Mountain.&quot;

In 2004, she directed the feature-length film &quot;Control Room&quot;, a documentary about US Central Command and its relations with Al Jazeera and other news organizations that covered the 2003 invasion of Iraq. The film showed the unfolding of war through the descriptions and contributions of entities in media outlets. It also displayed information on the impact of skewed information during the Iraq war from different media source&#x27;s operations and public motives. Noujaim achieves this through live footage from her time in Qatar of the war as well as interviews from news room correspondents.

Through this project, Noujaim wanted to portray images of war and question how viewers perceive them. The mentioned creative approach led her to focus her filmmaking on viewer&#x27;s bias grounded in individual characteristics such as cultural background. In a review for &quot;Control Room&quot; Bill Stamets felt that throughout this creative path, Noujaim who filmed the majority of &quot;Control Room&quot; herself, never poses her own opinion on the topic in the film&#x27;s story or give insight on her personal perception of war. The neutral stream for the film gives little guidance to viewers, prioritizing their interpretation, an artistic choice on behalf of Noujaim. Box office records were broken by &quot;Control Room&quot; while being screened at Film Forum in New York.

=== 2006-2011 ===

In 2006, Noujaim won the TED Prize for her work in &quot;Control Room&quot;. This made her the first and youngest woman to do so. She also received a nomination for the Writers Guild of America Award for Best Documentary Screenplay, sharing the nomination with co-writer Julia Bacha. In 2007, she co-directed (with Sherief El Katsha) the film &quot;Shayfeen.com&quot; which was broadcast as part of the WhyDemocracy project. In 2012 she released &quot;&quot; (which she directed with Mona Eldaeif). A documentary about a group of women leaving their villages to learn about solar engineering, only to return and solar power their own society.
=== 2012-2017 ===

In 2013, she released &quot;The Square,&quot; a film following the Egyptian revolution and the inspiration it has given to the world. While the film was being shot, Noujaim went missing, being found after an activist brought attention to her disappearance. Also during the duration of filming, Noujaim was arrested on three occasions. The arrests came as a result of accusations Noujaim was a spy, traitor, and for her general participation in protests while in Egypt. During the film&#x27;s release period, the piece was withheld from viewers in Egypt due to censorship regulations. In an act to ensure Egyptian citizens saw the film, Noujaim released the film online in addition to the film being pirated in the country. Noujaim claimed this decision was made in strides towards freedom of speech as a filmmaker.

&quot;The Square&quot; was nominated for an Academy Award in best documentary in January 2014 and is highlighted as the first Egyptian film to earn such credentials. &quot;The Square&quot; also won critical acclaim in the 2013 Sundance Film Festival &amp; the 2013 Toronto International Film Festival. She won the DGA Award for &quot;The Square&quot; in 2014.

Noujaim contributed to a book in 2016 which included a collection of statements by individuals on their experiences travelling to or visiting global squares. In the text, Noujaim disclosed her experiences and time spent in January 2011 at Tahrir Square. The given location in Cairo is commonly the site of chaos and protests which she expanded on.

===2017-present===
In 2019, Noujaim and Amer directed &quot;The Great Hack&quot;, a documentary film which revolved around the Facebook–Cambridge Analytica data scandal. It had its world premiere at the Sundance Film Festival on January 26, 2019. It was released on July 24, 2019, by Netflix. Initially, Noujaim and Amer meant out to make a documentary revolving around the Sony Pictures hack, however the film evolved and shifted course as they started looking at how people&#x27;s minds have been hacked and changed.

Noujaim and Amer directed &quot;The Vow&quot; a documentary series revolving around NXIVM and its leader Keith Raniere, which premiered in August 2020 on HBO. The second and final season premiered in October 2022, with Noujaim primarily directing without Amer. Noujaim previously took a NXIVM course after being recruited by Sara Bronfman.

In 2022, Noujaim served as an executive producer on &quot;Flight/Risk&quot; directed by Amer and Omar Mullick for Amazon Studios. In 2023, Noujaim served as an executive producer on &quot;Defiant&quot; directed by Amer, focusing on diplomacy and disinformation in the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Noujaim is directing and executive producing alongside Vikram Gandhi, &quot;The Man Will Burn&quot;, a documentary series revolving around Burning Man.

== Pangea Day ==

After winning the TED Prize, Noujaim used her wish to organize Pangea Day, a live videoconference that took place in New York City, Rio de Janeiro, London, Dharamsala, Cairo, Jerusalem, and Kigali on May 10, 2008. The show was internationally broadcast over four hours through internet, television and mobile phones. It featured films, speakers, and music. The purpose of the event was to screen the work of filmmakers who created pieces around cultural reflection that posed conversation starters among the audience to unite people globally through film.

<text>Rádio e Televisão de Portugal (RTP) is the public service broadcasting organisation of Portugal. It operates four national television channels and three national radio stations, as well as several satellite and cable offerings.

The current company dates from 2007, with the merger of two previously separate companies Radiodifusão Portuguesa (RDP; the radio broadcaster) and Radiotelevisão Portuguesa (television broadcaster), although they had been grouped under a single holding company and common branding since 2004.

RTP is funded by a broadcasting contribution tax which is incorporated in electricity bills, and by advertising revenues.

==History==
===Radio===
The Emissora Nacional de Radiodifusão, usually referred to by its abbreviated designation Emissora Nacional (EN), was established on 4 August 1935 as the public national radio broadcaster, inheriting the previous broadcasting operations of the Portuguese postal service (CTT). Five years later, EN became independent of the CTT.

Emissora Nacional was one of the 23 founding broadcasting organisations of the European Broadcasting Union in 1950. Following the Carnation Revolution, EN was reorganised and in 1976 changed its name to Radiodifusão Portuguesa (RDP). During this process, several previously private radio stations – such as Rádio Clube Português (RCP) – were nationalised and integrated into RDP.

In 1979, the RCP network was rebranded as Rádio Comercial, and was later privatised in 1993. At the same time, RDP launched the youth-oriented radio station Antena 3 and abolished advertising from all of its stations, so that the aforementioned broadcasting contribution tax became its sole source of funding.

===Television===

In 1953, a group on behalf of Emissora Nacional de Radiodifusão (later RDP) was set up examining the feasibility of a television service in Portugal. The group started a preliminary work for a network of television signals, with a budget on the order of 500,000 escudos. A foreign company had a proposal for the setup of the television network, including the possibility by a foreign company, with high foreign capital, tasking up a proposal for the building of the network and having the exclusive rights of the selling of television sets in the country for a determined period of time. In July 1954, their report A Televisão em Portugal (Television in Portugal) was published and was built upon the following pillars:

# The current status of TV and the opportunity for its introduction in Portugal
# The operating system to be adopted
# The solution that seems possible
# Outline of an initial plan and related charges
# Economic study
# List of work already carried out by ENR.

Without suspending the activity of the Television Studies Group (while entering a new phase of activity, evolving naturally on the data set gathered), it was nevertheless necessary to wait 6 months for a decisive impulse given to the preliminary work for the installation of the national TV network: a Commission, appointed by Order, was responsible for coordinating and commenting on the studies carried out or to be carried out and defining the scenario in which future broadcasts should take place. This Commission was made up of:

* Brigadier Luís de Pina (former military attaché to the embassies in Washington and London), who presided over it
* António Eça de Queirós
* Engineer Manuel Bivar
* Dr. Stichini Vilela, for Emissora Nacional
* Major Jorge Botelho Moniz, for the private radio stations
* Engineer Carlos Ribeiro
* Dr. Fernando Elói, for the General Administration of Posts, Telegraphs and Telephones

Radiotelevisão Portuguesa (RTP) was established on 15 December 1955 as the national television service, under Article 1 of Decree nº 40 341, as a government limited liability company, under the name of RTP - Radiotelevisão Portuguesa, SARL, with the minimum capital provided for by law, in the amount of 60 million escudos, divided into thirds that fell to the State, the private broadcasters and to the public - this part to be subscribed in shares of 1 000 escudos, for which several banking institutions immediately became responsible.

The following radio stations had shares in RTP (values in thousands of escudos):

* Rádio Clube Português: 9,260
* Rádio Renascença: 4,630
* Emissores do Norte Reunidos: 2,310
* Rádio Clube de Moçambique: 2,310
* Emissores Associados de Lisboa: 1,400
* Rádio Ribatejo: 30
* Rádio Pólo Norte: 30
* Posto Emissor de Radiodifusão do Funchal: 20
* Rádio Clube de Angra: 20

Experimental broadcasts began on 4 September 1956 from the &quot;Feira Popular&quot; (an entertainment park) experimental studios in Lisbon. Twenty monitors were installed in the park, but crowds gathered in shops around the city. The broadcast was received within a range of about 20 km. Around 1,000 TV sets are sold within a month. The first broadcast was made in association with the &quot;O Século&quot; newspaper. Intense work was done in the two weeks leading up to the first experimental broadcast.

On December 5, 1956, a contract was signed for the installation of the five transmitters to be built in the first phase of the national television network (dates implied are date of first operation):

* Monsanto (December 3, 1956)
* Monte da Virgem (December 31, 1957)
* Lousã (November 23, 1957)
* Monchique (April 25, 1958)
* Montejunto (March 10, 1958)

RTP&#x27;s first yearly report (in 1956) stated that there were difficulties in receiving the terrain to install the television transmitters, a goal RTP wanted to achieve by March 1957.

Regular broadcasting, however, did not start until 7 March 1957, by which time coverage had reached approximately 65% of the Portuguese population. By the end of 1958 the total number of sets in Portugal was around 32,000.

RTP was accepted as a full active member of the EBU in 1959.

By the mid-1960s, RTP had become available throughout the country. Robert Farnon&#x27;s &quot;Derby Day&quot; was extensively used as RTP&#x27;s fanfare to open the programming since the very first day, and over the decades it has become RTP&#x27;s official anthem.

A second television channel, RTP2, began operation on 25 December 1968. Two new regional channels were created in 1972 and 1975, for the Portuguese archipelagos of Madeira (opening on 6 August 1972) and the Azores (10 August 1975).

Before the Carnation Revolution, RTP was essentially a mouthpiece of the regime, and famously opened the newscast of 20 July 1969 – the day of the first Moon landing – with a segment showing president Américo Thomaz opening a concrete factory. However, like many other broadcasters, it did broadcast live the landing of the man on the Moon during the night.

The first colour broadcast was made in 1975, with the live coverage of the first parliamentary elections after Carnation Revolution. However, due to the political turmoil and the economic situation of the country, the colour regular broadcast was delayed several times for nearly 5 years. During that time, RTP started to purchase some colour equipment and make the occasional colour recording. But the pressure kept going as the black and white equipment was getting old and very hard to repair, so in 1978 and 1979, a massive investment into colour broadcasts, supported by a foreign loan, gave RTP the opportunity to replace all the B/W to increase the current amount of equipment and to be updated with the most advanced broadcast technologies available at the time. Despite this, only in February 1980, the government finally authorised the regular colour broadcast and two weeks after, on 7 March, RTP started the regular colour broadcast, with more than 70% of the programmes being already in colour. Also, RTP moved its headquarters to a brand new building. The building was originally built to be converted to a hotel, but the owner decided to leave it untouched and reached an agreement with RTP for the purchase and converted the interior for office use. RTP moved to more adequate headquarters and sold the building in 2003 and the new owner converted into what is today the VIP Grand Lisboa.

The introduction of private television caused great concern within RTP, as it was believed that by losing the monopoly, the corporation was going to lose ad revenue. Numerous female presenters (Maria Elisa, Margarida Marante and Maria Antónia Palla) were fired and caused huge repercussions in the media industry.

Until 1991, RTP owned its transmitter network, which was transferred to a state-owned enterprise which, through a series of mergers, became part of Portugal Telecom. RTP held the television monopoly until 1992, the year when the private SIC (backed by Impresa, TSF, Rádio Comercial, Lusomundo, Expresso, Impala Editores, and the largest commercial TV network in Latin America TV Globo) started broadcasting. Over the years, RTP&#x27;s audience share has constantly reduced in favour of the private channels. 2007 was an exception to this tendency, and RTP1 became the second most watched channel in Portugal, only behind TVI, a rarity which occurred again in 2009 and 2010.

In 2004, RTP and RDP were organized under a new company and became part of a larger state-owned holding, named Rádio e Televisão de Portugal, SGPS, and inaugurated the new headquarters near Parque das Nações, in Lisbon. In the same year, the second channel was rebranded as &#x27;2:&#x27;, promoting itself as the civil society service. Later in March 2007, 2: became &#x27;RTP2&#x27; again. In February 2007 Radiotelevisão Portuguesa SA (the former RTP) and Radiodifusão Portuguesa SA (RDP) were merged into the new Radio e Televisão de Portugal SA, ceasing to be independent entities.

Due to the financial crisis Portugal faced, RTP was to be heavily restructured as part of the Portuguese government&#x27;s austerity plan between 2011 and 2015 and would have included the sale of one of the free to air channel licenses. However, due to pressure from the public and other organisations, the planned channel privatization never came into effect, although some restructuring took place, namely the phasing out of the international shortwave radio channels.

RTP has 16 regional offices spread all over the country, as well as international bureaus in Washington D.C., Brussels, Moscow, Brazil and several other locations.

RTP aired the 2008 Olympic Games in HD through the ZON TV Cabo satellite and cable platform. On 30 September 2009, RTP 1 HD returned in an experimental broadcast.

Following Salvador Sobral&#x27;s win in the Eurovision Song Contest 2017, RTP took on hosting duties for the 2018 contest.

===Post-merger===
The use of original full names of the radio and television departments (Radiodifusão Portuguesa and Radiotelevisão Portuguesa, respectively) was phased out. The acronym RTP (previously used by the television department) was kept to designate both the whole organization resulting from the merger, as well as to continue to designate its several TV channels. The acronym RDP (previously used by the radio department) was kept to be used by the international radio services (RDP Internacional and RDP África) and by the regional radio centers (RDP Norte, RDP Centro, RDP Lisboa, RDP Sul, RDP Açores and RDP Madeira).

<text>The Canadian Mathematical Society (CMS; ) is an association of professional mathematicians dedicated to the interests of mathematical research, outreach, scholarship and education in Canada. It serves the national community through the publication of academic journals, community bulletins, and the administration of mathematical competitions.

It was originally conceived in June 1945 as the Canadian Mathematical Congress. A name change was debated for many years; ultimately, a new name was adopted in 1979, upon its incorporation as a non-profit charitable organization.

The society is also affiliated with various national and international mathematical societies, including the Canadian Applied and Industrial Mathematics Society and the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics. The society is also a member of the International Mathematical Union and the International Council for Industrial and Applied Mathematics.

==History==
The Canadian Mathematical Society (CMS) was originally conceived in June 1945 as the Canadian Mathematical Congress. The founding members hoped that &quot;this congress [would] be the beginning of important mathematical development in Canada&quot;. Seeking to end confusion with the quadrennial mathematical congresses, a name change was considered for many years. Finally, upon its incorporation as a non-profit, charitable organization in 1978, a new name was adopted – the Canadian Mathematical Society.

Since then, the society has expanded its activities to serve K-12 and post secondary students, as well as professors and established researchers. Graham P. Wright served as executive director of the CMS from 1979 to 2009, and helped to build up the society&#x27;s executive office in Ottawa and to develop its web-based electronic services.

The Canadian Mathematical Society was to celebrate its 75th anniversary during its 2020 Summer Meeting in Ottawa, Ontario. However, due to COVID-19 pandemic, the meeting was postponed to 2021 Summer Meeting.

==Publications==
The flagship publications of the CMS are the prominent, peer-reviewed research journals &quot;Canadian Journal of Mathematics&quot;, which is intended for full research papers, and the &quot;Canadian Mathematical Bulletin&quot;, which publishes shorter papers. All past issues except the last five volumes are free to download. Access to the most recent research requires a subscription.

In cooperation with Springer Publications, the CMS publishes many text books aimed at a university and academic researcher level. The series is called &quot;CMS Books in Mathematics&quot;.

The CMS publishes ten issues per year of &quot;Crux Mathematicorum&quot;, which contains problem-solving challenges and techniques suitable for training in secondary school problem solving competitions such as the Canadian Mathematical Olympiad or the International Mathematical Olympiad. All past issues except the last five volumes are free to download and use. The CMS also publishes &quot;A Taste of Mathematics&quot; (ATOM), a series of small booklets on a variety of topics suitable for high school enrichment.

The &quot;CMS Notes&quot; is the Society&#x27;s official newsletter, published six times per year and available to members or the public online. It includes news relevant to the Canadian mathematical community, including notice on conferences, columns on research and education, book reviews, award announcements, and employment advertisements for mathematicians.

==Activities==
===Student Committee===
The Canadian Mathematical Society&#x27;s Student Committee (Studc) was formed in 1999. Studc aims to bring together French and English Canadian graduate and undergraduate mathematics students through research and networking events and publication opportunities. Studc manages and publishes &quot;Notes from the Margin&quot;, a magazine-style publication devoted to publishing accessible research-based content in addition to opinion pieces, news articles, open problems that are of interest to the mathematical community, and brainteaser puzzles.

===Conferences===
====CMS Meetings====
CMS organizes two bilingual Meetings each year: the CMS Winter Meeting is normally held during the first weekend of December and the CMS Summer Meeting during the first weekend of June. Each Meeting takes place over the course of 3 days, with 2 days of pre-meeting activities. This includes the executive meeting, board of directors meeting, group development luncheon and mini-courses.

CMS Meetings are among the biggest mathematical events in Canada, bringing together over 800 of the most respected researchers, educators, post-doctorates and students in mathematics and related fields from around the world. The includes many scientific sessions and plenary, prize and public lectures.

====Canadian Undergraduate Mathematics Conference====
Through its Student Committee, the CMS is the main sponsor for the bilingual Canadian Undergraduate Mathematics Conference, an annual research and networking conference held each summer and targeted at Canadian undergraduates interested in any area of pure or applied mathematics. It is entirely student-run and driven by Studc. Delegates may opt to present a poster or paper, as well as a short talk on a topic of their choosing. The location of the conference is alternated between central Canada (defined as Ontario and Quebec) and Western or Eastern Canada every other year, with host applications being submitted by hopefuls a year in advance.

====CWiMAC====
The Women in Mathematics committee of the CMS also runs Connecting Women in Mathematics Across Canada (CWiMAC), a workshop and conference aimed at upcoming Canadian female mathematicians. In particular, they target current PhD students and new postdoctoral fellows seeking guidance in their field. The conference strives to strengthen the community between young female mathematicians and their senior counterparts through the building of mentorship, relationships, and networking.

===Competitions===
The CMS administers the Canadian Open Mathematics Challenge, a problem solving competition targeted at Canadian high school students, which is modelled after the analogous William Lowell Putnam Mathematical Competition for undergraduates. High-scoring students may be invited to compete in the Canadian Mathematical Olympiad, a problem-solving and mathematics competition run by the CMS which is also used as a screening process for the selection of the Canadian team for the International Mathematical Olympiad.

===Outreach===
CMS runs several annual summer math camps across Canada to foster interest and excitement in elementary-school and secondary-school aged students. Some CMS math camps, are based on invitation and are targeted at high-potential students from all backgrounds, and others are open to all students with interest in mathematics. The CMS also runs several smaller specialty camps targeted at visible minorities and under-represented groups in the mathematical community.

Many member organizations also run outreach events to attract local talent to mathematics, such as Math Challenge programs held at the local university, Math Enrichment Centres, and educational events throughout the academic year.

==Awards==
The CMS annually awards the following prizes:
*Jeffery–Williams Prize to recognize mathematicians who have made outstanding contributions to mathematical research. 
*Adrien Pouliot Award for contributions to mathematical education in Canada.
*David Borwein Distinguished Career Award to recognize individuals who have made exceptional, broad, and continued contributions to Canadian mathematics.

<text>The Douglas B-23 Dragon is an American twin-engined bomber developed by the Douglas Aircraft Company as a successor to the B-18 Bolo.

==Design and development==
Douglas proposed a number of modifications designed to improve the performance of the B-18. Initially considered a redesign, the XB-22 featured 1,600 hp Wright R-2600-1 Twin Cyclone radial engines. The complete B-18 redesign was considered promising enough by the USAAC to alter the original contract to produce the last 38 B-18As ordered under Contract AC9977 as the B-23. The design incorporated a larger wingspan with a wing design very similar to that of the DC-3, a fully retractable undercarriage, and improved defensive armament. The B-23 was the first operational American bomber equipped with a glazed tail gun position. The tail gun was a .50 calibre (12.7 mm) machine gun, which was fired from the prone position by a gunner using a telescopic sight.

The first B-23 flew on July 27, 1939 with the production series of 38 B-23s manufactured between July 1939 and September 1940.

==Operational history==
While significantly faster and better armed than the B-18, the B-23 was not comparable to newer medium bombers like the North American B-25 Mitchell and Martin B-26 Marauder. For this reason, the 38 B-23s built were never used in combat overseas, although for a brief period they were employed as patrol aircraft stationed on the west coast of the United States. The B-23s were primarily relegated to training duties, although 18 of them were later converted as transports and redesignated UC-67.

The B-23 also served as a testbed for new engines and systems. For example, one was used for turbosupercharger development by General Electric at Schenectady, New York. Another was used for testing cabin pressurization.

After World War II, many examples were used as executive transports, with appropriate internal modifications, and as a result a large number have survived, both in public and private collections. Howard Hughes (among others) used converted B-23s as personal aircraft.

<doc id="906070" wikidata="Q4122577" url="?curid=906070" title="Anti-Rent War">
<text>The Anti-Rent War (also known as the Helderberg War) was a tenants&#x27; revolt in upstate New York between 1839 and 1845. The Anti-Renters declared their independence from the manor system run by patroons, resisting tax collectors and successfully demanding land reform. The conflict resulted in the passage of laws that made feudal tenures illegal and outlawed leases greater than 12 years.

==Events==
The incident began with the death of Stephen Van Rensselaer III in 1839. Van Rensselaer, who was described as a &quot;lenient and benevolent landowner&quot; was the patroon of the region at the time. As a way to develop his vast landholdings, Van Rensselaer granted tenants lifetime leases at moderate prices. 

During his life, when tenants were in financial constraints, he preferred to accept rent in the form of goods and services in lieu of cash, allow rents to accumulate, or accept partial payment rather than evict them. However, his leases also included a &quot;quarter-sale&quot; provision, which required tenants who sold their leases to pay Van Rensselaer one fourth of the sale price or one additional year&#x27;s rent. The patroons owned all the land on which the tenants in the Hudson Valley lived, and used this feudal lease system to maintain control of the region.

When he died, his wealth had been reduced in the economic downturn known as the Panic of 1837, so Van Rensselaer&#x27;s will directed his heirs to collect outstanding rents and quarter-sale payments to apply to his estate&#x27;s debts. When the heirs attempted to collect, tenants who believed their debts would be forgiven at Van Renselaer&#x27;s death could not pay the amounts demanded, could not secure a favorable payment schedule from the heirs, and could not obtain relief in the courts, so they revolted.

The first mass meeting of tenant farmers leading to the Anti-Rent War was held at the top of the Helderberg mountains in Berne, New York on July 4, 1839. They issued a declaration of independence, promising: &quot;We will take up the ball of the Revolution where our fathers stopped it and roll it to the final consummation of freedom and independence of the masses.&quot; Among their tactics was the rent strike, with tenants refusing to pay on their leases unless Van Rensselaer&#x27;s heirs and the other patroons agreed to a negotiated settlement.

In December 1839 the Anti-Renters repulsed a 500-man posse led by Albany County sheriff Michael Artcher and including William Marcy and John Van Buren. Governor William Seward threatened the rebels with 700 militiamen and obtained their surrender. However, an insurrection continued to smolder. Disguised &quot;Calico Indians&quot; resisted eviction, tax collection, and law enforcement, sometimes tarring and feathering their enemies.

The conflict gained the support of somewhere between 25,000 and 60,000 of the approximately 300,000 tenants in the patroon system. In January 1845, one hundred and fifty delegates from eleven counties assembled at St. Paul&#x27;s Lutheran Church in Berne to call for political action to redress their grievances.

==Results==
The Anti-Rent War led to the creation of the Antirenter Party, which had a strong influence on New York State politics from 1846 to 1851. Newly elected governor Silas Wright moved in 1845 to stamp out the Calico Indians, and pushed for a law which outlawed disguises.

Trials of leaders of the revolt, charged with riot, conspiracy and robbery, were held in 1845 with Amasa J. Parker presiding. Attorneys included Ambrose L. Jordan, as leading counsel for the defense, and John Van Buren, the state attorney general, who personally conducted the prosecution. At the first trial, the jury came to no conclusion and Parker declared a mistrial. During a re-trial in September 1845, the two attorneys started a fistfight in open court. Both were sentenced by the presiding judge, John W. Edmonds, to &quot;solitary confinement in the county jail for 24 hours.&quot; At the conclusion of the trial, one defendant, Smith A. Boughton, was sentenced to life imprisonment. After the election of John Young as governor with the support of the Anti-Renters, he pardoned Boughton.

John Van Steenburgh and Edward O&#x27;Connor were sentenced to death by hanging for their involvement in the shooting death of Undersheriff Osman Steele, an incident that took place on August 7, 1845 at Moses Earle&#x27;s farm in Andes, New York during a sheriff&#x27;s sale that was held after Earle was unable to pay his back rent. The day following the murder, a panel of judges met every day for a month, except on Sundays. A state of insurrection in the county was declared by the governor, and 248 people were detained in a makeshift jail. Earle and two others were sentenced to life in prison. Several others received lesser prison sentences. Governor Young later commuted the death sentences to life in prison. At least seven men including Earle were sent to Dannemora just as the prison opened in 1845.

The New York Constitution of 1846 added provisions for tenants&#x27; rights, abolishing feudal tenures and outlawing leases lasting longer than twelve years. The remaining manors dissolved quickly as the patroons sold off the lands.

<text>Startup.com is a 2001 American documentary film directed by Jehane Noujaim and Chris Hegedus. D. A. Pennebaker served as a producer on the film. It follows the dot-com start-up govWorks.com, which raised $60 million in funding from Hearst Interactive Media, KKR, the New York Investment Fund, and Sapient.

The startup did not survive, but it became a reference for lessons learned, as it was the subject of a 2001 documentary that follows govWorks founders Kaleil Isaza Tuzman and Tom Herman from 1999 to 2000, as the Internet bubble was bursting.

The film had its world premiere at the Sundance Film Festival on January 21, 2001. It was released on May 11, 2001, by Artisan Entertainment.

==Production==
The film was produced by D. A. Pennebaker, and was directed by Chris Hegedus and Jehane Noujaim. Noujaim had been Kaleil Tuzman&#x27;s Harvard classmate and began filming Tuzman as he quit his job at Goldman Sachs, to begin govWorks with his high school friend Tom Herman. Noujaim contacted Hegedus and Pennebaker for help in financing the project. The film was distributed by Artisan Entertainment (which was later acquired by Lions Gate Entertainment).

The film was shot in digital video. The filmmakers shot for over two years, and were editing the more than 400 hours of video and film right up to their Sundance Film Festival premiere in early 2001. They re-edited the last few minutes of the film just prior to its May 2001 theatrical release.

Since the film&#x27;s release, Herman and Tuzman worked together again at Recognition Group and JumpTV.

==Reception==

===Critical response===
&quot;Startup.com&quot; received positive reviews from film critics. On Rotten Tomatoes it holds a 93% approval rating, based on 94 reviews, with an average rating of 7.55/10. The site&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;Startup.com is more than just a look at the rise and fall of the new economy. At its center is a friendship being tested to the limit, and that&#x27;s what makes it worth viewing.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a score of 75 out of 100, based on reviews from 32 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;.

David Rooney of &quot;Variety&quot; called it a &quot;timely, topical film, which goes beyond its potentially dry diet of facts to incorporate the juicy human drama of Machiavellian manipulations, ambition, torn loyalties and crushing betrayal.&quot;

<text>The Angara rocket family (Russian: Ангара) is a family of launch vehicles being developed by the Moscow-based Khrunichev State Research and Production Space Center. The launch vehicles are to put between and into low Earth orbit and are intended, along with Soyuz-2 variants, to replace several existing launch vehicles.

== History ==
After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, some formerly Soviet launch vehicles required components from companies now located in Ukraine, such as Yuzhnoye Design Bureau, which produced Zenit-2, and Yuzhmash, which produced Dnepr and Tsyklon. Additionally, the Soviet Union&#x27;s main spaceport, Baikonur Cosmodrome, was located in Kazakhstan, and Russia encountered difficulties negotiating for its use. This led to the decision in 1992 to develop a new entirely Russian launch vehicle, named Angara, to replace the launch vehicles now built outside of the country, and ensure Russian access to space without Baikonur. It was decided that this vehicle should ideally use the partially completed Zenit-2 launch pad at the Russian Plesetsk Cosmodrome, and be able to launch military satellites into geosynchronous orbit, which Proton could not due to lack of a launch pad at Plesetsk Cosmodrome. Several companies submitted bids for the new launch vehicle, and in 1994 Khrunichev, the developer of Proton, was selected as the winner. The commercial success of Proton over the next two decades would be an advantage to Khrunichev, as the Angara project immediately ran into funding difficulties from the cash-strapped Russian government.

Khrunichev&#x27;s initial design called for the use of a modified RD-170 for first stage propulsion and a liquid hydrogen powered second stage. By 1997, the hydrogen-powered second stage had been abandoned in favor of kerosene, and the RD-170 was replaced with a modular design which would be powered by the new RD-191, a one-chamber engine derived from the four-chamber RD-170. In late 1997, Khrunichev was given approval from the Russian government to proceed with their new design, which would both be able to replace the ICBM-based Dnepr, Tsyklon, and Rokot with its smaller variants, as well as be able to launch satellites into geostationary orbit from Plesetsk with the Proton-class Angara A5.

By 2004, the design of Angara had taken shape and the project proceeded with development of the launchers. In 2008, NPO Energomash, the builder of the RD-191, reported that the engine had completed development and burn tests and was ready for manufacturing and delivery, and in January 2009 the first completed Angara first stage was delivered to Khrunichev. The next year Vladimir Nesterov, Director-General of Khrunichev, announced that the first flight test of Angara would be scheduled for 2013, and in 2013 the first prototype Angara launch vehicle arrived in Plesetsk.

In 2014, 22 years after Angara&#x27;s original conception, the first launch took place on 9 July 2014, an Angara 1.2PP suborbital test flight from the northern Plesetsk Cosmodrome. On 23 December 2014, Angara A5&#x27;s first test flight was performed, launching it into geosynchronous orbit. In June 2020, it was reported that the first Angara Launching Pad was completed and would be transported to Vostochny Cosmodrome.

On 14 December 2020, 6 years after the first test flight, Angara-A5&#x27;s second test flight took place from Plesetsk. According to Roscosmos chief Dmitriy Rogozin speaking about future plans after the launch in December 2020, two more Angara launches were coming in 2021: an Angara-1.2 and an Angara-A5 with a new booster, Persei. Only the launch of Angara-A5 with Persei upper stage ended up happening in 2021. The maiden flight of Angara 1.2 happened on 29 April 2022.

== Vehicle description ==
=== URM-1: first stage and boosters ===
The Universal Rocket Module (URM-1) forms the core of every Angara vehicle. In the Angara A5, four additional URM-1s act as boosters. Each URM-1 is powered by a single NPO Energomash RD-191 burning liquid oxygen and RP-1 (kerosene).

The RD-191 is a single-chamber engine derived from the four-chamber RD-170, originally developed for the boosters powering the Energia launch vehicle. Zenit&#x27;s four-chamber RD-171 and the dual-chamber RD-180 powering ULA&#x27;s Atlas V are also derivatives of the RD-170, as is the RD-193 proposed as a replacement for the 1970s-era NK-33 powering the first stage of the Soyuz 2.1v. The RD-191 is capable of throttling down to at least 30%, allowing core URM-1 stages to conserve propellant until booster URM-1 separation.

The URM-1 consists of a liquid oxygen tank at the top, followed by an intertank structure containing flight control and telemetry equipment, with the kerosene tank below that. At the base of the module is a propulsion bay containing engine gimballing equipment for vehicle pitch and yaw and thrusters for roll control.

=== URM-2: second stage ===
The second stage of the Angara, designated URM-2, uses one KBKhA RD-0124A engine also burning liquid oxygen and kerosene. The RD-0124A is nearly identical to the RD-0124 currently powering the second stage of Soyuz-2, designated Block I. The URM-2 has a diameter of for the Angara A5 and other proposed variants. The Angara 1.2 will fly a smaller RD-0124A-powered second stage, which may be to maintain commonality with Block I or widened to to maintain a consistent diameter with URM-1.

=== Upper stages (after 2nd) ===
Angara 1.2 will not use an upper stage, nor will Angara A5 when delivering payloads to low orbits. For higher energy orbits such as GTO, Angara A5 will use the Briz-M upper stage (currently used for the Proton-M rocket), powered by one S5.98M burning N2O4 and UDMH, or eventually a new cryogenic upper stage, the KVTK. This stage will use the LH2/LOX powered RD-0146D and allow Angara A5 to bring up to two tonnes more mass to GTO. The Blok D is being considered as an upper stage when launched from Vostochny since it will avoid the toxic propellant of the Briz-M.

== Variants ==
=== Angara 1.2 ===
The smallest Angara is the Angara 1.2, which consists of one URM-1 core and a modified Block I second stage. It has a lift-off mass of 171 tonnes and can deliver 3.8 tonnes of payload to a x 60° orbit. The successful maiden launch of Angara 1.2 took place 29 April 2022.

==== Angara 1.2pp ====
A modified Angara 1.2, called Angara 1.2PP (&quot;Angara-1.2 pervyy polyot&quot;, meaning &quot;Angara-1.2 first flight&quot;), made Angara&#x27;s inaugural suborbital flight on 9 July 2014. This flight lasted 22 minutes and carried a mass simulator weighing . Angara 1.2PP weighed and consisted of a URM-1 core stage and a partially fueled -diameter URM-2, allowing each of the major components of Angara A5 to be flight tested before that version&#x27;s first orbital launch, conducted on 23 December 2014.

=== Angara A5 ===

The second Angara developed was the heavy lift launch vehicle, the Angara A5, which consists of one URM-1 core and four URM-1 boosters, a URM-2 second stage, and an upper stage, either the Briz-M or the KVTK. Weighing 773 tonnes at lift-off, Angara A5 has a payload capacity of 24.5 tonnes to a x 60° orbit. Angara A5 is able to deliver 5.4 tonnes to GTO with Briz-M, or 7.5 tonnes to the same orbit with KVTK.

In the Angara A5, the four URM-1s used as boosters operate at full thrust for approximately 214 seconds, then separate. The URM-1 forming the vehicle&#x27;s core is operated at full thrust for lift off, then throttled down to 30% to conserve propellant. The core is throttled back up after the boosters have separated and continues burning for another 110 seconds.

The first Angara A5 test flight was launched on 23 December 2014. The second test flight was launched on 14 December 2020 from Plesetsk. A third test flight was launched on 27 December 2021, also from Plesetsk. However, the test of Persei upper stage failed and the payload did not make it from LEO to GEO.

=== Proposed versions ===
==== Angara 1.1 ====
Initial plans called for an even smaller Angara 1.1 using a Briz-KM as a second stage, with a payload capacity of 2 tonnes. This version was cancelled as it fell into the same payload class as the Soyuz 2.1v, which made its debut flight in 2013.

==== Angara A3 ====
The Angara A3 would consist of one URM-1 core, two URM-1 boosters, the 3.6m URM-2, and an optional Briz-M or hydrogen powered upper stage for high energy orbits. The hydrogen powered stage for this vehicle, called RCAF would be smaller than the Angara A5&#x27;s KVTK. This vehicle has no current plans for use (14.6 tonnes to 200 km x 60°, 2.4 tonnes to GTO with Briz-M or 3.6 tonnes with a hydrogen upper stage), but could be developed as a replacement for Zenit.

==== Angara A5P ====
Khrunichev has proposed an Angara A5 capable of launching a new crewed spacecraft weighing up to 18 tonnes: the Angara 5P. This version would have 4 URM-1s as boosters surrounding a sustainer core URM-1 but lack a second stage, relying on the spacecraft to complete orbital insertion from a slightly suborbital trajectory, much like the Buran or Space Shuttle. This has the advantage of allowing all engines to be lit and checked out while on the ground, eliminating the possibility of an engine failing to start after staging. The RD-191 engines may also be operated at reduced thrust to improve safety.

==== Angara A5V ====
Khrunichev has proposed an upgraded Angara A5 variant with a new big hydrogen-based upper stage (URM-2V) as replacement for URM-2 and upgraded engine thrust on the URM-1 stages. The thrust up the URM-1 boosters would be 10% higher during the first 40 seconds to allow good thrust/weight ratio even with the URM-2 replaced with the heavier URM-2V. Cross-feed and even more powerful RD-195 engines for the URM-1 are also considered. The capacity of A5V is supposed to be around 35-40 tonnes to LEO depending on final configuration.

==== Angara A7 ====
Proposals exist for a heavier Angara A7, weighing 1133 tonnes and capable of putting 35 tonnes into a x 60° orbit, or delivering 12.5 tonnes to GTO with an enlarged KVTK-A7 as a second stage in place of the URM-2. There are no current plans to develop this vehicle as it would require a larger core URM-1 to carry more propellant and would have to await the development of the hydrogen powered engine for KVTK. The Angara A7 would also require a different launch pad.

==== Angara-100 ====
The Angara-100 was a 2005 proposal by Khrunichev to build a heavy-lift launch vehicle for NASA&#x27;s Vision for Space Exploration. The rocket would consist of four RD-170-powered boosters, an RD-180-powered core stage, and a cryogenic upper stage using a modified Energia RD-0120 engine, the RD-0122. Its payload capacity to LEO would be in excess of 100 tons.

==== Baikal ====
Together with NPO Molniya, Khrunichev has also proposed a reusable URM-1 booster named Baikal. The URM-1 would be fitted with a wing, an empennage, a landing gear, a return flight engine and attitude control thrusters, to enable the rocket booster to return to an airfield after completing its mission.

== Specifications ==
=== Active ===
=== Cancelled or proposed ===
== Testing and manufacturing ==
The production of the Universal Rocket Modules and the Briz-M upper stages will take place at the Khrunichev subsidiary Production Corporation Polyot in Omsk. In 2009, Polyot invested over 771.4 million RUB (about US$25 million) in Angara production lines. Design and testing of the RD-191 engine was done by NPO Energomash, while its mass production will take place at the company Proton-PM in Perm, Russia.

== Launches ==
=== Facilities ===
Angara will primarily be launched from the Plesetsk Cosmodrome. Beginning in 2020, , plans called for it to also be launched from the Vostochny Cosmodrome. This would have allowed the phase out of Proton, a rocket whose operation at Baikonur Cosmodrome, Kazakhstan has been objected to due to its use of large amounts of highly toxic UDMH and N2O4 and reliability issues.

== Related projects ==
The South Korean launch vehicle Naro-1 used a first stage derived from Angara&#x27;s URM-1 (fitted with a lower-thrust version of the RD-191 engine called RD-151). The vehicle made its first flight on 25 August 2009. The flight was not successful, but the first stage operated as expected. A second launch on 10 June 2010 ended in failure, when contact with the rocket was lost 136 seconds after launch. The Joint Failure Review Board failed to come to a consensus on the cause of the failure. The third flight on 30 January 2013 successfully reached orbit.

<doc id="906090" wikidata="Q2328278" url="?curid=906090" title="Blowoff valve">
<text>A blowoff valve (also called dump valve or compressor bypass valve) is a pressure release system present in most petrol turbocharged engines. Blowoff valves are used to reduce pressure in the intake system as the throttle is closed, thus preventing compressor surge.

== Design ==
A key function of blowoff valves is to prevent compressor surge, a phenomenon that would otherwise occur as the throttle is closed in a turbocharged engine. If the turbocharger&#x27;s compressor wheel is spinning at high speed when the throttle is suddenly closed (such as during a gear change), the flow reduces beyond the surge line of the compressor. At this point the change in pressure across the compressor reduces, leading to a collapse in flow and possibly even flow reversal and a collapse in plenum pressure. As the compressor is still spinning at high speed, once the flow has reduced sufficiently, the change in pressure across the compressor begins to rise and flow is re-established into the plenum. This rapid cycle of pressurisation and depressurisation repeats until the compressor has slowed sufficiently or the throttle is re-opened. The sound produced by compressor surge is called turbo flutter and the repeated, high speed cycling will cause a cyclic torque on the compressor and may lead to increased stresses on the bearings and compressor impeller.

A blowoff valve is designed to release pressure in the intake system when the throttle is closed. A &quot;recirculating&quot; type blowoff valve releases the pressurised air back into the non-pressurized section of the intake (i.e. upstream of the turbocharger), while an &quot;atmospheric venting&quot; type blowoff valve dumps the air directly into the atmosphere.

== Operation ==
A vacuum hose connected to the intake manifold downstream of the throttle provides a reference pressure for the blowoff valve.

When the throttle is open, the air pressure on both sides of the blowoff valve&#x27;s piston is equal, therefore the spring holds the valve closed. As the throttle closes, the pressure in the intake manifold drops below the pressure upstream of the throttle, which causes the valve to open. This allows the excess pressure from the turbocharger to be released into either the atmosphere or the intake manifold.

== Intake air metering ==
In the case where an airflow sensor is present upstream from the blowoff valve and the blowoff valve vents to atmosphere, the fuel injection system is unaware that some of the intake air has been vented instead of going into the cylinders. This volume of vented air is no longer relevant to the engine, however it is still included in the calculations for the required amount of fuel, which causes excess fuel to be injected and therefore the engine briefly operates with a fuel-rich mixture after each blowoff valve actuation. Effects of this rich running can include fouling the spark plugs, damaging the catalytic converter, stalling and hesitation when the throttle is opened.

One method to avoid this issue is by locating the airflow sensor downstream of the blowoff valve (known as a &quot;blow-through&quot; setup, as opposed to the traditional &quot;draw-through&quot; setup). By using a blow-through method, the MAF won&#x27;t be affected by the blowoff valve opening, since the pressure is vented before the air reaches the MAF.

Other solutions include using a blowoff valve that recirculates the air back into the intake or using a manifold absolute pressure sensor (instead of an airflow sensor) to determine the amount of fuel required.

<doc id="906097" wikidata="Q5272620" url="?curid=906097" title="Dick Allen">
<text>Richard Anthony Allen (March 8, 1942 – December 7, 2020), nicknamed &quot;Crash&quot; and &quot;the Wampum Walloper&quot;, was an American professional baseball player. During his 15-year Major League Baseball (MLB) career, he played as a first baseman and third baseman, most notably for the Philadelphia Phillies and Chicago White Sox, and was one of baseball&#x27;s top sluggers of the 1960s and early 1970s.

A seven-time All-Star player, Allen began his career as a Phillie by being selected 1964 National League (NL) Rookie of the Year and in 1972 was the American League (AL) Most Valuable Player with the Chicago White Sox. He led the AL in home runs twice; the NL in slugging percentage once and the AL twice; and each major league in on-base percentage once apiece. Allen&#x27;s career .534 slugging percentage was among his era&#x27;s highest in an age of comparatively modest offensive production. The Phillies retired Allen&#x27;s uniform number 15 on September 3, 2020, a few months before his death. In , Allen was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame.

==Early life==
Allen was born in Wampum, Pennsylvania, one of nine children of Era and Coy Allen, a truck driver. After his parents divorced, he was mainly raised by his mother who worked as a housekeeper to support her children. Allen grew up in Chewton, Pennsylvania, a small village just outside Wampum.

He attended Wampum High School where, along with his brothers Hank and Ron, he was a star basketball player at the school; All three brothers earned All-State honors. In the 1958–60 season, Allen captained the basketball team, leading them to the state championship and earning All-American honors.

Despite their prowess in basketball, the brothers chose to priortize baseball as, at the time, baseball paid better and they wanted to buy their mother a new house. Hank became an outfielder for three teams in the American League while Ron briefly played first base for the 1972 St. Louis Cardinals. Dick was scouted by Phillies scout Jack Ogden who convinced the team to sign Allen in 1960 for a $70,000 bonus.

==MLB career==

===Philadelphia Phillies===
Allen faced racial harassment while playing for the Phillies&#x27; minor league affiliate in Little Rock; residents sent death threats to Allen, the local team&#x27;s first black player. 

His first full season in the majors, 1964, ranks among the greatest rookie seasons ever. He led the league in runs (125), triples (13), extra base hits (80), and total bases (352); Allen finished in the top five in batting average (.318), slugging average (.557), hits (201), and doubles (38) and won Rookie of the Year. Playing for the first time at third base, he led the league with 41 errors. Along with outfielder Johnny Callison and pitchers Chris Short and Jim Bunning, Allen led the Phillies to a six-and-a-half game hold on first place with 12 games to play in an exceptionally strong National League. The 1964 Phillies then lost ten straight games and finished tied for second place. The Phillies lost the first game of the streak to the Cincinnati Reds when Chico Ruiz stole home with Frank Robinson batting for the game&#x27;s only run. In Allen&#x27;s autobiography (written with Tim Whitaker), &quot;Crash: The Life and Times of Dick Allen&quot;, Allen stated that the play &quot;broke our humps&quot;. Despite the Phillies&#x27; collapse, Allen hit .438 with 5 doubles, 2 triples, 3 home runs and 11 RBI in those last 12 games.

Allen hit a two-run home run off the Cubs&#x27; Larry Jackson on May 29, 1965 that cleared the Coke sign on Connie Mack Stadium&#x27;s left-center field roof. That home run, an estimated 529-footer, inspired Willie Stargell to say: &quot;Now I know why they (the Phillies fans) boo Richie all the time. When he hits a home run, there&#x27;s no souvenir.&quot;
While playing for Philadelphia, Allen appeared on several All-Star teams including the 1965–67 teams (in the latter of these three games, he hit a home run off Dean Chance). He led the league in slugging (.632), OPS (1.027) and extra base hits (75) in 1966.

Non-baseball incidents soon marred Allen&#x27;s Philadelphia career. In July 1965, he got into a fistfight with teammate Frank Thomas. According to two teammates who witnessed the fight, Thomas swung a bat at Allen, hitting him in the shoulder. Johnny Callison said, &quot;Thomas got himself fired when he swung that bat at Richie. In baseball you don&#x27;t swing a bat at another player—ever.&quot; Pat Corrales confirmed that Thomas hit Allen with a bat and added that Thomas was a &quot;bully&quot; known for making racially divisive remarks. Allen and his teammates were not permitted to give their side of the story under threat of a heavy fine. The Phillies released Thomas the next day. That not only made the fans and local sports writers see Allen as costing a white player his job, but freed Thomas to give his version of the fight. In an hour-long interview aired December 15, 2009, on the MLB Network&#x27;s &quot;Studio 42 with Bob Costas&quot;, Allen asserted that he and Thomas had since become good friends.

Allen&#x27;s name was a source of controversy: he had been known since his youth as &quot;Dick&quot; to family and friends, but the media referred to him upon his arrival in Philadelphia as &quot;Richie&quot;. After leaving the Phillies, he asked to be called &quot;Dick&quot;, saying Richie was a little boy&#x27;s name. In his dual career as an R&amp;B singer, the label on his records with the Groovy Grooves firm slated him as &quot;Rich&quot; Allen.

Some Phillies fans, known for being tough on hometown players even in the best of times, exacerbated Allen&#x27;s problems. Initially the abuse was verbal, with obscenities and racial epithets. Eventually Allen was greeted with showers of fruit, ice, refuse, and even flashlight batteries as he took the field. He began wearing his batting helmet even while playing his position in the field, which gave rise to another nickname, &quot;Crash Helmet&quot;, shortened to &quot;Crash&quot;.

He almost ended his career in 1967 after mangling his throwing hand by pushing it through a car headlight. Allen was fined $2,500 and suspended indefinitely in 1969 when he failed to appear for the Phillies twi-night doubleheader game with the New York Mets. Allen had gone to New Jersey in the morning to see a horse race, and got caught in traffic trying to return.

===St. Louis Cardinals and Los Angeles Dodgers===
Allen finally had enough, and demanded the Phillies trade him. They sent him to the Cardinals in a trade before the 1970 season. Even this deal caused controversy, though not of Allen&#x27;s making, since Cardinals outfielder Curt Flood refused to report to the Phillies as part of the trade. (Flood then sued baseball in an unsuccessful attempt to overthrow the reserve clause and to be declared a free agent.) Coincidentally, the player the Phillies received as compensation for Flood not reporting, Willie Montañez, hit 30 home runs as a 1971 rookie to eclipse Allen&#x27;s Phillies rookie home run record of 29, set in 1964. Allen earned another All-Star berth in St. Louis.

Decades before Mark McGwire, Dick Allen entertained the St. Louis fans with some long home runs, at least one of them landing in the seats above the club level in left field. Nevertheless, the Cardinals traded Allen to the Los Angeles Dodgers before the 1971 season for 1969 NL Rookie of the Year Ted Sizemore and young catcher Bob Stinson. Allen had a relatively quiet season in 1971 although he hit .295 for the Dodgers.

===Chicago White Sox===
Allen was acquired by the White Sox from the Dodgers for Tommy John and Steve Huntz at the Winter Meetings on December 2, 1971. For various reasons, his previous managers had shuffled him around on defense, playing him at first base, third base, and the outfield in no particular order – a practice which almost certainly weakened his defensive play, and which may have contributed to his frequent injuries, not to mention his perceived bad attitude. Sox manager Chuck Tanner&#x27;s low-key style of handling ballplayers made it possible for Allen to thrive, for a while, on the South Side. Tanner decided to play Allen exclusively at first base, which allowed him to concentrate on hitting. That first year, his first in the American League (AL), Allen almost single-handedly lifted the entire team to second place in the AL West, as he led the league in home runs (37) (setting a team record), RBI (113), walks (99), on-base percentage (.420), slugging percentage (.603), and on-base plus slugging percentage (1.023), while winning a well-deserved MVP award. However, the Sox fell short at the end and finished games behind the World Series–bound Oakland Athletics.

Allen&#x27;s feats during his years with the White Sox – particularly in that MVP season of 1972 – are spoken of reverently by South Side fans who credit him with saving the franchise for Chicago (it was rumored to be bound for St. Petersburg or Seattle at the time). His powerful swing sent home runs deep into some of cavernous old Comiskey Park&#x27;s farthest reaches, including the roof and even the distant () center field bleachers, a rare feat at one of baseball&#x27;s most pitcher-friendly stadiums. On July 31, 1972, Allen became the first player in baseball&#x27;s &quot;modern era&quot; to hit two inside-the-park home runs in one game. Both homers were hit off Bert Blyleven in the White Sox&#x27; 8–1 victory over the Minnesota Twins at Metropolitan Stadium. On July 6, 1974, at Detroit&#x27;s Tiger Stadium, he lined a homer off the roof façade in deep left-center field at a linear distance of approximately and a height of .

On February 27, 1973, Allen became the highest-paid player in baseball, signing a 3-year $750,000 contract. His $250,000 AAV was a record at the time of the contract&#x27;s signing. The Sox were favored by many to make the playoffs in 1973, but those hopes were dashed due in large measure to the fractured fibula that Allen suffered in June. (He tried to return five weeks after injuring the leg in a collision with Mike Epstein of the California Angels, but the pain ended Allen&#x27;s season after just one game in which he batted 3-for-5.) In 1974, despite his making the AL All-Star team in each of the three years with the Sox, Allen&#x27;s stay in Chicago ended in controversy when he left the team on September 14 with two weeks left in the season. In his autobiography, Allen blamed his feud with then third-baseman/Designated hitter Ron Santo, who was playing a final, undistinguished season with the White Sox after leaving the crosstown Chicago Cubs.

With Allen&#x27;s intention to continue playing baseball uncertain, the White Sox reluctantly sold his contract to the Atlanta Braves for only $5,000, despite the fact that he had led the league in home runs, slugging (.563), and OPS (.938). Allen refused to report to the Braves and announced his retirement.

===Return to the Phillies===
The Phillies coaxed Allen out of retirement for the 1975 season. The lay-off and effects of his broken leg in 1973 hampered his play. His numbers improved in 1976, a Phillies division winner, as he hit 15 home runs and batted .268 in 85 games. He continued his tape measure legacy during his second go-round with the Phillies. On August 22, 1975, Allen smashed a homer into the upper deck at San Diego Stadium, as the Phillies beat the Padres 6-5.

===Oakland Athletics===
Allen played in 54 games and hit five home runs with 31 RBI with a .240 batting average during his final season, for the Oakland Athletics in 1977 before leaving the team abruptly in June of that season. His final day as a player was on June 19, playing both games of a doubleheader, against the White Sox. In five total plate appearances, he had two hits, with his final hit being a single in the eighth inning.

==Career statistics and honors==
During a pitching-dominant era, Allen was considered one of the top sluggers of the 1960s and 1970s era. He finished his career with 351 home runs and a .534 slugging percentage.

Allen&#x27;s number 15 was retired by the Phillies in September 2020. He was inducted into the Baseball Reliquary&#x27;s Shrine of the Eternals in 2004.

==Hall of Fame candidacy==
Sabermetrician Bill James rated Dick Allen as the second-most controversial player in baseball history, behind Rogers Hornsby. Allen had the highest slugging percentage among players eligible for but not in the National Baseball Hall of Fame until Albert Belle became eligible in 2006.

Allen Barra wrote that a &quot;growing body of baseball historians think that Dick Allen is the best player eligible for the Hall of Fame.&quot; The arguments usually centered around his very high career averages, batting (.292), slugging (.534), and on-base (.378). They also state that he began his career during the mid-1960s, a period so dominated by pitchers that it is sometimes called the &quot;second dead ball era.&quot; Of the major league batters with 500 or more career home runs whose play intersected Dick Allen&#x27;s career at the beginning or end, only Mickey Mantle&#x27;s lifetime OPS+ of 172 topped Dick Allen&#x27;s lifetime 156 OPS+. Allen also played some of his career in pitcher-friendly parks such as Busch Memorial Stadium, Dodger Stadium, and Comiskey Park.

In addition to hitting for high offensive percentages, Allen displayed prodigious power. Before scientific weight training, muscle-building dietary supplements, and anabolic steroids, Allen boasted a muscular physique along the lines of Mickey Mantle and Jimmie Foxx. Baseball historian Bill Jenkinson ranks Allen with Foxx and Mantle, and just a notch below Babe Ruth, as the four top long-distance sluggers ever to wield a baseball bat. A segment of MLB Network&#x27;s &quot;Prime 9&quot; concurred with Jenkinson&#x27;s findings. On that same broadcast, Willie Mays stated that Allen hit a ball harder than any player he had ever seen. Dick Allen, like Babe Ruth, hit with a rather heavy bat. Allen&#x27;s 40-ounce bat bucked the Ted Williams-inspired trend of using a light bat for increased bat speed. Allen combined massive strength and body torque to produce bat speed and drive the ball. Two of his drives cleared Connie Mack Stadium&#x27;s left-field grandstand. Allen also cleared that park&#x27;s 65-foot-high right-center field scoreboard twice, a feat considered virtually impossible for a right-handed hitter.

Detractors of Allen&#x27;s Hall of Fame credentials argue that his career was not as long as most Hall of Famers, and therefore lacked the career cumulative numbers that others do. They further argue that the controversies surrounding him negatively impacted his teams.

Hall of Fame player Willie Stargell countered with a historical perspective of Dick Allen&#x27;s time: &quot;Dick Allen played the game in the most conservative era in baseball history. It was a time of change and protest in the country, and baseball reacted against all that. They saw it as a threat to the game. The sportswriters were reactionary too. They didn&#x27;t like seeing a man of such extraordinary skills doing it his way. It made them nervous. Dick Allen was ahead of his time. His views and way of doing things would go unnoticed today. If I had been manager of the Phillies back when he was playing, I would have found a way to make Dick Allen comfortable. I would have told him to blow off the writers. It was my observation that when Dick Allen was comfortable, balls left the park.&quot;

The two managers for whom Allen played the longest – Gene Mauch of the Phillies, and Chuck Tanner of the White Sox – agreed with Willie Stargell that Allen was not a &quot;clubhouse lawyer&quot; who harmed team chemistry. Asked if Allen&#x27;s behavior ever had a negative influence on the team, Mauch said, &quot;Never. Dick&#x27;s teammates always liked him. I&#x27;d take him in a minute.&quot; According to Tanner, &quot;Dick was the leader of our team, the captain, the manager on the field. He took care of the young kids, took them under his wing. And he played every game as if it was his last day on earth.&quot;

Hall of Fame player Orlando Cepeda agreed, saying to author Tim Whitaker, &quot;Dick Allen played with fire in his eyes.&quot;

Hall of Fame teammate Goose Gossage also confirmed Tanner&#x27;s view. In an interview with USA TODAY Sports, Gossage said: &quot;I&#x27;ve been around the game a long time, and he&#x27;s the greatest player I&#x27;ve ever seen play in my life. He had the most amazing season (1972) I&#x27;ve ever seen. He&#x27;s the smartest baseball man I&#x27;ve ever been around in my life. He taught me how to pitch from a hitter&#x27;s perspective, and taught me how to play the game right. There&#x27;s no telling the numbers this guy could have put up if all he worried about was stats. The guy belongs in the Hall of Fame.&quot;

Another of Allen&#x27;s ex-White Sox teammates, pitcher Stan Bahnsen, said, &quot;I actually thought that Dick was better than his stats. Every time we needed a clutch hit, he got it. He got along great with his teammates and he was very knowledgeable about the game. He was the ultimate team guy.&quot;

Another Hall of Fame teammate, Mike Schmidt, credited Dick Allen in his 2006 book, &quot;Clearing the Bases&quot;, as his mentor. In Schmidt&#x27;s biography, written by historian William C. Kashatus, Schmidt fondly recalls Allen mentoring him before a game in Chicago in 1976, saying to him, &quot;Mike, you&#x27;ve got to relax. You&#x27;ve got to have some fun. Remember when you were just a kid and you&#x27;d skip supper to play ball? You were having fun. Hey, with all the talent you&#x27;ve got, baseball ought to be fun. Enjoy it. Be a kid again.&quot; Schmidt responded by hitting four home runs in the game. 
Schmidt is quoted in the same book, &quot;The baseball writers used to claim that Dick would divide the clubhouse along racial lines. That was a lie. The truth is that Dick never divided any clubhouse.&quot;

=== BBWAA consideration ===
Allen was included in 1983 Baseball Hall of Fame balloting for consideration by the Baseball Writers&#x27; Association of America (BBWAA). He received 14 votes out of the 374 ballots cast (3.7%). He was not on the 1984 ballot, but returned in 1985 and remained on the ballot until 1997. He never received more than 18.9% of the vote (75% is required for election).

=== Committee consideration ===
In 2010, the Baseball Hall of Fame established a Golden Era Committee (one of several new committees replacing the prior Veterans Committee), to vote on the possible Hall of Fame induction of previously overlooked candidates who played between 1947 and 1972. Beginning in December 2011, this 16-member committee voted every three years on 10 nominated candidates from the era, selected by the BBWAA&#x27;s Historical Overview Committee. Allen was first considered in December 2014 (for the class of ). Allen and former outfielder Tony Oliva both fell one vote short of the 12 required votes, as no one was elected by the committee.

In 2016, the Golden Era Committee was replaced by the Golden Days Committee (1950–1969) to vote on 10 candidates beginning in December 2020 (for the class of 2021). In August 2020, the Hall of Fame rescheduled the committee&#x27;s first winter meeting voting to December 2021 (for the class of ), due to the COVID-19 pandemic. On December 5, 2021, results of Golden Days Committee voting was released; Allen again fell one vote short of election, garnering 11 votes from the 16-member committee. 

He appeared on the Classic Baseball Era Committee&#x27;s ballot on December 8, 2024, and was elected with 13 out of 16 votes. He will be formally inducted on July 27, 2025.

== Music career ==
Dick Allen sang professionally in a high, delicate tenor. The tone and texture of his voice has drawn comparisons to Harptones&#x27; lead singer Willie Winfield. During Allen&#x27;s time with the Sixties-era Phillies, he sang lead with a doo-wop group called The Ebonistics. &quot;Rich Allen and The Ebonistics&quot; sang professionally at Philadelphia night clubs. He once entertained during halftime of a Philadelphia 76ers basketball game. &quot;The Philadelphia Inquirer&quot; printed a review of his performance:
Although his music career was not as substantial or long-lasting as that of Milwaukee Braves outfielder Lee Maye, Allen gained lasting praise for recording a 45 single on the Groovey Grooves label (160-A, &quot;Rich Allen and the Ebonistics&quot;) titled &quot;Echo&#x27;s of November&quot; (misspelled Echoes) which was released in 1968. The song name is featured in the Phillies&#x27; official hundred-year anniversary video and the novel &quot;&#x27;64 Intruder&quot;. In 2010, Brazilian pop star Ana Volans re-recorded Echoes of November; her rendition sold briskly in Brazil, and the CD&#x27;s jacket contains a dedication to Dick Allen and his Hall of Fame candidacy).

==Personal life==
Allen first married his classmate Barbara Moore with whom he had three children: sons Richard Jr. and Eron, and daughter Terri; their marriage ended in divorce. Terri Allen was murdered outside her apartment in Largo, Maryland, by her boyfriend in a murder-suicide in 1991.

His marriage to his second wife, Willa ( King), lasted 33 years. The couple lived in Wampum, Pennsylvania. He died at his home in Wampum on December 7, 2020, at age 78.

<text>Whitney Moore Young Jr. (July 31, 1921 – March 11, 1971) was an American civil rights leader. Trained as a social worker, he spent most of his career working to end employment discrimination in the United States and turning the National Urban League from a relatively passive civil rights organization into one that aggressively worked for equitable access to socioeconomic opportunity for the historically disenfranchised. Young was influential in the United States federal government&#x27;s War on Poverty in the 1960s.

==Early life and career==
Young was born in Shelby County, Kentucky, on July 31, 1921. His father, Whitney M. Young Sr., was the president of the Lincoln Institute, and served twice as the president of the Kentucky Negro Educational Association. Whitney&#x27;s mother, Laura (Ray) Young, was a teacher who served as the first female postmistress in Kentucky (second in the United States), being appointed to that position by President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1940. Young enrolled in the Lincoln Institute at the age of 13, graduating as his class valedictorian, with his sister Margaret becoming salutatorian, in 1937.

Young earned his Bachelor of Science in social work from Kentucky State University, a historically black institution. Young had aspirations of becoming a medical doctor at Kentucky State. During his time at Kentucky State, Young was also a forward on the university&#x27;s basketball team, and was a member of Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity, where he served as the vice president. He became the president of his senior class, and graduated in 1941.

During World War II, Young was trained in electrical engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). He was then assigned to a road construction crew of black soldiers supervised by Southern white officers. After just three weeks, he was promoted from private to first sergeant, creating hostility on both sides. Despite the tension, Young was able to mediate effectively between his white officers and black soldiers angry at their poor treatment. This situation propelled Young into a career in race relations.

After the war, Young joined his wife, Margaret, at the University of Minnesota, where he earned a master&#x27;s degree in social work in 1947 and volunteered for the St. Paul branch of the National Urban League. He was then appointed as the industrial relations secretary in that branch in 1949.

In 1950, Young became president of the National Urban League&#x27;s Omaha, Nebraska chapter. In that position, he helped get black workers into jobs previously reserved for whites. Under his leadership, the chapter tripled its number of paying members. While he was president of the Omaha Urban League, Young taught at the University of Nebraska from 1950 to 1954, and Creighton University from 1951 to 1952.

In 1954, he took up his next position, as the first dean of social work at Atlanta University.

There, Young supported alumni in their boycott of the Georgia Conference of Social Welfare in response to low rates of African-American employment within the organization. In December, 1954, Young and his wife Margaret were the first blacks to join the United Liberal Church (since 1965, named the Unitarian Universalist Congregation of Atlanta), and Whitney would eventually join its board of trustees. Due in part to the Youngs&#x27; influence, the church stopped having its annual picnics at segregated parks and became &quot;integrated not just desegregated.&quot; Many in the congregation were active in the civil rights movement, and the Reverend Martin Luther King Jr., then assistant to his father at nearby Ebenezer Baptist Church, was a pulpit guest.

In 1957, he co-authored &quot;Some Pioneers in Social Work: brief sketches; student work book&quot; with Florence V. Adams.
In 1960, Young was awarded a Rockefeller Foundation grant for a postgraduate year at Harvard University. In the same year, he joined the NAACP and rose to become state president, where he was also a close friend of Roy Wilkins, its executive director.

==Executive Director of National Urban League==
In 1961, at age 40, Young became executive director of the National Urban League. He was unanimously selected by the National Urban League&#x27;s Board of Directors, succeeding Lester Granger on October 1, 1961. Within four years he expanded the organization from 38 employees to 1,600 employees; and from an annual budget of $325,000 to one of $6,100,000. Young served as President of the Urban League until his death in 1971.

The Urban League had traditionally been a cautious and moderate organization with many white members. During Young&#x27;s ten-year tenure at the League, he brought the organization to the forefront of the American Civil Rights Movement. He both greatly expanded its mission and kept the support of influential white business and political leaders. In a 1964 interview with Robert Penn Warren for the book &quot;Who Speaks for the Negro?&quot; and archived at the Louie B. Nunn Center for Oral History, Young expressed the mission of the Urban League not as ground-level activism in itself but as the supplement and complement of the activities of all other organizations; he states, &quot;we are the social engineers, we are the strategists, we are the planners, we are the people who work at the level of policy-making, policy implementation, the highest echelons of the corporate community, the highest echelons of the governmental community – both at the federal, state and local level – the highest echelons of the labor movement.&quot; As part of the League&#x27;s new mission, Young initiated programs like &quot;Street Academy&quot;, an alternative education system to prepare high school dropouts for college, and &quot;New Thrust&quot;, an effort to help local black leaders identify and solve community problems. He also pushed for initiatives like scholarships to recruit black people into the architecture profession, which has been and continues to be predominantly white.

Young also pushed for federal aid to cities, proposing a domestic &quot;Marshall Plan&quot;. This plan, which called for $145 billion in spending over 10 years, was partially incorporated into President Lyndon B. Johnson&#x27;s War on Poverty. Young described his proposals for integration, social programs, and affirmative action in his two books, &quot;To Be Equal&quot; (1964) and &quot;Beyond Racism&quot; (1969).

As executive director of the League, Young pushed major corporations to hire more blacks. In doing so, he fostered close relationships with CEOs such as Henry Ford II, leading some blacks to charge that Young had sold out to the white establishment. Young denied these charges and stressed the importance of working within the system to effect change. Still, Young was not afraid to take a bold stand in favor of civil rights. For instance, in 1963, Young was one of the organizers of the March on Washington despite the opposition of many white business leaders.

Despite his reluctance to enter politics himself, Young was an important advisor to Presidents Kennedy, Johnson, and Nixon. In 1968, representatives of President-elect Richard Nixon tried to interest Young in a Cabinet post, but Young refused, believing that he could accomplish more through the Urban League.

Young had a particularly close relationship with President Johnson, and in 1969, Johnson honored Young with the highest civilian award, the Presidential Medal of Freedom. Young, in turn, was impressed by Johnson&#x27;s commitment to civil rights.

Despite their close personal relationship, Young was frustrated by Johnson&#x27;s attempts to use him to balance Martin Luther King&#x27;s opposition to the increasingly unpopular Vietnam War. Young publicly supported Johnson&#x27;s war policy, but came to oppose the war after the end of Johnson&#x27;s presidency.

In 1968, as part of an FBI organized COINTELPRO operation against the Black liberation movement, Herman B. Ferguson and Arthur Harris were convicted of conspiring to murder Young. The police infiltrators who concocted this frame-up portrayed it as a &quot;Black revolutionary plot.&quot; The trial took place in the New York State Supreme Court, with Justice Paul Balsam presiding.

== Contribution to the American Institute of Architects ==
In 1968, Young was invited to address the American Institute of Architects National Convention in Portland, Oregon through the keynote speech. At the time, Young was the executive director of the National Urban League and had spoken before on the concerns of the AIA regarding social and racial inequality in housing and cities. In his speech, he addressed the institute&#x27;s silent stance on the turmoil in the country and urged them to stand up and endorse the efforts of John F. Kennedy &amp; Martin Luther King Jr. in their actions. In response to Young&#x27;s words, the Institute created two separate resolutions to advance the organizations initiative for diversity and social equality: one created a scholarship program, the AIA/Architects Foundation Diversity Advancement Scholarship, specifically for minorities who wanted to study architecture and another called architects to be actively engaged in the current social issues. To address the lack of diversity in the profession, the AIA revised their Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct to ban discrimination based on sex, race or religion and was expanded in subsequent years to include place of origin, disabled status and sexual orientation or gender identity. The institute also created a Whitney M. Young Jr. Award for those that embodies the social principles of equity and justice that Young fought for. &quot;Community design&quot; emerged as an initiative for architects to engage with people in urban projects, instead of working exclusively alone. Young&#x27;s speech served as a driver for those that were previously frustrated with architecture and urban design. The AIA then started the Regional/Urban Design Assistance Team Program and Center for Communities by Design as programs that work for community development and include community members in the design process.

==Leadership at the National Association of Social Workers (NASW)==
Young served as president of the National Association of Social Workers (NASW), from 1969 to 1971. He took office at a time of fiscal instability in the association and uncertainty about President Nixon&#x27;s continuing commitment to the &quot;War on Poverty&quot; and to ending the war in Vietnam. At the 1969 NASW Delegate Assembly Young stated,

First of all, I think the country is in deep trouble. We, as a country have blazed unimagined trails technologically and industrially. We have not yet begun to pioneer in those things that are human and social… I think that social work is uniquely equipped to play a major role in this social and human renaissance of our society, which will, if successful, lead to its survival, and if it is unsuccessful, will lead to its justifiable death.
:—&quot;NASW News&quot;, May 1969

Young spent his tenure as President of NASW ensuring that the profession kept pace with the troubling social and human challenges it was facing. &quot;NASW News&quot; articles document his call to action for social workers to address social welfare through poverty reduction, race reconciliation, and putting an end to the War in Vietnam. In the &quot;NASW News&quot;, July 1970, he challenged his professional social work organization to take leadership in the national struggle for social welfare:

The crisis in health and welfare services in our nation today highlights for NASW what many of us have been stressing for a long time: inherent in the responsibility for leadership in social welfare is responsibility for professional action. They are not disparate aspects of social work but merely two faces of the same coin to be spent on more and better services for the people who need our help. It is out of our belief in this broad definition of responsibility for social welfare that NASW is taking leadership in the efforts to reorder our nation&#x27;s priorities and future direction, and is calling on social workers everywhere to do the same.

The &quot;NASW News&quot;, May 1971, tribute to Young noted that &quot;As usual Whitney Young was preparing to do battle on the major issues and programs facing the association and the nation. And he was doing it with his usual aplomb-dapper, self-assured, ready to deal with the &quot;power&quot; people to bring about change for the powerless.&quot;

Young was also the Dean of the school of Social Work at Clark Atlanta University, which now bears his name. In his last column as President for NASW, Young wrote, &quot;whatever we do we should tell the public what we are doing and why. They have to hear from social workers as much as they hear from reporters and government officials.&quot;

==Death==
On March 11, 1971, Young drowned while swimming with friends in Lagos, Nigeria, where he was attending a conference sponsored by the African-American Institute. President Nixon sent a plane to Nigeria to collect Young&#x27;s body and traveled to Kentucky to deliver the eulogy at Young&#x27;s funeral.

== Marriage and family ==
In 1944, he married Margaret Buckner Young. They had two daughters and moved to New Rochelle in 1961.

Marcia Young Cantarella, PhD has been a dean or senior administrator at several colleges including NYU, Princeton and Hunter Colleges, serves 
on several boards and is the author of I CAN Finish College: The Overcome Any Obstacle and Get Your Degree Guide.
His daughter Lauren Young Casteel became the first black woman to head a foundation in Colorado.
There are also several grandchildren and great-grandchildren, including businessman Mark Boles who served on the Urban League board and artist Jordan Casteel.

==Legacy==
In his eulogy, Nixon stated that Young&#x27;s legacy was that &quot;he knew how to accomplish what other people were merely for&quot;. Young&#x27;s work was considered instrumental in breaking down the barriers of segregation and inequality that held back African Americans.

===Namesakes===
Many sites across the country are named after Young or have memorials dedicated to him. For instance, in 1973, the East Capitol Street Bridge in Washington, D.C., was renamed the Whitney Young Memorial Bridge in his honor. Young&#x27;s birthplace (Whitney Young Birthplace and Museum) in Shelby County, Kentucky is a designated National Historic Landmark, with a museum dedicated to Young&#x27;s life and achievements.

Young was honored in 1981 by the United States Postal Service on a postage stamp issued as part of its ongoing Black Heritage series.

The Whitney Young School of Honors and Liberal Studies at Kentucky State University was named after him. Also, Clark Atlanta University named its School of Social Work, where Whitney Young served as Dean, in Young&#x27;s honor. The Whitney M. Young School of Social Work is well known for founding the &quot;Afro-Centric&quot; perspective of social work.

The Boy Scouts of America created the Whitney M. Young Jr. Service Award to recognize outstanding services by an adult individual or an organization for demonstrated involvement in the development and implementation of Scouting opportunities for youth from rural or low-income urban backgrounds. In 1973, The African American MBA Association at The Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania held its first Annual Whitney M. Young Jr. Memorial Conference. After 38 years, the Whitney M. Young Jr. Memorial Conference is the longest student-run conference held at The Wharton School.

The America center in Lagos, Nigeria located within the U.S. Consulate which was formerly the Information resource center in Lagos has also been named after him.

Schools named after Young include Whitney M. Young Magnet High School in Chicago, Whitney M. Young Gifted &amp; Talented Leadership Academy in Cleveland, Ohio, Whitney Young Early Childhood Center in Fort Wayne, Indiana, Whitney Young School in Louisville, KY, and Whitney M. Young Elementary in Dallas, Texas.

The Whitney M. Young Health Center in Albany, New York was also named after him.

The American Institute of Architects honors annually a recipient of the Whitney Young Jr award. In 2019 this award was received by Karen Braitmayer for her contributions to universal design 

==In movies==
The documentary, &quot;The Powerbroker: Whitney Young&#x27;s Fight for Civil Rights&quot;, directed by Christine Khalafian and Taylor Hamilton, chronicles Young&#x27;s rise from segregated Kentucky to the national movement for civil rights. The film includes archival footage, photos, and interviews compiled by Young&#x27;s niece, award-winning journalist Bonnie Boswell Hamilton. Interviews include Henry Louis Gates Jr., Ossie Davis, Julian Bond, Roy Innis, Vernon Jordan, Dorothy Height, and Donald Rumsfeld.

<text>Derek Roy Taunt (16 November 1917(Note 1) – 15 July 2004) was a British mathematician who worked as a codebreaker during World War II at Bletchley Park.

Taunt attended Enfield Grammar, then the City of London School. He studied mathematics at Jesus College, Cambridge between 1936 and 1939. He was accepted as a research student by G. H. Hardy, but this was postponed by the outbreak of World War II. Taunt registered with the Joint Recruiting Board, and was initially allocated to work on ballistics at Kemnal Manor in Chislehurst, preparing range tables for new weapons. Finding that the task required only trivial mathematics (&quot;more like advanced arithmetic than real mathematics&quot;), he sought more appropriate work.

In August 1941 he was moved to Bletchley Park and assigned to Hut 6, the section in charge of decrypting German Army and Air Force Enigma signals. While there, he was best man at the marriage of co-workers Bob Roseveare and Ione Jay.

After his wartime work, he returned to Cambridge, and worked on group theory. He was a research student (1945), wrote a doctoral dissertation under Philip Hall, won a Smith&#x27;s Prize in 1949, and was a Lecturer from 1949 with the honorific title of &#x27;Cayley Lecturer&#x27; from 1965 until retirement in 1982. As a Fellow of Jesus College he was at various times a director of studies, tutor, bursar, and from 1979 to 1982 was president. In 1982 he became emeritus Fellow, &quot;with most of the privileges and none of the duties of a Fellow.&quot; His doctoral students include Roger Carter.

On 18 December 1952 Taunt was elected a member of the London Mathematical Society. He was married to the English artist Angela Verren with whom he had three children.

<doc id="906156" wikidata="Q478859" url="?curid=906156" title="Hydrogen economy">
<text>The hydrogen economy is an umbrella term for the roles hydrogen can play alongside low-carbon electricity to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases. The aim is to reduce emissions where cheaper and more energy-efficient clean solutions are not available. In this context, &quot;hydrogen economy&quot; encompasses the production of hydrogen and the use of hydrogen in ways that contribute to phasing-out fossil fuels and limiting climate change.

Hydrogen can be produced by several means. Most hydrogen produced today is &quot;gray hydrogen&quot;, made from natural gas through steam methane reforming (SMR). This process accounted for 1.8% of global greenhouse gas emissions in 2021. &quot;Low-carbon hydrogen&quot;, which is made using SMR with carbon capture and storage (&quot;blue hydrogen&quot;), or through electrolysis of water using renewable power (&quot;green hydrogen&quot;), accounted for less than 1% of production. Virtually all of the 100 million tonnes of hydrogen produced each year is used in oil refining (43% in 2021) and industry (57%), principally in the manufacture of ammonia for fertilizers, and methanol. 

To limit global warming, it is generally envisaged that the future hydrogen economy replaces gray hydrogen with low-carbon hydrogen. As of 2024 it is unclear when enough low-carbon hydrogen could be produced to phase-out all the gray hydrogen. The future end-uses are likely in heavy industry (e.g. high-temperature processes alongside electricity, feedstock for production of green ammonia and organic chemicals, as alternative to coal-derived coke for steelmaking), long-haul transport (e.g. shipping, and to a lesser extent hydrogen-powered aircraft and heavy goods vehicles), and long-term energy storage. Other applications, such as light duty vehicles and heating in buildings, are no longer part of the future hydrogen economy, primarily for economic and environmental reasons. Hydrogen is challenging to store, to transport in pipelines, and to use. It presents safety concerns since it is highly explosive, and it is inefficient compared to direct use of electricity. Since relatively small amounts of low-carbon hydrogen are available, climate benefits can be maximized by using it in harder-to-decarbonize applications. 

 there are no real alternatives to hydrogen for several chemical processes in which it is currently used, such as ammonia production for fertilizer. The cost of low- and zero-carbon hydrogen is likely to influence the degree to which it will be used in chemical feedstocks, long haul aviation and shipping, and long-term energy storage. Production costs of low- and zero-carbon hydrogen are evolving. Future costs may be influenced by carbon taxes, the geography and geopolitics of energy, energy prices, technology choices, and their raw material requirements. It is likely that green hydrogen will see the greatest reductions in production cost over time. The U.S. Department of Energy&#x27;s Hydrogen Hotshot Initiative seeks to reduce the cost of green hydrogen drop to $1 a kilogram during the 2030s. 

== History and objectives ==

=== Origins ===

The concept of a society that uses hydrogen as the primary means of energy storage was theorized by geneticist J. B. S. Haldane in 1923. Anticipating the exhaustion of Britain&#x27;s coal reserves for power generation, Haldane proposed a network of wind turbines to produce hydrogen and oxygen for long-term energy storage through electrolysis, to help address renewable power&#x27;s variable output. The term &quot;hydrogen economy&quot; itself was coined by John Bockris during a talk he gave in 1970 at General Motors (GM) Technical Center. Bockris viewed it as an economy in which hydrogen, underpinned by nuclear and solar power, would help address growing concern about fossil fuel depletion and environmental pollution, by serving as energy carrier for end-uses in which electrification was not suitable.

A hydrogen economy was proposed by the University of Michigan to solve some of the negative effects of using hydrocarbon fuels where the carbon is released to the atmosphere (as carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, unburnt hydrocarbons, etc.). Modern interest in the hydrogen economy can generally be traced to a 1970 technical report by Lawrence W. Jones of the University of Michigan, in which he echoed Bockris&#x27; dual rationale of addressing energy security and environmental challenges. Unlike Haldane and Bockris, Jones only focused on nuclear power as the energy source for electrolysis, and principally on the use of hydrogen in transport, where he regarded aviation and heavy goods transport as the top priorities.

=== Later evolution ===

A spike in attention for the &quot;hydrogen economy&quot; concept during the 2000s was repeatedly described as hype by some critics and proponents of alternative technologies, and investors lost money in the bubble. Interest in the energy carrier resurged in the 2010s, notably with the forming of the World Hydrogen Council in 2017. Several manufacturers released hydrogen fuel cell cars commercially, with manufacturers such as Toyota, Hyundai, and industry groups in China having planned to increase numbers of the cars into the hundreds of thousands over the next decade.

The global scope for hydrogen&#x27;s role in cars is shrinking relative to earlier expectations. By the end of 2022, 70,200 hydrogen vehicles had been sold worldwide, compared with 26 million plug-in electric vehicles.

Early 2020s takes on the hydrogen economy share earlier perspectives&#x27; emphasis on the complementarity of electricity and hydrogen, and the use of electrolysis as the mainstay of hydrogen production. They focus on the need to limit global warming to 1.5 °C and prioritize the production, transportation and use of green hydrogen for heavy industry (e.g. high-temperature processes alongside electricity, feedstock for production of green ammonia and organic chemicals, as alternative to coal-derived coke for steelmaking), long-haul transport (e.g. shipping, aviation and to a lesser extent heavy goods vehicles), and long-term energy storage.

==Current hydrogen market==
Hydrogen production globally was valued at over US$155 billion in 2022 and is expected to grow over 9% annually through 2030.

In 2021, 94 million tonnes (Mt) of molecular hydrogen () was produced. Of this total, approximately one sixth was as a by-product of petrochemical industry processes. Most hydrogen comes from dedicated production facilities, over 99% of which is from fossil fuels, mainly via steam reforming of natural gas (70%) and coal gasification (30%, almost all of which in China). Less than 1% of dedicated hydrogen production is low carbon: steam fossil fuel reforming with carbon capture and storage, green hydrogen produced using electrolysis, and hydrogen produced from biomass. CO2 emissions from 2021 production, at 915 MtCO2, amounted to 2.5% of energy-related CO2 emissions and 1.8% of global greenhouse gas emissions.

Virtually all hydrogen produced for the current market is used in oil refining (40 Mt in 2021) and industry (54 MtH2). In oil refining, hydrogen is used, in a process known as hydrocracking, to convert heavy petroleum sources into lighter fractions suitable for use as fuels. Industrial uses mainly comprise ammonia production to make fertilizers (34 Mt in 2021), methanol production (15 Mt) and the manufacture of direct reduced iron (5 Mt).

== Production ==
===Green methanol===

Green methanol is a liquid fuel that is produced from combining carbon dioxide and hydrogen () under pressure and heat with catalysts. It is a way to reuse carbon capture for recycling. Methanol can store hydrogen economically at standard outdoor temperatures and pressures, compared to liquid hydrogen and ammonia that need to use a lot of energy to stay cold in their liquid state. In 2023 the Laura Maersk was the first container ship to run on methanol fuel. Ethanol plants in the midwest are a good place for pure carbon capture to combine with hydrogen to make green methanol, with abundant wind and nuclear energy in Iowa, Minnesota, and Illinois. Mixing methanol with ethanol could make methanol a safer fuel to use because methanol doesn&#x27;t have a visible flame in the daylight and doesn&#x27;t emit smoke, and ethanol has a visible light yellow flame. Green hydrogen production of 70% efficiency and a 70% efficiency of methanol production from that would be a 49% energy conversion efficiency.

==Uses==
Hydrogen can be deployed as a fuel in two distinct ways: in fuel cells which produce electricity, and via combustion to generate heat. When hydrogen is consumed in fuel cells, the only emission at the point of use is water vapor. Combustion of hydrogen can lead to the thermal formation of harmful nitrogen oxides emissions.

=== Industry ===
In the context of limiting global warming, low-carbon hydrogen (particularly green hydrogen) is likely to play an important role in decarbonizing industry. Hydrogen fuel can produce the intense heat required for industrial production of steel, cement, glass, and chemicals, thus contributing to the decarbonization of industry alongside other technologies, such as electric arc furnaces for steelmaking. However, it is likely to play a larger role in providing industrial feedstock for cleaner production of ammonia and organic chemicals. For example, in steelmaking, hydrogen could function as a clean energy carrier and also as a low-carbon catalyst replacing coal-derived coke.

The imperative to use low-carbon hydrogen to reduce greenhouse gas emissions has the potential to reshape the geography of industrial activities, as locations with appropriate hydrogen production potential in different regions will interact in new ways with logistics infrastructure, raw material availability, human and technological capital.

=== Transport===
Much of the interest in the hydrogen economy concept is focused on hydrogen vehicles, particularly planes. Hydrogen vehicles produce significantly less local air pollution than conventional vehicles. By 2050, the energy requirement for transportation might be between 20% and 30% fulfilled by hydrogen and synthetic fuels.

Hydrogen used to decarbonize transportation is likely to find its largest applications in shipping, aviation and to a lesser extent heavy goods vehicles, through the use of hydrogen-derived synthetic fuels such as ammonia and methanol, and fuel cell technology. Hydrogen has been used in fuel cell buses for many years. It is also used as a fuel for spacecraft propulsion.

In the International Energy Agency&#x27;s 2022 Net Zero Emissions Scenario (NZE), hydrogen is forecast to account for 2% of rail energy demand in 2050, while 90% of rail travel is expected to be electrified by then (up from 45% today). Hydrogen&#x27;s role in rail would likely be focused on lines that prove difficult or costly to electrify. The NZE foresees hydrogen meeting approximately 30% of heavy truck energy demand in 2050, mainly for long-distance heavy freight (with battery electric power accounting for around 60%).

Although hydrogen can be used in adapted internal combustion engines, fuel cells, being electrochemical, have an efficiency advantage over heat engines. Fuel cells are more expensive to produce than common internal combustion engines but also require higher purity hydrogen fuel than internal combustion engines.

In the light road vehicle segment including passenger cars, by the end of 2022, 70,200 fuel cell electric vehicles had been sold worldwide, compared with 26 million plug-in electric vehicles. With the rapid rise of electric vehicles and associated battery technology and infrastructure, hydrogen&#x27;s role in cars is minuscule.

=== Energy system balancing and storage ===
Green hydrogen, from electrolysis of water, has the potential to address the variability of renewable energy output. Producing green hydrogen can both reduce the need for renewable power curtailment during periods of high renewables output and be stored long-term to provide for power generation during periods of low output.

===Ammonia ===
 
An alternative to gaseous hydrogen as an energy carrier is to bond it with nitrogen from the air to produce ammonia, which can be easily liquefied, transported, and used (directly or indirectly) as a clean and renewable fuel. Among disadvantages of ammonia as an energy carrier are its high toxicity, energy efficiency of production from and , and poisoning of PEM Fuel Cells by traces of non-decomposed after to conversion.

=== Buildings ===
Numerous industry groups (gas networks, gas boiler manufacturers) across the natural gas supply chain are promoting hydrogen combustion boilers for space and water heating, and hydrogen appliances for cooking, to reduce energy-related CO2 emissions from residential and commercial buildings. The proposition is that current end-users of piped natural gas can await the conversion of and supply of hydrogen to existing natural gas grids, and then swap heating and cooking appliances, and that there is no need for consumers to do anything now.

A review of 32 studies on the question of hydrogen for heating buildings, independent of commercial interests, found that the economics and climate benefits of hydrogen for heating and cooking generally compare very poorly with the deployment of district heating networks, electrification of heating (principally through heat pumps) and cooking, the use of solar thermal, waste heat and the installation of energy efficiency measures to reduce energy demand for heat. Due to inefficiencies in hydrogen production, using blue hydrogen to replace natural gas for heating could require three times as much methane, while using green hydrogen would need two to three times as much electricity as heat pumps. Hybrid heat pumps, which combine the use of an electric heat pump with a hydrogen boiler, may play a role in residential heating in areas where upgrading networks to meet peak electrical demand would otherwise be costly.

The widespread use of hydrogen for heating buildings would entail higher energy system costs, higher heating costs and higher environmental impacts than the alternatives, although a niche role may be appropriate in specific contexts and geographies. If deployed, using hydrogen in buildings would drive up the cost of hydrogen for harder-to-decarbonize applications in industry and transport.

===Bio-SNG===
 although technically possible production of syngas from hydrogen and carbon-dioxide from bio-energy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) via the Sabatier reaction is limited by the amount of sustainable bioenergy available: therefore any bio-SNG made may be reserved for production of aviation biofuel.

== Safety ==
In hydrogen pipelines and steel storage vessels, hydrogen molecules are prone to react with metals, causing hydrogen embrittlement and leaks in the pipeline or storage vessel. Since it is lighter than air, hydrogen does not easily accumulate to form a combustible gas mixture. However, even without ignition sources, high-pressure hydrogen leakage may cause spontaneous combustion and detonation. 

Hydrogen is flammable when mixed even in small amounts with air. Ignition can occur at a volumetric ratio of hydrogen to air as low as 4%. In approximately 70% of hydrogen ignition accidents, the ignition source cannot be found, and it is widely believed by scholars that spontaneous ignition of hydrogen occurs. 

Hydrogen fire, while being extremely hot, is almost invisible, and thus can lead to accidental burns. Hydrogen, like most gases, can cause asphyxiation in the absence of adequate ventilation.

== Hydrogen infrastructure ==
=== Storage ===
===Power plants===

Xcel Energy is going to build two combined cycle power plants in the Midwest that can mix 30% hydrogen with the natural gas. Intermountain Power Plant is being retrofitted to a natural gas/hydrogen power plant that can run on 30% hydrogen as well, and is scheduled to run on pure hydrogen by 2045.

== Costs ==

More widespread use of hydrogen in economies entails the need for investment and costs in its production, storage, distribution and use. Estimates of hydrogen&#x27;s cost are therefore complex and need to make assumptions about the cost of energy inputs (typically gas and electricity), production plant and method (e.g. green or blue hydrogen), technologies used (e.g. alkaline or proton exchange membrane electrolysers), storage and distribution methods, and how different cost elements might change over time. These factors are incorporated into calculations of the levelized costs of hydrogen (LCOH). The following table shows a range of estimates of the levelized costs of gray, blue, and green hydrogen, expressed in terms of US$ per kg of H2 (where data provided in other currencies or units, the average exchange rate to US dollars in the given year are used, and 1 kg of H2 is assumed to have a calorific value of 33.3kWh).

The range of cost estimates for commercially available hydrogen production methods is broad, As of 2022, gray hydrogen is cheapest to produce without a tax on its CO2 emissions, followed by blue and green hydrogen. Blue hydrogen production costs are not anticipated to fall substantially by 2050, can be expected to fluctuate with natural gas prices and could face carbon taxes for uncaptured emissions. The cost of electrolysers fell by 60% from 2010 to 2022, before rising slightly due to an increasing cost of capital. Their cost is projected to fall significantly to 2030 and 2050, driving down the cost of green hydrogen alongside the falling cost of renewable power generation. It is cheapest to produce green hydrogen with surplus renewable power that would otherwise be curtailed, which favors electrolyzers capable of responding to low and variable power levels.

A 2022 Goldman Sachs analysis anticipates that globally green hydrogen will achieve cost parity with grey hydrogen by 2030, earlier if a global carbon tax is placed on gray hydrogen. In terms of cost per unit of energy, blue and gray hydrogen will always cost more than the fossil fuels used in its production, while green hydrogen will always cost more than the renewable electricity used to make it.

Subsidies for clean hydrogen production are much higher in the US and EU than in India.

== Examples and pilot programs ==


The distribution of hydrogen for the purpose of transportation is being tested around the world, particularly in the US (California, Massachusetts), Canada, Japan, the EU (Portugal, Norway, the Netherlands, Denmark, Germany), and Iceland.

An indicator of the presence of large natural gas infrastructures already in place in countries and in use by citizens is the number of natural gas vehicles present in the country. The countries with the largest amount of natural gas vehicles are (in order of magnitude):
Iran, China, Pakistan, Argentina, India, Brazil, Italy, Colombia, Thailand, Uzbekistan, Bolivia, Armenia, Bangladesh, Egypt, Peru, Ukraine, the United States. Natural gas vehicles can also be converted to run on hydrogen.

Also, in a few private homes, fuel cell micro-CHP plants can be found, which can operate on hydrogen, or other fuels as natural gas or LPG.

=== Australia ===
Western Australia&#x27;s Department of Planning and Infrastructure operated three Daimler Chrysler Citaro fuel cell buses as part of its Sustainable Transport Energy for Perth Fuel Cells Bus Trial in Perth from 2004 to 2007.

By November 2020 the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) had invested $55 million in 28 hydrogen projects, from early stage research and development to early stage trials and deployments. The agency&#x27;s stated goal is to produce hydrogen by electrolysis for $2 per kilogram, announced by Minister for Energy and Emissions Angus Taylor in a 2021 Low Emissions Technology Statement. 

In October 2021, Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk and private investor Andrew Forrest announced that Queensland would be home to the world&#x27;s largest hydrogen plant.

In November 2024, the South Australian Government&#x27;s plan to spend A$593 million on a 200MW hydrogen energy plant near Whyalla was granted federal approval under the EPBC Act. The project is planned to be developed by the Office of Hydrogen Power SA, ATCO Australia, and BOC, and intended &quot;to supply additional grid stability for homes and businesses around the state, by using excess renewable energy generated from large-scale wind and solar farms to provide a consistent output of supply&quot;. Construction was scheduled to start in 2025, with completion and commissioning happening in 2026.

=== European Union ===
Countries in the EU which have a relatively large natural gas pipeline system already in place include Belgium, Germany, France, and the Netherlands. In 2020, The EU launched its European Clean Hydrogen Alliance (ECHA).

==== France ====
Green hydrogen has become more common in France. A €150 million Green Hydrogen Plan was established in 2019, and it calls for building the infrastructure necessary to create, store, and distribute hydrogen as well as using the fuel to power local transportation systems like buses and trains. Corridor H2, a similar initiative, will create a network of hydrogen distribution facilities in Occitania along the route between the Mediterranean and the North Sea. The Corridor H2 project will get a €40 million loan from the EIB.

==== Germany ====
German car manufacturer BMW has been working with hydrogen for years..
The German government has announced plans to hold tenders for 5.5 GW of new hydrogen-ready gas-fired power plants and 2 GW of &quot;comprehensive H2-ready modernisations&quot; of existing gas power stations at the end of 2024 or beginning of 2025

==== Iceland ====
Iceland has committed to becoming the world&#x27;s first hydrogen economy by the year 2050. Iceland is in a unique position. Presently, it imports all the petroleum products necessary to power its automobiles and fishing fleet. Iceland has large geothermal resources, so much that the local price of electricity actually is &quot;lower&quot; than the price of the hydrocarbons that could be used to produce that electricity.

Iceland already converts its surplus electricity into exportable goods and hydrocarbon replacements. In 2002, it produced 2,000 tons of hydrogen gas by electrolysis, primarily for the production of ammonia (NH3) for fertilizer. Ammonia is produced, transported, and used throughout the world, and 90% of the cost of ammonia is the cost of the energy to produce it.

Neither industry directly replaces hydrocarbons. Reykjavík, Iceland, had a small pilot fleet of city buses running on compressed hydrogen, and research on powering the nation&#x27;s fishing fleet with hydrogen is under way (for example by companies as Icelandic New Energy). For more practical purposes, Iceland might process imported oil with hydrogen to extend it, rather than to replace it altogether.

The Reykjavík buses are part of a larger program, HyFLEET:CUTE, operating hydrogen fueled buses in eight European cities. HyFLEET:CUTE buses were also operated in Beijing, China and Perth, Australia (see below). A pilot project demonstrating a hydrogen economy is operational on the Norwegian island of Utsira. The installation combines wind power and hydrogen power. In periods when there is surplus wind energy, the excess power is used for generating hydrogen by electrolysis. The hydrogen is stored, and is available for power generation in periods when there is little wind.

=== India ===
India is said to adopt hydrogen and H-CNG, due to several reasons, amongst which the fact that a national rollout of natural gas networks is already taking place and natural gas is already a major vehicle fuel. In addition, India suffers from extreme air pollution in urban areas. According to some estimates, nearly 80% of India&#x27;s hydrogen is projected to be green, driven by cost declines and new production technologies.
Currently however, hydrogen energy is just at the Research, Development and Demonstration (RD&amp;D) stage. As a result, the number of hydrogen stations may still be low, although much more are expected to be introduced soon.

=== Poland ===
It planning open first hydrogen publication stations, The Ministry of Climate and Environment (MKiŚ) will soon schan competitions for 2-3 hydrogen refueling stations, Polish Deputy Minister in this ministry Krzysztof Bolesta.

=== Saudi Arabia ===
Saudi Arabia as a part of the NEOM project, is looking to produce roughly 1.2 million tonnes of green ammonia a year, beginning production in 2025.

In Cairo, Egypt, Saudi real estate funding skyscraper project powered by hydrogen.

=== South Korea ===

The Ulsan Green Hydrogen Town is a hydrogen city project being developed in Ulsan. As of October 2024, 188km of underground pipelines have been laid to connect hydrogen produced as a byproduct from petrochemical complexes to the city center.

=== Turkey ===
The Turkish Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources and the United Nations Industrial Development Organization created the International Centre for Hydrogen Energy Technologies (UNIDO-ICHET) in Istanbul in 2004 and it ran to 2012. In 2023 the ministry published a Hydrogen Technologies Strategy and Roadmap.

=== United Kingdom ===
The UK started a fuel cell pilot program in January 2004, the program ran two Fuel cell buses on route 25 in London until December 2005, and switched to route RV1 until January 2007. The Hydrogen Expedition is currently working to create a hydrogen fuel cell-powered ship and using it to circumnavigate the globe, as a way to demonstrate the capability of hydrogen fuel cells. In August 2021 the UK Government claimed it was the first to have a Hydrogen Strategy and produced a document.

In August 2021, Chris Jackson quit as chair of the UK Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Association, a leading hydrogen industry association, claiming that UK and Norwegian oil companies had intentionally inflated their cost projections for blue hydrogen in order to maximize future technology support payments by the UK government.

=== United States ===

Several domestic U.S. automobile companies have developed vehicles using hydrogen, such as GM and Toyota. However, as of February 2020, infrastructure for hydrogen was underdeveloped except in some parts of California. The United States have their own hydrogen policy. A joint venture between NREL and Xcel Energy is combining wind power and hydrogen power in the same way in Colorado. Hydro in Newfoundland and Labrador are converting the current wind-diesel Power System on the remote island of Ramea into a Wind-Hydrogen Hybrid Power Systems facility. Five pump station hubs being delivered to heavy-duty H2 trucks in Texas. Hydrogen City built Green by Hydrogen International (GHI), to planning open in 2026.

In 2006, Florida’s infrastructure project was commissioned. First opened Orlando as public bus transportation, Ford Motor Company announced putting a fleet of hydrogen-fueled Ford E-450. Liquidated hydrogen mobile system was constructed at Titusville. An FPL’s pilot clean hydrogen facility operated in Okeechobee County.

A similar pilot project on Stuart Island uses solar power, instead of wind power, to generate electricity. When excess electricity is available after the batteries are fully charged, hydrogen is generated by electrolysis and stored for later production of electricity by fuel cell. The US also have a large natural gas pipeline system already in place.

=== Vietnam ===
Việt Nam Energy Association have included green hydrogenation support. Australian clean energy company Pure Hydrogen Corporation Limited announced on July 22 that it has signed an MoU with Vietnam public transportation.

<text>The Gyeongjeon Line () is a railway line serving South Gyeongsang and South Jeolla Provinces in South Korea. It covers a total of 300.6 km, from Samnangjin Station in Miryang, South Gyeongsang, to Gwangju Songjeong Station in Gwangju, South Jeolla.

==History==

An east-west railway along Korea&#x27;s southern shore was long seen as a strategic route, but it took a number of attempts to complete the line. The first section of the line was opened as a branch from the newly built Gyeongbu Line at Samnangjin to Masan in May 1905, which was named the Masan Line. On December 1, 1923, the Jinju Line opened from Masan to Jinju, extending the line to . A branch from Changwon on the Masan Line to Jinhae, the Jinhae Line, opened on November 11, 1926.

Meanwhile, construction started in the opposite direction from Songjeong-ri (today Gwangju·Songjeong) on the Honam Line, the other end of the future Gyeongjeon Line, with the first to Gwangju opened in July 1922. The Gwangju Line was completed to Yeosu on December 25, 1930. Six years later, on December 16, 1936, the Suncheon–Yeosu section became part of the newly established Jeolla Line, leaving the long Songjeong-ri–Suncheon section as the Gwangju Line.

Following the 1961 coup, the Supreme Council for National Reconstruction started South Korea&#x27;s first five-year plan, which included a construction program to complete the railway network, to foster economic growth. As part of the program, work began on a line to plug the gap between Jinju and Suncheon on April 28, 1962. The difficult long section included 38 bridges with a total length of and 27 tunnels with a total length of , as well as 13 new stations. The Jinju–Suncheon line opened on February 7, 1968, when the whole railway line from Samnangjin to Songjeong-ri was renamed the Gyeongjeon Line. By the mid-2000s, alignment modifications shortened the line length to .

===Upgrade===

The line is being upgraded to an electrified and double-tracked line for higher speeds in stages, to facilitate regional development. On September 1, 2010, the South Korean government announced a strategic plan to reduce travel times from Seoul to 95% of the country to under 2 hours by 2020. As part of the plan, the entire Gyeongjeon Line was to be further upgraded for 230 km/h.

====Samnangjin-Masan-Jinju====

The upgraded section is 101.4 km long. The 41 km section until Masan includes a re-alignment with tunnels closer to Changwon, the Masan–Jinju section also includes significant re-alignments along the way.

The project was implemented as a public-private partnership: the government contribution is 1,680.473 billion won, private capital contributes 338.309 billion won. By April 2009, construction progress reached 50.9% of the planned budget of 2,018.782 billion won. The Samnangjin-Masan section opened on December 15, 2010, the Masan–Jinju section followed on October 23, 2012. The design speed of this section is 200 km/h.

====Jinju-Suncheon====

Work started in 2003 on a 56.1 km long section between Jinju and Gwangyang. By March 2010, progress was 19% out of a budget of 1,005.984 billion won. This section includes significant re-alignments with longer tunnels and bridges. The upgrade works also commenced at the junction with the Jeolla Line east of Suncheon, this section opened on September 30, 2015. The first track of the realigned Jinju-Gwangjang section opened on April 29, 2016, followed by the second track on July 14, 2016. Electrification was put in operation on June 23, 2023. The design speed of this section is 150 km/h.

====Suncheon-GwangjuSongjeong====

Between Hyocheon and GwangjuSongjeong, to relieve congestion at road crossings in the city, the Gyeongjeon Line got a new alignment bypassing Gwangju to the south. The section of the old alignment between GwangjuSongjeong and Gwangju was upgraded as a spur line, again called the Gwangju Line, while the section between Hyocheon and Gwangju, including Namgwangju Station, was torn up. The realignments opened on August 10, 2000.

The rest of the Suncheon-Gwangju section is foreseen for upgrading in a new 230 km/h alignment under the government&#x27;s 2010 plan for 2020. A decade later, only plans for single-track electrification were drawn up.

====Connected projects====

A new long branch from Hallimjeong Station was projected to improve freight transport connections to Busan&#x27;s expanded port. The line proper to Busan New Port Station is long, followed by of port access tracks. Part of the alignment became part of the Gyeongjeon Line realignment, shortening the branch and changing the starting point to Jillye. By April 2009, progress was 80.7% out of a total budget of 902.384 billion won. The line was opened on November 30, 2010 and the first freight train travelled the line on December 13, 2010. On January 1 and 31, 2013, two single-track non-electrified branches opened: the New Port South Line to Namcheol Songjiang and the New Port North Line to Bukcheolsong.

A new direct connection from Busan will meet up with the realigned Gyeongjeon Line southwest of Jillye, with a connection to the Busan New Port Line at Jangyu Station. The 32.6 km long double-track cutoff had a budget of 1,396.15 billion won, and was implemented with private finance, the preferred bidder for the franchise was selected in July 2010. This line was foreseen for an upgrade to 230 km/h under the government&#x27;s 2010 plan for 2020. Construction started in 2014, after design changes and construction problems, opening is scheduled for the first half of 2025.

From Boseong, a new cutoff branch is to connect with the Honam Line at Imseong-ri, just before Mokpo. Construction of the 79.5 km long aingle-track branch commenced in 2002, however, work was suspended in 2007 for lack of funds, after having progressed to 5.5% of the 1,297.924 billion won budget. Construction resumed in 2015, plans were upgraded with the addition of electrification and a top speed of 200 km/h in 2019, with opening scheduled for December 2024. This branch includes the 5,960 m long Jangdong Tunnel northeast of Jangheung.

<doc id="906169" wikidata="Q6307149" url="?curid=906169" title="Julian Fantino">
<text>Julian Fantino, , (; born August 13, 1942) is a Canadian retired police official and former politician. He was the Conservative Party of Canada Member of the Parliament of Canada for the riding of Vaughan following a November 29, 2010 by-election, until his defeat in 2015. On January 4, 2011, Fantino was named Minister of State for Seniors; on May 18, 2011, he became Associate Minister of National Defence; on July 4, 2012, he was named Minister for International Cooperation. Fantino served as the Minister of Veterans Affairs from 2013 until 2015, when he was demoted to his earlier post of Associate Minister of National Defence following sustained criticism of his performance at Veterans Affairs. He was defeated by Liberal candidate Francesco Sorbara in the 2015 election.

Prior to entering politics, Fantino was the Commissioner of the Ontario Provincial Police from 2006 to 2010, Toronto Chief of Police from 2000 to 2005, and Ontario&#x27;s Commissioner of Emergency Management from 2005 until 2006, and also served as chief of police of London, Ontario, from 1991 to 1998, and of York Region from 1998 until 2000. Prior to his London appointment, he had been a Toronto police officer since 1969.

==Early life==
Fantino was born in Vendoglio, Italy in 1942, and immigrated to Canada with his family when he was 11 years old.

==Early Toronto career==
Before joining the Metro Toronto Police, Fantino was a security guard at Yorkdale Shopping Centre in suburban Toronto. He volunteered as an Auxiliary Police Officer for the Metro Toronto Police from 1964 to 1969 and then joined the force as a Police Constable. He was a member of the Drug Squad and was promoted to Detective Constable. He subsequently served with Criminal Intelligence and then the Homicide Squad before being promoted to Divisional Commander and then Acting Staff Superintendent of Detectives.

===Wiretap controversy===
According to an internal police report leaked in 2007, Fantino, as superintendent of detectives in 1991, had ordered a wiretap of lawyer Peter Maloney a police critic and friend of Susan Eng, chair of the Toronto Police Services Board, the body overseeing the Toronto Police service. Conversations between Maloney and Eng were illegally recorded despite a court order that only the first minute of Maloney&#x27;s conversations were to be monitored so as to determine whether the individual who he was talking to was on the list of those being investigated.

===Departure===
After 23 years of service with the Metro Toronto Police, Fantino left to accept an appointment as police chief of London, Ontario, in 1991.

==London Police Service chief (1991-1998)==
In London, he presided over the highly publicized and controversial &quot;Project Guardian&quot;, in which over two dozen gay men were arrested for involvement in a purported child pornography ring. While several men were eventually convicted of crimes not related to the stated purpose of the investigation, such as drug possession and prostitution, no child pornography ring was ever found.

Journalist Gerald Hannon later published a piece in &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; accusing Fantino of mounting an anti-gay witch hunt. In response, Fantino filed a complaint with the Ontario Press Council, which ultimately ruled that the &quot;Globe&quot; should have more clearly labelled Hannon&#x27;s article as an opinion piece. John Greyson&#x27;s CBC documentary &quot;After the Bath&quot; (1996) also covers the Project Guardian scandal in detail and makes similar conclusions as Hannon.

Fantino says that he is &quot;not anti-gay or homophobic&quot; and was simply arresting lawbreakers engaging in &quot;a sick, perverted crime&quot;.

==York Regional Police chief (1998–2000)==
Fantino returned to the Greater Toronto Area as Chief of York Regional Police in 1998. His tenure was brief and he returned to the Toronto Police Service two years later. He was succeeded as chief by Robert Middaugh.

==Toronto Police Service chief (2000–2005)==

===Policing controversies===
An incident in September 2000 involving five male police officers entering a woman&#x27;s bath house sparked public outrage and drew attention to TPS&#x27;s poor standing in the gay community. In 2004, Fantino made an attempt to repair relations, primarily by appearing on the cover of &quot;fab&quot; in a photo which featured him posing in his police uniform with five other models dressed as the Village People standing behind him.

Fantino appeared to have little patience for protesters: he wanted them to ask police for permission before holding demonstrations. In one report, he commented &quot;a problem is now arising where portions of the public believe that Dundas Square is a public space.&quot; In his new position with the OPP, Fantino took an aggressive posture with a native protest blocking a major highway: he stated he &quot;would not/could not tolerate the 401 being closed all day.&quot; However, the commander on site decided against a raid as &quot;[he was] not about to put people at risk for a piece of pavement.&quot;

In 2003, Fantino criticized the effectiveness of the Canadian gun registry.

Also in 2003, Fantino publicly named and identified several people as being under investigation for child pornography. Despite the lack of evidence, and the crown subsequently dropping the charges, at least one of the men publicly identified committed suicide, naming Fantino&#x27;s intentional destruction of his reputation as the reason for his suicide in the suicide note.
===Corruption scandals===
Fantino came under increasing scrutiny due to three corruption scandals which broke out during his tenure and his handling of those incidents. Fantino was accused of having tried to deal with these cases out of public view and attempting to shield them from investigation by outside police services.

In one case, drug squad officers are alleged to have beaten and robbed suspected drug dealers. In another, plainclothes officers were charged with accepting bribes to help bars dodge liquor inspections. In the third, a group of officers who advocated on behalf of a drug-addicted car thief faced internal charges.

Two of these cases involve the sons of former police chief William McCormack, and came to light not as a result of investigations by Toronto police, but due to a Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) investigation into gangster activity which inadvertently uncovered evidence of wrongdoing by Toronto police officers. Mike McCormack was later cleared of all wrongdoing due to a lack of evidence.

In December 2009, Fantino was accused during a related court case of having &quot;unplugged&quot; a special task force investigating corruption charges against the Toronto Police Service&#x27;s narcotics squad, thereby ignoring the task force&#x27;s suspicions that another of the force&#x27;s drug squads was corrupt. Lawyer Julian Falconer argued in court that &quot;When Chief Fantino declared there were only a few bad apples, he did not deliver the straight goods,&quot; and shut down the investigation before it expanded as part of a damage-control campaign.

In March 2005, the CBC announced that they had obtained documents via the &quot;Access to Information Act&quot; showing that between 1998 and 2005 Toronto had spent $30,633,303.63 settling lawsuits against police. Norm Gardner said the settlement costs, which amount to about $5 million a year over six years, were expected, given the number of confrontations police face, suggesting that &quot;people think they are going to get paid off.&quot;

==Contract expiry==
Fantino&#x27;s contract as police chief expired on February 28, 2005. On June 24, 2004, the police services board announced that it would not be reappointing Fantino due to a 2–2 tie. This was controversial since chair Norm Gardner had been suspended from the five-man board due to a conflict of interest ruling, but as he refused to vacate his seat the three required votes for renewal were far more difficult to obtain. Conservative politicians on Toronto City Council responded with a &quot;Save Fantino&quot; campaign, and the board was deadlocked on the issue of beginning the search for Fantino&#x27;s replacement.

Many Fantino supporters claimed that the Mayor at the time, David Miller, was openly hostile to Fantino. Miller had ignored calls to pressure the police board after it voted against Fantino&#x27;s renewal, yet Miller subsequently contacted the board looking for a role in hiring the next police chief, although the latter request was not granted.

Former deputy police chief Mike Boyd took over as interim chief of police on March 1, 2005. On April 6, another former deputy chief, Bill Blair, was named Fantino&#x27;s permanent successor.

==Commissioner of Emergency Management (2005–2006)==
On February 8, 2005, Fantino was appointed Ontario&#x27;s commissioner of emergency management by Ontario premier Dalton McGuinty. This move was criticized by the opposition parties in the Legislative Assembly of Ontario, both for the lack of transparency in the hiring process and for the perception that the appointment was primarily motivated by the desire to avoid having Fantino run as a Progressive Conservative candidate in the 2007 provincial election against Finance Minister Greg Sorbara. However, Sorbara had also blamed Miller for failing to renew Fantino&#x27;s contract, so this appointment could have also been seen as the Ontario Liberals&#x27; show of support for Fantino.

==Ontario Provincial Police commissioner (2006-2010)==
Fantino was appointed Commissioner of the Ontario Provincial Police replacing the departed Gwen M. Boniface on October 12, 2006, by the provincial Liberal government; initially for a two-year term. His appointment was criticized by First Nations groups. In March 2008 his contract was extended until October 2009. In June 2009 his contract was further extended until July 2010 so that he could oversee the province&#x27;s security contingent at the 2010 G8 Summit in Huntsville, Ontario.

He received much public attention over highly publicized child pornography busts, with 21 men arrested in February 2008 and 31 men (some as young as 14) arrested in February 2009. None of the cases has come to trial to date. During his term, Fantino has changed the look of the OPP by ordering that the livery for police cruisers be changed to a 1960s era black and white pattern.

Commissioner Fantino&#x27;s salary, for 2009, was $251,989.44.

===Shawn Brant controversy===
Fantino was criticized by lawyer Peter Rosenthal during the trial of aboriginal activist Shawn Brant. Fantino was criticized for ordering wiretaps of Brant&#x27;s phone without proper authority and for making provocative comments to Brant during negotiations to end a blockade of the rail line west of Kingston. By way of those illegal wiretaps, Fantino was recorded saying to Brant &quot;You are going to force me to do everything I can; within your community and everywhere else; to destroy your reputation&quot; and &quot;your whole world is going to come crashing down&quot; NDP MPP Peter Kormos called for Fantino&#x27;s resignation accusing him of using &quot;pugnacious and bellicose&quot; rhetoric and for engaging in &quot;Rambo-style policing.&quot; In the face of defence motions for the police to disclose more evidence about their conduct the Crown agreed to drop the most serious charges against Brant in exchange for a plea bargain resulting in a light sentence. Fantino was also criticized for his role in the Caledonia land dispute after he was accused of sending e-mails to local politicians accusing them of encouraging anti-police rallies by non-Natives.

===Internal discipline hearing controversy===
In late 2008 and early 2009, Fantino was embroiled in a controversy surrounding his role in an internal discipline case at the OPP, in which Fantino was accused of being petty and vindictive in his actions against the officers. Fantino ordered a hearing into the matter but attempted to remove the adjudicator he had appointed on the grounds that the judge was biased against the commissioner due to critical comments he made during testimony by Fantino. Divisional Court rejected Fantino&#x27;s request. The Ontario Court of Appeal upheld the lower court decision saying an informed person viewing the matter realistically and practically would not conclude there was any apprehension of bias on the part of the adjudicator. The OPP dropped the disciplinary case against the two officers on December 15, 2009, the same day Fantino was due to be cross examined by defence lawyer Julian Falconer. The entire process cost more than $500,000 in public money.

===Private prosecution charge for influencing or attempting to influence an elected official===
Fantino was summoned in early January 2010 to face a charge of influencing or attempting to influence an elected official in April 2007 in Haldimand County, Ontario. The summons came after a December 31 Ontario Superior Court order demanding a formal charge be laid in relation to allegations against Mr. Fantino brought forward by a private complainant, Gary McHale, who alleged that Fantino was illegally influencing or attempting to influence municipal officials in regards to the Caledonia land dispute. The charge against Fantino was stayed in February 2010 as the Crown said there was no reasonable prospect of conviction.

===$90,000,000 conspiracy lawsuit===
On February 4, 2011, Gerald Guy Brummell of Trenton, Ontario filed a $90,000,000 lawsuit against 36 OPP officers, including Julian Fantino, in the Superior Court of Justice in Cobourg Ontario (File 11/11) alleging a conspiracy and coverup relating to the inappropriate use of the judicial system as a tool of revenge against Brummell and his family for complaining about a death threat by one of their officers. In early 2014 Superior Court Justice H.K. O’Connell sided with the government that the claim of malicious prosecution was not supported by evidence. Brummell has appealed this decision to the Court of Appeal for Ontario. On his web site, Brummell alleged that Fantino was an accessory to the murders of Jessica Lloyd and Marie France Comeau, and claimed OPP were knowledgeable of the earlier crimes of Colonel Russell Williams prior to his murders. The Crown settled the lawsuits brought against them by Williams victims, Larry and Bonnie Jones and Massicotte.

==Political aspirations==
Following the resignation of John Tory as leader of the Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario Fantino&#x27;s name was floated as a possible candidate in the ensuing leadership election. He ended speculation that he was interested in the job with a letter to the &quot;Globe and Mail&quot;.

There were rumours that he may run for Mayor of Vaughan, Ontario, in the October 25, 2010 municipal election following his retirement from the OPP. An April 2010, &quot;Toronto Star&quot;-Angus Reid poll indicates that Fantino would have the support of 43% of voters leading incumbent Mayor Linda Jackson who has 22% support. In an interview with CFRB on July 9, 2010, Fantino announced that he would not be running for mayor of Vaughan.

==Federal politics==
On October 12, 2010, Fantino announced he would seek the nomination for the federal Conservative Party in the riding of Vaughan. It had been reported Prime Minister Stephen Harper had spoken to Fantino in early October about running as a Conservative and that Fantino was &quot;leaning&quot; toward doing so. A federal by-election had been made necessary after the resignation of Liberal MP Maurizio Bevilacqua.

Fantino was acclaimed as Conservative Party&#x27;s candidate on October 14 and the by-election was called for November 29, 2010. During the campaign, he was dogged by a group called &quot;Conservatives Against Fantino&quot; led by Gary McHale and Mark Vandermaas, two activists critical of Fantino&#x27;s role in the Caledonia controversy. The group picketed Fantino&#x27;s campaign office and events, and became registered as a third party with Elections Canada under the name &quot;Against Fantino&quot; (after their use of the term &quot;Conservatives&quot; had been disallowed by the agency) in order to be permitted to spend money on printing and distributing 60,000 anti-Fantino pamphlets.

Fantino was elected to the House of Commons of Canada on November 29, 2010, by narrowly defeating Liberal candidate Tony Genco. &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; noted that Fantino had &quot;beat the Liberals out of one of their safest seats in Ontario, one they had held for 22 years.&quot;

On January 4, 2011, Fantino was named as Minister of State for Seniors. In Prime Minister Harper&#x27;s cabinet shuffle following the 2011 federal election Fantino was promoted to Associate Minister of National Defence.

Following the departure of Bev Oda, Harper named Fantino the new Minister for International Cooperation portfolio on July 4, 2012, replacing him at National Defence with Bernard Valcourt.

On July 15, 2013, Fantino was shuffled to the position of Minister of Veterans&#x27; Affairs. Several months later, the veterans ombudsman reported that the government provides veterans with insufficient compensation for pain and suffering and criticized the government, saying that some would be near poverty because of cuts to pensions and benefits. In the same year, the department announced the closure of eight local offices servicing veterans. In January 2014, Fantino arrived late for a meeting with veterans about the closures and engaged in an angry confrontation with one of the veterans, resulting in accusations that Fantino was inept, rude and insensitive. In May, he was filmed ignoring and walking away from the angry wife of a veteran as she asked questions of him. Fantino was criticized for his department&#x27;s difficulties in delivering help and benefits to veterans and for spending $4 million on advertising to explain the government&#x27;s position while allowing more than $1 billion allocated for benefits to lapse. On January 5, 2015, after months of controversy, Fantino was replaced by Erin O&#x27;Toole and demoted to the position of Associate Defence Minister.

In the 2015 Canadian federal election, Fantino was defeated by Liberal candidate, Francesco Sorbara in the redistributed electoral district of Vaughan-Woodbridge.

==Assault charge==
On October 1, 2015, a retired construction worker, John Bonnici, pressed charges against Fantino over an alleged incident on August 31, 1973, in which Bonnici claimed that Fantino poured ketchup down his (Bonnici&#x27;s) buttocks and spread the condiment by stroking the outside of his pants with a baton. Fantino, who was seeking re-election to the House of Commons in the 2015 Canadian federal election, was charged with &quot;assault with a weapon&quot; — a police baton — and &quot;assault causing bodily harm&quot; against John Bonnici. The Crown dismissed the charge in December 2015 arguing that there was no reasonable prospect of conviction.

== Post-political life ==

=== Cannabis industry ===
In September 2017, Julian Fantino announced that he was working with Aleafia, a Concord Ontario-based company that is involved in the use of medical marijuana, one of the many start-ups capitalizing on Canada&#x27;s then-upcoming legalization of cannabis. On October 31, 2017, Fantino was announced as Executive Chairman of Aleafia. In several news interviews, he explained how his attitude to the drug changed during his time as Veterans Affairs Minister when he saw the benefits of pot in assisting soldiers to deal with anxiety, sleep disorders and PTSD. Fantino, who had been the board&#x27;s chair, resigned from the board effective May 15, 2020. He had been criticized for his involvement due to his longtime opposition to cannabis and having once compared legalizing the substance to legalizing murder. Fantino was also involved in a retail recreational cannabis store which opened in Toronto&#x27;s Kensington Market in 2020.

=== Donald Best ===
On September 28, 2017, Julian Fantino swore an affidavit in support of his application to intervene in the judicial review of a decision by the Canadian Judicial Council in respect of a complaint by former Toronto Police officer Donald Best against Ontario Superior Court Justice J. Bryan Shaughnessy. Fantino&#x27;s &quot;extensive&quot; 33 page plus 100 exhibits affidavit stated that Best was convicted &quot;upon the presentation by lawyers of provably false evidence.&quot; and that that &quot;disturbing&quot; evidence suggests police resources and personnel were &quot;improperly retained, used and co-opted&quot; to help one side in the private civil dispute at the time that Fantino was Commissioner of the Ontario Provincial Police (but without his knowledge). Fantino further posited in the affidavit that there was a conspiracy involving secret backroom dealings by a judge and the police.

Mr. Fantino&#x27;s application to intervene in the Donald Best matter was heard on October 11, 2017, before a Federal Court of Canada prothonotary. The court refused Fantino&#x27;s application, but he subsequently filed an appeal of this decision which was to be heard on November 20, 2017 but was not heard by the court at that time. As of January 22, 2018, the legal case continues.

<text>Dentist on the Job (U.S. title Get On with It!) is a 1961 British comedy film directed by C. M. Pennington-Richards, and starring Bob Monkhouse, Kenneth Connor, Ronnie Stevens and Eric Barker It is the sequel to &quot;Dentist in the Chair&quot; (1960), and was co-written by Hugh Woodhouse and Hazel Adair.

==Plot==
Colonel Proudfoot of Proudfoot Industries aims to entice a couple of dentists to advertise &quot;Dreem&quot;, a revolutionary type of toothpaste, but he knows that if the dentists learn that they are part of an advertising campaign, they will be struck off. His cousin, the director of a Dental School, sees his chance to rid the field of dentistry of two newly qualified incompetents David Cookson and Brian Dexter. However, once employed by Proudfoot, they set about improving on Dreem&#x27;s terrible formula, and accidentally succeed in creating a much better toothpaste. Their attempts to convince Proudfoot of its merits are foiled by Proudfoot&#x27;s assistant, Macreedy.

They then read a newspaper article about the forthcoming launch of a rocket from a British base carrying a satellite which will continuously broadcast a taped message of peace from the President of the United States, and conceive a plan. They record an impromptu commercial for the new formula Dreem and, with the help of an ex-convict friend Sam Field and actress Jill Venner, manage to smuggle it aboard the rocket in place of the President&#x27;s speech, guaranteeing Proudfoot years of free advertising. The resulting publicity ensures the product&#x27;s success and the pair are promoted.

==Cast==
* Bob Monkhouse as David Cookson
* Kenneth Connor as Sam Field
* Ronnie Stevens as Brian Dexter
* Shirley Eaton as Jill Venner
* Eric Barker as Colonel J.J. Proudfoot / The Dean
* Reginald Beckwith as Mr. Duff
* Richard Wattis as Macreedy
* Charles Hawtrey as Mr. Roper
* Richard Caldicot as Prison Governor
* Cyril Chamberlain as Director
* David Horne as Admiral Southbound
* Graham Stark as sourfaced man
* Charlotte Mitchell as Mrs Burke
* Arthur Mullard (uncredited)
* Andria Lawrence (uncredited)

==Critical reception==
&quot;The Monthly Film Bulletin&quot; wrote: &quot;Witless farce, with seaside-postcard jokes and characters (Sour-Faced Man, Cheeky Brunette, Miss Figg, etc.) and an almost pre-adolescent prurience. A few sequences score hits at the expense of commercials and advertising, but they are obvious hits at obvious targets. The film moves at a fair pace, except when a laugh line is being heavily underlined; but its nonsense is for the most part dispiriting.&quot;

&quot;The Radio Times Guide to Films&quot; gave the film 2/5 stars, writing: &quot;A year after cutting his teeth on &quot;Dentist in the Chair&quot;, Bob Monkhouse returned in this disappointing sequel with a script that&#x27;s so full of cavities you&#x27;ll soon be wincing with pain and crying out for laughing gas. Newly qualified Monkhouse beams his way through a series of gags that could easily have been extracted from the &quot;Doctor in the House&quot; [1954] reject file.&quot;

==Legacy==
The BBFC censor card, studio logos, opening credits and a brief portion of the opening scene are added to the start of &quot;Monty Python and the Holy Grail&quot; (1975) on its special edition DVD. The clip ends with a spluttering, unseen &quot;projectionist&quot; realising he has played the wrong film. A &quot;slide&quot; then appears urging the audience to wait while the operator changes reels.

<doc id="906175" wikidata="Q135149" url="?curid=906175" title="Harmala alkaloid">
<text>Harmala alkaloids are several alkaloids that act as monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs). These alkaloids are found in the seeds of &quot;Peganum harmala&quot; (also known as harmal or Syrian rue), as well as &quot;Banisteriopsis caapi&quot; (ayahuasca), leaves of tobacco and coffee beans. The alkaloids include harmine, harmaline, harmalol, and their derivatives, which have similar chemical structures, hence the name &quot;harmala alkaloids&quot;. These alkaloids are of interest for their use in Amazonian shamanism, where they are derived from other plants. Harmine, once known as telepathine and banisterine, is a naturally occurring beta-carboline alkaloid that is structurally related to harmaline, and also found in the vine &quot;Banisteriopsis caapi&quot;. Tetrahydroharmine is also found in &quot;B. caapi&quot; and &quot;P. harmala&quot;. Dr. Alexander Shulgin has suggested that harmine may be a breakdown product of harmaline. Harmine and harmaline are reversible inhibitors of monoamine oxidase A (RIMAs). They can stimulate the central nervous system by inhibiting the metabolism of monoamine compounds such as serotonin and norepinephrine.

The harmala alkaloids occur in &quot;Peganum harmala&quot; in concentrations of roughly 3%, though tests have documented anywhere from 2–7% or even higher, as natural sources tend to vary widely in chemical makeup. Harmala alkaloids are also found in the &quot;Banisteriopsis caapi&quot; vine, the key plant ingredient in the sacramental beverage ayahuasca, in concentrations that range between 0.31 and 8.43% for harmine, 0.03–0.83% for harmaline and 0.05–2.94% for tetrahydroharmine. Although other psychoactive plants are occasionally added to ayahuasca to achieve visionary states of consciousness, the recipes vary greatly and no single combination is common. &quot;Peganum harmala&quot;, normally consumed as a tea or used as an incense, is mentioned in classical Persian literature both as a sacred sacrament and as a medicine. The harmala alkaloids are not especially psychedelic, even at higher dosages, when hypnagogic visions, alongside vomiting and diarrhea, become the main effect.

Harmala alkaloids are also found in many other plants, such as &quot;Passiflora&quot;. The leaves of &quot;P. incarnata&quot; have been reported variously to give 0.005%, 0.12%, and 0% harmala alkaloids.

== Telepathine ==
Telepathine was originally thought to be the active chemical constituent of &quot;Banisteriopsis caapi&quot;, a key plant ingredient in the preparation of ayahuasca; a sacramental beverage from the Amazon. This isolated chemical was so named because of the reported effects of ayahuasca among the indigenous users, including: collective contact with and/or visions of jaguars, snakes, and jeweled birds, and ancestral spirits; the ability to see future events; and as the name suggests, telepathic communication among tribal members. It was assumed to be a newly discovered chemical at the time, however, it was soon realized that telepathine was already more widely known as &quot;harmine&quot; from its previous discovery in &quot;Peganum harmala&quot; (Syrian rue).

== Uses ==
As mentioned above, some harmala alkaloids can be used as a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) to facilitate the ingestion of dimethyltryptamine (DMT) and other tryptamines; while not generally used as a hallucinogen alone, there are reports of such use. In high doses, it acts as purgative. Harmala alkaloids from &quot;Banisteriopsis caapi&quot; have been used to treat Parkinson&#x27;s disease. As a benzodiazepine site inverse agonist, harmala alkaloids are used as a model for essential tremor (ET) when injected to animals. Rats being treated with harmaline exhibit severe tremors after 5–7 minutes. Individuals diagnosed with essential tremor have been found to have elevated blood levels of harmala alkaloids.

Harmala alkaloids interact with smoked cannabis when either smoked/vaporized, or taken orally as an extract or as a tea. Reports are scarce, but generally users experience more intense cannabis-like effects, as well as mild psychedelic effects such as hallucinations, ego dissolution, and increased emotions, especially in large doses. 

Unlike MAOIs such as phenelzine, harmine and harmaline are reversible and selective meaning they do not have nearly as high a risk for &quot;cheese syndrome&quot; caused by consuming tyramine-containing foods, which is a risk associated with monoamine oxidase A inhibitors, but not monoamine oxidase B inhibitors. Both MAO-A and MAO-B break down tyramine, but large doses of harmala alkaloids begin to affect MAO-B as well.

Isolated harmine was found to exhibit a cytotoxic effect on HL60 and K562 leukemic cell lines. This action might explain the previously observed cytotoxic effect of &quot;P. harmala&quot; on these cancer cells.&quot;

==Legal status==

===Australia===
Harmala alkaloids are considered Schedule 9 prohibited substances under the Poisons Standard (October 2015). A Schedule 9 substance is a substance which may be abused or misused, the manufacture, possession, sale or use of which should be prohibited by law except when required for medical or scientific research, or for analytical, teaching or training purposes with approval of Commonwealth and/or State or Territory Health Authorities.

Exceptions are made when in herbs, or preparations, for therapeutic use such as: (a) containing 0.1 per cent or less of harmala alkaloids; or (b) in divided preparations containing 2 mg or less of harmala alkaloids per recommended daily dose.

<doc id="906181" wikidata="Q1089371" url="?curid=906181" title="Hang Jebat">
<text>Hang Jebat (Jawi: ; born ) was the closest companion of the legendary Malaccan hero Hang Tuah. Regarded in Malaysia as one of the greatest silat exponents in history, he is well known for his vengeful rebellion against the Malacca Sultan and final duel with Hang Tuah, who he swore to avenge after he was wrongfully punished by the Sultan. Juxtaposed with Tuah&#x27;s undying loyalty to the sultanate, Jebat is most remembered for his fierce defiance against unjust authority.

==Biography==
After Hang Tuah was sentenced to death, Hang Jebat was conferred the coveted Taming Sari kris, a weapon formerly used by Hang Tuah. Believing that Hang Tuah was unjustly murdered by the sultan he served, Hang Jebat turned against the ruler to avenge his friend&#x27;s death. No one knew that the &quot;bendahara&quot; (chief minister) went against the royal decree and hid Hang Tuah in a remote area.

With the kris in his possession, Hang Jebat was undefeatable and there was not one person in the palace who was capable of killing him. Hang Jebat&#x27;s revenge allegedly became a palace killing spree or furious rebellion against the sultan (sources differ as to what actually occurred). It remains consistent, however, that Hang Jebat wreaked havoc onto the royal court, and the sultan was unable to stop him, as none of the warriors dared to challenge the more ferocious and skilled Hang Jebat.

After learning from the bendahara that Hang Tuah was still alive, the sultan had him recall the warrior and gave him full amnesty. The sultan then ordered Hang Tuah to kill Hang Jebat. Being unquestionably loyal to the ruler, Hang Tuah obeyed the sultan&#x27;s bidding and went on to challenge Hang Jebat. After fighting in a battle that lasted for seven days, Hang Tuah eventually managed to reclaim the Taming Sari by tricking Hang Jebat. Although stabbed by Tuah, Hang Jebat bandaged his wounds and ran amok in the city square for three days, killing thousands of people before retreating to Tuah&#x27;s house and dying in his friend&#x27;s arms.

Hang Jebat&#x27;s famous quote during the fight was &quot;Raja adil raja disembah, raja zalim raja disanggah&quot; meaning &quot;A fair king is a king saluted, a tyrant king is a king disputed.&quot; This went against Tuah&#x27;s philosophy of loyalty without question.

After the fight, the sultan ordered his men to tear down, burn and throw the ashes of the house into the sea. Two months later, when a lady of the bendahara&#x27;s retinue, Dang Wangi gave birth to Jebat&#x27;s son, the sultan ordered Hang Tuah to throw the baby into the sea as well. Instead, the laksamana entrusted the child, Hang Nadim, to the bendahara. The child was then taken to Singapura where he was raised.

==Namesakes==

KD &quot;Jebat&quot; (FFG29), a &quot;Lekiu&quot;-class frigate in the Royal Malaysian Navy, is named after him. The decommissioned frigate KD &quot;Rahmat&quot; was to be called KD &quot;Hang Jebat&quot;, but engine problems during building trials caused the navy to change her name to &quot;Rahmat&quot;. One of the oldest engines that pulls the trains along the Singapore-Malaysia rail route is also named after him.

In Singapore, there exists a minor road off Portsdown Avenue named &quot;Jalan Hang Jebat&quot; and a namesake mosque, Masjid Hang Jebat at the road&#x27;s end.

<text>Color a Dinosaur is a 1993 electronic coloring book video game for young children. It was developed by FarSight Studios for the Nintendo Entertainment System.

==Gameplay==

The player colors various dinosaurs by using the provided dinosaur images and palettes. Players can either color using the free form mode or in the automatic mode where they only choose a color.

Intended for ages 3 to 6, the game lacks sophisticated features such as animation and minigames, and the basic colors are either brightly colored patterns or limited variations on pink or red. An extra set of patterns can be reached by pressing the &quot;Select&quot; button.

==Reception==
The September 1997 issue of &quot;Nintendo Power&quot; presented the votes of twelve staff members, to list their top 100 games of all time. This list also includes a 10 worst games of all time, placing &quot;Color a Dinosaur&quot; at 9th. The article described the game as &quot;Mario Paint&quot; &quot;without anything fun in it&quot; and that &quot;even the producer of the game (Seth, wherever you are) would roll his eyes when reminded of this prehistoric patsy.&quot;

<doc id="906193" wikidata="Q17152469" url="?curid=906193" title="Native chemical ligation">
<text>Native Chemical Ligation (NCL) is an important extension of the chemical ligation concept for constructing a larger polypeptide chain by the covalent condensation of two or more unprotected peptides segments. Native chemical ligation is the most effective method for synthesizing native or modified proteins of typical size (&quot;i.e.&quot;, proteins&lt; ~300 AA).

== Reaction ==

In native chemical ligation, the ionized thiol group of an N-terminal cysteine residue of an unprotected peptide attacks the C-terminal thioester of a second unprotected peptide, in an aqueous buffer at pH 7.0 and room temperature. This transthioesterification step is reversible in the presence of an aryl thiol catalyst, rendering the reaction both chemoselective and regioselective, and leads to formation of a thioester-linked intermediate. The intermediate rapidly and spontaneously rearranges by an intramolecular &quot;S,N-acyl shift&quot; that results in the formation of a native amide (&#x27;peptide&#x27;) bond at the ligation site (scheme 1).

Remarks :

*Thiol additives :
The initial transthioesterification step of the native chemical ligation reaction is catalyzed by thiol additives. The most effective and commonly used thiol catalyst is 4-mercaptophenylacetic acid (MPAA), (ref).

*Regioselectivity:
The key feature of native chemical ligation of unprotected peptides is the reversibility of the first step, the thiol(ate)–thioester exchange reaction. Native chemical ligation is exquisitely regioselective because that thiol(ate)–thioester exchange step is freely reversible in the presence of an added arylthiol catalyst. The high yields of final ligation product obtained, even in the presence of internal Cys residues in either/both segments, is the result of the irreversibility of the second (S-to-N acyl shift) amide-forming step under the reaction conditions used.

*Chemoselectivity of NCL :
No side-products are formed from reaction with the other functional groups present in either peptide segment (e.g. Asp, Glu side chain carboxylic acids; Lys epsilon amino group; Tyr phenolic hydroxyl; Ser, Thr hydroxyls, etc.).

==Historical context==

In 1992, Stephen Kent and Martina Schnölzer at The Scripps Research Institute developed the &quot;Chemical Ligation&quot; concept, the first practical method to covalently condense unprotected peptide segments; the key feature of chemical ligation is formation of an unnatural bond at the ligation site. Just two years later in 1994, Philip Dawson, Tom Muir and Stephen Kent reported &quot;Native Chemical Ligation&quot;, an extension of the chemical ligation concept to the formation of a native amide (&#x27;peptide&#x27;) bond after initial nucleophilic condensation formed a thioester-linked condensation product designed to spontaneously rearrange to the native amide bond at the ligation site. 

Theodor Wieland and coworkers had reported the S-to-N acyl shift as early as 1953, when the reaction of valine-thioester and cysteine amino acid in aqueous buffer was shown to yield the dipeptide valine-cysteine. The reaction proceeded through the intermediacy of a thioester containing the sulfur of the cysteine residue. However, Wieland&#x27;s work did NOT lead to the development of the native chemical ligation reaction. Rather, the study of amino acid thioester reactions led Wieland and others to develop the &#x27;active ester&#x27; method for the synthesis of protected peptide segments by conventional chemical methods carried out in organic solvents.

== Features ==

Native chemical ligation forms the basis of modern chemical protein synthesis, and has been used to prepare numerous proteins and enzymes by total chemical synthesis. The payoff in the native chemical ligation method is that coupling long peptides by this technique is typically near quantitative and provides synthetic access to large peptides and proteins otherwise impossible to make, due to their large size, decoration by post-translational modification, and containing non-coded amino acid or other chemical building blocks. 

Native chemical ligation is inherently &#x27;Green&#x27; in its atom economy and its use of benign solvents. It involves the reaction of an unprotected peptide thioester with a second, unprotected peptide that has an N-terminal cysteine residue. It is carried out in aqueous solution at neutral pH, usually in 6 M guanidine.hydrochloride, in the presence of an arylthiol catalyst and typically gives near-quantitative yields of the desired ligation product. 

Peptide-thioesters can be directly prepared by Boc chemistry SPPS; however, thioester-containing peptides are not stable to treatment with a nucleophilic base, thus preventing direct synthesis of peptide thioesters by Fmoc chemistry SPPS. Fmoc chemistry solid phase peptide synthesis techniques for generating peptide-thioesters are based on the synthesis of peptide hydrazides that are converted to peptide thioesters post-synthetically. 

Polypeptide C-terminal thioesters can also be produced &quot;in situ&quot;, using so-called &quot;N,S&quot;-acyl shift systems. &quot;Bis&quot;(2-sulfanylethyl)amido group, also called SEA group, belongs to this family. Polypeptide C-terminal &quot;bis&quot;(2-sulfanylethyl)amides (SEA peptide segments) react with Cys peptide to give a native peptide bond as in NCL. This reaction, which is called SEA Native Peptide Ligation, is a useful variant of native chemical ligation.

In making peptide segments that contain an N-terminal cysteine residue, exposure to ketones should be avoided since these may cap the N-terminal cysteine. Do not use protecting groups that release aldehydes or ketones. For the same reason, the use of acetone should be avoided, particularly in washing glassware used for lyophilization.

A feature of the native chemical ligation technique is that the product polypeptide chain contains cysteine at the site of ligation. The cysteine at the ligation site can be desulfurized to alanine, thus extending the range of possible ligation sites to include alanine residues. Other beta-thiol containing amino acids can be used for native chemical ligation, followed by desulfurization. Alternatively, thiol-containing ligation auxiliaries can be used that mimic an N-terminal cysteine for the ligation reaction, but which can be removed after synthesis. The use of thiol-containing auxiliaries may not be as effective as ligation at a Cys residue. Native chemical ligation can also be performed with an N-terminal selenocysteine residue.

Polypeptide C-terminal thioesters produced by recombinant DNA techniques can be reacted with an N-terminal Cys containing polypeptide by the same native ligation chemistry to provide very large semi-synthetic proteins. Native chemical ligation of this kind using a recombinant polypeptide segment is known as Expressed Protein Ligation. Similarly, a recombinant protein containing an N-terminal Cys can be reacted with a synthetic polypeptide thioester. Thus, native chemical ligation can be used to introduce chemically synthesized segments into recombinant proteins, regardless of size.

<doc id="906200" wikidata="Q504166" url="?curid=906200" title="Renault 21">
<text>The Renault 21 is a large family car produced by French automaker Renault between 1986 and 1994. It was also sold in North America initially through American Motors dealers as the Renault Medallion and later through Jeep-Eagle dealers as the [[Eagle Medallion]]. A total of 2,096,000 units were produced.

The Renault 21 saloon was launched in the beginning of 1986, as the successor to the successful Renault 18, and this was followed a few months later by the seven seater station wagon, the R21 Nevada, marketed as the Savanna in the United Kingdom. In 1987, &quot;What Car?&quot; awarded the Renault 21 GTS &quot;Best Family Saloon&quot;. The Renault 21 Savanna was awarded &quot;Car of the Year&quot;, as well as &quot;Best Family Estate&quot;.

==Design==
Unusually, the Renault 21 was offered with disparate engine configurations. The 1.7 litre version featured a transverse engine and transmission, but Renault had no gearbox suitable for a more powerful transverse engine: accordingly, faster versions featured longitudinally mounted engines. The two versions featured (barely perceptibly) different wheel bases: the engines were all relatively compact four-cylinder units and the engine bay was large enough to accept either configuration without reducing passenger space.

However, at a time when production technologies were relatively inflexible, the need to assemble differently configured engine bays on a single production line, along with the supplementary inventory requirements imposed both on Renault and on the dealership network, did compromise the Renault 21&#x27;s profitability.

The Nevada/Savanna station wagon/estate version was slightly longer than the saloon, and was available configured with seven seats, two of those a forward-facing foldable bench seat for children (up to about age 10) that used up much of the luggage space when up. It had roof rack side rails as standard.

==History==
First unveiled on 20 November 1985 and officially launched in February 1986, the R21 gave Renault a new competitor in this sector after eight years of the R18, which was declining in popularity after a very strong start to its commercial life. It had a razor like design, which was different from contemporary cars of the era, e.g. the Ford Sierra (with its &quot;jelly mould&quot; design) and the Opel Ascona.

It was sold in right hand drive for the United Kingdom from June 1986.

The car was revamped considerably in May 1989, both technically and aesthetically – the new sleeker outward appearance was similar to the also recently revamped Renault 25, and a liftback body style was also added to the range (which soon became more popular than the saloon in France) along with a sporty 2.0 L Turbo version. Of the saloons, the TXi 2.0 12v and 2.0 turbo were also available with the four-wheel-drive Quadra transmission. The Nevada wagons received four-wheel-drive in the eight-valve 2.0 and in the naturally aspirated 2.1 Diesel, as the 12-valve and the turbo were not available with this body style. The front-wheel-drive 21 Turbo was capable of . At the 1989 Frankfurt Motor Show the fuel injected 2.2i model was introduced, originally reserved for the German market (being a different model than the earlier 2.2s built for the US) where insurance and tax regulations suited larger engines with less peak power. Injected engines were equipped by Renix engine control unit, developed by a joint venture by Renault and Bendix. This car was also available with four-wheel-drive, exclusively as a Nevada.

The Renault 21 liftback and saloon petrol models ceased production in the beginning of 1994, following the launch of the all new Laguna liftback, but the diesels and the Nevada/Savanna remained on the market, until their replacement Laguna variants were launched (end of 1994 for the diesels, and end of 1995 for the Nevada/Savanna).

A Renault 21 TSE, donated as a personal gift to Václav Havel by the president of Portugal Mário Soares just before the Velvet Revolution, served for a while as the official state car of the President of Czechoslovakia in 1989.

==Other markets==

===Argentina===
The R21 was built in Argentina at the Renault facility in Santa Isabel (Córdoba Province) from late 1988 until early 1996. Production continued in Argentina for some years after its demise in European markets. Two body styles were built: saloon and Nevada (station wagon). It has been equipped with both petrol and diesel engines, (carburetor for the early production, fuel injection for the later engines).

The available engines ranged from 1.8 liters (92CV carbureted/95CV injection), 2.0 liters (110CV without catalytic converter/105CV with catalytic converter), up to 2.2 liters (120CV without catalytic converter/110CV with catalytic converter), as well as the 2.1-liter diesel version (72CV)

The liftback was imported from France and called by the trim &quot;Alizé&quot;. It was replaced for the Laguna.

===Turkey===
The R21 was manufactured in Turkey in the early 1990s, with two different engine and in three different trim levels. The entry level model was simply the 21 (1.7 L), the mid-range trim was called 21 Manager (1.7 L, 90 PS), and at the top-of-the-line sat the 2.0-liter fuel injected &quot;Concorde.&quot; Later on, the lower cost 1.6-litre &quot;Optima&quot; and the &quot;Manager 2000&quot; with a 2 L, 122 PS engine were introduced. The Oyak-built Renault 21 was produced and sold up to the end of 1996 in Turkey.

===United States and Canada===
The R21 was also sold in the United States and Canada from 1987 to 1988 as the Renault Medallion and later in 1988 until the end of the line in 1989 as the Eagle Medallion with the 2.2 L engine as the only powerplant. However, the car was only on sale for a few months in 1987 before Renault sold its investment in American Motors Corporation (AMC) to Chrysler. AMC dealers were now under the newly formed Jeep-Eagle Division of Chrysler, and now as Jeep-Eagle dealers, they continued to sell the car as the Eagle Medallion until 1989. The North American version had somewhat different styling to comply with front and rear impact regulations and different lighting standards.

===Colombia===
The 21 was launched in Colombia in 1987. Initially, it was only available with the four-door saloon body with the 2.0 L longitudinal engine. In October of the same year, the Renault 21 Nevada was launched, with the same engine as the saloon. in 1989 Sociedad de Fabricación de Automotores S.A. (SOFASA) launched a version called RS with the 1.6-liter C2L engine, also used in the TXE version of the Renault 9. In 1990, the name was replaced by the Étoile. This was the first car with electronic fuel injection assembled in Colombia. The three available versions available were:
* TS Saloon, Break, Penta (hatchback body) Engine 1.6  L , manufactured until 1994
* TX with engine 2.0  L 
* TXi after called Bravo: engine 2.2  L .

<text>The Carl D. Perkins Bridge is a cantilever bridge that spans the Ohio River between Washington Township, Scioto County, Ohio and South Portsmouth, Greenup County, Kentucky. The bridge carries the two lanes of State Route 852 and Truck Route U.S. Highway 23. The bridge connects to Kentucky Route 8.

==History==
In July 1978, inspections of the original U.S. Grant Bridge found serious deterioration in its suspension cables. The bridge was closed to traffic and was rehabilitated over an 18-month period. With future traffic projected to increase compounded with a decline in level of service on the original U.S. Grant Bridge, the Kentucky Department of Transportation (KYDOT) and the Ohio Department of Transportation (ODOT) agreed to begin planning for a new bridge. The 1978 Surface Transportation Assistance Act authorized the construction of a new bridge across the Ohio River in Portsmouth. In the environmental impact statement, it was decided the new bridge would be located downstream from the U.S. Grant Bridge.

The bridge opened on January 28, 1988. It is named after the late Carl D. Perkins, Congressman from the 7th District of Kentucky.

During the demolition of the original U.S. Grant Bridge and the construction of its replacement upstream, it was the only highway bridge connecting Ohio to Kentucky at Portsmouth. The Perkins Bridge also served as a detour for U.S. Highway 23 during this time period.

<text>Carl Dewey Perkins (October 15, 1912 – August 3, 1984) was an American politician and member of the United States House of Representatives from the Commonwealth of Kentucky serving from 1949 until his death from a heart attack in Lexington, Kentucky in 1984.

==Early years==
Carl Dewey Perkins was born in Hindman, Kentucky on October 15, 1912, to Dora Calhoun Perkins and James Perkins. Perkins attended high school at Hindman High School and Caney Junior College (now Alice Lloyd College). He worked as a teacher in a Knott County School for 90 students. He then went on to attend the Jefferson School of Law (now known as the University of Louisville School of Law) and graduated in 1935. He passed the bar and served a term as a commonwealth attorney for the thirty-first judicial district of Kentucky.

In 1938 Perkins married Verna Johnson and they had one son, Carl C. Perkins.

During World War II, Perkins enlisted in the United States Army and served a tour in Europe.

In 1940, Perkins was elected as a member of the Kentucky General Assembly was then elected Knott County Attorney in 1941 and reelected in 1945. Perkins resigned January 1, 1948 so that he could counsel the Department of Highways for Frankfort, Kentucky.

He was elected to serve as a Kentucky Representative in 1948 winning against the incumbent Wendell H. Meade.

==Congress==
In 1948 Perkins ran against the incumbent Congressman from Kentucky&#x27;s 7th District, Wendell H. Meade. Perkins unseated Meade and was elected as a Democrat to the Eighty-first and to the seventeen succeeding Congresses and served from January 3, 1949, until his death. Perkins was the chairman of the Committee on Education and Labor (Ninetieth through Ninety-eighth Congresses, 1967–1984). While a part of the committee, his work helped produce the Economic Opportunity Act of 1964 and Head Start. The local Head Start in his home city of Hindman, Kentucky is named after Congressman Perkins.

Unlike most Southern Democrats, Perkins was a pro-labor New Deal liberal. Perkins did not sign the 1956 Southern Manifesto, and voted in favor of the Civil Rights Acts of 1957, 1960, 1964 (where Perkins was the only yes vote from Kentucky), and 1968, as well as the 24th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and the Voting Rights Act of 1965.

==Death==
On August 3, 1984, Perkins was on a flight from Washington to Lexington, Kentucky, when he fell ill; when the plane landed, he was taken to a local hospital, where he died at the age of 71.

His funeral was widely attended as he was widely regarded as a popular Kentucky politician over the course of his career. Many of his colleagues flew to Kentucky to pay their respects along with thousands of native Kentucky residents.

The funeral proceedings were hosted in the Knott County High School gymnasium that was filled to capacity by colleagues and constituents of the congressman all of which were there to pay their respects. Notable attendees included Senator Edward Kennedy, House Majority Leader Jim Wright, Congressman William H. Natcher and House Speaker Thomas P. O&#x27;Neil who gave the eulogy.

Perkins was succeeded in office by his son, Carl C. Perkins.

==Legacy==

Perkins&#x27;s legacy of support to education and the under-privileged is shown by the federal student loan called the Perkins Loan, named for him, as is the Carl D. Perkins Career and Technical Education Improvement Act of 2006, which provides federal money for vocational education. The Carl D. Perkins Bridge crossing the Ohio River, the Carl D. Perkins Building on the campus of Eastern Kentucky University, and the Carl D. Perkins Federal Building and United States Courthouse in Ashland, Kentucky are named after him. The vocational school in Hindman, Kentucky at Knott County Central High School, Carl D. Perkins Job Corps at Prestonsburg and Carl D. Perkins Rehab Center at Thelma are also named in his honor. Kentucky highway 80 in Hazard, Kentucky is named the Carl D. Perkins Parkway. The Carl D. Perkins Parkway stretches from Hazard, Kentucky through Carl D. Perkins home county of Knott county, Kentucky. The Carl D. Perkins Parkway connects to the Hal Rogers Parkway in Hazard, Kentucky.

Perkins&#x27; grave site is in Hindman, Kentucky, in a public cemetery named &quot;Mountain Memory Gardens&quot;. However, he was originally buried at a private cemetery near his home in Hindman. In 2007 Perkins&#x27;s body was moved to where he is presently buried at Mountain Memory Gardens. Verna J. Perkins sold the old house and the land. She had since retired to a home for the elderly in Lexington, where she died in 2012.

<text>Seixal () is a Portuguese city and municipality, located in the district of Setúbal, in the metropolitan area of Lisbon. Its population includes 184,269 inhabitants (2011), in an area of that includes six parishes. It is situated across the Tagus River estuary from Lisbon. Its seat is the city of Seixal, a centre of 31,600 inhabitants situated along the Rio Judeu.

The current mayor is Paulo Silva.

==History==

The toponymy &quot;Seixal&quot; comes from a type of smooth stone (&quot;seixo&quot;) that is found in rivers; the name evolving from the name used to describe the geomorphology of the region.

Since the Roman era, the Tagus bay has been a region of human settlement, from many of the archaeological discoveries at Quinta do Rouxinol, in Corroios, and Quinta de S. João, in Arrentela (beginning in the period of the Portuguese Age of Discovery). A land of fishermen and signeurial holdings, the municipality of Seixal evolved over the centuries, always with the connection to the river. It was across the Tagus that many of the region&#x27;s products (fishe, cereals, salt, olive oil, wine and fruits) were exported to the regional capital.

In the 15th century, due to its prime location, various dockyards and shipbuilders began constructing river boats and trans-Atlantic ships. At the same time, the tides of the region were used to develop mills, such as the tidal mill in Corroios in 1403, fostering various the millers, caulkers and carpenters along the river. It was in Seixal that the brothers Vasco da Gama and Paulo da Gama built vessels for the trip to India. While Vasco da Gama was in Lisbon to prepare the trip, Paulo da Gama commanded carpenters and caulkers in the construction of the ships. Estevão da Gama, the father of the brothers, was commander of Seixal. The construction of the ships was the beginning of what is known as the &quot;Portuguese Discoveries&quot;. The settlement at this time was actually a part of the parish of Arrentela, then a division of Almada.

At the beginning of the 16th century, the population of the territory numbers three dozen homes, and by the 18th century there was a population of 400 inhabitants.

After the Liberal revolution, during the administrative reforms of 1836, during the reign of Queen Maria II of Portugal, Seixal obtained the status of municipality. A few years later (1895), this status, was extinguished. At that time Amora was integrated into the municipality of Almada, while Arrentela, Aldeia de Paio Pires and Seixal was annexed into the municipality of Barreiro. Yet, three years later the municipality of Seixal was newly instituted.

As a consequence, by the 18th century, the municipality became an aristocratic retreat for the nobility in nearby Lisbon, resulting in the construction several vacation properties or villas, such as Quinta da Fidalga, Quinta do Alamo, Quinta da Trindade, Quinta de São Pedro and Quinta de Cheiraventos.

Around the bay there are several factories that were important in the development of the municipality, such as the &quot;Fábrica de Vidros da Amora&quot; (&quot;Amora Glass Factory&quot;, the &quot;Companhia de Lanifícios da Arrentela&quot; (&quot;Arrentela Wool Co.&quot;), the &quot;Mundet Cork Factory&quot; in Seixal; and the cod drying buildings on the Ponta dos Corvos. These early factory installations transformed the municipality from a rural outpost into an industrial centre, eventually resulting in the installation of the steelmaker Siderurgia Nacional in 1961.

In 1966, a bridge was inaugurated over the Tagus providing a direct, stable link to Lisbon.

The civil parish of Corroios was created in 1976. On 27 May 1993, the parish of Fernão Ferro was established, following the division of the old parish of Arrentela; and on 20 May, the towns of Seixal and Amora evolved to the status of city.

==Geography==

Seixal is situated on the peninsula of Setúbal and is part of the metropolitan area of Lisbon. The municipality is bordered to the east by the municipality of Barreiro, south by Sesimbra, west by Almada (with which it has a strong affinity) and the north by the Tagus estuary, through which connects to Lisbon.

The Bay of Seixal is part of the Tagus River Estuary, that is fed by several rivers and confluents that extend to the sea; classified as a &quot;Reserva Ecológica Nacional&quot; (&quot;National Ecological Reserve&quot;), the bay and small tributaries are part of one of the most important humid zones in Portugal, supporting an elevated biodiversity and exceptional landscape.

Seixal is one of the eight municipalities with the most inhabitants in Portugal, and is composed of four parishes occupying a territory of : 
* Amora
* Corroios
* Fernão Ferro
* Seixal, Arrentela e Aldeia de Paio Pires

Although the municipal population continued to grow with development, after the 1970s there was a boom in the population, due to improvements in accessibility and mobility, principally due to public transport, its location to Lisbon and installation of economic activities within the territory. This growth transformed, in a short time, from a territory predominantly rural into an urban municipality, consisting of agglomerations of large dimensions focusing on various establishments and social centres. This growth resulted in the 1993 elevation of Seixal and Amora into cities, and the establishment of Corroios into the status of town.

==Economy==

Seixal&#x27;s industrial tradition dates to the shipbuilding industries during the Age of Discoveries. Its privileged location near the capital, with ease of access along the river, contributed to the establishment of various industries. By the early 1990s, heavy industry and manufacturing ceased to be an important motivator of the local economy, with the small and medium logistics and service industries established in modern industrial parks: there are roughly 15,000 companies. Approximately 556 hectares of the municipality (or 6.2% of the area) is occupied by economic activities, with the municipal planning authority adding an additional 364 hectares (3.8%) to industry.

Two of the most recent investment catchment operations is Seixal Business Park, an area next to the Coina node where are headquartered 69 companies, representing about 1,500 jobs, and the study redefine the spatial organization of the area occupied by the former National Steel Company (Siderurgia National do Seixal). These two projects converge on the new Economic Activities Park Seixal County, an area with a total of 700 hectares.

Another area of investment in the county is the tourism. With a wide river front and a large area of tree mass, there are numerous business activities with potential for tourism and leisure. The Office of Business Support - GAE (Gabinete de Apoio ao Empresário), inserted into the GAE Network of Setubal, can support routing of investment through support provided by trained personnel. Here you can learn about business creation, licensing, support and investment incentives, camarários requirements, suitable sites for the installation of economic activities and interpretation of PDM - Municipal Master Plan, as well as other information about the business.

==Transport==
The principal road network that crosses the municipality, guarantees the connections north to Almada and Lisbon, some away, in addition to Setúbal, including the A2 motorway. The A33 motorway also constitutes a vital variant along the Setúbal peninsula, allowing connection along two bridges over the Tagus, and facilitate inter-municipal commerce.

The rail-lines connecting Lisbon to Fogueteiro, across the 25 April Bridge (), reinforces these roadway connections.

Inland navigation across the Tagus estuary is a vital link economically, as well as a tourist link, with catamaran service provided by Transtejo &amp; Soflusa (with 15 minute service) to Cais do Sodré in Lisbon.

A lowland community, Seixal provides bike paths along the bay that link Amora and Seixal, passing through the parishes of Seixal, Arrentela and Amora.

==Culture==

Throughout there are secular or religious celebrations that highlight the calendar year, including the Modern Music Festival of Corroios and Seixal Jazz.
But, the primary event of the social year is the Avante! Festival, the annual festival of Portuguese Communist Party, that attracts hundreds of thousands of visitors. The event consists of a three-day music festival with hundreds of Portuguese and international bands and artists across five different stages, in addition to ethnographic demonstrations, gastronomy, social debates, books and music fair, the Avanteatro (theatre) and sporting events. Several foreign communist parties also participate. The events preparation begins following the conclusion of the annual festivities, through the initiative of party members and youth volunteers.

==Sport==
Seixalíada is the community&#x27;s annual sporting event bringing together the region&#x27;s athletes in various sporting activities from track to water event, forming a mini-Olympiad.

<text>The Fairey Gannet is a carrier-borne aircraft that was designed and produced by the British aircraft manufacturer the Fairey Aviation Company. It was developed for the Royal Navy, being the first fixed-wing aircraft to combine both the search and strike portions of anti-submarine warfare (ASW) operations to be operated by the Fleet Air Arm (FAA).

The Gannet was originally developed to meet a Second World War era requirement for a dual-role ASW and strike to equip the FAA. It was a mid-wing monoplane with a tricycle undercarriage and a crew of three, with a double turboprop engine driving two counter-rotating propellers. On 19 September 1949, the prototype Gannet performed its maiden flight. Four years later, it was brought into regular service with the FAA. The service would use the type from the majority of its aircraft carriers throughout the Cold War. Various export customers were also secured for the Gannet, including the Royal Australian Navy, the German Navy, and the Indonesian Navy, most of these operating the aircraft exclusively from land bases.

During the 1960s, the Royal Navy transitioned to using helicopters, such as the Westland Whirlwind HAS.7, for ASW operations. Accordingly, several Gannets were adapted to perform alternative operations, such as an airborne electronic countermeasures platform and carrier onboard delivery aircraft. Perhaps the most extensive variant of the type was the Gannet AEW.3, which was developed as a carrier-based airborne early warning platform and was operated exclusively by the FAA. The service disposed of its Gannets on 15 December 1978, roughly aligning with the withdrawal of the last of the Royal Navy&#x27;s large fleet carriers.

==Development==
===Background===
According to the aviation historian H. A. Taylor, the origins of what would become the Gannet can be traced back to 1935, when the Fairey Aviation Company started development of the unsuccessful Fairey Prince that used an unusual twin-engine arrangement. Formal design work on the Gannet commenced in response to the issuing of requirement GR.17/45 in 1945, under which the Admiralty sought a new twin-seat aircraft capable of performing both anti-submarine warfare (ASW) and strike missions. Two rival aircraft manufacturers, Fairey and Blackburn Aircraft, opted to produce responses. Fairey&#x27;s submission was known as the &quot;Type Q&quot; or &quot;Fairey 17&quot; (these designations being sources from the naming of the requirement), while Blackburn&#x27;s was the Blackburn B-54 / B-88.

For 18 months, Fairey investigated the use of a single Rolls-Royce Tweed turboprop engine to power their proposed aircraft, however, this option was discontinued to concentrate on other efforts. Instead, Fairey approached the engine manufacturer Armstrong Siddeley to develop a new engine based on the existing Armstrong Siddeley Mamba turboprop: the Double Mamba (otherwise known as the &quot;Twin Mamba&quot;). This engine basically comprised a pair of Mamba engines that were mounted side-by-side and sharing a common gearbox. The proposal was enthusiastically accepted and formal design work on the engine stated in December 1945.

The acceptance of this proposal enabled Fairey to develop a rather atypical propulsion arrangement for their proposed aircraft, which was normally only possible for a single engined aircraft. Via the use of a pair of coaxial contra-rotating propellers fitted on the nose of the aircraft, various advantages were presented over conventional twin-engine counterparts; one engine could be shut down and its propellers feathered without producing asymmetry and therefore control difficulties. Shutting down one of the two engines in flight would reduce fuel consumption and extend the aircraft&#x27;s range.

On 12 August 1946, Fairey was awarded an initial contract to produce two prototypes; Blackburn also received a competing contract to build its own prototypes. One reason for the ordering of multiple prototypes was so that alternative engines, such as the Napier Nomad, could be test flown, although some of these alternatives would never actually be fitted. Another reason was the relatively radical engine arrangement and the high proportion of original design features incorporated into the aircraft.

===Into flight===
On 19 September 1949, the prototype performed its maiden flight from Aldermaston outside Reading, flown by R. G. Slate; this milestone occurred ten months ahead of Blackburn&#x27;s competing prototype. While some elements of the prototype proved relatively trouble-free, such as the Double Mamba engine, several early test flights had been troubled by flight control difficulties. These issues, such as sharp trim changes, did not delay the next stage of testing, which commenced in November of that year at Fairey&#x27;s White Waltham facility. On 25 November 1949, the prototype crash-landed during an unstable landing, leading to three months of repairs.

On 1 March 1950, flight testing resumed with the repaired prototype. By this point, several of the handling issues had been appropriately remedied along with several other faults, yet difficulties with holding the nosewheel up during landings remained. Two months later, sufficient progress had been made to proceed with a formal assessment by naval test pilots at RAF Boscombe Down as well as to begun preliminary carrier trials. On 19 June 1950, the prototype conducted the first deck landing by a turboprop aircraft on , piloted by Lieutenant Commander G. Callingham.

On 6 July 1950, the second prototype took to the skies, joining the flight test shortly thereafter. As a result of changes to the operational requirements, this aircraft featured numerous changes from the first prototype, such as a third canopy for an additional crew member and an extended bomb bay. To accommodate the latter, the radome had to be repositioned rearwards; the first prototype was modified to reflect these changes for the aerodynamic trials.

In May 1952, the first prototype returned to Boscombe Down to conduct deck landing assessments and trials, having been configured to represent a production-standard aircraft by this point. Changes included the repositioning of the main landing legs rearwards by 12 inches. Following a full series of handling trials, further carrier trials were performed aboard . On 13 March 1951, Fairey received an initial order for 100 &quot;Gannet AS.1&quot;s from the British Government; this had been placed as a &#x27;super-priority&#x27; on account of the Korean War. In 1953, quantity production of the type commenced.

On 9 June 1953, the first production Gannet performed its initial flight from RAF Northolt and was put to work in the latter stages of the flight test programme. One serious flaw encountered during the later stage of trials was instances of compressor stalls; the type was grounded for two months while the propeller control system was modified accordingly. One early production aircraft appeared at the 1953 Society of British Aerospace Companies (SBAC) display at Farnborough. On 5 April 1954, four Gannets were formally handed over to the FAA at RNAS Ford.

===Further development===
The development of several variants of the Gannet started relatively early. On 16 August 1954, the first &quot;Gannet T.2&quot;, a dedicated trainer variant made its initial flight; it was furnished with dual controls in the forward cockpits, with a retractable periscope for the second cockpit, while the radar apparatus and scanner equipment were deleted. Production of the Gannet was shared between Fairey&#x27;s factories at Hayes, Middlesex and Heaton Chapel, Stockport / Manchester (Ringway) Airport. During 1954, production commenced at Heaton Chapel, the first aircraft from this production line flew on 5 October of that year. That same month, tropical trials were conducted in Khartoum.

During the late 1950s, an improved ASW model, the &quot;Gannet AS.4&quot;, and its &quot;T.5&quot; trainer equivalent were developed. The improvements included the fitting of an up-rated Double Mamba engine. Several were refurbished with new electronics and radar; these were re-designated &quot;Gannet AS.6&quot;.

During 1958, the Gannet was selected to replace the Douglas Skyraider in the airborne early warning and control (AEW) role. In order to accommodate the systems required for this new mission, the Gannet underwent a significant redesign that saw a new version of the Double Mamba installed, a new radome mounted under the aircraft, the tailfin increased in area, the undercarriage lengthened and the weapons bay removed. A total of 44 aircraft (plus a single prototype) of the AEW.3 version were produced.

==Design==

The Fairey Gannet is a carrier-borne turboprop-powered aircraft. It was typically operated by a crew of three, a pilot and two aerial observers. The pilot was seated directly above the aircraft&#x27;s Double Mamba engine and behind the gearbox and contrarotating propellers in a position that conferred a favourable view over the nose for carrier operations. The first observer was seated underneath a separate canopy that was directly aft of the pilot&#x27;s position. On the production aircraft, a second observer was also present in their own cockpit that was located over the wing trailing edge. This addition disturbed the airflow over the horizontal stabiliser, necessitating the addition of small finlets on either side.

The wing of the Gannet folded in two places, forming a distinctive Z-shape on each side, to minimise its space requirements while being stowed onboard aircraft carriers. The first fold was upwards, at about a third of the wing span where the inboard anhedral (down-sweep) changed to the outboard dihedral (up-sweep) of the wing (described as an inverted gull wing). The second wing fold was downward, at about two-thirds of the wing span. The length of the nosewheel shock absorber caused the Gannet to have a distinctive nose-high attitude, which was a common characteristic of carrier aircraft of the era.

The Gannet had a sizable internal bomb bay within the fuselage; it was the first British aircraft in FAA service to be capable of storing all its munitions (other than rockets) within an internal bomb bay. Such munitions could include depth charges, sonobouys, homing torpedoes, bombs, markers, and mines. Hard points beneath the outer wings could carry up to 16 Mk.8 or 24 Mk.5 rocket projectiles; other equipment included 100 gallon external fuel tanks. The primary search apparatus was the air-to-surface-vessel (ASV) radar, which made use of a retractable radome positioned underneath the rear fuselage just to the aft of the bomb bay.

The Armstrong Siddeley Double Mamba engine consisted of two Mamba engines that were mounted in a side-by-side arrangement and coupled through a common gearbox to coaxial contra-rotating propellers. Each engine drove its own propeller, and power was transmitted by a torsion shaft which was engaged through a series of sun, planet, epicyclic and spur gears to give a suitable reduction ratio and correct propeller-shaft rotation. The ASMD.1 engine () was used in the Gannet AS.1; ASMD.3 () in the AS.4; and ASMD.4 () in the AEW.3 variant. The Double Mamba engine could be run with one Mamba stopped and its propeller feathered, to conserve fuel and extend endurance when cruising; stopping one engine on a conventional twin-engined plane would normally create thrust asymmetry, whereas the centreline-mounted propeller arrangement avoided this. The Mamba exhausts were situated on each side of the fuselage, at the root of the wing trailing edge. The gas-turbine engine could run on kerosene, &quot;wide-cut&quot; turbine fuel or diesel fuel, allowing the Admiralty to eliminate the dangerous high-octane petroleum spirit required to operate piston-engined aircraft from carriers.

In FAA service, the Gannet generally wore the standard camouflage scheme of a Sky (duck-egg blue) underside and fuselage sides, with Extra Dark Sea Grey upper surfaces, the fuselage demarcation line running from the nose behind the propeller spinner in a straight line to then curve and join the line of the fin. Code numbers were typically painted on the side of the fuselage ahead of the wing; roundel and serial markings were behind the wing. The T.2 and T.5 trainers were finished in silver overall, with a yellow &quot;Trainer band&quot; on rear fuselage and wings.

==Operational history==
During April 1954, deliveries of the Gannet AS.1 formally commenced. On 17 January 1955, the 826 NAS became the RN&#x27;s first operational Gannet squadron, which promptly embarked on the modernised aircraft carrier . During its initial at-sea deployment in the Mediterranean, no serious issues were encountered with the Gannet aside from the standard teething issues. Later that same year, the Royal Australian Navy (RAN) stood up their first two Gannet squadrons.

The RAN ultimately operated 33 Gannet AS.1 and three T.2 trainers. They were primarily flown from the aircraft carrier as well as the shore base near Nowra, New South Wales. During 1967, the RAN withdrew its surviving 24 Gannets from service.

By the mid-1960s, the Royal Navy&#x27;s Gannet AS.1 and AS.4 models had been replaced by the Westland Whirlwind HAS.7 helicopters. FAA Gannets continued to operate as electronic countermeasures (ECM) aircraft: the &quot;ECM.6&quot;. Several Gannet AS.4s were converted to &quot;COD.4&quot;s for Carrier onboard delivery—the aerial supply of mail and light cargo to the fleet.

Starting in May 1958, West Germany&#x27;s Navy commenced operations of the Gannet AS.4; the country would obtain 15 Gannet AS.4s and a single T.5. German Gannets operated as the ASW squadron of &quot;Marinefliegergeschwader&quot; 2 (2nd Naval Aviation Wing) from Jagel and Sylt. During 1963, the squadron was reassigned to MFG 3 at Nordholz Naval Airbase, where they remained until replaced by the newer and larger Breguet Br.1150 Atlantic three years later.

During January 1959, Indonesia ordered 18 Gannet AS.4 and T.5s for the they received 17 AS4 (converted from AS1) and 2 Trainers (also upgraded) Indonesian Navy. These were purchased from Fairey via the Ministry of Supply and were re-modelled from existing Gannet AS.1s and T.2s prior to delivery. Several were used as ground-based trainers only. Additional Gannets were later acquired by other countries.

===Accidents and mishaps===
* 21 November 1958 – Fairey Gannet AS.1, WN345, suffered a belly landing during a test programme, forced by a partially deployed nosewheel. The pilot landed gear-up on a foam-covered runway at RAF Bitteswell, suffering minimal damage. After repair, the Gannet was back in the air within weeks.
* 30 January 1959 – A Royal Australian Navy Gannet on a trip from Bankstown to Nowra broke up in mid-flight over the Sydney suburb of Sylvania, killing the pilot.
* 29 July 1959 – Royal Navy Fairey Gannet XA465, unable to lower the undercarriage, made a power-on deck belly landing into the crash barrier on . The crew was uninjured but the airframe was written off, salvaged in Singapore, but ending up at the fire dump of Singapore Naval Base.
* 9 April 1962 – Two Fairey Gannet of 849 Sqn FAA RN (XL499 &quot;426&quot; and XP197 &quot;414&quot;) collided at night and crashed into the English Channel 15 miles off The Lizard, Cornwall. All six crew were killed.
* 23 January 1964 – Royal Navy Fairey Gannet XG832 suffered double engine failure caused by a phosphor bronze bushing on the idler gear of the port engine&#x27;s primary accessory drive failing. Fine metal particles from the gear were carried away by the shared oil system of the two engines, causing both to be destroyed. All three crew bailed out near St Austell and survived.
* 12 May 1966 – German Navy UA-115 crashed shortly after takeoff from Kaufbeuren, killing all three crew members. The crash was deemed the result of pilot error.

===Harness restraint issues===
Tests on the harness restraint system in the Gannet were carried out after a midflight failure due to the release cables binding. The accident was the result of an unrelated engine failure, but the primary issue was the failure of the harness quick-release mechanism.

<text>A demulcent (derived from the &quot;caress&quot;) is a mucilaginous or oleaginous preparation that forms a soothing protective film over a mucous membrane, relieving minor pain and inflammation of the membrane. However, they generally help for less than 30 minutes. 

Demulcents are sometimes referred to as mucoprotective agents. Demulcents such as pectin, glycerin, honey, and syrup are common ingredients in cough mixtures and cough drops.

==Examples==
Natural demulcents include slippery elm, pectin, licorice-root and marsh-mallow.

Synthetic demulcents include methylcellulose, propylene glycol, and glycerin.

<text>Robert Laurent (June 29, 1890 – April 20, 1970) was a French-American modernist figurative sculptor, printmaker and teacher. His work, the &quot;New York Times&quot; wrote,&quot;figured in the development of an American sculptural art that balanced nature and abstraction.&quot; Widely exhibited, he took part in the Whitney&#x27;s 1946 exhibition &quot;Pioneers of Modern Art&quot;. Credited as the first American sculptor to adopt a &quot;direct carving&quot; sculpting style that was bolder and more abstract than the then traditional fine arts practice, which relied on models, Laurent&#x27;s approach was inspired by the African carving and European avant-garde art he admired, while also echoing folk styles found both in the U.S. and among medieval stone cutters of his native Brittany. Best known for his virtuoso mastery of the figure, Laurent sculpted in multiple media, including wood, alabaster, bronze, marble and aluminum. His expertise earned him major commissions for public sculpture, most famously for the &quot;Goose Girl&quot; for New York City&#x27;s Radio City Music Hall, as well as for &quot;Spanning the Continent&quot; for Philadelphia&#x27;s Fairmount Park. After the Depression, he was also the recipient of several Works Progress Administration (WPA) Federal Art Project commissions under the New Deal, including a bas-relief called &quot;Shipping&quot; for the exterior of Washington, D.C.&#x27;s Federal Trade Commission Building, commissioned by the Treasury Department&#x27;s Section of Fine Arts in 1938.

== Background ==
Laurent was born the son of French peasants in Concarneau, Brittany, France in 1890. His skill in art was recognized by &quot;Brooklyn Eagle&quot; art critic, painter and collector Hamilton Easter Field who mentored him, taught him to paint and served as Laurent&#x27;s surrogate father for the rest of his life.

In 1908, Field took Laurent to Rome, where he trained with Maurice Sterne and wood carver Giuseppe Doratori, before formally studying at the British Academy. Upon graduation, Laurent moved permanently to the U.S. at age twenty, only to quickly return to Europe as a member of the navy during the First World War. In Europe, Laurent traveled to his native Brittany where he met Mimi Caraes, who became his wife.

Field died in 1922, leaving Laurent his Brooklyn home, the Ogunquit school they had co-founded and an art collection, which Laurent later used to establish as the Hamilton Easter Field Foundation with the help of other New York artists.

== The Ogunquit Summer School of Graphic Arts ==
In the summer of 1902, Field and 12-year-old Laurent traveled to Ogunquit, Maine, a popular destination for artists, drawn by the landscape. During their stay, Field &quot;bought a row of shacks that he started renting out cheap to artists.&quot; In 1911, Field and Laurent built a studio there and co-founded the Ogunquit Summer School of Graphic Arts. Field taught drawing and painting until his death, and Laurent taught sculpture and wood carving there for the next 50 years.

There was, however, another art school in Ogunquit. Founded by Field&#x27;s former teacher, Charles Woodbury&#x27;s Ogunquit Summer School of Drawing and Painting was heavily influenced by the &quot;regional impressionist&quot; style of painting also known as the Boston School. One of the school&#x27;s more famous students was Edward Hopper. Field and Laurent were, conversely, committed modernists, and appealed to more experimental students and colleagues, such as Marsden Hartley, Yasuo Kuniyoshi, Niles Spencer, gallery owner Edith Gregor Halpert and curator Holger Cahill, among others. Together, the two schools transformed a town of fewer than 1,000 into Maine&#x27;s largest art colony, an achievement that resulted, in 1953, in the opening of the Ogunquit Museum of American Art.

== Public collections ==
Public collections across the United States hold Laurent&#x27;s work, including the Art Institute of Chicago, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, MOMA, the Whitney Museum of American Art, the National Gallery of Art, the Smithsonian Art Museum, the Brooklyn Museum, the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, the Addison Gallery, Indiana University and the Terra Foundation for Art, among others.

== Awards and honors ==

In 1938, Laurent won the second of two Logan Prizes at the Art Institute of Chicago&#x27;s annual American art exhibition. In 1945, he won the Audubon Sculpture Award in New York, several first prizes in Hoosier salons, and in exhibits at the John Herron Museum, Indianapolis. He received high distinction in 1954 when was named sculptor in residence at the American Academy in Rome for a year.

Laurent was also one of 23 American sculptors whose works were selected for the controversial American National Exhibition in Moscow, in 1959. The exhibit, which included such celebrated artists as sculptors Ibram Lassaw and Isamu Noguchi and painters Hyman Bloom, Jackson Pollock and Edward Hopper was coordinated by the United States Information Agency (USIA), and liberal critics subsequently characterized it as a Cold War American &quot;propaganda strategy.&quot; Prior to the exhibition, the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) threatened to remove many of the artists who had been accused of links to communist activities. After President Eisenhower intervened, however, the exhibition went on as planned.

Laurent was a fellow of the National Sculpture Society, president of the Hamilton Easter Field Foundation, and a member of the Sculptor&#x27;s Guild – Indiana Artists, New England Sculptors Association, and the College Art Association. He was also elected to the National Institute of Arts and Letters shortly before his death at the age of seventy-nine.

== Academic career ==
Laurent taught at the Art Students League in New York City, the Corcoran Gallery of Art in Washington D.C., Vassar College, and Goucher College. In addition to teaching seasonally at the Ogunquit School until 1961, Laurent accepted a position as Professor of Fine Arts at Indiana University, a position he held from 1942 to 1960. He had notable students including Margit Varga.

== Family ==
Laurent&#x27;s son, John, was a prominent painter in Maine, known for his landscapes and seascapes.

<doc id="906255" wikidata="Q1710916" url="?curid=906255" title="Battle of Cedar Creek">
<text>The Battle of Cedar Creek, or Battle of Belle Grove, was fought on October 19, 1864, during the American Civil War. The fighting took place in the Shenandoah Valley of Northern Virginia, near Cedar Creek, Middletown, and the Valley Pike. During the morning, Lieutenant General Jubal Early appeared to have a victory for his Confederate army, as he captured over 1,000 prisoners and over 20 artillery pieces while forcing seven enemy infantry divisions to fall back. The Union army, led by Major General Philip Sheridan, rallied in late afternoon and drove away Early&#x27;s men. In addition to recapturing all of their own artillery seized in the morning, Sheridan&#x27;s forces captured most of Early&#x27;s artillery and wagons.

In heavy fog, Early attacked before dawn and completely surprised many of the sleeping Union soldiers. His smaller army attacked segments of the Union army from multiple sides, giving him temporary numerical advantages in addition to the element of surprise. At about 10:00am, Early paused his attack to reorganize his forces. Sheridan, who was returning from a meeting in Washington, D.C. when the battle started, hurried to the battlefield and arrived around 10:30am. His arrival calmed and revitalized his retreating army. At 4:00pm his army counterattacked, making use of its superior cavalry force. Early&#x27;s army was routed and fled south.

The battle ruined the Confederate army in the Shenandoah Valley, and it was never again able to maneuver down the valley to threaten the Union capital city of Washington, D.C. or northern states. Additionally, the Shenandoah Valley had been a key producer of supplies for the Confederate army, and Early could no longer protect it. The Union victory aided the reelection of Abraham Lincoln, and along with earlier victories at Winchester and Fisher&#x27;s Hill, won Sheridan lasting fame.

==Background==
===Union and Confederate strategies for Virginia in 1864===

In March 1864, Major General Ulysses S. Grant was summoned from the Western Theater, promoted to lieutenant general, and given command of all Union armies. Grant&#x27;s strategy, different from his predecessors, was for the Union armies to fight together with the objective of destroying Confederate armies instead of conquering territory. He would use multiple Union forces at the same time, making it difficult for the Confederates to transfer forces from one battlefront to another. In Virginia, General Robert E. Lee&#x27;s Army of Northern Virginia was a target. Not only would Lee&#x27;s army be pursued, but steps would be taken to cut off its supplies that came from Virginia&#x27;s Shenandoah Valley. Those supplies often moved on the Virginia Central Railroad, Virginia and Tennessee Railroad, and other railroads—which also became targets.

The Confederate Army of the Valley was created by Lee in June 1864 as a detachment of the Army of Northern Virginia&#x27;s Second Corps and was commanded by Lieutenant General Jubal Early. Its purpose was to protect the Shenandoah Valley, which was a major source of food for Lee&#x27;s Army of Northern Virginia. Another objective was to threaten the Union&#x27;s capital of Washington, forcing the Union to divert resources and relieve some of the pressure on the Army of Northern Virginia near the Confederate capital of Richmond. In June, Early beat Union forces in the Battle of Lynchburg and Second Battle of Kernstown. On July 9, he won the Battle of Monocacy in Maryland. Two days later, Early threatened Washington in the Battle of Fort Stevens, but was repelled by reinforcements rushed to the battlefield. Early then sent cavalry commanded by Brigadier General John McCausland on a northern raid in late July that resulted in the burning of the town of Chambersburg, Pennsylvania.

===Sheridan&#x27;s campaign===

After the cavalry raid that burned Chambersburg, Grant decided that Early&#x27;s threat had to be eliminated. In early August, Grant consolidated four military organizations into the Middle Military Division, and Major General Philip Sheridan assumed command on August 7—calling his force of cavalry and infantry the Army of the Shenandoah. At its creation, the army had three objectives. First was to drive Early&#x27;s army away from the Potomac River region and lower (northern) Shenandoah Valley, and pursue it southward. Second was to destroy the valley&#x27;s capacity to provide Lee&#x27;s army with food and supplies. Third was to disrupt the Virginia Central Railroad.

Sheridan was cautious in August because of a concern that any military disaster could hamper the re–election of President Abraham Lincoln. In September Sheridan had decisive victories over Early at the Third Battle of Winchester and at Fisher&#x27;s Hill. Sheridan took possession of the Shenandoah Valley as far south as Staunton, Virginia, and considered Early&#x27;s army cleared from the valley.

With Early much less of a threat, Sheridan could focus on denying the Confederacy the means of supplying its armies in Virginia. Sheridan&#x27;s army (mostly cavalry) did this aggressively, burning crops, barns, mills, and factories. The operation, conducted primarily from September 26 to October 8, has been known to locals ever since as &quot;the Burning&quot; or &quot;Red October&quot;. It encompassed the area of Harrisonburg, Port Republic, Staunton and Waynesboro. Sheridan claimed that when the destruction was completed, &quot;the Valley, from Winchester up to Staunton, ninety-two miles [148 km], will have but little in it for man or beast.&quot; While this action achieved one of Grant&#x27;s goals, Grant preferred attacks on the railroads that supplied Lee&#x27;s army in Richmond.

===Early reinforced===

After Early&#x27;s September 22 defeat at Fisher&#x27;s Hill, he retreated up the valley (south) to Mount Jackson. On September 26, he was reinforced by the infantry division of Major General Joseph B. Kershaw, who also brought a battalion of artillery. More reinforcements arrived on October 5, when the Laurel Brigade of Brigadier General Thomas L. Rosser also joined Early and was combined with two other cavalry brigades to form a division commanded by Rosser. Early believed that the addition of Kershaw&#x27;s Division (2,700 fighters), Rosser&#x27;s Laurel Brigade (600 men), the artillery battalion, and the return of stragglers from the September battles almost made up for his losses at Winchester and Fisher&#x27;s Hill.

After much of &quot;The Burning&quot; was conducted, Sheridan&#x27;s cavalry began moving north down the valley. The Confederate cavalries of Major General Lunsford L. Lomax and Rosser harassed Sheridan&#x27;s rear guard. By October 8, Rosser&#x27;s men were near the Union cavalry division commanded by Brigadier General George Custer, while Lomax was near the division commanded by Brigadier General Wesley Merritt. On that evening, an annoyed Sheridan told his cavalry commander, Brigadier General Alfred Torbert, to &quot;whip the rebel cavalry or get whipped&quot;. On October 9, in the Battle of Tom&#x27;s Brook, Custer and Merritt routed the Confederate cavalry in a battle that was described by Torbert as &quot;the most decisive the country had every witnessed&quot;.

==Opposing forces==
===Union===
In mid-October, the Army of the Shenandoah had 11 divisions plus artillery units, totaling about 31,610 effectives with 90 artillery pieces. A few days before the battle, Sheridan attended a meeting in Washington, and Major General Horatio Wright commanded the army in Sheridan&#x27;s absence. The Union forces were divided into the following:
* VI Corps had three infantry divisions and an artillery brigade, and was commanded by Major General Horatio Wright. When Wright temporarily commanded the army during Sheridan&#x27;s initial absence from the battle, the corps was commanded by Brigadier General James B. Ricketts. At least one historian says Wright&#x27;s fighters had a reputation for &quot;steadfastness and reliability&quot;. The VI Corps consisted of 8,506 infantry effectives. In addition, they had 600 men operating 24 artillery pieces.
* XIX Corps, consisting of two infantry divisions, was commanded by Brigadier General William H. Emory. It consisted of 8,748 infantry effectives. In addition, it had 414 men operating 20 artillery pieces. The XIXCorps was considered far behind the VICorps in discipline and efficiency.
* The Cavalry Corps, consisting of three divisions and a section of horse artillery, was commanded by Major General Alfred Torbert. It had 7,500 effectives plus 642 artillerists operating 30 artillery pieces. The three division commanders were Merritt, Colonel William H. Powell, and Custer. Fifteen regiments were completely armed, and three more were partially armed, with the carbine version of the seven-shot Spencer repeating rifle. 
* The Army of West Virginia functioned as an infantry corps in Sheridan&#x27;s Army of the Shenandoah, and is sometimes incorrectly identified as the VIII Corps. It was commanded by Brigadier General George Crook, and had two divisions plus an artillery brigade. Crook&#x27;s effectives for the battle consisted of only 4,000 infantry men plus 200 artillerists manning 16 artillery pieces. To bolster Crook&#x27;s small force, a Provisional Division of 1,000 men was attached. The Provisional Division&#x27;s &quot;reliability in combat was suspect&quot;.

===Confederate===
Early&#x27;s Confederate Army of the Valley had an estimated 21,102 effectives. In addition to his troops originally from Army of Northern Virginia&#x27;s Second Corps, this figure includes over 3,000 men from Kershaw&#x27;s infantry division, 2,206 men from Rosser&#x27;s cavalry division after the addition of the Laurel Brigade, and 1,101 artillerists. The Confederate forces were divided into the following:
* Infantry consisted of five divisions. Early&#x27;s division commanders were Major General Stephen Dodson Ramseur, Brigadier General John Pegram, Major General John Brown Gordon, and Brigadier General Gabriel C. Wharton. Kershaw commanded a fifth division, which was attached from Lieutenant General James Longstreet&#x27;s First Corps. The remainder of Longstreet&#x27;s First Corps, which was an elite Confederate fighting unit, was not present. Gordon was Early&#x27;s second–in–command.

* Cavalry consisted of two divisions. Major General Lomax commanded his own division, and it consisted of four brigades. His men were armed with rifles and had no pistols or sabers, making the division more like mounted infantry which could not fight on horseback. Rosser commanded Fitzhugh Lee&#x27;s Division, which was composed of three brigades including Rosser&#x27;s Laurel Brigade. Rosser had a reputation as one of the most aggressive and successful cavalry commanders in the Army of Northern Virginia, but had never commanded anything larger than a brigade of four regiments. The Laurel Brigade was composed of confident veterans with many victories over Union cavalry.

==Disposition of forces and movement to battle==
===Sheridan ready to leave the valley===

After the decisive victory at Tom&#x27;s Brook, Sheridan and many in the Union Army believed that Early&#x27;s Confederate army was no longer a threat. The Union army began moving down the valley (northeast) and believed that it would fight elsewhere. While Crook&#x27;s Army of West Virginia, and the XIXCorps, camped near Cedar Creek and Middletown, the VICorps was further away on the road to Front Royal. The cavalry divisions of Merritt and Custer were near Fisher&#x27;s Hill, while Powell&#x27;s 2nd Cavalry Division occupied Front Royal.

Because Grant still wanted the Confederate Virginia Central Railroad disabled, two brigades of cavalry from Powell&#x27;s Division were sent south to attack the railroad lines at Gordonsville and Charlottesville. In an order written October 12, Wright&#x27;s VICorps were ordered to depart on the next day through Ashby&#x27;s Gap for Alexandria, Virginia. From Alexandria, Sheridan planned to send the VI Corps to reinforce Grant and the Army of the Potomac.

===Hupp&#x27;s Hill and Sheridan goes to Washington===
Concealed from Sheridan&#x27;s army, Early&#x27;s troops arrived at Hupp&#x27;s Hill, just north of Strasburg, on October 13. They deployed in battle formation, and began shelling the camp of the XIXCorps. Early&#x27;s attack was a surprise for the Union infantry, and Crook originally believed the Confederates had sent a small reconnaissance force for the purpose of causing the Union soldiers to reveal their strength and location. Colonel Joseph Thoburn&#x27;s division from the Army of West Virginia moved forward to silence the guns and fought with Kershaw&#x27;s division at the Abram Stickley farm, which resulted in 209 Union and 182 Confederate casualties. The Confederates withdrew through Strasburg to Fisher&#x27;s Hill in the late afternoon. Sheridan recalled Wright&#x27;s VICorps that evening as a precaution, and they started back to Middletown on October14. The engagement was a mistake for Early, as the 9,000 veterans from the VI Corps made a big difference in the battle that would take place six days later.

On October 13, Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton requested that Sheridan come to Washington to discuss the next objective for Sheridan&#x27;s army. Grant and Stanton still wanted Sheridan to move his army toward Gordonsville and Charlottesville to threaten Confederate railroad operations. Sheridan continued to argue that the logistics would be difficult. With the skirmish at Hupp&#x27;s Hill over and Early removed to Fisher&#x27;s Hill, Sheridan departed for a meeting in Washington on October 15, leaving Wright in command. Sheridan ordered all three divisions of cavalry to accompany him to Front Royal, intending to send them to destroy a Virginia Central Railroad bridge. They arrived near Front Royal on October 16. At that time, Sheridan was notified that Early was sending wig-wag signals implying that Longstreet&#x27;s First Corps might join him (Early) from Petersburg. This was disinformation on Early&#x27;s part, hoping that it would induce the Federals to withdraw down the Valley, but instead, Sheridan sent his cavalry back to the infantry camps along Cedar Creek. Sheridan and his staff arrived in Washington on the morning of October17.

===Gordon makes a plan===

On October 17, Gordon climbed Massanutten Mountain and determined that the Union left was vulnerable, as the Union forces appeared to be relying on the mountain and rivers for defense. Gordon persuaded Early to approve an attack on the Union left flank, and believed they could destroy Sheridan&#x27;s army. Early&#x27;s approval was contingent on Gordon finding a concealed route that would enable the Confederate troops to get around the Union left. On the next day, Gordon scouted along the Shenandoah River (North Fork), and found a narrow trail. He presented his findings to Early, and Early approved an attack that would begin on the morning of October 19.

The attack would be made before dawn, and would take advantage of the morning fog that normally occurred in the valley. Gordon would lead three divisions in a rear attack on the Union left while Kershaw&#x27;s Division would attack the front. Wharton&#x27;s Division and the artillery would attack down the pike, northwest of Kershaw, waiting until the Union artillery was turned toward Gordon and Kershaw. Rosser would move north along Cedar Creek, hoping to keep Union cavalry located on the Union right from coming to assistance on the Union left. Gordon&#x27;s force would use the narrow mountain trail to get behind the Union left, which required an evening (October 18) departure time in order to be in position before dawn. A small brigade of cavalry commanded by Colonel William H. F. Payne would move with Gordon with the mission of capturing Sheridan at his headquarters at the Belle Grove Plantation house near Middletown. Lomax would move via Front Royal to Newtown (later named Stephens City), where he could cut off a Union retreat down the Valley Pike. During the time Gordon had command of the column of three divisions, Brigadier General Clement A. Evans would command Gordon&#x27;s Division. On October 18, the Confederate leaders synchronized their timepieces. They planned to be in position for the attack at 5:00am.

==Battle==
===Confederate attacks===

Early&#x27;s infantry began to form into three columns on the evening of October 18. Gordon&#x27;s column consisted of the divisions of Gordon (commanded by Evans), Pegram, and Ramseur, plus Payne&#x27;s Cavalry Brigade. It had the farthest to march, and departed about 8:00pm, just after it became dark. The men left behind anything that might rattle, and followed the narrow trail in single file. The other two Confederate columns, commanded by Wharton and Kershaw, departed at about 1:00am on October 19, and Early rode with Kershaw to Cedar Creek. As they hoped, the Confederates&#x27; quiet approach was aided by the presence of heavy fog. All three columns were in position by 3:30am. The two Confederate cavalries were also in position. Rosser&#x27;s dismounted cavalry (less Payne&#x27;s Brigade), was near the ford at Cupp&#x27;s Mill. His men skirmished briefly with Custer around 4:00am. Lomax&#x27;s cavalry was east near Cedarville and Front Royal. His command was as far as from Early&#x27;s infantry, making cooperation difficult. Early joined Wharton around 5:15am.

====Army of West Virginia====

Kershaw&#x27;s Division attacked the trenches of Thoburn&#x27;s Union 1st Division around 5:00am. Surprise was virtually complete and most of the Army of West Virginia troops were caught unprepared in their camps—many were asleep in their tents. The Union 1st Division lost most of its organization as most of its men fled—if they could. Its First Brigade, commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Thomas Wildes, kept two of its three regiments organized. The partial brigade conducted a fighting withdrawal to the Valley Pike that took over 30 minutes. Union Captain Henry A. du Pont, chief of Colonel Crook&#x27;s artillery, saved nine of his sixteen artillery pieces while he kept them in action as he withdrew toward Middletown. Du Pont&#x27;s efforts and Wildes&#x27; two regiments were only thing (other than fog) slowing the initial Confederate thrust by Kershaw&#x27;s Division. The Union 1st Division commander, Colonel Thoburn, was mortally wounded by Confederate cavalry while trying to rally his troops near Middletown.

Colonel Rutherford B. Hayes, commander of the Union 2nd Division, learned of the attack on Thoburn&#x27;s division only a few minutes before his own division was attacked by a line of seven brigades from Gordon&#x27;s column. Evan&#x27;s (Gordon&#x27;s) Division was on the Confederate left, and Ramseur&#x27;s Division was on the right. Hayes had two brigades, and only his First Brigade was in formation to receive Gordon&#x27;s attackers. His Second Brigade, located on his right (southwest), was still in their tents—and then had Thoburn&#x27;s retreating men racing through their camp. Soon, Hayes&#x27; division was also retreating. Most of Hayes&#x27; men retreated toward Belle Grove, while most of Thoburn&#x27;s men retreated northeast down the pike. During the retreat, Hayes&#x27; horse was killed and he was briefly knocked unconscious. Although injured and almost captured, he escaped. Further north, Union Colonel J. Howard Kitching&#x27;s Provisional Division of raw recruits fled after showing little resistance. On horseback, Kitching was wounded in the foot, but continued trying to rally his men. Kitching&#x27;s 6th New York Heavy Artillery Regiment, coming in from camp near the wagons, supported one of du Pont&#x27;s batteries. Although the Confederate attacking force from Ramseur&#x27;s Division suffered minimal casualties, Brigade Commander Cullen A. Battle was seriously wounded. Crook, Hayes, and Kitching regrouped fragments of the two Union divisions near Belle Grove.

====XIX Corps====

Unlike Crook&#x27;s men, the Union XIXCorps was not caught totally unprepared. Its 2nd Division, commanded by Brigadier General Cuvier Grover, was planning to undertake a reconnaissance mission at 5:30am south toward Strasburg. Around 5:15am they could hear musket fire near the Army of West Virginia&#x27;s position, and Grover positioned his men defensively—with the bulk of his men behind fortifications. The XIXCorps began receiving artillery fire from the south and east, and was attacked from those directions by Confederate troops, commanded by Kershaw and Evans, less than one hour after the start of the battle.

XIXCorps Commander Emory received unexpected assistance from Wildes&#x27; partial brigade from Crook&#x27;s Army of West Virginia. In the confusion of battle, Wildes&#x27; two regiments had been unable to reunite with Crook and the retreating men from the Army of West Virginia—so they offered assistance to Emory and Wright. When the partial brigade reported, Emory ordered it to attack—which would enable his men to have more time for reorienting the Union lines. Wright led a bayonet charge by Wildes&#x27; men and received a bloody wound to his face.

The small group of Crook&#x27;s men at Belle Grove, fortified by some of Emory&#x27;s men, held its position for about 40 minutes until it was flanked. Their action enabled most of the Union headquarters units and supply trains to withdraw to safety. In roughly two hours, Early had driven back five Union divisions, captured over 1,300 prisoners, and taken possession of 18 artillery pieces. With many of Crook&#x27;s men from the Army of West Virginia and the XIXCorps fleeing in disorder, the Union&#x27;s VICorps prepared a defense on a series of ridges further north of the Belle Grove plantation on the north side of Meadow Brook.

====Early, Gordon, and the VI Corps====

Sometime between 7:00 and 7:30am, Early met Gordon on the east side of the Valley Pike near the road that leads to Belle Grove. At that time, Kershaw and Evans were driving toward the camps of the Union VICorps, and the Confederate divisions of Pegram and Ramseur were aligned along the west side of the pike north of Early and Gordon&#x27;s meeting place. Early later wrote that at the time of the meeting, &quot;...the 19th and Crook&#x27;s corps were in complete rout, and their camps, with a number of pieces of artillery and a considerable quantity of small arms, abandoned.&quot; He also noted that the position of the Union VICorps on a ridge west of Middletown was &quot;a strong one&quot;, and Wharton&#x27;s division had been driven back. Early and Gordon had conflicting versions of their meeting, but Early took over command and Gordon returned to his division that had been temporarily commanded by Evans. From Gordon&#x27;s point of view, he wanted to concentrate an attack on the VICorps while Early was satisfied with the day&#x27;s accomplishments. From Early&#x27;s point of view, he &quot;rode forward on the Pike to ascertain the position of the enemy, in order to continue the attack.&quot; Wharton&#x27;s Division, plus artillery, followed Early down (northeast) the pike.
Acting Union VICorps Commander Ricketts had his men moving to position within 20 minutes of the start of the Confederate offensive. His 3rd Division of Colonel J. Warren Keifer was on the Union right with the 1st Division of Brigadier General Frank Wheaton on its left. Further northeast, the 2nd Division of Brigadier General George W. Getty had marched close to the south side of Middletown. All three Union divisions were eventually pulled back to a defensive position on the northwest side of Meadow Brook. Some cohesion was lost for this withdrawal, as Ricketts was wounded. The Confederates attacked around 7:30am, with Kershaw attacking Keifer, and Evans attacking Wheaton. Although initially repulsed, Kershaw and Evans drove the two Union divisions northwest by 8:00am. This put two Confederate divisions, Kershaw and Evans, beyond Getty&#x27;s right. At that time, Getty&#x27;s 2nd Division became the only organized Union infantry south of Middletown. With no support on his right, Getty moved his division back about to a stronger defensive position at the town cemetery on a partially wooded hill west of Middletown. For over an hour, Getty&#x27;s division defended this position against Confederate frontal assaults from the divisions of Ramseur, Pegram, and Wharton. During this time, Getty assumed command of the VICorps because of the wounding of Ricketts, and Brigadier General Lewis A. Grant assumed command of the division. After 30 minutes of artillery fire, Grant finally moved back and rested for 20 minutes. He then moved the division back about , unopposed, where he found support from Union cavalry on his east side.

===Union cavalry and Sheridan&#x27;s ride===

Custer and Merritt&#x27;s Union cavalry divisions were north of the infantry when the Confederate attack began. Although Rosser had skirmished with Custer&#x27;s men, he appeared tentative and did not press an attack. While waiting for orders, both Merritt and Custer sent their escort companies to the Valley Pike to attempt to stop Union infantry men from fleeing toward Winchester. Between 9:00am and 10:00am, Wright ordered Torbert to move the cavalry from the Union right to the Union left. Leaving three companies from Custer&#x27;s Division to face Rosser, Custer and Merritt moved to the west side of the Valley Turnpike, about threequarters of a mile (1.21km) northeast of Middletown. Although they faced strong artillery fire, they prevented Early from getting to the rear of the Union army.

On his return trip from the Washington conference, Sheridan spent the night in Winchester on October 18. At 6:00am on October 19, pickets south of Winchester reported to him that they heard the distant sounds of artillery. Sheridan assumed the noise was from Grover&#x27;s reconnaissance mission, and dismissed the report. As additional reports arrived, he ordered the horses to be saddled and ate a quick breakfast. By 9:00am he was riding south to the Valley Pike. Sheridan noticed that the sounds of battle were increasing in volume quickly, so he inferred that his army was retreating in his direction. He encountered retreating men and wagons less than south of Winchester. Hearing stories from panic stricken men that all was lost, he ordered a line set up to intercept stragglers. Wright had already begun to organize a defensive line between Newtown and Middletown. Sheridan arrived around 10:30am and began to rally the men to complete the line. His presence inspired his soldiers, and one soldier described it as like an &quot;electric shock&quot;.

===Early&#x27;s halt===
By 10:00am, Early believed he had a Confederate victory, after capturing 1,300 Union prisoners and 24 artillery pieces, and driving seven infantry divisions off the field. When Early rode into Middletown, he found that the Confederate attack had been stalled by Union artillery and cavalry. Ironically, the main reason two of the Union cavalry divisions were present for the battle was Early&#x27;s Longstreet ruse from a few days earlier. Instead of exploiting his victory, Early ordered a halt in his offensive to reorganize, a decision for which he later received criticism from subordinates such as Gordon.

In a second meeting with Early, Gordon wanted to press the attack against the VI Corps immediately, and later wrote that the &quot;fatal halting...converted the brilliant victory of the morning into disastrous defeat in the evening&quot;. Early&#x27;s main reason for caution was concern over the Union cavalry, which had repeating rifles, on the Confederate flanks. Another problem was that many of the hungry Confederate troops had stopped to plunder the Union camps abandoned in the early morning attack. By 11:30am, the Confederate line was ready to continue the advance, and Early attacked with Gordon&#x27;s, Kershaw&#x27;s, and Ramseur&#x27;s divisions. After an advance of about one–half mile (0.80 km), the Confederate attack stopped at 1:00pm. Early&#x27;s reasons for the ending the attack were the same issues causing his caution a few hours earlier: Union cavalry, missing troops that were plundering the Union camps, and exhausted and hungry soldiers.

===Union counterattack===

When Sheridan arrived at the scene of the battle at 10:30am, he assumed that Early&#x27;s Longstreet ruse from a few days earlier was true. After interrogating prisoners, he learned that only Kershaw&#x27;s Division from Longstreet&#x27;s corps was present. Sheridan also feared that Longstreet was approaching from Front Royal to trap the Union army between Longstreet and Early. Once Sheridan received confirmation (around 3:30pm) that Longstreet was not near Front Royal, he ordered an attack.

The Union counterattack began just before 4:00pm. Custer&#x27;s Division was back on the Union far right, further northwest from the main infantry line, facing Rosser. Merritt&#x27;s Division was on the Union left on the southeast side of the pike. The XIXCorps, with Brigadier General William Dwight now commanding the 1st Division and Grover returning to command the 2nd Division, was on the right of the main Union line. The VICorps was to the left of Grover. Crook&#x27;s Army of West Virginia was held in reserve close to the turnpike, as support for the VI Corps. Sheridan&#x27;s plan was for his cavalry to contain the Confederate flanks while the XIXCorps turned the Confederate left flank and drove them east of the pike, which would prevent Early&#x27;s army from using the Valley Pike&#x27;s bridge across Cedar Creek to escape.

The Union infantry attack stalled. Dwight was able to overlap Gordon&#x27;s left flank, but could not push Gordon&#x27;s Division toward the pike. On Gordon&#x27;s right, the divisions of Kershaw and Ramseur were positioned behind stone walls and assisted by artillery. Grover&#x27;s Division and Wright&#x27;s VICorps had little success against them, and Grover was again wounded. On the Union left, Merritt&#x27;s cavalry made two charges only to be repulsed by Confederate artillery and enfilading fire from enemy infantry that had resisted the advance of the VICorps. On Merritt&#x27;s third charge, bolstered by the VICorps moving forward, Confederate troops gave way in disorder. Moments before the Confederate troops fled, Union Colonel Charles Russell Lowell, commander of Merritt&#x27;s Reserve Brigade located at the Union cavalry&#x27;s left flank, was mortally wounded at Thorndale Farm.

====Custer joins the attack====

On the extreme Union right, Custer&#x27;s First Brigade was engaged in halfhearted fire with Rosser. Custer left his brigade commander with three of his regiments, and took the remaining men from his division toward the infantry attack on his left. He planned to get to the rear of Early&#x27;s men and secure the Valley Pike at the bridge over Cedar Creek—which would cut off the main Confederate route of retreat. As many of the Confederate soldiers saw Union cavalry moving toward their escape route, they began to panic and retreat. The appearance of Custer riding toward the creek was a signal for Dwight to resume his infantry attack. The remnants of Gordon&#x27;s Division, already panicked from Custer&#x27;s appearance, now had a renewed attack from Dwight and more Union infantry on the Confederate right. Soon most of Gordon&#x27;s men fled toward the pike, and it caused a domino effect that spread to Kershaw&#x27;s Division and then Ramseur&#x27;s. During this time, Ramseur, who was already wounded, tried to rally his men. His horse was shot dead, and he was mortally wounded.

While Custer was on the Union right, Merritt&#x27;s Division was on the Union left. Colonel Thomas Devin&#x27;s Second Brigade from Merritt&#x27;s Division took possession of the Cedar Creek bridge before Custer got there, so Custer took his two lead regiments (5th New York and 1st Vermont) to the right of the bridge where they forded the creek and continued chasing the fleeing enemy up (south) the Valley Pike.
Near 5:30pm, the divisions of Wharton, Pegram, and Wofford&#x27;s Brigade (from Kershaw&#x27;s Division) were the last Confederate units to across Cedar Creek. The fields between Cedar Creek and Fisher&#x27;s Hill were filled with fleeing men, wagons, ambulances, and artillery—all being chased by Union cavalry using sabers. The situation worsened for the Confederates when a small bridge on the Valley Pike south of Strasburg collapsed, making it impossible to cross with wagons or artillery. Early&#x27;s army was forced to abandon all of the captured Union guns and wagons from the morning attack, as well as most of its own. Sheridan&#x27;s pursuit ended at nightfall. The retreating Confederate soldiers gathered temporarily on Fisher&#x27;s Hill, and moved further south before dawn on the next day.

===Casualties===
The official report for the Union listed 644 officers and men killed, 3,430 wounded, and 1,591 captured or missing—a total of 5,665 casualties for the Union side of the battle. Both the VICorps and XIXCorps had over 2,000 casualties, but the VICorps had more killed and wounded. As the principal victims of the surprise attack, the Army of West Virginia had 540 men captured or missing, and 790 of the XIXCorps&#x27; 2,383 casualties were captured or missing. Crook&#x27;s Army of West Virginia had two division commanders killed or mortally wounded, colonels Thoburn and Kitching. Two Union brigade commanders were killed: Brigadier General Daniel D. Bidwell from the VI Corps, and Colonel Charles Russell Lowell from the Cavalry Corps.

Confederate casualties, which are less certain, are estimated to be 320 killed, 1,540 wounded, and 1,050 missing (or captured). This totals to 2,910, which is far less than the Union casualties. The Confederates also lost 300 wagons and ambulances, and 43 artillery pieces (including 20 Union pieces captured in the morning). The highest ranking Confederate casualty was Major General Ramseur, an infantry division commander, who was mortally wounded and captured by the 1st Vermont Cavalry Regiment. The Union army captured many more soldiers than the 1,591 count, including some soldiers multiple times, but many prisoners escaped in the darkness while their captors searched for more men. Among those that escaped was Early&#x27;s artillery chief, Colonel Thomas H. Carter.

==Aftermath==
===Performance and impact===
Three factors contributed to the initial success by the Confederate army. First, many of the soldiers in the Union army believed the campaign against Early&#x27;s army was over, which caused a lack of vigilance. Second, the terrain and poor placement of the Union infantry units created a vulnerability that allowed the Confederates to surprise, flank, and outnumber segments of the Union army. Third, Union cavalry was misplaced, leaving open the left flank. Once the Union cavalry was utilized, it had a crucial role in the Union victory. Cavalry accounted for nearly half (ten of twenty-one) of the medal of honor winners at Cedar Creek, even though it had only about one fourth of the men present. Two days after the battle, Sheridan sought promotions for two cavalry commanders, Merritt and Custer, and one infantry commander, Getty.

Many people gave Sheridan credit for the Union victory, and he was featured on the cover of Harper&#x27;s Weekly. It is &quot;beyond dispute&quot; that Sheridan had an electrifying effect on his men when he arrived at the battlefield. Others believe that Wright deserves much of the credit, as his VI Corps stopped the Confederate attack, and Wright&#x27;s tactical judgements made it possible for Sheridan to successfully rally his men. Some credit for the Union victory can be given to Confederate leader Jubal Early. Although the early morning Confederate infantry and artillery attack was well-planned and attained total surprise, Early&#x27;s cavalry was divided and awkwardly placed. The Confederate army&#x27;s relative inactivity after 10:00am, one of Gordon&#x27;s complaints, allowed the Union army to reorganize and eventually win the battle. Gordon, the architect of the early morning attack and a critic of Early, received blame from Early for the stalling of the attack. Early claimed that excessive plundering by Gordon&#x27;s Division depleted his force, and the depletion plus the threat of Union cavalry on his right flank caused the pause in the attack.

Sheridan&#x27;s victories in the Shenandoah Valley helped boost President Lincoln&#x27;s re-election campaign to victory in November. Earlier in August, Lincoln was being advised that his reelection was in doubt. The Union army&#x27;s numerical superiority was in trouble, and the country was tired of the war. Lincoln was overjoyed with the victory at Cedar Creek, as it came three weeks before the presidential election. Sheridan enjoyed instant acclaim, and poet Thomas Buchanan Read wrote a popular poem, &quot;Sheridan&#x27;s Ride&quot;, that added to the general&#x27;s fame. Sheridan&#x27;s success propelled him to status only eclipsed by Grant and William Tecumseh Sherman, and he would eventually become Commanding General of the United States Army. An equestrian statue of Sheridan rallying his men at Cedar Creek, sculpted by Gutzon Borglum, was dedicated in 1908 and stands in Washington, D.C.&#x27;s Sheridan Circle. Contrasting Sheridan&#x27;s fame, Early&#x27;s status declined considerably. He was accused of incompetence and mismanagement, and no longer had the confidence of his subordinates. Portions of his army were recalled to Richmond. On March 2, 1865, Early and the remnants of his army were defeated by Custer in the Battle of Waynesboro, and the Army of the Valley ceased to exist. Although Early escaped, his artillery, wagons, and headquarters equipment were captured—and his men were captured, killed, or scattered to the countryside.

===Battlefield preservation===

Portions of the Cedar Creek battlefield are preserved as part of Cedar Creek and Belle Grove National Historical Park, established in 2002. The park encompasses about across three counties, and has trails, exhibits, and the Belle Grove Plantation Manor House. Belle Grove, built in the 1790s by the brother-in-law of future President James Madison, was listed in the Virginia Landmarks Register on November 5, 1968. It was also listed in the National Register of Historic Places, and as a National Historic Landmark, on August 11, 1969. The American Battlefield Trust and its partners have preserved more than 729 acres of the Cedar Creek battlefield in 19 different transactions since 1996.

<text>Fresno Dome is a dominant granite dome rising in isolation above the forest of Soquel Meadow in the Sierra National Forest in Madera County, California.

The dome as known to the Mono Indians as &quot;the greeting place&quot; (&quot;wah-me-yelo&quot;). John Muir encountered Fresno Dome, calling it &quot;Wamello&quot;, in the 1870s, and used its summit to locate Fresno Grove (now known as Nelder Grove).

It is accessible by a trailhead which is a three-mile drive from the Sierra Vista Scenic Byway (part of the National Scenic Byway system). The nearest town is Bass Lake, California, to the south.

At its base, sits the Fresno Dome campground, a backwoods campground accessible only by jeep trails. The campground is a favorite spot for deer hunters and is largely empty other than during deer season. The dome offers several technical free climbs rated or better, with &quot;Guides in a Snowbank&quot; rated at 5.10a.

<doc id="906265" wikidata="Q3493770" url="?curid=906265" title="Pepsi Max">
<text>Pepsi Max (also known as Pepsi Black in some countries and Pepsi Zero in Poland) is a low-calorie, sugar-free cola, marketed by PepsiCo as an alternative to Pepsi and Diet Pepsi, except for Norway, where it is the main Pepsi flavor. Pepsi Max is available primarily in Asian, European and Australia/New Zealand markets. While Pepsi Max was released in April 1993, it did not become available in the United States (with a different formulation) until 2007. In the US this different product was renamed Pepsi Zero Sugar in 2016.

==History==

Pepsi Max debuted in Australia, the United Kingdom, and Italy on April 5, 1993. The rollout was expanded to Ireland the following September, and to France, Greece, Spain, Portugal, and the Netherlands the following December. By the end of 1994, Pepsi Max was sold in approximately twenty countries. By the end of 1995, that figure had more than doubled. The product remained unavailable in the United States until 2006 (the US, PepsiCo&#x27;s home market, and the largest consumer of carbonated soft drinks), where one of its principal ingredients had not yet been approved by the Food and Drug Administration. The ingredient—acesulfame potassium—is combined with aspartame to provide the beverage&#x27;s sweetness, whereas some other diet colas are sweetened by aspartame alone.

In early-2005, Pepsi Max Twist (with added lemon-lime flavour) joined the UK and Australian product line. In autumn 2005, &quot;Pepsi Max Punch&quot; was marketed in the UK for the festive season. Containing ginger and cinnamon, the product was similar in flavour to Pepsi Holiday Spice, a sugar-sweetened variety of Pepsi that was marketed in the US one year earlier. In late-2005 and early-2006, a coffee-flavoured variety was introduced in France, Finland, Ireland, Norway, and the UK. Known as &quot;Pepsi Max Cappuccino&quot; (&quot;Pepsi Max Coffee Cino&quot; in the UK), the product was prefigured by the similar Pepsi Kona (briefly test-marketed in the US in 1996) and Pepsi Tarik, available in Malaysia since 2005.

Pepsi Max was introduced to South Korea, Bulgaria, and the Philippines in 2006, as well as being reintroduced into Argentina in the spring of 2006 after being phased out after its launch in 1994. As well as this, Pepsi Max was introduced into Brazil, Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, Turkey and the United Arab Emirates during early 2007.
In October 2008, Pepsi announced it would be redesigning its logo and re-branding many of its products. Pepsi, Diet Pepsi, and Pepsi Max all use lower-case fonts for name brands, Mountain Dew was renamed &quot;Mtn Dew&quot;, and Diet Pepsi Max was re-branded as Pepsi Max. The brand&#x27;s blue and red globe trademark became a series of &quot;smiles&quot;, with the central white band arcing at different angles depending on the product. In the case of Pepsi Max, besides renaming the drink with its international name, the logo has a large &quot;smile&quot; likely to emphasize the North American drink&#x27;s &quot;Wake up people!&quot; advertising campaign, and also uses black in the bottom half of the globe as opposed to the more standard royal blue. The new lower-case font used on Pepsi&#x27;s products is reminiscent of the font used in Diet Pepsi&#x27;s logo from the 1960s to the mid-1980s. The website for the &quot;Wake up people!&quot; campaign now redirects to the Pepsi Refresh Project. In the UK, the cans had the &quot;Pepsi&quot; text and the new Pepsi globe (with the normal Pepsi &quot;smile&quot; and the blue bottom half, as opposed to the black half used in the US) but the &quot;Max&quot; is in the previous style.

A Pepsi Max Lime version was released in the United States in February 2010 under the name &quot;Pepsi Max Cease Fire&quot;. It was introduced in the UK in late-2011. It was cross-promoted with a new flavor series of Doritos chips called &quot;3rd Degree Burn&quot;. In July 2010, Pepsi began to change its North American branding of Pepsi Max to match the global branding. It carried a Max typography similar to that used worldwide, and rolled out a new slogan: &quot;Zero Calories. Maximum Pepsi Taste&quot;. Its formula was not changed.

In May 2011, Pepsi introduced the drink to Spain.

In 2013, Pepsi Max collaborated with English magician Steven Frayne, also known as Dynamo, as part of their &#x27;Live for Now&#x27; campaign which was launched the previous year. As part of a launch event, Dynamo was seen in London hanging from the side of a number 543 double-decker bus on its journey along Millbank, past the Houses of Parliament and across Westminster Bridge, while hundreds of passers by watched. The partnership also saw Dynamo appear in an on-pack promotion on cans and bottles of Pepsi Max during July and August, and secured 19 million unique impressions and 7 million total video views on social media.

In 2016, the drink was introduced to Venezuela. In 2017 Pepsi Max was launched in Costa Rica.

In 2017, the drink was reintroduced in Belarus, the Czech Republic, Greece, Hungary, India, Slovakia, Slovenia and Ukraine as Pepsi Black.

As of 2017 it is available as Pepsi Max in Albania, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Bosnia and Herzegovina, China, Croatia, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Iceland, Ireland, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Macedonia, Moldova, Montenegro, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, the Philippines, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Russia, Serbia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Thailand, Turkey, the United Kingdom and Venezuela.

==Product positioning==
Recent UK and Australia Pepsi Max television advertisements (as well as in several European countries) have featured the taglines &quot;Maximum taste, no sugar&quot; and &quot;Don&#x27;t worry, there&#x27;s no sugar.&quot; Some have incorporated extreme sports, as well as video games such as &quot;Motocross Mania&quot;, in an attempt to appeal to young men (in contrast to other diet cola drinks, which tend to target young women). The British advertising campaign involved retouched versions of the American &quot;Do the Dew&quot; commercials for Mountain Dew (a variant of which is sold in the UK), rebranded as &quot;Live life to the Max&quot;.

Coca-Cola Zero, a sugar-free cola from The Coca-Cola Company, is marketed in a similar manner. In the UK, some Coke Zero advertising alluded to Pepsi Max, leading to a counter-campaign by Pepsi extolling the virtues of the concept of &quot;maximum&quot; over that of &quot;zero&quot;.

===Variants===
The Pepsi Max brand has seen many flavor variants and varieties across the world where the drink is marketed.

===Pepsi Max===

In early 2005, the North American drink Pepsi ONE was revised, with Splenda brand sucralose replacing the aspartame ingredient.

==Historical Canadian formulation==
Beginning in early 1994, an entirely different Pepsi Max was marketed in Canada. Now regarded as a precursor to Pepsi Edge, it was sweetened with a combination of aspartame and high fructose corn syrup. As a result, it contained two-thirds fewer calories than full-sugar colas (including regular Pepsi), but more calories than conventional diet/light colas (or the version of Pepsi Max sold elsewhere). The Canadian product was discontinued in 2002; the Diet Pepsi Max product was introduced in 2008 has no direct relationship to the earlier formulation.

<text>Lotus Word Pro is a word processor produced by IBM&#x27;s Lotus Software group for use on Microsoft Windows-compatible computers and on IBM OS/2 Warp. Word Pro was available as part of the Lotus SmartSuite office suite.

Word Pro was based upon Ami Pro (originally published by Samna), but was substantially rewritten (including a new native document format). The predecessor to Ami Pro, [[Amí]], was released in 1988, and was the first fully functional Windows word processor. (The Windows version of Microsoft Word did not debut until early 1989.) Shortly after the release of Amí, the development team added support for tables and renamed the product Ami Pro.

Lotus obtained Ami Pro to round out their office suite by acquiring Samna in 1990. Lotus continued to develop Ami Pro further with version 3 released in 1992. Version 3.1 is the last version of Ami Pro released (all versions were 16 bit). The Windows versions of Ami Pro were also bundled with Adobe Type Manager for Windows, as Windows had poor support for scalable fonts before the introduction of TrueType.

In 1994, Joe Guthridge was one of seven awarded the Windows Pioneer Award for feedback which the Ami development team gave to Microsoft during the early development of Windows.

<doc id="906281" wikidata="Q1069127" url="?curid=906281" title="Lapsed Catholic">
<text>A lapsed Catholic is a Catholic who is non-practicing. Such a person may still identify as a Catholic, and remains one according to Catholic canon law.

== Interpretations ==

The Merriam-Webster Dictionary definition of &quot;lapsed&quot; in relation to &quot;lapsed Catholic&quot; is &quot;no longer believing or following the teachings of a religion&quot;. The Oxford American Writer&#x27;s Thesaurus associates the term &quot;lapsed Catholic&quot; as one who is backsliding. Lapsing is thus not necessarily connected with a lack of belief. However, author Daniel Ford links being a lapsed Catholic with rejection of Catholic teaching, either totally or by being an &quot;à la carte Catholic&quot;.

Other sources associate the term with abandonment of practice of the Catholic religion rather than with rejection of its doctrine. Thus the Cambridge Advanced Learner&#x27;s Dictionary defines &quot;lapsed&quot;, again in relation to &quot;lapsed Catholic&quot;, as &quot;no longer involved in an activity or organization&quot;, and the Oxford Dictionary speaks only of &quot;no longer following the rules and practices of a religion or doctrine&quot;.

Richard John Neuhaus distinguished between Catholic and Protestant ideas of what it means to be &quot;lapsed&quot; by quoting G.K. Chesterton, who remarked that a Protestant typically says he is a good Protestant, while a Catholic typically says he is a bad Catholic. For many, being a lapsed Catholic is just another way of being a Catholic.

==Catholic teaching on membership in the Church==
According to Catholic belief, baptism &quot;seals the Christian with the indelible spiritual mark of belonging to Christ. No sin can erase this mark, even if sin prevents baptism from bearing the fruits of salvation.&quot;

Even the form of censure known as excommunication does not erase this sacramental character of their baptism; but excommunicated persons are &quot;cut off from the Church&quot;, barred from receiving the Eucharist and all other sacraments, and from taking an active part in the liturgy (reading, serving at the altar, etc.).

== History ==

In the time of the persecution of Christians in the Roman Empire, many Christians, including clergy and even some bishops, were referred to as the &quot;lapsi&quot; (those who had slipped and fallen) as opposed to the &quot;stantes&quot; (those who stood firm). Different attitudes developed within the Church towards the lapsed: some held they should never be readmitted to the Church before death, others were for demanding serious penance of them before readmitting them, while others again were still more lenient. The First Council of Nicaea insisted that any clergy who had lapsed were not to be readmitted to clerical rank.

From 1983, a formal act of defection from the Catholic Church was recognised in the 1983 &quot;Code of Canon Law&quot;, making defectors ineligible for the privileges of membership of the Church, such as marrying in church. This form of defection was removed from the Code in 2009.

In the religion question on the Republic of Ireland census, &quot;lapsed (Roman) Catholic&quot; (a write-in option rather than a pre-printed checkbox option) was collated separately for the first time in 2011, when 1,268 were recorded (0.033% of the &quot;Roman Catholic&quot; total); the 2016 census recorded 8,094 (0.21%).

== Present canon law ==

Today, a Latin Catholic who lapses to the extent of becoming an apostate, a heretic or a schismatic is automatically excommunicated; and, until the excommunication is lifted, is forbidden to have any ministerial part in the celebration of Mass or other worship ceremonies, to celebrate or receive the sacraments or to exercise any Church functions. This is an obligation that binds the excommunicated person. Unless the excommunication has been publicly declared by the Church and not merely incurred automatically, the excommunicated person cannot on that ground alone be publicly refused the sacraments, even by a priest who knows of it. However, to assist at the marriage of someone who has &quot;notoriously&quot; (i.e. widely known to have done so) rejected the Catholic faith, a priest needs the permission of the ordinary and the same promises required by spouses in mixed marriages are also required.

The 1983 &quot;Code of Canon Law&quot; lays down no particular penalty for a lapse in one&#x27;s religious duties as a Catholic that consist in failure to attend Sunday Mass and failure to receive Communion during Eastertide other than a recommendation toward penance and reconciliation.

Of course none of this prevents an individual who was baptised a Catholic from completely ignoring the Catholic Church&#x27;s laws or ideas and not disclosing their personal views or beliefs. As a consequence the lapsing of a person to become an apostate is neither obvious nor can it follow that they are automatically excommunicated. In a sense it highlights the dichotomy of religious law which may be completely disregarded without effective penalty (whether that would be justified or not).

==Colloquial names==
Some lapsed Catholics attend Mass on special occasions like Christmas and Easter. Such lapsed Catholics are colloquially and sometimes derogatorily called &quot;Cultural Catholics&quot; or &quot;A&amp;P Catholics&quot; (for Ash Wednesday and Palm Sunday).

&quot;Cultural Catholic&quot; is also used to refer to a non-religious member of a historically Catholic ethnic group: Hungarian, Polish.

<text>The U.S. Labor Party (USLP) was an American political party formed in 1973 by the National Caucus of Labor Committees (NCLC). It served as a vehicle for Lyndon LaRouche to run for President of the United States in 1976, but it also sponsored many candidates for local offices as well as congressional and Senate seats between 1972 and 1979. After that the political arm of the NCLC was the National Democratic Policy Committee. The party was the subject of a number of controversies and lawsuits during its short existence.

== Party objectives and ideology==
At first the party was leftist, &quot;preaching Marxist revolution.&quot; A state leader described the aims of the party and its organ, &quot;New Solidarity&quot;, as supporting the working class against capitalism, Nelson Rockefeller, and Leonard Woodcock, head of the United Auto Workers. The USLP predicted collapse of the monetary system by November 1976 and thermonuclear war by 1977. It opposed the Rockefeller family and had a reputation for harassing the Communist Party, the United Auto Workers, and other political foes. In a 1974 interview, the USLP candidate for Governor of Michigan characterized the Watergate scandal as a &quot;deliberate attempt&quot; to discredit Richard Nixon and weaken the presidency. By 1977 the party had shifted from the left to politics of the extreme right, though mixed disparate policies and ideas from both sides made the party overall syncretic.

== History ==

===1972–1976===
The U.S. Labor Party was noted for its controversial campaign tactics, and its invective campaigns against other politicians. Nelson Rockefeller, the former Governor of New York who was nominated to be vice president by Gerald Ford in 1974, was an early target of the USLP&#x27;s attention. During the Senate&#x27;s confirmation hearings, LaRouche appeared on behalf of the USLP as a witness against Rockefeller&#x27;s nomination. He testified that a USLP survey showed 90 percent of U.S. workers and the unemployed hated Rockefeller.

In 1974 the Wisconsin branch of the Labor Party took out a newspaper advertisement announcing that it had filed for an injunction to prevent the CIA, FBI, and the New York Police Department from arresting Lyndon LaRouche (then known as Lyn Marcus) or anyone involved in the movement&#x27;s kidnapping of Christopher White, who had married LaRouche&#x27;s former common-law wife. According to detailed descriptions by LaRouche, White had been brainwashed by the CIA and KGB to kill him. The advertisement further reported that the movement had found a cure for psychosis and encouraged mental health professionals to contact them to develop this discovery. USLP member Harley Schlanger, a candidate for the House of Representatives, sued the Mecklenburg County, North Carolina, ABC Board in August 1976, for prohibiting campaigning on their property, which he contended was public property. The North Carolina ACLU joined the suit. The district court judge decided that the activity was protected free speech that could not be prohibited so long as activists did not block doorways.

One of the U.S. Labor Party&#x27;s strategies focused on disrupting other left-wing groups, with questionable success. William Chapman wrote in &quot;The Washington Post&quot; in September 1976 that several public figures on the left had reported threats and intimidation, and said those responsible had identified themselves as members of LaRouche&#x27;s NCLC or U.S. Labor Party. The linguist and political activist Noam Chomsky was accused of working for the CIA and being a tool of the Rockefellers; meetings he addressed were disrupted, and threats were made. The philosopher Paul Kurtz, editor of &quot;The Humanist&quot;, was asked during his lectures at the State University of New York why he was practicing genocide. According to Chapman, sociologists Richard Cloward and Frances Fox Piven, specialists on urban poverty, were followed around the country having their speaking tours disrupted. Environmentalist Lester Brown was accused of genocide and told he would be hanged from a lamppost. LaRouche was asked how he expected a party with a five-year record of harassment and threats to win the election; he did not deny the incidents, but replied, &quot;We are only engaged in an open political attack. We just want to challenge them in debate.&quot; He denied however that anyone had been threatened with physical harm: &quot;Sure, we&#x27;re going to get them – but politically.&quot;

The U.S. Labor Party was well financed, operating from the top floor of a building in New York&#x27;s garment district. A teletype network connected the New York office to branches in a further 13 U.S. cities, and also included a two-way, 24-hour link to Wiesbaden, Germany. Membership was small, ranging from 20 to 100 people per city, with a core of 1,000 to 1,800 members; according to LaRouche, these were complemented by another 13,000 part-time party organizers. LaRouche said the party was funded by members&#x27; dues, other small contributions, and the sale of publications like &quot;The Campaigner&quot; and &quot;New Solidarity&quot; – one a theoretical journal, the other a twice-weekly newspaper. The party fielded candidates in local and congressional elections, generally garnering only insignificant percentages of the popular vote; but there were exceptions – in Seattle, a Labor Party member running for the city council won 27 percent of the vote, with another candidate who ran for city treasurer garnering 20 percent.

===Presidential campaign===
In an appearance on &quot;Meet the Press&quot; with other minor party candidates in October 1976, LaRouche predicted monetary collapse followed by thermonuclear war before summer if Jimmy Carter were elected. LaRouche also described Carter as &quot;a nitwit to begin with, an empty slop jar into which bad lemonade is being poured.&quot; However, conservative Republicans like President Ford fared better, incongruously so, given the Labor Party&#x27;s stated left-wing stance. &quot;I call them honest Americans&quot;, LaRouche said. He described Ford as &quot;weak but well-meaning&quot; and &quot;a known quantity we can live with&quot;.

On November 1, the eve of the election, the USLP purchased a half-hour block of time on NBC, the first of many national broadcasts by LaRouche that would follow in election years to come. The time was purchased over the objection of the network which unsuccessfully appealed the last-minute purchase to the Federal Election Commission. During the broadcast, which ran opposite a similar advertisement from Carter on another network, LaRouche said that Carter would have the U.S &quot;irreversibly committed to nuclear war by no later than the Summer of 1977&quot; if elected. According to LaRouche&#x27;s autobiography, he

NBC reported receiving hundreds of calls protesting the broadcast.

LaRouche&#x27;s name was on the ballot in 23 states plus the District of Columbia on November 2, 1976. He received 40,043 votes (0.05%). U.S. Labor Party candidates sometimes received unusually high vote totals in comparison with those garnered by other small ideologically-based parties.

Following the election, the USLP brought lawsuits in three states challenging Carter&#x27;s victory. The Republican Party joined the suits in Ohio and New York. Regional coordinator Paul Greenberg sought a recount in Milwaukee, saying &quot;the election has actually been stolen — the actual winner was probably Jerry Ford.&quot;

For more information on LaRouche&#x27;s 1976 presidential campaign and the movement&#x27;s legal disputes with the FEC, see Lyndon LaRouche U.S. Presidential campaigns.

===1977–1982===
In August 1977, the USLP said that the Federal Election Commission (FEC) was intentionally harassing the group as a result of a determination that forgiven debts were the equivalent of campaign contributions. The same month the USLP hired a former OSS and CIA operative, mercenary, firearms engineer and arms dealer, Colonel Mitch WerBell, to protect LaRouche. They said that LaRouche, then living in Wiesbaden, Germany, was being targeted for assassination by the &quot;Baader-Meinhof Gang&quot;, allegedly on behalf of the Carter administration. Werbell in turn recruited the chief of police from his town, Powder Springs, Georgia, to set up the security.

In 1978, LaRouche began a vigorous USLP campaign for the presidency in 1980, targeting farmers, small businessmen and Teamsters Union members in the Heartland states.

In May 1978, USLP Steering Committee member Elliott Eisenberg campaigned in a Chicago suburb, saying that &quot;the reason we picked Schaumburg is because it&#x27;s a relatively conservative area ... There&#x27;s more of a tendency for people to support nuclear power.&quot;

The USLP vice-presidential candidate, Khushro Ghandhi, campaigned in June 1979 and predicted victory based on support from the Teamsters (a faction of the union had ties to LaRouche). Running on a pro-nuclear power platform, Ghandhi said that the recent Three Mile Island accident was ordered by Energy Secretary James R. Schlesinger in order to create a false energy crisis.

By late summer of 1979 the NCLC and LaRouche had decided to join the Democratic Party so that LaRouche could run for that party&#x27;s presidential nomination, and the U.S. Labor Party was disbanded. 
In 1982 the USLP was sued for $1.5 million in damages by &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; when one of its employees allegedly impersonated a reporter. The magazine won an injunction against the party publications. Lyndon LaRouche, when asked about the matter, said, &quot;I don&#x27;t know anything about it and I never looked into it, but I do know that the liberal press uses undercover press practices that are abhorrent and beneath description.&quot;

===Far-right contacts===
The U.S. Labor Party had contacts with several notable figures on the extreme right wing of American politics. By the late 1970s, members were exchanging almost daily information with Roy Frankhouser, a government informant and infiltrator of both far right and far left groups who was involved with the Ku Klux Klan and the American Nazi Party. The LaRouche organization believed Frankhouser to be a federal agent who had been assigned to infiltrate right-wing and left-wing groups, and that he had evidence that these groups were actually being manipulated or controlled by the FBI and other agencies. LaRouche and his associates considered Frankhouser to be a valuable intelligence contact, and took his links to racist and anti-Semitic groups to be a cover for his intelligence work. Frankhouser played into these expectations, misrepresenting himself as a conduit for communications to LaRouche from &quot;Mr. Ed&quot;, an alleged CIA contact, who did not exist. Frankhouser was convicted in 1975 of conspiring to sell half a ton of dynamite in connection with a school bus bombing that left one man dead, and had marched on Fifth Avenue in New York wearing a Gestapo uniform. LaRouche had organized his defense campaign regarding the dynamite charges. Frankhouser asserted he was working for the government and was sentenced to five years of probation instead of the decades in prison he could have received.

Frankhouser warned LaRouche in 1977 that, according to his claimed CIA contact &quot;Mr. Ed&quot;, he was being considered for assassination, and introduced him to Mitchell WerBell III, a noted Office of Strategic Services (OSS) and Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) operative, mercenary, operator of a counterterrorism school, accused drug trafficker, firearms engineer, and arms dealer who said he had an ongoing connection to the CIA. LaRouche developed close ties with WerBell, hiring him as a security consultant for protection against the assumed assassination threat and to train his security staff. It was WerBell who arranged for LaRouche movement members to undergo anti-terrorist training. John George and Laird Wilcox say WerBell learned that the way to keep &quot;LaRouche on the hook was to feed his monstrous ego while jerking his paranoia chain&quot;.

Frankhouser cultivated a contact with a media source in New York, enabling him to tip off LaRouche about upcoming stories before they became public. In 1979, Frankhouser was also placed on the payroll as a security consultant, having convinced LaRouche that he was actively connected to U.S. intelligence agencies. A government official later said that Frankhouser was one of the few people who could call LaRouche directly. Forrest Lee Fick, an associate of Frankhouser from the KKK, was added as a consultant in 1982. Fick helped Frankhouser, who was not a competent writer, to compose the memos from &quot;Mr. Ed&quot;; they appeared so authentic that when news about them began to leak out via defectors from LaRouche&#x27;s security organization, journalists began to speculate about the identity of &quot;Mr. Ed&quot;. Frankhouser and Fick later testified that, to justify their $700-per-week paychecks, they had invented their connections to the CIA, written memos purporting to be from CIA agents, and warned of imaginary assassination plots against the LaRouches. George and Wilcox called Frankhouser&#x27;s deception &quot;one of the biggest hoaxes in the annals of political extremism&quot;, made possible by what they called LaRouche&#x27;s &quot;obsession with conspiracy theories&quot; and intelligence gathering.

The USLP also had brief contact with the Liberty Lobby led by Willis Carto. Carto had some exploratory talks with LaRouche about a joint strategy against the IRS, but the contact was marked by much mutual suspicion. Carto was troubled by the number of Jews in the U.S. Labor Party, and by their adherence to basic socialist positions, including their support for central banking, while Labor Party members considered people in the Liberty Lobby &quot;red-necks&quot; and &quot;idiots&quot;.

==Criticism==
In 1979, a two-part article by Howard Blum and Paul L. Montgomery appeared in the &quot;New York Times&quot; that accused LaRouche of running a cult. Blum wrote that LaRouche had turned the U.S. Labor Party—with 1,000 members listed in 37 offices in North America, and 26 in Europe and Latin America—into an extreme-right, anti-Semitic organization, despite the presence of Jewish members. The &quot;Times&quot; alleged that members had taken courses in how to use knives and rifles, and had produced reports for South Africa on anti-apartheid groups in the United States. A farm in upstate New York was allegedly being used for guerrilla training, attended by LaRouche members from Germany and Mexico. Several members also underwent a six-day anti-terrorist training course, at a cost of $200 per person per day, at a camp in Powder Springs, Georgia, run by WerBell.

The &quot;Times&quot; reported that U.S. Labor Party members were playing a dominant role in a number of companies in Manhattan: Computron Technologies Corporation, which included Mobil Oil and Citibank among its clients; World Composition Services, which the Times wrote had one of the most advanced typesetting complexes in the city and had the Ford Foundation among its clients; and PMR Associates, a printing shop that produced the party&#x27;s publications and some high school newspapers (see below).

Blum wrote that, from 1976 onwards, party members were transmitting intelligence reports on left-wing members to the FBI and local police. In 1977, he wrote, commercial reports on U.S. anti-apartheid groups were prepared by LaRouche members for the South African government, student dissidents were reported to the Shah of Iran&#x27;s Savak secret police, and the anti-nuclear movement was investigated on behalf of power companies. He also wrote that LaRouche was telling his membership several times a year that he was being targeted for assassination, including by the Queen, &quot;big-time Zionist mobsters,&quot; the Council on Foreign Relations, the Justice Department, and the Mossad.

LaRouche denied the newspaper&#x27;s charges, and said he had filed a $100 million libel suit. His press secretary said the series was intended &quot;to set up a credible climate for an assassination hit&quot;.

The USLP has also been called a &quot;radical and cult-like group&quot;. Milton Copulos of The Heritage Foundation described the USLP as &quot;a virulently anti-Semitic outgrowth of the Students for a Democratic Society (SDS)&quot; which used the Fusion Energy Foundation as a front to &quot;win the confidence of unsuspecting businessmen&quot;. &quot;Washington Post&quot; columnist Richard Cohen wrote that the USLP began &quot;on the political left but has since gone so far in the opposite direction that to call it politically right is to slander the entire conservative movement&quot;. Labor-union journalist Victor Riesel, while writing of &quot;anti-capitalistic movements, ranging all the way from the Communist Party U.S.A. to the Trotskyite Socialist Workers&#x27; Party&quot;, said in 1976 &quot;the most extreme activists in this sprawling radicalism are the youthful U.S. Labor Party&quot;. Civil Rights activist Julian Bond called the party &quot;a group of leftwing fascists&quot;.

LaRouche critic and biographer Dennis King says that when the USLP sponsored LaRouche&#x27;s 1976 campaign, the NCLC was still in transition from a far-left to far-right ideology but by 1977-1978 both organizations (which were really one and the same for all essential purposes) were advocating extreme-right positions. King described a typical post-transition USLP campaign in &quot;Lyndon LaRouche and the New American Fascism&quot; (Doubleday, 1989):
In Baltimore, USLP candidate Debra Freeman appealed openly to racist and anti-Semitic sentiments in her 1978 campaign against incumbent Congressman Parren Mitchell, chairman of the Black Congressional Caucus. Freeman, who is white, described Mitchell as a &#x27;house nigger&#x27; for Baltimore&#x27;s &#x27;Zionists&#x27; and an example of &#x27;bestiality&#x27; in politics...She won more than 11 percent of the vote, doing especially well in several white precincts.
The NCLC had used similar language as early as 1974, when an alderman in Madison, Wisconsin, was called a &quot;house nigger&quot; at a city-council meeting. According to Dennis King, the USLP chairman advocated launching ABC (atomic, biological and chemical) warfare against the Soviet Union as well as the military crushing of Britain (which his newspaper described as the headquarters of the &quot;Zionist-British organism&quot;).

==National Democratic Policy Committee==

After the 1980 campaign, LaRouche established the National Democratic Policy Committee as a vehicle for his and his followers, candidacies.&quot; Claiming 2,600 members, the NDPC is a source of considerable dismay within the Democratic National Committee, with which it is often confused. It also indicates LaRouche&#x27;s new strategy, which is to represent himself as a &quot;conservative Democrat.&quot; In fact, it is merely the successor of the now defunct U.S. Labor Party as LaRouche&#x27;s political arm. and is regarded as the successor to the USLP. LaRouche&#x27;s politics were not shared by many in the Democratic Party, allowing him to occupy a niche with little competition. A number of state and local candidates have been fielded from within the NDPC&#x27;s ranks over the past several years. Included among them are Mel Klenetsky, LaRouche&#x27;s campaign manager, who ran for Mayor of New York, and William Wertz who ran for the U.S. Senate from California in 1982.&quot;

<text>Lois Ruth Maxwell (née Hooker; February 14, 1927 – September 29, 2007) was a Canadian actress. She was best known for portraying Miss Moneypenny in the first 14 Eon-produced &quot;James Bond&quot; films (1962–1985), from &quot;Dr. No&quot; in 1962 to &quot;A View to a Kill&quot; in 1985.

Maxwell graduated from the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in England and began her film career in the late 1940s, winning the inaugural Golden Globe Award for Most Promising Newcomer – Actress for her performance in &quot;That Hagen Girl&quot; (1947). Dissatisfied with the quality and prominence of roles, she moved to Rome in the following decade, working in Italian cinema as both an actress and dubber. 

After her marriage, she moved to the United Kingdom, where she appeared in several television productions and was eventually cast as Moneypenny. She did not appear in the 1967 adaptation of &quot;Casino Royale&quot;, and in the 1983 remake of &quot;Thunderball&quot;, &quot;Never Say Never Again&quot;, as neither of the productions was Eon&#x27;s, though she did, as a similar character, appear in the spoofs &quot;O.K. Connery&quot; and &quot;From Hong Kong with Love&quot;.

== Early life and education ==
Maxwell was born in Kitchener, Ontario, to Ruth Adelaide Wells, a nurse, and William Victor Hooker, a teacher. Maxwell was raised in Toronto and attended Lawrence Park Collegiate Institute. She gained her first job working as a waitress at Bigwin Inn, a summer resort on Bigwin Island in Lake of Bays, Ontario.

During World War II she ran away from home, aged 15, to join the Canadian Women&#x27;s Army Corps, formed to release men for combat duties. CWAC personnel were secretaries, vehicle drivers, and mechanics, who performed every conceivable noncombat duty. Maxwell quickly became part of the Army Show in Canada. Later, as part of the Canadian Auxiliary Services Entertainment Unit, she was posted to the United Kingdom, where she performed music and dance numbers to entertain the troops, often appearing alongside Canadian comedians Wayne and Shuster.

Maxwell&#x27;s true age was discovered when the group reached London. To avoid her being repatriated to Canada, she was discharged; she subsequently enrolled at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, where she became friends with fellow student Roger Moore. Moore was later her on-screen colleague, in the &quot;James Bond&quot; film series, from &quot;Live and Let Die&quot; (1973) to &quot;A View to a Kill&quot; (1985).

== Career ==
Maxwell made her first film appearances in 1946, appearing (uncredited) in the British films &quot;A Matter of Life and Death&quot; (directed by Powell and Pressburger) and &quot;Spring Song&quot;. It was at this time that she changed her surname from Hooker to Maxwell, a name borrowed from a ballet dancer friend. The rest of her family also took this name.

Moving to Hollywood at the age of 20, Maxwell won the actress Golden Globe Award for Most Promising Newcomer for her role in the Shirley Temple-Ronald Reagan drama &quot;That Hagen Girl&quot; (1947). In 1949, she participated in a later famous &quot;Life&quot; magazine photo layout, in which she posed with other up-and-coming actresses, Marilyn Monroe, Cathy Downs, Suzanne Dalbert, Enrica Soma, Laurette Luez and Jane Nigh. 

Despite her early acclaim, most of Maxwell&#x27;s subsequent work consisted of minor roles in B films. Tiring of Hollywood, she moved back to Europe in 1950, living in Rome for the next five years. There she made a series of films, and at one point became an amateur race driver. One of her Italian films was an adaptation of the opera &quot;Aida&quot; (1953), in which Maxwell played a leading role, lip-synching to another woman&#x27;s vocals and appearing in several scenes with the then unknown Sophia Loren. Other notable Italian films were &quot;Tomorrow Is Too Late&quot;, with Pier Angeli and Vittorio De Sica, which won Best Italian Film at the 1950 Venice Film Festival. She also worked as an English-language dubber.

While visiting Paris, she met her future husband, TV executive Peter Marriott. They married in 1957 and moved to London, where their daughter Melinda and son Christian were both born (in 1958 and 1959). Maxwell appeared with Patrick McGoohan in the British television series &quot;Danger Man&quot; as his accomplice in the 1959 episode &quot;Position of Trust&quot;.

During the 1960s, Maxwell appeared in many TV series and in films outside the Bond series, in both the UK and Canada. She guest-starred in two episodes of &quot;The Saint&quot; and later in one episode of &quot;The Persuaders!&quot;; in both of which she appeared alongside Roger Moore. She provided the voice of Atlanta for the Supermarionation science-fiction children&#x27;s series &quot;Stingray&quot; and starred in the CBC series &quot;Adventures in Rainbow Country&quot; from 1970 to 1971.

Maxwell had a minor role as a nurse in Stanley Kubrick&#x27;s &quot;Lolita&quot; (1962). In 1963 Maxwell played a machine gun-firing nurse in the series &quot;The Avengers&quot; (episode &quot;The Little Wonders&quot;, which was first aired on 11 January 1964). She had a guest appearance in an episode of the ITC series &quot;The Baron&quot; (&quot;Something for a Rainy Day&quot;, 1965), as an insurance investigator.

=== Role as Miss Moneypenny ===
Maxwell lobbied for a role in the James Bond film &quot;Dr. No&quot; (1962), after her husband had suffered a heart attack, and they needed the money. Director Terence Young, who had turned her down on the grounds that she &quot;looked like she smelled of soap&quot;, offered her either Miss Moneypenny or Bond&#x27;s girlfriend, Sylvia Trench, but Maxwell was uncomfortable with the idea of a revealing scene outlined in the screenplay. The role as M&#x27;s secretary guaranteed just two days&#x27; work at a rate of £100 per day, and Maxwell supplied her own clothes for the filming.

She played Moneypenny in the first 14 Eon Bond films: &quot;Dr. No&quot; (1962), &quot;From Russia with Love&quot; (1963), &quot;Goldfinger&quot; (1964), &quot;Thunderball&quot; (1965), &quot;You Only Live Twice&quot; (1967), &quot;On Her Majesty&#x27;s Secret Service&quot; (1969), &quot;Diamonds Are Forever&quot; (1971), &quot;Live and Let Die&quot; (1973), &quot;The Man with the Golden Gun&quot; (1974), &quot;The Spy Who Loved Me&quot; (1977), &quot;Moonraker&quot; (1979), &quot;For Your Eyes Only&quot; (1981), &quot;Octopussy&quot; (1983), and &quot;A View to a Kill&quot; (1985).

Maxwell appeared in the Italian spy spoof &quot;O. K. Connery&quot; in 1967, with Bernard Lee (who played M) and Sean Connery&#x27;s brother Neil. In the same year, she portrayed Moneypenny in a made-for-TV special, &quot;Welcome to Japan, Mr. Bond&quot;, in which she co-starred with Kate O&#x27;Mara and Desmond Llewelyn.

The role of Moneypenny was nearly recast after Maxwell demanded a pay raise for &quot;Diamonds Are Forever&quot; (1971). However, the producers felt it important to incorporate the regular character, and it was ultimately decided during production to add the scene where, disguised as a customs officer, she gives Bond his travel documents at the Port of Dover. Maxwell and Sean Connery filmed their lines separately and were not present together for the short scene. Moneypenny&#x27;s undercover policewoman&#x27;s cap disguises the hair Maxwell had already dyed in preparation for another part.

Maxwell stayed on as Moneypenny when her former classmate Roger Moore assumed the role of 007 in &quot;Live and Let Die&quot; (1973). She reprised her character, weeping for the death of Bond, in a short scene with Bernard Lee in the French comedy &quot;Bons baisers de Hong Kong&quot; (1975).

During the filming of &quot;A View to a Kill&quot; (1985), her final appearance as Moneypenny, producer Albert R. Broccoli pointed out to her that they were the only cast or crew members from &quot;Dr. No&quot; who had not yet left the series. Maxwell asked that Moneypenny be killed off, but Broccoli recast the role instead.

According to author Tom Lisanti, Maxwell&#x27;s Moneypenny was seen as an &quot;anchor&quot;, and her flirtatious relationship with Bond provided the films with dramatic realism and humanism; for Moneypenny, Bond was &quot;unobtainable&quot;, freeing the characters to make outrageous sexual double entendres.

== Later life ==
Maxwell&#x27;s husband died in 1973, having never fully recovered from his heart attack in the 1960s. Maxwell subsequently returned to Canada, settling in Fort Erie, Ontario, where she lived on Oakes Drive. She spent her summers at a cottage outside Espanola, Ontario, where she wrote a weekly column for the &quot;Toronto Sun&quot; under the pseudonym &quot;Miss Moneypenny&quot; from 1979 until 1994, and became a businesswoman working in the textile industry. 

In 1994, she returned to the UK once again to be nearer to her daughter Melinda, retiring to a cottage in Frome, Somerset. A plaque has been placed on her home there by the Frome Society of Local Study.

== Death ==
Following surgery for colorectal cancer in 2001, Maxwell moved to Perth, Western Australia, to live with her son Christian&#x27;s family. She remained there, working on her autobiography, until her death at Fremantle Hospital on 29 September 2007.

Of his friend&#x27;s death, Sir Roger Moore said to BBC Radio 5 Live, &quot;It&#x27;s rather a shock. She was always fun and she was wonderful to be with and was absolutely perfect casting [...] It was a great pity that, after I moved out of Bond, they didn&#x27;t take her on to continue in the Timothy Dalton films. I think it was a great disappointment to her that she had not been promoted to play M. She would have been a wonderful M.&quot;

<text>The men&#x27;s 400 metre [[freestyle swimming|freestyle]] event at the 2004 Olympic Games was contested at the Olympic Aquatic Centre of the Athens Olympic Sports Complex in Athens, Greece on August 14.

Australia&#x27;s Ian Thorpe edged out his teammate Grant Hackett to defend his Olympic title in 3:43.10, despite having been disqualified for a false start from the national trials in Sydney. Hackett earned a silver in 3:43.36, just 0.01 of a second under his winning time at the trials without the presence of Thorpe. U.S. swimmer Klete Keller set a new American record of 3:44.11 to take his second Olympic bronze medal in the event. Meanwhile, another American Larsen Jensen finished outside the medals in fourth place, but came home in a lifetime best of 3:46.08, holding off Italy&#x27;s Massimiliano Rosolino by 0.17 seconds.

==Records==
Prior to this competition, the existing world and Olympic records were as follows:

== Pre-Olympic buildup ==

In late March 2004 at the Australian Championships in Sydney, the defending champion Ian Thorpe overbalanced whilst on the blocks in the heats of the 400 m freestyle and fell into the water, resulting in his disqualification and ending the defense of his Olympic 400 m title. This resulted in a large debate among the swimming and public community as to whether Thorpe should be given an exception to Australia&#x27;s policy of selecting the first and second place getters, with Prime Minister of Australia John Howard describing the situation as a &quot;tragedy&quot;. Despite the intense media spotlight, Thorpe managed to win the 100 m and 200 m freestyle events in times of 48.83s and 1 min 45.07s respectively to ensure his selection for Athens. Craig Stevens, who had claimed the second qualifying position in the 400 m event, subsequently faced immense public pressure to relinquish his position to Thorpe, and later did so in a television interview for which he was paid. This generated ethical debate as to whether Stevens&#x27; decision had been bought, and criticism against Thorpe.

Thorpe&#x27;s increasing focus on the 100 m event, coupled with the media pressure, resulted in speculation that he was vulnerable to Hackett in the 400 m event. Thorpe safely qualified for the 400 m final behind Hackett in the heats.

==Results==

===Heats===
===Final===
There was a slow start in the final, with Thorpe reaching the 100 m mark one second outside world record pace with a narrow lead. In a topsy-turvy performance at irregular pace, Thorpe was passed by Klete Keller by the 150 m mark before accelerating again to reclaim the lead by the 200 m mark. Thorpe kept Hackett and Keller at around half a body length up to the 300 m mark, before breaking to a body-length lead by 350 m. However, he could not produce his trademark finishing kick and was closed down by Hackett, holding on by only 0.26  in a time three seconds outside his own world record. Thorpe appeared to shed tears in an uncharacteristic sign of emotion, admitting afterwards that the controversy surrounding the event had taken a toll on him, but denying that any liquid had left his eyes.

<doc id="906312" wikidata="Q571317" url="?curid=906312" title="German submarine U-166 (1941)">
<text>German submarine &quot;U-166&quot; was a Type IXC U-boat of Nazi Germany&#x27;s &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; during World War II. The submarine was laid down on 6 December 1940 at the Seebeckwerft (part of Deutsche Schiff- und Maschinenbau AG, Deschimag) at Wesermünde (modern Bremerhaven) as yard number 705, launched on 1 November 1941, and commissioned on 23 March 1942 under the command of &quot;Oberleutnant zur See&quot; Hans-Günther Kuhlmann. After training with the 4th U-boat Flotilla, &quot;U-166&quot; was transferred to the 10th U-boat Flotilla for front-line service on 1 June 1942. The U-boat sailed on only two war patrols and sank four ships totalling . She was sunk on 30 July 1942 in the Gulf of Mexico.

==Design==
German Type IXC submarines were slightly larger than the original Type IXBs. &quot;U-166&quot; had a displacement of when at the surface and while submerged. The U-boat had a total length of , a pressure hull length of , a beam of , a height of , and a draught of . The submarine was powered by two MAN M 9 V 40/46 supercharged four-stroke, nine-cylinder diesel engines producing a total of for use while surfaced, and two Siemens-Schuckert 2 GU 345/34 double-acting electric motors producing a total of for use while submerged. She had two shafts and two propellers. The boat was capable of operating at depths down to .

The submarine had a maximum surface speed of and a maximum submerged speed of . When submerged, the boat could operate for at ; when surfaced, she could travel at . &quot;U-166&quot; was fitted with six torpedo tubes (four fitted at the bow and two at the stern), 22 torpedoes, one SK C/32 naval gun, 180 rounds, and a SK C/30, as well as a C/30 antiaircraft gun. The boat had a complement of 49.

==Service history==

===First patrol===
&quot;U-166&quot; first sailed from Kiel to Kristiansand, Norway, on 30–31 May 1942. The U-boat sailed on her first combat patrol, from Kristiansand on 1 June 1942, around the British Isles, and arrived at Lorient, France, 10 days later.

===Second patrol===
&quot;U-166&quot; departed from Lorient on 17 June 1942, sailed across the Atlantic and into the Gulf of Mexico.

==Fate==
On 30 July 1942, &quot;U-166&quot; torpedoed the passenger steamer SS &quot;Robert E. Lee&quot;, which was under escort from the United States Navy &quot;PC-566&quot; about south of the Mississippi River Delta. &quot;PC-566&quot; immediately attacked, making her approach vector outside the view of &quot;U-166&quot;″s periscope, and claimed to have sunk the U-boat with depth charges. Upon returning to port with the survivors of &quot;Robert E. Lee&quot;, the Navy did not believe the account provided by &quot;PC-566&quot;″s skipper LCDR Herbert G. Claudius, USNR. Claudius&#x27; tactics were criticized, resulting in his reprimand and removal from seagoing command.

On 30 July 1942, a United States Coast Guard J4F-1 Widgeon amphibious aircraft spotted a U-boat around off the coast of Houma, Louisiana. The aircraft attacked and it appeared that the U-boat was hit in the attack. &quot;U-166&quot; was reported missing in action on 30 July 1942, which coincided with the American aircraft&#x27;s attack on &quot;a U-Boat&quot;, leading to the aircraft being credited with the sinking of &quot;U-166&quot;, with the loss of all 52 crew members. Both aircraft crewmen were decorated for the action.

==Wreckage located in 2001==
In 2001, when the wreck of &quot;Robert E. Lee&quot; was located in more than of water, the wreck of &quot;U-166&quot; was also located, less than 2 miles from where it had attacked her. An archaeological survey of the seafloor prior to construction of a natural gas pipeline led to the discoveries by C &amp; C Marine archaeologists Robert A. Church and Daniel J. Warren. The sonar contacts consisted of two large sections lying roughly 500 ft apart at either end of a debris field that indicated the presence of a U-boat. Petroleum companies operating in the Gulf of Mexico&#x27;s outer continental shelf are required to provide sonar data in areas that have archaeological potential. BP and Shell sponsored additional fieldwork to record detailed images, including a gun on the deck aft of the submarine&#x27;s conning tower.

Charles &quot;C.J.&quot; Christ, from Houma, spent most of his life searching for &quot;U-166&quot; and was involved in the final identification of the U-boat.

The site where &quot;U-166&quot; lies, at , has been designated a war grave because its crew of 52 is entombed there. It is protected against any future attempts to salvage it.

Oceanographer and National Geographic Explorer-in-Residence Robert Ballard explored and mapped the wreck in the summer of 2014 with remotely operated vehicles, where they noticed that the submarine&#x27;s bow had been blown off and was found resting on the seafloor 100 feet away from the main hull. They determined that the bow of the submarine was destroyed, apparently by a depth charge that landed on the forward deck, exploded, and caused an internal detonation of the submarine&#x27;s own torpedoes, which broke off the bow. If so, this would be one of the few successful submarine kills caused by direct contact from a depth charge, as typical attacks relied upon depth charges exploding a short distance away to inflict repeated hydraulic shocks that would eventually crack a submarine&#x27;s pressure hull.

Initial credit for the sinking of &quot;U-166&quot; had been given to a Grumman G-44 Widgeon, but the position of the wreck made it clear that this should have gone to the submarine chaser &quot;PC-566&quot;. 
On 16 December 2014, the Secretary of the Navy Ray Mabus posthumously awarded the captain of &quot;PC-566&quot;, then-LCDR Herbert G. Claudius, USNR (later CAPT USN), the Legion of Merit with a Combat &quot;V&quot; device for heroism in battle and credited him with the sinking of the U-boat. &quot;Seventy years later, we now know that [Claudius&#x27;s] report after the action was absolutely correct,&quot; he said. &quot;[Claudius&#x27;s ship] did sink that U-boat, and it&#x27;s never too late to set the record straight.&quot;

Results of a study released in February 2019 showed that the wreck of &quot;U-166&quot; was being badly damaged because of the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill. Seabed bacteria, feeding on the oil, were causing the damage.

==Summary of raiding history==
==Note==
* One of the foremost authorities on the subject is Charles &quot;C.J.&quot; Christ, from Houma, who spent most of his life searching for &quot;U-166&quot;. His personal account about his search and the final locating and identification of the U-boat can be found in a local newspaper, &quot;The Houma Courier&quot;: C.J. Christ &quot;WAR IN THE GULF: German submarine, U-166, found in the Gulf of Mexico&quot; (The article can be found online as reprint by another local newspaper, &quot;The Daily Comet&quot;).

<doc id="906323" wikidata="Q1911332" url="?curid=906323" title="Maurice R. Greenberg">
<text>Maurice Raymond “Hank” Greenberg (born May 4, 1925) is an American business executive and former chairman and chief executive officer of American International Group (AIG).

==Early life and education==
Greenberg was born into a Jewish family in Greenwich Village, New York City. His father, Jacob Greenberg, died when Hank was six and his mother, Ada Rheingold, married a dairy farmer. 

Greenberg served in the United States Army in Europe during World War II, participating in Operation Overlord at Normandy, the liberation of Dachau concentration camp, and in the Korean War, rising to the rank of captain. He received the Bronze Star, and the French Legion of Honour as a result of his military service in the European theatre of World War II.

Greenberg attended the University of Miami, where he was a member of Sigma Alpha Mu fraternity, and received his bachelor&#x27;s degree in 1948. In 1950, he obtained his law degree from New York Law School. He was admitted to the New York Bar in 1953 but did not practice law. He holds honorary degrees from Brown University, Middlebury College, New York Law School, and The Rockefeller University.

==Career==
In 1962, Greenberg was named by AIG&#x27;s founder, Cornelius Vander Starr, as the head of AIG&#x27;s North American holdings after working for Continental Casualty Company, a unit of CNA in Chicago. In 1968 Starr picked Greenberg as his successor. Greenberg held the position until March 2005, when he retired from AIG and was replaced by Martin J. Sullivan. Greenberg was a social friend and client of Henry Kissinger. In 1987, he appointed Kissinger as chairman of AIG&#x27;s International Advisory Board.

In 2008, he appeared on ABC&#x27;s &quot;Good Morning America&quot;, criticizing the board of directors of AIG. In an interview with Reactions magazine in March 2010, serialized over three parts, Greenberg stated that he did not condone AIG&#x27;s strategy of selling non-core assets to pay back the United States government, and believed the terms under which AIG was provided access to bail-out funds needed to be renegotiated.

===C.V. Starr===
He is chairman and chief executive officer of C.V. Starr, a global insurance and investment organization that is named for the founder of AIG, Cornelius Vander Starr. He joined C.V. Starr as vice president in 1960 and was given the additional responsibilities of president of American Home Assurance Company in 1962. He was elected director of C.V. Starr in 1965, chairman and chief executive officer in 1968 and continues in that role. Greenberg is also the chairman of the board of directors and managing director of Starr International Company Inc. C.V. Starr and Starr International are collectively known as the Starr Companies. Greenberg was named the most connected business executive in New York by &quot;Crain&#x27;s New York Business&quot;.

In February 2014, Greenberg led a group through Starr Investment Holdings that acquired health insurance claims processor MultiPlan Inc. for around $4.4 billion. This group, on May 5, 2016, sold MultiPlan Inc. to Hellman &amp; Friedman for approximately $7.5 billion. Under Greenberg’s leadership, Starr has invested more than $1 billion in China since 2005. Starr led the IPO for the People&#x27;s Insurance Company of China (PICC), and acquired Dazhong Insurance, the first privatization of a state-owned insurance company.

===Legal issues===
In August 2009, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission charged Greenberg for his involvement in alleged fraudulent accounting transactions that inflated AIG’s finances. Without conceding or denying the SEC charges, Greenberg agreed to pay $15 million in penalties. 

The New York Attorney General brought civil fraud charges against Greenberg in May 2005, charging him with engaging in fraud to exaggerate AIG’s finances. On September 13, 2016, the fraud case against Greenberg came to trial in a state courthouse in Lower Manhattan. The New York State trial counsel said a guilty verdict was needed to &quot;send a message to CEOs of other companies&quot; that &quot;you can’t do this sort of thing.&quot; The case was resolved on February 10, 2017, subject to a settlement in which Greenberg admitted to fraud and agreed to pay $9 million.

In late 2011, Greenberg&#x27;s Starr International announced a lawsuit against the federal government. According to &quot;Reuters&quot;, the lawsuit requested $55.5 billion in damages against the government stemming from the government&#x27;s financial bailout of AIG in 2008. Following a trial in Fall 2014, the Court of Federal Claims ruled in June 2015 that the federal government acted without authority, but did not award any damages. On appeal, US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit threw out the original case, ruling that Starr lacked standing to bring the case, holding that standing belonged solely to AIG, which had not sued. The Supreme Court declined in 2018 to review the case. The market value of the 79.9% of AIG common stock the government acquired on the day the government agreed to loan AIG up to $85 billion was $55.4 billion. By the end of 2012, AIG had repaid all of its loans and the government had made a $17.7 billion profit on the AIG equity it had acquired as a result, plus $6.7 billion in interests and fees.

In November 2012, a Manhattan court dismissed Greenberg&#x27;s claims that the Federal Reserve Bank of New York breached its fiduciary duties to AIG shareholders. The ruling was upheld in appeals court in January 2014.

In July 2013 Greenberg filed a civil lawsuit against New York Attorney General Eliot Spitzer alleging that Spitzer made repeated defamatory statements against him. In November 2020, a judge dismissed Greenberg’s defamation case against Spitzer.

In December 2013, Greenberg filed a complaint with the New York State Joint Commission on Public Ethics alleging that New York State Attorney General Eric Schneiderman had violated the state&#x27;s public officer&#x27;s law by making disparaging comments about him that could potentially taint a jury selection in any trial.

==Public positions==
In 1990, Greenberg was appointed by Zhu Rongji, then Mayor of Shanghai, to be the first chairman of the International Business Leaders&#x27; Advisory Council for the Mayor of Shanghai. In 1994 Greenberg was appointed senior economic advisor to the Beijing municipal government. He was awarded &quot;Honorary Citizen of Shanghai&quot; in 1997. He is a member of the advisory board of the Tsinghua School of Economics and Management, a member of the International Advisory Council of the China Development Research Foundation and China Development Bank. Greenberg was appointed as a member of the Hong Kong Chief Executive&#x27;s Council of International Advisers from 1998 to 2005. He is a member of the US-China Business Council, honorary chair of the U.S.-China Policy Foundation and is vice-chairman of the board of directors of the National Committee on United States – China Relations. Greenberg sits on the steering committee of the China–United States Exchange Foundation. The Maurice &quot;Hank&quot; Greenberg Scholarship, administered in his name by the US-China Education Trust, supports the studies of ten Chinese students from low-income families each year at Yunnan University.

===Incident with Mahmoud Ahmadinejad===
Greenberg gained visibility when he clashed with Mahmoud Ahmadinejad over the Iranian president&#x27;s denial of the Holocaust. On September 20, 2006, the Council on Foreign Relations hosted a small meeting of select council members with Ahmadinejad, who began by saying that we need to &quot;continue studying&quot; whether it happened. According to David E. Sanger, Chief Washington Correspondent for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Greenberg listened for fifteen minutes while Ahmadinejad continued talking about the Palestinians, World War II, and if the Holocaust killings had happened at all. Sanger writes,
&quot;Then Hank Greenberg, who had been on a slow boil through the evening, spoke up. He had been a young soldier at the end of the war, and participated in the liberation of the camps. &#x27;I went through Dachau in the war and saw with my own eyes.&#x27;&quot; President Ahmadinejad responded by asking if Greenberg was old enough to have participated in the liberation of Dachau. &quot;I&#x27;d like an answer regarding whether you think the Holocaust occurred,&quot; insisted Greenberg. To which Ahmadinejad replied &quot;I think we should allow more impartial studies to be done on this.&quot;

==Political involvement==
Greenberg is a Republican donor. He donated to Mitt Romney&#x27;s presidential candidacy. 

In the 2016 Republican Party presidential primaries, he donated $10 million to support Jeb Bush&#x27;s candidacy and at a later point also donated $5 million to Conservative Solutions PAC which supported Marco Rubio&#x27;s campaign.

<doc id="906325" wikidata="Q1855185" url="?curid=906325" title="Anacyclus pyrethrum">
<text>Anacyclus pyrethrum, the pellitory, Spanish chamomile, Mount Atlas daisy, bertram, or Akarkara, is a species of flowering plant in the daisy family Asteraceae. It is native to Mediterranean Europe and parts of North Africa, but also naturalised in other parts of Europe, India and Pakistan. This herbaceous perennial resembles chamomile species in habitat and appearance. 

The plants known as pellitory-of-the-wall and spreading pellitory belong to a different family, the nettles (Urticaceae).

==Names==
Although one might assume from the specific epithet &quot;pyrethrum&quot; that this plant contains pyrethrins, it does not. Both &quot;pyrethrum&quot; and &quot;pellitory&quot; derive ultimately from the ancient Greek for &quot;fire&quot; (πῦρ).

==Cultivation==
&quot;Anacyclus pyrethrum&quot; var. &quot;depressus&quot; (sometimes considered a separate species, &quot;Anacyclus depressus&quot;), called mat daisy or Mount Atlas daisy, is grown as a spring-blooming, low-water ornamental. It produces mats of grey-green, ferny foliage and single daisy-like white flowers. It is suitable for growing in an alpine or rock garden. It has gained the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit.
==Medicinal uses==
Extracts of &quot;Anacyclus pyrethrum&quot; have anabolic activity in mice and also increase testosterone in the animal model.

Ayurveda (ancient Mesopotamian now Indian medical system) and Siddha (the real ancient medical system of India (Dravidian), have uses for this plant root and it has been used for centuries as a medicine. It is called Akkal-Kara in Hindi, Akkal Kadha in Marathi, Akkala-karra Malayalam, Akkarkkara (അകർക്കാര)(Telugu: అక్కలకఱ్ఱ) and Akkarakaaram (Tamil: அக்கரகாரம்). A kind of oil is prepared by a method known as pit extraction (Tamil: குழி எண்ணெய்).

In &quot;The Perfumed Garden&quot; (from 15th century Tunisia), al-Nefzawi recommends pelleter taken externally as an ointment on the penis and scrotum or internally to enhance sexual pleasure and enhance erection (ch. 13, 15, 17).

<doc id="906328" wikidata="Q6176333" url="?curid=906328" title="Jeffrey W. Greenberg">
<text>Jeffrey Wayne Greenberg (born 1951) is an American lawyer and business executive, who was chairman and CEO of Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies from 1999 to 2004.

==Early life and education==
Greenberg was born the son of Corinne Phyllis (née Zuckerman) and Maurice R. Greenberg, the former chairman and CEO of American International Group (AIG). He attended Choate Rosemary Hall in Connecticut. He earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree from Brown University in 1973 and a JD degree from Georgetown University Law School in 1976.

==Career==
He began his career at Marsh &amp; McLennan after graduation. During the September 11 attacks, 295 staff members were killed. Greenberg was then in midtown Manhattan, at the company&#x27;s headquarters, with &quot;an unobstructed view of lower Manhattan&quot; where he witnessed &quot;smoke rising from One World Trade Center and the fireball erupt from the second tower.&quot; He then led the company&#x27;s immediate response to the crisis.

Greenberg resigned as CEO of Marsh &amp; McLennan after the firm was charged with conducting a lucrative kickback scheme by then New York State Attorney General Eliot Spitzer, who demanded management changes, stating that &quot;The leadership of that company is not a leadership I will talk to and not a leadership I will negotiate with.&quot; In 2012, the &quot;Financial Times&quot; reported that &quot;Mr. Greenberg was never charged with any wrongdoing, while Mr. Spitzer was later engulfed in a prostitute scandal.&quot;

Greenberg is chairman of the private equity firm he founded, Aquiline Holdings. He is a member of the Council on Foreign Relations, serves as a trustee of the Brookings Institution, and has served as a member of Brown University&#x27;s corporation. He has sat on the board of trustees of New York-Presbyterian Hospital since 1998.

==Personal life==
Greenberg had a 14-year relationship with journalist Nikki Finke, getting engaged in 1974 and married in 1980. The couple divorced in 1982. He later remarried and has four children.

<text>Wiryeseong () was the name of two early capitals of Baekje, one of the Three Kingdoms of Korea. Both are believed to have been in the modern-day Seoul area. According to &quot;Samguk Sagi&quot; (the oldest surviving Korean history book, written in the 12th century), Onjo, the son of Goguryeo&#x27;s founder Jumong, founded the nation of &quot;Sipje&quot; (십제, 十濟; later became &quot;Baekje&quot;) on Wiryeseong in 18 BC, while his elder brother Biryu established himself in Michuhol (미추홀, 彌鄒忽) further to the west. The location of Michuhol is usually believed to be present-day Incheon.

After some time, Biryu recognized that Michuhol&#x27;s land was too barren and saline to sustain his people, so he moved to Wiryeseong with his people (Shortly after, the name of the state is changed from &quot;Sipje&quot; to &quot;Baekje&quot;). Later, Onjo moved further south because of Malgal to the north and Lelang to the east.

The former Wiryeseong is called Habuk (north of the river) Wiryeseong and the latter is called Hanam (south of the river) Wiryeseong. The earthen walls of Pungnap Toseong and Mongchon Toseong in Songpa-gu, Seoul are believed by many to be the remains of Hanam Wiryeseong.

During the Hanseong period, Baekje grew up against Southern Mahan and Northern Chinese Commanderies including Daifang, which attempted to violate their border. In the process, Baekje modified the political systems, and expended its territory to Mahan and Hwanghae region, and it became as a regional power.

Wiryeseong served as Baekje’s capital until 475, when Goguryeo&#x27;s King Jangsu attacked Baekje and captured Wiryeseong, as well as the whole Han River area, and killing Baekje&#x27;s King Gaero. Baekje&#x27;s next king Munju moved south and set the new capital at Ungjin (modern day Gongju city).

<doc id="906331" wikidata="Q481286" url="?curid=906331" title="German submarine U-171">
<text>German submarine &quot;U-171&quot; was a Type IXC U-boat of Germany&#x27;s Kriegsmarine built for service during World War II. It was laid down on 1 December 1940 at the DeSchiMAG AG Weser yard at Bremen as yard number 1011, launched on 22 July 1941, and commissioned on 25 October 1941 under the command of Kapitänleutnant Günther Pfeffer.

After training with the 4th U-boat Flotilla, &quot;U-171&quot; was transferred to the 10th U-boat Flotilla for front-line service on 1 July 1942. It was sent to patrol in the Gulf of Mexico. It was sunk by a naval mine in the Bay of Biscay 115 days into its first and only patrol, whilst returning to Lorient in occupied France, with the loss of 22 of its crew of 54. For many years it was believed was sunk by an American aircraft in what was, in reality, an unsuccessful attack on &quot;U-171&quot; in the Gulf of Mexico.

==Design==
German Type IXC submarines were slightly larger than the original Type IXBs. &quot;U-171&quot; had a displacement of when at the surface and while submerged. The U-boat had a total length of , a pressure hull length of , a beam of , a height of , and a draught of . The submarine was powered by two MAN M 9 V 40/46 supercharged four-stroke, nine-cylinder diesel engines producing a total of for use while surfaced, two Siemens-Schuckert 2 GU 345/34 double-acting electric motors producing a total of for use while submerged. She had two shafts and two propellers. The boat was capable of operating at depths of up to .

The submarine had a maximum surface speed of and a maximum submerged speed of . When submerged, the boat could operate for at ; when surfaced, she could travel at . &quot;U-171&quot; was fitted with six torpedo tubes (four fitted at the bow and two at the stern), 22 torpedoes, one SK C/32 naval gun, 180 rounds, and a SK C/30 as well as a C/30 anti-aircraft gun. The boat had a complement of forty-eight.

==Service history==

===Patrol===
&quot;U-171&quot; departed Kiel on 17 June 1942, at the end of which it was to return to Lorient, where it would be based for future sorties. It negotiated the &#x27;gap&#x27; between Iceland and the Faroe Islands and crossed the Atlantic Ocean, entering the Gulf of Mexico.

The submarine sank the 4,351 GRT Mexican general cargo merchant ship, SS &quot;Oaxaca&quot; on 26 July 1942, at off Corpus Christi, Texas. The ship was at the time en route from New Orleans to Tampico via Veracruz. The first spread of two torpedoes missed the ship, but a second spread, also of two &quot;eels&quot; (German U-boat slang for torpedoes), was successful when one hit the port side near the fore-part of the ship. Six of the crew of 45 died.

On 1 August 1942, also in the Gulf of Mexico, &quot;U-171&quot; came under attack from a U.S. Coast Guard J4F-1 Widgeon aircraft, causing it little damage. However, for decades it was believed that the U-boat attacked that day was ; the credit for sinking &quot;U-166&quot; went to that aircraft.

The wreckage of &quot;U-166&quot; was discovered in 2001, just a short distance from its last victim, &quot;Robert E. Lee&quot;, meaning that the credit for the sinking of &quot;U-166&quot; should have gone to the U.S. Navy patrol craft, &quot;PC-566&quot;, which had reported that they believed they were successful in their depth charge attack on the submarine following the U-boat&#x27;s successful torpedoing of &quot;Robert E. Lee&quot;, but &quot;PC-566&quot; were believed by investigating officials to have missed.

Having not been sunk, as had been believed by the Allies, &quot;U-171&quot; continued its patrol. On 13 August 1942 it sank the 6,779 GRT US tanker &quot;R. M. Parker Jr.&quot; at which is about south of Isles Dernieres, Louisiana. The ship, which was carrying water ballast, was struck by two torpedoes; the submarine then surfaced and fired five rounds from its deck gun into the wreck. The whole crew of 44 survived, being picked up eight hours later by the United States Coast Guard auxiliary .

On 4 September 1942, the submarine had its final success, the Mexican tanker 6,511 GRT; again in ballast, at . This ship had evaded three spreads of two torpedoes each, before being hit by a torpedo fired from &quot;U-171&quot;″s stern tube. There were 10 dead and 24 survivors.

====Loss====
&quot;U-171&quot; was sunk at 13:00 hours on 9 October 1942 in the Bay of Biscay near Lorient, in position , by a mine. Twenty-two men died, thirty survived. Captain Günther Pfeffer (1914–1966), was one of the lucky ones.

The wrecked submarine was classified as a &quot;military cemetery&quot; in 1999 by the French authorities: divers are then warned that going inside the boat is strictly forbidden.
