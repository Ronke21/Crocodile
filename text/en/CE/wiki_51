<text>China Youth University of Political Studies () is a university in Beijing, established in 1985 by the Communist Youth League of China. Since then the university has been affiliated with the league, and the leader (First Secretary) of the league usually holds the presidency of the university. Hu Jintao, the General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party and President of China, was once the president of this university. The university&#x27;s campus is located in Xisanhuan Bei Lu (West 3rd Ring Northern Road) in Beijing. The China Youth University of Political Studies ceased operation as a public university in 2017. It is now a co-brand used by the Central School of the Communist Youth League of China (), a training school run by the Communist Youth League.

==History==

The university grew from the Central School of the Communist Youth League of China which was founded in 1948, and was a political training school serving the Communist Youth League. In 1985, as part of political reforms under the reformist administration of Hu Yaobang to convert party organs into public institutions under a public administrative structure, the Youth League School was converted to a public university, under the name of the China Youth University of Political Studies. The university began enrolling undergraduate students in 1986.

However, as part of the counter-reform measures implemented by the administration of Xi Jinping to convert public institutions back into party organs, in 2017-2018 the China Youth University of Political Studies was moved back into the control of the Communist Youth League. Its undergraduate school was merged into the University of Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. The establishment of the &quot;Central School of the Communist Youth League of China&quot; was revived under the control of the Communist Youth League, although the school will continue to be co-branded as the China Youth University of Political Studies.

==Colleges and majors==

The university is a major law and politics institute in China doing research on Marxism, Public Administration, Youth Culture and Youth Development, Social Work, Criminal Law, and Journalism. The first youth work department in China was founded in this university in 1985. The university also has the first and largest social work department (now a social work college) in mainland China.

The university provides post-graduate education in such fields as Marxism, Sociology, Criminal Law, Economic Law, Journalism, and Economics.

Until 2017, China Youth University of Political Studies focused on undergraduate education. The university had undergraduate majors such as Economics, Law, Journalism and Mass Communication, Social Work, Sociology, Social Security, Youth Work, Public Administration, Chinese Language and Literature, and Foreign Languages and Literature.

<doc id="919980" wikidata="Q1923284" url="?curid=919980" title="Daphne Blake">
<text>Daphne Blake is a fictional character in the &quot;Scooby-Doo&quot; franchise. Daphne, depicted as coming from a wealthy family, is noted for her beauty, red hair, purple heels, fashion sense, and her knack for getting into danger, hence the nickname &quot;Danger-Prone Daphne&quot;. She also serves as Fred Jones&#x27; second-in-command of the pack.

==Overview==

The Daphne character was inspired by the sophisticated teen character Thalia Menninger, as played by Tuesday Weld, from the late 1950s and early 1960s American sitcom &quot;The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis&quot;.

According to &quot;Scooby-Doo: Behind the Scenes&quot;, Daphne wanted to be both a supermodel and a detective even as a child (the latter of which disappointed her parents). Her aspirations had an effect on her personal life as she was late for dates whenever she went on mysteries with the gang; she and Fred deny the rumors that they are dating. Her father gave her and her friends the seed money to start off.

Together with her other teenage companions, Fred Jones, Velma Dinkley, Shaggy Rogers, and Shaggy&#x27;s Great Dane, Scooby-Doo, Daphne would engage in solving various mysteries. In the first series, Daphne was portrayed as the beautiful, enthusiastic, and eager to help, but occasionally clumsy and danger-prone member of the gang (hence her nickname, &quot;Danger-prone Daphne&quot;) who follows her intuition. She sometimes serves as the damsel in distress and would occasionally get kidnapped, tied up, and then left imprisoned. But as the franchise went on, she became a stronger, more independent character who could take care of herself. Daphne often uses the word &quot;Jeepers&quot; to express surprise, first using it in the &quot;Scooby Doo Where Are You!&quot; episode, &quot;What the Hex Going On?&quot;.

During the series&#x27; fourth incarnation, &quot;Scooby-Doo and Scrappy-Doo&quot;, some of the episodes focused on Daphne. In the episode, &quot;Shiver and Shake, That Demon&#x27;s a Snake&quot;, Daphne buys an idol which is cursed by a snake demon. On the sailboat, the snake demon attacks Daphne and demands an idol to return. In the episode, &quot;The Scary Sky Skeleton&quot;, Daphne is reunited with her old friend, Wendy.

In the episode, &quot;I Left My Neck in San Francisco&quot;, Daphne becomes sick. Consequently, she is unable to help the gang to solve the mystery about The Lady Vampiress of the Bay. Due to the vampiress’s look, Daphne&#x27;s unseen reflection in the mirror, the bat flying around Daphne&#x27;s bed and herself returning to bed a little later, Scooby, Shaggy and Scrappy are convinced that Daphne is a vampiress. When the vampiress is revealed to be Lefty Callahan, Scooby, Shaggy and Scrappy realize they made a mistake in suspecting Daphne. Daphne herself returns to health.

When the original Mystery Inc. group took a hiatus from the franchise in the 1980s, Daphne was initially absent too, with the series focusing on the comedy antics of Scooby, Shaggy, and Scrappy. However, when the &quot;Whodunnit?&quot; aspect returned to the series with &quot;The New Scooby and Scrappy-Doo Show&quot; (later retitled &quot;The New Scooby-Doo Mysteries)&quot;, Daphne returned, now an accomplished investigator assisted by Shaggy and the two dogs, investigating supernatural occurrences. She continued to help Scooby battle evil forces of the supernatural in the &quot;13 Ghosts of Scooby-Doo&quot; series.

In the film &quot;Scooby-Doo on Zombie Island&quot;, Daphne had a very successful investigative TV series called &quot;Coast to Coast with Daphne Blake&quot; on a fictional channel called &quot;Americana&quot;, which the show had aired on for two seasons. The producer of the show was Fred Jones.

Throughout the various incarnations of the character, there has been speculation that Daphne and Fred had an attraction toward each other. This is emphasized in many of the direct-to-video films and the TV series &quot;Scooby-Doo! Mystery Incorporated&quot;. By the time of the second season, they are shown to be actively dating, showing more of their feelings toward each other. In the first live-action &quot;Scooby-Doo&quot; film, the two initially are just friends with but as the film progresses, they begin to develop a romantic interest in each other and briefly kiss after saving Spooky Island. In the sequel &quot;Scooby-Doo 2: Monsters Unleashed&quot;, they are in a relationship.

In &quot;Scooby-Doo on Zombie Island,&quot; &quot;Scooby-Doo! and the Witch&#x27;s Ghost,&quot; and &quot;Scooby-Doo and the Cyber Chase&quot;, she wears a purple and green three-piece suit with matching shoes. In &quot;Scooby-Doo and the Alien Invaders&quot;, she wears a purple sleeveless shirt with pink shorts and purple trainers boots or shoes. She no longer wore her green scarf in &quot;What&#x27;s New, Scooby Doo?&quot;, but still had purple mini-dress, pink pantyhose and purple shoes. In &quot;Mystery Incorporated&quot; she temporary wore a black choker, long black gloves, long boots, black skirt, and a black corset exposing her navel when she became a temporary Hexgirl. 

As a child, she wears a pink sweater, red skirt, and pink pantyhose with white go-go boots, which she hates getting dirty. In &quot;The 13 Ghosts of Scooby-Doo&quot;, she wears other purple and pink clothes, such as a purple jumpsuit and a purple dress with a white belt. In &quot;Scooby-Doo&quot;, she wears various outfits, but mostly a purple/pink dress with pink knee high boots.

==In other media==
Daphne was portrayed by Sarah Michelle Gellar in the film &quot;Scooby-Doo&quot; and its sequel, &quot;Scooby-Doo 2: Monsters Unleashed&quot; and voiced in the animated series &quot;Robot Chicken&quot;. Her husband Freddie Prinze Jr. played Fred in the same films and &quot;Robot Chicken.&quot;

In these films, Daphne and Fred began a relationship in the first film that followed on through the second. Unlike the previous incarnation of the character, Gellar&#x27;s version of Daphne is trained in martial arts during Mystery Inc.&#x27;s 2-year-long departure in the first film, as she is tired of being a damsel in distress on every case that she is involved in with the gang. Coincidentally, this subversion of the damsel in distress to a strong female fighter almost mirrors Gellar&#x27;s widely recognized role of the title character in the TV series &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot;. Though in the first film, she is captured by the masked wrestler Zarkos, but she beats him in a fight at the end.

Daphne is portrayed by Kate Melton in the third film &quot;Scooby-Doo! The Mystery Begins&quot; (released as a TV film in 2009) and its sequel &quot;Scooby-Doo! Curse of the Lake Monster&quot; (which debuted in 2010) These two films are prequels to the first two live-action films and show how the gang met while in high school. Daphne is the president of the drama club at Coolsville High School and the lead in a school musical.

In &quot;Be Cool, Scooby-Doo!&quot;, Daphne develops a kooky personality and performs multiple hobbies such as doing hand puppets, beards, sleepovers, or vampires.

Amanda Seyfried voices the character for the animated film &quot;Scoob!&quot; while Mckenna Grace voices the younger version of Daphne.

On February 10, 2021, it was announced that an adult-oriented &quot;Scooby-Doo&quot; streaming television series, &quot;Velma&quot;, would be released to HBO Max, following the various members of Mystery Inc. involved in a &quot;love quadrangle&quot;, with Daphne portrayed as a foundling adopted by two mothers, with &quot;complicated feelings&quot; for Velma. In the fifth episode, it&#x27;s revealed her biological parents are part of a &quot;Captain Caveman&quot; cult.

In the second issue of &quot;The Batman &amp; Scooby-Doo Mysteries&quot; from 2022 the character temporarily took on the mantle of Batgirl.

<text>Tongdosa () is a head temple of the Jogye Order of Korean Buddhism and in the southern part of Mt. Chiseosan near Yangsan, South Gyeongsang Province, South Korea.

Tongdosa is one of the Three Jewels Temples and represents Gautama Buddha. (Haeinsa, also in South Gyeongsang Province, represents the dharma or Buddhist teachings; and Songgwangsa in South Jeolla Province represents the sangha or Buddhist community.)

Tongdosa is famous because there are no statues outside of the Buddha at the temple because the &quot;real shrines of the Buddha&quot; (relics) are preserved at Tongdosa. Courtyards at the temple are arrayed around several pagodas that house the Buddha&#x27;s relics.

==Origins==

Tongdosa was established by the monk Jajang-yulsa after returning from Tang China in 646 AD, during the reign of Queen Seondeok of Silla. It thrived throughout the Later Silla and Goryeo periods (918-1392), when Buddhism was the state religion, and remained strong even during Joseon.

Tongdosa is reputed to house several relics of the Buddha himself, including a robe, a begging bowl, and a bone from his skull, all relics that Jajang-yulsa brought back from the travels to Tang China he undertook in 636 to study with ten other monks.

Only one building, the Mahavira Hall (main Dharma worship hall), survived the Japanese invasions of Korea (1592–98) in the late 16th century; the other buildings were rebuilt later that period. In the mid 15th century at the height of its prosperity, Tongdosa is said to have had hundreds of buildings and thousands of monks. For over 1,300 years Tongdosa&#x27;s Beopdeung (temple candle) has never gone out.

===Legend===

Legend has it that at the time of Tongdosa&#x27;s founding there were nine evil dragons living in a big pond. Jajang-yulsa enjoined the dragons to leave by reciting a magic texts. They refused to leave so Jajang-yulsa inscribed the Chinese character for fire on a sheet of paper and tossed it skyward while using his long stick to splash the pond.

The water began to boil. The dragons could not endure the heat so three tried to escape and flew off, became disoriented, and died by colliding into a cliff called Yonghyeolam (&quot;dragon blood rock&quot;). Five of the dragons flew southwest into a valley now called Oryonggok (&quot;five dragon valley&quot;).

The last dragon, blinded by the heat, made a vow to Jajang-yulsa that if he spared his life and allowed him to stay in the pond forever, the blind dragon would always guard the temple. Jajang-yulsa granted the dragon&#x27;s request and the dragon was allowed to stay as protector of the temple. Nine Dragons Pond, now called Guryongji, still stands beside the main temple hall.

==Temple today==

Korea&#x27;s largest temple, Tongdosa, is often called &quot;the temple without a Buddha&quot; because it contains no outdoor statues of the Buddha; rather it is arranged around several stupas which contain Jajang-yulsa&#x27;s relics of the historical Buddha.

The road that meanders up to the temple wanders through a forest called &quot;Pine trees dancing in the wind&quot;. 65 buildings separately house a shrine for virtually every major Buddhist deity. The temple does not seem especially large because many of the buildings are dispersed throughout the surrounding mountainside. 13 hermitages can be found on the temple complex grounds. The buildings are varied in architectural style with many left unpainted or faded. One of the buildings contains a fine mural depicting a boat escorting the deceased into paradise.

A museum on the temple grounds displays an excellent collection of artwork. Today at this temple there are 19 local treasures and 794 local cultural properties.

Approaching the entrance the first bridge one sees is Samseongbanwol — Three Arch Bridge — meaning three stars and a half moon, sometimes also called the One Mind Bridge. The Chinese character is composed of four strokes; when applying the strokes to the name of the bridge, the long stroke stands for a half moon and the others, three stars.

The first gate to the temple, Iljumun, is called the One-Pillar Gate because when viewed from the side the gate appears to be supported by a single pillar. This symbolizes the support of the world and the one true path of enlightenment. Iljumun is the boundary between the spiritual world and the secular world.

The following gate is the Gate of the Guardians of the Four Directions or Four Heavenly Kings, each of whom watches over one cardinal direction. They are the protectors of the world and fighters of evil, each able to command a legion of supernatural creatures to protect the Dharma (Buddhist teachings).

Next comes the third gate of the temple, Purimun, known as the Gate of Non-Duality. The world across this gate is one of non-duality, where there is no distinction between the Buddha and human beings, being and non-being, good and evil, and fullness and emptiness. During Purimun&#x27;s long history the gate has been rebuilt many times.

The present Gate of Non-Duality was constructed in the late Joseon Dynasty and was built to line up straight with the One Pillar Gate, Guardian Gate, and Daeungjeon (main Dharma hall). The gate of Non-Duality is the left most structure in the first picture at the top of the page.

Purimun, the Gate of Non-Duality, is designated South Gyeongsang Provincial Tangible Cultural Property #252.
Tongdosa is one of five temples in Korea, known as Jeokmyeolbogung, which enshrine the relics of the Buddha that Jajang-yulsa returned from China. Tongdosa is the ‘Buddha Jewel Temple’ because it enshrines Sari Jinsin (the Buddha’s relics) in the Geumgang Gyedan (Diamond Altar), a platform for the ceremony prevailing Buddhist precepts, behind Daeungjeon (main Dharma Hall).

There is no image of the Buddha or Bodhisattvas, as is typically found in a worship hall, in Tongdosa. Instead a Buddhist altar that spans east to west inside along the front with a window, in the place of a Buddha image, looks out on the Geumgang Gyedan (Diamond Altar).

Tongdosa&#x27;s Daeungjeon is National Treasure #290.

<doc id="920010" wikidata="Q713574" url="?curid=920010" title="Electric cello">
<text>The electric cello is a type of cello that relies on electronic amplification (rather than acoustic resonance) to produce sound. An acoustic cello can be fitted with a bridge or body mounted contact pickup providing an electric signal, or a built-in pickup can be installed. A few pickups work by other principles like magnetic coil guitar type needing steel strings to work, or by an unusual pickup system employing the string itself as a linear pickup element, thus avoiding any modification of tone-producing parts on an acoustic cello.

Many electric cellos have bodies modeled after acoustic cellos, while others abandon the design completely, opting for a totally new body shape, or having little or no body at all. Most electric cellos feature a traditional endpin and knee supports, but some are supported in other ways, such as by an elongated pin for playing in the standing position, a tripod stand, strap, or strap system that allows mobility while playing the instrument. The major differentiating factor between electric cellos and acoustic cellos is that while the latter rely on an acoustically resonant soundbox, the former are amplified electronically and often have no resonant chamber at all.

Most electric cellos are driven by a piezo pickup system mounted in the bridge. Many also contain an on-board preamp, which allows the musician localized control over the sound. The number of piezo elements in use range from one to eight.
The electric cello has several advantages over acoustic cellos. One of these advantages is its capacity for sound effects, such as distortion, wah, and chorus, which allows for the creation of a huge variety of sounds and possibilities matching that of the electric guitar, electric bass and electric violin. Also, five-string and six-string models (not generally available in acoustic cellos) allow for an extended range. An electric cello with no body can be played in the high positions more easily than an acoustic. Lastly, electric cellos without a resonant body have less of a tendency for feedback than amplified acoustic cellos.

The electric cello has not yet achieved the status of the ubiquitous electric guitar, or even the widespread success of the electric violin.

<text>The Bangalore Linux Users Group (BLUG) is a Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) user group.

== History ==
Formed in 1998, the group participated in Bangalore IT.COM 1999 (now known as Bangalore IT.in), then India&#x27;s largest technology event. The Government of Karnataka gave the BLUG an entire pavilion, where it exhibited Linux-based machines showing various applications, under the motto &quot;Seeing is believing&quot;.

Over the years, the BLUG participated in a number of technology events, and from 2001 to 2004 facilitated Linux Bangalore, a FOSS event with thousands of delegates from India and abroad. The current edition of the event is called FOSS.IN.

In late 2000, the BLUG was registered as a not-for-profit society, under the Karnataka Societies Registration Act 1960.

During 2004–2005, recognising that Linux and Open Source had become mainstream technologies and did not need generic advocacy, members of the group proposed creating smaller groups in Bangalore, leading to the formation of Special Interest Groups (SIGs). Another outcome was regular Birds of a Feather (BOF) meet-ups every fortnight at locations across the city.

In February 2005, the BLUG was named the &quot;Most Popular Indian Linux User Group&quot; at the Linux Asia conference in New Delhi.

In mid-2005, the BLUG regrouped and resumed its activities, including meetings, while at the same time adopting the role of a staging platform for multiple FOSS activities, especially amongst students. From late 2005 onwards, the BLUG began an educational campaign at technical colleges, with members speaking about technical and non-technical FOSS topics at student-arranged events in colleges.

<doc id="920028" wikidata="Q7049168" url="?curid=920028" title="Nonacquiescence">
<text>In law, nonacquiescence is the intentional failure by one branch of the government to comply with the decision of another to some degree. It tends to arise only in governments that feature a strong separation of powers, such as in the United States, and is much rarer in governments where such powers are partly or wholly fused. Nonacquiescence may lead to a constitutional crisis, given certain critical situations and decisions.

The issue of nonacquiescence first came to national prominence at the beginning of the American Civil War, in the famous case of &quot;Ex parte Merryman&quot; (1861). &quot;Merryman&quot; involved the executive branch&#x27;s refusal to comply with a U.S. circuit court decision that President Abraham Lincoln&#x27;s suspension of the writ of &quot;habeas corpus&quot; was invalid.

In the United States, federal agencies might practice nonacquiescence by refusing to accept the validity of unfavorable court decisions as binding precedent. Exceptionally, the Social Security Administration and the Internal Revenue Service openly declare such conduct. 

The U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) uses the term &quot;nonacquiescence&quot; in its actions on decision to indicate that the IRS disagrees with a court ruling and will not follow its precedent nationwide. In some cases of nonacquiescence, the IRS may follow the decision&#x27;s precedent within the jurisdiction of the case in question, but not apply it in other jurisdictions.

Executive nonacquiescence has been heavily criticized by the federal courts, as well as the American Bar Association.

<doc id="920030" wikidata="Q848673" url="?curid=920030" title="Shaggy Rogers">
<text>Norville &quot;Shaggy&quot; Rogers is a fictional character and one of the main characters in the &quot;Scooby-Doo&quot; franchise. He is characterized as an amateur detective, and the long-time best friend of his dog, Scooby-Doo.

==Character description==
Shaggy has a characteristic speech pattern marked by his frequent use of the filler word &quot;like&quot; and a pubescent voice that often cracks. His catchphrase is the nonsense word &quot;Zoinks!&quot;, used to express surprise or alarm. In the show, he is the only protagonist with facial hair, which consists of a rough goatee. His signature attire consists of a baggy green V-neck T-shirt, loose maroon or brown bell-bottom pants, and black shoes. In &quot;The 13 Ghosts of Scooby-Doo&quot; and early made-for-TV films, he wore a red V-neck and blue jeans.
Like his dog Scooby, Shaggy is characterized as being able to be bribed with Scooby Snacks due to his large appetite and love for food. He and Scooby justify their hunger by insisting that &quot;Being in a constant state of terror makes us constantly hungry!&quot; in &quot;Scooby-Doo on Zombie Island&quot;. Shaggy&#x27;s favorite meal is an &quot;extra cheese pizza with pickles,&quot; as revealed in the TV film &quot;Scooby-Doo! Abracadabra-Doo&quot;. In &quot;Scooby-Doo! and the Monster of Mexico&quot;, it is revealed by Fred that the reason Shaggy eats so much (while maintaining his slender physique) is his &quot;high metabolism&quot;. However, in &quot;Scooby-Doo: Behind the Scenes&quot;, it is stated by Fred that the real reason Shaggy is so skinny is because he is a vegetarian (a reference to Casey Kasem&#x27;s veganism). The episode &quot;A Clue for Scooby-Doo&quot; from his debut series &quot;Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!&quot; revealed that his taste for unlikely foods (such as chocolate-covered hot dogs and liverwurst &quot;a la mode&quot;) is a consequence of a young Shaggy receiving a garbage disposal unit for his first toy.
In the episode &quot;Bedlam in the Big Top&quot;, he says he used to run track, and in another episode &quot;What a Night for a Knight&quot; he states that he was a gymnast – both of which explain his uncanny skills in quickly evading villains. He has been shown, in some instances, to be able to run even faster than Scooby, even when the dog is running on all fours. Shaggy is capable of impressive feats of athleticism when he is scared; however, these abilities are usually only used for comedy, with Shaggy only being capable of such feats when panicked. For example, after being scared in &quot;Scooby-Doo! Camp Scare&quot;, he shakes the iron bars of an old-fashioned jail cell so hard that they collapse.
Normally, Shaggy becomes extremely scared when faced with monsters or other frightening situations, usually displaying cowardice to a much greater degree than any other character except for Scooby. This was explained in the &quot;Legend of the Phantosaur&quot; as a possible type of panic disorder. However, on occasion, he shows courage when his friends are in serious danger. 

In the earliest produced episodes, Shaggy was actually a bit intelligent and at times was capable of solving mysteries. For example in the episode &quot;A Clue for Scooby-Doo&quot;, he correctly deduced that the ghost of Captain Cutler was actually Cutler himself by using some seaweed to imitate his beard to prove his point.

== Development ==
The four teenage lead characters of &quot;Scooby-Doo&quot; were inspired by four of the main characters from the 1959–63 American sitcom &quot;The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis&quot;, with Shaggy having been derived from the character Maynard G. Krebs, as played by Bob Denver. Maynard&#x27;s beatnik-style goatee, general appearance, and use of the word &quot;like&quot; all found their way into the character of Shaggy, with the base personality of the character updated to make him a hippie rather than a beatnik.

Casey Kasem, the first voice actor for Shaggy, said that he originally felt uncomfortable after being assigned to Shaggy. Kasem stated that while he was &quot;hip to what hippies were about&quot;, he had never before portrayed a hippie character. Kasem had wanted to voice act for Fred Jones, and Frank Welker had wanted to voice act for Shaggy. Instead, the CBS network assigned Kasem to Shaggy and Welker to Fred. Unsure what the voice of a hippie would sound like, Kasem based his vocal style and mannerisms for Shaggy on those of Dick Crenna&#x27;s character Walter Denton from the radio/television sitcom &quot;Our Miss Brooks&quot;.

Kasem stated that as he continued to voice Shaggy, the character evolved. Kasem said that the &quot;voice dynamics&quot; improved and that his laughs increasingly gained quality. He added that Shaggy in 2002 is &quot;more frightened today than he was at the beginning.&quot; Kasem convinced the producers that Shaggy should be a vegetarian, like himself, in 2002.

==Performers==

Radio disc-jockey and actor Casey Kasem created Shaggy&#x27;s voice. Kasem voiced Shaggy for 28 years, from &quot;Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!&quot; in 1969 until the &quot;Johnny Bravo&quot; crossover episode &quot;Bravo Dooby-Doo&quot; in 1997. Starting with &quot;What&#x27;s New, Scooby-Doo?&quot; in 2002 and &quot;Looney Tunes: Back in Action&quot; in 2003, Kasem resumed the role and continued to do so until his retirement in 2009. Billy West voiced the character in the film &quot;Scooby-Doo on Zombie Island&quot; (1998). Scott Innes (who has also voiced Scooby and Scrappy-Doo) voiced Shaggy in the 1999–2001 direct-to-video films, and in video games until 2009. Innes reprised Shaggy in &quot;Harvey Birdman, Attorney at Law&quot; and a DirecTV commercial featuring the Scooby gang in 2008. Scott Menville voiced Shaggy in &quot;Shaggy &amp; Scooby-Doo Get a Clue!&quot;. Upon Casey Kasem&#x27;s official retirement in 2009, Matthew Lillard (who played Shaggy in the 2002 and 2004 live-action films) took over as the main voice of Shaggy. Lillard also played Shaggy in &quot;Robot Chicken&quot; and &quot;Mad&quot;. Nick Palatas played Shaggy in the 2009 and 2010 live-action films. Will Forte voiced the character for the 2020 animated film &quot;Scoob!&quot; while Iain Armitage voices the child version of Shaggy. An alternative version of Shaggy, an African American school newspaper reporter referred to exclusively as Norville, appears in &quot;Velma&quot;.

==Background==
In most cases, Shaggy is from the fictional town of Coolsville, Ohio. When he is old enough to go to school, he adopts Scooby–Doo from the Knittingham Puppy Farm. Later on, he meets Fred Jones, Daphne Blake, and Velma Dinkley. They become friends and decide to form Mystery Incorporated. According to &quot;Scooby-Doo: Behind the Scenes&quot;, Shaggy is the one who bought the Mystery Machine and gave it its paint job.

According to &quot;Scooby-Doo: Behind the Scenes&quot;, Shaggy&#x27;s old nickname was Buzz (apparently for his buzz cut), this is until his tenth birthday. Fred says that, contrary to what people believe, Shaggy is not skinny because Scooby is always stealing his food, but rather because he is a vegetarian. But as healthy as Shaggy tries to stay, he has battled unhealthy habits such as the time he developed an addiction for Scooby Snacks for a few months. Velma calculates that he once ate exactly 45% of his body weight. This led to him starting a new hobby: collecting decorator belt buckles. Shaggy claims to have the largest collection of decorator belt buckles in the world and currently owns 653. He also states that he wears a different belt buckle for every mystery if one pays attention, the joke being that his baggy shirt always hides them.

In &quot;Scooby-Doo! Mystery Incorporated&quot;, he is from Crystal Cove along with the other members of Mystery Incorporated. His parents&#x27; names are Colton and Paula Rogers and appear to be quite well off, living in a mansion. He dates Velma for a short period during the first season.

==Other appearances==

===Television series===
Shaggy and Scooby-Doo made a non-speaking cameo in &quot;Teen Titans Go!&quot; episode entitled &quot;I See You&quot; when Cyborg and Beast Boy were rapping. Shaggy later appears in the crossover episode &quot;Cartoon Feud&quot; along with The Scooby Gang, where Control Freak forces them to compete in &quot;Family Feud&quot; with Matthew Lillard reprising the role of Shaggy.

Shaggy, along with the other 4 members of Mystery Inc., made an appearance throughout the 16th episode of the 13th season of &quot;Supernatural&quot; entitled &quot;Scoobynatural&quot; when the two lead protagonists, Sam Winchester and his brother Dean Winchester, and their accomplice, Castiel, are transported into an episode of Scooby Doo; the Supernatural episode itself is a crossover between the two franchises. Matthew Lillard voices Shaggy in the episode.

Shaggy and the Mystery Inc. Gang made appearance in &quot;Jellystone!&quot; in the episode &quot;Frankenhooky&quot; where they stop The Ghost Chasers from attacking Yogi Bear and Boo-Boo at an abandoned cheese theme park. Matthew Lillard briefly reprising the role of Shaggy.

===Films===

Shaggy and Scooby make a cameo appearance in the 2003 live-action/animated film &quot;Looney Tunes: Back in Action&quot;, where Shaggy berates Matthew Lillard over his portrayal of Shaggy in the 2002 live-action film and threatens to &quot;come after&quot; him if he screws up in the sequel.

Shaggy also appears in the 2021 film &quot;Space Jam: A New Legacy&quot;. His design is the same from the 2020 film, &quot;Scoob!&quot;
Shaggy made a brief appearance in &quot;Mortal Kombat Legends: Battle of the Realms&quot;.

===Video games===
Outside of &quot;Scooby-Doo&quot; video games, Shaggy appears as a playable character, along with Scooby, in the crossover video game &quot;Lego Dimensions&quot;. Shaggy&#x27;s character includes the Mystery Machine. Matthew Lillard reprises his role for the game. Lillard also reprises his role in the platform fighting game &quot;MultiVersus&quot;, in which Shaggy is a playable character.

===Internet memes===
In 2017, YouTube user Midya uploaded a video titled &quot;Ultra Instinct Shaggy&quot;. The video featured a clip from &quot;Scooby-Doo! Legend of the Phantosaur&quot; in which a hypnotized Shaggy fights off a gang of bikers, set to the song &quot;Kyūkyoku no Battle&quot; from the &quot;Dragon Ball Super&quot; soundtrack. The video became a popular internet meme, inspiring fan art of Shaggy as a powerful warrior akin to a &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; character. Another version of the meme involved behind-the-scenes interviews from the 2002 &quot;Scooby-Doo&quot; film with fake subtitles, in which the film&#x27;s cast would refer to &quot;Shaggy&quot; as a real person and attest to his immense, frightening power. The meme also led to a Change.org petition to add Shaggy as a DLC character in &quot;Mortal Kombat 11&quot;, which caught the attention of both &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; series co-creator Ed Boon and Matthew Lillard. Despite not appearing in the game, Shaggy would make a cameo appearance in the Warner Bros. Animation vanity card before the animated film &quot;Mortal Kombat Legends: Battle of the Realms&quot;. Shaggy&#x27;s portrayal in the crossover fighting game &quot;MultiVersus&quot; is based on the &quot;Ultra Instinct Shaggy&quot; meme.

==Marijuana usage==
Some viewers of the original &quot;Scooby-Doo&quot; believed that Shaggy smoked marijuana due to his hippie behavior and constant hunger. In a &quot;Newsweek&quot; article, Casey Kasem was asked if he had ever observed that subtext in the series, and Kasem responded that &quot;there wasn&#x27;t anything like that at all&quot;, explaining, &quot;[I] guess it&#x27;s because, I don&#x27;t know, it was a wholesome show from beginning to end.&quot; Kasem was not aware of the fan viewpoint until the interviewer brought it up. The makers of the &quot;Scooby-Doo&quot; film shot several scenes referencing Shaggy&#x27;s supposed drug use, but few of those scenes were included in the final film. One scene which made it into the film has a minor character introduce herself to Shaggy as &quot;Mary Jane&quot; (a slang term for marijuana), and he responds, &quot;Like, that is my favorite name.&quot; Matthew Lillard, the current voice of Shaggy, does not think he smokes marijuana: &quot;He just seems like that. He acts a little goofy and high, he&#x27;s lovable and scaredand just happens to have the munchies.&quot;

In an online radio interview with host Stu Shostak, series creators Joe Ruby and Ken Spears recalled that they never intended for Shaggy to be a marijuana smoker, and &quot;took umbrage&quot; at the jokes in the 2002 film. In reference to this urban legend, the 2002 first season &quot;Harvey Birdman, Attorney at Law&quot; episode &quot;Shaggy Busted&quot; revolves around Shaggy and Scooby-Doo being mistaken for recreational drug users and arrested while they are en-route to the rest of the gang, with Fred Jones hiring Harvey Birdman to successfully defend the duo, with &quot;the [opposing] prosecutor bring[ing] up questionable clips from old &quot;Scooby-Doo&quot; episodes that show the characters running through smoky rooms and pausing mid-blink so it looks like their eyelids are drooping&quot; ahead of their innocence being proven.

In &quot;Velma&quot;, &quot;Norville Rogers&quot; is introduced in the first season as Velma&#x27;s African American best friend who frequently brings up how much he hates drugs.

<doc id="920035" wikidata="Q492296" url="?curid=920035" title="His Majesty's Declaration of Abdication Act 1936">
<text>His Majesty&#x27;s Declaration of Abdication Act 1936 (1 Edw. 8. &amp; 1 Geo. 6. c. 3) is the act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom that recognised and ratified the abdication of King Edward VIII and passed succession to his brother King George VI. The act also excluded any possible future descendants of Edward from the line of succession. Edward VIII abdicated in order to marry his lover, Wallis Simpson, after facing opposition from the governments of the United Kingdom and the Dominions.

== Passage through Parliament ==
The bill was introduced by Stanley Baldwin as Prime Minister and supported by Clement Attlee as Leader of the Opposition.

Independent Labour Party MP James Maxton proposed an amendment that would have blocked the bill, arguing for the abolition of the monarchy given the turmoil and to introduce republicanism. The amendment was seconded by the ILP&#x27;s Campbell Stephen. The amendment failed 403 to 5.

==Procedure and timing==
Although Edward VIII had signed a declaration of abdication the previous day 10 December 1936 he remained king until giving royal assent to His Majesty&#x27;s Declaration of Abdication Act, which he did on 11 December, at 1.52 p.m., with the Act becoming immediately effective.

The act was passed through the British Houses of Parliament in one day, with no amendments. As the Statute of Westminster 1931 stipulated that the line of succession must remain the same throughout the Crown&#x27;s realms, the governments of some of the British Dominions Canada, Australia, the Union of South Africa, and New Zealand requested and gave their permission for the act to become part of the law of their respective realms.

The Canadian parliament later passed the Succession to the Throne Act, 1937 to ratify changes to the rules of succession in Canada and ensure consistency with the changes in the rules then in place in the United Kingdom. South Africa passed His Majesty King Edward the Eighth&#x27;s Abdication Act, 1937, which declared the abdication to have taken effect on 10 December 1936. Australia and New Zealand did not adopt the Statute of Westminster 1931 until the 1940s and did not pass their own legislation. In the Irish Free State, which had been independent from the United Kingdom as a dominion since December 1922, and in which the monarch still had some diplomatic functions, the &quot;Oireachtas&quot; (parliament) passed the Executive Authority (External Relations) Act 1936, recognising George VI as king from 12 December 1936.

<text>The East South Central states is a region constituting one of the nine U.S. Census Bureau divisions. It is located within the American South. Four states make up the division: Kentucky, Tennessee, Mississippi and Alabama. The division is one of three that together make up the larger region known as the Southern United States (the other two are the more populous South Atlantic states and the West South Central states).

Historically, the area has been colonized and influenced by the French, Spanish, British, early American, and Confederate governments. Distinct among these states, Alabama&#x27;s French culture has been preserved through the Alabama Creoles, and Kentucky&#x27;s French culture can be observed throughout Louisville. The East South Central states form the core of [[Dixie|Old Dixie]], one of the nine &quot;moral regions&quot; identified by James Patterson and Peter Kim in their acclaimed 1991 geopolitical best-seller, &quot;The Day America Told The Truth&quot;. Politically and culturally, the East South Central is more conservative than the other regions making up the American South; Mississippi, Alabama, Kentucky, and Tennessee&#x27;s governments have been described during 2012 to 2023 as some of the most conservative. Religiously, conservative Evangelical Protestantism dominates the East South Central as a central part of the Bible Belt.

==Demographics==
As of 2020, the East South Central states had a combined population of 19,430,030. The East South Central region covers 183,401 square miles of land. Within the region, Tennessee is the largest state by population, though Alabama is the largest by land area; Tennessee was also the East South Central&#x27;s fastest growing state between 2010 and 2020, with Alabama second. Kentucky was the third-fastest growing state, and Mississippi experienced population decline; despite population decline, Mississippi did increase in diversity.

<doc id="920048" wikidata="Q1140073" url="?curid=920048" title="West South Central states">
<text>The West South Central states, colloquially known as the South Central states, is a region of the United States defined by the U.S. Census Bureau as covering four states: Arkansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, and Texas. The West South Central or South Central region is located within the Southern United States and Gulf Coast regions, bordering the Mountain states and Midwestern U.S. regions to its north and west. The Gulf of Mexico is to the south of the region. Houston is the South Central&#x27;s largest city, and the Dallas–Fort Worth–Arlington metropolitan statistical area is the region&#x27;s largest metropolis.

A geographically diverse region, the southern portion of the states are covered by coastal plains and swamps, while the remainder is covered by forests such as the Cross Timbers, hills and mountains, and deserts near the Texas–Mexico border.

With European colonization of the Americas, this region of the U.S. has been heavily influenced by the French and Spanish. With American settlement, Anglo-American culture began to influence the states covering the region. Distinct from New England and the Mid-Atlantic states, and in common with the Western U.S. and South Atlantic states, the majority of its non-Anglo culture descends from the Spanish Empire and Mexico; within Louisiana, there is a significant French influence preserved through its Cajun and Louisiana Creole populations. In Oklahoma, Native American culture is prevalent through tribes such as the Cherokee and Seminole nations among others.

Within the region, Christianity is the prevalent religion as part of the Bible Belt; southern and southeastern Texas; and southern Louisiana are predominantly Roman Catholic and non- or inter-denominational Protestant, with Baptists constituting a great majority. From central and northern Texas, and central and northern Louisiana to the states of Oklahoma and Arkansas, Baptists, Methodists, and non- or inter-denominational Protestants constituted the majority.

== History ==
The history of the West South Central states is dominated by the conflict and interaction between three cultural-linguistic groups: the Anglosphere (first Great Britain and then the United States), the Hispanidad (first Spain then Mexico), and the Francophonie (France).

In the 17th and 18th centuries, Spain and France maneuvered for control of Texas, with the Spanish based in Mexico and the French in Louisiana. During the War of the Quadruple Alliance hostilities spread to the New World and the French troops from Natchitoches briefly captured the capital of Spanish Texas, Los Adaes, in what is now western Louisiana. The French were not able to wrest control of Texas from Spain, and by the early 19th century sold their North American holdings to the United States in the Louisiana Purchase, which comprised slightly less than half of what is today the West South Central United States.

During the Texas Revolution (1835–1836), a rebellion of United States immigrants and Tejanos (Texas Mexicans), put up armed resistance against the Centralist Republic of Mexico. The Battle of the Alamo was a major turning point during the Texas Revolution. This battle would lead to many Texians deciding to join the Texian Army. Texians would defeat the Mexican Army at the Battle of San Jacinto later on, leading to Texas declaring themselves an independent country in 1836, however Mexico viewed them as a rebellious province. Texas would eventually be admitted as a U.S. state in 1845.

The official West and East South Central states of Texas, Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and Tennessee would secede from the Union and join the Confederacy during the American Civil War. Kentucky was a border state that remained with the Union. Oklahoma, although Indian Territory at the time, was home to five major Native American tribes (the Five Civilized Tribes), of which the majority allied themselves with the Confederacy. Oklahoma territory and Indian Territory would merge into the state of Oklahoma when it became the 46th U.S. state in 1907. All of these states are usually considered to make up a larger part of the American South, both historically and culturally, as well as classified by the U.S. Census Bureau.

== Geography ==
The climate varies from the semi-tropical in the Mississippi Delta, south Louisiana, and southeast Texas, to the dry Chihuahuan desert in West Texas. A large portion of the northeastern quarter of the region is mountainous, with the Ozark and Ouachita mountains of Arkansas and eastern Oklahoma. The northwest quarter of the region is dominated by the Great Plains which become progressively drier west of 100° W, forming the North American Llano Estacado. The southwestern portions border the Rio Grande and are generally drier than other areas of the West South Central United States.

Two megaregions exist within this region:

* The Texas Triangle is formed by interstates 10, 35, and 45 connecting in the shape of a triangle to link the four metropolitan areas of Dallas/Fort Worth, Houston, San Antonio, and Austin.
* The Gulf Coast megaregion is located along the shores of the Gulf of Mexico and primarily along the I-10 corridor centered upon the urban areas of Houston and New Orleans, this megaregion extends into the southeastern region.

== Demographics ==

Texas is the largest West South Central state by both area and population; Texas is still home to over half the region&#x27;s population. The largest city in the region, Houston, is located in Texas. New Orleans was tied with Oklahoma City in population but, after Hurricane Katrina, the population of the New Orleans metro area declined to approximately 1 million. By 2017, the population of the New Orleans metropolitan area had bounced back to almost 1.3 million; overall, Louisiana and Arkansas are the two-slowest growing states of the region in contrast with Texas and Oklahoma. In contrast with the population growth of Texas, Oklahoma, and Arkansas, Louisiana has experienced the fifth highest population loss in the U.S. according to 2021 census estimates (making it the second-slowest growing state along the entire Gulf Coast megaregion, yet still experiencing more natural births than Mississippi in the East South Central states).

==Sports==

Within the major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada, the first team in the region were founded in 1960: the Dallas Cowboys of the National Football League and the Houston Oilers of the American Football League. The Oilers relocated after 1996, whereas two more teams in the region joined the NFL: the Houston Texans (2002) and New Orleans Saints (1967).

Two Major League Baseball teams are based in the region: Houston Astros (1962) and Texas Rangers (1972). The region has five NBA teams: San Antonio Spurs (1967), Houston Rockets (1971), Dallas Mavericks (1980), New Orleans Pelicans (2002) and Oklahoma City Thunder (2008). National Hockey League features the Dallas Stars since 1993.

Texas also has three Major League Soccer teams: FC Dallas (1996), Houston Dynamo (2006), and Austin FC (2021), whereas the Dallas Tornado played in the North American Soccer League from 1968 to 1981. 

Collegiate athletics have deep significance in the region&#x27;s culture, especially football. The Southwest Conference was based in the region from 1914 to 1996. Currently the Big 12 Conference has four teams from Texas and one from Oklahoma, whereas the Southeastern Conference has two teams from Texas, one from Oklahoma, one from Arkansas, and one from Louisiana.

According to a survey of Division I-A coaches, the Red River Shootout, the rivalry between the Oklahoma Sooners and Texas Longhorns, ranks the third best in the nation. The Bedlam Series is the rivalry between the Oklahoma Sooners and Oklahoma State Cowboys. The TCU Horned Frogs and SMU Mustangs also share a rivalry and compete annually in the Battle for the Iron Skillet.

<text>Special Bulletin is a 1983 American drama television film directed by Edward Zwick and written by Marshall Herskovitz, based on a story by both. It was an early collaboration between the two, who would later produce such series as &quot;thirtysomething&quot; and &quot;My So-Called Life&quot;. The film was first broadcast March 20, 1983 on NBC as part of &quot;NBC Sunday Night at the Movies&quot;.

In the film, a terrorist group brings a homemade atomic bomb aboard a tugboat in the harbor of Charleston, South Carolina in order to blackmail the U.S. government into disabling its nuclear weapons, and the incident is caught live on television. It simulates a series of live news broadcasts on the fictional RBS Network.

==Synopsis==
The entirety of the film is portrayed through the perspective of an news broadcast from RBS News on the fictional RBS television network. It begins with promotional scenes from other RBS network shows. One is cut off by the announcement &quot;We interrupt our regular programming to bring you this Special Bulletin from RBS News.&quot;

In Charleston, South Carolina, a skirmish is fought between Coast Guard personnel and a group of terrorists aboard a docked tugboat called &quot;Liberty May&quot; in Charleston Harbor. Caught in the battle while reporting an unrelated story, RBS reporter Steve Levitt and his cameraman George Takashima are taken hostage aboard the boat. As part of a deal to release the surrendered Coast Guardsmen, the terrorists - Doctors Bruce Lyman and David McKeeson, political activist Frieda Barton, social worker Diane Silverman, and mentally unstable ex-convict Jim Seaver - ask to broadcast their demands to the U.S. Government over the RBS network. Dr. Lyman demands the triggers for all 968 nuclear devices in the area (Charleston Naval Shipyard and the Polaris Missile Facility, Atlantic (POMFLANT) at the nearby Naval Weapons Station being an important staging ground for U.S. nuclear submarines) delivered to them, intending to destroy them by dropping them in the Atlantic Ocean. Dr. Lyman states that failure to oblige to the demand or any deviation from the plan will result in the group detonating their own improvised nuclear device stowed aboard the ship.

Subsequent investigations into Lyman and McKeeson reveal their backgrounds in nuclear weaponry and technology. Dr. Lyman himself was noted as being instrumental in the construction of the neutron bomb before he became a radical anti-nuclear demonstrator. Dr. McKeeson shows the reporters covering the story the terrorists&#x27; bomb, explaining that not only is he the man who built it, but he has fitted several fail-safes and anti-tamper devices to the bomb, revealing that he is the only person who can disarm it. Eventually, the Department of Defense agrees to the terrorists&#x27; demands and a van arrives outside the tugboat, supposedly carrying the nuclear triggers.

Moments before the handover, a power failure occurs in Charleston – all televisions including one on the tugboat go off the air. This proves to be deliberate, as a Delta Force commando team storms the boat, killing all the terrorists except for Frieda Barton. Dr. McKeeson is cornered, but commits suicide to escape capture. While Steve and George are safely taken off the ship, they continue to broadcast on the dock. Frieda Barton is also taken off the ship by the Charleston Police Department, while the NEST Team boards the boat to disarm the device. A camera aboard the boat records the team working, when they accidentally trigger one of McKeeson&#x27;s safeguards. As the team frantically try to stabilize the device, the feed is suddenly interrupted by static, at which point the broadcast returns to the RBS Studio, the hosts clearly shaken by what they have just witnessed. The broadcast shifts to another reporter, Meg Barclay, who was aboard two miles away. Footage reveals that the device exploded, resulting in a 23-kiloton nuclear blast that has caused a firestorm, destroying the city of Charleston.

Three days later, RBS broadcasts the aftermath of the detonation. Thanks to an earlier ordered evacuation, only 2,000 citizens perished in the detonation. However, thousands more have been left injured, traumatized or homeless, and the surrounding area will be uninhabitable for decades to come. The film ends as the news bulletin reports on other stories across the world.

==Reception and legacy==
Leonard Maltin&#x27;s &quot;Movie and Video Guide&quot; rated &quot;Special Bulletin&quot; &quot;way above average.&quot;

&quot;The Washington Post&quot; described it as &quot;A shrewd, keen, wise, hip, occasionally lacerating and sometimes gravely funny dark parody of network TV news coverage.&quot; Also, &quot;At times, the unfolding story in &quot;Special Bulletin&quot; comes across as ludicrous, but then one has to think, how much more ludicrous is it than some of the actual news events of the past 15 years or so, and the way television has honed its way of covering them? It&#x27;s a process that deserves scrutiny not just in poker-faced journals and ivory tower think tanks but on television. Praiseworthy trailblazers like the ABC News late night &quot;Viewpoint&quot; broadcasts have done this one way. &quot;Special Bulletin&quot; does it in another way-not a better one, perhaps, but in one more accessible to greater numbers of viewers.&quot;

&quot;The New York Times&quot; stated that 2,200 calls from alarmed viewers were received in New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, Washington and Cleveland. NBC&#x27;s flagship station, WNBC-TV in New York, received 731 calls, 44 of them critical, and 43 asking if the program was real. The station manager of WCIV, Celia Shaw, said, &quot;In retrospect, maybe it would have been better with a theoretical city, rather than Charleston, with its large number of military installations.&quot;

===Impact===
Several factors enhanced &quot;Special Bulletin&quot;″s resemblance to an actual live news broadcast. It was shot on videotape rather than film, which gave the presentation the visual appearance of being &quot;live&quot;. Other small touches, such as actors hesitating or stumbling over dialogue (as if being spoken extemporaneously) and small technical glitches (as would often be experienced in a live broadcast), contributed to the realism. With the exception of RBS network and news jingles, there is also no musical score used. The end credits are accompanied by the sound of a teletype.

In addition, some specific references made the movie especially realistic to residents of Charleston. The call letters of the fictional Charleston RBS affiliate, WPIV, were close to those of NBC&#x27;s then-affiliate in Charleston, WCIV. Also, a key plot element mentions &quot;a power failure at a transmitter in North Charleston&quot;; the TV transmitter sites are actually in Awendaw.

The filmmakers were required to include on-screen disclaimers at the beginning and end of every commercial break in order to assure viewers that the events were a dramatization. The word &quot;dramatization&quot; also appeared on the screen during key moments of the original broadcast. Additionally, WCIV placed the word &quot;Fiction&quot; on screen at all times during its showing of the movie. The film also made use of &quot;accelerated time&quot;—events said to take place hours apart instead are shown only minutes apart. In addition, NBC sent releases to the various military commands in the Charleston area of the movie&#x27;s airing, so they could inform their attached servicemembers to be prepared for the possibility of nervous phone calls from home, and could reassure their relatives and friends back home that what was airing was in fact a fictional dramatization, and not a real news story. Nonetheless, there were still news reports of isolated panic in Charleston. Much as with the famous 1938 radio broadcast of &quot;The War of the Worlds&quot;, it was entirely possible for viewers to tune in between disclaimers and make a snap judgment about what they were seeing, although in both cases a quick flip of the dial would reveal that no other stations were covering this supposedly major news event. When the program was rebroadcast in 1984, the only disclaimers were made at the commercial breaks; there were none on the screen while the action was taking place.

WTMJ-TV in Milwaukee, Wisconsin was the only NBC affiliate which refused to air the film out of concern that, as station president Mike McCormick stated, &quot;people will be deceived into believing it&#x27;s an actual telecast.&quot; However, some other NBC affiliates preempted the broadcast because they had previously scheduled local programming for the evening, before the film was placed by the network into that timeslot at the last minute.

===Accolades===
&quot;Special Bulletin&quot; was nominated for six Emmy awards and won four, including Outstanding Drama Special. It also won Directors Guild of America and Writers Guild of America prizes for Zwick and Herskovitz, as well as the Humanitas Prize, the latter award which irked former NBC president Reuven Frank. In his book on TV news, &quot;Out of Thin Air&quot;, Frank called &quot;Special Bulletin&quot; &quot;junk&quot; and claimed he wanted to return his own Humanitas Prize in protest, &quot;but I couldn&#x27;t find it.&quot;

==Home video==
Lorimar Home Video issued &quot;Special Bulletin&quot; on VHS and Betamax, and Warner Home Video would later reissue it; these releases omit the on-screen &quot;dramatization&quot; overlay. Starting in January 2010, Warner Bros. made the film available on DVD for one year as part of its Warner Archive Collection. Warner&#x27;s rights have since reverted to the production company and the DVD is currently out of print.

<doc id="920064" wikidata="Q3271378" url="?curid=920064" title="36-bit computing">
<text>36-bit computers were popular in the early mainframe computer era from the 1950s through the early 1970s.

Starting in the 1960s, but especially the 1970s, the introduction of 7-bit ASCII and 8-bit EBCDIC led to the move to machines using 8-bit bytes, with word sizes that were multiples of 8, notably the 32-bit IBM System/360 mainframe and Digital Equipment VAX and Data General MV series superminicomputers. By the mid-1970s the conversion was largely complete, and microprocessors quickly moved from 8-bit to 16-bit to 32-bit over a period of a decade. The number of 36-bit machines rapidly fell during this period, offered largely for backward compatibility purposes running legacy programs.

==History==
Prior to the introduction of computers, the state of the art in precision scientific and engineering calculation was the ten-digit, electrically powered, mechanical calculator, such as those manufactured by Friden, Marchant and Monroe. These calculators had a column of keys for each digit, and operators were trained to use all their fingers when entering numbers, so while some specialized calculators had more columns, ten was a practical limit. Computers, as the new competitor, had to match that accuracy. Decimal computers sold in that era, such as the IBM 650 and the IBM 7070, had a word length of ten digits, as did ENIAC, one of the earliest computers.

Early binary computers aimed at the same market therefore often used a 36-bit word length. This was long enough to represent positive and negative integers to an accuracy of ten decimal digits (35 bits would have been the minimum). It also allowed the storage of six alphanumeric characters encoded in a six-bit character code. Computers with 36-bit words included the MIT Lincoln Laboratory TX-2, the IBM 701/704/709/7090/7094, the UNIVAC 1103/1103A/1105 and 1100/2200 series, the General Electric GE-600/Honeywell 6000, the Digital Equipment Corporation PDP-6/PDP-10 (as used in the DECsystem-10/DECSYSTEM-20), and the Symbolics 3600 series.

Smaller machines like the PDP-1/PDP-9/PDP-15 used 18-bit words, so a double word was 36 bits.

These computers had addresses 12 to 18 bits in length. The addresses referred to 36-bit words, so the computers were limited to addressing between 4,096 and 262,144 words (24,576 to 1,572,864 six-bit characters). The older 36-bit computers were limited to a similar amount of physical memory as well. Architectures that survived evolved over time to support larger virtual address spaces using memory segmentation or other mechanisms.

The common character packings included:
* six 6-bit IBM BCD or Fieldata characters (ubiquitous in early usage)
* six 6-bit ASCII characters, supporting the upper-case unaccented letters, digits, space, and most ASCII punctuation characters. It was used on the PDP-6 and PDP-10 under the name sixbit.
* six DEC Radix-50 characters packed into 32 bits, plus four spare bits
* five 7-bit characters and 1 unused bit (the usual PDP-6/10 convention, called &quot;five-seven ASCII&quot;)
* four 8-bit characters (7-bit ASCII plus 1 spare bit, or 8-bit EBCDIC), plus four spare bits
* four 9-bit characters (the Multics convention).

Characters were extracted from words either using machine code shift and mask operations or with special-purpose hardware supporting 6-bit, 9-bit, or variable-length characters. The Univac 1100/2200 used the &quot;partial word designator&quot; of the instruction, the &quot;J&quot; field, to access characters. The GE-600 used special indirect words to access 6- and 9-bit characters. the PDP-6/10 had special instructions to access arbitrary-length byte fields.

The standard C programming language requires that the size of the codice_1 data type be at least 8 bits, and that all data types other than bitfields have a size that is a multiple of the character size, so standard C implementations on 36-bit machines would typically use 9-bit codice_1s, although 12-bit, 18-bit, or 36-bit would also satisfy the requirements of the standard.

By the time IBM introduced System/360 with 32-bit full words, scientific calculations had largely shifted to floating point, where double-precision formats offered more than 10-digit accuracy. The 360s also included instructions for variable-length decimal arithmetic for commercial applications, so the practice of using word lengths that were a power of two quickly became commonplace, though at least one line of 36-bit computer systems are still sold , the Unisys ClearPath Dorado series, which is the continuation of the UNIVAC 1100/2200 series of mainframe computers.

<text>The four-horned antelope (Tetracerus quadricornis), also called chousingha, is a small bovid antelope native to central, South and Western India, along with a smaller population in Nepal. The sole member of the genus Tetracerus, the chousingha was first scientifically described in 1816 by French zoologist Henri Marie Ducrotay de Blainville. Three regional subspecies are currently recognised. The four-horned antelope has a yellowish-tan, sometimes reddish or goldenrod coat. It is slender with thin legs and a short tail. It stands nearly at the shoulder and weighs about . Its four horns are unique among antelopes and distinguish it from most other bovids. The longer pair of straight, spike-like horns is atop its head between the ears, while the other, shorter pair is on the forehead; its posterior horns are always longer than the anterior horns, which may even present as merely fur-covered &quot;studs&quot;. While the posterior horns measure , the anterior ones are usually long.

The four-horned antelope is diurnal (active mainly during the day) and typically solitary by nature, though some antelope may form loose groups of three to five animals, usually one or more adults, possibly accompanied by calves. This elusive antelope feeds on grasses, herbs, shrubs, foliage, flowers and fruits. It needs to drink water frequently; as such it stays in places near water sources. The breeding behaviour of the four-horned antelope has not been well studied. The age at which they reach sexual maturity and the season when mating occurs have not been understood well. Gestation lasts about eight months, following which one or two calves are born. They are kept concealed for the first few weeks of their birth. The young remain with the mother for about a year.

Four-horned antelopes tend to inhabit areas with significant grass cover or heavy undergrowth, and avoid human settlements or the presence of dogs. Once more common throughout deciduous forests in India, the four-horned antelope now occurs in disjunct, fragmented populations, with genetic &quot;bottlenecking&quot; (e.g. inbreeding) becoming a potential threat to the stability of future populations that do not intermingle during mating seasons. The four-horned antelope is threatened by the loss of its natural habitat due to agricultural expansion. Because of its four-horned skull and its horns it was historically a target for trophy hunters. It is presently listed as &quot;vulnerable&quot; on the IUCN Red List.

==Etymology==
The scientific name of the four-horned antelope is &quot;Tetracerus quadricornis&quot;. The generic name &quot;Tetracerus&quot; is the combination of two Greek words: &quot;tetra&quot; meaning &quot;four&quot; and &quot;keras&quot; meaning &quot;horn&quot;. The specific name &quot;quadricornis&quot; is derived from two Latin words: &quot;quattuor&quot; meaning &quot;four&quot; and &quot;cornu&quot; &quot;horn&quot;. The four-horned antelope is known by several vernacular names: &quot;chausingha&quot;, &quot;chowsingha&quot;, &quot;chousingha&quot; (Hindi for &quot;four horns&quot;), &quot;doda&quot;, &quot;ghutri&quot; (mainly in central India) (Hindi); &quot;kondu kuri&quot; (Kannada); &quot;chauka&quot; (Nepalese); &quot;nari komboo marn&quot; (Tamil).

==Taxonomy and phylogeny==

The four-horned antelope is the sole member of the genus &quot;Tetracerus&quot;, and is placed under the family Bovidae. The species was first described by French zoologist Henri Marie Ducrotay de Blainville in 1816. The four-horned antelope has only one other relative in the tribe Boselaphini, the nilgai (&quot;Boselaphus tragocamelus&quot;). The Boselaphini have horns with a keel on the front and lack rings as found in other antelope groups.

The authority for &quot;Tetracerus&quot; is variously indicated according to interpretations of the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature. The name was first published in an 1825 publication by English naturalist Thomas Hardwicke but cited the English zoologist William Elford Leach – probably by an editor – as the authority in a footnote at the end of the publication. Philip Sclater and Oldfield Thomas listed Hardwicke as the genus authority by virtue of his being the author of the publication. However, Leach is now identified as the appropriate authority based on Article 50.1.1 of the Zoological Code.

A 1992 phylogenetic study showed a strong possibility of a clade consisting of Boselaphini, Bovini and Tragelaphini. Bovini consists of the genera &quot;Bubalus&quot;, &quot;Bos&quot;, &quot;Pseudoryx&quot; (saola), &quot;Syncerus&quot; (African buffalo), &quot;Bison&quot; and the extinct &quot;Pelorovis&quot;. Tragelaphini consists of two genera: &quot;Taurotragus&quot; (eland) and &quot;Tragelaphus&quot;. Boselaphini and Tragelaphini were predicted to be close; this was seconded by a similar study in 1999. The following cladogram is based on the 1992 study:

Colin Groves (2003) recognizes three subspecies of the four-horned antelope on the basis of distribution and physical characteristics such as coat colour, body size and the number of horns:
* &quot;T. q. iodes&quot; : distributed north of the Ganges in Nepal
* &quot;T. q. quadricornis&quot; : distributed in peninsular India
* &quot;T. q. subquadricornutus&quot; distributed in the Western Ghats and southern India

==Evolution==

Though Boselaphini has no African representation today, fossil evidence supports its presence in the continent during as early as the late Miocene – the two living antelopes of this tribe, in fact, have been found to have a closer relationship with the earliest bovids (like &quot;Eotragus&quot; species) than do the other bovids. This tribe originated at least 8.9 Mya, in much the same area where the four-horned antelope occurs today, and may represent the most &quot;primitive&quot; of all living bovids, having changed the least since the origins of the family. The extant and extinct boselaphine forms show similar development of the horn cores (the central bony part of the horn). It is thought that ancestral bovids had a diploid chromosome number of 58 which has reduced in &quot;Tetracerus&quot; to 38 through a process of concatenation of some chromosomes.

Fossils of &quot;Protragocerus labidotus&quot; and &quot;Sivoreas eremita&quot; dating back to the late Miocene have been discovered in the Ngorora formation (Kenya). Fossils from the same period have also been excavated in the eastern Mediterranean region. Other Miocene fossils of boselaphines discovered are of &quot;Miotragocerus&quot;, &quot;Tragocerus&quot; and &quot;Tragoportax&quot;. Fossils of &quot;Miotragoceros&quot; are not apparent in Africa (only &quot;M. cyrenaicus&quot; has been reported from the continent), but have significant presence in the Shiwalik Hills in India and Pakistan, as do several &quot;Tragoportax&quot; species. A 2005 study suggested the migration of &quot;Miotragoceros&quot; to eastern Asia around 8 Mya. Alan W. Gentry of the Natural History Museum reported the presence of another boselaphine, &quot;Mesembriportax&quot;, from Langebaanweg (South Africa).

Evidence of early humans hunting four-horned antelope during the Mesolithic period (5,000 to 8,000 years ago) have been found in the Kurnool caves of southern India and similar evidence has been found from the Chalcolithic period (3,000 years ago) in Orissa, eastern India.

==Description==

The four-horned antelope is one of the smallest Asian bovids. The number of its horns distinguishes it from most of the other bovids, that have two horns The four-horned antelope stands at the shoulder and weighs ; the head-and-body length is typically between . Sexual dimorphism is not very notable, though only males possess horns.

Slender with thin legs and a short tail, the four-horned antelope has a yellowish brown to reddish coat. The underparts and the insides of the legs are white. Facial features include black markings on the muzzle and behind the ears. A black stripe marks the outer surface of each leg. Females have four teats far back on the abdomen. The hair feels coarse, more like that of a deer than the glossy hair typical of antelopes. The fetlocks are marked with white patches.

One pair of horns is located between the ears, and the other on the forehead. The posterior horns are always longer than the anterior horns, which might be mere fur-covered studs. While the posterior horns each measures , the anterior ones measure . Horns emerge at 10 to 14 months. According to Groves, anterior horns show the poorest development in the subspecies &quot;T. q. subquadricornutus&quot;. These horns measure nearly in &quot;T. q. quadricornis&quot;, and nearly in &quot;T. q. iodes&quot;. The posterior horn lengths for the subspecies recorded by him were: for &quot;T. q. quadricornis&quot;, in &quot;T. q. iodes&quot; and in &quot;T. q. subquadricornutus&quot;.

The four-horned antelope differs greatly from the nilgai in colour, is much smaller and has an extra pair of horns. The nilgai is nearly nine times heavier and two times taller than the four-horned antelope. Two deer species, the Indian muntjac and the Indian hog deer, can be confused with this antelope. The four-horned antelope, however, lacks their antlers. The chinkara, a gazelle, can be told apart by its light brown coat and larger, ringed horns.

==Ecology and behaviour==
The four-horned antelope is diurnal (active mainly during the day), though it mainly rests or ruminates in dense undergrowth at noon. Though solitary by nature, the four-horned antelope may form loose groups of three to five. Groups consist of one or more adults, sometimes accompanied by juveniles. Males and females hardly interact, except in the mating season.

The antelope is shy and elusive. When alarmed, it stands motionless and may nervously leap away from the danger or even sprint. It often conceals itself in tall grasses to escape predators. The use of alarm calls to alert others is not common because the antelope tries to avoid the attention of predators. However, in extreme cases, these calls may be used to warn predators that they have been identified. Adults mark vegetation in their territories with a colourless secretion of preorbital glands, that soon condenses to form a white film. They maintain multiple latrine sites where piles of their pellet droppings are formed by regular use. Latrine sites can be confused with those of the barking deer but the pellets are longer and larger in four-horned antelopes. Submissive display consists of shrinking the body, lowering the head and pulling the ears back. Predators of four-horned antelopes include tigers, leopards, and dholes.

===Diet===

The four-horned antelope feeds on grasses, herbs, shrubs, foliage, flowers and fruits. A study in Mudumalai National Park (Tamil Nadu, India) showed that the antelope prefers grass species of the family Cyperaceae; genera &quot;Axonopus&quot;, &quot;Cynodon&quot;, &quot;Digitaria&quot;, &quot;Echinochloa&quot;, &quot;Panicum&quot;, &quot;Sehima&quot; and &quot;Sporobolus&quot;; and the species &quot;Imperata cylindrica&quot;, &quot;Ottochloa nodosa&quot;, &quot;Pseudanthistria umbellata&quot; and &quot;Themeda cymbaria&quot;. The shrub &quot;Grewia hirsuta&quot; is frequently eaten. Preferred herbs include &quot;Helichrysum&quot;, &quot;Indigofera&quot; and &quot;Tinospora&quot; species and &quot;Leucas aspera&quot;. The four-horned antelope feeds on the leaves of trees such as &quot;Cordia wallichii&quot;, &quot;Emblica officinalis&quot;, &quot;Randia dumetorum&quot; and &quot;Zizyphus xylopyrus&quot;. Grasses comprise nearly 29 percent of the diet, followed by foliage from trees (nearly nine percent). Grass and browse were consumed in nearly equal proportions. A study in the Panna National Park (Madhya Pradesh, India) showed preference for &quot;Zizyphus mauritiana&quot;, &quot;Acacia nilotica&quot;, &quot;A. leucophloea&quot; and &quot;A. catechu&quot;. Babool flowers were frequently eaten. The antelope often associates with langurs under fruiting trees, just as chital frequently do. Interaction with chital, a sympatric species, was infrequent. The antelope is wary when feeding, often raising its head and looking about its vicinity. The four-horned antelope needs to drink water frequently; as such it stays in places near water sources.

===Reproduction===

Breeding behaviour of the four-horned antelope has not been well studied. The age at which sexual maturity is gained is doubted; two captive females had their first parturition at less than two years. The breeding season in Panna National Park probably lasts from May to July, and from June to August in Mudumalai National Park. The male approaches the female in a relaxed gait, giving out low coughs. The two may kneel and push against each other with the necks intertwined. The male makes a few short mounting attempts; the female may be foraging all the while without any reaction. Gestation lasts about eight months, followed by the birth of one or two calves. The newborn has a head-and-body length of , and weighs . Juveniles are kept concealed for the first few weeks of birth. Births in Mudumalai National Park peak from February to April. Juveniles remain with their mothers for about a year.

==Distribution and habitat ==

The four-horned antelope is confined to the Indian subcontinent, occurring widely in disjunct and small populations. It ranges from the foothills of the Himalayas in the north to the Deccan Plateau in the south. Most of the existing populations lives in India, and lower numbers in adjoining Nepa]. Observations have been logged from the states of Andhra Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Gujarat, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra and Telangana on iNaturalist.org&#x27;s biodiversity database.
It inhabits open, dry deciduous forests in flat to hilly terrain. It prefers areas close to water that are covered with grasses or heavy undergrowth, for security. As many Ungulates are skittish by nature, the chousingha, notably, generally keeps away from human settlements; research suggests that human activities, construction, and feral dogs all adversely affect chousingha numbers, thus areas of less human habitation support more stable chousingha populations.

The four-horned antelope was once common throughout deciduous forests in India, but the population has declined over time. In 2001, it was estimated to comprise about 10,000 mature individuals, with a decreasing trend. Numbers in Gir National Park were estimated at 256 individuals in 1974; later estimates at waterholes in the same locations put them slightly over 1,000 individuals, and a population density of above 0.7 individuals per was considered to be healthy.

==Threats and conservation==
The four-horned antelope is classified as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List. It is threatened by the loss of its natural habitat due to agricultural expansion. Its four-horned skull and the horns have been targeted by trophy hunters.

The four-horned antelope is protected under Schedule I of the Indian Wildlife Protection Act of 1972; the population in Nepal is listed in CITES Appendix III. 
Major protected areas in India where four-horned antelopes occur include:
*Gir National Park in Gujarat;
*Sariska Tiger Reserve in Rajasthan;
*Bandhavgarh National Park, Bori Wildlife Sanctuary, Kanha National Park, Pachmarhi Biosphere Reserve, Panna Tiger Reserve, Pench Tiger Reserve, Sanjay National Park, Satpura National Park in Madhya Pradesh;
*Tadoba Andhari Reserve in Maharashtra;
*Kumbhalgarh Wildlife Sanctuary, Ranthambore National Park, Rangayyanadurga Four–horned antelope Wildlife Sanctuary in Karnataka.

<text>The East North Central states is a region of the United States defined by the U.S. Census Bureau, containing five states: Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Ohio and Wisconsin. These states border the Great Lakes, West North Central, the Southeastern, and Northeastern states; the Eastern North Central states also share a land border with Canada through Michigan&#x27;s Upper Peninsula, southeastern, and mid-Michigan regions. As one of two subregional divisions used to categorize the Midwest, East North Central closely matches the area of the Northwest Territory, excluding a portion of Minnesota.

The East North Central states also form a large part of the Great Lakes region, although the latter also includes Minnesota, New York, Pennsylvania and the Canadian province of Ontario. It has a low rate of population growth and the estimated population as of 2019 was 46,902,431, though the 2020 census numbered 47,368,533 residents. The Great Lakes bordering the area provide access to the Atlantic Ocean via the Great Lakes Waterway and St. Lawrence Seaway, or by the Erie Canal and the Hudson River, or via the Gulf of Mexico from the Mississippi River and the Illinois Waterway. Chicago and Detroit—two of East North Central&#x27;s largest cities—are among the major ports of the United States.

Culturally, this region of the U.S. has been historically influenced by the British and French; Anglo-American culture permeated states covering the region following the expansion of the United States. Religiously, the East North Central states have been and remain predominantly affiliated with Christianity. Altogether, the five states are majority Catholic, non- and inter-denominational, Methodist, Lutheran, and Baptist. The largest non-Christian religion has been Islam.

== History ==
During European colonization of the Americas, the modern-day East North Central states was occupied by numerous American Indian tribes; with the introduction of European Americans into the region, it was divided between the British colonial empire in America and New France. The western portion of this region formed part of French Louisiana, and following U.S. independence, the eastern half was ceded to the United States from Great Britain. Since American settlement, the modern-day East North Central states has remained the most populous division of the Midwest despite the overall region&#x27;s low population growth rates.

== Geography ==
Geographically located within the North, East North Central is considered part of the Midwest and Great Lakes regions, sharing maritime and land borders with Canada. As half of the Midwest, the majority of it shares a humid continental climate, and many of its coastal settlements encounter lake effect snow during the winter.
== Demographics ==
In 2010, the East North Central states had a population of 46,421,564; this grew to an estimated 46,902,431 by 2019. By the 2020 United States census, the region&#x27;s population increased to 47,368,533. Of its population, Illinois is the region&#x27;s most populous with a 2020 population of 12,812,508. Its least populous is Wisconsin, with 5,893,718 residents. Chicago is the region&#x27;s most populous city and largest metropolitan area. According to the 2010 American Community Survey, 49.1% of the residents were male and 50.9% were female. Approximately 24.0% of the population were under 18 years of age, and 13.4% were over 65 years of age, and the median age for the region was 39.2.

In terms of race and ethnicity as of 2012, White Americans made up 79.5% of the population, of which 75.7% were whites of non-Hispanic origin. Black Americans composed 12.1% of the region&#x27;s population, of which 11.9% were blacks of non-Hispanic origin. American Indians and Alaskan Natives were 0.4% of the population and Asians were 2.7%. People who were of two or more races formed 2.1% of the population; and Hispanics and Latinos of any race made up 7.6%.

Linguistically, English is, by far, the most common language spoken at home. Approximately 89.3% of all residents (38.3 million people) over the age of five spoke only English at home. Roughly 2,516,000 people (5.9% of the population) spoke Spanish at home and roughly 2,016,000 people (5.8% of the population) spoke another languages at home. Around 270,000 (0.6%) spoke German at home, although this figure ranges from 2% to 37% in Northeast Ohio, which is home to a large Amish community.

== Politics ==
There are also two deregistered parties that have active executive committees.

<text>Soi Cowboy (, , ) is a short (150 meter long) street (&quot;soi&quot;) in Bangkok, Thailand, with some 40 establishments, mostly go-go bars. It caters mainly to tourists and expatriates. Soi Cowboy contains one of the three largest groups of foreign-oriented bars in Bangkok, the other two being Patpong and Soi Nana Tai.

== Location ==
Soi Cowboy is near Sukhumvit Road, between Asok Montri Road (Soi Sukhumvit 21) and Soi Sukhumvit 23, within walking distance from the BTS Skytrain&#x27;s Asok Station and the Bangkok MRT&#x27;s Sukhumvit Station. The Pullman Bangkok Grande Sukhumvit Hotel is nearby.

==History==

The first bar opened in Soi Cowboy in the early 1970s, but it was not until 1977 that a second bar opened on the street by T. G. &quot;Cowboy&quot; Edwards, a retired American airman. Edwards got his nickname because he often wore a cowboy hat and the soi was given its name in reference to him by longtime nightlife columnist Bernard Trink. The number of bars grew to 31 by the end of the century, all located on the ground floor.

==In popular culture==
Some scenes from the 2004 film &quot;Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason&quot; were both shot in Soi Cowboy and set there. In the film the actor Hugh Grant plays a character who visits a Soi Cowboy massage parlour.

In August 2006, scenes were shot in Soi Cowboy for the film &quot;Bangkok Dangerous&quot;.

<text>Lac Beauchamp Park in Gatineau, Quebec, Canada is a large wooded park of 172 hectares built around a small lake in the middle of the suburban sprawl of the eastern part of the city. In the winter it has 15 km of ski and snowshoe trails. The lake also has a skating area. In the summer, the lake has a supervised swimming beach and canoe rentals. The ski trails are then used by amateur naturalists, hikers and bikers.

The park is located about 10 km East of the downtown core of Gatineau and is thus easy to reach from Ottawa by any of the main bridges.

The city offers several recreational activities in and around the park chalet. Several groups, such as ornithologists, entomologists, and garden lovers use the building and the nature preserve around it for their activities.

There is an annual sand sculpture competition on the beach.

<doc id="920101" wikidata="Q495424" url="?curid=920101" title="Kaesong Industrial Region">
<text>The Kaesŏng Industrial Region (KIR) or Kaesŏng Industrial Zone (KIZ) is a special administrative industrial region of North Korea (DPRK). It was formed in 2002 from part of the Kaesŏng Directly-Governed City. On 10 February 2016, it was temporarily closed by the South Korean government and all staff recalled by the Park Geun-hye administration, although the former President of South Korea, Moon Jae-in, signalled his desire to &quot;reopen and expand&quot; the region in 2017.

Its most notable feature is the Kaesŏng industrial park, which operated from 2004 to 2016 as a collaborative economic development with South Korea (ROK). The park is located ten kilometres (six miles) north of the Korean Demilitarized Zone, an hour&#x27;s drive from Seoul, with direct road and rail access to South Korea. The park allows South Korean companies to employ cheap labour that is educated, skilled, and fluent in Korean, whilst providing North Korea with an important source of foreign currency.
, 123 South Korean companies were employing approximately 53,000 DPRK workers and 800 ROK staff.

At times of tension between North and South Korea, southern access to the Industrial Park has been restricted. On 3 April 2013, during the 2013 Korean crisis, North Korea blocked access to the region to all South Korean citizens. On 8 April 2013, the North Korean government removed all 53,000 North Korean workers from the Kaesŏng industrial park, which effectively shut down all activities. On 15 August 2013, both countries agreed that the industrial park should be reopened.

On 10 February 2016, the South Korean Ministry of Unification announced that the industrial park would be &quot;temporarily&quot; closed down and all staff recalled, partly in protest over continued North Korean provocations, including a satellite launch and a claimed hydrogen bomb test in January 2016. The next day, the North announced it was expelling all South Korean workers and said it will freeze all South Korean assets and equipment at the jointly run factory park. All 280 South Korean workers present at Kaesŏng left hours after the announcement by the North.

==Kaesong Industrial Park==
Construction started in June 2003, and in August 2003 North and South Korea ratified four tax and accountancy agreements to support investment. Pilot construction was completed in June 2004, and the industrial park opened in December 2004.

===Initial phase===
In the park&#x27;s initial phase, 15 South Korean companies constructed manufacturing facilities. Three of the companies started operations by March 2005. First phase plans envisaged participation by 250 South Korean companies from 2006, employing 100,000 people by 2007.

===The planned final phase===
The park was expected to be complete in 2012, covering 65 km2 and employing 700,000 people. The plan also called for a supporting zone, roughly a third the size of the industrial zone, that was meant for life-quality operations. Specifically, this meant the creation of residential areas, hospitals, shopping centers, and even a proposed theme park to attract tourists.

===Organization===
The Kaesong Industrial Park is run by a South Korean committee that has a 50-year lease that began in 2004. Hyundai Asan, a division of South Korean conglomerate Hyundai, was hired by Pyongyang to develop the land. The firms take advantage of low-cost labor available in the North to compete with China to create low-end goods such as shoes, clothes, and watches.

In 2006, Park Suhk-sam, senior economist at the Bank of Korea, predicted the industrial zone could create 725,000 jobs and generate $500 million in annual wage income for the North Korean economy by 2012. Five years later, another $1.78 billion would be earned from annual corporate taxes levied on South Korean companies participating in the industrial project.

===Firms operating within the park===
By the end of the first full year of operation, 11 South Korean firms were operating in the KIR. By 2006, the 15 initial firms had all begun production including JCCOM, Yongin Electronics, TS Precision Machinery, JY Solutec, Magic Micro, Hosan Ace, Romanson, Munchang Co., Daewha Fuel Pump, Taesong Industrial, Bucheon Industrial, Samduk Trading, Shinwon, SJ Tech, and Sonoko Cuisine Ware. In February 2016, shortly before the park was closed for the last time, the number of South Korean firms operating in the park had increased to 124. The different types of manufacturing performed in the park broke down to 71 textile and clothing firms, nine chemical product firms, 23 that dealt in metals and machinery, 13 that produced electronics, and eight firms of other kinds of production.

===Obstacles===
The zone faces a number of obstacles. Among the most pressing are U.S. economic sanctions against the North, prohibiting imports of key technologies and goods, such as computers.

===Wage and rent agreements===

In May 2009, Pyongyang announced it unilaterally scrapped wage and rent agreements at the industrial park. In June 2009, they also demanded new salaries of $300 a month for its 40,000 workers, compared with the $75 they had been receiving prior.

In September 2009, a visit to North Korea by the Hyundai Group chairwoman led to a resolution to the North&#x27;s demands, with mild wage increases and no change in land rents.

In 2012, wages were estimated at $160 per month, about one-fifth of the South Korean minimum wage, and about a quarter of typical Chinese wages.

===Taxes and revenue===
In 2012, the Ministry of Unification was informed that eight of the current 123 companies had received a tax collection notice. The notices were made by a unilateral decision by North Korea. The eight companies were informed of a notice to pay ₩170,208,077 ($160,000 US) in taxes; two of the companies had already paid $20,000 in taxes to North Korea.

Unilateral decisions by the Central Special Direct General Bureau (CSDGB) to amend bylaws is a violation of Kaesŏng Industrial District Law, which requires that any revision of the laws be negotiated between the North and the South.

For the first time, in 2011, the companies in the KIR recorded an average operating profit of ₩56 million ($56,241 US), finally operating in the black after years in deficit.

==== Green Doctors ====
Green Doctors, an NGO founded in Busan in January 2004, received official government permission to open a hospital in the region in 2005. Since then, it has provided medical treatment to the workers at Kaesŏng until the closure of the complex. The doctors who work there received no salary.

===&quot;Cheonan&quot; incident===
In May 2010, following the sinking of the ROKS &quot;Cheonan&quot; and South Korea&#x27;s response, North Korea severed ties with South Korea and shut its Consultative Office; however, existing activities in the zone maintained production activities, and transport and telephones to South Korea were operating normally.

===2013 closure and reopening===

On 3 April 2013, North Korea began to deny South Korean employees access to the Kaesong Industrial region. This came as tensions began escalating rapidly between Seoul and Pyongyang. On 8 April, North Korea recalled all 53,000 North Korean workers from the Kaesong Industrial complex, fully suspending its operations. However, 406 South Koreans remained at the complex after its effective closure.

On 17 April, North Korea barred a delegation of 10 South Korean businessmen from delivering food and supplies to the 200 South Korean staff who remained in the industrial zone. On 26 April 2013, South Korea decided to withdraw all remaining staff, and on 4 May, the last seven South Koreans left the Kaesong Industrial Region, which thus was completely shut down.

On 4 July, both countries agreed in principle that the Kaesong Industrial Park should be reopened, as tensions between the two began to cool. Six rounds of talks were held without reaching a concrete agreement, with South Korea&#x27;s insistence on a provision to prevent North Korea from closing the complex again in the future. During the first week of August, North Korea reiterated that reopening the complex was in both nations&#x27; interest. On 13 August South Korea said it would start distributing insurance payments to businesses in the complex, but also said it was open to &quot;new&quot; wording on the issue of joint control of Kaesŏng. The move, seen as precursor to formally closing the region, sparked a seventh round of talks which South Korea label as &quot;final&quot;. An official agreement to reopen the complex was reached and signed on 15 August. The agreement included provisions designed to ensure against a similar shutdown in the future. A joint committee was formed to determine if compensation will be provided for economic losses caused by the shutdown.

On 13 September, before the reopening of Kaesŏng Industrial region, the two governments held a subcommittee meeting to iron out additional issues regarding entrance, legal stay, communication, customs and passing. This also discussed the resumption of tourism in the Mount Kumgang Tourist Region.

On 16 September, Kaesŏng was reopened after five months. All of the 123 companies operating in Kaesŏng experienced losses equaling a combined £575 million ($944 million).

=== 2016 closure ===
On 10 February 2016, in response to a rocket launch by the DPRK, South Korea announced that it would, for the first time, halt operations in the region, describing the launch as a disguised ballistic missile test. Seoul said all operations at the complex would halt, to stop the North using its investment &quot;to fund its nuclear and missile development&quot;. The next day, the North announced it was expelling all South Korean workers and said it would freeze all South Korean assets and equipment at the jointly run factory park. All 280 South Korean workers present at Kaesŏng left hours after the announcement by the North.

On Thursday, 11 February, a few minutes before midnight, the South announced it had shut off the supply of electricity and water into Kaesong that supplied the factory zone.

In South Korean domestic politics, there were two opposing viewpoints toward the 2016 closure – while the Saenuri Party argued for the closure, stating that it was one and the only means to end North Korea&#x27;s provocation, two other parties, The Minjoo Party and the People&#x27;s Party, objecting to Saenuri, asserted that more communication is needed and that the closure would only escalate tensions in the Korean peninsula. The Saenuri Party, the ruling party at the time, said during the announcement of Kaesŏng Industrial Region&#x27;s closure, &quot;North Korea conducted the 4th nuclear test and rocket launch regardless of persistent warnings from the South Korean government and the international society. Communication and persuasion, or the &#x27;carrots,&#x27; do not work anymore. We need more powerful sanctions on North Korea.&quot; Some people agree with the Saenuri Party, arguing that South Korea should have a more threatening and uncompromising attitudes toward North Korea so that it cannot conduct such tests again. On the other hand, The Minjoo Party and People&#x27;s Party, which were the opposition parties, counter-argued that North Korea has never stopped its provocation even during its Arduous March, or the North Korean famine, emphasizing that a simple closure would never bar North Korea from testing nuclear weapons and launching missiles. They also say that the Kaesŏng Industrial Region was the last hope for peaceful resolution to everlasting tensions between the South and the North, but now that it is closed, South Korean citizens&#x27; fear over national defense will intensify.

In December 2017, an expert panel investigating the decision to close the park found that there was no evidence that North Korea had diverted wages to fund its nuclear program. The head of the panel Kim Jong-soo said, &quot;The presidential office inserted the wage-diversion argument as major grounds, yet without concrete information, sufficient evidence and consultations with related agencies, mainly citing defector testimonies that lack objectivity and credibility. This impairs the decision&#x27;s legitimacy and could constrain our ground over a future restart of the complex, while hampering the companies&#x27; rights to protect their assets due to the hasty pullout process.&quot;

A group of businesses who suffered losses of 250 billion won ($200 million) due to the closure demanded an apology and said, &quot;Now that the wage-diversion claim has proved groundless, the government must apologize for abusing state power to suspend the complex and make utmost efforts to reopen it.&quot;

===2018 opening of Inter Korean Liaison Office===
On 14 September 2018, the Inter-Korean Liaison Office located in the region officially opened. The office&#x27;s purpose was to further communication between the two Koreas.

On 16 June 2020, North Korea destroyed the building via explosion, amidst heightened tensions between the countries.

North Korea blew up the Inter-Korean Liaison Office in June 2020 in response to South Korea not banning or punishing defectors from sending leaflets and flash drives into North Korea. The South Korean government did not take strict measures against North Korea, even though North Korea intentionally bombed the Inter-Korean Liaison Office―a building created to keep peaceful communication between the two countries. However, in December 2020, South Korea&#x27;s National Assembly passed a law that penalizes South Korean citizens who send anti-North Korean material across the border.

===Restoration of water supply===
On 10 October 2018, South Korea resumed supplying water to the region. On 11 October 2018, the local water treatment plant had been restored.

==Transport==
There are two modes of travel to Kaesŏng, road and rail. Transportation links with South Korea were severed in October 2024, when North Korea dug trenches across roads and rail lines going to South Korea. 

===Rail===
Kaesŏng Industrial Region is served by Korean State Railway from Panmun Station through the Pyongbu Line. There was rail access to South Korea (operated by Korail) via the Gyeongui Line. An agreement to re-establish rail freight services was made in November 2007.

The closest station in South Korea is Dorasan Station, from which road access can be taken.

===Road===
Limited road access was available for workers from South Korea via South Korea National Route 1 to the DMZ and then into Kaesŏng via Asian Highway 1 in the North. The route between the two highways was a paved road and part of the AH1 network. There were no connecting roads &quot;en route&quot; and a turnaround was available only in the South before entering the North. 

===Air===
There is no option of air travel available from Kaesŏng to the South. Sohung South Airport is the closest airport to Kaesŏng in the North, but it serves no South Korea-bound flights.

The closest airports in the South are Gimpo International Airport and Incheon International Airport, from which road access can be taken to the industrial region.

<text>The Avra Valley is a 50-mile (80 km) long northwest–southeast valley, bordering the west of Tucson, Arizona. The Tucson Mountains are at the valley&#x27;s center-east, with suburbs ranging east of the Tucson Mountains and trending northwest to the Avra Valley&#x27;s northeast. This entire northwest stretch from Tucson contains the northwest trending Interstate 10, the route to Casa Grande and Phoenix. The northeast of the valley contains Marana on I-10, the Pinal Airpark, an aircraft storage park, and other communities along I-10. Avra Valley Airport is a general aviation airport in Marana, located about 15 miles (24 km) northwest of Tucson, and being used for storage of classic propeller-era airliners.

The center-(west) of the valley is at Cocoraque Butte, , extended northeast from the Roskruge Mountains. Cocoraque Butte&#x27;s height is .

==Description==
Avra Valley is a narrow valley, only about 10 miles wide in some locations, and bordered completely on the west by low-elevation, arid mountain ranges. From the northwest, the mountains are the Silver Bell Mountains, Watermans, and then in the southwest the Roskruge Mountains. Much of these ranges to the West of Avra Valley are protected in Ironwood Forest National Monument. South of Roskruge, Arizona Route 86 enters the valley from the Tohono O&#x27;odham Nation to the west. Robles Junction, Arizona, is also in the southwest, at the junction of the valley going southwest to Sasabe, the Altar Valley. Robles Junction is also at the northwest of the mountain range on Avra Valley&#x27;s southern border, the Sierrita Mountains.

The north of the Avra Valley narrows at the Silver Bell Mountains and Marana to the east. The region merges into the wider flatlands associated with the floodplain regions of the northwestern Santa Cruz River where it begins to merge with the Gila River.

===Saguaro National Park===
Saguaro National Park protects the northern Tucson Mountains in its West Unit bordering Avra Valley. Saguaro National Park features &quot;forests&quot; of Saguaro, &quot;Carnegiea gigantea&quot;.

Seven states compose the division: Iowa, Kansas, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota and South Dakota and it makes up the western half of the United States Census Bureau&#x27;s larger region of the Midwest, the eastern half of which consists of the East North Central states of Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Ohio and Wisconsin. The Mississippi River marks the bulk of the boundary between these two divisions.

The West North Central states are regarded as constituting the core of the nation&#x27;s &quot;Farm Belt.&quot; Another name popularly applied to the division is the &quot;Agricultural Heartland,&quot; or simply the &quot;Heartland.&quot;

Since the early 1990s, the West North Central division has consistently had the lowest unemployment rate in the United States (especially in its many college towns), and has also been noted for its plentiful supply of affordable housing.

== Demographics ==
As of 2020, the West North Central states had a combined population of 21,616,921. This number is a 5.4% increase from 20,505,437 in 2010. The West North Central region covers of land, and has an average population density of 42.56 people per square mile.



==Politics==

<text>In combinatorics, the Dinitz theorem (formerly known as Dinitz conjecture) is a statement about the extension of arrays to partial Latin squares, proposed in 1979 by Jeff Dinitz, and proved in 1994 by Fred Galvin.

The Dinitz theorem is that given an &quot;n&quot; × &quot;n&quot; square array, a set of &quot;m&quot; symbols with &quot;m&quot; ≥ &quot;n&quot;, and for each cell of the array an &quot;n&quot;-element set drawn from the pool of &quot;m&quot; symbols, it is possible to choose a way of labeling each cell with one of those elements in such a way that no row or column repeats a symbol.
It can also be formulated as a result in graph theory, that the list chromatic index of the complete bipartite graph formula_1 equals formula_2. That is, if each edge of the complete bipartite graph is assigned a set of formula_2 colors, it is possible to choose one of the assigned colors for each edge
such that no two edges incident to the same vertex have the same color.

Galvin&#x27;s proof generalizes to the statement that, for every bipartite multigraph, the list chromatic index equals its chromatic index. The more general edge list coloring conjecture states that the same holds not only for bipartite graphs, but also for any loopless multigraph. An even more general conjecture states that the list chromatic number of claw-free graphs always equals their chromatic number. The Dinitz theorem is also related to Rota&#x27;s basis conjecture.

<doc id="920115" wikidata="Q4540504" url="?curid=920115" title="'Not happy, John!' campaign">
<text>The ″Not happy, John!&#x27; campaign was an Australian political campaign to oppose the re-election of Prime Minister John Howard as member for Bennelong in the 2004 Australian federal election. The title of the campaign is based on the popular television commercial &quot;Not happy, Jan!&quot; and the book &quot;Not Happy, John&quot; by Margo Kingston.

The campaign did not promote any specific candidate; instead, it called for votes for any other candidate standing against Howard. The campaign was unsuccessful, in that Howard was returned as member, but had some success in that it reduced Howard&#x27;s majority by 3% in the face of a 2% swing to Howard&#x27;s Liberal Party, and he did lose the seat as sitting Prime Minister in the subsequent election.

Supporters of the campaign included Margo Kingston (journalist), John Valder (previous president of Howard&#x27;s Liberal Party), Brian Deegan (former magistrate, who stood against Alexander Downer), Andrew Wilkie (Greens candidate), Alex Broun playwright and Nicole Campbell (Labor Party candidate). The campaign was launched on 22 June 2004 and continued until the election on 9 October.

There was a small &#x27;Not Happy, John&#x27; campaign for the 2007 election based on the philosophy behind the original campaign.

<doc id="920121" wikidata="Q843097" url="?curid=920121" title="Hvidovre IF">
<text>Hvidovre Idrætsforening, more commonly known as Hvidovre IF () is a Danish association football club from Hvidovre, Capital Region of Denmark. The club competes in the Danish 1st Division, the second tier of Danish football, and plays its home matches at the Hvidovre Stadion.

Formed in 1925, the club has been crowned Danish champions three times, in 1966, 1973 and 1981, and have won the Danish Cup once, in 1980.

==History==
===1925–1961: Beginnings===
Hvidovre Idrætsforening was formed in 1925. Initially, the team started by playing private matches against neighbouring towns, including military teams from Avedørelejren. Hvidovre was not affiliated with any governing body, but in order to generate more interest in the matches, they organised private cup tournaments. In 1933, notable figures Johannes Nielsen and Otto Larsen recognised the abundant talent within the player roster of Hvidovre, which led them to exert additional efforts to secure the club&#x27;s affiliation with the Kjøbenhavns Boldspil-Union (KBU). Their endeavours proved successful, and starting from 1934, Hvidovre became a part of the B-Division, the second tier of the regional association. To enhance their performance, the club appointed Sofus Johansen as their head coach, who came over from Frem.

The period for Hvidovre during the 1930s and 1940s was characterised by a mix of successes and challenges. They made a notable start as part of KBU, with promising players like Erdman Ziegler and the Svendsen brothers contributing to their victories. However, they also faced setbacks and missed opportunities, as shown by a crucial loss to Dragør Boldklub in 1935, thereby missing promotion to Danmarksturneringen. Despite the club having a poor economy during the late 1930s, they persevered, with Olaf Egge taking on a leadership role in training.

In 1941, Hvidovre sought to enhance their team by bringing in qualified coach Niels Hansen from the Frem youth academy, who emphasised technical skills and ball control during training sessions. They experienced notable achievements, such as winning the A-Division and Copenhagen Series, but they were not able to secure a place in Danmarksturneringen immediately. Finally, in 1949, after some years of continuous effort, Hvidovre managed to secure their place in the prestigious nationwide Danmarksturneringen.

However, their stay in the higher division was challenging, with the team constantly battling to avoid relegation. In the 1950s, the focus shifted towards developing the youth teams, which would later yield legendary players and lead to a new era for Hvidovre. The 1960s marked a turning point, with young talents coached by Niels Hansen making a swift rise to the first team. The club gained national recognition by winning DBU&#x27;s first taentturnering, and players like Leif Sørensen showcased their potential.

===1962–1987: Golden years===
In 1962, Hvidovre was promoted to the third division and rapidly climbed the ranks of Danish football, culminating in winning the Danish championship in 1966. The club then played its first European club tournament match on 9 November 1966, in the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup, a 5–1 away loss to Eintracht Frankfurt. In 1967, Hvidovre surprisingly eliminated Swiss champions, Basel from the European Cup with an aggregate score of 5–4. In the following round, they sensationally managed to draw Spanish powerhouse Real Madrid 2–2 in front of 40,663 spectators at Københavns Idrætspark. However, Hvidovre were helpless in the return match. In front of 90,000 spectators at Santiago Bernabéu Stadium in Madrid, &quot;Los Blancos&quot; won 4–1.

During the early 1970s, Hvidovre consistently competed for the title. In 1970, they held the top position before the final round, but lost the title to B 1903 after a defeat to Vejle Boldklub. However, in 1973, they managed to secure another championship, largely thanks to the remarkable performance of their striker, Hans Aabech, who set a scoring record with 28 goals in 22 matches. Nevertheless, after both Aabech and their coach, Arne Sørensen, departed from the club, Hvidovre were relegated from the first division the following year.

In 1979, Hvidovre made a comeback to the top league, with John Sinding taking charge as the coach. They achieved a significant milestone in 1980 by winning the Danish Cup final in a thrilling 5–3 victory over Lyngby Boldklub, and the triumph continued into the next season when they secured the third Danish championship in the club&#x27;s history. Undoubtedly, the most significant match for the club during this pariod was the encounter with Serie A club Juventus in the 1982–83 European Cup. In the first leg on Danish turf, Hvidovre suffered a 4–1 defeat at Københavns Idrætspark in front of an audience of over 30,000 spectators. However, in the subsequent match at Stadio Comunale in Turin, they surprisingly managed to salvage a 3–3 draw despite being down 3–1 initially. At that point in time, Juventus boasted several players who had won the World Cup with Italy the previous summer: Dino Zoff, Claudio Gentile, Antonio Cabrini, Gaetano Scirea, Marco Tardelli, and Paolo Rossi. Furthermore, Juventus also featured Zbigniew Boniek from Poland and Michel Platini from France on their squad, both of whom had played pivotal roles in the 1982 World Cup. Hvidovre&#x27;s standout player during this period was their striker, Michael Manniche, who was eventually transferred to Portuguese club Benfica in 1983. In 1984, Hvidovre succeeded in acquiring talented young goalkeeper, Peter Schmeichel, from Gladsaxe-Hero Boldklub. He would later go on to be regarded as one of the greatest goalkeepers of all time, mainly known for his successful spell at Premier League club Manchester United.

Hvidovre competed a total of 17 seasons in the Danish top division from 1965 to 1985, winning three Danish championships and one Danish Cup title during this period.

Despite being relegated from the first division in 1985, they managed to bounce back the following year with Peter Schmeichel on the team. However, Schmeichel later moved to Brøndby after the promotion, and Hvidovre was relegated once again in 1987.

===1988–present: Ups and downs===

Thereafter, the club experienced a considerable downturn, resulting in their first-ever relegation to the fourth-tier Denmark Series in 1990. However, with Jan Kalborg as the head coach, the club made a comeback to the newly established top-tier, the Danish Superliga, for a solitary season in 1996–97.

From 1997 to 2003, Hvidovre played in the second-tier league, the Danish 1st Division, and during the period from 2000 to 2002, Peter Schmeichel invested in the club. Nevertheless, when the former national team goalkeeper withdrew his support from the project, the financial foundation for top-tier football crumbled, leading Hvidovre to experience another relegation to the Denmark Series in 2004. In 2007, Hvidovre returned to the Danish 1st Division after a 1–1 draw against FC Fyn.

At the end of the 2022–23 season, Hvidovre secured promotion to the Danish Superliga after Sønderjyske drew 3–3 against Næstved Boldklub. Their promotion meant a return to the first tier for the first time since 1997.

Hvidovre&#x27;s return to the Superliga for the 2023–24 season proved difficult. By late October, they were at the bottom of the league with just three points from 13 games, tying a negative Superliga record. They also set a new low for the fewest goals scored after 13 games, with only five goals. Head coach Per Frandsen remarked, &quot;The only positive is that we might be in &quot;Trivial Pursuit&quot;.&quot; The team&#x27;s poor form continued, and their relegation back to the 1st Division was confirmed on 12 May 2024, following a 2–2 draw against Randers.

<text>Ditrysia is a clade of lepidopterans that contains both butterflies and a majority of moth species. They are named for the fact that the female has two distinct sexual openings: one for mating, and the other for laying eggs.

About 98% of known Lepidoptera species belong to Ditrysia. As larvae, they initially feed on plants until they grow to become adults and feed on nectar. They function as herbivores, pollinators, and prey in terrestrial ecosystems, and can also be extremely damaging to crops. The Lepidoptera group can be divided into the primitive but paraphyletic &quot;micromoths&quot; and the derived monophyletic Apoditrysia, which include mostly larger moths, as well as the butterflies.
Those with a dorsal heart vessel belong in section Cossina. Others, having a ventral heart vessel, belong in section Tineina. While it is difficult to pinpoint the origin of affinities between clades, Tineoidea are found to be useful in understanding the vast diversity in Ditrysia. Obstecomera and Macrolepidoptera are other examples of Ditrysia&#x27;s subclades. Apoditrysia, Obtectomera, and Macrolepidoptera will be considered monophyletic if one or more organisms are either included or excluded from the clade.

<text>Wilburton is a small village of just over 1,000 inhabitants, situated in Cambridgeshire, England. It is 6 miles south west of Ely. While nominally an agricultural village, many residents work in Cambridge, Ely or London.

==History==

Wilburton is a parish of around 800 acres lying on the important medieval route from Earith to Stretham, and extending south to the River Great Ouse. As much of the land in the region is fenland, the village&#x27;s position on the ridge between Stretham and Haddenham at the southern end of the Isle of Ely was important in its growth and success. Listed as &quot;Wilburhtun&quot; in 970 and &quot;Wilbertone&quot; in the Domesday Book, the name &quot;Wilburton&quot; means &quot;Farmstead or village of a woman called Wilburh&quot;.

The village contains a number of old buildings, and was described in the 19th century as &quot;very neat and contains some excellent houses&quot;. These include the Burystead (the former manor house, built c.1600), one of the few surviving half-timbered houses in the region, and the Victoria Place row of cottages. For the last few hundred years, the Pell family were the prominent local landowners, sponsoring the Ely and St Ives Railway in the late 19th century. Wilburton railway station, built in 1866, has been open for goods trains only since 1931.

==Church==
The parish church, dedicated to St Peter consists of a chancel, north vestry and organ chamber, a nave, north chapel, south porch, and west tower. The chancel arch and tower date from the 13th century and the extensive rebuilding in the second half of the 15th century produced the chancel, vestry, nave, and porch. The organ chamber and north chapel were added in the late 19th century. The three-storey tower contains five bells, all dating from the 17th century.

==Village life==
Their village is home to an Elizabethan manor house and a garden centre. There was one public house, The King&#x27;s Head which closed in 2020 but plans exist for the public house to be reopend in the near future. There is also a hall called St Peter&#x27;s Hall that is used for events by the local community, such as school plays, wedding receptions, and after-school clubs. Adjoining St Peter&#x27;s Hall is a social club. The village holds a fireworks display around Guy Fawkes night and an annual beer festivals.

Wilburton is home to two amateur football teams, Wilburton Blades and Wilburton Albion. Wilburton Fc was formed in 2006 by two local residents after both previous teams folded. The club grew into having a first and reserve team with having over 50 players associated to the club. The club ran for over 6 years turning from bottom of the table to competing for the league and winning several Invitational cups and trophies during its 6-year history.

Opening in September 2018, Wilburton Football Academy will offer training to children aged 4 to 6 to take part in matches with other teams from the county. It will be located at the main recreational ground.

== Wilburton-Wallington Phase ==
The Wilburton-Wallington Phase is the name given by archaeologists to a metalworking stage of the Bronze Age in Britain spanning the period between c. 1140 BC and c. 1020 BC. The Wilburton complex was present in the south of Britain and the Wallington (Northumberland) complex in the north. Both are characterised by the introduction of copper-lead-tin alloys in bronze making and by the manufacture of leaf-shaped slashing swords, socketed spearheads secured to a shaft with a peg, horse-bits and socketed axes. It is paralleled by the Poldar industries in Scotland and the Roscommon industries in Ireland as well as being linked with the Urnfield A2-B1 in South Germany. It is preceded in Britain by the Penard Period, and followed by the Blackmoor Period.

<text>Sir William Neil Connor (26 April 1909 – 6 April 1967) was an English newspaper journalist for the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; who wrote under the pen name of &quot;Cassandra&quot;.

==Biography==
William Connor wrote a regular column for over 30 years between 1935 and 1 February 1967 with a short intermission for the Second World War, his column restarting after the war with the words &quot;As I was saying before I was so rudely interrupted, it is a powerful hard thing to please all of the people all of the time.&quot; He took his pen-name from Cassandra in Greek mythology, a tragic character who is given the gift of prophecy by Apollo but is then cursed so that no one will ever believe her.

The very popular column helped the &quot;Mirror&quot;″s readership to grow to the highest in its history during the 1950s. His columns were simply written, in keeping with his working class readership, and comprised slices of human life, including famous people, events and later a personal diary of his everyday life and thoughts – though at times he could be controversial. He worked alongside cartoonist Philip Zec at the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; and the pair courted controversy in 1942 with an illustration, captioned by Connor, which Winston Churchill and others perceived as an attack on government. Churchill complained to Cecil King, then a director of the company, of a writer (Connor) being &quot;dominated by malevolence&quot;. Connor forgave Churchill though, and later wrote a moving obituary of the wartime Prime Minister (&quot;Sword in the Scabbard&quot;, 25 January 1965) and attended his funeral service at St. Paul&#x27;s Cathedral.

In his best known columns, Connor said the author P. G. Wodehouse was a Nazi collaborator, a charge from which George Orwell defended Wodehouse, and in 1956 he strongly suggested that the entertainer Liberace was a homosexual. The suggestion was true, but Liberace sued for libel &quot;(Liberace v Daily Mirror)&quot; and won in 1959. During the case both Connor and Liberace lied under oath.

According to Roy Greenslade, Connor was &quot;an odd mix of liberal and reactionary&quot;, citing for the former his column attacking the enactment of the death sentence delivered to Ruth Ellis due on the day of its publication. He wrote: &quot;The one thing that brings stature and dignity to mankind and raises us above the beasts will have been denied her – pity and the hope of ultimate redemption.&quot;

In the years leading up to his death, Connor wrote more humorous columns and was regarded with affection by &quot;Mirror&quot; readers. Subjects ranged from the times he received wrong number calls intended for a nearby railway goods station, to the mysterious person who sent him a fresh goose egg once a year.

Connor was knighted in 1966. His final column ended with the words &quot;Normal service in this column is temporarily interrupted while I learn to do what any babe can do with ease and what comes naturally to most men of good conscience – to sleep easily o&#x27; nights.&quot;

He died aged 57 in hospital, a month after fracturing his skull in a fall.

Since his death, the column Cassandra in the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; has continued to be sporadically published. A new columnist, Keith Waterhouse, took over Connor&#x27;s place in the newspaper, but not his byline.

<text>In Norse mythology, the Sons of Ivaldi (Norse: &quot;Ívaldasynir&quot;) are a group of dwarfs who fashion Skíðblaðnir, the flying ship of Freyr, Gungnir, the spear belonging to Odin, as well as the golden hair for Sif to replace the hair that Loki had cut off.

According to &quot;Skáldskaparmál&quot;, after these objects were created Loki made a bet with a dwarf, Brokkr, that his brother Eitri (or Sindri) would not be able to craft items to match the quality of those displayed by the sons of Ivaldi. This contest resulted in the creation of the boar of Freyr (Gullinbursti), the ring of Odin (Draupnir) and the hammer of Thor (Mjolnir), which were judged by the gods to be even more wondrous than the others. Thus, Brokkr had won the bet.

The account of this tale given in &quot;Skáldskaparmál&quot; does not reveal the names of Ivaldi&#x27;s sons, nor how many there were, and they remain conspicuously absent after their initial mention in the stanza. The passing mention made of them in &quot;Grímnismál&quot; 43, the creators of Skidbladnir, &quot;the best of ships&quot;, likewise sheds no additional light. Thus, their identities are a matter of scholarly speculation.

In the eddic poem Hrafnagaldur Óðins, stanza 6, Idunn is identified as an &quot;elf&quot; (&quot;alfar&quot;) and the &quot;youngest of the elder children of Ivaldi&quot;. This implies that Ivaldi had two sets of children, probably by different mothers. Thus Idunn is a sister of the famous smiths, the Sons of Ivaldi.

In the Old Norse sources, the giant Þjazi is said to be the son of All-valdi [Harbardsljód 19] or Öl-valdi [Skaldskaparmal 42]. I-valdi may be another form of the name. Þjazi is said to have two brothers, Iði and Gangr, or Idi and Egil. Thus, Gang is another name for Egil. Egil is also found as a companion of Thor and keeps his goats safe when he ventures into the land of the giants.

<text>Henry Moore Teller (May 23, 1830February 23, 1914) was an American politician from Colorado, serving as a U.S. senator between 1876–1882 and 1885–1909, also serving as Secretary of the Interior between 1882 and 1885. He strongly opposed the Dawes Act, intended to break up communal Native American lands and force assimilation of the people, accurately stating that it was directed at forcing the Indians to give up their land so that it could be sold to white settlers. Among his most prominent achievements was authoring the Teller Amendment which definitively stated that, following the Spanish–American War, the United States would not annex Cuba, rather that the purpose of their involvement would be to help it gain independence from Spain.

==Biography==

===Life and early career===
Henry Moore Teller was given life into a large Methodist family on a farm in Granger, New York, in 1830. Educated at local academies when he was young, he went on to take up teaching in order to pay his way through law school. He interned in the office of Judge Martin Grover of Angelica, New York, and became a lawyer in 1858. Although was admitted to the state bar, he moved to Morrison, Illinois where he practiced law for three years and helped establish the Republican Party of Illinois. Following that, in 1861, Teller set up a law office in Central City, present-day Colorado, where he married Harriet M. Bruce and had two sons and a daughter. During that time, Teller also served as major general of Colorado militia from 1864 to 1867. In 1865, Teller was one of the chief organizers of the Colorado Central Railroad, writing its original charter and becoming its president for five years. Afterwards, until Colorado achieved statehood, Teller continued work as a corporate attorney, where he would gain enough prominence to be admitted to its upcoming Senate.

===Politics===
Following Colorado&#x27;s admission to the Union in 1876, Teller was elected by state legislature to be a U.S. senator. He served a brief three-month term, and was then elected for his first full six-year term, going on to be re-elected three more times and representing Colorado in the Senate for over 25 years. In 1882, President Chester Arthur named Teller secretary of the interior after Samuel Kirkwood resigned on April 17 of that year. As interior secretary, Teller had oversight of the Bureau of Indian Affairs, and vigorously opposed the allotment of Indian lands.

Beginning in 1880, Teller became ardently connected with the Free Silver question, doing much in and out of Congress with tongue and pen. Teller returned to the Senate in 1885. He was instrumental in securing a declaration in favor of bimetallism, and he was a conspicuous actor in the prolonged fight in the Senate against its unconditional repeal following the 1892 Republican National Convention. The decision thus made was to keep the gold standard intact indefinitely and, in response, Teller and 24 others marched out of the 1896 Republican National Convention. As a staunch supporter of bimetallism, along with being a prominent figure, he joined the other leading Silver Republicans and became leader of the Silver Republican Party. However, as bimetallism increasingly fell out of national politics, the party lost much of its influence, and many Silver Republicans returned to the Republican Party. Unlike them, however, Teller never returned to the Republican Party.

With the decline of the Silver Republican organization, Teller served as Colorado&#x27;s Democratic senator for the remainder of the time until 1909. Teller helped the Democratic Party gain more power in Colorado, which was previously dominated by Republicans.

During the Spanish–American War, Teller gained national prominence for influencing the creation of the Teller Amendment, an amendment to the Joint Resolution for the war with Spain, passed by the House and Senate on April 19, 1898.

After 33 years of service and retiring from Senate in 1909, Teller returned to practicing law in Colorado for the remainder of his life.

Teller died on February 23, 1914, and he is buried at Fairmount Cemetery in Denver.

==On foreign and domestic affairs==

===Native Americans===
Teller first became implicated in Native American affairs during the &quot;Indian troubles&quot; in 1863, when the Arapahoe and Cheyenne people were forced off the eastern plains of Colorado. For this reason, he was appointed major general of Colorado&#x27;s territorial militia in that same year, a post that he held until 1865.

Later on, Teller became one of the most outspoken opponents of the allotment of Native American land. Allotment was a process by which communal ownership of Indian lands would be ended and the land portioned out to individual Native Americans, with the &quot;excess&quot; to be sold to the government. In 1881, Teller said that allotment was a policy &quot;to despoil the Indians of their lands and to make them vagabonds on the face of the earth.&quot; Teller also said,

The real aim this bill is to get at the Indian lands and open them up to settlement. The provisions for the apparent benefit of the Indians are but the pretext to get at his lands and occupy them. ... If this were done in the name of greed, it would be bad enough; but to do it in the name of humanity, and under the cloak of an ardent desire to promote the Indian&#x27;s welfare by making him lie ourselves, whether he will or not, is infinitely worse.

Teller would be proven correct. Land owned by Indians decreased from in 1887 to in 1934.

As Secretary of the Interior with oversight over the Bureau of Indian Affairs, Teller also had a lot to do with reforming Native American schools. However, Teller&#x27;s defense of Indian land rights conflicts with his stance against traditional American Indian customs. For instance, in 1883 he approved the Indian Religious Crimes Code, codified by Commissioner of Indian Affairs Hiram Price, which sought to prohibit Native American traditional ceremonial activity throughout the United States. Customs, dances, plural marriage, and other practices were to be prosecuted by a &quot;Court of Indian Offenses,&quot; with authority to impose penalties of up to 90 days imprisonment and withholding government rations. The intent of the Code was to eliminate traditional Indian culture on reservations, however the Five Civilized Tribes were exempt from the code. Secretary Teller installed Indian judges to prosecute any Indians involved in the &quot;immoral&quot; dances, in addition to polygamy, and the sale of Indian wives. White missionaries, educators, and the federal government feared that the traditional dances were war dances, especially the Sun Dance by the Sioux, in which young men tested themselves in painful displays. Such suppressive measures against Indian culture were finally repealed by Commissioner John Collier in 1934.

===Cuba===
Probably one of Teller&#x27;s major achievements was, during the Spanish–American War in 1898, when he greatly influenced the creation of the Teller Amendment, which expressly set forth the United States&#x27; reasons for involvement in the war. Although condemned by some for preventing U.S. annexation of Cuba, Teller believed with conviction that the goal of the United States should be to support the Cuban War of Independence for an autonomous nation. As such, Teller made this apparent in his following statement:

I never could do better than now, when the American flag has come down from Cuba, but, better still, a flag for Cuba has gone up. The American flag is the best flag in the world for Americans. It is not the best flag for men who do not want it. It is not the best flag for Cuba. Cuba&#x27;s flag, not representing a hundredth part of the power or glory of ours, Is the flag for Cuba, and when the Filipinos shall put up their flag and ours shall come down, as I believe it will some day, it will be a better flag to them than ours can be, although you may administer your government with all the kindness and all the wisdom of which human beings are capable. The best flag is the flag that the men themselves put up. It is the only flag that ought to command the admiration and love and affection of the men who live under it, and it is the only flag that will. Liberty-loving men will never have any love for a flag that they do not create and that they do not defend. 

With such in mind, the fourth resolution of what would come to be known collectively as the Teller Amendment echoed this resolve. Henry M. Teller would later gain national recognition for his stance in Cuban affairs, and the political atmosphere following its approval became directed towards diplomacy assuring Cuban independence. However, this would be undermined by the later Platt Amendment until its abrogation in 1934.

<doc id="920163" wikidata="Q533901" url="?curid=920163" title="Diallo Telli">
<text>Boubacar Diallo Telli (1925 – February 1977) was a Guinean diplomat and politician. He helped found the Organisation of African Unity (OAU) and was the second secretary-general of the OAU between 1964 and 1972. After serving as Minister of Justice in Guinea for four years he was executed by starvation by the regime of Ahmed Sékou Touré at Camp Boiro in 1977.

==Early career==
Diallo Telli was born in 1925 in Porédaka, Guinea. He was of Fulani origin. He studied at École normale supérieure William Ponty. He studied for his baccalauréat at Dakar, and then went to the École Nationale de la France d&#x27;Outre-Mer, in Paris, France.
In 1951 he received his Licence en Droit, and in 1954 his Doctorate in Law. That year he was appointed Deputy of the Procureur (District Attorney) of the Republic at the Court of Thiès in Senegal.
He was then appointed to the court in Cotonou, Benin (then Dahomey).
In 1955, he became head of the Office of High Commissioner of French West Africa (AOF) in Dakar, which was the highest position held by an African in the French colonial period. He became Secretary General of the AOF in April 1957 and remained in that post for eighteen months.

==Diplomatic career==
After the referendum of 28 September 1958, in which Guinea chose independence from French West Africa, Telli was sent to the United States as Permanent Representative of Guinea at the United Nations. He held that position until June 1964 with a break between June 1960 and March 1961.
He was also Ambassador to the United States from April 1959 to June 1961.

Telli held the position of second Secretary General of OAU, holding that office for two terms from July 1964 until June 1972. The job was extremely challenging for him, as he expressed it involved negotiating a common viewpoint among the many leaders of African states, each of whom had divergent opinions. In an article published in the Fall of 1965, Telli acknowledged the difficulties and disputes but asserted that the organization had a flexible enough structure to deal with these problems, and asked what would have happened if there had been no OAU.

At times Telli was criticized for his outspokenness. Some criticized him for pushing Sékou Touré&#x27;s views too strongly.
In July 1968 it was reported that he was unlikely to be appointed for a second term since he had not shown neutrality.
A report on the OAU summit in Algiers in September 1968 covered Telli&#x27;s position on the Nigerian Civil War. Although the members generally supported Federal Nigeria, some countries such as Ivory Coast, Tanzania, Zambia and Gabon recognized Biafra.
Overall, Telli was a strong and respected spokesman for the OAU.

==Minister of Justice==
In June 1972, Telli was succeeded by Nzo Ekangaki of Cameroon as OAU Secretary-General.
Telli returned to Guinea and was appointed Minister of Justice on 21 August 1972.
His decision to return to Guinea was puzzling. He had many other offers from African heads of state and international organizations. He would also be in danger. Some people in Guinea even thought that Sékou Touré had used occult means to lure him back.
According to Andre Lewin, Touré&#x27;s biographer, Telli was the only person who could potentially challenge Touré in his Presidency. Therefore, Touré felt a special need to destroy him.

As Minister of Justice, at a conference at the University of Conakry, he stated that justice was the key that opened all doors, and urged students to pursue legal studies. However, Telli obeyed party directives and was the author of the law of June 1973 that removed all independence from the judiciary, creating people&#x27;s courts at the village and neighborhood levels. His technical counselor at the time said that Telli was &quot;naive, very nervous, often super-exited, very careless in his words and actions, full of candor and disordered in his work.&quot; After the reconciliation between France and Guinea in July 1975, Sékou Touré suggested, at a meal celebrating the occasion, that Telli could be a suitable candidate to be Secretary-General of the United Nations.

==Death==
On 18 July 1976, Diallo Telli was arrested at his home and imprisoned at Camp Boiro. Mamadi Keïta, the President&#x27;s brother-in-law, was head of the commission of inquiry that condemned Telli. Telli was accused of leading a plot by Fulanis against the state of Guinea. He was subjected to intense interrogations, torture and an inadequate diet. After the second torture session, Telli was shattered and agreed to sign a &quot;confession&quot; of his treason. This was an incoherent document even after editing by the tribunal. In February 1977 five prominent prisoners were killed through the &quot;black diet&quot; (no food or water): Diallo Telli, ex-ministers Barry Alpha Oumar and Dramé Alioune, and army officers Diallo Alhassana and Kouyate Laminé. The OAU did not react to the death of its former Secretary General. However, the disappearance of Telli, a widely respected international diplomat known for his dignity and good nature, did contribute to growing international awareness of the abuses of the Touré regime.

<text>Hamhŭng (&quot;Hamhŭng-si&quot;; ) is North Korea&#x27;s second-most populous city, the capital of South Hamgyŏng Province and the 16th largest city in the Korea Peninsula. Located in the southern part of the South Hamgyong province, Hamhung is the main and most populous metropolitan area in the province. Hamhung was centrally planned and built by the government of North Korea.

== Administrative divisions ==
Hamhŭng is divided into 7 &quot;guyŏk&quot; (wards):

==Geography==
Hamhŭng is on the left branch of the Ch&#x27;ŏngch&#x27;ŏn River, on the eastern part of the Hamhŭng plain (), in South Hamgyŏng Province, northeast North Korea. Its highest point is Mount Tonghŭng, which is high.

===Climate===
Hamhung has a humid continental climate (Köppen climate classification: &quot;Dwa&quot;), with warm, humid summers, and moderately cold, dry winters. Being located by the Sea of Japan, its climate is directly influenced by it, resulting in warmer winters and cooler summers than areas similar in latitude on the western coast. The longer period of warmer temperatures favors the growing of crops.
==History==

The city was called either Hamju (as recorded in 1108, the third year of King Yejeong) or Hamjumok (as recorded in 1369, 18th year of King Gongmin). It received its current name of Hamhung in 1416, when it was promoted to a &#x27;bu&#x27;. The Sino-Korean word &#x27;흥&#x27; (Hancha: 興), added to the original name of Hamju, means that the town would prosper.

Yi Seong-gye, founder of the Yi dynasty, retired to the city after a successful palace coup by his son Yi Bang-won in 1400. Though his son sent envoys to reconcile, his father had them killed. A modern Korean expression, &#x27;King&#x27;s envoy to Hamhŭng&#x27; (), refers to a person who goes on a journey and is never heard from again. It was known as &quot;Kankō&quot; during Japanese rule of Korea between 1910 and 1945. It was liberated by the Red Army on 22 August 1945.

The city was 80–90% destroyed by American air raids during the Korean War (1950–1953) and was occupied by ROK troops between 17 October 1950 and 17 December 1950. From 1955 to 1962, Hamhŭng was the object of a large-scale program of reconstruction and development by East Germany including the build-up of construction-related industries and intense training measures for Korean construction workers, engineers, city planners and architects. When the Bauhaus trained architect Konrad Püschel, the first Head of City Planning for the reconstruction project arrived in 1955, he was accompanied by about 175 members of the &quot;Deutsche Arbeitsgruppe (DAG)&quot; or German Working Group Hamhung as the project team was called.
The project ended two years earlier than scheduled and with a low profile because of the Sino-Soviet conflict and the opposing positions that North Korea and East Germany took on that issue.

From 1960 to 1967, Hamhŭng was administered separately from South Hamgyŏng as a Directly Governed City (&quot;Chikhalsi&quot;). Before 1960 and since 1967, the city has been part of South Hamgyŏng Province.

In 1995, Hamhŭng witnessed, thus far, one of the only documented challenges to the North Korean government when famine-ravaged soldiers began a march toward Pyongyang. The revolt was quelled, and the unit of soldiers was disbanded.

The North Korean famine of the 1990s appears to have had a disproportionate effect on the people of Hamhung. Andrew Natsios, a former aid worker, USAID administrator, and author of &quot;The Great North Korean Famine&quot;, described Hamhung as &quot;the city most devastated by [the] famine.&quot; Contemporary published reports from &quot;The Washington Post&quot; and Reuters describe numerous fresh graves on the surrounding hillsides and report that many of Hamhung&#x27;s children were stunted by malnutrition. One survivor claimed that more than 10% of the city&#x27;s population died, with another 10% fleeing the city in search of food. Despite previously being closed to foreigners, foreign nationals can now travel to Hamhung through the few approved North Korean tour operators.

There is speculation that Hamhung, with its high proportion of chemists and the site of a chemical-industrial complex built by the Japanese during World War II, might be the center for North Korea&#x27;s methamphetamine production.

==Economy==
Hamhung is much more economically diverse than most cities in North Korea, as Hamhung has many unique industries. Hamhung&#x27;s rural areas are used for farm land and food distribution through the community. These lands mainly consist of paddies, but other crops are grown in small portion as well. Hamhŭng is an important chemical industry center in the DPRK. It is an industrial city which serves as a major port for North Korean foreign trade. Production includes textiles (particularly vinalon), metalware, machinery, refined oil and processed food. 2·8 vinalon union enterprise is located here.

While prior to liberation of Korea Hamhung had an extremely backwards economy due to the destructive actions of the Japanese, the city was rapidly developed afterwards, with new industrial districts being built and being broken free of colonial acquisitions of material. Much of the heavy industrial equipment used in other cities are built in Hamhung, and its production contributes to the monumental construction of buildings under projects launched by the Workers&#x27; Party.

==Transportation==
The city is a transportation hub, connecting various eastern ports and the northern interior area. Hamhung Station is on the Pyongra Line railway. This city is connected by air too, with Sondok Airport. The city is also served by the narrow gauge, commuter Soho Line linking West Hamhung to Hungnam, via February 28 Vinylon factory.

The city has a large trolleybus network, which opened in 1973 with the Hoyang - Doksong line, with a depot located at the northern Doksong terminus. The second and third lines, a pair of intercity lines from Hamhung station to the Hungnam area, was opened on 27 July 1991. This line had two branches, one to Hungdok and one to Ryongsong with the depot in Hungdok, though the latter line was closed and dismantled sometime in the early 2000s. A set of overhead wires connects the two separate lines, though there is no regular movement on this line. The lines were served by 28 trolleybuses in 2013.

==Culture==
 Hamhŭng hosts the Hamhŭng Grand Theatre, the largest theatre in North Korea. A national museum is located in Hamhŭng. Hamhŭng is also well known for Naengmyeon, a traditional Korean style cold buckwheat noodle. Unlike Pyongyang cold noodle, Hamhŭng cold noodles tends to be more spicy, zesty, and have more garnish over the buckwheat noodle.

==Education==
Hamhŭng is home to the Hamhung University of Education, Hamhŭng University of Pharmacy, Hamhung University of Chemical Industry and Hamhŭng University of Medicine. Professional colleges in Hamhŭng include the Hamhŭng College of Quality Control, the Hamhŭng Hydrographic and Power College, and the Hamhŭng College of Electronics and Automation. There is also a branch academy of science.

In 2018, the South Hamgyong Sci-Tech Library, the largest facility of its kind outside Pyongyang, opened in the city.

==Prisons==
Two reeducation camps are located near Hamhung: Kyo-hwa-so No. 9 is in northeastern Hamhung, and Kyo-hwa-so No. 22 is in Yonggwang County north of Hamhung.

==People born in Hamhŭng==

<doc id="920174" wikidata="Q3833924" url="?curid=920174" title="List of Mayflower passengers">
<text>This is a list of the passengers on board the &quot;Mayflower&quot; during its trans-Atlantic voyage of September 6 – November 9, 1620, the majority of them becoming the settlers of Plymouth Colony in Massachusetts. Of the passengers, 37 were members of a separatist Puritan congregation in Leiden, The Netherlands (also known as Brownists), who were seeking to establish a colony in the New World where they could practice their religion without interference from the English government or church. The &quot;Mayflower&quot; departed with 102 passengers, 74 male and 28 female, and a crew headed by Master Christopher Jones. About half of the passengers died in the first winter. Many Americans can trace their ancestry back to one or more of these individuals who have become known as the Pilgrims.

== Members of the Leiden, Holland Congregation ==

Note: An asterisk on a name indicates those who died in the winter of 1620–21.

*Allerton, Isaac (possibly Suffolk).

**Bartholomew Allerton, 7, son (Leiden, Holland).
**Remember Allerton, 5, daughter (Leiden).

== Passenger activities and care ==
Some families traveled together, while some men came alone, leaving families in England and Leiden. Two wives on board were pregnant; Elizabeth Hopkins gave birth to son Oceanus while at sea, and Susanna White gave birth to son Peregrine in late November while the ship was anchored in Cape Cod Harbor. He is historically recognized as the first European child born in the New England area. One young man died during the voyage, and there was one stillbirth during the construction of the colony.
According to the &quot;Mayflower&quot; passenger list, just over half of the passengers were Puritan Separatists and their dependents. They sought to break away from the established Church of England and create a society along the lines of their religious ideals. 
Other passengers were hired hands, servants, or farmers recruited by London merchants, all originally destined for the Colony of Virginia. Four of this latter group of passengers were small children given into the care of &quot;Mayflower&quot; pilgrims as indentured servants. The Virginia Company began the transportation of children in 1618. Until relatively recently, the children were thought to be orphans, foundlings, or involuntary child labor. At that time, children were routinely rounded up from the streets of London or taken from poor families receiving church relief to be used as laborers in the colonies. Any legal objections to the involuntary transportation of the children were overridden by the Privy Council. For instance it has been proven that the four More children were sent to America because they were deemed illegitimate. Three of the four More children died in the first winter in the New World, but Richard lived to be approximately 81, dying in Salem, probably in 1695 or 1696.

The passengers mostly slept and lived in the low-ceilinged great cabins and on the main deck, which was 75 by 20 feet large (23 m × 6 m) at most. The cabins were thin-walled and extremely cramped, and the total area was 25 ft by 15 ft (7.6 m × 4.5 m) at its largest. Below decks, any person over five feet (150 cm) tall would be unable to stand up straight. The maximum possible space for each person would have been slightly less than the size of a standard single bed.

Passengers would pass the time by reading by candlelight or playing cards and games such as nine men&#x27;s morris. Meals on board were cooked by the firebox, which was an iron tray with sand in it on which a fire was built. This was risky because it was kept in the waist of the ship. Passengers made their own meals from rations that were issued daily and food was cooked for a group at a time.

Upon arrival in America, the harsh climate and scarcity of fresh food were exacerbated by the shortness of provisions due to the delay in departure. Living in these extremely close and crowded quarters, several passengers developed scurvy, a disease caused by a deficiency of vitamin C. At the time the use of lemons or limes to counter this disease was unknown, and the usual dietary sources of vitamin C in fruits and vegetables had been depleted, since these fresh foods could not be stored for long periods without their becoming rotten. Passengers who developed scurvy experienced symptoms such as bleeding gums, teeth falling out, and stinking breath. Passengers consumed large amounts of alcohol such as beer with meals. This was known to be safer than water, which often came from polluted sources causing diseases. All food and drink was stored in barrels known as &quot;hogsheads&quot;.

No cattle or beasts of draft or burden were brought on the journey, but there were pigs, goats, and poultry. Some passengers brought family pets such as cats and birds. Peter Browne took his large bitch mastiff, and John Goodman brought along his spaniel.

The passenger William Mullins brought 126 pairs of shoes and 13 pairs of boots in his luggage. Other items included oiled leather and canvas suits, stuff gowns and leather and stuff breeches, shirts, jerkins, doublets, neckcloths, hats and caps, hose, stockings, belts, piece goods, and haberdashery. At his death, his estate consisted of extensive footwear and other items of clothing, and made his daughter Priscilla and her husband John Alden quite prosperous.

== &quot;Mayflower&quot; officers and crew ==
According to author Charles Edward Banks, the &quot;Mayflower&quot; had 14 officers consisting of the master, four mates, four quartermasters, surgeon, carpenter, cooper, cook, boatswain, and gunner, plus about 36 men before the mast for a total of 50. More recent authors estimate a crew of about 30. The entire crew stayed with the &quot;Mayflower&quot; in Plymouth through the winter of 1620–21, and about half of them died. The surviving crew returned to London on the &quot;Mayflower&quot; on April 5, 1621.
===Crew members per various sources===
Banks states that the crew totaled 36 men before the mast and 14 officers, making a total of 50. Nathaniel Philbrick estimates between 20 and 30 sailors in her crew whose names are unknown. Nick Bunker states that &quot;Mayflower&quot; had a crew of at least 17 and possibly as many as 30. Caleb Johnson states that the ship carried a crew of about 30 men, but the exact number is unknown.
===Officers and crew===
* Captain: Christopher Jones. About age 50, of Harwich, a seaport in Essex, England, which was also the port of his ship &quot;Mayflower&quot;. He and his ship were veterans of the European cargo business, often carrying wine to England, but neither had ever crossed the Atlantic. By June 1620, he and &quot;Mayflower&quot; had been hired for the Pilgrims voyage by their business agents in London, Thomas Weston of the Merchant Adventurers and Robert Cushman.
* Masters Mate: John Clark (Clarke), Pilot. By age 45 in 1620, Clark already had greater adventures than most other mariners of that dangerous era. His piloting career began in England about 1609. In early 1611, he was pilot of a 300-ton ship on his first New World voyage, with a three-ship convoy sailing from London to the new settlement of Jamestown in Virginia. Two other ships were in that convoy, and the three ships brought 300 new settlers to Jamestown, going first to the Caribbean islands of Dominica and Nevis. While in Jamestown, Clark piloted ships in the area carrying various stores. During that time, he was taken prisoner in a confrontation with the Spanish; he was taken to Havana and held for two years, then transferred to Spain where he was in custody for five years. In 1616, he was finally freed in a prisoner exchange with England. In 1618, he was back in Jamestown as pilot of the ship &quot;Falcon&quot;. Shortly after his return to England, he was hired as pilot for &quot;Mayflower&quot; in 1620.
* Masters Mate: Robert Coppin, Pilot. Coppin had prior New World experience; he previously hunted whales in Newfoundland and sailed the coast of New England. He was an early investor in the Virginia Company, being named in the Second Virginia Charter of 1609. He was possibly from Harwich in Essex, the hometown of Captain Jones.
* Masters Mate: Andrew Williamson
* Masters Mate: John Parker
* Surgeon: Doctor Giles Heale. The surgeon on board &quot;Mayflower&quot; was never mentioned by Bradford, but his identity was well established. He was essential in providing comfort to all who died or were made ill that first winter. He was a young man from Drury Lane in the parish of St. Giles in the Field, London who had completed his apprenticeship with the Barber-Surgeons in the previous year. On February 21, 1621, he was a witness to the death-bed will of William Mullins. He survived the first winter and returned to London on &quot;Mayflower&quot; in April 1621, where he began his medical practice and worked as a surgeon until his death in 1653.
* Cooper: John Alden. Alden was a 21-year-old from Harwich in Essex and a distant relative of Captain Jones. He hired on apparently while &quot;Mayflower&quot; was anchored at Southampton Waters. He was responsible for maintaining the ship&#x27;s barrels, known as hogsheads, which were critical to the passengers&#x27; survival and held the only source of food and drink while at sea; tending them was a job which required a crew member&#x27;s attention. Bradford noted that Alden was &quot;left to his own liking to go or stay&quot; in Plymouth rather than return with the ship to England. He decided to remain.
* Quartermaster: (names unknown), 4 men. These men were in charge of maintaining the ship&#x27;s cargo hold, as well as the crew&#x27;s hours for standing watch. Some of the “&quot; crewmen may also have been in this section. These quartermasters were also responsible for fishing and maintaining all fishing supplies and harpoons. The names of the quartermasters are unknown, but it is known that three of the four men died the first winter.
* Cook: (Gorge Hurst). He was responsible for preparing the crew&#x27;s meals and maintaining all food supplies and the cook room, which was typically located in the ship&#x27;s forecastle (front end). The unnamed cook died the first winter.
* Master Gunner: (name unknown). He was in charge of the ship&#x27;s guns, ammunition, and powder. Some of those &quot;before the mast&quot; were likely in his charge. He is recorded as going on an exploration on December 6, 1620, and was &quot;sick unto death and so remained all that day, and the next night&quot;. He died later that winter.
* Boatswain: (name unknown). He was the person in charge of the ship&#x27;s rigging and sails, the anchors, and the ship&#x27;s longboat. The majority of the crew members &quot;before the mast&quot; were most likely under his supervision, working the sails and rigging. The operation of the ship&#x27;s shallop was also probably under his control, a light open boat with oars or sails (see seaman Thomas English). William Bradford made this comment about the boatswain: &quot;the boatswain... was a proud young man, who would often curse and scoff at the passengers, but when he grew weak they had compassion on him and helped him.&quot; But despite such assistance, the unnamed boatswain died the first winter.
* Carpenter: (name unknown). He was responsible for making sure that the hull was well-caulked and the masts were in good order. He was the person responsible for maintaining all areas of the ship in good condition and being a general repairman. He also maintained the tools and all necessary items to perform his carpentry tasks. His name is unknown, but his tasks were quite important to the safety and seaworthiness of the ship.
* Swabber: (various crewmen). This was the lowliest position on the ship, responsible for cleaning (swabbing) the decks. The swabber usually had an assistant who was responsible for cleaning the ship&#x27;s beakhead (extreme front end), which was also the crew&#x27;s toilet.

===Known &quot;Mayflower&quot; seamen===
* John Allerton: A &quot;Mayflower&quot; seaman who was hired by the company as labor to help in the Colony during the first year, then to return to Leiden to help other church members seeking to travel to America. He signed the Mayflower Compact. He was a seaman on ship&#x27;s shallop with Thomas English on exploration of December 6, 1620, and died sometime before &quot;Mayflower&quot; returned to England in April 1621.
* ____ Ely: A &quot;Mayflower&quot; seaman who was contracted to stay for a year, which he did. He returned to England with fellow crewman William Trevor on the Fortune in December 1621. Genealogist Jeremy Bangs believes that his name was either John or Christopher Ely (or Ellis), both of whom are documented in Leiden, Holland.
* Thomas English: A &quot;Mayflower&quot; seaman who was hired to be the master of the shallop (see Boatswain) and to be part of the company. He signed the Mayflower Compact. He was a seaman on the ship&#x27;s shallop with John Allerton on exploration of December 6, 1620, and died sometime before the departure of &quot;Mayflower&quot; for England in April 1621. He appeared in Leiden records as &quot;Thomas England&quot;.
* William Trevore (Trevor): A &quot;Mayflower&quot; seaman who was hired to remain in Plymouth for one year. One reason for his hiring was his prior New World experience. He was one of those seamen to crew the shallop used in coastal trading. He returned to England with _____ Ely and others on the Fortune in December 1621. In 1623, Robert Cushman noted that Trevor reported to the Adventurers about what he saw in the New World. He did at some time return as master of a ship and was recorded living in Massachusetts Bay Colony in April 1650.

===Unidentified passenger===
* &quot;Master&quot; Leaver: Another passenger not mentioned by Bradford is a person called &quot;Master&quot; Leaver. He was named in Mourt&#x27;s Relation (London, 1622), under a date of January 12, 1621, as a leader of an expedition to rescue Pilgrims lost in the forest for several days while searching for housing-roof thatch. It is unknown in what capacity he came to &quot;Mayflower&quot; and his given name is unknown. The title of &quot;Master&quot; indicates that he was a person of some authority and prominence in the company. He may have been a principal officer of &quot;Mayflower&quot;. No more is known of him; he may have returned to England on &quot;Mayflower&quot;″s April 1621 voyage or died of the illnesses that affected so many that first winter.

===Known crew members===
*Christopher Jones – Captain
*John Clarke – First Mate and Pilot
*Robert Coppin – Second Mate and Pilot
*Giles Heale – ship&#x27;s surgeon, identified with the Separatists. He is not counted as one of the 102 passengers.
*Andrew Williamson – Seaman
*John Parker – Seaman
*Master Leaver – Seaman

===Ship crewmen hired to stay one year===
*John Alden – A 21-year-old from Harwich, Essex, the ship&#x27;s cooper; he was given the choice of remaining in the colony or returning to England and decided to remain.
*John Allerton* – A &quot;Mayflower&quot; seaman hired as colony labor for one year who was then to return to Leiden to assist church members with travel to America. He died some time before the &quot;Mayflower&quot; departed for England on April 5, 1621.
*____ Ely – A &quot;Mayflower&quot; seaman contracted to stay for one year. He returned to England on the &quot;Fortune&quot; in December 1621 along with William Trevor. Jeremy Bangs believes that his name was either John or Christopher Ely, or Ellis, who are documented in Leiden records.
*Thomas English* – A &quot;Mayflower&quot; seaman hired to be master of the ship&#x27;s shallop. He died sometime before the departure of the &quot;Mayflower&quot; for England on April 5, 1621.
*William Trevore – A &quot;Mayflower&quot; seaman with prior New World experience hired to work in the colony for one year. He returned to England on the &quot;Fortune&quot; in December 1621 along with Ely and others. By 1650, he had returned to New England.

Note: &quot;Asterisk on any name indicates those who died in the winter of 1620–21&quot;.

==Animals on board==
Two dogs are known to have participated in settling Plymouth. In &quot;Mourt&#x27;s Relation&quot;, Edward Winslow writes that a female English Mastiff and a small English Springer Spaniel came ashore on the first explorations of Provincetown. The ship was probably also carrying small domestic animals such as goats, pigs, and chickens. Larger domestic animals came later, such as cows and sheep.

<text>Howard Martin Temin (December 10, 1934 – February 9, 1994) was an American geneticist and virologist. He discovered reverse transcriptase in the 1970s at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, for which he shared the 1975 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine with Renato Dulbecco and David Baltimore.

==Early life and education==
Temin was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, to Jewish parents, Annette (Lehman), an activist, and Henry Temin, an attorney. As a high school student at Central High School in Philadelphia, he participated in the Jackson Laboratory&#x27;s Summer Student Program in Bar Harbor, Maine. The director of the program, C.C. Little, told his parents that Temin was &quot;unquestionably the finest scientist of the fifty-seven students who have attended the program since the beginning...I can&#x27;t help but feel this boy is destined to become a really great man in the field of science.&quot; Temin said that his experience at Jackson&#x27;s Laboratory is what originally interested him in science.

Temin&#x27;s parents raised their family to have values associated with social justice and independent thinking, which was evident throughout his life. For Temin&#x27;s bar mitzvah, the family donated money that would have been spent on the party to a local camp for displaced persons. Temin was also the valedictorian of his class and he devoted his speech to relevant issues at the time including the recent hydrogen bomb activity and the news of sending a man to the moon.

Temin received a bachelor&#x27;s degree from Swarthmore College in 1955 majoring and minoring in biology in the honors program. He received his doctorate degree in animal virology from the California Institute of Technology in 1960.

==Career and research==
Temin&#x27;s first exposure to experimental science was during his time at the California Institute of Technology as a graduate student in laboratory of Professor Renato Dulbecco. Temin originally studied embryology at Caltech, but after about a year and a half, he switched to animal virology. He became interested Dulbecco&#x27;s lab after a chance run-in with Harry Rubin, a postdoctoral fellow in Dulbecco&#x27;s lab. In the lab, Temin studied the Rous sarcoma virus, a tumor-causing virus that infects chickens. During his research on the virus, he observed that mutations in the virus yielded alterations in the structural characteristics of the infected cell – thus, integration into the cell&#x27;s genome was occurring. As part of his doctoral thesis, Temin stated that the Rous Sarcoma Virus has &quot;some kind of close relationship with the genome of the infected cell&quot;. Following receiving his doctorate, Temin continued to work in Dulbecco&#x27;s lab as a postdoctoral fellow.

In 1960, the McArdle Laboratory for Cancer Research at the University of Wisconsin–Madison recruited Temin as a virologist; a position that had been hard to fill because, at the time, virology was not considered pertinent to cancer research. Even though Temin knew he would be completely independent in Madison, because of the lack of research involving virology and oncology together, Temin stated that he was &quot;supremely self-confident&quot;. When he first arrived in Madison in 1960, he found an unprepared laboratory in the basement of a rundown building with an office that could be considered a closet. Until a more suitable laboratory could be prepared, he continued his research with RSV at a friend&#x27;s laboratory at the University of Illinois. Later that year, he returned to Madison, continued his RSV research in his own lab, and began his position as an assistant professor.

While studying the Rous sarcoma virus at UW-Madison, Temin began to refer to the genetic material that the virus introduced to the cells, the &quot;provirus&quot;. Using the antibiotic, actinomycin D, which inhibits the expression of DNA, he determined that the provirus was DNA or was located on the cell&#x27;s DNA. These results implied that the infecting Rous sarcoma virus was somehow generating complementary double-stranded DNA. Temin&#x27;s description of how tumor viruses act on the genetic material of the cell through reverse transcription was revolutionary. This upset the widely held belief at the time of a popularized version of the &quot;Central Dogma&quot; of molecular biology posited by Nobel laureate Francis Crick, one of the co-discoverers of the structure of DNA (along with James Watson and Rosalind Franklin). Crick had claimed only that sequence information cannot flow out of protein into DNA or RNA, but he was commonly interpreted as saying that information flows exclusively from DNA to RNA to protein. Many highly respected scientists disregarded his work and declared it impossible. Despite the lack of support from the scientific community, Temin continued to search for evidence to support his idea. In 1969, Temin and a postdoctoral fellow, Satoshi Mizutani, began searching for the enzyme that was responsible for the phenomenon of viral RNA being transferred into proviral DNA. Later that year, Temin showed that certain tumor viruses carried the enzymatic ability to reverse the flow of information from RNA back to DNA using reverse transcriptase. Reverse transcriptase was also independently and simultaneously discovered in association with the murine leukemia virus by David Baltimore at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. In 1975, Baltimore and Temin shared the Nobel Prize of Physiology or Medicine. Both scientists completed their initial work with RNA-dependent DNA polymerase with the Rous sarcoma virus.

The discovery of reverse transcriptase is one of the most important of the modern era of medicine, as reverse transcriptase is the central enzyme in several widespread viral diseases such as AIDS and Hepatitis B. Reverse transcriptase is also an important component of several important techniques in molecular biology, such as the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, and diagnostic medicine.

===Mentoring===
Temin has mentored some PhD students, including Edward F. Fritsch, co-author of the most-cited book of all time.

===Awards and honors===
Temin was a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences (1973), the United States National Academy of Sciences (1974), and the American Philosophical Society (1978). In 1992 Temin received the National Medal of Science. Temin was elected a Foreign Member of the Royal Society (ForMemRS) in 1988.

Following winning the Nobel Prize, Temin focused his research mainly on studying the viral sequences that control the packaging of viral RNA, developing a new vaccine for HIV, and studying the mechanisms of retroviral variation.

==Life and career post-Nobel Prize==
After receiving the Nobel Prize in 1975, Temin went from a rebel in the scientific community to a highly respected researcher. Temin began receiving international recognition for his work, and used his newly acquired fame to improve the world. An example of this was in October 1976; Temin helped scientists in the Soviet Union that were targeted by the KGB, the secret police in the Soviet Union. The Jewish Soviet scientists had been stripped of their jobs and oppressed after requesting visas to emigrate to Israel. Temin made it his mission to personally visit the scientists and their families. He gave them gifts that could be resold to help them financially, and he gave the scientists copies of scientific journals, which had been banned by the KGB. On one occasion, Howard Temin gave a lecture to some of the Jewish Soviet scientists in someone&#x27;s home. The next morning, almost all of scientists that had attended the lecture were arrested. After they were released, Temin tape-recorded one of the scientist&#x27;s account of the event and gave the tape to newspapers in the United States so that the situation that Jewish scientists were facing would be publicized.

Another example of Temin trying to improve the world was at the Nobel Prize reception. After receiving the Nobel Prize from King Carl Gustav of Sweden; Temin addressed the smokers in the audience, which included the Queen of Denmark, saying he was &quot;outraged that one major measure available to prevent much cancer, namely the cessation of smoking, had not been more widely adopted&quot;. He had also insisted that the ashtray located on the laureates&#x27; table be removed.

After winning the Nobel Prize, Temin also became more active in the scientific community outside of research. He was involved in over 14 scientific journals. In 1979, he became an advisory member for the director of the National Institute of Health (NIH) and a member of the human gene therapy subgroup of the recombinant DNA advisory committee. He was also a member of the National Cancer Advisory Board, and the chairman of the AIDS subcommittee. At the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), he was the chairman of a genetic variation advisory panel on the development of AIDS, and was a member of vaccine advisory board. In the National Academy of Sciences (NAS), he was a member of the Waksman Award committee and report review committee. In 1986, Temin became a member of the Institute of Medicine (IOM)/NAS committee for national strategy for public policy issues associated with AIDS. The last committee Temin served on was the World Health Organization Advisory Council.

In 1981, Temin became a founding member of the World Cultural Council.

==Death and legacy==
Temin taught and conducted research at UW-Madison until he died of lung cancer, on February 9, 1994. He was survived by his wife Rayla, a geneticist at UW-Madison, two daughters, and two brothers, Peter Temin, also an academic, and Michael Temin, a lawyer.

<text>Vladimir Perić (; 28 December 1919 – 5/6 April 1945), best known by the &quot;nom de guerre&quot; Valter, was a Yugoslav Partisan commander in German-occupied Sarajevo during World War II.

Born in the Serbian town of Prijepolje, he became a member of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia (KPJ) in 1940. The following year, he joined the Partisans and was appointed deputy political commissar of a Partisan unit in eastern Bosnia in 1942. In 1943, Perić became secretary of the Sarajevo committee of the KPJ and took charge of anti-sabotage actions in the city in early 1945. While visiting a tobacco factory at midnight on 5–6 April, Perić was killed after a German soldier hurled a hand grenade at him. His death made him one of the last Sarajevans killed in World War II.

==Early life==
Vladimir Perić was born in the town of Prijepolje on 28 December 1919. He graduated from a trade school in his hometown and moved to Belgrade to attend business school. His school years were characterized by constant poverty and he struggled to find work to pay for his education. From 1938 to 1940, Perić worked at the State Mortgage Bank of Yugoslavia in Belgrade. In 1940, he became a member of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia (; KPJ). Shortly afterwards, he was transferred to the bank&#x27;s Sarajevo branch.

==World War II==

On 6 April 1941, Axis forces invaded Yugoslavia. Poorly equipped and poorly trained, the Royal Yugoslav Army was quickly defeated. After the invasion, Yugoslavia was dismembered, with the extreme Croat nationalist and fascist Ante Pavelić, who had been in exile in Benito Mussolini&#x27;s Italy, being appointed &quot;Poglavnik&quot; (leader) of an Ustaše-led Croatian state – the Independent State of Croatia (often called the NDH, from the ). The NDH combined almost all of modern-day Croatia, all of modern-day Bosnia and Herzegovina and parts of modern-day Serbia into an &quot;Italian-German quasi-protectorate.&quot; NDH authorities, led by the Ustaše militia, subsequently implemented genocidal policies against the Serb, Jewish and Romani population living within the borders of the new state. As a result, two resistance movements emerged – the royalist and Serb Chetniks, led by Colonel Draža Mihailović, and the multi-ethnic, Communist Yugoslav Partisans, led by Josip Broz Tito.

Perić was only twenty-one years old when the war began. Having become a member of the KPJ before the war, he immediately joined the Partisans. In the spring of 1941, he and other members of the KPJ participated in planning underground resistance operations. Later that year, he and other members of the party appealed for wealthy citizens of Sarajevo to provide food and money to the city&#x27;s beleaguered Jewish community. As the war progressed, Perić came to be known by the codename &quot;Valter&quot;. In 1942, Perić participated in actions against German forces in Zenica. That year, he was appointed deputy political commissar of a Partisan unit in eastern Bosnia, holding that position until the following year, when he participated in Partisan actions against German troops in the city of Tuzla. That year, regional leaders named him secretary of the Sarajevo committee of the KPJ, giving him the task of reconstituting the party&#x27;s organization in the city. Perić responded by encouraging the Partisans to recruit in urban areas and reconstructed the KPJ to increase its support for the Partisans by providing further personnel, supplies and intelligence.

In June 1944, Perić took on the role of directing the formation, training and deployment of Partisan strike groups (known as &quot;fivesomes&quot;, or &quot;Petorke&quot;) operating in Sarajevo and its outskirts.

===Death===

The liberation of Sarajevo was organized by a powerful network of underground anti-German movements led by Perić. By early 1945 the Partisans engaged in a campaign against German saboteurs, with Perić being personally responsible for anti-sabotage actions in Sarajevo. In early April, he visited the city&#x27;s main post office and electrical generating plant to ensure that they had not been sabotaged by withdrawing German forces. While visiting a tobacco factory at midnight on 5–6 April, Perić was killed after a German soldier hurtled a hand grenade at him. Perić&#x27;s death made him one of the last Sarajevans killed in World War II. At around the same time as his death, most German soldiers in Sarajevo had either left the city or were captured by the Partisans. On 9 April the KPJ formed a new local committee in Sarajevo, appointing new members to take the places left behind by Perić and other operatives killed while fighting the Germans in the previous week. 
On April 9 Perić was buried in mass funeral for all the Partisans and Communist operatives killed in operations for the city liberation previous couple of days. Commemoration lasted for two whole days, continuing on April 10, one in honor of Valter attracted more than 15 thousand people.

==Legacy==
The Partisan film &quot;Walter Defends Sarajevo&quot; (), released in 1972, is a fictionalized portrayal of Perić&#x27;s activities during World War II which ends with a statement in favour of unity when a SS officer realizes at the end of the movie that he was fighting not just a single partisan but an entire city (&quot;You see that city? That&#x27;s Walter!&quot;). In 1992, anti-nationalist and anti-war demonstrators in Sarajevo evoked Perić&#x27;s memory as a sign of inter-ethnic tolerance prior to the outbreak of the Bosnian War; demonstrators bore stickers that read &quot;I am Walter&quot; and one anti-war movement was even named after Perić. In the Bosnian hit television comedy series &quot;Konak kod Hilmije&quot;, Perić was portrayed in a comedic way by Serbian actor Bojan Perić. Several iconic moments, characters and lines from the movie were featured in said television series as well.

<doc id="920181" wikidata="Q15525667" url="?curid=920181" title="Gerald and Sara Murphy">
<text>Gerald Clery Murphy and Sara Sherman Wiborg were wealthy, expatriate Americans who moved to the French Riviera in the early 20th century and who, with their generous hospitality and flair for parties, created a vibrant social circle, particularly in the 1920s, that included a great number of artists and writers of the Lost Generation. Gerald had a brief but significant career as a painter.

==Gerald Murphy==
Gerald Clery Murphy (March 26, 1888 – October 17, 1964) was born in Boston to the family that owned the Mark Cross Company, sellers of fine leather goods. He was of an Irish-American background. His father was Patrick Francis Murphy (1858–1931); he had two siblings: Frederic Timothy Murphy (1884–1924) and Esther Knesborough (1897–1962).

Gerald was an aesthete from his childhood. He was never comfortable in the boardrooms and clubs for which his father was grooming him. He failed the entrance exams at Yale University three times before matriculating, but he performed respectably there. He joined Delta Kappa Epsilon and the Skull and Bones society. He befriended a young freshman named Cole Porter (Yale class of 1913) and brought him into Delta Kappa Epsilon. Murphy also introduced Porter to his friends, propelling him into writing music for Yale musicals.

==Sara Sherman Wiborg==
Sara Sherman Wiborg (November 7, 1883 – October 10, 1975) was born in Cincinnati, Ohio into the wealthy Wiborg family. Her father, Frank Bestow Wiborg, was a manufacturing chemist and owner of his own printing ink and varnish company; he was a self-made millionaire by the age of 40. Her mother, Adeline Sherman Wiborg, was a member of the noted Sherman family, daughter of Hoyt Sherman and niece of Senator John Sherman and Civil War general William Tecumseh Sherman. Raised in Cincinnati, she moved with her family to Germany for several years when she was a teenager so her father could concentrate on the European expansion of his company. The Wiborg family was easily accepted into the high society community of 20th-century Europe. While in Europe, Sara and her sisters Hoytie and Olga sang at high-class assemblies. Upon returning to the United States, the Wiborgs spent most of their time in New York City and later East Hampton, where they built the 30-room mansion The Dunes on 600 acres just west of the Maidstone Club in 1912. It was the largest estate in East Hampton up to that time. Wiborg Beach in East Hampton is named for the family.

==Marriage==
In East Hampton, Sara Wiborg and Gerald Murphy met when they were both adolescents. Gerald was five years younger than Sara, and for many years, they were more companions than romantically attached; they became engaged in 1915 when Sara was 32 years old. Sara&#x27;s parents did not approve of their daughter marrying someone &quot;in trade,&quot; and Gerald&#x27;s parents were not much happier with the prospect, seemingly because his father found it difficult to approve of anything that Gerald did.

After marrying, they lived at 50 West 11th Street in New York City, where they had three children. In 1921, they moved to Paris to escape the strictures of New York and their families&#x27; mutual dissatisfaction with their marriage. In Paris, Gerald took up painting, and they began to make the acquaintances for which they became famous. Eventually they moved to the French Riviera, where they became the center of a large circle of artists and writers of later fame, especially Zelda and F. Scott Fitzgerald, Ernest Hemingway, John Dos Passos, Fernand Léger, Jean Cocteau, Pablo Picasso, Archibald MacLeish, John O&#x27;Hara, Cole Porter, Dorothy Parker and Robert Benchley.

Prior to their arrival on the French Riviera, the region was experiencing a period when the fashionable only wintered there, abandoning the region during the high summer months. However, the activities of the Murphys fueled the same renaissance in arts and letters as did the excitement of Paris, especially among the cafés of Montparnasse. In 1923, the Murphys convinced the Hôtel du Cap to stay open for the summer so that they might entertain their friends, sparking a new era for the French Riviera as a summer haven. The Murphys eventually purchased a villa in Cap d&#x27;Antibes, named it Villa America, and resided there for many years. When the Murphys arrived on the Riviera, lying on the beach merely to enjoy the sun was not a common activity. Occasionally, someone went swimming, but the joys of being at the beach just for the sun were still unknown at the time. The Murphys, with their long forays and picnics at La Garoupe, introduced sunbathing on the beach as a fashionable activity.

They had three children, Baoth, Patrick, and Honoria. In 1929, Patrick was diagnosed with tuberculosis. They took him to Switzerland and then returned to the U.S. in 1934, where Gerald stayed in Manhattan to run Mark Cross, serving as president of the company from 1934 to 1956; he never painted again. Sara settled in Saranac Lake, New York, to nurse Patrick, and Baoth and Honoria were put in boarding schools. In 1935, Baoth died unexpectedly of meningitis as a complication of measles, and Patrick succumbed to tuberculosis in 1937. 

Later, they lived at The Dunes. By 1941, the house proved impossible to rent, sell, 
or even maintain; the Murphys had it demolished, and they moved to the renovated dairy barn.

==Death and legacy==

Gerald died October 17, 1964, in East Hampton, two days after his friend Cole Porter. Sara died on October 10, 1975, in Arlington, Virginia.

Nicole and Dick Diver of &quot;Tender Is the Night&quot; by F. Scott Fitzgerald are widely recognized as having been based on the Murphys, mainly from the marked physical similarities, although many of their friends, as well as the Murphys themselves, saw as much or more of Zelda and Scott Fitzgerald&#x27;s relationship and personalities in the couple than those of the Murphys. Ernest Hemingway&#x27;s couple in &quot;The Garden of Eden&quot; is not explicitly based on this pair, but given the similarities of the setting (Nice) and of the type of social group portrayed, there is clearly some basis for such an assumption. Guests of the Murphys often swam at Eden Roc, an event emulated in Hemingway&#x27;s narrative.

Archibald MacLeish based the main characters in his play &quot;J.B.&quot; on Gerald and Sara Murphy.

Calvin Tomkins&#x27;s biography of Gerald and Sara Murphy &quot;Living Well Is the Best Revenge&quot; was published in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; in 1962, and Amanda Vaill documented their lives in the 1995 book &quot;Everybody Was So Young&quot;. Both accounts are balanced, unlike some of the portrayals in the memoirs and fictitious works by their friends, including Fitzgerald and Hemingway.

In 1982, Honoria Murphy Donnelly, the Murphys&#x27; daughter, wrote (with Richard N. Billings) &quot;Sara &amp; Gerald: Villa America and After&quot;.

On July 12, 2007, a play by Crispin Whittell titled &quot;Villa America&quot;, based entirely on the relationships between Sara and Gerald Murphy and their friends, had its world premiere at the Williamstown Theatre Festival with Jennifer Mudge playing Sara Murphy.

===Paintings by Gerald Murphy===
Gerald only painted from 1921 until 1929; he is known for his hard-edged still life paintings in a Precisionist, Cubist style. During the 1920s Gerald Murphy, along with other American modernist painters in Europe, notably Charles Demuth and Stuart Davis, created paintings that prefigured the pop art movement, containing pop culture imagery such as mundane objects culled from American commercial products and advertising design.
*&quot;Razor&quot;, 1924
*&quot;Watch&quot;, 1925
*&quot;Cocktail&quot;, 1927
*&quot;Wasp and Pear&quot;, 1929
Gerald Murphy’s jazz-rhythmed painting titled &quot;Razor&quot; (1924) and the 6-by-6-foot &quot;Watch&quot; (1925) are part of the Dallas Museum’s permanent collection and are two of eight remaining paintings in Murphy’s 14-work oeuvre.

===Paintings of Sara Murphy by Picasso===
Pablo Picasso, a friend of Sara, painted her in several of his 1923 works: 
* Femme assise les bras croisés
* Portrait de Sarah Murphy
* Buste de Femme (Sara Murphy)
* Femme assise en bleu et rose
* Woman Seated in an Armchair

<doc id="920182" wikidata="Q133126" url="?curid=920182" title="Pueraria">
<text>Pueraria is a genus of 15–20 species of legumes native to south, east, and southeast Asia and to New Guinea and northern Australia. The best known member is kudzu, also called Japanese arrowroot. The genus is named after 19th century Swiss botanist Marc Nicolas Puerari.

Plants in the genus are lianas, shrubs, or climbing herbs, usually with large tuberous roots. Typical habitats include seasonally-dry tropical and subtropical forest, rain forest, forest margins, and scrub vegetation, often on limestone outcrops and in rocky areas.

The genus, as traditionally circumscribed, is polyphyletic, with different species being more related to other species in the tribe Phaseoleae. Current research, reproduced below, splits the genus into five clades, one of which defines the current monophyletic genus.

== Species ==
The genus &quot;Pueraria&quot; is highly polyphyletic; the below list is divided by clade following the result of A.N.Egan &amp; B.Pan (2016). In 2015, the authors validly published their proposal in &quot;Phytotaxa&quot;. , Kew Plants of the World Online database accepts these names.

=== &quot;Pueraria&quot; sensu stricto ===
&quot;Pueraria&quot; sensu stricto includes the vast majority of species in the genus. They fall into a single clade sister to or containing &quot;Nogra&quot;.

* &quot;P. alopecuroides&quot; 
* &quot;P. calycina&quot; 
* &quot;P. candollei&quot; 
* &quot;P. edulis&quot; 
* &quot;P. imbricata&quot; 
* &quot;P. lacei&quot; 
* &quot;P. mirifica&quot; (= &quot;P. candollei&quot; var. &quot;mirifica&quot; in Egan)
* &quot;P. montana&quot; – US invasive population comes from a hybrid of more than one of the subspecies.
**&quot;Pueraria montana&quot; var. &quot;chinensis&quot; (= &quot;P. chinensis&quot;, although ILDS and the plant list instead consider &quot;P. thomsonii&quot; the synonym)
**&quot;Pueraria montana&quot; var. &quot;lobata&quot; (= &quot;P. lobata&quot;)
**&quot;Pueraria montana&quot; var. &quot;thomsonii&quot; (= &quot;P. thomsonii&quot;, missing in ILDS)
* &quot;P. pulcherrima&quot; 
* &quot;P. sikkimensis&quot; 
* &quot;P. tuberosa&quot; – type species

=== Provisionally retained ===
The following are not included in the 2016 study due to insufficient material for sequencing. They are accepted by POWO.
*&quot;P. bella&quot; : conflicting proposals assigning either to the main clade or to &quot;Neonotonia&quot; (morphology).
* &quot;P. bouffordii&quot; : presumably in the main clade (morphology).
* &quot;P. grandiflora&quot; : presumably in the main clade (morphology).
* &quot;P. xyzhuii&quot; : presumably in the main clade (morphology).

The following are not included in Egan et al. 2016 for other reasons, but are accepted by Kew POWO:
* &quot;P. garhwalensis&quot; : excluded per van der Maesen (2002)
* &quot;P. neocaledonica&quot; : not mentioned

=== Former members ===
The rest of the genus fall into four clades, sorted by distance from the main clade:

* &quot;Neustanthus&quot; – sister to &quot;Sinodolichos&quot;
** &quot;P. phaseoloides&quot; → &quot;N. phaseoloides&quot; 

&quot;P. edulis&quot;, &quot;P. montana&quot;, and &quot;N. phaseoloides&quot; make up what is known as kudzu. The morphological differences between these species are subtle.

*** &quot;N. phaseoloides&quot; var. &quot;javanicus&quot; (= &quot;P. javanica&quot; )
*** &quot;N. phaseoloides&quot; var. &quot;phaseoloides&quot;
*** &quot;N. phaseoloides&quot; var. &quot;subspicatus&quot;
* &quot;Teyleria&quot;
** &quot;P. stricta&quot; → &quot;T. stricta&quot;
* &quot;Toxicopueraria&quot; – sister to &quot;Cologania&quot;
** &quot;P. peduncularis&quot; → &quot;T. peduncularis&quot;
** &quot;P. yunnanensis&quot; → &quot;T. yunnanensis&quot;
* &quot;Haymondia&quot; – notably lies out of Glycininae near Kennediinae; known for a long time to be misplaced
** &quot;P. wallichii&quot; → &quot;H. wallichii&quot;

The following names are not accepted even before Egan 2016 but have seen valid publication:
* &quot;P. omeiensis&quot; – &quot;P. montana&quot;: unaccepted name after Mount Omei.
* &quot;P. stracheyi&quot; → &quot;Apios carnea&quot; 
* &quot;P. maclurei&quot; → &quot;Sinodolichos lagopus&quot; – still accepted by WFO

<text>Street Fighter Alpha 3, released as in Japan, Asia, South America, and Oceania, is a 1998 fighting game developed and published by Capcom for arcades. It is the third and final installment in the &quot;Street Fighter Alpha&quot; sub-series, which serves as a sequel to &quot;Street Fighter Alpha 2&quot;, and ran on the same CP System II hardware as previous &quot;Alpha&quot; games. The game was produced after the &quot;Street Fighter III&quot; sub-series has started, being released after &quot;2nd Impact&quot;, but before &quot;3rd Strike&quot;. &quot;Alpha 3&quot; further expanded the playable fighter roster from &quot;Street Fighter Alpha 2&quot; and added new features such as selectable fighting styles called &quot;isms&quot;.

&quot;Alpha 3&quot; has also been released on a variety of home platforms starting with the PlayStation version in 1998, which added an exclusive World Tour mode and brought back even more characters, with further versions on the Dreamcast, Sega Saturn, Game Boy Advance, and PlayStation Portable.

==Gameplay==

&quot;Street Fighter Alpha 3&quot; discards the &quot;Manual&quot; and &quot;Auto&quot; modes from the previous &quot;Alpha&quot; games and instead offers three different playing styles known as &quot;isms&quot; for the player to choose from. The standard playing style, A-ism (or Z-ism in Japan), is based on the previous &quot;Alpha&quot; games, in which the player has a three-level Super Combo gauge with access to several Super Combo moves. X-ism is a simple style based on &quot;Super Street Fighter II Turbo&quot; (the term &quot;X-ism&quot; being a reference to that game&#x27;s Japanese title, &quot;Super Street Fighter II X&quot;), in which the player has a single-level Super Combo gauge and access to a single but powerful Super Combo move. The third style, V-ism (or &quot;variable&quot; style), is a unique style that allows the player to perform custom combos similar to the ones in &quot;Street Fighter Alpha 2&quot;, but cannot use Super Combos. In X-ism, the player cannot air-block nor perform Alpha Counters, and can only use 1 Super Combo move in its powerful Level 3 version. To activate V-ism&#x27;s Custom Combo, the player has to press both kick and punch of the same strength. X-ism has the highest attack power but least defence, A-ism has more attack power than V-ism and a similar level of defence. All three modes have variations of movesets for each character, adding considerable depth to the gameplay. In addition, there are hidden modes that add handicaps to the player as well as benefits (for example, Classic mode, which prevents the use of Super Combos but also makes the character unable to be knocked in the air and juggled).

&quot;Alpha 3&quot; also introduces a &quot;Guard Power Gauge&quot; which depletes each time the player blocks – if the gauge is completely depleted, then the player will remain vulnerable to an attack. When broken the bar shrinks and is refilled to its new maximum, it can be shrunk a number of times. Worth noting, while in X-Ism the character has the least defence of all modes it also has the largest guard bar, vice versa for V-ism with A-Zism being in the middle. Also, the guard bar varies between characters, Zangief e.g. has a very large guard bar. The guard bar does not exist in Dramatic Battle matches so no guard crushing is possible there.

I-ism is a customizable style exclusive to the Dreamcast version&#x27;s World Tour and Saikyo Dojo modes and the PSP version&#x27;s World Tour mode.

The controls for several actions have been modified from the previous &quot;Alpha&quot; games. For example, the level of a Super Combo move in A-ism is now determined by the strength of the attack button pressed (i.e. Medium Punch or Kick for a Lv. 2 Super Combo), rather than the number of buttons pushed; and throwing is now done by pressing two punch or kick buttons simultaneously. 

==Characters==
The game brings back all eighteen of the characters that appeared in &quot;Street Fighter Alpha 2&quot;. As with the previous &quot;Alpha&quot; titles, several characters were added to the game: Cammy, who was previously featured in the console-exclusive &quot;Street Fighter Alpha 2 Gold&quot;, E. Honda, Blanka, Balrog (who is an unlockable character), and Vega. New characters introduced in &quot;Alpha 3&quot; include R. Mika, a Japanese female wrestler who idolizes Zangief; Karin, Sakura&#x27;s rival who was first introduced in the &quot;Street Fighter&quot; manga &quot;Sakura Ganbaru!&quot; by Masahiko Nakahira; Cody from &quot;Final Fight&quot;, who has since become an escaped convict; and Juli and Juni, two of Shadaloo&#x27;s &quot;Dolls&quot; who serve as Bison&#x27;s assassins and guards and who are unlockable characters.

The PlayStation version makes Balrog, Juli and Juni immediately playable and adds the remaining characters introduced in &quot;Super Street Fighter II&quot;: Dee Jay, Fei Long and T. Hawk, along with Guile from &quot;Street Fighter II&quot;, and Evil Ryu and Shin Akuma from &quot;Street Fighter Alpha 2&quot;, the latter three being unlockable. The Dreamcast and Saturn versions move Guile, Evil Ryu and Shin Akuma to the default roster (although the latter shares a slot with his regular counterpart and is playable via a special button combination). The more powerful version of M. Bison who is the true final boss of Alpha 3 with the special Shadaloo-ism meter, Final M. Bison, is also made playable in these Sega versions via a code.

The Game Boy Advance version contains all of the characters from previous versions, as well as three additional characters: Yun from &quot;Street Fighter III&quot;, Maki from &quot;Final Fight 2&quot;, and Eagle from the original &quot;Street Fighter&quot;, all three based on their incarnations from &quot;Capcom vs. SNK 2: Mark of the Millennium 2001&quot;. The PlayStation Portable version, &quot;Street Fighter Alpha 3 MAX&quot;, also adds Ingrid from &quot;Capcom Fighting Evolution&quot;, to bring the total playable character count to 39.

==Home versions==
*&quot;Street Fighter Alpha 3&quot; was initially ported in 1998 to the PlayStation, selling a million copies. This version replaced the &quot;hit&quot; sprites with &quot;hit&quot; polygons in order to focus more memory on character animations. Juli, Juni and Balrog were added to the immediate regular roster, and they were given new character portraits and their own storylines. Dee Jay, Fei Long and T. Hawk (the remaining &quot;New Challengers&quot; from &quot;Super Street Fighter II&quot;) were also included in the roster. Guile, Evil Ryu and Shin Akuma (the latter sharing a slot with his regular counterpart) were also added as secret characters that can be unlocked through the World Tour mode, a mode that allows the player to strengthen and customize their chosen character″s fighting style while traveling around the world. An additional feature in the Japanese version also made use of the PocketStation peripheral, which allows the player to build up their character&#x27;s strength. In this version, Shin Akuma serves as the final boss for Evil Ryu, as well as a secret boss in Final Battle. Due to RAM limitations, the only unique pairings available for a complete campaign in the Dramatic Battle mode are Ryu &amp; Ken and Juli &amp; Juni; other character combinations can only be used for one-match battles. The AI for the Dramatic Battle and Survival modes is exceptionally poor with the CPU neglecting to defend against sweep attacks, perhaps due to RAM again. As is frequently the case with home versions of arcade games, the lesser amount of frames allows for certain combos, often infinite, that are not possible in the arcade version (particularly when using V-Ism mode and in Dramatic Battle and Survival stages).
*This version was re-released for download on the North American PlayStation Network on October 18, 2011.
*The 1999 Dreamcast version, titled Street Fighter Alpha 3: Saikyo Dojo (or Street Fighter Zero 3: Saikyō-ryū Dōjō in Japan), uses all the added features from the PlayStation version of the game, but features a different World Tour mode. Guile, Evil Ryu and Shin Akuma are immediately selectable, although the latter still shares a slot with his regular counterpart and is playable via a special button combination. An online mode was added, allowing the player to display their high score. In addition, a Saikyo Dojo mode was added, which pits a character that the player has built up in World Tour mode against a very strong opponent who had to be downloaded from the Internet and changed every week. The Dreamcast version was re-released in Japan in 2000 as Street Fighter Zero 3: Saikyō-ryū Dōjō for Matching Service as a mail order title via Dreamcast Direct. The &quot;Matching Service&quot; version differs from the original with the addition of an Online Versus mode.
*The Sega Saturn version of &quot;Street Fighter Zero 3&quot; was released in 1999 in Japan only, shortly after the initial Dreamcast version. This version makes use of Sega&#x27;s 4-MB RAM cartridge and uses all the features from the PlayStation version except for the polygon usage and PocketStation mode. The Saturn version uses the extra RAM to include more frames and sprites, making it near arcade-perfect. Similarly to the Dreamcast version, Guile, Evil Ryu and Shin Akuma are immediately selectable, with the latter sharing a slot with his regular counterpart and playable via a special button combination. While the World Tour and Survival modes are virtually unchanged from the PlayStation version, the Dramatic Battle mode received some improvements with the inclusion of a 2-player mode and the addition of the Reverse Dramatic Battle mode, in which the player faces two computer-controlled characters simultaneously. This and the PlayStation Portable versions are also the only ones to feature the Dramatic Battle mode against the entire roster of characters, as all other versions limit this mode to boss characters only. The AI for the Dramatic Battle mode is far superior to the PlayStation version. Another minor change is the revised scoring system for some moves in the game: for example, many characters that earn 3000pts per hit from a grab move (a very important fact to exploit for the World Tour mode, where the score is the player&#x27;s experience points) do not receive as much in the Saturn version. The features, characters etc. of the first home version on the PlayStation are available straight away in the Saturn version.
*&quot;Street Fighter Zero 3&quot; was re-released for the arcade in Japan in 2001 under the title Street Fighter Zero 3 Upper (officially promoted as Street Fighter Zero 3↑). The game was released by Sega for their Dreamcast-based NAOMI hardware and features all six characters from the home console versions as well as some balance changes, most notably the removal of the &quot;crouch canceling&quot; glitch which allowed for V-ISM infinite combos. &quot;Upper&quot; also allows the player to upload any customized characters from the Dreamcast version of the game by inserting a VMU into a memory card slot on the cabinet.
*A Game Boy Advance version developed by Crawfish Interactive was released in 2002 under the title Street Fighter Alpha 3 Upper (Street Fighter Zero 3 Upper in Japan, officially promoted as Street Fighter Alpha 3↑ and Street Fighter Zero 3↑ respectively). The version is compressed and lacks several stages and music tracks from the previous arcade and console versions, although all of the characters are present. In addition, Eagle, Maki, and Yun, all of whom were characters from &quot;Capcom vs. SNK 2&quot; (released in 2001), were added to the game. Only a small number of character voices were included in this version due to storage limitations, which the developers worked around by having characters share voice samples, modified with real-time pitch shifting, such as using a higher pitched version of Ken″s voice for Sakura&#x27;s attack calls.
*The PlayStation Portable version, titled Street Fighter Alpha 3 MAX (Street Fighter Zero 3 Double Upper in Japan, officially promoted as Street Fighter Zero 3↑↑), was released in 2006 and features the additional characters from the GBA version as well as Ingrid from &quot;Capcom Fighting Evolution&quot;. This version is a near-faithful conversion of the arcade version with reduced loading times and all frames and sprites intact. All of the added characters now feature their own in-game storylines and endings. The Dramatic Battle mode in this version is the only one where both the player and partner characters can be selected individually (allowing for any character pairing). It also includes the Reverse Dramatic Battle mode from the Saturn version, an exclusive tag mode called &quot;Variable Battle&quot;, which is similar to the Dramatic Battle mode but in which the player can tag in and out their partner, and a mode called &quot;100 Kumite&quot; (a 100-fight series).
*&quot;Street Fighter Alpha Anthology&quot; (&quot;Street Fighter Zero: Fighters&#x27; Generation&quot; in Japan) was released in 2006 for the PlayStation 2. It contains the arcade version of &quot;Alpha 3&quot; as one of the immediately available games, along with a revised version of &quot;Zero 3 Upper&quot; called &quot;Alpha 3 Upper&quot; as a secret game. Both games feature Dramatic Battle and Survival modes in addition to the Arcade, Versus, and Training modes, but not the World Tour mode that was featured in the previous home versions nor the extra characters introduced in the portable versions of the game. In &quot;Upper&quot;, all six characters that were added in the home console versions are readily available.
*&quot;Street Fighter Alpha 3&quot; has an arcade-perfect inclusion via &quot;Street Fighter 30th Anniversary Collection&quot; for the PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch and Windows via Steam, released in 2018. The original 28 characters appear in the title, but those extra characters who were playable in the console ports as well as both &quot;Upper&quot; and &quot;Double Upper&quot; are not included due to the game being an emulation of the original arcade. Save states are available to allow the player to resume from where they left. The game, along with &quot;Street Fighter II: Hyper Fighting&quot;, &quot;Super Street Fighter II Turbo&quot; and &quot;Street Fighter III: 3rd Strike - Fight for the Future&quot;, has online functionality.
*The arcade version of &quot;Street Fighter Alpha 3 Upper&quot; is set to be re-released in 2025 as part of &quot;Capcom Fighting Collection 2&quot;.

==Reception==
In Japan, &quot;Game Machine&quot; listed &quot;Street Fighter Alpha 3&quot; on their September 1, 1998 issue as being the second most-successful arcade game of the month. Its April 15, 2001 issue reported that &quot;Zero 3 Upper&quot; was the best-selling arcade game of the month.

On release, &quot;Famitsu&quot; magazine scored the Sega Saturn version of the game a 32 out of 40; they later scored it 30 out of 40. The PlayStation version also scored 32 out of 40 on release. The Dreamcast version scored slightly better, receiving a 33 out of 40.

The &quot;Official UK PlayStation Magazine&quot; said that the game would outlast &quot;Tekken 3&quot;, and stated &quot;the only thing to tarnish this is the graphics. So if you think gameplay is more important than texture-mapped polygons, consider the score to be a ten.&quot;

&quot;Next Generation&quot; reviewed the PlayStation version of the game, rating it four stars out of five, and stated that &quot;Capcom may have outdone itself with the most playable and innovative fighting game since the original &quot;Street Fighter II&quot;.&quot;

&quot;Game Informer&quot; gave the PlayStation portable version of the game an overall score of 7.75 out of 10 praising how the game being a great version of the classic fighting game and the gameplay and loading times as being seamless and stating “a perfect arcade conversion that will please Street Fighter fans.”

By 2003, the Game Boy Advance version had sold over 30,000 copies. Meanwhile, the original PlayStation version sold a million units as of June 2016.

In 2019, &quot;Game Informer&quot; ranked it as the 18th best fighting game of all time.

<doc id="920189" wikidata="Q335510" url="?curid=920189" title="Arthur Hamilton-Gordon, 1st Baron Stanmore">
<text>Arthur Charles Hamilton-Gordon, 1st Baron Stanmore (26 November 1829 – 30 January 1912) was a Scottish Liberal Party politician and colonial administrator. He had extensive contact with Prime Minister William Ewart Gladstone.

==Career==
Gordon was born at Argyll House, his family&#x27;s townhouse in London, in 1829. He was the youngest son of George Hamilton-Gordon, 4th Earl of Aberdeen and his second wife, Harriet Douglas. His mother was the widow of Viscount Hamilton.

Gordon was educated privately and then at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he was President of the Cambridge Union Society in 1849.

After graduating in 1851, he worked as Assistant Private Secretary to the British Prime Minister (his father) between 1852 and 1855, and was a Member of Parliament (MP) for Beverley from 1854 to 1857. In 1875, the Fiji Islands were created a separate Colony, and Sir Arthur Gordon was appointed the first Governor and Commander-in-Chief of Fiji, until 1880. In connection with this he also received the appointment of Consul-General, and High Commissioner of the Western Pacific, but that gave little additional power. He held a number of colonial governorships:
* Lieutenant-Governor of New Brunswick, 1861–1866, securing New Brunswick&#x27;s assent to Canadian Confederation
* Governor of Trinidad, 1866–1870.
* 11th Governor of Mauritius, 21 February 1871 – 18 August 1874
* Governor of Fiji from 1875 to 1880.
* High Commissioner for the Western Pacific 1877–1880 
* Governor of New Zealand, 29 November 1880 – 24 June 1882 
* Governor of Ceylon, 1883–1890.

He was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George (KCMG) in 1871, and a Knight Grand Cross of the same Order in 1878. He was created Baron Stanmore, of Great Stanmore, in the County of Middlesex on 21 August 1893.

In 1897, Lord Stanmore became the chairman of the Pacific Islands Company Ltd (&#x27;PIC&#x27;). Formed by John T. Arundel, PIC was based in London with its trading activities in the Pacific that involved mining phosphate rock on Banaba (then known as Ocean Island) and Nauru. John T. Arundel and Lord Stanmore were responsible for financing the new opportunities and negotiating with the German company that controlled the licences to mine in Nauru. In 1902, the interests of PIC were merged with Jaluit Gesellschaft of Hamburg, to form the Pacific Phosphate Company, (&#x27;PPC&#x27;) to engage in phosphate mining in Banaba and Nauru.

Gordon&#x27;s ethnographic collection from Fiji, which was assembled during his Governorship, was donated to the British Museum in 1878.

He was appointed a member of the Royal Commission on Historical Manuscripts in March 1900.

==Personal life and death==
On 20 September 1865, Arthur Hamilton-Gordon, wed Rachel Emily Shaw Lefevre in London. The couple had a daughter and a son.

He was appointed a Deputy Lieutenant of Aberdeenshire in 1861.

Arthur Hamilton-Gordon, 1st Baron Stanmore died on 30 January 1912 in Chelsea, London.

<doc id="920192" wikidata="Q1989780" url="?curid=920192" title="Madonna (Munch)">
<text>Madonna is the usual title given to several versions of a composition by the Norwegian expressionist painter Edvard Munch showing a bare-breasted half-length female figure created between 1892 and 1895 using oil paint on canvas. He also produced versions in print form.

The version owned by the Munch Museum of Oslo was stolen in 2004, but recovered two years later in 2006. Two other versions are owned by the National Gallery of Norway and the Kunsthalle Hamburg. Another one is owned by businessman Nelson Blitz, and one was bought in 1999 by Steven A. Cohen.

The lithographic print of the composition is distinguished by a decorative border depicting wriggling sperm, with a fetus-like figure in its bottom left corner. The 1893 version of the painting had a frame with similar decoration, but it was later removed and lost. The print also exists in a number of different versions.

== Title ==
Although it is a highly unusual representation, this painting might be of the Virgin Mary. Whether the painting is specifically intended as a representation of Mary is disputed. Munch used more than one title, including both Loving Woman and &quot;Madonna&quot;. Munch is not famous for religious artwork and was not known as a Christian. The affinity to Mary might as well be intended nevertheless, as an emphasis on the beauty and perfection of his friend Dagny Juel-Przybyszewska, the model for the work, and an expression of his worship of her as an ideal of womanhood.

== Interpretations ==

Werner Hofmann suggests that the painting is a &quot;strange devotional picture glorifying decadent love. The cult of the strong woman who reduces man to subjection gives the figure of woman monumental proportions, but it also makes a demon of her.&quot; Sigrun Rafter, an art historian at the Oslo National Gallery, suggests that Munch intended to represent the woman in the life-making act of intercourse, with the sanctity and sensuality of the union captured by Munch. The usual golden halo of Mary has been replaced with a red halo symbolizing the love and pain duality. The viewer&#x27;s viewpoint is that of the man who is making love with her. Even in this unusual pose, she embodies some of the key elements of canonical representations of the Virgin: she has a quietness and a calm confidence about her. Her eyes are closed, expressing modesty, but she is simultaneously lit from above; her body is seen, in fact, twisting away from the light so as to catch less of it, even while she faces it with her eyes. These elements suggest aspects of conventional representations of the Annunciation. Robert Melville states that the image portrays &quot;ecstasy and pain in the act of love&quot;. Commenting on the lithograph version, he says that the &quot;decorative border [is] composed of sperms trailing long wriggly filaments which meander round three sides of the image and end in a foetus-like pendant.&quot; Feminist critic Carol Duncan is inclined to interpret the figure as a &quot;femme fatale&quot;,

Other critics have also seen the portrayal of the woman as implicitly paradoxical. According to Peter Day, it is a potentially vampiric figure. 
Day identifies a &quot;dichotomy&quot; between the haunting image of a monstrous mother and of female subjectivity and self-sufficiency.

==Painting materials==
The painting in Munch Museum Oslo was investigated by British and Norwegian scientists. They were able to identify the following pigments: chrome yellow, Prussian blue, yellow ochre, charcoal black, artificial ultramarine and vermilion.

==Development==
The version in the National Museum of Norway has some lines which suggested that there was an overpainted underdrawing. There are sketches showing Munch trying out poses. Conservator Thierry Ford and photographer Børre Høstland at the Museum used infrared reflectography to show layers beneath the painting&#x27;s surface. The underdrawing shows that Munch originally had the subject&#x27;s arms hanging down as in a conventional portrait. The presence of the underdrawings suggests that the National Museum&#x27;s painting is the first one. The painting has undergone research and conservation ahead of its display in the Munch Room of a new NM building, opening in Oslo in June 2022.

==Theft==

On March 29, 1990 a version of &quot;Madonna&quot; and three other artworks were stolen from the Gallery Kunsthuset AS in Oslo. On June 22, 1990 the police located three of the artworks in a private home in Drammen, Norway. The fourth had been located the previous day in a private home in nearby Sande. During the court trials, Ole Christian Bach was suspected of having organized both the theft and the handling. In September 1992, Bach was sentenced to prison for seven months for handling stolen goods.

On Sunday, 22 August 2004, the Munch Museum&#x27;s versions of &quot;Madonna&quot; and &quot;The Scream&quot; were stolen by masked men wielding firearms. The thieves forced the museum guards to lie down on the floor while they snapped the cable securing the paintings to the wall and escaped in a black Audi A6 station wagon, which police later found abandoned.

Both paintings were recovered by the Oslo Police on 31 August 2006. The following day Ingebjørg Ydstie, director of the Munch Museum, said the condition of the paintings was much better than expected and that the damage, including a 2.5 cm hole in the &quot;Madonna&quot;, could be repaired.

In 2008, Indemitsu Petroleum Norge AS committed an endowment of 4 million Norwegian krone towards the conservation, research and presentation of &quot;Madonna&quot; and &quot;The Scream&quot;.

==Notability==
In 2010, a hand-colored version of the print sold for £1.25 million by Bonhams, London, becoming the most expensive print ever sold in Britain.

On 15 February 2013, four Norwegian postage stamps were published by Posten Norge, reproducing images from Munch&#x27;s art to recognise the 150th anniversary of his birth. A close-up of the Madonna&#x27;s head from one of the lithographic versions was used for the design of the 17 Norwegian krone stamp.

<text>William Brewster (c. 1566/67 – 10 April 1644) was an English official and &quot;Mayflower&quot; passenger in 1620. He became senior elder and the leader of Plymouth Colony, by virtue of his education and existing stature with those immigrating from the Netherlands, being a Brownist (or Puritan Separatist).

== Life in England ==
William Brewster was born in 1566 or 1567, most probably in Scrooby, Nottinghamshire, England. He was the son of William Brewster and Mary (Smythe) (Simkinson) Brewster and he had a number of step-brothers and step-sisters, including James, Prudence, Henry, George, and Edward Brewster. His paternal grandparents were William Brewster (1510–1558), and Maud Mann (1513–1558). Their other children were: Fear, (vicar) Henry, Prudence and Thomas Brewster.

Beginning in 1580, he studied briefly at Peterhouse, Cambridge, before entering the service of William Davison, ambassador to the Netherlands, in 1584, giving him opportunity to hear and see more of reformed religion. Brewster was the only Pilgrim with political and diplomatic experience. With his mentor in prison, Brewster had returned home to Scrooby for a time, where he took up his father&#x27;s former position as postmaster in 1590. The historian Stephen Tomkins argues that William and Mary became puritans in the mid-to-late 1590s, judging by the names of their children, which became much more puritan after Jonathan. It appears their daughter Fear, born about 1606, was named after her great-aunt Fear Brewster, who died unmarried about two years after William&#x27;s daughter Fear was born.
Following the campaign led by Archbishop Bancroft to force puritan ministers out of the Church of England, the Brewsters joined the Brownist church led by John Robinson and Richard Clifton, inviting them to meet in their manor house in Scrooby. Restrictions and pressures applied by the authorities convinced the congregation of a need to emigrate to the more sympathetic atmosphere of Holland, and Brewster organized the removal. Leaving England without permission was illegal at the time, so that departure was a complex matter. On its first attempt, in 1607, the group was arrested at Scotia Creek, but in 1608, Brewster and others were successful in leaving from the Humber.

== Life in the Netherlands ==

Robinson&#x27;s church lived for a year in Amsterdam, but in 1609 one of their fellow Brownist churches there led by John Smyth became the first Baptist church. In the controversy that followed, Robinson and Brewster decided to take their church to Leiden.

Brewster lived near St Peter&#x27;s church (Dutch: Pieterskerk) in Leiden with his wife and children. He was chosen as assistant and later as an elder to Pastor John Robinson. He was still an elder when he travelled to Plymouth Colony in 1620.

In Leiden, the group managed to make a living. Brewster had struggled for money in Amsterdam, but in Leiden he taught English to university students. In 1610–11, Robinson and Brewster acted as mediators when the Ancient Church, the oldest Brownist congregation in Amsterdam, split into two factions following Francis Johnson and Henry Ainsworth, but they failed to reconcile them.

Brewster printed and published religious books for sale in England, but they were proscribed there. The press was prolific, printing &quot;seven books against the regime of the Church of England in 1618 alone.&quot; In 1618, Brewster&#x27;s press published &quot;De regimine Ecclesianae Scoticanae&quot; by Scottish minister David Calderwood, which was highly critical of James VI and his government of the Kirk. They followed it up in April 1619 with &quot;Perth Assembly&quot;. King James ordered an international manhunt for the writer and printer, but Brewster went underground. According to historian Stephen Tomkins, Brewster handed himself over to the Dutch authorities, who refused to send him to his death in England and so told James that they had arrested the wrong person and let him go. Tomkins judges that Brewster&#x27;s printing operation &quot;came close to ruining his church&#x27;s plans for America&quot;.

Brewster and Robinson were the prime movers in the decision to sail for America, but once he was in hiding the Separatists looked to their deacon John Carver and to Robert Cushman to carry on negotiations with the appropriate officials in London.
Brewster returned to the Leiden congregation in 1620, when it was time for the &quot;Speedwell&quot; to sail to England. He had been hiding out in Netherlands and perhaps even England for the last year. At the time of his return, Brewster was the highest-ranking layman of the congregation and was their designated elder in Plymouth Colony.

Brewster joined the first group of Separatists aboard the &quot;Mayflower&quot; on the voyage to America. He was accompanied by his wife Mary and his sons Love and Wrestling.

== &quot;Mayflower&quot; voyage ==
Among the people boarding the &quot;Mayflower&quot; were four unaccompanied children from Shipton, Shropshire. They were placed as indentured servants with senior Separatists William Brewster, John Carver and Robert Cushman, on behalf of Samuel More, husband of the children&#x27;s mother, Katherine More. The children were placed without their mother&#x27;s permission after four rancorous years between the Mores over charges of adultery against Katherine and her longtime lover, the children&#x27;s alleged father. Two children were placed with William and Mary Brewster.

The &quot;Mayflower&quot; departed Plymouth in England in September 1620. The 100-foot vessel carried 102 passengers and a crew of 30 to 40 in extremely cramped conditions. During the voyage, the ship was buffeted by strong westerly gales. The caulking of its planks was failing to keep out sea water, and the passengers&#x27; berths were not always dry. On the journey there were two deaths, a crew member and a passenger. After being blown off course by gales, the &quot;Mayflower&quot; made a landing at Cape Cod. Finding the area near Provincetown occupied by indigenous people, the ship&#x27;s company decided to continue exploring along the nearby coast. The group arrived in the area near present-day Plymouth, Massachusetts, on 21 December 1620. In the space of several months almost half the passengers perished in the cold, harsh New England winter.

== In Plymouth Colony ==

When the passengers of the &quot;Mayflower&quot; landed at Plymouth Colony, Brewster became the senior elder, and so served as the religious leader of the colony; in the colony, he became a separatist leader and preacher, and eventually, as an adviser to Governor William Bradford. Brewster&#x27;s son Jonathan joined the family in November 1621, arriving at Plymouth on the ship &quot;Fortune&quot;, and daughters Patience and Fear arrived in July 1623 aboard the &quot;Anne&quot;.
As the only university-educated member of the colony, Brewster took the part of the colony&#x27;s religious leader until pastor Ralph Smith arrived in 1629. Thereafter, he continued to preach irregularly until his death in April 1644. &quot;He was tenderhearted and compassionate of such as were in misery,&quot; Bradford wrote, &quot;but especially of such as had been of good estate and rank and fallen unto want and poverty.&quot;

Brewster was granted land among the islands of Boston Harbor, and four of the outer islands (Great Brewster, Little Brewster, Middle Brewster, and Outer Brewster) now bear his name. In 1632, he received lands in nearby Duxbury and removed from Plymouth to create a farm there.

In 1634, smallpox and influenza ravaged both the English and the Indians in the region. Brewster&#x27;s family had managed to survive the first terrible winter unscathed, but they lost daughters Fear and Patience, now married to Isaac Allerton and Thomas Prence, respectively.

== Family and other charges ==
=== Marriage ===
About 1590 or 1592, William Brewster married a woman named Mary, whose surname is unknown, although researchers have proposed Wentworth and Wyrall, along with a handful of children—all of which have been disproved with documentation, as summarized in the 2014 &#x27;silver&#x27; volume on William Brewster published by the General Society of Mayflower Descendants. No formal record of the marriage of William Brewster appears in the preserved marriage records of Nottinghamshire Archives. Clandestine marriages and marriages without banns or license before an officiant were not unknown in Nottinghamshire around 1590–96. Thus it is possible one of the following officiated at the marriage about 1590–92 of William Brewster: 1) his uncle Henry Brewster, vicar of Sutton-cum-Lound 1565–94; 2) John Naylor, who was vicar of North Clifton 1588–1626+ and was involved in a clandestine marriage 1 December 1591; and 3) Thomas Hancock, curate of Headon until 1592 when curate of West Retford, and who was presented in 1592 for marrying R. Southworth in Scrooby Chapel without banns or license while curate of Headon. The extensive search for further information on Mary continues, and the number of researchers includes Jeremy Bangs, Director of the American Pilgrim Museum in Leiden, Holland; Caleb Johnson; and Louise Throop.

=== Children ===
Their first surviving child Jonathan was born on 12 August 1593, according to &quot;The Brewster Book&quot; in the handwriting of Jonathan. The first three known children were born in Scrooby, Nottinghamshire. A more comprehensive list of children is as follows, although there were possibly children born 1591, 1595, 1597, and 1602, who would have possibly died in the plague of the autumn of 1603 and the winter of 1603–4. Others born 1604 and 1608 may also have died young:
# Jonathan Brewster (12 August 1593 – 7 August 1659) married Lucretia Oldham of Derby on 10 April 1624 and were the parents of 8 children. 
# Patience Brewster (c. 1600 – 12 December 1634) married Gov. Thomas Prence of Lechlade, Gloucestershire, 4 children. 
# Fear Brewster (c. 1606 – before 1634), apparently named after her great-aunt Fear Brewster. Married Isaac Allerton of London, 2 children. 
# Unnamed child was born, died, and buried in 1609 in Leiden, Holland. 
# Love Brewster was born in Leiden, Holland about 1611 and died between 6 October 1650 and 31 January 1650–1 at Duxbury, in Plymouth Colony. At the age of about 9, he travelled on the &quot;Mayflower&quot; to Plymouth Colony with his father, mother, and brother Wrestling. There he married Sarah Collier on 15 May 1634. Love and Sarah were the parents of four children. 
# Wrestling Brewster was born in 1614 in Leiden, Holland, was living in 1627, and died unmarried before the 1644 settlement of his father&#x27;s estate.

=== Other charges ===

Three of the &quot;Mayflower&quot; pilgrims, including William Brewster, took responsibility for children of Samuel More, who accompanied him and others as indentured servants:
* Mary More, age 4, assigned as a servant of William Brewster. She died sometime in the winter of 1620–1. Her burial place is unknown, but may have been on Cole&#x27;s Hill in Plymouth in an unmarked grave, as with so many others buried there that winter. As with her sister Ellen, she is recognized on the Pilgrim Memorial Tomb in Plymouth, misidentified after her sister&#x27;s name as &quot;and a brother (children),&quot; the mistake of calling her &quot;a brother&quot; arising from William Bradford&#x27;s failing memory years after the event of her death.
* Richard More, age 6, servant of William Brewster. He resided with the Brewster family until about mid-1627 when his term of indentureship expired. His name appears, at age 14, in a census as a member of the Brewster family, in what was called then &quot;New Plimouth&quot;. By 1628, Richard was in the employ of Pilgrim Isaac Allerton, who was engaged in trans-Atlantic trading.

In addition to these, Jasper More, age 7, was assigned to John Carver as a servant, but died of a &quot;common infection&quot; in December 1620 while the &quot;Mayflower&quot; was in Cape Cod Harbor (several weeks after Elinor). He was buried ashore in the area of what is now Provincetown, where a memorial plaque bears his and the names of four others &quot;who died at sea while the ship lay at Cape Cod Harbor&quot; in November/December 1620. Finally, Elinor More, age 8, was assigned to Edward Winslow as a servant, but died in November 1620 soon after the arrival of the &quot;Mayflower&quot; at Cape Cod Harbor. Her burial place is unknown, but may have been ashore on Cape Cod similar to her brother Jasper. With many others who died that winter, her name appears on the Pilgrim Memorial Tomb, Cole&#x27;s Hill, Plymouth, Massachusetts.

== Death ==
William Brewster died on 10 April 1644, at Duxbury, Plymouth Colony. He was predeceased by his wife, Mary Brewster, who died in April 1627, aged about sixty. A cenotaph stone was erected for him and his wife Mary, commemorating his honor; &quot;Elder William Brewster, Patriarch of the Pilgrims and their Ruling Elder 1609–1644&quot;. William Brewster was characterized in a 1992 biography as the &quot;father of New England&quot; and a &quot;&quot;sine qua non&quot; of the entire Pilgrim adventure, its backbone, its brain and its conscience.&quot; Brewster is also the subject of a one-act play, &quot;The Separatist&quot;, published in 1934, written by &quot;Hamilton&quot; playwright Mary P. Hamlin.

<text>The German School of Budapest - Thomas Mann Gymnasium (commonly referred to as DSB) (&quot;German: Deutsche Schule Budapest - Thomas Mann Gymnasium&quot;) is a private international school in Budapest, Hungary. It was founded in 1908 to serve German families in Hungary. It now has a diverse student body with primarily children of the expatriate business and diplomatic communities. Considered to be one of the best schools of its kind, it was awarded a Certificate of Excellence by the Central Agency for German Schools Abroad in 2012 and again in 2020.

== History ==

The former Deutsche Schule Budapest was re-established as the continuation of, first, the 1908 Reichsdeutsche Schule Budapest, and later, the German Government School in Budapest. Its founders were the state of Baden-Württemberg, the Federal Government of Germany, the City of Budapest and the Hungarian Government, in succession to a tradition of German schools in Hungary dating back to the late 19th century. Since then, it has evolved into a prestigious institution for about 500 students, with a Primary School from Grade 1 to 4 (Grundschule) and a Secondary School for Grades 5 to 12 (Gymnasium).

== Academics ==

The German School of Budapest&#x27;s philosophy is to serve as a platform fostering intercultural dialogue. It is committed to act as a bridge between the German and Hungarian society, culture and language.

It has a rigorous bicultural academic curriculum evidenced by a graduation rate of virtually 100% and one of the highest university admission rates (95%) in the country. The primary language of instruction is German with some classes taught in Hungarian, depending on the student&#x27;s academic program. Given the limited German knowledge of the majority of the Hungarian pupils, teaching is more and more moving into bilingual set-up. Given the multicultural student body, the emphasis is on nurturing independent thinking, tolerance and openness.

The primary school encompasses Grades 1 to 4 and follows the national curriculum of Germany. Hungarian is offered as a regular language class for beginners, advanced and bilingual students. English is playfully introduced as a foreign language.

The secondary school is split into a German and Hungarian section. The German section follows the German national curriculum for Gymnasiums with English (Grade 5), French (Grade 6) and Spanish (Grade 9) as the foreign languages and leads to the German Abitur. Students in the Hungarian section also follow the German national curriculum but have additional classes in Hungarian literature, Hungarian history and are taught biology and chemistry in Hungarian according to the Hungarian national curriculum. In Grade 5 the focus is on acquiring proficiency in German. Students may sit the German Abitur, as well as the Hungarian Érettségi. The two sections are physically divided into separate classes up to Grade 9. After that, students of both sections are mixed so that Germans and Hungarians spend the majority of their time studying side by side.

The school is especially known for its high level in mathematics, science and languages. Students frequently outperform their counterparts in standardized tests, successfully participate in international and national academic competitions, and have the possibility to earn language certificates due to cooperation with the Institut Français and the Instituto Cervantes.

== Faculty ==
Teachers at the school are generally recommended and appointed by the German Ministry for Education (Kultusministerkonferenz) and have to be confirmed by the school. The positions are highly competitive and are based on three-year contracts with the possibility of extension. In some cases, especially for subjects taught in Hungarian, the school hires teachers directly from Hungary. Several years of experience at a highly reputable Hungarian secondary school is a minimum requirement.

== Tuition ==
Tuition for the 2016-2017 school year is 1,162,500 HUF excluding additional fees for registration, materials, extracurriculars, lunch, class trips, excursions, and transportation. This makes the DSB one of the most expensive private schools in the country.

== Student body ==
The school prides itself on its diversity, serving students from a wide range of cultural, ethnic and racial backgrounds. Albeit smaller than most other international schools in Budapest, it is proportionally more diverse and more focused on a cosmopolitan education with especially Grades 9-12 serving as examples of cross-cultural communication and understanding.

The German School is considered to be the go-to institution for an increasing number of diplomat, expat and bilingual families, as well as the Hungarian elite. Due to the high tuition fees and rigorous admission process, it primarily caters to an exclusive group of families.

== Facilities ==
The school has a large 35-hectare campus in the Buda hills overlooking the city and is conveniently accessible by public transport. A historic hunting lodge houses the primary school and the cafeteria. The secondary school and the administrative offices are located in a contemporary, purpose-built building. Apart from several specialty classrooms for the art and science classes, there is a computer room, a library with over 7,000 books, a gym and a professionally equipped theater. The outdoor facilities include a playground, a basketball and a soccer court, and a running track. All classrooms are equipped with Smart Boards.

For class trips, project excursions and training camps the school owns a holiday house in Gárdony, at the shore of Lake Velence. It can accommodate up to 36 people in en-suite rooms, has a fully equipped kitchen, a multipurpose room, and plenty of canoes and other sports equipment.

Due to increasing number of students, a major expansion project designed by BH Architects has started in August 2016. Apart from a new building amendment which will house new classrooms, an additional gym, a larger cafeteria. The new two-decked parking lot has already been completed.

== Extracurriculars ==

Each year the school offers a wide variety of extracurricular activities: from intramurals and club sports to arts, music and science. The drama and musical clubs put on plays suitable for different ages. In the past, famous Broadway productions such as Hair and Cats, as well as student-written pieces have been showcased. The Lego Robotics club has participated in national and international competitions. The DSB is one of currently nine Hungarian schools running the Model European Parliament project. Students have successfully advanced to the national and international rounds. The Class of &#x27;05 won the first prize at the German Competition of Political Education in 2003, and the school had regularly sends the finalists to the prestigious OKTV competition. The school has close links to the prestigious Europa-Kolleg, a two-weeks research scholarship program for annually twenty high school student, organised by the state foundation of Lower Saxony, the Stiftung Niedersachsen.

== Athletics ==

Following the concept of a holistic education, the school emphasises the importance of athletics. Students participate in varsity sports competing in tournaments with local Hungarian schools. The basketball team has also had notable successes, not the least thanks to the annual student-teacher match on the last school day before Christmas break.
The girls&#x27; volleyball team is one of the excelling school teams in the area, represented in almost every major high school level tournament. Club sports, such as hockey, four square (known as Tengo at the school) and dance are particularly popular with the lower grades.

== Traditions ==

=== Gombocz-Runde ===

Named after one-time school coach and PE teacher Gábor Gombocz, the Gombocz-Runde is a 1,5 km cross country run on an area near the school with extreme inclines and uphill parts. As such, it is strenuous exercise even for generally fit students. Tradition has it that every student has to run it at least once a term to pass in PE, although this has recently been abandoned. The run itself nevertheless remains part of the PE curriculum. It is partly due to the tradition of the Gombocz-Runde that DSBlers are regularly seen at various city marathons and charity runs. Gombocz doesn&#x27;t run with the students, he sits on a chair at the gate.

=== Adventsbasar ===

The Adventsbasar is co-organised by the Parents&#x27; Association that takes place in early December. It is a Christmas-themed event where most classes get a stall and sell pancakes, mulled wine, and various s. The profit usually goes to the class accounts of the pupils.

=== Szalagavató ===

Once seniors have passed their first semester of finals and are admitted to the leaving examinations, they are allowed to wear a distinctive bright-blue ribbon on their coats. The Szalagavató is the ceremony when the ribbons are officially handed over to the students. The Szalagavató takes place in late November or early December marking the final stage of a student&#x27;s school career. It is a white tie event taking place in the school, commonly presided over by the German Ambassador to Budapest or another high-ranking state officer and attended by the students´ families, friends, diplomats and corporate leadership.

=== Ballagás (graduation ceremony) ===

Ballagás is the actual Graduation ceremony, on the last day of ordinary school schedules for the seniors. It takes place on the last Friday before the start of the preparatory and examination period, at the end of which the oral parts of the leaving examinations are taken. Seniors walk through classrooms decorated with flowers for this purpose, singing traditional commercium songs, such as &quot;Gaudeamus Igitur&quot;.

== Notable alumni ==

* Franz Reichelt, an inventor most notable for jumping to his death off of the Eiffel Tower with a self-made parachute
* Eva Szekely, gold medalist at the 1952 Summer Olympics in Helsinki
* Sara Cholnoky, olympic windsurfer competing in Class at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro

<doc id="920198" wikidata="Q2119625" url="?curid=920198" title="William Brewster (ornithologist)">
<text>William Brewster (July 5, 1851 – July 11, 1919) was an American ornithologist. He co-founded the American Ornithologists&#x27; Union (AOU) and was an early naturalist and conservationist.

==Early life and education==

===Childhood===
William Brewster was born on July 5, 1851, in South Reading (now Wakefield), Massachusetts, the youngest of four children born to John Brewster, a successful Boston banker, and Rebecca Parker (Noyes). The couple settled in Cambridge, Massachusetts in 1845. Brewster&#x27;s sister and older brothers died in early childhood, inspiring Longfellow, a close neighbor, to write the poem &quot;The Open Window&quot;.

Brewster attended Cambridge public schools, Washington Grammar School and Cambridge High School, taking a preparatory course to enter Harvard. He suffered eyesight problems as a youth and into adulthood. He was often unable to read or study, sometimes for extended periods. During his last year of high school, he was unable to read so his mother read his lessons to him. His parents and doctors deemed him too frail and nearsighted to attend Harvard.

===Early bird study===
At about the age of 10, Brewster became close friends with a boy his age, Daniel French. French&#x27;s father was a hunter and amateur taxidermist who displayed his skill in cases in his home. Brewster&#x27;s father gave him a gun and taught him to shoot, providing a means of collecting birds to study. In the nineteenth century, shooting was the usual way of collecting specimens. Binoculars were not generally available until the early twentieth century. In his book, &quot;Birds of the Cambridge Region,&quot; Brewster himself wrote, &quot;On January 1, 1862, my friend Mr. Daniel C. French called at our house to give me my first lesson in taxidermy, an art known in those days to but very few persons save the professional bird stuffers.&quot; By 1865, Brewster had several cases of mounted birds and a collection of nests and eggs. A few years later, he learned to make skins and gave up mounting stuffed birds.

Brewster kept detailed records of his observations and continued to do so for the rest of his life. To encourage his interests, his father presented him with the five volumes of Audubon&#x27;s &quot;Ornithological Biography.&quot;

==Career and accomplishments==

In 1880, he became assistant in charge of the collection of birds and mammals in the Boston Society of Natural History, and in 1885 became curator of mammals and birds at the Museum of Comparative Zoology at Harvard University, working closely with director Alexander Agassiz and Elizabeth Hodges Clark, where he served until his death, though after 1900 he cared for birds alone, and he left his position at the Boston Society of Natural History in 1887. He also devoted substantial time to his own private museum of ornithology.

He spent much time on expeditions and from 1873 to 1898 he did so while suffering from bouts of lameness and debilitating pain in his legs. In 1898, lameness confined him to his hotel room in the Netherlands for two weeks. He was successfully treated by John Gehring, MD in Bethel Maine, who analyzed his problem as psychogenic and treated him with hypnotic suggestion. This allowed Brewster to hike 2–6 miles per day in his ornithological work. As he wrote to Gehring, &quot;“My legs, for the first time in twenty years, feel exactly alike. I did run and jump and try in every way to see if I could not reveal some lingering weakness but without doing so” 

Brewster was a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, and in 1876 became president of the Nuttall Ornithological Club of Cambridge, of which he was the founder in 1873.
He was a co-founder, with Elliott Coues and Joel Asaph Allen, of the American Ornithologists&#x27; Union (AOU) in 1883 and served as its president from 1895 to 1898.

Brewster served as the first president of Mass Audubon (Massachusetts Audubon Society) from 1896–1913, founded by Harriet Lawrence Hemenway (1858–1960) and Minna B. Hall, with a mandate to advance legislation to restrict the killing of birds and sale of their plumage. The group, with over half its officers being women, used its political power to have a Massachusetts law passed in 1897 outlawing trade in wild bird feathers and the 1900 Lacey Act, which prohibits interstate shipment of animals killed in violation of local laws.

==Published works==
Brewster published over 300 articles in the &quot;Bulletin of the Nuttall Ornithological Club&quot;, in the &quot;Annals of the New York Lyceum of Natural History&quot;, &quot;Proceedings of the Boston Society of Natural History&quot;, &quot;The Auk&quot;, and other periodicals.
He wrote:
* &quot;Bird Migration&quot; (1886)
* &quot;Birds of the Cape Regions of Lower California&quot; (1902)
* &quot;Birds of the Cambridge Region of Massachusetts&quot; (1906)

==Unpublished works==
The Ernst Mayr Library of the Museum of Comparative Zoology at Harvard University maintains an archive of Brewster&#x27;s journals, diaries, field notebooks, correspondence, and photographs. Much of this material has been digitized and is available through the Biodiversity Heritage Library.

==William Brewster Memorial Award==
In honor of Brewster, the AOU awards the &quot;William Brewster Memorial Award&quot; &quot;to the author or co-authors (not previously so honored) of an exceptional body of work on birds of the Western Hemisphere.&quot; The award, consisting of a medal and honorarium, was given every other year from 1921 through 1937 and then annually.

<doc id="920207" wikidata="Q6252164" url="?curid=920207" title="John Paul (actor)">
<text>John Middleton Lankester Paul (20 April 1921 – 23 February 1995) was an English actor. He is best known for his television roles, particularly as Dr Spencer Quist in &quot;Doomwatch&quot; (1970–1972) and Marcus Agrippa in &quot;I, Claudius&quot; (1976), both for BBC Television.

==Career==
An early role for Paul was as the lead in the ITV series &quot;Probation Officer&quot; in the early 1960s. He appeared as &quot;Captain Flint&quot; in a BBC adaptation of Arthur Ransome&#x27;s &quot;Swallows and Amazons&quot; in 1963. He had guest roles in episodes of popular television series such as &quot;Out of the Unknown&quot;, &quot;Doctor Finlay&#x27;s Casebook&quot;, &quot;The Avengers&quot;, &quot;Dixon of Dock Green&quot;, &quot;The Saint&quot;, &quot;Marked Personal&quot; and &quot;The New Avengers&quot;, mostly during the 1960s and 1970s. One of his final TV appearances was in &quot;Selling Hitler&quot;, based on the real-life attempts to sell fake diaries attributed to Adolf Hitler.

During his career Paul also appeared in feature films such as &quot;Yangtse Incident&quot; (1957), &quot;The Curse of the Mummy&#x27;s Tomb&quot; (1964), &quot;Cromwell&quot; (1970), &quot;Eye of the Needle&quot; (1981), and &quot;Cry Freedom&quot; (1987).

<text>Pharmaceutics is the discipline of pharmacy that deals with the process of turning a new chemical entity (NCE) or an existing drug into a medication to be used safely and effectively by patients. The patients could be either humans or animals. Pharmaceutics helps relate the formulation of drugs to their delivery and disposition in the body. Pharmaceutics deals with the formulation of a pure drug substance into a dosage form.

== Description ==
Pharmaceutics is also called the science of dosage form design. There are many chemicals with pharmacological properties, but need special measures to help them achieve therapeutically relevant amounts at their sites of action.

== Branches ==
Branches of pharmaceutics include:
*Pharmaceutical formulation
*Pharmaceutical manufacturing
*Dispensing pharmacy
*Pharmaceutical technology
*Physical pharmacy
*Pharmaceutical jurisprudence

== History ==
Pharmaceutics deals with the formulation of a pure drug substance into a dosage form. Pure drug substances are usually white crystalline or amorphous powders. Before the advent of medicine as a science, it was common for pharmacists to dispense drugs &quot;as is&quot;. Most drugs today are administered as parts of a dosage form. The clinical performance of drugs depends on their form of presentation to the patient.

<doc id="920221" wikidata="Q3375282" url="?curid=920221" title="Peregrine White">
<text>Peregrine White ( ) was the first boy born on the Pilgrim ship the &quot;Mayflower&quot; in the harbour of Massachusetts, the second baby born on the &quot;Mayflower&quot;″s historic voyage, and the first known English child born to the Pilgrims in America. His parents, William White and his pregnant wife Susanna, with their son Resolved White and two servants, came on the &quot;Mayflower&quot; in 1620. Peregrine White was born while the &quot;Mayflower&quot; lay at anchor in the harbor at Cape Cod. In later life, he became a person of note in Plymouth Colony, active in both military and government affairs.

== English origins ==
Peregrine White was the second son of &quot;Mayflower&quot; pilgrim William White and his wife Susanna White Winslow. His mother Susanna was pregnant during the &quot;Mayflower&quot; voyage and gave birth to Peregrine in late November 1620 while the ship was anchored at Cape Cod, now Provincetown Harbor.

The Whites are believed to have boarded the &quot;Mayflower&quot; as part of the London merchant group, and not as members of the Leiden Holland religious movement. Evidence of the William White family coming to the &quot;Mayflower&quot; from England and not Holland comes from William Bradford&#x27;s &quot;Mayflower&quot; passenger list which has &quot;Mr. William White&quot; in his section for London merchants along with Christopher Martin, William Mullins, Stephen Hopkins, Richard Warren and John Billington. It is believed that if William White had been a member of the Leiden congregation, his name would have appeared in Bradford&#x27;s work for that section, but it does not. There is no evidence to associate William White and his family with Leiden, Holland.
And regarding the various White family ancestries which erroneously place the William White family in them, the Mayflower Society states that &quot;Little is known about William White.&quot;

== &quot;Mayflower&quot; voyage ==
The White family, as recalled by William Bradford in 1651 consisted of, &quot;Mr. William White, and Susana, his wife, and one son, called Resolved, and one borne a ship-bord, called Peregrine; and *2* servants, named William Holbeck and Edward Thomson.&quot;

The &quot;Mayflower&quot; departed from Plymouth, England, on the 6/16 of September in 1620. The small, 100-foot ship had 102 passengers and a crew of about 30-40 in extremely cramped conditions. By the second month out the ship was being buffeted by strong westerly gales, causing the ship&#x27;s timbers to be badly shaken with caulking failing to keep out sea water and with passengers, even in their berths, lying wet and ill. This, combined with a lack of proper rations and unsanitary conditions for several months, contributed to circumstances that would be fatal for many, especially the majority of women and children. On the way there were two deaths, a crew member and a passenger, but the worst was yet to come after arriving at their destination when, in the space of several months, almost half the passengers perished in the cold, harsh, unfamiliar New England winter.

At some point along the journey, the first baby was born on the &quot;Mayflower&quot;, Oceanus Hopkins, to the passengers Stephen and Elizabeth Hopkins.

On 9/19 November 1620, after about 3 months at sea including a month of delays in England, they spotted land which was the Cape Cod Hook, now called Provincetown Harbor. After several days of trying to sail south to their planned destination of the Colony of Virginia, strong winter seas forced them to return to the harbor at Cape Cod hook, where they anchored on 11/21 November 1620. The Mayflower Compact was signed that day.

== In Plymouth Colony ==
Peregrine White&#x27;s father William White died on 21 February 1621. With her husband&#x27;s death, Susanna, with her newborn son Peregrine and five-year-old Resolved, became the only surviving widow out of the many families who perished that first winter. On 12 May 1621 Peregrine&#x27;s mother Susanna married widower Edward Winslow, a &quot;Mayflower&quot; and later a Plymouth colony notable with whom she had five children, one of whom was Josiah Winslow, future Plymouth governor.

In the 1627 Division of Cattle, both Resolved and his brother Peregrine were listed in the Third Lot under Capt. Standish in the family of Edward Winslow, his wife Susanna and their sons Edward and John Winslow.

In 1636, the family, now numbering 6 - Edward and Susanna, Resolved and Peregrine White, and the two children born to Edward and Susanna, Josias and Elizabeth Winslow - moved to the new settlement of Marshfield, north of Plymouth.

Peregrine served in the militia at age 16 and continued to serve, first as a lieutenant and then a captain. He was also a farmer. At some point he also served his community as a representative to the General Court.

On 23 October 1643, at Marshfield, Peregrine White sold to Mannasses Kempton of Plymouth, land at Eel River that had been given to him the year before by his stepfather Edward Winslow.

At the court on 6 March 1648/9, Peregrine White and Sarah his wife, both of Marshfield, were presented (fined) for fornication before marriage. Since records show their first child, Daniel, was born in 1649, they seemed to have married after Sarah had become pregnant.

Peregrine&#x27;s in-laws, the Bassets, had a great deal of land in Marshfield and Peregrine and Sarah moved there, eventually buying several adjacent pieces of property as the years progressed.

On 3 June 1651, Lt. Peregrine White was admitted as a Freeman.

On 3 June 1652, William Bassett Sr. of Duxburrow gave his son-in-law Lt. Peregrine White 40 acres of upland.

In 1655, he was granted land as the &quot;first of the English that was borne in these partes.&quot;

On 16 June 1656, as written, William Bassett Sr. of Duxborrow , now living at Bridgewater, gave his lands in Scituate to his sons Peregrine White and Nathaniel Bassett.

On 2 October 1658, he was chosen as a member of the council of war.

On 3 June 1662, Peregrine was chosen to be deputy for Marshfield.

On 4 March 1673/4, Lt. Peregrine White was granted 100 acres at Titicut.

On 19 August 1674, Peregrine White of Marshfield deeded to his son, Daniel White, in consideration of his intended marriage, various buildings and lands in Marshfield from the time of his death, except if he died before his wife Sarah and Daniel was to pay monies to sister Sarah and Mercy when they became or married.

On 22 May 1696, Capt. Peregrine White &quot;the first born Child of New England born November 1620&quot; was admitted into the Marshfield Church in his 78th year. At age 78, Peregrine officially joined the Marshfield church.

== Family ==
Peregrine White married before 6 March 1648/9 Sarah Bassett, daughter of William and Elizabeth/Elisabeth Bassett. William Bassett came to Plymouth in 1621 on the &quot;Fortune&quot; as a single man, but by the 1623 division was allotted two acres showing he had married before that date. Bassett&#x27;s name as &quot;Wm Bassett, Sen&quot; appears on the 1643 Able to Bear Arms list for Duxborrow . William Bassett became a Plymouth Colony person of historic note.

Sarah Bassett was born in Plymouth c.1630 and died in Marshfield on 22 January 1711. They had seven children between c.1649 and c.1670:

* Daniel White, born c.1649 and died in Marshfield on 6 May 1724, noted in records as being either 70 or 75. In Marshfield, on 19 August 1674, he married Hannah Hunt, who was last known to be living on 15 May 1721. They had seven children.
* (child) White, born c.1650/1.
* Jonathan White, born in Marshfield on 4 June 1658. He died in Yarmouth between 14 July 1736 and 22 February 1737. Whites Brook in Yarmouth, Massachusetts, is named after him since he lived nearby.
:Jonathan White married twice: 

* Peregrine White (Jr.), born in Marshfield c.1661. He was baptized at Brattle Street Church, Boston, on 16 February 1723/4 aged 62, and died in Boston on 20 November 1727 aged 66.
:Peregrine White Jr. married twice:

* Sarah White, born in Marshfield in October 1663 and died in Scituate on 9 August 1755, aged 92. She married Thomas Young, son of George and Hannah (Pinson) Young, in Scituate in January 1688/9. Thomas Young was born in Scituate on 5 November 1663, and died there on 25 December 1732. They had nine children.
* Sylvanus White, born in Marshfield before 1667 and died in Scituate before 29 June 1688. He married Deborah Church, who was born in Hingham on 27 January 1656/7 and died after 30 June 1688. Deborah was possibly the daughter of Richard and Elizabeth (Warren) Church. Sylvanus and Deborah had one son.
* Mercy White, born c.1670 and died in Marshfield on 12 June 1739, aged 69. She married William Sherman, son of William and Desire (Doty) Sherman (who was a descendant of Pilgrim Edward Doty), in Marshfield on 3 February 1697. They had four children.

== Will ==
In 1704 - The will of Peregrine White (which is owned by and displayed at Pilgrim Hall in Plymouth), dated July 14, 1704, and proved August 14 of the same year states: &quot;Peregrine White of Marshfield…..Being aged and under many Weaknesses and Bodily Infirmities devised to his wife Sarah everything not otherwise disposed of by the will to his eldest son Daniel …personal items and land .. as well as various personal items and land to daughters Sarah and Mercy and sons Jonathan and Peregrine.&quot; His will was signed with the initials PW &quot;The mark of Peregrine White&quot; who was then aged almost 84 years.

== Death and burial ==
Peregrine White died on July 20, 1704 (Old Style), in Marshfield, Massachusetts at age 83 years and 8 months. He was buried in Winslow Cemetery in Marshfield, Massachusetts. He was the last surviving Pilgrim Father, though the last Mayflower passenger, Mary Allerton, died in 1699. His wife Sarah died on January 22, 1711, and was also buried in Winslow Cemetery. Additionally, Peregrine&#x27;s elder brother Resolved White, his wife Judith and their mother Susanna were all buried in Winslow Cemetery. Winslow Cemetery has a substantial stone monument to &quot;The Early Settlers of Green Harbor Marshfield&quot; naming, among others, Resolved and Peregrine White, their wives and mother Susanna as well as her second husband Edward Winslow.

== Obituary ==
Marshfield vital records note the death of &quot;Capt. Peregrine White&quot; on &quot;July ye 20:1704&quot; and the &#x27;Boston Newsletter&#x27; of Monday July 31, 1704, gives the following obituary: &quot;Marshfield, July, 22 Capt. Peregrine White of this town, Aged Eighty three years, and Eight Months; died the 20th Instant. He was vigorous and of a comly Aspect to the last; Was the Son of Mr. William White and Susanna his Wife;&#x27; born on board the &quot;Mayflower&quot;, Capt. Jones Commander, in Cape Cod Harbour.

<text>Zenker&#x27;s degeneration is a severe glassy or waxy hyaline degeneration or necrosis of skeletal muscles in acute infectious diseases; a prototype of coagulative necrosis.

The condition was named by Friedrich Albert von Zenker. It is a hyaline degeneration of skeletal muscles such as rectus abdominis and diaphragm, and occurs in severe toxaemia as typhoid fever. It is also seen in electrical burns. Grossly the muscles appear pale and friable; microscopically, the muscle fibres are swollen, have a loss of cross striations, and show a hyaline appearance. Rupture and small hemorrhage may complicate the lesion. Coagulative necrosis occurs here.

<doc id="920233" wikidata="Q189638" url="?curid=920233" title="Zenker's diverticulum">
<text>A Zenker&#x27;s diverticulum, also pharyngeal pouch, is a diverticulum of the mucosa of the human pharynx, just above the cricopharyngeal muscle (i.e. above the upper sphincter of the esophagus). It is a pseudo diverticulum or false diverticulum (only involving the mucosa and submucosa of the esophageal wall, not the adventitia), also known as a pulsion diverticulum.

It was named in 1877 after German pathologist Friedrich Albert von Zenker.

== Signs and symptoms ==

When there is excessive pressure within the lower pharynx, the weakest portion of the pharyngeal wall balloons out, forming a diverticulum which may reach several centimetres in diameter.

While traction and pulsion mechanisms have long been deemed the main factors promoting development of a Zenker&#x27;s diverticulum, current consensus considers occlusive mechanisms to be most important: uncoordinated swallowing, impaired relaxation and spasm of the cricopharyngeus muscle lead to an increase in pressure within the distal pharynx, so that its wall herniates through the point of least resistance (known as Killian&#x27;s triangle, located superior to the cricopharyngeus muscle and inferior to the thyropharyngeus muscle. Thyropharyngeus and cricopharyngeus are the superior and inferior parts of inferior constrictor muscle of pharynx respectively). The result is an outpouching of the posterior pharyngeal wall, just above the esophagus.

While it may be asymptomatic, Zenker diverticulum can present with the following symptoms:
* Dysphagia (difficulty swallowing), and sense of a lump in the throat
* Food might get trapped in the outpouching, leading to:
** Regurgitation, reappearance of ingested food in the mouth
** Cough, due to food regurgitated into the airway
** Halitosis, smelly breath, as stagnant food is digested by microorganisms
** Infection
It rarely, if ever, causes any pain.

Esophageal webs are seen associated in 50% of patients with this condition.

Rarer forms of cervical esophageal diverticula are the Killian&#x27;s diverticulum and the Laimer&#x27;s diverticulum. Killian&#x27;s diverticulum is formed in the Killian-Jamiseon triangle (between the oblique and transverse fibers of the cricopharyngeus muscle). Laimer&#x27;s diverticulum is formed in Laimer&#x27;s triangle (located inferior to the cricopharyngeus in the posterior midline above the confluence of the longitudinal layer of the superior esophageal circular muscle). Laimer&#x27;s triangle is covered only by the circular layer of esophageal muscle.

== Diagnosis ==
A combination of the simple barium swallow and a thorough endoscopy will normally confirm the diverticulum.

== Treatment ==

If small (ie, &lt;2 cm) and asymptomatic, no treatment is necessary. Larger, symptomatic cases of Zenker&#x27;s diverticulum have been traditionally treated by neck surgery to resect the diverticulum and incise the cricopharyngeus muscle. However, in recent times non-surgical endoscopic techniques have gained more importance (as they allow for much faster recovery), and the currently preferred treatment is endoscopic stapling (i.e. diverticulotomy with staples ). This may be performed through a diverticuloscope. Other methods include fibreoptic diverticular repair.

Other non-surgical treatment modalities also exist, such as endoscopic laser, which recent evidence suggests is less effective than stapling.

== Epidemiology ==

Zenker&#x27;s diverticulum mainly affects older adults. It has an incidence of 2 per 100,000 per year in the UK, but there is significant geographical variation around the world.

<doc id="920238" wikidata="Q3895159" url="?curid=920238" title="Peroneal nerve paralysis">
<text>Peroneal nerve paralysis is a paralysis on common fibular nerve that affects patient’s ability to lift the foot at the ankle. The condition was named after Friedrich Albert von Zenker. Peroneal nerve paralysis usually leads to neuromuscular disorder, peroneal nerve injury, or foot drop which can be symptoms of more serious disorders such as nerve compression. The origin of peroneal nerve palsy has been reported to be associated with musculoskeletal injury or isolated nerve traction and compression. Also it has been reported to be mass lesions and metabolic syndromes. Peroneal nerve is most commonly interrupted at the knee and possibly at the joint of hip and ankle. Most studies reported that about 30% of peroneal nerve palsy is followed from knee dislocations.

Peroneal nerve injury occurs when the knee is exposed to various stress. It occurs when the posterolateral corner structure of knee is injured. Relatively tethered location around fibular head, tenuous vascular supply and epineural connective tissues are possible factors that cause damage on the common peroneal nerve. Treatment options for nerve palsy include both operative and non-operative techniques. Initial treatment includes physical therapy and ankle-foot orthosis. Physical therapy mainly focuses on preventing deformation by stretching the posterior ankle capsule. A special brace or splint worn inside the shoe (called an Ankle Foot Orthosis) holds the foot in the best position for walking. Orthosis stretches posterior ankle structures. Physical therapy can help patients to learn how to walk with a foot drop.

==Signs and symptoms==

Signs and symptoms of peroneal nerve palsy are related to mostly lower legs and foot which are the following:
*Decreased sensation, numbness, or tingling in the top of the foot or the outer part of the upper or lower leg
*Foot drops (unable to hold the foot straight across)
*Toes drag while walking
*Weakness of the ankles or feet
*Prickling sensation
*Pain in shin
*Pins and needles sensation
*Slapping gait (walking pattern in which each step makes a slapping noise)

Patients may need pain relievers to control pain. Other medications that are used to reduce pain include gabapentin, carbamazepine, or tricyclic antidepressants such as amitriptyline. Whenever if possible, patients need to avoid or limit the use of medication to reduce the risk of side effects. If the pain is severe, a pain specialist can help patients to explore all options to relieve the pain. Physical therapy exercises may help patients to maintain muscle strength. Also, orthopedic devices may improve patient&#x27;s ability to walk and prevent contractures. Orthopedic devices may include braces, splints, orthopedic shoes, or other equipment.
Vocational counseling, occupational therapy, or similar programs may help patients to maximize their mobility and independence.

==Causes==
Causing factors of peroneal nerve palsy are such as musculoskeletal or peroneal nerve injuries. Usually paralysis occurs at the outside of the leg and the top of the foot. Palsy causes decrease of muscle strength to lift the foot, twist ankle outside, and move toes around. Major cause of palsy is due to dislocation of knee. Other possible causing factors are metabolic dysfunction of lower part of knee or disorientation of hip or pelvis. Damages on peroneal nerves destroy the myelin sheath that covers the axon or the whole nerve cell. There might be a loss of feeling, muscle control, muscle tone, and eventual loss of muscle mass because the nerves aren&#x27;t stimulating the muscles after they are damaged.
Dysfunction of a single nerve such as the common peroneal nerve is called a mononeuropathy. Mononeuropathy means the nerve damage is occurred in one area. However, certain conditions may also cause single nerve injuries.

Common causes of damage to the peroneal nerve include the following:
*Traumatic injury on the knee
*Fracture of the fibula
*Using a tight plaster cast (or other long-term constriction) of the lower leg
*Crossing the legs regularly
*Regularly wearing high boots
*Pressure to the knee from positions during deep sleep or coma
*Long period of resting on bed
*Broken leg bone

Common peroneal nerve injury is more common in people:
*Who are very thin (for example, from anorexia nervosa)
*Who have conditions such as diabetic neuropathy or polyarteritis nodosa
*Who are exposed to certain toxins that can damage the common peroneal nerve

Prolonged pressure on nerve may occur because of:
*Sitting position
*Blood clots, tumors
*Casts on lower leg due to tightness

==Diagnosis==
For partial nerve palsy, more than 80% of patients will recover completely.
For complete nerve palsy, less than 40% of patients will have complete recovery.
Peroneal nerve in continuity arises from defined cause will be recovered better than those arise from unknown causes.

Examinations are required for following reasons:
*Considering lumbar radiculopathy during the examination
*Possibility of foot drop
*Sensory loss that may be difficult to determine because of variable and small autonomous zone of sensation
*Tinel&#x27;s sign over the fibular neck that can help localize the site of nerve compression
*Checking for direct compression that reproduces nerve symptoms

===Electromyography===

Electromyography is used to observe peroneal nerve palsy within one month of injuries. And if it is partial peroneal nerve palsy, patients have higher chance to recover fully from the palsy. More than 70 to 80 percent of patients with partial paralysis recovered completely, but those with complete paralysis have chances less than 30 percent to recover completely. If the symptom does not get any better in few months, surgery is required to decompress the nerve.

===Nerve conduction velocity===

Nerve conduction velocity is an important aspect of nerve conduction studies. It is the speed at which an electrochemical impulse propagates down a neural pathway. Conduction velocities are affected by a wide array of factors, including age, sex, and various medical conditions. Studies allow for better diagnoses of various neuropathies, especially demyelinating conditions as these conditions result in reduced or non-existent conduction velocities. To perform nerve conduction velocity, surface electrodes are placed onto the skin over nerves at various locations. Each patch sends electrical impulses which stimulate the nerve. Resulting electrical activity of nerve is recorded by the other electrodes. The distance between electrodes and the time it takes for electrical impulses to travel between electrodes are used to determine the velocity of the nerve signals.
===MRI===

An MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) scan is an imaging test that uses powerful magnets and radio waves to create pictures of the body. It does not use radiation. Single MRI images are called slices. The images can be stored on a computer or printed on film. One exam produces dozens or sometimes hundreds of images. To locate nerve palsy, MRI is used by physicians to detect the position and location of damaged peroneal nerve.

==Prevention==
Avoid putting long-term pressure on the back or side of the knee. Treat injuries to the leg or knee right away. If a cast, splint, dressing, or other pressure on the lower leg causes a tight feeling or numbness, call the health care provider.

*Avoid crossing legs
*Move around actively and frequently
*Wear knee protections if working on knee
*Alert physician if feeling numbness on leg when casted

==Treatments==
Precise knowledge about the length and exact localization of a damaged nerve segment is essential for surgical intervention. On one hand, certain preoperative information about the overall state of an injured nerve (state of the neural and perineural tissue) is important because exploratory inspection of a nerve itself may lead to additional inadvertent damage. If, on the other hand, the surgeon, during genicular ligament reconstruction, inspects a nerve at the site of most probable injury only (limited neurolysis), he or she may sometimes by chance expose an unaffected section of a nerve. Because of the mechanism of nerve injury during traction, however, a more proximal or distal segment of the nerve may be severely damaged. A limited nerve inspection without preoperative knowledge about the site of nerve injury may thus give the false impression of an unimpaired nerve and wrongly lead to conservative treatment of the nerve lesion. If no neurologic improvement is shown after 2–3 months from injuries, then operative decompression is indicated. Surgical operations such as grafting and tendon transfer are necessarily required.

===Tendon transfer===

Many different conditions can be treated by tendon transfer surgery. Tendon transfer surgery is necessary when a certain muscle function is lost because of a nerve injury. If a nerve is injured and cannot be repaired, then the nerve no longer sends signals to certain muscles. Those muscles are paralyzed and their muscle function is lost. Tendon transfer surgery can be used to attempt to replace that function. Common nerve injuries that are treated with tendon transfer surgery are spinal cord, radial nerve, ulnar nerve, or median nerve injury. Tendon transfers have higher chance to treat nerve palsy, and such transfers include posterior, anterior, and anteroposterior tibial tendon transfer. Peroneal nerve and its nerve branches need to be fixed from adherence to proximal fibula, which proximal fibula is about 3~5 cm.

===Tendon graft===

Grafting is a surgical procedure to move tissue from one site to another on the body, or from another person, without bringing its own blood supply with it. Instead, a new blood supply grows in after it is placed. A similar technique where tissue is transferred with the blood supply intact is called a flap. In some instances a grafting can be an artificially manufactured device. Examples of this are a tube to carry blood flow across a defect or from an artery to a vein for use in hemodialysis.

===Arthroplasty===

Arthroplasty on knee has been broadly used to treat knee and musculoskeletal joint dislocation. It is an elective procedure that is done to relieve pain and restore function to the joint after damage by arthritis or some other type of trauma. However, there has been series of reports arthroplasty worsens condition of peroneal nerve, causing paralysis. Other forms of arthroplasty include resection (al) arthroplasty, resurfacing arthroplasty, mold arthroplasty, cup arthroplasty, silicone replacement arthroplasty, etc.

==History==

Friedrich Albert von Zenker (1825–1898) was a German pathologist and physician, celebrated for his discovery of trichinosis. He was born in Dresden and was educated in Leipzig and Heidelberg. He worked in the city hospital of Dresden in 1851 and became a professor of pathological anatomy and general pathology in the surgico-medical academy of the city. In 1862 he became a professor of pathological anatomy and pharmacology at Erlangen. Three years later he assumed with Ziemssen the editorship of the Deutsches Archiv für klinische Medizin. In 1895 he retired from active service. His important discovery of the danger of trichine dates from 1860. In that year he published &quot;Über die Trichinenkrankheit des Menschen&quot; (&quot;On the trichine-illness of humans&quot;, in volume XVIII of Virchow&#x27;s Archiv). Zenker also found Zenker&#x27;s degeneration and Zenker&#x27;s diverticulum.

<text>Harmony Corruption is the third studio album by British grindcore band Napalm Death, released in July 1990 on Earache Records.

==Music==
&quot;Harmony Corruption&quot; has been characterized by its &quot;sluggish rhythms and a generally sludgy sound.&quot; According to music journalist T Coles, the album &quot;makes a clear effort to be structured, naturally bringing their style closer to the bands in the Florida scene&quot; and introduces a &quot;tighter architecture to their berserk style.&quot; Described as a stylistic &quot;handbrake turn&quot; for the band, the album represents a shift in genre from grindcore to &quot;standard death metal&quot;, featuring technical riffs and deep low vocals. The tracks have been called &quot;full-fledged songs [...] not start-stop eruptions of noise&quot; and &quot;straightforward death metal songs, not grindcore blasts.&quot; 

Notably, it was recorded at Morrisound Recording in Tampa, Florida, where many classic death metal albums were recorded. Additionally, members of prominent Florida Death Metal bands Glen Benton (Of Deicide) and John Tardy (Of Obituary) were guest vocalists for the song &quot;Unfit Earth&quot;. The album has been described as &quot;more expansive&quot; than its predecessors, which have been called &quot;one- or two-minute grindcore blasts.&quot;

The guitar work between Pintado and Harris has been described as &quot;varied and intricate&quot; compared to that of Bill Steer, their predecessor in the band, whose style was described as a &quot;frenzied, distorted blur.&quot;

It is the first Napalm Death album to feature Mark &quot;Barney&quot; Greenway as the vocalist and Americans Mitch Harris and Jesse Pintado as guitarists, and the last with Mick Harris on drums.
==Release==
Harmony Corruption was the band&#x27;s third UK chart entry, peaking at number 67. Richard Johnson, a member of Agoraphobic Nosebleed, says that the wide distribution of &quot;Harmony Corruption&quot; ensured that it had a greater impact on the American grindcore scene than earlier Napalm Death efforts.

The track &quot;Suffer the Children&quot; was released as single on vinyl and CD, which features the non-album tracks &quot;Siege of Power&quot; and &quot;Harmony Corruption&quot;. A video was made for &quot;Suffer the Children&quot;. Additionally, limited vinyl pressings included the bonus LP with a live performance recorded at I.C.A. 

The tracks from the &quot;Mentally Murdered&quot; EP, are included at the end of early editions of the CD, though versions now in print feature only the standard eleven tracks.

In 2012, Earache Records released a remastered edition, containing bonus tracks.

==Reception==

The album was met with a polarized reception upon release and has continued to divide listeners. Decibel described the album as, &quot;a milestone in extreme music history.&quot; Conversely, Allmusic described the album as, &quot;a bit of a novel album for the band, though one that&#x27;s not especially remarkable in the big picture.&quot;

Shane Embury has said of the album&#x27;s reception, &quot;it turned a lot of people on to the band who I guess had never given us the time of day, but also turned old-school fans off. Being young at the time and seeing the reactions was kind of scary; as you get older, opinions matter less, but it captured the time. Over in the states it has the same nostalgia as Scum. We will always have to play &#x27;Suffer the Children.&#x27;&quot;

<text>Aer Lualdi &amp; C SpA was an Italian helicopter manufacturer. The company produced several prototypes

== History ==

Aer Lualdi was founded in Rome in 1953 by Carlo Lualdi, who had purchased a license to produce a Hiller-designed rotor system (the Hiller &quot;Rotor-Matic&quot;) and thereby became the Italian agent for Hiller Helicopters.

Carlo Lualdi had previously used this rotor system in his experimental Lualdi-Tassotti ES 53, which featured a rotor design based on Hiller with a controllable transverse secondary rotor and first flew at Campoformido in 1953. With his new company Lualdi now built a succession of more powerful helicopters incorporating the Rotor-Matic system with a gyro stabilizer of his own design.

The first helicopter following the ES 53 was the L.55, an all-metal prototype which was followed by the L.57 and culminated in the four-seat L.59 which was selected for production by Macchi. One full prototype was built, and the commercial type certificate issued in August 1961.

Air Lualdi never went into full production and closed down in 1964, after the L.59 was cancelled.

<text>Field Marshal Sir Gerald Walter Robert Templer (11 September 1898 – 25 October 1979) was a senior British Army officer. He fought in both the world wars and took part against the Arab Resistance in Palestine. As Chief of the Imperial General Staff, the professional head of the British Army between 1955 and 1958, Templer was Prime Minister Anthony Eden&#x27;s chief military adviser during the Suez Crisis. He is also credited as a founder of the United Kingdom&#x27;s National Army Museum.

Templer is best known for implementing strategies that heavily contributed to the defeat of the Malayan National Liberation Army (MNLA) during the Malayan Emergency. Some historians have described his methods as a successful example of a &quot;hearts and minds&quot; campaign, while other scholars have dismissed this as a myth due to his over-reliance on population control and coercion. Templer also oversaw, ordered, and personally approved of many controversial policies and numerous atrocities committed by his troops. These including the use of internment camps called &quot;New Villages&quot;, the forced relocation of ethnic minorities, forced conscription, collective punishment against civilians, the hiring of specialist Iban-headhunters to decapitate suspected communists, pioneering the use of Agent Orange (later used in Vietnam), and the use of scorched earth policies deprive the MNLA of resources.

Many of the strategies he enforced were later (unsuccessfully) implemented by the United States in Vietnam.

==Early life and education==
Gerald Walter Robert Templer was born on 11 September 1898 at 15 Wellesley Road, in Colchester, Essex, the son (and only child) of Lieutenant-Colonel Walter Francis Templer, of the Royal Irish Fusiliers, and Mabel Eileen Templer (née Johnston). Of Irish descent, Templer attended an infant school at Rosslyn, Scotland, before being sent to Edinburgh Academy in 1904, later attending a preparatory boarding school at Connaught House, Weymouth, from 1909 until 1911. In January 1912 he was sent to Wellington College, Berkshire and stayed there until shortly after his 17th birthday in September 1915, a year into the First World War. His time at Wellington was, due mainly to initially being severely bullied, not the happiest period of his life, as he later wrote &quot;I loathed and detested my four years at Wellington&quot;, although he also admitted to making numerous friends there.

== First World War ==
From Wellington he then entered the Royal Military College, Sandhurst in December 1915 and, after attending a shortened course for the war, was commissioned as a second lieutenant into his father&#x27;s regiment, the Royal Irish Fusiliers, on 16 August 1916, just under a month before his 18th birthday. In contrast to his time at Wellington, Templer greatly enjoyed Sandhurst, and later wrote with amusement that he &quot;was a completely undistinguished cadet from every point of view and passed out – nobody failed at that stage of the First World War because we were so badly needed as cannon fodder – in July 1916, a couple of months before my eighteenth birthday&quot;. Due to his age, however, he was unable to serve overseas and was sent to the 3rd (Reserve) Battalion in Buncrana in Inishowen, on the north coast of County Donegal, in Ulster, Ireland.

Templer remained with the battalion until mid-October 1917 when, now aged 19, he was sent to the 7th/8th (Service) Battalion on the Western Front. The battalion was a Kitchener&#x27;s Army unit serving as part of the 49th Brigade of the 16th (Irish) Division. However, he was posted to &#x27;C&#x27; Company of the 1st Battalion in mid-November a Regular Army unit, then serving in the 107th Brigade of the 36th (Ulster) Division. Soon after Templer&#x27;s arrival, the battalion took part in the Battle of Cambrai in late November, although Templer himself took no part in the battle and the battalion, and his &#x27;C&#x27; Company in particular, sustained heavy losses. In early February 1918 Templer&#x27;s battalion, the 1st Irish Fusiliers, was transferred to the 108th Brigade, due to a severe manpower shortage in the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) on the Western Front, which necessitated the reduction of all British brigades from four to three battalions. He was promoted to lieutenant on 16 February 1918. On 20 March Templer, seriously ill, passed out while in the trenches, suffering from acute diphtheria, and he was later evacuated to England. The German Army launched their Spring Offensive the day after and, while he was away his battalion sustained over 770 casualties out of a strength of some 800 men. He returned to the battalion, now composed of mainly teenagers, and fought with it in the Hundred Days Offensive, which saw the war turn in favour of the Allies and eventually resulted in the Armistice with Germany being signed and the war ending on 11 November 1918. Templer was considerably lucky during the war, having not been wounded, although, as with many others of his generation, it left its mark on him in other ways. He wrote, many years later, &quot;I still sometimes in my sleep at night hear the screams of the wounded horses, galloping on the ground, tripping over barbed wire, and treading on their own guts. It was a terrible thing to have to witness, worse in some ways than the human casualties&quot;. A week before his death Templer had this dream again, over sixty years after the war.

==Interwar period==
He remained in the army during the interwar period and served with his battalion, still the 1st Irish Fusiliers, after briefly returning to England, in operations in Persia (now Iran) and Iraq in 1919–20 as part of a multi-national attempt to prevent the spread of bolshevism, which was followed by service in Egypt. Returning to England with the battalion, where it was amalgamated with the 2nd Battalion in November 1922, Templer was a reserve for the 1924 Summer Olympics as a 120-yard hurdler, although in the end he did not compete. In January 1925 the battalion again returned to Egypt, where it remained until October 1927 when it was sent to India, although Templer did not accompany them. Just before the battalion sailed for India he had returned to England to attend the Staff College, Camberley, which he did from 1928 to 1929, and was the youngest student there, aged just 29. Among his many fellow students were men such as John Harding, Richard McCreery, Gordon MacMillan, Alexander Galloway, Gerard Bucknall, Philip Gregson-Ellis, Alexander Cameron and Cameron Nicholson. In the year senior to him were Eric Dorman-Smith, John Hawkesworth, John Whiteley, Evelyn Barker, Oliver Leese, Ronald Penney, Robert Bridgeman, Philip Christison and numerous others while, in Templer&#x27;s second year, in the year below, were George Erskine, Harold Freeman-Attwood, Neil Ritchie, Herbert Lumsden, Reginald Denning and Maurice Chilton. Templer&#x27;s instructors there included Bernard Paget, Henry Pownall and Bernard Montgomery. Due to the Royal Irish Fusiliers being reduced to a single battalion in 1922, and thus promotion in the regiment being slower than in the rest of the army, Templer was forced to transfer to the Loyal Regiment (North Lancashire), to gain a promotion to captain, which was backdated to 11 August 1928. After graduation from the Staff College, Templer joined the 2nd Battalion of his new regiment, then stationed at Aldershot, in January 1930.

He later became a General Staff Officer Grade 3 (GSO3) with the 3rd Division on Salisbury Plain in 1931. While there his immediate superior, Colonel Edmund Osborne, the division&#x27;s GSO1, who took a disliking to Templer, wrote a confidential report, severely criticizing Templer&#x27;s performance and recommending he be retired from the army. Surviving this, Templer then was GSO2 at HQ Northern Command in York in 1933 before returning to the 2nd Loyals to be a company commander at Tidworth in April 1935. While at Northern Command he first met Harold Alexander, then a colonel, who was his superior as GSO1, and the two remained great friends until Alexander&#x27;s death in 1969. In January 1936 Templer, along with a large draft of replacements from the 2nd Loyals, was deployed to Palestine to serve with the 1st Loyals, with Templer commanding &#x27;A&#x27; Company, during the Arab revolt there, for which he was awarded the Distinguished Service Order (DSO) on 6 November 1936 and mentioned in dispatches. His experience in Palestine had a profound impact on him, as he said in 1970 in a BBC interview, &quot;I&#x27;ve felt terribly strongly all my life, from my youth, on racial and religious clashes – ever since my boyhood in Ireland. That was a feeling that which was strengthened by my service in Palestine in 1935–6, the Jew-Arab problems: I felt them bitterly in my heart&quot;. In July 1937 he left Palestine and returned to England, where he became GSO2 of the 53rd (Welsh) Infantry Division, a Territorial Army (TA) formation, where he came to the attention of senior officers. In April 1938 Templer transferred back as a captain in the Royal Irish Fusiliers, although he remained seconded for staff duties. He was promoted to major on 1 August 1938 and posted to the War Office as a GSO2 at the Directorate of Military Intelligence (DMI). In this role he helped in the creation and training of the Intelligence Corps.

==Second World War==
At the outbreak of the Second World War in September 1939 Templer was an acting lieutenant-colonel, and, on 4 September, the day after war was declared, he was chosen to be one of two GSO1s to the DMI of the British Expeditionary Force (BEF), Major-General Noel Mason-MacFarlane, replacing the original choice, Kenneth Strong. He soon found himself in France. Templer&#x27;s duties were mainly concerned with counter-intelligence and security. The German Army attacked in the West on 10 May 1940, although Templer himself was then on leave but was back in France and discovered Mason-MacFarlane was in Brussels, with the intelligence staff moving behind him but was a long distance from GHQ BEF, resulting in poor communications. On 17 May General Lord Gort, the BEF&#x27;s Commander-in-Chief (C-in-C), feared for the BEF&#x27;s right flank along the River Scarpe and, due to a shortage of troops, ordered Mason-MacFarlane to form &quot;Macforce&quot; to hold the river with whatever troops could be found. Templer subsequently became GSO1 of &quot;Macforce&quot;. The only unit of any size then available was Brigadier John Smyth&#x27;s 127th Brigade, detached from its parent 42nd Division, which was soon strengthened by armoured cars of Lieutenant-Colonel George Hopkinson&#x27;s &quot;Hopkinson Mission&quot;, and some scattered artillery and engineer units. The 127th Brigade was soon replaced by the 139th Brigade (also detached its parent 46th Division) and &quot;Macforce&quot; continued taking on scattered units and, after a few small skirmishes but no major engagements, was eventually disbanded. With the BEF retreating to Dunkirk, both Mason-MacFarlane and Templer were evacuated to England, arriving there on 27 May.

Soon after returning to England Templer was, in mid-June, ordered to Chichester to raise the 9th Battalion of the Royal Sussex Regiment, one of many then being raised in the aftermath of Dunkirk. The battalion was to be based around a small cadre of Regular soldiers from the 2nd Battalion, Royal Sussex who, like Templer, had recently returned from France, and the rest of the battalion was to consist of newly called up conscripts, most of whom were in their late twenties with no previous military experience. The battalion moved to Ross-on-Wye soon after its official formation on 4 July 1940. The task was made more difficult by the lack of rifles and other necessary equipment but Templer tried his best to train his men instil in them a regimental pride.

In early November he was given the command of the 210th Independent Infantry Brigade (Home), composed of five battalions, all less than six months old, in Dorset, with responsibility for the defence of the coast in the event of a German invasion between Lyme Regis and Poole. The brigade was then serving under V Corps, commanded by Lieutenant-General Bernard Montgomery, one of Templer&#x27;s instructors at the Staff College, who thought highly of him and the two, who shared similar outlooks on training and waging war, established a close working relationship. Captain Michael Joseph, a company commander in the 9th Battalion, Queen&#x27;s Own Royal West Kent Regiment, part of the 210th Brigade, claimed Templer &quot;understood the difficulties and the problems of the platoon commander, which is more than can be said of some others&quot;. Work on the beach defences combined with training and continued throughout the winter and into the spring, and in late April 1941 the brigade, now with a slightly different composition, came under the command of the Dorset County Division, one of the newly created British County Divisions formed specifically for static defence. However, on 7 April Montgomery was promoted to the command of XII Corps in Kent and Sussex and recommended to the War Office that Templer be the Brigadier General Staff (BGS) of V Corps, which now came under the command of Lieutenant-General Edmond Schreiber. Like Montgomery, Schreiber formed a high opinion of Templer and they got along well together. The summer was spent mainly on numerous exercises. In early March 1942 Schreiber was promoted to command of &quot;Force 110&quot;, later redesignated as the First Army, and V Corps passed to Lieutenant-General Charles Allfrey. Soon afterwards, however, Templer received note that he was to take over the command of a division. Templer was promoted to substantive colonel on 6 October 1941, with seniority from 1 July.

Templer became General Officer Commanding (GOC) of the 47th (London) Infantry Division, based in Winchester, Hampshire as an acting major-general on 10 April 1942, serving under V Corps. The division – comprising the 25th, 140th and 141st Infantry Brigades and supporting units – was a second-line TA formation, formerly the 2nd London Division, redesignated the 47th Division in November 1940. Placed on the Lower Establishment in December 1941, the division was understrength in manpower and equipment and men were constantly posted as drafts overseas, but the men were well-trained, due to their previous GOC, Major-General John Utterson-Kelso, one of the best trainers in the British Army. According to a battalion commander, Lieutenant-Colonel Kenneth Darling, commanding the 11th Battalion, Royal Fusiliers, Templer &quot;inspired the Division with enthusiasm, keenness and efficiency&quot;, and &quot;made them believe they were going to meet the Germans – and beat them. He inculcated a tremendous fighting spirit&quot;. Another junior staff officer, Edward Jones, believed Templer to be very nervy but keen, claiming he never slept during an exercise, no matter the length and believed he would burn himself out.

He did not remain there for much longer, however, as, in September 1942, he was promoted to become GOC II Corps as the British Army&#x27;s youngest acting lieutenant-general. However, the corps was actually II Corps District, a static formation, with responsibility for the defence of northern East Anglia against invasion. By this time, the threat of invasion had much receded and, by early 1943, much of Templer&#x27;s command had been posted away, the 1st Division moving to North Africa and the 76th Division being reduced to a reserve division, leaving Templer with little more than 30 Home Guard battalions. Then, in April 1943, he took command of XI Corps, with the 54th and 61st Divisions and numerous smaller units under command, after II Corps was disbanded. His corps responsibility was for the defence of all of East Anglia. Despite this, Templer was growing impatient at training troops and wished for a field command. To this end, in July, he approached General Sir Bernard Paget, the Commander-in-Chief, Home Forces (and formerly one of Templer&#x27;s instructors at the Staff College), and offered to give up his rank of acting lieutenant-general so that he could command a division on active service. His offer was accepted and, together with Gerard Bucknall (a fellow student at the Staff College who, like Templer, had risen rapidly but was presumably sharing his mindset), Templer, reverting to major-general on 30 July, flew out to Algiers, arriving there the day after.

Templer became GOC of the 1st Infantry Division, which had come under his command while he was GOC II Corps, on 31 July 1943. The division, with the 2nd, 3rd Infantry Brigades and the 24th Guards Brigade and supporting units, was based south of Tunis and had recently fought, with great distinction, in the final phases of the Tunisian campaign, where it had gained three Victoria Crosses (VC) in the space of a week. The division was then training for future participation in the Italian campaign. In late August General Sir Harold Alexander, commanding the Allied 15th Army Group, along with numerous and senior US and British generals, arrived to present the VC to Lance Corporal John Kenneally of the 1st Battalion, Irish Guards. Shortly afterwards, the division was involved in a divisional parade, with General Dwight &quot;Ike&quot; Eisenhower, the Supreme Allied Commander in the theatre, reviewing the entire division. Templer himself wrote about the moment, saying:

Despite managing to concentrate the division and get it training in mountain warfare, Templer was not destined to lead the 1st Division into battle, although he was later to meet it again in Italy.

On 10 October 1943, Major-General Douglas Graham, the GOC of the 56th (London) Infantry Division, then fighting in Italy, was seriously injured when his jeep tumbled into a shell crater and Templer was ordered to Italy to replace him. He arrived in Italy on 15 October, when the division was in the middle of crossing the Volturno. The division, a first-line TA formation, with the 167th, 168th and 169th Infantry Brigades and supporting troops, along with the 201st Guards Brigade under Brigadier Julian Gascoigne temporarily attached, had taken part in the Allied invasion of Italy at Salerno the month before as part of British X Corps, under Lieutenant-General Richard McCreery (a fellow student of Templer&#x27;s at the Staff College in the late 1920s), and had suffered heavy casualties, and the division was still understrength.

In February 1944, the division, now under U.S. VI Corps, fought in the Battle of Anzio where Templer temporarily commanded the British 1st Infantry Division after the GOC, Major-General Ronald Penney, was wounded by shellfire. He was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath on 24 August 1944 in recognition of his services in Italy.

In late July 1944, Templer briefly became GOC 6th Armoured Division before being severely injured by a land mine in August, after being GOC for twelve days. Promoted to major-general on 17 April 1945, he spent the rest of the war on intelligence duties in 21st Army Group HQ as well as briefly heading the German Directorate of the Special Operations Executive (SOE). He was mentioned in dispatches on 8 November 1945 in recognition of his services in North West Europe.

==Postwar==
On 17 October 1946, Templer was awarded the Legion of Merit in the Degree of Commander by the President of the United States for his conduct during the war. He was also appointed a Commander of the Order of Leopold II of Belgium and Croix de guerre and a Grand Officer of the Order of Orange Nassau of the Netherlands with Swords.

He served as Deputy Chief of Staff for the British Element (CCG/BE) of the Allied Control Commission for Germany after the Second World War, for which he was appointed a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George in the King&#x27;s Birthday Honours 1946. 

He first came to public notice in 1945 while acting as Director of the Military Government in the British Zone of Germany, when he fired the mayor of Cologne, Konrad Adenauer, for &quot;laziness and inefficiency&quot;. This became an issue in 1954, when it was mooted he should become commander of the British Army of the Rhine; fearing an adverse reaction from Adenauer – who was now Chancellor – the British Prime Minister, Winston Churchill demurred and Templer was not appointed after his tour in Malaya ended.

Templer became Director of Military Intelligence at the War Office in March 1946, then Vice Chief of the Imperial General Staff in February 1948. Having been promoted to lieutenant-general on 5 April 1948 and appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the New Year Honours 1949, he moved on to be General Officer Commanding Eastern Command on 18 February 1950. He was promoted to general on 4 June 1950, advanced to Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath in the King&#x27;s Birthday Honours 1951, and appointed Aide-de-Camp General to the King on 30 August 1951. He also became a Knight of the Venerable Order of Saint John.

==High Commissioner for Malaya==

On 22 January 1952, Winston Churchill appointed Templer British High Commissioner for Malaya to deal with the Malayan Emergency. Working closely with Robert Thompson, the Permanent Secretary of Defence for Malaya, Templer&#x27;s tactics against the Malayan National Liberation Army (MNLA) were held up by Heathcote as &quot;one of the most successful of the British Army&#x27;s counter-insurgency campaigns&quot;. In military terms Templer concentrated his efforts on intelligence. Templer famously remarked that, &quot;The answer [to the uprising] lies not in pouring more troops into the jungle, but in the hearts and minds of the people.&quot;

He instituted incentive schemes for rewarding surrendering rebels and those who encouraged them to surrender and used strict curfews and tight control of food supplies to force compliance from rebellious areas to flush out guerillas. Crops grown by the communists in response to these measures were sprayed with herbicide and defoliants (2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyacetic acid), the practice of which prepared the way for American use of Agent Orange in Vietnam. Restrictions on food and curfews were lifted on so-called &quot;White Areas&quot; which had been found to be free of communist incursion.

In private correspondences with Colonial Secretary Oliver Lyttleton, Templer defended the practice of British troops employing Dayak headhunters to cut the heads off suspected MNLA guerillas. The widespread use of decapitations by Templer&#x27;s troops in Malaya was exposed to the public by a British communist newspaper called &quot;The Daily Worker&quot; when they published the first known photographs of the decapitations in April 1952.

During his time in Malaya, Templer became commonly known as the &quot;Tiger of Malaya&quot;, a title previously enjoyed by the Japanese general Tomoyuki Yamashita, who had captured Singapore and Malaya in 1942. In response to an article in &quot;Time&quot; magazine that &quot;the jungle had been stabilised&quot;, he declared &quot;I&#x27;ll shoot the bastard who says that this emergency is over&quot;. The Malayan government eventually declared the Emergency over in 1960. He was advanced to Knight Grand Cross of the Order of St Michael and St George for his work as High Commissioner in the Coronation Honours List in June 1953.

Although Templer&#x27;s actions were successful in helping to defeat the MNLA, they required the use of many controversial strategies, including the continued use of internment camps known as &quot;New Villages&quot;, the forced relocation of ethnic minorities, forced conscription, collective punishment against civilians, the hiring of specialist headhunters to decapitate suspected communists, herbicidal warfare through the use of Agent Orange, and the widespread killing of livestock and destruction of food crops to deprive the MNLA of resources.

In 1952 the poet Randall Swingler wrote a poem about Templer titled &quot;The Ballad of Herod Templer&quot;. The poem is believed to have been inspired by the British-Malayan headhunting scandal.

The Malaysian Government arranged for the Main Hall at the Royal Military College, Kuala Lumpur in Sungai Besi, which had been established in 1952, to be named the &quot;Tun Templer Hall&quot; in his honour. They also named after him Templer&#x27;s Park, a nature reserve established in 1955 in Rawang, as well as the Selangor state assembly constituency surrounding it.

==Later military career==

Advanced to Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath in the Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours 1955, Templer was appointed Chief of the Imperial General Staff on 29 September 1955. In this capacity he advised the British Government on the response to the Suez Crisis. He was promoted to field marshal on 27 November 1956 and retired on 29 September 1958.

Templer was also appointed Colonel of the Royal Irish Fusiliers from 1946, Colonel of the Malay Federation Regiment from 1954, Colonel of the 7th Duke of Edinburgh&#x27;s Own Gurkha Rifles from 25 May 1956, Colonel of the Royal Horse Guards from 1963 and Colonel of the Blues and Royals from 1969.

In retirement Templer focused on his main passion which was establishing the National Army Museum in London, who have named their library, archive and reading room as &quot;The Templer Study Centre&quot; in his honour. The Malaysian Government conferred on him the award of Grand Commander of the Order of the Defender of the Realm, which carries with it the title &quot;Tun&quot;, on 13 October 1960. He also appointed a Knight Companion of the Order of the Garter on 16 September 1963 and Constable of the Tower on 1 August 1965. He chaired a committee of the rationalisation of air power in 1965 and was appointed Lord Lieutenant of Greater London on 28 December 1966. He died of lung cancer at his home in Chelsea on 25 October 1979. He was buried in the Churchyard of St. Michael in the Wiltshire village of Wilsford cum Lake.

In 1981 the Society for Army Historical Research established the Templer Medal, awarded annually to the author of the book published during that year that has made the most significant contribution to the history of the British Army, to commemorate Templer&#x27;s life and achievements and to mark his presidency of the Society between 1965 and 1979.

==Family==
On 8 September 1926 he married Edith Margery (Peggie) Davie in the church of Plympton St Mary, Devon. Gerald had first met her in 1921, and again in 1924, and they were engaged after 10 days.

<doc id="920247" wikidata="Q663616" url="?curid=920247" title="Yard (sailing)">
<text>A yard is a spar on a mast from which sails are set. It may be constructed of timber or steel or from more modern materials such as aluminium or carbon fibre. Although some types of fore and aft rigs have yards, the term is usually used to describe the horizontal spars used on square rigged sails. In addition, for some decades after square sails were generally dispensed with, some yards were retained for deploying wireless (radio) aerials and signal flags.

== Parts of the yard ==

; Bunt : The short section of the yard between the &quot;slings&quot; that attach it to the mast.
; Quarters : The port and starboard quarters form the bulk of the yard, extending from the slings to the fittings for the lifts and braces.
; Yardarms : The outermost tips of the yard: outboard from the attachments for the lifts.

Note that these terms refer to stretches of the same spar, not to separate component parts.

== Controlling the yard ==
The yard can rotate around the mast to allow the direction of the vessel to be changed relative to the wind. When running directly downwind the yards are &#x27;squared&#x27; (pointing perpendicular to the ship&#x27;s centre line and to the mast). As the ship is steered closer to the wind the yards are braced round using the braces. When further rotation is obstructed by other bits of rigging (typically the shrouds), the yard is said to be braced &quot;hard round&quot; or &quot;sharp up&quot;, as in &quot;sharp up to port&quot;. This angle (normally about 60 degrees) limits how close to the wind a square rigged ship can sail.

The yards represent a considerable weight high above the vessel&#x27;s centre of gravity; to increase stability, especially in heavy weather, some means is normally provided to lower some of the yards when they are not being used to set sails. In nineteenth-century warships (where a large crew was available) this was generally by physically &quot;sending down&quot; the upper yards from the masts and storing them on deck—along with, in many cases, the upper sections of the mast itself. Merchant ships in the age of sail would also do this before sailing in the Southern Ocean. On modern tall ships the yards are not designed to be sent down on deck, but &#x27;lifting yards&#x27; that can be raised and lowered along a short section of mast using a halyard are often used.

== Going aloft ==
In order to set and stow the square sails, the crew must climb aloft and spread out along the yards. To do this, they stand in footropes suspended beneath the yard and balance themselves between that and the yard itself. The person working on the end of the yardarm has a separate footrope known as the flemish horse. &quot;Jackstays&quot; run along the top of the yard. The sail will be bent on to one of them, but a second one is often provided (particularly on larger yards) for the crew to hold on to. These are usually steel rods, but stiff cordage stretched between the yardarms was used in the past.

Almost all ships used in modern times are fitted with steel safety wires (sometimes erroneously called jackstays) along the yards to which sailors attach themselves using a harness. This is a relatively recent innovation. Cargo-carrying and naval sailing ships were not so equipped and falling from the yard represented a real risk.

== Setting square sails ==

The yard exists to allow square sails to be set to drive the ship. The top edge of the sail is &#x27;bent on&#x27; (attached) to the yard semi-permanently. Clewlines and buntlines are led along the yard and from there to the mast and down to the deck. These allow the bottom of the sail to be hoisted up to the yard, so the sail is effectively folded in two. In this state the sail is said to be &quot;in its gear&quot;, that is ready for setting or stowing. To set the sail the clewlines and buntlines are let go, and the sheets (attached to the bottom corners, or clews, of the sail) are adjusted to shape the sail to best catch the wind. A device called a &quot;tye&quot;, a &quot;tye chain&quot;, or a &quot;tye rope&quot; is used for lifting a given yard to the top of its travel to set the sail.

To stop using (i.e., to &quot;hand&quot;) the sail, the sheets are released and the clewlines and buntlines are pulled tight. The sail folds in half—back in its gear—and so no longer catches the wind. Unless the sail is to be used again very soon, the next step is to &quot;stow&quot; it. To do this, the crew must go out along the yard in order to bundle the sail up tightly and tie it down with gaskets.

== Manning the yards ==

When coming into port, especially during the Tall Ships&#x27; Races many modern square riggers will &#x27;man the yards&#x27;. All the crew not required on deck to handle the ship will go aloft and spread out along the yards. This manoeuvre was originally used to display the whole crew to the harbour authorities and the other ships present, to show that the ship&#x27;s guns were not manned and hence her intentions were peaceful.

== Fore and aft yards ==
As well as the square-rig yard, the traditional lateen rig is a triangular sail rigged fore and aft from a long yard mounted at an angle (downward sloping forward) from the mast. As well, some smaller fore and aft rigs use a yard. The spar at the head of a lug sail – a roughly square sail which is set fore-and-aft but requires different handling from a more modern gaff or Bermuda rig – is known as a yard, and probably developed from the original square-rig yard. The spar at the head of a gunter-rigged sail serves the function of a running topmast, but is not given that name. Some would call it a &#x27;gaff&#x27;, while others would use the name &#x27;yard&#x27;.

==&quot;Sun over the yardarm&quot;==

This phrase is used, both afloat and ashore, to indicate that the time of day has been reached at which it is acceptable, variously, to have lunch or (more commonly) to have an alcoholic beverage. In modern parlance, the latter usage typically refers to early evening, but the phrase is thought originally to have referred to late morning and to the sun&#x27;s ascent past a particular yard.

The actual time that the sun would pass a particular yard would depend greatly on the ship&#x27;s latitude and heading, as well as the height of her masts, but the phrase seems to have originated in the north Atlantic, where, in summer, this would have typically been at about 11 a.m. This was the time at which, by custom and rule, the first rum &quot;tot&quot; of the day was issued to men (the senior rates had their tots neat, while the junior rates had theirs diluted with water), hence its connection with taking one&#x27;s first alcoholic drink of the day.

The earliest mention of this phrase collected by the OED is in Rudyard Kipling&#x27;s &quot;From Sea to Sea&quot; in 1899, where it is used as a metaphor referring to drinking habits. However, the phrase was in use earlier, in the same context. One example is from the first volume of &quot;Life&quot;, from the issue of May 31, 1883.

==The yardarm&#x27;s use in maritime punishment==
The yardarm has found use in maritime punishment. In the Royal Navy, offences such as murder, mutiny, desertion or striking an officer carried the death penalty, which at sea would usually be carried out by hanging from the yardarm itself. Instead of the usually quick death a hanging ashore ensured, the condemned man would have the noose placed around his neck, before the end of the rope was passed over the yardarm. A group of sailors would then pull him into the air where he would remain for at least half an hour. The last man hanged in this manner in the Royal Navy was Private John Dalliger in 1860, after stealing brandy and shooting two officers aboard HMS &quot;Leven&quot;.

Another less common punishment, notably practised upon mutineers from the Dutch East India Company ship &quot;Batavia&quot; as well as captured pirates, was to be dropped or ducked from the yardarm. This entailed the accused having a rope fixed to the yardarm and tied under their arms, before being dropped into the sea. They would then be hauled back onto the ship, where the punishment could be repeated up to three times. In more severe cases, the offender would then be keelhauled.

<text>The Lualdi-Tassotti ES 53 was an Italian experimental helicopter designed by Carlo Lualdi around a Hiller-designed rotor system and a gyro stabiliser of his own design. It first flew at Campoformido in September 1953.

The helicopter was powered by a single 63.4 kW (85 hp) Continental C85 engine and proved so promising that Lualdi purchased a licence to produce the Hiller rotor system in Italy, and formed a new company, Aer Lualdi to develop and market his designs as the Aer Lualdi L.55.

<text>John Kinley Tener (July 25, 1863May 19, 1946) was an Irish-born American politician and Major League Baseball player and executive. He served as the 25th governor of Pennsylvania from 1911 until 1915. A Republican, he had previously served as a U.S. Representative for Pennsylvania&#x27;s 24th congressional district.

During his baseball career, Tener played as a pitcher and outfielder for the Baltimore Orioles of the American Association, the Chicago White Stockings of the National League, and the Pittsburgh Burghers of the Players&#x27; League; after his playing career, he served as President of the National League.

==Biography==
John Tener was born in 1863 in County Tyrone (today in Northern Ireland). His parents were George Evans Tener and Susan Wallis. In 1872, Tener&#x27;s father died, and the family moved the following year to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

Tener attended public schools and later worked as a clerk for hardware manufacturer Oliver Iron and Steel Corporation from 1881 to 1885.

In 1885, Tener, who was six-foot-four (1.93 meters), decided to try his hand at professional baseball. He joined the Haverhill, Massachusetts, minor league baseball team in the New England League as a pitcher and outfielder and was a teammate of future Hall of Fame players Wilbert Robinson and Tommy McCarthy. Later that year, Tener made his Major League debut with the Baltimore Orioles of the American Association, playing in a single game as an outfielder.

While playing in Haverhill, Tener met his future wife, Harriet Day. They married in October 1889.

After his brief appearance in Baltimore, Tener continued playing minor league ball, but also returned to the corporate world, working for the Chartiers Valley Gas Company in Pittsburgh and Chambers and McKee Glass Company. In 1888, Cap Anson, the manager of the Chicago White Stockings (now the Chicago Cubs), noticed him pitching in Pittsburgh and signed Tener to a contract. Tener was a pitcher and an outfielder for two years in Chicago with moderate success. He notched a 7–5 record with a 2.74 ERA in 1888 and went 15–15 with a 3.64 ERA in 1889.

After the 1888 season, Tener accompanied the team on a world tour of Australia, New Zealand, Egypt, France, Italy and England. While in England, Tener was chosen to help explain the game of baseball to the Prince of Wales, who would go on to become King Edward VII.

Tener was elected as Secretary of the Brotherhood of Professional Players, an early players union and served under President John Montgomery Ward, a future member of the Baseball Hall of Fame. In 1890, unhappy with baseball&#x27;s reserve clause, Tener joined other players in jumping to the Players&#x27; League. Playing for the Pittsburgh Burghers, Tener compiled a poor 3–11 record. The league folded after one year and Tener decided to retire from professional baseball.

He entered the banking business in Charleroi, Pennsylvania, in 1891, becoming a cashier at the First National Bank of Charleroi. By 1897, he was the president of the bank. Over the years, Tener became a prominent business leader, founding the Charleroi Savings and Trust Company and the Mercantile Bridge Company.

==Political career==
In 1908, Tener, a Republican, was elected to serve in the 61st United States Congress from Pennsylvania&#x27;s 24th congressional district. As a former ballplayer, Tener organized the first Congressional Baseball Game which is now an annual tradition on Capitol Hill.

Tener planned to run for re-election in 1910. Instead, the Republican Party nominated Tener as its candidate for Governor where he would face a divided electorate. Pennsylvania experienced a scandal during the construction of the new Pennsylvania State Capitol. State Treasurer William H. Berry had found that there had been an unappropriated cost for the building&#x27;s construction of over $7.7 million ($ today), including a number of questionable charges. The scandal led to the conviction of the building architect and a former State Treasurer. Berry failed to get the Democratic nomination and broke away taking independent Republicans and Democrats to form his new Keystone Party.

Tener won the election with 415,614 votes (41.7%) over Berry with 382,127 (38.2%) with the help of a 45,000-vote victory in the City of Philadelphia. The Democratic candidate, State Senator Webster Grim of Doylestown, Pennsylvania, finished third with 13%. Governor Tener was the first Governor since the American Revolution to be born outside the United States and only the second in Pennsylvania&#x27;s history to have been born outside of the state.

Tener&#x27;s initiatives as governor included reforming the state public school system and the highway system. With schools, Tener signed into law the School Code of 1911, which established a State Board of Education empowered to set minimum standards and minimum salaries. The Code also mandated that all children regardless of race or color between the ages of eight and sixteen would be required to attend school.

The Governor also signed the Sproul Highway Bill into law, which gave the state responsibility over 9,000 public roads that counties and cities had previously maintained. Rebuffed by the voters for a bond issue to fund the program, Tener signed a bill designating fees from automobile registrations and drivers licenses to be used for road funding. In 1913, the Governor sign a bill requiring hunting licenses in Pennsylvania, using the fees generated by the licenses to fund conservation programs.

Tener also signed in to action in 1913 a bill that would lead to the creation of the Pennsylvania Historical Commission (PHC), which years later would be merged to form the Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission (PHMC). This would allow funding to be allocated to the preserve and protect the Commonwealths heritage through the Pennsylvania Historic Markers Program and the transfer of historic properties to PHC.

==Baseball executive==
Tener maintained his interest in baseball after retiring as a player. In 1912, Governor Tener spoke out against gambling in baseball, and informed district attorneys around the state that he believed existing laws could be used against illegal wagering. He also offered the influence and assistance of the state government to support any district attorney who chose to act against wagering.

In 1913, Philadelphia Phillies owner William Baker proposed offering the position of National League president to Tener after the owners declined to extend the contract of president Thomas Lynch. Tener accepted the offer at a contract of $25,000 ($ today) per year, but was not paid until April 1915 when his term as Governor expired.
Early in his administration, Tener had his hands full as league president, serving a double role as Governor of Pennsylvania. The Federal League declared itself a major league and began competing for players in 1914. A number of players began jumping to the new league including Joe Tinker.

At the same time, Tener had to mediate a dispute between Chicago Cubs owner Charles Murphy and Cub manager and star player, Johnny Evers. Evers claimed that he had been fired by Murphy after a salary dispute. Murphy claimed in turn that the future hall-of-famer had resigned with the intent of jumping to the new Federal League. Murphy later attempted to broker a trade to the Boston Braves in which the Cubs would receive Boston star Bill Sweeney. The League originally ruled that Murphy had broken the terms of Evers&#x27;s contract by not giving him ten days notice before the dismissal and that the punishment would be that Boston did not have to give the players to Chicago. This led to a protest by Murphy.

At the time, Murphy was not a well-regarded owner by his peers and the League was afraid that Evers would go to the Federal League to join his former teammate, Joe Tinker. The dispute gave the owners the opportunity to rid themselves of Murphy. Tener arranged for newspaper publisher Charles P. Taft, who was a minority shareholder and had helped the league to force out Phillies owner Horace Fogel, to buy the team and force Murphy out.

Tener later faced the prospect of players&#x27; strikes in 1914 and 1917. In 1914, the Baseball Players Fraternity, led by Dave Fultz threatened to strike over the transfer of Clarence Kraft to the minor leagues from the Brooklyn Robins. Brooklyn had tried to send Kraft to their minor league club in Newark, New Jersey, but the Nashville Vols claimed that they had the rights to Kraft. Going to Nashville would have cost Kraft $150 ($ today) in salary. When baseball&#x27;s National Commission ruled that Kraft had to report to Nashville, he appealed to Fultz for help. Although American League President Ban Johnson sought a confrontation, Tener brokered a deal in which Brooklyn paid for Kraft&#x27;s rights and sent him to Newark.
Tener ruled Benny Kauff ineligible to join the New York Giants baseball team in April 1915. Kauff played center field for the Giants on April 29, 1915. Tener said that Kauff, a member of the Brooklyn Tip-Tops of the Federal League, was a jumper from organized baseball. In order to play for New York of the National League, he needed formal reinstatement.

In 1917, Fultz, emboldened by his efforts in the Kraft cash presented a list of demands to the National Commission to improve the playing conditions in the minor leagues. Tener rejected three of the demands as they were unrelated to Major League Baseball and only applied to minor league players. Tener also noted that the fourth demand, that injured players be paid their full salaries, had already been met in the 1917 contract. Fultz went on to threaten to affiliate with the American Federation of Labor and lead the players on a walkout if his demands were not met.

Even though Tener himself had been a member of the Brotherhood of Professional Players in his playing days and, as part of the National Commission, initially certified the Player&#x27;s Fraternity in 1914, he was not amused by the threats. On the labor side, AFL leader Samuel Gompers did not welcome the idea and many major leaguers were not interested in striking for the benefit of minor league players. The National Commission, immediately withdrew recognition from the Players&#x27; Fraternity. Afterwards, the Players&#x27; Fraternity membership declined and the organization ceased to exist.

In November 1917, Tener accepted a one-year contract extension, but was troubled by the infighting between the National League&#x27;s owners. In 1918, the league became embroiled in a dispute with the American League over the rights to pitcher Scott Perry. Tener believed that Philadelphia Athletics owner Connie Mack had broken an agreement with both leagues by going to court in the matter. Tener demanded that the National League break off relations, which could have included cancelling the World Series. However, the owners did not support him and Tener resigned in August 1918.

==Later life==
After leaving baseball, Tener returned to his business interests in Pittsburgh. In 1926, he tried to gain the Republican nomination to run again for Governor but was unsuccessful, finishing third at the convention. In the 1930s, Tener was elected as a director of the Philadelphia Phillies.

In 1935, Tener&#x27;s wife Harriet died. In 1936, he married Leone Evans who died in 1937 after an illness. He engaged in the insurance business until his death, aged 82, in Pittsburgh in 1946.

He was interred in Homewood Cemetery in Pittsburgh.

Buildings named in his honor include a residence hall in the East Halls area of the University Park campus of the Pennsylvania State University and the Charleroi Public Library.

In 1999, the Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission installed a historical marker in Charleroi, noting Tener&#x27;s historic importance.

<doc id="920280" wikidata="Q161792" url="?curid=920280" title="The Dell (Southampton)">
<text>The Dell on Milton Road, Southampton, Hampshire, England was the home ground of Southampton F.C. between 1898 and 2001.

==New stadium==
Since 1896, Southampton had been a tenant of Hampshire County Cricket Club at the County Ground, having vacated the Antelope Ground in the summer of 1896. The rent payable to the cricket club - £200 a year - was putting a strain on the football club&#x27;s finances and, in an attempt to reduce this burden, the club had considered a merger with the Freemantle club and a move to its ground in Shirley. The merger proposals had fallen through, but at the extraordinary general meeting in June 1897, the members were informed that &quot;the committee had a ground in view&quot;.

At a shareholders&#x27; meeting on 11 November 1897, the chairman stated:. . . that all being well, by next season the company would be in possession of its own ground which was at the present time in the hands of George Thomas Esq. who was devoting his time to its early completion. Although the minutes do not record the location of the new ground, it was common knowledge within the town that the new ground was situated. . . in the dell that is not far from the County Ground, and nearer West Station and the town, and at the present time it is a narrow valley with a stone culvert running along the bottom. It will not be a large ground, but the natural banks on all sides will be a great help in arranging for the convenience of the spectators.

The site on which the ground was built was described in Philip Brannon&#x27;s &quot;Picture of Southampton&quot;, published in 1850, as &quot;a lovely dell with a gurgling stream and lofty aspens&quot;; the stream is the Rollsbrook which flows out of Southampton Common, running parallel to Hill Lane before now disappearing under Commercial Road and the Central Station, from where it flows through a conduit under Southampton Docks into Southampton Water. The land had been purchased in the 1880s by the Didcot, Newbury and Southampton Railway to enable them to continue their line from Winchester via Twyford, Chandlers Ford, a tunnel at Chilworth and Shirley where it was to pass to the north-east of what is now St James&#x27; Park and St. James&#x27; Church. From here the line would have travelled south across Hill Lane to run through the dell and onto an embankment leading to a viaduct over Commercial Road and the London and South Western Railway line before terminating on the Western Esplanade, north of the Royal Pier. The dell was stripped of vegetation and the stream channelled into a conduit with work started on the embankment, which survives behind property to the north of Commercial Road but was never used, and the viaduct which was part built but later demolished. The project was abandoned at this point and agreement reached to connect to the London and South Western Railway at Shawford Junction with running rights into Southampton.

==Construction==
George Thomas, a fish merchant who had been appointed as a director of the limited company when it was formed in the summer of 1896, who lived in Shirley, saw the potential of the cleared site and purchased the land from the D.N.S.R. By the beginning of the 1898–99 season, Thomas had incurred expenditure of between £7,500 and £9,000 on acquiring and clearing the site, and erecting the new stands and had agreed an initial three-year lease to the football club at a rental of £250 p.a. The dell had been drained with 13,000 ft of pipe being laid, all draining into the central culvert formed from the Rollsbrook stream. The playing field had to be levelled and the ground made up and turfed ready for the opening of the new season. On completion, the stadium was described in the &quot;Southampton Observer&quot;:. . . the rising staging on the north side of the ground will hold 5,500 spectators, who have of course to stand up; the covered east and west stands will seat 4,000 spectators comfortably, and the staging and sloping bank on the south side will hold 15,000 spectators. This totals up to 24,500.

At this stage, the new ground did not have an official name, with various names suggested including the &quot;Fitzhugh Dell&quot;, the &quot;Archer&#x27;s Ground&quot; and &quot;Milton Park&quot; but gradually the ground became known by default as &quot;the Dell&quot;.

==Early days==
The stadium was opened in September 1898, with the inaugural match on 3 September being against Brighton United. The first goal at the stadium was scored by Watty Keay, with the others from Abe Hartley, Jim McKenzie and Tom Smith, as Southampton won 4–1. It hosted an international match in 1901, as England defeated Ireland 3–0 in the 1900–01 British Home Championship.

==Redevelopment==
In 1927, the original West Stand was demolished (together with the club secretary&#x27;s house) and the new West Stand was built. This was designed by Archibald Leitch, one of the greatest football stand designers of the day, who had also designed stands at Fratton Park, Roker Park and at Goodison Park. A year later, on the last day of the 1928–29 season a dropped cigarette caused a fire which destroyed the East Stand. A replacement stand was built which mirrored the West Stand, increasing the ground capacity to approximately 30,000.

==Wartime incidents==
On 30 November 1940, a German bomb fell on the stadium during the Blitz, creating an 18-foot crater in the Milton Road penalty area. While the pitch was being restored, Southampton had to play their remaining fixtures in 1940–41 away, although in February 1941, they played a &quot;home&quot; War Cup tie with Brentford at Fratton Park, Portsmouth.

In March 1941, an explosion of munitions stored at the ground caused a major fire in the West Stand although this was rebuilt soon afterwards.

At the start of the 1941–42 season they played their home games at Dew Lane, Eastleigh, before the Dell was re-opened in October 1941.

==Post-war==

In 1950, the Dell became the first ground in England to have permanent floodlighting installed. The first game played under the lights was on 31 October 1950, in a friendly against Bournemouth &amp; Boscombe Athletic, followed a year later by the first &quot;official&quot; match under floodlights, a Football Combination (reserve team) match against Tottenham Hotspur on 1 October 1951.

During the post-war years, huge crowds packed into the Dell. The attendance record was broken on 8 October 1969, when 31,044 watched Southampton lose 3–0 to a Manchester United team which included George Best and Bobby Charlton. The stadium hosted First Division football for the first time in the 1966-67 season, and would do so for all but four of the 35 seasons leading up to its closure. During this time, Southampton won the FA Cup in 1976, and achieved their highest league finish of second place in 1984.

==Further redevelopment==
In the 1980s, there were several changes at the ground, with the makeshift &quot;chocolate boxes&quot; at the Milton Road end being replaced by a new stand used for family ticket holders a two level concrete structure. The standing areas under the East and West stands being fitted with bench seats, before the Dell became an all-seater stadium in the early 1990s in the wake of the Hillsborough disaster on 15 April 1989, which obliged all clubs in the top two English divisions had all-seater stadiums. New stands were erected at both ends of the stadium, but by the 1993–94 season the stadium now had a capacity of just over 15,000, the smallest in the top level of English football. The Milton Road Stand was notable for its wedge-like appearance.

==Final days==
By this time, Southampton F.C. was looking for a new home. By the mid-1990s it seemed as if the search was over as the club announced plans to move to a new stadium at Monks Brook playing fields near the village of North Stoneham, Eastleigh. However, the club fell into a dispute with the local council about the lack of community facilities. Many people in Eastleigh were also unhappy with having another town&#x27;s football club in their area. The dispute was resolved when the chairman, Rupert Lowe, declared new plans for the club to move to a new 32,000-seat stadium, for a cost of £32 million, on Brittania Road on the banks of the River Itchen. The move was confirmed at the end of the 1998–99 season (when Southampton achieved a late escape from relegation for the sixth time in eight seasons) and work began soon afterwards.

The new St Mary&#x27;s Stadium was ready for the 2001–02 season.

On 4 April 2001, the first ever Football Aid event took place at the Dell (including former players Jimmy Case and Peter Rodrigues). The last confirmed hat-trick was scored during this game by Bryn Thomas.

On 19 May 2001, midfielder Matt Le Tissier (who retired from playing a year later) said goodbye to the stadium that had been host to his entire professional career by scoring a volley in the final minutes of the final league game securing a 3–2 win against Arsenal. Le Tissier thus has the distinction of scoring the last competitive goal at The Dell.

On 26 May, the club&#x27;s fans said goodbye to the Dell by stripping all of its seats, the pitch and even an advertising board after Southampton&#x27;s last game at the stadium, a 1–0 victory in a friendly against Brighton and Hove Albion, the first and last opponents at the stadium. The last goal ever scored at the Dell was by Uwe Rösler.
The Dell was demolished later, completed on Friday 13 July 2001 by Portsmouth-based demolition company, Hughes &amp; Salvidge. A housing estate was later built on the site by Barratt Homes.

The apartment blocks on the site bear the names of former Southampton players:

* Stokes Court
* Ted Bates Court
* Le Tissier Court
* Wallace Court
* Channon Court

The site includes a green space that occupies the area of the former centre circle.

<text>Werdohl () is a town in the district Märkischer Kreis, in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany.

==Geography==
Werdohl is located in the hills of the Sauerland, at a double meander of the river Lenne and its confluent, the Verse. The highest elevation is the &quot;Hölzerne Klinke&quot; with 448.8m above sea level, the lowest is in valley of Lenne at the boundary to the city Altena with 162m.
Werdohl shares borders with (clockwise) Altena, Neuenrade, Plettenberg, Herscheid and Lüdenscheid.
A large part of the area, about 19.2 km2, is meadows and forests and is used for agriculture and forestry, followed by 3.18 km2 of residential areas and 1.24 km2 are commercial and industrial areas.

===Urban districts===
The city centre is located at the banks of the river Lenne and at the foot of surrounding hills. The townships are Versevörde, where the river Verse flows into the river Lenne, Königsburg, Rodt and Erlhagen.

Kettling lies upstream of the Lenne at the border to Plettenberg. Ütterlingsen, Dresel and Elverlingsen are downstream of the Lenne towards the border to Altena.

Following the Verse from upstream from Versevörde to Lüdenscheid, the townships Osmecke, Pungelscheid, Kleinhammer, Eveking, Bärenstein and Oberborbecke are located upstream in the valley of the Verse (Versetal) or on the hills forming the valley.

==History==
The first document which mentions Werdohl dates to the year 1101. Bishop Heinrich II. from Paderborn mentions the church of Werdohl, which was donated by count Erpo of Padberg to the monastery Boke/Flechtdorf. In 1220 the Priorat Berentrop took over the ownership, which in 1300 was bought by count Everhard II. of the Mark.

Werdohl was long administered in the Amt Neuenrade, however at the end of the 19th century the population of Werdohl was higher than those of the other municipalities in the Amt together. On June 1, 1891 Werdohl left the Amt and became self-administered, after it failed to get the seat of the Amt administration to be moved to Werdohl. On April 19, 1936 the municipality received city rights.

==Coat of arms==

The coat of arms of Werdohl shows a rose, which was already present in the seal of the church. To the right are three chain segments, the symbol of the family Neuhoff, a noble family which resided in the municipality in the past. The bottom part shows the red-white chequered bordure as the symbols of the counts of the Mark.

The first attempt of Werdohl to receive a coat of arms was started in 1915, when they asked Dr. Hildebrandt of the editorial staff of the &quot;Deutscher Herold&quot; in Berlin to create a concept for a coat of arms. The draft already resembled the later coat of arms, only the rose was in silver on black ground. However the war and then the end of monarchy in Germany delayed for several years. In 1929 Otto Hupp created two drafts of the coat of arms, one of which was then accepted by the municipality council on August 29, 1929. It later turned out that the coat of arms need to be officially granted, which happened on January 16, 1935.

In 1936 the &quot;Landrat&quot; of Westphalia lobbied to have the coat of arms changed. He requested a draft from the heraldic Waldemar Mallek, which showed a Zeppelin in the top part, the chain in bottom, separated by the chequered bordure. It was however not accepted by the mayor of Werdohl, and was not pursued further.

==Economy==
Amongst the biggest employers headquartered in Werdohl are Schaeffler Engineering, a company of Schaeffler Group, nickel alloy producer VDM Metals and the technology company Vossloh, market leader for rail fasteners and switch systems.

==International relations==
Werdohl is twinned with:
Since April 6, 1975 Werdohl has a city partnership with the English district Derwentside. Since August 10, 1990 it has a partnership with the city Stavenhagen in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania.

<doc id="920288" wikidata="Q1190653" url="?curid=920288" title="Nico Robin">
<text>, otherwise known as &quot;Devil Child&quot;, is a fictional character in the &quot;One Piece&quot; franchise created by Eiichiro Oda. The character made her first appearance in the 114th chapter of the series, which was first published in Japan in Shueisha&#x27;s &quot;Weekly Shōnen Jump&quot; magazine on November 22, 1999.

In the series, Robin is introduced as an antagonist, but eventually becomes the seventh member of the Straw Hat Pirates crew, captained by Monkey D. Luffy. Acting as the group&#x27;s archaeologist and historian, Robin is a Devil Fruit user who possess the power of the Flower-Flower Fruit, allowing her to sprout replicas of her limbs, and later her entire body, from any surface. As the only survivor of the island of Ohara, Robin is the only known living person in the world of &quot;One Piece&quot; with the ability to read the ancient stones called Poneglyphs, something considered threatening by the World Government, which forbids the practice.

Robin has become extremely popular and a breakout character in anime and manga fandom. She has also appeared in several adaptations based on the manga, including the anime television series in which she is voiced by Yuriko Yamaguchi and Anzu Nagai as a child in the original Japanese language, as well as by Veronica Taylor and Stephanie Young and Jad Saxton as a child in the English versions. She has also become a popular subject of cosplay, causing a trend in Japan where women attempted to replicate her iconic costumes.

==Concept and creation==
The character of Nico Robin was created by manga artist Eiichiro Oda, the author of the manga series &quot;One Piece&quot;, and she made her first appearance in its 114th chapter, titled &quot;The Course&quot;, which was first published in Shueisha&#x27;s &quot;Weekly Shōnen Jump&quot; magazine on November 22, 1999. As a fan of film director Quentin Tarantino, Oda stated that he used as a source of inspiration for Robin&#x27;s design the character of Mia Wallace, played by Uma Thurman in &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; (1994), one of Tarantino&#x27;s most famous films. According to Oda, Robin has her birthday on February 6, and is 6.2 feet tall which is around 188 cm. When asked by a fan what the nationalities of the members of the Straw Hat Pirates would be if &quot;One Piece&quot; was set in the real world, Oda replied that Robin would be Russian. Robin was a later addition to the story and Robin and Franky are the only crew members who did not appear in the original concept art for the Straw Hats. However there was a male member who was a botanist, which may allude to Robin’s Devil Fruit power. 

Nico Robin, a character from &quot;One Piece,&quot; is of the Oharan race. She is the only survivor of the Ohara Island&#x27;s destruction, known for its scholars. In the world of &quot;One Piece,&quot; races can vary widely, and the Oharans were known for their knowledge and expertise in archaeology.

===Abilities===
Robin ate the Flower-Flower Fruit, a Paramecia-type Devil Fruit that allows her to sprout duplicates of any of her body parts from any surface within range. The number of duplicates she can create appears to be unlimited, so long as they are within range. Usually, when she uses her powers, she crosses her arms and makes an &quot;X&quot; shape across her chest, though it&#x27;s shown that she does not necessarily need to do so to use her abilities.

She can sprout her duplicate body parts from her own body, inanimate surfaces, and even from other people&#x27;s bodies. She can even sprout duplicate body parts on top of other duplicate body parts. She maintains full control of her duplicated limbs and can perceive sights and sounds remotely through duplicate eyes and ears.

Robin can create entire clones of herself and even sprout gigantic-sized limbs.

==Appearances==
===In &quot;One Piece&quot;===
Being raised in Ohara, home of the world&#x27;s oldest and largest library, Nico Robin becomes an archaeologist at the age of eight. At some point she gains the power of the Paramecia-type Flower-Flower Fruit, which allows her to have temporary copies of parts of her body, including her eyes and ears, which spring up on surfaces near her. Behind her teachers&#x27; backs, she acquires from them the outlawed knowledge of how to translate the ancient stones called Poneglyphs, which are scattered around the world. She comes to share their goal of finding the elusive Real Ponegliff, which is said to tell the world&#x27;s lost history. However, the World Government finds out about these efforts and sends a battlefleet to stop them. Only Robin escapes the devastating attack that claims the lives of the island&#x27;s entire population, including that of her mother, Nico Olvia.

Given the epithet &quot;Devil Child&quot; by the World Government, traumatized, and with a bounty on her head, Robin lives a life on the run, unable to trust anyone. To survive, she cooperates with various pirates and other outlaws. She eventually joins Sir Crocodile&#x27;s Baroque Works group, using the codename Ms. All-Sunday and becoming their vice-president. After Baroque Works falls apart, with nowhere else to go, she tags along with the Straw Hat Pirates and grows so fond of them that she gives herself up to the Government in order to save them. After they discover her real reason for leaving, the Straw Hat Pirates declare open war against the Government to get her back. She realizes that she has finally found people who will never sell her out and becomes part of the crew.

Two years later, Robin further hones her Flower-Flower Fruit powers to the point where she can create a full-bodied duplicate of herself and even wings composed entirely of arms and hands that allow her to fly. After Robin was unsuccessfully captured in Wano by CP0, the Government&#x27;s direct intelligence agency after another Cipher Pol organization CP9 had already failed to execute her two years prior, her bounty was raised to over seven times her previous bounty, from 130,000,000 to 930,000,000.

===In other media===
In the anime television series adaptation of the manga, Robin&#x27;s voice actress is Yuriko Yamaguchi. In the 4Kids Entertainment English adaptation, her Baroque Works codename was changed to Miss Sunday and she is voiced by Veronica Taylor who portrays her with a country accent. In the Funimation English adaptation, her voice is supplied by Stephanie Young. In addition to the anime, Robin is featured in many of the adaptations based on the &quot;One Piece&quot; media franchise, including films, video games, and others as well. Emiya Ichikawa II performed as Robin in a kabuki play inspired by &quot;One Piece&quot; that ran at Tokyo&#x27;s Shinbashi Enbujō throughout October and November 2015. Robin has also appeared as a playable character in the crossover fighting games &quot;Jump Super Stars&quot; and &quot;Jump Ultimate Stars&quot;. Robin is set to be portrayed by Lera Abova in the live action adaptation.

==Reception==

===Popularity===
Nico Robin is one of the most popular characters in the &quot;One Piece&quot; series. Nico Robin has earned her place among anime audiences for many reasons. Ever since her debut, she has become a popular subject of cosplay, causing a trend in which female fan readers of the series attempt to replicate the various iconic looks of the character that have been shown over the years. In 2013, website Tokyo Otaku Mode held a poll asking anime and manga fans via Facebook which characters they would most want to date; Robin was ranked in 2nd place. In 2014, Goo Ranking conducted a poll amongst NTT customers by asking for their favorite female and male black-haired anime characters, with Robin ranking in 6th place out of the top 15 females.

===Critical response===
Reviewing &quot;One Piece&quot;, Rebecca Silverman of Anime News Network (ANN) said that Robin &quot;watches everything with quiet, amused detachment&quot;, while also noting how Robin&#x27;s store of knowledge is &quot;steadily growing and she is starting to really put things together&quot;. Reviewing the 278th episode of the anime, Sam Leach of ANN commented that Robin&#x27;s &quot;big &#x27;I want to live!&#x27; scene is one of the most cathartic moments you&#x27;ll ever find in fiction&quot;.

Sean Cubillas of &quot;Screen Rant&quot; wrote, &quot;Based on aesthetics alone, Nico Robin is an easy fan favorite for her dark, mysterious design and attitude. Her backstory more than skyrocketed her to legendary status, as it brought tears to everyone&#x27;s eyes and expanded the series&#x27; scope and sense of politics. It didn&#x27;t take long after that for the series to truly immortalize her.&quot; In another article, Cubillas stated, &quot;Nico Robin, at first sight, is clearly one of the edgier characters of the group. She has a sharp stare to most and often carries herself with a mysterious demeanor. Her introduction into the series as an elite assassin and vice president to an underground organization likely hasn&#x27;t helped. Fortunately for her, she&#x27;s taken to the Straw Hats to lighten her demeanor and, in recent stories, has become more of a mother figure to the crew. However, just because she&#x27;s nicer, doesn&#x27;t mean that she doesn&#x27;t have the same, dark imagination. Whenever something dangerous or mysterious happens to the crew, Nico Robin always comes up with a darker scenario that dials up everyone&#x27;s tensions further.&quot;

<text>St Mary&#x27;s Stadium is a seated but also safe-standing football stadium in Southampton, Hampshire, England, which has been the home stadium of club Southampton since 2001. The stadium has a capacity of 32,384 and is currently the largest football stadium in South East England.

The Taylor Report on 29 January 1990 required all First and Second Division clubs to have all-seater stadiums by August 1994, Southampton&#x27;s directors initially decided to upgrade The Dell into an all-seater stadium (which was completed in 1993) but speculation about relocation continued, especially as an all-seater Dell had a capacity of just over 15,000; despite this, Southampton continued to defy the odds and survive in the new FA Premier League after 1992.

After a lengthy and ultimately unsuccessful attempt to build a new 25,000-seater stadium and leisure complex at Stoneham, on the outskirts of Southampton, the city council offered the club the chance to build a new ground on the disused gas work site in the heart of the city, about one and half miles from The Dell.

The move was cited as the club returning home, because the club was formed by members of the nearby St. Mary&#x27;s Church, as the football team of St. Mary&#x27;s Church Young Men&#x27;s Association before becoming Southampton St. Mary&#x27;s, and eventually Southampton. 
Construction started in December 1999 and was completed at the end of July 2001, with work on the 32,689 seat stadium itself and improvements to local infrastructure cost a total of £32 million.

The Saints have been in residence since August 2001 when they moved from The Dell, which for the final years of its life, held just over 15,000 spectators – less than half the size of the new stadium. The first match was played on 1 August 2001 against Espanyol, with the Spanish club winning 4–3.

The first competitive hat trick at the stadium was scored by Stafford Browne for Aldershot Town in a 3–1 victory over Havant &amp; Waterlooville in the Hampshire Senior Cup final on 1 May 2002.

In 2022, the stadium was used one of the venues to host the UEFA Women&#x27;s Euro 2022. It was used to host Group A matches, which had the hosts England.

==Description==

The stadium is a complete bowl, with all stands of equal height. There are two large screens at either end that can be seen from any seat.

The stadium has four stands, which are named after the areas of Southampton they face. The main (east) stand is the Itchen Stand, and faces the River Itchen. The opposite stand is called the Kingsland Stand. Behind the south goal is the Chapel Stand, and to the north is the Northam Stand.

At the rear of the Chapel, Kingsland and Northam Stands, there is a continuous, translucent &#x27;panel&#x27; that is designed to allow light to access the pitch. A large section of the roof at the Chapel Stand, at the southern end of the stadium is also translucent, for the same reason.

At the rear of the Itchen Stand, there are 42 executive boxes, and a police control room. The stand also houses the club&#x27;s offices, changing rooms, press facilities and corporate hospitality suites. The four main hospitality suites are named after some of Saints&#x27; greatest players:
* Terry Paine
* Mick Channon
* Bobby Stokes
* Matt Le Tissier

The Northam Stand is home to the majority of the more vocal supporters. Safe standing was installed in the Northam Stand partially in April 2024. The visiting supporters&#x27; section was also seated in this stand up until the 2023–24 season but is now located in the corner of the Kingsland and Chapel stands. Visitors can be given up to 4,250 seats (15 per cent of the capacity) for cup games, and up to 3,200 for league matches.

==Name==
The official ground name at opening was the Friends Provident St Mary&#x27;s Stadium. Initially the club wanted the ground to be named purely after the sponsors, but fan pressure influenced the decision to include a non-commercial title. In 2006 the new sponsor Flybe did not choose to purchase the naming rights to the stadium, meaning it reverted to St Mary&#x27;s Stadium.

==Capacity==
The ground has an all-seated capacity of 32,505, including the press and directors&#x27; boxes. Because of the segregation between home and away fans in the Kingsland and Chapel Stands, it is unlikely the full capacity will ever be reached for a competitive match.

The current record attendance was for the Football League Championship match between Southampton and Coventry City on 28 April 2012, when 32,363 spectators attended. The lowest league record was Southampton versus Sheffield United, when just 13,257 attended.

When the club was playing in the lower leagues this had a negative impact on attendances, although the Boxing Day fixture against Exeter City attracted an attendance of 30,890. During the 2009–10 League One campaign, attendances increased significantly, attracting 29,901 against Milton Keynes Dons in the Football League Trophy and then, just 4 days later, 31,385 in a South Coast derby against Portsmouth in the FA Cup. The overall average attendance for the league season was 20,982, a near 3,000 improvement on the previous season despite being a league lower. During the 2010–11 League One campaign the lowest attendance was 18,623 against Yeovil, while the highest was 31,653 against Walsall.

All stands, apart from the Itchen stand, can be built upon and expanded. Overall this would give an approximate capacity of around 50,000, and would cost a similar amount to how much it cost to build the stadium in the first place, which was approximately £32,000,000.

==The Ted Bates statue==

On 17 March 2007, the £102,000 statue to commemorate club stalwart Ted Bates was unveiled, outside the front of the Itchen Stand. Almost immediately, the statue was widely condemned by supporters due to it being out of proportion, and not an accurate likeness of the former club president. The statue was made by sculptor Ian Brennan.

Former chairman, Leon Crouch stated that he would help fund a replacement or remedial work, in association with the Ted Bates Trust, who were overseeing the collection of funds, commission and erection of the statue. The statue was removed less than a week after its unveiling. The replacement statue, by sculptor Sean Hedges-Quinn, was unveiled on 22 March 2008.

==Notable matches==
The St Mary&#x27;s Stadium has hosted two full England international matches, a 2–2 draw between England and Macedonia in October 2002, while Wembley Stadium was out of action due to redevelopment and the Football Association decided that England games would be played at various venues around the country. David Beckham and Steven Gerrard scored for England. The second was a 5–3 win against Kosovo in a Euro 2020 Qualifier on 10 September 2019. Raheem Sterling, Harry Kane and Jadon Sancho scored for England. There has also been an international between Japan and Nigeria.

The stadium first hosted European football in September 2003, when the Saints faced Romanian side Steaua Bucharest in the first round of the UEFA Cup. The game ended in a 1–1 draw.

In 2016, Southampton had their first venture in the UEFA Europa League and their first game against Czech side Sparta Prague ended in a 3–0 win. Later in the group stage, they faced former champions Inter Milan and won 2–1.

The venue hosted two England under-21 internationals. The first was a 2009 UEFA European Under-21 Championship qualification Group 3 match against the Republic of Ireland&#x27;s under-21s on 20 November 2008. The hosts thrashed the visitors 3–0 thanks to Stephen O&#x27;Halloran&#x27;s 60th minute own goal followed by James Milner&#x27;s 68th-minute goal and Theo Walcott&#x27;s 78th-minute goal with 31,473 in attendance. The other was an international friendly against Norway&#x27;s under-21s on 28 March 2011. The hosts beat the visitors 2–0 with goals from Daniel Sturridge on the ninth minute and Danny Rose on the 40th minute with 18,000 in attendance.

In 2022 the venue hosted three matches of the UEFA Women&#x27;s Euro 2022. Thursday 7 July: Norway vs Northern Ireland 
Monday 11 July: Austria vs Northern Ireland 
Friday 15 July: Northern Ireland vs England

Between Monday 1 June and Friday 5 June 2015, St Mary&#x27;s Stadium hosted a world record breaking match for the longest continuous football game ever played. Players from Southampton-based charity Testlands Support Project played for 102 hours straight, beating the previous record of 101 hours.

==Non-footballing use==
As is common for modern day stadia, St Mary&#x27;s is also used as a conference facility, with hospitality suites available for this purpose most days of the week.

In the Northam Stand the Saints Study Support Centre – a club-run initiative to help school children outside class – can be found, along with the offices of Southampton City Training, a quasi-council run organisation which helps young people get vocational training.

It is also used as a prom setting for many local schools of Southampton, including St. Anne&#x27;s, St. George&#x27;s, Thornden School, Wyvern School and Wildern Secondary School.

The stadium has also held film premieres for movies such as Casino Royale, as well as music concerts by Elton John in 2005 and Bon Jovi in 2006. There was a tribute to Elvis Presley in August 2007 and Southampton fan Craig David played at St Mary&#x27;s on 25 October 2007, although neither in the main bowl of the stadium. Bon Jovi returned to St Mary&#x27;s on 11 June 2008.
and on 6 June 2017 Robbie Williams had The Heavy Entertainment Show Tour. On 29 May 2018, The Rolling Stones performed at the stadium as part of their No Filter Tour. Alongside the Ricoh Arena in Coventry, St Mary&#x27;s was the smallest venue on the UK leg of the tour.
On 30 May 2022 St Marys Stadium hosted The Killers.
Take That performed at the stadium from 1 June 2024 for two nights as part of their This Life On Tour tour. Additionally, St Mary&#x27;s also houses the head office of the Hampshire &amp; Isle of Wight Air Ambulance since its founding in 2007.

St Mary&#x27;s was one of the 17 venues short-listed for use in the 2015 Rugby World Cup but was not selected for the final list.

==The site before the stadium==

The area the stadium is built on was for the most part previously part of Southampton gas works although there was also a certain amount of housing and guano tanks. As part of the construction of the stadium a partial archaeological excavation of the site. The area under the pitch was left undisturbed. This indicated that there had been some level of use of the site from the mesolithic onwards. The site became part of the settlement of hamwic from around 800AD onwards. A cemetery consisting of both complete bodies and cremated remains was discovered on the site of what would become the west stand. The Northam branch of the Salisbury and Southampton Canal crossed the most north-west part of the site and now lies beneath the railway footbridge.

==Folklore and local legends==
According to local legend, during construction of the stadium, a group of Portsmouth F.C. supporters buried their team&#x27;s shirt under the Northam Stand end of the pitch and cast a curse that caused the team&#x27;s initial losing streak at the new stadium. Pagan witch Ceridwen Dragonoak Connelly performed a Celtic ceremony to lift the curse just prior to the team&#x27;s first win.

<text>The British Museum algorithm is a general approach to finding a solution by checking all possibilities one by one, beginning with the smallest. The term refers to a conceptual, not a practical, technique where the number of possibilities is enormous.

Newell, Shaw, and Simon 
called this procedure the British Museum algorithm 
:&quot;... since it seemed to them as sensible as placing monkeys in front of typewriters in order to reproduce all the books in the British Museum.&quot;

<doc id="920296" wikidata="Q1305728" url="?curid=920296" title="Somewhere in Time (film)">
<text>Somewhere in Time is a 1980 American romantic fantasy drama film from Universal Pictures, directed by Jeannot Szwarc, and starring Christopher Reeve, Jane Seymour, and Christopher Plummer. It is a film adaptation of the novel &quot;Bid Time Return&quot; (1975) by Richard Matheson, who also wrote the screenplay.

Reeve plays Richard Collier, a playwright who becomes obsessed with a photograph of a young woman at the Grand Hotel on Mackinac Island, Michigan. Through self-hypnosis, he manifests himself back in time to the year 1912 to find love with actress Elise McKenna (portrayed by Seymour). He comes into conflict with Elise&#x27;s manager, William Fawcett Robinson (portrayed by Plummer), who fears that romance will derail her career, and attempts to stop him.

The film is known for its musical score composed by John Barry, featuring pianist Roger Williams. The 18th variation of Sergei Rachmaninoff&#x27;s &quot;Rhapsody on a Theme of Paganini&quot; is also used several times.

In 2018, Seymour disclosed that she and Reeve fell in love while working on the film. However, they broke up after Reeve found out his ex-girlfriend was expecting his child. The two remained close friends until Reeve died.

Despite negative critical reception and poor box office receipts in its original release, the film developed a cult following.

==Plot==
In 1972, college theater student Richard Collier celebrates the debut of his new play. An elderly woman approaches him, places a pocket watch in his hand, and pleads, &quot;Come back to me&quot;. After returning to her home, she dies in her sleep.

Eight years later, Richard is a successful playwright living in Chicago. While struggling with writer&#x27;s block, he decides to take a break and travel to a resort, the Grand Hotel. There he becomes enthralled with a vintage photograph of Elise McKenna, an early-20th century stage actress. She turns out to be the woman who gave him the pocket watch. Richard visits Laura Roberts, Elise&#x27;s former housekeeper and companion, and discovers a music box that plays the 18th variation of &quot;Rhapsody on a Theme of Paganini&quot; by Rachmaninoff, his favorite musical piece. Among Elise&#x27;s personal effects is a book on time travel written by his old college professor, Dr. Gerard Finney. Having fallen in love with Elise, Richard becomes obsessed with traveling back to 1912 and meeting her. He seeks out Finney, who believes that he briefly time-traveled through the power of self-suggestion. Dressed in an early 20th-century suit, Richard attempts to will himself to 1912 using tape-recorded suggestions. The attempt fails because he lacks real conviction, but after finding a hotel guest book from 1912 containing his signature, he realizes that he will succeed.

He hypnotizes himself again, allowing his faith in his eventual success to serve as the engine that transports him back in time. When he awakes in 1912, he finds Elise walking by the lake. Upon meeting him, she asks, &quot;Is it you?” Her manager, William Fawcett Robinson, intervenes and sends Richard away. Although Elise is initially uninterested, Richard pursues her until she agrees to accompany him on a stroll the next morning. He asks what Elise meant by &quot;Is it you?&quot; Elise reveals that Robinson had predicted that she would meet a man who will change her life and that she should be afraid. Richard shows Elise the pocket watch that she will give him in 1972.

Richard attends Elise&#x27;s play where she recites an impromptu romantic monologue while making eye contact with him. In the interval, Elise poses for a photograph and, once more making eye contact with Richard, breaks into a radiant smile. This is the photograph Richard saw hanging at the hotel. After the play, Richard receives a message from Robinson requesting a meeting. Robinson wants him to leave Elise, saying it is for her own good. When Richard declares his intention to stand by Elise for the rest of her life, Robinson has him bound and locked inside the stables. He then tells Elise that Richard has left. Richard wakes the next morning and frees himself. The acting troupe has left for Denver, but Elise has stayed behind to find him. They go to her room and have sex. They agree to marry, and Elise promises to buy Richard a new suit, as his is out of style. Inside one of the suit pockets, Richard discovers a penny with a 1979 mint date. This modern item breaks the hypnotic suggestion, pulling Richard into the present.

He awakens in 1980, physically weakened by the time travel. His attempts to return to 1912 are unsuccessful. After despondently wandering the hotel grounds for weeks, he dies of a broken heart, and his spirit joins Elise in the afterlife.

Richard Matheson, who wrote the original novel and screenplay, appears in a cameo role as a 1912 hotel guest. He is astonished by Richard&#x27;s having cut himself shaving with a straight razor. Richard Matheson&#x27;s daughter, Ali, is similarly credited as a student.

George Wendt is credited as a student during this same scene, but his appearance was cut from the film during editing.

==Reception==
Although the film was well received during its previews, it was derided by critics upon release and underperformed at the box office.

In a TCM interview, Jane Seymour stated: &quot;Well, what happened is we finished the movie and we weren&#x27;t allowed to publicize it. The Screen Actors Guild had a strike, and Chris and I were not allowed to tell anyone about the movie and its time to come out. Plus, Universal spent, was it two million or three something, very minimal on this movie. And they had a thing called &quot;The Blues Brothers&quot;, they were very worried about getting their investment back on, so they ignored us completely. So literally they hid this movie, literally hid it, and I remember we got the worst reviews ever.&quot;

===Critical response===
Film review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reports that 52% of 21 film critics have given the film a positive review; the rating average is 5.9 out of 10. Metacritic, which assigns a weighted average score out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, gives the film a score of 29 based on 7 reviews, signifying &quot;Generally unfavorable reviews&quot;.

===Accolades===
&quot;Somewhere in Time&quot; received several awards, including Saturn Awards for Best Costume, Best Music, and Best Fantasy Film. The film was also nominated for the Academy Award for Best Costume Design (Jean-Pierre Dorleac).

The film is recognized by the American Film Institute in these lists:
* 2002: AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Passions – Nominated
* 2005: AFI&#x27;s 100 Years of Film Scores – Nominated

===Soundtrack===
The film&#x27;s original musical score was composed and conducted by John Barry, who was suggested by Jane Seymour, a personal friend. The producers had been considering a score based on the 18th variation of Sergei Rachmaninoff&#x27;s &quot;Rhapsody on a Theme of Paganini,&quot; which is used in the film several times.

The film was not a success at the box office and a very limited run above promotional copies of the album was pressed with very limited circulation. Universal Pictures used &quot;Somewhere in Time&quot; as a test bed for soundtrack sales and did not expect it to do well at all. It was cable television the following spring where the film garnered a huge fan audience and interest in the music was tremendous. So many requests were made at record stores across the country that Universal pressed 500,000 more copies and the soundtrack, now into several pressings, still sells well on compact disc. The music became one of the most requested at weddings for a decade after the film&#x27;s release. 

Barry wrote the score at a creative and prolific time in his career, scoring the music for films such as &quot;Raise the Titanic&quot;, &quot;High Road to China&quot;, and the highly acclaimed &quot;Body Heat&quot;, all within an 18-month period. However, the score for &quot;Somewhere in Time&quot; is considered to be among the best of his career. The music from the film is often credited for much of its success by invoking a deeply emotional pull for the viewers. In the years since the film&#x27;s release, the music has become as famous as the film, if not more so, with many hearing it and then seeking the film on video. 

Bruce Handy for &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; described the development of Barry’s scoring style after moving to Hollywood in 1975 as &quot;the liquid orchestral style that would be epitomized by his music for &quot;Somewhere in Time,&quot; a 1979 time-travel romance starring Christopher Reeve and Jane Seymour.&quot;

The music has been released on two albums, neither of which are from the original sessions from the film itself. Like most soundtracks of the time, the album was a series of re-recordings with highlights of the score recorded to fit onto two sides of an LP. The original release from MCA Records has nine tracks.

===Legacy===

Despite reviews calling the film &quot;horrible&quot; and a &quot;superficial tear jerker&quot;, the International Network of Somewhere In Time Enthusiasts (I.N.S.I.T.E.), an official fan club, was formed in 1990 and continues to meet regularly. During the month of October, the Grand Hotel hosts a &quot;Somewhere in Time&quot; Weekend, with events such as a large-screen viewing of the film, panel discussions with some of the film&#x27;s principals and crew, and a costume ball of members dressed in Edwardian attire.

The film was mentioned by characters as an example of popular culture time travel in the film &quot;&quot; (2019).

Ken Davenport produced a theatrical adaptation of the story with assistance from Matheson on the story book. The adaptation received New York workshops and a full production at Portland Center Stage.

The film was particularly well received in the then British Hong Kong. It was screened exclusively at the in Causeway Bay, the most luxurious cinema in Hong Kong at that time, starting from September 12, 1981. Due to its excellent reputation and box office, it continued to be screened at the Palace Theatre until April 22, 1982, with a total of 223 days. This set the record for the longest continuous screening of a film in Hong Kong at that time, and it also kept the theatre itself full for three consecutive months. In the end, the film earned HKD 9.38 million at the box office, making it the highest-grossing international film of the year 1982 in Hong Kong. Due to the popularity of the film, Hong Kong singer Adam Cheng recorded a Cantopop cover version (如在夢中; lit. &quot;Like in a Dream&quot;) that was adapted from the theme music of the film in 1982, and the song was included in Cheng&#x27;s album &quot;&quot;.

<doc id="920300" wikidata="Q711568" url="?curid=920300" title="Arthur Somers-Cocks, 6th Baron Somers">
<text>Arthur Herbert Tennyson Somers-Cocks, 6th Baron Somers, (20 March 1887 – 14 July 1944), was a British Army officer who was the 16th Governor of Victoria, from 1926 to 1931 and Administrator of Australia in 1930–31. He had a long involvement with the Boy Scout Movement and became the Boy Scouts Association&#x27;s Chief Scout of the British Empire from 1942 until his death.

==Early life==
Somers was born in Freshwater, Isle of Wight, the eldest son of Herbert Haldane Somers-Cocks and the former Blanche Clogstoun. His godfather was Alfred, Lord Tennyson. Somers&#x27; father died when he was seven years old. He succeeded a distant relative as Baron Somers at the age of twelve. He attended Charterhouse School before going on to New College, Oxford. He was an able cricketer, and played 17 first-class games. In 1904, whilst a schoolboy at Charterhouse, he made 115 against Westminster, and two years later he made his first-class debut for Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) against Worcestershire, scoring 0 and 13. He rarely had enough time to play cricket, but in the 1920s he made a further 16 first-class appearances &quot;for&quot; Worcestershire, his highest score being 52 against Essex in May 1925. In later life he became both a vice-president of Worcestershire County Cricket Club and, in 1936, President of the MCC.

==Military career==
In 1906, Somers joined the British Army 1st Regiment of Life Guards, later taking leave to farm in Canada before rejoining his regiment in 1914 at the start of the First World War. He commanded the 6th Battalion of the new Tank Corps in 1918. He was twice wounded, mentioned in despatches, awarded the Military Cross, the Distinguished Service Order, and appointed to the French Legion of Honour.

==Governor of Victoria and Administrator of Australia==
Somers was appointed Governor of Victoria in 1926. He &quot;had charm and natural gaiety which won him popularity ... warm and generous, he had a genuine interest in people, as well as a high sense of duty and leadership ... a shrewd and successful governor&quot;. Following the expiry of Lord Stonehaven&#x27;s term as Governor-General of Australia in October 1930, Somers – as the longest serving state governor – was called upon to act as Administrator of Australia until Sir Isaac Isaacs took office in January 1931.

==Freemasonry==
Somers was initiated as a Freemason into Household Brigade Lodge No.2614 under the United Grand Lodge of England some 18 years before he arrived in Victoria and served as the Grand Master of the United Grand Lodge of Victoria between 1927 and 1932.

==Lord Somers Camp==
In 1929, at his own expense, Somers brought together teenage boys from different backgrounds in Australia to what was named Lord Somers Camp which continues to this day. The idea of the camp was based upon the Duke of York&#x27;s camps in England that operated from 1921 until the start of the Second World War.

==Scouting==
With the governor-generalship came the honorary position of State Chief Scout of Victoria. Somers was determined to make the role more than a ceremonial one and enthusiastically participated in Scout camps and hikes, insisting on pitching his own tent. He wore Scout uniform at these events and personally led a series of Christmas hikes in the state. In 1931, the founder of Scouting and Chief Scout of the World, Lord Baden-Powell, met Somers during a tour of Australia and was impressed by his commitment to Scouting.

On Somers&#x27; return to Britain, The Boy Scouts Association appointed Somers as its Chief Commissioner in 1932 and then its deputy Chief Scout from 1935 to 1941. Baden-Powell designated Somers as his successor as the association&#x27;s Chief Scout. Following Baden-Powell&#x27;s death, the Boy Scouts Association appointed Somers as its Chief Scout of the British Empire in March 1941 until his death in 1944. During his tenure as Deputy, Somers led the British contingent to the 5th World Scout Jamboree at Vogelenzang in the Netherlands. As Chief Scout, Somers wore his Scout uniform to debates in the House of Lords. In 1941 Somers established a Post War Commission to examine reforms to Scouting that could be implemented once peace had been restored. He also proposed the construction of an international Scout hostel in London as a memorial to the founder, which eventually resulted in the opening of Baden-Powell House in Kensington.

==Other appointments==
Somers was appointed Lord Lieutenant of Herefordshire in 1933. From 1940, he was the Red Cross Commissioner for Egypt.

==Family==
Somers married Daisy Finola Meeking in 1921 and had a daughter:
* Elizabeth Violet Virginia Somers Cocks (1922–1986), who married Major Benjamin Alexander Frederick Hervey-Bathurst (1920–1997), 2nd son of Sir Frederick Edward William Hervey-Bathurst, 5th Baronet.

==Death==
During the early 1940s, Somers had been increasingly debilitated by throat cancer. He died at Eastnor Castle on 14 July 1944 and was cremated. A memorial service for him was held at St George&#x27;s Chapel, Windsor Castle.

<text>The Minister of Democratic Institutions () is a Minister of the Crown in the Canadian Cabinet, associated with the Privy Council Office. The position was first created in 2003 as &quot;Minister responsible for Democratic Reform&quot;. It was also titled &quot;Minister responsible for Democratic Renewal&quot; and &quot;Minister of State (Democratic Reform)&quot; during various governments. The position was abolished on November 20, 2019 but reestablished on December 20, 2024.

== History ==
=== Under Martin (2003–2006)===
The position was created by Prime Minister Paul Martin when he succeeded Jean Chrétien in December 2003 under the title &quot;Minister responsible for Democratic Reform&quot; to address the &quot;democratic deficit&quot;, an issue Martin campaigned on when he ran for leader of the Liberal Party of Canada.

The portfolio was initially held by the Government House Leader, Jacques Saada, in Martin&#x27;s first cabinet. After the 2004 election, the portfolio was given to Mauril Bélanger, who was the deputy government house leader.

When Belinda Stronach crossed the floor from the Conservative Party to Liberals on May 17, 2005, she assumed responsibilities for the portfolio along with the post of Minister of Human Resources and Skills Development. At this point the title was changed from &quot;Democratic Reform&quot; to &quot;Democratic &quot;Renewal&quot;&quot;.

=== Under Harper (2006–2015) ===
Under the premiership of Stephen Harper, the post was first held by his first two House Leaders (Rob Nicholson and Peter Van Loan) as &quot;Leader of the House of Commons and Minister for Democratic Reform&quot;. In 2008, the role was taken up by Steven Fletcher as &quot;Minister of State (Democratic Reform)&quot; and the same title was subsequently held by Tim Uppal and Pierre Poilievre.

=== Under Trudeau (2015–2019) ===
In the ministry of Justin Trudeau, who was elected on campaign promises of electoral reform, the portfolio was assigned to Maryam Monsef in November 2015, under the new title &quot;Minister of Democratic Institutions&quot;.

In the mandate letter provided to Monsef by Trudeau, she has been instructed to table an action plan outlining proposals to reform the operations of the House of Commons of Canada in order to increase the role of individual Members of Parliament in the House and its committees. Proposals include allowing more free votes, giving committees more authority, increase research budgets, allowing chairs of house committees to be elected rather than appointed by the prime minister, giving MPs a role in choosing which committees they sit on rather than having them assigned by the prime minister or government house leader. She oversaw the formation of the all-party Special Committee on Electoral Reform and appeared as its first witness.

Following criticism of her handling of the portfolio, Monsef was named Minister of Status of Women on February 1, 2017 and Karina Gould was appointed in her place. On February 1, 2017, Gould announced that her mandate would no longer include exploring potential changes to the Canadian electoral system.

On November 20, 2019, as part of Trudeau&#x27;s Cabinet shuffle following the 2019 Canadian federal election, the Democratic Institutions portfolio was abolished. Joan Bryden of the Canadian Press reported that the position&#x27;s responsibilities would be transferred to Dominic LeBlanc in his role as President of the Queen&#x27;s Privy Council for Canada.

<doc id="920306" wikidata="Q1093944" url="?curid=920306" title="San Francisco City Hall">
<text>San Francisco City Hall is the seat of government for the City and County of San Francisco, California. Re-opened in 1915 in its open space area in the city&#x27;s Civic Center, it is a Beaux-Arts monument to the City Beautiful movement that epitomized the high-minded American Renaissance of the 1880s to 1917. The structure&#x27;s dome is taller than that of the United States Capitol by . The present building replaced an earlier City Hall that was destroyed during the 1906 earthquake, which was two blocks from the present one.

The principal architect was Arthur Brown, Jr., of Bakewell &amp; Brown, whose attention to the finishing details extended to the doorknobs and the typeface to be used in signage. Brown also designed the San Francisco War Memorial Opera House, Veterans Building, Temple Emanuel, Coit Tower and the Federal office building at 50 United Nations Plaza.

==Architecture==

The building&#x27;s vast open space is more than and occupies two full city blocks. It is between Van Ness Avenue and Polk Street, and between Grove and McAllister Streets. Its dome, which owes much to Mansart&#x27;s Baroque domes of the Val-de-Grâce (church) and Les Invalides in Paris, rises above the Civic Center Historic District. It is higher than the United States Capitol, and has a diameter of , resting upon 4 x 50 ton (44.5 metric ton) and 4 x 20 ton (17.8 metric ton) girders, each deep and long.

The building as a whole contains 7,900 tons (7,035 metric tons) of structural steel from the American Bridge Company of Ambridge, Pennsylvania near Pittsburgh. It is faced with Madera County granite on the exterior, and Indiana sandstone within, together with finish marbles from Alabama, Colorado, Vermont, and Italy. Much of the statuary is by Henri Crenier.

The upper levels of the Rotunda are public and handicapped accessible. Opposite the grand staircase, on the second floor, is the office of the Mayor. Bronze busts of former Mayor George Moscone and his successor, Dianne Feinstein, stand nearby as tacit reminders of the Moscone assassination, which took place just a few yards from that spot in the smaller rotunda of the mayor&#x27;s office entrance. A bust of former county supervisor Harvey Milk, who was assassinated in the building was unveiled on May 22, 2008. The inscription that dominates the grand Rotunda and the entrance to the mayor&#x27;s small rotunda, right below Father Time, reads:

&lt;poem&gt;SAN • FRANCISCO
O • GLORIOVS • CITY • OF • OVR
HEARTS • THAT • HAST • BEEN
TRIED • AND • NOT • FOVND
WANTING • GO • THOV • WITH
LIKE • SPIRIT • TO • MAKE
THE • FVTVRE • THINE
1912 JAMES ROLPH JR. MAYOR 1931&lt;/poem&gt;

The words were written by the previous Mayor Edward Robeson Taylor, and dedicated by Mayor James Rolph.

While plaques at the Mall entrance memorialize President George Washington&#x27;s farewell address and President Abraham Lincoln&#x27;s Gettysburg Address, the primary themes of the statuary are to the past mayors, with the dates of their terms in office. The medallions in the vaults of the Rotunda are of &quot;Equality&quot;, &quot;Liberty&quot;, &quot;Strength&quot;, &quot;Learning&quot; and, as memorialized in the South Light Court display, &quot;Progress&quot;.

==History==

From 1849 to 1850, San Francisco&#x27;s municipal government was on the west side of Portsmouth Square at the Office of the Alcalde, who was the municipal magistrate, with both judicial and administrative functions, and the ayuntamiento, the town council, or cabildo.

In May 1850, after the first City Charter was adopted, the first San Francisco City Hall was established at the former luxury hotel Graham House on the corner of Kearny and Pacific streets, which was later consumed by the great fire of June 1851. In 1852, San Francisco City Hall was at 750 Kearny Street between Washington and Merchant Streets,&lt;ref name=&quot;ohp.parks.ca.gov/21482&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; at the converted Jenny Lind Theatre building and Parker House, located then between the El Dorado Hotel and &quot;The Union&quot;, opposite the east side of Portsmouth Square. Later, this was the site of a Hall of Justice, as seen on the TV series, &quot;Ironside&quot;.
The 1916 City Hall building is a replacement for the 1899 building, begun in 1871, which was designed by Augustus Laver and Thomas Stent and completed in 1899 after 27 years of planning and construction. The 1899 city hall was a much larger building which also contained a smaller extension which contained the city&#x27;s Hall of Records. It was bounded by Larkin Street, McAllister Street, and City Hall Avenue (a street, now built over, which ran from the corner of Grove and Larkin to the corner of McAllister and Leavenworth), largely where the current public library and U.N. Plaza stand today. Noted city planner and architect Daniel Burnham published a plan in 1905 to redesign the city, including a new Civic Center complex around City Hall, but the plans were shelved in the wake of the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, which destroyed the 1899 City Hall.
Reconstruction plans following the earthquake for the Civic Center complex called for a neo-classical design as part of the city beautiful movement, as well as a desire to rebuild the city in time for the 1915 Panama–Pacific International Exposition. A bond was authorized for $8.8 million on March 28, 1912, of which the new City Hall was budgeted for $3.5 million to $4 million. After Arthur Brown Junior&#x27;s design was selected from the competition, construction started in 1913 and was completed by 1915, in time for the Exposition.
Ground was broken for the 1916 City Hall at Van Ness and Fulton on April 5, 1913, and the cornerstone was laid on October 25 of that year. Mayor Rolph moved into City Hall on December 28, 1915, the final stone was laid on March 31, 1916, and scaffolding was finally removed on July 28, officially marking the end of construction. The ruins of the old City Hall were sold shortly thereafter in August 1916 for , with removal to be completed within 40 days.

The main rotunda served as the site where many prominent politicians and public servants were laid in state. General Fredrick Funston, hero of the Spanish–American War, Philippine–American War, and the 1906 earthquake laid there in 1917. President Warren G. Harding laid here in 1923. Former mayor and governor James Rolph was laid in state in City Hall following his death in 1934.

Joe DiMaggio and Marilyn Monroe were married at City Hall in January 1954.

In May 1960, the main Rotunda was a site of a student protest against the House Un-American Activities Committee and a countering police action whereby students from UC Berkeley, Stanford, and other local colleges were fire hosed down the steps beneath the rotunda. This event was memorialized by students during the Free Speech Movement at UC Berkeley four years later.

On November 27, 1978, former Supervisor Dan White assassinated Mayor George Moscone and Supervisor Harvey Milk inside of City Hall.

The Loma Prieta earthquake of 1989 damaged the structure, and twisted the dome four inches (102 mm) on its base. Afterward, under the leadership of the San Francisco Bureau of Architecture in collaboration with Carey &amp; Co. preservation architects, and Forell/Elsesser Engineers, work was completed to render the building earthquake resistant through a base isolation system, which would likely prevent total collapse of the building. City Hall reopened after its seismic upgrade in January 1999, and was the world&#x27;s largest base-isolated structure at that time.

Prior to the retrofitting, the San Francisco County Superior Court’s civil courtrooms were located in City Hall but have been located across the street at the 400 McAllister courthouse since it opened in 1997.

The original grand plaza has undergone several extensive renovations, with radical changes in its appearance and utility. Prior to the 1960s there were extensive brick plazas, few trees, and a few large, simple, raised, and circular ponds with central fountains, all in a style that discouraged loitering. The plaza was then extensively excavated for underground parking. At this time a central rectangular pond, with an extensive array of water vents (strangely, all in several strict rows and all pointing east, with identical arcs of water, and completely without sculptural embellishment), was added, with extensive groves of trees (again, in 60s modernist style, planted with absolute military precision on rectangular grids). In the 1990s, with the rise of the problem of homelessness, the plaza was once again remodeled to make it somewhat less habitable—although the most significant change, the replacement of the pond and pumps with a lawn, could be reasonably justified on the basis of energy and water conservation.
The building features color changeable LED lighting at the outside of the Rotunda, and between the exterior columns. The colors change to coincide with different events happening in the city and elsewhere.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, City Hall was closed from March 2020 until reopening on June 7, 2021.

<doc id="920311" wikidata="Q5147104" url="?curid=920311" title="Collett E. Woolman">
<text>Collett Everman Woolman (October 8, 1889 – September 11, 1966), commonly known as &quot;Wooly&quot; to his employees, was an American airline entrepreneur best known as the founder of Delta Air Lines.

==Biography==
Woolman was born in Bloomington, Indiana, but grew up in Urbana, Illinois, where he attended high school. Between college semesters in 1909, Woolman attended the world&#x27;s first aviation meet in Rheims, France, where his passion for aviation began. He graduated from the University of Illinois, where he received a Bachelor of Arts in agriculture. Woolman married Helen H. Fairfield in 1916 with whom he had two daughters. By 1920, they had moved to Monroe in northeastern Louisiana.

===Early career===
Shortly after graduating from college, Woolman became an Agricultural Extension Agent at Louisiana State University. At the time, the Southern United States was battling a cotton-destroying pest, the boll weevil. Woolman observed the work of entomologist B.R. Coad, at the United States Department of Agriculture lab in Tallulah, Louisiana. Coad and his team used airplanes and pilots on loan from the Army to develop improved methods of applying calcium arsenate to rid cotton plants of boll weevils. Huff-Daland Aero Corporation, an aircraft manufacturer, took notice of their experiments and decided to form a new subsidiary for crop dusting, founded on March 2, 1925 in Macon, Georgia. In May 1925, Woolman joined the new division, called Huff Daland Dusters, as chief entomologist responsible for selling this experimental service. That summer, the headquarters were moved to Monroe, Louisiana, and their fleet grew to 18 crop dusters, the largest private aircraft fleet at the time. 

The need for crop dusting dramatically decreased when the summer growing season ended. To compensate, Woolman expanded dusting operations in early 1927 to Peru where the seasons are reversed from the U.S. While in Peru, Woolman began passenger air service in 1928, utilizing a unique agreement with Peruvian Airways Corporation. Although the arrangement did not last long, Woolman took the experience back to Louisiana.

===Delta Air Service===
Back in Monroe, the parent company, now known as Keystone Aircraft Corp. was seeking to sell off its subsidiary. Woolman and banker Travis Oliver led local investors to purchase Huff Daland Dusters assets. The new company was incorporated as Delta Air Service on December 3, 1928, named after the Mississippi Delta region it served. Woolman was vice president and general manager. 

Passenger service began on June 17, 1929, from Dallas, Texas, to Jackson, Mississippi, with stops at Shreveport and Monroe, Louisiana. By June 1930, service had expanded east to Atlanta and west to Fort Worth, Texas. 

Passenger operations ceased in October 1930 when the airmail contract for the route Delta had pioneered was awarded to another airline, which purchased the assets of Delta Air Service.

===Delta Air Corporation===
Local banker Travis Oliver (acting as trustee), Woolman, and other local investors purchased back the crop-dusting assets of Delta Air Service and incorporated as Delta Air Corporation on December 31, 1930. Woolman was a member of the board of directors for Delta Air Service, and again when Delta Air Corporation formed its board in 1930. Delta secured an airmail contract and returned to airline operations in 1934 doing business as Delta Air Lines over Mail Route 24, stretching from Fort Worth, Texas, to Charleston, South Carolina. 

===Delta Air Lines===
The company name officially changed to Delta Air Lines in 1945. Although Delta kept a crop-dusting division until 1966, by 1938 expanding airmail and passenger service operations began earning more than crop-dusting profits. 

Over the next several decades, Woolman led Delta as general manager, becoming president in 1945. He was named Delta&#x27;s chairman and chief executive officer on November 1, 1965, and remained in those roles until his death. Woolman died on September 11, 1966, in Houston, a month before his 77th birthday.

==Legacy==
A retired Delta pilot recalled one encounter with Woolman:
One additional gentleman and his wife were traveling in first class - with a stop in while I was a brand new Flight Engineer on a DC-7. After landing in CLT, the agent came and told the Captain that we were oversold and he had to take one passenger off. The gentleman standing in the cockpit talking with us told the agent that he would give up his seat and take the early flight out the next morning to DCA. After leaving the cockpit and going back to tell his wife, he got off and stood by the gate (chain link fence actually). After starting those big old Wright 3350&#x27;s I leaned forward and looked out of the Captain&#x27;s window to see Mr. C. E. Woolman, Principal Founder and President of Delta Air Lines, standing there waving goodbye to us.

Following his death, several memorials have been made in his honor. A reconditioned 1925 Huff Daland Duster was presented to the Smithsonian Institution by employees of Delta. Another memorial sits at the entrance to Delta&#x27;s Technical Operations Center in Atlanta. In 1992, Woolman was inducted into the Georgia Aviation Hall of Fame. In 1994, he was enshrined in the National Aviation Hall of Fame.

<doc id="920316" wikidata="Q7380323" url="?curid=920316" title="Rupert Lowe">
<text>Rupert James Graham Lowe (born 31 October 1957) is a British Reform UK politician and businessman, who has served as Member of Parliament (MP) for Great Yarmouth since 2024. He has served as Reform UK&#x27;s Business and Agriculture spokesman since 2023. He previously served as a Brexit Party Member of the European Parliament (MEP) for the West Midlands from 2019 to 2020.

Lowe was chairman of Southampton Football Club from 1996 to 2006 and then again from 2008 to 2009, when the company was placed into administration.

== Early life and career ==
Lowe was born on 31 October 1957 in Oxford, Oxfordshire, England. He was educated at Radley College, an all-boys independent boarding school, and the University of Reading. He then worked in the City of London for companies such as Morgan Grenfell, Deutsche Bank and Barings Bank where he worked with rogue trader Nick Leeson. He was also a board member of the London International Financial Futures Exchange. He founded Secure Retirements, a quoted care home provider, with Andrew Cowen, later the Southampton F.C. Vice-Chairman.

== Football career ==

=== Southampton Football Club ===
In the mid-1990s, the Southampton F.C. board were looking to float the club on the London Stock Exchange, a long and costly procedure. Therefore, they attempted a reverse takeover as a way to reduce costs. They needed to find a company that had already floated and take it over while effectively being taken over themselves. Lowe&#x27;s Secure Retirements, which ran nursing homes, was identified as a candidate. The resultant group was renamed Southampton Leisure Holdings PLC. After the deal was completed, Lowe became chairman of the football club.

In the summer of 1997, manager Graeme Souness left after just one season in charge, as did director of football and former manager Lawrie McMenemy. This came as a shock to many fans and to the local press, who regarded McMenemy as &#x27;Mr. Southampton&#x27;; he had previous managed the club from 1973 to 1985, guiding it to FA Cup success in 1976 and finishing second in the league in 1984.

Lowe guided the club from their old stadium into the 32,000-seater St Mary&#x27;s Stadium, which opened in 2001, and the club continued to follow a long-standing policy of selling players to clubs for high prices. Players such as Dean Richards and Kevin Davies were sold to Tottenham Hotspur for £8 million and Blackburn Rovers for £7 million respectively.

During his ownership of the club, the Saints maintained their Premier League status into the 21st century, despite having been in regular relegation battles since the early 1990s and rarely finishing in the top half of the table.

There were eight managers during his tenure. Dave Jones was forced out in January 2000 when faced with a criminal investigation, although he was later exonerated of all charges. Jones was succeeded by Glenn Hoddle, who left just over a year later to join Tottenham Hotspur. Lowe then appointed a talented coach, Stuart Gray, but Gray was swiftly replaced by Gordon Strachan after a poor start to the 2001–02 season. Strachan guided the Saints to a secure 11th-place finish.

In 2003, Saints reached the FA Cup Final and qualified for the UEFA Cup for the first time in nearly 20 years, also finishing eighth in the league – their highest finish for well over a decade. Gordon Strachan resigned in March 2004, and Lowe and the board took the decision to replace him with Paul Sturrock before the end of the season. Sturrock himself left the club by &quot;mutual consent&quot; within six months, despite achieving good results during his time in charge. It was alleged that Lowe attempted to interfere in team selection after consulting the former head coach of the England national rugby union team Sir Clive Woodward, who was being approached about a possible role at the club at the time.

Lowe appointed Harry Redknapp manager of Southampton in December 2004. Redknapp had quit as manager of Southampton&#x27;s south-coast rivals Portsmouth two weeks earlier. Southampton were relegated in 2005 and Lowe appointed Clive Woodward as the Director of Football of Southampton in July 2005. Redknapp resigned as manager in December 2005 and subsequently rejoined Portsmouth.

Lowe won a libel case against &quot;The Times&quot; in 2005 regarding a column by the sportswriter Martin Samuel that alleged that Lowe had treated Jones &quot;shabbily&quot; following the latter&#x27;s suspension after he was accused of child abuse charges on which he was subsequently acquitted. Lowe was awarded £250,000, which he pledged to donate to charity.

On 30 June 2006, Lowe resigned under huge pressure from club supporters, including the newly formed Saints Trust, following the club&#x27;s failure to win promotion back to the Premiership. Michael Wilde, a new investor in Southampton Leisure Holdings PLC, led a new team of directors in taking over the club. The Saints were beaten in the 2006–07 Championship playoffs, and failed to mount a promotion challenge the following season.

In July 2008, Lowe returned as Southampton Leisure Holdings plc chairman. At an AGM on 23 December 2008, he received several calls to resign from former chairman Leon Crouch and from fans and shareholders at the meeting. Also, thirty silver coins were thrown in his direction by fan Richard Chorley, who was thrown out of the meeting. After Lowe&#x27;s return, protests took place against his role at the club.

On 2 April 2009, Southampton Leisure Holdings PLC was put into administration, resulting in Lowe&#x27;s resignation from the board. The club was relegated to League One shortly afterwards, but under its new owners reached the Premier League just three years afterwards.

===Garforth Town===
In December 2012, Lowe purchased Garforth Town of the Northern Premier League, along with the franchise operation of Socatots &amp; Brazilian Soccer Schools linking up again with Simon Clifford, who had been employed as a Southampton coach in 2005. Lowe left the club in January 2015.

=== Football Association ===
Lowe has served as a member of the executive board of The Football Association as a Premier League representative and as an FA Councillor and on the FA Cup committee.

==Political career==
Lowe stood for election as the Referendum Party candidate for The Cotswolds in the 1997 general election. He won a seat for the Brexit Party in the West Midlands constituency in the 2019 European Parliament elections. He had planned to be the Brexit Party Prospective Parliamentary Candidate for the Dudley North constituency of the UK Parliament but withdrew. In 2020, he denied the scientific consensus on man-made climate change in the European Parliament, calling it a &quot;cult&quot; which &quot;marches on with no definitive evidence to support or deny the factual accuracy of [climate scientists&#x27;] assertions&quot;.

In March 2023, Lowe returned to politics as Reform UK&#x27;s Business and Agriculture Spokesman. He contested the 2024 Kingswood by-election, finishing in third place, surpassing 10% and achieving Reform&#x27;s best-ever by-election result. This was bettered later the same day by Ben Habib&#x27;s 13% of the vote in the Wellingborough by-election.

In the July 2024 general election, he stood for the Great Yarmouth constituency and won, gaining 35.3% of the vote. After his election, he compiled a list of schools in his constituency where he claimed that teachers had a bias against Reform UK during the election campaign, saying he would be meeting with headteachers to discuss the allegations. He also pledged to donate his MP salary to a different local charity or worthy cause each month.

Lowe regards Oliver Cromwell as his hero as he was &quot;a great guy, a great leader – he stood up for what he believed in&quot;.

In January 2025, American billionaire Elon Musk, who had endorsed Reform UK, called on Nigel Farage to resign as leader, and then praised Lowe. Lowe thanked Musk, but reiterated his support for Farage. The dispute between Musk and Farage stemmed from Musk&#x27;s endorsement of imprisoned far-right activist Tommy Robinson, who Farage has rejected; Lowe said Robinson should be acknowledged for &quot;exposing these [child rape] gangs&quot; but called him &quot;not right for Reform&quot;.

In January 2025, Lowe voted along with other Reform UK MPs to block the Children’s Wellbeing and Schools Bill with a motion that called for a new national inquiry into grooming gangs. The bill was lost at 364 votes to 111, a majority of 253 against the amendment.

===Opposition to all government borrowing===
On 8 January 2025 Lowe brought in a Ten Minute Rule Bill to ban quantitative easing, praising Argentinian president Javier Milei and looking forward to Elon Musk working with Donald Trump, before saying &quot;The cost of government should be covered by taxes alone, limiting the growth of excessive statism&quot; which he said was linked to &quot;a general moral decline in society&quot;.

== Personal life==
Rupert Lowe is a multi-millionaire. He is married to Nicky Lowe and they have four children.

Lowe owns Ravenswell Farm in Withington, near Cheltenham in Gloucestershire. The operations of racehorse trainer Fergal O&#x27;Brien are based at the farm.

==Later career==
In February 2018, Lowe was one of several people who received undisclosed damages payouts from Mirror Group Newspapers as part of the phone hacking scandal.

Lowe was appointed a Director of Rutherford Health plc in 2018 and Digme Fitness in 2017.

<text>The Aer Lualdi L.59 was an Italian helicopter that failed to reach quantity production.

==Design==
The L.59 was the culmination of work done by Carlo Lualdi throughout the 1950s, and was an enlarged version of his earlier two-seat designs. The L.59 featured four seats accommodated in an extensively glazed cabin. Of conventional pod-and-boom design with skid landing gear, the aircraft had the slightly unusual feature of having its engine mounted in the nose, turning the main rotor by a long driveshaft that reached through the cabin.

==Production and operation==
Lualdi was able to interest Macchi in the design and two Macchi-built prototypes began flight tests in 1960. Civil certification was achieved in August the following year. Although faultless, the performance of the L.59 was not comparable with that of other helicopters on the market at the time. Macchi planned an initial production batch of 50 machines, but only a single example was sold - one of the prototypes was purchased by the Italian Army for evaluation purposes. No order resulted. The prototype was exhibited at the 1963 Paris Air Show, but again, no orders were obtained for the type.

==Surviving aircraft==
An Aer Lualdi L.59 wearing the Italian military serial &quot;MM576&quot; is preserved in the &quot;Centro Polifunziale Ferruccio Lamborghini&quot; at Dosso near Ferrara.

<text>John Hutton Balfour (15 September 1808 – 11 February 1884) was a Scottish botanist. Balfour became a Professor of Botany, first at the University of Glasgow in 1841, moving to the University of Edinburgh and also becoming the 7th Regius Keeper of the Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh and Her Majesty&#x27;s Botanist in 1845. He held these posts until his retirement in 1879. He was nicknamed Woody Fibre.

==Early life==
He was the son of Andrew Balfour, an Army Surgeon who had returned to Edinburgh to set up a printing and publishing business.

Balfour was educated at the Royal High School in Edinburgh and then studied at St Andrews University and the University of Edinburgh, graduating with degrees of M.A. and then M.D., the latter in 1832. In Edinburgh, he became a notable member of the Plinian Society, where he encountered the phrenologist William A.F. Browne and entered the vigorous debates concerning natural history and theology. His original intention had been to seek ordination in the Church of Scotland but instead he started medical practice in Edinburgh in 1834 after studying abroad.

In 1834 Balfour was elected a member of the Harveian Society of Edinburgh and served as President in 1852. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in January 1835, aged only 26. He was one of their longest serving members. He was General Secretary 1860–1879 and Vice President 1881-3.

==Botany==
With an interest in botany, Balfour was prominent in the foundation of both the Botanical Society of Edinburgh in 1836 (serving as President in 1845–46) and the Edinburgh Botanical Club in 1838.

In 1841 he began giving lectures in Edinburgh&#x27;s extramural school on botany with some success. In 1842 he was appointed Professor of Botany at the University of Glasgow. In 1845, Balfour transferred to take the chair of Botany at the University of Edinburgh, a position he held until 1879. He was also nominated keeper of the Royal Botanic Garden in Edinburgh and Her Majesty&#x27;s Botanist. These appointments followed a protracted political struggle in which Balfour triumphed over his distinguished opponent, Joseph Dalton Hooker, a close associate of Charles Darwin. In 1846 he was elected a member of the Aesculapian Club.

Balfour served for many years as dean of the faculty of medicine in the University of Edinburgh and he was an enormously successful teacher of botany, lacing his scientific lectures with theological asides, as he remained profoundly wedded to natural theology. In January 1862, he corresponded with Charles Darwin on botanical matters, recollecting their evenings together at the Plinian Society with his brother-in-law William A.F. Browne. He also corresponded with the extraordinary and irascible botanist Hewett Cottrell Watson, an early phrenologist, evolutionist and advocate of the differential development of the human cerebral hemispheres.

Under Balfour&#x27;s care the Royal Botanic Garden was enlarged and improved and a palm-house, arboretum, and teaching accommodation were built. His publications include botanical text-books such as &quot;Manual of Botany&quot; (1848), &quot;Class Book of Botany&quot; (1852), &quot;Outlines of Botany&quot; (1854), &quot;Elements of Botany for Schools&quot; (1869), &quot;Botanist&#x27;s Companion&quot; (1860), &quot;Introduction to Palaeontological Botany&quot; (1872), and &quot;The Plants of Scripture&quot;. He also contributed to the article on botany in the 8th edition of &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot;. Balfour retired from his academic post in 1879. His son, Sir Isaac Bayley Balfour (1853–1922), became a distinguished botanist in his own right, serving as Sherardian Professor of Botany at Oxford University from 1884 to 1888, before returning to his father&#x27;s old Chair at Edinburgh.

California&#x27;s foxtail pine is named &quot;Pinus balfouriana&quot; Balf. after him.

==Later life==
From 1877 he lived in Inverleith House within the then newly extended Royal Botanic Gardens, Edinburgh in his role there as Regius Keeper.

He died in Inverleith House and was buried in Warriston Cemetery with his wife Marion Spottiswood Balfour. The grave lies on the north side of the main upper east-west path, towards its western end.

==Family==
He married Marion Spottiswood Bayley (1828–1879) on 8 August 1848. Their children were Ada Marion Spottiswood Balfour (1850–1918), Cpt. Andrew Francis Balfour RN (1851–1906), Isaac Bayley Balfour (1853–1922), Madeline Drummond Balfour (1854–1912), John Hutton Balfour Jr (1856–1919), George Goldie Balfour (1858–1914), Margaret Eliza Balfour (1860–1932) and Harriet Penuel Balfour (1863–1942).

Balfour&#x27;s sister, Magdelene Balfour, married William A. F. Browne (1805–1885), the phrenologist and asylum reformer.

Balfour was uncle to Sir Andrew Balfour specialist in tropical medicine who was the first Director of the London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine in 1923 and was a close friend of Sir Patrick Manson, founder of the School. According to Sir Andrew Balfour in a speech he made to the London Royal Free Hospital, School of Medicine for Women in 1928, John Hutton Balfour was often referred as &#x27;Woody Fibre&#x27;.

His great-great-granddaughter is actress Tilda Swinton.

<text>Tupaia (also spelled Tupaea or Tupia; 1725 – 20 December 1770) was a Tahitian Polynesian navigator and &quot;arioi&quot; (a kind of priest), originally from the island of Ra&#x27;iatea in the Pacific Islands group known to Europeans as the Society Islands. His remarkable navigational skills and Pacific geographical knowledge were to be utilised by Lt. James Cook, R.N. when he took him aboard HMS &quot;Endeavour&quot; as guide on its voyage of exploration to &quot;Terra Australis Incognita&quot;. Tupaia travelled with Cook to New Zealand, acting as the expedition&#x27;s navigator to the Polynesian Māori, and Australia. He died in December 1770 from a shipborne illness contracted when &quot;Endeavour&quot; was docked in Batavia for repairs ahead of its return journey to England.

==Early life==
Tupaia was born at Ha&#x27;amanino Harbour on Ra&#x27;iatea around 1725 and became a leading &quot;ariori&quot; priest for the Taputapuatea marae. Tupaia was trained in the &quot;fare-&#x27;ai-ra&#x27;a-&#x27;upu&quot;, or schools of learning, about the origin of the cosmos, genealogies, the calendar, proverbs and histories. He was also taught how to be a star navigator. His knowledge included island lists, including their size, reef and harbor locations, whether they were inhabited, and if so, the name of the chief and any food produced there. More importantly, his skills would include the bearing of each island, the time to get there, and the succession of stars and islands to follow to get there. These islands included the Society Islands, the Austral Islands, the Cook Islands, plus Samoa, Tonga, Tokelau and Rotuma.

Bora Bora warriors invaded Ra&#x27;iatea around 1763, wounding Tupaia and forcing him to flee to Tahiti, where he sought protection from the Papara chief Amo and his wife Purea. Tupaia soon became their advisor and high priest, and eventually Purea&#x27;s lover. Tupaia befriended Samuel Wallis during his observation of a solar eclipse, and then Joseph Banks during the 1769 Transit of Venus observed from Tahiti. After which, Tupaia &quot;attached himself to the British,&quot; according to Anne Salmond. Tupaia was also an artist, and ten watercolors of his survive.

== Joining &quot;Endeavour&quot; ==

Tupaia joined &quot;Endeavour&quot; in July 1769 when it passed his home island of Ra&#x27;iatea in the outward voyage from Plymouth. He was welcomed aboard at the insistence of Sir Joseph Banks, the Cook expedition&#x27;s official botanist, on the basis of his evident skill as a navigator and mapmaker: when asked for details of the region Tupaia drew a chart showing all 130 islands within a radius and was able to name 74 of them. Banks welcomed the Raiatean&#x27;s interest in travelling with &quot;Endeavour&quot; to England because of his usefulness for the ship as well as the envisaged conversation and amusement (possibly even genuine friendship according to Australian researcher Vanessa Smith). It was also hoped that he could be presented as an anthropological curiosity in England. As Cook at first refused to allow Tupaia to join the expedition for financial reasons, Banks agreed to be responsible for the Raiatean&#x27;s welfare and upkeep while on board.

==Expedition and Tupaia&#x27;s map==

As Cook intended to spend several weeks in the Society Islands before heading south, Tupaia assisted the expedition as an interlocutor and interpreter with local tribes. He also worked closely with Banks in compiling an account of Tahiti and its inhabitants. On August 15, 1769, Tupaia began to work on a Chart of the Pacific Ocean in collaboration with Cook, Banks, and several of Cook&#x27;s officers.

Older research summarized by Joan Druett assumed that Tupaia&#x27;s own voyaging experience was limited. It holds that Tupaia had navigated from Ra&#x27;iatea in short voyages to 13 islands shown on the resulting map. He had not visited western Polynesia, as since his grandfather&#x27;s time the extent of voyaging by Raiateans had diminished to the islands of eastern Polynesia. His grandfather and father had passed to Tupaia the knowledge as to the location of the major islands of western Polynesia and the navigation information necessary to voyage to Rotuma, Samoa and Tonga. It was also assumed that Cook was less pleased than Banks with Tupaia&#x27;s evident navigational skills, resolving instead to rely on his own exploration of the region.

More recent research challenged the view that Tupaia&#x27;s travels in the wider region were limited, and questioned Cook&#x27;s failing appreciation of Tupaia as misinterpretations of the source material. In an extended reading of Tupaia&#x27;s Map, Lars Eckstein and Anja Schwarz propose that Tupaia had detailed navigational knowledge which extended throughout the Polynesian triangle (with the probable exception of only New Zealand). The chart he drew for James Cook in August 1769 shows interconnected voyaging routes ranging from Rotuma west of Samoa, via Samoa and Tonga, the southern Cook Islands and the Austral Group, Mangareva and Pitcairn all the way to Rapa Nui. A second major composite route leads from Tahiti through the Tuamotu Group to the Marquesas Group and on to Oahu in Hawai&#x27;i. Tupaia invented a cartographic system for Cook and his men which located a northern bearing from any island he drew in the centre of his Chart (marked by the word &#x27;avatea&#x27;, this is &#x27;[the sun at] noon&#x27;). This allowed him to translate his own wayfinding knowledge for island-to-island voyages into the logic and terms of Cook&#x27;s compass. The Admiralty manuscript of James Cook&#x27;s journal indicates that Tupaia told Cook that he himself (or his ancestors) travelled to most islands drawn on the Chart excepting only Rotuma (north of Fiji) and Oahu in Hawai&#x27;i.

Tupaia accompanied Cook to New Zealand and was welcomed by some of the Māori as a tohunga (an expert). It seems that they presented him with a precious dog-skin cloak.
Many Maori people have tales including Tupaia and his lineage that remains in New Zealand today. The crew of &quot;Endeavour&quot; had developed a less favorable impression of their shipmate. One, midshipman Joseph Marra, recorded that:Toobia ... was a man of real genius, a priest of the first order, and an excellent artist: he was, however, by no means beloved by the &quot;Endeavour&quot;s crew, being looked upon as proud and austere, extorting homage, which the sailors who thought themselves degraded by bending to an Indian , were very unwilling to pay, and preferring complaints against them on the most trivial occasions.

Tupaia landed at Botany Bay, Australia, in late April 1770. Cook said of Tupaia, &quot;...by means of Tupaia...you would always get people to direct you from Island to Island and would be sure of meeting with a friendly resception and refreshments at every Island you came to.&quot;

== Death ==

Tupaia died on 20 December 1770. This date is confirmed in the muster records of &quot;Endeavour&quot;. Other dates are suggested by the journals of Joseph Banks and James Cook. Joseph Banks&#x27;s journal has an entry for 11 November, in which he wrote “We receivd the news of Tupias death”. However, Banks was ill for much of his time at Batavia, and wrote many entries later on, using incorrect dates. James Cook&#x27;s journal has an entry for 26 December, in which he wrote “we lost... Tupia”. However, this entry is a summary of several events that occurred during the stay in Batavia.

Tupaia died from either dysentery or malaria, both of which were present aboard &quot;Endeavour&quot; during its berthing for repairs in Batavia. Cook recorded his passing in his journal: &quot;He was a Shrewd, Sensible, Ingenious Man, but proud and obstinate which often made his situation on board both disagreeable to himself and those about him, and tended much to promote the deceases that put a period to his life.&quot;

==Legacy==
When Cook returned to New Zealand in 1773, the Maori approached his ship shouting &quot;Tupaia! Tupaia!&quot;. As Cook noted, &quot;...the Name of Tupia was at that time so popular among them that it would be no wonder if at this time it is known over the great part of New Zealand.&quot;

<text>Daniel Isom Sultan (December 9, 1885 – January 14, 1947) was an American general. Sultan was born in Oxford, Mississippi, and graduated from the United States Military Academy in 1907. He entered the United States Army Corps of Engineers and rose through the ranks, teaching engineering at West Point from 1912 to 1916, before travelling to the Philippines. He oversaw construction of fortifications on various islands, and eventually was in charge of all US Army fortification work in the Philippines. He then served on the War Department General Staff and the general staff of the American Expeditionary Forces until 1922. Sultan led the Nicaragua Canal Survey and commanded American troops in the country from 1929 to 1931, when he returned to the United States and wrote a report on the canal.

Sultan next was district engineer in Chicago, leading construction of the Great Lakes to Mississippi Waterway to July 1934. He was then involved in various commissions in Washington DC, and served as engineer commissioner of the District of Columbia. In late 1938, he took command of the 2d Regiment of Engineers, and eventually rose to lead the Hawaiian Division in early 1941. Sultan had various other commands during early World War II, including the 38th Infantry Division and VIII Corps. In 1943, he was made deputy commander of the China-Burma-India Theater, and assumed command of the Burma-India Theater in October 1944. In 1945, he was made Inspector General of the United States Army, and served in that position until his death in 1947. He was awarded the Distinguished Service Medal four times, the Legion of Merit, the Bronze Star Medal, and made a Companion of the Order of the Bath.

== Early life ==
Sultan was born on December 9, 1885, in Oxford, Mississippi, to a planter. After attending the University of Mississippi from 1901 to 1903, he attended the United States Military Academy from June 15, 1903, to June 14, 1907, becoming an All-American as a center in football. He graduated 9th in a class of 111.

== Early military service ==
He was commissioned a second lieutenant in the United States Army Corps of Engineers upon graduation, and served in the Third Battalion of Engineers at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, from September 14 to October 1, 1908. He then was stationed at the Washington Barracks from October 3, 1908, to August 24, 1912. While there, Sultan graduated from the Engineer School on February 23, 1910; was the secretary of school from September 7, 1909, to April 12, 1912; was adjutant of the First Battalion of Engineers from October 1, 1909, to April 12, 1912; was a member of the Board on Engineer Troops from March 1 to September 7, 1912; and was promoted to first lieutenant on February 27, 1911.

Sultan taught at West Point in the department of engineering and served as an assistant football coach from August 24, 1912, to July 18, 1916, and was made a captain on February 27, 1914. In September 1916, he was sent to Fort Mills, on Corregidor Island in the Philippines, where he was in charge of the construction and maintenance of fortifications on Corregidor, Caballo and Grande Islands. While there, he was made a major on May 15, 1917, and a temporary lieutenant-colonel on August 5, 1917. Sultan served in that capacity until October 18, 1917, when he was moved to Manila and placed in charge of all Philippines fortification work on October 19. He left Manila on January 14, 1918, and returned to the United States.

On January 21, he was assigned to the War Department General Staff, and served on the staff in Washington, D.C. from March 4, 1918, to June 1919, during which time he was made a colonel on July 13, 1918. Sultan was assigned to duty as general staff officer at the headquarters of the American Expeditionary Forces in France from June 1919, to October 1919, when he returned to duty with the War Department General Staff at Washington, D. C.. He was relieved from duty as a general staff officer on January 20, 1922, but continued on with the general staff until August 1922. He had returned to the rank of major on March 15, 1920. For his work as a general staff member, Sultan was awarded the Army Distinguished Service Medal. The citation for the medal reads:

== Later military service ==
Sultan was then at Fort Leavenworth as a student officer at the Command and General Staff School from August 1922 to July 1923, and graduated as an &#x27;honor graduate&#x27;. He moved to Savannah, Georgia and was the district engineer, in charge of all river and harbor improvements and fortifications in the region, from August 1923 to August 1925. Sultan attended the Army War College from August 1925 to July 1926; and was then a resident member of Board of Engineers for Rivers and Harbors in Washington, DC from July 1926 to August 1929.

=== Nicaragua survey ===
Sultan traveled to Nicaragua from August 20 to 29, arriving in Corinto and making his way to Granada. He was in charge of the Nicaragua Canal Survey and commanding US Army troops in Nicaragua beginning in August 1929. The survey gradually made its way through the country, finishing its work in the summer of 1931. On March 31, 1931, Managua was hit by a devastating earthquake. Sultan organized a relief team of 34 soldiers, and was on an emergency committee for responding. He was charged with overseeing the restoration of railroads and water to the city, and chaired a food relief committee that provided 24,000 rations daily by April 24.

While in Nicaragua, he was promoted to lieutenant-colonel on October 1, 1930, and was made a member of the Interoceanic Canal Board on March 31. Sultan&#x27;s command ended in July 1931, and he soon returned to Washington, DC. Sultan then worked on a report about the survey from August 1931 to January 1932. He concluded in a document published as a congressional document that “A canal through Nicaragua will aid our national defense, will foster friendly relations with all Latin America, and will promote trade with Central and South America. It will provide a shorter route from port to port for about two-thirds of the traffic now using the Panama Canal.” He also published an article about the survey in &quot;National Geographic Magazine.&quot; Sultan was awarded an oak leaf cluster to his Distinguished Service Medal for his work in Nicaragua, particularly for his response to the earthquake. He was also awarded the Nicaraguan Congressional Medal of Distinction and Presidential Medal of Merit.

=== Commissioner ===
He was then made district engineer in Chicago, leading construction of the Great Lakes to Mississippi Waterway until July 1934, during which time he was also the administrator of the Civil Works Administration in Cook County, Illinois. From July to September 1934 he worked with the Board of Engineers for Rivers and Harbors. Sultan then worked as engineer commissioner of the District of Columbia, a member of the National Capital Park and Planning Commission, the Public Utilities Commission, the Unemployment Compensation Board, and chairman of the Zoning Commission until September 1938. He was made a colonel on October 1, 1935, and vice-chairman of committee that arranged the inauguration of President Franklin D. Roosevelt in January 1937.

=== World War II ===
Sultan then commanded the 2d Regiment of Engineers from October to December 1, 1938, and was promoted to brigadier general on December 1. He commanded Fort Logan, Colorado until June 1939, and led the 22nd Infantry Brigade from July 1939 to February 1941. He led the Hawaiian Division from February 1941 to April 1941, and was promoted to major general on April 3, 1941. Sultan was in command of the 38th Infantry Division from May 1941 to April 1942, and led the VIII Corps until November 1943. He was then ordered to the China-Burma-India Theater in 1943 to act as deputy commander under General Joseph Stilwell. As deputy commander stationed in Allied-controlled New Delhi, Sultan focused largely on logistical issues, ensuring that sufficient supplies arrived in China, particularly by airlifting goods over the Himalayas and constructing the Ledo Road. He was promoted to lieutenant general on September 2, 1944, and on October 24 became commander of the India-Burma Theater.

As commander, Sultan was under the authority of Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma, the Supreme Allied Commander, South East Asia Command, and also served as commander of the Chinese Army in India. Sultan personally led a force of American, British and Chinese forces, known as the Northern Combat Area Command (NCAC). In 1944, the Allies formulated a plan, known as Operation Capital, to retake Northern Burma and reopen a land route to China. In early 1945, the NCAC was split into the 30th, 38th, and 50th Chinese Divisions; the British 36th Division, on loan from the Fourteenth Army; and the recently activated American 5332d Brigade (Provisional). Sultan&#x27;s troops traveled south during the Burma campaign, from Myitkyina, forcing the Japanese Thirty-Third Army back. His forces took control of the Burma Road, reopening it in January 1945. For his service as commander, he was awarded a third oak leaf cluster, the Bronze Star Medal, and the Legion of Merit. Returning to the United States June 26, 1945, he was appointed Inspector General of the Army on July 9. Sultan died from an acute heart ailment on January 14, 1947, at the Walter Reed General Hospital in Washington, D.C., while on active duty. He was buried at the West Point Cemetery four days later. Sultan was awarded his fourth oak leaf cluster to the Distinguished Service Medal as inspector general, the first army officer to do so. He was made a Companion of the Order of the Bath (United Kingdom) and granted the Order of the Cloud and Banner with Special Grand Cordon. After his death he was awarded the Air Medal.

==Legacy==
The United States Navy transport ship was named in his honor.

<text>Iota Orionis (ι Orionis, abbreviated ι Ori) is a multiple star system in the equatorial constellation of Orion the hunter. It is the eighth-brightest member of Orion with an apparent visual magnitude of 2.77 and also the brightest member of the asterism known as Orion&#x27;s Sword. It is a member of the NGC 1980 open cluster. From parallax measurements, it is located at a distance of roughly from the Sun.

The system has three visible components designated Iota Orionis A, B and C. Iota Orionis A has also been resolved using speckle interferometry and is also a massive spectroscopic binary, with components Iota Orionis Aa1 (officially named Hatysa ), Aa2, and Ab.

== Nomenclature ==

&quot;ι Orionis&quot; (Latinised to &quot;Iota Orionis&quot;) is the system&#x27;s Bayer designation. The designations of the three constituents as &quot;Iota Orionis A&quot;, &quot;B&quot; and &quot;C&quot;, and those of &quot;A&#x27;s&quot; components - &quot;Iota Orionis Aa1&quot;, &quot;Aa2&quot;, and &quot;Ab&quot; - derive from the convention used by the Washington Multiplicity Catalog (WMC) for multiple star systems, and adopted by the International Astronomical Union (IAU).

The system has the traditional name &quot;Nair al Saif&quot;, from the Arabic &quot;nayyir as-sayf&quot; &quot;the Bright One of the Sword&quot;, though this is little used.
Since Antonín Bečvář&#x27;s 1951 &quot;Atlas Coeli&quot;, it has borne the proper name &quot;Hatysa&quot;. Kunitzsch was unable to find an older source for the latter name.

In 2016, the IAU organized a Working Group on Star Names (WGSN) to catalog and standardize proper names for stars. The WGSN decided to attribute proper names to individual stars rather than entire multiple systems. It approved the name &quot;Hatysa&quot; for the component Iota Orionis Aa on 5 September 2017 and it is now so included in the List of IAU-approved Star Names.

Iota Orionis B is a variable star and in 2011 it was given the variable star designation V2451 Orionis.

== Distance ==

Iota Orionis has a parallax of in the Hipparcos new reduction, indicating a distance around . The previous published Hipparcos parallax was , suggesting a closer distance. Gaia Data Release 2 has individual parallaxes for the two fainter components of the Iota Orionis star system of and , indicating distances of and respectively, with margins of error of just a few parsecs. There is little doubt that all three stars are at the same distance.

Iota Orionis is generally assumed to be associated with the open cluster NGC 1980, which is at a distance of around . However, they may not lie at exactly the same distance and Iota Orionis may have a complex history involving stellar encounters and runaway stars. NGC 1980 contains few bright stars other than Iota Orionis. Only eighteen other stars are considered members in a survey down to 14th magnitude, most of them around 9th magnitude but including the 5th magnitude stars HR 1886 and 1887.

== Properties ==
Iota Orionis is dominated by the multiple star Iota Orionis A. It is clearly identified as a double-lined spectroscopic binary whose components are a stellar class O9 III star (blue giant) and a class B0.8 III/IV star about 2 magnitudes fainter. The combined spectral type has long been accepted as O9 III and it was listed as a standard star for that type. The collision of the stellar winds from this pair makes the system a strong X-ray source. Oddly, the two objects of this system appear to have different ages, with the secondary being about double the age of the primary. In combination with the high eccentricity (e=0.764) of their 29-day orbit, this suggests that the binary system was created through a capture, rather than by being formed together and undergoing a mass transfer. This capture may have occurred, for example, through an encounter between two binary systems, with one star being donated from each binary and two runaway stars being ejected. A third component away has been identified using speckle interferometry and is probably a B2 subgiant.

The primary component of Iota Orionis A is a class O giant star with a mass of about . It has a surface temperature of and radius of , resulting in a bolometric luminosity of . It is calculated to be around nine million years old. The secondary star of the spectroscopic binary pair is a class B giant or subgiant with a mass of about . It has a temperature of and radius of , resulting in it radiating over 8,000 times as much energy as the sun.

Iota Orionis B is a B8 giant at 11&quot; (approximately 5,000 AU) which has been shown to be variable, and likely to be a young stellar object. It is also a helium-weak chemically peculiar star. The fainter Iota Orionis C is an A0 star at 49&quot;.

<text>Shiri Appleby is an American actress and television director. She is best known for her leading roles as Liz Parker in the WB/UPN science fiction drama series &quot;Roswell&quot; (1999–2002) and Rachel Goldberg in the Lifetime/Hulu drama series &quot;Unreal&quot; (2015–2018).

Her major film credits include &quot;A Time for Dancing&quot; (2000), &quot;Swimfan&quot; (2002), &quot;Havoc&quot; (2005), &quot;Charlie Wilson&#x27;s War&quot; (2007), and &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Candy&quot; (2015).

Appleby also starred as intern Daria Wade in the final season of the NBC medical drama series &quot;ER&quot; (2008–2009). She later starred as Cate Cassidy in The CW drama series &quot;Life Unexpected&quot; (2010–2011) and as Lucy Lambert in the web comedy series &quot;Dating Rules from My Future Self&quot; (2012). Appleby also had recurring roles on the NBC drama series &quot;Chicago Fire&quot; (2012–2013) and the HBO comedy-drama series &quot;Girls&quot; (2013–2014).

==Early life and education==
Appleby&#x27;s Israeli-born mother is of Moroccan Jewish descent, and her Los Angeles-raised father is American and of Ashkenazi Jewish descent. Prior to moving to the United States, Appleby&#x27;s mother was an actress in Israel. During Appleby&#x27;s youth, her mother worked as a Hebrew school teacher, while her father worked as a tour guide at Universal Studios Hollywood. She was raised in what she described as a &quot;middle-class&quot; household in Calabasas in Los Angeles County, and kept kosher in her home growing up. She attended Hebrew school, and had a Bat Mitzvah.

Appleby graduated from Calabasas High School in 1997. She attended University of Southern California from 1998 to 1999, where she studied English. After two years she got the starring role in &quot;Roswell&quot; and was working steadily, but while shooting &quot;Life Unexpected&quot; in 2010, Appleby started to work towards a psychology degree from the online University of Phoenix. It took her 14 months, while also working, to complete the degree in 2012.

==Career==
Appleby began her acting career at the age of four, starting with advertisements for various products such as Cheerios and M&amp;M&#x27;s. She started acting and taking acting classes because her parents were concerned that she was so shy and introverted. Her first advertisement was for Raisin Bran, but it was never aired. She made guest appearances on many television programs, most notably &quot;thirtysomething&quot; (1987), &quot;Doogie Howser, M.D.&quot; (1989), &quot;ER&quot; (1994), &quot;Baywatch&quot; (1989), &quot;&quot; (1995), &quot;7th Heaven&quot; (1997), &quot;Beverly Hills, 90210&quot; (1990), before landing her break-out role in the series &quot;Roswell&quot; (1999–2002), where she tried out for the roles of Isabel and Maria before landing the leading role of Liz Parker.

Appleby has been featured in a number of music videos, such as Bon Jovi&#x27;s video for &quot;It&#x27;s My Life&quot; with Will Estes, and the 2004 video for the song &quot;I Don&#x27;t Want to Be&quot; by Gavin DeGraw, opposite Scott Mechlowicz. She also appeared in Sense Field&#x27;s music video for &quot;Save Yourself,&quot; which is part of the &quot;Roswell&quot; soundtrack and featured in the first season DVD box set.

In 2006, she had a recurring role on the short-lived ABC drama &quot;Six Degrees&quot; as Anya, a young assistant in a relationship with a much older photographer. Later that year, she played Hildy Young in the new USA Network series &quot;To Love and Die&quot;, that began airing in late December 2008. She also participated in a short film called &quot;Carjacking&quot; directed by Dan Passman and co-starring Geoff Stults.

In 2007, she appeared in the movie &quot;What Love Is&quot; alongside Cuba Gooding Jr., Matthew Lillard, and Anne Heche. She also participated in another short film &quot;Love Like Wind&quot; from Shaolin Film Productions. At the end of the year, she appeared as Charlie Wilson&#x27;s press secretary in the film &quot;Charlie Wilson&#x27;s War&quot;, which stars Tom Hanks and Julia Roberts. In 2008, Appleby had a recurring role on the 15th and final season of &quot;ER&quot; (her second time on the show), playing an intern named Daria Wade.

In 2010, Appleby starred in The CW network drama &quot;Life Unexpected&quot; as Cate Cassidy, a radio talk show host whose daughter whom she gave up for adoption becomes a part of her life. The show was canceled after two seasons.

In 2012, Appleby starred as the main character of &quot;Dating Rules from My Future Self,&quot; which she also produced.

In 2013, she had a role in the Lena Dunham HBO series, &quot;Girls,&quot; including a controversial &quot;money shot&quot; scene. She said the role allowed her to break out of a career where she was often typecast as being sweet. Appleby said that she was invited to read for a role when she was on the set of &quot;Girls&quot; because she was interested in directing and shadowed director Jesse Peretz. After a table read with the cast, she was offered a part.

In 2013, she was cast in the leading role in the Lifetime drama/dark comedy series &quot;Unreal&quot;, a show about the inner workings of a reality show (a show within a show), which premiered on June 1, 2015, and was produced by former &quot;The Bachelor&quot; producer, Sarah Gertrude Shapiro and writer Marti Noxon. To research her role as a reality show dating show producer, Appleby said that she spent time with a producer to quiz them about the work. She said that one of the appeals of the show was that the central focus was not about her character being in a romantic relationship. The show garnered strong reviews and had been picked up for four seasons. In 2016, Appleby directed her first episode of &quot;Unreal&quot;, titled &quot;Casualty&quot;. She went on to direct multiple episodes of the series. In July 2018, the series ended after four seasons.

In 2017, Appleby starred in Janicza Bravo&#x27;s first full-length feature, &quot;Lemon&quot;, which debuted at Sundance Film Festival.

In 2021, Appleby had a cameo role in the last scene of Season 3 Episode 13 of &quot;Roswell, New Mexico&quot;, having previously directed an episode in each of the first two seasons.

==Personal life==

In July 2012, Appleby got engaged to her boyfriend of two years, chef and restaurateur Jon Shook, during a trip to Ventotene, Italy. Shook is the co-owner with Vinny Dotolo of the Los Angeles restaurants Animal, Son of a Gun, Trois Mec, and Jon &amp; Vinny&#x27;s. Shook said that he met Appleby through his business partner Dotolo&#x27;s wife, who was friends with Appleby. In December 2012, the couple announced that they were expecting their first child in early 2013. Appleby gave birth to a girl in March 2013. Shook and Appleby have since married. Their second child, a son, was born in December 2015.

In Hebrew, the word &quot;shiri&quot; means either &quot;my song&quot; or &quot;my poem&quot; or simply &quot;sing&quot; (second person female imperative). Appleby said her parents said that when she was born, she was like the song in their hearts.

She has a scar above her left eyebrow that she got when a neighbor&#x27;s dog bit her when she was young. To get over her fear of dogs, she went on the show &quot;Emergency Vets&quot;, accompanying staff veterinarian Kevin Fitzgerald (she also overcame another phobia in the same episode by holding a live snake, one of Fitzgerald&#x27;s patients) and shortly after adopted a tabby cat, which she named Abby.
