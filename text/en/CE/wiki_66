<text>Charles Brandon Inge ( ; born May 19, 1977) is an American former professional baseball third baseman and catcher and currently a volunteer assistant coach for the Michigan Wolverines baseball team. He played 12 seasons with the Detroit Tigers, one with the Oakland Athletics and one with the Pittsburgh Pirates of Major League Baseball (MLB). He bats and throws right-handed.

Sportswriter Jayson Stark described Inge as a &quot;super-utility dervish.&quot; In 2006, his diving stop and subsequent throw from his knees to put out Gary Bennett in an interleague game, on June 25 against the St. Louis Cardinals earned him the ESPN defensive play of the year for a third baseman.

==Early life==
Inge played baseball at Brookville High School in Lynchburg, Virginia, also playing American Legion Baseball. He was named Legion Baseball&#x27;s 2010 Graduate of the Year. Brookville retired Inge&#x27;s uniform number (7).

He then attended Virginia Commonwealth University, where he played on the baseball team as a shortstop and relief pitcher. In 1997 he played collegiate summer baseball in the Cape Cod Baseball League for the Bourne Braves where he was named a league all-star. He was drafted by the Detroit Tigers in the 2nd round in the 1998 Major League Baseball Draft.

==Career==

===Detroit Tigers===
Inge began his professional career with the Jamestown Jammers, of the Single–A New York–Penn League. In 51 games, Inge batted .230. His 8 homers, 10 doubles, and 29 RBI were all team–high totals. Previously a shortstop, Inge became a catcher.

Inge was promoted to the West Michigan Whitecaps for the 1999 season, making 100 appearances. In June, Inge put together a hitting streak that lasted for 12 games. For the season, he batted .244, with 9 homers and 46 runs batted in. He also stole 15 bases, the highest single–season total for his entire baseball career.

Inge split the 2000 season between the Double–A Jacksonville Suns and the Triple–A Toledo Mud Hens. In 78 games with Jacksonville, he hit 6 homers, drove in 53 runs, and compiled a .258 batting average. Inge saw action in 55 games with the Mud Hens, tallying 5 homers and 20 RBI, but only hitting for a .221 average.

Inge began 2001 in the majors, debuting as Detroit&#x27;s starting catcher on opening day and throwing out a pair of Minnesota Twins baserunners in the game. On April 6, he got his first MLB base hit, a double against Chicago White Sox pitcher Jim Parque. On June 24, Inge sustained a dislocated left shoulder. He was put on the disabled list the next day and was out of action for a month before he was sent to the Gulf Coast League Tigers for a brief rehab stint. After three games with the GCL Tigers and four games with West Michigan, Inge joined Toledo on August 2 and he remained there until he was recalled by Detroit on September 1. In 27 games with Toledo, Inge batted .289, with 2 homers, 11 doubles, and 15 runs batted in. Inge appeared in 79 games with the Tigers, batting .180 and posting 11 doubles and 15 RBI.

Initially signed as a catcher, Inge struggled offensively in his first three seasons. After the Tigers signed free-agent Iván Rodríguez in , Inge played in the outfield, catcher and at third base, batting .287 with 13 home runs that season.

He started 159 games at third base in , and led all AL third basemen in errors (23), assists (378) and double plays (42). In 2006, Inge exceeded his 2005 totals with 398 assists. That number broke the Detroit Tigers single season record for assists by a third baseman (previously 389 by Aurelio Rodríguez in 1974) and was only 14 short of the all time MLB record for assists by a third baseman (set by Graig Nettles in 1971). Only five third basemen (including Graig Nettles, Brooks Robinson, and Mike Schmidt) have collected more assists in a season than Inge.

In 2006, Inge showed power during the first half, with his 17 home runs tying for the team lead. His slugging percentage was .463 and he placed third on the Tigers with 47 RBIs. After the All-Star Break, he raised his season average from .221 to .253 and finished with a career-high 27 home runs. On October 27, 2006, Inge struck out versus St. Louis Cardinals pitcher Adam Wainwright for the final out of the 2006 World Series.

Inge became expendable at third base after the Tigers acquired Miguel Cabrera in a blockbuster trade with the Florida Marlins. Inge asked management to trade him to a team where he would have a chance to be an everyday player. However, a deal was never made, and the team stated that he would be used as a utility player for the 2008 season. Inge reported to spring training early with the pitchers and catchers. He was named the opening day center fielder after Curtis Granderson was placed on the disabled list.
With the absence of backup catcher Vance Wilson, Inge filled this role for the 13-time Gold Glove winner Iván Rodríguez. Inge took over the catching position full-time after Rodríguez was traded to the New York Yankees on July 30, 2008.

On September 27, Tigers manager Jim Leyland announced that he would move Inge back to third base for the 2009 season.

Inge opened the 2009 season as the starting third baseman for the Tigers. He started the season by successfully reaching base 24 games in a row, the longest such streak for the Tigers since 1976. Through the first half of the 2009 season, Inge led the team in home runs with 21 and was named to the All-Star team.

Having received a record 11.8 million votes in the Final Vote, Inge was selected to his first All Star Game, joining teammates Curtis Granderson, Justin Verlander, and Edwin Jackson on the American League squad. Inge participated in the Home Run Derby and became the eighth player in the history of the Derby to not hit a single home run. He set career highs in games (161) and RBI (84) over the 2009 season, while matching his career high of 27 home runs.

Inge underwent surgery on both of his knees on November 3, 2009. He attended a strengthening and rehabilitation program during the winter. He made a full recovery in time to play midway through spring training, and started at third base on Opening Day of the 2010 season in Kansas City.

On July 19, 2010, Inge was hit on the left hand by a pitch. X-rays revealed a non-displaced fracture of the fifth metacarpal. Doctors said it would take 4–6 weeks to heal, however he returned two weeks later.

On August 26, 2010, Inge achieved his 1,000th career hit against the Kansas City Royals.

On September 25, 2010, Inge set the Tigers franchise mark for strikeouts with 1,100. In the same game however, Inge had the game-winning hit in the 13th inning against the Minnesota Twins.

At the conclusion of the season, Tigers general manager Dave Dombrowski announced plans to re-sign Inge to a multi-year contract.

Inge received the 2010 Marvin Miller Man of the Year Award, given by the Major League Baseball Players Association each year &quot;to the player whose on-field performances and community outreach most inspire others to higher levels of achievement.&quot;

On June 3, 2011, Inge was placed on the 15-day disabled list with mononucleosis. In 239 plate appearances with Detroit in 2011, he recorded a .177 batting average, before being designated for assignment on July 20. He was outrighted to Triple-A on July 26. In his return to the Tigers on August 20, Inge went 2-for-4, hitting a home run in his first at-bat and driving in two runs, en route to a 10–1 win over the second-place Cleveland Indians.
As of January 26, 2012, Inge had lost his starting third base job to Miguel Cabrera who was moving back to the hot corner after the Tigers announced they had signed slugger Prince Fielder to play 1st base. At the press conference announcing the Fielder signing, manager Jim Leyland said that Inge &quot;was not a happy camper&quot;. Leyland also said that Inge would be able to play second base for the Tigers, along with Ramon Santiago, and Ryan Raburn, but Inge was still thinking he should have a full-time job. Brandon continued to play second base with the others as Leyland said anyway. Brandon Inge was released by the Tigers following their game on April 26, 2012.

===Oakland Athletics===
Inge agreed to sign with the Oakland Athletics on April 29, 2012, on a $5.5 million deal. The signing provided infield depth for Oakland, who lost Scott Sizemore to a knee injury. He initially wore number 18, but switched to number 7 after a few games (his old #15 was worn by teammate Seth Smith). In his first game against the Tigers a week later, Inge hit a grand slam. On September 1, after dislocating his shoulder for the second time within a month, Inge was forced to undergo season ending shoulder surgery.

===Pittsburgh Pirates===
On February 12, 2013, Inge inked a minor-league deal with the Pittsburgh Pirates. He started the 2013 season on the disabled list. On April 23, 2013, Inge was recalled from AAA. He was designated for assignment on July 23, 2013, and released seven days later.

==Post-playing career==
On January 29, 2021, Inge was named volunteer assistant coach for the 2021 Michigan Wolverines baseball team.

==Personal life==
Inge currently resides in Michigan. In August 2009, Inge received two tattoos, one on each forearm, on a West Coast road trip. The tattoos are the names of his sons, &quot;Chase&quot; and &quot;Tyler&quot;.

<doc id="924835" wikidata="Q408725" url="?curid=924835" title="Airheads">
<text>Airheads is a 1994 American comedy film directed by Michael Lehmann and written by Rich Wilkes. It stars Brendan Fraser, Steve Buscemi, and Adam Sandler as the members of a struggling rock band who hijack a Los Angeles radio station in order to get their demo aired. The rest of the principal cast includes Chris Farley, Michael McKean, Judd Nelson, Michael Richards, and Joe Mantegna, with Ernie Hudson, Amy Locane, Nina Siemaszko, Marshall Bell, Reg E. Cathey, and David Arquette in supporting roles.

&quot;Airheads&quot; was a critical and commercial failure, but has since come to be viewed as a cult film.

==Plot==
In Los Angeles, Chester &quot;Chazz Darby&quot; Ogilvie and his friends, sibling musicians Rex and Pip, are in the Los Angeles hard rock band &quot;The Lone Rangers&quot; who are continuously rejected while trying to get their demo tape heard by record producers like Jimmie Wing. After scolding him for being lazy, Chazz&#x27;s girlfriend Kayla kicks him out of her apartment.

The Lone Rangers try to get local rock station KPPX to play their reel-to-reel tape on the air by attempting to break-in through the back door. Once inside, DJ Ian &quot;The Shark&quot; talks with them on the air. Station manager Milo overhears them and intervenes, but Ian continues broadcasting. After Milo calls Rex &quot;Hollywood Boulevard trash,&quot; he and Chazz pull out realistic-looking water pistols filled with hot pepper sauce and demand airplay. After setting up an old reel-to-reel for the demo, the tape begins to play but is immediately destroyed when the player malfunctions. The trio attempt escape, but the station&#x27;s accountant Doug Beech has already called the police. The building ends up being surrounded as the Lone Rangers start rounding up Suzzi and the other employees Yvonne, Marcus, and Carter.

They negotiate with the police who are now tasked to find Kayla who has a cassette of the demo. Since the station never went off the air, news of the hostage crisis travel and fans begin showing up outside and interfering with police. A SWAT team also arrives where Carl Mace prefers using force over negotiation tactics by Sergeant O&#x27;Malley. His team secretly passes a gun through a roof vent to Beech who has been hiding in the air ducts. During the crisis, it is revealed that Milo secretly signed a deal to change KPPX&#x27;s format from rock to adult contemporary which includes having to fire Ian and most of the other employees. Consequently, Ian and some employees side with the band and turn against Milo.

The police find Kayla at the club and She arrives at the station to deliver the tape. However, the tape is damaged because she threw it out of the car earlier. Chazz and Kayla get into an argument that escalates and results in the studio console being destroyed, dashing any hopes of the tape being played on the air.

As some of the items the band demanded from police are brought into the station, the door shuts on Rex&#x27;s plastic gun, revealing it to be fake. Seeing this, Marcus and Carter run out with one telling the SWAT team the band&#x27;s guns are fake upon being subdued. As the team assembles to storm the station, Beech corners the band from an air vent. Knowing he no longer will have a job at the station, Ian knocks down Beech&#x27;s gun. This causes the weapon to wildly fire rounds, and the police are forced to back off. Ian picks up the gun, but gives it to Chazz in an act of anti-establishment rebellion.

Jimmie Wing comes to the station and offers the band a contract, to which they reluctantly agree. Wing arranges a stage and sound system to be airlifted to the roof where the band will play their song for the now huge crowd outside. However, the band find that only the PA system is real and everything else is just props. Refusing to lip sync to their tape, they instead destroy their instruments in protest to the delight of the crowd and stage dive into the hands of the cheering audience that O&#x27;Malley has his men let through.

The band later plays a gig in prison where they are incarcerated as Kayla and Suzzi dance in the background. The concert is shown live on MTV. Now their manager, Ian says on the phone to an unknown person that the band will start touring upon their release in six months, three months if they behave themselves.

A postscript states that the Lone Rangers ultimately serve three months in prison for kidnapping, theft, and assault with hot pepper sauce. Their album &quot;LIVE IN PRISON&quot; goes triple platinum.

<text>USS &quot;Anderson&quot; (DD-411) was a in the United States Navy. She was named for Rear Admiral Edwin Alexander Anderson, Jr., a Medal of Honor recipient.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Anderson&quot; was laid down on 15 November 1937 at Kearny, New Jersey, by the Federal Shipbuilding and Drydock Company; launched on 4 February 1939; sponsored by Mrs. Mertie Loraine Anderson, the widow of Rear Admiral Anderson; towed to the New York Navy Yard, and delivered there to the Navy on 18 May 1939; and commissioned on 19 May 1939, Lieutenant Commander William M. Hobby, Jr., in command.

==Service history==

===Inter-War Period===

&quot;Anderson&quot; was the first of the &quot;Sims&quot; class to be delivered in early 1939, and was found to be 150 tons overweight and dangerously top-heavy due to insufficient metacentric height. This touched off a redesign and rebuilding of the class, completed during 1941. One 5-inch gun (No. 3) and one quad torpedo tube mount were removed, with another torpedo tube mount relocated to the centerline. It was determined that an underestimate by the Bureau of Engineering of the weight of a new machinery design was responsible and that the Bureau of Construction and Repair did not have sufficient authority to detect or correct the error during the design process. This eventually led to the consolidation of the previous bureaus into the new Bureau of Ships on 20 June 1940.

After commissioning, &quot;Anderson&quot; remained at the New York Navy Yard through June, fitting out, during which time she contributed a landing party of sailors to march in the New York City Flag Day parade on 14 June 1939. Underway from her berth on 5 July, &quot;Anderson&quot; reached Newport, Rhode Island, on 7 July, mooring to the east dock at the Naval Torpedo Station, and taking on board torpedo warheads, exploders, and test equipment before returning to the New York Navy Yard the next day, pausing there only briefly before getting underway later that afternoon for Washington, D.C.

Anchoring off Quantico on the night of 9 July, &quot;Anderson&quot; steamed up the Potomac River, rendering the prescribed passing honors abeam of Mount Vernon, and arrived at the Washington Navy Yard at 0721 on 10 July. The next day, a number of high-ranking officers informally inspected the new destroyer, the first of the &quot;Sims&quot;-class to be placed in commission, Admiral Harold R. Stark, the Chief of Naval Operations, accompanied by Captain H. T. Markland; Rear Admirals Robert L. Ghormley, Director of War Plans, and William R. Furlong, Chief of the Bureau of Ordnance, as well as Charles Edison, the Acting Secretary of the Navy.

On 12 July, assisted by and , &quot;Anderson&quot; got underway for Yorktown, Virginia. She loaded depth charges at the mine depot at Yorktown before moving to the Naval Operating Base (NOB) at Norfolk before getting underway on 14 July for Wilmington, North Carolina. Wilmington was the hometown of the man for whom the ship had been named, Admiral Anderson; and it accorded the ship a warm welcome. The local paper editorialized: &quot;It is a pleasure to have you in port and to inspect the magnificent new destroyer named in honor of a distinguished son. The ship and its personnel are a credit to the record and memory of the man for whom your ship is named... Therefore, we bid you welcome, and if there is aught that can add to your entertainment while here, you have but to ask any resident and it is yours...&quot; &quot;Anderson&quot; gave a tea for Mrs. Anderson, members of the late flag officer&#x27;s family, and the city officials of Wilmington on the afternoon of 17 July. On the next day, assisted out into the stream by the tug &quot;Battler&quot;, the destroyer made a departure from Wilmington.

Reaching NOB, Norfolk, on 19 July, &quot;Anderson&quot; shifted to the Norfolk Navy Yard that same day to take onboard ammunition. After embarking six enlisted Marines for transportation to the Marine Barracks at Guantanamo Bay, &quot;Anderson&quot; got underway on 21 July for Cuban waters and the initial part of her shakedown cruise. Arriving at Guantanamo on 24 July, the destroyer disembarked her passengers before operating locally over the next few days.

&quot;Anderson&quot; then visited San Juan, Puerto Rico (from 1–5 August); Coco Solo, Panama Canal Zone (8–14 August); and Hamilton, Bermuda (19–21 August); St. John&#x27;s, Newfoundland and Labrador (25–28 August); before she reached Montreal, Quebec, Canada, on the morning of 31 August. Underway on 5 September, the destroyer called briefly at Quebec (5 to 6 September) before she headed for Newport. On 8 September, while en route, &quot;Anderson&quot; sighted a merchantman eight miles (13 km) distant, identifying her as Norwegian by the display of national colors on ship&#x27;s side. Soon thereafter, a plane, identified as &quot;British&quot; (possibly Royal Canadian Air Force) by the wing markings, circled &quot;Anderson&quot; at low altitude, obviously scrutinizing the ship thoroughly before banking away and heading for the coast.

&quot;Anderson&quot; made arrival at the Naval Torpedo Station at Newport the following day, 9 September, and over the next few days served as the underway &quot;target&quot; for torpedo practice conducted by on the testing range in Narragansett Bay. On 16 September, &quot;Anderson&quot; arrived back at the New York Navy Yard, her shakedown completed, for the installation of her main battery director. After brief periods underway for testing fire control equipment (21–22 September), &quot;Anderson&quot; took a departure from New York for NOB, Norfolk, arriving on 24 September.

&quot;Anderson&quot; conducted gunnery exercises on the Southern Drill Grounds off the Virginia Capes, firing at a target towed by on 26 September before firing antiaircraft battery practice on 28 September. She arrived at the New York Navy Yard for post-shakedown availability on the morning of 1 October; these repairs and alterations continuing through the end of January 1940.

The destroyer then touched briefly at the Boston Navy Yard before she ran her final acceptance trials off Rockland, Maine, on 7 February 1940, with Rear Admiral H. L. Brinser, president of the Board of Inspection and Survey, embarked. &quot;Anderson&quot; then paid a return visit to the Boston Navy Yard on 9 February before returning to New York, via the Cape Cod Canal, Buzzards Bay and Oyster Bay, on 12 February.

&quot;Anderson&quot; remained at the Navy Yard through the end of March, after which time she sailed for Newport, for torpedo firing tests on 10 April. At 1130 on 12 April, the destroyer embarked the Honorable John Z. Anderson, a California Congressman and member of the House Naval Affairs Committee, and got underway shortly thereafter, reaching NOB, Norfolk, and mooring to Pier 7, at 2008 the following day, disembarking her passenger the next morning.

Underway in company with , &quot;Anderson&quot; stood out, headed for Guantanamo Bay, on the afternoon of 15 April. The next day, 14 hours out of Norfolk, the ships ran into heavy weather. At 0440 on 16 April, the strongback of the port lifeboat was reported to be cracked. Lieutenant George R. Phelan, the executive officer, gathered men of the deck force in the lee of the galley, amidships, as the ship steered various courses in an attempt to lessen the roll and thereby facilitate efforts to secure the port lifeboat. Between rolls, Lieutenant Phelan and his men attempted to recover the boat and make it fast, but the effort soon became too dangerous, not worth the lives of the men, and the work had to be abandoned, the boat carrying away completely at 0718. Ultimately, &quot;Anderson&quot; reached Guantanamo Bay at 0618 on 19 April.

Underway again nine hours later, &quot;Anderson&quot;, again in company with &quot;Manley&quot;, reached the submarine base at Coco Solo, Panama Canal Zone, on 21 April. Transiting the Panama Canal on 23 April, &quot;Anderson&quot; proceeded independently up the west coast of Central America, reaching Acapulco, Mexico, on the 27th. The next morning, following by nine hours the visit of Commander W. M. Dillon, the naval attaché at the United States Embassy in Mexico City, &quot;Anderson&quot; sent ashore a working party to bring off &quot;naval stores salvaged from the wreck&quot; of (listed in the 1941 Merchant Vessel Register as &quot;abandoned&quot; during the previous year). Underway again four hours later, &quot;Anderson&quot; rejoined &quot;Manley&quot; on 30 April, and reached San Diego at 0900 on 1 May 1940.

After conducting a brief harbor cruise with 85 Army reservists embarked on 18 May, &quot;Anderson&quot; got underway to conduct a neutrality patrol off the coast of southern California. During the course of this operation on 20 May, the destroyer sighted a tug five miles (8 km) away at 0945 and altered course to close and investigate. Closer examination revealed &quot;Ray P. Clark&quot;, towing a barge laden with horses and bales of hay and flying a distress signal. &quot;Anderson&quot; immediately called away her fire and rescue party and stopped to render assistance, help which turned out to be only giving directions to the tug which had become lost and needed the course to San Nicolas Island. The assistance duly rendered, &quot;Anderson&quot; continued on her appointed rounds, arriving back at San Diego on the morning of 23 May.

The warship commenced the month of June as plane guard for , as that carrier conducted local operations out of North Island; she later planeguarded for from 19 to 21 June, interspersed with type training and gunnery practices out of Pyramid Cove, San Clemente Island. At 0900 on 22 June, as the ship prepared to sail for Hawaiian waters, Commander Allan E. Smith reported on board and broke his pennant in &quot;Anderson&quot; as Commander, Destroyer Division 3 (DesDiv 3); &quot;Anderson&quot; subsequently took a departure from San Diego on the morning of 25 June, sailing in company with &quot;Enterprise&quot; and , , , and .

During the passage to Hawaii, &quot;Anderson&quot; alternated with the other destroyers in standing plane guard duty for &quot;Enterprise&quot; and then serving as an antisubmarine screen. On 28 June, during morning flight operations, a plane from Scouting Squadron (VS) 6 lost power after being catapulted from the flight deck and was forced to ditch. &quot;Hammann&quot; arrived on the scene first and rescued the pilot and his radioman, &quot;Enterprise&quot; later drew alongside the plane and recovered it. Subsequently, &quot;Anderson&quot; covered the arrival of the force at Pearl Harbor and then followed it in, mooring on the morning of 2 July.

For the next five months, &quot;Anderson&quot; operated locally put of Pearl Harbor and Lahaina Roads. Her operations within the Hawaiian chain took her to Palmyra (22 July) and Christmas Island (23 July); and included such evolutions as antiaircraft and machine gun practices; battle depth charge practices, and torpedo practices, often operating in company with destroyers, light cruisers, and battleships. Interspersed were periods of upkeep back at Pearl Harbor alongside between 26 and 28 October, and drydocking (28 to 29 October and again from 30 October to 4 November). The ship also patrolled assigned areas adjacent to the Lahaina Roads anchorage, off Maui, and off Honolulu and Pearl Harbor, intercepting and identifying many merchantmen, and local craft, such as fishing boats, as well as noting the movements of American warships. Following this intensive period of operations in Hawaiian waters, &quot;Anderson&quot; took a departure from Pearl Harbor on 2 December 1940, bound for the West Coast in company with the rest of Destroyer Squadron (DesRon) 8.

Arriving at San Diego on the afternoon of 8 December, &quot;Anderson&quot; steamed to the Los Angeles Shipbuilding and Drydock Company, San Pedro, Los Angeles, the day after Christmas, and underwent an overhaul there through the first week of January 1941. Then, after operating locally out of Long Beach and San Diego, &quot;Anderson&quot; took a departure from San Diego on the morning of 14 January and rendezvoused with &quot;Enterprise&quot; and off San Pedro. The force conducted drills and exercises en route to the Hawaiian Islands, reaching Pearl Harbor on the morning of 21 January.

&quot;Anderson&quot; resumed operations in the Hawaiian area on 12 February, conducting such evolutions as depth charge practices, night battle practice runs, and gunnery drills, until returning to Pearl Harbor on 19 February. Underway again two days later she conducted more gunnery runs and damage control problems before returning to port that afternoon to provision from the storeship . Underway again on the morning of 22 February, &quot;Anderson&quot; patrolled off the entrance to Pearl Harbor and encountered a fishing craft trespassing in a security zone; lowering her motor whaleboat, &quot;Anderson&quot; investigated the craft and warned her owner to keep away from those waters. &quot;Anderson&quot; returned to Pearl Harbor the next morning, 23 February, before resuming the intensive schedule of operations with the other ships in her division that lasted through the end of February.

During March 1941, &quot;Anderson&quot; continued the rapid pace of operations out of Pearl Harbor, operating with the fleet and honing her skills in antisubmarine warfare tactics and in gunnery. She also operated for a time with &quot;Yorktown&quot; as plane guard. During flight operations on the morning of 17 March 1941, two TBD Devastators from Torpedo Squadron 5 collided at and crashed into the sea, from the carrier. &quot;Yorktown&quot;″s boats recovered the bodies of the pilots, but both planes sank in 2,910 fathoms (5,320 m) of water, carrying the other four men – two in each aircraft – with them. &quot;Anderson&quot; – detailed to remain in the vicinity and continue the search – found only small parts of the planes and pieces of clothing.

These evolutions in Hawaiian waters proved to be the last for some time; &quot;Anderson&quot; got underway for the West Coast of the United States shortly after noon on 24 March, and reached Mare Island Navy Yard on the last day of the month after first disembarking, at San Francisco, enlisted passengers transported from Pearl Harbor. The destroyer spent all of April 1941 undergoing repairs and alterations at the West Coast yard, and on 16 May got underway for her post-repair trials.

After operating briefly in San Francisco Bay, &quot;Anderson&quot; shifted to Long Beach on 21 May, and eight days later, took a departure, ostensibly, for the Hawaiian Islands, in company with her division mates, &quot;Hammann&quot;, &quot;Mustin&quot;, and &quot;Rowan&quot;. The ships soon received a change of orders. They rendezvoused with on the afternoon of 30 May, and soon proceeded down the coast, bound for Panama, as another increment of the Pacific Fleet was withdrawn to augment the Atlantic Fleet in its undeclared war with the German Navy in the Atlantic.

===Atlantic Neutrality Patrols===
Transiting the Panama Canal on the night of 8–9 June, &quot;Anderson&quot;, her hull number and name painted out for security reasons, passed the Cristobal breakwater at 0125 on 9 June, en route to Guantanamo Bay. Fueling there on 11 June, &quot;Anderson&quot; got underway the same afternoon, quickly taking up antisubmarine screening station off the port bow of , which she escorted up the eastern seaboard to the Philadelphia Navy Yard, arriving there on 15 June.

The respite in port proved brief, however, since &quot;Anderson&quot; took a departure early on the morning of 19 June. Joined by shortly thereafter, the destroyer stood down the Delaware River, and out into the Atlantic. They joined the following morning, and, later, shortly after noon on 21 June.

Together, these ships proceeded out into the central Atlantic on neutrality patrol, cruising almost as far as the Cape Verde Islands, &quot;safeguarding the neutrality of the United States.&quot; Their voyage took them almost to the edge of the zones defined in operations orders of April and June 1941. &quot;Anderson&quot; served as plane guard for &quot;Wasp&quot; and as an antisubmarine screen for the carrier and for &quot;Tuscaloosa&quot; during the patrol that ultimately came to an end at Bermuda on Independence Day, 1941.

After a brief period in Bermudan waters, a break she utilized for a short stint of close-range battle practice, &quot;Anderson&quot; took a departure on 12 July for Norfolk, reaching her destination the following day. After getting underway from the Tidewater region for torpedo practice on 17 July, the warship sailed north for Boston, and reached the Boston Navy Yard on the afternoon of 19 July.

&quot;Anderson&quot; then underwent repairs and alterations into early August; during her time in the yard, her number three 5 inch (127 mm) mount was removed to save topside weight and allow the fitting of additional .50 caliber (12.7 mm) machine guns, extensions to her depth charge tracks, and a &quot;Y&quot;-gun (depth charge projector), in addition to two dozen additional depth charges. Thus refitted to better perform the escort role needed in the developing Battle of the Atlantic, she participated in intensive antisubmarine exercises out of Provincetown, Massachusetts, during the latter half of August 1941 before returning to Boston on the 30th. &quot;Anderson&quot;″s operations now carried her farther north, as she sailed for Casco Bay, Maine, on 2 September, exercising with &quot;Tuscaloosa&quot; en route.

Assigned to Task Force 15 (TF 15), &quot;Anderson&quot; steamed as part of the escort force for the first major reinforcement convoy bound for Iceland, carrying an Army brigade to augment the Marines who had been there since July. The ships reached Reykjavík on the evening of 15 September after a passage enlivened by two &quot;submarine&quot; contacts in &quot;Anderson&quot;″s vicinity: one summarily depth-charged by on 8 September, the other by on the 10th. Then, between 26 September and 3 October, &quot;Anderson&quot; escorted a convoy to Placentia Bay, Newfoundland.

&quot;Anderson&quot; remained at Placentia Bay for almost a week before getting underway on 10 October as part of the antisubmarine screen for TF 14, formed around &quot;Yorktown&quot;. This force reached Casco Bay, Maine, on the afternoon of 13 October. Moving down to Provincetown, &quot;Anderson&quot; again conducted antisubmarine exercises, and as in previous practices, the ship&#x27;s performance was &quot;outstanding in detecting the presence of a submarine and carrying out a successful attack.&quot; Later, after a tender availability alongside at Casco Bay, she resumed her operations at sea with TF 14.

Standing out of Casco Bay on the afternoon of 26 October, with Task Group 14.3 (TG 14.3), , , , &quot;Yorktown&quot;, and seven destroyers as the escort for a convoy of six British cargo ships bound for the British Isles, &quot;Anderson&quot;, in the inner anti-submarine screen, plane guarded for the carrier as she conducted flight operations covering the convoy as it moved out into the Atlantic.

On 30 October, from St. John&#x27;s, Newfoundland, &quot;Yorktown&quot; had just completed recovering planes and was proceeding to refuel when, at 1219, &quot;Anderson&quot; made an underwater contact, distant. &quot;Anderson&quot; went to general quarters immediately and proceeded ahead to develop the contact dropping a standard pattern of six depth charges at 1225. Five minutes later, dropped an &quot;embarrassing barrage&quot;. Other ships in the vicinity, however, began sighting porpoises and blackfish, leading Commander Frank G. Fahrion, Commander, DesDiv 3 in &quot;Anderson&quot;, to report over the high-frequency radio (TBS) to &quot;Morris&quot; that, in view of the fish sightings, the contact was a false one.

Soon thereafter, however, &quot;Anderson&quot;″s men saw an oil slick and lowered a bucket that, when drawn up, contained a mixture of oil, water, and burnt TNT. At 1305, the destroyer picked up a propeller noise and attacked with a second pattern of six depth charges. Soon thereafter, , also in on the &quot;hunt&quot;, picked up a contact and requested &quot;Anderson&quot; to develop it. The latter dropped another pattern in 1409.

&quot;Anderson&quot; secured from general quarters at 1421, and then, in company with &quot;Hughes&quot;, tried to develop further contacts or to obtain concrete evidence of a &quot;kill.&quot; Unfortunately, it appeared that their quarry had escaped.

After securing from the search at 1503, &quot;Anderson&quot; remained with TF 14 until detached on 6 November. At 1637 on that same day, while steaming in company with &quot;Hammann&quot;, &quot;Anderson&quot; sighted an unidentified ship which instituted radical course changes when she apparently sighted the two American destroyers. As &quot;Hammann&quot; parted company, &quot;Anderson&quot; investigated the stranger, finding her to be , steaming singly from Belfast, Northern Ireland, to Halifax, Nova Scotia. The destroyer then trailed the tanker for a time until securing from the effort at 2246.

Reaching Hvalfjörður on 7 November and fueling from upon arrival, &quot;Anderson&quot; then spent the next month operating in Icelandic waters, out of Hvalfjörður (&quot;Valley Forge&quot;) and Reykjavík (&quot;Rinky Dink&quot;). The ship&#x27;s last &quot;peacetime&quot; operations consisted of a sweep, in company with &quot;Idaho&quot; and from Reykjavík across the southern end of the Denmark Strait, between Iceland and Greenland, between 1 and 6 December 1941.

===World War II===

====Atlantic====
Underway from Hvalfjörður, Iceland, on the morning of 9 December 1941, two days after the Japanese attack upon the Pacific Fleet at Pearl Harbor, halfway across the globe, &quot;Anderson&quot; reached the Norfolk Navy Yard on 17 December, tarrying only a short time before taking a departure at 0537 on 18 December for Charleston, South Carolina in company with &quot;Hammann&quot;, &quot;Mustin&quot;, and &quot;Morris&quot;, and reaching their destination the following morning. Unloading ammunition the following day, &quot;Anderson&quot; spent the rest of 1941 undergoing repairs and alterations at the Charleston Navy Yard, including the replacement of her .50-caliber (12.7 mm) machine guns with 20 mm antiaircraft guns.

Three days into 1942, &quot;Anderson&quot; sailed for Norfolk, Virginia and after calibrating her degaussing gear on the Wolf Trap degaussing range, near Norfolk, the destroyer arrived at NOB, Norfolk, on the morning of 5 January. mi Once again, the respite in port proved brief, and at midday on 6 January, &quot;Anderson&quot; cleared Hampton Roads in company with &quot;Morris&quot; and &quot;Hammann&quot;, ultimately taking a screening position on the port beam of &quot;Mississippi&quot; in the force escorting the battlewagons of BatDiv 3 back to the Pacific Ocean.

====Pacific====
Over the next four days, the destroyers guarded &quot;New Mexico&quot;, &quot;Mississippi&quot;, and as they headed down the East Coast of the United States and across the Gulf of Mexico. Reaching Cristobal on the morning of 11 January, &quot;Anderson&quot; transited the Panama Canal during the day, mooring at Balboa that afternoon. After taking on fuel, the destroyer was underway once more, that evening, bound for San Diego, California. On the second leg of the voyage, all ships remained alert. Within two days of a departure from Panama, &quot;Anderson&quot;″s lookouts reported a torpedo track at 0113 on 13 January. Over the next four days, the ships sighted, challenged and identified two ships, both of which proved to be friendly: the British-registry &quot;Ocean Voice&quot; and the American-registry &quot;Kishacoquillas&quot;, on 15 and 17 January, respectively.

During the passage, the ships honed up their gunnery skills, and OS2U Kingfishers simulated dive, torpedo, and high-level bombing attacks on the convoy. Off San Francisco Bay, the submarine jitters struck again, this time as &quot;Hammann&quot; reported a contact on the morning of 22 January and depth charged the &quot;contact&quot; with negative results. The odyssey from the East Coast completed, &quot;Anderson&quot; moored in a nest at Pier 54, San Francisco, at 1250 on 22 January 1942.

&quot;Anderson&quot; subsequently unmoored on the morning of 25 January, after having undergone a brief tender availability in a nest alongside and stood out of San Francisco Bay, bound for a rendezvous with Convoy 2019.

Hampered by the typical foggy conditions surrounding the bay area, assembly took some time, but ultimately, with all units present and accounted for, the convoy set out for the Hawaiian Islands. &quot;Anderson&quot; covered the entry of the ships into the Pearl Harbor channel shortly before noon on 2 February.

&quot;Anderson&quot; spent the next two weeks either at or operating locally from Pearl Harbor. Her underway periods included a turn at the Pearl Harbor entrance patrol (11–12 February) and duty screening as that ship conducted gunnery exercises on 14 February.

Underway at 0817 on 16 February, &quot;Anderson&quot; stood out to sea, joining up with Task Force 17 (TF17), consisting of &quot;Yorktown&quot;, , &quot;Louisville&quot;, &quot;Hammann&quot;, &quot;Sims&quot;, and &quot;Walke&quot;, under Rear Admiral Frank Jack Fletcher, later that afternoon. The next two weeks found the &quot;Yorktown&quot; task force working its way toward the southwest Pacific. On 6 March 1942, TF 17 rendezvoused with TF 11 under Vice Admiral Wilson Brown, to raid the Japanese stronghold of Rabaul.

While Brown&#x27;s and Fletcher&#x27;s ships were en route to that area, however, Australian reconnaissance planes detected a Japanese invasion force moving toward the settlements of Lae and Salamaua, on the eastern coast of New Guinea. Both fell with little resistance, but the incipient enemy base, and the airfields at both places, presented the Allies with a fine new target, and a chance to get back at the enemy at his most vulnerable time – before he had consolidated his beachhead. The raid on Rabaul was shelved.

To provide security for the carriers&#x27; operations in the Gulf of Papua, Brown detached a surface force to remain in the waters of the Louisiade Archipelago, near Rossel Island, to intercept any enemy thrust toward Port Moresby and cover the arrival of Army troops scheduled to arrive at about that time at Nouméa, New Caledonia. He placed this force, &quot;Astoria&quot;, , &quot;Louisville&quot;, , &quot;Anderson&quot;, &quot;Sims&quot;, &quot;Hammann&quot;, and &quot;Hughes&quot;, under Rear Admiral John G. Crace, Royal Australian Navy. While the patrol proved uneventful for Grace&#x27;s ships, which rejoined TF 11 on 14 March, the Lae-Salamaua raid carried out by planes from &quot;Yorktown&quot; and &quot;Lexington&quot; forced the Japanese to husband carefully their amphibious resources, already on the proverbial &quot;shoestring&quot;, for their planned operations in the Solomon Islands.

&quot;Anderson&quot;, operated with &quot;Yorktown&quot; through late April, patrolling the Coral Sea as the sole barrier against Japanese expansion in that region, putting into Tongatapu, in the Tonga (or &quot;Friendly&quot;) Islands, late that month. With intelligence data indicating that the postponed movement against Tulagi, in the Solomons, was imminent—confirmed by the Japanese landing men and supplies there on 29 April and establishing a seaplane base on the heels of the retreating Australian garrison, TF 17 moved north to deal with this threat.

=====Battle of the Coral Sea=====
On 4 May, &quot;Anderson&quot;, her men &quot;anxious to get a chance to attack&quot; the enemy, screened &quot;Yorktown&quot; as she launched three attacks on the incipient base at Tulagi, the carrier&#x27;s planes sinking a destroyer and some small auxiliaries, at the relatively modest cost of only three aircraft (whose crews were later recovered).

Reinforced on 6 May by Rear Admiral Aubrey W. Fitch&#x27;s TF 11, Fletcher planned to meet the Japanese in the Coral Sea on 7 May, to stop the enemy thrust toward Port Moresby. On that day, each side attempted to strike blows with carrier aircraft; the Americans enjoying more success in that planes from &quot;Yorktown&quot; and &quot;Lexington&quot; sank . Japanese planes, attempting to strike the Americans, could not find them in the gathering darkness, and a twilight encounter between the returning Japanese air groups and American fighters robbed the enemy of experienced crews as well as virtually irreplaceable aircraft. &quot;Anderson&quot;, assigned to the Air Group (TG 17.5), operated in the screen of &quot;Lexington&quot;.

The Japanese Striking Force, however, formed around and was, on 7 May, well south of Guadalcanal. The same day that American planes had dispatched &quot;Shōhō&quot;, planes from the enemy carriers sank &quot;Sims&quot; and damaged so severely that she had to be sunk later.

The next morning some separated the two forces. The Americans struck first, crippling &quot;Shōkaku&quot;; anti-aircraft fire and combat air patrol aircraft soon decimated &quot;Zuikaku&quot;″s air group. Meanwhile, the American carriers had taken divergent courses as the incoming Japanese strike neared them, &quot;Yorktown&quot;, &quot;Lexington&quot;, and their respective screens drawing three or four miles apart; &quot;Anderson&quot; continued to screen &quot;Lexington&quot;. About 1116 on 8 May, the first of the Japanese planes came in on the attack, which lasted until 1200. During the attack, &quot;Anderson&quot; maintained station on &quot;Lexington&quot;, constantly firing at the enemy, but scoring no hits. With the exception of one burst of machine gun fire, the destroyer was not attacked, the enemy concentrating his attack on &quot;Lexington&quot;.

&quot;Lady Lex&quot; took two hits on the port side. Then, Aichi D3A &quot;Val&quot; dive bombers punctured her with near misses and staggered her with two direct hits. A bomb smashed into the port forward gun gallery, and another exploded inside the carrier&#x27;s funnel. During the afternoon her fires were brought under control and her list corrected. But the explosions had ruptured her gasoline pipes, and about 1445 a series of explosions occurred, setting off internal fires. &quot;Anderson&quot; stood by to render assistance and pick up survivors as the big carrier was abandoned, and rescued 377 men. Eventually, had to sink &quot;Lexington&quot; with torpedoes.

The first battle fought with neither side sighting the other except from the cockpits of their respective aircraft, the engagement in the Coral Sea stopped the Japanese thrust toward Port Moresby. It was a strategic victory for the Allies, but a tactical one for the enemy, since the Japanese had inflicted heavier damage on the American carriers. Besides the loss of &quot;Lexington&quot;, &quot;Yorktown&quot; had been badly damaged.

On 10 May, &quot;Anderson&quot; transferred the 377 &quot;Lexington&quot; sailors to , and, the following day, put into Nouméa, New Caledonia, where she transferred five torpedoes to &quot;Phelps&quot;, which had expended torpedoes in attempting to sink Lexington. She sailed thence to Tongatapu, where she rejoined TF 17. On 28 May, she reached Pearl Harbor. Her rest, however, was to prove short, for forces were needed to thwart a new Japanese thrust, this one directed at Midway Island to draw out the United States fleet in a decisive battle. &quot;Anderson&quot; sortied again with TF 17 on 30 May, again in the screen for &quot;Yorktown&quot;, which had been hastily repaired.

=====Battle of Midway=====
On 4 June, Japanese planes struck the island of Midway with little opposition, and returned to their carriers to re-arm for a second strike. Confusion on the Japanese side as to what forces they found themselves facing proved fatal, as the American air attack from &quot;Yorktown&quot;, &quot;Enterprise&quot;, and caught the enemy at a vulnerable moment. While torpedo planes from the three carriers successively drew off the combat air patrols, dive bombers from &quot;Yorktown&quot; and &quot;Enterprise&quot; wrought mortal damage on three of the four enemy carriers engaged.

Planes from , the one enemy aircraft carrier that had escaped destruction that morning, soon sought out the Americans and located TF 17. Although decimated by TF 17&#x27;s combat air patrol, &quot;Val&quot; dive bombers managed to score damaging hits on &quot;Yorktown&quot;, causing her to go dead in the water. &quot;Anderson&quot;″s gunners claimed two Japanese planes downed as they retired from the scene. &quot;Yorktown&quot;, however, was underway again two hours later, her fires put out and power restored, and commencing to launch fighters when a second attack wave, this time composed of Nakajima B5N &quot;Kate&quot; torpedo planes, showed up. In the developing melee, &quot;Anderson&quot; shot down one &quot;Kate&quot; before it had a chance to launch its torpedo, but others managed to penetrate the terrific barrage and drop their ordnance, scoring two hits on the carrier&#x27;s port side amidships.

&quot;Anderson&quot;″s gunners claimed one of the retiring planes with a direct hit. As &quot;Yorktown&quot;, mortally wounded, slowed to a halt for the second time that day, &quot;Anderson&quot; picked up Ensign Milton Tootle, IV, USNR, a pilot from Fighting Squadron 3 (VF-3) who had been shot down attacking a Japanese torpedo plane. The destroyer then closed &quot;Yorktown&quot; and picked up 203 more men.

While TF 17 gathered &quot;Yorktown&quot;″s men and then cleared the area, the ship remained stubbornly afloat. When it became evident that the carrier would not sink immediately and might be saved, Admiral Fletcher ordered a salvage party put on board. Under tow by and with a salvage party on board composed of volunteers from the various ship departments, &quot;Yorktown&quot; appeared to be on the threshold of salvage. The arrival of , however, changed all that, and the gallant carrier was torpedoed on 6 June, along with &quot;Hammann&quot;. The latter sank immediately; &quot;Yorktown&quot; lingered until the following morning when she, too, sank.

&quot;Anderson&quot; returned to Pearl Harbor on 13 June. From 8–15 July she escorted to Midway, and from 22 to 27 July, she escorted to Palmyra Island and back to Pearl Harbor.

=====Guadalcanal=====
On 17 August, &quot;Anderson&quot; sortied from Pearl Harbor with TF 17, en route to the Solomons area, where she sighted and joined TF 61 on 29 August. &quot;Anderson&quot; was assigned as screen for &quot;Hornet&quot; in TG 61.2. The Battle of the Eastern Solomons, which had taken place on 24 August, had turned back a major Japanese attempt to recapture Guadalcanal. Enemy submarines, however, still lurked in the waters east of Guadalcanal. On 31 August, , in TG 61.1, was torpedoed and damaged, and forced to retire to Tongatapu. On 14 September, six transports carrying reinforcements and supplies for Guadalcanal departed Espiritu Santo, with the task groups formed around and &quot;Hornet&quot; in support.

Enemy submarines, however, again made their deadly presence felt. On 15 September, the torpedoed &quot;Wasp&quot;. At that time, &quot;Anderson&quot; was screening &quot;Hornet&quot;, about six miles (10 km) northeast of &quot;Wasp&quot;. A few minutes later, torpedoes were spotted racing toward &quot;Hornet&quot;, which maneuvered to avoid them. They passed ahead, one smashing into and the other into . &quot;Anderson&quot; was ordered to stand by the damaged battleship, and escorted her to Tongatapu on 19 September.

During the remainder of September 1942, &quot;Anderson&quot; escorted a Dutch convoy to Dumbea Bay, New Caledonia, then on 3 October sortied with TF 17 en route to launch an air attack against enemy vessels in the Buin-Faisi area. On 3 October, &quot;Anderson&quot; was detached to proceed to the rescue of a downed pilot. The pilot was not found, and since the task force was by that time too far away to enable her to rejoin before the mission was accomplished, she proceeded singly to Nouméa.

=====Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands=====
She rejoined TF 17 on 8 October, and on 15 October, received orders to proceed north to the Guadalcanal area to strike enemy forces in order to relieve pressure there. &quot;Hornet&quot; launched strikes on 16 October, and on 24 October the force joined with TF 16 to form TF 61. On 26 October, the American ships engaged a numerically superior Japanese striking force in the Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands. Contact between the two opposing forces, as at Coral Sea, was almost simultaneous. During the day planes from &quot;Enterprise&quot; and &quot;Hornet&quot; damaged two enemy carriers, a cruiser, and two destroyers. American ship casualties, however, were considerably heavier.

At 1010 on that morning some 27 planes attacked &quot;Hornet&quot;. &quot;Anderson&quot; opened fire, scoring hits on two planes, and splashing one. One bomb hit &quot;Hornet&quot;″s flight deck, then a &quot;Val&quot; crashed the ship. A moment later two &quot;Kates&quot; swept in, launching torpedoes which hit the carrier&#x27;s engineering spaces. As she slowed to a halt, she was hit by three more bombs and another &quot;Val&quot;. During this melee, &quot;Anderson&quot; succeeded in downing another torpedo plane, scored hits on several others, and took one machine gun bullet hit causing a small crack and dent in her side plating amidships.

At noon, attempted to take &quot;Hornet&quot; in tow, but at 1815, another flock of enemy dive-bombers and torpedo planes roared in to attack the crippled carrier. A veritable sitting duck, she took a torpedo and a bomb hit, and abandoned ship. &quot;Anderson&quot; moved in to pick up survivors, taking on board 247 men. was ordered to sink the hulk, and scored three torpedo hits, but Hornet remained stubbornly afloat. &quot;Anderson&quot; was ordered to finish the job and slammed six torpedoes into the target, but she still remained afloat. &quot;Anderson&quot; and &quot;Mustin&quot; shelled &quot;Hornet&quot;, but the arrival of Japanese destroyers on the horizon forced the two American destroyers to take a hurried a departure. On the morning of 27 October, Japanese destroyers performed the final rites for &quot;Hornet&quot; with four torpedoes.

During the Japanese attack on Hornet, the &quot;Enterprise&quot; group over the horizon had not gone unscathed. was sunk inadvertently by torpedo from a Japanese submarine while rescuing a downed pilot; &quot;Enterprise&quot; suffered three bomb hits; was severely damaged by a suicider; and both and suffered minor damage from bomb hits. Although the American forces had suffered heavier damage, they had succeeded in stopping the Japanese thrust toward Guadalcanal.

In November 1942, &quot;Anderson&quot; participated in further operations in the waters off Guadalcanal, screening a transport group landing troops in Lunga Roads and providing call fire during landings on 4 to 6 November, and screening &quot;Enterprise&quot; during strikes against enemy shipping at Guadalcanal on 13–14 November.

From December 1942 to 23 January 1943, the ship operated with TF 16 out of Espiritu Santo on antisubmarine patrol and training. Between 23 January and 3 February, she escorted Task Unit 62.4.7 (TU 62.4.7), a merchant ship convoy, to Guadalcanal to unload, and returned to Espiritu Santo. While in the Solomons, she conducted a photographic reconnaissance and bombardment of enemy-held beaches on northern coast of Guadalcanal on 29 January in company with .

&quot;Anderson&quot;, continued to operate out of the New Hebrides Islands on hunter-killer missions, and escort runs for a fueling rendezvous with TF 67 and TF 68 until 7 March 1943. She arrived at Pearl Harbor on 22 March and received onward routing back to the United States. From 9 April to 8 June, she lay at San Francisco undergoing overhaul and repairs.

Following an escort run to Pearl Harbor and back in June, &quot;Anderson&quot; departed San Francisco on 11 July with TG 96.1 en route to Kodiak, Alaska, arriving on 21 July. Joining TG 16.17 on 30 July, she participated in bombardments of Kiska on 2 and 15 August 1943. The ship remained in the Aleutians on patrol duty until 21 September, when she departed for Pearl Harbor.

From 14 October to 1 November, &quot;Anderson&quot; lay at Wellington, New Zealand, staging with the transports for the next operation. With TF 53, she arrived at Tarawa Atoll on 19 November 1943. As a part of Fire Support Group No. 3, she took station off the eastern end of Betio on D-day, 20 November, and began conducting bombardments of assigned targets. Betio was captured by 24 November, but &quot;Anderson&quot; remained in the general area on radar picket patrol and rendered intermittent call fire until 29 November, when she departed for Pearl Harbor.

=====Battle of Kwajalein=====
By 21 December 1943, she was back in San Diego to escort the 4th Marine Division to Kwajalein. En route, &quot;Anderson&quot; was one of the units designated to conduct a diversionary strike at Wotje on 30 January 1944. As one of the leading destroyers she opened the bombardment at 0642 and began to maneuver to avoid enemy return fire. At 0646, a shell hit in her combat information center (CIC), killing the commanding officer, Lieutenant Commander John G. Tennent, III, two ensigns, and three enlisted men, and wounding 14 others. Her executive officer immediately assumed command and kept her firing until she could maneuver to seaward to act as antisubmarine screen until completion of the Wotje bombardment at noon. The next day, &quot;Anderson&quot; approached the objective islands of Roi and Namur, Kwajalein Atoll, and screened to seaward as the heavy units began the bombardment. On 1 February, while transferring her wounded, she struck an uncharted pinnacle and had to be towed to Pearl Harbor.

Following the completion of repairs on 15 June, the destroyer sailed to the southwest Pacific. Following an escort run to Oro Bay, New Guinea, &quot;Anderson&quot; arrived off Cape Sansapor, New Guinea, on 1 August with TG 77.3. During the landing operations she operated on antisubmarine station between Amsterdam Island and Cape Opmarai, then conducted patrols off Woendi Harbor, and Cape Sunsapor until 25 August. During the Morotai landings on 15 September 1944, the ship rendered call fire and conducted patrols off White beach.

=====Battle of Leyte Gulf=====
On 12 October, &quot;Anderson&quot; departed Seeadler Harbor with TG 78.2 for the landing operations at Leyte Gulf. Arriving in the area on 20 October, she took up patrol during the initial assault and until she joined TG 77.2 on 25 October. This group was under enemy air attack and &quot;Anderson&quot; fired on several planes without results. On 1 November, enemy air attacks were intense. The ship scored hits on several planes, splashing one. At 1812 on that day, a Nakajima Ki-43 &quot;Oscar&quot; fighter crashed into the ship&#x27;s port side, aft of the break in the deck. &quot;Anderson&quot; suffered 14 dead and 22 wounded. Two of the wounded later died.

Departing Leyte on 3 November 1944 and steaming via Hollandia, Manus, and Majuro, &quot;Anderson&quot; arrived at Pearl Harbor on 29 November 1944. There she received orders to proceed to San Francisco, where she moored on 9 December to begin repairs.

=====Duty off Japan=====
On 11 May 1945, she arrived at Attu Island, Alaska where she was assigned to TG 92.2. Eight days later, &quot;Anderson&quot; took part in a bombardment of Suribachi Wan and a sweep in the Sea of Okhotsk. From 10 to 12 June, she participated in the bombardment of enemy shore installations on Matsuwa To, Kuril Islands, and another anti-shipping sweep in the Sea of Okhotsk. While the remainder of the task group entered that body of water to intercept an enemy convoy headed south from Paramushir from 23 to 25 June, &quot;Anderson&quot;, &quot;Hughes&quot;, and established a patrol east of the Kurils to thwart any attempt of the convoy to escape into the Pacific. From 15 to 22 July, &quot;Anderson&quot; conducted a patrol east of the Kurils, an anti-shipping sweep in the Sea of Okhotsk, and another bombardment of Suribachi Wan, Paramushiru To, Kuriles. Another sweep was made in the Sea of Okhotsk, coupled with another bombardment of Matsuwa To, Kuriles, on 11–12 August 1945.

&quot;Anderson&quot; remained with the Northern Pacific Force for the remainder of the war, and departed Alaskan waters for Japan on 27 August. She reached Ominato, Japan, on 8 September, and supported the occupation of northern Honshū through 30 October. She departed Japanese waters on that date, bound for the United States, and arrived at San Diego on 1 December. She was earmarked for retention in an inactive status in view of the experimental tests to which she would be subjected. Two days after Christmas, she got underway for Hawaiian waters.

===Post-War===

====Operation Crossroads====
Arriving at Pearl Harbor on 3 January 1946, &quot;Anderson&quot; was assigned to Joint Task Force 1 on 15 May, and was slated to be utilized in the tests of the atomic bomb at Bikini Atoll. She reached her ultimate destination on 30 May 1946.

On 1 July 1946, the bomb used in Test &quot;Able&quot; Operation Crossroads sank &quot;Anderson&quot; in Bikini lagoon. Her name was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 25 September 1946.

<doc id="924841" wikidata="Q828039" url="?curid=924841" title="Greater Romania Party">
<text>The Greater Romania Party (, PRM) is a Romanian far-right political party. Founded in May 1991 by Eugen Barbu and Corneliu Vadim Tudor, it was led by the latter from that point until his death in September 2015. The party is sometimes referred to in English as the Great Romania Party.

It briefly participated in government from 1993 to 1995 (in Nicolae Văcăroiu&#x27;s cabinet). In 2000, Tudor received the second largest number of votes in Romania&#x27;s presidential elections, partially as a result of protest votes lodged by Romanians frustrated with the fractionalisation and mixed performance of the 1996–2000 Romanian Democratic Convention (CDR) government. Tudor&#x27;s second-place position ensured he would compete in the second round run-off against former president and Party of Social Democracy in Romania (PDSR) candidate Ion Iliescu, who won by a large margin. Parallels are often drawn with the situation in France two years later, when far-right National Rally (RN) party leader Jean-Marie Le Pen similarly drew the second largest number of votes and was elevated, but nevertheless defeated, in the presidential run-off against Jacques Chirac.

Although Tudor clearly remained the central figure in the PRM, in March 2005 he briefly stepped down from the party presidency in favour of Corneliu Ciontu. A primary objective of the move was to provide the appearance of a shift toward the political center and to attempt to align PRM with the European People&#x27;s Party (EPP) bloc in the European Parliament. During this period the PRM also briefly changed its name to the &quot;Greater Romania&#x27;s People Party&quot;. EPP, however, rejected the PRM as a potential member. Tudor stated he refused to join the EPP because of its lack of identity. In June 2005, Tudor asserted that he had decided the new leadership had distanced itself from the founding principles of the party, and he sacked the new leadership and reverted the party&#x27;s name back to simply the &quot;Greater Romania Party&quot;. In November 2005, Ciontu, along with a small faction of the PRM, formed their own party, the People&#x27;s Party (PP), which has since merged with the New Generation Party (PNG).

In January 2007, with Romania&#x27;s accession to the EU România Mare&#x27;s five MEPs joined a group of far-right parties in the European Parliament that included the French National Rally (RN) and Austrian Freedom Party (FPÖ), giving them sufficient numbers to form an official bloc, called Identity, Tradition, Sovereignty. Though due to disagreements, they left the group a few months later, causing its collapse. PRM was also a founding member of Euronat.

==History and ideology==

The party was founded in 1991 by Tudor, who was formerly known as a &quot;court poet&quot; of communist dictator Nicolae Ceaușescu, and his literary mentor, the writer Eugen Barbu, one year after Tudor launched the &quot;România Mare&quot; weekly magazine, which remains the most important propaganda tool of the PRM. Tudor subsequently launched a companion daily newspaper called Tricolorul or Ziarul Tricolorul. The party claimed to be center-left and national. (The historical expression &quot;Greater Romania&quot; refers to the idea of recreating the former Kingdom of Romania which existed during the interwar period. Having been the largest entity to bear the name of &quot;Romania&quot;, the frontiers were marked with the intent of uniting most territories inhabited by ethnic Romanians into a single country; and it is now a rallying cry for Romanian nationalists. Due to internal conditions under Communism after World War II, the expression&#x27;s use was forbidden in publications until 1990, after the Romanian Revolution.) The party&#x27;s initial success was partly attributed to the deep rootedness of Ceaușescu&#x27;s national communism in Romania. The party was accused of promoting anti-Romani sentiments.

Both the ideology and the main political focus of the Greater Romania Party (PRM) are reflected in frequently strongly nationalistic articles written by Tudor. The party has called for the outlawing of the ethnic Hungarian party, the Democratic Alliance of Hungarians in Romania (UDMR), for allegedly plotting the secession of Transylvania.

PRM promotes the idea of a &quot;Greater Romania&quot; that would bring together all the territories populated by Romanians in neighboring countries (Ukraine and Moldova). It especially calls for the annexation of Moldova.

The party has praised and shown nostalgia for both the military dictatorship of Axis ally Ion Antonescu, whom they consider a hero or even a saint, and the communist regime of Ceaușescu. The party rejected the 2006 Tismăneanu report on the communist dictatorship in Romania as a manipulation of history.

In 2003, Tudor said he would no longer engage in discourse against Jews and Judaism or deny the Holocaust (&quot;see Corneliu Vadim Tudor&quot;). He also said that he had become, in his own words, a &quot;philo-Semite&quot;. In subsequent months he and some of his supporters travelled to Poland to visit the Auschwitz concentration camp; and, despite strong objections from the family of slain Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and many Jewish organisations, Tudor illegally erected a statue in memory of Rabin in the city of Braşov (for which he was found guilty and fined). During this period, Tudor hired Nati Meir, a Jewish advisor, who ran and won as a PRM candidate for the Romanian Chamber of Deputies. Tudor also hired an Israeli public relations firm, Arad Communications, to run his campaign.

In 2013, Friedrich Ebert Foundation described the party as neolegionary.

Economically, PRM proposes social-democratic measures, speaking of “the equality of chances for all citizens, human solidarity and family values” and of “the development of national economy as a condition for a decent living for all citizens” and being in favour of the state’s intervention in economy. 

In 2024, the current president of the party, Victor Iovici, declared that the party is &quot;centrist, with a patriotic orientation&quot; and that &quot;it collaborates with both left-wing and right-wing patriotic parties, as long as they are moderate and not extremist&quot;.

<text>Losing Isaiah is a 1995 American drama film starring Jessica Lange and Halle Berry, directed by Stephen Gyllenhaal. It is based on the novel of the same name by Seth Margolis. The screenplay is written by Naomi Foner Gyllenhaal. The original music score is composed by Mark Isham.

==Plot==

Khaila Richards (Halle Berry) is an African-American woman struggling with an addiction to crack cocaine. Desperate for drugs, she places her infant son, Isaiah, in a box and leaves him in an alley behind a crack house. She promises to come back for him later but passes out from a crack cocaine binge. The next day, Isaiah narrowly escapes death by a garbage truck and is rushed to the hospital, where doctors discover that he is also addicted to crack cocaine because of his mother using it while she was pregnant with him. Khaila later awakens and returns to the alley where she left Isaiah and is horrified to discover that he is gone.

While caring for Isaiah, Margaret Lewin, (Jessica Lange), a white social worker, grows increasingly fond of him. Eventually, she adopts Isaiah and brings him home to live with her, her husband, Charles (David Strathairn), and their daughter, Hannah. Meanwhile, Khaila is caught shoplifting and sent to rehab, unaware Isaiah is still alive.
Three years later, Khaila successfully completes her treatment and confesses to her case worker that she abandoned Isaiah in the alley. Without Khaila’s knowledge, the case worker investigates further and discovers that Isaiah is alive and was adopted by the Lewins. They hire a lawyer, Kadar Lewis (Samuel L. Jackson) to contest the adoption and help Khaila regain custody of him. An ugly court battle ensues with racial and social issues at the forefront. Kailah’s lawyer argues that Isaiah belongs with his biological mother and that the Lewins lack the cultural awareness to raise an African American son. The Lewins argue Kaihla is unfit due to her past drug addiction, abandoning Isaiah, and limited financial resources. In the end, the judge makes the difficult decision to overturn the adoption and return Isaiah to Khaila’s custody, much to the Lewins&#x27; horror and sadness.

After weeks pass, Isaiah does not consider Khaila his mother and struggles to adapt to the home she has created for him. He becomes increasingly withdrawn and prone to violent public outbursts. Eventually, Khaila, desperate for Isaiah&#x27;s happiness, asks Margaret to return to Isaiah’s life on a temporary basis; however, she insists she will also continue to be involved for the foreseeable future. The two mothers embrace each other, both proclaiming their equally strong motherly love for Isaiah. The two mothers then begin together playing building blocks with their beloved boy in a classroom.

==Cast==
==Production note==
Susan Sarandon turned down the role of Margaret Lewin.

==Reception==
On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 45% of 29 critics&#x27; reviews are positive, with an average rating of 5.1/10. The website&#x27;s consensus reads: &quot;Losing Isaiah makes an admirable attempt to tackle complex, worthwhile themes, but loses sight of effective storytelling during a descent into melodrama.&quot;

<doc id="924859" wikidata="Q6779686" url="?curid=924859" title="Mary Guiney">
<text>Mary Guiney (née Leahy, 2 March 1901 - 23 August 2004) was an Irish businesswoman and centenarian, best known as the long serving chairperson of Clerys &amp; Co.

==Early life and education==
Mary Leahy, known as May in her youth, was born 2 March 1901 at the family farm at Creeves, near Shanagolden, County Limerick. Her parents were John and Hannah Leahy (née Cuddihy) and it is believed she had an older brother and sister, a younger sister and two younger brothers. Her family sent her to the Dominican College in Eccles Street in Dublin. After she left school, she gained employment in Guineys &amp; Co. on Talbot Street, owned by Denis Guiney.

==Career==
Leahy married widower Denis Guiney on 19 October 1938, in the St Mary&#x27;s Pro-Cathedral, Dublin. She became a partner in the business, with the couple overseeing the flourishing of their shop at 79-80 Talbot street. This success allowed them to purchase the department store Clerys &amp; Company on Dublin&#x27;s main street, O&#x27;Connell Street, after it went into receivership in 1941. After buying Clerys, they formed a new limited company, Clery &amp; Co. (1941), in August 1941 and Mary Guiney became one of just two directors, alongside her husband, in a move unusual for the time.

Despite the timing of their takeover, during World War II, she was noted as a &#x27;keen businesswoman&#x27;, with Clerys seeing an increase of 1,000% in turnover. The Guineys invested in the store, installing 42 sales counters over the shop&#x27;s four floors, as well as a ballroom, two restaurants and three bars. Clerys was credited by some with keeping numerous Irish small suppliers in business during the war, emergency and afterwards, and having a positive effect on the Irish economy more broadly.

Clerys became known for its major sales, which took place twice a year. During the first sale, in 1941, O&#x27;Connell Street was blocked with traffic, and £100,000 was taken in its first week. Owing to Guiney&#x27;s strong religious belief, Clerys hosted many charity events, in particular for elderly or isolated Dublin residents. Beginning in 1954, Clerys provided afternoon tea with entertainment for 100 older people. By 1967 the store had over 1,000 employees and was drawing in thousands of customers from across Ireland.

Denis Guiney died in 1967, and after contesting some provisions of her husband&#x27;s will, which had attempted to distribute his shares widely among relatives, Guiney retained control of their business with a 52% shareholding, also taking the roles of managing director and chairperson of the board. Mary Guiney remained MD until 1977, while Denis Guiney&#x27;s nephew, Arthur Walls, took over the day-today running of the stores.

==Later life==
Guiney nearly died in May 1974, when Guineys on Talbot Street was caught in Dublin and Monaghan bombings.

Over time, Guiney gave relatives positions within the business, some senior, but continued to retain a controlling stake and resisted suggestions to sell the company or major assets. Among the sales she refused was a takeover bid from Dublin serial entrepreneur John Teeling in 1987, and a failed buyout bid in 1999 by Clerys&#x27; general manager, Tom Rea. She commented on the Teeling bid: &quot;Why would I want to sell the best business and building in Ireland?&quot; Until the age of 99, Guiney visited the shop and attended board meetings. She signed the company&#x27;s annual accounts until 2004, when she was 103, making her potentially the oldest active company director in Ireland or the United Kingdom.

According to some, Guiney was seen as not making the most of the opportunities which arose during the Irish boom economic years in the late 1990s. In later years, Guiney continued to resist changes in the business, which some think damaged the store and hindered its ability to garner new or younger customers.

In 1999 she sold her house, the Victorian-era &quot;Auburn&quot; on the Howth Road in Clontarf, for £4 million; the house was demolished and the site intensively developed. Guiney moved to The Meadows in Raheny.

==Death==
Guiney died in Beaumont Hospital on 23 August 2004. Following a funeral mass in St Anthony&#x27;s Church, Clontarf, Guiney was buried alongside her husband, and his first wife, Nora Gilmore, in Glasnevin Cemetery. Following her death, her shares were left to a family trust, and later distributed to several members of the extended Guiney family. The Guineys had no children but there were legacies beyond the shares for three nieces, while Guiney&#x27;s house and a substantial legacy were left to her friend and housekeeper, and over 25,000 euro each for the parish priest of St Anthony&#x27;s, Clontarf, and for the saying of masses in six churches.

<text>Clerys was a long-established department store on O&#x27;Connell Street in Dublin, Ireland, a focal point of the street. The business dates from 1853, however the current building dates from 1922, the original having been completely destroyed in the 1916 Easter Rising. Clerys completed a five-year restoration programme in 2004 at a cost of €24 million but went into receivership in 2012, and was sold. Under American ownership, it abruptly closed in 2015, and issues arose with staff and franchise holders over an extended period afterwards.



As of 2024, a renovation project has been underway for some years, converting the layout from that of a department store to that of various businesses operating under the same roof, including a hotel and multiple eating places. The launch of the new &quot;Clerys Quarter&quot;, as it is called, has been delayed multiple times, from autumn 2022, then spring 2023, autumn 2023 and Christmas 2023. Most recently is forecast for March 2024.

The Clerys commercial group eventually also included three &quot;At Home With Clerys&quot; homewares stores in out-of-town retail parks at Blanchardstown, Leopardstown and Naas; and a more economic department store Guiney and Co. on Talbot Street, (a different company to the Michael Guineys chain) at 79-80 Talbot Street; all of which closed during the 2012 receivership. There had formerly been a fashion-only outlet in The Square, Tallaght but this had already closed by the time of the 2012 receivership.

The history of Clerys began in May 1853 when Mac Swiney, Delany and Co. opened ‘The New or Palatial Mart&#x27; on the site of the present store in what was then Sackville Street. In 1883, the premises was taken over and renamed by M. J. Clery (died 1896), a native of Bulgaden, County Limerick. William Martin Murphy was also involved in the business.

Clerys was bought out of receivership in 1941 by Denis Guiney (1893–1967) for £250,000. The receivers were Craig Gardner &amp; Co.
Denis Guiney died in 1967, and his widow Mary Guiney (née Mary Leahy) continued to be chairperson until her death on 23 August 2004 at the age of 103 years.

==Second receivership and Gordon Brothers==
Clerys was bought out by Gordon Brothers, and split into a property-holding and an operating company, after being placed in receivership on 17 September 2012; joint receivers Paul McCann and Michael McAteer of Grant Thornton said the store’s future could be secured, and it did indeed operate for several years after this.

==Closure==
Kieran Wallace and Eamonn Richardson were appointed joint provisional liquidators to OSC Operations Limited (the &quot;Company&quot;) trading as Clerys, on 12 June 2015. The company ceased to trade with immediate effect.

Staff were given 30 minutes&#x27; notice to pack up and leave, some having worked there for over 40 years. The Clerys operating business was sold for €1, but the building, which was in a property holding company, was sold for €29 million to the Natrium Investment Group. Disputes with staff and franchise operators continued for several years. Paddy McKillen&#x27;s Oakmount and Europa Capital coming on board to redevelop the site, and with architects Henry J Lyons trying to keep as much of the original design (based on Selfridges&#x27; in London) as possible.

==Clerys Clock==
A large clock with two faces hangs above Clerys&#x27; central doors on O&#x27;Connell Street (opposite the statue of Jim Larkin). &quot;Under Clerys&#x27; clock&quot; is a well-known &quot;rendez-vous&quot;, both for Dubliners, and visitors from the countryside, and is famous in the city&#x27;s culture as a place where many romances begin. 1990, on the fiftieth anniversary of Denis Guiney taking over the store, a new clock was installed.

==Clerys Quarter==
Plans to redevelop the main Clerys building and adjoining properties into a mixed-use development of offices, retail and leisure called Clerys Quarter were announced, with to commence in 2019. Press Up Entertainment (run by Paddy McKillen Jr and Matt Ryan, and known for a number of pubs, bars and hotels as well as Wowburger and Tower Records Ireland) announced that they would operate a boutique hotel, to be called The Clery, to include a rooftop bar and a restaurant.

Work was due to begin in early 2019 and the launch of the Clerys Quarter has been announced and delayed multiple times. After delays related to COVID-19, it was ultimately scheduled to open for Christmas 2021, but in October 2021, this was moved to September 2022., with this blamed on &quot;lockdowns and a shortage of labour and building supplies&quot;. In January 2022, this was revised to mid-2022, and then &quot;for Christmas season 2022&quot;. In January 2023, an exhibition about the shop&#x27;s history was held, as the building was stated to be &quot;completed within weeks&quot; and to open pre-summer. The opening was moved to autumn 2023, and it was later announced that it would launch ahead of Christmas 2023, with one food outlet actually opening. The next part of the complex, including a sports supply shop, is now due to open in March 2024.

The Guiney &amp; Co. building on Talbot Street remains closed as of 2023.

==Guiney and Co. and the Michael Guineys chain==
Guiney and Co was Clerys&#x27; discount department store located at 79-80 Talbot Street, not far from one of the Michael Guineys Dublin stores at 83 Talbot St. Even though the two stores were run by separate companies, the latter chain was founded by a nephew of Denis Guiney called Michael, who had been working as the buyer of household goods and furnishings at Clerys, before setting up his own Dublin store in 1971.

<text>The longitude of the ascending node, also known as the right ascension of the ascending node, is one of the orbital elements used to specify the orbit of an object in space. Denoted with the symbol Ω, it is the angle from a specified reference direction, called the &quot;origin of longitude&quot;, to the direction of the ascending node (☊), as measured in a specified reference plane. The ascending node is the point where the orbit of the object passes through the plane of reference, as seen in the adjacent image.

==Types==
Commonly used reference planes and origins of longitude include:
* For geocentric orbits, Earth&#x27;s equatorial plane as the reference plane, and the First Point of Aries (FPA) as the origin of longitude. In this case, the longitude is also called the right ascension of the ascending node (RAAN). The angle is measured eastwards (or, as seen from the north, counterclockwise) from the FPA to the node. An alternative is the local time of the ascending node (LTAN), based on the local mean time at which the spacecraft crosses the equator. Similar definitions exist for satellites around other planets (see planetary coordinate systems).
* For heliocentric orbits, the ecliptic as the reference plane, and the FPA as the origin of longitude. The angle is measured counterclockwise (as seen from north of the ecliptic) from the First Point of Aries to the node.
* For orbits outside the Solar System, the plane tangent to the celestial sphere at the point of interest (called the &quot;plane of the sky&quot;) as the reference plane, and north (i.e. the perpendicular projection of the direction from the observer to the north celestial pole onto the plane of the sky) as the origin of longitude. The angle is measured eastwards (or, as seen by the observer, counterclockwise) from north to the node., pp. 40, 72, 137; , chap. 17.

In the case of a binary star known only from visual observations, it is not possible to tell which node is ascending and which is descending. In this case the orbital parameter which is recorded is simply labeled longitude of the node, ☊, and represents the longitude of whichever node has a longitude between 0 and 180 degrees., chap. 17;, p. 72.

==Calculation from state vectors==
In astrodynamics, the longitude of the ascending node can be calculated from the specific relative angular momentum vector h as follows:

:formula_1

Here, n = ⟨&quot;n&quot;x, &quot;n&quot;y, &quot;n&quot;z⟩ is a vector pointing towards the ascending node. The reference plane is assumed to be the &quot;xy&quot;-plane, and the origin of longitude is taken to be the positive &quot;x&quot;-axis. k is the unit vector (0, 0, 1), which is the normal vector to the &quot;xy&quot; reference plane.

For non-inclined orbits (with inclination equal to zero), ☊ is undefined. For computation it is then, by convention, set equal to zero; that is, the ascending node is placed in the reference direction, which is equivalent to letting n point towards the positive &quot;x&quot;-axis.

<doc id="924875" wikidata="Q7271524" url="?curid=924875" title="Question P">
<text>Question P was a Baltimore City referendum issue on the November 5, 2002, General Election ballot in which voters overwhelmingly approved reducing the size of the Baltimore City Council from 18 council members to 14 members, each to be elected by a different local district.

==Background==
Question P was approved by the voters of Baltimore, Maryland, U.S., in November 2002 and took effect in the 2004 election. The ballot initiative proposed &quot;that the City Council consists of 14 members, each to be elected from a different district, and a Council President, to be elected Citywide.&quot; Baltimore City had previously had six council districts, each electing three council members. These 18 members, plus one City Council President elected at-large made up the body&#x27;s 19 seats, cut from 21 to 19 in 1967. Question P amended the City Charter, restructuring the Council into 14 single-member districts, and retained the provision for an at-large Council President to be elected to preside over the body and function as a 15th member in voting.

==In favor of Question P==
The effort to gather the 10,000 signatures required to put Question P on the ballot was spearheaded by Community and Labor United for Baltimore (CLUB), a grassroots coalition of community groups and labor unions. Members of CLUB included organizations such as the League of Women Voters, —a national association for labor unions of public sector employees, and &#x27;s Baltimore chapter—a collection of local community organizations that advocate for low-income families and people living in poverty.
Two members of the Maryland legislature from Baltimore City, Delegates Jill P. Carter and Curt Anderson, also supported Question P. Both Carter and Anderson did radio commercials that aired on Baltimore radio stations prior to the election.
CLUB&#x27;s position was that approving Question P would save City taxpayers money by eliminating redundant positions, increase the transparency and accountability of Council members, and make it easier for less-established candidates to get elected.

==Opposition to Question P==
Council members who opposed Question P attempted to add an alternative measure to the ballot, Question Q, which was worded very similarly and also proposed cutting the number of city council seats from 19 to 14, but the retained larger, multi-member districts. According to &quot;Baltimore Sun&quot; reporter Laura Vozzella, &quot;Critics accused [council members] of trying to sabotage the coalition plan and save their $48,000-a-year part-time jobs, since the two measures [...] likely would have canceled each other out if both passed.&quot;

==Outcome==
In late September 2002, a Court of Appeals judge ruled in favor of CLUB&#x27;s lawsuit and removed Question Q from the ballot because Shiela Dixon had violated the City&#x27;s Open Meetings Act (Maryland Rule 15-505) by holding a closed-door committee meeting in August 2002 without giving public notice as required by law. At the private meeting, Council decided to put Question Q on the ballot, which led to Question .

Despite the disapproval of City Council President Sheila Dixon and Mayor Martin O&#x27;Malley, Question P passed with more than two thirds (67%) of the vote.

<doc id="924887" wikidata="Q5616562" url="?curid=924887" title="Guineys">
<text>Guineys (), is a chain of Irish department stores founded in June 1971. The chain specialises in homewares, menswear, womenswear and children&#x27;s clothing. They have 11 stores in Ireland, located in Dublin, Limerick, Waterford, Castlebar, Tralee, Cork, Clonmel, Mullingar, Kilkenny, and, as of December 2018, one in Northern Ireland, at Castle Place in central Belfast. It is well known for having its two Dublin stores almost within sight of each other - one on North Earl Street and one on Talbot Street, two streets which run directly into each other, off O&#x27;Connell Street.

==History==
The company was registered on as Michael Guiney Limited. The chain was solely Dublin based until 1992 when a branch in Cork was opened. Other branches followed in Tralee and Waterford (2004).

The Limerick store was opened in late 2004, occupying the long vacant anchor tenancy of what was previously the Williamscourt Mall on William Street. The Castlebar store opened in December 2008.

Guiney&#x27;s launched their online store in 2012 which delivers to homes and businesses in the Republic of Ireland. A store was opened in Clonmel in December 2013 then the Mullingar and Kilkenny stores opened in 2015.

The store that opened in December 2018 at Castle Place in central Belfast was the first Guiney&#x27;s anywhere in the nine counties of Ulster, and is located in a unit which once housed a British Home Stores branch until August 2016.

==Michael Guiney==
Michael Guiney came from Limerick and had been working for his uncle Denis Guiney as the buyer of household goods and furnishings at Clerys, before setting up his own Dublin store under the Guineys name in 1971. For many years there were three shops on Dublin’s Talbot Street all with the name Guiney in the name, as Michael&#x27;s stores were joined on the street by Guineys &amp; Co at 79-80 Talbot Street, set up by Clerys/Denis Guiney and in operation until 2012.

==Stores==
As of 2022 Guineys has twelve stores located in Leinster, Munster, Connacht &amp; Ulster, with two in Dublin.

<text>Peter &quot;Peja&quot; Rutger Lindholm (born 2 June 1970 in Östersund, Sweden) is a retired Swedish curler. Before Niklas Edin, many regarded him as the best European skip ever.

Over his two-decade curling playing career, Lindholm won three World Championships as a skip, winning in 1997, 2001 and 2004, and also being runner up in both 1998 and 2000. He is also a two-time European Champion (1998 and 2001) and is a former World Junior Champion (). He had constant disappointment in his career though at the Olympics, where despite being one of the gold medal favorites in each of the 1998, 2002, and 2006 Games, his team ended up medalless, coming closest in 2002 with a 4th place finish.

One thing he was known for was amazing success against and being the career nemesis of Kevin Martin, even running up a streak of 10 consecutive wins at one point which was broken in the semi-finals of the 2002 Olympics. He also had an excellent record vs. the all-time great team of Randy Ferbey in the 2000s.

Lindholm announced his retirement from curling following the 2007 European Curling Championships.

==Coaching career==
In 2011, Lindholm became the coach of the Swedish men&#x27;s team skipped by Niklas Edin, coaching them in the World Championships. He also coached the Swedish women&#x27;s team at the 2010 World Championship. He then became the Swedish national coach in 2010 when Fredrik Lindberg became the team coach.

He was also either the Coach or Captain of Team Europe at the Continental Cup each time it was held from 2008–2015.

Lindholm left his position with the Swedish teams 2019 when he was recruited to lead the Chinese teams over the Olympic Games 2022 in Beijing. He was then asked to coach the Danish women team at the European Championship. It became a success since the team won the gold.

in 2023 Lindholm became the CEO for Östersunds Fotbollsklubb.

==Awards==
* Colin Campbell Award: 1995
* WJCC Sportsmanship Award: 
* WJCC All-Star skip: , 
* WJCC All-Star second: 
* In 1998 he was inducted into the Swedish Curling Hall of Fame.

<text>MARPAT (short for Marine pattern) is a multi-scale camouflage pattern in use with the United States Marine Corps, designed in 2001 and introduced from late 2002 to early 2005 with the Marine Corps Combat Utility Uniform (MCCUU), which replaced the Camouflage Utility Uniform. Its design and concept are based on the Canadian CADPAT pattern. The pattern is formed of small rectangular pixels of color. In theory, it is a far more effective camouflage than standard uniform patterns because it mimics the dappled textures and rough boundaries found in natural settings. It is also known as the &quot;digital pattern&quot; or &quot;digi-cammies&quot; because of its micropattern (pixels) rather than the old macropattern (big blobs).

The United States government has patented MARPAT, including specifics of its manufacture. By regulation, the pattern and items incorporating it, such as the MCCUU and ILBE backpack, are to be supplied by authorized manufacturers only and are not for general commercial sale, although imitations are available such as &quot;Digital Woodland Camo&quot; or &quot;Digital Desert Camo&quot;.

MARPAT was also chosen because it distinctively identifies its wearers as Marines to their adversaries, while simultaneously helping its wearers remain concealed. This was demonstrated by a Marine spokesman at the launch of MARPAT, who stated: &quot;We want to be instantly recognized as a force to be reckoned with. We want them to see us coming a mile away in our new uniforms.&quot; As such, the U.S. Marine Corps restricts use of the camouflage, preventing its use in most other divisions of the United States military with the exception of some elements of the U.S. Navy.

==Development==
MARPAT was designed by Timothy O&#x27;Neill, Anabela Dugas, Kenneth G. Henley, John Joseph Heisterman Jr., Luisa DeMorais Santos, Gabriel R. Patricio, and Deirdre E. Townes.

The concept of using miniature swatches of color as opposed to large splotches is not new. In World War II, German troops used various patterns similar to the current German &quot;Flecktarn&quot;, which involved similar small dabs of color on a uniform to provide camouflage.

The Canadian Forces originally developed the pattern called CADPAT, on which MARPAT was based. O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s USMC design team in charge of this process, initially with the assistance of Kenneth G. Henley and then John Joseph Heisterman Jr. (both active duty U.S. Marine Scout Snipers), went through over 150 different camo patterns before selecting three samples that met their initial objectives. These were two versions of tigerstripe and an older design of Rhodesian Brushstroke. The influence of tigerstripe can still be seen in the final MARPAT. These three samples were then reconstructed using new shapes and unique color blends that would allow a more effective uniform in a great range of environments.

The new patterns were then field tested in different environments, day and night, with night vision and various optics. MARPAT did exceptionally well in their wet uniform test when viewed with night vision while illuminated with IR, where normally patterns appear as a solid. The MARPAT patent lists U.S. Army research into fractal pattern camouflage as the basis for MARPAT.

The MARPAT pattern was chosen in a run-off against seven other patterns at the USMC Scout Sniper Instructor School.

Preliminary development of MARPAT began in April 2000, with field testing of the pattern and the MCCUU beginning in 2001. The patent for the MARPAT pattern was filed on 19 June 2001, whereas the patent for the MCCUU uniform was filed on 7 November 2001. Early prototypes of the MARPAT desert pattern from 2001 featured grey, whereas the finished product did not.

In 2001, Marine Forces Pacific Lt. Gen. Frank Libutti and Sgt. Maj. Stephen Mellinger were the first Marines to publicly wear the uniform before the uniform made its official debut at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina on 17 January 2002. In February 2003, MARPAT-patterned helmet covers began to be produced. The replacement of the BDU and DCU by the MCCUU was completed on 1 October 2004, a year ahead of the original requirement date set in 2001 of 1 October 2005.
The MARPAT uniform was officially fielded as standard issue to the officer candidates of OCC-181 at MCB Quantico and the recruits of 3rd BN Mike Company at MCRD San Diego in late 2002;It continues to be the USMC&#x27;s standard issue uniform pattern to date.
In all, the MARPAT development process from concept to completion took 18 months, the fastest time for a U.S. military-developed camouflage pattern to be produced.

==Design and colors==
Different ratios and variations of colors were tested before final candidate patterns were actually printed to textile for field trials. A modified version of Vietnam War–era tiger stripe also made it to final trials but was eliminated due to MARPAT being superior in all environments. The purpose of the digitized pattern is to create visual &quot;noise&quot; and prevent the eye from identifying any visual templates. Thus, the pattern is intended to not register as any particular shape or pattern that could be distinguished.

There were initially three MARPAT patterns tested: Woodland, Desert, and Urban. While keeping the rights for Urban, only the Woodland and Desert patterns were adopted by the Marine Corps for general issue, replacing the U.S. Woodland pattern and the U.S. Three-Color Desert pattern. Webbing and equipment worn with MARPAT Woodland and MARPAT Desert is produced in Coyote Brown, a mid-tone color common to both the woodland and desert patterns. Although a digital snow pattern has also been adopted on cold-weather training over-garments, this uses a different pattern from the Canadian company Hyperstealth.

Authentic MARPAT material is distinguishable by a miniature &quot;Eagle, Globe, and Anchor&quot; emblem incorporated into the pattern above the letters &quot;USMC&quot;, in both the woodland and desert patterns.

==Similar designs==

MARPAT is aesthetically similar to Canadian Forces CADPAT, which was first developed in the 1990s.

The United States Army used the same shapes in designing its Universal Camouflage Pattern, which uses a much paler three-color scheme of sage green, grey and sand for use on the Army Combat Uniform. After major questions about its effectiveness arose, the Army adopted the &quot;Scorpion W2&quot; Operational Camouflage Pattern in 2015, which was fully phased in by 2019.

The United States Air Force designed its own Airman Battle Uniform (ABU) using a standard tiger stripe pattern and slight variation on the color scheme of ACU. It was also phased out by the OCP uniform by 2021.

The United States Navy announced approval for a digital &quot;BDU-style&quot; work uniform in late 2008. The Navy Working Uniform (NWU) was chosen by surveyed sailors for consistency and longer life, while the blue-grey-black Type I pattern was designed for aesthetic purposes rather than camouflage to disguise them at sea. In January 2010, the Navy began considering new Navy Working Uniform patterns modified from MARPAT, with a Type II desert pattern and Type III woodland pattern. The Woodland pattern was actually an earlier coloration of the MARPAT scheme, not adopted following USMC trials. These patterns are overall darker than their respective MARPAT equivalents, modified with different color shades. They were introduced because the blue and grey Type I pattern was not meant for a tactical environment (the Battle Dress Uniform in M81 woodland and Desert Camouflage Uniform were still used for this purpose until the Type II and III patterns were introduced). Backlash from Marines, including an objection from former Commandant Conway, led to restrictions when NAVADMIN 374/09 was released: Type II pattern is restricted to Naval Special Warfare personnel while deployed, while the NWU Type III is the standard shore working uniform for all Naval personnel effective 1 October 2019. The blue and grey Type I uniform was discontinued .

ARMPAT, an Armenian version of the MARPAT pattern, is currently used by the Armenian Armed Forces, and the Artsakh Defense Army. It has the same design as the MARPAT, but with different color sets.

<doc id="924920" wikidata="Q4137507" url="?curid=924920" title="Gerritsen Beach, Brooklyn">
<text>Gerritsen Beach is a neighborhood in the New York City borough of Brooklyn, located between Sheepshead Bay to the west and Marine Park to the east. The area is served by Brooklyn Community Board 15. The population of the neighborhood is 4,797 as of the 2020 U.S. census.

==History==

The neighborhood is named for Wolphert Gerretse, a Dutch settler, who, in the early seventeenth century, built a house and mill on Gerritsen Creek, which is now part of the nearby Marine Park neighborhood. The three-hundred-year-old mill was destroyed by fire in 1931. The famous Whitney family owned property by the mill and built a mansion. The Mansion had horse stables, servant quarters, a carriage house, and a private race track. The Mansion was knocked down in 1936 for the Marine Park Building Developments but the carriage house was still left standing. The Carriage house was converted into a private home that is still standing today.

Until the early twentieth century, the area remained undeveloped except for a few squatters’ bungalows clustered at the foot of Gerritsen Avenue. In 1920, Realty Associates, a speculative real-estate builder, began constructing a middle-class summer resort there. The southwestern section of Gerritsen’s meadow was soon covered to one-story bungalows with peaked roofs and no backyards. The popularity of this venture spurred further growth. Some bungalow-owners made them suitable for year-round habitation; others built two-story houses with backyards; and, within a decade, there were fifteen hundred houses in Gerritsen Beach. After WWII, there were apartments for returning veterans and their families. They were located on the opposite side of Gerritsen Avenue in what is now park land. They were demolished around 1955 after all the residents had relocated.

Almost all homes in the Gerritsen Beach area were damaged and/or affected by seawater on October 29, 2012, from Hurricane Sandy due to its peninsula characteristics. Almost all of the residents did not leave the neighborhood before the flooding began. The flood waters reached a record 10–12 ft in some parts of the neighborhood. A bar from Deep Creek Marina, two miles away, floated into the neighborhood, with bottles and seating intact. The damage was so severe that it led Mayor Michael Bloomberg to reclassify Gerritsen Beach as being in a Zone A flood zone.

==Geography==
Gerritsen Beach lies on a peninsula in the southeastern part of Brooklyn, south of the neighborhood of Marine Park and west of the eponymous park. It is bounded on the north by Midwood at Avenue U, to the east by Marine Park at Gerritsen Avenue, to the south by Plumb Beach and the Plumb Beach Channel, and to the west by Sheepshead Bay at Shell Bank Creek and Knapp Street.

It is bisected, from west to east, by the Gotham Avenue Canal. The area north of the canal, known as the &quot;new section&quot; by local residents, has traditional city streets lined with stores, brick houses, and wide sidewalks. The area south of the canal (the &quot;old section&quot;) is a popular spot for party and chartered fishing boat berths. The typical size of the land lots in the community are in the old section, in the new section, and on the waterfront. The streets in Gerritsen Beach are in alphabetical order (that is, Aster, Bevy, Celeste, Dictum, etc.).

==Community==
The neighborhood has a large Irish-Catholic presence in the community. A few long-standing residents of Irish descent refer to the community as being &quot;cois fharraige&quot;, which is an Irish language phrase meaning &quot;by the sea&quot;. The remaining percentage of the population is predominantly of Scandinavian, Italian and German descent.

==Education==
The neighborhood is the location of the New York City Department of Education&#x27;s Public School 277, an elementary school known as the Gerritsen Beach School. Brooklyn Blue-Feather School, 2335 Gerritsen Ave. is for special-needs children operates in the former Resurrection school building.

The Brooklyn Public Library&#x27;s Gerritsen Beach branch is located at 2808 Gerritsen Avenue. The library has been operating since the 1950s, though it moved to its current location, a structure, in 1997.

==Recreation==
The Gerritsen Ballfields, consisting of three baseball fields, two athletic fields for soccer or football, and one Little League field, are located on the east side of Gerritsen Avenue, in addition to a &quot;mini-airport&quot; for motorized model airplanes located at Seba Avenue and Gerritsen Avenue. In 1993, this site benefited from a $192,000 renovation sponsored by Borough Council Member Herbert E. Berman. Also, recreational fishing is very popular with citizens of the community, as anglers are found fishing along the shore at the southern end of Gerritsen Avenue and along the adjacent shoreline of the Gerritsen Creek-Marine Park &quot;salt marsh&quot;. The Gerritsen Creek estuary and the adjacent salt marsh is also a major spawning ground for various species of marine fish. Although riding quads is popular at this park, the activity is illegal everywhere in New York City and is destructive to the park&#x27;s fragile ecosystem.

==Police and crime==
Gerritsen Beach is patrolled by the 61st Precinct of the NYPD, located at 2575 Coney Island Avenue. 
The 61st Precinct ranked 5th safest out of 69 patrol areas for per-capita crime in 2010.

The 61st Precinct has a lower crime rate than in the 1990s, with crimes across all categories having decreased by 88.2% between 1990 and 2018. The precinct reported 1 murder, 17 rapes, 150 robberies, 170 felony assaults, 169 burglaries, 584 grand larcenies, and 72 grand larcenies auto in 2018.

==Fire safety==
===New York City Fire Department===
Gerritsen Beach is served by the New York City Fire Department (FDNY)&#x27;s Engine Co. 321/Foam 321/Brush Fire Unit 6, located at 2165 Gerritsen Avenue.

===Volunteer Fire Department===

The local Volunteer Fire Department (a.k.a. &quot;the Vollies&quot;), the last remaining volunteer fire department in Brooklyn, was organized in 1922 when Gerritsen Beach was a small summer-resort community. The name of the department is officially spelled Gerrittsen Beach Fire Department . In 1921, a damaging fire on Abbey Court demonstrated to the community that the city’s regular fire apparatus could not reach the beach in time to put out a fire. A mass meeting was called by the residents, and that resulted in the organization of the only volunteer fire department in Brooklyn.

Before the city added water mains under Gerritsen Beach streets, the Volunteers had to handle fires at least three times a week. The danger posed to Gerritsen Beach residents by fire was especially acute because most families relied on oil stoves and kerosene lamps, and the water to fight fires had to be pumped from wells. The city did not build Engine Company 321&#x27;s firehouse at Gerritsen Avenue and Avenue U until October 4, 1930.

Members of the fire brigade, currently known as the Vollies, were, in earlier times, nicknamed &quot;the Vamps&quot;. Members are not only trained to fight fires, but also to rescue people who are drowning and to assist in other medical emergencies. According to the Vollies 1976 anniversary booklet, the Vollies were approved by the New York State Department of Health as an Emergency Services Training Center. Although the community is now served by Engine Company 321, strong support for the &quot;Vollies&quot; continues.

The following historical events involved the Gerritsen Beach volunteers in actions outside their own neighborhood:
* The Vollies responded with medical aid to the victims of the jet airliner crash at 7th Avenue and Sterling Place, on December 16, 1960.
* Just three days after the New York air disaster, on December 19, 1960, the Vollies responded to the city’s call for assistance in fighting a blaze aboard the aircraft carrier USS Constellation (CV-64) at the Brooklyn Navy Yard.
* During heavy fog, the powerful beam of the department&#x27;s Mack searchlight is used at Kennedy Airport when requested.
* When there was a major oil fire in Mill Basin in 1962, the Vollies responded with foam to help put it out.
* On 9/11 The Vollies assisted FDNY Battalion 33 by temporarily relocating their apparatus to the Firehouse of Engine 321 on Gerritsen Avenue and Avenue U when E321 responded to the WTC. Doing so allowed the Vollies to cover the response areas normally covered by E321 such as Marine Park and Sheepshead Bay while continuing to provide service to the residents of Gerritsen Beach.
* During the blizzard of 2010, the department responded rapidly to Gerritsen Beach while the EMS system was heavily delayed.

<text>The Palouse are a Sahaptin tribe recognized in the Treaty of 1855 with the United States along with the Yakama. It was negotiated at the 1855 Walla Walla Council. A variant spelling is Palus. Today they are enrolled in the federally recognized Confederated Tribes and Bands of the Yakama Nation and some are also represented by the Colville Confederated Tribes, the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation and Nez Perce Tribe.

== Ethnography ==
The people are one of the Sahaptin-speaking groups of Native Americans living on the Columbia Plateau in eastern Washington, northeastern Oregon, and North Central Idaho: these included the Nez Percé, Cayuse, Walla Walla, Umatilla and the Yakama.

The Palouse (Palus) territory extends from the confluence of the Snake and Clearwater Rivers in the east to the confluence of the Snake and Columbia Rivers in the west. It encompassed the Palouse River Valley up to Rock Lake in the north and stayed north of the Touchet River Valley in the south. To the north, their territory bordered the Sinkiuse-Columbia, Spokane, and Coeur d&#x27;Alene; to the east, their territory bordered the Nez Perce; to the south, the Cayuse and Walla Walla; and to the west, they bordered the eastern boundary of the Yakama and Wanapum territories. The Palouse (Palus) lived in three main regional bands, composed of several village-based groups:

*Upper Palouse (Palus) Band: often formed bilingual village communities with the &quot;Almotipu Band&quot; and &quot;Alpowna (Alpowai) Band&quot; of the Nez Perce people, the Lewis and Clark Expedition referred to them as &quot;Chopunnish (Nez Percé)&quot;, their villages along the Clearwater River (from west to east) &quot;Pinăwăwi/Pinawa’wi (Penawawa)&quot; (&quot;coming out of bushy area to fish&quot;), &quot;Witkispe (Witkispu)&quot;, &quot;Wawawi/Wawáwi (Wawawai)&quot; (&quot;place of mosquitoes&quot;), &quot;Alamotin/Alamo’tin (Almota)&quot; (&quot;soaring flame&quot;) and &quot;Alpo’wa (Alpowa)&quot; (&quot;total area of fishing&quot;) were identified by Americans and in treaties as &quot;Nez Percé villages&quot; and therefore their lands were included into the Nez Perce Indian Reservation; today part of the &quot;Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation&quot; and &quot;Nez Perce Tribe&quot;. The &quot;Pinăwăwi/Pinawa’wi (Penawawa) Palouse&quot; were identified as &quot;Pinewewixpu (Pinăwăwipu) Nez Perce Band&quot;, the &quot;Witkispe (Witkispu) Palouse&quot; as &quot;Witkispu Nez Perce Band&quot;, the &quot;Wawawi/Wawáwi (Wawawai) Palouse&quot; as &quot;Wawawipu Nez Perce Band&quot;, the &quot;Alamotin/Alamo’tin (Almota) Palouse&quot; as &quot;Almotipu Nez Perce Band&quot;, and the &quot;Alpo’wa (Alpowa) Palouse&quot; as &quot;Alpowna (Alpowai) Nez Perce Band&quot;.
:Middle Palouse (Palus) Band: lived along the Palouse River, Lower Clearwater River and along the Tucannon River, their main village Pa-luš-sa/Palus at the junction of Palouse and Snake River about 4 mi (6 km) downstream from the Palouse Falls (&quot;Aputaput&quot; - &quot;Falling Water&quot;) gave its name to the entire Palouse tribe, often allies of the &quot;Pikunan (Pikunin) Band&quot; of the Nez Percé, the Lewis and Clark Expedition referred to them as the &quot;Pelloatpallah (Nez Percé)&quot;, the majority are now part of the &quot;Confederated Tribes and Bands of the Yakama Nation&quot;, a minority of the &quot;Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation&quot;.
*Lower Palouse (Palus) Band: lived along the Lower Snake River to its confluence with the Columbia River near the present-day Tri-Cities metropolitan area; the Lewis and Clark Expedition referred to them as &quot;Sokulks&quot; and &quot;Chymnapums&quot;; later historians also identified them as &quot;Nez Percé,&quot; now part of the &quot;Confederated Tribes and Bands of the Yakama Nation&quot;.

The ancestral people were nomadic, following food sources through the seasons. The Palus people gathered with other native peoples for activities such as food-gathering, hunting, fishing, feasting, trading, and celebrations that included dancing, sports and gambling. They lived near other groups including the Nez Perce, Wanapum, Walla Walla, Umatilla and Yakama peoples.

The present tribal designation probably derives from the proper designation of the most populous of the three regional bands of the Palouse/Palus people - the ″Middle Palouse/Palus Band″ as Palúšpam - &quot;people of Pa-luš-sa/Palus [one of their most important settlements]&quot;, the neighboring Nez Percé also called them &quot;Pa-loots-poo/Pelú`cpu/Peluutspu&quot; and the Yakama &quot;Palúuspam/Pelúuspem&quot; both meaning &quot;people of Pa-luš-sa/Palus&quot;, their proper autonym was Naxiyamtama or Naha’ámpoo/Naha&#x27;u&#x27;umpu&#x27;u - “the river people”.

The people were expert horsemen. The term Appaloosa is probably a derivation of the term &quot;A Palouse horse.&quot; They bred the horses for their distinct markings. In the latter half of the nineteenth century, the United States Army captured and slaughtered hundreds of tribal horses to cripple the tribe during the Indian Wars.

== History ==

In October 1805, Lewis and Clark met with the tribe, although most were away from the area for fall food-gathering and hunting. Lewis and Clark presented one of the expedition&#x27;s silver peace medals to paramount Chief Kepowhan. &quot;The Diaries of the Corps of Discovery&quot; describe the people as a separate and distinct group from the Nez Percé.

After Kepowhan, during the decades 1830&#x27;, 1840&#x27;, 1850, Wattaiwattaihowlis (Kepowhan&#x27;s son and probably principal chief), Kahlotus (known also as Quelaptip and Talatuche, chief of the Upper Palouse), Soei (chief of the Middle Palouse), Nehtalekin (called also Hahtalekin the Elder), Tilcoax (chief of the Lower Palouse), Hinmahtutekekaikt alias &quot;James&quot; (one among the first to be Christianized, friend to Henry H. Spalding and Marcus Whitman, often associated to the Nimiipu band of Hollolsotetote), were the leaders until the Isaac I. Stevens Treaty in 1855, when the Palouse refused to take part but sent, as observers, Kahlotus (already a good friend to Marcus Whitman), Tilcoax (a war chief) and Slyotze; &quot;Old&quot; Hathalekin and Tilcoax led the Palouse warriors against the U.S. troops during the Cayuse&#x27;s uprising in 1847–1848, defeating col. Cornelius Gilliam and his &quot;Oregon Volunteers&quot; on the Tucannon Creek (March 14–15, 1848). In 1858 Tilcoax led again the Palouse warriors in the &quot;Skitswish (Coeur d&#x27;Alene) War&quot;: in May 1858 the Palouses succeeded in taking possession of a herd of Army&#x27;s horses, but, on September 8, 1858, their own herd of 800 horses was slaughtered by col. George Wright&#x27;s soldiers, and they surrendered.

Husishusis Kute, chief of the Wawawai Palouse, and &quot;Young&quot; Hathalekin (also known as Taktsoukt Jlppilp), war-chief, led a small Palouse band as allies of the last free Nimiipu of Heinmot Tooyalaket alias &quot;Chief Joseph&quot;; &quot;Young&quot; Hathalekin died fighting on August 9, 1877, at Big Hole; Husishusis Kute surrendered with Heinmot Tooyalaket on October 5, 1877.

== Notable Palouse ==
Palouse Chiefs

* Tilcoax (&quot;Wolf Necklace&quot;) led the Palouse warriors during the Skitswish (Coeur d&#x27;Alene) war in 1858, fighting against Maj. Steptoe and Col. Wright troops.
* Husishusis Kute (&quot;Husis Husis Kute&quot;, &quot;Hush-hush-cute&quot; - “Bald Head”, “Naked Head”), was leader and &quot;tooat&quot; — Medicine man or Shaman, or Prophet — of the Wawawai Band. Its territory was along the Snake River below Lewiston, 50 miles up the Snake River from where the Palouse enters it. 

* Hahtalekin (also known as &quot;Taktsoukt Jlppilp&quot; - “Echo” or “Red Echo”), chief of the Palus Band (or Palus proper), who lived at the confluence of the Snake and Palouse rivers. His band were all of the buffalo-hunter-class. During the flight with the Nez Perce, his following was made up of 16 men.

<doc id="924924" wikidata="Q1424026" url="?curid=924924" title="Soviet Naval Aviation">
<text>Soviet Naval Aviation (AV-MF, ) was the naval aviation arm of the Soviet Navy.

== Origins ==
The first naval aviation units in Russia were formed in 1912–1914 as a part of the Baltic Fleet and the Black Sea Fleet. During World War I, the hydroplane units were used in the Black Sea for conducting aircraft reconnaissance, bombing and firing at coastal and port installations and enemy ships, and destroying submarines and enemy aircraft on the airfields.

== Civil War and Interwar Period ==
The regular Soviet naval aviation units were created in 1918. They participated in the Russian Civil War, cooperating with the ships and the army during the combats at Petrograd, on the Baltic Sea, the Black Sea, the Volga, the Kama River, Northern Dvina and on the Lake Onega. The newborn Soviet Naval Air Force consisted of only 76 obsolete hydroplanes. Scanty and technically imperfect, it was mostly used for resupplying the ships and the army.

In the second half of the 1920s, the Naval Aviation order of battle began to grow. It received new reconnaissance hydroplanes, bombers, and fighters. In the mid-1930s, the Soviets created the Naval Air Force in the Baltic Fleet, the Black Sea Fleet and the Soviet Pacific Fleet. The importance of naval aviation had grown significantly by 1938–1940, to become one of the main components of the Soviet Navy. By this time, the Soviets had created formations and units of the torpedo and bomb aviation. At the beginning of the Great Patriotic War, all of the fleets (except for the Pacific Fleet) had a total of 1,445 aircraft.

== Second World War ==
The Morskaya Aviatsiya (Naval Aviation) was the Soviet Navy&#x27;s air service during World War II. Such air units provided air support to the Voyenno-Morskoy Flot SSSR (Soviet Navy) in the theaters of operations in the Barents, Baltic and Black Seas and also to the Soviet Naval Detachment in the Sea of Okhotsk.

Russian Navy Aviation managed all land, shore and vessel-based (tender seaplanes and catapult vessels) hydroplanes and aircraft, as well as flying boats. The air units also conducted land operations in support of the Red Army during landings and disembarkations and served in special wartime operations. Naval Aviation provided some air cover to Allied convoys bringing equipment to Soviet forces from North Sea to the Barents Sea and via the Pacific Ocean to the Sea of Okhotsk.

In particular, Naval Aviation was deployed in defense of Odessa (June–October 1941), in operations in the Crimea and the Black Sea and carried out successful air strikes in the last stages of the conflict on the European and Pacific Fronts.

During the war, Naval Aviation delivered an immense blow to the enemy in terms of sunken ships and crews—two and a half times more than any other unit of the Soviet Navy. Seventeen naval aviation units were honored with the title of the Soviet Guards, while 241 men were awarded with the title of the Hero of the Soviet Union (including five pilots twice).

== Cold War ==
To attack surface ships at long ranges, the Soviet Navy was unique in deploying large numbers of bombers in a maritime role for use by Naval Aviation. The Kiev class of Soviet aircraft carriers was deployed in the late 1970s and carried up to 30 aircraft including Yak-38 VTOL fighters. The next class of Soviet aircraft carriers, named the Admiral Kuznetsov class, supported more conventional aircraft such as the Su-33 &quot;Flanker-D&quot; and the MiG-29 &quot;Fulcrum&quot;. Land-based aircraft such as the Tupolev Tu-16 &quot;Badger&quot; and Tu-22M &quot;Backfire&quot; bombers were deployed with high-speed anti-ship missiles. Previously believed to be interceptors of NATO supply convoys traveling the sea lines of communication across the North Atlantic Ocean between Europe and North America, the primary role of these aircraft was to protect the Soviet mainland from attacks by U.S. carrier task forces.

The last commander of Soviet Naval Aviation, Colonel-General Viktor Pavlovich Potapov, was appointed in 1988. With the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, its assets were inherited by successor states&#x27; forces, including Russian and Ukrainian Naval Aviation.

<text>The French term , literally translated, is &quot;the Quebec State&quot;.

The term &quot;State&quot; can refer to public authority, or a state apparatus, as in &#x27; &quot;a [[state-owned enterprise]], federal crown corporations (sociétés d’État)&quot;). &quot;State&quot; may be used to contrast the [[Government of Quebec|provincial government of Quebec]] with the private sector, or with the [[Government of Canada|federal government of Canada]], known as&#x27; or &quot;&quot;.

==Examples of use==
*&quot;L&#x27;État et le social au Québec&quot;, 1986, 

:&quot;Le fait que l&#x27;État ontarien occupe une place plus restreinte que l&#x27;État québécois dans la livraison des services sociaux ne semble pas signifier que le système des services sociaux, qui prévaut en Ontario, se trouverait à l&#x27;abri d&#x27;un certain nombre de problèmes qu&#x27;on retrouve dans les systèmes plus étatisés tel le système québécois.&quot;

:&quot;The fact that the Ontario State [&quot;l&#x27;État ontarien&quot;] plays a more restricted role than the Quebec State [&quot;l&#x27;État québécois&quot;] in the delivery of social services does not seem to mean that the social service system in place in Ontario is not sheltered from some of the problems found in more publicly run (&quot;étatisé&quot;, lit. &quot;statized&quot;) systems such as the Quebec one.&quot;

*&quot;Les sociétés d&#x27;État et les objectifs économiques du Québec: une évaluation préliminaire.&quot;, 1979, Pierre Fournier

:&quot;Ainsi, en 1975, neuf des cent plus importantes compagnies opérant au Québec selon le critère du nombre des employés étaient des sociétés d&#x27;État ou des filiales de sociétés d&#x27;État. Trois étaient des créations de l&#x27;état fédéral (le Canadien National, Air Canada et la Société Radio-Canada), une de la ville de Montréal (la Commission des transports de la Communauté urbaine de Montréal), et cinq de l&#x27;État québécois (l&#x27;Hydro-Québec, Sidbec, la Société des alcools, Forano et Marine Industries, ces deux dernières étant des filiales de la SGF).&quot;

:&quot;Thus, in 1975, nine of the hundred largest companies operating in Quebec by number of employees were state enterprises or their subsidiaries. Three were creations of the Federal State [&quot;l&#x27;État fédéral&quot;](Canadian National, Air Canada and the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation), one of the City of Montreal (the Montreal Urban Community Transit Commission) and five of the Quebec State [&quot;l&#x27;État québécois&quot;] (Hydro-Québec, Sidbec, the Société des Alcools (Society of Alcohol), Forano and Marine Industries, the last two being subsidiaries of SGF).&quot;

<text>George Kirgo (born George Blumenthal; March 26, 1926 – August 22, 2004) was an American screenwriter, author and humorist.

==Early life==
Kirgo was born George Blumenthal in Hartford, Connecticut, the middle child of three born to Russian immigrants Isadore and Anna Blumenthal. While attending Hartford Public High School, he worked as a movie usher and as a reporter for &quot;The Hartford Times&quot;; graduating in 1943, he was dubbed &quot;the Orson Welles of HPHS&quot; by his high school yearbook.

In April 1944, while attending Wesleyan University, Blumenthal enlisted in the U.S. Army Reserve, eventually serving in the USAAF during the final few months of World War II, in the South Pacific and Japan. It was sometime after his return, but before his brief emergence in the early 1950s as a small book seller and publisher, that Blumenthal became George Kirgo, officially adopting his erstwhile nickname.

==Career==
A screenwriter since 1954, Kirgo&#x27;s many credits encompass a wide variety of TV series, including &quot;Kraft Suspense Theatre&quot;, &quot;The New People&quot;, &quot;Run for Your Life&quot;, &quot;Room 222&quot;, &quot;Mary Tyler Moore&quot;, &quot;My Mother the Car&quot;, and &quot;The Feather and Father Gang&quot;. He scripted or co-scripted feature films such as &quot;Red Line 7000&quot;, &quot;Spinout&quot;, &quot;Don&#x27;t Make Waves&quot;, and &quot;Voices&quot; as well as TV movies such as &quot;Get Christie Love!&quot;, &quot;The Man in the Santa Claus Suit&quot;, and the &quot;American Playhouse&quot; production &quot;My Palikari&quot;. He was a producer for the short-lived 1978 situation comedy &quot;Another Day&quot;.

Kirgo also appeared onscreen on occasion, primarily in the early 1960s, with a flurry of talk and game show appearances between 1959 and 1964. The first of these came shortly after the publication of his first book, the comic novel &quot;Hercules, the Big Greek Story&quot;. Some glowing notices notwithstanding, not much notice was paid; nonetheless, the book impressed &quot;Tonight Show&quot; host Jack Paar sufficiently to secure Kirgo a guest spot; the ensuing appearance sufficed to earn the fledgling novelist several such invitations over the next two seasons. During this period, Kirgo published his second book, &quot;How to Write Ten Different Best Sellers Now In Your Spare Time and Become the First Author on Your Block Unless There&#x27;s an Author Already Living on Your Block in Which Case You&#x27;ll Become the Second Author on Your Block and That&#x27;s OK, too, and Other Stories&quot;. similarly satirical in nature, though this time non-fiction. On January 2, 1962, Kirgo made his daytime TV debut as one of the regular panelists, with Dennis James, on Monty Hall&#x27;s game show &quot;Your First Impression&quot;.

By mid-1964, the show was cancelled, but writing assignments, for both big screen and small, quickly filled the void. From that point on, for more than two decades, Kirgo&#x27;s screen appearances were confined to bit roles in a handful of TV shows and one feature film, &quot;The Best Man&quot;, a political drama scripted by Gore Vidal, in which Kirgo&#x27;s character interacts, albeit briefly, with the president of the United States, portrayed by Henry Fonda. It would be the early 1980s before Kirgo&#x27;s writing workload lessened, and it was not until 1987 that he was briefly resurrected as an on-air personality, the TV/movie critic for &quot;The Morning Program&quot;, CBS&#x27;s ill-fated alternative to ABC&#x27;s &quot;Good Morning America&quot; and NBC&#x27;s &quot;Today&quot;.

From 1987 to 1991, Kirgo was president of the Writers Guild of America, West, most notably during the contentious 150-day-long strike over compensation from home video sales, which took place between March and August 1988. He also served as vice president of the Writers Guild Foundation between 1995 and 2001. In addition, Kirgo helped script the WGAW&#x27;s Annual Awards show from 1979 through 1998, and from 1991 through 2001, he produced it.

In 1988, Kirgo received PEN Center USA&#x27;s president&#x27;s award, and, in 2001, the WGAW&#x27;s Morgan Cox Award, for his years of service to the Guild. Kirgo was also a founding member of the National Film Preservation Board of the Library of Congress.

==Death==
In 2004, following a long illness, Kirgo died at age 78, having lost his wife of 38 years (and mother of his three children), Terry Newell, nearly two decades earlier. He was survived by his second wife, Angela Wales, then director of the Writers Guild Foundation (previously executive director of the Australian Writers Guild), and three children from his first marriage – screenwriters/producers Dinah Kirgo and Julie Kirgo, and musician-songwriter Nick Kirgo. In addition, Kirgo left behind stepson Alec Perrin, his sister Rita Lapp, four grandchildren, niece Tyne Daly, and nephew Tim Daly.

<doc id="924954" wikidata="Q693747" url="?curid=924954" title="The Heroes of Telemark">
<text>The Heroes of Telemark is a 1965 British war film directed by Anthony Mann based on the true story of the Norwegian heavy water sabotage during the Second World War from &quot;Skis Against the Atom&quot;, the memoirs of Norwegian resistance soldier Knut Haukelid. The film stars Kirk Douglas as Dr. Rolf Pedersen and Richard Harris as Knut Straud, along with Ulla Jacobsson as Anna Pederson. It was filmed on location in Norway.

==Plot==
The Norwegian resistance sabotage the Vemork Norsk Hydro plant in the town of Rjukan in the county of Telemark, Norway, which the Nazis are using to produce heavy water, which could be used in the manufacture of an atomic bomb.

Rolf Pedersen, a Norwegian physics professor, who, though originally content to wait out the war, is soon pulled into the struggle by local resistance leader Knut Straud (based on Knut Haukelid), portrayed by Richard Harris. Rolf&#x27;s ex-wife Anna also becomes involved in the effort, and her relationship with Rolf reignites.

Rolf and Knut sneak out of Norway on a passenger steamship to Britain that they hijack so they can deliver microfilmed plans of the hydroelectric plant to the British, who are impressed by the information. Then the two return to Norway by parachute to plan a commando raid against the plant. When a British plane carrying a force of Royal Engineers to undertake the raid is shot down over Norway by the Germans, Pedersen and Straud lead a small force of Norwegian saboteurs into the plant. The raid is successful, but the Germans quickly replace and repair the equipment.

A Quisling (traitor) saboteur worms his way into the resistance group, after they debate whether to shoot him or not. He ends up escaping and betraying them, so that a German plane blows up their safe house. When the Nazis and the saboteur pursue Rolf and Knut, Rolf and the saboteur end up alone, and Rolf kills him.

When Rolf and Knut learn of German plans to ship steel drums of heavy water to Germany, they sabotage the ferry carrying the drums, and it sinks in the deepest part of a fjord. Rolf himself ends up on the ferry when he sees a resistance comrade&#x27;s widow and her young child getting aboard; Rolf improvises a &quot;game&quot; whereby all the children on board practise with lifejackets at the stern of the ship. Thus, when the ferry sinks, the children, and Rolf and the widow, are able to escape. Knut and Anna, in a small boat, come and help rescue passengers.

==Production==
Knut Haukelid wrote a memoir of the attack called &quot;Skis Against the Atom&quot; published in 1954. John Drummond wrote a novel based on the same story called &quot;But for These Men&quot;. Both books formed the basis of the screenplay.

The film was originally announced in 1963. It was made by Benton Film Productions, a company of director Anthony Mann and producer S. Benjamin Fisz. Financing came from America&#x27;s Allied Artists and Britain&#x27;s J Arthur Rank Productions.

Besides this sequence, the raids (Operations Grouse, Freshman and Gunnerside) and the final attack are filmed on-site, with mountainous and snowy Norwegian locations serving as a backdrop. Scenes early in the film when the main characters escape from occupied Norway were filmed around Poole and Hamworthy in Dorset, with the former Channel Islands ship TSS &quot;Roebuck&quot; playing the role of the hijacked steamer. SF &quot;Ammonia&quot; was used to represent the train ferry SF &quot;Hydro&quot; in the final fjord scenes. 

The movie was originally titled &quot;The Unknown Battle&quot; and was to have starred Stephen Boyd and Elke Sommer and be written by Ben Barzman. Later, Anthony Perkins was announced as a star, though he withdrew. Eventually Kirk Douglas signed as the lead. Cliff Robertson was mentioned as a possible co-star before Richard Harris came on board.

&quot;I hear they are spending five million dollars, so it&#x27;s got to be spectacular and that means more fiction and less fact&quot;, said Haukelid during filming.

Stephen Boyd later sued Mann for half a million dollars when funding for the initial project fell apart in early 1964. &quot;I missed out on four good roles and plenty of money when he signed me without financial backing and then dropped the project&quot;, said Boyd later. &quot;He asked me again later but I&#x27;d made other commitments, so Kirk Douglas and Richard Harris made it under another title.&quot;

==Differences from reality==
Unlike the scenes in the film, the saboteurs had already left the area when the bomb exploded. Also omitted is the death of 18 Norwegian civilians in the sinking and the rescue efforts of local fishermen.

==Reception==
It was amongst the 15 most popular films at the British box office in 1966. The film has a 67% rating in Rotten Tomatoes, based on six reviews, with an average rating of 6.10/10.

==Other versions==
Ray Mears made a documentary called &quot;The Real Heroes of Telemark&quot;. Despite mainly sticking to the factual evidence, some scenes in the documentary, like the film, were partly dramatised, focusing more on the survival skills involved in the operation.

The same story was also covered in the 1948 Franco-Norwegian film &quot;Kampen om tungtvannet&quot; (&quot;La bataille de l&#x27;eau lourde&quot; — &quot;The battle for heavy water&quot;). Quite faithful to the real events, it even had many of the original Norwegian commandos starring as themselves.

In 2015, the Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation showed a TV series called &quot;Kampen om tungtvannet&quot; (also known as &quot;The Heavy Water War&quot; or &quot;The Saboteurs&quot;) based on the events.

<doc id="924970" wikidata="Q1933107" url="?curid=924970" title="Point No. 1">
<text>Point #1 is the debut studio album by the American rock band Chevelle, released on May 4, 1999. It is the only Chevelle album released by Squint Entertainment and their only collaboration with producer Steve Albini. The album featured a notable single in its title track but achieved only minor success, especially compared to Chevelle&#x27;s major label follow-up in 2002.

==Background and recording==
After recording a demo, Chevelle played small concerts for three years until being signed to Steve Taylor&#x27;s independent Christian label Squint Entertainment. The band recorded for 17 days at Electrical Audio with producer Steve Albini, famous for his work with the likes of Nirvana, Cheap Trick, and PJ Harvey. According to Chevelle frontman Pete Loeffler, Albini gave their album an unrefined &quot;indie feel&quot; in which the recording process was essentially &quot;plug in, he hits record, and you play.&quot; Loeffler added, &quot;At the time I was shocked talking to someone who had worked closely to Kurt Cobain. It was a trip. It was really cool.&quot; &quot;Point #1&quot; was recorded in standard D with an alternative metal approach. However, the band was left unsatisfied and feeling that he didn&#x27;t achieve the tones and overall sound they were looking for. They called Albini and, much to his surprise, expressed disappointment with the final product. Although they enjoyed working with him, Chevelle wanted to find a different producer to resolve the issue; however, their label gave them no choice but to work with Albini once again. The second phase of recording was, according to Loeffler, much more laid back and relaxed in which Albini &quot;really opened up.&quot;

Largely thanks to Albini&#x27;s influence, &quot;Point #1&quot; is notably less intense than future Chevelle material; however, the album&#x27;s title track has remained a common part of the band&#x27;s concert set list. Nevertheless, the band&#x27;s major label debut, &quot;Wonder What&#x27;s Next&quot;, has since been regarded by the band as their &quot;first&quot; album.

==Touring and promotion==
Chevelle toured with various alternative metal bands to promote their debut album. This would influence their shift to a heavier sound on future albums.

Albini and an aspiring comedian named Fred Armisen starred in the band&#x27;s &quot;Point #1 EPK&quot; (electronic press kit)—several years before Armisen became famous on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;. A year after the album&#x27;s debut, a single was released in the title track which landed a marginal spot on the Mainstream Rock chart and had an accompanying music video. &quot;Mia&quot; had also been released as a single the year prior. It also had a video.

==Reception==
Critical reception for &quot;Point #1&quot; varied. Heather Phares of AllMusic gave a positive review, noting how Albini helped the band &quot;create forceful, mercurial indie rock&quot; and added &quot;In line with Chicago&#x27;s ambitious music scene, Chevelle&#x27;s challenging take on rock is also a rewarding one.&quot;

Chevelle received GMA Dove Awards for the more popular song &quot;Mia&quot; in 2000 and &quot;Point #1&quot; in 2001. The album also received an award for &quot;Hard Music Album&quot; in 2000 by the Dove Awards.

&quot;Point #1&quot; has earned Chevelle many comparisons to the successful rock band Tool. The music video for &quot;Mia&quot; was, like some of Tool&#x27;s videos, completely stop motion animated. Additionally, Pete Loeffler&#x27;s vocals, like those of Maynard James Keenan, range from soft and melodic to brutal and gut-wrenching. &quot;Long&quot;, for instance, is notable for Loeffler&#x27;s climactic twelve-second-long scream.

<doc id="924973" wikidata="Q2306943" url="?curid=924973" title="Vampire number">
<text>In recreational mathematics, a vampire number (or true vampire number) is a composite natural number with an even number of digits, that can be factored into two natural numbers each with half as many digits as the original number, where the two factors contain precisely all the digits of the original number, in any order, counting multiplicity. The two factors cannot both have trailing zeroes. The first vampire number is 1260 = 21 × 60.

== Definition ==
Let formula_1 be a natural number with formula_2 digits:

:formula_3

Then formula_1 is a vampire number if and only if there exist two natural numbers formula_5 and formula_6, each with formula_7 digits:

:formula_8
:formula_9

such that formula_10, formula_11 and formula_12 are not both zero, and the formula_2 digits of the concatenation of formula_5 and formula_6 formula_16 are a permutation of the formula_2 digits of formula_1. The two numbers formula_5 and formula_6 are called the &quot;fangs&quot; of formula_1.

Vampire numbers were first described in a 1994 post by Clifford A. Pickover to the Usenet group sci.math, and the article he later wrote was published in chapter 30 of his book &quot;Keys to Infinity&quot;.

== Examples ==
1260 is a vampire number, with 21 and 60 as fangs, since 21 × 60 = 1260 and the digits of the concatenation of the two factors (2160) are a permutation of the digits of the original number (1260).

However, 126000 (which can be expressed as 21 × 6000 or 210 × 600) is not a vampire number, since although 126000 = 21 × 6000 and the digits (216000) are a permutation of the original number, the two factors 21 and 6000 do not have the correct number of digits. Furthermore, although 126000 = 210 × 600, both factors 210 and 600 have trailing zeroes.

The first few vampire numbers are:

: 1260 = 21 × 60
: 1395 = 15 × 93
: 1435 = 35 × 41
: 1530 = 30 × 51
: 1827 = 21 × 87
: 2187 = 27 × 81
: 6880 = 80 × 86
: 102510 = 201 × 510
: 104260 = 260 × 401
: 105210 = 210 × 501

The sequence of vampire numbers is:

:1260, 1395, 1435, 1530, 1827, 2187, 6880, 102510, 104260, 105210, 105264, 105750, 108135, 110758, 115672, 116725, 117067, 118440, 120600, 123354, 124483, 125248, 125433, 125460, 125500, ... 

There are many known sequences of infinitely many vampire numbers following a pattern, such as:
: 1530 = 30 × 51, 150300 = 300 × 501, 15003000 = 3000 × 5001, ...

Al Sweigart calculated all the vampire numbers that have at most 10 digits.

==Multiple fang pairs==
A vampire number can have multiple distinct pairs of fangs. The first of infinitely many vampire numbers with 2 pairs of fangs:

:125460 = 204 × 615 = 246 × 510

The first with 3 pairs of fangs:
:13078260 = 1620 × 8073 = 1863 × 7020 = 2070 × 6318

The first with 4 pairs of fangs:
:16758243290880 = 1982736 × 8452080 = 2123856 × 7890480 = 2751840 × 6089832 = 2817360 × 5948208

The first with 5 pairs of fangs:
:24959017348650 = 2947050 × 8469153 = 2949705 × 8461530 = 4125870 × 6049395 = 4129587 × 6043950 = 4230765 × 5899410

== Other bases ==

Vampire numbers also exist for bases other than base 10. For example, a vampire number in base 12 is 10392BA45768 = 105628 × BA3974, where A means ten and B means eleven. Another example in the same base is a vampire number with three fangs, 572164B9A830 = 8752 × 9346 × A0B1. An example with four fangs is 3715A6B89420 = 763 × 824 × 905 × B1A. In these examples, all 12 digits are used exactly once.

<text>Cleyera japonica (sakaki) is a flowering evergreen tree native to warm areas of Japan, Taiwan, China, Myanmar, Nepal, and northern India (Min and Bartholomew 2015). It can reach a height of 10 m. The leaves are 6–10 cm long, smooth, oval, leathery, shiny and dark green above, yellowish-green below, with deep furrows for the leaf stem. The bark is dark reddish brown and smooth. The small, scented, cream-white flowers open in early summer, and are followed later by berries which start red and turn black when ripe. Sakaki is one of the common trees in the second layer of the evergreen oak forests. It is considered sacred to Japanese Shintō faith, and is one of the classical offerings at Shintō shrines including Tamagushi and masakaki .

==Uses==

Sakaki wood is used for making utensils (especially combs), building materials, and fuel. It is commonly planted in gardens, parks, and shrines.

Sakaki is considered a sacred tree in the Shinto religion, along with other evergreens such as and . Shinto shrines are traditionally encircled with constituting a . In Shinto ritual offerings to the , branches of sakaki are decorated with paper streamers (&quot;shide&quot;) to make &quot;tamagushi&quot;.

In the myth about &quot;Amaterasu&quot; and the cave she hid in, after &quot;Susanoo&#x27;s&quot; tantrum, when the &quot;Yata no Kagami&quot; was forged and propped-up in front of &quot;Amaterasu&#x27;s&quot; cave, it was said to have been perched-upon the branches of a sacred, 500-branched &quot;Sakaki&quot; tree facing the cave.

==Linguistic background==
The Japanese word &quot;sakaki&quot; is written with the kanji character , which combines (&quot;ki&quot;, &quot;tree; wood&quot;) and (&quot;kami&quot;, &quot;spirit; god&quot;) to form the meaning &quot;sacred tree; divine tree&quot;. The lexicographer Michael Carr notes:

In modern Japanese, &quot;sakaki&quot; is written with a doubly exceptional logograph. It is an ideograph (in the proper sense of &#x27;logograph representing an idea&#x27; rather than loosely &#x27;Chinese character; logograph&#x27;) and is a &quot;kokuji&quot; &#x27;Japanese [not Chinese] logograph.&#x27; Ideograms and &quot;kokuji&quot; are two of the rarest logographic types, each constituting a small percentage of a typical written Japanese sample. First, the idea of &quot;sakaki&quot; is expressed with a melding of &quot;boku&quot; or &quot;ki&quot; &#x27;tree&#x27; and &quot;shin&quot; or &quot;kami&quot; &#x27;god; divine, sacred&#x27; [of &quot;Shinto&quot; ]; comparable to a graphic fusion of the word &quot;shinboku&quot; &#x27;sacred tree.&#x27; Second, the &quot;sakaki&quot; ideograph is a &quot;kokuji&quot; &#x27;national [i.e., Japanese] logograph&#x27; rather than a usual &quot;kanji&quot; &#x27;Chinese logograph&#x27; borrowing. &quot;Kokuji&quot; often denote Japanese plants and animals not native to China, and thus not normally written with Chinese logographs. (1995:11) 

The kanji first appears in the (12th-century) &quot;Konjaku Monogatarishū&quot;, but two 8th-century transcriptions of the word &quot;sakaki&quot; are , meaning &quot;sage tree&quot; (&quot;Kojiki&quot;, tr. Chamberlain 1981:64 &quot;pulling up by pulling its roots a true &quot;cleyera japonica&quot; with five hundred [branches] from the Heavenly Mount Kagu&quot;), and , meaning &quot;slope tree&quot; (&quot;Nihon Shoki&quot;, tr. Aston 1896:42–43, &quot;True Sakaki tree of the Heavenly Mt. Kagu&quot;). &quot;Sakaki&quot; ( or ) is the title of Chapter 10 in &quot;The Tale of Genji&quot; (ca. 1021). It comes from this context.

&quot;May I at least come up to the veranda?&quot; he asked, starting up the stairs. The evening moon burst forth and the figure she saw in its light was handsome beyond describing. Not wishing to apologize for all the weeks of neglect, he pushed a branch of the sacred tree in under the blinds. &quot;With heart unchanging as this evergreen, This sacred tree, I enter the sacred gate.&quot; She replied: &quot;You err with your sacred tree and sacred gate. No beckoning cedars stand before my house.&quot; And he: &quot;Thinking to find you here with the holy maidens, I followed the scent of the leaf of the sacred tree.&quot; Though the scene did not encourage familiarity, he made bold to lean inside the blinds. (tr. Seidensticker 1976:187) 

The etymology of the pronunciation &quot;sakaki&quot; is uncertain. With linguistic consensus that the &quot;-ki&quot; suffix denotes (&quot;tree&quot;), the two most probable etymologies are either &quot;sakae-ki&quot; (&quot;evergreen tree&quot;), from ; or &quot;saka-ki&quot; (&quot;boundary tree&quot;), from – an older form of modern reading &quot;sakai&quot;, from the way that trees were often planted at a shrine&#x27;s boundary line. Carr (1995:13) cites Japanese tradition and historical phonology to support the latter etymon. The Shogakukan &quot;Kokugo Dai Jiten Dictionary&quot; entry for this term also notes that the pitch accent for &quot;sakayu&quot; () – the origin of modern &quot;sakae&quot; () – is different than what would be expected, suggesting that may be the more likely derivation (Shogakukan 1988).

<doc id="924981" wikidata="Q5159767" url="?curid=924981" title="Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation">
<text>The Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation () is the federally recognized tribe that controls the Colville Indian Reservation, which is located in northeastern Washington, United States. It is the government for its people.

The Confederate Tribes of the Colville Reservation consist of twelve individual tribes. Those tribes are: 

*Arrow Lakes (Lakes, Sinixt)
*Chelan
*Colville
*Entiat
*Nespelem
*Okanagan
*Methow
*Sinkiuse-Columbia
*Nez Perce
*Palus
*San Poil
*Wenatchi
The tribes&#x27; traditional territories in the Pacific Northwest once encompassed most of what is now known as eastern Washington state and extended into British Columbia, Idaho, and Oregon. Eight of these related bands are the names of rivers that flow off of the eastern slopes of the North Cascades or the Okanogan Highlands. Several of these rivers have small towns or communities where the rivers flow into the Columbia River. Beginning in the Southwest the rivers in order as you go north and then east are the: Wenatchee (Town of Wenatchee), Entiat (Town of Entiat), Chelan (Town of Chelan), Methow (Town of Methow, upstream of the confluence with the Columbia), Okanogan (Town of Okanogan, upstream of the confluence), Nespelem (Tribal community of Nespelem, upstream of the confluence), Sanpoil (Tribal community of Sanpoil, on the Sanpoil arm of Lake Roosevelt), and Colville (Town of Colville, upstream of the confluence). The Arrow Lakes are upstream on the Columbia River a little ways above the border in British Columbia. The Moses Coulee, Moses-Columbia, is an Ice Age canyon (coulee) just south of the Columbia River west of Coulee City on U.S. Highway 2. Not to be confused, Coulee City is located in the Grand Coulee, a similar and more famous Ice Age canyon that lies east of the Moses Coulee.

The Nez Perce are the descendants of Chief Joseph band which came from Northeast Oregon. As part of the conditions of surrender, Chief Joseph and his band were not allowed to return to their home in Oregon and were eventually re-located to the Colville reservation after the so-called &quot;Flight of the Nez Perce&quot; in 1877. The Nez Perce (not including the small group re-located to Colville) are located on the Nez Perce Indian Reservation in West central Idaho along the Clearwater River.

In 1872, the Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation was formed by executive order under President Ulysses S. Grant for the purpose of occupying the Colville Reservation. It was a large area encompassing a wide variety of habitats and resources. Later the reservation was reduced, and some of the best lands were excluded, made available for settlement by European Americans.

==Notable tribal members==
* Lucy Covington (1910-1982, Moses-Columbia), Native American Rights Activist
* Mourning Dove (author) (1888-1936, Okanagan), Native American writer
* Joe Feddersen (b. 1953, Okanagan), sculptor, painter, photographer, and mixed-media artist
* Chief Moses (1829-1899, Moses-Columbia), Native American Chief
* Lawney Reyes (1951-2022, Sinixt), artist, author, activist
* Luana Reyes (1933–2001, Sinixt), health care activist and educator
* Stella Runnels (1918-2010), nurse and activist who established the health clinic during the Occupation of Alcatraz.
* Bernie Whitebear (1937–2000, Sinixt), Native American rights activist

<text>Maria Antonieta Pons (November 6, 1922 – August 20, 2004) was a Cuban-born Mexican film actress and dancer. She was the first actress in the &quot;Rumberas films&quot; in the 1940s and 1950s, in the Golden Age of Mexican cinema. The Rumberas film genre offered a societal perspective on Mexico during the 40s-50s. It delved into the lives of women deemed as sinners or prostitutes, challenging the prevailing moral and social norms of their era.

==Career==
María Antonieta Pons began her career as a dancer in Cuba in numerous theaters and night clubs. When she was 16, she met Spanish actor and film director Juan Orol, who became her partner in various dance competitions on the island. After becoming Orol&#x27;s wife, he took her to Mexico so she could act in films.

María Antonieta Pons debuted in the Cinema of Mexico in the film &quot;Siboney&quot; (1938). After her debut in this film, Maria Antonieta performed with Orol in international dance tours in the United States, particularly in New York and Chicago. Towards the end of 1943, Pons returned to film, invited by the producer Guillermo Calderon to act in the film &quot;Noches de ronda&quot;, along with the actors Susana Guizar and Ramon Armengod. In the same year, she performed in the film &quot;Red Konga&quot; beside Pedro Armendáriz. Eventually, Pons returned to Orol&#x27;s films with &quot;Cruel destino&quot;. While still an employee of Orol, Pons began shooting other films with other directors. Highlights from these films are &quot;¡Viva mi desgracia!&quot; (1944), with Pedro Infante; &quot;Balajú&quot; (1944), along with Katy Jurado; and &quot;Rosalinda&quot; (1945), with Rafael Baledón, among others. Her last film with Orol was &quot;Pasiones tormentosas&quot; (1946).

After her break with Orol, Pons was hired by film producer Gregorio Wallerstein. Under the guidance of Wallerstein, she filmed movies like &quot;La reina del trópico&quot; (1946); &quot;La vida íntima de Marco Antonio y Cleopatra&quot; (1946), with the Argentine actor Luis Sandrini and directed by Roberto Gavaldón; &quot;La sin ventura&quot; (1947); &quot;Ángel o demonio&quot; (1947) and &quot;The Well-paid&quot; (1948), among others. In 1949, she performed in the second film version of &quot;La mujer del puerto&quot; (the first version was realized by the actress Andrea Palma in 1934), directed by Tito Davison.

Pons met her second husband, the actor and director Ramón Pereda in 1950, when he contracted her to film &quot;El ciclón del Caríbe&quot;. Pons and Pereda married soon after. With Pereda as director, Pons made films like &quot;La reina del mambo&quot; (1950), &quot;María Cristina&quot; (1950), &quot;La niña popoff&quot; (1952) and &quot;Casa de perdición&quot; (1954), among others. In 1952 she joined the Brazilian market with the film &quot;Carnaval Atlántida&quot; In the 1950s, she had famous film collaborations with Evangelina Elizondo in &quot;¡Que bravas son las costeñas!&quot; (1955); Antonio Espino &quot;Clavillazo&quot; in &quot;Nunca me hagan eso&quot; (1956); and with Germán Valdés &quot;Tin Tan&quot; in &quot;Teatro del crímen&quot; (1956), &quot;Las mil y una noches&quot; (1957), &quot;La Odalísca no. 13&quot; (1957), and &quot;Una estrella y dos estrellados&quot; (1959). 
Pons began alternating performances in films with performances in major theaters in Mexico City, like The Margo (today Blanquita) or the Follies Bergere.

With the decline of the Rumberas films, Pons retired from the cinema in the early sixties. Her last film was &quot;Caña brava&quot; (1965), alongside the singer Javier Solís.

===Retirement===
After &quot;Caña Brava&quot;, Pons&#x27;s public appearances were limited. Speculation regarding the location of her residence appeared: Los Angeles, Miami, and New York have been proposed. Starting in the 1970s, she refused to have contact with the public. When her husband Ramon Pereda died, her isolation was higher. She even refused to receive a Diosa de Plata Award. Her reason was: &quot;All that can be said of me, was reflected in my films&quot;. After the death of Ramon Pereda she remarried in 1989, this time to Benjamin Alvarez.

==Death==
María Antonieta Pons died in Mexico City on 20 August 2004. Pons had started to have mental lapses, but her death was caused by a heart attack. At her request, her death was announced after the funeral services had concluded. In several interviews, her widower denied that Pons was overweight, and held that she kept the statuesque figure that characterized her in her films. She is survived by her only daughter, Maria Guadalupe Pereda, from her second marriage.

<text>Old Sow is the largest tidal whirlpool in the Western Hemisphere, located off the southwestern shore of Deer Island, New Brunswick, Canada, and off the northeast shore of Moose Island, the principal island of Eastport, Maine. It is considered most visible and dangerous three hours after low tide.

==Origin==

The whirlpool is caused by local bathymetry and a tidal range where waters exchange between Passamaquoddy Bay and the Bay of Fundy, combined with the topography of the location&#x27;s sea floor at the confluence of the numerous local currents through channels and over small sea mounts.

The whirlpools form in an area with a diameter of approximately , as determined by the president of the Old Sow Whirlpool Survivors&#x27; Association in 1997 by way of an aerial photograph. The photograph was calibrated using the Deer Island Point Light beacon tower of known width that was included in the photograph.

Old Sow is one of five significant whirlpools worldwide (Corryvreckan, Scotland; Saltstraumen, Norway; Moskstraumen, Norway; and the Naruto whirlpools, Japan are the others). Although the tidal currents within Western Passage surrounding Old Sow compare with faster whirlpools elsewhere, the speed of Old Sow&#x27;s vortex is considerably slower than the Moskstraumen, the world&#x27;s most powerful whirlpool.

Tremendous water turbulence occurs locally in the greater Old Sow area, but it does not usually constitute a navigation hazard for motorized vessels with experienced operators at the helm; however, small craft—especially vessels with keels (sailboats) and human-powered vessels—are warned to avoid these waters when the tide is running.

Besides Old Sow and its numerous &quot;piglets&quot; (small and medium whirlpools surrounding Old Sow), other area phenomena include standing waves, upwellings (that on rare occasion may even spout several feet into the air), and deep or more, circular and trench-shaped depressions in the water.

The failed Passamaquoddy Tidal Power Project/&quot;Quoddy Dam&quot; Project saw a series of tidal dikes constructed during the 1930s to connect Moose Island (Eastport, Maine) to Carlow Island (in Eastport), Carlow Island to Pleasant Point and to connect Treat Island (in Eastport) to Dudley Island (in Lubec, Maine). The changes in local water flow from the dikes reportedly reduced predictability of the &quot;funnel&quot; effect of Old Sow.

==Accidents==
On March 28, 1830, a two-mast schooner was destroyed in the whirlpool drowning brothers Robert, James and William Stover whose widowed mother lived in Fairhaven. 

Around 1912, Cecil Chaffee of Eastport drowned while rowing near the whirlpool. In 1943 Eastport resident James Roland Mitchell Sr. drowned when the boom of his sailboat knocked him into the waters.

<doc id="925007" wikidata="Q4347" url="?curid=925007" title="Barefoot Gen">
<text>is a Japanese historical manga series by Keiji Nakazawa, loosely based on Nakazawa&#x27;s experiences as a survivor of the Hiroshima atomic bombing. The series begins in 1945 in and around Hiroshima, Japan, where six-year-old Gen Nakaoka lives with his family. After Hiroshima is destroyed by the bombing, Gen and other survivors deal with the aftermath. The series was published in several magazines, including &quot;Weekly Shōnen Jump&quot;, from 1973 to 1987. It was adapted into three live-action film versions directed by Tengo Yamada, which were released between 1976 and 1980. Madhouse released two anime films, one in 1983 and the other in 1986. In August 2007, a two-night live-action television drama series aired in Japan on Fuji TV.

Cartoonist Keiji Nakazawa created &quot;Ore wa Mita&quot; (translated into English as &quot;I Saw It&quot;), an eyewitness account of the atomic-bomb devastation in Japan, for &quot;Monthly Shōnen Jump&quot; in 1972. It was published in the United States by Educomics in 1982. Nakazawa began to serialize the longer, autobiographical &quot;Hadashi No Gen&quot; (&quot;Barefoot Gen&quot;) in the June 4, 1973 issue of &quot;Weekly Shōnen Jump&quot;. It was canceled after a year and a half and moved to three other, less-widely-distributed magazines: &quot;Shimin&quot; (&quot;Citizen&quot;), &quot;Bunka Hyōron&quot; (&quot;Cultural Criticism&quot;), and &quot;Kyōiku Hyōron&quot; (&quot;Educational Criticism&quot;). The series began to appear in Japanese book collections in 1975.

== Origins ==
Nakazawa was previously hesitant to publish an autobiographical account of the Hiroshima bombing. Much of his early work as an illustrator strayed far away from the topic of Hiroshima. However, his thoughts on the matter changed upon the death of his mother. After she was cremated, the bones that would usually remain were also turned to ash due to the radioactive cesium weakening her bones, which left Nakazawa distraught. This is what inspired him to finally face his past and start incorporating the bombings into his work. Nonetheless, his work still was not autobiographical for various reasons. He knew A-bomb survivors were often mistreated and looked down upon. He also worried that people would think he was trying to make a business off of his experiences. A mix of pressure from &quot;Shonen Jump&quot; editors and his increasingly pacifist views led him to finally begin to write his story in &quot;Barefoot Gen,&quot; with the first issue debuting in 1973.

==Plot==
===Volume 1: A Cartoon Story of Hiroshima===
The story begins in Hiroshima in April 1945. Six-year-old Gen Nakaoka and his family live in poverty, struggling to make ends meet. His father, Daikichi, urges them to &quot;be like wheat&quot; (which grows strong, despite being trodden on) and is critical of the war. When he is drunk at a mandatory combat drill and talks back to his instructor, the Nakaokas are branded as traitors and become subjects to harassment and discrimination by their neighbors. To restore his family&#x27;s honor, Gen&#x27;s older brother Koji joins the Imperial Navy against Daikichi&#x27;s wishes. He is subjected to a brutal training regimen by his commanding officer, which drives one of his friends to suicide. On August 6, 1945, an atomic bomb is dropped on Hiroshima. Daikichi and Gen&#x27;s siblings are killed in the fires, but he and his mother escape. The shock makes her give birth prematurely to Tomoko, his sister.

===Volume 2: The Day After===
In the days after the attack, Gen and his mother see the horrors wrought by the bomb. Hiroshima is in ruins, full of people dead and dying from burns and radiation sickness. Gen meets Natsue, a girl who strongly resembles his dead sister. Her face is severely burned; she tries to commit suicide when she realizes it, but Gen convinces her to continue living. Gen leaves her to find rice, and his mother adopts Ryuta, an orphan who looks just like his younger brother Shinji. After Gen returns to their burnt-out home and retrieves the remains of his father and siblings, he and his family move in with Kimie&#x27;s friend Kiyo. Kiyo&#x27;s stingy mother-in-law conspires with her spoiled grandchildren to drive the Nakaokas out, falsely accusing the children and Kimie of stealing rice the grandchildren had stolen.

===Volume 3: Life After the Bomb===
The family looks for housing in vain, since they cannot afford a place to stay. The remorseful Kiyo invites them back, but her mother-in-law demands rent. Gen looks for work to earn money. A man hires him to look after his brother Seiji, who has been burnt severely from head to toe and lives in squalor. Although Seiji is initially reluctant, he warms up to Gen over time. Gen learns that Seiji is an artist who has lost the will to live because his burns have left him unable to hold a brush. Gen helps Seiji learn to paint with his teeth, but the artist eventually dies of his injuries. On August 14, Emperor Hirohito announces Japan&#x27;s surrender over the radio. When Kimie needs a doctor, Gen cannot find anyone who will help without payment in money or food.

===Volume 4: Out of the Ashes===
After Japan&#x27;s surrender, American occupation forces began to arrive to aid rebuilding efforts. After hearing rumors about the Americans, Gen and Ryuta arm themselves with a pistol they find in an abandoned weapons cache. Their fears ease when the Americans give them candy, but they see a group of American soldiers harvesting organs from corpses for medical research. Kiyo&#x27;s mother-in-law again evicts Gen&#x27;s family after Gen fights with her grandchildren, forcing the family to move into an abandoned bomb shelter. Gen, Ryuta and their family are dying of malnutrition, and they try to kill a dog for food but cannot do it. Gen and Ryuta steal cans of what they think is American food, but are condoms. They steal from the Americans again, with help from local &quot;yakuza&quot;. The &quot;yakuza&quot; betray Gen and Ryuta, forcing Ryuta to kill two gang members. Impressed with Ryuta, Masa (leader of a rival gang) takes him in. Before escaping with the &quot;yakuza&quot;, Ryuta leaves money outside Gen&#x27;s door.

Gen returns to school, and he and a girl named Michiko are ridiculed for being bald. He defends Michiko, and is challenged to climb a tall tower; the first to return with a pigeon&#x27;s egg wins. As Gen and the bully climb, the tower starts to crumble beneath them and Gen saves the bully from falling. Michiko tells Gen that an American soldier had raped her sister, who afterwards became a prostitute to provide for Michiko. Gen returns home to find Tomoko missing.

Suspecting that the bully knows about Tomoko&#x27;s disappearance, Gen follows him and learns that he is using Tomoko to trick mothers dying of acute radiation syndrome into thinking that she is their missing child. Tomoko develops radiation sickness, and her doctor says she will die without an expensive American medicine. Gen and the kidnappers cannot raise the money, but Gen&#x27;s Korean neighbor Mr. Pak does. Gen returns to his family and finds Tomoko dead, but his hair is growing back.

===Volume 5: The Never-Ending War===
In December 1947, Ryuta (now a juvenile delinquent working for the &quot;yakuza&quot;) visits Gen. Gen follows Ryuta and meets several orphans including Katsuko, a girl physically scarred by the bomb. As an orphaned &quot;hibakusha&quot;, she cannot attend school. Gen lends Katsuko his books, promising to teach her. Masa teaches Ryuta and the other orphans to shoot because he wants them to kill Mitey, his rival. Donguri (one of the orphans) kills Mitey; Gen encourages the others to flee, but Masa follows them. Ryuta shoots Masa and his henchman. The orphans build a makeshift house with Gen, who lives with them with an old man cast away by his relatives for being too ill from radiation to work. Rice cakes are distributed on New Year&#x27;s Day to encourage cheers for Emperor Hirohito. Gen refuses to cheer because of his father&#x27;s beliefs and Hirohito&#x27;s decision to fight the war.

He learns that the local official who called Gen&#x27;s father a traitor for supporting peace and refused to help free Gen&#x27;s father, brother, and sister from their house when the bomb fell is running for office, claiming that he was always for peace. Gen enters a campaign meeting, exposes the official, and is thrown out.

Gen&#x27;s mother is ill and her doctor says her only hope is the American-run Atomic Bomb Casualty Commission (ABCC), but Gen and his mother refuse to accept American help at first. His mother then reluctantly goes to the ABCC, which offers no help apart from research. When Gen rescues a girl from bullies, he learns that her father collects victim bodies to sell to the ABCC. The commission rewards corrupt doctors with medicine in exchange for referrals, and Gen sees boys fishing skulls from the river to sell to the ABCC. He decides that surviving at American expense is justified, but teaches the other children to catch shrimp instead of skulls.

===Volume 6: Writing the Truth===
The Hiroshima orphans demonstrate their misery to American soldiers to sell the skulls of victims. They hope to buy lots of food, but a pickpocket robs them on the train. Huge bags of black-market food is thrown off the train they had just left. The orphans try to hide it, are caught, and escape the police.

Koji, working in the mines, is drinking and gambling. Gen returns home with the rice to find his mother very ill, but they cannot afford a doctor. Ryuta robs a casino to pay for Kimie&#x27;s treatment; the mob is after him, and he unsuccessfully tries to flee Hiroshima. He surrenders to the police.

In July 1948, Gen is tearing down a wall to collect bricks to sell. A girl has hanged herself because of radiation scars that made everyone treat her like a monster. Gen writes to Koji, asking for money for their mother&#x27;s hospital bills. He saves Natsue from suicide and brings her back to the orphans, asking Katsuko to watch her. Gen is falsely accused of theft. Natsue attempts suicide again, and Gen brings her and Katsuko to see someone sewing with her feet and mouth. They decide to learn to sew and open a clothing store.

Gen sees other orphans paid well for copper stolen from a shipyard. Gen and Musubi (another orphan) are caught by the shipyard owners, who want to kill them. They escape, fill their boat with too much copper, and it sinks. Gen and Musubi buy a sewing machine for Katsuko and Natsue. Four years after the bombing, people are still dying from radiation sickness.

===Volume 7: Bones into Dust===
Four years after the bombing, Gen is determined to get his novel published. No Japanese publisher will print it, and Ryuta suggests a prison. Gen asks from Mr. Pak for help, who is delighted to reveal the truth about what happened. Koreans suffered twice: from Japanese enslavement, and the bomb. He does not want money for his help. Since Ryuta cannot read, Gen reads the book to him. The descriptions of the effects of the bomb and the plea to ensure that nothing like it could happen again is too much for Ryuta, who begs him to stop.

A few days later, they are brought by American soldiers to an occupation base in Kure. A Japanese-American officer interrogates them about the book, since writing about the bomb in occupied Japan is illegal. A fellow prisoner explains that a special operations team will try to turn them into spies.

Gen, Ryuta, and Noro cannot escape. Gen wounds himself with a loose nail, smears the blood, and tells the others to act ill; they are released. A taxi driver is angry because someone has put sugar in his tank, ruining his livelihood. Gen asks Mr. Pak for sugar cubes to put American jeeps and trucks out of commission, creating work for Japanese mechanics.

He finds his mother home from the hospital, seemingly cured; however, Akira says that she has four months to live and does not know it. It is hard for Gen and Akira to pretend all is well. As she talks about her arranged marriage to their father, whom she grew to love, and how people who were against the war were tortured and killed even before it had started, Gen determines to earn money to send his mother to visit Kyoto one last time. He learns that collecting excrement for fertilizer is lucrative.

Koji arrives after hearing about their mother, ashamed of wasting the money he should have sent home, and Gen gives him the money he has earned so he can say he is taking them all to Kyoto. When they arrive, she says that she can now die happy and rejoin their father; she knew that she was not cured, since her stomach pain continued. When she dies, Gen refuses to have her cremated. He is determined to bring her body to Tokyo so that General MacArthur can see it, apologize for using the bomb, and promise to never do so again. He wants the Emperor – who declared war as a god, then admitted he was mortal when he lost – to apologize to her and take responsibility for the war. Koji has to knock him out to have their mother cremated, believing that one person cannot do this and all Japan must raise their voices together. Gen is desolate until he dreams of his parents, encouraging him to be like the wheat.

===Volume 8: Merchants of Death===
By June 25, 1950, Japan was threatened with involvement in the Korean War. Gen and his teacher, Mr. Ohta, want everyone to do all they can to prevent war; class president Aihara believes war is inevitable and necessary, and challenges Gen to a fight after school. He gives Gen a knife before Gen wins. 

The Americans outlaw antiwar protests, but Aihara&#x27;s skull is fractured. They learn that Aihara was also orphaned and was adopted by a woman he followed around because she resembled his mother. Dying of leukemia, he keeps trying to commit suicide because he cannot face death. Ryuta and Gen reinterest him in life by pitching a baseball outside his home, and Aihara pitches well.

They find Mr. Ohta drunk, and he buys them sake. He hates General MacArthur&#x27;s National Police Reserve, ostensibly to train police but actually to create an army to use in Korea. The Hiroshima police have announced that they will arrest anyone protesting the war. Gen gets drunk and plans for the anniversary of the bombing the following day; they all ring bells and pray for peace. Mr. Ohta supposedly resigns, and Gen sees someone injecting methamphetamine. During the war, soldiers received Philopon (the original brand name for methamphetamine). It is legal in Japan, and many people are addicted. Gen is drinking whiskey when Natsue develops appendicitis and needs to be hospitalized for two weeks. He finds Mr. Ohta shooting up, and learns that he did not resign — he was fired by MacArthur in the Red Purge. People are told that union activists are committing sabotage. Gen pleads with Mr. Ohta not to give up. The orphans chip in to pay Mr. Ohta to teach them at his homeeven Ryuta, who has not been in school since the bombing. He promises to start a new school. Gen, sympathetic to the Koreans, fears that Japan will be attacked for housing American planes.

Natsue&#x27;s scar has reopened, and she needs more surgery. She does not heal because of the radiation, and goes to Itsukaichi to make a pot; Ryuta suggests that they look for her. The city plans to tear down Gen&#x27;s home to build a road, and the brothers have 30 days to move. Gen helps a woman in Itsukaichi, and finds Natsue in her home. Natsue says that the pot is for her ashes, but Gen wants her to live. He and Koji get drunk. Gen overhears Koji&#x27;s conversation with his girlfriend Hiroko, who is unwilling to wait two years to get married and have Akira and Gen live with them. Akira decides to go to Osaka and become a businessman for peace, and Gen is determined to be self-reliant and fight to preserve their home. In October 1950, the threat of war is increasing.

===Volume 9: Breaking Down Borders===
Gen and Ryuta vainly throw rocks from the roof to resist the demolition of Gen&#x27;s home. Natsue finishes her pot and returns home to the orphans, who are celebrating Gen&#x27;s joining them. He sees a crack in the pot, which falls and breaks; Natsue is too ill to make another. Gen runs off after breaking the pot on purpose to give her a reason to live and make another. Natsue dies of colorectal cancer on December 30, 1950, the day MacArthur convinces President Truman to plan to use nuclear weapons in Korea. Representatives of the Atomic Bomb Casualty Commission (ABCC) offers to pay ¥30,000 and arrange for Natsue&#x27;s cremation so the commission can look for a cure for radiation sickness, but Gen angrily sends them away.

Natsue&#x27;s ashes are buried in January, in an urn Gen made. They want to bury her on Mount Hiji, but discover that the ABCC has buildings there for Hiroshima corpses. Gen decides to bury Natsue with his family, but a boy snatches the box with the urn and runs away. His grandfather is ashamed that his grandson is a thief, but the boy is desperate to get his grandfather&#x27;s oil paints to finish his painting.

Gen received Seiji&#x27;s painting tools at his death to finish his painting, which he never did. He is willing to give them to the grandfather, who destroys all his paintings in despair. When Gen brings the paints to him anyway, the old man tells him: &quot;Art has no borders&quot;. Gen decides to combine art with earning a living by training as a sign painter. He accidentally ruins a rush-job sign and promises to fix it for free, but the grandfather offers to take over and begins teaching Gen about perspective. 

Kurosaki, another employee, is jealous. After losing his whole family, he was taken in by a Buddhist monk who brought him to an island with 15 other orphans as slave labor. When a girl became ill, the monk did not take her to the hospital and she died. Kurosaki barely escaped the island, and was comforted by a beautiful rainbow on a painted sign. Gen and the orphans see a sign advertising a lecture by the neighborhood chairman who had called Gen&#x27;s father a traitor, but a rainbow soothes them. Gen wants to build rainbow bridges from country to country in a world without borders, free of war.

===Volume 10: Never Give Up===
In March 1953, Gen is graduating from middle school, learning to paint and working at the sign shop. Mr. Ohta has begun his 10-student school. On April 28, 1953, a treaty with the U.S. launched Japanese independence. On Bloody May Day that year, unauthorized demonstrators clashed with police outside the Imperial Palace; a special August 6 magazine issue shocked Japan with never-before-seen photos of the bombing devastation. The prime minister dissolved the lower house after calling a questioner a derogatory name.

At his graduation ceremony, Gen protests the singing of the national anthem and details the emperor&#x27;s war crimes. A beautiful girl accidentally runs into him while trying to catch a streetcar, and he is infatuated. Mr. Amano and Gen are &quot;fired&quot; from the sign-painting shop (where they were unpaid) for objecting to militaristic talk by owner Mr. Nakao. Gen sees the girl again, and follows her home. Mr. Nakao, her father, forbids her from having anything to do with him. Musubi stays out late after a bar owner gives him an energy shot. Ryuta asks Mitsuko (the girl) for a date, and shows her Gen&#x27;s sketchbook with pictures of her and declarations of love. She explains that her father has forbidden it, but the sketchbook impresses her. Her father tells her that she is the one important thing in his life; he dreams of seeing her married to the perfect husband and giving him grandchildren. Musubi returns to the bar for another energy shot, which he is told is full of vitamins. Mitsuko gets Gen&#x27;s address from the store to thank him for the sketchbook, and agrees to model for more sketches.

On July 27, 1953, the Korean armistice is signed. The dresses are selling well, but Ryuta and Katsuko wonder where Musubi is. Gen and Mitsuko go to the Itsukushima Shrine and lament that nearly all of its deer were killed for food at the end of the war. Mitsuko says that she considers herself a murderer because when the bomb was dropped, she (a small child) could not carry her injured mother and ran for her own life; Gen also left his father, sister, and brother. On his way home, Gen runs into an ill-looking Musubi on a streetcar. He shoves Gen and runs to the bar for a shot for which he cannot pay. He is told that he will be in agony for days, since he is addicted; the &quot;vitamins&quot; are illegal drugs. He steals money from the orphans&#x27; savings for a dress shop to pay for more shots. He returns home, claiming to be well and sorry for his absence, but Gen catches him preparing to shoot up and smashes the needle. Musubi runs away rather than face withdrawal.

The Hiroshima ABCC announces a steep rise in leukemia in atomic-bomb survivors; Mitsuko wants to become a doctor, talking about how the &quot;yakuza&quot; used Hiroshima orphans to kill other gangsters. She develops leukemia, and dies. Her father blames Gen, who blames Mr. Nakao&#x27;s militarism. Musubi has gone through the savings and tries to break into the bar to get drugs, but is beaten up and left for dead; he makes it back to the orphans before he dies. Gen vows revenge, but Ryuta (who has already killed two gangsters) says that he will take care of it. Ryuta, about to turn himself in, is talked into escaping to Tokyo with Katsuko. As Gen places Musubi&#x27;s ashes with Gen&#x27;s family, Mr. Amano encourages him to go to Tokyo and become an artist.

==Themes==
The themes of &quot;Barefoot Gen&quot; cover grief, discrimination, criticism of nationalism, the dangers of nuclear warfare, and the abuse of refugees. The later chapters turn their focus to how survivors struggled to live after the bombing of Hiroshima, including the discrimination that drove characters into crime. Those not affected by the bombing feared survivors would get them sick from radiation, while those who turned to crime became thieves for the Yakuzas. Grief and loss are constant in the narratives along with observations of anti-Korean racism in the Japan. 

, author of , believes that the characters of Katsuko and Natsue modify the Hiroshima Maiden narrative of &quot;Black Rain&quot;; although they are courageous, they are severely scarred physically and mentally.

==Translations==
A volunteer pacifist organization, Project Gen, was formed in Tokyo in 1976 to produce English translations of the series. Translations began to be printed in 1978, made available in the US through James Peck of the War Resisters League in New York City; the translations ended with the fourth volume. Leonard Rifas&#x27; EduComics began publishing it in 1980 as &quot;Gen of Hiroshima&quot;, the &quot;first full-length translation of a manga from Japanese into English to be published in the West.&quot; It was unpopular, however, and the series was canceled after two volumes.

The Rondo Gen group published an Esperanto translation as &quot;Nudpieda Gen&quot; (&quot;Barefoot Gen&quot;) in 1982. Its chief translator was Izumi Yukio. The German Rowohlt Verlag published the first volume in 1982 as a mass market paperback. Carlsen Comics began to publish the series in 2004, but canceled publication after four volumes. Both publishers used the title &quot;Barfuß durch Hiroshima&quot; (&quot;Barefoot through Hiroshima&quot;).

Its first volume was published in Norwegian in 1986 by GEVION norsk forlag A/S as &quot;Gen, Gutten fra Hiroshima&quot; (&quot;Gen, the Boy from Hiroshima&quot;). A Swedish edition (&quot;Gen – Pojken från Hiroshima&quot;) was published in 1985 by Alvglans förlag as, possibly, the earliest published manga in that language.

The first volume was published in Finnish in 1985 by Jalava, and was the first Japanese comic published in Finland. Its Finnish title is &quot;Hiroshiman poika&quot; (&quot;Son of Hiroshima&quot;), translated by Kaija-Leena Ogihara. In 2006, Jalava republished the first volume (with its original translation) and published the second volume. All 10 volumes were published in Poland by Waneko from 2004 to 2011 as &quot;Hiroszima 1945: Bosonogi Gen&quot;.

An Arabic translation was published in Egypt by Maher El-Sherbini, a professor in Cairo University&#x27;s department of Japanese language and literature. He began the project in 1992 as an exchange student at the Hiroshima University Graduate School of Letters, where he completed his master&#x27;s and doctorate degrees. The first volume was published in January 2015, and all 10 volumes have been translated. New Society Publishers began to release a second English-language version of the series in graphic novel format (as &quot;Barefoot Gen: The Cartoon Story of Hiroshima&quot;) in 1988.

===New English edition===
A new English translation began to be published by Last Gasp in 2004 with an introduction by Art Spiegelman, who has compared the work to his &quot;Maus&quot; (about the experiences of Spiegelman&#x27;s father during the Holocaust in Europe).

Nakazawa planned to present a set of the series to U.S. President Barack Obama as a caution against nuclear proliferation.

==Other media==
===Films===
====Live-action====
In 1976, 1977, and 1980, Tengo Yamada directed three live-action film adaptations. In 2009, a Hollywood producer expressed interest in a studio version of the manga.

* &quot;Barefoot Gen&quot; (1976)
* &quot;Barefoot Gen: Explosion of Tears&quot; (1977)
* &quot;Barefoot Gen Part 3: Battle of Hiroshima&quot; (1980)

====Animation====
Two animated films were based on the manga, in 1983 and 1986, both directed by Mori Masaki for a production company founded by Nakazawa:
* &quot;Barefoot Gen&quot; (1983)
* &quot;Barefoot Gen 2&quot; (1986)

&quot;Barefoot Gen 2&quot;, set three years after the bombing, focuses on the survival of Gen and the orphans in Hiroshima.

Initially released individually on dub-only VHS tape by Streamline Pictures and on dub-only DVD by Image Entertainment, Geneon offered bilingual versions of the film on DVD as a set. On December 26, 2017, Discotek Media released both films on Blu-ray in Japanese and English.

===Television===
A two-episode TV drama was produced by Fuji Television in 2007.

===Theatre===
Several theatrical adaptations of &quot;Barefoot Gen&quot; have been produced in Japan. In July 1996, the first stage adaptation in English premiered at the Crucible Theatre in Sheffield; the production was a collaboration between the Crucible and Tokyo&#x27;s Theatre Zenshinza. British theatre director Bryn Jones traveled to Japan in 1994 for Nakazawa&#x27;s permission to adapt the series&#x27; first volume for the stage. Jones returned to Sheffield to prepare the production&#x27;s research, design, and dramatization with the Crucible company, Tatsuo Suzuki, and Fusako Kurahara. Nakazawa traveled to the UK to attend final rehearsals, and gave post-show talks after the opening performances. The final manuscript was adapted and dramatized by Suzuki and Jones, and was translated by Kurahara. The production received a Japan Festival Award in 1997 for outstanding achievement in furthering the understanding of Japanese culture in the United Kingdom.

==Reception==
Barefoot Gen was received by the activist community of the time. The activist community used it as “an instrument in the struggle against nuclear weapons” as well as the “politically charged atmosphere of a country coming to terms with defeat in Vietnam”. The stark picture provided by the comic of being a survivor of Hiroshima lends credibility and usefulness to the activists movements. While affirming an anti nuclear bomb sentiment, it also promoted anti war ideals. It is used in activism at the end of the Vietnam war loss and in the midst of the cold war.

The manga has sold more than 10 million copies worldwide. There was renewed interest in &quot;Barefoot Gen&quot; in 2023 after the release of &quot;Oppenheimer&quot;, a film about J. Robert Oppenheimer (the theoretical physicist known as the &quot;father of the atomic bomb&quot;).

==Controversy==
In December 2012, access to &quot;Barefoot Gen&quot; became restricted in elementary and junior high schools in Matsue on the grounds that its depictions were too graphic for school children. Not only does the controversy address the manga itself, but it also brings into question Nazakawa’s feelings towards the Japanese&#x27;s actions, as well as who should be held accountable, providing even further points of controversy regarding the display of his stories to a younger audience. Other reasons on top of the display of graphic scenes, included a secondary group called the “Citizens Against the Privileges of Korean Residents” who argued against the display of this manga as they feared children would encounter and absorb ideas and understanding about history that this group would have deemed as misinformation. That being said, in terms of support, newspapers, including the “Ryukyu Shinpo” argued that the manga had deeper implications, comparing the banning of this book to previous historical events like Nazi book burnings. Controversy follows both the actual banning of the book as well as the aftermath and implications of the ban. The restriction was reviewed after 44 of the city&#x27;s 49 school principals requested its removal, and it was lifted in August 2013. Nakazawa&#x27;s widow, Misayo, expressed shock that children&#x27;s access to the work had been restricted, saying: &quot;[W]ar is brutal. It expresses that in pictures, and I want people to keep reading it.&quot;

<text>Alessandro Grandi (1590 – after June 1630, but in that year) was a northern Italian composer of the early Baroque era, writing in the new concertato style. He was one of the most inventive, influential, and popular composers of the time, probably second only to Monteverdi in northern Italy.

==Life==
Grandi was born in Venice and spent the first part of his life there, likely studying with Giovanni Gabrieli. He held several posts in Ferrara as &quot;maestro di cappella&quot; at different cathedrals and academies. In 1617 he won a post at St. Mark&#x27;s in Venice, during the time Monteverdi was choirmaster there. Eventually he became Monteverdi&#x27;s assistant, and during this time seems to have chosen to write works in some of the smaller forms which Monteverdi was neglecting. In 1627 he went to Bergamo, probably because he had an opportunity to be &quot;maestro di cappella&quot; at a place where he could build up the music program from scratch. Most likely he met Heinrich Schütz on that composer&#x27;s second visit to Italy. Unfortunately, after only three years at Bergamo, Grandi died in 1630 during an outbreak of the plague.

==Works==
Most of Grandi&#x27;s music is vocal with instrumental accompaniment. Stylistically, his early music is similar to that of Giovanni Gabrieli, with alternating short passages of greatly contrasting rhythms and texture; however he usually wrote for smaller forces. Most of Grandi&#x27;s early compositions are motets in the concertato style: some are duets and trios, an innovation in motet writing, which usually involved larger groups. Grandi was one of the few composers who continued to write involved vocal polyphony over the &quot;basso continuo&quot; right after its introduction—most composers using the continuo in the first decades of the 17th century wrote monodies, or preferred more homophonic textures.

Grandi experimented with extreme emotionalism in some of his music, with chromaticism, ornament, and affectation. While harmonically he was not as adventurous as Gesualdo, he was connected to the larger tradition, and thus his works were almost as influential as Monteverdi&#x27;s. He ceaselessly innovated, writing monodies with instruments such as violins, and in a sectional form with repeating parts for instruments only—an idea which would develop into the &quot;ritornello.&quot; The music of Grandi shows a link between the &quot;concertato&quot; style which began the Baroque era, and the form of the cantata which culminated in the work of J.S. Bach.

Grandi was one of the most popular composers of his day; his works were published throughout Italy, Germany, and the Low Countries, and continued to be reprinted long after his death. He wrote motets, psalm settings, madrigals, as well as some of the earliest compositions to be called &quot;cantata.&quot;

<text>Jonathan Safran Foer (; born February 21, 1977) is an American novelist. He is known for his novels &quot;Everything Is Illuminated&quot; (2002), &quot;Extremely Loud &amp; Incredibly Close&quot; (2005), &quot;Here I Am&quot; (2016), and for his non-fiction works &quot;Eating Animals&quot; (2009) and &quot;We Are the Weather: Saving the Planet Begins at Breakfast&quot; (2019). He teaches creative writing at New York University.

==Early life and education==
Safran Foer was born in Washington, D.C., as the son of Albert Foer, a lawyer and president of the American Antitrust Institute, and Esther Safran Foer, a child of Holocaust survivors born in Poland, who is now Senior Advisor at the Sixth &amp; I Historic Synagogue. Safran Foer is the middle son of a Jewish family. His older brother, Franklin, is a former editor of &quot;The New Republic&quot; and his younger brother, Joshua, is the founder of &quot;Atlas Obscura&quot; and of Sefaria. Safran Foer was a &quot;flamboyant&quot; and sensitive child who, at the age of 8, was injured in a classroom chemical accident that resulted in &quot;something like a nervous breakdown drawn out over about three years,&quot; during which &quot;he wanted nothing, except to be outside his own skin.&quot;

Safran Foer attended Georgetown Day School and in 1994 traveled to Israel with other North American Jewish teenagers in a program sponsored by Bronfman youth fellowships. In 1995, while a freshman at Princeton University, he took an introductory writing course with author Joyce Carol Oates, who took an interest in his writing, telling him that he had &quot;that most important of writerly qualities, energy.&quot; Safran Foer later recalled that &quot;she was the first person to ever make me think I should try to write in any sort of serious way. And my life really changed after that.&quot; Safran Foer graduated with an A.B. in philosophy from Princeton in 1999 after completing a 40-page-long senior thesis, titled &quot;Before Reading The Book of Anticedents: Intention, Literary Interpretation, and the Hypothesized Author&quot;, under the supervision of Gideon Rosen. Oates served as the advisor to Safran Foer&#x27;s creative writing senior thesis, an examination of the life of his maternal grandfather, the Holocaust survivor Louis Safran. For his thesis, Safran Foer received Princeton&#x27;s Senior Creative Writing Thesis Prize.

After graduating from Princeton, Safran Foer briefly attended the Mount Sinai School of Medicine before dropping out to pursue his writing career.

==Career==
Safran Foer graduated from Princeton in 1999 with a degree in philosophy, and traveled to Ukraine to expand his thesis. In 2001, he edited the anthology &quot;A Convergence of Birds: Original Fiction and Poetry Inspired by the Work of Joseph Cornell&quot;, to which he contributed the short story, &quot;If the Aging Magician Should Begin to Believe&quot;. His Princeton thesis grew into a novel, &quot;Everything Is Illuminated&quot;, which was published by Houghton Mifflin in 2002. The book earned him a National Jewish Book Award (2001) and a Guardian First Book Award (2002). Safran Foer shared the PEN/Robert W. Bingham Prize with fellow authors Will Heinrich and Monique Truong in 2004. In 2005, Liev Schreiber wrote and directed a film adaptation of the novel, which starred Elijah Wood.

Safran Foer&#x27;s second novel, &quot;Extremely Loud &amp; Incredibly Close&quot;, was published in 2005. In it, Safran Foer used 9/11 as a backdrop for the story of 9-year-old Oskar Schell, who learns how to deal with the death of his father in the World Trade Center. The novel used writing techniques known as visual writing. It follows multiple but interconnected storylines, is peppered with photographs of doorknobs and other such oddities, and ends with a 14-page flipbook. Safran Foer&#x27;s use of these techniques resulted in both praise and excoriation from critics. Warner Bros. and Paramount turned the novel into a film, produced by Scott Rudin and directed by Stephen Daldry.

Safran Foer wrote the libretto for an opera titled &quot;Seven Attempted Escapes From Silence&quot;, which premiered at the Berlin State Opera on September 14, 2005.

In 2008, Safran Foer taught writing for the first time as a visiting professor of fiction at Yale University. , he teaches in the graduate creative writing program at New York University. Safran Foer published his third novel, &quot;Tree of Codes&quot;, in November 2010. In March 2012, &quot;The New American Haggadah&quot;, edited by Safran Foer and translated by Nathan Englander, was released to mixed reviews.

In 2009, Safran Foer published his third book, &quot;Eating Animals&quot;. A &quot;New York Times&quot; bestseller, &quot;Eating Animals&quot; provides a morally dense discussion of some of the ramifications that followed the proliferation of factory farms. It attempts to explain why and how humans can be so loving to our companion animals while simultaneously being indifferent to others, and explores what this inconsistency tells us about ourselves―what kinds of stories emerge from this selectivity. The book offers a significant focus on &quot;storytelling&quot;―the title of both the first and the last chapters of the book. Storytelling is Safran Foer&#x27;s way of recognizing and dealing with the complexity of the subject that is eating animals, and suggests that, ultimately, our food choices tell stories about who we are, or, as Safran Foer has it in his book, &quot;stories about food are stories about us―our history and our values.&quot;

In May 2012, Safran Foer signed a two-book deal with Little, Brown. His novel, &quot;Escape From Children&#x27;s Hospital&quot;, was due for publication in 2014, but is no longer on the publisher&#x27;s schedule. In September 2016, he released the novel &quot;Here I Am&quot;.

In 2019, as part of the book tour for &quot;We Are the Weather: Saving the Planet Begins at Breakfast&quot;, Safran Foer took part in an on stage conversation with Samin Nosrat about eating and climate change.

Safran Foer serves as a board member for Farm Forward, a nonprofit organization that implements innovative strategies to promote conscientious food choices, reduce farmed animal suffering, and advance sustainable agriculture.

==Views==
Safran Foer has been an outspoken critic of the meat industry. In 2006, he recorded the narration for the documentary &quot;If This is Kosher...&quot;, an exposé of the kosher certification process that advocates Jewish vegetarianism. Safran Foer&#x27;s first book of non-fiction, &quot;Eating Animals&quot; (2009), addresses problems associated with industrialized meat and the ensuing ethical concerns. He said that he had long been &quot;uncertain about how I felt [about eating meat]&quot; and that the birth of his first child inspired &quot;an urgency because I would have to make decisions on his behalf&quot;. 

In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, Safran Foer reiterated his argument that Americans should eat less meat on account of the meat industry&#x27;s social, environmental, and humanitarian consequences. 

In his personal life, Safran Foer has been an occasional vegetarian since the age of 10.

==Personal life==
In June 2004, Safran Foer married writer Nicole Krauss. They lived in Park Slope in Brooklyn, New York, and have two children. The couple divorced in 2014. 

From 2015 until 2017, Safran Foer dated actress Michelle Williams.

==Criticism==
Because of Safran Foer&#x27;s frequent use of modernist literary devices, he is often named as a polarizing figure in modern literature. In his critical article &quot;Extremely Cloying &amp; Incredibly False&quot;, Harry Siegel wrote in the &quot;New York Press&quot;, &quot;Foer is supposed to be our new Philip Roth, though his fortune-cookie syllogisms and pointless illustrations and typographical tricks don&#x27;t at all match up to or much resemble Roth even at his most inane.&quot; 

In response to charges of historical inaccuracy in &quot;Everything is Illuminated,&quot; Safran Foer defended himself in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, writing, &quot;Rather than aligning itself with either &#x27;how things were&#x27; or &#x27;how things could have been&#x27;, the novel measures the difference between the two, and by so doing attempts to reflect a kind of experiential (rather than historical or journalistic) truth.&quot;

<text>The Corcoran Gallery of Art is a former art museum in Washington, D.C., that is now the location of the Corcoran School of the Arts and Design, a part of the George Washington University. 

Founded in 1869 by philanthropist William Wilson Corcoran, the gallery was one of the earliest public art museums in the United States. It held an important collection that became concentrated in American art. In 1890, it started its art school. Its Beaux-Arts style building on The Ellipse was opened in 1897. Due to a prolonged economic shortfall, the Gallery failed in October 2014; pursuant to its founding charter, its art school and building transferred to GWU and the 19,456 works in its collection were distributed to other public museums and institutions in Washington, D.C., primarily the National Gallery of Art.

==Overview==
The Corcoran School of the Arts and Design at George Washington University, part of the Columbian College of Arts and Sciences, hosts exhibitions by its students and visiting artists and offers degrees in fine art, photojournalism, interaction design, interior architecture, and other fields of artistic study. Prior to the Corcoran Gallery of Art&#x27;s closing, it was one of the oldest privately supported cultural institutions in the United States.

Founded in 1890, the Corcoran School began with 40 students and two faculty members. It was later renamed the Corcoran College of Art + Design in the 1990s, where it coexisted with the gallery. The museum&#x27;s main focus was American art.

In 2014, after decades of financial problems and alleged mismanagement, the Corcoran was dissolved by court order. A new non-profit was established by the trustees and the Corcoran&#x27;s $2 billion, 17,000-piece art collection was given away for free to the National Gallery of Art (NGA). Works the NGA did not acquire were donated to cultural institutions throughout the city and nation. The Corcoran College of Art and Design, its $50 million endowment, and its $200 million historic 17th Street building were given to George Washington University, which renamed it the Corcoran School of the Arts &amp; Design.

==History==

===Founding===

When the gallery was founded in 1869 by William Wilson Corcoran, the cofounder of Riggs Bank, it was one of the first fine art galleries in the country. Corcoran established the gallery, supported with an endowment, &quot;for the perpetual establishment and encouragement of the Fine Arts.&quot; While an independent institution, the Corcoran was the oldest and largest non-federal art museum in the District of Columbia. Its mission was &quot;dedicated to art and used solely for the purpose of encouraging the American genius.&quot;

The Corcoran Gallery of Art was originally located at 17th Street and Pennsylvania Avenue, in the building that now houses the Renwick Gallery. Construction of that building started before the Civil War. The building, near completion, was used by the government as a warehouse during the Civil War. It was finally completed in 1874 and the gallery opened to the public. The 93 works on display at the gallery were described in detail by M.E.P. Bouligny in her published in 1874.
By 1897, the Corcoran Gallery collection outgrew the space of its original building. A new building was constructed, designed by Ernest Flagg in a Beaux-Arts style. The 135,000 square feet (12,500 m2) building was built to house an expanded Corcoran collection in addition to the nascent school, which had been formally founded in 1890. The new building features a pair of bronze statues, the Canova Lions, at its entrance. These lions were purchased at auction by the Corcoran Gallery in 1888 and placed in front of the museum at its original location. The iconic bronze castings were moved to their current location in 1897 when the museum moved to its final building at 17th Street and New York Avenue.

=== Years of growth ===
In 1928, the art collection of former Senator William A. Clark joined the Corcoran in a new wing designed by Charles Adam Platt, which was inaugurated by President Calvin Coolidge. For decades, the Corcoran examined the possibility of adding on a final wing which would complete the campus footprint. These plans abruptly ended in 2005 after a Frank O. Gehry-designed wing was scrapped due to lack of funding, and the remainder of the available property was sold to a private developer.

Throughout the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s, the gallery continued to display its main collection from Corcoran, Clark, and a few select major donors. At its peak, the museum owned a significant collection including work from Rembrandt Peale, Eugène Delacroix, Edgar Degas, Thomas Gainsborough, John Singer Sargent, Claude Monet, Mariano Fortuny, Pablo Picasso, Edward Hopper, Willem de Kooning, Joan Mitchell, Gene Davis, and many others. Space was always a challenge; only a small percentage of the gallery&#x27;s permanent collection could be displayed in the confines of the 17th Street gallery, which shared its roughly with the art school. Donelson Hoopes served as curator from 1962 to 1964. During the 1980s museum attendance swelled and the Corcoran&#x27;s events and programs were imitated by other institutions.

=== Mapplethorpe controversy ===
In 1989, the Corcoran Gallery of Art agreed to host a traveling solo exhibit of Robert Mapplethorpe&#x27;s works. Mapplethorpe showed a new series that he had explored shortly before his death, &quot;Robert Mapplethorpe: The Perfect Moment&quot;, which was curated by Janet Kardon of the Institute of Contemporary Art in Philadelphia. Several Trustees of the Corcoran and U.S. Representative Dick Armey (TX) and Senator Jesse Helms (NC) were horrified when the sexually explicit works were revealed to them; the museum board of trustees succumbed to pressure and cancelled the exhibit the night before its opening, which had already been announced to its members through an exhibition preview invitation. The Coalition of Washington Artists organized a demonstration to protest the Corcoran Gallery&#x27;s cancellation of the exhibit. An estimated 700 people attended the demonstration.

In June 1989, pop artist Lowell Blair Nesbitt became involved in the controversy over Mapplethorpe&#x27;s work. It was at this time that Nesbitt, a longtime friend of Mapplethorpe, revealed that he had a $1.5 million bequest to the museum in his will. Nesbitt publicly promised that if the museum refused to host the exhibition he would revoke his bequest. The Corcoran refused and Nesbitt bequeathed the money to the Phillips Collection instead.

After the Corcoran cancelled the Mapplethorpe exhibition, the underwriters of the exhibition went to the nonprofit Washington Project for the Arts, which showed the controversial images in its own space from July 21 to August 13, 1989, to large crowds. The 1990 NEA Appropriations Bill included language against &quot;obscene&quot; work.

As a result of the controversy, more than a dozen artists canceled exhibitions, funding and membership declined, and staff resigned
in protest. By the end of 1989 Orr-Cahall had resigned as museum director.

=== Final years ===

In its final years, the museum and its affiliated Corcoran College of Art and Design together had a staff of about 140 and an operating budget of about $24 million. Revenue came from grants and contributions, admissions fees, tuition, membership dues, gift shop and restaurant sales, and an endowment worth around $30 million. In February 2001, two AOL executives (Robert W. Pittman and Barry Schuler) and their wives donated $30 million to the museum, its largest single donation since its founding.

In 2014, following years of negligence and financial mismanagement, a lawsuit was brought by the law firm Gibson Dunn on behalf of the group Save the Corcoran against the trustees. After two weeks of hearings, Judge Okum ordered the Corcoran, the city&#x27;s oldest independent museum, dissolved. The trustees gave the Corcoran College of Art and Design the $200 million Beaux Arts building, and gave $50 million to George Washington University to renovate the facility and operate the school programs. The 17,000-piece art collection, worth $2 billion, was donated to the National Gallery of Art. At the beginning of 2018, the director of the Corcoran School of the Arts and Design officially disclosed plans for the National Gallery of Art to bring art back to the second floor of the Flagg building.

== Interior ==
Flagg also designed the interior of the building. Upon entering the building&#x27;s front doors on 17th Street, you first enter the atrium. The vast space, separated into three connected sections, consists of forty limestone columns and twin skylights (to light the intended display of sculptures). The Beaux-Arts-inspired room rises two interior stories and has housed exhibit space and other uses.

Directly across the atrium from the front entrance stands the grand staircase, leading to the second floor. Low rise stairs, wide, are watched over by six statues on pedestals atop marble platforms, and lead to a landing halfway to the second floor. Hold onto the brass-topped railing for balance. From the grand staircase, one can access the rotunda and the second story level of the atrium, including a bridge that heads across the atrium back towards the direction of the front door. Gallery space exists throughout.

Back on the first floor, three galleries lead from the atrium (originally there were seven). The second floor originally had eight galleries. The rotunda came later, designed by Charles Platt in 1925. Forty eight feet wide, the room&#x27;s domed ceiling culminates in an oculus skylight. Reminiscent of the Pantheon, the space offers an exquisite entry to the building&#x27;s Clark Wing. An observer would access a marble-floored, square, dark staircase hall with wood panels to reach the Clark Wing galleries.

At the northern end of the building, the Hemicycle&#x27;s unusual shape fills the angle created by New York Avenue and 17th Street. The space is the auditorium, being with a 300-person capacity. The Salon Doré appears on the building&#x27;s opposite side. Also referred to as the &quot;French Room&quot;, it displays intricate French decorations; it was designed in the early 1700s by Jean‐François‐Thérèse Chalgrin and was moved from Paris to the United States sometime before 1904.

In 2015, preservationists added the interior portions of the Corcoran Gallery to the National Register of Historic Places (the exterior had been listed in 1971). The interior nomination includes the grand staircase, atrium, rotunda, gallery, and other notable spaces.

<doc id="925041" wikidata="Q23807836" url="?curid=925041" title="Pedestrian malls in the United States">
<text>Pedestrian malls, also known as pedestrian streets, are the most common form of pedestrian zone in large cities in the United States. They are typically streets lined with storefronts and closed off to most automobile traffic. Emergency vehicles may have access at all times and delivery vehicles may be restricted to either limited delivery hours or entrances on side streets.

&quot;Pedestrian mall&quot; as a term is most often used in the United States and Australia. &quot;Pedestrian street&quot; and &quot;pedestrian zone&quot; are the more common terms worldwide.

== History ==
Today, pedestrian malls are relatively rare in the U.S., except for areas with many tourists and other visitors. They were more closely tied to the success of retail than in Europe, and by the 1980s, most did not succeed competing with ever more elaborate enclosed malls. Almost all of this generation of pedestrian malls built from 1959 through to the 1970s, have disappeared, or were shrunk down in the 1990s at the request of the retailers. Half of Kalamazoo&#x27;s pedestrian mall, America&#x27;s first, has been converted into a regular street with auto traffic, though with wide sidewalks.

===First generation (1959–1970s)===
In 1959, Kalamazoo, Michigan, was the first American city to implement a &quot;pedestrian mall&quot; in its downtown core,

This became a method that some cities applied for their downtowns to compete with the growing suburban shopping malls of the time. In the 1960s and 70s over 200 towns in the United States adopted this approach.

In 2009, there were at least 75 pedestrian malls in the U.S. Besides the Kalamazoo Mall, some notable examples are the Church Street Marketplace in Burlington, Vermont; the Downtown Mall in Charlottesville, Virginia; the Third Street Promenade in Santa Monica, California; the Buffalo Place Main Street Pedestrian Mall in Buffalo, New York; Ithaca Commons in Ithaca, New York; the Pearl Street Mall in Boulder, Colorado; St. Charles, Missouri; Salem, Massachusetts; Ped Mall in Iowa City, Iowa; Lincoln Road in Miami Beach, Florida; the Fulton Mall in Fresno, California; the K Street Mall in Sacramento, California; the 16th Street Mall in Denver, Colorado; State Street in Madison, Wisconsin; Nicollet Mall in Minneapolis, Minnesota; The Grove in Los Angeles, California; Fort Street Mall in Honolulu, Hawaii; City Center in Oakland, California; Walnut Street in Des Moines, Iowa, Downtown Crossing and Faneuil Hall/Quincy Market in Boston; Washington Street Mall in Cape May, New Jersey; and The Downtown Cumberland Mall in Cumberland, Maryland. Typically these downtown pedestrian malls were three or four linear blocks simply blocked off to private street traffic, with fountains, benches, planters that doubled as seating areas, bollards, playgrounds, interfaces to public transit and other amenities installed to attract shoppers.

Many were later re-converted to accommodate automobile traffic within twenty years.

===Surviving first generation pedestrian malls===
However, most of these areas are still popular attractions today. The Pearl Street Mall in Boulder continues to thrive with its college crowd atmosphere and the Third Street Promenade in Santa Monica thrives on tourist traffic. The Downtown Mall in Charlottesville, Virginia, now a vital business, entertainment, and retail area, spent roughly twenty years as a somewhat depressed stretch until an ice skating rink and multiplex opened on it in the mid-1990s. Broadway St. in Eugene, Oregon, is finally being developed with a hotel, movie theater, and retail after decades of limited economic activity following its experiment with a pedestrian mall.

The Federal Plaza in Downtown Youngstown, Ohio is a similar case. Since the unsuccessful Federal Plaza has been ripped up and redesigned in 2004, the city of Youngstown has seen the development of a new entertainment district erupt. A new arena, two new courthouses, federal buildings, bistros and other new night-spots have placed themselves in Youngstown&#x27;s core.

Burlington, Vermont&#x27;s Church Street Marketplace has been expanded from the original three blocks to four, encompassing the entirety of the city&#x27;s commercial &quot;main street,&quot; and remains a thriving cultural center with shops, restaurants, vendor carts, sidewalk performers and special events which does not appear to be affected by the development of big box store farms in neighboring Williston.

Poughkeepsie, New York, on the other hand, has reverted its Main Mall to vehicular traffic, having failed at maintaining a place pedestrians wanted to be (it was, at least in part, Poughkeepsie&#x27;s initial success which convinced Burlington to proceed with its Marketplace project).

===New generation===
In 1989, Santa Monica, California on the Westside of Los Angeles, renovated and relaunched its 1960s-era pedestrian mall as the Third Street Promenade, and renovated both the adjacent Santa Monica Pier and adjacent enclosed mall, Santa Monica Place, all together helping to draw both domestic and international visitors and locals from across Greater Los Angeles locals. 

In the mid-2010s, former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg worked during his final term in office to create pedestrian malls in major tourist centers that had also been areas of severe automobile congestion such as Times Square and Herald Square.

===Unconventional examples===
====Las Vegas====

In 1994–5, Las Vegas pedestrianized and covered its main downtown street, lined with smaller casinos, and created the Fremont Street Experience.

====San Antonio====
The San Antonio River Walk is a special-case pedestrian street, one level down from the automobile street. The River Walk winds and loops under bridges as two parallel sidewalks lined with restaurants and shops, connecting the major tourist draws from Alamo Plaza to Rivercenter, to HemisFair Plaza, to the Transit Tower. Most downtown buildings have street entrances and separate river entrances one level below. This separates the automotive service grid (delivery and ambulance/police vehicles) from pedestrian traffic below, provides bridges, walkways, and staircases, and attempts to balance retail, commercial, office, green space and cultural uses.

===During the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States===
During the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States some cities pedestrianized additional streets in order to encourage social distancing and in many cases to provide extra rooms for restaurants to serve food on patios extended into the newly available spaces. In New York, this was applied to up to 100 miles of streets across the city.

== List of pedestrian malls ==

==Urban renewal==
In the last decades of the 20th century many urbanists such as Jan Gehl and Peter Calthorpe have listed and explained what they see as the virtues of pedestrian streets. Urban renewal activists have often pushed for the creation of auto-free zones in parts or in all of the sectors of a metropolitan area.

== Legal status ==
In some locations, the definition of a pedestrian mall is codified. Examples include Las Vegas and Riverside, California.

==Environmental impacts==
Pedestrian malls are streets that have limited or prohibited motor vehicle access, with the intent to create a walking zone. This may be done to create a safer environment in areas that have high pedestrian traffic, to reduce the noise and pollution levels, or to increase exercise levels by encouraging walking.

<doc id="925048" wikidata="Q9048751" url="?curid=925048" title="Narco-state">
<text>Narco-state (also narco-capitalism or narco-economy) is a political and economic term applied to countries where all legitimate institutions become penetrated by the power and wealth of the illegal drug trade. The term was first used to describe Bolivia following the 1980 coup of Luis García Meza which was seen to be primarily financed with the help of narcotics traffickers.

The term is often seen as ambiguous because of the differentiation between narco-states. The overall description would consist of illegal organisations that either produce, ship or sell drugs and hold a grip on the legitimate institutions through force, bribery or blackmail. This situation can arise in different forms. For instance, Colombia, where drug lord Pablo Escobar ran the Medellín Cartel (named after his birthplace) during most of the 1970s and 1980s, producing and trafficking cocaine to the United States of America. Escobar managed to take over control of most of the police forces in Medellín and surrounding areas through bribery and coercion, allowing him to expand his drug trafficking business.

Currently, scholars argue that the term &quot;narco-state&quot; is oversimplified because of the underlying networks running the drug trafficking organisations. For example, the Guadalajara Cartel in Mexico, led by Miguel Ángel Félix Gallardo, who managed to combine several small drug trafficking families into one overarching cartel controlling the marijuana production in the rural areas of Mexico while trafficking Colombian cocaine to the US at the same time.

Over time, the cocaine market expanded to Europe, leading to new routes being discovered from Colombia through Brazil or Venezuela and Western Africa. These new routes proved to be more profitable and successful than shipping from North America and turned African states such as Nigeria, Ghana, and (later on) Guinea-Bissau into actual narco-states. While cocaine was transported through Western Africa, the Taliban produced opium in the rural areas of Afghanistan using the revenues to fund their guerrilla war. Despite American and NATO efforts to impose laws on the Afghan opium production, the early 2000s incumbent Afghan governments shielded the opium trade from foreign policies as much as possible. As of 2024, Syria&#x27;s Assad regime was regarded as the world&#x27;s largest narco-state, with an estimated global Captagon export worth 30-57 billion dollars annually. Revenue from the illicit drug exports accounted for around 90% of the revenue of the Assad regime.

Ongoing discussions divide scholars into separate groups either claiming or disclaiming the resemblance between narco-states and failed states. Depending on which properties are assigned to the definition of a failed state, the definition is in accordance with the narco-state. While most narco-states show signs of high rates of corruption, violence and murder, properties that are also assigned to failed states, it is not always clear if violence can be traced back to drug trafficking.

== Usage ==
It has been argued that narco-states can be divided into five categories depending on their level of dependence on the narcotics trade and the threat the narcotics trade in said country poses to domestic and international stability. These five categories are (in ascending order): incipient, developing, serious, critical, and advanced.

However, recent use of the term narco-state has been questioned by some for being too widely and uncritically applied, particularly following the widespread media attention given to Guinea-Bissau as &quot;the world&#x27;s first narco-state&quot; in 2008, and should instead refer only to those countries in which the narcotics trade is state-sponsored and constitutes the majority of a country&#x27;s overall GDP.

==Examples==
=== Afghanistan ===

Afghanistan was very well known for its opium production. As of 2021, Afghanistan&#x27;s harvest produces more than 90% of illicit heroin globally, and more than 95% of the European supply. Most of the opium was smuggled through Herat and Faizabad to the Golden Crescent countries such as Iran and Pakistan. Opium production and trafficking are known to have funded the Taliban&#x27;s military activities and insurgency.

=== Belize ===
Belize has been described as a narco-state in Mexican media owing to close links between Belizean authorities and Mexican drug cartels. The country was a base of operations for Joaquín &quot;El Chapo&quot; Guzmán and Ismael Zambada García with his Sinaloa Cartel, along with Mexico and Honduras.

Johnny Briceño, elected prime minister of Belize in 2020, is the son of Elijio &quot;Don Joe&quot; Briceño, who in 1985 was convicted of trafficking marijuana and cocaine into the United States. Two others members of the Briceño family were also indicted, with prosecutors describing the clan as operating a &quot;family marijuana business&quot;.

=== Bolivia ===
The drug trade in Bolivia gained its prominence in 1980s, when the demand for cocaine was booming across the Latin America. Bolivia&#x27;s most lucrative crop and economic activity in the 1980s was coca, whose leaves were processed clandestinely into cocaine. The country was the second largest grower of coca in the world, supplying approximately fifteen percent of the US cocaine market in the late 1980s. Analysts believed that exports of coca paste and cocaine generated between US$600 million and US$1 billion annually in the 1980s (depending on prices and output).

In 1980, General Luis García Meza overthrew President Lidia Gueiler Tejada in a bloody coup d&#x27;état allegedly aided by drug cartels. The dictatorship of García Meza was very well known for its state sponsored drug trafficking activities. García Meza&#x27;s regime oversaw Bolivia&#x27;s 13-month period of isolation. The Reagan administration distanced themselves from García Meza&#x27;s regime and halted some aid to Bolivia due to the regime&#x27;s relationship with drug cartels. García Meza&#x27;s time in office was short-lived as he was overthrown and replaced by General Celso Torrelio. García Meza was convicted in absentia for his human rights violations in Bolivia, and he was later extradited from Brazil in 1995 and sentenced to serve 30 years in a Bolivian prison. His collaborator, Colonel Luis Arce Gómez, was extradited to the United States to serve his sentence for drug trafficking in a United States federal prison.

The 1980s coup was said to have been financed by Bolivia&#x27;s most notorious drug baron, Roberto Suárez Gómez. Suárez Gómez was the founder of La Corporación, a Bolivian drug cartel tied to Pablo Escobar&#x27;s Medellín Cartel. The organization was founded in the 1970s and mainly focused in Santa Cruz de la Sierra; it amassed $400 million annually. The cocaine shipped from the Bolivian Amazon to Colombia was valued at $9,000 per kilogram. In 1988, Suárez Gómez was arrested by the Bolivian National Police and sentenced to 15 years in prison; his nephew Jorge Roca Suárez continued his business until his arrest in 1990.

=== Brazil ===

Since 1990, the phenomenon of urban violence has intensified. There are currently more than fifty criminal factions in Brazil. Since the 1990s, Brazil has seen a significant increase in urban violence, often linked to drug trafficking and organized crime. The presence of over fifty criminal factions indicates a deeply entrenched network of illicit activities. These groups are involved in various illegal operations, including the local drug trade and international drug trafficking. The power and influence of these factions, such as the First Capital Command (PCC) and the Red Command (CV), extend beyond prisons into various urban areas, contributing to the issue. Brazil&#x27;s extensive borders with major cocaine-producing countries like Colombia, Peru, and Bolivia make it a key transit country for drug trafficking. This geographic situation, combined with socio-economic factors and challenges in law enforcement and judicial systems, creates an environment conducive to the growth of organized crime and drug trafficking.

Former president Jair Bolsonaro&#x27;s family has been linked to so called &quot;milícias&quot;, composed of police officers and other government officials engaged in narcotrafic. One of aides, who has been charged a 2 million euro fine over cocaine transportation, is being investigated for using an official airplane and the president&#x27;s credit card for drug-trafficking. During the presidential election of 2022, Bolsonaro supporters made claims regarding Lula&#x27;s alleged links to criminal factions.

Other politicians, such as former president Fernando Collor de Mello, have been investigated for mobster relations.

=== Colombia ===
Beginning in the mid-1970s, Colombian drug cartels became major producers, processors and exporters of illegal drugs, primarily marijuana and cocaine. The drug trade in Colombia was monopolized by four drug trafficking cartels: Medellín, Cali, Norte del Valle, and North Coast. However some guerilla warlords in the Colombian conflict were also said to be involved in drug trafficking in the country.
The Medellín Cartel was once the largest drug cartel operating in Colombia, led by Pablo Escobar which focused its operations in the city of Medellín. Most of the imported drugs are originated from countries like Bolivia and Peru which were later processed in Colombia. The Medellín Cartel gained prominence in the 1980s when the cartel amassed $60 million worth of fortune from drug trade to the United States, mainly focused on Florida, New York, and California. This caused the United States government to sign an extradition treaty with Colombia. Escobar&#x27;s business empire was known for its &quot;reign of terror&quot; as the cartel staged numerous kidnappings, assassinations and bombings around Colombia to ensure its business continuity. Pablo Escobar was shot to death by police in 1993; after the death of Pablo Escobar, the Medellín Cartel began to decline which eventually led to its disbandment. The disbandment of the Medellín Cartel has led to the other three major cartels, especially the Cali Cartel, to seize the opportunity to expand their trade routes.

During the drug war, major Colombian cartels were known to be influencing Colombian politicians and warlords alike. In order to flex his muscle, Escobar went to politics and ran as candidate for the Chamber of Representatives under the banner of the Liberal Alternative. However Escobar&#x27;s ambition in politics was later thwarted after knowledge of his criminal activity was exposed to the representatives, which forced him to resign. This event become the root cause of the assassination of justice minister Rodrigo Lara Bonilla. In contrast to the Medellín Cartel, the Cali Cartel adopted a more subtle approach on influencing local politicians. In 1994, the outgoing president Ernesto Samper was involved in the Proceso 8000 scandal in which he was accused of being funded by drug money, allegedly from the Cali Cartel for his campaign in the 1994 Colombian presidential election. The scandal caused then US president Bill Clinton to cut Colombian aid and later revoke Samper&#x27;s visa.

In 2023, Nicolas Petro, son of Colombian President Gustavo Petro was arrested for money laundering case. Petro was accused to take money from drug traffickers to fund his peace effort and presidential campaign which he would later deny. Nicolas Petro would later told Semana that he and his father did not aware about the money he received are coming from drug traffickers.

=== Guinea-Bissau ===
Guinea-Bissau, in West Africa, has been called a narco-state due to government officials often being bribed by traffickers to ignore the illegal trade. Colombian drug cartels used the West African coast as Jamaica and Panama increased policing. &quot;The Guardian&quot; noted that Guinea-Bissau&#x27;s lack of prisons, poor policing, and poverty attracted the traffickers. An article in &quot;Foreign Policy&quot; questioned the effectiveness of money from the United States, the European Union, and the United Nations designated to combat the illegal trade.

=== Honduras ===
Honduras has been labeled as a narco-state due to drug trafficking involvement of President Juan Orlando Hernández and his brother Tony Hernández, who was a congressman. Tony Hernández was captured in 2018 in the United States and was accused of conspiracy of cocaine trafficking to the US in 2019. Also Fabio Lobo, the son of former president Porfirio Lobo, was arrested by DEA agents in Haiti in 2015. All of them are members of the National Party of Honduras.

=== Iran ===
Since 2017, a sudden surge in crystal meth production and smuggling from Iran has contributed to a drug epidemic in neighboring Iraq and Turkey.

=== Lebanon ===
Illegal drugs trading pervaded in Lebanon since the 1960s. In 2014, Lebanese authorities seized 25.4 million Captagon tablets at the airport and Port of Beirut. In April 2015, the European Council stated that Lebanon had become a transit country for drug trafficking.

In April 2021, Greek authorities seized four tonnes of cannabis hidden in dessert-making machinery at Piraeus, which was en route from Lebanon to Slovakia. In the same month, 5.3 million Captagon pills hidden in fruits imported from Lebanon were seized by authorities in Saudi Arabia. In May 2021, Lebanese authorities confiscated cocaine hidden in Makdous, destined for Australia. In the same month, Lebanese customs at Beirut Airport seized 60 tonnes of hashish, intended to be exported to the Netherlands.

=== Mexico ===
Government corruption has been a long-standing problem in Mexico. Drug cartels have been influential in Mexican politics, contributing large sums of money into Mexican electoral campaigns, supporting candidates sensitive to bribery in order to keep their businesses safe. Since the early 20th century, drug trafficking had been tolerated by the Mexican government. Since 1929, the dominant party of Mexico, the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), forged ties with various groups in order to gain political influence. Among them were drug traffickers. The ties between the PRI and the drug lords sustained an alliance with the drug traffickers and sanctioned their activities.

During the 1980s and 1990s, the drug trade in Mexico accelerated. Before the 1980s most of Mexico produced marijuana and a small amount of heroin. Cocaine mostly reached the US through the Bahamas and the Caribbean. After the US shut down the routes that entered the state of Florida, Colombian drug cartels established a partnership with Mexican traffickers, finding new routes by which to smuggle cocaine over land into North America. A few small Mexican cartels merged into the Guadalajara cartel, led by Miguel Ángel Félix Gallardo. The Guadalajara cartel trafficked the cocaine produced by the Colombian Calí cartel, while expanding marijuana production in rural areas of Mexico.
The US established a special force, named the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), to fight a war on drugs within their own borders and beyond. The DEA office in Mexico received extra resources to investigate the murder of one of their own agents, Enrique &quot;Kiki&quot; Camarena, who was abducted, tortured and murdered by a state police officer paid by members of the cartel. Their investigation confirmed the corruption that gripped Mexico in the 1980s and 1990s. However, not only police officers on the payroll obeyed Miguel Ángel Félix Gallardo and his cartel. Investigations show transactions to high officers in the federal government, such as the Federal Directorate of Security and the Mexican Federal Judicial Police.

The Mexican Drug War in 2006, initiated by Mexico&#x27;s newly elected president, Felipe Calderón, began a government armed effort to fight the drug cartels in Mexico. Calderón&#x27;s predecessor, Vicente Fox, elected in 2000, had been the first Mexican president from outside the PRI. However, despite Calderón&#x27;s efforts, the PRI was returned to power in 2012 with the election of Enrique Peña Nieto.

During the court hearing for the most wanted cartel leader, Joaquín &quot;El Chapo&quot; Guzmán, it was alleged that former president Enrique Peña Nieto had accepted a $100 million bribe from the drug kingpin.

=== Myanmar ===

Myanmar is the second-largest opium producing nation in the world, only behind Afghanistan. The opium trade network in Myanmar indirectly created a network widely known as the Golden Triangle, a term coined by the CIA, in the area around the Myanmar, Laos, and Thailand border. Opium production in Myanmar dates back to during the period of the Konbaung dynasty.

In aftermath of the Chinese civil war, some Kuomintang loyalists became involved in the opium trade in Burma. Most of the opium produced by the former Kuomintang soldiers was shipped south to Thailand. One of the most notorious figures in Myanmar drug business was Khun Sa, who was also trained by Burmese Army and the Kuomintang. Khun Sa&#x27;s operations were said to have dominated the drug trade network in the Golden Triangle area, earning him the title &quot;Opium King&quot;. Khun Sa&#x27;s influence began to decline in 1990&#x27;s, and he surrendered himself to the authorities in 1996.

=== North Korea ===
The international isolation imposed on North Korea has made the North Korean regime rely on illicit activities such as the drug trade to support its economy. The North Korean regime was known to have operated drug trading activities varying from opium to methamphetamine. The regime&#x27;s drug trade network dates back to the 1970s, when then leader Kim Il Sung sanctioned the creation of opium farms in the country. The methamphetamine trade dates back to around the 1990s, with the regime known to have trafficked drugs to China&#x27;s Jilin Province, later being sent to countries such as the Philippines, the United States, Hong Kong, Thailand, western Africa and others. In 2001, income from illegal drugs amounted to between $500 million and $1 billion. In 2003, the North Korean owned cargo ship &quot;Pong Su&quot; was intercepted importing heroin into Australia. The ship was suspected of being involved in smuggling almost 125 kilograms (276 lb) of the drug into Australia, with an estimated street value of A$160 million.

=== Netherlands ===
As early as 1996, the Netherlands was labelled as a narco-state in a French government report. Since then, the question of whether the Netherlands is actually a narco-state has been asked many times, and the answer depends strongly on which characteristics are attributed to a narco-state. In any case, the size of the drug sector in the Netherlands suggests that drug crime has been a persistent problem in the Netherlands for years, and that the fight against it constantly poses complex questions to politics and criminal justice. In 2018, several police detectives stated in a report by the Dutch Police Association that the Netherlands &quot;already exhibited a painful number of characteristics of a narco-state&quot;. Minister Grapperhaus of Justice and Security stated in a response that the Netherlands is not a narco-state. After the murder of lawyer Derk Wiersum and crime reporter Peter R. de Vries, the qualification of the Netherlands as a narco-state received new attention.

=== Nicaragua ===
After the Nicaraguan Revolution, 
the Sandinista National Liberation Front, led by Daniel Ortega, took the national government of Nicaragua from the Somoza dynasty. In 1980s, the Sandinista government was accused of helping Pablo Escobar&#x27;s Medellín Cartel by giving him access to a drug trafficking corridor within Nicaragua. According to the United States diplomatic cables leak, Ortega was said to receive drug money in order to influence the 2008 local elections in the country. Another cable also stated that Nicaraguan officials returned from Venezuela with a briefcase full of cash, indicating potential government involvement with drug cartels.

=== Panama ===

The dictatorship of Manuel Noriega operated a state sponsored drug trade network which gave Panama a reputation of being a narco-state at the time. Noriega was well known to be involved in illegal drugs and arms trade which was dubbed as his &quot;cash cow&quot;. Between 1981 and 1987, the Noriega regime had a cordial relationship with the United States due to a mutual interest where the Noriega administration helped arming the Contras in Nicaragua, in exchange for which the US ignored Noriega&#x27;s illegal activities. Noriega&#x27;s involvement in drug trafficking grew rapidly in the 1980s, reaching its peak in 1984. The conflict in Colombia and Central American countries gave Noriega the opportunity to transport cocaine to United States. Noriega&#x27;s regime also formed an alliance with the Medellín Cartel. However, in 1984, Noriega began to reduce his drug operation by targeting Jorge Ochoa&#x27;s and Gilberto Rodríguez Orejuela&#x27;s money laundering operations in order to clean his reputation, which gave him a positive image among American government elites. In the late 80&#x27;s the Noriega regime&#x27;s relations with the United States deteriorated after Noriega was accused of selling intelligence to Cuba. It was also reported that Hugo Spadafora, Noriega&#x27;s most prominent critic, reported Noriega&#x27;s drug operations to the Drug Enforcement Administration. The United States would later invade Panama and capture Noriega, ending his regime. Noriega was later trialed in three countries; France, the United States, and Panama. He eventually died in 2017.

=== Suriname ===
Suriname has been labeled as a narco-state due to the involvement of President Dési Bouterse and his family in drug trafficking. Bouterse was sentenced &quot;in absentia&quot; in the Netherlands to 11 years&#x27; imprisonment after being convicted of trafficking of cocaine. His son Dino Bouterse has been arrested twice in three different countries and is currently serving 16 years imprisonment in the United States on a charge of drug trafficking.

=== Syria ===

Syria was home to a burgeoning black market drug industry run by associates and relatives of the former Syrian dictator, Bashar al-Assad. The industry was run by a clandestine network of warlords, drug cartels, crime families and business men loyal to the Assad dynasty, operating across the regions of Syria and Lebanon. It mainly produced captagon, an addictive amphetamine popular in the Arab world. Another major drug which was manufactured and smuggled globally is hashish. As of 2021, the export of illegal drugs eclipsed the country&#x27;s legal exports, leading the &quot;New York Times&quot; to call Syria &quot;the world&#x27;s newest narcostate&quot;. The drug exports allowed the Assad regime to generate hard currency, pay daily wages for the deteriorating state army, finance private militias and hire mercenaries. Centre of Operational Analysis and Research reported in 2021 that the Assad regime has turned Syria into &quot;the global epicentre of Captagon production, which is now more industrialised, adaptive, and technically sophisticated than ever.&quot;

During its occupation of Lebanon between 1976–2005, the Assad regime used its proxies in Lebanon for establishing its multi-billion dollar drug industry. Syria was labeled as a narco-state by the United States for nearly a decade until 1997. Throughout the Syrian occupation of Lebanon when they controlled the cannabis cultivation in the Beqaa Valley in Lebanon, the Assad regime was the Middle East&#x27;s main source of hashish.
During the Syrian Civil War, the Assad regime began mass production of drugs within Syria, and officers fed their men fenethylline, which they called &quot;Captain Courage.&quot; Several shipments containing tonnes of amphetamines were seized in different countries smuggled from Syria, those shipments had sometimes millions of pills of fenethylline, produced in the country since at least 2006. After 2013, captogen production and export in Syria skyrocketed, with the direct support of the Assad regime, and its multi-billion dollar profits exceeded the total GDP. By 2020, Syria had become the world&#x27;s biggest centre of captogen production, sales and exports. 

In November 2020, two drug shipments of hashish coming from Syria were seized by Egyptian authorities, the first shipment which arrived to Alexandria, included 2 tonnes of hashish, while the second shipment had 6 tonnes and was found at the Damietta port. The port of Latakia became under scrutiny of European and American police, as being favored by smugglers. In May 2021, Turkish security forces used UAVs to stop 1.5 tonnes of marijuana being smuggled out of Syria. According to the Centre for Operational Analysis and Research (COAR), Syrian seized drugs in 2020 had the value of no less than $3.4bn.

In late November 2024, Syrian opposition rebels took control of much of Syria, causing Bashar al-Assad and his family to flee the country to Russia, a longtime ally. The Syrian transitional government ordered the cessation of the drug trade.

=== Venezuela ===
More recently, Venezuela has been labeled a narco-state, due to the relations between some Venezuelan government officials to drug cartels and criminal factions all across Latin America. For example, former vice president of Venezuela Tareck el Aissami has been accused of supporting drug trafficking and helping Mexican drug cartels. El Aissami has been sanctioned by the United States since 2017. The nephews and sons of Venezuela&#x27;s president Nicolas Maduro are also being accused of financing drug trades and being involved in the Narcosobrinos affair. In November 2017, the United States ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley accused Venezuela of being a &quot;dangerous narco-state&quot;.

<text>Ramón López Irizarry (July 25, 1897 – October 8, 1982) was an educator and scientist who invented an easier way to extract the cream from coconut pulp, and developed the original formula of Coco López.

==Early years==
Ramón López Irizarry, born in Cabo Rojo, Puerto Rico, was a professor of agricultural sciences at the University of Puerto Rico. In the late 1940s, the Government of Puerto Rico gave a grant to the University of Puerto Rico to assist in the development of Puerto Rican industries.

==Coco López==

In 1949, López Irizarry, with the use of some of these funds, was able to work in his laboratory on an idea that he had. López Irizarry set out to find an easier way to extract the cream from the coconut pulp. The heart of the coconut has always been an important ingredient in many of the desserts in Puerto Rico. The main problem was extracting the coconut cream from the pulp which was a difficult task. López Irizarry discovered an easier way by blending the cream from the hearts of the Caribbean coconuts with an exact proportion of natural cane sugar. He named the product which he developed &quot;Coco López&quot;.

López Irizarry kept the ingredients of the product a secret. The project was so successful that López Irizarry soon left the University and commercialized it. Coco López became the basis for the famous piña colada drink, which made its first appearance in 1954. The piña colada is also known as the &quot;Official Beverage of Puerto Rico&quot;.

==Later years==
López Irizarry was very successful. He packaged his product at the Industrias La Famosa canning factory, owned by Wilbert Parkhurst and family, for years. In 1966, he sold the brand to the Parkhurst family who later forged a deal with David Ballachow to distribute the product in the United States. Eventually the Parkhurst family sold the brand to the Borden company. López Irizarry&#x27;s Coco López can be found in supermarkets worldwide.

==Personal life==
López Irizarry was married to Georgina Ramírez Banuchi and had four children: Rosabel, Myrna, Ramón and Jorge. He resided in Ocean Park, San Juan, where he spent his last years. Ramón López Irizarry died a multi-millionaire on October 8, 1982. He was buried at Cementerio Buxeda in Carolina, Puerto Rico.

<text>Do Rabbits Wonder? is the first full-length album released by Whirlwind Heat, recorded and produced by Jack White of the White Stripes as the debut album of his imprint label on V2 Records, Third Man Records.

== Critical reception ==

&quot;Do Rabbits Wonder?&quot; received generally positive reviews from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 62, based on 13 reviews.

AllMusic&#x27;s Heather Phares praised the band for displaying their idiosyncratic sludge rock with gusto and charm throughout the color-filled track list, concluding that the band&#x27;s &quot;major-label-level exposure is almost as refreshing as its noisy weirdness.&quot; Tom Moon of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; praised the album for utilizing the punk blues formula set by the White Stripes and adding their own take on it, concluding that the result is &quot;the kinetic rush of vintage punk minus the self-conscious nostalgia, the discipline of pop songcraft with, thankfully, no sugar added.&quot;
Jason Jackowiak of Splendid was mixed about the album, saying that there were great ideas heard throughout but were brought down by the instruments taking away the songs&#x27; melody, concluding that: &quot;Any hopes that their label boss/producer might plug in and inject some six-string vitality into the humdrum proceeding are dashed to bits as &quot;Grey&quot; fizzles out in a tempest of gargling mini-moog.&quot;

Cam Lindsay of No Ripcord was also intrigued by the band&#x27;s approach to their music with the color-coded track list but was put off by the instrumentation being overly idiosyncratic and stripping the melody away from the songs, saying that &quot;for those who have difficulty trusting the hype, &quot;Do Rabbits Wonder?&quot; is just too much of a silly mess to really enjoy.&quot; &quot;Pitchfork&quot;″s Eric Carr heavily panned the album, criticizing the band for being similar to Devo but with misused vocals and instruments that become incoherent arrangements that are hard to listen to, concluding that, &quot;If nothing else can be said in its favor, this is music that will instantly, violently polarize people: some folks&#x27; inner masochists may welcome it as an alternative to self-flagellation; personally, I&#x27;d rather take sandpaper across my corneas than sit through this thing again.&quot; He also singled out Jack White, V2 and &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s promotion of the band for the album&#x27;s creation.

Stephen Siegel of &quot;Tucson Weekly&quot; wrote: &quot;Chock full of Moogs, herky-jerky guitars and grating vocals, this has to be one of the least commercially viable albums ever released on a major label--which, in the case of, say, &quot;Trout Mask Replica&quot;, was a good thing, but in this case, it is not.&quot;

<text>Abu Gorab (Arabic: أبو غراب , also known as Abu Gurab, Abu Ghurab) is a locality in Egypt situated south of Cairo, between Saqqarah and Al-Jīzah, about north of Abusir, on the edge of the desert plateau on the western bank of the Nile. The locality is best known for the solar temple of King Nyuserre Ini, the largest and best preserved solar temple, as well as the solar temple of Userkaf, both built in the 25th century BCE during the Old Kingdom Period. Evidence suggests that as many as six solar temples were constructed during the 5th Dynasty, however, only the two temples previously mentioned (Nyussere&#x27;s and Userkaf&#x27;s) have been excavated. Abu Gorab is also the site of an Early Dynastic burial ground dating back to the First Dynasty.

==Early dynastic cemetery==
North of Nyuserre&#x27;s sun temple is a cemetery dating back to the First Dynasty of Egypt (c. 3100–2900 BCE), where people belonging to the middle ranks of the Ancient Egyptian society were buried. The area was primarily used as a burial site during the 5th dynasty and became nearly obsolete as a necropolis after the 5th dynasty.

==Sun temple of Nyuserre Ini==

The Sun Temple of Nyuserre was excavated by Egyptologists Ludwig Borchardt and Friedrich Willhelm von Bissing sometime between 1898 and 1901, on behalf of the Berlin Museum. The sun temple is situated near Memphis, and is closely linked with the Abusir necropolis, both geographically and functionally.

The temple was constructed on the orders of Nyuserre Ini, sixth king of the Fifth Dynasty of Egypt. The exact dates of his reign are unknown but it is estimated that he came to the throne early in the second half of the 25th century BCE. Nyuserre also built a pyramid complex in what was then the royal necropolis, to the south of Abu Gorab in Abusir. The temple was probably constructed late during Nyuserre&#x27;s reign. It was built in honor of the Egyptian Sun god Ra and named (&quot;Ssp-ib-R’&quot;) meaning “Re’s Favorite Place” or &quot;Joy of Re.&quot;

The temple consists of a rectangular walled enclosure, 100 by 76 meters with an entrance situated on the eastern face. The complex is primarily built out of mudbrick covered with limestone, and is situated on the shores of the ancient Abusir lake bed. The main temple was built on a natural hill that had been enhanced. Artificial terraces on this hill were created, which then served as the foundation for the temple. Entrance to the temple is gained through a small structure called the Valley Temple, on the eastern edge of the complex. It is partially submerged and has suffered extensive damage. It is known that an entrance corridor ran from the portico through the building and led to a causeway on the opposite side. 

Inside the temple is a large, open courtyard. At the western end of the courtyard lie the ruins of a colossal stone obelisk. The obelisk had a pedestal red-granite base, sloping sides, and a square top. The obelisk itself, however, was constructed out of irregularly shaped limestone blocks. Estimates of the combined height of the obelisk and base vary, although the obelisk was most likely between thirty-five and fifty meters tall. An altar is located in the center of the courtyard, near the eastern face of the obelisk. It was constructed from five large blocks of alabaster, which are arranged to form a symbol that has been translated as &quot;May Ra be satisfied&quot;. Records recovered from Userkaf&#x27;s sun temple, suggest that two oxen and two geese were sacrificed each day. On the North side of the courtyard are the remains of several storerooms, which may have been where the sacrificial animals were slaughtered.

Along the east wall of the courtyard are a set of nine circular alabaster basins. It has been theorized that there were originally ten basins. Some scholars believe these basins were used to collect blood from animal sacrifice. To support this hypothesis, they point to evidence of grooves cut into the stone floor of the courtyard that may have been used to drain away the blood. Other researchers, however, think that the basins were probably only symbolic, or decorative, since no knives or other equipment related to sacrifice have been discovered in the area. It has also been hypothesized that these basins were used as leveling devices for large areas, linked together and filled with water to provide a common point of reference. Further examination, however, is required to determine the exact role of the alabaster bins.

A large, 30 x 10 m brick built sun barque buried in a mud-brick chamber was excavated to the south of the temple.
In the covered corridor, on the east and southern edges of the temple, there were carved reliefs along the interior walls. The passageway was decorated with relief scenes depicting the sed-festival, an important Ancient Egyptian ritual of renewal. These carvings highlight &quot;Re&#x27;s&quot; beneficent attitude towards Nyuserre&#x27;s reign through episodes of the sed-festival. Such depictions, in fact, represent the most detailed display of this theme from the Old Kingdom. Similar sed-festival scenes also appear in the chapel towards the southern edge of the chapel. Additionally, in the short passageway connecting to the obelisk platform from the south, known as the Room of the Seasons, are detailed painted reliefs in limestone depicting two of the three Egyptian seasons, &quot;akhet (inundation) and shemu (harvest).&quot; The reliefs from the Room of the Seasons essentially illustrate the sun&#x27;s life-giving and sustaining role in nature, particularly during the spring and summer seasons. Accompanying these seasonal scenes are illustrations of seasonal activities (i.e. netting fish, trapping birds, making papyrus boats, and phases of the agricultural cycle). The vast illustrations of animal and plant life as well as human engagement with nature may be some of the earliest extensive corpus of such scenes. The artwork was likely commissioned by King Nyuserre himself. Although, the reliefs do not reflect typical royal funerary decoration scene during The Old Kingdom, and although skilfully designed, they are not as carefully executed as similar carvings from the 4th and early 5th dynasties. The image to the right shows a fragmented relief from the temple. The carving portrays Egyptians trapping birds in a clap net. The clap net itself is missing, but six men are shown in the lower register holding the rope that will pull the net shut. In the upper right register, two figures are shown caging two birds that have already been caught, while in the upper left corner, a cow and her calf make up the remnants of a much larger animal husbandry scene. Nearly all reliefs at the site were removed, mostly to German collections, and many perished during World War II. Unfortunately as a result, today nearly all reliefs have been either destroyed or severely fragmented.

==Other ruins==
The German archaeological expedition under the direction of Friedrich Wilhelm von Bissing uncovered the ruins of large buildings of mudbricks beneath the sun temple of Nyuserre in Abu Gorab. It is possible that these represent the remains of the sun temple of Neferefre, called &quot;Ra Hotep&quot;, &quot;Ra&#x27;s offering table&quot;, although this is still conjectural.

In August 2022, archaeologists from the Polish Academy of Sciences in Warsaw announced the discovery of a 4,500-year-old temple dedicated to the Egyptian sun god Ra. The recently discovered sun temple was made from mud bricks and was about 60 meters long by 20 m wide. According to Massimiliano Nuzzolo, co-director of the excavation, storage rooms and other rooms may have been served for cultic purposes and the walls of the building were all plastered in black and white. The L-shaped entrance portico had two limestone columns and was partly made of white limestone. Dozens of well-preserved beer jars and several well-made and red-lined vessels, seal impressions, including seals of the pharaohs who ruled during the fifth and sixth dynasties were also uncovered. One of the earliest seals might belonged to pharaoh Shepseskare, who ruled Egypt before Nyuserre.

<text>The Palais-Royal () is a former French royal palace located on Rue Saint-Honoré in the 1st arrondissement of Paris. The screened entrance court faces the Place du Palais-Royal, opposite the Louvre. Originally called the Palais-Cardinal, it was built for Cardinal Richelieu from about 1633 to 1639 by architect Jacques Lemercier. Richelieu bequeathed it to Louis XIII, before Louis XIV gave it to his younger brother, Philippe I, Duke of Orléans. As the succeeding Dukes of Orléans made such extensive alterations over the years, almost nothing remains of Lemercier&#x27;s original design.

The Palais-Royal is now the seat of the Ministry of Culture, the Conseil d&#x27;État and the Constitutional Council. The central Palais-Royal Garden (Jardin du Palais-Royal) serves as a public park; its arcade houses shops.

==History==
===Palais-Cardinal===
Originally called the Palais-Cardinal, the palace was the personal residence of Cardinal Richelieu.
The architect Jacques Lemercier began his design in 1629; Construction commenced in 1633 and was completed in 1639. The gardens were begun in 1629 by Jean Le Nôtre (father of André Le Nôtre), Simon Bouchard, and Pierre I Desgots, to a design created by Jacques Boyceau. Upon Richelieu&#x27;s death in 1642 the palace became the property of the King and acquired the new name &quot;Palais-Royal&quot;.

After Louis XIII died the following year, it became the home of the Queen Mother Anne of Austria and her young sons Louis XIV and Philippe, duke of Anjou, along with her advisor Cardinal Mazarin.

From 1649, the palace was the residence of the exiled Henrietta Maria and Henrietta Anne Stuart, wife and daughter of the deposed King Charles I of England. The two had escaped England in the midst of the English Civil War and were sheltered by Henrietta Maria&#x27;s nephew, King Louis XIV.

The Palais Brion, a separate section near the rue de Richelieu to the west of the Palais-Royal, was purchased by Louis XIV from the heirs of Cardinal Richelieu. Louis had it connected to the Palais-Royal. It was at the Palais Brion that Louis had his mistress Louise de La Vallière stay while his affair with Madame de Montespan was still an &quot;official&quot; secret.

===Philippe I, Duke of Orléans===
Henrietta Anne was married to Louis&#x27; younger brother, Philippe I, Duke of Orléans in the palace chapel on 31 March 1661. After their marriage, Louis XIV allowed his brother and wife to use the Palais-Royal as their main Paris residence. The following year the new duchess gave birth to a daughter, Marie Louise d&#x27;Orléans, inside the palace. She created the ornamental gardens of the palace, which were said to be among the most beautiful in Paris. Under the new ducal couple, the Palais-Royal would become the social center of the capital.

The palace was redecorated and new apartments were created for the Duchess&#x27;s maids and staff. Several of the women who later came to be favourites to King Louis XIV were from her household: Louise de La Vallière, who gave birth there to two sons of the King, in 1663 and 1665; Françoise-Athénaïs, marquise de Montespan, who supplanted Louise; and Angélique de Fontanges, who was in service to the second Duchess of Orléans.

The court gatherings at the Palais-Royal were famed all around the capital as well as all of France. It was at these parties that the &quot;crème de la crème&quot; of French society came to see and be seen. Guests included the main members of the royal family like the Queen Mother, Anne of Austria; Anne, Duchess of Montpensier, the Princes of Condé and of Conti. Philippe&#x27;s favourites were also frequent visitors.

After Henrietta Anne died in 1670 the Duke took a second wife, the Princess Palatine, who preferred to live in the Château de Saint-Cloud. Saint-Cloud thus became the main residence of her eldest son and the heir to the House of Orléans, Philippe Charles d&#x27;Orléans known as the Duke of Chartres.

The Académie Royale de Peinture et de Sculpture occupied the Palais Brion from 1661 to 1691 and shared it with the Académie Royale d&#x27;Architecture from 1672. The royal collection of antiquities was installed there under the care of the art critic and official court historian André Félibien, who was appointed in 1673.

About 1674 the Duke of Orléans had André Le Nôtre redesign the gardens of the Palais-Royal.

After the dismissal of Madame de Montespan and the arrival of her successor, Madame de Maintenon, who forbade any lavish entertainment at Versailles, the Palais-Royal was again a social highlight.

In 1692, on the occasion of the marriage of the duke of Chartres to Françoise Marie de Bourbon, &quot;Mademoiselle de Blois&quot;, a legitimised daughter of Louis XIV and Madame de Montespan, the King deeded the Palais-Royal to his brother. The new couple did not occupy the northeast wing, where Anne of Austria had originally lived, but instead chose to reside in the Palais Brion. For the convenience of the bride, new apartments were built and furnished in the wing facing east on the rue de Richelieu.

It was at this time that Philippe commissioned a Grande Galerie along the rue de Richelieu for his famous Orleans Collection of paintings, which was easily accessible to the public. Designed by the architect Jules Hardouin-Mansart, it was constructed around 1698–1700 and painted with Virgilian subjects by Coypel. The cost of this reconstruction totaled about 400,000 &quot;livres&quot;. Hardouin-Mansart&#x27;s assistant, François d&#x27;Orbay, prepared a general site plan, showing the Palais-Royal before these alterations were made.

===Philippe II, Duke of Orléans===
When the Duke of Orléans died in 1701, his son became the head of the House of Orléans. The new Duke and Duchess of Orléans took up residence at the Palais-Royal. Two of their daughters, Charlotte Aglaé d&#x27;Orléans, later the Duchess of Modena, and Louise Diane d&#x27;Orléans, later the Princess of Conti, were born there.

At the death of Louis XIV in 1715, his five-year-old great-grandson succeeded him. The Duke of Orléans became Regent for the young Louis XV, setting up the country&#x27;s government at the Palais-Royal, while the young king lived at the nearby Tuileries Palace. The Palais-Royal housed the magnificent Orleans Collection of some 500 paintings, which was arranged for public viewing until it was sold abroad in 1791.

He commissioned Gilles-Marie Oppenord to redesign the apartments of the Duchess on the ground floor in 1716 and to decorate the Grand Appartement of the Palais Brion in the light and lively &quot;style Régence&quot; that foreshadowed the Rococo, as well as the Regent&#x27;s more intimate &quot;petits appartements&quot;. Oppenord also made changes to the Grande Galerie of the Palais Brion and created a distinctive Salon d&#x27;Angle, which connected the Grand Appartement to the Grande Galerie along the rue de Richelieu (1719–20; visible on the 1739 Turgot map of Paris). All of this work was lost, when the Palais Brion was demolished in 1784 for the construction of the Salle Richelieu, now hosting the Comédie-Française.

===Louis d&#x27;Orléans===
After the Regency, the social life of the palace became much more subdued. Louis XV moved the court back to Versailles and Paris was again ignored. The same happened with the Palais-Royal. Louis d&#x27;Orléans succeeded his father as the new duke of Orléans in 1723. He and his son Louis Philippe lived at the other family residence in Saint-Cloud, which had been empty since the death of the Princess Palatine in 1722.

Claude Desgots redesigned the gardens of the Palais-Royal in 1729.

===Louis Philippe I===
In 1752 Louis Philippe I succeeded his father as the duke of Orléans. The Palais-Royal was soon the scene of the notorious debaucheries of Louise Henriette de Bourbon who had married to Louis Philippe in 1743. New apartments (located in what is now the northern section of the Rue-de-Valois wing) were added for her in the early 1750s by the architect Pierre Contant d&#x27;Ivry. She died at the age of thirty-two in 1759. She was the mother of Louis Philippe II, Duke of Orléans, later known as &quot;Philippe Égalité&quot;. A few years after the death of Louise Henriette, her husband secretly married his mistress, the witty marquise de Montesson, and the couple lived at the Château de Sainte-Assise where he died in 1785. Just before his death, he completed the sale of the Château de Saint-Cloud to Queen Marie Antoinette.

===Louis Philippe II===
Louis Philippe II, Duke of Orléans was born at Saint-Cloud and later moved to the Palais-Royal and lived there with his wife, the wealthy Louise Marie Adélaïde de Bourbon whom he had married in 1769. The duke controlled the Palais-Royal from 1780 onward. The couple&#x27;s eldest son, Louis-Philippe III d&#x27;Orléans, was born there in 1773. Louis Philippe II succeeded his father as the head of the House of Orléans in 1785.

====Theatres of the Palais-Royal====
The Palais-Royal had contained one of the most important public theatres in Paris, in the east wing on the rue Saint-Honoré (on a site just to the west of what is now the rue de Valois). It was built from 1637 to 1641 to designs by Lemercier and was initially known as the Great Hall of the Palais-Cardinal. This theatre was later used by the troupe of Molière beginning in 1660, by which time it had become known as the Théâtre du Palais-Royal. After Molière&#x27;s death in 1673 the theatre was taken over by Jean-Baptiste Lully, who used it for his Académie Royale de Musique (the official name of the Paris Opera at that time).

The Opera&#x27;s theatre was destroyed by fire in 1763, but was rebuilt to the designs of architect Pierre-Louis Moreau Desproux on a site slightly further to the east (where the rue de Valois is located today) and reopened in 1770. This second theatre continued to be used by the Opera until 1781, when it was also destroyed by fire, but this time it was not rebuilt. Moreau Desproux also designed the adjacent surviving entrance façades of the Palais-Royal.

At the request of Louis Philippe II two new theatres were constructed in the Palais-Royal complex shortly after the fire. Both of these new theatres were designed by Victor Louis, the architect who also designed the shopping galleries facing the garden (see below). The first theatre, which opened on 23 October 1784, was a small puppet theatre in the northwest corner of the gardens at the intersection of the Galerie de Montpensier and the Galerie de Beaujolais.
Initially it was known as the Théâtre des Beaujolais, then as the Théâtre Montansier, after which Victor Louis enlarged it for the performance of plays and operas. Later, beginning with the political turmoil of the Revolution, this theatre was known by a variety of other names. It was converted to a café with shows in 1812, but reopened as a theatre in 1831, when it acquired the name Théâtre du Palais-Royal, by which it is still known today.


Louis Philippe II&#x27;s second theatre was larger and located near the southwest corner of the complex, on the rue de Richelieu. He originally intended it for the Opera, but that company refused to move into it. Instead he offered it to the Théâtre des Variétés-Amusantes, formerly on the boulevard du Temple but since 1 January 1785 playing in a temporary theatre in the gardens of the Palais-Royal. This company changed its name to Théâtre du Palais-Royal on 15 December 1789, and later moved into the new theatre upon its completion, where they opened on 15 May 1790. On 25 April 1791 the anti-royalist faction of the Comédie-Française, led by Talma, left that company&#x27;s theatre on the left bank (at that time known as the Théâtre de la Nation, but today as the Odéon), and joined the company on the rue de Richelieu, which promptly changed its name to Théâtre Français de la rue de Richelieu. With the founding of the French Republic in September 1792 the theatre&#x27;s name was changed again, to Théâtre de la République. In 1799 the players of the split company reunited at the Palais-Royal, and the theatre officially became the Comédie-Française, also commonly known as the Théâtre-Français, names which it retains to this day.

====Shopping arcades====

Louis Philippe II also had Victor Louis build six-story apartment buildings with ground-floor colonnades facing the three sides of the palace garden between 1781 and 1784. On the outside of these wings three new streets were constructed in front of the houses that had formerly overlooked the garden: the rue de Montpensier on the west, rue de Beaujolais to the north, and rue de Valois on the east. He commercialised the new complex by letting out the area under the colonnades to retailers and service-providers and in 1784 the shopping and entertainment complex opened to the public. Over a decade or so, sections of the Palais were transformed into shopping arcades that became the centre of 18th-century Parisian economic and social life.

Though the main part of the palace (&quot;corps de logis&quot;) remained the private Orléans seat, the arcades surrounding its public gardens had 145 boutiques, cafés, salons, hair salons, bookshops, museums, and countless refreshment kiosks. These retail outlets sold luxury goods such as fine jewelry, furs, paintings and furniture to the wealthy elite. Stores were fitted with long glass windows which allowed the emerging middle-classes to window shop and indulge in fantasies. Thus, the Palais-Royal became one of the first of the new style of shopping arcades and became a popular venue for the wealthy to congregate, socialise and enjoy their leisure time. The redesigned palace complex became one of the most important marketplaces in Paris. It was frequented by the aristocracy, the middle classes, and the lower orders. It had a reputation as being a site of sophisticated conversation (revolving around the salons, cafés, and bookshops), shameless debauchery (it was a favorite haunt of local prostitutes), as well as a hotbed of Freemasonic activity.

Designed to attract the genteel middle class, the Palais-Royal sold luxury goods at relatively high prices. However, prices were never a deterrent, as these new arcades came to be the place to shop and to be seen. Arcades offered shoppers the promise of an enclosed space away from the chaos that characterised the noisy, dirty streets; a warm, dry space away from the elements; and a safe-haven where people could socialise and spend their leisure time. Promenading in the arcades became a popular eighteenth century pastime for the emerging middle classes.

From the 1780s to 1837, the palace was once again the centre of Parisian political and social intrigue and the site of the most popular cafés. The historic restaurant &quot;Le Grand Véfour&quot;, which opened in 1784, is still there. In 1786, a noon cannon was set up by a philosophical amateur, set on the Paris meridian, in which the sun&#x27;s noon rays, passing through a lens, lit the cannon&#x27;s fuse. The noon cannon is still fired at the Palais-Royal, though most of the ladies for sale have disappeared, those who inspired the Abbé Delille&#x27;s lines:

&lt;poem&gt;
Dans ce jardin on ne rencontre
Ni prés, ni bois, ni fruits, ni fleurs.
Et si l&#x27;on y dérègle ses mœurs,
Au moins on y règle sa montre.
&lt;/poem&gt;

(&quot;In this garden one encounters neither meadows, nor woods, nor fruits, nor flowers. And, if one upsets one&#x27;s morality, at least one may reset one&#x27;s watch.&quot;)


The Cirque du Palais-Royal, constructed in the center of the garden, has been described as &quot;a huge half-subterranean spectacle space of food, entertainments, boutiques, and gaming that ran the length of the park and was the talk of the capital.&quot; It was destroyed by fire on 15 December 1798.

Inspired by the souks of Arabia, the Galerie de Bois, a series of wooden shops linking the ends of the Palais-Royal and enclosing the south end of the garden, was first opened in 1786. For Parisians, who lived in the virtual absence of pavements, the streets were dangerous and dirty; the arcade was a welcome addition to the streetscape as it afforded a safe place where Parisians could window shop and socialise. Thus, the Palais-Royal began what architectural historian describes as &quot;l’Ère des passages couverts&quot; (the Arcade Era), which transformed European shopping habits between 1786 and 1935.

===Palais de l&#x27;Égalité and the Revolution===

During the revolutionary period, Philippe d&#x27;Orléans became known as Philippe Égalité and ruled at the Palais de l&#x27;Égalité, as it was known during the more radical phase of the Revolution. He had made himself popular in Paris when he opened the gardens of the palace to all Parisians. In one of the shops around the garden Charlotte Corday bought the knife she used to stab Jean-Paul Marat. Along the &quot;galeries&quot;, ladies of the night lingered, and smart gambling casinos were lodged in second-floor quarters.

The Marquis de Sade referred to the grounds in front of the palace in his &quot;Philosophy in the Bedroom&quot; (1795) as a place where progressive pamphlets were sold.

Upon the execution of the Duke, the palace&#x27;s ownership lapsed to the state, whence it was called Palais du Tribunat. The Comédie-Française, the state theatre company, was reorganised by Napoleon in the &quot;décret de Moscou&quot; on 15 October 1812, which contains 87 articles.

===Bourbon restoration to Second Empire===

After the Restoration of the Bourbons, at the Palais-Royal the young Alexandre Dumas obtained employment in the office of the powerful Duke of Orléans, who regained control of the palace during the Restoration.

The Duke had Pierre-François-Léonard Fontaine draw up plans to complete work left unfinished by the Duke&#x27;s father. Fontaine&#x27;s most significant work included the western wing of the Cour d&#x27;Honneur, the Aile Montpensier, and with Charles Percier, what was probably the most famous of Paris&#x27;s covered arcades, the Galerie d&#x27;Orléans, enclosing the Cour d&#x27;Honneur on its north side. Both were completed in 1830. The Galerie d&#x27;Orléans was demolished in the 1930s, but its flanking rows of columns still stand between the Cour d&#x27;Honneur and the Palais-Royal Garden.

Following the July Revolution of 1830 when the Duke of Orléans ascended the throne as Louis-Phillipe I, the palace remained the principal residence of the new monarch.

In the Revolution of 1848, a Paris mob attacked and looted the royal residence Palais-Royal, particularly the art collection of King Louis-Philippe. During the Second French Republic, the palace was briefly renamed the &quot;Palais-National&quot;.

During the Second French Empire of Napoleon III, the Palais-Royal became home to the cadet branch of the Bonaparte family, represented by Prince Napoléon-Jérôme Bonaparte, Napoleon III&#x27;s cousin. A lavish dining room was constructed in the Second Empire style, and is now known as the Salle Napoleon of the Council of State.

During the final days of Paris Commune, on May 24, 1871, the palace, seen as a symbol of aristocracy, was set afire by the Communards, but suffered less damage than other government buildings. As a result, it became the temporary (and later permanent) home of several state institutions, including the Conseil d&#x27;Etat, or State Council.

==The Palais-Royal today==

Today, the Palais-Royal is the home of the Conseil d&#x27;État, the Constitutional Council, and the Ministry of Culture.

===South façade===

The buildings of the Palais-Royal face south to the Place du Palais-Royal and the Louvre across the Rue de Rivoli. The central part of the palace is occupied by the Conseil-d&#x27;État, or State Council. It has three floors, and is topped by a low cupola and a rounded pediment filled with sculpture. Two arched passages under the central building lead to the Courtyard of Honor behind. In the east wing, to the right, are offices of the Ministry of Culture and Communication. The two wings of the building have triangular fronts filled with sculpture, inspired by classical architecture and typical of the Louis XIV style.

On the west side of the Council building is Place Colette, and the Salle Richelieu of the Comédie Française. Behind that are the offices of the Constitutional Council. On the left side of the Salle Richelieu is another small square, Place André Malraux.

===Council of State===

The Council of State, created by Napoleon in 1799, inherited many of the functions of the earlier Royal Council, acting both as a consultant to the government and a kind of Supreme Court. It was installed in the Palais-Royal in 1875.

The Conseil has its own courtyard, facing out onto the Place du Palais-Royal and the Rue de Rivoli. Inside is the grand horseshoe stairway of honor, which curves upward along the walls to the landing on the first floor. It is decorated with theatrical effects, including ionic columns, and blind arches giving the illusion of bays. A trompe-l&#x27;oeil painting in an archway appears to give a view of a classical statue, above which putti hold wreathes around a bust of Cardinal Richelieu. The stairway was made by Pierre Contant d&#x27;Ivry in 1765.

The most lavish room of the Council is the Hall of the Tribunal of Conflicts, a kind of courtroom installed in the former dining room of Duchess of Orleans, built by the architect Pierre Contant d&#x27;Ivry in 1753. It still preserves much of its original decoration, with pilasters and columns, and decorative medallions of putti representing the four seasons and the four elements. The ceiling has a trompe l&#x27;oeil painting from 1852 depicting a balustrade and a view of the sky.

The General Assembly chamber was first a chapel, then, under Price Napoleon, a gallery of paintings. It has been changed more than any of the other rooms in the Council. At one end is a long table, with a seat in the center for the Vice President of the Assembly, who chairs the meetings, and the six presidents of the sections of Council. The decoration of the room is particularly rich and varied, with medallions and cameos and allegorical paintings illustrating the various codes of law and the administrative departments. Below these are four more recent large murals, installed between 1916 and 1926, on the theme of France at Work. They depict agriculture (workers in the fields), commerce (the Port of Marseilles), urban labor (Paris workers maintaining the Place de la Concorde), and intellectual labor.

===Ministry of Culture===

The office of the French Minister of Culture is located in the Palais-Royal, in an apartment originally built for the Duke and Duchess of Orleans in 1820, and later occupied by Jérôme Bonaparte in the 1850s. The gilded and highly decorated salon of Jérôme, the younger brother of Napoleon, features sculpture, torchieres and other decoration originally in the throne room of the Tuileries Palace.

===Constitutional Council===
The Constitutional Council occupies an apartment of the palace that was originally built between 1829 and 1831 for the Duke of Chartres, the eldest son of King Louis-Philippe, though he chose to live instead in the Tuileries Palace. After 1859 it was the home of Prince Napoléon Bonaparte the second son of Jérôme Bonaparte, youngest brother of Napoleon I, and his wife, Princess Maria Clotilde of Savoy. The decor made by Fontaine comes from that period.

The grand stairway has two flights of stairs, each with a landing, while the first floor is surrounded by Ionic columns and topped with caisson vaults. Light comes from skylights in the vaults, reflected by rows of mirrors. A marble bust representing Rome, which originally was in the collection of Cardinal Richelieu, decorates the stairway landing. A modern addition is the chandelier made by Claude Lalanne and installed in 1999. The meeting room of the council, the dining room of Prince Napoleon and Marie Clotilde, was made after 1860 by the state architect Pierre Prosper Chabrol with murals in the style of ancient Pompei. One unusual feature of the apartment is the small, windowless oratory, a small place for prayer, with a statue of the Virgin, and walls covered with red and gold fabric, made for Marie Clotilde next to the bedroom. It was restored to its original appearance in 1980.

===Courtyard of Honor===

Behind the Council of State, and separated from the gardens by two rows of columns, which once were part of the Gallery of Orleans, is another courtyard, the Courtyard of Honor, which was created in the 18th century on a foundation made by Victor Louis. Three arcades in the center of the Council building mark the passageway to the front side of the building. The façade facing the courtyard has pairs of Ionic columns topped by a balustrade, decorated with four classical statues, each three meters high, representing Mars, Apollo, and allegorical figures of Prudence and Liberality by the sculptor Augustin Pajou, which had been featured at the Paris Salon of 1769. On the other side of the balustrade are later statues of Commerce and Navigation and figures of Science, Agriculture, by Antoine Gerard, made in about 1830.

In 1985-86 the Ministry of Culture sponsored two sculptural works in the courtyard; the first, called &quot;Photo-Souvenir - Les Deux Plateaux&quot;, by Daniel Buren, consists of short columns of various sizes arranged across the courtyard. The idea is to create two virtual platforms, without floors; the columns vary in height because of differences in height of the illusionary platforms; some of the column rows are purely horizontal, aligned to the height of the column bases of the gallery of Orleans, while the smaller columns all rise to the elevation of a lower non-existent platform; their variation in height is caused by the difference of elevation in parts of the courtyard. Each column has vertical bands of black and white.

The second work is composed of two fountains by sculptor Pol Bury, located within the roofless Gallery of Orleans, which separates the courtyard from the gardens. It consists of two square basins each containing seventeen polished metal spheres of different sizes, with water flowing around them. The polished spheres reflect the architecture of the arcades around them.

A third work, commissioned in 1994 is by the Dutch artist Jan Dibbets, passes through the courtyard of the Palais-Royal. It is called &quot;Homage to Arago&quot;, and is a tribute to the French mathematician François Arago, who first conceived the Paris meridian, the north–south line passing through the center of Paris which marked the prime meridian (rather than Greenwich) on French maps. The work consists of one hundred thirty-five brass small brass plaques with the name &quot;Arago&quot; fixed on the pavement on a line which passes through the Palais-Royal, and extends on the same axis to the north and south across Paris.

===Gardens===

The first garden of the Palais was planted by Cardinal Richelieu in 1629, where the Court of Honor is today. In 1633, Richelieu obtained authorisation to extend the garden northeast into the land occupied by the obsolete medieval city walls of Paris. He also received permission to sell forty-five building sites around the garden. The new garden site was 170 meters by 400 meters, making it the third largest garden in Paris, after the Tuileries Garden and Luxembourg Garden. The new garden featured long alleys shaded by trees, elaborate parterres and flower beds, a fountain in the centre, and a circular water basin at the north end. The master hydraulics engineer Jean-Baptiste Le Tellier designed the fountain, which, like the Louvre Palace, took its water from the La Samaritaine pump on the Seine.

The garden was redesigned several times, notably in 1674 by André Le Nôtre, and his nephew Claude Desgots in 1730. In 1817, under Charles X of France, the main water basin was enlarged to twenty-five meters in diameter, and the longitudinal parterres were remade in 1824. In 1992 the landscape gardener Mark Rudkin created new lawns and flower beds, termed &quot;Salons of greenery&quot;, with seasonal flowers enclosed by grills covered with climbing plants. The garden was classified as a French historical monument in 1920, followed by the rest of the Palais-Royal in 1994.

A small cannon was installed in the middle of the bowling green at the north end of the garden in 1786. It fired a shot each day at noon, regulated by an ingenious mechanism that used a magnifying lens pointed at the sun&#x27;s noontime position to light the match which fired the gunpowder. Between 1891 and 1911, the official noontime in France was defined by the cannon shot. It was stolen in 1998, but recovered and returned to its place in 2002.

The two major alleys of the gardens are named for two of the famous 20th-century residents of the neighbouring buildings, the writers Colette and Jean Cocteau.

===Town houses===

Near the end of the 18th century the architect Victor Louis designed rows of town houses on three sides of the garden, which extend 275 meters on the east and west and about one hundred meters on the north. Each has a gallery and boutiques on the ground floor, topped by an entresol, then residential floors. The entrances are on the streets outside the palace. Louis artfully merged the façades of the houses facing the garden together, giving each wing the appearance of a single long building. The unified sculptural decoration of the façades features classical pilasters, balustrades and bas-relief sculpture.

At first the town houses were rented, but between 1787 and 1790, as the Revolution began, their owner, the Duke of Chartres, sold sixty-seven houses. Colette occupied the entresol of the house at number 9 rue de Beaujolais in 1927, then moved to the first floor from 1938 until 1954. Her friend, the film-maker and writer Jean Cocteau lived on the other side, at 36 rue de Montpensier. They regularly had breakfast together at the Le Grand Vefour restaurant in the arcades. The two alleys in the garden are now named after them.

===Galleries===

The six-story buildings that surround the gardens on three sides have galleries on the ground floor containing shops and restaurants The garden galleries were constructed 1781–1784 to the designs of the Victor Louis. On the west side is the Montpensier Gallery, on the north, the Beaujolais Gallery, and to the east, the Valois Gallery. Traversing the south side of the garden are two parallel colonnades, remnants of the former covered Galerie d&#x27;Orléans (demolished in 1930). They stand between the court of honor and the garden.

===Restaurants - Le Grand Véfour===

The Palais-Royal was famous for its restaurants, particularly following the French Revolution, when chefs of aristocratic families who had fled France opened their own restaurants. One surviving restaurant from this period is Le Grand Véfour, It opened in 1784 as the Café de Chartres. In the 20th century it was a favorite dining spot for Colette and Jean Cocteau, and preserves much of its original decor.

===Theater of the Comédie Française===

The Salle Richelieu, now the principal theater of the Comédie Française, was designed by Victor Louis and completed in 1786. It was inaugurated on 15 May 1790. The theater was extensively remodelled over the years; only the exterior walls and columns of the peristyle of the original theater survive, but the reconstructions have preserved the original plan and style.

The site was quite small for such a large theater, 44 by 32 metres, so Louis was compelled to stack the seven levels of the theater directly on top of the vestibule on the ground floor. The auditorium of the theater is in the form of an oval. Four stairways serve the seven levels. Balconies, loges and galleries fill the different levels. Four massive columns frame the stage. The hall is covered by a large cupola supported by pendentives and decorated with frescoes, The interior is lavishly decorated in blue and green ornamented with gold, colors traditionally associated in the 18th century with classical theatres. Louis built the cupola with a metallic framework, which saved the structure when a fire struck the theater in 1900. The theater today can hold 2,000 spectators.

===Théâtre du Palais-Royal===

The Théâtre du Palais-Royal is located on the northwest corner of the Palais-Royal, in the Galerie de Montpensier at its intersection with the Galerie de Beaujolais. It has 750 seats. The first theatre was built in 1784 by Victor Louis for the marionette theater of the Count of Beaujolais on its first floor. This was purchased in 1789 by the theatrical producer Mademoiselle Montansier, who had Louis rebuild it in 1791 into a larger variety theater, called the Montpensier-Variétés. The scandalous varieties of entertainment, and frequentation by prostitutes, who sought clients in the galleries of the Palais-Royal, led to the theater being closed down in 1806. In 1831, under the new regime of King Louis-Philippe, it was rebuilt and reopened as a legitimate theater, staging the plays of Victorien Sardou and Eugene Labiche among others. Concerns about theater fires caused the reconstruction in 1887 of the façade, with elaborate tiers of cast-iron fire escapes and polychrome ceramics. The architect of the façade was Paul Sédille, who also designed the interior of the Printemps department store (1881–89). The theatre is now classified as a French historical monument.

<text>&quot;Stuck in the Middle with You&quot; (sometimes known as &quot;Stuck in the Middle&quot;) is a song written by Scottish musicians Gerry Rafferty and Joe Egan and performed by their band Stealers Wheel.

The band performed the song on the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; in May 1973, and the song charted at No. 8 in the UK Singles Chart. It also became an international hit, reaching No. 6 in the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100.

==Overview==
&quot;Stuck in the Middle&quot; was first included on Stealers Wheel&#x27;s 1972 eponymous debut album. Gerry Rafferty provided the lead vocals, with Joe Egan singing harmony. It was produced by Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller. Rafferty&#x27;s lyrics are a dismissive tale of a music industry cocktail party (the clowns and jokers would be all the music executives and hangers on), written and performed as a parody of Bob Dylan&#x27;s style; the vocal impression, subject, and styling were so similar, listeners have wrongly attributed the song to Dylan since its release.

The song was released as a single in 1973 and the band was surprised by its chart success. The single sold over one million copies, eventually peaking at No. 6 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart, No. 8 in the UK, and No. 2 in Canada. &quot;Billboard&quot; ranked it as the No. 36 song for 1973.

The band appeared playing the song on BBC&#x27;s &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; on 18 May 1973.

==Music video==
The video portrays the band performing in a corner of a large, empty building. Their performance is intercut with shots of Egan, miming to a vocal track by Rafferty (who had by then left the band), at a small banquet table with a number of garishly dressed and made-up supper guests. These include an actual clown, a bespectacled bowler-hatted gent devouring spaghetti and a lavishly dressed woman eating cream cakes and grapes. The clown, who has difficulty eating a plastic chicken, continually squeezes Egan out whenever he tries to take food from the table. The guitar solo is played on a guitar played flat with an empty beer bottle used as a slide. Eventually, the other band members appear, driving off the strange characters so that Egan can sit down at last.

==Cover versions==
English singer Louise recorded a cover that was released on 27 August 2001. Her version reached number four on the UK Singles Chart in September 2001.

Lazlo Bane released a cover on the album &quot;Guilty Pleasures&quot; in 2007. Their version was used in the film &quot;Let&#x27;s Be Cops&quot; and included on the soundtrack.

A cover version by Grace Potter was used as the theme song for the Netflix series &quot;Grace and Frankie&quot;, and appears in full on the &quot;Grace and Frankie (Original Television Soundtrack).&quot;

==In popular culture==
The song is used in Quentin Tarantino&#x27;s 1992 debut film &quot;Reservoir Dogs&quot;, during the scene in which the character Mr. Blonde (played by Michael Madsen) taunts and tortures bound policeman Marvin Nash (Kirk Baltz) while singing and dancing to the song. In an interview with &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, Tarantino recalled:

That was one of those things where I thought [the song] would work really well, and [during] auditions, I told the actors that I wanted them to do the torture scene, and I&#x27;m gonna use &quot;Stuck in the Middle with You&quot;, but they could pick anything they wanted, they didn&#x27;t have to use that song. And a couple of people picked another one, but almost everyone came in with &quot;Stuck in the Middle with You&quot;, and they were saying that they tried to come up with something else, but that&#x27;s the one. The first time somebody actually did the torture scene to that song, the guy didn&#x27;t even have a great audition, but it was like watching the movie. I was thinking, &quot;Oh my God, this is gonna be awesome!&quot;

The song appears in a 2020 TV commercial for IBM.

The song is used as the theme song for SiriusXM Radio&#x27;s &quot;The Michael Smerconish Program&quot; and snippets from various cover versions of the song are used as the show&#x27;s inter-segment &quot;bumper&quot; music.

<text>Saint Paul Union Depot is a historic railroad station and intermodal transit hub in the Lowertown neighborhood of Saint Paul, Minnesota. It serves light rail, intercity rail, intercity bus, and local bus services.

It is the eastern terminus for the METRO Green Line light rail line, with the stop located outside the station&#x27;s headhouse. It is also the Twin Cities&#x27; stop for Amtrak, the national intercity railroad service. In addition to rail, Union Depot also serves Metro Transit, Minnesota Valley Transit Authority (MVTA), Jefferson Lines, Greyhound Lines, and Megabus.

The headhouse, located at the 4th Street entrance, was designed by architect Charles Sumner Frost and is neoclassical in style. The concourse and the waiting room that extend over the tracks are viewed as a great architectural achievement. The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1974. It is also a contributing property to the Lowertown Historic District.

In addition to its transit uses, Union Depot also contains a Hertz rental car location, coffee shop, restaurant, a bike shop, offices, a museum, and loft condominiums.

== History ==
=== Original Union Depot ===
There have been two Union Depots in Saint Paul. The first was completed in 1881, and combined the services of several different railroads into one building (hence the &quot;union&quot;; see Union station). In 1888 the old station had its peak year, handling eight million passengers. That year, about 150 trains departed daily. Around this time, the building was remodeled with a taller central tower and other alterations to the roofline. This station burned in 1915.

=== Current building ===
The current structure was started in 1917 but was not completed until 1923 because World War I forced construction to halt for several years.

During its heyday, the depot hosted the passenger trains of nine railroads, and more than 20 million pieces of mail passed through the station to the neighboring St. Paul Central Downtown Post Office annually. At its peak in the 1920s, there were 282 train movements daily. The waiting room stood atop nine platforms serving 18 tracks; the eight northern ones closest to the headhouse were stub-end tracks, while the other ten ran through. However, track ownership and trackage rights west of the station meant that most trains operated as though the station was a stub terminal. These trains, when they were intended to continue beyond the station, instead backed up to a wye just to the east to get to other main lines.

The Saint Paul Union Depot Company controlled of St. Paul trackage and terminal facilities, including the depot building. The company was operated in tandem with the Minnesota Transfer Railway Company, with effective control of both properties exercised by the same board, composed of representatives of the nine tenants.

Train ridership began to erode in the 1920s as the automobile took hold and airlines began to operate. The railroads sought ways to stem the flow of passengers and compete with these new forms of transportation. As the Great Depression unfolded, more aggressive moves were required. The streamliner era in the United States began in 1934 with the introduction of the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy&#x27;s &quot;Zephyr&quot;. After making a &quot;Dawn-to-Dusk Dash&quot; from Chicago to Denver, Colorado, the CB&amp;Q&#x27;s interest soon turned to the Twin Cities run. A demonstration run was completed in 6 hours and 4 minutes, including six one-minute stops. Other railroads were soon busy investigating how to run faster trains to Saint Paul and Minneapolis.

The first locomotive to run in Minnesota, the &quot;William Crooks&quot;, was displayed at the depot from 1955 until the station&#x27;s 1971 closure, after which it was moved to the Lake Superior Railroad Museum in Duluth.

=== Early high-speed trains ===
On January 2, 1935, high-speed express service to Chicago was introduced on the Chicago and North Western Railway&#x27;s &quot;400&quot;, cutting the scheduled time between the two cities from about 10 hours down to 7. &quot;Time&quot; dubbed the &quot;400&quot;, &quot;the fastest train scheduled on the American Continent, fastest in all the world on a stretch over 200 mi.&quot; The C&amp;NW beat two other railroads which had been planning 6½ hour service to begin in the spring. The Milwaukee Road&#x27;s &quot;Hiawatha&quot; and the Burlington Route&#x27;s &quot;Twin Cities Zephyr&quot; were introduced with 6½ hour service a few months later at the same time, and C&amp;NW matched their schedules.

The Burlington &quot;Zephyrs&quot; were the first streamlined diesel-electric trains to serve the Twin Cities, and originally ran in an articulated configuration. The &quot;400&quot; (now renamed the &quot;Twin Cities 400&quot;) followed in 1939, but using more conventional trucks and couplers to link passenger cars together. The &quot;Hiawatha&quot; had always been powered by a streamlined (or, in the terminology of the Milwaukee Road, &quot;speedlined&quot;) steam locomotive. The &quot;Twin Cities Zephyrs&quot; added a second set of trains daily in 1936, running the &quot;Morning Zephyr&quot; and &quot;Afternoon Zephyr&quot; from each terminal. The &quot;Hiawatha&quot; added a second set of trains in 1939, and the &quot;Morning Hiawatha&quot; and &quot;Afternoon Hiawatha&quot; each provided daily service from Minneapolis-St. Paul and Chicago.

The &quot;Morning Hiawatha&quot; may have held the record as the world&#x27;s fastest steam train on two or more measures: The run from Sparta to Portage, Wisconsin was scheduled for 58 minutes—an average of . Speeds up to and above were achieved on a daily basis, and the powerful Milwaukee Road class F7 engines (designed for a &quot;reserve speed&quot; of ) likely ran more miles at or above than any other steam locomotives in history.

Burlington&#x27;s diesel &quot;Zephyrs&quot; were also very fast, and they had to be—the &quot;Zephyr&quot; route was about longer than the competition. In southwestern Wisconsin, a stretch of track between stations required an average speed of .

Eventually, the &quot;Hiawathas&quot;, &quot;Zephyrs&quot;, and the &quot;400&quot; ran 6¼-hour service between St. Paul and Chicago, and for a time the &quot;Morning Zephyr&quot; from Chicago reached St. Paul in six hours flat. In the 1950s, the federal government began imposing stricter rules for high-speed operation, and expensive advanced signaling was installed along the routes to the Twin Cities, though trains generally traveled a maximum of . Unable to keep up with an increasing automobile speeds on an improving road network and other factors that kept passengers away from trains, train ridership declined and the five daily fast trains became unprofitable.

==== Other notable trains to serve the depot ====
*&quot;Twin Star Rocket&quot; (Rock Island Railroad: Minneapolis/St. Paul – Houston)
*&quot;Gopher&quot; and &quot;Badger&quot; (Great Northern Railway: Minneapolis/St. Paul – Duluth/Superior)
*&quot;North Coast Limited&quot; (Northern Pacific Railway and Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy: Chicago – Seattle)
*&quot;Western Star&quot; (Great Northern Railway: Chicago – Seattle and Portland)

=== End of service ===
The &quot;Twin Cities 400&quot; was the first victim, ending service on July 23, 1963.

It was announced that when Amtrak formally took over most passenger service on May 1, 1971, it would consolidate its Twin Cities service in Minneapolis at the Minneapolis Great Northern Depot. Accordingly, the Burlington (later Burlington Northern) &quot;Zephyrs&quot; ended service on April 30, 1971, the same day the depot closed. The &quot;Afternoon Zephyr&quot; was the last train to serve the depot when it departed that evening bound for Minneapolis. At this time, this train was normally combined with the &quot;Empire Builder&quot; and &quot;North Coast Limited&quot; from Chicago to St. Paul, except on Fridays when it ran as a separate train. Since April 30 was a Friday, the &quot;Zephyr&quot; had the &quot;honor&quot; of being the last train to depart the station.

=== Restoration and return of passenger service ===

Area boosters had long hoped that trains would return to the Union Depot, and plans gathered steam as the Blue Line light rail project in Minneapolis drew toward completion. Planners envisioned the depot being used for a restored Amtrak service along with Metro and Jefferson Lines buses.

A few businesses had occupied the headhouse since the halt of train service in 1971, while the United States Postal Service (USPS) took over the rear of the building. The concourse and waiting room were used for some postal service activities and storage. After lying dormant for several years in the 1970s, the train tracks were removed from the train deck and it was paved with a flat surface. It began to be used for staging semi-trailer trucks carrying mail to and from the neighboring Downtown St. Paul Central Post Office as well as USPS employee parking. A driveway ramp was sliced into the train deck at the intersection of Kellogg Boulevard and Broadway Street for USPS vehicles. In the early 2000s, the upper levels of the headhouse were converted into 33 2-story loft condominiums.
In 2005, the Ramsey County Regional Railroad Authority secured funding to renovate the station as an intermodal transit hub served by Amtrak trains, Metro Transit light rail, and intercity bus lines.

In June 2009, the Ramsey County Board approved purchasing the depot headhouse for $8.2 million, to serve as a METRO Green Line light rail station and for future passenger rail use. In 2010, USPS moved most of the truck operations to a bulk mail processing center in Eagan, Minnesota, making way for rehabilitation of the depot as a rail hub. Demolition of the Postal Service building that blocked track access to the station began in mid-March 2011. The USPS ramp cut all the way across the train deck and blocked the ability for tracks to be installed, so the ramp was modified during restoration to make a roughly right-angle turn to access new bus platforms on the north end of the train deck while freeing up room for a few tracks to be restored on the south end.

The renovation was completed in late November 2012 at a cost of $243 million, of which $35 million was provided by the US government through the TIGER program. The renovated station re-opened to the public on December 8, 2012.

The first Amtrak train to service Saint Paul Union Depot was the westbound &quot;Empire Builder&quot; on May 7, 2014, with its eastbound counterpart stopping the next day. service began on May 21, 2024, with St. Paul as its western terminus.

== Special events ==
Since opening in late 2012, the Depot has hosted a number of events including yoga classes, weddings, seasonal farmers markets, art galas, and holiday tree lighting ceremonies among other various public and private events.

In December 2014, for the first time in nearly 50 years, an active steam locomotive returned to St. Paul Union Depot. Milwaukee Road 261 and some historic passenger cars, decorated as the &quot;North Pole Express&quot; ran short excursions to and from the depot. It was determined to be an overwhelming success and has continued every year since (as of 2022). In 2014 and 2015 Canadian Pacific&#x27;s traveling Holiday Train made a stop at the depot.

On December 9, 2017, Metro Transit and BNSF operated a &quot;free to ride&quot; Northstar Holiday Train between Big Lake and St. Paul Union Depot. The event continued in 2018 and 2019, before discontinuing in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

In 2019, as part of Union Pacific&#x27;s &quot;Great Race Across the Midwest&quot; tour, Union Pacific 4014, made multiple stops at Union Depot for display before touring around other midwest states including Iowa, Minnesota, and Wisconsin.

=== Union Depot Train Days ===

Every year since 2014, the depot hosts a weekend of events named &quot;Train Days&quot; which showcases the history and future of railroad travel, 2014 and 2015 were advertised under Amtrak&#x27;s &quot;Nation Train Day&quot; event. After &quot;National Train Day&quot; was discontinued in 2015, Union Depot rebranded the event as &quot;Union Depot Train Days&quot; beginning in 2016. Those in attendance are treated to model train layouts, indoor and outdoor exhibits, memorabilia vendors, photography events, and railroad equipment displays, some of which are open to public touring on the platform. &quot;Train Days&quot; typically sees participation from area railroads and preservation organizations, including Amtrak, BNSF Railway, Canadian Pacific Kansas City, Union Pacific, Operation Lifesaver, Lake Superior Railroad Museum, Railroading Heritage of Midwest America (and subsidiary Friends of the 261), Minnesota Transportation Museum, Great Northern Railway Historical Society, Twin Cities and Western Railroad, and others.

In 2014 and 2015, Union Depot hosted National Train Day events with various indoor displays and platform displays from the Minnesota Transportation Museum, Amtrak, BNSF and Friends of the 261.

In 2016 the depot hosted its first &quot;Union Depot Train Days&quot; to celebrate the building&#x27;s 90th Anniversary. Various displays, vendors, and photographers were featured inside the depot. Outside featured numerous rail equipment, featuring Milwaukee Road 261, Amtrak&#x27;s Exhibit Train, and Soo Line FP7a #2500, among others.
On May 6, 2017, featured railroad equipment included Amtrak&#x27;s veteran&#x27;s locomotive, two Union Pacific locomotives, a TC&amp;W locomotive, and Northern Pacific RPO #1102. NP RPO #1102 had the distinction of being the &quot;Last Mail Train&quot; as Train Day attendees had mail transported inside the car from Union Depot to Osceola, Wisconsin.

On May 5, 2018, Minnesota Transportation Museum equipment along with Union Pacific&#x27;s Chicago &amp; Northwestern &#x27;heritage&#x27; locomotive were on display. Train Days 2019 featured Soo Line 700 from LSRM and Wisconsin &amp; Southern E9-A 101 from the Friends of the 261.

In 2020, &quot;Train Days&quot; was held virtually due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, but returned in person for 2021. Because &quot;Train Days&quot; was held on the anniversary of &quot;D-Day&quot; in 2021, Union Pacific &amp; Canadian Pacific displayed special military commemorative locomotives alongside Milwaukee Road E9 32A &amp; Amtrak 161, specially painted for Amtrak&#x27;s 50th anniversary.

Train Days returned in 2022, featuring two restored SD45s from Duluth, GN 400 and NP 3617, MILW 32A along with multiple Friends of the 261 passenger cars, Canadian Pacific and Union Pacific heritage locomotives, an Amtrak ALC-42, a TC&amp;W locomotive and some BNSF freight cars. In 2023, two CPKC locomotives, Milwaukee Road 261 and 32A, TC&amp;W 2020, and GN 192 from Duluth were displayed. Train Days is planned to return in June 2024.

== Services ==
=== Amtrak ===

The station is serviced by two Amtrak trains. The &quot;Empire Builder&quot; is named to honor Saint Paul-based mogul James J. Hill who constructed the Great Northern Railroad and whose nickname was &quot;The Empire Builder&quot;, and provides service west to Seattle, Washington and Portland, Oregon and southeast to Chicago. St. Paul is also the western terminus of the &quot;Borealis&quot;, an extended &quot;Hiawatha&quot; train that supplements the &quot;Empire Builder&quot; between Chicago and St. Paul.
The &quot;Empire Builder&quot; originally stopped at the station from 1929 until 1971. In 1971, Amtrak consolidated all passenger rail service for the Twin Cities at the Great Northern Station in Minneapolis, and in 1978 moved to the Midway Station in Saint Paul, about halfway between the downtowns of the two cities. Service returned to the Union Depot from Midway in 2014 after it was delayed for almost two years from the depot&#x27;s initial grand re-opening in 2012 due to negotiations with the owners of the railroads (Canadian Pacific Railway, BNSF Railway, and Union Pacific Railroad) in the area and the construction of new complex signals on the Merriam Park Subdivision.

The westbound &quot;Empire Builder&quot; arrives from Chicago in the middle of the night, usually around 10:30 p.m. The eastbound &quot;Empire Builder&quot; arrives around breakfast time. The westbound &quot;Borealis&quot; arrives from Chicago around 6:29 p.m, and departs on its return journey to Chicago at 11:50 a.m. Also included is an Amtrak Thruway to Duluth via Jefferson Lines. The station appears as St. Paul-Minneapolis in Amtrak timetables.

=== Light rail ===

The depot serves as the Metro Green Line light rail line&#x27;s eastern terminus. The Green Line runs between St. Paul and Minneapolis with its western terminus at Target Field station in the North Loop area of Downtown Minneapolis. The stop is in front of the headhouse, rather than at a platform under the waiting room.

The line opened on June 14, 2014. Utility relocation work in preparation for the Green Line began in front of the depot on 4th Street in August 2009, well before the line received final funding or approval. Track was laid from 2011 to 2012. While the Union Depot is the eastern terminus of service, the tracks continue beyond the station to the line&#x27;s maintenance facility.

=== Intercity bus service ===
*Greyhound Lines arrived at Saint Paul Union Depot in March 2014 after initially pulling out of the project two years prior. Greyhound offers at least six coach bus departures a day and additional weekend service.
*Jefferson Lines relocated from Midway Station to Saint Paul Union Depot in 2013.
*Megabus

=== Local and regional bus service ===
*Metro Transit: 3, 16, 21, 54, 63, 70, 94, 262, 350, 351, 361, 364 and 417.
*Minnesota Valley Transit Authority: 480, 484, 489.

== Planned services ==
The current vision for the depot is to create a hub for intercity connections for local and regional bus service, light rail, and commuter rail.

=== Light rail and bus rapid transit ===
Bus rapid transit (BRT) has been selected for the Rush Line Corridor between St. Paul and White Bear Lake. The southern terminus of this route is planned to be at St. Paul Union Depot. The Gateway Corridor (now called the Gold Line) is also planned to be bus rapid transit and will operate between St. Paul and Woodbury. The Red Rock Corridor has also been proposed as a BRT service and eventually being upgraded to commuter rail, however plans are on hold as ridership on the current bus routes in this corridor are low.

The Riverview Corridor is planned to be a LRT/modern streetcar hybrid operating between St. Paul Union Depot and Mall of America. Riverview Corridor trains would share tracks and stations with the Metro Green Line between Central Station and Union Depot Station.

=== Regional rail ===
Numerous existing freight rail lines branch out from St. Paul Union Depot and could be upgraded and utilized by regional passenger trains. Currently MnDOT has studied regional rail from St. Paul Union Depot to Mankato, Northfield, and Minneapolis (continuing further west as a through-service). In 2010, the Minnesota Department of Transportation also released a plan for regional rail stretching out from the Twin Cities to rural Minnesota and neighboring states, and at least some of the lines would run to Saint Paul.

=== Intercity rail ===
For decades, the only intercity train to serve the Twin Cities was the overnight &quot;Empire Builder&quot;. However, beginning on May 21, 2024, Amtrak extended a &quot;Hiawatha&quot; train from Milwaukee to St. Paul as the &quot;Borealis&quot;, providing additional daily service between Union Depot and Chicago. The &quot;Borealis&quot; is the successor to the &quot;North Star&quot; and the &quot;Twin Cities Hiawatha&quot;. A further extension to Minneapolis Target Field Station and St. Cloud has been proposed.

==== High-speed rail ====
New trains running at speeds above to Chicago have also been discussed since at least 1991. The Midwest Regional Rail Initiative (MWRRI), led by the Wisconsin Department of Transportation, has proposed a link to the Twin Cities running at up to . The planned schedule time to Saint Paul would be just 5½ hours. Others including the French national railway SNCF, which operates the TGV network, have proposed trains running at up to .

== Local significance ==

Prior to the station&#x27;s reopening in December 2012, Josh Collins, a spokesman for Ramsey County Regional Rail Authority, referred to the potential of the station to be &quot;the living room of Saint Paul.&quot;

=== Architecture ===
The entrance to Union Depot, the headhouse, is considered a somewhat severe example of neoclassical architecture, with a robust aesthetic. A series of tall Doric columns line the front façade. The concourse and the waiting room that extends out to the platforms, where trains once rolled in, is considered to be one of the great architectural achievements in the city. Charles Frost designed the station.

The waiting room is flooded with natural light from skylights. These skylights were blackened during the Second World War, but restored for the 2012 re-opening.

The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1974.

The restoration and new addition were designed by Hammel, Green and Abrahamson Architects &amp; Engineers (HGA).

=== Railway mapping ===
Milepost for rail lines that originated in St. Paul, such as the Great Northern and Northern Pacific, had used the depot as milepost 0. This is still evident in timetables and mileposts used by the BNSF Railway.

<doc id="925103" wikidata="Q3396538" url="?curid=925103" title="Fremont Bridge (Portland, Oregon)">
<text>The Fremont Bridge is a steel tied-arch bridge over the Willamette River located in Portland, Oregon, United States. It carries Interstate 405 and US 30 traffic between downtown and North Portland where it intersects with Interstate 5. It has the longest main span of any bridge in Oregon and is the second longest tied-arch bridge in the world (after Caiyuanba Bridge across the Yangtze River, China). The bridge was designed by Parsons, Brinckerhoff, Quade and Douglas, and built by Murphy Pacific Corporation. In 2006, Sharon Wood Wortman published the third and latest version of The Portland Bridge Book. This book provides even more detail about the Fremont Bridge than covered here.

The bridge has two decks carrying vehicular traffic, each with four lanes. The upper deck is signed westbound on US 30 and southbound on I-405. The lower deck is signed eastbound on US 30 and northbound on I-405.

==Design and construction==
Due to the public&#x27;s dissatisfaction with the appearance of the Marquam Bridge, the Portland Art Commission was invited to participate in the design process of the Fremont. The improvement in visual quality resulted in a bridge that was nearly six times as expensive as the purposely economical Marquam Bridge. Designers modeled the bridge after the original 1964 Port Mann Bridge in Vancouver, British Columbia.

The steel tie-girder (I-beam) is tall and wide. On October 28, 1971, while still under construction, a crack was found on the west span of this girder that required a $5.5 million redesign and repair. The ramps and approaches are steel box girders. If the lanes of the bridge were placed end-to-end, there are on the arch bridge and on the ramps and approaches.

The center span of the bridge, where the rib of the arch is above the deck, is long. It was fabricated in California then assembled at Swan Island Industrial Park, downstream. After assembly it was floated on a barge the trip to the construction site. On March 16, 1973, the steel arch span was lifted using 32 hydraulic jacks. At the time, it was listed in the Guinness Book of World Records as the heaviest lift ever completed.

The bridge was opened on November 15, 1973, at a final cost of $82 million (equivalent to $ million in ), most of which was financed by the Federal Highway Administration. In 1976, an American flag and an Oregon flag were added atop the structure as part of the bicentennial celebration for the United States. The flags were installed with the use of a helicopter. The flags are attached to tall flagpoles at the crest of the arches.

==Falcon nest==
The Fremont Bridge was also the 26th Peregrine falcon nest site designated in Oregon in 1995 after the raptor was placed on the U.S. Threatened and Endangered Species list in 1970.

The raptor has since been removed from the list and is now listed as least concern.

==Etymology==
The bridge as well as Portland&#x27;s associated Fremont Street were named for John C. Fremont (1813–1890). Fremont was an early explorer of the Oregon Country. He served in the United States Army at the time as a Captain and was later promoted to General. In 1856, he ran for president, but was defeated by James Buchanan.

<doc id="925107" wikidata="Q4954868" url="?curid=925107" title="Bradley Amendment">
<text>In United States law, the Bradley Amendment () is an amendment intended to improve the effectiveness of child support enforcement. It is named after Senator Bill Bradley, who introduced it.

The Bradley Amendment requires state courts to prohibit retroactive reduction of child support obligations. Specifically, it automatically triggers a non-expiring lien whenever child support becomes past-due; overrides any state&#x27;s statute of limitations; disallows any judicial discretion, even from bankruptcy judges; and requires that the payment amounts be maintained without regard for the physical capability of the person owing child support (the &quot;obligor&quot;) to promptly document changed circumstances or regard for his awareness of the need to make the notification.

==History==

Authors Kathryn Edin and Timothy J. Nelson attribute the Bradley Amendment&#x27;s origin to a January 1986 CBS News special report, &quot;The Vanishing Family: Crisis in Black America&quot;, hosted by Bill Moyers. Edin and Nelson noted that &quot;The Vanishing Family&quot; &quot;went on to win every major award in journalism&quot; and inspired overwhelmingly sympathetic reactions from influential commentators, leading to the amendment&#x27;s proposal in May 1986.

The amendment text was included in the Sixth Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act, 1986, bill S.2706.

Subtitle C: Miscellaneous Provisions - Amends part D Child Support of title IV of the Act to prohibit the retroactive modification of child support arrearages except with respect to such arrearages which accumulate after the obligee and entity which is issued the child support order receive notice that the obligor has pending an active application for modification of such order.

Senator Bill Bradley, Democrat of New Jersey, introduced the amendment in an earlier bill on May 5, 1986. It passed in the Senate with amendments with an 88–7 vote on September 20, 1986. The related House resolution H.R. 5300 was signed into law on October 21, 1986.

==Criticism==

Legislators and scholars have called for reform of the Bradley Amendment.

From 2004, the Bradley Amendment was challenged as unconstitutional and was the subject of a repeal effort; in February 2006, the court case was dismissed.

In 2011, William S. Boyd School of Law professor Ann Cammett published a scholarly article which criticized the Bradley Amendment for compounding prisoners&#x27; debts and for preempting other approaches to child support.

Columnist Diane Dimond cited the Bradley Amendment as &quot;working against the wronged man,&quot; criticizing the amendment for prohibiting state judges from retroactively modifying orders for persons to pay child support even when a purported father later proves that he is not the parent.

In 2018, Lynne Haney, a sociology professor at New York University, wrote an opinion article in the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; calling for reform of the Bradley Amendment. Haney noted the significant number of child support debtors, particularly African American fathers, who have been imprisoned for failing to pay their child support obligations.

The manga was serialized in Shueisha&#x27;s manga magazine &quot;Weekly Shōnen Jump&quot; from June 1996 to November 2000, with its chapters collected in 23 volumes. The story involves Chinese mythology and history of China, in particular the last members of the Yin dynasty, and the plot to overthrow them. In North America, the manga was licensed for English release by Viz Media. Fujisaki also wrote a short manga, titled &quot;Hoshin Engi Gaiden: Senkai Dōsho&quot;, serialized in &quot;Weekly Young Jump&quot; from April to June 2018. 

A 26-episode anime television series, released in English under the title Soul Hunter, was broadcast on TV Tokyo from July to December 1999. A second 23-episode anime television series adaptation, titled &quot;Hakyu Hoshin Engi&quot;, was broadcast from January to June 2018. The first anime series was first licensed in North America by ADV Films in 2001; it was later acquired by Discotek Media in 2016.

The &quot;Hoshin Engi&quot; manga has had over 22 million copies in circulation.

==Synopsis==
===Setting===
Set in a fictional ancient China, during the Yin dynasty, the fantastic world of &quot;Hoshin Engi&quot; encompass both the pre-historical world—in which primitive human society coexist with the revered divine gods and goddesses—and the futuristic world—in which highly technological weaponry, combat strategy, as well as futuristic visions, are employed. The are a group of powerful immortals or hermits with extraordinary abilities and knowledge, who have gained immortality through various means. They possess great wisdom, longevity, and often exhibit exceptional magical or supernatural powers. Each Sennin has their unique skills and abilities, which they use to navigate the world and influence events. The humans who undergo training to become Sennin are known as . Both Sennin and Doshi use the sacred weapons , versatile instruments that absorb the spiritual energy of their beholders and from their surroundings to amplify their power.

===Plot===

A female fox spirit, named Dakki, is controlling King Chu and the Yin dynasty, using her power over him to do evil in the nation. A Doshi named Taikobo was given a mission by Genshi Tenson, Taikobo&#x27;s mentor and the leader of the , to complete the , whose mission is to trap Dakki and her minions in a &quot;middle&quot; world between the Sennin World and the Human World, called . Taikobo&#x27;s mission is to hunt down the 365 people whose names were written on the Hoshin List. As Taikobo defeats and seals off each of the 365 people on the scroll, their souls are instantly transported to the —a floating island made to trap souls—and sealed there until all the 365 souls are gathered. Alongside his trusty Supushan, Taikobo encounters numerous allies and enemies, each with their own motivations and powers. They engage in battles and form alliances, unraveling the complex web of politics and power struggles among the immortals. 

Along the way, Taikobo uncovers Dakki&#x27;s influence over the Human World, as she manipulates King Chu and orchestrates chaos and suffering. As the story progresses, Taikobo learns more about the true nature of the Sennin and their connection to the heavens. He discovers the existence of a celestial battle between gods and immortals, and the consequences it has for the Human World. Taikobo becomes embroiled in this conflict, as he finds himself torn between his duty as an immortal and his compassion for humanity. At the climax of the Sennin war, both worlds were completely destroyed with hundreds of souls sealed into the Hoshindai. After defeating King Chu, and officially declaring the fall of the Yin dynasty, Taikobo and company decide to leave the Human World and return to what is left of the Sennin World. However, Taikobo learns that there is possibly a third Sennin World, one that belongs to Dakki, and is probably where she and the last of her minions fled to when the Yin dynasty was finally conquered.

It is later revealed that the real goal of the Hoshin Project is not just about defeating Dakki, but the eternal being behind her and the corruption of the Human World, the powerful Joka, one of the ; aliens who landed on the Earth millions of years ago. Joka had a dream to recreate her home world on Earth (which had self-destructed some time ago), but the other aliens disagreed and enclosed her in a glass cage. Later, she was able to move about in her &quot;soul&quot; form and direct the trend of history to her liking. This is when she met up with Dakki, and the two started working together to make Joka&#x27;s dream of recreating her home world on Earth come true. Each time history diverted from what Joka wants it to become, she completely destroyed the civilization that existed and started all over again. The Sennin retaliate against Joka, and she finally decides to destroy Earth once and for all, and find another world in order to replicate her old home. The battles rages for a while before the deceased Taikobo (who had &quot;died&quot; recently) reappears in front of his comrades again. It is revealed that Taikobo was once one of the First Persons. Using the energy of his friends as well as those souls trapped in the Hoshindai, Taikobo (now renamed Fukki), is finally able to defeat Joka and release the world from her influences.

Prior to this, Dakki manages to take over Joka&#x27;s body for a time and merges with the life energies of the Earth, becoming the mother of all life. After the fight with Joka ends, Joka selfishly asks Taikobo to disappear together with her, afraid of being left alone again. Taikobo complies, feeling that he had done what he had set out to do. However, when Taikobo was about to fade away, Dakki emerges to protect him and prevents his vanishing.

In the epilogue, when Supushan goes to the Human World to report on the events of the Sennin World, he finds out that Taikobo is still alive and start looking for him to no avail, as Taikobo seems keen on avoiding his friends, to the extent of following them behind their backs without them knowing, and somehow preventing the people he meets from revealing his whereabouts. After lazing around for a while, Taikobo decides to start a new journey to unknown places.

<doc id="925119" wikidata="Q1618709" url="?curid=925119" title="Felipe López (basketball)">
<text>Luis Felipe López (born December 19, 1974) is a Dominican former professional basketball player. He starred as a high school player and for the St. John&#x27;s Red Storm in college basketball. López played for four seasons in the National Basketball Association (NBA). He has played for teams in a half dozen countries, as well as in the Continental Basketball Association (CBA) in the U.S. Most recently, he has been a broadcaster with Spanish-language networks. His life story was the subject of an ESPN 30 for 30 documentary entitled &quot;The Dominican Dream&quot;.

==Early life==
López&#x27;s father, who played amateur baseball in the Dominican Republic, and his family immigrated to the U.S. when he was 14. López played high school basketball at Rice High School in New York City, where he followed New York high school player Dean Meminger in becoming one of the most highly touted recruits in U.S. high school history. The guard made many All-American lists in 1994, earning Player of the Year honors from Gatorade, &quot;USA Today&quot;, &quot;Parade&quot;, and many others.

==College career==
López appeared on the cover of &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; before he had played his first college game. He also appeared with Jim Brown and Jackie Joyner-Kersee at a televised town meeting on race and sports along with then-president Bill Clinton. López was the only Latino onstage during the discussion.

López and Allen Iverson were the two most lauded recruits coming out of prep that year, and both went on to play in the Big East.

López finished his freshman season for the St. John&#x27;s Red Storm with a 17.8-point-per-game scoring average. He earned a spot on the All-Big East Rookie Team and All-Big East Third Team. His numbers dipped slightly the next two years, bottoming out at 15.9 ppg as a junior. As a senior he averaged 17.6 ppg and garnered All-Big East First Team honors. He finished his career with 1,927 points, placing him fourth all-time in St. John&#x27;s history behind former players Chris Mullin, Malik Sealy, and D&#x27;Angelo Harrison and sixth in Big East history with 1,222 conference points, while also ranking seventh all time in steals, 14th in assists, and 20th in rebounds. He once held the St. John&#x27;s record for most three-pointers made in a single season (60) and in a career (148), but was surpassed by D&#x27;Angelo Harrison.

==Professional career==
López was selected by the San Antonio Spurs with the 24th pick in the 1998 NBA draft and was immediately traded, along with Carl Herrera, to the Vancouver Grizzlies for point guard Antonio Daniels. López&#x27;s drafting into the NBA was cause for great celebration in the heavily Dominican community of Washington Heights in New York City. He played 112 games for the Grizzlies before being traded to the Washington Wizards along with Dennis Scott, Cherokee Parks, and Obinna Ekezie in exchange for free agent Isaac Austin on August 22, 2000. López went on to sign as a free agent with both the Minnesota Timberwolves and Dallas Mavericks, although he never played a regular season game for the Mavs. He trained with the Orlando Magic and Los Angeles Clippers in the first months of the 2005–06 NBA season before signing a contract with Lleida.

López holds career NBA averages of 5.8 points, 2.4 rebounds and one assist per game.

<text>Dragon Street Records is an independent record label, based out of Dallas, Texas. Founded in 1989 by David Dennard and Patrick Keel, longtime local musicians with over 25 combined years of music experience, Dragon Street&#x27;s original goal was to develop regional rock bands into nationally viable recording artists, and, in general, promoting the Texas music scene. The first major bands to be released through Dragon Street were The Bat Mastersons, Hagfish, The Nixons, and Tripping Daisy.

By 1995, major labels had come to dominate the alternative rock scene, and Dennard began refocusing the label on alternative country and rockabilly music, giving starts to artists including Ronnie Dawson, Killbilly, the Dixie Chicks, and Gene Summers.

In addition to the continuing development of local acts, Dragon Street is issuing a series of recordings centering on 1960s and 1970s Dallas bands.

<doc id="925157" wikidata="Q7443836" url="?curid=925157" title="Secondary education in New Zealand">
<text>[[Secondary education]] in New Zealand takes up to five years, covering the ages 13 to 18, corresponding to the school years 9 to 13.

== History ==

In 1940, there were 156 schools in New Zealand offering secondary education: 39 secondary schools, 96 district high schools, and 21 technical high schools.

In 1944, the school leaving age was raised from 14 to 15. At the same time, a gradual move started away from separate secondary schools and technical high schools toward comprehensive secondary schools serving both, and district high schools started falling out of favour to separate secondary schools. Combined with the post-World War II baby boom, the number of secondary students swelled and a large number of new secondary schools had to be built. To save construction time and costs, most secondary schools built in the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s were built to standard plans.

By 1960, the number of secondary students had tripled from 39,000 to 140,000, and the number of secondary schools had increased to 239, comprising 102 secondary schools, 96 district high schools, and 41 technical high schools. By 1980, there were 265 secondary schools and 35 district high schools, with technical high schools having been completely phased out.

In 1989, the school leaving age was raised to the present age of 16. Also in 1989, the &quot;Tomorrow&#x27;s Schools&quot; reform was implemented, moving the governance of secondary schools from district education boards to individual school communities through elected boards of trustees.

== Types of school ==

There are three types of school: state, private (or registered or independent) and state integrated schools. State and state integrated schools are government funded. Private schools receive about 25% of their funding from the government, and rely on tuition fees for the rest. State integrated schools are former private schools which are now &quot;integrated&quot; into the state system under the Private Schools Conditional Integration Act 1975 &quot;on a basis which will preserve and safeguard the special character of the education provided by them&quot;. According to Ministry of Education statistics, of the 284,052 secondary students (Years 9–15) enrolled in New Zealand schools at 1 July 2012, 81.6 percent (231,817) attend state schools, 12.6 percent (35,924) attend state integrated schools, and 5.7 percent (16,230) attend private schools.

Many private schools, state area schools and state integrated schools take students from Years 0 to 13, or Years 7 to 13.

== State school enrollment schemes ==
For state schools, the Education Amendment Act 2000 puts in place a new &quot;system for determining enrollment of students in circumstances where a school has reached its roll capacity and needs to avoid overcrowding.&quot; Schools which operate enrolment schemes have a geographically defined &quot;home zone&quot;. Residence in this zone, or in the school&#x27;s boarding house, if it has one, gives right of entry to the School. Students who live outside the school&#x27;s home zone can be admitted, if there are places available, in the following order of priority: special programmes; siblings of currently enrolled students; siblings of past students; children of board employees; all other students. If there are more applications than available places then selection must be through a ballot, which is randomly selected.

Critics have suggested that the system is fundamentally unfair as it restricts the choice for parents to choose schools and schools to choose their students. In addition, there is evidence that property values surrounding some more desirable schools become inflated, thus restricting the ability of lowers socio-economic groups to purchase a house in the zone.

== School qualifications ==
The Government-run student qualification system is the National Certificate of Educational Achievement (&quot;NCEA&quot;). At some schools students can opt for IGCSE/A-levels (popularly known as &quot;Cambridge exams&quot;) or the International Baccalaureate Diploma.

NCEA has three levels, one for each of the last three years of secondary school. It contains a mix of internal and external assessments. NCEA replaced the old School Certificate, Sixth Form Certificate and Bursary systems.

The IGCSE and A-level exams of the Cambridge International Examinations Board are offered at some schools. For these qualifications, IGCSE is sat in year 11, AS-level in year 12 and A-level in year 13. Neither of these independent qualifications are registered on the NZQA National Qualifications Framework.

University Entrance, based on NCEA results, allows entrance to New Zealand universities. New Zealand Scholarship is a qualification pitched at students within the top stanine level.

== Fees and donations ==

Strictly speaking, no fees need to be paid for education at a state school provided the student is a New Zealand citizen or permanent resident, or an Australian citizen. However, most schools also ask for a &quot;voluntary donation&quot; from parents, informally known as &quot;school fees&quot; or a &quot;parental contribution&quot;.

== Trades unions ==
The Post Primary Teachers&#x27; Association (PPTA) is the largest trade union in secondary education in New Zealand with 18,000 teaching staff employed in state and state integrated secondary schools being members.

Independent Schools Education Association (ISEA) is the union for teaching and non-teaching staff in New Zealand independent (private) schools.

<text>Cathays railway station is a station on the Merthyr and Rhondda lines in the Cathays district of Cardiff, Wales. It is north of .

The station is next to Cardiff University Students&#x27; Union and across the road from many Cardiff University buildings, as well as a short walk from the Welsh Government and other civic buildings in Cathays Park. The footbridge over the railway is much used as a shortcut between Park Place and Senghenydd Road. When Cathays opened in 1983 it reversed a trend to close stations. Funded by British Rail and South Glamorgan County Council, construction commenced in April 1983, with the station opened on 3 October 1983.

Cathays station is now staffed during peak hours, since the introduction of a new automated ticket barrier system in summer 2007. Cathays has two platforms, each with a small shelter and an information screen displaying the next train&#x27;s arrival.

The station is the seventh-most used railway station in Wales but is inaccessible to wheelchair users who wish to cross between platforms as there are no bridges or lifts. Transport for Wales has future plans to install an accessible bridge as part of the South Wales Metro project.

==Services==
In the daytime from Monday to Saturday, there are usually six trains an hour from Cardiff Central to , two of which terminate there, two of which continue to and two of which continue to . Four eastbound trains per hour continue beyond Cardiff Queen Street to Cardiff Central and two currently continue to Cardiff Bay.

There are bus services from outside the station, including Megabus and National Express.

<text>Kate Richardson (born June 27, 1984) is a former artistic gymnast who represented Canada at the 2000 and 2004 Summer Olympics. From 2002 to 2006, she also competed for the UCLA Bruins.

==Elite gymnastics career==

Richardson began gymnastics at the age of three and was a member of Canada&#x27;s national team from 1996 to 2004. She was the national novice champion in 1996, junior national champion in 1998, and senior national champion in 2001.

At the 1999 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships in Tianjin, Richardson finished 19th in the all-around. The following year, she competed at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, where she placed 15th in the all-around. She placed 16th at the 2001 World Championships in Ghent, Belgium.

At the 2002 Commonwealth Games in Manchester, Richardson won gold medals in the all-around and on balance beam, as well as a bronze medal with the Canadian team. At the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, she finished 18th in the all-around and 7th in the floor exercise final. She was the first Canadian woman ever to qualify for an Olympic final in women&#x27;s gymnastics, and the first woman of any nationality since Kelly Garrison-Steves in 1988 to make the Olympics while competing in the NCAA. (Her Bruin teammate Mohini Bhardwaj also competed in the 2004 Olympics, but after her NCAA career was over.)

<text>* List of Provinces of Japan &gt; Tōsandō &gt; Rikuchū Province &gt; Iwate District
* Japan &gt; Tōhoku region &gt; Iwate Prefecture &gt; Iwate District

 is a rural district located in Iwate Prefecture, Japan.

As of June 1, 2019, the district has an estimated population of 34,416 with a density of 24.5 per km2 and an area of 1404.24 km2. The entire city of Takizawa, the southern half of the city of Hachimantai and most of the city of Morioka were formerly part of Iwate District.

==Towns and villages==
The district consists of three towns:
*Iwate
*Kuzumaki
*Shizukuishi

==History==
===Under Mutsu Province===

Iwate District was the northernmost of the six districts of northern Mutsu Province (六奥郡) created in the early Heian period after the conquest of the Kitakami River Valley from the Emishi tribes by the Japanese army led by General Sakanoue no Tamuramaro. The districts were named by Emperor Heizei, and the name of “Iwate” was originally written with the &quot;kanji&quot; 磐手, and appears in this form in the &quot;Yamato Monogatari&quot;, compiled in the year 951. By the middle Heian period, the &quot;kanji&quot; had changed to its present form, although it was also occasionally referred to as ‘&quot;Iwadenomori&quot;&#x27; (岩出の森郡)

Iwate District was the northern frontier of Japan until the Enkyu-Emishi War of 1070, which extended the frontier to the northern coast of Honshu. As with the rest of the region, the early history of Iwate District is uncertain. Although Shiwa Castle was constructed in 803 as a major army base in the region, it fell into ruins only ten years later. The area came to be ruled by the Abe clan until the Former Nine Years War (1051-1063), followed by the Kiyohara clan until the Gosannen War (1083-1089) and the Northern Fujiwara until 1189. During the Muromachi period, the area gradually came under the control of the Nanbu clan from Nukanobu District to the north.

Under the Tokugawa shogunate, Iwate county consisted of one town (Morioka) and 85 villages under the control of Morioka Domain.

===Early Meiji period===
Following the Meiji restoration, Iwate District came under Rikuchū Province and became part of Morioka Prefecture in 1871. Morioka Prefecture became Iwate Prefecture in 1872. In January 1879, Iwate District was divided into Kita-Iwate District with 47 villages, and Minimi-Iwate District with 38 villages.


===Subsequent timeline===
*April 1, 1897 – With the establishment of the municipality system, Kita-Iwate District and Minami-Iwate District were merged to become Iwate District, and was organized into one town (Morioka and 24 villages)
*December 23, 1940 - The village of Shizukuishi was elevated to town status. (2 towns, 21 villages)

==History==
The area of present-day Shiwa was part of ancient Mutsu Province, and has been settled since at least the Jōmon period. The area was inhabited by the Emishi people, and came under the control of the imperial dynasty during the early Heian period. During the Kamakura period, the area was ruled by a branch of the Northern Fujiwara, followed by the Shiba clan during the Muromachi period. During the Sengoku period, the area was conquered by the Nambu clan in 1588. During the Edo period, Shiwa prospered as a post station on the Ōshū Kaidō highway connecting Edo with the northern provinces, as well as from its location on the Kitakami River. Initially part of Morioka Domain under the Tokugawa shogunate, from 1684, four villages (Tsuchidate, Katayose, Inato and Kamihirazawa) formed an exclave of Hachinohe Domain.

During the Meiji period, this exclave became the village of Shiwa, and the town of Hizume and the villages of Furudate, Mizuwake, Akaishi, Hikobe, Sahinai, Akasawa, ane Nagaoka were established within Shiwa District on April 1, 1889 with the establishment of the modern municipalities system. These municipalities were merged on April 1, 1955 to form the new town of Shiwa.

==Government==
Shiwa has a mayor-council form of government with a directly elected mayor and a unicameral city legislature of 18 members. Shiwa, and the town of Yahaba collectively contribute two seats to the Iwate Prefectural legislature. In terms of national politics, the city is part of Iwate 1st district of the lower house of the Diet of Japan.

==Economy==
The local economy of Shiwa is traditionally based on agriculture, primarily rice cultivation, apples, grapes and cucumbers; however, due to its proximity to Morioka city, it is increasingly serving as a bedroom community.

==Education==
Shiwa has eleven public elementary schools and three public junior high schools operated by the town government and one public high school operated by the Iwate Prefectural Board of Education.

<text>* List of Provinces of Japan &gt; Tōsandō &gt; Rikuchū Province &gt; Shiwa District
* Japan &gt; Tōhoku region &gt; Iwate Prefecture &gt; Shiwa District

 is a rural district located in Iwate Prefecture, Japan.

As of June 1, 2019, the district has an estimated population of 59,822 and a density of 195 persons per km2. The total area was 306.30 km2.
The district consists of two towns:
*Shiwa
*Yahaba

==History==


===Under Mutsu Province===
Shiwa District was one of the six districts of northern Mutsu Province (六奥郡) created in the early Heian period after the conquest of the Kitakami River Valley from the Emishi tribes by the Japanese army led by General Sakanoue no Tamuramaro. The districts were named by Emperor Heizei. Shiwa District was part of the northern border of Japan until the Enkyu-Emishi War of 1070, which extended the frontier to the northern coast of Honshu. As with the rest of the region, the early history of Shiwa District is uncertain as are its borders, as Shiwa Castle is located in what is now Iwate District, indication that Shiwa District was originally much larger than its present area. The area came to be ruled by the Abe clan until the Former Nine Years War (1051-1063), followed by the Kiyohara clan until the Gosannen War (1083-1089) and the Northern Fujiwara until 1189. During the Muromachi period, the area was claimed by the Nanbu clan of northern Mutsu, but was ruled by the local Shiba clan until that clan was destroyed by the Nanbu in 1588.

Under the Tokugawa shogunate, Shiwa county consisted of 71 villages under the control of Morioka Domain and 4 villages under the control of Hachinohe Domain.

===Early Meiji period===
Following the Meiji restoration, Shiwa District came under Rikuchū Province and became part of Morioka Prefecture in 1871, with the exception of 4 villages which briefly became an exclave of Hachinohe Prefecture until absorbed into Morioka Prefecture as Shiwa Village a few months later. Morioka Prefecture became Iwate Prefecture in 1872.

<text>was a town located in Hienuki District, Iwate Prefecture, Japan.

==History==
The town of Ōhasama created on April 1, 1889, with the establishment of the municipalities system. On January 1, 1955, it annexed the neighboring villages of Kamegamori, Uchikawame and Sotokawame.

On January 1, 2006, Ōhasama, along with the town of Ishidoriya (from Hienuki District), and the town of Tōwa (from Waga District), was merged into the expanded city of Hanamaki (which lies to the south), and no longer exists as an independent municipality.

As of January 1, 2006, the town had an estimated population of 6,568 and a population density of 26.6 persons per km2. The total area was 246.84 km2.

==Geography==
Ōhasama is located roughly in the center of Iwate Prefecture; about 25 km south of the prefectural capital of Morioka.

Ōhasama is itself composed of four major areas: Ōhasama (大迫) proper, which lies in the center; Uchikawame (内川目), a valley to the north; Sotokawame (外川目), to the east; and to the west is the flatter farmland of Kamegamori (亀々森).

In the northeast section of Ōhasama is Mt. Hayachine (早池峰山) which, at an altitude of 1,917 m. (6,289 ft.), is the second highest mountain in Iwate Prefecture after Mt. Iwate in Morioka.

Ōhasama lies in the mountainous region of the Kitakami River area. This results in a sharp contrast between daytime and nighttime temperatures - most noticeably in the summer. It also receives little snow or rainfall compared to surrounding areas.

==Local Culture==
The climate of Ōhasama is well suited to the growing of grapes. The town is home to the regionally well-known Edel Wine. In September, the Ōhasama Wine House hosts the annual Wine Festival.

The shrine at Mount Hayachine is famous for a local variety of Kagura (神楽). Kagura dancers often appear at area festivals or functions. On a hill above the town of Ōhasama proper stands a statue resembling the wolf-like costumes donned by Hayachine Kagura dancers.

Mt. Hayachine is also home to a particular species of edelweiss, called &quot;Hayachine Usuyukisou&quot;, which grows exclusively on the mountain. It was because of this flower that mountain climbers from Ōhasama forged a friendship with those from Berndorf, Austria, resulting in the two becoming sister cities in 1965.

Around the time of Japan&#x27;s Girls&#x27; Festival, Ōhasama puts on displays of its collection of dolls: many of which are several hundred years old. Local history suggests that the dolls may have been given to residents of Ōhasama by travelers from Kyoto on their way to trade in Hokkaidō.

==Sister cities==
Ōhasama has been twinned with Berndorf, Lower Austria, since 1965. The student exchange programme between Berndorf grammar school and Ōhasama high school will be continued despite the incorporation.

As part of the city of Hanamaki, Ohasama is also twinned with Hot Springs, Arkansas. As of 2007, Ōhasama Junior High School has begun a sister school partnership with Jessieville Middle School in Arkansas, thanks to a friendship forged during a visit to Hanamaki by visitors from the Jessieville School.

<text>Ivy John Bryant Jr. (March 5, 1925 – September 22, 1980), known as Jimmy Bryant, was an American country music guitarist. He is best known for his collaborations with steel guitarist Speedy West and his session work.

==Biography==
Bryant was born in Moultrie, Georgia, the oldest of 12 children. During the Great Depression he played the fiddle on street corners to help support his family.

In 1943, Bryant would join the United States Army, serving in France and Germany. While fighting in Germany he was severely injured by a grenade, and would spend the rest of the war in a hospital, where he would meet Tony Mottola, who motivated him to begin playing the guitar. Once the war ended, Bryant would join the USO, where he would play until he was discharged.

After the war, he would drift around various states, including Georgia, Tennessee and Washington, D.C., where he played as &quot;Buddy&quot; Bryant. He then moved to Los Angeles county where he worked in Western films and played music in bars around L.A.&#x27;s Skid Row, where he met pioneering pedal steel guitarist Speedy West. West, who joined Cliffie Stone&#x27;s popular Hometown Jamboree local radio and TV show, suggested Bryant be hired when the show&#x27;s original guitarist departed. That gave Bryant access to Capitol Records since Stone was a Capitol artist and talent scout.

In 1950 Tex Williams heard Bryant&#x27;s style and used him on his recording of &quot;Wild Card&quot;. In addition, Bryant and West played on the Tennessee Ernie Ford-Kay Starr hit &quot;I&#x27;ll Never Be Free&quot;, leading to both men being signed to Capitol as instrumentalists. Bryant and West became a team, working extensively with each other.

Bryant was a difficult musician to work with. By 1955 he left Hometown Jamboree (retaining his friendship with West) and after various clashes with his Capitol producer Ken Nelson, the label dropped him in 1956. In 1957 Jimmy Bryant was a part of one of the first integrated television shows featuring popular radio and television star Jimmie Jackson who hosted the show along with black jazz violinist and recording star, Stuff Smith and black jazz percussionist and recording star, George Jenkins. He continued working in Los Angeles and in the early 1960s he and his trio made an appearance in the Coleman Francis film &quot;The Skydivers&quot;.

During the 1960s he shifted into music production. Waylon Jennings made a hit of his song &quot;Only Daddy That&#x27;ll Walk the Line&quot;. He can also be heard playing fiddle on the Monkees&#x27; &quot;Sweet Young Thing&quot;. In the early 1970s Bryant ran a recording studio in Las Vegas, but finally relocated to Georgia before settling in Nashville in 1975, the same year he reunited with Speedy West for a reunion album produced by Nashville steel guitarist Pete Drake. Bryant played in Nashville bars and did some recording work but his personality did not mesh well with Nashville&#x27;s highly political music and recording industry. In 1978, in declining health, Bryant learned that he had lung cancer; He played his final performance in August, 1979 at a club in North Hollywood before he returned to his Georgia hometown.

He died in Moultrie in September 1980 at the age of 55.

<doc id="925258" wikidata="Q6500128" url="?curid=925258" title="Lauren Bay-Regula">
<text>Lauren Bay-Regula (born August 9, 1981) is a Canadian softball pitcher. She played college softball at Oklahoma State from 2000 to 2003, where she holds several all-time school records. She was a part of the Canadian softball team who finished ninth at the 2002 World Championships in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, and fifth at the 2004 Athens Olympics. Bay-Regula pitched in 2005 for the Chicago Bandits of the National Pro Fastpitch and was named co-Pitcher of the Year; in 2006, Bay signed with the expansion Philadelphia Force. Bay-Regula represented Team Canada at the 2020 Summer Olympics and won a bronze medal.

==Early life==
Regula is originally from Trail, British Columbia, where she began playing softball at age 12.

==Oklahoma State Cowgirls==
As a freshman, she broke into the Oklahoma State Cowgirls top-10 season records in strikeouts, innings pitched and was selected Second Team All-Big 12.

On March 8, 2001, Bay-Regula threw her first career no-hitter, defeating the FIU Golden Panthers.

For her junior season, Bay-Regula threw two perfect games, the first on February 22, 2002, against the Tulsa Hurricanes. She would add one more as well as break the school records for strikeouts and strikeout ratio. Her wins, innings and shutouts were also all top-10 for a Cowgirl season in a First Team All-Big 12 year.

Bay-Regula&#x27;s banner senior season boasted her fourth All-Big 12 selection, Big 12 Player of the Year and First Team All-American honors.

She posted her career-best strikeout ratio (12.7, at the time was the NCAA fourth best season ratio), strikeouts and WHIP totals, two of which broke her own school records and remain tops. Bay-Regula&#x27;s ERA, wins and shutouts, all rank in the top 10 for a school season and also were career bests. Bay-Regula would rank top-5 in ERA, strikeouts and opponents&#x27; batting average for the season in the Big 12, all of those marks remain top-10 conference records.

On March 7, 2003, Bay-Regula tied the school single-game record for strikeouts when she fanned 17 in regulation against the Maryland Terrapins.

The win would also kick off a career-best 10 consecutive game win streak that was broken by the Oklahoma Sooners on April 2. In the last game of the next day on the 8th, the win was a 10-inning duel with Courtnay Foster of the Northwestern Wildcats with the two combining for 33 strikeouts and Bay-Regula tallying the 1,000th of her career.

Later that month on March 16, she broke and set the single-game record with 23 strikeouts in 11 innings, defeating the Kansas Jayhawks with a game-winning RBI hit and after the fourth pitching a complete game no-hitter to begin a 27.1 consecutive scoreless inning streak.

The total tied the NCAA fourth best single-game effort for strikeouts and now stands 6th all-time; as well the game featured 31 combined strikeouts with opposing pitcher Kara Pierce. The scoreless streak was snapped by the Tulsa Hurricanes when they scored in Bay-Regula&#x27;s fourth inning of relief, the Cowgirls eventually won that contest in extras on March 26. She had pitched 5 games, two complete with 54 strikeouts and surrendering only three hits and 7 walks for a 0.37 WHIP.

Bay-Regula would leave with career top-10 records in wins, ERA, shutouts, innings pitched while setting and still claiming the strikeouts and strikeout ratio crowns. For the Big 12, she ranks top-10 in career ERA (8th) and strikeouts (4th).

==Team Canada==
Having been a member since 1999, Bay-Regula made it to the 2004 Athens Olympics and the 2008 Beijing Olympics. At both events overall, Bay-Regula owns a 5–5 win–loss record, posted 69 strikeouts while giving up 10 earned runs in innings pitched for a 1.24 ERA. At the Tokyo games, Bay-Regula had a win in five innings of work and won a bronze medal after Canada defeated Team Mexico 3–2 on July 27, 2021.

==National Pro Fastpitch==
Bay-Regula entered the pros with the Chicago Bandits and played one full season over two years, where she also played for the Philadelphia Force. In 2005, she earned All-NPF West Team honors as well as sharing Pitcher of the Year with teammate Jennie Finch.

On June 30, 2005, Bay-Regula recorded the first no-hitter for the Chicago Bandits vs. the Stratford Brakettes. That same year, Bay-Regula went 17–1 with 137 strikeouts and a 0.88 ERA in 111.0 innings pitched. Bay would also vie for the Cowles Cup Championship on August 28, 2005, but was pulled after four innings and eventually lost the title to the Akron Racers.

==Personal life==
Her older brother, Jason Bay, was an outfielder in Major League Baseball for the Pittsburgh Pirates. Her husband, David Regula, was a placekicker for Dartmouth College, graduating as the second-leading scorer in school history. In 2015, Lauren and David Regula co-founded TrAk Athletics, a small group training and fitness facility in Akron, Ohio.

<doc id="925261" wikidata="Q264753" url="?curid=925261" title="Petroglyph National Monument">
<text>Petroglyph National Monument stretches along Albuquerque, New Mexico&#x27;s West Mesa, a volcanic basalt escarpment that dominates the city&#x27;s western horizon. Authorized June 27, 1990, the monument is cooperatively managed by the National Park Service and the City of Albuquerque. The western boundary of the monument features a chain of dormant fissure volcanoes. Beginning in the northwest corner, Butte volcano is followed to its south by Bond, Vulcan, Black and JA volcanoes.

Petroglyph National Monument protects a variety of cultural and natural resources including five volcanic cones, hundreds of archeological sites and an estimated 24,000 petroglyph images carved by Ancestral Pueblo peoples and early Spanish settlers. Many of the images are recognizable as animals, people, brands and crosses; others are more complex. Their meaning was, possibly, understood only by the carver. These images are the cultural heritage of a people who have long since moved into other areas and moved on through history for many reasons. The monument is intended as a protection for these lands and sites from and for visitors to see and appreciate for generations to come. The national monument is managed in a manner that allows recreational use. The monument has four major sites that visitors can access, Boca Negra Canyon, Rinconada Canyon, Piedras Marcadas Canyon, and the Volcano Day Use trails.

== Geologic history ==
Approximately 200,000 years ago, six volcanic eruptions created a cliff containing thick basalt layers of rock and cooled lava. When the volcanoes erupted, molten lava ranging in depth from flowed downhill using old water ways, called arroyos, which eventually formed triangular, peninsula shaped channels that flowed around hills. The hills have long since eroded away over time, while the stronger basalt rocks remained, which eventually cracked and formed canyons and escarpments. As time progressed, more eruptions occurred and thicker lava cooled to form the now-extinct volcanic cones to the west of the monument; these cones can be seen from the top of the mesa. This unique formation of the landscape is called reverse topography.

The basalt rocks&#x27; geologic nature allows for the creation of the petroglyphs, or rock carvings, on their surface. The rocks contain high concentrations of iron, manganese and calcium; this combination creates rocks of a gray-like color. However, over thousands of years of exposure to the desert&#x27;s rough environment, a &quot;desert varnish&quot; forms on the surface. The varnish is formed from the oxidization, or rusting, of the manganese and iron when mixed with oxygen in the air and water from rain; this varnish is dark, almost-black and glossy in appearance. Long ago, Native Americans, as well as Spanish settlers discovered that images can be created on the faces of the rocks by chipping away at this layer using rocks and other tools.

== Cultural history and significance ==
The petroglyph images within the monument hold deep cultural significance to Pueblo peoples and neighboring Native peoples. This rock art has complex and varied meanings.

Archaeologists have dated some carvings, primarily those in the Boca Negra Canyon area, as far back as 3,000 years ago. The relative age is determined based on the darkness of the image, its context, and its comparison to other works of the same age. It is estimated that about 90 percent of the petroglyphs were created during the period between AD 1300 until the end of the 17th century because of the &quot;Southwestern Style&quot; used. At this time, the Native population was increasing quickly and Pueblo adobe villages were being built along the Rio Grande and at the base of the Sandia Mountains.

==Stupa controversy==
In 1989, at least a year prior to the National Monument&#x27;s establishment, a Tibetan Buddhist stupa was built and consecrated on what was then private land owned by Harold Cohen and Ariane Emery. The National Park Service subsequently used eminent domain to seize this land and make it part of the Monument, over the owners&#x27; objections. The stupa was not removed, but all buildings on the land were razed.

On June 10, 2010, the Superintendent of Petroglyph National Monument sent an email stating that &quot;[w]hile soils are being stockpiled nearby for the future construction of an amphitheater, the National Park Service has no plans for the Stupa.&quot; The Monument website was also updated to describe the construction projects and clarify that the Stupa was not to be demolished.

However, in September 2012, the National Park Service (NPS) removed the stupa from Petroglyph National Monument. This action followed a review prompted by concerns over the constitutionality of maintaining a religious structure on federal land. The Department of the Interior&#x27;s solicitor general determined that retaining the stupa violated the Establishment Clause of the U.S. Constitution. Consequently, the NPS arranged for the stupa to be deconsecrated by a Tibetan lama and relocated it to a site selected by the local Buddhist community approximately 15 miles away.

==Other controversies==

Suburban development currently affects the Petroglyph National Monument site. The city of Albuquerque succeeded with their plans to build a 4 lane highway directly through the site itself. The issue was featured in the documentary, &quot;Reclaiming Their Voice: The Native American Vote in New Mexico &amp; Beyond&quot;.

Documents posted on June 6, 2012, by Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility (PEER) allege that although the Petroglyph National Monument is a valuable resource and location for the City of Albuquerque and the state of New Mexico, the historical resources contained within is in danger because of the City and the National Park Service (NPS) inability manage up to two-thirds of the monument that is City-owned land. In their opinion, there are no persistent standards or patrols protecting the petroglyphs or the surrounding areas.

Under a five-year Cooperative Management Agreement, National Park Service and the City specify the delegation of their respective responsibilities for the monument. The city, however, refuses to allow NPS rangers to patrol or enforce Park Service rules on City lands, which constitute the bulk of the monument. Due to City service cutbacks, most of the Petroglyph is left unpatrolled. In a July 25, 2011 letter to PEER, NPS Intermountain Regional Director John Wessels stated –

Southwest PEER Director Daniel Patterson said &quot;It is a disgrace that ancient rock art is obscured by both years of debris and last weekend&#x27;s vandalism ... Petroglyph is not just a regional but a national treasure which deserves the same protections as other national parks.&quot;

The 2008 Cooperative Management Agreement must be renewed by May 2013. PEER has launched a citizen petition and national campaign to persuade Albuquerque Mayor Richard J. Berry to allow NPS to provide full monument protection in the upcoming cooperative management pact.

<doc id="925262" wikidata="Q1338856" url="?curid=925262" title="National Diet Building">
<text>The is the building where both houses of the National Diet of Japan meet. It is located at Nagatachō 1-chome 7–1, Chiyoda, Tokyo.

Sessions of the House of Representatives take place in the south wing and sessions of the House of Councillors in the north wing.

The Diet Building was completed in 1936 and is constructed entirely of Japanese materials, with the exception of the stained glass, door locks, and pneumatic tube system.

==History==
The construction of the building for the old Diet of Japan began in 1920; however, plans for the building date back to the late 1880s. The Diet met in temporary structures for the first fifty years of its existence because there was no agreement over what form its building should take.

===Early designs===
German architects Wilhelm Böckmann and Hermann Ende were invited to Tokyo in 1886 and 1887, respectively. They created two plans for a Diet building. Böckmann&#x27;s initial plan was a masonry structure with a dome and flanking wings, similar to other legislatures of the era, which would form the core of a large &quot;government ring&quot; south of the Imperial Palace. However, at the time there was public resistance in Japan to Foreign Minister Inoue Kaoru&#x27;s internationalist policies, and so the architects submitted a more &quot;Japanese&quot; design as well, substituting traditional Japanese architectural features for many parts of the building. Ende and Böckmann&#x27;s Diet Building was never built, but their other &quot;government ring&quot; designs were used for the Tokyo District Court and Ministry of Justice buildings.

In 1898, Prime Minister Itō Hirobumi interviewed American Ralph Adams Cram, who proposed a more &quot;Oriental&quot; design for the building, featuring tiled roofs and a large enclosure of walls and gates. The Itō government fell as Cram was en route to the United States, and the project was dropped.

=== First building, second building, and fires at both ===
With an internal deadline approaching, the government enlisted Ende and Böckmann associate Adolph Stegmueller and Japanese architect Yoshii Shigenori to design a temporary structure. The building, a two-story, European-style wooden structure, opened in November 1890 on a site in Hibiya.

An electrical fire burned down the first building in January 1891, only two months later. Another Ende and Böckmann associate, Oscar Tietze, joined Yoshii to design its replacement. The second building was larger than the first, but followed a similar design: it housed the Diet until 1925 when another fire destroyed the building.

=== Current Diet building ===
In 1910, the Finance Ministry started a commission in an attempt to take control over the new Diet Building design from the Home Ministry. Prime Minister Katsura Tarō (桂 太郎) chaired the commission, which recommended that the new building emulate an Italian Renaissance architectural style. This recommendation was criticized by many who thought that choice to be too arbitrary.

The ministry sponsored a public design competition in 1918, and 118 designs were submitted for the new building. The first prize winner, Watanabe Fukuzo (渡辺 福三), produced a design similar to Ende and Böckmann’s.
The Diet Building was eventually constructed between 1920 and 1936 with a floor plan based on Watanabe’s entry. 
The roof and tower of the building might have been inspired by another entrant, third prize winner Takeuchi Shinshichi, and are believed to have been chosen because they reflected a more modern hybrid architecture than the purely European and East Asian designs proposed by other architects. While the actual source for the “Pyramid” roof remains unclear, Japanese historian Jonathan Reynolds suggests it was “probably borrowed” from Takeuchi although an image of the entry is not provided but instead he thanks fellow historian of Africa studies at Columbia, Zoe Strother, for mentioning that Takeuchi’s design resembles the Mausoleum at Halicarnassus, which was a model for some prominent Western designs in the early 20th century, such as John Russell Pope&#x27;s 1911 award-winning House of the Temple in Washington, D.C., and the downtown Los Angeles City Hall, completed in 1928.

== Main facilities in the National Diet Building ==
The building assigns jurisdiction over the central entrance, the central hall, Gokyusho (emperor&#x27;s resting space), and the central tower to the House of Councilors (Upper House), the front courtyard to the House of Representatives (Lower House), and the National Diet Library suboffice on the 4th floor of the central tower to the National Diet Library.

=== Central entrance ===
The central entrance stands behind the main gate and below the central tower. It is characterized by the wide driveway and the entrance doors that are made of bronze and each measure in height, in width, and 1.125 tons in weight. These doors for the central entrance, the separate entrance doors for each House building, and the bronze doors inside the building were outsourced to and built by Tokyo School of Fine Arts (currently Tokyo University of the Arts).

The central entrance is not for daily use to enter and exit the Diet building and is called “the door that never opens” because of its restricted access. The entrance is used when Diet members attend their first session after a House of Representatives general election or a House of Councilors regular election and when welcoming the Emperor or foreign heads of state into the Diet building. It is also used to allow visitors into the building during open house events.

=== Central hall ===

The lobby behind the central entrance and right below the central tower is what is called the central hall. The hall has a stairwell that reaches from the second floor to the sixth floor and a ceiling that is high. The ceiling is made of stained glass and has four oil paintings of Japan&#x27;s four seasons in its corners. The paintings each depict Mount Yoshino in the spring, Lake Towada in the summer, Okunikko in the fall, and the Japan Alps in the winter. They were drawn not by famous artists but by art students.

In the four corners of the central hall are statues of Itagaki Taisuke, Okuma Shigenobu, and Ito Hirobumi who were instrumental in establishing constitutional government in Japan, and an empty pedestal. It is not clear why there is an empty pedestal. Some claim original designers could not reach consensus on whose statue to install, or that it encapsulated the idea that politics is never complete. Others say designers left it open to urge politicians today to outstrip the three grand predecessors, or that they avoided erecting a statue with its back to the Imperial palace. The empty pedestal is displayed with a big pine bonsai on the first day of the Diet session.

=== Central tower ===
The central tower measures in height, and surpassed Mitsukoshi’s main store () which was the tallest building at the time the Diet building was constructed. It remained the tallest building in Japan until Hotel New Otani’s main -building was constructed in 1964.

Inside the pyramid-shaped dome is a large hall, from the center of which a spiral staircase leads up to the observatory on the top floor of the tower. The observatory is said to have offered a panoramic view over Tokyo, but both the observatory and the hall are closed today to all but the building manager. Even Diet members must obtain permission to enter.

The fourth floor of the central tower is a sub-office of the National Diet Library and can be used freely by anyone affiliated with the Diet. The fourth floor does not have a restroom because it would be situated above the restroom designated for the Emperor, located nearby Gokyusho (as described later).

In September 2003, the central tower was hit by lightning, and the granite stone at the top of the tower ruptured, breaking the stained glass beneath. Employees of Kajima Corporation who happened to be present at the scene to fix a restroom requested help from their own company which ended up being in charge of the repair work of the tower. The ruptured granite stone is currently owned by Tohoku University and the Kiseki Museum of World Stones in Fujinomiya, Shizuoka.

=== &quot;Gokyūsho&quot; ===

The &quot;Gokyūsho&quot; (御休所) was originally referred to as &quot;Gobinden&quot; (御便殿) and was built as a place for the Emperor to rest upon his visit to the Diet to attend events like the opening and closing ceremonies. The chamber is located at the top of the main stairway covered with a red carpet that leads from the central hall. The L-shaped desk for the Emperor is a remnant from the pre-war era when the Emperor dressed in military uniform and needed a place to put his headdress to use his right hand to sign documents, while having his left side (carrying the sword) unencumbered. In this room, the Emperor receives courtesy visits from chairmen and vice chairmen of both Houses before attending the opening ceremony in the Chamber of the House of Councilors.

Supposedly with ten percent of the entire construction cost spent on this room, &quot;Gokyūsho&quot; is entirely made of cypress coated with Japanese lacquer, and adornments above the outside of the room are made from cuckoo, a type of stone extracted in Anan, Tokushima. The materials and decorations used for this room are particularly rich in craftsmanship and glamour among all the rooms in the Diet building. The chandelier is made of crystal. A private restroom for the Emperor stands close to &quot;Gokyūsho&quot; and has both western and Japanese style toilets.

When the Emperor travels between the Imperial Palace and the Diet, he is escorted by police motorcade, police cars, and an open limousine accompanied by Imperial Palace guards and law enforcement officials from the Tokyo police department. Diet guards put on white ceremonial robes in the summer and black robes in the winter on the day of the Emperor&#x27;s visit. It is said that Mount Fuji could be viewed from the windows of &quot;Gokyūsho&quot; before office buildings blocked the view. Much of the interiors of the Diet building are designed by Naigai Technos Co.

=== Chambers of the House of Representatives and the House of Councillors===


These large halls are usually called the “main chambers” and are located on the 2nd floor of each House building with a ceiling that opens up to the 3rd floor. The ceiling is partly made from stained glass which lets in sunlight, so the ceiling lights are kept turned off unless there is a plenary assembly in the chamber. The floor is structured in the so-called “continental” fashion; the floor forms a fan shape with the chairman and the podium at its center, and member seats are allotted to each parliamentary group in accordance to their size.

The chairman sits in the center accompanied by the secretary general on his right. The podium stands in front of the chairman&#x27;s seat, and the stenographer sits beneath the podium. Two rows of seats stretch on both sides of the chair, the front row for cabinet members (the seat closest to the chairman is for the Prime Minister) and the back row for the Diet administrative staffs.

The Diet members’ seats are designated by the chairman at the beginning of a Diet session but can be switched during a session if necessary. The House of Representatives makes it a custom to allocate larger parliamentary groups to the chairman&#x27;s right. In other words, the majority party will sit on the furthest right to the chairman followed by the second largest party, and independents sit in the far left. In the House of Councillors, by contrast, the largest parliamentary group sits in the center with smaller groups on either side. Within a parliamentary group, members who have been elected the fewest times are seated in the front rows closest to the chairman, while those with a longer record as politicians sit in the back rows. Each seat has a number and a name plate with white letters in a black background.

In the House of Councillors, the Emperor&#x27;s throne is at the top of the stairs behind the chairman&#x27;s seat which will be removed in preparation for the opening ceremony. As a legacy of the historic custom to invite the Emperor to the Chamber of the House of Peers in the opening ceremony of the Imperial Diet, even today the opening ceremonies invite the Emperor to the Chamber of the House of Councillors, a successor of the House of Peers, where the Emperor makes his opening statement from his throne. In the Chamber of the House of Councillors, the microphones are only for the chairman and the podium, while in the Chamber of the House of Representatives, they are also given to the secretary general who report voting results and the Diet member in charge of making procedural motions.

There are currently 242 members of the House of Councillors but 460 seats in the Chamber as members of the House of Representatives also attend the opening ceremony held at the Chamber. The number of seats, however, is still not enough to accommodate the entire 722 members of the Diet, so at the opening ceremony Diet members are sometimes seen standing in the aisles or space in the back of the floor.

Both Chambers prohibit Diet members from entering without a jacket and a member badge based on precedent (identification cards are accepted since 2005). No exceptions are allowed to this rule; then-Prime Minister Takeo Fukuda once attempted to enter the Chamber while forgetting to wear his badge and was halted by the guards, the situation of which was resolved when Fukuda hastily borrowed a member badge from a nearby Diet member, Yoshiro Mori.

Parenthetically, either House restricts its members from wearing hats, coats, scarfs, or carrying umbrellas or walking sticks without permission from the chairman. Smoking is also prohibited. Diet members are also forbidden to read newspapers and literature other than reference materials.

=== Public gallery ===
Above the rear of the Chamber is a public gallery which is physically a part of the Chamber but is considered a different jurisdiction under the Diet internal regulations. According to those rules, visitors to the public gallery are forbidden from entering the Chamber.

The public gallery in the House of Representatives is divided into seats for VIPs, diplomats, members of the House of Councillors, government officials, the general public and journalists. The public gallery in the House of Councillors accommodates the imperial family, VIPs, foreign diplomats, members of the House of Representatives, government officials, the general public and journalists. The general public seats are partly assigned to guests invited by a Diet member with the rest open to visitors on a first-come-first-served basis.

Visitors to the public gallery must have admission tickets. Newspaper and news service reporters receive passes valid for an entire Diet session. The public gallery must follow internal statutes mandated by the chairman, and the chairman retains the authority to command the guards and law enforcement officials to maintain order in the public gallery.

=== Committees ===

The largest committee room in each House is Committee Room Number 1 which is widely known for its live broadcasts and where the budget committee, key special committees and political party debates are hosted. Summoning of sworn and unsworn witnesses also takes place in this room.
