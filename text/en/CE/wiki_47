<text>The forms of action were the different procedures by which a legal claim could be made during much of the history of the English common law. Depending on the court, a plaintiff would purchase a writ in Chancery (or file a bill) which would set in motion a series of events eventually leading to a trial in one of the medieval common law courts. Each writ entailed a different set of procedures and remedies which together amounted to the &quot;form of action&quot;.

The forms of action were abolished during the 19th century, but they have left an indelible mark on the law. In the early Middle Ages, the focus was on the procedure that was employed to bring one&#x27;s claim to the royal courts of King&#x27;s Bench or Common Pleas: it was the &quot;form&quot; of one&#x27;s action, not its substance, which occupied legal discussion. This restrictive approach is one of the reasons which attracted litigants to petition the King directly, which eventually led to the development of a separate court known as the Court of Chancery, from which the body of law known as equity derives. Modern English law, as in most other legal systems, now looks to substance rather than to form: a claimant needs only to demonstrate a valid cause of action.

==Forms of action==
The substantive law lay buried beneath the various actions: medieval practitioners and judges thought procedurally, not substantively. Rights and duties which are today considered to be part of the law of property, tort, contract or unjust enrichment were not conceptualised as such.

In the early medieval period, English justice was administered at a local level, first through traditional Anglo-Saxon institutions such as the courts of the hundreds and the wapentakes, and later through the manorial courts. Following the Norman conquest of England in the 11th century, a system of centralized royal justice gradually began to take shape. The principal royal courts were King&#x27;s Bench, Common Pleas, and Exchequer. These royal courts were initially only interested in matters relating to the feudal system: that is, to land law. Accordingly, many of the earliest writs dealt with real property. For example:
* Writ of right
* assize of novel disseisin
* assize of mort d&#x27;ancestor
* Writ of entry sur disseisin in the per and cui
* Writ of besaiel
* Writ of quare impedit
* Ejectment

Over time, the royal courts began to take notice of other cases. These early writs were in the &quot;praecipe&quot; form: they commanded that the defendant perform a certain act or else appear and explain why he had not done so. Examples include the writs of covenant, debt and account. Such writs &quot;demanded something as of right&quot;. The royal courts were initially only concerned with &quot;complaints of wrong&quot; if the wrong involved a forcible breach of the King&#x27;s Peace. Such wrongs were enforced by a writ of trespass &quot;vi et armis contra pacem regis&quot;. During the 14th century the royal courts gradually allowed actions which did not involve breaches of the King&#x27;s Peace. Instead, the plaintiff would set out his &#x27;special case&#x27; in an extra clause, specifying the damage sustained which justified the bringing of an action. This was known as a trespass on the case. From the trespass on the case developed many other forms of action. Apart from the actions which dealt with real property, other significant forms of action include:
* Action of covenant
* Action of debt &quot;sur obligation&quot; (&quot;Debt on an obligation&quot;)
* Action of debt &quot;sur contract&quot; (&quot;Debt on a contract&quot;)
* Action of detinue
* Action of account
* Trespass &quot;vi et armis contra pacem regis&quot; (&quot;Trespass with force and arms against the King&#x27;s peace&quot;)
* Trespass &quot;sur la case&quot; (&quot;Trespass on the case&quot; or &quot;action on the case&quot;)
** Conversion
** Nuisance
** Negligence
** Deceit
** Action on the case for words (Defamation, Slander) 
** Assumpsit
*** Special assumpsit
*** Indebitatus assumpsit 
**** Action for money had and received to the plaintiff&#x27;s use
**** Action for money paid to the defendant&#x27;s use
**** Quantum meruit
**** Quantum valebant

Many actions developed from the action on the case during the later history of the common law. The three most significant of these were: 
* &quot;The action of assumpsit&quot;, the rapid expansion of which is traced to &quot;Slade&#x27;s Case&quot; (1602). The medieval law of contract developed in a fractured way through the old actions of covenant, debt and account. In the 1500s litigants began to use the action on the case to enforce contractual agreements (with the exception of contracts under seal, for which debt &quot;sur obligation&quot; was required), a shift vindicated in &quot;Slade&#x27;s Case&quot;. The modern law of contract then gradually began to take shape.
* &quot;The action of indebitatus assumpsit&quot;. Following the recognition in &quot;Slade&#x27;s Case&quot; (1602) that assumpsit could be brought in lieu of debt &quot;sur contract&quot;, a form of action known as indebitatus assumpsit took shape. This action developed several sub-forms known as the common money counts. These actions were initially used to enforce what we would call contractual liability, but they rested on the court implying that a defendant had promised to pay a sum of money to the plaintiff. This promise initially reflected reality, but came to be used fictitiously. Thus where A mistakenly paid money to B, the law would imply a promise by B that B would repay the money: A could then bring an action for money had and received and recover the mistaken payment. The defendant&#x27;s obligation was not consensually undertaken, but imposed by law. From such actions came the law of quasi-contract. This area of law is now known as the law of unjust enrichment. 
* &quot;The action on the case for negligence&quot;, the rapid expansion of which is traced to &quot;Donoghue v Stevenson&quot; [1932]. The tort of negligence lies at the heart of the modern law of tort, which also includes obligations enforced via the old actions of trespass (to the person, to goods, and to land), actions on the case, conversion, deceit, and defamation.

==England==
One of the reasons for the crystallisation of particular forms of action in English common law is the fact that actions in the royal courts were commenced by use of a writ purchased in Chancery. Initially, the clerks of the Chancery were permitted to devise new writs to deal with new situations. This freedom was drastically curtailed in 1258 by the Provisions of Oxford.

By the 14th century, the common law had begun to show some of its defects. First, different forms of action would result in different procedures, meaning that one&#x27;s chance of success was strongly dependent upon the form of action which was used. The forms were mandatory: if the wrong form was used, a case would be dismissed with prejudice. Second, the common law had strict rules of evidence. For example, a deed was conclusive proof of a defendant&#x27;s liability to pay. If a plaintiff brought a writ of debt &quot;sur obligation&quot; against the defendant, but the defendant had already paid the debt, the defendant would still be held liable to pay unless he could produce a deed of acquittance. Problems such as these prompted litigants to turn to the Court of Chancery, which had begun to develop judicial functions in the early 14th century.

===Abolition of the forms===

Because the forms of action remained largely static from the 13th century, English lawyers and judges formulated a number of legal fictions in order to fit new types of cases within the existing forms.

For example, in a writ of debt &quot;sur contract&quot;, the defendant could generally elect between having a jury trial or wager of law. The latter was a particularly undesired option for a plaintiff because the defendant could &quot;hire&quot; oath-helpers. This and other restrictions (for example, that the sum the plaintiff sued for had to be a fixed rather than an unliquidated sum) made debt &quot;sur contract&quot; undesirable for enforcing oral contracts. In the 16th century, litigants began to bring an action on the case instead: an action of assumpsit. The plaintiff would allege that, because the defendant was indebted to the plaintiff, the defendant had undertaken (&quot;assumpsit&quot;) to pay the money. The Court of King&#x27;s Bench gradually accepted that the subsequent promise did not need to be proven: the defendant&#x27;s alleged promise to pay the antecedent debt would be supplied by law. This view was vindicated in &quot;Slade&#x27;s Case&quot; (1602).

The forms themselves remained unchallenged. The Court of Chancery eventually ceased to be the answer to the restrictive approach at common law. By the 16th century the intervention of the Lord Chancellor was increasingly said to depend on principles, rather than on some unbounded discretion. Chancery developed a stronger system of precedent and, in the words of Professor Sir John Baker, &quot;hardened into a kind of law&quot;.

During the 19th century, Parliament passed several laws to simplify legal procedure, and the old forms of action were gradually swept away:
* For personal forms of action, the Uniformity of Process Act 1832 (2 &amp; 3 Will. 4. c. 39) imposed a single uniform process. The older forms of writ were abolished and a new form of writ was to be used, although the writ had to state the form of action that was being used.
* The next year, most real and mixed actions were abolished, by section 36 of the Real Property Limitation Act 1833 (3 &amp; 4 Will. 4. c. 27).
* There then followed the Common Law Procedure Act 1852 (15 &amp; 16 Vict. c. 76), which dropped the requirement that any particular form of action should be mentioned within a writ. 
* With the passage of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act 1873 (36 &amp; 37 Vict. c. 66), most of the last vestiges of the forms of action were removed. The flexible bill procedure of Chancery was adopted by the common law courts. It was now only necessary to state the facts sufficient to give rise to one&#x27;s cause of action.
The final vestige of the forms of action was abolished in 1980 by Chancellor Hailsham: the language of the original writs in which the sovereign commanded the defendant to appear in court and answer, or else. Lord Hailsham felt that &quot;sending a command from the queen herself was too intimidating&quot; for ordinary laypeople. The last original writ in the name of the queen was issued on 2 June 1980.

=== The substantive law ===
With the abolition of the forms of action, it became necessary (and for the first time truly possible) to perceive the substantive law beneath the various actions. In terms of the private law of obligations, the following points can be noted.
* &quot;Contract.&quot; The various writs by which agreements could be enforced became part of a modern law of contract, explicable in terms of consensually assumed obligation. But traces of the old forms of action remain. For example, it is not necessary to show that a claimant has provided consideration where she sues on a deed. This is because consideration was never a requirement in the action of debt &quot;sur obligation&quot;.
* &quot;Tort.&quot; The various writs which involved complaint of a civil wrong and a demand for a remedy came together in a law of tort. 
* &quot;Unjust enrichment.&quot; At first, common law restitutionary obligations were appended to the law of contract and said to form a law of quasi-contract. Motivated by the writing of scholars from Oxford and Cambridge the courts gradually accepted that such obligations were of another kind, underpinned by the concept of unjust enrichment. In &quot;Lipkin Gorman v Karpnale Ltd&quot; [1991] the House of Lords explicitly recognised the independent existence of the law of unjust enrichment.

==South Australia==

The &quot;Common Law Procedure Act 1852&quot; (15 and 16 Vic., c. 76) was enacted prior to the promulgation of the Colonial Laws Validity Act 1865 and while it was repealed in England, continued to apply by paramount force in South Australia. 
The Supreme Court Act 1935 grants to the Supreme Court of South Australia the like jurisdiction exercised by both the common law and equity courts of England prior to the enactment of the Judiciary Acts which included the initiation of a personal jurisdiction over a person in a case by virtue of the issue of a writ of summons. The judges of the Court were given power to regulate the procedure of the Court within jurisdiction and preserved the Rules of Court extant in 1935, for cases not otherwise provided for. The writ of summons is the common originating process, but takes a form approved under the present rules.

==United States==

The forms of action survived much longer in the United States. New York was the first to abolish them, by enacting a Code of Civil Procedure in 1850 at the suggestion of David Dudley Field II. Twenty-six other states eventually followed. Section 307 of the California Code of Civil Procedure is a typical example of how the forms of action were abolished in those states: &quot;There is in this State but one form of civil actions for the enforcement or protection of private rights and the redress or prevention of private wrongs.&quot;

However, the forms of action persisted in the federal courts until 1938, when the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure were promulgated pursuant to the Rules Enabling Act. Rule 2, at that time, stated: &quot;There shall be one form of action to be known as &#x27;civil action&#x27;.&quot; Since 35 U.S. states now use versions of the FRCP in their state courts and the remaining 15 states are all &quot;code pleading&quot; states, the forms of action are now obsolete in the United States.

<text>The Pindaris (Bhalse, Maratha, Rohilla and Pathans) were irregular military plunderers and foragers in 17th- through early 19th-century Indian subcontinent who accompanied initially the Mughal Army, and later the Maratha Army, and finally on their own before being eliminated in the 1817–19 Pindari War. They were unpaid and their compensation was entirely the booty they plundered during wars and raids. They were mostly horsemen armed with spears and swords who would create chaos and deliver intelligence about the enemy positions to benefit the army they accompanied. The majority of their leaders were Muslims, but also had people of all classes and religions.

The earliest mention of them is found in the Mughal period during Aurangzeb&#x27;s campaign in the Deccan, but their role expanded with the Maratha armed campaigns against the Mughal Empire. They were highly effective against the enemies given their rapid and chaotic thrust into enemy territories, but also caused serious abuses against allies such as during the Pindari raid on Sringeri Sharada Peetham in 1791. By the early 1800s, armed Pindari militia groups sought wealth for their leaders and themselves. There were an estimated 20,000 to 30,000 Pindari militia during the &quot;Gardi-ka-wakt&quot; (&quot;period of unrest&quot;) in north-central India around 1800–1815 CE, who plundered villages, captured people as slaves for sale, and challenged the authority of local Muslim sultanates, Hindu kingdoms, and the British colonies.

Francis Rawdon-Hastings, the Governor-General of British India, led an 120,000 strong force in early 19th-century against the Pindaris during the Third Anglo-Maratha War; the campaign became known as the Pindari War.

==Etymology==
The term &quot;Pindar&quot; may derive from &quot;pinda&quot;, an intoxicating drink. It is a Marathi word that possibly connotes a &quot;bundle of grass&quot; or &quot;who takes&quot;. They are also referred to as &quot;Bidaris&quot; in some historic texts, indicating that they originally came from the Bidar district in central India.

==Appearance and society==
The Pindaris were horsemen who were mostly armed with a talwar and a large spear. They were organised into groups called &quot;durrahs&quot; each of which had a leader and were organised into different castes and classes. Allegiances were usually hereditary but membership of each &quot;durrah&quot; could be interchangeable. 

The Pindaris were from a variety of traditional backgrounds, all of which appear to have been accepted within their society. In addition to their individual beliefs, the Pindaris worshipped Ramasah Veer, an ancient Pindari raider, as an icon. Pindari women would place small icons of horses in a shrine dedicated to Veer before the commencement of their raids, and the men would wear tokens stamped with his image. The Pindaris were of all classes but most of their important leaders were Muslims. They converted many of their children and the men whom they took as prisoners. Many Hindus also became converts to obtain honourable association with the fellow Pindaris.

The raids, called &quot;luhbur&quot;, would be conducted in the dry-season starting from late October. During the rainy season, the Pindari would stay with their families in their native lands around the Narmada River.

==History==
===Era of the Deccan Sultanates and the Mughal Empire===
The first clear mention of Pindaris in historical texts occurs in the works of the Persian historian, Firishta, who refers to them marching with the Mughal armies of Aurangzeb during his 1689 campaign in the Deccan Plateau. Around the same time, the Italian traveler Niccolao Manucci, in his memoir about the Mughal Empire, wrote about Bederia (Pidari), stating that &quot;these are the first to invade the enemy&#x27;s territory, where they plunder everything they find.&quot;

According to Tapan Raychaudhuri et al., the Mughal Army &quot;always had in its train the &quot;Bidari&quot; (as pronounced in Persian), the privileged and recognized thieves who first plundered the enemy territory and everything they could find&quot;. The Deccan sultanates and Aurangzeb&#x27;s campaign in central India deployed them against kingdoms such as Golconda, and in Bengal. The unpaid cavalry got compensated for their services by &quot;burning and looting everywhere&quot;. The disintegration of the Muslim kingdoms of the Deccan led to the gradual disbandment of the Pindaris. These Muslim Pindaris were at that stage taken in the service of the Marathas. The inclusion of the Pindaris eventually became an indispensable part and parcel of the Maratha Army. As a class of freebooters in Maratha armies they acted as a &quot;sort of roving cavalry...rendering them much the same service as the Cossacks for the armies of Russia.&quot; The Pindaris would also later be used by kings such as Tipu Sultan. The Hindu Marathas, in their war against the Mughals, evolved this concept by encouraging the Pindaris not only to plunder the Muslim territories in the north but gather and deliver food to their regular army. The Maratha army never carried provisions, and gathered their resources and provisions from the enemy territory as they invaded and conquered more regions of the collapsing Mughal state. According to the historian Richard Eaton, plunder of frontier regions was a part of the strategy that contributed wealth and propelled the Sultanate systems in the Indian subcontinent. Plunder, along with taxes and tribute payments contributed to growing imperial revenues for the Mughal rulers.

The Bidaris of the Aurangzeb&#x27;s army and the Pindaris of the Maratha army extended this tradition of violence and plunder in their pursuit of the political and ideological wars. Shivaji, and later his successors, included the Pindaris in their war strategy. Deploying the Pindaris, they plundered the Mughal and Sultanate territories surrounding the Maratha Empire and used the plundered wealth to sustain the Maratha Army.

The devastation and disruption by the Pindaris not only strengthened the Marathas, the Pindaris helped weaken and frustrate the Muslim sultans in preserving a stable kingdom they could rule or rely on for revenues. The Maratha strategy also embarrassed Aurangzeb and his court. The same Pindari-assisted strategy help the Marathas block and reverse the Mughal era gains in South India as far as Gingee and Tiruchirappalli.

===Maratha era===
Marathas adopted the Bidaris militia of the earlier era. Their Pindaris were not from any particular religion or caste. Most of the Pindari leaders who plundered for the Marathas were Muslims, such as Gardi Khan and Ghats-u-Din who were employed by the Maratha Peshwa Balaji Baji Rao. Other famed Pindari leaders in the historic literature include Namdar Khan, Dost Mohammad, Wasil Mohammad, Chitu, Khajeh Bush, Fazil Khan and Amir Khan. Similarly, Hindu leaders of Pindaris included the Gowaris, Alande, Ghyatalak, Kshirsagar, Ranshing and Thorat. Hindu ascetics and monks were another pool that volunteered as militia to save their temples and villages from the Muslim invaders but also disrupted enemy supply lines and provided reconnaissance to the Marathas.

According to Randolf Cooper, the Pindaris who served the Marathas were a volunteer militia that included men and their wives, along with enthusiastic followers that sometimes swelled to some 50,000 people at the frontline of a war. They moved swiftly and performed the following duties: destabilize enemy&#x27;s standing army and state apparatus by creating chaos; isolate enemy armed units by harassing them, provoke and waste enemy resources; break or confuse the logistical and communication lines of the enemy; gather intelligence about the size and armament of the enemy; raid enemy food and fodder to supply resources for the Marathas and deplete the same for the enemy.

The Pindaris of the Marathas did not attack the enemy infantry, rather operated by picketing the civilians, outposts, trade routes and the territorial sidelines. Once the confusion had set in among the enemy ranks, the trained and armed contingents of the Marathas attacked the enemy army. The Marathas, in some cases, collected &quot;palpatti&quot; – a form of tax – from the hordes of their Pindari plunderers to participate with them during their invasions.

The Pindaris were a major resource for the Marathas, but they also created problems when they raided and plundered the Maratha allies. Shivaji introduced extensive regulations to check and manage the targeted predatory actions of the Pindari.

During the Third Battle of Panipat, Vishwasrao was in command of thousands of Pindari units.

From 1784, Shinde began recruiting large amounts of Indian Muslim cavalrymen from Mughal, Farrukhabad and Rohilkhand regions. At a time when the Marathas would mobilize 78,000 cavalry, 27,000 were Pindari Muslim cavalry.

===British Empire era===
Most of the Pindaris in this time were from Uttar Pradesh and northern parts of Malwa. The decline of Muslim rule in northern India, for the Indian Muslim elite, meant the destruction of a way of life more than a destruction of livelihood. The East India Company&#x27;s disciplined armies based on the well-drilled musketeer provided little employment and had little use for irregular cavalry. Many of these Indian Muslim cavalrymen, seeking employment, would join the Pindaris. These unemployed Muslim soldiers from the land of Awadh and Rohilkhand in Uttar Pradesh began ravaging and desolating central India, armed with twelve-foot long spears.

With the decline of the prestige of Maratha power in India, the Pindaris almost became supreme. After the arrival of the British East India Company among the chaos of a collapsed Mughal Empire and the weakening of the Maratha leadership, the Pindaris became a semi-independent power centred in the area just north of the Narmada River. By late 18th-century, the Maratha Empire had fragmented, the British colonial era had arrived and the Pindaris had transformed from being involved in regional wars to looting for the sake of their own and their leaders&#x27; wealth. They conducted raids for plunder to enrich themselves, or to whichever state was willing to hire them. Sometimes they worked for both sides in a conflict, causing heavy damages to the civilian populations of both sides. They advanced through central India, Gujarat and Malwa, with protection from rulers from Gwalior and Indore. With the plundered wealth, they had also acquired cannons and more deadly military equipment to challenge local troops and law enforcement personnel. The Amir Khan-linked Pindaris, for example, brought 200 canons to seize and plunder Jaipur. According to Edward Thompson, the Pindaris led by Amir Khan and those led by Muhammad Khan had become nearly independent mobile satellite confederacy that launched annual loot and plunder campaigns, after the monsoon harvest season, on rural and urban settlements. Along with cash, produce and family wealth, these Pindari leaders took people as slaves for sale. They attacked regions under British control, the Hindu rajas, and the Muslim nawabs.

In 1812 and 1813 the Pindaris conducted successful plundering raids on Mirzapur and Surat which were located in areas controlled by the British. In 1816, they undertook an extensive expedition into the East India Company territories around the Guntur district, raiding 339 villages and taking an estimated £100,000 worth of loot. Some of the inhabitants of village Ainavolu committed suicide by throwing themselves into the flames of their burning houses. The British reacted, not only to the financial cost of these raids, but also to the loss of trust the inhabitants had in them as a protective power. They established military outposts south of the Narmada River which contained the Pindaris and prevented any further raids.

===Pindari War (1817-19)===
Ultimately, the British East India Company under the governorship of Lord Hastings became so frustrated with Pindari raids that they formed the largest military force they had ever assembled in India to launch a campaign against the Pindaris known as the Pindari War. Rawdon-Hastings, with the approval of the Court of Directors of the East India Company, also utilized this 120,000 strong force to fight against the remaining Maratha forces and annex their remaining territories in what became known as the Third Anglo-Maratha War. From November 1817 until 1819, the British military force entered the Malwa and Maratha regions which were traditional Pindari strongholds; according to the Encyclopædia Britannica, the &quot;Pindaris themselves offered little resistance; most of the leaders surrendered, and their followers dispersed&quot;.

In addition to the military action, the British East India Company also offered regular employment to some of the Pindari militia by converting them into a separate contingent of its own forces. A minority were given jobs as police and offered pensions or nawab positions along with land to their leaders such as Namdar Khan and Amir Khan. Chitu Khan, who was a Muslim of Jat origin born near Delhi, harbored violent anti-British feelings, saying he would &quot;ravage and destroy the country of the English&quot;. Not given any clemency, he hid in a jungle where he was continuously tracked by authorities and eventually was killed by a tiger.

==In popular culture==

<text>&quot;No soap radio&quot; is a form of practical joke and an example of surreal comedy. The joke is a prank whereby the punch line has no relation to the body of the joke, but participants in the prank pretend otherwise. The effect is either to trick someone into laughing along as if they &quot;get it&quot; or to ridicule them for not understanding.

The joke became popular in New York in the 1950s. The punch line is known for its use as a basic sociological and psychological experiment, specifically relating to mob mentality and the pressure to conform. The basic setup is similar to the Asch conformity experiments, in which people showed a proclivity to agree with a group despite their own judgments.

==Execution of the prank==

This prank usually requires a teller and two listeners, one of whom is an accomplice who already knows the joke and secretly plays along with the teller. The joke teller says something like, &quot;The elephant and the hippopotamus were taking a bath. And the elephant said to the hippo, &#x27;Please pass the soap.&#x27; The hippo replied, &#x27;No soap, radio. The accomplice laughs at the punchline, while the second listener is left puzzled. In some cases, the second listener will pretend to understand the joke and laugh along with the others to avoid appearing foolish.

The purpose of the prank is to elicit one of two responses from the victim:
* &quot;False understanding&quot;when the victim acts as if the joke is humorous, when in fact the victim does not understand the joke at all.
* &quot;Negative understanding&quot;when the victim expresses confusion about what the joke means and feels left out (e.g., &quot;I don&#x27;t get it&quot;). The conspirators are now prepared to mock the victim for the victim&#x27;s &quot;inability to get it&quot;.

Sometimes, if the second listener does not respond right away, there is an &quot;explanation&quot; of the joke to the second listener, which involves the teller and the first listener emphasizing words or elongating pauses, but providing no further information, e.g. &quot;Don&#x27;t you get it? No &quot;soooap&quot;... &quot;radio&quot;!&quot;

Other examples of the joke:
* A woman goes into her bathroom and is shocked to find an elephant in her bathtub. She asks the elephant, &quot;What are you doing in my bathtub?&quot; The elephant responds, &quot;No soap, radio!&quot;
* Two polar bears are sitting in a bathtub. The first one says, &quot;Pass the soap.&quot; The second one says, &quot;No soap, radio!&quot;
* A foreign man is flying in an airplane. He points out of the window at the unfamiliar countryside below and exclaims, &quot;No soap... radio?&quot;

==Origin==
The phrase &quot;no soap&quot; possibly originated around 1860 when it was first recorded, meaning &quot;I haven&#x27;t any money&quot; or &quot;I will not lend you money&quot;. Its contemporary connotation is &quot;not a chance&quot; or &quot;nothing doing&quot;. However, the phrase itself was being employed in an absurd and humorous context as early as the 1750s, when it appeared in a well-known piece of literary nonsense by English dramatist and actor Samuel Foote in order to test the memory of a rival: &quot;So she went into the garden to cut a cabbage-leaf to make an apple-pie; and at the same time a great she-bear, coming up the street, pops its head into the shop. &#x27;What! No soap?&#x27; So he died, and she very imprudently married the barber.&quot;

Eric Partridge and William Safire dated the phrase to the 1930s or 1940s.

==Comedy==
As a practical joke, the trick is an example of anti-humor or surreal comedy. The scenario resulting from false understanding is a demonstration of groupthink and peer pressurethe desire to conform to one&#x27;s peersdespite the fact that the entire joke has no hidden meaning, nothing to &quot;get&quot; and no punchline.

==Popular culture==
The joke has become widely known and entered popular culture in other forms, including a radio show named &quot;No Soap-Radio!&quot; It has been used as the name for rock bands, as well as a short-lived TV sketch comedy show (&quot;No Soap, Radio&quot;) starring Steve Guttenberg that aired on ABC in spring 1982. No Soap Radio was also the name of a radio commercial production company in New York City formed in 1970, later renamed No Soap Productions.

In the episode of &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, &quot;Homer the Heretic&quot;, a radio is seen hanging in the shower, with a label on it showing the brand of radio to be &quot;No Soap— Radio!&quot;

In &quot;Pie-O-My&quot;, the fifth episode of the fourth season of &quot;The Sopranos&quot;, the name of the band playing at The Crazy Horse is No Soap Radio.

In &quot;Brain Scramblies&quot;, the third episode of the second season of &quot;What We Do in the Shadows (TV series)&quot;, the vampires&#x27; human neighbor Sean exclaims &quot;No soap, Radio!&quot; during an imaginary phone conversation after being &quot;over-hypnotized.&quot;

<text>The Buxaceae are a small family of six genera and about 123 known species of flowering plants. They are shrubs and small trees, with a cosmopolitan distribution. A seventh genus, sometimes accepted in the past (&quot;Notobuxus&quot;), has been shown by genetic studies to be included within &quot;Buxus&quot; (Balthazar &quot;et al.&quot;, 2000).

The family is recognised by most taxonomists, and it is commonly known as the [[Buxus|box]] family. However, its placement and circumscription has varied; some taxonomists treated &quot;Styloceras&quot; in its own family Stylocerataceae, &quot;Didymeles&quot; in its own family Didymelaceae, &quot;Haptanthus&quot; in Haptanthaceae (now all included in Buxaceae)), and formerly &quot;Simmondsia&quot; was included, which is not related and now usually placed in its own family Simmondsiaceae.

The APG II system of 2003 recognises the family, but in a new circumscription in that it includes the genus &quot;Didymeles&quot; (two species of evergreen trees from Madagascar). However, APG II does allow the option of segregating this genus as family Didymelaceae, as an optional segregate. This represents a slight change from the APG system of 1998, which firmly recognised both families as separate. In both APG and APG II, the family Buxaceae is unplaced as to order and left among the basal lineages of the eudicots. The AP website suggests instating the order Buxales for this family and the family Didymelaceae. In the APG IV system of 2016, &quot;Haptanthus&quot; and &quot;Didymeles&quot; are included in Buxaceae, which is the only family in Buxales.

<doc id="918413" wikidata="Q1035022" url="?curid=918413" title="Caproni Ca.4">
<text>The Caproni Ca.4 was an Italian heavy bomber of the World War I era.

==Development==
After designing the successful Ca.3, Gianni Caproni of the Caproni works designed a much bigger aircraft. It shared the unusual layout of the Caproni Ca.3, being a twin-boom aircraft with one pusher engine at the rear of a central nacelle and two tractor engines in front of twin booms, providing a push-pull configuration. The twin booms carried a single elevator and three fins. The main landing gear was fixed and consisted of two sets of four wheels each.

The huge new bomber was accepted by the Italian Army under the military designation Ca.4, but it was produced in several variants, differing in factory designations.

==Description==
The Ca.4 was a three-engine, twin-fuselage triplane of wooden construction with a fabric-covered frame. An open central nacelle was attached to the undersurface of the center wing. It contained a single pusher engine, pilot, and forward gunner. The remaining engines were tractor mounted at the front of each fuselage. At least one variation of the central nacelle seated the crew in a two-seat tandem format with the forward position for a gunner/pilot and the rear position for the pilot. Others used a forward gunner with side-by-side pilot positions to the rear of the gunner. Two rear gunners were positioned, one in each boom behind the center wing. An engineer or second pilot could also be accommodated there.

Armament consisted of four (but up to eight) Revelli 6.5 mm or 7.7 mm machine guns in front ring mounts and two boom ring mounts. Bombs were suspended in a bomb bay, which was a long and narrow container fixed to a lower wing. Photographs show at least four different arrangements with regard to the bombing nacelle.
* 1. No nacelle - presumably not a combat configuration.
* 2. A tall, narrow nacelle that housed approximately 12 internal bombs vertically and another 18–20 strapped to the outside.
* 3. A shorter nacelle that may have been the lower half of the tall nacelle but with no external bombs.
* 4. No nacelle but with a single long bomb/torpedo slung under the bottom wing.

==Variants==

&quot;Note: during the war, all these aircraft were designated Ca.4 by the Italian Army. At the time, Caproni referred to the various designs by the total power of their engines. After the war, Caproni devised a new designation scheme for their own designs—these are used below.&quot;
* Caproni Ca.40 - single prototype.
* Caproni Ca.41 - production variant, essentially similar to the prototype and powered by three Fiat A.12 inline engines of . A few Ca.41s were powered by Isotta Fraschini engines instead. These were referred to internally by Caproni as the Caproni 750 hp. A total of 41 were built.
* Caproni Ca.42 - powered by Liberty V-12 engines and known internally as the Caproni 1,200 hp. 12 built.
* Caproni Ca.43 - single example of a floatplane variant.
* Caproni Ca.48 - Airliners converted from Ca.42s after World War I; the Ca.48 first flew in 1919. The double-deck passenger cabin mounted between the booms seated a total of 23 passengers who entered via the nose nacelle; 16 of them sat in the lower cabin on long benches alongside its walls with large windows providing them with good views, and the other seven passengers sat on an upper deck, as did the pilots. The Ca.48 was powered by three Liberty L-12 engines. Although it is unlikely that the Ca.48 ever entered airline service, a Ca.48 did visit the First Aviation Exhibition Amsterdam of August–September 1919, where it was very popular with visitors, among whom was Prince Hendrick (1876–1934), Prince Consort of the Netherlands (1901–1934).
* Caproni Ca.51 - single example of a considerably enlarged design with biplane tail and tail barbette. Three × Fiat A.14 engines.
* Caproni Ca.52 - Ca.42s built for the RNAS. Six built.
* Caproni Ca.58 / Caproni Cinquemotore A variant of the Ca 48 airliner was built powered by five engines, the outer engines in pusher nacelles. 
* Caproni Ca.59 - as for the Ca.58, but this designation used for customers outside Italy.

Production figures differ in publications. The most likely number is 38 of all Ca.4 variants (other quoted figures are: 38 of Ca.40 and Ca.41 and 6 Ca.42 or 32 Ca.42 and 21 of other variants). Numerous publications incorrectly refer to all variants as the Ca.42.

==Operational history==
Ca.4s were tested by the Italian Air Force in 1917 and began operations in 1918. They were used for attacking targets in Austria-Hungary. In April 1918, six Ca.42s were issued to the British RNAS (No. 227 Sqn) but were never used operationally and were returned to Italy after the war. At least three CA.42s were sent to the United States for evaluation. After the war, the Ca. 4 was replaced in Italy by the Ca.36.

Despite its unstable and fragile appearance, the Ca.4 was well designed. Its size, without regard to its height, was not any larger than that of other foreign heavy bombers. With Liberty engines, it had a fast speed, similar to other heavy bombers, while its bombload had one of the largest capacities of that era, surpassed only by that of the Imperial German Zeppelin-Staaken R.VI. If it had been flown with other engines, its performance would have suffered.

On 2 August 1919, after its wings apparently collapsed in mid-flight at an altitude of , a Ca.48 airliner crashed at Verona, Italy, during a flight from Venice to Taliedo, Milan. All on board died. It was Italy&#x27;s first commercial aviation disaster and one of the earliest heavier-than-air airliner disasters.

A *-representation π of &quot;A&quot; on a Hilbert space &quot;H&quot; is irreducible if, and only if, there is no closed subspace &quot;K&quot; different from &quot;H&quot; and {0} which is invariant under all operators π(&quot;x&quot;) with &quot;x&quot; ∈ &quot;A&quot;. We implicitly assume that irreducible representation means &quot;non-null&quot; irreducible representation, thus excluding trivial (i.e. identically 0) representations on one-dimensional spaces. As explained below, the spectrum &quot;Â&quot; is also naturally a topological space; this is similar to the notion of the spectrum of a ring.

One of the most important applications of this concept is to provide a notion of dual object for any locally compact group. This dual object is suitable for formulating a Fourier transform and a Plancherel theorem for unimodular separable locally compact groups of type I and a decomposition theorem for arbitrary representations of separable locally compact groups of type I. The resulting duality theory for locally compact groups is however much weaker than the Tannaka–Krein duality theory for compact topological groups or Pontryagin duality for locally compact &quot;abelian&quot; groups, both of which are complete invariants. That the dual is not a complete invariant is easily seen as the dual of any finite-dimensional full matrix algebra M&quot;n&quot;(C) consists of a single point.

== Primitive spectrum ==
The topology of &quot;Â&quot; can be defined in several equivalent ways. We first define it in terms of the primitive spectrum .

The primitive spectrum of &quot;A&quot; is the set of primitive ideals Prim(&quot;A&quot;) of &quot;A&quot;, where a primitive ideal is the kernel of a non-zero irreducible *-representation. The set of primitive ideals is a topological space with the hull-kernel topology (or Jacobson topology). This is defined as follows: If &quot;X&quot; is a set of primitive ideals, its hull-kernel closure is

:formula_1

Hull-kernel closure is easily shown to be an idempotent operation, that is

:formula_2

and it can be shown to satisfy the Kuratowski closure axioms. As a consequence, it can be shown that there is a unique topology τ on Prim(&quot;A&quot;) such that the closure of a set &quot;X&quot; with respect to τ is identical to the hull-kernel closure of &quot;X&quot;.

Since unitarily equivalent representations have the same kernel, the map π ↦ ker(π) factors through a surjective map

:formula_3

We use the map &quot;k&quot; to define the topology on &quot;Â&quot; as follows:

Definition. The open sets of &quot;Â&quot; are inverse images &quot;k&quot;−1(&quot;U&quot;) of open subsets &quot;U&quot; of Prim(&quot;A&quot;). This is indeed a topology.

The hull-kernel topology is an analogue for non-commutative rings of the Zariski topology for commutative rings.

The topology on &quot;Â&quot; induced from the hull-kernel topology has other characterizations in terms of states of &quot;A&quot;.

== Examples ==

=== Commutative C*-algebras ===
The spectrum of a commutative C*-algebra &quot;A&quot; coincides with the Gelfand dual of &quot;A&quot; (not to be confused with the dual &quot;A&quot;&#x27; of the Banach space &quot;A&quot;). In particular, suppose &quot;X&quot; is a compact Hausdorff space. Then there is a natural homeomorphism

:formula_4

This mapping is defined by

: formula_5

I(&quot;x&quot;) is a closed maximal ideal in C(&quot;X&quot;) so is in fact primitive. For details of the proof, see the Dixmier reference. For a commutative C*-algebra,

:formula_6

=== The C*-algebra of bounded operators ===
Let &quot;H&quot; be a separable infinite-dimensional Hilbert space. &quot;L&quot;(&quot;H&quot;) has two norm-closed *-ideals: &quot;I&quot;0 = {0} and the ideal &quot;K&quot; = &quot;K&quot;(&quot;H&quot;) of compact operators. Thus as a set, Prim(&quot;L&quot;(&quot;H&quot;)) = {&quot;I&quot;0, &quot;K&quot;}. Now

* {&quot;K&quot;} is a closed subset of Prim(&quot;L&quot;(&quot;H&quot;)).
* The closure of {&quot;I&quot;0} is Prim(&quot;L&quot;(&quot;H&quot;)).

Thus Prim(&quot;L&quot;(&quot;H&quot;)) is a non-Hausdorff space.

The spectrum of &quot;L&quot;(&quot;H&quot;) on the other hand is much larger. There are many inequivalent irreducible representations with kernel &quot;K&quot;(&quot;H&quot;) or with kernel {0}.

=== Finite-dimensional C*-algebras ===
Suppose &quot;A&quot; is a finite-dimensional C*-algebra. It is known &quot;A&quot; is isomorphic to a finite direct sum of full matrix algebras:

:formula_7

where min(&quot;A&quot;) are the minimal central projections of &quot;A&quot;. The spectrum of &quot;A&quot; is canonically isomorphic to min(&quot;A&quot;) with the discrete topology. For finite-dimensional C*-algebras, we also have the isomorphism

:formula_6

== Other characterizations of the spectrum ==
The hull-kernel topology is easy to describe abstractly, but in practice for C*-algebras associated to locally compact topological groups, other characterizations of the topology on the spectrum in terms of positive definite functions are desirable.

In fact, the topology on &quot;Â&quot; is intimately connected with the concept of weak containment of representations as is shown by the following:

:Theorem. Let &quot;S&quot; be a subset of &quot;Â&quot;. Then the following are equivalent for an irreducible representation π;
:# The equivalence class of π in &quot;Â&quot; is in the closure of &quot;S&quot;
:# Every state associated to π, that is one of the form
:::formula_9
::with ||ξ|| = 1, is the weak limit of states associated to representations in &quot;S&quot;.

The second condition means exactly that π is weakly contained in &quot;S&quot;.

The GNS construction is a recipe for associating states of a C*-algebra &quot;A&quot; to representations of &quot;A&quot;. By one of the basic theorems associated to the GNS construction, a state &quot;f&quot; is pure if and only if the associated representation π&quot;f&quot; is irreducible. Moreover, the mapping κ : PureState(&quot;A&quot;) → &quot;Â&quot; defined by &quot;f&quot; ↦ π&quot;f&quot; is a surjective map.

From the previous theorem one can easily prove the following;

:Theorem The mapping
::formula_10
:given by the GNS construction is continuous and open.

=== The space Irr&quot;n&quot;(&quot;A&quot;) ===
There is yet another characterization of the topology on &quot;Â&quot; which arises by considering the space of representations as a topological space with an appropriate pointwise convergence topology. More precisely, let &quot;n&quot; be a cardinal number and let &quot;Hn&quot; be the canonical Hilbert space of dimension &quot;n&quot;.

Irr&quot;n&quot;(&quot;A&quot;) is the space of irreducible *-representations of &quot;A&quot; on &quot;Hn&quot; with the point-weak topology. In terms of convergence of nets, this topology is defined by π&quot;i&quot; → π; if and only if

:formula_11

It turns out that this topology on Irr&quot;n&quot;(&quot;A&quot;) is the same as the point-strong topology, i.e. π&quot;i&quot; → π if and only if

:formula_12

:Theorem. Let &quot;Ân&quot; be the subset of &quot;Â&quot; consisting of equivalence classes of representations whose underlying Hilbert space has dimension &quot;n&quot;. The canonical map Irr&quot;n&quot;(&quot;A&quot;) → &quot;Ân&quot; is continuous and open. In particular, &quot;Ân&quot; can be regarded as the quotient topological space of Irr&quot;n&quot;(&quot;A&quot;) under unitary equivalence.

Remark. The piecing together of the various &quot;Ân&quot; can be quite complicated.

== Mackey–Borel structure ==
&quot;Â&quot; is a topological space and thus can also be regarded as a Borel space. A famous conjecture of G. Mackey proposed that a &quot;separable&quot; locally compact group is of type I if and only if the Borel space is standard, i.e. is isomorphic (in the category of Borel spaces) to the underlying Borel space of a complete separable metric space. Mackey called Borel spaces with this property smooth. This conjecture was proved by James Glimm for separable C*-algebras in the 1961 paper listed in the references below.

Definition. A non-degenerate *-representation π of a separable C*-algebra &quot;A&quot; is a factor representation if and only if the center of the von Neumann algebra generated by π(&quot;A&quot;) is one-dimensional. A C*-algebra &quot;A&quot; is of type I if and only if any separable factor representation of &quot;A&quot; is a finite or countable multiple of an irreducible one.

Examples of separable locally compact groups &quot;G&quot; such that C*(&quot;G&quot;) is of type I are connected (real) nilpotent Lie groups and connected real semi-simple Lie groups. Thus the Heisenberg groups are all of type I. Compact and abelian groups are also of type I.

:Theorem. If &quot;A&quot; is separable, &quot;Â&quot; is smooth if and only if &quot;A&quot; is of type I.

The result implies a far-reaching generalization of the structure of representations of separable type I C*-algebras and correspondingly of separable locally compact groups of type I.

== Algebraic primitive spectra ==

Since a C*-algebra &quot;A&quot; is a ring, we can also consider the set of primitive ideals of &quot;A&quot;, where &quot;A&quot; is regarded algebraically. For a ring an ideal is primitive if and only if it is the annihilator of a simple module. It turns out that for a C*-algebra &quot;A&quot;, an ideal is algebraically primitive if and only if it is primitive in the sense defined above.

:Theorem. Let &quot;A&quot; be a C*-algebra. Any algebraically irreducible representation of &quot;A&quot; on a complex vector space is algebraically equivalent to a topologically irreducible *-representation on a Hilbert space. Topologically irreducible *-representations on a Hilbert space are algebraically isomorphic if and only if they are unitarily equivalent.

This is the Corollary of Theorem 2.9.5 of the Dixmier reference.

If &quot;G&quot; is a locally compact group, the topology on dual space of the group C*-algebra C*(&quot;G&quot;) of &quot;G&quot; is called the Fell topology, named after J. M. G. Fell.

<doc id="918421" wikidata="Q434782" url="?curid=918421" title="Birger, King of Sweden">
<text>Birger Magnusson (1280 – 31 May 1321) was King of Sweden from 1290 to 1318. His reign was marked by unrest and civil strife; he was imprisoned by his brothers Erik and Valdemar following the &quot;Håtuna games&quot; in 1306, but when he tried to play them the same trick in Nyköping, there was an uprising that ended with Birger losing the crown and the execution of his 18-year-old son Magnus.

==Background==
Birger Magnusson was the son of King Magnus Ladulås and Helvig of Holstein. In order to secure the succession, King Magnus had Birger hailed king of Sweden when he was four years old. In 1275, Magnus had led a rebellion against his elder brother, King Valdemar, and ousted him from the throne. Before his death, Magnus ordered his kinsman, Torkel Knutsson, the Constable of the Realm, to be Birger&#x27;s guardian. In 1302, Birger was crowned at Söderköping after marrying Martha of Denmark, the daughter of King Eric V of Denmark.

==Reign==

Birger was only ten years old when his father died, at which time Torkel Knutsson was the most influential statesman in Sweden. In 1293, Torkel Knutsson led the Swedes to a victory which won a part of western Karelia. This expedition has traditionally been dubbed as the Third Swedish Crusade. When Torkel Knutsson returned from leading the crusade in Finland, a feud had developed between the brothers. Torkel Knutsson supported King Birger.

Birger came of age when there was a conflict within the Church of Sweden over interpretation of the Privileges of 1280, which had been the cost of the support of the Church for his father&#x27;s usurpation. The king&#x27;s brothers, dukes Erik and Valdemar, took advantage of this conflict. Duke Erik tried to establish an independent kingdom around Bohuslän, which he had received as part of his marriage to the Norwegian princess Ingeborg, and Halland at the boundary between Sweden, Norway and Denmark. A civil war broke out, but by 1306 emotions had cooled to the point where the dukes acknowledged Birger&#x27;s son, Magnus, as the successor to the throne. Torkel Knutsson, who was Duke Valdemar&#x27;s father-in-law, was executed in 1306 as a token of reconciliation between King Birger and his brothers. The same year, in an event known as the Håtuna games (&quot;Håtunaleken&quot;), Birger was taken captive by his brothers on the Håtuna royal estate in Uppland and taken as prisoner to Nyköping Castle (&quot;Nyköpingshus&quot;).

In 1308, Erik and Valdemar were forced by the Danish king to release King Birger, but they did so under humiliating conditions. When King Birger was free, he sought aid in Denmark, and the strife began anew. Birger remained king in name, but had to give up the Royal Domain, exchanging it for eastern Uppland, Närke, his brother Erik&#x27;s former Duchy Södermanland, Östergötland, Gotland and the Castle of Viborg.

In 1312, Duke Erik married Ingeborg of Norway, daughter of King Haakon V of Norway in a double wedding in Oslo. At the same time, Duke Valdemar married Ingeborg Eriksdottir of Norway, the daughter of King Eric II of Norway.

Duke Erik also held Bohuslän from Norway as well as northern Halland and was creating a separate kingdom centered on Göta älv. In 1317 however, Birger captured his brothers during the Nyköping Banquet (&quot;Nyköpings gästabud&quot;), which led to their death. According to Erik&#x27;s Chronicle (&quot;Erikskrönikan&quot;), the dukes were starved to death in a cellar of Nyköping Castle.

Birger was ousted by his brothers&#x27; supporters in 1318 and eventually went into exile under his brother-in-law King Eric VI of Denmark, taking the Royal Archives with him. His 18-year-old son Magnus had arrived that year with Danish troops to save Birger but an army under Canute Porse defeated them at Söderköping, practically putting an end to the conflict. Birger first fled to Gotland and left Magnus to defend the important Stegeborg Castle. Magnus was captured there only to be executed in Stockholm in 1320, with a younger brother Erik having died the year before and ex-king Birger dying in Denmark the year after. In 1319, the three-year-old son of Duke Erik, also called Magnus, had then already been hailed King of Sweden after the short regency of his mother Duchess Ingeborg.

==Children==
Birger had the following children with Martha:
* Magnus (13001320), executed in Sweden
* Erik (d. 1319), archdeacon in Uppsala; died in exile
* Third son of unknown name
* Agnes (d. after 1344), a nun in Slangerup Abbey
* Katarina (d. after 1320); she accompanied Birger and Martha in exile

==Modern depiction==
In 2003, the band Falconer released &quot;The Sceptre of Deception&quot;, a concept album based on this period of Swedish history. The album covers events during the reign of King Birger of Sweden and lengthy strife with his brothers, and the Danish and Norwegian crowns.

<text>Glk is a portable application programming interface (API) created by Andrew Plotkin for use by programs with a text interface; these programs mostly include interactive fiction (IF) interpreters for Z-machine, TADS, Glulx, and Hugo games, and IF games written in more obscure file formats such as those used by Level 9 Computing and Magnetic Scrolls.

The Glk API specification describes facilities for input, output, text formatting, graphics, sound, and file I/O.

Glk does not describe a virtual machine. Glulx is a virtual machine designed to be implemented using the Glk functions, and Glulxe is an interpreter for Glulx. Interpreters for other virtual machines may use Glk while being unrelated to Glulx: for example, Nitfol is an interpreter for the Z-Machine that uses Glk.

The Glk API has many implementations, including GlkTerm, ScummVM&#x27;s Glk, WindowsGlk, XGlk. Implementations are available on the following platforms:
* Java
* JavaScript
* Macintosh
* DOS
* Unix
** X Window System
* Microsoft Windows
** Pocket PC

The existence of the Glk API has made possible the creation of &quot;universal translator&quot; IF interpreters, programs such as &quot;Gargoyle&quot; and &quot;Spatterlight&quot; which can run all popular IF formats and almost all of the more obscure ones. Such programs are very useful for newcomers to the medium who are unsure of which interpreter to choose, and to experienced players who may possess games in a variety of formats.

<doc id="918435" wikidata="Q927558" url="?curid=918435" title="House of Sverker">
<text>The House of Sverker were a powerful political force in medieval Sweden, contesting for royal power. Their origins were in Östergötland. After the extinction of the House of Stenkil and the ascension of Sverker I of Sweden in 1130, a civil war commenced. In the beginning, there were several pretenders, of whom Sverker I emerged as victorious, for a time. The antagonists in long run were finally the House of Sverker in Östergötland and the House of Eric in Västergötland and Uppland (Saint Eric was killed and buried in the latter province, others in the dynasty were buried in Varnhem Abbey in the former province as later also Birger Jarl was, a relative to the dynasty), which alternated on the throne for several generations, until in the 1220s the Eric dynasty got the upper hand, and the Sverker dynasty became extinct (at least in the male line).

As usual in medieval succession rivalries, the outcome combined the blood of rival lines, as in 1250 Valdemar of the Folkungs (then a minor, his father Birger Jarl acting as regent) ascended the throne, having inherited the Eric dynasty claim from Valdemar&#x27;s mother (who was sister of Eric XI of Sweden, the last Eric-dynast) and some of the Sverker dynasty claim from Birger&#x27;s mother (who was daughter of a younger son of Sverker I).

<doc id="918443" wikidata="Q2236474" url="?curid=918443" title="Uys Krige">
<text>Mattheus Uys Krige (4 February 1910 – 10 August 1987) was a South African writer of novels, short stories, poems and plays in Afrikaans and English. In Afrikaans literature, Krige is counted among the &quot;Dertigers&quot; (&quot;Writers of the Thirties&quot;). Uys Krige was, according to his friend Jack Cope, very much an exception among Afrikaner poets and writers of his generation due to his hostility to extreme Afrikaner nationalism, White Supremacism, and his literary translations of Latin American poetry by non-White authors into Afrikaans; which have had an enormous influence upon South African literature and culture. Later in his life, Krige served as a mentor and father figure to the Afrikaans literary movement known as &quot;die Sestigers&quot;; whom he convinced into speaking truth to power about the 1948–1994 rule of the National Party and its policies of both Apartheid and censorship in South Africa.

==Life==
Uys Krige was born in Bontebokskloof (near Swellendam) in the Cape Province.

Even though the Krige family believed in Afrikaner nationalism, &quot;the home atmosphere was broadminded and creative, his mother was a talented writer and his younger brother a leading painter.&quot;

Uys Krige was educated at the University of Stellenbosch. Like many other Afrikaner young men of his generation, Krige was invited to join the secret society known as the &quot;Broederbond&quot;, &quot;But on discovering its rule of secrecy and the somewhat medieval rites, Krige beat a hasty retreat.&quot;

At the age of 21, Krige left for Europe, where he lived, &quot;on a kind of cheerful vagabondage.&quot; Krige acquired fluency in French and Spanish. Whilst in France he played rugby for a team in Toulon, was a swimming coach on the Côte d&#x27;Azur, wrote poems and penned freelance articles for the Afrikaans press.

From 1931 to 1933, Krige lived at Martigues, in Provence as a tutor to the daughters of Anglo-African poet Roy Campbell and his English aristocrat-turned-bohemian wife, Mary Garman Campbell. The Campbells&#x27; oldest daughter, Anna Campbell, later recalled that Uys Krige replaced a French governess named Anne-Marie, who, &quot;never taught us anything, but drove every night to the casino at Foss to dance&quot;. Anna later recalled, however, that she and her sister Tess, &quot;enjoyed doing our lessons&quot;, with Uys Krige and that, thanks to him, &quot;we made rapid progress. He stayed with us almost two years.&quot;

By the end of 1932, the Pound Sterling had devalued and it had become clear that Krige and the Campbells could no longer afford to live in France. During a discussion with Krige in the spring of 1933, Mary Campbell, &quot;who had read the memoirs of Saint Theresa of Avila when she was six and had a preconceived idea of everything Spanish&quot;, recommended moving to Spain.

According to Anna Campbell Lyle, in 1933, the Barcelona pension where the Campbell family stayed was flooded with German Jews and other anti-Nazi political refugees, who held a traditional German Christmas celebration. At the same party, Uys Krige attended with a Catalan girlfriend and Anna Campbell Lyle danced a &quot;paso-doble&quot; on the table.

Krige returned to South Africa in 1935 and began a writing career as a reporter for the &quot;Rand Daily Mail&quot;.

The Campbells had converted to Roman Catholicism in Altea, Spain and, due to their new faith and to their first hand experiences of the Red Terror by forces loyal to the Second Spanish Republic in Toledo, the Campbells vocally supported the Nationalist faction during the ensuing Spanish Civil War. Meanwhile, Krige campaigned just as passionately for the Republican faction. Despite their views being at variance over the Spanish Civil War, Roy Campbell and Uys Krige remained friends and, in Campbell&#x27;s 1952 memoir, &quot;Light on a Dark Horse&quot;, he explains Krige&#x27;s Republican sympathies by the latter being, &quot;an incurable Calvinist.&quot;

In 1937, Krige married the actor Lydia Lindeque, and they had their first child, Eulalia. During the same year, he wrote the Afrikaans poem, &quot;Lied van die fascistiese bomwerpers&quot; (&quot;Hymn of the Fascist Bombers&quot;). Krige later recalled, &quot;I needed only a line or two, then the poem wrote itself. My hand could hardly keep pace. I did not have to correct anything. Well... that seldom happens to you.&quot; The poem condemned the bombing raids by pro-Nationalist German pilots of the Condor Legion. Inspired, according Jack Cope, by Krige&#x27;s upbringing within Afrikaner Calvinism and its traditional hostility to an allegedly corrupt Pre-Reformation Church, &quot;Lied van die fascistiese bomwerpers&quot; also leveled savage attacks against Roman Catholicism.

According to Jack Cope, &quot;The poem starts on a note of military pride – the eyes of the Fascist pilots fixed on themselves in their joyful and triumphant, their holy task. The tone of bitter irony rises as the pace becomes faster, climbing to height after height of savagery and contempt. The lines of the Latin liturgy become mixed with the brutal exultation of the mercenaries raining down death from their safe altitude. The Bible itself is rolled in the blood. The lovely place-names of Spain rise in gleams above the dust and smoke. In the end the hymn becomes an insane scream of violence and bloody destruction mocking even the Crucifixion.&quot;

As no Afrikaans journal dared to publish it, Uys Krige&#x27;s &quot;Lied van die fascistiese bomwerpers&quot; appeared in the &quot;Forum&quot;, a Left-leaning literary journal published in English. Krige&#x27;s poem elicited vehement condemnations from both extreme Afrikaner nationalists and from the Catholic Church in South Africa, which &quot;protested vehemently&quot; called Krige&#x27;s poem sacrilegious. Krige responded by asking whether South African Catholics approved of the Nationalist&#x27;s dismantling of what he considered the lawful Spanish Government or in the ongoing White Terror.

During World War II, Krige was a war correspondent with the South African Army during the Abyssinian Campaign and the North African Campaign. Captured at the Battle of Tobruk in 1941, he was sent to a POW camp in Fascist Italy from which he escaped after the overthrow of Benito Mussolini two years later. Krige was then smuggled back to Allied lines with the help of the Italian Resistance. Krige returned to South Africa able to speak fluent Italian. Krige subsequently wrote and published the English language war memoir, &quot;The Way Out&quot;, as well as war poetry and short stories.

After the National Party took power over South Africa in 1948, Krige actively campaigned as part of the Torch Commando alongside former RAF flying ace Sailor Malan and many other Afrikaner World War II veterans against the new Government&#x27;s plans to disenfranchise Coloured voters.

In May 1952, Krige had lunch in London with fellow South African dissident writers Roy Campbell, Laurens van der Post, Enslin du Plessis, and Alan Paton. During the lunch, the five men composed and signed an open letter to the South African Government, in which they again denounced the ruling National Party&#x27;s plans to disenfranchise Coloured voters. The letter was subsequently published by several South African newspapers.

In 1958, Krige, in spite of or because of his opposition to the National Party-dominated Government, was awarded an honorary doctorate by the University of Natal.

Beginning during the late 1950s and &#x27;60s, Krige served as a mentor to many fellow members of Cape Town&#x27;s racially mixed literary bohemia, which gathered in the beach-side suburb of Clifton. Due in large part to Krige&#x27;s influence, membership in both literary bohemia and in the literary movement known as &quot;Die Sestigers&quot; (&quot;The Writers of the Sixties&quot;) became synonymous with public opposition to both the National Party and Apartheid.

The most famous of Krige&#x27;s proteges was Ingrid Jonker and Krige played a major role in Jonker&#x27;s transformation from the dutiful daughter of a National Party MP into a vocal critic of the National Party&#x27;s policies of censorship and apartheid. When Jonker committed suicide by drowning in 1965, Krige spoke at her secular funeral.

Uys Krige also co-edited &quot;The Penguin Book of South African Verse&quot; (1968) with Jack Cope.

In an interview later in life, Krige told Jack Cope, &quot;One of the biggest mistakes is to identify the Afrikaans language with the Nationalist Party.&quot;

Uys Krige died near Hermanus in the Cape Province in 1987, aged 77.

==Poetry==
According to Uys Krige&#x27;s friend Jack Cope, &quot;He was essentially a lyric poet, his subjects personal, often romantic, sentimental; his technique despite a full acquaintance with Dada, Surrealism and other schools remained traditional, helped along with homely anecdotes and plentiful rhyme. He enjoyed the resonance and timbre of words and liked to exploit the nuances of his language as against the precision of French and Spanish with its darker more sensuous tones.&quot;

===Literary translations===
According to Jack Cope, Krige&#x27;s linguistic and literary talent combined with his passion for French, Spanish, Italian and Portuguese literature made him the principal translator from Romance languages into Afrikaans during the 20th century.

Uys Krige translated many of the works of William Shakespeare from Elizabethan English into Afrikaans. He also translated works by Federico García Lorca, Pablo Neruda, Lope de Vega and Juan Ramón Jiménez from Spanish, works by Baudelaire, François Villon, Jacques Prévert, Arthur Rimbaud, and Paul Éluard from French, and &quot;scores of poems&quot; by anti-Mussolini Italian poets Salvatore Quasimodo and Giuseppe Ungaretti, with whom Krige struck up a friendship.

Krige&#x27;s encounter with Latin American poetry while stationed in Cairo during World War II also led him to translate the poetry of Jacinto Fombona-Pachano, Jose Ramon Heredia, Vicente Huidobro, Jorge Carrera Andrade, Nicolas Guillen, Cesar Vallejo, Jorge de Lima and Manuel Bandeira into Afrikaans from both Spanish and Portuguese.

Jack Cope has written of Krige&#x27;s translations of Latin American verse, &quot;This important body of modern poetry, steeped in humanist tradition, non-racial to the extent that much of it was written by poets of Black, Indian, and mixed races, has had a considerable influence on South African writing, both in Afrikaans and English. English-language poets of the country such as Dan Jacobson and Charles Eglington have agreed that Krige&#x27;s versions are in nearly every instance closer in spirit and tone to the originals than those yet achieved in English either in Britain or the United States. This says much for the translator/poet but also for the language he is using, which is able to capture more unaffectedly the warmth, softness, and resonance of Latin tongues.&quot;

==Legacy==
In 1994, Uys Krige&#x27;s granddaughter, Lida Orffer was murdered with her family at their home in Stellenbosch. The murderer was found to be a Black South African drifter whom the Orffer family had given his first real job. The murder of the Orffer family, which came within weeks of the free elections that toppled the ruling National Party and ended apartheid, horrified the town of Stellenbosch and made many local residents question whether Nelson Mandela&#x27;s promise of a &quot;rainbow nation&quot; was truly possible.

In 2010, a collection of Uys Krige&#x27;s letters from France and Spain was published by Hemel &amp; See Boeke under the title &quot;Briewe van Uys Krige uit Frankryk en Spanje&quot;.

In celebration of the centenary of Krige&#x27;s birth in 2010, South African composer Hendrik Hofmeyr was commissioned to compose a song cycle based on his poetry. The cycle &quot;Ek maak &#x27;n hek oop in my hart&quot; was first performed in that year.

==In popular culture==
* As of 2007, work was underway on an Ingrid Jonker biographical film under the title &quot;All that Breaks&quot;. Based on a screenplay by Helena Nogueira tested at Johannesburg&#x27;s Market Theatre, the film was to focus on three years in Jonker&#x27;s life and on her involvement with the literary bohemia which gathered around Uys Krige in the Cape Town suburb of Clifton. The film was to be produced by David Parfitt (&quot;Shakespeare in Love&quot;), Charles Moore, and Shan Moodley and to be directed by Nogueira.
*In the 2011 Ingrid Jonker biographical film &quot;Black Butterflies&quot;, Uys Krige is portrayed by actor Graham Clarke.

<text>Anselme Gaëtan Desmarest (6 March 1784 – 4 June 1838) was a French zoologist and author. He was the son of Nicolas Desmarest and the father of Eugène Anselme Sébastien Léon Desmarest. 

==Career==
Desmarest was a disciple of Georges Cuvier and Alexandre Brongniart, and in 1815, he succeeded Pierre André Latreille to the professorship of zoology at the &quot;&quot;. He was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 1819 and to the Académie Nationale de Médecine in 1820.

==Publications==
Desmarest published &#x27; (1805), &#x27; (1825), &#x27; (1820), and &#x27; (1816–30, with André Marie Constant Duméril). His &quot;Mammalogie&quot; was significant as it contained a comprehensive list of all mammals known at the time, including living forms and extinct forms known only from fossils. Desmarest was one of the first scientists to routinely apply both genus and species names to animals. Prior to his time, it was common practice to give only a genus name to a new animal.

==Legacy==
The common name, Desmarest&#x27;s hutia, honors Anselme Gaëtan Desmarest, who described the species in 1822 under the synonym &quot;fourniere&quot;.

The brown algae &quot;Desmarestia&quot; is named in honour of Desmarest, as well as the family (Desmarestiaceae) — and in turn, the order (Desmarestiales) — of which the genus is the type species.

<text>Toxorhynchites, also called elephant mosquito or mosquito eater, is a genus of diurnal and often relatively colorful mosquitoes, found worldwide between about 35° north and 35° south. Most species occur in forests. It includes the largest known species of mosquito, at up to in length and in wingspan. It is among the many kinds of mosquito that do not consume blood. The adults subsist on carbohydrate-rich materials, such as honeydew, or saps and juices from damaged plants, refuse, fruit, and nectar.

Mating in mid-air, males and females synchronize their wing beats to the same frequency. Eggs are deposited by flinging them onto water surfaces while hovering. They are either white or yellow in color, with an incubation period of 40–60 hours depending on the temperature. The older the female mosquito, the less likely the eggs will be healthy.

In contrast to blood-sucking species of mosquitoes, their larvae prey on the larvae of other mosquitoes and similar nektonic prey, making &quot;Toxorhynchites&quot; beneficial to humans. Living on this protein and fat rich diet, females have no need to risk their lives sucking blood in adulthood, having already accumulated the necessary materials for oogenesis and vitellogenesis. The larvae of one jungle variety, &quot;Toxorhynchites splendens&quot;, consume larvae of other mosquito species occurring in tree crevices, particularly &quot;Aedes aegypti&quot;.

Environmental scientists have suggested that &quot;Toxorhynchites&quot; mosquitoes be introduced to areas outside their natural range in order to fight dengue fever. This has been practiced historically, but errors have been made. For example, when intending to introduce &quot;T. splendens&quot; to new areas, scientists actually introduced &quot;T. amboinensis&quot;.

An extinct species &quot;T. mexicanus&quot; is known from Miocene aged Mexican Amber.

<text>Plymouth Church is an historic church located at 57 Orange Street between Henry and Hicks Streets in the Brooklyn Heights neighborhood of Brooklyn, New York City; the Church House has the address 75 Hicks Street. The church was built in 1849–50 and was designed by Joseph C. Wells. Under the leadership of its first minister, Henry Ward Beecher, it became the foremost center of anti-slavery sentiment in the mid-19th century. It has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places since 1961, and has been a National Historic Landmark since 1966. It is part of the Brooklyn Heights Historic District, created by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission in 1965.

The church is a member of the National Association of Congregational Christian Churches.

==History==
Plymouth Church was founded in 1847 by 21 transplanted New Englanders, who were part of a circle centered on the wealthy evangelical merchants Arthur and Lewis Tappan. Among them were noted businessmen such as Henry C. Bowen, John Tasker Howard, David Hale, and Seth Hunt. It was the third Congregationalist church to be organized in Brooklyn – then a separate city from New York. The site where the church building would be located was purchased from the First Presbyterian Church, which had been worshipping there since 1822, but which needed more space. It moved to a new site on Henry Street, a few blocks away.

Plymouth Church&#x27;s first pastor was Henry Ward Beecher, who became a leading figure in the abolitionist movement. His sister was Harriet Beecher Stowe, noted today as the author of the anti-slavery novel &quot;Uncle Tom&#x27;s Cabin&quot; (1852) that &quot;helped lay the groundwork for the Civil War.&quot; The church itself became an important station on the Underground Railroad through which slaves from the South were secretly transported to Canada. Locally known as &quot;the Grand Central Depot,&quot; slaves were hidden in the tunnel-like basement beneath the church sanctuary. The Rev. Charles B. Ray, an African-American living in Manhattan, and the founding editor of &quot;The Colored American&quot; newspaper, was quoted as saying, &quot;I regularly drop off fugitives at Henry Ward Beecher&#x27;s Plymouth Church in Brooklyn.&quot; Plymouth Church is one of the few active Underground Railroad congregations in New York still housed in its original location.

One of the main recurring events that garnered considerable public attention were Beecher&#x27;s mock slave auctions. Imitating events like this in the South, Beecher would bring slaves into the sanctuary, auction them off to the highest bidder, and then set them free. The most famous case involved &quot;Pinky&quot;, a 9-year-old slave girl who had escaped from Alabama. On February 5, 1860, in front of a crowd of 3000, Beecher started the bidding and a collection plate was passed around the congregation. When the plate with $900 and a golden ring reached the pulpit, Beecher picked up the ring and placed it on the finger of Pinky. He exclaimed, &quot;Remember, with this ring I do wed thee to freedom.&quot; Sixty-seven years later, Pinky returned to Plymouth, now a well-educated woman named Rose Ward Hunt, and returned the ring Beecher had given to her.

In October 1859, the church offered Abraham Lincoln $200 for coming to Brooklyn and giving a lecture to the congregation. Lincoln accepted the invitation, traveled to Brooklyn and participated in church services on Sunday, February 26. Today a plaque marks the pew where Lincoln attended the service. Because of high demand, Lincoln&#x27;s address was moved to Cooper Union, where a 25-cent admission fee was charged. Lincoln gave his famous anti-slavery speech before a capacity crowd of 1,500 on February 27, 1860, more than eight months before he was elected President.

In 1867, a group from Plymouth Church undertook a five-and-a-half month voyage aboard the steamer Quaker City to Europe and the Holy Land. Joining them as a journalist was the young Mark Twain. His satiric account of this pioneering tour group, &quot;The Innocents Abroad&quot;, was Twain&#x27;s best-selling work throughout his lifetime.

In 1875, a history of rumored extramarital affairs by Beecher and his condemnation from the pulpit of Victoria Woodhull&#x27;s advocacy of free love among other factors culminated in the &quot;Beecher-Tilton Scandal Case&quot;. The highly publicized two-and-a-half-year-long case resulted in the disfellowshiping of aggrieved husband and church member Theodore Tilton, legal and church exoneration of the pastor, and condemnation of him by Elizabeth Cady Stanton and others including his younger half-sister Isabella Beecher Hooker.

Beecher died suddenly in 1887. He was succeeded by Lyman Abbott (1887-1899), a lawyer turned minister and religious journalist; Newell Dwight Hillis (1899-1924), who oversaw the completion of the Plymouth campus as it exists today; J. Stanley Durkee (1926-1940), a former President of Howard University; L. Wendell Fifield (1941-1955), a pastor of Seattle&#x27;s Plymouth Congregational Church widely known for his active role in civic affairs throughout the Pacific Northwest; and the Rev. Harry H. Kruener (1960-1984), Dean of the chapel at Denison University. In 1991, the Rev. Sharon Blackburn, who had served as associate pastor of the First Presbyterian Church, located a few blocks from Plymouth Church, became the first female minister in the church&#x27;s history, following the short tenures of the Rev. Frank Goodwin (1985–88) and the Rev. Richard Stanger (1988-1991).

In addition to Lincoln and Twain many other famous writers and activists spoke at Plymouth, including William Lloyd Garrison, Wendell Phillips, Charles Sumner, John Greenleaf Whittier, Clara Barton, Charles Dickens, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Horace Greeley, and William Thackery. More recently, in February 1963, Martin Luther King Jr. preached a sermon on &quot;The American Dream,&quot; echoed just months later in his famous &quot;I Have a Dream&quot; speech at the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, DC. Senator Hillary Clinton spoke at Plymouth in 2001, and two noted minimalist composers, Philip Glass and Charlemagne Palestine, gave concerts using Plymouth&#x27;s Aeolian-Skinner organ.

Plymouth Church merged with the Congregational Church of the Pilgrims in 1934, and the resulting combined congregation was named &quot;Plymouth Church of the Pilgrims&quot;. The Congregational Church of the Pilgrims left its Richard Upjohn-designed church building, which later was designated a New York City Landmark as Our Lady of Lebanon Maronite Catholic Church. The building&#x27;s stained-glass windows, including windows by Louis Comfort Tiffany and Tiffany Studios, were moved to Plymouth Church&#x27;s nearby Hillis Hall. The church also displays a piece of Plymouth Rock, from the traditional landing site of the &quot;Mayflower&quot; Pilgrims.

In 1958, the congregation voted against becoming part of the newly formed United Church of Christ, which came about through a merger of the Congregational Christian Churches and the Evangelical and Reformed Church; it is now a member of the National Association of Congregational Christian Churches. The church reverted to its original name, &quot;Plymouth Church&quot;, in September, 2011.

Today the congregation consists of about 425 members who form a covenant community. That means each member is bound to God and to every other member of the community by a solemn vow. Plymouth adapted the Salem (Massachusetts) Covenant of 1629. The church has used the Kansas City Statement of Faith as its own since its adoption by the Congregational Christian Churches in 1913. As a congregational church, each member is empowered to participate in the decision-making of the congregation. The church is actively supporting various anti-human-trafficking groups, the Mission School of Hope in Eastern Cameroon, Habitat for Humanity, the Hope Program, and Brooklyn anti-hunger initiatives.

On April 17, 2016, it was announced that the Rev. Brett Younger will be the 11th settled senior minister in Plymouth&#x27;s 169-year history. He succeeds the Rev. David C. Fisher who retired in September 2013, after leading the Plymouth congregation for 9 years.

==Architecture==
Built in 1849–50, Plymouth Church is an example of 19th century urban tabernacle architecture with italianate and colonial motifs. Its layout, influenced by the Broadway Tabernacle in Manhattan, was designed by Joseph C. Wells – who was later one of the founders of the American Institute of Architects. The barn-like church building, with its pews arranged in an arc before the pulpit, resemble more an auditorium or theater than what had traditionally been considered a church. This open design was adopted by many evangelical Protestant churches throughout the United States in the second half of the 19th century.

In 1866, the church&#x27;s original pipe organ was replaced by E. and G. G. Hook, which installed what was then the largest organ in the United States, expanded further by Aeolian-Skinner in 1937.

In 1907–09, the church installed stained-glass windows by the noted J&amp;R Lamb Studios. This studio opened it doors in 1857 and is now the oldest existing studio of its kind in the US. The windows in Plymouth Church are unique in that they do not depict any biblical scenes. Instead they focus on the history of democracy in England and the US, with a particular emphasis on the influence of the Puritans, Pilgrims and Congregational Churches. In 1913 the family of John Arbuckle, a coffee merchant, donated money to create a large garden and the Classic revival parish house. The house and arcade which adjoin the building were designed by Woodruff Leeming.

The church garden, fronting on Orange Street and located between the Church House and the Sanctuary, contains a statue of Beecher and a bas-relief of Lincoln. Both were produced by famed sculptor Gutzon Borglum, who later created the Mount Rushmore National Memorial. An almost identical statue of Beecher is located less than a mile away, next to Cadman Plaza, in front of Brooklyn&#x27;s historic Federal Building and Post Office.

The church was added to the National Register of Historic Places on July 4, 1961, and was named a National Historic Landmark on October 15, 1966. It is located within the Brooklyn Heights Historic District, designated on November 23, 1965, by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission.

Tours of the church, including its grounds, the Sanctuary, Hillis Hall, and the original Underground Railroad facilities, are available upon request. From 2000 to 2015, these tours were given by Lois Rosebrooks, the long-time director of history ministry services.

<doc id="918517" wikidata="Q3132951" url="?curid=918517" title="Henry Matthews, 1st Viscount Llandaff">
<text>Henry Matthews, 1st Viscount Llandaff, (13 January 1826 – 3 April 1913) was an English lawyer and Conservative politician. He is best remembered for his role in the 1885 Sir Charles Dilke divorce trial and for his tenure as Home Secretary from 1886 to 1892.

==Background and education==
The member of an old Herefordshire family, Matthews was born in Ceylon, where his father, Henry Matthews (1789–1828), was a puisne judge of the Supreme Court. His grandfather John Matthews had represented Herefordshire in Parliament in the early years of the 19th century. His mother was Emma (d. 1861), daughter of William Blount. Matthews was educated at the University of Paris, graduating in 1844, before going on to study at the University of London, from which he graduated successively BA and LLB.

==Legal career==
Matthews was called to the Bar, Lincoln&#x27;s Inn, in 1850 and practised on the Oxford circuit before becoming secretary to the Earl Marshal in 1864, a position he held for five years. He was made a Queen&#x27;s Counsel in 1868. At the bar, Matthews made a good name for himself, being especially noted for examination of witnesses. Most famous was his 1885 cross examination of Sir Charles Dilke in a sensational divorce case, which essentially destroyed Dilke&#x27;s political career and launched that of Matthews.

==Political career==
In 1868 Matthews was elected Member of Parliament for Dungarvan. He described himself as an &#x27;Independent Liberal and Conservative&#x27;. He was a Roman Catholic and supported the disestablishment of the Church of Ireland and was vaguely sympathetic to the Home Rule movement, but this could not prevent his defeat by a Home Rule candidate in the 1874 General Election. He then revised his views on politics and revived his political career as a Conservative in Britain, but in the circumstances of the struggle over Gladstone&#x27;s Home Rule Bill, his previous position meant that he was distrusted by strong Unionists.

He returned to Parliament as Conservative member for Birmingham East in 1886, and was immediately appointed as Home Secretary in Lord Salisbury&#x27;s second government. Queen Victoria reportedly demanded his inclusion after his performance in the Sir Charles Dilke divorce trial, which she approved of. He was sworn of the Privy Council at the same time.

Matthews&#x27; tenure of the office was notable more for its administrative success than for political achievement. He was thought &#x27;too clever&#x27; and his aloof and &#x27;somewhat foreign&#x27; manner made it difficult for him to command the House of Commons. In 1887, he gave a seemingly flippant response in the House to a genuine question about the mistaken arrest of Miss Cass, who was accused of prostitution, which resulted in the government&#x27;s defeat on the issue. Despite his personal opposition to capital punishment Matthews was criticised for allowing Israel Lipski to hang. He was Home Secretary throughout the Whitechapel Murders of 1888 to 1891, some of which are attributed to Jack the Ripper.

Matthews continued as Home Secretary until the Liberals returned to power in 1892. When the Conservatives took power again in 1895, Victoria was again keen for him to take office but opposition within the Conservative Party prevented it. Instead he was ennobled as Viscount Llandaff of Hereford in the County of Hereford. He was closely associated with the campaign which resulted in the building of Westminster Cathedral.

==Personal life==
Matthews inherited property from several relatives, which left him financially independent. Indeed, upon his death his estate was valued at almost £260,000. 

He died unmarried in 1913 at the age of 87 at his London home and was buried at Clehonger, Herefordshire, near Belmont Abbey. The viscountcy died with him.

<doc id="918529" wikidata="Q7679872" url="?curid=918529" title="Talking to a Stranger">
<text>Talking to a Stranger (1966) is a British television drama, written by John Hopkins for the BBC, which consists of four separate plays recounting the events of one weekend from the viewpoints of four members of the same family. The play cycle was directed by Christopher Morahan and produced by Michael Bakewell and first shown in the &quot;Theatre 625&quot; series on BBC 2.

Unlike many 1960s BBC productions, the series survived intact, and has been rebroadcast and released on home media.

==Episodes==
The four episodes were individually subtitled &quot;Anytime You&#x27;re Ready I&#x27;ll Sparkle&quot;, &quot;No Skill or Special Knowledge is Required&quot;, &quot;Gladly, My Cross-Eyed Bear&quot; and &quot;The Innocent Must Suffer&quot;. They were respectively the stories of the daughter, Terry; the father, Ted; the son, Alan and the mother, Sarah. Her viewpoint is recounted after her suicide. The role of the daughter Terry provided a major early role for Judi Dench in one of her first starring roles on television. The other leads were played by Maurice Denham, Margery Mason and Michael Bryant.

According to Hopkins, he was seven months late delivering the scripts and, when he was commissioned by the BBC, all he had in his head was the final line of the final play: &quot;Somebody hold me.&quot;

==Reception and awards==
Frequently hailed by critics as one of the most important and affecting television dramas of the 1960s, in a 2000 poll of industry professionals conducted by the British Film Institute to determine the 100 Greatest British Television Programmes of the 20th century, it was placed seventy-eighth.

&quot;The Observer&quot; TV critic George Melly called it &quot;the first authentic masterpiece written directly for television&quot; and claimed that &quot;on the evidence of this work alone, the medium can be considered to have come of age.&quot;

Dench won the 1967 British Academy Television Award for Best Actress for her performance.

==Broadcast==
Originally transmitted on BBC2 as part of the &quot;Theatre 625&quot; anthology strand, the four instalments were shown weekly from 2 to 23 October 1966. The first three plays ran 96 minutes and the final play 102 minutes.

It was repeated as part of BBC2&#x27;s twenty-fifth anniversary celebrations in 1989, allegedly because writer Alan Bleasdale refused to allow his 1982 drama &quot;Boys from the Blackstuff&quot; to be re-shown unless &quot;Talking to a Stranger&quot; also featured as part of the celebratory season. It was screened again by the BBC in 2003, this time on the digital channel BBC Four.

==International adaptations==
&quot;Talking to a Stranger&quot; was remade thrice, once for Canadian television in 1971 and twice for Belgian television. The version for the Belgian Flemish television, &quot;Praten tegen een vreemde&quot;, was adapted by Pieter De Prins and directed by Lode Hendrickx (1969). Paul Roland was the director of &quot;Comme des étrangers&quot; for the Belgian French television.

===Canadian===
The Canadian version, produced by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, was adapted by Doris Gauntlett and starred Budd Knapp (the father), Douglas Rain (Alan), Martha Henry (Terry) and Norma Renault (the mother). This was produced by Eric Till as four-hour-long episodes and broadcast on Wednesdays at 10:00 p.m. (Eastern) from 24 November to 15 December 1971.

The episodes of the Canadian adaptation are structured as follows:

# Terry faces pregnancy while estranged from her husband
# Terry&#x27;s mother commits suicide, as seen through the viewpoint of her husband
# The family faces the aftermath of the suicide, under the viewpoint of Terry&#x27;s brother Alan
# The final episode recounts the first, under the viewpoint of the mother

==Video releases==
The original production is included in &quot;The Judi Dench Collection&quot; boxset which has been issued in both Region 1 and Region 2 DVD versions.

<doc id="918530" wikidata="Q12190384" url="?curid=918530" title="Moran (surname)">
<text>Moran () is a modern Irish surname derived from membership of a medieval dynastic sept. The name means a descendant of &quot;Mórán&quot;. “Mor” in Gaelic translates as big or great and “an” as the prefix the. Morans were a respected sept of the Uí Fiachrach dynasty in the western counties of Mayo and Sligo. In Ireland, where the name descended from the Gaelic, it is generally pronounced anglicised approximate of the Irish pronunciation.

Elsewhere, pronunciation follows the French surname, &quot;Morant&quot;, anglicised to or . There are many different crests of Moran, many bearing three stars and the motto &quot;Lucent in tenebris&quot;, Latin for &quot;They shine in darkness&quot;. Another crest, attributed to the family of a Moran family living in Ballina, County Mayo, is described thus: &quot;Azure on a mount proper, two lions combatant or, holding between them a flagstaff also proper, therefrom a flag argent; a crest: out of amural crown, a demi-saracen, head in profile, all proper; and a motto: &#x27;Fides non timet.&#x27; (This motto translates as &quot;Faith does not fear&quot; or &quot;The faithful one fears not&quot;.)

The majority of bearers of this surname in County Mayo are descended from the &quot;Ó Móráin&quot; sept whose ancient kingdom was in north Mayo, surrounding the modern town of Ballina. Following the Norman invasion, their territory was usurped by the Barretts and Burkes and the sept lost its central organisation. The modern distribution of the surname within Mayo suggests that the Morans spread southwards and today are chiefly found in the central area of the county, particularly in the barony of Carra.

The majority of bearers of this surname in County Leitrim are descended from the &quot;Ó Móráin&quot; sept of the &quot;Muintir Eolais&quot;, and more specifically the &quot;Conmhaicne&quot; of &quot;Maigh Nissi&quot;, who lived along the River Shannon.

<doc id="918538" wikidata="Q1123462" url="?curid=918538" title="ConTeXt">
<text>ConTeXt is a general-purpose document processor. Like LaTeX, it is derived from TeX. It is especially suited for structured documents, automated document production, very fine typography, and multilingual typesetting. It is based in part on the TeX typesetting system, and uses a document markup language for manuscript preparation. The typographical and automated capabilities of ConTeXt are extensive, including interfaces for handling microtypography, multiple footnotes and footnote classes, and manipulating OpenType fonts and features. Moreover, it offers extensive support for colors, backgrounds, hyperlinks, presentations, figure-text integration, and conditional compilation. It gives the user extensive control over formatting while making it easy to create new layouts and styles without learning the low-level TeX macro language.

While comparisons can be made between ConTeXt and LaTeX, the primary objectives of the two systems are distinct. From the onset, ConTeXt has been a typography and typesetting system designed to give users straightforward and consistent access to advanced typographical control, which is crucial for general-purpose typesetting. LaTeX&#x27;s original vision, on the other hand, was to insulate the user from typographical decisions—an approach particularly useful for tasks such as submitting articles to a scientific journal. Although LaTeX has evolved from this original vision, ConTeXt&#x27;s unified design prevents the package clashes often experienced with LaTeX.

ConTeXt provides a multilingual user interface with support for markup in English, Dutch, German, French, and Italian and support for output in many scripts including western European, eastern European, Arabic, Chinese, Japanese, and Korean. It also allows the user to use different TeX engines like LuaTeX (MkIV) and LuaMetaTeX (LMTX). Older versions (MkII) worked with pdfTeX or XeTeX.

As its native drawing engine, ConTeXt integrates a superset of MetaPost called MetaFun, which allows users to draw page backgrounds and ornaments with MetaPost. MetaFun can also be used directly with MetaPost. ConTeXt also supports the use of other external drawing engines, like PGF/TikZ and PSTricks.

ConTeXt also provides a macro package for typesetting chemical structure diagrams with TeX called PPCHTeX, as well as many other modules. This package can also be used with plain TeX and LaTeX.

Originally entitled pragmatex, ConTeXt was given its name around 1996 by Hans Hagen from PRAGMA Advanced Document Engineering (Pragma ADE), a Netherlands-based company.

== License ==

ConTeXt is free software: the program code (i.e. anything not under the codice_1 subtree) is distributed under the GNU GPL; the documentation is provided under Creative Commons Attribution NonCommercial ShareAlike license.

The ConTeXt official manual(2001) and ConTeXt official mini tutorial (1999) are documents copyrighted by Pragma, but there is a repository of the future new manual released under the GNU Free Documentation License. As of April 2009 there is an up-to-date version of the fonts and typography chapters.

== Versions ==

The current version of ConTeXt is LMTX, introduced in April 2019 as the successor to Mark IV (MkIV). Previous versions — Mark II (MkII) and Mark I — are no longer maintained.

According to the developers, the principal difference between LMTX and its predecessors is that the newest version &quot;uses a compilation and scripting engine that is specifically developed with ConTeXt in mind: LuaMetaTeX ... [which] has been optimised heavily for ConTeXt use.&quot; Previously, MkIV used LuaTeX and MkII used pdfTeX.

== History ==
ConTeXt was created by Hans Hagen and Ton Otten of Pragma ADE in the Netherlands around 1991 due to the need for educational typesetting material.

Around 1996, Hans Hagen coined the name ConTeXt meaning &quot;text with tex&quot; (con-tex-t; &quot;con&quot; is a Latin preposition meaning &quot;together with&quot;). Before 1996 ConTeXt was used only within Pragma ADE, but in 1996 it began to be adopted by a wider audience. The first users outside Pragma were Taco Hoekwater, Berend de Boer and Gilbert van den Dobbelsteen, and the first user outside the Netherlands was Tobias Burnus.

In July 2004, contextgarden.net wiki page was created.

ConTeXt low-level code was originally written in Dutch. Around 2005, the ConTeXt developers began translating this to English, resulting in the version known as MKII, which is now stable and frozen.

In August 2007, Hans Hagen presented the MKIV version, and the first public beta was released later that year.

During the ConTeXt User Meeting 2008, Mojca Miklavec presented ConTeXt Minimals, a distribution of ConTeXt containing the latest binaries and intended to have a small memory footprint, thus demanding less bandwidth for updates. In August 2008, this distribution was registered as a project in launchpad web site.

In June 2008, Patrick Gundlach wrote the first post in ConTeXt blog.

In July 2009, ConTeXt started git repository.

In November 2010, the ConTeXt Group was created.

In April 2019, LMTX (ConTeXt LuaMetaTeX) was announced.

==Example of code==
Making ConTeXt documents is simple: one makes a plain text file, and compiles it with the codice_2 script. The result of this process is a PDF file (ConTeXt also can generate a DVI file). An example is shown below.

ConTeXt documents come with the file extension .tex or an extension demarking the version required: codice_3, codice_4, or codice_5 for regular TeX, codice_6 or codice_7 for a dialect that supports named macro parameters in addition to TeX’s numeric ones.

<text>Hanover College is a private college in Hanover, Indiana, affiliated with the Presbyterian Church (USA). Founded in 1827 by Reverend John Finley Crowe, it is Indiana&#x27;s oldest private college. The Hanover athletic teams participate in the NCAA Division III as a member of the Heartland Collegiate Athletic Conference. Hanover alumni are known as Hanoverians.

==History==
===Founding===

In the early 19th century, missionaries went to Hanover as part of the Second Great Awakening. Crowe served as pastor of the Hanover Presbyterian Church. He opened the Hanover Academy on January 1, 1827, in a small log cabin near his home. Two years later, the state of Indiana granted the academy a charter. On November 9, 1829, the academy&#x27;s Board of Trustees accepted the Presbyterian Synod of Indiana&#x27;s proposal to adopt the school, provided a theological department was established.

A two-story brick building was constructed to house both the academy and the new Indiana Seminary. The state of Indiana issued the academy a new charter, creating Hanover College effective January 1, 1833. Under this charter, the college&#x27;s board of trustees is independent of ecclesiastical control, but it has formally adopted the standards for Presbyterian colleges for Hanover. The association continues to this day.

In the 1830s, the College Edifice (now serving as the Hanover Presbyterian Church) was the center of a bustling, campus. In 1834, 119 students attended Hanover Preparatory School (formerly Hanover Academy) and 101 students attended Hanover College, rapid growth from the six students of only seven years earlier.

In 1843 the college&#x27;s president and its trustees accepted a proposal from Madison city leaders to move Hanover College. The trustees dissolved the Hanover charter and established Madison University five miles east. But Crowe purchased the college property and established the Hanover Classical and Mathematical School. Four months after Madison University was founded, its president had resigned while its students began to return to Crowe&#x27;s school. By May 1844, all of Madison&#x27;s students and faculty had made the trip.

Hanover College was officially restored when Indiana&#x27;s legislature granted the college a new charter on Christmas Day. Crowe, who served as college faculty for more than 30 years and refused to have his name considered for the presidency, is described as &quot;twice the founder of Hanover College.&quot;

In 1849 the board of trustees voted to purchase a farm one-half mile east of Hanover&#x27;s campus. This land, overlooking the Ohio River, serves as the campus&#x27;s centerpiece today. By the mid-1850s, Classic Hall was constructed on a bluff known as the Point, and College classes were moved to that location. &quot;Old Classic&quot; would be Hanover&#x27;s signature building for more than 90 years.

The Civil War, especially the Confederate maneuvers known as Morgan&#x27;s Raid, came close to campus; faculty and students were alerted that the troops might try to burn Classic Hall.

In 1870, Presbyterian Church officials proposed that Hanover College be merged with Wabash College, with Hanover becoming a women&#x27;s school. The Hanover Board of Trustees rejected that proposal, as well as one from businessmen in 1873 that would have moved the college to Indianapolis and renamed it Johnson University.

In 1880, Hanover began enrolling women.

===20th century===
During Hanover College&#x27;s first 50 years of operations, it had nine presidents, none of whom served for longer than nine years; five served three years or less. But after that, conditions stabilized. Daniel Fisher led Hanover from 1879 until his retirement in 1907. This stability of leadership ushered in a new era of growth. Fisher oversaw the construction of five buildings, including Thomas A. Hendricks Library (now Hendricks Hall). Named for Thomas Hendricks, an alumnus and former U.S. vice president, it is now used for classes and is known as Hendricks Hall, the oldest classroom building on Hanover&#x27;s campus.

Albert G. Parker Jr. was inaugurated as Hanover&#x27;s 12th president November 27, 1929, less than one month after the stock market crash that precipitated the Great Depression. The economic hard times cut investment revenues and operational expenses had to be closely monitored. But this challenge provided the college with one of its greatest rewards.

On December 7, 1941, the attack on Pearl Harbor plunged the United States into World War II. In just two years, Hanover&#x27;s enrollment plummeted to 164 students, including only 20 men. In the early morning of December 19, 1941, a huge fire destroyed most of Classic Hall. By 1946, the postwar enrollment at Hanover had more than rebounded. It had ballooned to 679 students, and the first great construction period of the college&#x27;s history was under way.

In 1947 Long College for Women was founded as a coordinate college. Until the 1960s, all women who graduated from Hanover had their degree officially conferred by Long instead of Hanover. Long College operated until the two colleges fully merged in 1978, making Hanover officially co-ed.

Parker had announced that he would retire as Hanover&#x27;s president as of September 1, 1958, but died in March of that year. John E. Horner was named as an interim president and ended up serving 29 years. Hanover students say that Parker&#x27;s ghost still haunts Parker auditorium.

Under Horner&#x27;s 29-year leadership, Hanover enjoyed unprecedented growth in its academic program, financial standing, and student enrollment. Soon after his arrival, he encouraged faculty members to reform their curriculum. Eventually Hanover divided its academic year into two 14-week terms, in which students took three classes, and a five-week Spring Term, in which students took one course of specialized, intensive study. With some modifications, it still serves as Hanover&#x27;s curricular model today.

By the mid-1960s, the campus expanded to more than 500 acres (2 km2) of land, enrollment topped 1,000 students, and Hanover&#x27;s assets approached $15 million.

In the late afternoon of April 3, 1974, a tornado roared through campus with devastating results. This tornado was part of the 1974 Super Outbreak of tornadoes that struck 13 states and one Canadian province that day. No one was killed or seriously injured, but 32 of the college&#x27;s 33 buildings were damaged, including two that were completely destroyed and six that sustained major structural damage. One of the completely destroyed buildings was a residence hall which had previously, back in 1890, served as the first fraternity house in the entire Sigma Chi Fraternity. Hundreds of trees were down, completely blocking every campus road. All utilities were knocked out and communication with those off campus was nearly impossible.

Government officials estimated the damage at $10 million. Some wondered if Hanover College could survive. The Hanoverians, led by Horner, sprang into action. Winter Term ended one week early and students were dismissed, but many stayed to help faculty, staff and others clear the debris. The Board of Trustees met April 5 in emergency session and vowed to lead the efforts in rebuilding and improving Hanover College. They vowed to do so without any federal disaster assistance, continuing Hanover&#x27;s tradition of financial independence.

Within a week, roads were made passable and major services restored. Contributions poured in to cover Hanover&#x27;s $1 million in uninsurable losses; they raised this amount in three months. When Spring Term opened April 22, the college had full enrollment 19 days after the tornado. An editorial in &quot;The Indianapolis Star&quot; described the effort as &quot;a private miracle.&quot; By spring 1975, replanting efforts completed Hanover&#x27;s recovery.

When Horner retired in 1987, Hanover&#x27;s endowment was more than $40 million. Russell Nichols was inaugurated as Hanover&#x27;s 14th president on September 26, 1987. He initiated actions to improve the Hanover experience for students both inside and outside the classroom. The number of full-time faculty was increased over a five-year period from 72 to 94, lowering the student-teacher ratio and allowing for more independent research and study. Six new academic majors were added.

In terms of amenities, students enjoyed a direct-dial telephone in each dorm room, ending years of having a campus operator direct all calls. More significantly, academic scholarships were increased for incoming and returning students.

In 1995 the $11 million Horner Health and Recreation Center was opened; it was named for the president emeritus and his wife.

===21st century===
In 2000 a $23 million Science Center was dedicated, which now houses all of the college&#x27;s five natural sciences in the same facility.

In May 2006, Nichols announced his plans to retire at the conclusion of the 2007 academic year. His accomplishments include the revision of the curriculum which expanded study abroad offerings. Additionally, he oversaw implementation of the Center for Business Preparation, an innovation program designed to link liberal arts education with business. In 2004, Hanover was awarded $11.4 million to start the Rivers Institute, a multi-disciplinary center to study all aspects of rivers throughout the world.

In the fall of 2007, Sue DeWine, former provost at Marietta College in Ohio, succeeded Nichols as president of Hanover College as the 15th president of Hanover College. DeWine was succeeded by Lake Lambert in 2015.

==Campus==

Hanover College is situated on of land overlooking the Ohio River. The land features several climbing paths and cliffs, as well as the only view of the Ohio from which three bends in the river can be seen. The campus is characterized by the Georgian style architecture. The quad features the Parker Auditorium, named for the former Hanover College president, Albert Parker.

In the 1940s the college turned down plans to rebuild the Sigma Chi fraternity house as designed by Frank Lloyd Wright, because it did not match the Georgian Architecture.

Much of the campus was heavily damaged in the April 3, 1974, tornado Super Outbreak, including several buildings that were destroyed. Damage to 32 of the 33 buildings totaled over $10 million. The campus lost hundreds of mature trees.

<doc id="918570" wikidata="Q4957736" url="?curid=918570" title="Branzburg v. Hayes">
<text>Branzburg v. Hayes, 408 U.S. 665 (1972), was a landmark decision of the US Supreme Court invalidating the use of the First Amendment as a defense for reporters summoned to testify before a grand jury. The case was argued February 23, 1972, and decided June 29 of the same year. The reporters lost their case by a vote of 5–4. This case is cited for the rule that in federal courts, a reporter may not generally avoid testifying in a criminal grand jury, and is one of a limited number of cases in which the U.S. Supreme Court has considered the use of reporters&#x27; privilege.

== Facts ==
Paul Branzburg of The (Louisville) &quot;Courier-Journal&quot;, in the course of his reporting duties, witnessed people manufacturing and using hashish. He wrote two articles concerning drug use in Kentucky. The first featured unidentified hands holding hashish, while the second included marijuana users as sources. These sources requested not to be identified. Both of the articles were brought to attention of law-enforcement personnel. Branzburg was subpoenaed before a grand jury for both of the articles. He was ordered to name his sources.

Earl Caldwell, a reporter for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, conducted extensive interviews with the leaders of The Black Panthers, and Paul Pappas, a Massachusetts television reporter, who also reported on The Black Panthers, spending several hours in their headquarters were similarly subpoenaed around the same time as was Paul Branzburg.

All three reporters were called to testify before separate grand juries about illegal actions they might have witnessed. They refused, citing a privilege under the Press Clause, and were held in contempt.

== Decision ==
In a fiercely-split decision, the Court ruled 5–4 against the existence of reportorial privilege in the Press Clause of the First Amendment. Writing for the majority, Justice Byron White declared that the petitioners were asking the Court &quot;to grant newsmen a testimonial privilege that other citizens do not enjoy. This we decline to do.&quot; White acknowledged the argument that refusing to recognize such a privilege would undermine the ability of the press to gather news, but wrote that &quot;from the beginning of the country the press has operated without constitutional protection for press informants, and the press has flourished.&quot;

He did not overlook the importance of a free press, however, and he established a test, citing &quot;Gibson v. Florida Legislative Investigation Comm.,&quot; for deciding whether a reporter can be compelled to testify before a grand jury. For such a subpoena to have merit, the government must &quot;convincingly show a substantial relation between the information sought and a subject of overriding and compelling state interest.&quot;

Complicating matters was Justice Lewis F. Powell&#x27;s concurrence. While he sided with the majority, Powell emphasized the &quot;limited nature&quot; of the decision when he stated:
The asserted claim to privilege should be judged on its facts by the striking of a proper balance between freedom of the press and the obligation of all citizens to give relevant testimony with respect to criminal conduct. The balance of these vital constitutional and societal interests on a case-by-case basis accords with the tried and traditional way of adjudicating such questions.

A few days after oral argument, and before writing his concurrence, Powell prepared handwritten notes of the court&#x27;s private conference to decide the disposition of the appeal. He stated in those notes:I will make clear in an opinion... that there is a &quot;privilege&quot; analogous to an evidentiary one, which courts should recognize and apply on case by case to protect confidential information... My vote turned on my conclusion... that we should not establish a &quot;constitutional&quot; privilege. (emphasis in original notes)

==Subsequent history==
Powell&#x27;s opinion has been interpreted by several lower courts as an indication that reportorial privilege exists but was simply not warranted in the specific case of &quot;Branzburg&quot;.

In &quot;Zerilli v. Smith&quot; the Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit concluded that the reporter&#x27;s privilege existed and that its application depended on two factors: (1) that the information sought was crucial to a litigant&#x27;s case and (2) that the information could not be acquired from any other source.

However, in 2003 in &quot;McKevitt v. Pallasch&quot;, Judge Posner reaffirmed the majority&#x27;s opinion in &quot;Branzburg&quot; in a case concerning a refusal to stay an order, in a terrorism case in Ireland, to subpoena recordings of a key witness possessed by a group of journalists. Posner used the case-by-case balancing test envisioned by Justice Powell, writing: The federal interest in cooperating in the criminal proceedings of friendly foreign nations is obvious; and it is likewise obvious that newsgathering and reporting activities of the press are inhibited when a reporter cannot assure a confidential source of confidentiality. Yet that was &quot;Branzburg&quot; and it is evident from the result in that case that the interest of the press in maintaining the confidentiality of sources is not absolute. There is no conceivable interest in confidentiality in the present case.

In July 2004, &quot;Branzburg&quot; was cited as precedent by United States District Court Chief Judge Thomas Hogan in a memorandum opinion denying a motion to quash two grand jury subpoenas issued to reporters. NBC Washington Bureau Chief Tim Russert and &quot;Time&quot; magazine reporter Matthew Cooper challenged the subpoenas issued in connection with the leak of the identity of former CIA operative Valerie Plame, citing their First Amendment rights as reason not to reveal their confidential sources. In the opinion, Hogan wrote:
Because this Court holds that the U.S. Supreme Court unequivocally rejected any reporter’s privilege rooted in the First Amendment or common law in the context of a grand jury acting in good faith, this Court denies the motions to quash.

Civil cases, as opposed to criminal cases, have been held not to come under the &quot;Branzburg&quot; test.

In 2007, the &quot;New York Times&quot; published Justice Powell&#x27;s notes of the court&#x27;s private conference on a form that looks like a scorecard. The Times purports that Justice Powell wrote the following:
I will make clear in an opinion – unless the court&#x27;s opinion is clear – that there is a privilege analogous to an evidentiary one, which courts should recognize and apply on case by case to protect confidential information. My vote turned on my conclusion – after hearing arguments of counsel and re-reading principal briefs – that we should not establish a constitutional privilege. If we did this, the problems that would flow from it would be difficult to foresee: e.g., applying a privilege of const. dimensions – to grand jurys, petite juries, congressional committees, etc... And who are &quot;newsmen&quot; – how to define?
==Quotes==
Persuading the Court to grant First Amendment protection to journalists regarding their sources was obviously going to be a hard sell. Notwithstanding the strong policy arguments in favor of establishing this privilege and the serious harm that would be caused by its absence, no such protection had ever been held to exist. Not only was the concept that the judicial system was entitled to &#x27;every man&#x27;s evidence&#x27; itself deeply rooted in the Constitution, but merely determining the scope of the privilege (&quot;when&quot; would it apply?) and identifying &quot;who&quot; would receive it (only regularly employed journalists? freelancers? anyone?) were difficult matters at best.--Floyd Abrams

<text>John Richard Hopkins (sometimes credited as John R. Hopkins; 27 January 1931 – 23 July 1998) was an English film, stage, and television writer.

==Biography==
Born in southwest London, England, Hopkins was educated at Raynes Park County Grammar School, then completed his National Service in the Army from 1950 to 1951. He read English Literature at St Catharine&#x27;s College, Cambridge, and joined BBC Television as a studio manager on graduation.

Hopkins began his writing career in radio, writing episodes of the BBC serial &quot;Mrs Dale&#x27;s Diary&quot; for eighteen months. An attempt to become a trainee television director at the commercial television franchise holder Granada Television was unsuccessful. The company did accept his first play, &quot;Break Up&quot; (1958), about the end of the marriage of a young couple, although it was only shown in the Granada region. He established himself as a writer beginning when his then father-in-law Nigel Balchin asked him to try to adapt his novels for television, Adaptations of both &quot;The Small Back Room&quot; (for &quot;Sunday Night Theatre&quot;) and &quot;Mine Own Executioner&quot; were broadcast in April and August 1959 respectively. Hopkins then adapted Margery Allingham&#x27;s novels about the private detective Albert Campion into &quot;Campion&quot; featuring two six-part serials, &quot;Dancers in Mourning&quot; (1959) and &quot;Death of a Ghost&quot; (1960). Hopkins followed with a series based on Rosamund Lehmann&#x27;s &quot;The Weather in the Streets&quot; (1961). He wrote his own thriller series, &quot;A Chance of Thunder&quot; in 1961.

Hopkins wrote over fifty episodes of the BBC police drama &quot;Z-Cars&quot;, remaining with the series for two and a half years, serving as the series&#x27; script editor for a time. One episode featured Judi Dench in the role of a delinquent. This character inspired Hopkins to write what is probably his best remembered work for the small screen, the four-part play sequence &quot;Talking to a Stranger&quot; (1966) directed by Christopher Morahan, with whom he had developed a rapport while working with him on &quot;Z-Cars&quot;. Starring Dench, and Michael Bryant, as the adult children of characters played by Maurice Denham, and Margery Mason, &quot;Talking to a Stranger&quot; was transmitted as part of BBC2&#x27;s &quot;Theatre 625&quot; anthology series. The plays told the story of one bleak weekend from the viewpoints of the four individuals. It won the British Directors&#x27; Guild Writers&#x27; Award and an Emmy in 1968 after the sequence was shown on American television. Critic George Melly described in &quot;The Observer&quot; as &quot;[t]he first authentic masterpiece written directly for television&quot;. Two &quot;Wednesday Plays&quot; from this period by Hopkins were &quot;Fable&quot; from January 1965 and &quot;Horror of Darkness&quot; broadcast the following March. The former imagines an inverted South African apartheid in Britain (which was postponed by the BBC in case it affected a by-election), while the latter is a rare exploration of homosexuality in the 1960s. &quot;Hour of Darkness&quot; featured Glenda Jackson and Nicol Williamson in the lead roles.

Hopkins made his feature film debut with the screenplay he co-wrote with director Roy Ward Baker &quot;Two Left Feet&quot; (1963), a lightweight comedy-drama with Michael Crawford. He received co-screenwriter credit with Richard Maibaum for the fourth James Bond film James Bond movie &quot;Thunderball&quot; (1965). He co-wrote the screenplay for Leslie Thomas&#x27; boys-in-uniform comedy &quot;The Virgin Soldiers&quot; (1969) and worked on the screenplay for the film adaptation of &quot;Man of La Mancha&quot; (1972), although he was removed from this project by United Artists when the studio discovered his draft omitted most of the songs from the musical. His screenplay for &quot;Murder by Decree&quot; (1979) places Sherlock Holmes against Jack the Ripper. The film was directed by Bob Clark and featured Christopher Plummer as Holmes and James Mason as Watson.

Hopkins wrote his first stage play, &quot;This Story of Yours&quot;, in 1968. Though it had poor reviews when it was staged at the Royal Court. One audience member who was impressed by the play was Sean Connery who chose it as a personal film project which became &quot;The Offence&quot; (1973). Connery not only produced the film under a deal with United Artists when he returned to the role of James Bond, but also acted in the film version, directed by Sidney Lumet. Hopkins&#x27; plays for the stage included &quot;Next of Kin&quot;, which was produced at London&#x27;s National Theatre in 1974 with Harold Pinter directing. His play, &quot;Find Your Way Home&quot; (1970) was produced in London and then on Broadway where it won a &quot;Best Actor&quot; Tony Award for Michael Moriarty.

Hopkins adapted Dostoevsky&#x27;s &quot;The Gambler&quot; (1973) for television, it starred Edith Evans and Philip Madoc, and he wrote the two-part television screenplay, &quot;Divorce His, Divorce Hers&quot; (1973), which starred Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor. His later television work also includes the &quot;Play for Today&quot; &quot;A Story to Frighten the Children&quot; (1976), and the serial adaptation of John le Carré&#x27;s novel &quot;Smiley&#x27;s People&quot; (1982), starring Alec Guinness, both for the BBC; and the Cold War espionage thriller &quot;&quot; (1988) for ITV. Hopkins&#x27; six-play cycle, &quot;Fathers and Families&quot; (1977), again directed by Christopher Morahan, was unsuccessful.

Hopkins died at his home in Woodland Hills, California, United States, in July 1998, following an accident in which he slipped, hit his head and fell unconscious into his swimming-pool, where he drowned.

==Private life==
In 1954, Hopkins married Prudence Anne Balchin, eldest daughter of author Nigel Balchin. They had two children, a daughter, Justine and a son, Marlin Jonathan, who died in a childhood accident in 1971. They were divorced in 1969.

In 1969, he married the American actress Shirley Knight; the couple had one daughter, Sophie. His stepdaughter from his marriage to Knight is actress Kaitlin Hopkins, whom he raised.

<doc id="918592" wikidata="Q352873" url="?curid=918592" title="Jeff Jarrett">
<text>Jeffrey Leonard Jarrett (born July 14, 1967) is an American professional wrestler and professional wrestling promoter. He is signed to All Elite Wrestling (AEW), where he both wrestles and serves as Director of Business Development.

Beginning his career in his father Jerry Jarrett&#x27;s Continental Wrestling Association (CWA) in 1986, Jarrett first came to prominence upon debuting with a country music star gimmick in the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE) in 1993. Over the next nine years, he alternated between the WWF and its main competitor, World Championship Wrestling (WCW). After WCW was purchased by the WWF in 2001, Jarrett joined the upstart World Wrestling All-Stars (WWA) promotion. In 2002, Jarrett and his father together founded (NWA-TNA, now Total Nonstop Action Wrestling). After departing the promotion in 2014, Jarrett founded another new promotion, Global Force Wrestling (GFW). After a failed merger between TNA and GFW, he cut ties with TNA. Jarrett then wrestled in Mexico for Lucha Libre AAA Worldwide before returning to WWE in January 2019 as an on-screen talent and producer. He departed WWE once more in August 2022, making his debut with AEW that November.

A third-generation wrestler, Jarrett has had over 80 championship reigns throughout his career, among them the NWA World Heavyweight Championship (six times), WCW World Heavyweight Championship (four times), and AAA Mega Championship (twice). He was inducted into the TNA Hall of Fame in 2015 and the WWE Hall of Fame in 2018.

== Professional wrestling career ==

=== Early career (1986–1993) ===
Born in Hendersonville, Tennessee, Jarrett became involved with basketball while attending Goodpasture Christian School, but he worked for his father Jerry Jarrett&#x27;s Continental Wrestling Association as a referee in March 1986 and trained as a wrestler under his father and Tojo Yamamoto. Jarrett made his in-ring debut at the age of 18 on April 6, 1986, when jobber Tony Falk attempted to end his lengthy losing streak by challenging Jarrett, then a referee, to a match. Jarrett accepted the challenge, wrestling Falk to a 10-minute draw. Jarrett is a third-generation wrestler: his father wrestled, as did his maternal grandfather, Eddie Marlin, while his paternal grandmother, Christine, was employed by Nashville-based wrestling promoters Nick Gulas and Roy Welch. He also wrestled with the American Wrestling Association (AWA) and the Continental Wrestling Federation (CWF) in the late 1980s.

In 1989, his father Jerry purchased the Texas-based World Class Championship Wrestling (WCCW) promotion and merged it with the CWA to create the United States Wrestling Association (USWA). Over the following years, Jarrett won the USWA Southern Heavyweight Championship on 10 occasions and the USWA World Tag Team Championship on 15 occasions. Jarrett also wrestled on the independent circuit for seven years, appearing in Japan and Puerto Rico. In 1990, he wrestled his first tour of Japan for Super World Sports (SWS). Jarrett would continue wrestling for USWA full-time until losing the championship to Jerry Lawler on December 20, 1993, but return sporadically for future dates.

=== World Wrestling Federation (1992, 1993–1996)===

==== Early appearances (1992) ====
Jarrett&#x27;s first involvement with the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) came on August 9, 1992, when he participated in the kick-off to the first cross-promotional angle between the WWF and the USWA. Sitting at ringside along with Jerry Lawler at the WWF house show that was being held at the Memphis Pyramid, he issued an open challenge to any WWF wrestler. After defeating Kamala by disqualification that night, Bret Hart accepted Jarrett&#x27;s challenge for a match the next time that the WWF came to Memphis. Beginning in October, Jarrett himself began making appearances on WWF house show events, defeating Mondo Kleen and Barry Horowitz. At a &quot;WWF Wrestling Challenge&quot; taping in Louisville, Kentucky, on October 28, Jarrett scored his biggest victory of his nascent WWF career by upsetting Rick Martel. However, the scheduled match between Bret Hart and Jarrett on October 31 in Memphis was cancelled due to poor weather. Following the cancelled Memphis show, he returned to the USWA.

==== Double J (1993–1994) ====
Nearly a year later, Jarrett returned to the World Wrestling Federation. He made his televised return on October 23, 1993, on &quot;WWF Superstars of Wrestling&quot; as a heel under the gimmick of &quot;Double J&quot; Jeff Jarrett, a country music singer who intended to elevate his singing career through his exposure as a wrestler. Jarrett&#x27;s character would strut to the ring wearing flashing &quot;Double J&quot; hats and ring attire, while he punctuated his promos with the phrase &quot;Ain&#x27;t I great?&quot;. He ended his interviews by distinctly spelling out his name (&quot;That&#x27;s J-E-Double-F, J-A-Double-R, E-Double-T!&quot;). He would often win matches by smashing opponents with an acoustic guitar, which was nicknamed &quot;El Kabong&quot; after the cartoon character Quick Draw McGraw. The &quot;Double J&quot; character was a country music version of The Honky Tonk Man.

Jarrett had his first televised match with the WWF on the December 20, 1993, episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, defeating P.J. Walker. Jarrett made his pay-per-view debut in January 1994 at the Royal Rumble, entering the Royal Rumble match as the 12th participant and was eliminated less than 90 seconds later by Randy Savage. Also at the Royal Rumble, Jarrett participated in attacking The Undertaker and forcing him into the casket, an incident that would be a focal point in Undertaker&#x27;s rematch later that year. Jarrett was scheduled to wrestle in a five vs. five tag match at WrestleMania X, but the match did not take place due to time constraints. However, the match did take place on the April 4 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, with Jarrett&#x27;s team winning. During this time, Jarrett started having what would be a very long string of matches with Doink (Ray Apollo) during house shows in which he usually won the match. Despite getting past Lex Luger by countout in the first round, Jarrett lost in the second round of the 1994 King of the Ring tournament, being pinned by the 1-2-3 Kid. Only weeks before SummerSlam, the WWF promoted a match as part of a &quot;rap versus country&quot; rivalry that pitted Jarrett against Mabel who portrayed a rapper. There was little buildup for the match until Mabel tried to provoke Jarrett into a fight, but Jarrett simply exited. At SummerSlam, Jarrett won the match by pinfall.

Around this time, Jarrett began a feud with the 1-2-3 Kid&#x27;s friend, WWF Intercontinental Champion Razor Ramon. Jarrett would face both men at Survivor Series 1994, Jarrett&#x27;s team competed in another five vs. five tag team match, this time with elimination rules. Jarrett&#x27;s team lost when all the members of the team including himself were counted out. Later during the event, Jarrett once again tried to illegally attack The Undertaker, but this time was stopped by Chuck Norris. In January 1995, Jarrett would once again feud with Bret Hart, ultimately losing to Hart on the January 23 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;.

==== WWF Intercontinental Champion (1995–1996) ====
At the 1995 Royal Rumble in Tampa, Florida, Jarrett defeated Razor Ramon to win the WWF Intercontinental Championship thanks to interference by his assistant, The Roadie. In an effort to become a dual champion, Jarrett challenged Diesel for the WWF World Heavyweight Championship in the main event of the February 20 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, but lost the match. Razor Ramon received a rematch at WrestleMania XI which Jarrett lost by disqualification, but retained the Intercontinental Championship. Jarrett and The Roadie lost as a duo to Razor Ramon in a handicap match at In Your House 1. On April 26, 1995, the Intercontinental Championship was declared vacant after a controversial ending to a match between Jarrett and Bob Holly. They had a rematch later that evening where Jarrett reclaimed the title. On May 19, Razor Ramon regained the title from Jarrett in Montreal, Quebec, but Jarrett won it back two nights later in Trois-Rivières, Quebec, making him a three-time Intercontinental Champion.

At In Your House 2: The Lumberjacks on July 23, 1995, Jarrett performed the song &quot;With My Baby Tonight&quot;. Later that evening, Jarrett lost the Intercontinental Championship to Shawn Michaels. Following the event, Jarrett left the WWF for five months and returned to the USWA. Jarrett returned to the WWF at In Your House 5 on December 17, 1995, feuding with Ahmed Johnson. Jarrett lost to Johnson by disqualification at the 1996 Royal Rumble and left the WWF shortly thereafter due to a contract dispute. Later that year, The Roadie revealed that he had in fact sung &quot;With My Baby Tonight&quot; and that Jarrett had been lip synching.

=== United States Wrestling Association (1996) ===
After leaving the WWF in January 1996, Jarrett returned to the United States Wrestling Association in Memphis. He won the USWA Unified World Heavyweight Championship for the third time defeating Jerry Lawler on April 20. He dropped the title back to Lawler in August and left the USWA before the promotion folded in November 1997.

=== World Championship Wrestling (1996–1997) ===
In October 1996, Jarrett was hired by World Championship Wrestling (WCW), signing a one-year contract. Upon debuting in WCW, Jarrett became a &quot;free agent&quot; in the rivalry between The Four Horsemen and the New World Order (nWo). After defeating Chris Benoit at Starrcade, and Steve McMichael, both by cheating when the referee was distracted, Jarrett was reluctantly inducted into the Four Horsemen. On June 9, 1997, Jarrett defeated Dean Malenko to win the WCW United States Heavyweight Championship. In mid-1997, Jarrett was kicked out of the Four Horsemen and began feuding with Horsemen member Steve McMichael. Despite aligning himself with McMichael&#x27;s then-wife, Debra McMichael, Jarrett lost the United States Heavyweight Championship to McMichael on August 21. In October, Jarrett&#x27;s contract expired and he opted to return to the WWF, despite the dominance of WCW in the ongoing &quot;Monday Night War&quot;.

=== World Wrestling Federation (1997–1999)===

==== National Wrestling Alliance invasion (1997–1998) ====
Jarrett returned to the WWF on the October 20, 1997, episode of &quot;Raw is War&quot;, delivering a worked shoot speech in which he criticized both WCW President Eric Bischoff and WWF Chairman Vince McMahon. After briefly feuding with The Undertaker, Jarrett defeated Barry Windham to win the vacant NWA North American Heavyweight Championship. In early 1998, Jarrett joined forces with Jim Cornette and his stable of &quot;invading&quot; National Wrestling Alliance wrestlers, and began defending the North American Heavyweight Championship on WWF television. In March, Jarrett left Cornette&#x27;s stable, and Cornette stripped him of the title and awarded it to Windham.

==== Teaming with Owen Hart (1998–1999) ====
Jarrett went on to reprise his country music singer gimmick on the March 2, 1998, edition of &quot;Monday Night Raw&quot;, introducing Tennessee Lee as his new manager. At on April 26, 1998, Jarrett once again sang alongside Sawyer Brown with their hit single, &quot;Some Girls Do&quot;. On the June 1, 1998, edition of &quot;Raw&quot;, Tennessee Lee introduced Southern Justice (formerly known as the Godwinns) as Jarrett&#x27;s new bodyguards. Jarrett grew a goatee at that time. On the August 9, 1998, edition of &quot;Sunday Night Heat&quot;, Jarrett fired Tennessee Lee after he had inadvertently cost Jarrett multiple matches in the preceding weeks. Jarrett and Southern Justice then began feuding with D-Generation X (DX), with Jarrett losing to DX member X-Pac in a hair vs. hair match at SummerSlam. Jarrett&#x27;s long hair was subsequently cut short by DX and Howard Finkel, who had himself been shaved bald by Jarrett and Southern Justice shortly before SummerSlam. Jarrett and Southern Justice were defeated by DX at in September, and the trio separated shortly thereafter.

Jarrett briefly feuded with Al Snow before reuniting with Debra, who had left WCW for the WWF, and forming a tag team with Owen Hart. Hart and Jarrett were close friends and travel partners for years, so the team jelled almost immediately. Jarrett and Hart won the WWF Tag Team Championship from Ken Shamrock and Big Boss Man, successfully defending the titles at WrestleMania XV before losing to Kane and X-Pac on an episode of &quot;Raw&quot;. Eight days after Hart died in a stunt that went wrong at Over the Edge, Jarrett defeated The Godfather, who Owen was scheduled to face at the pay-per-view, for the Intercontinental Championship. As he was handed the title belt, he yelled Hart&#x27;s name in tribute to his friend. In mid-1999, Jarrett exchanged the Intercontinental Championship with Edge and D&#x27;Lo Brown on two more occasions. His fifth reign broke Razor Ramon&#x27;s record from 1995. He held the record until Chris Jericho&#x27;s seventh reign in 2004.

In the months that followed, Jarrett became increasingly abusive towards Debra. At SummerSlam, Jarrett challenged D&#x27;Lo Brown for both the WWF European Championship and WWF Intercontinental Championships, with Debra accompanying Brown to the ring following an argument with Jarrett. Brown lost the match after both Mark Henry and Debra turned on him, making Jarrett the second ever &quot;Euro-Continental Champion&quot;. On the following episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Jarrett rewarded Debra and Henry by giving Debra an assistant, Miss Kitty, and Henry the European Championship. In late 1999, Jarrett began feuding with Chyna over the Intercontinental Championship. Over the course of the feud, Jarrett would develop a misogynistic character, attacking numerous women such as Jacqueline, Stephanie McMahon and Cindy Margolis, while insinuating women like Chyna &quot;had no business being in a wrestling ring, and should be cooking, cleaning and making babies&quot;. He would attack Chyna with frying pans and even dump her in a laundry basket. Jarrett eventually abandoned Debra in favor of Miss Kitty after he and Debra were defeated by Stephanie McMahon and Test in a mixed tag team match. He later also turned on Miss Kitty after she lost a match that Jarrett had inserted her into in his place.

Jarrett left the WWF in October 1999, right after WWF head writer Vince Russo resigned from the WWF in order to join WCW. Jarrett&#x27;s contract expired on October 16, 1999, one day before his scheduled match with Chyna at No Mercy. Jarrett wrestled at No Mercy nonetheless, losing the Intercontinental Championship to Chyna. Chyna later alleged that Jarrett and Russo had colluded in order to delay Jarrett&#x27;s title defense until after Jarrett&#x27;s contract had expired, and that Jarrett had subsequently made a deal with WWF Chairman Vince McMahon for $200,000 in order to wrestle at No Mercy without a contract. In 2006, Jarrett asserted that he had been paid only what he was owed by the WWF. In a 2008 interview for a TNA special, Jarrett stated that not only were his negotiations cordial and in good faith, but that he also got stock options in WWF&#x27;s initial public offering, which occurred two days after he left.

=== World Championship Wrestling (1999–2001)===

==== nWo 2000 (1999–2000) ====
Jarrett returned to WCW on the October 18, 1999, episode of &quot;WCW Monday Nitro&quot;, attacking Buff Bagwell and proclaiming himself the &quot;Chosen One&quot; of WCW. Jarrett took part in a tournament for the vacant WCW World Heavyweight Championship, winning his first three matches with the assistance of Creative Control. At Mayhem on November 21, he was eliminated from the tournament after losing his semi-final match to Chris Benoit following interference from Dustin Rhodes. At Starrcade on December 19, Jarrett defeated Rhodes in a Bunkhouse Brawl, then unsuccessfully challenged Benoit for the United States Heavyweight Championship in a ladder match. On the following episode of &quot;Nitro&quot;, Jarrett defeated Benoit in a rematch, winning the belt. In the same evening, Jarrett reformed the nWo with WCW World Heavyweight Champion Bret Hart and the reigning WCW World Tag Team Champions, Kevin Nash and Scott Hall, with the foursome calling themselves &quot;nWo 2000&quot;.

In early 2000, Jarrett feuded with WCW Commissioner Terry Funk, who forced him to wrestle three veterans – George Steele, Tito Santana, and Jimmy Snuka – in one night. Jarrett was stripped of the United States Heavyweight Championship after suffering a concussion during his bout with Snuka, but the title was returned to him by Nash after he became WCW Commissioner. In order to help him retain the title, Jarrett drafted the Harris Brothers (formerly Creative Control) into nWo 2000. In the following months, Jarrett repeatedly challenged Sid Vicious for the WCW World Heavyweight Championship, in the process clashing with Nash and winning the position of WCW Commissioner for himself. Following Bret Hart&#x27;s retirement, the nWo disbanded.

==== WCW World Heavyweight Champion (2000–2001) ====

In April, WCW was rebooted by Eric Bischoff and Vince Russo, with all titles vacated as a result. Bischoff and Russo also created The New Blood, a stable of younger wrestlers who feuded with The Millionaire&#x27;s Club, made up of the older members of the WCW roster. Jarrett joined The New Blood, and at Spring Stampede on April 16, he defeated Millionaires Club member Diamond Dallas Page to win the vacant WCW World Heavyweight Championship. Page regained the title on April 24, and on April 25, the title was contested in a tag team match pitting Jarrett and Bischoff against Page and actor David Arquette. Arquette won the WCW World Heavyweight Championship after pinning Bischoff. Jarrett hit Page with the championship belt while special referee Kimberly Page&#x27;s back was turned; WCW official Mickie Jay counted Bischoff out while Jarrett had Page pinned, who kicked out. At Slamboree on May 7, Jarrett defeated Page and Arquette in a three-way triple cage match to win his second WCW World Heavyweight Championship after Arquette turned on Page.

In May, Jarrett won and lost the WCW World Heavyweight Championship on two further occasions, regaining the title from Ric Flair both times. Jarrett feuded with Nash and Hulk Hogan throughout June 2000, and on July 9 at Bash at the Beach, he faced Hogan with the world championship on the line; the match ended swiftly after Jarrett immediately lay down, allowing Hogan to rest a boot on his chest and win the title, with Hogan commenting, &quot;That&#x27;s why this company is in the damn shape it&#x27;s in—because of bullshit like this!&quot;. Vince Russo subsequently came to the ring and delivered a profanity-laced statement, in which he accused Hogan of politicking and claimed that Hogan had used his creative control to refuse to lose to Jarrett. Russo then stated that, while Hogan was free to keep the title belt he had just won (the &quot;Hulk Hogan Memorial Belt&quot;), Jarrett would wrestle Booker T for the official WCW World Heavyweight Championship later that night. Booker T won the match and Hogan did not appear in WCW again. It is disputed whether the situation was a shoot, a work, or some combination of the two.

In the following months, Jarrett briefly feuded with Booker T, Mike Awesome, Sting, Buff Bagwell, and Flair. In late 2000, he joined forces with the Harris Brothers once more, with the trio defeating The Filthy Animals at Starrcade on December 17. In the same evening, Jarrett aligned himself with WCW World Heavyweight Champion Scott Steiner by helping Steiner defeat Sid Vicious.

In 2001, Jarrett and Steiner became members of The Magnificent Seven, a large stable headed by Flair. Flair and Jarrett feuded with Dusty and Dustin Rhodes until March, when WCW was purchased by the WWF.

Uninterested in Jarrett, the WWF neglected to acquire his contract, leaving him without a job. On the March 26 episode of the WWF&#x27;s &quot;Raw&quot; program (which coincided with the final episode of &quot;Nitro&quot;), company owner Vince McMahon was seen watching Jarrett within the WCW venue on a television set. Mocking Jarrett&#x27;s trademark of distinctly spelling out his name, McMahon stated that Jarrett would be &quot;Capital G, Double-O, Double-N, Double-E – GOONNEE!&quot;

=== World Wrestling All-Stars (2001–2003) ===
With both WCW and the WWF now ruled out as employment options, Jarrett resurfaced in World Wrestling All-Stars (WWA) in late 2001, wrestling throughout Australia and Europe. Jarrett won the WWA World Heavyweight Championship, but was later stripped of the title. Jarrett returned to the WWA during his first NWA World Heavyweight Championship reign; he defeated Sting for the WWA World Heavyweight Championship at the last WWA event on May 25, 2003, unifying the two titles.

=== NWA Total Nonstop Action / Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (2002–2014)===

==== NWA World Heavyweight Champion (2002–2006) ====

In June 2002, Jarrett and his father created a limited-liability company, J Sports and Entertainment and opened a new pro wrestling promotion, Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA). TNA aired in a weekly pay-per-view format until May 2004, when the promotion negotiated a television deal with Fox Sports Net and began broadcasting &quot;Impact!&quot;. In November 2004, TNA began airing monthly pay-per-views instead of weekly pay-per-views, and in October 2005 &quot;Impact!&quot; moved to Spike TV. Panda Energy and its chairman and CEO, Robert Carter, acquired a controlling interest in TNA in 2002, although Jarrett remained a minority owner.

On the inaugural TNA pay-per-view on June 19, 2002, Jarrett took part in a Gauntlet for the Gold with the NWA World Heavyweight Championship on the line, but was eliminated by country singer Toby Keith. In the following months, Jarrett feuded with Scott Hall, Brian Lawler, and Brian Girard James. On November 20, 2002, Jarrett defeated Ron Killings to win the NWA World Heavyweight Championship with the assistance of Vince Russo. After Jarrett refused to join Russo&#x27;s Sports Entertainment Xtreme stable, Russo turned the members of SEX, including the debuting Raven, against Jarrett. The rivalry continued until February 2003, when Russo parted ways with SEX. In the following months, Jarrett feuded with the remaining members of SEX, then began feuding with Raven and Raven&#x27;s Nest, the group of wrestlers that Raven controlled. On June 11, 2003, Jarrett faced Raven and A.J. Styles in a 3-way match for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship. Styles pinned Jarrett to win the title after the returning Russo struck Jarrett with a guitar. Jarrett regained the title from Styles on October 22, 2003, turning heel. Jarrett was unable to escape Styles, losing the title to him on April 21, 2004, in a steel cage after Russo—who had returned as the new TNA Director of Authority—chose Styles to replace the injured Chris Harris. Jarrett would get revenge on May 19, however, by hitting Styles with a guitar during a title match, which enabled Ron Killings to win the title. Jarrett then defeated Killings, Styles, Raven and Harris in a King of the Mountain match on June 2 to win his third NWA World Heavyweight Championship.

In early 2005, Jarrett formed a dominant stable known as Planet Jarrett with Monty Brown, Kip James, and, later, Rhino. Jarrett also used the phrase &quot;Planet Jarrett&quot; to refer to TNA as a whole, reflecting his real-life stake in the company and his prominent role within the promotion. On April 3, 2005, Jarrett defended the championship outside NWA territory, wrestling Ray González in the International Wrestling Association. González won with a clean pin and briefly held the belt, being stripped on the same card. The championship was returned to Jarrett and the change was not recorded as official by TNA or the NWA. Despite his efforts to hold on to the title, however, he lost it to long-time rival A.J. Styles at Hard Justice on May 15, 2005.

Jarrett won his fourth NWA World Heavyweight Championship on September 15, 2005, defeating Raven at a Border City Wrestling (BCW) event. He lost the title to Rhino at Bound for Glory on October 23, but regained it on the November 3 episode of &quot;Impact!&quot;. Jarrett&#x27;s reign lasted until Against All Odds on February 12, 2006, when he was defeated by Christian Cage.

In the following months, Jarrett feuded with Sting, who had declared that Jarrett was a &quot;cancer&quot; in TNA. In the course of the feud, Scott Steiner debuted in TNA as an ally of Jarrett.

At Slammiversary on June 18, 2006, Jarrett won his sixth NWA World Heavyweight Championship in a King of the Mountain match when referee Earl Hebner tipped over a ladder that Christian Cage and Sting were simultaneously climbing. He retained the title in a bout with Sting at Hard Justice after Cage turned on Sting, hitting him with one of Jarrett&#x27;s guitars. After a polygraph proved that Jarrett had cheated to win the NWA World Heavyweight Championship, Director of Authority Jim Cornette forced Jarrett to wrestle Samoa Joe in a &quot;fan&#x27;s revenge&quot; lumberjack match at No Surrender, with Joe winning the match. At the Bound for Glory pay-per-view on October 22, Sting defeated Jarrett for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship after Jarrett was forced to submit to Sting&#x27;s signature finisher, the Scorpion Death Lock.

==== Various feuds (2006–2010) ====

On the following episode of &quot;Impact!&quot;, Jarrett announced in an interview that he was leaving TNA indefinitely. For the following six months, Jarrett did not appear on TNA television, instead focusing on his role as Vice President of TNA Entertainment. Jarrett, however, temporarily returned to TNA television on the April 12, 2007, episode of &quot;Impact!&quot;, and aligned himself with Samoa Joe, by helping him defeat A.J. Styles, turning face. On April 15 at Lockdown, Jarrett, making his in-ring return, and the rest of Team Angle defeated Team Cage in a Lethal Lockdown match. The following episode of &quot;Impact!&quot;, he delivered his first promo in months, stating it&#x27;s not all about Jeff Jarrett and he returned to give back to the wrestlers and fans, officially completing his face turn. He then entered into a feud with Robert Roode, losing a match to him at Sacrifice on May 13. Jarrett was then scheduled to take on Styles with the winner to earn a spot in the King of the Mountain match at Slammiversary on June 17 but could not compete due to &quot;personal issues&quot;. In 2008, Jarrett was featured in the promotion of TNA&#x27;s &quot;Maximum Impact!&quot; tour of the United Kingdom.

At Hard Justice on August 10, 2008, Samoa Joe defeated Booker T using the Acoustic Equalizer, the trademark move of Jarrett, setting up for his return to in-ring action, as quoted by the website, &quot;Obviously, we all know who used a guitar in the past!&quot; referring indirectly to Jarrett. After numerous weeks of Jarrett&#x27;s theme song playing and his guitar appearing on TNA programming, Jarrett returned on the September 11 episode of &quot;Impact!&quot;. At No Surrender on September 14, he would help Joe defeat Kurt Angle and Cage and assist Joe in retaining the TNA World Heavyweight Championship by hitting Angle with a guitar, keeping him a face. The following Thursday on &quot;Impact!&quot;, Jarrett cut his first promo since Slammiversary, claiming that the current respect angle that Sting was involved in was actually a matter of the veterans refusing to pass the torch to the young guys. Angle came out and challenged Jarrett to a match at Bound for Glory IV on October 12, but Jarrett refused, saying he had nothing left to prove, and instead pointed to the screen to reveal the debuting Mick Foley. On the next episode of &quot;Impact!&quot;, Jarrett relented to verbal cheap shots taken by Angle regarding Jarrett&#x27;s children and accepted the match at Bound for Glory. The feud got more personal due to Angle mentioning Jarrett&#x27;s wife, which led to Foley being named the special enforcer for their match. At Bound for Glory, Jarrett returned to the ring after a 17-month absence, and defeated Angle using his Acoustic Equalizer.
On the November 20 episode of &quot;Impact!&quot;, Kurt Angle threatened Mick Foley and wanted another match against Jarrett at Final Resolution on December 7 after Foley announced that it was Angle would face Rhino at Final Resolution. Angle continued to demand a match with Jarrett and he said if he could not get Jarrett at Final Resolution, he would wrestle Foley. Angle then slapped Foley causing Jarrett to come out and talk about what Angle wanted and then what Jarrett wanted (Angle to be fired). Because of Angle&#x27;s contract clause, Jarrett could not fire him, so he made this stipulation: if Angle lost to Rhino, he would be fired from TNA; if Angle beat Rhino, he would get Jarrett at Genesis on January 11, 2009. Angle defeated Rhino at Final Resolution, allowing him to face Jarrett at Genesis. The feud got even more personal when it started involving Jarrett&#x27;s three daughters during the December 11 episode of &quot;Impact!&quot;. Angle said that they would become orphans after Genesis and that &quot;Uncle Kurt&quot; may find it in his heart to adopt them and make them his. Jarrett came out to confront him but was held back by his longtime friend, BG James, TNA Personnel Terry Taylor, referee Earl Hebner, and Scott D&#x27;Amore. At Genesis, Jarrett lost to Angle. Jarrett suffered some injuries, but able to compete on the TNA Maximum Impact Tour, by facing against Angle in two singles and a few tag team matches with A.J. Styles against Angle and Scott Steiner. Then on the February 12 episode of &quot;Impact!&quot;, Jarrett returned to stop Angle from forcing Sting to lay down and gain an easy championship victory. The next week, Jarrett allowed Angle to have another match against Sting, and on the February 26 episode of &quot;Impact!&quot;, Jarrett announced Angle versus Sting at Destination X on March 15 for the TNA World Heavyweight Championship. At Lockdown on April 19, Jarrett captained a team against Angle&#x27;s team in Lethal Lockdown which his team won.

Jarrett would then enter a feud with Mick Foley, who attacked him while shooting his DVD at the TNA Asylum. The two would meet in a four-way match at Sacrifice on May 24 involving Kurt Angle and Sting with Jarrett putting his voting shares in TNA on the line, Angle putting his leadership of The Main Event Mafia, Sting putting his career, and Foley putting the TNA World Heavyweight Championship; Sting would go on to pin Angle for the victory and leadership of the Main Event Mafia. Jarrett later pinned Eric Young in order to qualify for the King of the Mountain match, however, Young attacked Jarrett after the match in the storyline. The following week, Jarrett called out Young and offered to turn the other cheek, but instead Young provoked him by saying that he pays more attention to wrestling than his own daughters just like his father Jerry which resulted in Jarrett slapping Young and assaulting him. Jarrett also would accidentally punch referee Earl Hebner while Hebner was trying to separate the two. On the June 11 episode of &quot;Impact!&quot;, Mick Foley kayfabe fined and suspended Jarrett and threw him out of the arena as a punishment. The following week, Foley threw a party for Jarrett and welcomed his return to TNA in order to have him on his side at Slammiversary on June 21. At Slammiversary, Jarrett refused to give Foley the belt in the King of the Mountain match, which was won by Kurt Angle after assistance from Samoa Joe. Shortly after Slammiversary, Jarrett once again disappeared from TNA programming. During his hiatus, it was reported that Jarrett had lost all of his backstage power in TNA and would return only as a wrestler.

On the December 3 episode of &quot;Impact!&quot;, Jarrett made his first appearance in months via telephone, refusing to help Mick Foley regain control over TNA after Dixie Carter had announced that Hulk Hogan was coming to TNA. On the December 10 episode of &quot;Impact!&quot;, Foley met with Jarrett, who agreed to return and help him deal with Carter and Hogan. On the January 4, 2010 episode of &quot;Impact!&quot;, Hogan made his debut, confronted Jarrett and claimed that he had to earn his spot in TNA. The following week, Jarrett started showing signs of a heel turn as he threatened Hogan with legal actions; however, on the January 28 episode of &quot;Impact!&quot;, he changed his mind and agreed to fight for his spot. In the main event of the show, he came out to no entrance music or pyrotechnics and was defeated by Mr. Anderson after a low blow. This started an angle of Hogan&#x27;s business partner Eric Bischoff, acting on his own without Hogan, having Jarrett work humiliating jobs backstage at the Impact! Zone, such as flipping burgers and cleaning restrooms, while also booking him in unfavorable matches, such as surprise Falls Count Anywhere and handicap matches.

On the March 22 episode of &quot;Impact!&quot;, after Jarrett broke a guitar over Bischoff&#x27;s head, Bischoff placed him and Mick Foley, another wrestler he had had problems with, against each other in a No Disqualification match, where the loser would get fired from TNA. Jarrett won the match, refereed by Beer Money, Inc., and with Foley fired from TNA, Hogan ordered Bischoff to lay off of Jarrett. The following week, Hogan, prior to leaving on a business trip, apologized to Jarrett for Bischoff&#x27;s behavior and gave him a chance to earn the number one contendership to the TNA World Heavyweight Championship in a match against the TNA World Heavyweight Champion A.J. Styles. With Hogan out of the building, Bischoff and Styles&#x27; manager Ric Flair interfered in the match and cost Jarrett the number one contendership. Later in the evening, Jarrett was announced as the second member of Abyss&#x27; Team Hogan in the annual Lethal Lockdown match, where they would meet Team Flair, led by Sting. At Lockdown on April 18, Team Hogan (Abyss, Jarrett, Rob Van Dam and Jeff Hardy) defeated Team Flair (Sting, Desmond Wolfe, Robert Roode and James Storm), when Bischoff turned face and helped Team Hogan pick up the victory, effectively ending his feud with Jarrett. Just before Lockdown, Jarrett said that he was going to find out the answers to Sting&#x27;s behavior, which led into a brawl on &quot;Impact!&quot;, with Sting leaving a beaten Jarrett in the ring, which in turn led to their match at Sacrifice on May 16. At Sacrifice, Sting assaulted Jarrett prior to their match and then dragged him in to the ring, where he scored a pinfall in seconds over a bloodied Jarrett.

Jarrett was sidelined for a month before making his return at Slammiversary VIII on June 13, where he cost Sting his TNA World Heavyweight Championship match against Rob Van Dam. On the June 24 episode of &quot;Impact!&quot;, Sting assaulted Jarrett to the point that TNA president Dixie Carter suspended him for 30 days without pay the following week. During Sting&#x27;s suspension, Jarrett found a new enemy in Kevin Nash, who claimed that Jarrett himself, and not Sting, was what was wrong with TNA. Sting returned from his suspension on the August 5 episode of &quot;Impact!&quot;, wearing a new red face paint, and, together with Nash, beat down Jarrett, Bischoff and Hogan. On the August 26 episode of &quot;Impact!&quot;, Jarrett attempted to recruit Samoa Joe to help him against Nash and Sting, but was turned down. Thus Jarrett was left alone for a match, where he was defeated by Nash, after an interference from Sting. The following week, Sting defeated Jarrett in a singles match, after an interference from Kevin Nash. After the match, Samoa Joe joined Jarrett and drove Sting and Nash away. At No Surrender on September 5, Jarrett and Joe defeated Sting and Nash in a tag team match, after Jarrett hit Sting with his own baseball bat.

==== Immortal and feud with Kurt Angle (2010–2011) ====

At Bound for Glory on October 10, Jarrett and Joe faced Sting, Nash and their newest ally D&#x27;Angelo Dinero in a two-on-three handicap match after Hulk Hogan, who was scheduled to team with Joe and Jarrett, was forced to pull out due to a back surgery; at the end of the match, Jarrett abandoned Joe and left Joe behind to be pinned by Nash, thus Jarrett turned heel for the first time since 2007. At the end of the event, Jarrett aligned himself with Hulk Hogan, who ended up making a surprise appearance, Eric Bischoff, Abyss and the new TNA World Heavyweight Champion Jeff Hardy, all of whom made heel turns with the exception of the already heel Abyss, in the process revealing themselves as the &quot;they&quot; Abyss had referred to. On the following episode of &quot;Impact!&quot;, Jarrett explained that he had joined the stable, now known as Immortal, in order to get back at Dixie Carter for taking away his backstage power in TNA, while also wanting to end the career of Kurt Angle, who had proclaimed that he would retire from professional wrestling if he failed to win the TNA World Heavyweight Championship at Bound for Glory. Jarrett then attacked Angle, when he was being restrained by TNA&#x27;s security officers. The following week, Samoa Joe attempted to avenge what had happened at Bound for Glory, but was restrained by the security officers, before being beat down by Jarrett.

At Turning Point on November 7, Jarrett defeated Joe after choking him out with a baton, following interference from Gunner and Murphy, his security officers. On the following episode of &quot;Impact!&quot;, Jarrett assaulted Joe after he had defeated Gunner and Murphy in a handicap match, but was then chased away by the returning Kurt Angle. At Final Resolution on December 5, Jarrett faced Joe in a submission match; after a pre-match assault and later an interference by Gunner and Murphy, Jarrett forced Joe to submit with an ankle lock. On the January 6, 2011, episode of &quot;Impact!&quot;, Angle interrupted Jarrett&#x27;s $100,000 mixed martial arts (MMA) challenge and signed a contract to face him at Genesis on January 9 in an MMA exhibition match, since he had promised not to wrestle again. The match was thrown out in the third round after Jarrett blinded Angle; after the match, Jarrett bloodied Angle, before announcing that he was ending his mixed martial arts career and promised that his current (and Angle&#x27;s former) wife, Karen Jarrett, would be joining the retirement party.

On the January 13 episode of &quot;Impact!&quot;, Karen made her return and stopped Angle just as he was about to attack Jarrett, telling him that she would not allow him to ruin their personal lives and promised to tell all about their divorce the following week. The following week, Karen slapped Angle, providing a distraction which allowed Jarrett to beat him down. On February 13 at Against All Odds, Jarrett defeated Angle in a singles match and as a result Angle was forced to walk Karen down the aisle, when she and Jarrett renewed their wedding vows on the March 3 edition of &quot;Impact!&quot;. On March 3, Angle proceeded to destroy the wedding set with an axe and forced wedding guest, New York Jet Bart Scott to tap out with the ankle lock.

On April 17 at Lockdown, Jarrett defeated Angle in an &quot;Ultra Male Rules&quot; two-out-of-three Falls steel cage match, with help from Karen. It was later reported that Jarrett had severely bruised his ribs in the match. On the May 12 episode of &quot;Impact Wrestling&quot;, Angle revealed a name from Jarrett&#x27;s past, Chyna, as his backup in taking care of him and Karen. At Sacrifice on May 15, Angle and Chyna defeated the Jarretts in a mixed tag team match. With Karen out of the picture, Angle defeated Jarrett on June 12 at Slammiversary IX in what was billed as the &quot;final battle&quot; between the two. However, on the following episode of &quot;Impact Wrestling&quot;, Jarrett challenged Angle to a Parking Lot Brawl and agreed to sign a contract that would force him to move to Mexico without Angle&#x27;s children; Angle ended up winning the fight after choking Jarrett with a shirt, forcing him to say &quot;adiós&quot;, thus ending the long feud in the process. The following week on &quot;Impact Wrestling&quot;, Bischoff forced Jarrett to obey the match stipulations and exiled him to Mexico.

==== Backstage roles and departure (2011–2014) ====
Jarrett returned to TNA on the July 14 episode of &quot;Impact Wrestling&quot;, showing off the &quot;Mexican Heavyweight Championship&quot; belt, playing off the AAA Mega Championship he had won during his stay in Mexico. On the August 18 episode of &quot;Impact Wrestling&quot;, Jarrett aligned himself with the Mexican America stable by helping its members Anarquia and Hernandez defeat Beer Money, Inc. for the TNA World Tag Team Championship.

In October, Jarrett began feuding with the returning Jeff Hardy. On November 13 at Turning Point, Jarrett lost to Hardy three times in a row, first in six seconds, then in six minutes and finally in ten seconds. On December 11 at Final Resolution, Jarrett was defeated by Hardy in a steel cage match. As per stipulation of the match, Jarrett was, in storyline, fired from TNA on the following episode of &quot;Impact Wrestling&quot;. In reality, he was written off television to oversee Ring Ka King, a new promotion based in India that is a subsidiary of TNA.

After Ring Ka King, Jarrett wrestled for AAA without work in TNA. In 2013, Jarrett assumed the backstage role of Executive Vice President of Development/Original Programming. In 2013, Jarrett and Country star Toby Keith tried to buy TNA; however, when both met Bob Carter, he demanded that his daughter Dixie remain in the company as on-screen President. Jarrett and Keith decided to create their own company. On December 22, 2013, Jarrett resigned from TNA Entertainment. Jarrett remained an investor in TNA Wrestling after his resignation came in effect on January 6, 2014.

=== Lucha Libre AAA Worldwide (2004–2006) ===
Jarrett made his debut for Mexican promotion Lucha Libre AAA Worldwide on March 21, 2004, defeating Latin Lover to win the 2004 Rey de Reyes tournament. Over the next two years, Jarrett would make several sporadic appearances for AAA as a member of the heel stable &quot;La Legión Extranjera&quot;, before the working relationship between AAA and TNA was ended.

=== International Wrestling Association (2004–2005) ===
In 2004, the International Wrestling Association (IWA) ran an angle that satirized its main competition, the World Wrestling Council (WWC), by having a heel stable led by Ray González adopt its former name of &quot;Capitol Sports&quot; during an invasion angle. On October 9, 2004, González announced that Capitol had formed an alliance with TNA for &quot;Golpe de Estado&quot; and that this move would bring in Jarrett, then the NWA World Heavyweight Champion, Robert Roode, Konnan and Shawn Hernandez to compete on its behalf. At &quot;Golpe de Estado&quot;, Jarrett defeated Shane Sewell to retain the NWA title and help the heels gain an advantage in the series. However, González lost with Capitol and IWA tied, ending the angle. Following a face turn, González&#x27;s association with Jarrett soon concluded, leading to a feud between them. This angle concluded on April 3, 2005, when González defeated Jarrett in a titular contest to win the NWA World Heavyweight Championship. However, his reign was short, being stripped on the same event and at the time the title change was unrecognized by the NWA, with Jarrett returning to TNA with the belt. Starting in 2015, the NWA recognizes Gonzalez&#x27;s championship reign.

=== Lucha Libre AAA Worldwide (2011–2015) ===
In February 2010, TNA restarted their working relationship with AAA and in early May 2011, Jarrett made his return to AAA television, announcing his and TNA&#x27;s alignment with Dorian Roldán and his heel stable &quot;La Sociedad&quot; and their participation in Triplemanía XIX. Konnan, the co-leader of &quot;La Sociedad&quot; and former TNA worker, however, was against the idea of his former employer coming to AAA and believed that Roldán had made a mistake by inviting him to the promotion. Jarrett and Abyss arrived to AAA on May 18 for a confrontation with Konnan and &quot;La Sociedad&quot;. In the end, Jarrett and Konnan revealed that they were in fact on the same page with each other and turned on AAA Mega Champion El Zorro with Konnan announcing that Jarrett would be challenging for his title at Triplemanía XIX. On June 18 at Triplemanía XIX, Jarrett defeated El Zorro to become the new AAA Mega Champion. On July 31 at &quot;Verano de Escándalo&quot;, Jarrett successfully defended the title in a three-way elimination match against Dr. Wagner, Jr. and L.A. Park, when someone wearing El Zorro&#x27;s old mask interfered and hit Park with a guitar. This person was later revealed as &quot;La Sociedad&quot; member Chessman, whom Konnan had sent to interfere in the match in order to have Park go after El Zorro instead of continuing to chase his stablemate&#x27;s title. The storyline continued on October 9 at Héroes Inmortales, where both Jarrett and Park took part in the &quot;Copa Antonio Peña&quot; gauntlet match. After working together for the entire match, Park eventually turned on Jarrett and eliminated him. After a distraction from the Jarretts, Park was attacked by another masked El Zorro, costing him the match.

Jarrett returned to AAA on March 18, 2012, at &quot;Rey de Reyes&quot;, where he cost L.A. Park his opportunity to earn a shot at the AAA Mega Championship in the finals of the Rey de Reyes tournament. Later that same event, Jarrett lost the AAA Mega Championship to El Mesías, following interference from Park, ending his reign at 274 days, which was at the time the longest reign in the title&#x27;s history. On August 5 at &quot;Triplemanía XX&quot;, Jarrett teamed up with the debuting Kurt Angle as Team Dorian Roldán in a Hair vs. Hair match, where they faced Team Joaquín Roldán (L.A. Park and Electroshock), with the Roldáns&#x27; hairs on the line. Electroshock won the match for his team by pinning Angle, forcing Dorian to have his head shaved bald. However, after the match, the &quot;La Sociedad&quot; members overpowered the winners and shaved Joaquín bald. Jarrett made a surprise return on December 2 at &quot;Guerra de Titanes&quot;, hitting L.A. Park with a guitar, after he had escaped a six-way steel cage &quot;Lucha de Apuestas&quot;.

Jarrett&#x27;s next AAA appearance took place on June 16, 2013, at Triplemanía XXI, where he, Matt Morgan and Monster Pain defeated AAA World Trios Champions &quot;Los Psycho Circus&quot; (Monster Clown, Murder Clown and Psycho Clown) in a non-title match. On December 8 at &quot;Guerra de Titanes&quot;, Jarrett was pinned by El Mesías in an eight-man tag team main event, where he, Daga, La Parka Negra and Psicosis were defeated by El Mesías, Cibernético, El Hijo del Perro Aguayo and La Parka. Post-match, Jarrett took part in the reformation of &quot;La Sociedad&quot;.

On March 16, 2014, at &quot;Rey de Reyes&quot;, Jarrett represented &quot;La Sociedad&quot; in a six-man tag team match, where he, Máscara Año 2000 Jr. and El Texano Jr. faced Cibernético, Electroshock and Psycho Clown. At the end of the match, AAA president Joaquín Roldán hit Jarrett with his own guitar, after which he was pinned by Cibernético. Jarrett was defeated in similar fashion by Electroshock in another six-man tag team match on June 27, after which he was challenged to a Hair vs. Hair match.
On May 24, 2015, Jarrett appeared at AAA&#x27;s Lucha Libre World Cup event on behalf of his Global Force Wrestling promotion, providing English commentary for the semi-final matches of the event and scouting talent for the upcoming GFW events.

=== Wrestle-1 (2013) ===
On October 6, 2013, Jarrett went to Japan to work an event for Wrestle-1 in Tokyo&#x27;s Korakuen Hall, teaming with the promotion&#x27;s founder Keiji Mutoh and Masakatsu Funaki in a six-man tag team match, where they defeated Desperado (Masayuki Kono, Kazma Sakamoto and Ryoji Sai).

=== Global Force Wrestling (2014–2017) ===
When Jarrett left TNA, he announced intentions to create a new promotion. Jarrett revealed the promotion&#x27;s name, Global Force Wrestling (GFW), on April 7, 2014. Since the founding of GFW, Jarrett has represented the organization at TNA, NJPW, and other companies&#x27; events. Jarrett made his in-ring debut for the promotion on October 28, 2015, defeating Nathan Cruz as part of the GFW UK Invasion tour. During GFW&#x27;s return to the UK, Jarrett defeated the likes of Noam Dar, Doug Williams and Pepper Parks from March 2 to 5.

=== New Japan Pro-Wrestling (2014–2015) ===
On June 21, 2014, it was announced GFW had inked a working agreement with New Japan Pro-Wrestling (NJPW) On August 10, Jarrett made an appearance for NJPW to officially sign the agreement. Later in the event, he joined the villainous Bullet Club stable. Jarrett returned to NJPW on October 13 at King of Pro-Wrestling, where he accompanied Bullet Club stablemate A.J. Styles for his IWGP Heavyweight Championship defense. After Jarrett&#x27;s outside interference was stopped by the returning Yoshitatsu, Styles lost the title to Hiroshi Tanahashi. Jarrett made his next NJPW appearance on November 8 at Power Struggle, where he helped Styles defeat Yoshitatsu, whom he afterwards also hit with a guitar. Jarrett made his NJPW in-ring debut on January 4, 2015, at Wrestle Kingdom 9 in Tokyo Dome, where he and his Bullet Club stablemates Bad Luck Fale and Yujiro Takahashi were defeated by Hiroyoshi Tenzan, Satoshi Kojima and Tomoaki Honma, after he accidentally hit Takahashi with a guitar.

=== Total Nonstop Action Wrestling / Impact Wrestling (2015, 2017) ===
Jarrett returned to TNA on the June 24, 2015, episode of &quot;Impact Wrestling&quot;, alongside his wife Karen Jarrett; Jarrett announced that he was part of the King of the Mountain match at Slammiversary XIII, while also promoting his new promotion Global Force Wrestling (GFW). Jarrett would win his record third King of the Mountain match, thus capturing the newly reactivated and renamed TNA King of the Mountain Championship on June 28 stating that he would be taking the belt to GFW. On August 12, Jarrett was appointed &quot;Impact Wrestling&quot;&#x27;s new authority figure by TNA President Dixie Carter after General Manager Bully Ray was attacked, which led to Jarrett vacating the King of the Mountain Championship. The week after, it was revealed that Karen Jarrett orchestrated the attacks on Bully Ray and Drew Galloway, claiming that TNA was her husband&#x27;s company and that he deserved it. Jarrett turned his back on Carter, choosing to align with his wife and turning heel in the process. On the September 16 episode of &quot;Impact Wrestling&quot;, Carter made a challenge to Jarrett, putting her TNA shares up against his for full control of the company, by setting up a 10-man tag team match. It was later reported that Jarrett had sold his minority stake to Panda Energy. On the September 16 edition of &quot;Impact Wrestling&quot;, Team TNA (Galloway, Lashley, Eddie Edwards, Bram and Davey Richards) defeated Team GFW (Sonjay Dutt, Jeff Jarrett, Eric Young, Chris Mordetzky and Brian Myers) in a Lethal Lockdown Match, resulting in Dixie gaining possession of Jarrett&#x27;s TNA stake and, as a result, full control of TNA.

On January 5, 2017, it was announced that Jarrett had rejoined Impact Wrestling, now under the ownership of Anthem Sports &amp; Entertainment In April 2017, Jarrett stated that Impact Wrestling and Global Force Wrestling were &quot;becoming one day by day.&quot; On June 28, it was reported that Impact Wrestling had acquired Global Force Wrestling. On September 5, it was announced that Jarrett would be taking an &quot;indefinite leave of absence&quot; from GFW. On October 23, Impact Wrestling confirmed the termination of its relationship with Jarrett and his company Global Force Entertainment Inc.

Shortly after the Anthem termination of its relationship with Jarrett and his company Global Force Entertainment Inc, Anthem would still continue to use GFW&#x27;s tape library with them using the shows One Night Only: GFW Amped Anthology and the promotion reverted to the Impact Wrestling name as Jarrett owned the rights to GFW. During the time of the rebranding, the company had been named Impact Wrestling after its flagship program, and had assumed the name of Global Force Wrestling (GFW). The Global Wrestling Network (GWN) name had been influenced by its connection to GFW. In October Impact Wrestling launched the streaming service named Global Wrestling Network despite Jarrett owning the GFW rights. On August 14, 2018, Jarrett and his company Global Force Entertainment announced that it had filed a lawsuit against Impact Wrestling&#x27;s parent company Anthem Sports &amp; Entertainment in the District Court of Tennessee for copyright infringement over the GFW rights, as Jarrett owned all Global Force Wrestling properties since its creation in 2014. If the lawsuit by Jarrett is successful, Impact would need to immediately suspend the operations of their streaming subscription service under its current name and the company would have to censor the GFW name in their content. A mistrial was declared in July 2020 and the lawsuit was not successful as the belief from the neutral judge was that Jarrett infiltrated the jury. The two sides ultimately agreed to a settlement in January 2021.

== Personal life ==

Jarrett married his &quot;high school sweetheart&quot; Jill Gregory on November 14, 1992, with whom he had three daughters. Jill died of breast cancer on May 23, 2007. In 2009, it was reported that Jarrett was romantically linked to Karen Angle. This resulted in TNA president Dixie Carter placing Jarrett on a leave of absence. In 2009, Jarrett returned to TNA, using the real-life situation briefly as a storyline. On April 6, 2010, Jarrett and Karen announced their engagement; they were married on August 21, 2010.

Jarrett and his father Jerry reconciled in 2015, after years since having a falling-out over the business in TNA.

Days earlier Real Canadian Wrestling promoter Steven Ewaschuk had claimed that Jarrett had showed up to their event late and intoxicated and then continued drinking until passing out in their locker room prior to his match. Jarrett went on to wrestle the first of his two scheduled matches, but boarded a plane home before the second event.

While Jarrett was living in Nashville in the 2000&#x27;s, he became family friends with Taylor Swift when they were neighbors through mutual friends, with Taylor babysitting for Jarrett&#x27;s family when he was busy with meetings with TNA. &quot;Taylor would come over and get the girls and take them back to her house and they&#x27;d bake cookies and all kind of stuff. One day, Taylor brought over Joe Jonas... Not only is she uber-creative as an artist, she thinks like a businesswoman. Those two skillsets combined, you rarely see. She deserves all the success she has.&quot;

<doc id="918596" wikidata="Q2699712" url="?curid=918596" title="Cercocarpus">
<text>Cercocarpus, commonly known as mountain mahogany, is a small genus of at least nine species of nitrogen-fixing flowering plants in the rose family, Rosaceae. They are native to the western United States and northern Mexico, where they grow in chaparral and semidesert habitats and climates, often at high altitudes. Several are found in the California chaparral and woodlands ecoregion.
The classification of &quot;Cercocarpus&quot; within the Rosaceae has been unclear. The genus has been placed in the subfamily Rosoideae, but is now placed in subfamily Dryadoideae.

Members of the genus are deciduous shrubs or small trees, typically reaching heights of 3–6 m (9–18 ft) tall, but exceptionally up to 13 m (40 ft) high. &quot;C. montanus&quot; usually remains under 1 m (3 ft) high because of incessant grazing by elk and deer.

The name is derived from the Greek words κέρκος (&quot;kerkos&quot;), meaning &quot;tail&quot; and καρπός (&quot;karpos&quot;), meaning &quot;fruit&quot;. It refers to the tail-like plume on the fruits.

<text>Julian Pauncefote, 1st Baron Pauncefote (13 September 1828 – 24 May 1902), known as Sir Julian Pauncefote between 1874 and 1899, was a British barrister, judge and diplomat. He was Permanent Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs between 1882 and 1889 when he was appointed Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary to the United States and would be the last to use that title, as the office was upgraded to that of Ambassador to the United States in 1893. Elevated to the peerage as Baron Pauncefote in 1899, he died in office in 1902.

==Origins==
Descended in the male line from the prominent Smith family of bankers, who established Smith&#x27;s Bank in Nottingham in 1658, he was born in Munich, Bavaria, the son of Robert &quot;Pauncefote&quot; (born &quot;Robert Smith&quot;) by his wife Emma Smith, a daughter of the painter John Raphael Smith (no apparent relation to the Smith bankers). His father (who in 1809 assumed the surname of &quot;Pauncefote&quot; in lieu of his patronymic) was the grandson of John Smith (born 1716), next younger brother of Sir George Smith, 1st Baronet (1714–1769) of Stoke Hall, East Stoke in Nottinghamshire (whose first wife Mary Howe was a co-heiress of the Pauncefote family of Preston, near Dymock, in Gloucestershire), and elder brother of Abel Smith II (1717–1788), ancestor of the Barons Carrington and the Barons Bicester.

==Legal career==

He was educated at Paris, Geneva, and Marlborough College. Intending to join the British Indian Army, he obtained a commission in the Madras Light Cavalry, but never took up his post, instead being called to the bar in 1852, after which he practiced as a conveyancing barrister. In July 1855, Pauncefote briefly became private secretary to Sir William Molesworth, Secretary of State for the Colonies at the time. His appointment lasted only short period ending with Molesworth&#x27;s death in October that same year.

In 1862, facing crippling financial losses, Pauncefote decided to go and practise as a barrister in Hong Kong. In 1865 he was appointed acting Attorney General and in 1866 became the Attorney General of Hong Kong. Ex officio he served as acting Chief Justice and acting Puisne Judge on a number of occasions.

In Hong Kong, Pauncefote was involved in a major case involving the rights of enslaved coolies to free themselves. He ended up being sued for false imprisonment in the Supreme Court of Hong Kong. In 1871, Kwok A Sing, a coolie on board a French ship the Nouvelle Penelope which had sailed from Macau, killed the master and took over the ship. Kwok was arrested in Hong Kong to be extradited to China. Kwok made a habeas corpus application seeking his release. Chief Justice John Jackson Smale ordered his release on the basis that Kwok was entitled to take any necessary steps to secure his freedom. Pauncefote, as Attorney General of Hong Kong, then had Kwok re-arrested to be tried for piracy. Smale again ordered Kwok&#x27;s release on the basis the second arrest breached the first habeas corpus order. Kwok then sued Pauncefote for damages for false imprisonment under the Habeas Corpus Act. Kwok almost won with the British jury finding 4–3 in Kwok&#x27;s favour. Because a majority of five was needed to find in Kwok&#x27;s favour the verdict was treated as a verdict for Pauncefote. In 1874, Pauncefote was appointed Chief Justice of the Leeward Islands and was knighted.

==Diplomatic career==
In 1876, Pauncefote returned to London as Assistant Permanent Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies. He soon transferred to the Foreign Office where he took over the same post at the Foreign Office in 1876. Having been made Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George (KCMG) in 1879 and a Companion of the Order of the Bath (CB) the following year, Pauncefote was promoted Permanent Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs in 1882. He was appointed first British delegate to the Suez Canal Conference in Paris in 1885, and was rewarded for his services in this respect with appointment as a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of St Michael and St George (GCMG). In 1888, he became a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath (KCB), and the following year was sent to the United States as Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary. His position was elevated in 1893 to Ambassador, and it made him the Dean of the Diplomatic Corps because Ambassador is superior to all other Envoys dispatched by other countries. He and American secretary of state Richard Olney in January 1897 negotiated an arbitration treaty, but the U.S. Senate, jealous of its prerogatives, refused to ratify it.

He was Britain&#x27;s representative at negotiations and signatory of the Tripartite Convention in 1899 that partitioned the Samoan islands. In 1901 he negotiated the Hay–Pauncefote Treaty (with American Secretary of State John Hay), nullifying the Clayton–Bulwer Treaty of 1850, giving the United States the right to create and control a canal across Central America.

Having finally become a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath (GCB) in 1892, Pauncefote the following year became the first British Ambassador to the United States. He was sworn of the Privy Council in 1894 and raised to the peerage as Baron Pauncefote, &quot;of Preston, Dymock in the County of Gloucester&quot;, in 1899. Preston Hall, near Dymock, in Gloucestershire, was a former seat of the Pauncefote family.

==Marriage and issue==

In 1859 he married Selina Cubitt, a daughter of William Cubitt, by whom he had one son, who died as an infant, and four daughters, including:
*Lilian Pauncefote (1875–1963), youngest daughter, who on 24 February 1900 married her distant kinsman Sir Robert Bromley, 6th Baronet (1874–1906) of Stoke Hall, East Stoke in Nottinghamshire (descended in the male line from Sir George Smith, 1st Baronet (1714–1769)), honorary attaché to the British embassy in Washington. The wedding at St John&#x27;s Episcopal Church in Washington DC was officiated by the Bishop of Washington, in the presence of cabinet members, diplomats and other distinguished guests. Lavish gifts were provided by the Rothschilds, the Vandebilts, Andrew Carnegie and Mr Choate.

==Death==

Lord Pauncefote died in office at the British Embassy in Washington, D.C. in May 1902, aged 73. His formal state funeral took place at St John&#x27;s Episcopal Church in Washington, where his daughter had been married. His remains were transferred back to the United Kingdom in the , and were buried in the churchyard of St Oswald&#x27;s Church, East Stoke in Nottinghamshire on 15 July 1902. The peerage became extinct at his death as he left no surviving male heirs.

<doc id="918609" wikidata="Q6980740" url="?curid=918609" title="Natural numbers object">
<text>In category theory, a natural numbers object (NNO) is an object endowed with a recursive structure similar to natural numbers. More precisely, in a category E with a terminal object 1, an NNO &quot;N&quot; is given by:

# a global element &quot;z&quot; : 1 → &quot;N&quot;, and
# an arrow &quot;s&quot; : &quot;N&quot; → &quot;N&quot;,

such that for any object &quot;A&quot; of E, global element &quot;q&quot; : 1 → &quot;A&quot;, and arrow &quot;f&quot; : &quot;A&quot; → &quot;A&quot;, there exists a unique arrow &quot;u&quot; : &quot;N&quot; → &quot;A&quot; such that:

# &quot;u&quot; ∘ &quot;z&quot; = &quot;q&quot;, and
# &quot;u&quot; ∘ &quot;s&quot; = &quot;f&quot; ∘ &quot;u&quot;.

In other words, the triangle and square in the following diagram commute.

The pair (&quot;q&quot;, &quot;f&quot;) is sometimes called the &quot;recursion data&quot; for &quot;u&quot;, given in the form of a recursive definition:

# ⊢ &quot;u&quot; (&quot;z&quot;) = &quot;q&quot;
# &quot;y&quot; ∈E &quot;N&quot; ⊢ &quot;u&quot; (&quot;s&quot; &quot;y&quot;) = &quot;f&quot; (&quot;u&quot; (&quot;y&quot;))

The above definition is the universal property of NNOs, meaning they are defined up to canonical isomorphism. If the arrow &quot;u&quot; as defined above merely has to exist, that is, uniqueness is not required, then &quot;N&quot; is called a &quot;weak&quot; NNO.

== Equivalent definitions ==

NNOs in cartesian closed categories (CCCs) or topoi are sometimes defined in the following equivalent way (due to Lawvere): for every pair of arrows &quot;g&quot; : &quot;A&quot; → &quot;B&quot; and &quot;f&quot; : &quot;B&quot; → &quot;B&quot;, there is a unique &quot;h&quot; : &quot;N&quot; × &quot;A&quot; → &quot;B&quot; such that the squares in the following diagram commute.

This same construction defines weak NNOs in cartesian categories that are not cartesian closed.

In a category with a terminal object 1 and binary coproducts (denoted by +), an NNO can be defined as the initial algebra of the endofunctor that acts on objects by and on arrows by .

== Properties ==

* Every NNO is an initial object of the category of diagrams of the form
::formula_1

* If a cartesian closed category has weak NNOs, then every slice of it also has a weak NNO.
* NNOs can be used for non-standard models of type theory in a way analogous to non-standard models of analysis. Such categories (or topoi) tend to have &quot;infinitely many&quot; non-standard natural numbers. (Like always, there are simple ways to get non-standard NNOs; for example, if &quot;z&quot; = &quot;s z&quot;, in which case the category or topos E is trivial.)
* Freyd showed that &quot;z&quot; and &quot;s&quot; form a coproduct diagram for NNOs; also, !&quot;N&quot; : &quot;N&quot; → 1 is a coequalizer of &quot;s&quot; and 1&quot;N&quot;, &quot;i.e.&quot;, every pair of global elements of &quot;N&quot; are connected by means of &quot;s&quot;; furthermore, this pair of facts characterize all NNOs.

== Examples ==

* In Set, the category of sets, the standard natural numbers are an NNO. A terminal object in Set is a singleton, and a function out of a singleton picks out a single element of a set. The natural numbers 𝐍 are an NNO where is a function from a singleton to 𝐍 whose image is zero, and is the successor function. (We could actually allow to pick out &quot;any&quot; element of 𝐍, and the resulting NNO would be isomorphic to this one.) One can prove that the diagram in the definition commutes using mathematical induction.
* In the category of types of Martin-Löf type theory (with types as objects and functions as arrows), the standard natural numbers type nat is an NNO. One can use the recursor for nat to show that the appropriate diagram commutes.
* Assume that formula_2 is a Grothendieck topos with terminal object formula_3 and that formula_4 for some Grothendieck topology formula_5 on the category formula_6. Then if formula_7 is the constant presheaf on formula_6, then the NNO in formula_2 is the sheafification of formula_7 and may be shown to take the form formula_11

<text>Anton Zeilinger (; born 20 May 1945) is an Austrian quantum physicist and Nobel laureate in physics of 2022. Zeilinger is professor of physics emeritus at the University of Vienna and senior scientist at the Institute for Quantum Optics and Quantum Information of the Austrian Academy of Sciences. Most of his research concerns the fundamental aspects and applications of quantum entanglement.

In 2007, Zeilinger received the first Inaugural Isaac Newton Medal of the Institute of Physics, London, for &quot;his pioneering conceptual and experimental contributions to the foundations of quantum physics, which have become the cornerstone for the rapidly-evolving field of quantum information&quot;. In October 2022, he received the Nobel Prize in Physics, jointly with Alain Aspect and John Clauser for their work involving experiments with entangled photons, establishing the violation of Bell inequalities and pioneering quantum information science.

== Early life and education ==
Anton Zeilinger was born in 1945 in Ried im Innkreis, Upper Austria, Austria. He studied physics at the University of Vienna from 1963 to 1971. He received a doctorate from the University of Vienna in 1971, with a thesis on &quot;Neutron depolarization measurements on a Dy-single crystal&quot; under Helmut Rauch. He qualified as a university lecturer (habilitation) at the Vienna University of Technology in 1979.

== Career ==

In the 1970s, Zeilinger worked at the Vienna Atominstitut as a research assistant and later as an associate researcher at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Neutron Diffraction Laboratory until 1979, when he accepted the position of assistant professor at the same Atominstitut. That year he qualified as a university professor at the Vienna University of Technology.

In 1981 Zeilinger returned to MIT, as an associate professor on the physics faculty, until 1983. Between 1980 and 1990 he worked as a professor at the Vienna University of Technology, the Technical University of Munich, the University of Innsbruck and the University of Vienna.

He was also the scientific director of the Institute for Quantum Optics and Quantum Information in Vienna between 2004 and 2013. Zeilinger became professor emeritus at the University of Vienna in 2013. He was president of the Austrian Academy of Sciences from 2013 till 2022.

Since 2006, Zeilinger is the vice chairman of the board of trustees of the Institute of Science and Technology Austria, an ambitious project initiated by Zeilinger&#x27;s proposal. In 2009, he founded the International Academy Traunkirchen, which is dedicated to the support of gifted students in science and technology. He is a fan of the &quot;Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide To The Galaxy&quot; by Douglas Adams, going so far as to name his sailboat 42.

==Research==
===Quantum teleportation===
Zeilinger published one of the first realizations of quantum teleportation of an independent qubit. He later expanded this work to developing a source for freely propagating teleported qubits and quantum teleportation over 144 kilometers between two Canary Islands. Quantum teleportation is an essential concept in many quantum information protocols. Besides its role for the transfer of quantum information, it is also considered as an important possible mechanism for building gates within quantum computers.

===Entanglement swapping – teleportation of entanglement===
Entanglement swapping is the teleportation of an entangled state. After its proposal, entanglement swapping was first realized experimentally by Zeilinger&#x27;s group in 1998. It was then applied to carry out a delayed-choice entanglement swapping test. 

===Entanglement beyond two qubits – GHZ-states and their realizations===

Anton Zeilinger contributed to the opening up of the field of multi-particle entanglement. In 1990, he was the first with Daniel Greenberger and Michael Horne to work on entanglement of more than two qubits. The resulting GHZ theorem (see Greenberger–Horne–Zeilinger state) is fundamental for quantum physics, as it provides the most succinct contradiction between local realism and the predictions of quantum mechanics.

GHZ states were the first instances of multi-particle entanglement ever investigated. 

Finally, in 1999, he succeeded in providing the first experimental evidence of entanglement beyond two particles and also the first test of quantum nonlocality for GHZ states. 

===Quantum communication, quantum cryptography, quantum computation===

In 1998 (published in 2000), his group was the first to implement quantum cryptography with entangled photons. He then applied quantum entanglement to optical quantum computation, where in 2005, he performed the first implementation of one-way quantum computation. This is a protocol based on quantum measurement as proposed by Knill, Laflamme and Milburn. 

The experiments of Zeilinger and his group on the distribution of entanglement over large distances began with both free-space and fiber-based quantum communication and teleportation between laboratories located on the different sides of the river Danube. This was then extended to larger distances across the city of Vienna and over 144 km between two Canary Islands, resulting in a successful demonstration that quantum communication with satellites is feasible. His dream is to put sources of entangled light onto a satellite in orbit. A first step was achieved during an experiment at the Italian .

===Further novel entangled states===
With his group, Anton Zeilinger made many contributions to the realization of novel entangled states. The source for polarization-entangled photon pairs developed with Paul Kwiat when he was a PostDoc in Zeilinger&#x27;s group is used in many laboratories. The first demonstration of entanglement of orbital angular momentum of photons opened up a new field of research in many laboratories.

===Macroscopic quantum superposition===
Zeilinger is also interested to extend quantum mechanics into the macroscopic domain. In the early 1990s, he started experiments in the field of atom optics. He developed a number of ways to coherently manipulate atomic beams, many of which, like the coherent energy shift of an atomic De Broglie wave upon diffraction at a time-modulated light wave, have become part of today&#x27;s ultracold atom experiments. In 1999, Zeilinger abandoned atom optics for experiments with very complex and massive macro-molecules – fullerenes. The successful demonstration of quantum interference for these C60 and C70 molecules in 1999 opened up a very active field of research. 

In 2005, Zeilinger with his group investigated the quantum physics of mechanical cantilevers. In the year 2006 along with Heidmann in Paris and Kippenberg in Garching they demonstrated experimentally the self-cooling of a micro-mirror by radiation pressure, that is, without feedback. 

Using orbital angular momentum states, he was able to demonstrate entanglement of angular momentum up to 300 ħ.

===Further fundamental tests===
Zeilinger&#x27;s program of fundamental tests of quantum mechanics is aimed at implementing experimental realizations of many non-classical features of quantum physics for individual systems. In 1998, he provided the final test of Bell&#x27;s inequality closing the communication loophole by using superfast random number generators. His group also realized the first Bell inequality experiment implementing the freedom-of-choice condition and provided the first realization of a Bell test without the fair sampling assumption for photons. 

Among the further fundamental tests he performed the most notable one is his test of a large class of nonlocal realistic theories proposed by Leggett. The group of theories excluded by that experiment can be classified as those which allow reasonable subdivision of ensembles into sub-ensembles. It goes significantly beyond Bell&#x27;s theorem. While Bell showed that a theory which is both local and realistic is at variance with quantum mechanics, Leggett considered nonlocal realistic theories where the individual photons are assumed to carry polarization. The resulting Leggett inequality was shown to be violated in the experiments of the Zeilinger group.

In an analogous way, his group showed that even quantum systems where entanglement is not possible exhibit non-classical features which cannot be explained by underlying non-contextual probability distributions.

===Neutron interferometry===
Anton Zeilinger&#x27;s earliest work is perhaps his least known. His work on neutron interferometry has provided a foundation for his later research.

As a member of the group of his thesis supervisor, Helmut Rauch, at the Technical University of Vienna, Zeilinger participated in a number of neutron interferometry experiments at the Institut Laue–Langevin (ILL) in Grenoble. His very first such experiment confirmed a fundamental prediction of quantum mechanics, the sign change of a spinor phase upon rotation. This was followed by the first experimental realization of coherent spin superposition of matter waves. He continued his work in neutron interferometry at MIT with C.G. Shull (Nobel Laureate), focusing specifically on dynamical diffraction effects of neutrons in perfect crystals which are due to multi-wave coherent superposition. After his return to Europe, he built up an interferometer for very cold neutrons which preceded later similar experiments with atoms. The fundamental experiments there included a most precise test of the linearity of quantum mechanics. Zeilinger built a double-slit diffraction experiment on the S18 instrument at the Institut Laue-Langevin which, later on, gained in accuracy and could act with only one neutron at a time in the apparatus.

<text>Michael Lyle &quot;Mike&quot; Shine (born September 19, 1953 in Youngsville, Pennsylvania) is a former United States Olympic athlete. At the 1976 Summer Olympics held in Montreal, he earned the silver medal in the 400 m men&#x27;s hurdles, behind Edwin Moses, who set the world record and effectively opened a new chapter in the event in that race.

He was notable for using a 15 step pattern the entire race, unheard of at the elite level. 
Leroy Walker, the Coach of the &#x27;76 Team, was shocked when he asked me what step pattern I used and I told him fifteen all the way. He said, &#x27;You can&#x27;t possibly run the kind of splits that you need to be competitive at this level.&#x27; My 200m splits used to be right around 21.3-21.5! I guess I was good enough for a second in 48.69.&quot;
Shine was born and raised in Youngsville, Pennsylvania, near Warren, Pennsylvania. He attended Youngsville High School and ran track. He went on to college at the Pennsylvania State University.

Shine served as an assistant track coach at the United States Military Academy under John Randolph for a few years beginning in 1977. He coached hurdlers and 400 meter runners, while continuing to train competitively in his event. He was an athlete affected by the 1980 US Olympic boycott.

<doc id="918643" wikidata="Q637321" url="?curid=918643" title="Washer (hardware)">
<text>A washer is a thin plate (typically disk-shaped, but sometimes square) with a hole (typically in the middle) that is normally used to distribute the load of a threaded fastener, such as a bolt or nut. Other uses are as a spacer, spring (Belleville washer, wave washer), wear pad, preload indicating device, locking device, and to reduce vibration (rubber washer).

Washers are usually metal or plastic. High-quality bolted joints require hardened steel washers to prevent the loss of pre-load due to brinelling after the torque is applied. Washers are also important for preventing galvanic corrosion, particularly by insulating steel screws from aluminium surfaces. They may also be used in rotating applications, as a bearing. A &quot;thrust washer&quot; is used when a rolling element bearing is not needed either from a cost-performance perspective or due to space restraints. Coatings can be used to reduce wear and friction, either by hardening the surface or by providing a solid lubricant (i.e. a self-lubricating surface).

The origin of the word is unknown. The first recorded use of the word was in 1346; however, the first time its definition was recorded was in 1611.

Rubber or fiber gaskets used in taps (or faucets, valves, and other piping connections) as seal against water leaks are sometimes referred to colloquially as &quot;washers&quot;; but, while they may look similar, washers and gaskets are usually designed for different functions and made differently.

==Washer types==
Most washers can be categorized into three broad types; 
* &quot;Plain washers&quot;, which spread a load, and prevent damage to the surface being fixed, or provide some sort of insulation such as electrical
* &quot;Spring washers&quot;, which have axial flexibility and are used to prevent fastening or loosening due to vibrations
* &quot;Locking washers&quot;, which prevent fastening or loosening by preventing unscrewing rotation of the fastening device; locking washers are usually also spring washers.

===Plain washers===
===Spring and locking washers===

Lock washers, locknuts, jam nuts, and thread-locking fluid are ways to prevent vibration from loosening a bolted joint.

===Gaskets===
The term washer is often applied to various gasket types such as those used to seal the control valve in taps.

===Specialised types===
The DIN 125 metric washer standard refers to subtypes A and B. ISO 7089 calls these Form A and ISO 7090 calls them Form B. They are all the same overall size, but Form B is chamfered on one side.

==Materials==
Washers can be fabricated from a variety of materials including, but not limited to:
* Steel – Carbon steel, spring steel, A2 (304) stainless steel, and A4 (316/316L) stainless steel
* Non-ferrous metal – Copper, brass, aluminium, titanium, iron, bronze, and zinc
* Alloy – Silicon bronze, Inconel, Monel, and Hastelloy
* Plastic – Thermoplastics and thermosetting polymers such as polyethylene, PTFE (Teflon)
* Nylon – Nylon 6, Nylon 66, Nylatron, and Tecamid MDS
* Specialty – Fibers, ceramics, rubber, felt, leather, bimetals, and mica
*Phenolic – The material has good electrical insulation, is lightweight, tough, has low moisture absorption, is heat resistant, and is resistant to chemicals and corrosion. Phenolic washers are substitutes for flat metallic washers in cases where electrical insulation is required. Phenolic washers are stamped out of large sheets of the phenolic material. The term &quot;phenolic washer&quot; is sometimes used for stamped washers from laminated materials such as paper, canvas, and Mylar.

=== Corrosion resistance ===
A number of techniques are used to enhance the corrosion resistant properties of certain washer materials:
* Metallic coatings – Typical coatings used to produce corrosion resistant washers are zinc, cadmium, and nickel. Zinc coating acts as a sacrificial surface layer that falls victim to corrosive materials before the washer&#x27;s material can be harmed. Cadmium produces a high-quality protective surface but is toxic, both biologically and environmentally. Nickel coatings add protection from corrosion only when the finish is dense and non-porous.
* Electroplating – This method involves coating the washer by electrolytic deposition using metals such as chromium or silver.
* Phosphating – A resilient, but abrasive surface is achieved by incorporating a zinc-phosphate layer and corrosion-protective oil. 
* Browning or bluing – Exposing the washer (typically steel) to a chemical compound or alkali salt solution causes an oxidizing chemical reaction, which results in the creation of a corrosion-resistant, colored surface. The integrity of the coating can be improved by treating the finished product with a water-displacing oil.
* Chemical plating – This technique utilizes a nickel-phosphor alloy that is precipitated onto the washer surface, creating an extremely corrosion- and abrasive-resistant surface.

==Type and form==
The American National Standards Institute (ANSI) provides standards for general use flat washers. Type A is a series of steel washers at broad tolerances, where precision is not critical. Type B is a series of flat washers with tighter tolerances where outside diameters are categorized as &quot;narrow&quot;, &quot;regular&quot; or &quot;wide&quot; for specific bolt sizes.

&quot;Type&quot; is not to be confused with &quot;form&quot; (but often is). The British Standard for Metric Series Metal Washers (BS4320), written in 1968, coined the term &quot;form&quot;. The forms go from A to G and dictate the outside diameter and thickness of the flat washers.
* Form A: Normal diameter, normal thickness
* Form B: Normal diameter, light thickness
* Form C: Large diameter, normal thickness
* Form D: Large diameter, light thickness
* Form E: Normal diameter, normal thickness
* Form F: Large diameter, normal thickness
* Form G: Largest diameter, larger thickness.Washer &#x27;form&#x27; when comparing different washer material types is used quite freely by stockists. In relation to BS4320 specifically, washer forms &#x27;A&#x27; to &#x27;D&#x27; inclusive are designated &#x27;bright metal&#x27; washers and are supplied self-finished in various metals including: steel alloys, brass, copper, etc. Whereas, BS4320 washer forms &#x27;E&#x27; to &#x27;G&#x27; inclusive are designated &#x27;black&#x27; (uncoated) mild steel washers, which normally are specified with a supplementary protective coating supply condition.

== Standard metric flat washers sizes ==
Washers of standard metric sizes equivalent to BS4320 Form A are listed in the table below. Measurements in the table refer to the dimensions of the washers as described by the drawing. Specifications for standard metric flat washers were known as DIN 125 (withdrawn) and replaced with ISO 7089. DIN (Deutsches Institut für Normung - German Institute for Standardization) standards are issued for a variety of components including industrial fasteners as Metric DIN 125 Flat Washers. The DIN standards remain common in Germany, Europe and globally even though the transition to ISO standards is taking place. DIN standards continue to be used for parts which do not have ISO equivalents or for which there is no need for standardization.

<doc id="918652" wikidata="Q454178" url="?curid=918652" title="Michael O'Leary (politician)">
<text>Michael O&#x27;Leary (8 May 1936 – 11 May 2006) was an Irish judge, politician and barrister who served as a Judge of the District Court from 1997 to 2006, Tánaiste and Minister for Energy from 1981 to 1982, Leader of the Labour Party from 1981 to 1982 and Minister for Labour from 1973 to 1977. He served as a Teachta Dála (TD) from 1965 to 1987. He was a Member of the European Parliament (MEP) from 1979 to 1981.

He resigned from the Labour Party in 1982 to join Fine Gael.

==Early life==
O&#x27;Leary was born in Cork in 1936, the son of a publican. He was educated at Presentation College, University College Cork, Columbia University, and King&#x27;s Inns. On returning to Ireland, he became involved in the Labour Party and was employed as an Education Officer for the Irish Transport and General Workers&#x27; Union (ITGWU). In this role he was instrumental in establishing the Universities Branch, affiliated to Dublin North-Central constituency, bringing together Labour Party students of the Dublin University Fabian Society in Trinity College Dublin and of University College Dublin.

==Political career==
O&#x27;Leary was first elected to Dáil Éireann as a Labour Party TD for Dublin North-Central at the 1965 general election. His agent was Bob Mitchell, Chairman of Dublin University Fabian Society, who could claim credit in a dirty campaign for picking up transfers to squeeze out the Labour Party front-runner on the 11th recount.

When he was first elected to the Dáil, O&#x27;Leary encouraged the Labour Party to take a more left-wing stance in its policies. He was initially strongly opposed to the idea of a coalition with Fine Gael, but following the 1969 general election he believed that there was a need for a new approach. When the Labour Party and Fine Gael formed the National Coalition government following the 1973 general election he was appointed Minister for Labour.

In 1977, he was narrowly defeated by Frank Cluskey for the leadership of the party. O&#x27;Leary was elected to the European Parliament for the Dublin constituency in 1979.

Cluskey resigned as Labour Party leader when he lost his Dáil seat at the 1981 general election and O&#x27;Leary was elected unanimously to succeed him. In the short-lived Fine Gael–Labour Party government of 1981 to 1982, O&#x27;Leary became Tánaiste and Minister for Energy. After the government&#x27;s defeat at the February 1982 general election he remained leader until he suddenly resigned both the leadership and his party membership on 28 October, in the aftermath of a party conference vote on a potential coalition with Fine Gael. On 3 November he joined Fine Gael. At the November 1982 general election, he was elected a Fine Gael TD in the Dublin South-West constituency. After the election, a new Fine Gael–Labour government was formed, but O&#x27;Leary was kept out of cabinet office by his former Labour colleagues.

In 1985, O&#x27;Leary introduced a private member&#x27;s bill on divorce which preceded the government&#x27;s own 1986 divorce referendum.

When the Progressive Democrats were formed in 1985 he considered joining but remained with Fine Gael.

He did not contest the 1987 general election and afterwards, he moved back to Cork and practised as a barrister. He was elected as a Fine Gael member of Cork City Council at the 1991 local elections. He unsuccessfully contested the 1992 general election in Cork North-Central and received about 2% of the valid poll.

He was appointed a District Court judge in 1997 by the Fine Gael–Labour Party–Democratic Left coalition government.

==Death==
O&#x27;Leary died in France in May 2006, following a drowning accident in a swimming pool. He was on holiday, having retired as a judge just days earlier.

<text>Michael Kevin O&#x27;Leary (born 20 March 1961) is an Irish businessman who is the Group CEO of Ryanair. With a net worth of around €848.6 million as of April 2018, he is one of Ireland&#x27;s wealthiest businesspeople.

==Early life==
Michael Kevin O&#x27;Leary was born in Kanturk, County Cork, Ireland, on 20 March 1961, the second child of Gerarda and Timothy &quot;Ted&quot; O&#x27;Leary. He grew up near Mullingar, County Westmeath. His father was the part-owner of a textile factory. He was educated at Clongowes Wood College near Clane, County Kildare, before studying business and economics at Trinity College Dublin. After graduating in 1982, he worked as a trainee with Stokes Kennedy Crowley (later known as KPMG) and studied the Irish tax system. He left after two years in 1985, setting up profitable newsagents in the Terenure and Walkinstown areas of Dublin. 

While at Stokes Kennedy Crowley, O&#x27;Leary had met Tony Ryan, head of Guinness Peat Aviation (GPA), a leasing company. Ryan was one of KPMG&#x27;s clients and O&#x27;Leary advised Ryan on his personal income tax affairs. In 1988, Ryan hired O&#x27;Leary as his personal financial and tax advisor, where Ryan&#x27;s main interest was in GPA.

==Ryanair career==
O&#x27;Leary became chief financial officer of Ryanair in 1988, and then chief executive officer in 1994.

Under O&#x27;Leary&#x27;s management, Ryanair further developed the low-cost model originated by Southwest Airlines. O&#x27;Leary described the ancillary revenue model in a 2001 interview, saying &quot;The other airlines are asking how they can put up fares. We are asking how we could get rid of them.&quot; The business model envisioned by O&#x27;Leary uses receipts from onboard shopping, internet gaming, car hire and hotel bookings to supplement the ticket revenue from selling airline seats. Savings are also made by negotiating discounts with airports for reduced landing fees. In many cases, regional airports have made no charges so as to secure flights that bring passengers and wealth into their area. The deregulation of Ireland&#x27;s major airports and a transformation of traditional full-service airlines are among his demands.

As CEO of Ryanair, O&#x27;Leary developed a reputation for foul language and for making comments which he later contradicts. He is known for being outspoken in his public statements, and for sometimes resorting to personal attacks and foul language. He was reported to have been aggressive and hostile in dealings with a woman who was awarded free flights for life in 1988.

In 2002, O&#x27;Leary said that his company is against any long-haul transatlantic services: &quot;The low-cost model only really works for short-haul flights. [...] If we started flying farther afield, we&#x27;d have to do something stupid like introducing what I call a &#x27;rich class&#x27; to make it pay.&quot; However, while at the 2013 Paris Air Show, he said that he wanted to sell cheap flights from the U.S. to Europe for as low as 10 euros ($13) or $10, if conditions were right. He said that he needed a fleet of at least 30 twin-aisle aircraft and access to ports (e.g. major U.S. and European cities. In the airline industry there are so called slots or sometimes gates, often regulated by law, and without obtaining them it is impossible to have regular service to airports). Despite his claims in 2002, there were so called budget airlines in the past who serve long haul routes – for example Laker Airways flights from London to New York in the late 1970s or long-hauls at budget-fares on other continents like AirAsiaX in Malaysia and the Australian Jetstar Group.

In 2003, O&#x27;Leary purchased a taxi license plate for his Mercedes-Benz S-Class under the name O&#x27;Leary Cabs, enabling it to be classified as a taxi so that he could legally make use of Dublin&#x27;s bus lanes to speed up his car journeys around the city. A press report suggested that since he had stopped driving his own taxi, he has employed a driver with full PSV licence. In 2005, the Irish transport minister expressed concern at this abuse by O&#x27;Leary and others.

In 2007, O&#x27;Leary was forced to retract a claim that Ryanair had cut emissions of carbon dioxide by half over the previous five years because the claim should have been that emissions &quot;per passenger&quot; had been cut by half. He has been reported to have impersonated a journalist in an attempt to find information passed on to a newspaper following a safety incident on a Ryanair flight. On occasion, he has apologised for personal attacks under threat of legal action. He has been criticised by a judge for lying, who said he was lucky not to be found guilty of contempt of court. He has also been criticised for dismissing concerns about climate change as &quot;complete nonsense&quot;.

Reacting to the decision to close European airspace in April 2010 over worries about the volcanic ash plume from an erupting Icelandic volcano, O&#x27;Leary falsely said, &quot;There was no ash cloud. It was mythical. It&#x27;s become evident the airspace closure was completely unnecessary.&quot; One study concluded that serious structural damage to aircraft could have occurred if passenger planes had continued to fly.

In May 2014, O&#x27;Leary was highly critical of a 24-hour strike by Aer Lingus cabin crew. Aer Lingus, whose biggest shareholder at the time was Ryanair, had to cancel 200 flights and disrupt travel plans for 200,000 people. O&#x27;Leary accused Aer Lingus of &quot;mismanagement&quot; of its employee relations, called for the sacking of a board member, and said the striking employees should be punished by having their discount travel incentives withdrawn for a year.

Participants in the Bilderberg meeting have stated that O&#x27;Leary was invited to attend the 2015 meeting. He also attended its 2017 meeting.
In February 2020, O&#x27;Leary suggested that airport security should focus on single Muslim men and called obese passengers &quot;monsters&quot;.

In June 2022, O&#x27;Leary defended Ryanair&#x27;s use of an Afrikaans language test on South African nationals flying to the UK and Ireland. However, he later withdrew his comments amid widespread criticism of Ryanair&#x27;s discriminatory policy. Notwithstanding the historical connotations of Afrikaans in South Africa during the Apartheid era, Afrikaans, along with English, is only one of the 11 official languages in South Africa.

In June 2022, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán announced that the Hungarian government would introduce an &#x27;extra profit tax&#x27; on banks and large private companies, including airlines. In response to the introduction of the tax, Ryanair has decided to retroactively pass the tax on to all passengers, increasing ticket prices by an extra €10 for intra-European destinations and €25 for non-European destinations. Michael O&#x27;Leary first called the idea of a new tax &#x27;beyond stupid&#x27;, and in a later interview, he called Economic Development Minister Márton Nagy a &#x27;complete idiot&#x27;, demanding local authorities to reverse the tax. After this, in a Euronews interview, O&#x27;Leary said the following about ministers Gergely Gulyás and Márton Nagy: &quot;These two Hungarian ministers are like Dumb and Dumber in that Jim Carrey-film, if they think people will happily pay the extra tax and choose a more expensive airline overnight&quot;.

In 2010, O&#x27;Leary stated that he thought the scientific consensus on human-caused global warming was &quot;horseshit&quot; in an interview with the Irish Independent. In 2017, O&#x27;Leary dismissed climate change as &quot;complete and utter rubbish&quot;. When asked whether that climate change is happening, O&#x27;Leary replied that the cooling and warming had been &quot;going on for years&quot; and did not accept it was linked to carbon usage. In 2021, he was less dismissive and said &quot;it is something that our customers and the people working here at Ryanair wants us to focus on and we tend to be very responsive.“

==Personal life==
O&#x27;Leary married Anita Farrell on 5 September 2003 in Delvin, County Westmeath, with whom he has four children. They live in Gigginstown House near Delvin, County Westmeath.

O&#x27;Leary breeds Aberdeen Angus cattle and horses at his Gigginstown House Stud. His horses War of Attrition, Don Cossack, Rule the World, and Tiger Roll have won races such as the Cheltenham Gold Cup, the 2016 Grand National, the 2018 Grand National, and the 2019 Grand National.

O&#x27;Leary has supported English football team Manchester City F.C. from an early age. He had the opportunity to buy a stake in the club in 2003, but believed the potential benefits did not outweigh the risk, and preferred instead to visit England to watch a few matches each season. He wore a Manchester City shirt when unveiling Ryanair&#x27;s new destinations to and from Manchester Airport in 2011.

In February 2015, O&#x27;Leary claimed that he was offered the starring role in &quot;The Apprentice&quot; reality TV show, but turned it down for family reasons before it was eventually offered to and accepted by Alan Sugar.

<doc id="918675" wikidata="Q838066" url="?curid=918675" title="M-Flo">
<text>is a Japanese hip hop group consisting of Taku Takahashi, Verbal and Lisa.

Lisa left the group in 2002 to pursue a solo career and the remaining members then started the M-Flo Loves... project working different vocalists for each song over three albums, including the likes of Crystal Kay, Namie Amuro, Bonnie Pink, Koda Kumi and BoA.

Their mainstream success and critical acclaim established them as the most iconic and influential hip-hop production team in Japan with success throughout Asia.

Taku Takahashi and Verbal also started successful side-projects outside M-Flo, such as the Teriyaki Boyz and Global Astro Alliance collaborating with international producers and artists such as Kanye West and the Beastie Boys.

In 2008, the group announced a hiatus, stating that each member would be focusing on their respective side projects. In 2012 the group ended their hiatus with the release of &quot;Square One&quot; on March 14, 2012.

On December 14, 2017, Lisa returned to the group and they announced that they will release new material in 2018. At the same time, M-Flo also released a digital compilation album called UNIVERSE to celebrate past years of the group, that contained all the 150 songs they released since their debut.
==History==

===Before M-Flo===
 and Verbal (born as Ryu Young Gi [Korean: /, Hanja: ]) first met as students at St. Mary&#x27;s International School in Tokyo. The pair collaborated in the group N.M.D., in which Takahashi was drummer and Verbal emceed, as well as throwing dance parties where they often performed together freestyle.

Following his high school graduation, Verbal attended Boston College and Gordon-Conwell Theological Seminary in Boston while Taku relocated to study in Los Angeles. They are both fluent in English and use it frequently in their songs. Following their return to Japan, the duo began performing in clubs and on television hoping to attract the attention of record companies. In 1998, Taku met Asakawa Masaji, the director of management company Artimage and DJ of the group GTS. Masaji invited Taku to produce a reworking of Barbra Streisand&#x27;s &quot;The Way We Were&quot;, with a rap by Verbal, originally intended as a GTS release. The song was released on vinyl in 1998 on Avex Trax&#x27;s Rhythm Republic indie imprint and later on the compilation album The Intergalactic Collection ~ギャラコレ~, and sold about 1000 units.

===Forming M-Flo===
Following the release of &quot;The Way We Were&quot;, Verbal and Taku invited Elizabeth Sakura Narita, who with a Colombian background is better known by her stage name of LISA, a friend while at St. Mary&#x27;s who at the time was performing under the pseudonym &quot;Unika&quot; solo and in several underground projects trying to gain credit as a musician, to collaborate with them on a second single, &quot;Been So Long&quot;, released under the name Mediarite-Flow.

The name was a re-spelling of &#x27;meteorite flow&#x27; as Verbal hoped the group would have a big impact in media and &quot;surprise the unsuspecting masses with some good music.&quot; It was shortened by the group&#x27;s label to &quot;M-Flo&quot;. The song was released on a limited-run vinyl with Rhythm Republic in 1998, attracting the attention of the major Avex Trax sublabel Rhythm Zone.

===1999–2000: Planet Shining===
The group&#x27;s first release with Rhythm Zone, &quot;The Tripod E.P.&quot;, was a Double A-side single which included a re-release of &quot;Been So Long&quot; alongside new track &quot;Flo Jack&quot; and was released on July 7, 1999. The EP gained the group a #7 position on the Oricon charts, and &quot;been so long&quot; was licensed by Konami for inclusion in beatmania IIDX alongside the songs &quot;The Rhyme Brokers&quot; and &quot;Theme from &quot;flo-jack&quot; &quot;. A further four singles were released prior to the release of the group&#x27;s first full-length album, &quot;Planet Shining&quot;, on February 23, 2000. The album reached #6 in the Oricon charts.

===2000–2002: Expo Expo, Lisa&#x27;s departure===
Following the release of the &quot;Planet Shining&quot; remix album &quot;The Replacement Percussionists&quot; in August 2000, the group released the first single from their second album, &quot;How You Like Me Now?&quot;, on September 1, 2000. In January of the following year they released &quot;Come Again&quot;, which achieved a #4 position in the Oricon charts and was their highest-selling single to date, selling 389,760 units, landing in the top 50 highest-selling singles in Japan for 2001. The group&#x27;s second album, &quot;Expo Expo&quot;, was released on March 28, 2001, and reached #3 on the Oricon charts. &quot;Expo Expo&quot; was followed with a Japanese tour, released on CD and DVD in September 2001, and an album of remixes from &quot;Expo Expo&quot;, &quot;Expo Bouei Robot Gran Sonik&quot;, in November.

Following the release of &quot;Gran Sonik&quot;, Lisa announced her departure from the group to pursue a solo career in early 2002. The split was not amicable following an argument at a TV show shoot, though Verbal has stated that it was exaggerated and did not want her to leave. He described the group as &quot;Guns N&#x27; Roses minus Axl Rose&quot; at that time.

===2003–2009: m-flo Loves...===
After a period of inactivity, during which Verbal and Taku engaged themselves in a series of side-projects, m-flo released a collection of collaborations entitled &quot;&quot; and on March 5, 2003 a fan-selected best of album, &quot;The Intergalactic Collection ~ギャラコレ~&quot;. The last track on the album hinted at the arrival of a new vocalist to replace Lisa, although the vocalist&#x27;s identity was not revealed.

Inspired by The Neptunes, On June 6, 2003, the group released a pair of collaborations with R&amp;B singer Crystal Kay, &quot;Reeewind!&quot; and &quot;I Like It&quot;. The singles were released under the names &quot;M-Flo Loves Crystal Kay&quot; and &quot;Crystal Kay Loves M-Flo&quot; respectively and both charted in the top 10, providing Crystal Kay with her highest-selling single to date. &quot;Reeewind!&quot; began a string of collaborations that spanned four years and three albums.

2004&#x27;s &quot;Astromantic&quot; featured collaborations with top names in Japanese pop, jazz, R&amp;B and electronica including Chemistry, Double and Ryuichi Sakamoto and rose to number 2 on the Oricon charts and to number 17 on the World Charts. The album was supported by a live DVD and remix album &quot;Astromantic Charm School&quot;. The album provided the group with its highest-selling single since &quot;come again&quot;. The group&#x27;s collaboration with Korean singer BoA, &quot;the Love Bug&quot;, reached number 8 on Oricon charts.

The group released their follow-up album &quot;Beat Space Nine&quot; in 2005. The record featured a heavier electronic sound than the jazz-oriented &quot;Astromantic&quot; and included collaborations with Kahimi Karie and Akiko Wada. The album&#x27;s final track, &quot;Tripod Baby&quot;, included a cameo by former m-flo vocalist Lisa. &quot;Beat Space Nine&quot; provided the group with their highest-selling album to date and their first Oricon #1. The album was supported by a live DVD and the remix album &quot;Dope Space Nine&quot;.

The third album in the M-Flo Loves series, &quot;Cosmicolor&quot;, was released on March 28, 2007. The final album in the series, it included collaborations with Kumi Koda, Snacky Chan, Namie Amuro and Bonnie Pink, as well as a second collaboration with Crystal Kay, intended as a symbolic close to the M-Flo Loves... project. The album achieved a #2 Oricon position and was supported by a live DVD. A two-disc remix album, spanning remixes both from &quot;Cosmicolor&quot; and songs from M-Flo&#x27;s previous four albums, &quot;ElectriColor&quot;, was released on September 26, 2007.

On February 13, 2008, the group released a collection of greatest hits from the &quot;M-Flo Loves...&quot; series, &quot;Award Supernova: Loves Best&quot;. The album debuted at #1 on the Oricon charts. It also featured a final new collaboration for the series, Love Comes and Goes, with Emi Hinouchi, Ryohei Yamamoto, Emyli, Yoshika, and Lisa.

Verbal has said that during the &quot;M-Flo loves...&quot; period &quot;some vocalists that we thought were nice were hard to work with [because] that are very picky because they are used to controlling people.&quot; He singled out Akiko Wada as the most pleasantly surprising to work with.

In 2009, the group celebrated their tenth anniversary with two shows at Yoyogi National Stadium in Tokyo, capacity 13,000. The shows marked the end of the &quot;M-Flo loves...&quot; period and featured many special guests, including BoA and Crystal Kay.

===2011–present: Reformation and Lisa&#x27;s Return===
In September 2011, M-Flo performed at the Reebok event, Reethym of Lite. Here, they performed a new collaboration song with Reebok titled &quot;RUN&quot;. The song features guest vocalist Minami from CREAM (Japanese group). On March 14, 2012 the first m-flo album in five years &quot;Square One&quot; was released. The group has declined to comment on who will contribute vocals to the album. 
On March 13, 2013, following one year after &quot;Square One&quot;, m-flo released their seventh studio album, &quot;Neven&quot;. The album includes the two singles, &quot;Tonite&quot; and &quot;Lover&quot; released on December 5, 2012 and February 6, 2013, and &quot;Transformerz&quot; which was composed as an opening theme for the Japanese broadcast of the television series &quot;&quot;. In early 2018, Lisa returned to the group, releasing &quot;The Tripod E.P. 2&quot;, a sequel to their major debut &quot;The Tripod E.P.&quot;. This marked their first release with Lisa in over 15 years. M-Flo performed the ending theme &quot;against all gods&quot; for the anime series &quot;Black Clover&quot;.

Their third full-length studio album with Lisa and ninth overall album &quot;Kyo&quot; was released on November 6, 2019. The &quot;m-flo loves&quot; series made its return March 6, 2020 with a compilation album of previous M-Flo loves songs and a new song titled &quot;tell me tell me&quot;&quot;&quot;, featuring Sik-K, eill, and Taichi Mukai. That was followed up in June with &quot;RUN AWAYS&quot; featuring chelmico.

===Outside M-Flo===
Both Verbal and Taku have headed up several side projects outside M-Flo. Verbal heads Rhythm Zone imprint, espionage records, where he produces all-girl Hip hop outfit Heartsdales and collaborates with Mic Banditz.

Taku also heads his own Rhythm Zone imprint, Tachytelic Records. He released an album of remixes by other artists, &quot;Tachytelic Night: Welcomes You to the Far East&quot;, in 2003. He also works with Ravex, a collaboration with fellow Avex DJs Tomoyuki Tanaka and Shinichi Osawa established to mark Avex&#x27;s 20th anniversary. Their debut album, &quot;Trax&quot;, was released on April 24, 2009, following &quot;I Rave U&quot; and &quot;Believe in Love&quot;.

Verbal and Taku have both acted as sometime producers and collaborators for artists who came to prominence largely because of their participation in the M-Flo Loves series, including Emi Hinouchi, Yoshika, Emyli, Ryohei Yamamoto and Lisa. Since &quot;Astromantic&quot;, these artists have been collectively referred to as the Global Astro Alliance. In addition to the earlier &quot;Sotoshigoto: M-Flo Turns It Out!&quot;, Verbal and Taku have released three compilations of collaborations between M-Flo, the Global Astro Alliance, and other artists. The first, &quot;M-Flo Inside&quot;, was released in 2004 shortly before the first album in the series. The second, &quot;M-Flo Inside: Works Best II&quot;, was released on July 26, 2006. The third, &quot;M-Flo Inside: Works Best III&quot;, was released on March 19, 2009.

<doc id="918697" wikidata="Q5738831" url="?curid=918697" title="Heritage Front">
<text>The Heritage Front was a Canadian neo-Nazi white supremacist organization founded in 1989 and disbanded around 2005.

The Heritage Front maintained a telephone message line with a different editorial each day. The voice on the hotline was Gary Schipper. The line resulted in complaints to the Canadian Human Rights Commission and hearings into allegations that the group violated Canada&#x27;s hate crime laws. The group organized a series of white power rock concerts in Toronto and elsewhere. Immediately after one of these concerts, a Tamil man, Sivarajah Vinasithamby, 41, returning home from work was beaten and partially paralyzed by several white power skinheads who had just left the concert.

==History==
The Heritage Front was founded in 1989 by former Nationalist Party of Canada members Wolfgang Droege, Gerry Lincoln, Grant Bristow (a plant working for the Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS)) and James Scott Dawson. They were joined by Al Overfield and other former members of the Nationalist Party who had become disenchanted with Don Andrews&#x27;s leadership and felt that a new organization and tactics were necessary. The idea for the new group was developed in early September 1989 when a delegation of 18 Canadian far right activists were visiting Libya at the invitation of Muammar al-Gaddafi, who was celebrating the twentieth anniversary of his regime. The Heritage Front formed an alliance with the Church of the Creator and its Canadian leader George Burdi. Other prominent figures in the Canadian far right, such as Paul Fromm and Ernst Zündel, worked with the Heritage Front but did not join the organization. 

In 1992, the Heritage Front illegally brought prominent American neo-Nazis Tom Metzger and his son John Metzger to Canada to speak, and provided security at a speech by Holocaust denier David Irving. Droege retired in 1995, following legal troubles, and handed leadership over to Marc Lemire. Under Lemire&#x27;s leadership, the membership of the group declined rapidly, and by 2005 it existed in name only. Now it is defunct.

The activities of the Heritage Front led to the formation of an Anti-Racist Action (ARA) branch in Toronto, which engaged in a series of demonstrations and confrontations with the Heritage Front, culminating in 1993 with a riot on Parliament Hill between members of ARA and the Heritage Front after a concert by George Burdi&#x27;s rock band RaHoWa. Four Heritage Front members, including Burdi, were arrested and charged with assault. Burdi was sentenced to a year in prison for aggravated assault, and later dropped out of the movement and renounced racism. A month after the clash in Ottawa, ARA held a militant demonstration outside the Toronto home of Gary Schipper, which resulted in damage to the property. Droege and other members of the Heritage Front responded that evening by attacking members of ARA outside of Sneaky Dee&#x27;s, a known ARA hangout, resulting in Droege and other Heritage Front members being charged with assault. In 1995, Droege was convicted of the assault and sentenced to five months in prison. He also spent time in jail for contempt of court and other violations relating to the Canadian Human Rights Commission tribunal.

Grant Bristow, a mole for the Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS), infiltrated the group and became one of its leaders. According to the CSIS and Bristow, their aim was to gather intelligence on the far right and to suppress its violent activity. Bristow&#x27;s role in the group was made public in 1994 by the &quot;Toronto Sun&quot;, and became the subject of an inquiry by the Security Intelligence Review Committee, which published a report on the matter in that same year.

<text>Roque de los Muchachos (English: &quot;Rock of the Boys&quot;) is a rocky mound at the highest point on the island of La Palma in the Canary Islands, Spain. The rocks are found at an elevation of above sea level, not far from the Observatorio del Roque de los Muchachos, where some of the world&#x27;s largest telescopes are situated; the altitude and the dryness of the climate here give rise to excellent observing conditions. The rocks are contained with the Parque Nacional de la Caldera de Taburiente.

From the Roque, one can see the islands of Tenerife, El Hierro and La Gomera.

<doc id="918711" wikidata="Q180817" url="?curid=918711" title="Portuguese cuisine">
<text>The oldest known book on Portuguese cuisine (), entitled &quot;Livro de Cozinha da Infanta D. Maria de Portugal&quot;, from the 16th century, describes many popular dishes of meat, fish, poultry and others.

&quot;Culinária Portuguesa&quot;, by António-Maria De Oliveira Bello, better known as Olleboma, was published in 1936.
Despite being relatively restricted to an Atlantic, Celtic sustenance, the Portuguese cuisine also has strong French and Mediterranean influences.

The influence of Portugal&#x27;s spice trade in the East Indies, Africa, and the Americas is also notable, especially in the wide variety of spices used. These spices include &quot;piri piri&quot; (small, fiery chili peppers), white pepper, black pepper, saffron, paprika, clove, allspice, cumin, cinnamon and nutmeg, used in meat, fish or multiple savoury dishes from Continental Portugal, the Azores and Madeira islands.
Cinnamon, vanilla, lemon zest, orange zest, aniseed, clove and allspice are used in many traditional desserts and some savoury dishes.

Garlic and onions are widely used, as are herbs; bay leaf, parsley, oregano, thyme, mint, marjoram, rosemary and coriander are the most prevalent.
Olive oil is one of the bases of Portuguese cuisine, which is used both for cooking and flavouring meals. This has led to a unique classification of olive oils in Portugal, depending on their acidity: 1.5 degrees is only for cooking with (virgin olive oil), anything lower than 1 degree is good for dousing over fish, potatoes and vegetables (extra virgin). 0.7, 0.5 or even 0.3 degrees are for those who do not enjoy the taste of olive oil at all, or who wish to use it in, say, a mayonnaise or sauce where the taste is meant to be disguised.

Portuguese dishes are based on the Atlantic diet and include meats (pork, beef, poultry mainly also game and others), seafood (fish, crustaceans such as lobster, crab, shrimps, prawns, octopus, and molluscs such as scallops, clams and barnacles), numerous vegetable varieties (brassica family), legumes and desserts (cakes being the most numerous). 
Portuguese often consume rice, potatoes, sprouts (known as &quot;grelos&quot;), and bread with their meals and there are numerous varieties of traditional fresh breads like &quot;broa&quot; which may also have regional and national variations within the countries under Lusophone or Galician influence.
In a wider sense, Portuguese and Galician cuisine share many traditions and features.

==Middle Ages==
During the Middle Ages, the Portuguese lived mostly from husbandry. They grew cereals, vegetables, root vegetables, legumes and chestnuts, poultry, cattle, pigs, that they used as sustenance. Fishing and hunting were also common in most regions. During this period, novel methods to conserve fish were introduced, along with plants like vines and olive trees. Bread (rye, wheat, barley, oats) was widely consumed and a staple food for most of the populations.
Sweet oranges were introduced in Portugal by portuguese traders in the 15th century. Many of today&#x27;s foods such as potatoes, tomatoes, chilli, bell peppers, maize, cocoa, vanilla or turkey were unknown in Europe until the post-Columbus arrival in the Americas in 1492.

==Meals==


A Portuguese breakfast often consists of fresh bread, with butter, ham, cheese or jam, accompanied by coffee, milk, tea or hot chocolate. A small espresso coffee (sometimes called a &quot;bica&quot; after the spout of the coffee machine, or &quot;Cimbalino&quot; after the Italian coffee machine La Cimbali) is a very popular beverage had during breakfast or after lunch, which is enjoyed at home or at the many cafés in towns and cities throughout Portugal. Sweet pastries are also very popular, as well as breakfast cereal, mixed with milk or yogurt and fruit. The pastel de nata, one of the most salient symbols of the Portuguese cuisine, is a common feature of the Portuguese breakfast. They are frequently enjoyed with a shot of espresso, both at breakfast or as an afternoon treat.

Lunch, often lasting over an hour, is served between noon and 2 o&#x27;clock, typically around 1 o&#x27;clock and dinner is generally served around 8 o&#x27;clock. There are three main courses, with lunch and dinner usually including a soup. A common Portuguese soup is &quot;caldo verde&quot;, which consists of a base of cooked, then pureed, potato, onion and garlic, to which shredded collard greens are then added. Slices of &quot;chouriço&quot; (a smoked or spicy Portuguese sausage) are often added as well, but may be omitted, thereby making the soup fully vegan.

Among fish recipes, salted cod (&quot;bacalhau&quot;) dishes are pervasive. The most popular desserts are caramel custard, known as &quot;pudim de ovos&quot; or &quot;flã de caramelo&quot;, chocolate mousse known as &quot;mousse de chocolate&quot;, &quot;crème brûlée&quot; known as &quot;leite-creme&quot;, rice pudding known as &quot;arroz doce&quot; decorated with cinnamon, and apple tart known as &quot;tarte de maçã&quot;. Also a wide variety of cheeses made from sheep, goat or cow&#x27;s milk. These cheeses can also contain a mixture of different kinds of milk. The most famous are &quot;queijo da serra&quot; from the region of Serra da Estrela, &quot;queijo São Jorge&quot; from the island of São Jorge, and &quot;requeijão&quot;. A popular pastry is the &quot;pastel de nata&quot;, a small custard tart often sprinkled with cinnamon.

==Fish and seafood==

Portugal is a seafaring nation with a well-developed fishing industry and this is reflected in the amount of fish and seafood eaten. The country has Europe&#x27;s highest fish consumption per capita, and is among the top four in the world for this indicator. Fish is served grilled, boiled (including poached and simmered), fried or deep-fried, stewed known as &quot;caldeirada&quot; (often in clay pot cooking), roasted, or even steamed. 

Foremost amongst these is &quot;bacalhau&quot; (cod), which is the type of fish most consumed in Portugal. It is said that there are more than 365 ways to cook cod, meaning at least one dish for each day of the year. Cod is almost always used dried and salted, because the Portuguese fishing tradition in the North Atlantic developed before the invention of refrigeration—therefore it needs to be soaked in water or sometimes milk before cooking. The simpler fish dishes are often flavoured with virgin olive oil and white wine vinegar.

Portugal has been fishing and trading cod since the 15th century, and this cod trade accounts for its widespread use in the cuisine. Other popular seafoods includes fresh sardines (especially as &quot;sardinhas assadas&quot;), sea bass, snapper, swordfish, mackerel, sole, brill, halibut, John Dory, turbot, monkfish, octopus, squid, cuttlefish, crabs, shrimp and prawns, lobster, spiny lobster, and many other crustaceans, such as barnacles, hake, horse mackerel (scad), scabbard (especially in Madeira), and a great variety of other fish and shellfish, as well as molluscs, such as clams, mussels, oysters, scallops and periwinkles.

&quot;Caldeirada&quot; is a range of different stews consisting of a variety of fish (turbot, monkfish, hake, mussels) and shellfish, resembling the Provençal bouillabaisse, or meats and games, together with multiple vegetable ingredients. These stews traditionally consist of (rapini) &quot;grelos&quot;, and/or potatoes, tomatoes, peri-peri, bell peppers, parsley, garlic, onions, pennyroyal, and in some regions, coriander.

River lamprey and eels are considered fresh water delicacies. The Coimbra and Aveiro regions of central Portugal, are renowned for eel stews and lamprey seasonal dishes and festivals. Arganil and Penacova have popular dishes such as &quot;Arroz de Lampreia&quot; or &quot;Lampreia à Bordalesa&quot;.
Sardines used to be preserved in brine for sale in rural areas. Later, sardine canneries developed all along the Portuguese coast. Ray fish is dried in the sun in Northern Portugal. Canned tuna is widely available in Continental Portugal. Tuna used to be plentiful in the waters of the Algarve. They were trapped in fixed nets when they passed the Portuguese southern coast on their way to spawn in the Mediterranean, and again when they returned to the Atlantic. Portuguese writer Raul Brandão, in his book &quot;Os Pescadores&quot;, describes how the tuna was hooked from the raised net into the boats, and how the fishermen would amuse themselves riding the larger fish around the net. Fresh tuna, however, is usually eaten in Madeira and the Algarve where tuna steaks are an important item in local cuisine. Canned sardines or tuna, served with boiled potatoes, black-eyed peas, collard greens and hard-boiled eggs, constitute a convenient meal when there is no time to prepare anything more elaborate.

==Meat and poultry==

Eating meat and poultry on a daily basis was historically a privilege of the upper classes. Pork and beef are the most common meats in the country. Meat was a staple at the nobleman&#x27;s table during the Middle Ages. A Portuguese Renaissance chronicler, Garcia de Resende, describes how an entrée at a royal banquet was composed of a whole roasted ox garnished with a circle of chickens. A common Portuguese dish, mainly eaten in winter, is &quot;cozido à portuguesa&quot;, which somewhat parallels the French &quot;pot-au-feu&quot; or the New England boiled dinner. Its composition depends on the cook&#x27;s imagination and budget. An extensive lavish cozido may include beef, pork, salt pork, several types of &quot;charcutaria&quot; (such as cured &quot;chouriço&quot;, &quot;morcela e chouriço de sangue&quot;, &quot;linguiça&quot;, &quot;farinheira&quot;, etc.), pig&#x27;s feet, cured ham, potatoes, carrots, turnips, cabbage and rice. This would originally have been a favourite food of the affluent farmer, which later reached the tables of the urban bourgeoisie and typical restaurants.

===Meat===

&quot;Tripas à moda do Porto&quot; (tripe with white beans) is said to have originated in the 14th century, when the Castilians laid siege to Lisbon and blockaded the Tagus entrance. The Portuguese chronicler Fernão Lopes dramatically recounts how starvation spread all over the city. Food prices rose astronomically, and small boys would go to the former wheat market place in search of a few grains on the ground, which they would eagerly put in their mouths when found. Old and sick people, as well as prostitutes, or in short anybody who would not be able to aid in the city&#x27;s defence, were sent out to the Castilian camp, only to be returned to Lisbon by the invaders. It was at this point that the citizens of Porto decided to organize a supply fleet that managed to slip through the river blockade. Apparently, since all available meat was sent to the capital for a while, Porto residents were limited to tripe and other organs. Others claim that it was only in 1415 that Porto deprived itself of meat to supply the expedition that conquered the city of Ceuta. Whatever the truth may be, since at least the 17th century, people from Porto have been known as &quot;tripeiros&quot; or tripe eaters. Another Portuguese dish with tripe is &quot;dobrada&quot;.

Nowadays, the Porto region is equally known for the toasted sandwich known as a &quot;francesinha&quot; (meaning &quot;Frenchie&quot;).

Many other meat dishes feature in Portuguese cuisine. In the Bairrada area, a famous dish is &quot;&quot; (roasted suckling pig). Nearby, another dish, &quot;chanfana&quot; (goat slowly cooked in red wine, paprika and white pepper) is claimed by two towns, Miranda do Corvo (&quot;Capital da Chanfana&quot;) and Vila Nova de Poiares (&quot;Capital Universal da Chanfana&quot;). 
&quot;Carne de porco à alentejana&quot;, fried pork with clams, is a popular dish with some speculation behind its name and its origin as clams would not be as popular in Alentejo, a region with only one sizeable fishing port, Sines, and small fishing villages but would instead have a much popular usage in the Algarve and its seaside towns. One of the theories as to why the plate may belong to the Algarve is that pigs in the region used to be fed with fish derivatives, so clams were added to the fried pork to disguise the fishy taste of the meat. The dish was used in the Middle Ages to test Jewish converts&#x27; new Christian faith; consisting of pork and shellfish (two non-kosher items), &quot;Cristãos-novos&quot; were expected to eat the dish in public in order to prove they had renounced the Jewish faith. In Alto Alentejo (North Alentejo), there is a dish made with lungs, blood and liver, of either pork or lamb. This traditional Easter dish is eaten at other times of year as well. A regional, islander dish, 
&quot;alcatra&quot;, beef marinated in red wine, garlic and spices like cloves and whole allspice, then roasted in a clay pot, is a tradition of Terceira Island in the Azores.

The Portuguese steak, &quot;bife&quot;, is a slice of fried beef or pork marinated in spices and served in a wine-based sauce with fried potatoes, rice, or salad. An egg, sunny-side up, may be placed on top of the meat, in which case the dish acquires a new name, &quot;bife com ovo a cavalo&quot; (steak with an egg on horseback). This dish is sometimes referred to as &quot;bitoque&quot;, to demonstrate the idea that the meat only &quot;touches&quot; the grill twice, meaning that it does not grill for too long before being served, resulting in a rare to medium-rare cut of meat. Another variation of &quot;bife&quot; is &quot;bife à casa&quot; (house steak), which may resemble the &quot;bife a cavalo&quot; or may feature garnishing, such as asparagus.

&quot;Iscas&quot; (fried liver) was a favourite request in old Lisbon taverns. Sometimes, they were called &quot;iscas com elas&quot;, the &quot;elas&quot; referring to sautéed potatoes. Small beef or pork steaks in a roll (&quot;pregos&quot; or &quot;bifanas&quot;, respectively) are popular snacks, often served at beer halls with a large mug of beer. In modern days, a &quot;prego&quot; or &quot;bifana&quot;, eaten at a snack bar counter, may constitute lunch in itself. 
&quot;Espetada&quot; (meat on a skewer) is very popular in the island of Madeira.

===Charcuterie===

&quot;Alheira&quot;, a yellowish sausage from Trás-os-Montes, traditionally served with fried potatoes and a fried egg, has an interesting story. In the late 15th century, King Manuel of Portugal ordered all resident Jews to convert to Christianity or leave the country.
The King did not really want to expel the Jews, who constituted the economic and professional élite of the kingdom, but was forced to do so by outside pressures. So, when the deadline arrived, he announced that no ships were available for those who refused conversion—the vast majority—and had men, women and children dragged to churches for a forced mass baptism. Others were even baptized near the ships themselves, which gave birth to a concept popular at the time: &quot;baptizados em pé&quot;, literally meaning: &quot;baptized while standing&quot;. It is believed that some of the Jews maintained their religion secretly, but tried to show an image of being good Christians. Since avoiding pork was a tell-tale practice in the eyes of the Portuguese Inquisition, new Christians devised a type of sausage that would give the appearance of being made with pork, but only contained heavily spiced game and chicken. Over time, pork has been added to the &quot;alheiras&quot;.
Alheira-sausage varieties with PGI protection status, include &quot;Alheira de Vinhais&quot; and &quot;Alheira de Barroso-Montalegre&quot;.

 or (the latter usually denoting a larger or thicker version) is a distinct sausage and not to be confused with chorizo. It is made (at least) with pork, fat, paprika, garlic, and salt (wine and sometimes pepper also being common ingredients in some regions). It is then stuffed into natural casings from pig or lamb and slowly dried over smoke. The many different varieties differ in color, shape, spices and taste. White pepper, piri-piri, cumin and cinnamon are often an addition in Portuguese ex-colonies and islands. Traditional Portuguese cured chouriço varieties are more meaty, often use red wine and not many spices. Many Portuguese dishes use , including and .

&quot;Farinheira&quot; is another Portuguese smoked sausage, which uses wheat flour as base ingredient. This sausage is one of the ingredients of traditional dishes like Cozido à Portuguesa. Borba, Estremoz and Portalegre farinheiras all have a &quot;PGI&quot; in the European Union.
Presunto (&quot;prosciutto ham&quot;) comes in a wide variety in Portugal, the most famous presunto being from the Chaves region. Presunto is usually cut in thin slices or small pieces and consumed as aperitif, tea, or added as ingredient to different dishes.

Several varieties of presunto are protected by European law with &quot;protected designations of origin&quot; (PDO) or &quot;protected geographical indication&quot; (PGI), such as Presunto de Barrancos or Presunto Bísaro de Vinhais.

&quot;Porco bísaro&quot; is a prized native pig breed in Portugal with PDO status. Several products derived from this breed, such as «Bucho de Vinhais», «Chouriço de Ossos de Vinhais» and «Chouriça Doce de Vinhais» also have PGI status.
According to the General Cattle Census on the Continent of the Kingdom of Portugal (1870), &quot;... bísaro is the name given to the tucked-up pig, more or less leggy, with loose ears to distinguish him from the good plump and pernicious pig of the Alentejo&quot;. The name &quot;Celtic&quot; is proposed and used by Sanson to express the antiquity of the race of this type, which was the only one that existed in the regions inhabited by the Celtic people, such as the north of Portugal and Galicia, the former Gaul and the British islands, before the introduction in these countries, of the Asian and Romanesque races.

In 1878, Macedo Pinto described the bísaro pig as an animal belonging to the &quot;Typo Bizaro&quot; or &quot;Celta&quot;, with the morphological characteristics mentioned above, distinguishing two varieties within the breed, according to the corpulence, color and greater or lesser amount of bristles. 

He considered the existence of pigs from 200 to 250 kg of carcass and others between 120 and 150 kg; as for color, he says they are mostly black, also some spotted and those with white fur were called Galegos, as they come from Galicia. Molarinhos were spotted animals that had few bristles and smooth, smooth skin.
The same author also mentions that they are animals of slow and late growth, difficult to fatten (only completing their growth at the age of two), producing more lean meat than fat and accumulating more in the fat than in thick blankets of bacon.
In 1946, Cunha Ortigosa classifies the &quot;Bísara&quot; breed, originally from the Celtic family, as one of the three national breeds. When describing the varieties within the breed, in addition to &quot;Galega&quot; and &quot;Beirôa&quot; which encompasses the &quot;Molarinho&quot; and &quot;Cerdões&quot; subtypes.

Portuguese cold cuts and sausages (&quot;charcutaria&quot; and &quot;enchidos&quot;, respectively) have long and varied traditions in meat preparation, seasoning, preservation and consumption: cured, salted, smoked, cooked, simmered, fermented, fried, wrapped, dried. Regional variations in form and flavour, specialities and names also occur. Further pork (and other meats) charcuterie products include &quot;toucinho&quot;, &quot;paio&quot;, &quot;morcela&quot;, &quot;beloura&quot;, &quot;bucho&quot;, &quot;butelo&quot;, &quot;cacholeira&quot;, &quot;maranho&quot;, pernil, &quot;salpicão&quot; and others.

===Poultry===
Chicken, duck, turkey, red-legged partridge and quail are all elements of Portuguese cuisine. Dishes include frango no churrasco (chicken on churrasco), chicken piri-piri, &quot;cabidela&quot; rice, canja de galinha, and &quot;arroz de pato&quot; (duck rice), among others.

Turkeys were only eaten for Christmas or on special occasions, such as wedding receptions or banquets. Until the 1930s, farmers from the outskirts of Lisbon would come around Christmastime to bring herds of turkeys to the city streets for sale. Nowadays, mass production in poultry farms makes these meats accessible to all classes. &quot;Bifes de peru&quot;, turkey steaks, have thus become an addition to Portuguese tables.

==Vegetables and starches==
Vegetables that are popular in Portuguese cookery include numerous cabbage and collard varieties, sprouts (traditionally collected from turnips and different cabbage shoots) tomatoes, onions and peas. There are many starchy dishes, such as &quot;feijoada&quot;, a rich black bean stew with beef and pork, and &quot;açorda&quot;, a Portuguese bread soup. Numerous ’’cozido’’ stews are prepared from kale, white beans, red beans, Catarino and Bragançano, fava beans, black eyed beans. Several pumpkins like &quot;menina&quot; and &quot;porqueira&quot; varietals, are used in soups and soufflés.
One of numerous vegetable and starch rich soups and broths is &quot;caurdo&quot; or &quot;caldo à Lavrador&quot;, a soup made of cabbage, red beans, potatoes, prosciutto chunks and wheat flour.

Many dishes are served with salads often made from tomato, lettuce, shredded carrots and onion, usually seasoned with olive oil and vinegar. Potatoes and rice are also extremely common in Portuguese cuisine. Soups made from a variety of vegetables, root vegetables, meats and beans are commonly available, one of the most popular being &quot;caldo verde&quot;, made from thinly sliced kale, potato purée, and slices of &quot;chouriço&quot;.

==Fruits, nuts, and berries==
Before the arrival of potatoes from the New World, chestnuts (&quot;Castanea sativa&quot;) were widely used as seasonal staple ingredients. There is a revival of chestnut dishes, desserts and compotes in Portugal and production is relevant in inland areas of central and northern Portugal.

Other seasonal fruits, nuts and berries such as pears, apples, table grapes, plums, peaches, cherries, sour cherries, melons, watermelons, citrus, figs, pomegranates, apricots, walnuts, pine nuts, almonds, hazelnuts, strawberries, raspberries, blackberries, redcurrant and blueberries are part of the Portuguese diet. These are consumed naturally or used as desserts, marmalades, compotes, jellies and liqueurs.

==Cheese==
There are a wide variety of Portuguese cheeses, made from cow&#x27;s, goat&#x27;s or sheep&#x27;s milk. Usually these are very strongly flavoured and fragrant. Traditional Portuguese cuisine does not include cheese in its recipes, so it is usually eaten on its own before or after the main dishes. The &quot;Queijo da Serra da Estrela&quot;, which is very strong in flavour, can be eaten soft or more matured. &quot;Serra da Estrela&quot; is handmade from fresh sheep&#x27;s milk and thistle-derived rennet. In the Azores islands, there is a type of cheese made from cow&#x27;s milk with a spicy taste, the &quot;Queijo São Jorge&quot;. Other well known cheeses with protected designation of origin, such as &quot;Queijo de Azeitão&quot;, &quot;Queijo de Castelo Branco&quot;. &quot;&quot;, is the only Portuguese cheese with protected geographical indication and is made in the civil parish of Tolosa, part of the municipality of Nisa, which itself has another local variation within the Portalegre District, &quot;Queijo de Nisa&quot;.

==Coffee==

==Alcoholic beverages==

===Wines and beers===


Wine (red, white and &quot;green&quot;) is the traditional Portuguese drink, the rosé variety being popular in non-Portuguese markets and not particularly common in Portugal itself.
Vinho verde, termed &quot;green&quot; wine, is a specific kind of wine which can be red, white or rosé, and is only produced in the northwestern (Minho province) and does not refer to the colour of the drink, but to the fact that this wine needs to be drunk &quot;young&quot;. A &quot;green wine&quot; should be consumed as a new wine while a &quot;maduro&quot; wine usually can be consumed after a period of ageing. Green wines are usually slightly sparkling.

Traditionally grown on the schist slopes of the River Douro and immediate tributaries, Port wine is a fortified wine of distinct flavour produced in Douro, which is normally served with desserts.

Alvarinho white wines from Minho are also highly sought after.

&quot;Vinho da Madeira&quot;, is a regional wine produced in Madeira, similar to sherry.
From the distillation of grape wastes from wine production, this is then turned into a variety of brandies (called &quot;aguardente&quot;, literally &quot;burning water&quot;), which are very strong-tasting. 
Typical liqueurs, such as &quot;Licor Beirão&quot; and &quot;Ginjinha&quot;, are very popular alcoholic beverages in Portugal. In the south, particularly the Algarve, a distilled spirit called &quot;medronho&quot;, which is made from the fruit of the strawberry tree.

Beer was already consumed in Pre-Roman times, namely by the Lusitanians who drank beer much more than wine. The Latinised word ‘cerveja’ (from cerevisia &lt; cervesia) derives from an older Celtic term used in Gaul. During the Reconquista, many knights from Northern Europe preferred beer to the local wine. The ‘Biergarten’ culture, called &quot;Cervejaria&quot; in Portugal, is widespread in all regions and several local brands are popular with locals and visitors alike. Lisbon has a Beer Museum focusing on Portuguese and Lusophone countries&#x27; beer traditions.

==Pastries and sweets==

Portuguese sweets have had a large impact on the development of Western cuisines. Many words like marmalade, caramel, molasses and sugar have Portuguese origins.

The Portuguese sponge cake called &quot;&quot; is believed to be based on the 17th century French recipe &quot;pain de lof&quot;, which in turn derived from Dutch &quot;loef&quot;. The French eventually called their cake Genoise.

Probably the most famous of the Portuguese patisseries are the pastéis de nata, originally known as &quot;Pastéis de Belém&quot; in the Lisbon district with the same name in the early nineteenth century. It is unclear when and where the recipe was first started. 
Monks of the military-religious Order of Christ lived in a church on the same location and provided assistance to seafarers in transit since the early fourteenth century, at least.

The House of Aviz and the Jerónimos Monastery followed, the monastery lastly being occupied by the Hieronymite monks. Following the 1820 liberal revolution, events led to the closure of all monastic orders. The &quot;Pastéis de Belém&quot; were first commercialised just outside the Jerónimos monastery by people who had lost their jobs there. The original patisserie, adjacent to the monastery still operates today. This pastry is now found worldwide, it is known in the UK by its original name or also as &quot;Portuguese custard tart&quot;. In 2011, the Portuguese public voted on a list of over 70 national dishes. Eventually naming the pastel de nata one of the seven wonders of Portuguese gastronomy.

Many of the country&#x27;s typical pastries were created in the Middle Ages monasteries by nuns and monks and sold as a means of supplementing their incomes. The names of these desserts are usually related to monastic life; &quot;barriga de freira&quot; (nun&#x27;s belly), &quot;papos d’anjo&quot; (angel&#x27;s double chin), and &quot;toucinho do céu&quot; (bacon from heaven). 
For that reason, they are often referred to as &quot;doçaria conventual&quot; or &quot;receitas monásticas&quot; (monastic recipes). Their legacy dates back to the 15th century when sugar from overseas became easier to access by all classes. Nuns at the time, were often young nobles who inherited knowledge from their households and developed recipes. These recipes were passed and perfected from generation to generation, usually within the secrecy of convents. Many of today&#x27;s Portuguese desserts originated in convents and monasteries.

The Andalusian influence in Southern Portugal can be found in sweets that incorporate figs, almonds and honey, namely the Algarve marzipan colourful sweets, or the almond tuiles, known as &quot;telhas d’amêndoa&quot;.

Most towns have a local specialty, usually egg or cream-based pastry. Some examples are &quot;leite-creme&quot; (a dessert consisting of an egg custard-base topped with a layer of hard caramel, a variant of creme brûlée) and &quot;pudim flã&quot;.

Other very popular pastries found in most cafés, bakeries and pastry shops across the country are the &quot;Bola de Berlim&quot;, the &quot;Bolo de arroz&quot;, and the &quot;Tentúgal pastries&quot;.

&quot;Doce de gila&quot; (made from chilacayote squash), wafer paper, and candied egg threads called &quot;fios de ovos&quot; or angel hair.

==Influences on world cuisine==


Portugal formerly had a large empire and the cuisine has been influenced in both directions. Other Portuguese influences reside in the Chinese territory of Macau (Macanese cuisine) and territories who were part of the Portuguese India, such as Goa or Kerala, where &quot;vindalho&quot; (a spicy curry), shows the pairing of vinegar, chilli pepper and garlic.

The Persian orange, grown widely in southern Europe since the 11th century, was bitter. Sweet oranges were brought from India to Europe in the 15th century by Portuguese traders. Some Southeast Indo-European languages name the orange after Portugal, which was formerly its main source of imports.

Examples are Albanian &quot;portokall&quot;, Bulgarian &quot;portokal&quot; [портокал], Greek &quot;portokali&quot; [πορτοκάλι], Persian &quot;porteghal&quot; [پرتقال], and Romanian &quot;portocală&quot;. In South Italian dialects (Neapolitan), the orange is named &quot;portogallo&quot; or &quot;purtualle&quot;, literally &quot;the Portuguese ones&quot;. Related names can also be found in other languages: Turkish &quot;Portakal&quot;, Arabic &quot;al-burtuqal&quot; [البرتقال], Amharic &quot;birtukan&#x27;’ [ብርቱካን], and Georgian &quot;phortokhali&quot; [ფორთოხალი].

The Portuguese imported spices, such as cinnamon (&quot;Cinnamomum verum&quot;) now liberally used in its traditional desserts and savoury dishes, from Asia.

The Portuguese &quot;canja&quot;, chicken soup made with pasta or rice, is a popular food therapy for the sick, which shares similarities with the Asian &quot;congee&quot;, used in the same way, indicating it may have come from the East.

In 1543, Portuguese trade ships reached Japan and introduced refined sugar, valued there as a luxury good. 
Japanese lords enjoyed Portuguese confectionery so much it was remodelled in the now traditional Japanese &quot;konpeitō&quot; (candy), &quot;kasutera&quot; (sponge cake), and &quot;keiran somen&quot; (the Japanese version of Portuguese &quot;fios de ovos&quot;, also popular in Thai cuisine under the name of &quot;kanom foy tong&quot;), creating the &quot;Nanban-gashi&quot;, or &quot;New-Style Wagashi&quot;. During this Nanban trade period, &quot;tempura&quot; (resembling Portuguese &quot;peixinhos da horta&quot;) was introduced to Japan by early Portuguese missionaries.
Tea was made fashionable in England in the 1660s after the marriage of King Charles II to the Portuguese princess Catherine of Braganza (&quot;Catarina De Bragança&quot;), who brought her liking for tea, originally from the colony of Macau, to the court. When Catherine relocated up north to join King Charles, she is said to have packed loose-leaf tea as part of her personal belongings; it would also have likely been part of her dowry.
Queen Catherine also introduced marmalade to the English and made the habit of eating with a fork a part of the court&#x27;s table etiquette.

All over the world, Portuguese immigrants influenced the cuisine of their new &quot;homelands&quot;, such as Hawaii and parts of New England. &quot;Pão doce&quot; (Portuguese sweet bread), &quot;malassadas&quot;, &quot;sopa de feijão&quot; (bean soup), and Portuguese sausages (such as &quot;linguiça&quot; and &quot;chouriço&quot;) are eaten regularly in the Hawaiian islands by families of all ethnicities. Similarly, the &quot;papo-seco&quot; is a Portuguese bread roll with an open texture, which has become a staple of cafés in Jersey, where there is a substantial Portuguese community.

In Australia and Canada, variants of &quot;Portuguese-style&quot; chicken, sold principally in fast food outlets, have become extremely popular in the last two decades. Offerings include conventional chicken dishes and a variety of chicken and beef burgers. In some cases, such as &quot;Portuguese chicken sandwiches&quot;, the dishes offered bear only a loose connection to Portuguese cuisine, usually only the use of &quot;piri-piri sauce&quot; (a Portuguese sauce made with &quot;piri piri&quot;).

The Portuguese had a major influence on African cuisine and vice versa. They are responsible for introducing corn in the African continent. In turn, the South African restaurant chain Nando&#x27;s, among others, have helped diffusing Portuguese cuisine worldwide, in Asia for example, where the East Timorese cuisine also received influence.

===Madeira wine and early American history===

In the 18th century Madeira wine became extremely popular in British America. Barrel-aged Madeira especially was a luxury product consumed by wealthy European colonists. The price continued to rise from £5 at the start of the 18th century to £43 by the early 19th century. It was even served as a toast during the First Continental Congress in 1775.

Madeira was an important wine in the history of the United States of America. No wine-quality grapes could be grown among the 13 colonies, so imports were needed, with a great focus on Madeira. One of the major events on the road to revolution in which Madeira played a key role was the seizure of John Hancock&#x27;s sloop the &quot;Liberty&quot; on 9 May 1768 by British customs officials. Hancock&#x27;s boat was seized after he had unloaded a cargo of 25 casks (3,150 gallons) of Madeira wine, and a dispute arose over import duties. The seizure of the &quot;Liberty&quot; caused riots to erupt among the people of Boston.

Madeira wine was a favorite of Thomas Jefferson after George Wythe introduced him to it. It was used to toast The Declaration of Independence and George Washington, Betsy Ross, Alexander Hamilton, Benjamin Franklin, and John Adams are also said to have appreciated the qualities of Madeira. The wine was mentioned in Benjamin Franklin&#x27;s autobiography. On one occasion, Adams wrote to his wife, Abigail, of the great quantities of Madeira he consumed while a Massachusetts delegate to the Continental Congress. A bottle of Madeira was used by visiting Captain James Server to christen the USS &quot;Constitution&quot; in 1797. Chief Justice John Marshall was also known to appreciate Madeira, as did his fellow justices on the early U.S. Supreme Court.

<text>Scritti Politti are a British band formed in 1977 in Leeds by singer-songwriter Green Gartside, who is the sole remaining member of the original band. 

Initially formed as a punk-aligned underground act influenced by leftist politics, they transitioned into a commercial pop music project in the early 1980s, achieving success on the record charts in the UK. The group&#x27;s most successful album, 1985&#x27;s &quot;Cupid &amp; Psyche 85&quot;, spawned three UK Top 20 hits with &quot;Wood Beez (Pray Like Aretha Franklin)&quot;, &quot;Absolute&quot;, and &quot;The Word Girl&quot;, and one US Top 20 hit with &quot;Perfect Way&quot;. The band&#x27;s 1988 album &quot;Provision&quot; peaked in the UK Top 10 and produced a UK Top 20 hit single, &quot;Oh Patti&quot;. After releasing two non-album singles in 1991, as well as a collaboration with B.E.F., the band returned in the late 1990s after a seven-year break.

==History==
===Origins===
In the mid-1970s, Green Gartside studied fine art at Leeds Polytechnic. The punk rock group Sex Pistols &#x27;Anarchy&#x27; tour, which included the Damned and the Heartbreakers, was launched at the Polytechnic on 6 December 1976. It inspired Gartside to form a band with his childhood friend Nial Jinks and fellow student Tom Morley.

Scritti Politti originally consisted of Gartside as the lead vocalist, Jinks as bass player, and Morley as drummer, with Matthew Kay as their manager who sometimes played the keyboard. Gartside and Jinks knew each other since being students at Croesyceiliog Grammar School in Cwmbran, South Wales. Gartside met Morley at Leeds Polytechnic. For their first public performance in 1976, supporting local Leeds punk group SOS, the group went under the name &#x27;The Against&#x27;.

Upon finishing their studies, the group relocated to London&#x27;s Camden Town around 1977, where they lived in a squat. The name Scritti Politti was chosen as a homage to the Italian Marxist writer and political theorist Antonio Gramsci. The correct spelling in Italian to refer to &quot;Political Writings&quot; would have produced &quot;Scritti Politici&quot;. Gartside changed it to &quot;Scritti Politti&quot; as he thought it sounded more rock and roll, like the Little Richard song &quot;Tutti Frutti&quot;. Alongside other groups of what has been termed the DIY ethic or movement (notably The Desperate Bicycles and Steve Treatment, the latter being associated with Swell Maps), Scritti Politti released a DIY record titled &quot;Skank Bloc Bologna&quot; (a sort of ode to the traditionally leftist Italian city of Bologna) on their own St. Pancras label in 1978. Scritti Politti commonly added allusions to intellectual figures such as Karl Marx, Mikhail Bakunin, Jacques Derrida, Gilles Deleuze, and Jacques Lacan in their songs.

&quot;Skank Bloc Bologna&quot; gained airplay on John Peel&#x27;s BBC Radio 1 show, and the band were signed to Rough Trade under Geoff Travis in 1979, making them labelmates with the other Cardiff avant-garde band, Young Marble Giants. Scritti Politti released two EPs in 1979 with singles &quot;Bibbly-O-Tek&quot;, &quot;Doubt Beat&quot;, &quot;OPEC/Immac&quot; and &quot;Hegemony&quot;. &quot;Hegemony&quot;—which Gartside eventually cited as being based on the old English folk song &quot;Lemady&quot;—led to more melodic songs such as &quot;Confidence&quot;, which in turn hinted at the direction the band would take in the 1980s.

Gartside reduced the band to three pieces. It exhibited an explicit do-it-yourself attitude, which manifested itself in their hand-made record sleeves with detailed breakdowns of production costs, including addresses and phone numbers of record pressing plants, and their own Camden squat address for feedback. They produced a booklet called &quot;How To Make A Record&quot;, which was given the catalogue number SCRIT 3, and aimed to be a guide to recording and releasing a record for aspiring indie artists, based on Scritti Politti&#x27;s personal experience of putting out their first three singles independently.

===1980s===
Scritti Politti began planning their debut album in 1979, but the recording had to be delayed when Gartside collapsed after a gig supporting Gang of Four in Brighton in early 1980. Originally believed to be a heart attack, the cause of his collapse was eventually diagnosed as a panic attack, brought on by his chronic stage fright and his unhealthy lifestyle. Returning home to south Wales at his parents&#x27; insistence for a nine-month convalescence period, Gartside had plenty of time to think about the direction the band and where their music was going. During 1979, he had already become less interested in the independent music and punk scene and had started listening to and buying American funk and disco like Chic and the Jacksons, American soul like Aretha Franklin, and 1960s British beat music such as the Beatles&#x27; early records. Gartside came to the conclusion that making pop music did not require selling out punk&#x27;s principles or dumbing down. He explained his reasons for abandoning the band&#x27;s original &quot;do-it-yourself&quot; philosophy to &quot;Smash Hits&quot; in November 1981:
As well as his musical change of heart, Gartside had also abandoned the strict Marxist philosophy of the early Scritti Politti ideas and recordings, saying that &quot;a lot of the very oppositional politics that we&#x27;d been involved in lost their appeal and credibility for me. I rejected the principles of that, what was monolithical Marxism. I no longer supported the mechanism which held that up, and carried over to the music. Plus I was bored shitless with the noise we were making.&quot;

Before his collapse Gartside had already broached the concept of taking the group in a more commercial pop direction with his bandmates. His ideas did not go down well with them, as he recounted in an interview for &quot;Jamming!&quot; fanzine in June 1982:

Gartside recorded a demo of one of his new songs, &quot;The &#x27;Sweetest Girl&#x27;&quot;, in January 1981, and the song was included on the &quot;C81&quot; cassette compilation obtained with tokens from the March issues of &quot;NME&quot;. The song – which features Robert Wyatt on keyboards – received strong reviews. It was cited by &quot;The New York Times&quot; as one of the ten best singles of the year, but the track did not get a wide release for ten months, by which time momentum was lost, and it only achieved a minor placing on the UK Singles Chart at No. 64. The single was later covered by pop band Madness, with their version reaching No. 35 on the UK Singles Chart in 1986. Drummer Tom Morley departed Scritti Politti in November 1981.

&quot;The &#x27;Sweetest Girl&#x27;&quot; prompted many major labels to offer Gartside record contracts, but he decided to stay with Rough Trade Records. &quot;The &#x27;Sweetest Girl&#x27;&quot; marked a stylistic change toward the more melodic, and was followed by minor hits &quot;Faithless&quot; (UK No. 56) and double A-side &quot;Asylums in Jerusalem&quot; / &quot;Jacques Derrida&quot; (UK No. 43). The song &quot;Jacques Derrida&quot; was influenced by Gartside&#x27;s reading of deconstruction and the work of semiotic analysis from the French philosopher Derrida.

The debut album, &quot;Songs to Remember&quot;, was released on Rough Trade in August 1982. Displaying Gartside&#x27;s previously hidden reggae influence, it was a critical and commercial success, reaching No. 12 in the UK Albums Chart. One of Rough Trade&#x27;s most unlikely success stories, the album became their biggest selling release to date. Also during this period, Gartside recorded a duet with Annie Lennox on the Eurythmics track &quot;Wrap It Up&quot;, for their &quot;Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This)&quot; album released in early 1983.

Around this time Gartside returned to his home in South Wales: I became sick. I went back to Caerleon... and I started listening to my sister&#x27;s music for the first time. She had a lot of black music. Around that time my parents moved to Florida, and it was visiting there I first heard black radio – that&#x27;s where I first heard &#x27;the funk&#x27;. The System, Zapp... artists like that. There was a rapid change of influences combined with a disgust at big-I &#x27;Indie&#x27; being born. It didn&#x27;t take long to say, &#x27;Fuck that, let&#x27;s do this instead.&#x27;

Gartside became influenced by the new sounds coming out of New York City, especially hip hop. He signed with Virgin Records in 1983 (and with Warner Bros. in the US.) The original line-up was disbanded and Gartside moved to New York.

Collaborating with veteran producer Arif Mardin, David Gamson and Fred Maher, the first recording to emerge from these sessions was the single: &quot;Wood Beez (Pray Like Aretha Franklin)&quot;. Released in February 1984, &quot;Wood Beez&quot; was an immediate UK hit, peaking at No. 10, and was also successful in Australia, charting at No. 25, and in New Zealand where it reached No. 26. A series of intricately programmed dance/soul-style hits followed, including &quot;Absolute&quot; (UK No. 17), &quot;Hypnotize&quot; (UK No. 68 and No. 43 on the US Dance Charts) and the reggae-styled &quot;The Word Girl&quot;, which became Scritti Politti&#x27;s biggest UK hit single, climbing to No. 6 in May 1985.

In June 1985, Scritti Politti released their second (and most successful) album, &quot;Cupid &amp; Psyche 85&quot;, with songs produced by Arif Mardin and performances by numerous session musicians. The LP was a top 5 hit in the UK and sold well in the US. In addition to the four already released singles, the album included the song, &quot;Perfect Way&quot;. It was only a minor hit when released in the UK (No. 48) but it became the band&#x27;s biggest US single, peaking at No. 11.

The personnel for &quot;Cupid and Psyche 85&quot; differed from that of their first album, and featured keyboardist David Gamson and ex-Material drummer Fred Maher, both of whom would collaborate with Gartside on songwriting and production duties. Arif Mardin would also produce three songs for the album. Stylistically, the songs on the album feature dense timbral counterpoint (in fact, nearly every song on the album), using synthesizer chords and effects (as well as &quot;real&quot; instruments), programmed largely by David Gamson, creating a style that they would refine in their next album. In the US, &quot;Wood Beez&quot; was re-released as the follow-up single to &quot;Perfect Way&quot;, but it only managed to hit No. 91 (it had previously hit No. 4 on the US Dance charts in late 1984).

In 1986, Gartside and Gamson wrote and produced &quot;Love of a Lifetime&quot; for Chaka Khan, which appeared on her &quot;Destiny&quot; album. The same year they also collaborated to write the title track for Al Jarreau&#x27;s album, &quot;L is For Lover&quot;.

In 1987, Scritti Politti appeared on the &quot;Who&#x27;s That Girl&quot; soundtrack with the song &quot;Best Thing Ever&quot;. This track also appeared on the next Scritti Politti album, 1988&#x27;s &quot;Provision&quot;, which continued Gartside&#x27;s development into synth-funk as well as reggae and other styles. The roster of session players became even more notable, including contributions from Roger Troutman, Marcus Miller and Miles Davis, who performed on the single &quot;Oh Patti (Don&#x27;t Feel Sorry for Loverboy)&quot;, a UK No. 13 hit. Although the album charted in the top 10 in the UK (No. 8), it did not match the commercial success of &quot;Cupid and Psyche 85&quot; in the US, stalling at No. 113.

===1990s===
Scritti Politti entered the UK charts again in 1991 with their cover of the Beatles&#x27; &quot;She&#x27;s a Woman&quot;, which featured guest vocals from Shabba Ranks and a remix version by William Orbit. It became Scritti Politti&#x27;s final UK top 20 single, peaking at No. 20. This was swiftly followed by the release of &quot;Take Me in Your Arms and Love Me&quot;&#x27;, a cover of the Gladys Knight song, featuring guest vocals from Sweetie Irie, which failed to chart inside the top 40. The same year, Gartside also worked with B.E.F. as a guest vocalist for their cover of &quot;I Don&#x27;t Know Why I Love You&quot; for the album &quot;Music of Quality and Distinction, Volume 2&quot;. However, a new Scritti Politti album never materialised, with Gartside deciding on another hiatus.

The hip-hop inspired album &quot;Anomie and Bonhomie&quot; was released in 1999, and involved even more session artists. The now bearded Gartside dived directly into the now commercially accessible hip hop scene, borrowing tradesmen of the genre such as Mos Def and Jimahl amongst others. While considered by many critics to be a return to form, the album was not as commercially successful as their previous output, reaching only No. 33 on the UK Albums Chart.

===21st century===
In 2003, Gartside appeared on Kylie Minogue&#x27;s album &quot;Body Language&quot;, duetting on the Emiliana Torrini co-write &quot;Someday&quot;.

In February 2005, Rough Trade released &quot;Early&quot;, a compilation album of Scritti Politti&#x27;s earliest recordings.

In early January 2006, Gartside and a new incarnation of Scritti Politti, billed as &#x27;Double G and the Traitorous 3&#x27;, played a show in Brixton. This was Gartside&#x27;s first live appearance since 1980. This band, including journalist/musician Rhodri Marsden on keyboards, Dicky Moore on guitar and Ralph Phillips on drums, played a number of concerts previewing a new album, &quot;White Bread, Black Beer&quot;, which was released on Rough Trade on 29 May 2006. Later that year, &quot;White Bread, Black Beer&quot; was nominated for the Mercury Music Prize.

The current line-up toured worldwide (under the Scritti Politti name) on the back of the album&#x27;s success, embarked on their first-ever North American tour in October 2006 and completed a UK tour in November 2006. They appeared at the Bestival music festival in September 2006, and at Summer Sonic Festival in Japan. On 19 December, they played a short set at the Rough Trade Christmas party in London.

In 2007, Gartside worked on an album with Alexis Taylor, the singer with Hot Chip. The pair met at the Mercury Music Prize ceremony, and played a concert supporting Kieran Hebden and Steve Reid at KOKO in London in March 2007.

Gartside joined &#x27;Way to Blue: The Songs of Nick Drake&#x27;, a 2008 UK and Australian tour featuring interpretations of Nick Drake&#x27;s songs by amongst others, Robyn Hitchcock, Lisa Hannigan and Teddy Thompson. A subsequent live 15-track CD was released, including Gartside&#x27;s version of Drake&#x27;s &quot;Fruit Tree&quot; which he also performed at The Barbican, London.

In 2009, Gartside participated in &#x27;Very Cellular Songs&#x27;, a concert at The Barbican celebrating the music of the Incredible String Band, featuring Richard Thompson, Kamila Thompson, Alasdair Roberts, and Dr. Strangely Strange.

On 28 February 2011, &quot;Absolute&quot;, a compilation of singles and album tracks was released, with two new tracks both written with David Gamson: &quot;Day Late and a Dollar Short&quot; and &quot;A Place We Both Belong&quot;. Gamson played a part in the recording of both &quot;Cupid &amp; Psyche 85&quot; and &quot;Provision&quot;. The album was voted &quot;Best New Reissue&quot; by &quot;Pitchfork&quot; on 10 March 2011.

The Tracey Thorn Christmas album &quot;Tinsel and Lights&quot;, released in October 2012, featured a duet with Gartside and a cover of the song &quot;Snow in Sun&quot; from &quot;White Bread, Black Beer&quot;.

Gartside has also collaborated with fellow Welshmen, the Manic Street Preachers. In addition to Gartside contributing lead vocals to the track &quot;Between the Clock and the Bed&quot; on the Manics&#x27; &quot;Futurology&quot; album (2014), Scritti Politti was the support act for three of the Manics&#x27; live shows in April 2014.

In 2020, Gartside released a solo single under his own name. This release on Rough Trade records featured covers of &quot;Tangled Man&quot; and &quot;Wishing Well&quot; as originally recorded by folk singer Anne Briggs.

Rough Trade also picked up the rights to the band&#x27;s Virgin/Warner US albums with &quot;Cupid &amp; Psyche 85&quot;, &quot;Provision&quot; and &quot;Anomie &amp; Bonhomie&quot; due to be re-issued on CD and vinyl by the indie label on 30 July 2021, with a re-issue of &quot;Provision&quot; delayed until later in the year.

==Legacy and influence==
Miles Davis covered Scritti Politti&#x27;s song &quot;Perfect Way&quot; on his 1986 album &quot;Tutu&quot;. Davis also appeared on the track &quot;Oh Patti (Don&#x27;t Feel Sorry for Loverboy)&quot; on the band&#x27;s album &quot;Provision&quot;.

&quot;The &#x27;Sweetest Girl&quot; was covered by Madness on their 1985 album, &quot;Mad Not Mad&quot;.

There are references to Scritti Politti&#x27;s &quot;sugar coated pop&quot; sound on Max Tundra&#x27;s &quot;Parallax Error Beheads You&quot;. Tundra said that he welcomed comparisons with Scritti Politti.

Richard Thompson references the band in his song &quot;A Bone Through Her Nose&quot; from his 1986 release &quot;Daring Adventures&quot; (&quot;Her boyfriend plays in Scritti Politti...&quot;).

Kurt Feldman (the Pains of Being Pure at Heart, the Depreciation Guild) stated that the band&#x27;s music is a major inspiration for his work. The influence is especially prominent on the album &quot;Afar&quot;, released under his Ice Choir project. 

Other artists who have cited Scritti Politti as an influence include Kylie Minogue, Matty Healy of The 1975, Carly Rae Jepsen, Dirty Projectors, Hot Chip, Max Tundra, and Haim. Elton John has also expressed an affinity for the group.

<doc id="918733" wikidata="Q1988266" url="?curid=918733" title="Dutch cuisine">
<text>Dutch cuisine is formed from the cooking traditions and practices of the Netherlands. The country&#x27;s cuisine is shaped by its location on the fertile Rhine–Meuse–Scheldt delta at the North Sea, giving rise to fishing, farming, and overseas trade. Due to the availability of water and flat grassland, the Dutch diet contains many dairy products such as butter and cheese. The court of the Burgundian Netherlands enriched the cuisine of the elite in the Low Countries in the 15th and 16th century, so did in the 17th and 18th century colonial trade, when the Dutch ruled the spice trade, played a pivotal role in the global spread of coffee, and started the modern era of chocolate, by developing the Dutch process chocolate.

In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Dutch food and food production became designed to be efficient, which was so successful that the country became the world&#x27;s second-largest exporter of agricultural products by value behind the United States. It gave the Dutch the reputation of being the feeders of the world, but Dutch food, such as stamppot, of having a bland taste. However, influenced by the eating culture of its colonies (particularly the Indonesian cuisine), and later by globalization, there is a renewed focus on taste, which is also reflected in the 119 Michelin star restaurants in the country.

Dutch cuisine can traditionally be divided in three regions. The northeast of the country is known for its meats and sausages (rookworst, metworst) and heavy rye bread, the west for fish (smoked eel, soused herring, kibbeling, mussels), spirits (jenever) and dairy based products (stroopwafel, boerenkaas), and the south for stews (hachee), fruit products and pastry (Limburgse vlaai, apple butter, bossche bol). A peculiar characteristic for Dutch breakfast and lunch is the sweet bread toppings such as &quot;hagelslag&quot;, &quot;vlokken&quot;, and &quot;muisjes,&quot; and the Dutch are the highest consumers of liquorice in the world.

== History ==
=== 14th–16th centuries ===
Early cookbooks for the elite picture a homogeneous food culture across Europe. Differences were in the use of what was locally available; milk and butter—from the low-lying grasslands of Holland and Friesland—were used in the Netherlands, in comparison to bacon fat used in German countries and England, and oil in Southern Europe. Dutch butter and cheese continued to be famous products for centuries. The common people ate half-liquid &quot;brij&quot; or porridge, potage (consisting of root vegetables, peas, herbs, meat and fish) and &quot;soppe&quot; (vegetable/meat/fish paste, thickened with bread). Beer flavoured with gruit was the common drink as water was of poor quality, and was produced until the 14th century at the monasteries. The replacement of gruit for hop, a German innovation, extended shelf life, turning the Low Counties into a major beer exporter. It still is the largest beer exporter of Europe. &quot;Brand&quot;, established in 1349, is the country&#x27;s oldest beer brand. 

In the 14th century gibbing was invented by Willem Beukelszoon, extending the shelf life of herring, making it possible to sail further and catch more. It created a booming export industry for and a monopoly in soused herring (), and sat the foundation for the later seafaring and colonial Dutch Empire. The Dutch still celebrate &quot;Vlaggetjesdag&quot; (Flag Day) each spring, when fishermen go out to sea to capture the annual herring catch: &quot;Hollandse Nieuwe&quot;.

Vegetable Gardens were used by monasteries and later by castles for their own kitchens. Keukenhof (literally &quot;kitchen garden&quot;, but now a flower park) is such an example. Orchards for pears and apples connected to castles were later used for export and set off a Dutch horticulture tradition that remains to this day. In the castles, which have hunting grounds as well, haute cuisine began to emerge, and in 1510, the first Dutch-language cook book, aimed at the upper class, was printed in Brussels, called &quot;Een notabel boecxken van cokeryen&quot; (&quot;A notable book of cookery&quot;). It offers recipes for festivities, such as sauces, game, jellies, fish, meat, pies, eggs, dairy products, candied quinces and ginger, and contains one of the world&#x27;s oldest known recipes for &quot;appeltaerten&quot;, apple pie. The recipes come from various sources, such as the French recipe book &quot;Le Viandier,&quot; reflecting the close ties between Dutch cuisine and the northern French cuisine, as the whole region was part of the Burgundian Netherlands, with a glamorous court life and lavish feasts. Traditional Dutch restaurants from the south are still referred to as &quot;Bourgondisch&quot;, alluding to the luxurious meals of yesteryear.

=== 17th century ===
As the Dutch Republic entered its Golden Age, lavish dishes became available to the wealthy middle class as well. The Dutch East India Company monopolised the trade in nutmeg, clove, mace and cinnamon, provided in 1661 more than half of the refined sugar consumed in Europe, and was the first to import coffee on a large scale to Europe, popularising the concept of coffee houses for the masses. Apart from coffee, tea became a daily commodity, which was served with candy, marzipan and cookies. The availability of cheaper spices resulted in a tradition of spiced cookies, called &quot;speculaas.&quot;

Initially spices were used to indicate social status, but this disappeared with the influx of spices in Dutch market, and it was the elite who were the first to ban the frequent use of spices. The cookbook &quot;De Verstandige Kok&quot; (or &quot;The Reasonable Chef&quot;), published in 1667, reflects this, and further more shows that meal started with green salads and cold or warm cooked vegetables with dressing, butter, herbs or edible flowers, and continued with numerous fish and meat dishes, including exotic ingredients such as dates, rice, cinnamon, ginger and saffron. Savoury tarts and pastries followed, and the meal ended with jellies, cheese, nuts and sweet pastries, washed down with hippocras, a sweet spiced wine. But in the Golden Age, the everyday meal of the ordinary Dutchman was still a humble affair of grain or legume pottage served with rye.

=== 18th–21st centuries ===
In the early 19th century, the staple for the working population, that suffered from some form of malnutrition, was bread (rye bread in some areas) and potato (introduced from South America), pancakes, occasionally herring and other fish, fruit, vegetables, and little meat. They drank water of poor quality, watery coffee (or chicory) or tea. In some areas hot chocolate was consumed, but the most popular drinks were beer (predominantly in the Catholic south) and jenever, of which the consumption was twice that of the equivalent consumption of distilled spirits in neighbouring countries.

In the 20th century, the availability of mass education meant that girls could be sent to the &quot;Huishoudschool&quot; (housekeeping school), that teach them to cook cheap and simple meals, leading to an increased uniform and plain look of the Dutch diet. However, Initially influenced by the eating culture of its colonies (particularly the Indonesian cuisine), and later by globalization, the diet changed significantly, and became cosmopolitan. Most international cuisines are represented in the major cities and there is a renewed interest in taste, which is reflected in the 119 Michelin star restaurants in the country.

== Origins ==
Dutch agriculture roughly consists of five sectors: greenhouse-based, tillage-based, fruit agriculture, animal husbandry and fishery.

*Greenhouses are used to produce tomatoes, lettuce, cucumbers, and sweet peppers. The Netherlands has shown itself to be the standard-bearer of high-tech greenhouse technology. Wageningen University and Research are the primary architects of this technology, working 80 kilometers southeast of Amsterdam. The university is considered the top agricultural research institution in the world.
* Tillage-based crops include potatoes, kale, beetroot, green beans, carrots, celeriac, onions, all the common kinds of cabbages, Brussels sprouts, cauliflower, endive, spinach, Belgian endive, asparagus and lettuce. Recently some initiatives have been started to encourage interest in such &quot;forgotten&quot; vegetables as common purslane, medlars, parsnips, and black salsify.
* Fruits include apples, pears, cherries, berries, and plums.
* The Dutch keep cattle for milk, butter, cheese, and for their meat, chickens for their eggs and for meat, pigs for their meat and a variety of non-edible products, and sheep for their wool and meat. Goats are increasingly kept for cheese production. Traditionally, horse meat was a common dish (steak, sausage, and thinly-sliced smoked meat), but it is less popular today.
* The fishery sector lands cod, herring, European plaice, sole, mackerel, eels, tuna, salmon, trout, oysters, mussels, shrimp, and sardines. The Dutch are famous for their smoked eel and soused herring, which is eaten raw.

=== Regional ===
Many food origins can be traced back to one of the three general regional forms of Dutch cuisine. Some agricultural products and foodstuffs from these regions are protected by EU law as &quot;Protected designation of origin&quot;, like jenever, Noord-Hollandse Gouda, and kanterkaas (cumin cheese and clove cheese), &quot;Traditional speciality guaranteed&quot;, like boerenkaas (farmer&#x27;s cheese) and Hollandse nieuwe (soused herring), and the less strict variant of &quot;Protected geographical indication,&quot; like Edam Holland and Limburgse vlaai.

==== Western cuisine ====

Western Dutch cuisine is found in the provinces of North Holland, South Holland, Zeeland, Utrecht and the Gelderlandic region of Betuwe. Due to the abundance of flat grassland and accessible freshwater sources, this region is ideal for raising cattle and is known for its many dairy products. Historically, the direct access to the sea made fish readily available, as well as spices, coffee, chocolate and sugar shipped from the overseas colonies.

The butter produced by Zeeland and South Holland contains a larger amount of milkfat than most other European varieties, resulting in a regional cuisine with a wide variety of rich, buttery flavoured pasty. Cookies of all sorts are produced in great number and tend to contain much butter and sugar. The &quot;stroopwafel&quot; is well known, as are cookies with a filling of some kind, mostly almond, like &quot;gevulde koek&quot;. Pastries in this area also tend to be quite doughy and to contain large amounts of sugar, either caramelised, powdered or crystallised. The &quot;oliebol&quot; (in its modern form) and &quot;Zeeuwse bolus&quot; are good examples. &quot;Duivekater&quot; is a moist doughy white bread from the Zaanstreek in North Holland which is eaten with butter; the recipe goes back hundreds of years.

A by-product of the butter-making process, buttermilk (&quot;karnemelk&quot;) is typically used in this region&#x27;s cuisine. Leyden cheese, spiced with cumin and traditionally produced with skimmed milk, can also be considered a by-product in the same way. Traditional farm-made Leyden cheese from this region has been given a protected designation of origin.

For centuries this region has provided prominent Dutch cheeses, named after the cities where each cheese was sold. Recorded history of Gouda cheese arguably starts in 1184, making it one of the oldest cheeses that is still in production using its original recipe. Edam cheese, traditionally produced in small waxed spheres, has been made since the 14th century. These cheeses are made with full-fat milk, and thus they are not by-products of butter production; the young varieties have a milky flavour.

Cheeses sold as Gouda or Edam are now produced everywhere in the world. However, the European Commission has designated the specific names &quot;Gouda Holland&quot; and &quot;Edam Holland&quot; as protected geographical indications (PGIs). Cheese that are certified with these protected names must be produced in Holland using traditional methods with milk from Dutch cows and must undergo a natural aging process. Trademarked cheeses such as Leerdammer, Beemster and Rotterdamsche Oude also originate in this region.

Seafood such as soused herring, mussels (called &quot;Zeeuwse Mosselen&quot;, since all Dutch mussels for consumption are cleaned in Zeeland&#x27;s Oosterschelde), eels, oysters and shrimp are widely available and typical for the region. &quot;Kibbeling&quot;, which consists of small chunks of battered white fish, is a local delicacy that has grown in popularity to become a national fast food.

Indirectly a product of the sea due to its imported spices, Ossenworst (ox sausage) is a raw beef sausage which used to be made of ox meat. This specialty has its origins in seventeenth-century Amsterdam, when oxen were imported large-scale from Denmark and Germany. The spices in the sausage, such as pepper, cloves, mace and nutmeg, came overseas from the Dutch East Indies. Aged beef was used for this sausage, which was smoked at such a low temperature that the meat remained raw. Present-day Amsterdam ossenworst is made with lean beef, and the sausage is now often neither smoked nor aged. It is often eaten with &quot;Amsterdamse uitjes&quot;, a kind of pickled onion. The tradition of pickling onions and &quot;augurk&quot; or z&quot;ure bom&quot; (pickled cucumbers) is a contribution of Amsterdam&#x27;s Jewish community. Traditionally, soused herring is only eaten in Amsterdam with pickled cucumber.

The region harbours the largest cocoa cluster in the world, making the Netherlands one of the leading exporters of chocolate. The chocolate industry is located in this region both because of its colonial past and because Amsterdam was the site of an important innovation in chocolate production. In 1828 Coenraad van Houten developed a new process that allowed chocolate — which until then had been consumed as a liquid — to be manufactured in solid form. Van Houten produced chocolate first in Amsterdam and later in Leiden and Weesp, while Droste began in Haarlem. Chocomel originated in Zoetermeer; this trademarked chocolate-flavoured milk is a very popular type of Koek-en-zopie (the food and drink sold to ice skaters). Zaandam is home to Verkade and also the headquarters of a relatively new Dutch fair trade chocolate brand, Tony&#x27;s Chocoloney. De Zaanstreek is also noted for its mayonnaise (a popular condiment for French fries) and its whole-grain mustards (a popular accompaniment to &quot;bitterballen)&quot;.

The traditional alcoholic beverages of this region are beer (pale lager) and &quot;jenever&quot;, a high proof juniper-flavored spirit that came to be known in England as gin. The region is home to the majority of the &quot;jeneversteden&quot;, or &#x27;jenever cities&#x27;. Lucas Bols in Amsterdam and Nolet (Ketel One) in Schiedam are the oldest and third-oldest distilleries of the world respectively. Delft is also known for its jenever. The Bols family established a liquor distillery in Amsterdam in 1575 that started worldwide distribution of its products at the turn of the 18th century, with 300 liquor recipes. It has since introduced many other flavours, such as Blue Curaçao and Pisang Ambon. The Nolet Distillery in Schiedam was founded in 1691, and has remained in the Nolet family ever since. A notable exception to the traditional types of Dutch alcoholic beverages is also native to this region: &quot;advocaat&quot;, a rich and creamy liqueur made from eggs, sugar and brandy.

==== Northeastern cuisine ====

The provinces of Groningen, Friesland, Drenthe, Overijssel and Gelderland north of the great rivers are the home of northeastern Dutch cuisine, which is generally known for its many kinds of meats. This region is the least populated area of the Netherlands. Large-scale agriculture was not introduced here until the 18th century, and the relative lack of farms allowed for an abundance of game and animal husbandry. The coastal regions of Friesland, Groningen and the parts of Overijssel bordering the IJsselmeer also include a large amount of fish in their traditional dishes.

The &quot;metworst&quot; family of dried sausages is found throughout this region, with most towns and villages having their own variety. The most famous sausage from this region is &quot;Gelderse&quot; &quot;rookworst&quot;. The Dutch eat 60 million &quot;rookworst&quot; a year. These sausages traditionally are smoked over oak and beechwood chips before being boiled in water. The sausage contains much fat and is juicy. Large sausages are often eaten alongside &quot;stamppot,&quot; like &quot;zuurkoolstamppot&quot; (mashed potatoes and sauerkraut). Cut in half they are sometimes eaten as a street food. &quot;Kruudmoes&quot;, a traditional food with buttermilk, pearl barley, bacon and herbs in which rookworst is processed, is local to Gelderland (in and around the Veluwe) and Overijssel (in Salland).

This region is also home to more heavy and solid varieties of Dutch pastries, cookies and breads. Each of the provinces of Gelderland, Overijssel and Groningen has a long-standing rye bread tradition, but rye bread from Friesland (&quot;Fries roggebrood&quot;, a kind of pumpernickel) has become especially well-known because of its distinctive taste. Frisian rye bread is notable for its long baking time (up to 20 hours), which results in a sweet flavour and a deep dark color. In contrast to southern Dutch bread, which tends to be soft and moist, the northeastern rye bread and pastries generally are of a hard texture, and the pasties are heavily spiced with ginger or succade or contain small bits of meat. Typical examples for the region include &quot;kruidkoek&quot; (such as &quot;Groninger koek&quot;), Frisian &quot;suikerbrood&quot; (with chunks of sugar), &quot;Fryske dúmkes&quot; (cookies with anise, ginger, and hazelnuts) and &quot;spekdik&quot; (small pancakes with metworst and bacon).

In terms of alcoholic beverages, the region is renowned for its many bitters (such as &quot;Beerenburg&quot;) and other high-proof liquors rather than the beer that is more typical in the rest of the country. The city of Groningen is a &#x27;jenever city&#x27; — the only one not located in the western region — and home to the Hooghoudt distillery. Friesland with its low-lying pastures also has a feature in common with western Dutch cuisine, that of cheese production. &quot;Friese Nagelkaas&quot; (Friesian clove cheese) is a notable example, and the variant made with skimmed milk known as &quot;kanterkaas&quot; has been granted a protected designation of origin.

==== Southern cuisine ====

Southern Dutch cuisine constitutes the cuisine of the Dutch provinces of North Brabant and Limburg and the Flemish Region in Belgium. It is renowned for its many rich pastries, soups, stews and vegetable dishes and is often called &quot;Bourgondisch&quot; (Burgundian) which is a Dutch idiom invoking the Burgundian dukes who ruled the Low Countries in the Middle Ages. In this region the dukes had their court, which was renowned for its great feasts. The culinary tradition in this region overlaps with that of neighbouring Flanders.

It is the Dutch culinary region which developed an haute cuisine and it forms the base of most traditional Dutch restaurants including typical main courses served such as &quot;Biefstuk&quot;, &quot;Varkenshaas&quot;, &quot;Ossenhaas&quot;, these are premium cuts of meat, generally pork or beef, accompanied by a wide variety of sauces and potatoes which have been double fried in the traditional Dutch (or Belgian) manner.

Stews, such as &quot;hachee&quot;, a stew of onions, beef and a thick gravy, is flavourful and require hours to prepare. Vegetable soups are made from richly flavored stock or bouillon and typically contain small meatballs alongside a wide variety of different vegetables. Asparagus and &quot;witloof&quot; are highly prized and traditionally eaten with cheese or ham.

Pastries are abundant, often with rich fillings of cream, custard and—due to the many fruit orchards (omnipresent in Betuwe region)—fruits. Cakes, such as the &quot;Limburgse vlaai&quot; from Limburg and the &quot;Moorkop&quot; and &quot;Bossche Bol&quot; from Brabant, are typical pastries. Limburg is also known for its &quot;appelstroop&quot; (apple butter), where it may have been originated. Savoury pastries also occur, with the &quot;Brabantian worstenbroodje&quot; (a roll with a sausage of ground beef, literally translates into sausage bread) being the most popular. It even has been included in the national inventory of intangible cultural heritage.

The traditional alcoholic beverage of the region is beer. There are many local brands, ranging from Trappist beer to &quot;Kriek lambic&quot;. 5 of the 11 International Trappist Association-recognised breweries in the world, are located in the Southern Dutch cultural area. Beer, like wine in French cuisine, is also used in cooking; often in stews.

=== Colonial ===
==== Indonesian ====
Indonesian and Indo dishes became popular due to the arrival of former Dutch colonials and people of Eurasian descent into the Netherlands, especially after the independence of Indonesia from Dutch colonial rule in 1945. Countess Cornelia van Limburg Stirum writes in her book &quot;The Art of Dutch Cooking&quot; (1962): &quot;There exist countless Indonesian dishes, some of which take hours to prepare; but a few easy ones have become so popular that they can be regarded as &#x27;national dishes&#x27;&quot;. She then provides recipes for &quot;nasi goreng&quot; (fried rice), &quot;pisang goreng&quot; (fried bananas), &quot;lumpia goreng&quot; (fried spring rolls), &quot;bami&quot; (fried noodles), &quot;saté&quot; (satay or grilled skewered meat), &quot;satésaus&quot; (satay sauce or peanut sauce), and &quot;sambal oelek&quot; (chilli paste). Dutch-Indonesian fusion dishes originated in the Netherlands or in the Dutch Indies during colonial times, is &quot;rijsttafel&quot; (&quot;rice table&quot;), which is an elaborate meal consisting of up to several dozen small dishes filling an entire table, &quot;spekkoek&quot;, a layered cake, and &quot;babi pangang speciaal&quot;, which is, unlike in Indonesia, served in a sweet sour sauce. Popular Indonesian-Dutch fusion dishes sold at Dutch snackbars are &quot;patatje oorlog&quot; (French fries with mayonaise, onions and peanut sauce), &quot;patatje pinda&quot; (French fries with peanut sauce), bamischijf (or bamiblok) and nasischijf (or nasiblok). Another Indonesian-inspired food popular in the Netherlands is long sheets of krupuk.

Outside the big cities, Indonesian food is served in Chinese restaurants, and almost every town in the Netherlands has a Chinese-Indonesian (&quot;Chinees-Indische&quot;) restaurant. In the 1980s, 60% of Dutch people went out to eat at a Chinese Indonesian restaurant, 30% of whom at least once a month. This typical Dutch restaurant fusion is now in decline. In February 2021, this Chinese-Indonesian restaurant culture - where three cultures come together (Chinese, Indonesian and Dutch) - was acknowledged as Dutch intangible cultural heritage that needs to be preserved.

==== Surinamese and Caribbean ====
Surinamese cuisine is also popular in the Netherlands, especially in the bigger cities. Surinamese establishments commonly offer &quot;roti&quot;, a staple of the Hindustani community in Suriname, various Surinamese interpretations of Chinese Indonesian cuisine, and Surinamese sandwiches (&quot;Surinaamse broodjes&quot;) such as &quot;broodje bakkeljauw&quot; (with a type of dried and salted cod) and &quot;broodje pom&quot;.

=== International ===
The first Italian restaurants appeared in the fifties followed by Turkish and Moroccan kebab and shawarma restaurants, and American fast food restaurants in the seventies, sometimes resulting in Dutch fusion dishes, for example &quot;kapsalon&quot; (based on kebab), &quot;McKroket&quot; and &quot;McFlurry stroopwafel&quot; (both sold only in Dutch McDonald&#x27;s restaurants). In the bigger cities, nowadays, foods from all corners of the globe are sold in shops and restaurants.

== Structure of meals ==

=== Breakfast ===
Alongside yoghurt, fruit and muesli, &quot;ontbijt&quot; (breakfast) consists of bread, usually with butter and sweet toppings, such as &quot;hagelslag&quot;, &quot;vlokken&quot;, &quot;muisjes&quot;, &quot;vruchtenhagel&quot;, &quot;gestampte muisjes&quot;, treacle, apple butter, &quot;kokosbrood&quot;, &quot;jam,&quot; chocolate spread&quot;,&quot; and &quot;speculaas&quot;.

Dutch bread tends to be very airy, as it is made from yeast dough. From the 1970s onward Dutch bread became predominantly whole-grain, with additional seeds such as sunflower or pumpkin seeds often mixed with the dough for taste. Rye bread is one of the few dense breads of the Netherlands. White bread used to be the luxury bread, often made with milk as well as water. A typical Dutch white bread is tiger bread. &quot;Ontbijtkoek&quot; may be eaten as a substitute for a full breakfast, or simply as a snack. It is served as a thick slice, usually with butter. This popular &quot;&#x27;cake&quot;&#x27; has been around for centuries, since it can be stored for weeks at room temperatures, without it spoiling, due to the pH, sugar content and used spices. Ontbijtkoek resembles somewhat a soft gingerbread cake, but with much less ginger, hardly any fat and more sugar. The sugar used is the typical Dutch &quot;basterdsuiker&quot;, an aromatic, moist and fine sugar, which gives a baking product its typical brown color and smooth texture. &quot;Basterdsuiker&quot; is protected by the EU and acknowledged as a Traditional speciality guaranteed.

&quot;Beschuit&quot; (Dutch crisp bakes) is also eaten as a breakfast food, with the same variety of sweet toppings, or cheese. A longtime Dutch (romantic) favourite is to serve strawberries on &quot;beschuit&quot;, which is usually topped with some sugar or whipped cream.

A popular breakfast in the weekend are &quot;pannenkoeken,&quot; large and thin pancakes, but not as thin as French &quot;crêpes.&quot; The batter consists of eggs, milk, a mixture of wheat and buckwheat flour, salt, and vanilla extract. The pancakes are cooked in butter, but a bit of vegetable oil is added to the batter to prevent it from burning. Typical fillings that are cooked with the batter are apples, cheese, raisins, chocolate and bananas. Sometimes &quot;pannenkoeken&quot; are eaten as dinner in a &quot;pannenkoekenhuis&quot; (restaurant), and the variety of toppings can include bacon, ragout, salmon and many other things. On the plate pannenkoeken can be topped off with powdered sugar, cinnamon or &quot;stroop&quot; (Dutch syrup).

&quot;Wentelteefjes&quot; (French toast) is another breakfast treat, that has a long history, which goes back to Roman times. A recipe was found in Apicius, a Latin cookbook from 4th and 5th century.

=== Lunch ===
&quot;Middageten&quot; or lunch is somewhat similar to breakfast, but is usually heavier, less sweet, and more savory. However, lunch is not to be a warm meal, and eating leftovers for lunch is not very common. In bars and restaurants, however, &quot;uitsmijter&quot; is a popular dish: two eggs fried with bacon or Gouda cheese, rosbief (rare roast beef, thinly cut), ham.

Dutch consumers are fond of &quot;pindakaas&quot; (peanut butter) as a bread topping. The Netherlands is not only the number one importer of peanuts, it is also the biggest exporter of peanut butter, and despite its size, the third largest consumer in Europe. Other popular toppings are filet americain (a finely ground raw lean beef with the addition of mayonnaise, mustard, paprika and other spices).

==== Cheese ====
One of the most popular toppings for bread is cheese. The vast majority of Dutch cheeses are semi-hard or hard cheeses. Famous Dutch cheeses include Gouda and Edam. A typically Dutch way of making cheese is to blend in herbs or spices during the first stages of the production process. Famous examples of this are cheeses with cloves (usually the Friesian Clove), cumin (most famously Leyden cheese), or nettles.

Dutch hard cheeses generally can be divided by maturity:

The terms &#x27;jong&#x27;, &#x27;belegen&#x27;, &#x27;oud&#x27;, etc. have not been legally protected with regard to the period of ripening. Cheeses sold in supermarkets may have been produced with a fast-ripening starter. This results in faster formation of crystals, and the fast-ripening starter gives a sweeter flavour to the cheese. Fast ripened cheeses lack the complex terroir of cheeses with a longer ripening process. Names implying a level of ripening while avoiding Dutch words could also be used. For example, Old Amsterdam which is ripened - according to the company - only for 8 months, uses &quot;Old&quot; instead of &quot;Oud&quot;.

The designation &quot;boerenkaas&quot; is legally protected for cheese made on a farm from raw milk. Due to the use of raw (not pasteurised) milk, the enzymes and bacteria present in the cheese remain active during ripening. Boerenkaas is therefore spicier and more complex than factory cheese where pasteurised milk is used. Moreover, the taste of &quot;boerenkaas&quot; varies from farm to farm because of the diverse dairy cattle breeds, different feed, the season and the craft of the cheese maker.

Fat content on the cheese packaging is also legally protected. For example, &#x27;35+&#x27; cheese must contain between 35-40% fat, &#x27;48+&#x27; must contain 48-52%. These percentages are calculated based on the dry matter of the cheese. Thus, a 48+ cheese generally contains 29% fat accounting for water contents.

=== Coffee break and sweets ===
Dutch people invite friends over for &quot;koffietijd&quot; (coffee time), which consists of coffee and cake or biscuits, served between 10:00 and 11:00 am (before lunch), 4:00 pm (between lunch and dinner) or between 7:00 pm and 8:00 pm (after dinner). Dutch thrift of the 1940s and 1950s, when the country was rebuilding the destruction of World War II, led to the famous standard rule of only one cookie with each cup of coffee. Presumably in the late 1940s even the then-Prime Minister, Willem Drees, served coffee and one biscuit to a visiting American diplomat, who then became convinced that the money from the Marshall Plan was being well spent. It has been suggested that the reasons for this can also be found in the Protestant mentality in the northern Netherlands. The Roman Catholic south does not share this tradition as for instance in Limburg, where serving a large &quot;vlaai&quot; (sweet pie or pastry with filling), cut into eight pieces, is tradition when visitors are expected.

&quot;Koffie verkeerd&quot; (literally &quot;wrong coffee&quot;), or Café au lait, consists of equal parts black coffee and hot milk. The Dutch drink tea without milk and the tea is weaker than typical English or Irish types of tea which are stronger and are usually taken with milk. In Dutch bars, tea with freshly chopped ginger (&quot;verse gemberthee&quot;) or with fresh mint leaves (&quot;verse muntthee&quot;) has become popular in the 21st century. In the autumn and winter hot chocolate or &quot;chocomel&quot; is drunk. 
Two traditional Dutch drinks, &quot;anijsmelk&quot; (hot milk with aniseed) and &quot;kwast&quot; (hot water with lemon juice) are hardly drunk any more.

Drinks are served with a wide variety of pastry (&quot;gebak&quot;), cookies (&quot;koekjes&quot;) and candies (&quot;snoep&quot;).

==== Gebak ====
&quot;Appeltaart&quot; (Dutch-style apple pie) comes in two main varieties: crumble crust (&quot;appelkruimeltaart&quot;) and lattice (&quot;appeltaart&quot;). The main difference is the texture and design rather than the flavours. The recipe of both doughs is based on flour, sugar and full-cream butter, and sometimes additional ingredients such as lemon zest. The filling typically uses sour hard apples such as the soft and sweet sour Goudreinet or the crisp and sweet Elstar. Sometimes a small pear is added to the mixture. Fillings are usually flavoured with cinnamon, nutmeg and lemon juice. Dutch apple pie filling sometimes includes additional ingredients such as raisins and nuts. Almond paste is sometimes added as a layer between the apples and the crust, so the moisture of the apple filling does not soften the crust.

Apple pie can be served warm or cold, plain, with a dash of whipped cream or vanilla ice cream. In the United States, &quot;Dutch apple pie&quot; refers specifically to the type with a crumb topping.

Boterkoek or &quot;butter cake&quot; is a rich, buttery pastry that is somewhere between a cake and a cookie. It has a crust to the outside and has a soft dense inside. The treat has Dutch Jewish origins, with the Jewish original often including candied ginger.

&quot;Vlaai&quot; is typical for the province of Limburg but is eaten everywhere in the Netherlands. This pastry is made with a yeast dough and filled with fruit such as apple, apricot, pineapple, plum, cherry or berry filling. Other ingredients include custard and rhubarb. &quot;Rijstevlaai&quot; is stuffed with a rich rice-and-cream filling, and &quot;kruimelvlaai&quot; has a custard filling with a crumb crust. Vlaai can be topped with fruits, whipped cream or chocolate.

&quot;Tompouce&quot; or &quot;tompoes,&quot; is iconic, and the Dutch market shows little variation in form, size, and colour. A tompouce is a rectangular bar of about 15 cm x 5cm x 4cm. It consist of two layers of puff pastry sandwiching crème patisserie. The top pastry has a smooth and pink icing. During Koningsdag a variant is made with orange instead of pink icing.

&quot;Mergpijp&quot; is an elongated pastry consisting of cake, cream and jam or purée, covered with a white layer of marzipan that is dipped in chocolate on both ends. It is a variation of a Swedish pastry.

&quot;Moorkop&quot; and the similar &quot;Bossche bol&quot; are large chocolate-glazed choux pastry spheres filled with whipped cream.

==== Koek ====
The Netherlands is famous for its cookies, and one of the three top exporters of cookies in the world. The (American-) English word cookie, derives from Dutch &quot;koekje&quot; (or in the Hollandic dialect &quot;koekie&quot; which has a similar pronunciation as English &quot;cookie&quot;). 
* &quot;Stroopwafel&quot;, this iconic Dutch cookie is a thin waffle, made in a pizelle pan, is sliced horizontally and filled with a layer of syrup. It originates in the city of Gouda.
* &quot;Speculaas,&quot; has a centuries old history, and is a spiced cookie with an intense fragrance of cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg, and ginger. The cookies traditionally show a person or windmill in relief. The cookies are traditionally served around St Nicholas Day, celebrated on December 5 and December 6. There are a few theories on the origin of its name - one says it derives from the Latin word speculum, meaning a mirror, referring to the mirrored images that the cookies are decorated with.
* &quot;Gevulde koek&quot;, a very popular round cookie made from butter dough and with a moist almond paste filling. It has a diameter of about 10 centimeters and is decorated with an almond. Almond paste was first seen in a Dutch recipe book in 1510. Cheaper, mass produced variants often contain a filling of persipan. Similar cookies with different shapes are called &quot;kano&quot; and &quot;rondo.&quot;
* &quot;,&quot; is a small round, semi-hard cookie based on the bitter kernels of almonds (or today often apricot pips). It dates back to before the Middle Ages. It was traditionally served when a couple got married. The sweet (sugar) and the bitter (bitter almonds) symbolized marriage, with its highs and lows.
* &quot; (kind of kringle)
* &quot;&quot;
* &quot;Spekkoek&quot; cake with many layers (originally from Indonesia)
* &quot;
* &quot;Roze koek&quot; cake with pink fondant
* &quot;Poffert&quot;, a spongy small cake usually with raisins from Groningen.
* &quot;Janhagel&quot;
* &quot;Jan in de zak&quot;
* &quot;Ketelkoek&quot;
* &quot;Krentenwegge&quot; (kind of raisin bread)
* &quot;&quot; similar to a soft gingerbread
* &quot;Kokoskoek&quot;
* &quot;
* &quot;Ontbijtkoek&quot;
* &quot;
* &quot;Zeeuwse bolus&quot;

==== Snoep ====

The Netherlands is one of the world&#x27;s leading exporters of candy and chocolate. The Dutch favor &quot;drop:&quot; liquorice&quot;.&quot; The Dutch are the highest consumers of liquorice in the world, and the largest producer of the liquorice candy in the European Union, making up one-third of all EU liquorice production. There are over 80 kinds of &quot;drop&quot; sold in shops over the country. The four types of &quot;drop&quot; are soft sweet (including &quot;fruitdrop&quot;), soft salt, hard sweet (&quot;katjesdrop&quot;), and hard salty (&quot;zoute snippers&quot;). &quot;Zoute drop&quot;, or salty liquorice comes in regular and double salty. When they are flavoured with coconut fondant they are called &quot;Engelse drop&quot; (liquorice allsorts). Other varieties are made with honey (&quot;honingdrop&quot;), salmiac (&quot;salmiakdrop&quot;), or bay laurel (&quot;laurierdrop&quot;). Typical shapes of Dutch &quot;drop&quot; are diamonds, ovals, oblongs, and coins (known as &quot;munten&quot; in Dutch, leading to the name &quot;muntdrop&quot;). Some manufacturers have introduced speciality ranges where the &quot;drop&quot; is made in thematic shapes, the most notable are shapes of cars (&quot;autodrop&quot;), and shapes of farm animals and farm machinery (&quot;boerderijdrop&quot;).

Well known local Dutch candies are &quot;hopje&quot; from the city of the Hague and &quot;babbelaars&quot; from the province of Zeeland. Well known also world wide are mentos and fruittella, both inventions of Isaak van Melle who started the production of candies and toffees at Breskens in 1900.

=== Borreltijd and savouries ===

Between 5:00 pm and 9:00 pm alcoholic beverage drinks (&quot;borrel&quot;), beer, wine or other drinks with savoury snacks are served in bars, at home or at the work space (cafetaria). Borrels are most frequently served at weekends or Friday afternoon. At more formal borrels &quot;bitterballen&quot; are served, a miniature variant of the &quot;kroket&quot; (croquette), deep-fried ragout-filled balls with a crunchy layer of bread crumbs. &quot;Bitterballen&quot; are served with mustard. Another hot borrel snack is &quot;vlammetje&quot; (deep-fried mini spring rolls with a very spicy minced meat filling). &quot;Borrelnootje&quot; (peanuts in a spiced crusty coating), cheese cubes and &quot;kaasstengels&quot; (crusty cheese sticks) are other typical &quot;borrel&quot; snacks.

In Dutch drinks, beer in particular lager plays a central role while wine plays only a modest role. Traditionally the spirit jenever was frequently consumed during drinks. Dutch beer market is dominated by three main producers (with main and subsidiary brands) with a regional preference. Heineken is most common in the west, Grolsch (owned by Asahi Breweries)
in the east, and Bavaria in the south. Other common Dutch lager brands are Hertog Jan and Dommelsch (owned by AB InBev) and the independently brewed Gulpener and Budels. Imported Belgian Jupiler is also very common in the Netherlands.

Dutch cities had long brewing tradition. In the 20th century, the market consolidated when big brewers took over smaller breweries merging production in few production plants, and sometimes discontinuing brands. Since 1990 craft brewers have proliferated in the Netherlands, especially in North Brabant and Limburg which maintained a stronger beer tradition, with many different types of beer (not unlike beer in Belgium). In the 21st century, many new microbreweries were founded, brewing top fermenting beers in many different styles. In September 2013, there were 184 active breweries in the Netherlands. Popular styles include bock, trappist ale, stout, and wheat beer, while in the 2010s IPA varieties became very popular. Some of the most popular craft breweries in the Netherlands are Brouwerij &#x27;t IJ, Jopen, and Two Chefs brewing.

Common spirits include &quot;Jenever&quot; (originally distilled malt wine and the precursor to Gin, nowadays frequently made with industrially produced alcohol), Brandewijn (brandy) and &quot;Vieux&quot; an imitation Cognac.
Of the bitters, Frisian spiced &quot;Beerenburg&quot; is the most famous, but also &quot;Kandeel&quot; (made from white wine), &quot;kraamanijs&quot; (anisette), &quot;oranjebitter&quot; (orange-flavored brandy, served on festivities surrounding the royal family), &quot;Advocaat&quot;, &quot;Boerenjongens&quot; (raisins in brandy), and &quot;Boerenmeisjes&quot; (apricots in brandy) are consumed.

=== Dinner ===

Dinner, traditionally served early by international standards, starts around or even before 6 p.m. The old-fashioned Dutch dinner for the lower class consists of one simple course: potatoes, meat and vegetables—known under the acronym &quot;AVG&quot; (&quot;aardappelen, vlees, groente&quot;). AVG consists traditionally of potatoes with a large portion of vegetables and a small portion of meat with gravy, or a potato and vegetable stew. Vegetable stews served as side dishes are for example &quot;rodekool met appeltjes&quot; (red cabbage with apples), or &quot;rode bieten&quot; (beetroot). Regular spices used in stews of this kind may be bay leaves, juniper berries, cloves, and vinegar, although strong spices are generally used sparingly. Stews are often served with pickles, including gherkins or cocktail onions (&quot;zilveruitjes&quot;). Due to the influx of other countries, traditional meals have lost some popularity. &quot;Stamppot&quot;, mashed potatoes with different options for vegetables, is traditionally eaten in winter. If there is a starter, it is usually soup. The below-listed meals have historic origins as meals for common labourers. From the 17th to the 19th century workers worked 10 to 16 hours on farms or in factories in unheated rooms, hence these meals are very heavy on calories and fat and were meant to replenish a laborer&#x27;s energy.

*Stamppot, boiled potatoes mashed with vegetables and served with meat and/or gravy, coming in a number of varieties:
** &quot;Boerenkoolstamppot&quot;, curly kale (&quot;boerenkool&quot;) mixed with potatoes, served with bacon, gravy, mustard, and &quot;rookworst&quot; (smoked sausage). It is one of more popular Dutch dishes. It is the classic stamppot, and thus when people only say &#x27;stamppot&#x27; they mean the curly kale variant. &quot;Boerenkoolstamppot&quot; was mentioned in cookbooks from the year 1661. Mashed potatoes were not used in this dish at that time, although the sausage was already served with the cabbage in this dish. The dish became popular after a few bad corn seasons, when potatoes became popular as food. &quot;Boerenkoolstamppot&quot; is high in carbohydrates, which makes it a popular meal for cold winter days. 
** &quot;Hutspot&quot;, made with potatoes, carrots, and onions served with slow-cooked &quot;karbonade&quot; (meat chop) and sometimes bacon or sausage. The gravy from the slow cooked meat is served in a dimple or &quot;kuiltje&quot;, made within the hutspot after it has been served on a plate. Before potatoes were introduced in Europe &quot;hutspot&quot; was made from parsnips, carrots, and onions. The dish plays a central role during 3 October Festival in the city of Leiden. 
** &quot;Andijviestamppot&quot;, raw endive mashed with hot potatoes, served with diced fried &quot;spek&quot; (a kind of bacon).
** &quot;Hete bliksem&quot; (&quot;hot lightning&quot;), boiled potatoes and apples, served with &quot;stroop&quot; (treacle) or diced speck.
** &quot;Zuurkool&quot;, sauerkraut mashed with potatoes. Served with fried bacon or a sausage. Sometimes curry powder, raisins or slices of pineapple or banana are used to give a &quot;stamppot&quot; an exotic touch.
* &quot;Snert&quot;, also called &quot;erwtensoep&quot;, is a very thick pea soup that can be served either as a main dish or as an appetizer and is traditionally eaten during the winter. &quot;Snert&quot; includes pieces of pork and &quot;rookworst&quot; and is almost a stew rather than a soup. It is often said that &quot;you should be able to stand a spoon upright in a good pea soup&quot;. It is customarily served with &quot;roggebrood&quot; (rye bread) spread with butter and topped with &quot;katenspek&quot;, a variety of bacon which is first cooked and then smoked. The meat from the soup may also be put on the rye bread and eaten with mustard.

==== Meat dishes ====
* &quot;Gehaktballen&quot; (meatballs, usually half pork, half beef).
* &quot;Slavink&quot;, minced meat wrapped in bacon.
* &quot;Balkenbrij&quot;, a type of liverwurst and meatloaf. The butter-based gravy (&quot;boterjus&quot;) in which the meat has been fried or cooked is also served. A variant of this, eaten around the IJsselmeer, is &quot;butter en eek&quot;, where vinegar is added to the gravy.

==== Flour and dairy dishes ====
* &quot;Pannenkoeken&quot; (large and thin pancakes) with bacon, apples, cheese, or raisins
* &quot;Poffertjes,&quot; miniature sized pancakes, but made with a batter that contains yeast. They are made in a special &quot;poffertjespan&quot;, and served with butter and powdered sugar.
* &quot;Spekdik&quot; (a variant of the pancake made with bacon)
* &quot;Wentelteefjes&quot; (French toast)

==== Seafood ====
*&quot;Zeeuwse mosselen&quot; (a mussel dish, so called because mussels are cleaned and sold in Yerseke, in the province of Zeeland) are popular and commonly served with &quot;friet&quot; (French fries).
*&quot;Kibbeling&quot;, chunks of cod (but often replaced by cheaper white sea fish) that are battered and fried. It is a popular street food.

==== Side dishes ====
* Stoofperen. Served with formal winter meals. Hard pears usually of the or cultivars. The pears are stewed with sugar, wine and spices (usually cinnamon and cloves) for relatively long time (more than 30 minutes up to several hours) until soft and colouring brownish red throughout.

=== Toetje ===
&quot;Toetje&quot;, or the final course is a sweet dessert, traditionally yogurt with some sugar or &quot;vla&quot;, a thin milk pudding (cooked milk with custard). Vla comes in a variety of flavours, the most common ones are chocolate and vanilla.

*&quot;Vla-flip,&quot; vanilla vla mixed with yogurt
*&quot;Hopjesvla&quot;, this dessert comes from the Hague. It is inspired by Haagse Hopjes and has a caramel and coffee flavor. 
*Vanillevla
*Chocoladevla
*&quot;Stoofperen&quot;, poached pears in spiced and sweetened red wine. Eaten with yoghurt as breakfast, with vanilla or cinnamon ice cream as dessert, or warm with the main course as vegetable, particularly around Christmas.
*&quot;Broodpap&quot;, a bread porridge made from old bread, milk, butter, and sugar
*&quot;Griesmeelpudding met rodebessensaus&quot; (semolina pudding served with currant coulis) has been so popular in the Netherlands, that it is thought of as typical Dutch. But other varieties of semolina pudding are popular in the hole of Northern and Eastern Europe. &#x27;Gries&#x27; comes from German, where the pudding may have originated from.
*&quot;Grutten&quot; (Groat)
*&quot;Haagse bluf&quot;, consists of stiffly beaten egg whites with sugar and berry juice without sugar. The name is a reference to the air that people of the Hague would adopt: it seems like a lot, but in fact it is largely air.
*&quot;Hangop,&quot; strained yogurt, garnished with rhubarb, other fruit or jam
*&quot;Karnemelkse bloempap&quot;
*&quot;Karnemelkse gortepap&quot;
*&quot;Rijstebrij&quot; (rice pudding)
*&quot;Krentjebrij&quot; (also called &quot;watergruwel&quot;)
*&quot;Broeder&quot;, a type of boiled pudding usually containing buckwheat, is a traditional dinner mainly in West Friesland

== Special occasions ==
=== Birth and death ===
The birth of a child is an occasion for serving &quot;beschuit met muisjes&quot; (Dutch rusk covered with sugared aniseed). The aniseeds are blue when the child is a boy and pink if it is a girl. It is common to serve them to all visitors of mother and child and bring them to announcing birth at e.g. workplace. Traditionally, Dutch funerals are sober, and food provided is a simple piece of cake with a cup of coffee or tea.
=== Sinterklaas ===

The Dutch festival of &quot;Sinterklaas&quot; is held on 5 December. Saint Nicholas leaves gifts in the children&#x27;s shoes. On this occasion, the Dutch drink hot chocolate milk and eat luxury variants of &quot;speculaas: speculaasbrokken (&quot;thick &quot;speculaas&quot; chunks), &quot;gevulde&quot; &quot;speculaas&quot; (almond paste filled &quot;speculaas&quot;) and speculaas icecream. Spices in &quot;speculaas&quot; include cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg, cardemon and ginger. Also &quot;boterletter&quot; (a baked pastry crust with an almond paste filling and shaped into a letter S of &quot;Sinterklaas&quot;), &quot;marsepein&quot; (marzipan, in the shape of animals or other topical items), &quot;borstplaat&quot; (discs of fondant); and &quot;taaitaai&quot; are eaten. And everyone receives a &quot;chocoladeletter&quot; (chocolate letter), corresponding with the first letter of the name of the receiver. Special treats distributed by Saint Nicholas&#x27; aide &quot;Zwarte Piet&quot; include &quot;pepernoten&quot; (irregularly shaped small cookies made of rye, honey and anise) and &quot;kruidnoten&quot; (gingernut-shaped biscuit but made with speculaas spices). The traditional &quot;kruidnoot&quot; has a specific flavor and texture, but over the years, various variants have also entered the market. Some examples of variants that have appeared in Dutch stores:

* &quot;Chocoladekruidnoten&quot;: These are kruidnoten covered with a layer of milk chocolate, dark chocolate, or white chocolate.
* &quot;Truffelkruidnoten&quot;: These have a rich chocolate flavor and are covered with a thin layer of cocoa powder.
* &quot;Gevulde kruidnoten&quot;: This variant has a filling in the center. Popular fillings include chocolate, caramel or marzipan.
* &quot;Yoghurtkruidnoten&quot;: These kruidnoten are coated with a layer of yogurt. They have a fresh and creamy taste.
* &quot;Koffiekruidnoten&quot;: These are kruidnoten with a subtle coffee flavor. They are often coated with a layer of coffee glaze.

=== Christmas ===
Christmas (&quot;Kerst&quot;) in the Netherlands is a typical family holiday. Traditionally there is family brunch with &quot;kerststol, a&quot; fruited raisin bread, often filled with almond paste and covered in powdered sugar. The bread and its name &quot;stol&quot; originate from Germany, and the name appeared for the first time in print in a Dutch newspaper in 1871. A popular sweet is kerstkransje. Christmas dinner is also a family occasion where &quot;rollade&quot; (a kind of roulade but without the filling, consisting of spiced pork), roast pork, game, or other luxury meat may be served. Another popular Christmas dinner tradition is &quot;&quot;, where people cook on the dinner table their own food on a special &quot;gourmetset&quot;, although this is not limited to Christmas.

=== New year ===
On New Year&#x27;s Eve (&quot;Oud en Nieuw&quot;), Dutch houses smell of the piping hot oil of deep-fat fryers used to prepare &quot;oliebollen&quot; and &quot;appelbeignets&quot; (a kind of apple fritter) – not to be mistaken for the &quot;appelflap&quot; which are made of puff pastry. Also &quot;ananasbeignets&quot; (pineapple fritter) are considered a treat. &quot;Oliebollen&quot; are yeast dough balls, either plain or filled with glacé fruits, apple pieces, raisins, and sultanas are served with powdered sugar. They are sold by street vendors and bakeries, and the quality can vary by a land slide and every year an oliebollen contest is held. Freshly made they are the most tasty. In the 17th century, Dutch settlers also took their &quot;oliebollen&quot; to the American colonies, where they are now known in a different form and recipie as doughnuts.

In Limburg, &quot;nonnevotten&quot; are sometimes served during New Year&#x27;s Eve, although it is mostly eaten during Carnival. Around New Years &quot;knieperties&quot; are popular, in particular in the northern provinces.

=== Easter ===
Months before Easter (&quot;Pasen&quot;) shops are flooded with chocolate eggs. On average, the Dutch eat 47 chocolate easter eggs a year. Another popular dish eaten during Easter is &quot;Paasstol&quot;, which is the same kind of bread as the &quot;Kerststol&quot;.

== Fast food ==
=== Snackbars ===
The Dutch have their own types of fast food, sold at &quot;snackbars&quot; that mainly serve deep-fried fast food. French fries (called &quot;patat&quot; or &quot;friet&quot;) are served with one or a combination of sauces, most commonly:

* &quot;patatje&quot; &quot;met&quot; (mayonaise or fritessaus)
* &quot;patatje pinda&quot; (peanut sauce)
* &quot;patatje&quot; &quot;ketchup&quot; (or &quot;curry ketchup&quot;)
* &quot;patatje speciaal&quot; (mayonnaise, (spiced) ketchup, chopped raw onions)
* &quot;patatje oorlog&quot; (peanut sauce, mayonnaise, chopped raw onions)
* &quot;patatje joppie&quot; (pickle relish of chopped vegetables and mild spices)
* &quot;patatje kapsalon&quot; (fries, topped with either shawarma, kebab, or döner kebab, finished with salad, cheese, and various sauces such as sambal and garlic sauce).

Snacks made with meat are usually deep fried. These include:

* &quot;frikandel,&quot; deep-fried skinless minced meat sausage, most popular fast food snack in the Netherlands
* &quot;kroket,&quot; deep-fried ragout roll covered in a thick crust, eaten with mustard, also available in bread rolls (&quot;broodje kroket&quot;). The two main varieties are &quot;rundvleeskroket&quot; (with beef) and &quot;kalfsvleeskroket&quot; (with veal). Vegan, cheese and satay versions are also available. The thick, crispy crust, the bigger size and the filling sets the Dutch kroket apart from the French croquette (where it originates from) and Spanish &quot;croquetas.&quot; An estimated 75% of all Dutch people eat them, resulting in 29 &quot;kroketten&quot; per person per year on average, being the 2nd most popular Dutch snack after the &quot;frikandel&quot;. In some municipalities, members of the municipal council have the right to a kroket if a council meeting lasts until after 23:00. A bun with kroket (&quot;broodje kroket&quot;) is often eaten as lunch.
* &quot;bamiblok&quot; and &quot;nasischijf&quot;, deep-fried disk or square shaped &quot;mie goreng or nasi goreng&quot; patties covered with breadcrumbs.
* &quot;kaassoufflé&quot;, deep fried puff pastry envelope with a small amount of Gouda cheese in the center
* &quot;Berenklauw,&quot; sliced meatball and fried onion rings on a wooden skewer, smothered in peanut sauce
* &quot;Kipcorn,&quot; deep fried rod-shaped chicken or turkey meat slurry, breaded with a crust of corn or breadcrumbs, served with ketchup, mayonnaise or curry sauce
*&quot;eierbal,&quot; regional (in the north and east of the country), a deep-fried egg in ragout

=== On the road ===

*&quot;Saucijzenbroodje&quot; (a kind of sausage roll), with nutmeg-spiced minced meat baked in puff pastry, are sold in supermarkets and kiosks.
* &quot;Brabants worstenbroodje&quot;, regional (Brabant), slightly spiced sausage baked in bread dough.

=== Fish stalls ===
*&quot;rauwe haring&quot; or &quot;zoute haring&quot; (soused herring), optionally served with chopped raw onions, which is eaten by lifting the herring high up into the air by its tail and then biting into it upwards (except for Amsterdam, where the herring is cut into pieces). Raw herring is also commonly sold in a soft white bun.

*&quot;kibbeling,&quot; deep-fried, nugget-sized chunks of (originally) Atlantic cod, but now often replaced by other kinds of cheaper whitefish. It is often served with remoulade, ravigote sauce, garlic sauce or tartar sauce, and seasoned with a mix of ground herbs, such as coriander, pepper, paprika, garlic, onion, etc.
* &quot;lekkerbekje,&quot; deep-fried cod (or other whitefish), similar to the fish served with British fish and chips, but delicately spiced and with a more tempura-like batter
* &quot;gerookte paling&quot; (smoked European eel) has a long-standing tradition in the Netherlands, particularly around the IJsselmeer.

<doc id="918740" wikidata="Q7880043" url="?curid=918740" title="Ulster Unionist Labour Association">
<text>The Ulster Unionist Labour Association (UULA) was an association of trade unionists founded by Edward Carson in June 1918, aligned with the Ulster Unionists in Ireland. Members were known as Labour Unionists. In Britain, 1918 and 1919 were marked by intense class conflict. This phenomenon spread to Ireland, the whole of which was part of the United Kingdom at the time. This period also saw a large increase in trade union membership and a series of strikes. These union activities raised fears in a section of the Ulster Unionist leadership, principally Edward Carson and R. Dawson Bates. Carson at this time was president of the British Empire Union, and had been predisposed to amplify the danger of a Bolshevik outbreak in Britain.

==Founding==
The Ulster Unionist Labour Association was made up of trade unionists and Ulster Unionists and was founded by Carson along with J. M. Andrews as a means of instigating a purge from the local trade union movement of &#x27;Bolsheviks&#x27; and republicans. Both Carson and Bates feared this class conflict and the development of a militant Sinn Féin would threaten the class alliance with dissolution which had been embodied in the old Ulster Volunteers. By sounding the counter-revolutionary alarm, it would be a call to &quot;loyal workers&quot; against what it considered the twin threats of socialism and republicanism.

The grouping adopted as formal policy an opposition to socialism, but was seen by many as an attempt to convince people that the Unionist Party had the interests of the working class at heart. Members included Tommy Henderson, later an independent Unionist member of parliament.

==1918 General Election==
During the 1918 general election the aims of the UULA were set out by Bates. In a letter to Carson he stated that they would be used as a means of distracting younger members of the working class from the Independent Labour Party, who held views which were very different from their own organisation, i.e. socialism.

The Belfast Labour Party put four candidates forward, but they lost out to two UULA and two Unionist candidates.

The UULA had three members returned to Westminster, all of them in Belfast: Belfast St Anne&#x27;s Thomas Henry Burn in Belfast St Anne&#x27;s, Samuel McGuffin in Belfast Shankill, and Thompson Donald in Belfast Victoria.

==Workers&#x27; strike==
Predominantly Protestant, Belfast engineering and shipyard workers, traditionally well organised, staged a three-week strike demanding a 10-hour reduction in the working week. This was done in defiance of the national leadership of the Confederation of Shipbuilding and Engineering Unions. The strike was extended to include electricity and municipal gas workers, causing large sections of industry and commerce to close down. They began to publish a daily newspaper and a General Strike Committee was formed and began to issue permits allowing only &quot;necessary&quot; production.

==Sectarianism==
By 1920 growing unemployment in the linen industries and engineering sector were creating tension within the &quot;Protestant bloc&quot;. Large numbers of well organised ex-servicemen were still out of work and a cause of concern to the local middle class. It was the local middle class who alleged that &quot;peaceful penetration&quot; of Belfast industry during the war by thousands of Catholics created the unemployment problem, especially that of the ex-servicemen. It would be the local middle class who succeeded in giving the conflict its sectarian twist.

In the spring and summer of 1920 &quot;indignation&quot; meetings were held in Belfast by working-class members of Carson&#x27;s “Old Town Hall circle” to attack the British unions for their &quot;Bolshevism&quot; and &quot;pro-republicanism&quot;. Leading Unionists and employers went along in these events and even justified them, as they were perceiving themselves to be vulnerable. After one meeting held in the shipyards in July, attacks began on workers identified as Belfast Labour members, socialists and Catholics. This then spread to some sections of the linen industry and the engineering industry, resulting in over &quot;8,000 expulsions within a week.&quot;

Paul Collins suggests that the expulsions were partly the result of a speech made by Carson on 12 July, Orange Order celebrations linking Labour with Sinn Féin: &quot;…These men who come forward as the friends of Labour care no more about Labour than does the man in the moon. Their real object, and the real insidious nature of their propaganda is that they mislead and bring about disunity amongst our own people and in the end before we know where we are, we may find ourselves in the same bondage and slavery as is the rest of Ireland in the South and West.&quot;

Collins however suggests that the direct cause of the expulsions was the killing of Banbridge RIC man Colonel Smyth on 7 July in Cork. Rail Union members in the south of Ireland refused to allow his body to travel home by train, leading many Loyalists to then identify the Labour movement with his assassins. It was on the day of his funeral, Collins says, that the expulsions began, resulting in ten thousand Catholics and so-called &quot;Rotten Prods&quot; with connections to Labour.

Most Protestant employers looked on with tacit approval as &quot;Vigilance Committees&quot; were established to prevent &quot;disloyalist&quot; workers from being re-employed. Protestant domination of the Belfast industries was celebrated with Union Jack unfurlings and addressed by members of the UULA.

==B Specials established==
Catholic retaliation and reprisals were inevitable, with gun and bomb attacks on trains carrying shipyard workers. This resulted in yet more reprisals, with widespread looting and burning of Catholic owned businesses. The British army while guarding Catholic properties clashed with Protestant crowds with fatal consequences. This resulted in UULA creating an &quot;unofficial special constabulary&quot;, with members drawn chiefly from the shipyards, tasked with &quot;policing&quot; Protestant areas. Carson and Craig need to establish a militant basis for resistance to republicanism, wished to reconstitute the UVF which could operate independently of the British. They then set about securing British government approval and funds for the UULA constabularies in Belfast, along with the UVF.

While Neville Macready commander-in-chief of the British army in Ireland withheld his approval, he and his supporters in the Irish administration were over-ridden; David Lloyd George&#x27;s government approved from the beginning and granted official status in the form of the B Specials in November 1920. This official endorsement would shape both the formation of the state of Northern Ireland and Catholic feelings to it.

==Other activities==
Besides its opposition to a united Ireland and to socialism, the association did not make serious attempts to speak on behalf of loyalist workers. However, it did organise some limited adult education in its early days, and opened two working men&#x27;s clubs in East and North Belfast. The association was also able to appoint twenty delegates to the Ulster Unionist Council as late as the early 1970s.

==Decline==
The organisation was never able to attract leading trade unionists, and soon declined in importance. While Andrews and William Grant were initially able to speak on its behalf in the Parliament of Northern Ireland, in later years only the less prominent John William Kennedy and occasional senators sat in the Stormont Parliament.

The Great Depression saw many workers look instead to the official trade union movement and the Northern Ireland Labour Party, and many branches of the UULA became moribund. A drive to reinvigorate the UULA was launched in the 1950s, although only one new branch was formed, in Derry.

In the 1970s, its role as a movement for the mobilisation of the loyalist working classes was taken over by more militant groups such as the Loyalist Association of Workers and the Ulster Workers&#x27; Council.

Already by the early 1970s, the association&#x27;s primary role was organising the wreath-laying at the annual memorial service for Carson, and today it exists solely to perform this ceremonial role.

<doc id="918753" wikidata="Q1324207" url="?curid=918753" title="Canadian cuisine">
<text>Canadian cuisine consists of the cooking traditions and practices of Canada, with regional variances around the country. First Nations and Inuit have practiced their culinary traditions in what is now Canada for at least 15,000 years. The advent of European explorers and settlers, first on the east coast and then throughout the wider territories of New France, British North America and Canada, saw the melding of foreign recipes, cooking techniques, and ingredients with indigenous flora and fauna. Modern Canadian cuisine has maintained this dedication to local ingredients and &quot;terroir&quot;, as exemplified in the naming of specific ingredients based on their locale, such as Malpeque oysters or Alberta beef. Accordingly, Canadian cuisine privileges the quality of ingredients and regionality, and may be broadly defined as a national tradition of &quot;creole&quot; culinary practices, based on the complex multicultural and geographically diverse nature of both historical and contemporary Canadian society.

Divisions within Canadian cuisine can be traced along regional lines and have a direct connection to the historical immigration patterns of each region or province. The earliest cuisines of Canada are based on Indigenous, English, Scottish and French roots. The traditional cuisines of both French- and English-Canada have evolved from those carried over to North America from France and the British Isles respectively, and from their adaptation to Indigenous customs, labour-intensive and/or mobile lifestyles, and hostile environmental conditions. French Canadian cuisine can also be divided into Québécois cuisine and Acadian cuisine. Regional cuisines have continued to develop with subsequent waves of immigration during the 19th, 20th, and 21st centuries, such as from Central Europe, Southern Europe, Eastern Europe, South Asia, East Asia, and the Caribbean. There are many culinary practices and dishes that can be either identified as particular to Canada, such fish and brewis, peameal bacon, and ginger beef, or sharing an association with countries from which immigrants to Canada carried over their cuisine, such as fish and chips, roast beef, and bannock.

==Definitions==
Though certain dishes may be identified as &quot;Canadian&quot; due to the ingredients used or the origin of their inception, an overarching style of Canadian cuisine may be more difficult to define. Some commentators, such as former prime minister Joe Clark, believe Canadian cuisine to be a collage of dishes from a variety of cultures. Clark himself has been paraphrased to have noted that &quot;Canada has a cuisine of cuisines. Not a stew pot, but a smorgasbord.&quot; Canadian food culture writer and author Jennifer Cochrall-King has said that &quot;there is no single definition of Canadian cuisine. It starts with ingredients that spring from the landscape and with traditional dishes steeped in the region&#x27;s history and culture.&quot;

While the immense size of Canada, and the diversity of its inhabitants, compounds the difficulty in identifying a monolithic Canadian culinary tradition, Hersch Jacobs acknowledges that the lack of a hegemonic definition does not preclude the existence of Canadian cuisine. Lenore Newman argues that there is a distinctly Canadian creole cuisine, and identifies five key properties that together define Canadian cuisine: its reliance on seasonality, multiculturalism, wild foods, regional dishes, and the privileging of ingredients over recipes. This adaptation, preparation, and emphasis on specific local ingredients is of particular note, and a common theme in Canadian food is the use of foreign recipes, introduced by immigrants and their descendants, that have been modified for use of local products. Tourtière, for example, is a Canadian meat pie of French origin that can be cooked with beef, pork or fish. The sections on regionality and national foods below illustrate this tradition of diversity and emphasis on local elements, such as dulse and lobster in the Maritimes, deer meats in the Northern Territories, salmon and crab in British Columbia, or maple syrup in Central Canada.

Indigenous food may be considered uniquely Canadian, and the influence of Métis culture can be considered to have played a particularly important role in the origin of a distinct Canadian cuisine. Foods such as bannock, moose, deer, bison, pemmican, maple taffy, and Métis stews, such as barley stew, are all either traditional Indigenous foods, or originate from Canada with roots in Indigenous cuisines, and are eaten throughout the country.

There are many foods of foreign origin that are eaten commonly and considered integrated constituents of Canadian cuisine. Pierogies (dumplings of Central and Eastern European origin) are an example of this, due to the large number of early Ukrainian and Polish immigrants, while the ubiquity of roast beef and Yorkshire pudding are an example of the heavy English influence. As much of Canadian cuisine is coloured by the adaptation and development of dishes brought over by European, and later Asian, settlers, there is a variety of noteworthy Canadian variations on pre-established templated food and drink, with their own nationally defined particularities, such as Canadian cheddar cheese, whisky, bread, wine, bacon, and pancakes.

In general, much of what is considered to be traditional Canadian cuisine contains strong elements of richness, breads and starches, game meat, and often stews and soups. Certain culinary traditions in Canada, such as the frying of dough, which developed out of the country&#x27;s voyaging and frontier culture, have seen to both the creation of distinct national foods and the flourishing of a broader national association with certain types of dishes. In the case of frying dough, for example, particular foods originating from Canada would include beavertails, apple fritters and toutons, whilst foods such as doughnuts, cronuts, bannock, bagels, and pancakes, though not physically originating from Canada, have nonetheless developed within a broader tradition of nationally recognized cuisine.

==History==

Canadian cuisine has been shaped by the historical and ongoing influences of Indigenous peoples, settlers and immigrants. Indigenous influences remain prevalent in Canada&#x27;s contemporary food scene, alongside those of the three major immigrant groups of the 17th and 18th centuries: English, Scottish, and French. This diversity has been further expanded by subsequent waves of immigration in later centuries.

=== Indigenous ===

The traditional Indigenous cuisine of Canada is based on a mixture of wild game, foraged foods, and farmed agricultural products. Indigenous peoples are known to gather more than five-hundred plant species for food. They cultivate and forage a variety of plants, hunt a diversity of animals, and use various tools to boil, smoke/preserve and roast their food. Each region of Canada, with its own First Nations and Inuit peoples, utilizes local resources and distinct preparation techniques for their cuisines.

Maple syrup was first collected and used by the Indigenous people of Eastern Canada and the north-eastern United States, and Canada remains the world&#x27;s largest producer. Though the origin of maple syrup production is not clear, the earliest known syrups were made by repeatedly freezing the collected maple sap and removing the ice to concentrate the sugar in the remaining sap. Maple syrup is one of the most commonly consumed Canadian food of Indigenous origin.

Dried meat products such as and pemmican are commonly consumed by the Indigenous peoples of the plains. In particular, the former was a predecessor for North American-style beef jerky, with the processing methods adapted for beef.

In most of the Canadian West Coast and Pacific Northwest, Pacific salmon is an important food resource to the First Nations peoples, along with certain marine mammals. Salmon are consumed fresh during the spawning season, or smoked dry to create a jerky-like food that can be stored year-round. The latter food is commonly known and sold as &quot;salmon jerky&quot;.

Whipped soapberry, known as (sk-HOO-shum, &quot;Indian ice cream&quot;) in the Interior Salish languages of British Columbia, is consumed similarly to ice cream or as a cranberry-cocktail-like drink. It is known for being a kidney tonic, which are called &quot;agutak&quot; in Arctic Canada (with animal/fish fat).
In the Arctic, Inuit people traditionally survived on a diet consisting of land and marine mammals, fish, and foraged plant products. Meats were consumed fresh, but also often prepared, cached, and allowed to ferment into &quot;igunaq&quot; or &quot;kiviak&quot;. These fermented meats have the consistency and smell of certain soft aged cheeses. Snacks such as &quot;muktuk&quot;, which consist of whale skin and blubber is eaten plain, though occasionally dipped in soy sauce. Chunks of muktuk are sliced with an &quot;ulu&quot; prior to or during consumption.

Fish are eaten boiled, fried, and prior to today&#x27;s settlements, often in dried forms. The so-called &quot;Eskimo potato&quot;, (Inuit: &quot;oak-kuk&quot;: &quot;Claytonia tuberosa&quot;) and other &quot;mousefoods&quot;, are some of the plants consumed in the Arctic.

Foods such as &quot;bannock&quot;, popular with First Nations and Inuit, reflect the historic exchange of these cultures with European fur traders, who brought with them new ingredients and foods. Common contemporary consumption of bannock, powdered milk, and bologna by Indigenous Canadians reflects the legacy of Canadian colonialism in the prohibition of hunting and fishing, and the institutional food rations provided to Indian reserves. Due to similarities in treatment under colonialism, many Native American communities throughout the continent consume similar food items, with some emphasis on local ingredients.

=== North and West European ===


Settlers and traders from the British Isles account for the culinary influences of early English Canada in the Maritime provinces and Southern Ontario (Upper Canada). Cuisines found in Newfoundland and the Maritimes derive largely from British and Irish cooking, with a preference for salt-cured fish, beef, and pork. Ontario, Manitoba and British Columbia also maintain strong British culinary traditions. The French settlers of New France, who would become the Canadiens and Acadians, account for much of the cuisine of southern Quebec (Lower Canada), Northeastern Ontario, and New Brunswick.

Seafood had an important influence on the early European settlers and explorers of Atlantic Canada, which continues to be expressed in Maritime cuisine and culture to this day. In the late 15th-century, John Cabot&#x27;s journey to the shores of what would become Newfoundland brought England knowledge of the Grand Banks and their abundance in cod. He is reported to have told King Henry VII that &quot;the sea was covered with fish which could be caught not merely by nets, but weighted basket lowered into the water.&quot; Fleets of fishermen from England, France, Portugal, and Spain flocked to Newfoundland to return with fish, filling a market need in Europe and cutting out the necessity of importing from Iceland. The English, Scottish, Irish, and French settlers of what would become the Atlantic provinces frequently built their communities beside the ocean and rivers for easy access, and the fishing industry along the Canadian east coast steadily expanded until it became the region&#x27;s major industry. Accounts from early settlers list fish that were caught, sold, and incorporated into local meals, such as trout, eels, mackerel, oysters, lobsters, salmon, cod and herring. Meals that incorporated such fish included, and continue to include, fried cod roe, fried or baked cod tongues, stewed or fried cod heads, fish hash, codfish balls, cod sounds, toast and fish, roasted scrawn, fish and brewis, salt fish and potatoes, and boiled rounders, among others. The abundance of seafood and the ease by which it could be obtained made the British and French colonies of Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Acadia, Prince Edward Island, and Newfoundland and Labrador attractive destinations for settlers.
The influx of United Empire Loyalists into British North America in the 18th century, and the subsequent establishment of Upper Canada, saw the wider expansion of British cooking with indigenous ingredients in the future province of Ontario. These settlers established customs similar to their compatriots in England, but with a particular focus on dietary staples, such as meat, bread, and tea. Local forage and game were typically incorporated into the cooking of early English-Canadians in Upper Canada, such as wild berries, maple sugar, venison, partridge, waterfowl, maize, pumpkin, and turkey. Meals often contained more meat than was typical in England and were particularly reliant on pork and potatoes during early settlement, although these meals began to include beef and mutton as farming became more established in the region. Roasting was a common method of cooking for Upper Canadians, and Scottish immigration, largely onset by the Highland Clearances, brought a wider emphasis on mutton.
The Victorian era saw a greater swell of British immigration to Upper Canada, Lower Canada, and the Atlantic colonies, and the urban and rural development that followed encouraged the spread of eating establishments, local cookbooks, and a busier ingredients market. By the mid-19th century, there was a tavern every couple odd miles along the major roads of Upper Canada, and there were reportedly twenty-nine alone along the route between Halifax and Digby, Nova Scotia. The larger urban centres, such as Toronto, Kingston, and Coburg in Upper Canada, Montreal and Quebec City in Lower Canada, and Halifax in Nova Scotia, saw the opening of hotels that could better serve a burgeoning upper class of Victorian patrons. These hotels, broadly, provided beef steak, fried pork, buckwheat cakes, roast beef and pork, wild game and fowl, vegetables, pudding, and tea. Cookbooks published during this period include &quot;The Home Cookbook&quot; (1877) and &quot;The Galt Cook Book&quot; (1898). Traditions that developed out of the Victorian era in Canada include the Victorian cooking fireplace, which saw continued use in homes and restaurants even after the metal stove was introduced, and picnics, which often involved ham, fowl, meat pies, tarts, and cakes.

In the territory of Rupert&#x27;s Land, the development of communities throughout the 17th, 18th, and early 19th centuries, which centred around Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company and North West Company trading posts, saw to the intermingling of European (largely Scottish and French) traders, clerks, guides, and canoers with the local Indigenous population. The resulting genesis of the Métis culture saw to the development of cuisine in the Canadian West which combined the culinary traditions of these previously separate groups.
With the arrival of the Earl of Selkirk and his Scottish retinue (people largely displaced by the Highland Clearances), as well as the purchase of forty-five million acres of land in the Red River Valley, many Scottish culinary traditions were brought to the region. These foods included black bun, haggis, honey cakes, and rowies. Cooperation with the local Métis saw Scottish immigrants hunting buffalo and incorporating game into their meals.
The completion of the Canadian Pacific Railway in the late 19th-century led to a significant influx of not just settlers of British origin, but of also a multitude of different backgrounds, notably Ukrainian, Polish, German, Scandinavian, Belgian, Dutch, Greek, Czech, Slovak, Chinese, American, Mennonite, and Jewish. It is in this way that the Canadian Prairies, or the future provinces of Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba, were a frontier of multicultural community-building in Canada, and the creation of a regional cuisine which absorbed influences from a variety of ethnic, national, and religious backgrounds.

Icelandic immigration has a particular influence on the cuisine of Manitoba, which, besides Iceland itself, has a larger Icelandic population than anywhere else in the world. One example is &quot;vinarterta&quot;, a layer cake filled with prune jam and flavoured with cardamom, and a popular Christmas treat in Manitoba. Bakeries in the province often include other pastries brought over and adapted from Iceland, including &quot;kleinur&quot; (similar to doughnuts), &quot;laufabrauõ&quot; (flatbread decorated with patterns), &quot;kransakaka&quot; (a type of cake with almonds), and &quot;ugbraud&quot; (a rye bread).

Ontario&#x27;s southwestern regions also have strong Dutch and Scandinavian influences.

=== Central and East European ===

In Canada&#x27;s Prairie provinces, which saw significant immigration from Eastern and Northern Europe in the pre-WWI era, Ukrainian, German, and Polish cuisines are strong culinary influences. Such examples include perogies, kielbasa, and babka. Emigration from Russia to Western Canada in the late 19th and early 20th centuries also established a Doukhobor influence, noted in particular for its emphasis on vegetarian recipes on the cuisine of the British Columbia Interior and the Prairies.

The Waterloo, Ontario, region and the southern portion of Manitoba have traditions of Mennonite and German cookery.

Jewish immigrants to Canada during the late 1800s played a significant culinary role within Canada, chiefly renowned for Montreal-style bagels and Montreal-style smoked meat. A regional variation of both emerged within Winnipeg, Manitoba&#x27;s Jewish community, which also derived Winnipeg-style cheesecake from New York City recipes. Winnipeg has given birth to numerous other unique dishes, such as the schmoo torte, smoked goldeye and &quot;co-op style&quot; rye bread and cream cheese.

=== East Asian ===

Chinese immigration to Canada, beginning predominantly in the 1850s, saw to the local modification of dishes imported from Qing China. Much of what are considered to be &quot;Chinese dishes&quot; in Canada are largely Canadian or North American inventions, with Chinese restaurants having tailored their traditional cuisine to local tastes, local ingredients, and a largely non-Chinese clientele. This &quot;Canadian Chinese cuisine&quot; is widespread across the country, with great variation from place to place. Examples of such variation are seen in unique regional dishes, including Calgary ginger beef, Montreal peanut-butter dumplings, Newfoundland chow mein, and Thunder Bay &quot;bon bons&quot;.

The &quot;Chinese buffet&quot;, although found in other parts of North America, traces its origins to early Gastown, Vancouver, . This meal format developed from the practice of Chinese restaurateurs providing a steam table on a sideboard to serve Scandinavian lumberjacks working in local forests and mills.

Japanese-Canadians have had a profound influence on the cuisines of British Columbia and Ontario. Distinct varieties of sushi, such as the B.C. roll and the California roll, originate from the Metro Vancouver region, while sushi pizza was invented in Toronto. Japadog street food in Vancouver is also a popular example of Canadian west coast fusion cuisine.

=== South Asian ===
Indian and South Asian culinary influences are a relatively recent addition to Canadian cuisine, having gained wider prominence in the country during the post-1960&#x27;s era of immigration, despite earlier South Asian settlement in British Columbia dating back to the late 19th century. Indian food is particularly popular in Canada, deriving mostly from Northern Indian cuisine. It is characterized for its use of bread, curry, and use of yogurt and cream for meat-based dishes; it also draws inspiration from South Indian cuisine in its use of sour and spicy combinations.

Unique Indo-Canadian food includes the East Indian roti wrap, which gained popularity in Toronto during the 1980s and 1990s; using North Indian/Pakistani bread and curries as stuffing, local chefs originally drew inspiration from the West Indian roti which had entered the city&#x27;s food scene in the 1960s and 1970s after a wave of Caribbean immigration. Also known as butter chicken roti, the dish is served at many Indian restaurants and fast food locations across Southern Ontario.

Other Canadian food unique to the South Asian community includes &quot;Indian-style pizza&quot; (also known as &quot;Punjabi-style pizza&quot; or &quot;Desi-style pizza&quot;) which has gradually gained popularity since originating in Greater Vancouver during the 1980s. Indian-style pizza has since expanded outside of Greater Vancouver, across other urban centres in western and central Canada with large South Asian populations, including Calgary, Edmonton, Regina, Winnipeg, Ottawa, and Greater Toronto, later expanding to other regions. This type of pizza typically includes sauce with mixed spices and toppings such as cilantro, ginger, spinach, cauliflower, tandoori chicken, butter chicken, or paneer.

=== Southeast Asian ===

Contributions from Southeast Asia to Canadian cuisine includes a style of medium-thick crust pizza Margherita in Toronto. An example of fusion cuisine, the pizza is topped with garlic and basil oil topping, combining an Italian pizza with the Vietnamese tradition of using herbed oil toppings in food.

==Regional ingredients==
While numerous and varied ingredients are commonly found throughout Canada, each region, with its tradition of culinary development, utilizes locally derived ingredients, both wild and agricultural, which are used to define unique dishes. The table below is meant to provide particular examples of regional staples and their key local ingredient.

Wild game of all sorts is still hunted and eaten by many Canadians, though not commonly in urban centres. Venison, from white-tailed deer, moose, elk (&quot;wapiti&quot;) or caribou, is eaten across the country and is considered quite important to many First Nations cultures. Seal meat is eaten, particularly in the Canadian North, the Maritimes, and Newfoundland and Labrador. Wild fowl like ducks and geese, grouse (commonly called partridge) and ptarmigan are also regularly hunted. Other animals like bear and beaver may be eaten by dedicated hunters or indigenous people, but are not generally consumed by much of the population.

Seafood is a very common constituent of Canadian cuisine broadly, but particularly in British Columbia and the Atlantic provinces. West Coast salmon varieties include sockeye, coho, chinook (also known as king), chum (also known as dog salmon), and pink, while salmon used on the East Coast can be broadly defined as Atlantic salmon. Freshwater fish, such as the walleye (also known as pickerel) and lake whitefish are commercially fished in the Great Lakes and are popular in southern Ontario. Both wild-caught and farmed rainbow trout are consumed throughout Canada.

Although the majority of Canada&#x27;s fish yield is captured wild, about 28% of the country&#x27;s yield came from aquaculture in 2018. British Columbia accounts for 49% of the country&#x27;s total aquaculture production volume, while the Maritime provinces account for 46%. Canada is the world&#x27;s fourth-largest producer of farmed salmon, and other species, such as trout, Arctic char, mussels, oysters, and clams are well established industries.

Forage in Canadian cooking can include a variety of berries, mushrooms, Canada rice and herbs. Wild chanterelle, pine, morel, lobster, puffball, and other mushrooms are commonly consumed. Gooseberries, salmonberries, cranberries, strawberries, Saskatoonberries, cloudberries, soapberries, blackberries, blueberries, bilberries, currants, and huckleberries are gathered wild or grown.

Alberta is renowned for its production of beef; in 2016, Alberta&#x27;s cattle herd accounted for 41.6% of the national total. Alberta beef is thought to have a rich marbled flavour due to the province&#x27;s nutritious grasslands and barley. Examples of local recipes that utilize Alberta beef include beef tartare, bistecca, Roast Beef, Sunday roast, short ribs, ginger fried beef, and grilled steak. Canada ranks among the world&#x27;s top 10 per capita consumers of beef.

Saskatchewan is often referred to as the &quot;breadbasket of Canada&quot;; it accounts for nearly 50% of Canada&#x27;s total crop yield and for two-fifths of the country&#x27;s total field acreage. In 2016, canola and spring wheat were the two largest crops, Saskatoon berries accounted for over half of the &quot;fruit, berry and nut area&quot;, and sweet corn was the largest field vegetable crop by area. Saskatchewan also produces most of the country&#x27;s spice yield, particularly mustard, but also caraway and coriander.

===Cheese===
Dairy products became prominent among Central Canadian producers in the 1860s. Ontario&#x27;s first cheese factory opened in 1863, and by the end of the decade, they had expanded to over two-hundred. The 1860s also saw to the start of a shift from wheat production to dairy and livestock in Quebec, which would become the dominant agricultural sector in the province by the early 20th century. Cream and cheese factory production would begin to increase exponentially in both Central and Eastern Canada by the 1880s.

Canada is currently the 12th largest producer of cheese by tonnage, and is considered to be one of the major cheese-producing countries. Canadian cheese is mostly &quot;firm&quot;, with cheddar and mozzarella being the most produced varieties in 2020. Among Canadians, specialty cheese (such as cream cheese, cottage cheese, and parmesan) is the most popular type, with cheddar being the second-most.

==Alcohol==

Canada is considered one of the top whisky-producing countries, and is most renowned for rye whisky. Regulation states that Canadian whisky must age for a minimum of three years and be kept in oak barrels. Canada houses about thirty whisky distilleries across the country, and produces 54.2 million liters. Canadian whisky is noted for its light and smooth style, and though most of it is blended, single-malt and 100% rye are some of the country&#x27;s most desired. The Glenora Inn &amp; Distillery is the only single-malt distillery in North America.
Canada&#x27;s wine industry is over two-hundred years old and includes the wine regions of British Columbia, Ontario, Quebec, and Nova Scotia. Canada&#x27;s first commercial vineyard, the Pelee Island Winery, was established in 1866. There are currently over eight-hundred licensed wineries in the country, with the most recognized wine-producing areas being southern Ontario (most notably the Niagara peninsula), and the Okanagan valley of British Columbia.

==Street food==
While most major cities in Canada offer a variety of street food, each region has specialties which reflect local cultural influences. Montreal food trucks offer shish taouk, the Montreal hot dog, and dollar falafels. Although falafel is available in Vancouver, East Asian-influenced offerings are much more widespread, including sushi, samosas, Vietnamese banh mi subs or Pho soup, Filipino offerings, and various Japanese and Chinese cuisines. In Victoria, British Columbia, vegan and vegetarian burgers are common, as are various seafood take-aways and Mexican-influenced street food. Since 2007, Toronto has encouraged vendors to sell street food from a wider variety of cuisines.

In Western Canada, a version of the Ukrainian garlic-pork sausage, referred to as &quot;Kubasa&quot; (a corruption of the Ukrainian sausage &quot;Kobasa&quot;) is widely available and celebrated. The term &quot;smokies&quot; or &quot;smokeys&quot; may refer to Kubasa rather than frankfurters.

Fusion cultural foods are constantly evolving, such as the Japadog, which tops a hot dog with traditional Japanese ingredients, such as wasabi, teriyaki, shredded daikon radish, or bonito (fish) flakes. Pizza slices are a common street offering. Shawarma is quite prevalent in Ottawa and Windsor, while Halifax offers its own unique version of the döner kebab called the donair, which features a distinctive sauce made from condensed milk, sugar, garlic and vinegar. Ice cream trucks can be seen (and often heard due to a jingle being broadcast on loudspeakers) nationwide during the summer months. Winnipeg has a particularly famous line-up of food truck vendors on Main Street.

Lebanese Canadian fast food restaurants such as Boustan offer their own unique version of poutine called the shawarma poutine, which features shawarma meat on top.

===Street food markets===
Various street food markets exist across the country. Metro Vancouver offers the &quot;Richmond Night Market&quot;, with over two-hundred retail stalls offering predominantly East Asian-inspired food, such as grilled octopus, takoyaki, dumplings, fish sticks, and taiyaki. As well, there is the &quot;Shipyards Night Market&quot; in North Vancouver, which is more varied in its offerings and provides more than thirty-five food trucks per week over the course of its annual run.

In Alberta, notable street food markets include the &quot;Calgary Night Market&quot;, as well as the &quot;Calgary Stampede Night Market&quot;, and Edmonton&#x27;s &quot;What the Truck?&quot;. The Greater Toronto Area runs &quot;Market 707&quot;, &quot;Adelaide Eats&quot;, and &quot;Night It Up!&quot;. Market 707 on Dundas Street is of particular aesthetic note given that it is formed out of refurbished shipping containers. Eastern Canada also maintains several street food markets of note, including Montreal&#x27;s &quot;First Fridays&quot; and Halifax&#x27;s &quot;Trusk-Side&quot;.

==National food of Canada==

Though finding consensus among Canadians in determining a national food or dish can prove difficult, there are nonetheless several items broadly recognized as being representative of Canada&#x27;s national cuisine. Foods typically considered national dishes of Canada include poutine and butter tarts. Canadian back or peameal bacon, as well as Atlantic or Pacific salmon, are also commonly thought of as representative of Canada.

Published by the Statista Research Department, a June 2015 poll asked Canadians, &quot;If Canada were to identify one of the following as official national food, which should it be?&quot; The results revealed Canadian bacon to be the top choice, followed by poutine:
#Canadian bacon (35%)
#Poutine (30%)
#Atlantic or Pacific salmon (17%)
#Beavertail (8%)
#Tourtiere (6%)
#Doughnut (4%)

CanCulture Magazine conducted a 2021 social media poll that sampled from fifty-five Canadians given ten choices. The poll revealed the following results:
#Poutine (38.9%)
#Maple syrup (25.9%)
#BeaverTails (9.3%)
#Peameal bacon and Timbits (7.4% each)

According to an informal survey by &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; conducted through Facebook from collected comments, users considered the following to be the Canadian national dish, with maple syrup likely above all the other foods if it were considered:
#Poutine (51%)
#Montreal-style bagels (14%)
#Salmon jerky (dried smoked salmon) (11%)
#Pierogi/Perogy (10%)
#Ketchup chips (7%)
#Nova Scotian donair (4%)
#California roll (1%)

Canada&#x27;s most &quot;iconic&quot; foods were named in a survey conducted by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, in the summer of 2012, as:
#Maple syrup
#Poutine
#Nanaimo bars, smoked salmon and butter tarts

In 2020, Hayley Simpson identified the &quot;best signature Canadian dishes&quot; as poutine, Nanaimo bars, butter tarts, beavertails, tourtière, pea soup, Halifax donair, Saskatoon berry pie, and Montreal-style bagels. The following year, Reader&#x27;s Digest published an article similarly listing &quot;10 Must-Try Canadian Dishes&quot; as poutine, Canadian bacon, caesar, beavertails, Canadian pizza, butter tarts, Nanaimo bars, split pea soup, tourtière, and ketchup (namely &quot;ketchup&quot; chips).

==Meal formats==

As in other countries, Canadian meals are commonly segmented accordingly to their suitability for the time of day.

Breakfast takes place in the morning and typically consists of a variety of foods, such as toast, biscuits, muffins, scones, pancakes, bacon, bagels, cereals, fruit and eggs, among others. Breakfast condiments are very common and can often include an assortment of jam, cream cheese, peanut butter, marmalade, or nutella. Typical drinks include water, juice, coffee, and tea. Breakfast traditionally occurs before work or school on weekdays, or otherwise soon after waking up in the morning. An archetypal French-Canadian meal may contain more starch-based material, while an English-Canadian meal might consist of more protein.
* Lumberjack&#x27;s breakfast, aka logger&#x27;s breakfast, aka &quot;The Lumby&quot;—a gargantuan breakfast of three-plus eggs, rations of ham, bacon and sausages, and several large pancakes. This was invented by hotelier J. Houston , at his Granville Hotel on Water Street in old pre-railway Gastown, Vancouver, in response to requests from his clientele for a better &quot;feed&quot; at the start of a long, hard day of work.

Coffee customarily refers to a small meal during a break from labour. This involves the consumption of a snack that, although it is the typical drink of choice (hence the name), may or may not include coffee. The Canada Labour Code requires employers to provide 30-minute breaks for every five consecutive hours of work.

Lunch generally takes place around noon. Sandwiches, soups, fruit, nuts, cheese and a variety of snacks are common foods during this meal. Lunches are usually compact, utilitarian, and/or casual, particularly given that they are often eaten at work, school, or otherwise outside of the home.

Dinner usually takes place from anywhere between 17:00 to 19:00, and tend to be heartier affairs based around protein and vegetables. Local flora and fauna are most fully realized during dinner; in the Maritimes, dinner may be more likely to include fish, while the Prairies might include more beef.
* Sunday dinner in Canada is commonly observed as a more formal affair than typical dinners, often involving family and/or guests, and a more thoroughly prepared meal. Roast beef is a common centerpiece, but particular specialties also vary by region, such as traditional Prairie pot roast and Newfoundland Jiggs Dinner.

===Occasions===

* Chinese buffet or smorgasbord is a particular meal system invented in Gastown, Vancouver and prevalent throughout the country. This style of buffet was developed in the 19th century by Chinese immigrants in order to cater to the local clientele of Scandinavian Canadian loggers. Staples of Chinese-Canadian cuisine, as well as North American Chinese cuisine broadly, such as ginger beef, chow mein, and dumplings, are commonly available.
* Christmas dinner in Canada draws from the traditions of both Britain and France. These dinners are typically meant to serve a larger group than is usual, with the &quot;pièce de résistance&quot; often being turkey, roast beef, and/or ham. Sides often include stuffing, mashed or roast potatoes, gravy, cranberry sauce, and cooked vegetables (such as carrots or yams). Pies and cakes are common desserts. Treats during the Christmas season typically include tarts, shortbread and gingerbread, bar, square, and &quot;snowball&quot; pastries, toffee, roll &quot;kuchen&quot; (particularly in the Prairies), &quot;crème brûlée&quot;, and &quot;biscotti&quot;. Easter weekend (April), Victoria Day weekend (May), and Canadian Thanksgiving (October) tend to share certain culinary customs with Christmas, albeit with different ingredients based on seasonality.
* Pancake breakfast is a traditional public meal, particularly in Western Canada, which takes place during festivals, celebrations, and community events. This tradition has roots in the Prairies&#x27; ranching culture, as well as the Christian tradition of Shrove Tuesday. Such events that take part in a pancake breakfast include the Calgary Stampede, Grey Cup festival, and K-Days.
* Potlatch is a gift-giving feast practiced by Indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest. Although the occasion as a whole incorporates complex political, social, and economic elements, feasting is still a central aspect of the practice.
* Réveillon is a long dinner held in the evenings preceding Christmas Day and New Year&#x27;s Eve, and is a traditional practice for French-Canadians across the country. Meals tend to be particularly opulent, and may include lobster, oysters, escargot, foie gras, and tourtière. A traditional dessert for this occasion is yule log.

==Food festivals==

==Livestock breeds and cultivars==
While an abundance of livestock breeds and crops originating from other countries are grown and raised in Canada, there is also a variety of unique breeds and cultivars that have been developed domestically. Below is a selection of various livestock breeds and cultivars that originate from Canada.

Apples

Due to an influx of grain from the Prairies into British Columbia during the late 19th century, via the advent of the Canadian rail network, the province&#x27;s grain production became largely redundant. This allowed for the development of specialized produce industries, such as fruit in the Okanagan. As a result, many of Canada&#x27;s unique apple varieties have been developed in the interior of British Columbia.

<doc id="918768" wikidata="Q23988114" url="?curid=918768" title="Caldera de Taburiente National Park">
<text>Caldera de Taburiente National Park () is a national park on the island of La Palma, Canary Islands, Spain. It contains the Caldera de Taburiente, which dominates the northern part of the island, and was designated as a national park in 1954. The telescopes of the Roque de los Muchachos Observatory are situated very close to the summit.

==Toponym==
The word &quot;caldera&quot; means cauldron in Spanish. &quot;Taburiente&quot; is not a Spanish word but derives from the Guanche language and means &quot;plain, level&quot;.

==Geography==

The Caldera de Taburiente is a topographic depression about 10 km across, and in places the walls tower 2000 m over the caldera floor. The highest point is the Roque de los Muchachos on the northern wall, at 2426 m altitude, which can be reached by road. The &quot;Cumbrecita&quot; is at a lower point in the south-eastern part of the caldera&#x27;s rim. In the south-west, the caldera opens to the sea, through a river-floored valley called the Barranco de las Angustias. (The river is the only permanent stream in the Canary Islands). The Cumbre Nueva is a ridge that starts at the caldera and continues to the south. 

==Geology==

The Caldera de Taburiente is an &quot;erosion&quot; caldera that has been formed by a landslide followed by erosion, without volcanic eruption; therefore, it is not a &quot;collapse&quot; caldera formed by withdrawal of magma from under a volcano during a volcanic eruption with subsequent collapse of the unsupported mountain summit. 

Starting about 4 million years ago, a set of three successive, overlapping shield volcanoes gradually formed in what is now north La Palma. Together, they formed the &quot;Northern Shield&quot;, a volcanic mountain that was about 20 km across and 3,000 m high. The southwest flank of the Northern Shield became unstable, about 525,000 years ago, and the mountain&#x27;s flank collapsed laterally in a debris avalanche landslide that moved the collapsed flank rocks downslope towards the coast and even onto the ocean floor. The valley created by the landslide was then enlarged by erosion.

===IUGS geological heritage site=== 
In respect of its importance in the development of volcanology, &#x27;Taburiente volcanic Caldera&#x27; was included by the International Union of Geological Sciences (IUGS) in its assemblage of 100 &#x27;geological heritage sites&#x27; around the world in a listing published in October 2022. The organisation defines an &#x27;IUGS Geological Heritage Site&#x27; as &#x27;a key place with geological elements and/or processes of international scientific relevance, used as a reference, and/or with a substantial contribution to the development of geological sciences through history.&#x27;

==Wildlife==
The main flora of the national park comprises a large forest of Canary Island Pine, with a population of the endangered Canary Islands Juniper also present. The park has been recognised as an Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International because it supports populations of laurel pigeons, red-billed choughs and Atlantic canaries.

==Human history==
During the Spanish conquest of the Canary Islands in the 15th century, the caldera was the site of the last stand of the indigenous people of the archipelago, a branch of the Guanches known as Benahoaritas. It proved impregnable to the invading Spaniards, and they only defeated the Benahoarita by luring their leader out on the pretext of holding talks.

In 1815, German geologist Christian Leopold von Buch visited the Canary Islands, during which he visited the island of Tenerife where he was taken to the Caldera de las Cañadas. He visited La Palma after he had been to Tenerife, and in his journal he makes it clear that he was able to distinguish between a caldera of volcanic origin and the erosional origins for the caldera Taburiente. Following his return to Germany he published his journal and he introduced the term &quot;caldera&quot; to the geological vocabulary.

In the 1830s, the caldera provided inspiration for some art that combined a study of geology with botany, such as the work of Sabin Berthelot and Felix-Achille St. Aulaire.

<text>Doppleganger is an action-adventure game designed by David T. Clark for the Amstrad CPC and published by Alligata and Americana in 1985.

==Gameplay==
You control a sorceress and also her alter ego (the doppleganger) in a 25 room castle (isometric 3D). Each room has a colour coded door frame - which only the sorceress or the doppleganger can pass through. Some doors are locked and need keys. The entire time, an hour glass ticks away which means you have a very limited amount of time to figure out how to top the hourglass back up. Finding the ingots and returning them to the start screen is also challenging, as you will need to switch between the two characters. Some rooms contain moving nasties that can hurt and kill you, also there are a batch of red spiders constantly chasing after the sorceress.

==Reception==
&quot;Doppleganger&quot; was given mixed reviews, including being rated 51% by &quot;Amtix&quot; and 63% by &quot;Amstrad Action&quot;, and given four out of five stars by &quot;Home Computing Weekly&quot;.

<text>Gartz is a town in the Uckermark district in Brandenburg, Germany. It is located on the West bank of the Oder River, on the border with Poland, about 20 km south of Szczecin, Poland. It is located within the historic region of Western Pomerania.

==History==

The existence of the town was first documented in 1124, when it was part of the Duchy of Pomerania, which had been conquered by the Polish duke Bolesław III Wrymouth. It was then visited by Otto of Bamberg, who was entrusted by Bolesław III Wrymouth with the Christianization of Western Pomerania. The name of the town derives from Old-Polabian from the word * &lt; *gordьcь, meaning &quot;small fortified settlement&quot;. Following the fragmentation of Poland in 1138 it was part of the separate Duchy of Pomerania, which in 1227 fell under the overlordship of the multi-ethnic Holy Roman Empire. In 1236, the castle was the seat of the local Slavic castellan. In 1249 Gartz was granted town privileges by Duke Barnim I the Good. Because of its strategic location on the river, the town was frequently vulnerable during military campaigns. In 1284, it was one of the Pomeranian towns that guaranteed a peace treaty between the Duchy of Pomerania and the Margraviate of Brandenburg. It was granted several privileges by Pomeranian dukes in the following decades. During a Pomeranian succession war, in 1468, the town opened its gates to Brandenburgians, what was taken in other Pomeranian cities and towns as an act of treason. In 1473, the Duchy of Pomerania made an unsuccessful attempt to recapture the town, however in 1477, with the help of the cities of Stargard and Szczecin, Gartz was finally recaptured, which was confirmed in a subsequent peace treaty. In 1502, Bogislaw X, Duke of Pomerania temporarily resided in the town.

The town was devastated in the Thirty Years&#x27; War, the Polish–Swedish War and the Great Northern War in the 17th–18th century. From 1648 to 1720 it was part of Swedish Pomerania, in 1720 it was annexed by Prussia, and from 1871 it formed part of the German Empire. From 1720 to 1945, Gartz was part of the Prussian Province of Pomerania. In the final stages of World War II, in 1945, the town was heavily destroyed. Since the Oder-Neisse line was made the German-Polish border after the defeat of Nazi Germany in the war in 1945, Gartz is now a border town. From 1945 to 1952, it was part of the state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, from 1952 to 1990 of the Bezirk Frankfurt of East Germany and since 1990 of Brandenburg. After the fall of communism in Central Europe and the German reunification, in 1990 Gartz entered a partnership with the nearby Polish town of Gryfino as its twin town, and in 1998 river cruises between the towns were launched. In 1990, the town was assigned to the state of Brandenburg, despite historically belonging to Pomerania. In 1993, a Polish-German school project was established at the local school. The town was affected by the 1997 Central European flood. Many Poles moved to Gartz, and as of 2014, 32 of 62 children in the local kindergarten had non-German parents.

==Geography==
Across the river lies an industrial area of the Polish town of Gryfino.
Gartz is part of Lower Oder Valley National Park.

<text>The National Democratic and Labour Party, usually abbreviated to National Democratic Party (NDP), was a short-lived political party in the United Kingdom. Its predecessors were the &quot;British Workers&#x27; National League&quot;, and the &quot;Socialist National Defence Committee&quot;.

==History==
The party&#x27;s origins lay in a split by the right wing of the British Socialist Party, primarily over issues raised by the First World War. In 1915, Victor Fisher formed the Socialist National Defence Committee along with Alexander M. Thompson and Robert Blatchford. They supported &quot;the eternal idea of nationality&quot; and aimed to promote &quot;socialist measures in the war effort&quot;. The Committee was supported by John Hodge, George Henry Roberts, and for a time by Henry Hyndman who subsequently formed his own party, the National Socialist Party. 

In 1916, this committee formed the British Workers League. It described itself as a &quot;patriotic labour&quot; group, and focused on support for the war and the British Empire and opposition to Little Englander and Cobdenite laissez-faire economics. The League was subsidised by Waldorf Astor through Lord Milner, who consulted with Fisher during the war. The League was supported by Labour MPs such as James O&#x27;Grady, Stephen Walsh and William Abraham.

The League sought to challenge pacificist Parliamentary candidates; this caused a rupture with the Labour Party. Eleven out of thirty-eight of the Labour Parliamentary MPs showed support for the British Workers League; however, many later returned to the Labour Party.

The &quot;British Workers League&quot; reconstituted itself in 1918 as the National Democratic and Labour Party, with the support of George Barnes, MP for Glasgow Blackfriars and Hutchesontown, when he resigned from the Labour Party (Barnes, however, never stood for election under the NDP banner, and was re-elected in 1918 as a Coalition Labour MP). The NDP policy was described as follows, &#x27;Support of the Coalition Government and the war effort. Broadly socialist in outlook and claimed to represent &quot;the patriotic working class.&quot; It was bitterly opposed to the pacifist elements within the Labour Party.&#x27; The group gained the support of the Musicians&#x27; Union and parts of other unions, including some sections of the Miners&#x27; Federation of Great Britain. It was primarily funded by Lloyd George Coalition Liberals.

At its high water mark, the party fielded twenty-eight candidates in the 1918 general election—twenty of them on the Coalition Coupon—and won ten seats. After the election, Clement Edwards was elected chairman of the NDP in parliament.

The National Democratic and Labour&#x27;s remaining MPs joined the National Liberal Party and stood under that label in the 1922 general election. The National Democratic and Labour Party was wound up in 1923, but a grouping continued as the &quot;Empire Citizens&#x27; League&quot; from 1925 until the late 1920s. Its journal was renamed the &quot;Empire Citizen&quot;, which ceased publication in September 1927. Victor Fisher stood, unsuccessfully, for the Conservative Party.

==Election results==
===1918 UK general election===
Some prominent members such as George Barnes were elected as Coalition Labour. Taylor ran as a joint NDP-Liberal candidate, and sat as a Coalition Liberal MP after election.

===By-elections, 1918-1922===
Turnour ran as a joint NDP-Conservative candidate.

<text>Lee Lin Chin (born 1953) is an Indonesian-born Australian television, radio presenter and journalist. She is best known for her association with the Special Broadcasting Service (SBS) network, and presented &quot;SBS World News&quot; on weekends.

Lee Lin has been a news presenter and journalist since the late 1960s and has become popular throughout social media.

In 2016, she was nominated for the Gold Logie becoming the first SBS personality to be nominated for the award in the station&#x27;s 36-year run.

==Early life==
Chin was born in Jakarta, Indonesia to Chinese parents and grew up in Singapore, where her media career began in television and radio in 1968.

== Media career in Australia ==

Chin migrated to Australia in 1980 where she began working for SBS TV as a translator for Chinese language films. Wanting to return to broadcasting, Chin moved to ABC Radio in both Newcastle and Darwin. In 1987, Chin moved to SBS World News, presenting the weekend news, where she remained until her retirement in 2018.

Chin has had many roles throughout her career, including news reading, research, reporting, interviews, selecting and programming music, voice-overs for commercials, and producing in-flight programmes for international airlines.

Chin has also starred in a minor role as a newsreader in the independent Australian movie &quot;Resistance&quot; by Hugh Keays-Byrne. She also had a small role, playing a Thai interpreter, in the 1989 Australian mini-series &quot;Bangkok Hilton&quot;, with Nicole Kidman.

In 2014, Chin started to become involved in SBS&#x27;s &quot;The Feed&quot;, creating small segments where she presents small comedy segments including &quot;Pranked with Lee Lin Chin&quot;, &quot;Lee Lin Chin Versus Maggie Beer&quot;, &quot;Celebrity Chin Wag&quot;, comedic cooking show &quot;Lee Linguine&quot; and most recently &quot;The Real Newsreaders of Sydney&quot; with fellow newsreaders Sandra Sully and Natalie Barr.

On 18 May 2015, she was announced to be Australia&#x27;s spokesperson for the 2015 Eurovision Song Contest. She gave the &quot;all-important&quot; twelve points to the eventual winner, Sweden&#x27;s Måns Zelmerlöw and his song &quot;Heroes&quot;. She returned to this role in 2016 and gave twelve points to Belgium&#x27;s Laura Tesoro and her song &quot;What&#x27;s the Pressure&quot;, and also the following year, where the twelve points were awarded to the United Kingdom&#x27;s Lucie Jones with her song &quot;Never Give Up On You&quot;. In 2018, she was replaced in this role by Ricardo Goncalves.

On 6 August 2015, &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot; revealed that the tweets posted on Chin&#x27;s official Twitter account were ghostwritten by comedian Chris Leben, head comedy writer for &quot;The Feed&quot;. It is unclear how much of an input Chin actually has in overseeing the account, however, an SBS spokesperson insists that Chin &quot;has to see everything that goes out in her name&quot;. Chin&#x27;s depiction on &quot;The Feed&quot; and social media are more or less an exaggeration of herself that are &quot;inspired by&quot; her personality. An SBS insider states that Chin &quot;can be quite funny, which she is never allowed to be on the news&quot;. They believe the key to her success is that &quot;people get to see something they don&#x27;t usually get to see&quot;.

Her &#x27;Chinspirational&#x27; book, &quot;Iced Beer and Other Tantalising Tips for Life&quot;, co-written with Chris Leben, was published in 2016. 

In July 2018, Chin announced her resignation stating that &quot;...working two days a week didn&#x27;t give me enough time to devote to the pub and re-reading the complete works of Shakespeare. So now that I work zero days that issue has been addressed.&quot; She later revealed that in her resignation letter, she stated that the reason behind her departure was due to systemic workplace issues at the broadcaster including a lack of diversity in management and their &quot;lack of consideration and common human respect&quot; for staff.

In October 2018, Chin was placed number 74 on &quot;Maxim&quot; magazine&#x27;s Hot 100 list.

==Personal life==
Chin enjoys travelling and reading, William Faulkner being a particular passion of hers. She is a lover of music, a photographer, a serious film buff and an avid beer enthusiast. Chin speaks conversational Cantonese, Mandarin and Hokkien.

<text>Irish stew () or Stobhach is a stew from Ireland that is traditionally made with root vegetables and lamb or mutton, but also commonly with beef. As in all traditional folk dishes, the exact recipe is not consistent from time to time or place to place. Basic ingredients include lamb, or mutton (mutton is used as it comes from less tender sheep over a year old, is fattier, and has a stronger flavour; mutton was cheaper and more common in less-affluent times), as well as potatoes, onions, and parsley. It may sometimes also include carrots. Irish stew is also made with kid. Irish stew is considered a national dish of Ireland.

==History==
Stewing is an ancient method of cooking meats that is common throughout the world. After the idea of the cauldron was imported from continental Europe and Britain, the cauldron (along with the already established spit) became the dominant cooking tool in ancient Ireland, with ovens being practically unknown to the ancient Gaels. The cauldron, along with flesh-hooks for suspending the meat, eventually became preferred over the spit for feasting purposes, as evidenced by archaeological findings that indicate a predominance of flesh hooks over roasting spits in Ireland and Britain. Many food historians believe that goat was originally the meat of choice, eventually being supplanted by beef and mutton.

The root vegetables and meat (originally goat) for the stew were then all in place, save for the potato, which was introduced to Ireland around the 16th century during the Columbian exchange.

Old Irish recipes are scarce, due to poor documentation, but the first such recipe for Irish stew dates to the 1600s, from southern Ireland, by the O&#x27;Brien family. First compiled by the Countess of Thomond, 1684–1734. It says, &quot;To make an Irish stew of mutton
Season the bones of a neck of mutton with pepper and salt, put it down
with a layer of onions, put them in covered stewpan, to keep in the
steam &amp; as much water as will cover it. The chops must be very tender, but as they are all put down together, the potatoes must be taken out
first, as they burst&quot;. There is an earlier recipe for &quot;Irish stew&quot; from 1613 by Lancelot de Casteau, but this doesn&#x27;t really resemble the traditional Irish stew. The recipe calls for a leg of mutton, garnish a duck, and prepare a peeled head of veal, all ‘à la mode d’Irlande’. 

A 19th-century American recipe was recorded by Helen Stuart Campbell, a professor of domestic science at Kansas State Agricultural College. According to Campbell the stew was made with boneless beef or mutton, trimmed of fat and cut into small cubes, less than one inch square. To its broth were added onions and potatoes, and carrots (if beef was used), with a simple seasoning of salt and pepper. This stew was gently simmered for several hours and thickened with flour before serving.

== Laws and regulations ==
===Canada===
According to Canadian regulations, for commercially produced Irish stew to be labeled as such, it must contain at least 20% mutton, lamb and/or beef, and 30% vegetables. It may also include gravy, salt, various seasonings, and spices.

<doc id="918794" wikidata="Q525198" url="?curid=918794" title="Mea culpa">
<text>Mea culpa is a phrase originating from Latin that means &quot;my fault&quot; or &quot;my mistake&quot; and is an acknowledgment of having done wrong. The expression is used also as an admission of having made a mistake that should have been avoided and, in a religious context, may be accompanied by symbolically beating the breast when uttering the words.

The phrase comes from a Western Christian prayer of confession of sinfulness, known as the &quot;Confiteor&quot;, used in the Roman Rite at the beginning of Mass or when receiving the sacrament of Penance. Grammatically, &quot;&quot; is in the ablative case, with an instrumental meaning.

== Religious use ==
At the sight of the crucifixion of Jesus in the Gospels, &quot;the whole crowd who came together to that sight, seeing what had been done, beat their breasts and returned&quot;.&quot;

In the present form of the Confiteor as used in the celebration of Mass, &quot;mea culpa&quot; is said three times, the third time with the addition of the adjective &quot;maxima&quot; (&quot;very great&quot;, usually translated as &quot;most grievous&quot;), and is accompanied by the gesture of beating the breast.
The Latin phrase &quot;mea culpa&quot; was used, even in an English context, earlier than that. Geoffrey Chaucer&#x27;s 14th-century &quot;Troilus and Criseyde&quot; uses it in a way that shows it was already a traditional religious phrase: &quot;Now, &quot;mea culpa&quot;, lord! I me repente.&quot;

Although the &quot;Confiteor&quot; was not then part of the Mass, it was used in administering the sacrament of Penance. In some forms it already included the phrase &quot;mea culpa&quot;. Thus the 9th-century &quot;Paenitentiale Vallicellanum II&quot; had a thrice-repeated &quot;mea culpa&quot; (without &quot;maxima&quot;) in its elaborate form of the &quot;Confiteor&quot;.

In about 1220, the rite of public penance in Siena for those who had committed murder required the penitent to throw himself on the ground three times, saying: &quot;Mea culpa; peccavi; Domine miserere mei&quot; (&quot;Through my fault. I have sinned. Lord, have mercy on me&quot;).

<text>Mauritius competed at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece, from 13 to 29 August 2004. This was the nation&#x27;s sixth consecutive appearance at the Olympics.

Mauritius Olympic Committee sent the nation&#x27;s smallest delegation to the Games since the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul. A total of nine athletes, six men and three women, competed only five different sports. Boxer Michael Medor was the nation&#x27;s flag bearer in the opening ceremony. There was only a single competitor in archery, boxing, and weightlifting.

Mauritius, however, has yet to win its first ever Olympic medal. Sprinter Stephane Buckland set the nation&#x27;s historical milestone as the first Mauritian athlete to reach an Olympic final with a prospect of bringing home a medal for the team, but managed only to finish strongly in sixth place.

<text>Elisabeth Françoise Eybers (26 February 1915 – 1 December 2007) was a South African poet. Her poetry was mainly in Afrikaans, although she translated some of her own work (and those of others) into English.

Eybers was born in Klerksdorp, Transvaal. She grew up in the town of Schweizer-Reneke, where her father was the local dominee of the Dutch Reformed Church in South Africa church. After completing her high school studies there at the age of 16, she enrolled at the University of the Witwatersrand for a Bachelor of Arts degree, which she achieved &quot;cum laude&quot;.

After her graduation she became a journalist. In 1937 Eybers married the businessman Albert Wessels, with whom she had three daughters and a son. Counted among the so-called Dertigers, she became the first Afrikaans woman to win the Hertzog Prize for poetry in 1943. She won the prize again in 1971.

Her work received many other awards in both South Africa and the Netherlands, including the Constantijn Huygens Prize in 1978 and the P. C. Hooft Award in 1991.

Eybers&#x27; first collection of poems, &quot;Belydenis in die Skemering&quot; (&quot;Confession at twilight&quot;), was published in 1936. Her second collection, &quot;Die Stil Avontuur&quot; (&quot;The silent adventure&quot;), was published in 1939 and was mainly about being a mother.

&quot;Die Vrou en ander verse&quot; (The woman and other poems) was published in 1945 while her fourth poetry collection, &quot;Die Ander Dors&quot; (The other thirst) was published in 1946.

Many other poetry collections followed regularly, including:
* &quot;Tussensang&quot; (In-between song), 1950 
* &quot;Helder Halfjaar&quot; (Bright half-year), 1956 
* &quot;Versamelde Gedigte&quot; (Collected poems), 1957
* &quot;Neerslag&quot; (Precipitation), 1958
* &quot;Balans&quot; (Balance), 1962
* &quot;Onderdak&quot; (Under shelter), 1965
* &quot;Kruis of Munt&quot; (Head or tail), 1973

Later works include the bilingual &quot;Verbruikersverse&quot;/Consumer&#x27;s verse (1997) en Winter-surplus (1999).

Translations of her poems have also been published in German, French, Italian and Hebrew.

Among the settings of her poetry by South African composers are &quot;Die Vreemde Dae&quot; by Cromwell Everson and two song cycles by Hendrik Hofmeyr, &quot;Drie gedigte van Elisabeth Eybers&quot; (1984) and &quot;DIe stil avontuur&quot; (2003) http://www.composers21.com/compdocs/hofmeyrh.htm Dutch composer Bertha Tideman-Wijers used Eybers&#x27; text for her composition &quot;Three Songs on a South African tex&quot;t. Dutch composer Marjo Tal also set several of Eybers’ poems to music.

After her divorce in 1961 she met Pieter Hennipman. They were married from 1974 until his death in 1994. She lived in Amsterdam, Netherlands, and she was buried at Zorgvlied cemetery.
