<text>The Battle of the Bzura (or the Battle of Kutno) was both the largest battle and Polish counter-attack of the German invasion of Poland and was fought from 9 to 19 September. 

The battle took place west of Warsaw, near the Bzura River. It began as a Polish counter-offensive, which gained initial success, but the Germans outflanked the Polish forces with a concentrated counter-attack. That weakened Polish forces, and the Poznań and Pomorze Armies were destroyed. Western Poland was now under German occupation. 

The battle has been described as &quot;the bloodiest and most bitter battle of the entire Polish campaign&quot;. Winston Churchill called the battle an &quot;ever-glorious struggle&quot;.

== Background ==
The Polish plan to defend from the German invasion, Plan West, called to defend the borders. That was dictated more by political than military concerns, as Poles feared that the Germans, after they had taken over the territories that they had lost by the Treaty of Versailles, would try to end the war by keeping those territories. Defending the borders was risky, but the Poles were counting on a British and French counteroffensive, which never came. That made Army Pomorze, under General Władysław Bortnowski, find itself in the Polish Corridor while it was surrounded by German forces on two fronts. Army Poznań, under General Tadeusz Kutrzeba, was pushed to the westernmost fringes of Poland and was separated from its primary defensive positions and from other Polish Armies.

The German offensive proved the folly of the Polish border defence plan during the first days of the war. Army Pomorze was defeated at the Battle of Bory Tucholskie and was forced to retreat to the south-east. Army Poznań, meanwhile, did not face heavy German assaults but was forced to retreat to the east by defeats of its neighbours (Army Pomorze in the north and Army Łódź in the south). Both of them were retreating and so Army Poznań was in danger of being flanked and surrounded by the German forces. On 4 September, Army Poznań moved through Poznań and abandoned it to the enemy although at that point, it was not in contact with any significant German forces. By 6 September, Armies Pomorze and Poznań had linked and formed the strongest Polish operational unit in the campaign, and General Bortnowski accepted the command of General Kutrzeba.

On 7 September, the Polish forces became aware of the German push towards Łęczyca, which, if successful, could cut off the retreat route of Polish forces. By 8 September, advanced German troops reached Warsaw, which marked the beginning of the Siege of Warsaw. At the same time, German forces had lost contact with Army Poznań, and the German command assumed that the army must have been transported by rail to aid Warsaw&#x27;s defence. They were unaware that in fact Army Poznań had merged forces with Army Pomorze, which they considered, since its defeat at Bory Tucholskie, to be no longer a significant threat. On 8 September, the Germans were certain that they had eliminated major Polish resistance west of Vistula and so prepared to cross it and to engage the Polish forces on the other side.

Meanwhile, General Kutrzeba and his staff officers had suspected, even before the German invasion, that it would be the neighbouring armies that would bear the German attack and so they had developed plans at an offensive to the south to relieve Army Łódź. During the first week of the campaign, however, those plans were rejected by the Polish commander-in-chief, Marshal Edward Rydz-Śmigły. By 8 September, Kutrzeba had lost contact with Rydz-Śmigły, who had relocated his command center from Warsaw to Brest. Those factors made Kutrzeba decide to go forward with his plan. His situation was dire, as German forces were close to surrounding his units: the German 8th Army had secured the southern bank of the Bzura river, and the German 4th Army had secured the northern bank of Vistula, from Włocławek to Wyszogród, and its elements were attacking the rear of the Armies Pomorze and Poznań from the direction of Inowrocław and crossing the Vistula near Płock.

== Opposing forces ==
The Polish forces consisted of Army Poznań and Army Pomorze. The German forces included the 8th Army under Johannes Blaskowitz and 10th Army under Walther von Reichenau of Army Group South (&quot;Heeresgruppe Süd&quot;), elements of the 4th Army under Günther von Kluge of the Army Group North (&quot;Heeresgruppe Nord&quot;) and air support (Luftflotte 1 and Luftflotte 4).


== Battle ==
The battle can be divided into three phases:
* Phase I — Polish offensive towards Stryków, aiming at the flank of the German 10th Army (9–12 September)
* Phase II — Polish offensive towards Łowicz (13–15 September)
* Phase III — German counterattack and eventual defeat of the Poles, who withdraw towards Warsaw and 
Modlin (16–19 September)
On the night of 9 September, the Polish Poznań Army commenced a counterattack from the south of the Bzura river, its target being the German forces from the 8th Army advancing between Łęczyca and Łowicz towards Stryków. The commander of Poznań Army, Tadeusz Kutrzeba noticed that the German 8th Army, which was commanded by General Johannes Blaskowitz, was weakly secured from the north by only the 30th Infantry Division, which stretched over a 30 km defensive line while the rest of the army was advancing towards Warsaw. The main thrust of the Polish offensive were the units under General Edmund Knoll-Kownacki, which were known as the Knoll-Kownacki Operational Group (Polish 14th, 17th, 25th and 26th Infantry Divisions). The right wing of the offensive, in the area Łęczyce, included the Podolska Cavalry Brigade under Col. L. Strzelecki, and on the left, advancing from Łowicz to the area of Głowno, the Wielkopolska Cavalry Brigade under General Roman Abraham. These groups inflicted considerable losses on the German defenders from the 30th Infantry Division and the 24th Infantry Division, with some 1,500 German soldiers killed or wounded and an additional 3,000 lost as prisoners during the initial push. The cavalry brigades, supplemented with TKS and TK-3 reconnaissance tanks, moved to threaten the flanks and the rear of the advancing German units.

The German forces were thrown back approximately 20 km, and the Poles recaptured several towns, including Łęczyca and Piątek, and the village of Góra Świętej Małgorzaty. On 10 September, the Polish 17th Infantry Division met the German 17th Infantry Division at Małachowicze. The following day, Polish forces continued their attack and advanced on Modlna, Pludwiny, Osse and Głowno.
Initially underestimating the Polish advance, the Germans decided on 11 September to redirect the main force of the German 10th Army, the German 4th Army, the reserves of the Army Group South and aircraft from 4th Air Fleet towards the Bzura. The forces included the German 1st Panzer Division, German 4th Panzer Division and the newly-formed SS Infantry regiment Leibstandarte Adolf Hitler. German air superiority had a significant impact by making it very costly and difficult for the Poles to move units during the day. The following day, the Poles reached the line Stryków-Ozorków. That day, General Tadeusz Kutrzeba learned that units of Army Łódź had retreated to the Modlin Fortress and decided to stop the offensive and instead sought to try to break through Sochaczew and the Kampinos Forest to reach Warsaw.

On the morning of 14 September, General Władysław Bortnowski&#x27;s 26th and 16th Infantry Divisions crossed the Bzura near Łowicz. The Polish 4th Infantry Division reached the road linking Łowicz with Głowno. At that point, however, Bortnowski ordered the 26th Infantry Division to retreat. He had learned of the withdrawal of the German 4th Panzer Division from the outskirts of Warsaw and was concerned that the Panzer division posed a threat to his men.

On 15 and 16 September, Army Pomorze took up defensive positions on the north bank of the Bzura. General Stanisław Grzmot-Skotnicki&#x27;s group between Kutno and Żychlin, General Michał Karaszewicz-Tokarzewski&#x27;s units near Gąbin and parts of Army Poznań by the Bzura near Sochaczew were ready to begin their drive towards Warsaw. To encircle and to destroy the Polish forces, the Germans used most of their 10th Army, including two armoured, one motorized and three light divisions, which was equipped with some 800 tanks altogether. The attack from all sides on Polish positions started on 16 September with the support of the Luftwaffe. On 15 September, the Poles were forced out of Sochaczew, a town on the Bzura river, and were trapped in a triangle of Bzura, Vistula and German forces. The German 1st Panzer Division, after crossing the Bzura between Sochaczew and Brochów and engaging the Polish 25th Infantry Division, managed to capture Ruszki, but its advance was then halted. Poles began to cross the Bzura near the Vistula, north of Sochaczew, and retreat towards Warsaw. 

The Polish forces were forced to abandon most of their heavy equipment while they crossed the river. On 17 September, German heavy artillery was shelling the crossing north of Brochów, and the largest air operation of the campaign began, with the Luftwaffe attacking the retreating Polish forces.

During the night of 17 September, the main forces of Army Poznań attacked the German forces to break out of the German encirclement between Witkowice and Sochaczew. The 15th Infantry Division and Podolska Cavalry Brigade again crossed the Bzura in Witkowice. In Brochow, the 25th and the 17th Infantry Divisions crossed the Bzura. The 14th Infantry Division was concentrated in Łaziska. At the same time, Army Pomorze marched towards the villages of Osmolin, Kierozia and Osiek.

In the morning, the Germans started their drive towards the south along both banks of the Bzura and were supported by more than 300 aircraft and heavy artillery. German howitzers, taking advantage of their position on the high ground of the Vistula&#x27;s right bank, shelled Polish positions for the entire day. After two days of heavy fighting, with no ammunition or food rations remaining, further attempts at a breakout for the Poles became impossible.

== Aftermath ==
Only a few Polish units managed to break out of the encirclement. The groups crossed the Kampinos Forest and fought German units in the area (such as at the Battle of Wólka Węglowa), then entered Warsaw and Modlin, mostly around 19 and 20 September. Among them were Generals Kutrzeba, Knoll-Kowacki and Tokarzewski, two cavalry brigades (Wielkopolska and Podolska) of General Abraham and the 15th and 25th Infantry Divisions. The remainder (4th, 14th, 17th, 26th and 27th Infantry Divisions), which did not manage to cross the river, surrendered with General Bortnowski between 18 and 22 September. Polish casualties were estimated at 20,000 dead, including three generals: Franciszek Wład, Stanisław Grzmot-Skotnicki and Mikołaj Bołtuć. German casualties are estimated at 8,000 dead.

After the battle, the remaining German divisions rushed towards Warsaw and Modlin and soon encircled both. The Bzura campaign ended in defeat for the Poles, but because of the initial Polish local successes, the German advance on Warsaw was halted for several days. The Wehrmacht was required to divert units from its push towards Warsaw. That helped the Polish units defending Warsaw and its environs to organise their own long-term but ultimately failed defence of the capital.

The campaign also showed the importance of taking initiative, proved that horse cavalry units were still an important factor on the battlefield, proved the importance of air superiority and confirmed that simple numerical superiority still mattered.

<doc id="927470" wikidata="Q568494" url="?curid=927470" title="Single sign-on">
<text>Single sign-on (SSO) is an authentication scheme that allows a user to log in with a single ID to any of several related, yet independent, software systems.

True single sign-on allows the user to log in once and access services without re-entering authentication factors.

It should not be confused with same-sign on (Directory Server Authentication), often accomplished by using the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) and stored LDAP databases on (directory) servers.

A simple version of single sign-on can be achieved over IP networks using cookies but only if the sites share a common DNS parent domain.

For clarity, a distinction is made between Directory Server Authentication (same-sign on) and single sign-on: Directory Server Authentication refers to systems requiring authentication for each application but using the same credentials from a directory server, whereas single sign-on refers to systems where a single authentication provides access to multiple applications by passing the authentication token seamlessly to configured applications.

Conversely, single sign-off or single log-out (SLO) is the property whereby a single action of signing out terminates access to multiple software systems.

As different applications and resources support different authentication mechanisms, single sign-on must internally store the credentials used for initial authentication and translate them to the credentials required for the different mechanisms.

Other shared authentication schemes, such as OpenID and OpenID Connect, offer other services that may require users to make choices during a sign-on to a resource, but can be configured for single sign-on if those other services (such as user consent) are disabled. An increasing number of federated social logons, like Facebook Connect, do require the user to enter consent choices upon first registration with a new resource, and so are not always single sign-on in the strictest sense.

==Benefits==
Benefits of using single sign-on include:
* Mitigate risk for access to 3rd-party sites (&quot;federated authentication&quot;) because user passwords are not stored or managed externally
* Reduce password fatigue from different username and password combinations
* Reduce time spent re-entering passwords for the same identity
* Reduce IT costs due to lower number of IT help desk calls about passwords
* Simpler administration. SSO-related tasks are performed transparently as part of normal maintenance, using the same tools that are used for other administrative tasks.
* Better administrative control. All network management information is stored in a single repository. This means that there is a single, authoritative listing of each user&#x27;s rights and privileges. This allows the administrator to change a user&#x27;s privileges and know that the results will propagate network wide.
* Improved user productivity. Users are no longer bogged down by multiple logons, nor are they required to remember multiple passwords in order to access network resources. This is also a benefit to Help desk personnel, who need to field fewer requests for forgotten passwords.
* Better network security. Eliminating multiple passwords also reduces a common source of security breaches—users writing down their passwords. Finally, because of the consolidation of network management information, the administrator can know with certainty that when he disables a user&#x27;s account, the account is fully disabled.
* Consolidation of heterogeneous networks. By joining disparate networks, administrative efforts can be consolidated, ensuring that administrative best practices and corporate security policies are being consistently enforced.

SSO shares centralized authentication servers that all other applications and systems use for authentication purposes and combines this with techniques to ensure that users do not have to actively enter their credentials more than once.

==Criticism==
The term &quot;reduced sign-on&quot; (RSO) has been used by some to reflect the fact that &quot;single sign-on&quot; is impractical in addressing the need for different levels of secure access in the enterprise, and as such more than one authentication server may be necessary.

As single sign-on provides access to many resources once the user is initially authenticated (&quot;keys to the castle&quot;), it increases the negative impact in case the credentials are available to other people and misused. Therefore, single sign-on requires an increased focus on the protection of the user credentials, and should ideally be combined with strong authentication methods like smart cards and one-time password tokens.

Single sign-on also increases dependence on highly-available authentication systems; a loss of their availability can result in denial of access to all systems unified under the SSO. SSO can be configured with session failover capabilities in order to maintain the system operation. Nonetheless, the risk of system failure may make single sign-on undesirable for systems to which access must be guaranteed at all times, such as security or plant-floor systems.

Furthermore, the use of single-sign-on techniques utilizing social networking services such as Facebook may render third party websites unusable within libraries, schools, or workplaces that block social media sites for productivity reasons. It can also cause difficulties in countries with active censorship regimes, such as China and its &quot;Golden Shield Project&quot;, where the third party website may not be actively censored, but is effectively blocked if a user&#x27;s social login is blocked.

==Security==
In March 2012, a research paper reported an extensive study on the security of social login mechanisms. The authors found 8 serious logic flaws in high-profile ID providers and relying party websites, such as OpenID (including Google ID and PayPal Access), Facebook, Janrain, Freelancer, FarmVille, and Sears.com. Because the researchers informed ID providers and relying party websites prior to public announcement of the discovery of the flaws, the vulnerabilities were corrected, and there have been no security breaches reported.

In May 2014, a vulnerability named Covert Redirect was disclosed. It was first reported &quot;Covert Redirect Vulnerability Related to OAuth 2.0 and OpenID&quot; by its discoverer Wang Jing, a Mathematical PhD student from Nanyang Technological University, Singapore. In fact, almost all Single sign-on protocols are affected. Covert Redirect takes advantage of third-party clients susceptible to an XSS or Open Redirect.

In December 2020, flaws in federated authentication systems were discovered to have been utilized by attackers during the 2020 United States federal government data breach.

Due to how single sign-on works, by sending a request to the logged-in website to get a SSO token and sending a request with the token to the logged-out website, the token cannot be protected with the HttpOnly cookie flag and thus can be stolen by an attacker if there is an XSS vulnerability on the logged-out website, in order to do session hijacking. Another security issue is that if the session used for SSO is stolen (which can be protected with the HttpOnly cookie flag unlike the SSO token), the attacker can access all the websites that are using the SSO system.

==Privacy==
As originally implemented in Kerberos and SAML, single sign-on did not give users any choices about releasing their personal information to each new resource that the user visited. This worked well enough within a single enterprise, like MIT where Kerberos was invented, or major corporations where all of the resources were internal sites. However, as federated services like Active Directory Federation Services proliferated, the user&#x27;s private information was sent out to affiliated sites not under control of the enterprise that collected the data from the user. Since privacy regulations are now tightening with legislation like the GDPR, the newer methods like OpenID Connect have started to become more attractive; for example MIT, the originator of Kerberos, now supports OpenID Connect.

=== Email address ===
Single sign-on in theory can work without revealing identifying information such as email addresses to the relying party (credential consumer), but many credential providers do not allow users to configure what information is passed on to the credential consumer. As of 2019, Google and Facebook sign-in do not require users to share email addresses with the credential consumer. &quot;Sign in with Apple&quot; introduced in iOS 13 allows a user to request a unique relay email address each time the user signs up for a new service, thus reducing the likelihood of account linking by the credential consumer.

==Common configurations==

===Kerberos-based===
* Initial sign-on prompts the user for credentials, and gets a Kerberos ticket-granting ticket (TGT).
* Additional software applications requiring authentication, such as email clients, wikis, and revision-control systems, use the ticket-granting ticket to acquire service tickets, proving the user&#x27;s identity to the mail-server / wiki server / etc. without prompting the user to re-enter credentials.

Windows environment - Windows login fetches TGT. Active Directory-aware applications fetch service tickets, so the user is not prompted to re-authenticate.

Unix/Linux environment - Login via Kerberos PAM modules fetches TGT. Kerberized client applications such as Evolution, Firefox, and SVN use service tickets, so the user is not prompted to re-authenticate.

===Smart-card-based===
Initial sign-on prompts the user for the smart card. Additional software applications also use the smart card, without prompting the user to re-enter credentials. Smart-card-based single sign-on can either use certificates or passwords stored on the smart card.

===Integrated Windows Authentication===
&quot;Integrated Windows Authentication&quot; is a term associated with Microsoft products and refers to the SPNEGO, Kerberos, and NTLMSSP authentication protocols with respect to SSPI functionality introduced with Microsoft Windows 2000 and included with later Windows NT-based operating systems. The term is most commonly used to refer to the automatically authenticated connections between Microsoft Internet Information Services and Internet Explorer. Cross-platform Active Directory integration vendors have extended the Integrated Windows Authentication paradigm to Unix (including Mac) and Linux systems.

===Security Assertion Markup Language===
Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) is an XML-based method for exchanging user security information between an SAML identity provider and a SAML service provider. SAML 2.0 supports W3C XML encryption and service-provider–initiated web browser single sign-on exchanges. A user wielding a user agent (usually a web browser) is called the subject in SAML-based single sign-on. The user requests a web resource protected by a SAML service provider. The service provider, wishing to know the identity of the user, issues an authentication request to a SAML identity provider through the user agent. The identity provider is the one that provides the user credentials. The service provider trusts the user information from the identity provider to provide access to its services or resources.

==Emerging configurations==

===Mobile devices as access credentials===
A newer variation of single-sign-on authentication has been developed using mobile devices as access credentials. Users&#x27; mobile devices can be used to automatically log them onto multiple systems, such as building-access-control systems and computer systems, through the use of authentication methods which include OpenID Connect and SAML, in conjunction with an X.509 ITU-T cryptography certificate used to identify the mobile device to an access server.

A mobile device is &quot;something you have&quot;, as opposed to a password which is &quot;something you know&quot;, or biometrics (fingerprint, retinal scan, facial recognition, etc.) which is &quot;something you are&quot;. Security experts recommend using at least two out of these three factors (multi-factor authentication) for best protection.

<doc id="927476" wikidata="Q865137" url="?curid=927476" title="Flightless bird">
<text>Flightless birds are birds that cannot fly, as they have, through evolution, lost the ability to. There are over 60 extant species, including the well-known ratites (ostriches, emus, cassowaries, rheas, and kiwis) and penguins. The smallest flightless bird is the Inaccessible Island rail (length 12.5 cm, weight 34.7 g). The largest (both heaviest and tallest) flightless bird, which is also the largest living bird in general, is the common ostrich (2.7 m, 156 kg).

Many domesticated birds, such as the domestic chicken and domestic duck, have lost the ability to fly for extended periods, although their ancestral species, the red junglefowl and mallard, respectively, are capable of extended flight. A few particularly bred birds, such as the Broad Breasted White turkey, have become totally flightless as a result of selective breeding; the birds were bred to grow massive breast meat that weighs too much for the bird&#x27;s wings to support in flight.

Flightlessness has evolved in many different birds independently, demonstrating repeated convergent evolution. There were families of flightless birds, such as the now-extinct Phorusrhacidae, that evolved to be powerful terrestrial predators. Taking this to a greater extreme, the terror birds (and their relatives the bathornithids), eogruids, geranoidids, gastornithiforms, and dromornithids (all extinct) all evolved similar body shapes – long legs, long necks and big heads – but none of them were closely related. Furthermore, they also share traits of being giant, flightless birds with vestigial wings, long legs, and long necks with some of the ratites, although they are not related.

==History==
===Origins of flightlessness===
Divergences and losses of flight within ratite lineage occurred right after the K-Pg extinction event wiped out all non-avian dinosaurs and large vertebrates 66 million years ago. The immediate evacuation of niches following the mass extinction provided opportunities for Palaeognathes to distribute and occupy novel environments. New ecological influences selectively pressured different taxa to converge on flightless modes of existence by altering them morphologically and behaviorally. The successful acquisition and protection of a claimed territory selected for large size and cursoriality in Tertiary ancestors of ratites. Temperate rainforests dried out throughout the Miocene and transformed into semiarid deserts, causing habitats to be widely spread across the growingly disparate landmasses. Cursoriality was an economic means of traveling long distances to acquire food that was usually low-lying vegetation, more easily accessed by walking. Traces of these events are reflected in ratite distribution throughout semiarid grasslands and deserts today.

Gigantism and flightlessness in birds are almost exclusively correlated due to islands lacking mammalian or reptilian predators and competition. However, ratites occupy environments that are mostly occupied by a diverse number of mammals. It is thought that they first originated through allopatric speciation caused by breakup of the supercontinent Gondwana. However, later evidence suggests this hypothesis first proposed by Joel Cracraft in 1974 is incorrect. Rather ratites arrived in their respective locations via a flighted ancestor and lost the ability to fly multiple times within the lineage.

Gigantism is not a requirement for flightlessness. The kiwi do not exhibit gigantism, along with tinamous, even though they coexisted with the moa and rheas that both exhibit gigantism. This could be the result of different ancestral flighted birds arrival or because of competitive exclusion. The first flightless bird to arrive in each environment utilized the large flightless herbivore or omnivore niche, forcing the later arrivals to remain smaller. In environments where flightless birds are not present, it is possible that after the K/T Boundary there were no niches for them to fill. They were pushed out by other herbivorous mammals.

New Zealand had more species of flightless birds (including the kiwi, several species of penguins, the takahē, the weka, the moa, and several other extinct species) than any other such location. One reason is that until the arrival of humans roughly a thousand years ago, there were no large mammalian land predators in New Zealand; the main predators of flightless birds were larger birds.

====Independent evolution of flightlessness in Palaeognathes====
Ratites belong to the superorder Palaeognathae, which include the volant tinamou, and are believed to have evolved flightlessness independently multiple times within their own group. Some birds evolved flightlessness in response to the absence of predators, for example on oceanic islands. Incongruences between ratite phylogeny and Gondwana geological history indicate the presence of ratites in their current locations is the result of a secondary invasion by flying birds. It remains possible that the most recent common ancestor of ratites was flightless and the tinamou regained the ability to fly. However, it is believed that the loss of flight is an easier transition for birds than the loss and regain of flight, which has never been documented in avian history. Moreover, tinamou nesting within flightless ratites indicates ancestral ratites were volant and multiple losses of flight occurred independently throughout the lineage. This indicates that the distinctive flightless nature of ratites is the result of convergent evolution.

==Morphological changes and energy conservation==
Two key differences between flying and flightless birds are the smaller wing bones of flightless birds and the absent (or greatly reduced) keel on their breastbone, which anchors muscles needed for wing movement.

Adapting to a cursorial lifestyle causes two inverse morphological changes to occur in the skeleto-muscular system: the pectoral apparatus used to power flight is paedorphically reduced while peramorphosis leads to enlargement of the pelvic girdle for running. Repeated selection for cursorial traits across ratites suggests these adaptions comprise a more efficient use of energy in adulthood. The name &quot;ratite&quot; comes from the Latin &quot;ratis&quot;, raft, a vessel with no keel. Their flat sternum is distinct from the typical sternum of flighted birds because it lacks a keel, like a raft. This structure is the place where flight muscles attach and thus allow for powered flight. However, ratite anatomy presents other primitive characters meant for flight, such as the fusion of wing elements, a cerebellar structure, the presence of a pygostyle for tail feathers, and an alula on the wing. These morphological traits suggest some affinities to volant groups. Palaeognathes were one of the first colonizers of novel niches and were free to increase in abundance until the population was limited by food and territory. A study looking at energy conservation and the evolution of flightlessness hypothesized intraspecific competition selected for a reduced individual energy expenditure, which is achieved by the loss of flight.

Some flightless varieties of island birds are closely related to flying varieties, implying flight is a significant biological cost. Flight is the most costly type of locomotion exemplified in the natural world. The energy expenditure required for flight increases proportionally with body size, which is often why flightlessness coincides with body mass. By reducing large pectoral muscles that require a significant amount of overall metabolic energy, ratites decrease their basal metabolic rate and conserve energy. A study looking at the basal rates of birds found a significant correlation between low basal rate and pectoral muscle mass in kiwis. On the contrary, flightless penguins exhibit an intermediate basal rate. This is likely because penguins have well-developed pectoral muscles for hunting and diving in the water. For ground-feeding birds, a cursorial lifestyle is more economical and allows for easier access to dietary requirements. Flying birds have different wing and feather structures that make flying easier, while flightless birds&#x27; wing structures are well adapted to their environment and activities, such as diving in the ocean.

Species with certain characteristics are more likely to evolve flightlessness. For example, species that already have shorter wings are more likely to lose flight ability. Some species will evolve flatter wings so that they move more efficiently underwater at the cost of their flight. Additionally, birds that undergo simultaneous wing molt, in which they replace all of the feathers in their wings at once during the year, are more likely to evolve flight loss.

A number of bird species appear to be in the process of losing their powers of flight to various extents. These include the Zapata rail of Cuba, the Okinawa rail of Japan, and the Laysan duck of Hawaii. All of these birds show adaptations common to flightlessness, and evolved recently from fully flighted ancestors, but have not yet completely given up the ability to fly. They are, however, weak fliers and are incapable of traveling long distances by air.

===Continued presence of wings in flightless birds===
Although selection pressure for flight was largely absent, the wing structure has not been lost except in the New Zealand moas. Ostriches are the fastest running birds in the world and emus have been documented running 50 km/h. At these high speeds, wings are necessary for balance and serving as a parachute apparatus to help the bird slow down. Wings are hypothesized to have played a role in sexual selection in early ancestral ratites and were thus maintained. This can be seen today in both the rheas and ostriches. These ratites utilize their wings extensively for courtship and displays to other males. Sexual selection also influences the maintenance of large body size, which discourages flight. The large size of ratites leads to greater access to mates and higher reproductive success. Ratites and tinamous are monogamous and mate only a limited number of times per year. High parental involvement denotes the necessity for choosing a reliable mate. In a climatically stable habitat providing year-round food supply, a male&#x27;s claimed territory signals to females the abundance of resources readily available to her and her offspring. Male size also indicates his protective abilities. Similar to the emperor penguin, male ratites incubate and protect their offspring anywhere between 85 and 92 days while females feed. They can go up to a week without eating and survive only off fat stores. The emu has been documented fasting for as long as 56 days. If no continued pressures warrant the energy expenditure to maintain the structures of flight, selection will tend towards these other traits.

In penguins, wing structure is maintained for use in locomotion underwater. Penguins evolved their wing structure to become more efficient underwater at the cost of their efficiency in the air.

The only known species of flightless bird in which wings completely disappeared was the gigantic, herbivorous moa of New Zealand, hunted to extinction by humans by the 15th century. In moa, the entire pectoral girdle is reduced to a paired scapulocoracoid, which is the size of a finger.

==List of flightless birds==
Many flightless birds are extinct; this list shows species that are either still extant or became extinct in the Holocene (no more than 11,000 years ago). A number of species suspected, but not confirmed to be flightless, are also included here.

<text>Camilla Martin Nygaard (née Martin; born 23 March 1974) is a retired badminton player from Denmark. She and Lene Køppen, who played two decades earlier, are the only Danish women to have won both the All England and World Championships singles titles.

== Career ==
She primarily played woman&#x27;s singles. In that discipline she won the Danish national championships 13 years consecutively, from 1991 to 2003, European champion three times, in 1996, 1998, and 2000, and World champion once in 1999. She won All England Open in 2002.

<doc id="927478" wikidata="Q1898252" url="?curid=927478" title="Triacontagon">
<text>In geometry, a triacontagon or 30-gon is a thirty-sided polygon. The sum of any triacontagon&#x27;s interior angles is 5040 degrees.

==Regular triacontagon ==

The &quot;regular triacontagon&quot; is a constructible polygon, by an edge-bisection of a regular pentadecagon, and can also be constructed as a truncated pentadecagon, t{15}. A truncated triacontagon, t{30}, is a hexacontagon, {60}.

One interior angle in a regular triacontagon is 168 degrees, meaning that one exterior angle would be 12°. The triacontagon is the largest regular polygon whose interior angle is the sum of the interior angles of smaller polygons: 168° is the sum of the interior angles of the equilateral triangle (60°) and the regular pentagon (108°).

The area of a regular triacontagon is (with )
:formula_1

The inradius of a regular triacontagon is
:formula_2

The circumradius of a regular triacontagon is
:formula_3

===Construction===

As 30 = 2 × 3 × 5 , a regular triacontagon is constructible using a compass and straightedge.

== Symmetry==

The &quot;regular triacontagon&quot; has Dih30 dihedral symmetry, order 60, represented by 30 lines of reflection. Dih30 has 7 dihedral subgroups: Dih15, (Dih10, Dih5), (Dih6, Dih3), and (Dih2, Dih1). It also has eight more cyclic symmetries as subgroups: (Z30, Z15), (Z10, Z5), (Z6, Z3), and (Z2, Z1), with Zn representing π/&quot;n&quot; radian rotational symmetry.

John Conway labels these lower symmetries with a letter and order of the symmetry follows the letter. He gives d (diagonal) with mirror lines through vertices, p with mirror lines through edges (perpendicular), i with mirror lines through both vertices and edges, and g for rotational symmetry. a1 labels no symmetry.

These lower symmetries allows degrees of freedoms in defining irregular triacontagons. Only the g30 subgroup has no degrees of freedom but can be seen as directed edges.
== Dissection==

Coxeter states that every zonogon (a 2&quot;m&quot;-gon whose opposite sides are parallel and of equal length) can be dissected into &quot;m&quot;(&quot;m&quot;-1)/2 parallelograms.
In particular this is true for regular polygons with evenly many sides, in which case the parallelograms are all rhombi. For the &quot;regular triacontagon&quot;, &quot;m&quot;=15, it can be divided into 105: 7 sets of 15 rhombs. This decomposition is based on a Petrie polygon projection of a 15-cube.
== Triacontagram ==
A triacontagram is a 30-sided star polygon (though the word is extremely rare). There are 3 regular forms given by Schläfli symbols {30/7}, {30/11}, and {30/13}, and 11 compound star figures with the same vertex configuration.
There are also isogonal triacontagrams constructed as deeper truncations of the regular pentadecagon {15} and pentadecagram {15/7}, and inverted pentadecagrams {15/11}, and {15/13}. Other truncations form double coverings: t{15/14}={30/14}=2{15/7}, t{15/8}={30/8}=2{15/4}, t{15/4}={30/4}=2{15/4}, and t{15/2}={30/2}=2{15}.

==Petrie polygons==
The regular triacontagon is the Petrie polygon for three 8-dimensional polytopes with E8 symmetry, shown in orthogonal projections in the E8 Coxeter plane. It is also the Petrie polygon for two 4-dimensional polytopes, shown in the H4 Coxeter plane.
The regular triacontagram {30/7} is also the Petrie polygon for the great grand stellated 120-cell and grand 600-cell.

<doc id="927490" wikidata="Q63695" url="?curid=927490" title="Johann Karl Rodbertus">
<text>Johann Karl Rodbertus (August 12, 1805, in Greifswald, Swedish Pomerania – December 6, 1875, in Jagetzow), also known as Karl Rodbertus-Jagetzow, was a German economist and socialist and a leading member of the &quot;Linkes Zentrum&quot; (centre-left) in the Prussian national assembly.

He defended the labor theory of value as well as the view, which it implied, of interest or profit being theft. He believed that capitalist economies tend toward overproduction.

==Biography==
Rodbertus was also known as &quot;Rodbertus-Jagetzow&quot; from the name of the estate of Jagetzow, in Pomerania, which he bought in 1835. Rodbertus was the son of a professor of law, and himself studied law at Göttingen and Berlin. From these studies he went on to Heidelberg, where he took up philosophy. He travelled extensively in the Netherlands, France, and Switzerland before returning to settle down on his newly purchased estate (Jagetzow).

He served from 1827 to 1832 in the Prussian justiciary. By 1837, he had formulated his social platform, and in that year published &quot;Die Forderungen der arbeitenden Klassen&quot;. Elected to the National Assembly in 1848, he was Minister of Education in the Auerswald-Hansemann ministry for a fortnight, and in 1849 was a leader of the centre-left. After the defeat of the 1848 Revolution, Rodbertus did not participate in politics and the last twenty years of his life were spent in retirement.

==Theories==
Socialism, as defined by Rodbertus, was to be a gradual evolution, hence his acquiescence in a monarchy, and his break with the Democrats as a political party. He regarded the social question as a purely economic one. His principal doctrines are these: The workman&#x27;s share of the nation&#x27;s industrial income tends constantly to decline; land rent and interest are the result of the exploitation of the working classes; the present shares in the distribution of wealth (rent, profits, interest, and wages) are not entirely the result of permanent, universal economic forces, but the result of historical evolution and the prevailing legal system; financial and commercial crises are due to a non-adjustment of production and consumption; the laborer&#x27;s purchasing power is small and the capitalist and landlord classes, instead of increasing their consumption of luxuries, invest their savings in new factories, and in otherwise increasing the means of production, with the inevitable result that commodities of common consumption are produced in excess.

Rodbertus stated the Labor Theory of Value as three connected propositions. First, only those goods that result from labor may be thought to be economic goods; other goods, like sunlight, which do not result from labor are natural goods and consequently have nothing to do with economics. Second, an economic good is solely the product of the labor; any other view of it is to be left to physicists. No part of the value of grain, for example, is to be attributed to sunshine or soil. Third, economic goods are products of the labor that went into their composition and the labor that created the instruments that enabled that production. The value of grain, for example, is not to be found merely in the ploughman but also in the work of those who manufactured the plough.

Eugen von Böhm-Bawerk thought that Rodbertus&#x27; exposition of the exploitation theory was superior to that of Karl Marx in profundity and coherence. However, Böhm-Bawerk published his Capital and Interest, where he made his poignant criticism of the theory of exploitation and the labor theory of value on which it is founded, in 1890, several years before the publication of Volume III of Capital (most of which was written in the 1860s). There, Marx eliminates his simplifying assumption of Volume I that in capitalism commodities tend to exchange according to their &#x27;values&#x27; (i.e., labor-values). Without Volume III it is not possible to have the complete picture of Marx&#x27;s theory of capitalism and, in particular, his theory that commodities exchanged according to their &#x27;production prices&#x27;, which deviated systematically from their &#x27;values&#x27;, or according to &#x27;modified prices of production&#x27; if capitalists had to pay rent to landowners. For Marx, commodities tended to exchange according to their &#x27;values&#x27; only in non-capitalist (or &#x27;simple&#x27;) commodity production in which there is no wage labor (only independent producers) and land is freely available. Nevertheless, he used his sophisticated labor theory of &#x27;value&#x27; for the construction of his theory of surplus-value (which was his theory of exploitation). This was the &#x27;esoteric&#x27; part of his theory, which underlaid the &#x27;exoteric&#x27; part that explained equilibrium prices, wages, and rents. The global surplus-value produced was for him the foundation for profits on capital and rents on land. Böhm-Bawerk considered the labor theory of value fallacious, since it could only be valid in special cases. For example, he argued against Rodbertus that a nugget of gold that falls to earth embedded in a meteorite, and thus not having been produced by labor, would still fall within the purview of economic science.

<text>Aparna Popat (born 18 January 1978) is a former Indian badminton player. She was India&#x27;s national champion for a record equaling nine times when she won all the senior national championships between 1997 and 2006.

== Early life ==
Aparna Popat was born on 18 January 1978 in Mumbai, Maharashtra into a Gujarati family of Lalji Popat and Heena Popat. She studied at J. B. Petit High School in Mumbai and attended a pre-university course at Mount Carmel College in Bangalore. Aparna also holds a bachelor&#x27;s degree in Commerce from the Mumbai University.

== Training background ==
Aparna started playing badminton in 1986 in Mumbai. As an 8-year-old, when she approached Anil Pradhan for coaching, he saw a spark in the girl and told her parents &quot;Give me this girl and I will put her on the map of Indian badminton&quot;. Being a national champion himself, he helped her develop skills required to face the many challenges of the game.

In 1994, she shifted to the Prakash Padukone Badminton Academy in Bangalore to further expand her capabilities. Training under the legendary Prakash Padukone, a former All-England champion, she built up her fitness and learned techniques to be more competitive at the international level.

Yearning to expand her learning, in 2002 she shifted to the Sports Authority of India training centre at Kengeri, Bangalore where she learnt the nuances of the game under coach Gangula Prasad.

== Career ==
Aparna captured her first Senior National title at Hyderabad in 1997. She went on to win the Senior National title till 2006, thereby equaling the Prakash Padukone&#x27;s record of winning nine consecutive national singles titles. She won her last of the nine Senior Nationals titles at the age of 27 after defeating the 15-year-old Saina Nehwal at Bangalore in January 2006.

The highlights of her achievements at the international level are participation in 2 Olympic Games, 1 Asian Games, a silver medal at the World Junior Championships in 1996 and 4 medals in 3 Commonwealth Games appearances. She reached career-high world ranking of 16.

<doc id="927507" wikidata="Q977772" url="?curid=927507" title="Identity and access management">
<text>Identity and access management (IAM or IdAM) or Identity management (IdM), is a framework of policies and technologies to ensure that the right users (that are part of the ecosystem connected to or within an enterprise) have the appropriate access to technology resources. IAM systems fall under the overarching umbrellas of IT security and data management. Identity and access management systems not only identify, authenticate, and control access for individuals who will be utilizing IT resources but also the hardware and applications employees need to access.

The terms &quot;identity management&quot; (IdM) and &quot;identity and access management&quot; are used interchangeably in the area of identity access management.

Identity-management systems, products, applications and platforms manage identifying and ancillary data about entities that include individuals, computer-related hardware, and software applications.

IdM covers issues such as how users gain an identity, the roles, and sometimes the permissions that identity grants, the protection of that identity, and the technologies supporting that protection (e.g., network protocols, digital certificates, passwords, etc.).

== Definitions ==
Identity management (ID management) – or identity and access management (IAM) – is the organizational and technical processes for first registering and authorizing access rights in the configuration phase, and then in the operation phase for identifying, authenticating and controlling individuals or groups of people to have access to applications, systems or networks based on previously authorized access rights. Identity management (IdM) is the task of controlling information about users on computers. Such information includes information that authenticates the identity of a user, and information that describes data and actions they are authorized to access and/or perform. It also includes the management of descriptive information about the user and how and by whom that information can be accessed and modified. In addition to users, managed entities typically include hardware and network resources and even applications. The diagram below shows the relationship between the configuration and operation phases of IAM, as well as the distinction between identity management and access management.

Access control is the enforcement of access rights defined as part of access authorization.

Digital identity is an entity&#x27;s online presence, encompassing personal identifying information (PII) and ancillary information. See OECD and NIST guidelines on protecting PII. It can be interpreted as the codification of identity names and attributes of a physical instance in a way that facilitates processing.

== Function ==
In the real-world context of engineering online systems, identity management can involve five basic functions:

* Pure identity function: Creation, management and deletion of identities without regard to access or entitlements
* User access (log-on) function: For example, a smart card and its associated data used by a customer to log on to a service or services (a traditional view)
* Service function: A system that delivers personalized, role-based, online, on-demand, multimedia (content), presence-based services to users and their devices
* Identity federation: A system that relies on federated identity to authenticate a user without knowing their password
* Audit function: Monitors bottlenecks, malfunctions and suspect behaviors

=== Pure identity ===
A general model of identity can be constructed from a small set of axioms, for example that all identities in a given namespace are unique, or that such identities bear a specific relationship to corresponding entities in the real world. Such an axiomatic model expresses &quot;pure identity&quot; in the sense that the model is not constrained by a specific application context.

In general, an entity (real or virtual) can have multiple identities and each identity can encompass multiple attributes, some of which are unique within a given name space. The diagram below illustrates the conceptual relationship between identities and entities, as well as between identities and their attributes.

In most theoretical and all practical models of digital identity, a given identity object consists of a finite set of properties (attribute values). These properties record information about the object, either for purposes external to the model or to operate the model, for example in classification and retrieval. A &quot;pure identity&quot; model is strictly not concerned with the external semantics of these properties.

The most common departure from &quot;pure identity&quot; in practice occurs with properties intended to assure some aspect of identity, for example a digital signature or software token which the model may use internally to verify some aspect of the identity in satisfaction of an external purpose. To the extent that the model expresses such semantics internally, it is not a pure model.

Contrast this situation with properties that might be externally used for purposes of information security such as managing access or entitlement, but which are simply stored, maintained and retrieved, without special treatment by the model. The absence of external semantics within the model qualifies it as a &quot;pure identity&quot; model.

Identity management can thus be defined as a set of operations on a given identity model, or more generally, as a set of capabilities with reference to it.

In practice, identity management often expands to express how model content is to be provisioned and reconciled among multiple identity models. The process of reconciling accounts may also be referred to as de-provisioning.

=== User access ===
User access enables users to assume a specific digital identity across applications, which enables access controls to be assigned and evaluated against this identity. The use of a single identity for a given user across multiple systems eases tasks for administrators and users. It simplifies access monitoring and verification and allows the organizations to minimize excessive privileges granted to one user. Ensuring user access security is crucial in this process, as it involves protecting the integrity and confidentiality of user credentials and preventing unauthorized access. Implementing robust authentication mechanisms, such as multi-factor authentication (MFA), regular security audits, and strict access controls, helps safeguard user identities and sensitive data. User access can be tracked from initiation to termination of user access.

When organizations deploy an identity management process or system, their motivation is normally not primarily to manage a set of identities, but rather to grant appropriate access rights to those entities via their identities. In other words, access management is normally the motivation for identity management and the two sets of processes are consequently closely related.

=== Services ===
Organizations continue to add services for both internal users and by customers. Many such services require identity management to properly provide these services. Increasingly, identity management has been partitioned from application functions so that a single identity can serve many or even all of an organization&#x27;s activities.

For internal use identity management is evolving to control access to all digital assets, including devices, network equipment, servers, portals, content, applications and/or products.

Services often require access to extensive information about a user, including address books, preferences, entitlements and contact information. Since much of this information is subject to privacy and/or confidentiality requirements, controlling access to it is vital.

Identity federation comprises one or more systems that share user access and allow users to log in based on authenticating against one of the systems participating in the federation. This trust between several systems is often known as a &quot;circle of trust&quot;. In this setup, one system acts as the identity provider (IdP) and other systems act as service providers (SPs). When a user needs to access some service controlled by SP, they first authenticate against the IdP. Upon successful authentication, the IdP sends a secure &quot;assertion&quot; to the SP. &quot;SAML assertions, specified using a markup language intended for describing security assertions, can be used by a verifier to make a statement to a relying party about the identity of a claimant. SAML assertions may optionally be digitally signed.&quot;

== System capabilities ==
In addition to creation, deletion, modification of user identity data either assisted or self-service, identity management controls ancillary entity data for use by applications, such as contact information or location.
* Authentication: Verification that an entity is who/what it claims to be using a password, biometrics such as a fingerprint, or distinctive behavior such as a gesture pattern on a touchscreen.
* Authorization: Managing authorization information that defines what operations an entity can perform in the context of a specific application. For example, one user might be authorized to enter a sales order, while a different user is authorized to approve the credit request for that order.
* Roles: Roles are groups of operations and/or other roles. Users are granted roles often related to a particular job or job function. Roles are granted authorizations, effectively authorizing all users which have been granted the role. For example, a user administrator role might be authorized to reset a user&#x27;s password, while a system administrator role might have the ability to assign a user to a specific server.
* Delegation: Delegation allows local administrators or supervisors to perform system modifications without a global administrator or for one user to allow another to perform actions on their behalf. For example, a user could delegate the right to manage office-related information.
* Interchange: The SAML protocol is a prominent means used to exchange identity information between two identity domains. OpenID Connect is another such protocol.

== Privacy ==
Putting personal information onto computer networks necessarily raises privacy concerns. Absent proper protections, the data may be used to implement a surveillance society.

Social web and online social networking services make heavy use of identity management. Helping users decide how to manage access to their personal information has become an issue of broad concern.

== Research ==
Research related to the management of identity covers disciplines such as technology, social sciences, humanities and the law.

Decentralized identity management is identity management based on decentralized identifiers (DIDs).

=== European research ===
Within the Seventh Research Framework Programme of the European Union from 2007 to 2013, several new projects related to Identity Management started.

The PICOS Project investigates and develops a state-of-the-art platform for providing trust, privacy and identity management in mobile communities.

SWIFT focuses on extending identity functions and federation to the network while addressing usability and privacy concerns and leverages identity technology as a key to integrate service and transport infrastructures for the benefit of users and the providers.

==== Ongoing projects ====
Ongoing projects include Future of Identity in the Information Society (FIDIS), GUIDE, and PRIME.

=== Publications ===
Academic journals that publish articles related to identity management include:
* &quot;Ethics and Information Technology&quot;
* &quot;Identity in the Information Society&quot;
* &quot;Surveillance &amp; Society&quot;

Less specialized journals publish on the topic and, for instance, have special issues on identity such as:
* &quot;Online Information Review&quot;.

=== Standardization ===
ISO (and more specifically ISO/IEC JTC 1, SC27 IT Security techniques WG5 Identity Access Management and Privacy techniques) is conducting some standardization work for identity management , such as the elaboration of a framework for identity management, including the definition of identity-related terms. The published standards and current work items includes the following:
* ISO/IEC 24760-1 a framework for identity management Part 1: Terminology and concepts
* ISO/IEC 24760-2 a framework for identity management Part 2: Reference architecture and requirements
* ISO/IEC DIS 24760-3 a framework for identity management Part 3: Practice
* ISO/IEC 29115 entity authentication assurance
* ISO/IEC 29146 a framework for access management
* ISO/IEC CD 29003 identity proofing and verification
* ISO/IEC 29100 privacy framework
* ISO/IEC 29101 privacy architecture
* ISO/IEC 29134 privacy impact assessment methodology

== Organization implications ==
In each organization there is normally a role or department that is responsible for managing the schema of digital identities of their staff and their own objects, which are represented by object identities or object identifiers (OID).
The organizational policies and processes and procedures related to the oversight of identity management are sometimes referred to as &quot;Identity Governance and Administration&quot; (IGA). How effectively and appropriately such tools are used falls within scope of broader governance, risk management, and compliance regimes.

Since 2016 identity and access management professionals have their own professional organization, IDPro. In 2018 the committee initiated the publication of An Annotated Bibliography, listing a number of important publications, books, presentations and videos.

==Management systems==
An identity-management system refers to an information system, or to a set of technologies that can be used for enterprise or cross-network identity management.

The following terms are used in relationship with &quot;identity-management system&quot;:
* Access-governance system
* Identity and access management system
* Entitlement-management system
*User provisioning system

Identity management, otherwise known as identity and access management (IAM) is an identity security framework that works to authenticate and authorize user access to resources such as applications, data, systems, and cloud platforms. It seeks to ensure only the right people are being provisioned to the right tools, and for the right reasons. As our digital ecosystem continues to advance, so does the world of identity management.

&quot;Identity management&quot; and &quot;access and identity management&quot; (or AIM) are terms that are used interchangeably under the title of identity management while identity management itself falls under the umbrella of IT security and information privacy and privacy risk as well as usability and e-inclusion studies.

== Standards ==
* SAML 2.0
* OAuth
* OpenID
* Liberty Alliance – A consortium promoting federated identity management
* Shibboleth (Internet2) – Identity standards targeted towards educational environments
* Global Trust Center
* Central Authentication Service
* NIST SP 800-63

<text>Yao Jie (; born 10 April 1977) is a Chinese-born badminton player who now resides in the Netherlands.

Yao is one of a number of badminton players who have emigrated from China, in part, because the depth of badminton talent in that country has made it difficult for them to be selected for major international competitions. Prior to her move to the Netherlands, she won the BWF World Junior Championships in girls&#x27; doubles with Liu Lu in 1994 at Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, and helped the Chinese national women&#x27;s team clinch a gold medal at the 1997 East Asian Games. But her passion was for the ladies singles event.

Since moving to the Netherlands Yao Jie has won the women&#x27;s singles event 4 times at the Dutch Open (2003, 2008, 2009 &amp; 2011), she won the Thailand Open twice (2004, 2005), and the biennial European Championships once (2002), and a high number of 11 Dutch National Championships. Nine times the Dutch crown in singles and twice in doubles. She was also a 3-times European bronze medalist in the 2004, 2006 European Badminton Championships and 2012 European Badminton Championships. She won the Velo Dutch International twice, in 2001 beating Mia Audina 9–11, 11–1, 13–10 and in 2012 beating Malaysian Sonia Su Ya Cheah 19–21, 21–9, 21–12 in the final. She also won the Italian International in 2011 beating Bulgarian Petya Nedelcheva in the final 21–11, 21–17 and won the Finnish International Open in 2012 beating Canadian Michelle Li 22–20, 21–19. Yao Jie was a runner-up to Zhang Ning at the China Open in 2006, runner-up to Juliane Schenk of Germany at the 2010 Dutch Open, runner-up to Li Xuerui of China at the 2011 Bitburger Open Grand Prix Gold and runner-up to Juliane Schenk at the 2012 Bitburger Open Grand Prix Gold.

Her performances at 2004 Olympic Games and at recent BWF World Championships have not been among her strongest. She was eliminated in the round of 16 at the Athens Games by Hong Kong&#x27;s Wang Chen and has proceeded no farther than that round in any of her World Championship appearances. A big disappointment was her non-participation at the 2008 Olympic Games in her native China, despite being qualified by the international norm, but not by the stricter Dutch qualifying norm. In January 2009 Yao Jie married Dutch player Eric Pang.

In March 2011 Yao Jie was part of the Dutch Fource team, together with Dutch top players Dicky Palyama, Judith Meulendijks and Eric Pang. This team was formed as a result of a conflict with the Nederlandse Badminton Bond sponsored by Yonex, and these four players were non Yonex sponsored players, Yao Jie playing for sponsor Carlton. The conflict heightened in 2011 when these four non Yonex sponsored players were not included in the National squad to play the European Team Championships in Amsterdam. Despite all these juridical sponsor wranglings, Yao Jie managed to qualify for the London Olympics. At the 2012 Olympic Games in the Women&#x27;s Singles Yao Jie won Group F by beating Akvilė Stapušaitytė of Lithuania 21–16, 21–7 and Ragna Ingólfsdóttir of Iceland 21–12, 25–23. After the group stage, in the knock-out stage round of 16 Yao Jie lost to Saina Nehwal of India 14–21, 16–21. Saina later progressed to win India&#x27;s first Olympic badminton medal, a bronze.

Nowadays Yao Jie has her own Badminton Academy at her hometown Wuhan in China and is ambassador for Dutch Badminton in sports and cultural exchanges between the Netherlands and China.

<doc id="927517" wikidata="Q910477" url="?curid=927517" title="Buick Centurion">
<text>The Buick Centurion is a full-size car built from the 1971 through 1973 model years. Replacing the Wildcat as the sporty iteration of Buick&#x27;s three full-size car lines, it was positioned between the LeSabre and Electra in the lineup. The Centurion name was inspired by a Buick concept car, the name coming from that of an officer in the Roman Army. The car&#x27;s emblem was not the traditional Buick tri-shield, but a side profile of a centurion.

The Centurion shared a trim package implementation shared with the Chevrolet Caprice, Pontiac Grand Ville and the Oldsmobile Delta 88 Royale as a hardtop coupe, sedan and convertible.

== 1956 GM Motorama showcar ==

The Centurion name was first used on a Buick concept car in the 1956 Motorama. It featured a red and white fiberglass body, airplane-like interior design, a fully clear &quot;bubble top&quot; roof and the first backup camera in place of a rear-view mirror, although it was never shown to be functional.

This car currently resides in the Sloan Museum at the Flint Cultural Center in Flint, Michigan.

== 1971–1973 ==
First seen on a concept car, the Centurion was nearly identical to the contemporaneous Buick LeSabre, differing in badging and grillework, minimal chrome trim, and an absence of the VentiPorts found on other full-size Buicks. Body styles included two-door and four-door hardtops and a convertible. There were no pillared sedans. The two-door hardtop shared the handsome semi-fastback roofline with the LeSabre and other GM B-body cars (such as the Chevrolet Impala Sport Coupe and the Olds Delta 88) along with a standard vinyl roof.

===1971===

Replacing the Wildcat as the mid-line full-sized Buick positioned between the lower-priced LeSabre and the larger and more luxurious C-body Electra 225, the Centurion was promoted more as a mid-level luxury car than the Wildcat, which was marketed as a sporty/luxury performance car. The Centurion was offered initially with only the big-block V8 in two power output ranges determined by the presence of either a single or dual exhaust. The 1971 Centurion produced at 4400 rpm and of torque at 2800 rpm with the base 455. The Centurion was also offered in the 455 Stage 1 and manual transmission configuration as well during the early portion of the 1971 model year, shared with the Buick GSX. This was known as the A9 and B6 Option when ordering the car. What also separated the car from the LeSabre was that when the car would be ordered or recognized as a Centurion it would be branded as a 4P Series as the first two letters of the Vehicle Identification Number.

Interior trim was upgraded from LeSabres with a notchback bench seat including center armrest standard equipment along with more luxurious cloth-and-vinyl or all-vinyl upholstery.

In March 1971, the three-speed Turbo Hydra-matic transmission became standard on all Centurions as well as the lower-priced LeSabres. Variable-ratio power steering and power front disc brakes were standard equipment during the entire model year.

Total sales were 29,398, exceeding the Wildcat by nearly 25%.

===1972===

The 1972 Centurion featured minor appearance changes including a revised vertical bar grille and taillight lenses.

Under the hood, the standard and only available 455 cubic-inch V8 was rated at 250 net horsepower, which represented an &quot;on-paper&quot; decrease from the 315 gross horsepower rating in 1971. This was due to an industry-wide change in horsepower measurements from the gross method by a dynamometer outside a vehicle with no accessories installed to a SAE net method in which horsepower was measured as installed in a vehicle with accessories and emission controls hooked up. Turbo Hydra-matic transmission, variable ratio power steering and power front disc brakes were again standard equipment.

Sales climbed over 20%, to 36,165 for the model year.

===1973===

The 1973 Centurion featured a larger front bumper and new vertical grille shared with LeSabre models along with revised taillights. The two-door hardtop coupe no longer included a standard vinyl roof and the distinctive formal rear window was replaced by a backlight shared with LeSabre coupes.

Under the hood, the standard engine was downgraded to a four-barrel 350 V8 rated at 175 net horsepower. The 250-horsepower 455 four-barrel was now optional.

With the LeSabre convertible temporarily dropped after 1972 and the intermediate-sized Buick lineup (renamed from Skylark to Century for 1973) losing its droptop permanently after the 1972 model year, the Centurion was Buick&#x27;s only convertible offering in 1973. This would also be the final year for the Centurion series, which was replaced for 1974 by the new LeSabre Luxus, which included the convertible reinstated to that line for another two model years. GM would not see another Buick convertible until the Buick Riviera in 1982.

Total Centurion production was 110,539 units, including 10,296 convertibles. With only three years of production, the Centurion had one of the shortest model runs in modern Buick history.

<doc id="927524" wikidata="Q7954823" url="?curid=927524" title="WQXI (AM)">
<text>WQXI (790 kHz &quot;Radio Korea&quot;) is an AM radio station licensed to Atlanta, Georgia. The station has a power of 28,000 watts in the daytime, and 1,000 watts at night. WQXI&#x27;s signal is non-directional during the daytime, and directional at night. As of 2009, the station broadcast in the IBiquity HD Radio AM hybrid digital mode during daytime hours.

==History==

WQXI first went on the air in 1948 as an all-music station, playing pop standards. Their independent status was unique programming as the established stations, WAGA (590 AM, now WDWD), WSB (750 AM), WGST (920 AM, now WGKA), and WATL (1380 AM, now WAOK) were all network affiliates. By the 1960s, WQXI was Top 40 with the moniker &quot;Quixie in Dixie&quot;. Among the station&#x27;s personalities in the late 1960s was Dr. Don Rose, who went on to near legendary status at KFRC in San Francisco.

For a time, it was owned by Esquire Inc. In the 1970s, WQXI became an oldies station. By the 1980s, WQXI was simulcasting with its FM sister station. In January 1990, WQXI began airing an adult standards format. When Atlanta hosted the 1996 Olympic Games, the station simulcast the French radio news channel France Info for several hours a day. During the mid-1990s, WQXI began leasing airtime to various broadcasters, and also aired Spanish-language music for several hours a day as &quot;La Pantera&quot; (The Panther).

The former WQXI-FM &quot;94Q&quot; (originally WDJK) became WSTR (94.1 FM) &quot;Star 94&quot;, and WQXI-TV became WXIA-TV.

On January 1, 1997, WQXI became the Atlanta affiliate of the KidStar children’s radio network; however, this would only last a few months. On April 7, 1997, WQXI flipped to a sports radio format as &quot;790 the Zone&quot;, programmed by Big League Broadcasting under a local marketing agreement with WQXI&#x27;s owner, Jefferson-Pilot Corporation. Jefferson-Pilot merged with Lincoln National Corporation in 2006; in 2010, Lincoln Financial Media bought the assets of Big League Broadcasting and retook full control of WQXI&#x27;s programming. WQXI was the AM radio flagship of the Atlanta Falcons, and until 2013, WQXI was the flagship station of the Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets radio network. The station formerly broadcast the syndicated Yahoo! Sports Radio during the overnight hours.

For many years, WQXI was hobbled by signal issues. Even with its 28,000-watt daytime signal, it only provides grade B coverage to several of Atlanta&#x27;s outer suburbs. At night, it is almost unlistenable outside of Atlanta itself. To solve this problem, it was simulcast in HD Radio on WSTR&#x27;s HD2 subchannel. WQXI&#x27;s audio was also broadcast on Channel 18 of the Georgia Tech Cable Network.

On May 20, 2014, Lincoln Financial Media dropped WQXI&#x27;s local programming and became a full-time affiliate of ESPN Radio. The station&#x27;s Atlanta Falcons broadcasts were not affected by the change.

On December 8, 2014, Entercom announces that it was purchasing Lincoln Financial Group&#x27;s entire 15-station lineup (including WQXI) in a $106.5 million deal, and will operate the outlets under a LMA deal until the sale is approved by the FCC. The sale was approved on July 14, 2015.

On July 1, 2015, ESPN Radio announced it would end its programming on WQXI and move it to Dickey Broadcasting-owned rivals WFOM and WCNN on August 17. After that date, WQXI began simulcasting sister WSTR, effectively taking it back to its roots as an all-music station.

On September 30, 2016, Entercom announced that it had sold WQXI to Kyung Sook Park&#x27;s Atlanta Radio Korea, Inc. for $850,000 plus a time brokerage agreement prior to closing. The sale was approved by the FCC on November 29, and completed on December 14. On December 15, WQXI flipped to the Radio Korea format.

==&quot;WKRP&quot; connection==
In 1978, WQXI provided inspiration for &quot;WKRP in Cincinnati&quot;, a television sitcom about a radio station. Series creator Hugh Wilson dealt with WQXI when he worked in advertising. WKRP&#x27;s early episodes about dropping turkeys from a helicopter and the &quot;dancing ducks promotion&quot;, in which ducks danced on hot plates, were stunts actually done by Jerry Blum at WQXI in the early 1970s. Blum had leased an 18-wheeler from which he tossed hundreds of live turkeys at a suburban Atlanta shopping center.

==2013 controversy==
On June 17, 2013, during WQXI&#x27;s morning program &quot;Mayhem in the AM&quot; hosts Steak Shapiro, Chris Dimino and Nick Cellini mocked New Orleans Saints player Steve Gleason and his battle with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), also known as Lou Gehrig&#x27;s disease. The trio used a robotic-sounding voice to imitate Gleason, who speaks with a voice synthesizer, and told several knock-knock jokes about him. Station management suspended the three hosts as soon as the program went off the air, and fired them later that afternoon. Station vice-president and General Manager Rick Mack apologized for the incident. Shapiro and Dimino subsequently moved to rival WCNN, which overtook WQXI as Atlanta&#x27;s leading sports talk station. WQXI never recovered from the loss of Shapiro and Dimino, a factor behind its decision to become a full-time satellite of ESPN Radio. It soon later became the factor behind WQXI to drop its sports radio format in favor of simulcasting WSTR due to declining ratings because of this controversy.

<text>Ivan Antonovich Kupreyanov (; 1794 – 20 April 1857), also spelled in English as Kupreanof, was the head of the Russian-American Company in Russian America from 1835 to 1840. Kupreyanov entered the Sea Cadet Corps while being only 10, in 1809. 

Kupreyanov served on the &quot;Mirny&quot; under captain Mikhail Lazarev during a circumnavigation led by Fabian Gottlieb von Bellingshausen that led to the discovery of Antarctica and a number of island chains in the Pacific and Southern Oceans. He participated in an additional circumnavigation by Lazarev that lasted through 1822 to 1824. Kupreyanov attained the rank of Captain lieutenant with command of a frigate and fought in the Black Sea against the Ottoman Navy during the Russo-Turkish War (1828–29).

Kupreyanov and his wife, Yuliya Ivanovna, began a school for native girls in Sitka. It was closed at the end of his administration but was reopened later. He built the famous residence, library and museum in New Archangel called Baranof&#x27;s Castle by early American settlers, who assumed that it had been built by Alexandr Baranov, Kupreyanov&#x27;s predecessor by eighteen years. The residence was the site of the ceremony in which control of Russian America was transferred from Russia to the United States in 1867. Although the residence fell down in 1897, the hill where it was located is still called Castle Hill. Kupreyanov greeted the British captain Edward Belcher in 1837, who was commanding surveying expedition of two ships, HMS &quot;Sulphur&quot; and HMS &quot;Starling&quot;. Belcher recorded that &quot;his civilities were overpowering.&quot; Departing from New Archangel on 30 September 1840 with his family, Kupreyanov continued his career in the Imperial Russian Navy. He was promoted to vice admiral in October 1852.

==Legacy==
Kupreanof Island in the Alexander Archipelago (the Alaska Panhandle) was named after him, and indirectly the city of Kupreanof, Alaska, which is on that island.

<text>Kupreanof Island () is an island in the Alexander Archipelago in southeastern Alaska. The island is long and wide with a total land area is , making it the 13th largest island in the United States and the 170th largest island in the world. The Lindenberg Peninsula on the southeast side of the island is considered part of the island. The peninsula is separated from the rest of the island by a narrow inlet called Duncan Canal. The island&#x27;s population was 785 at the 2000 census.

The island was first charted in 1793–1794 by James Johnstone and Joseph Whidbey, both part of British naval officer George Vancouver&#x27;s 1791–1795 expedition. The island is named after vice admiral Ivan Antonovich Kupreianov, governor of the Russian American colonies from 1836 to 1840; the name was published in 1848 on a Russian Hydrographic Department chart as &quot;Os(trov) Kupreyanova&quot;.

The largest settlement on the island is Kake, on the northwestern side of the island. The only other city is Kupreanof, on the eastern side, across the Wrangell Narrows from the city of Petersburg on nearby Mitkof Island. The island lies within the limits of Tongass National Forest (Petersburg Ranger District). The Petersburg Creek–Duncan Salt Chuck Wilderness is a part of the forest that is located on the island.

<doc id="927535" wikidata="Q7569077" url="?curid=927535" title="Southam, Gloucestershire">
<text>Southam is a village in Gloucestershire, England, located on the outskirts of Cheltenham. Its main features are a Manor House, which has now been converted to a hotel, a 12th Century Church and the Gloucestershire Warwickshire Railway, which runs through the outskirts of the village.

It is primarily a residential community for workers in Cheltenham, and has a growing retired and working population, attracted by the scenic countryside.

Though small in size, Southam has a thriving community. The village hall is used for coffee mornings, yoga sessions and the regularly occurring kids club among other things.

The parish of Southam had a population of 1,175 according to the 2011 census.

==History==

By c.991 the name Southam was already in use, possibly derived from its position south of the larger parish of Bishop&#x27;s Cleeve. In the Domesday Book it is written as Surham and was held by Durand, the Sheriff of Gloucester. From 1865 the village was also known as Southam-de-la-bere, this was to distinguish it from Southam in Warwickshire.

Before Southam was in the hands of the de la Bere family in the 17th century, the land was owned by Humphrey de Bohun, 7th Earl of Hereford. His youngest daughter, Mary de Bohun, was given the Manor as a dowry when she married Henry Bolingbroke in 1381, who later became Henry IV.

Henry IV annexed it to the Duchy of Lancaster and later on James I granted the Manor to Robert Cecil, the Earl of Salisbury, who then sold it to Richard de la Bere.

Richard de la Bere was the Lord of the Manor of Southam from 1609, and his Manor house was near the present Pigeon House in Southam Lane.

Richard de la Bere was a Barrister of Law at Lincoln&#x27;s Inn, and he died in 1636. His wife Margaret had the magnificent de la Bere tomb built in the south aisle of St. Michael&#x27;s Church in Bishop&#x27;s Cleeve in 1639, at a cost of £400.

They had no children, so his cousin, Kinnard de la Bere, inherited the title, and Southam House became the Manor House from 1636. In 1734 Kinnard&#x27;s great-grandson Kinard de la Bere died childless, leaving the manor to William Baghott of Prestbury, the second son of William Baghott and Anne de la Bere (m.1684), who took on the name and arms of de la Bere. His eldest son, Thomas Baghott de la Bere, then inherited the estate.

Thomas Goodman is thought to have begun building Southam House c.1500 and was completed by Sir John Huddleston, who was steward of Sudeley Castle.

Southam House was later used by The Oriel School for Girls and now it is the Ellenborough Park Hotel.

The Grade II* listed Tithe Barn and 12th-century Church of the Ascension are also points of interest. The church was abandoned to storing crops and making cider at some stage after 1646. In 1862 The Earl of Ellenborough restored the church in memory of his first wife, Lady Octavia Stewart, who had died of tuberculosis after five years of marriage. Ownership of the church transferred to the Diocese of Gloucester in 1957.

<text>Adam Beach (born November 11, 1972) is a Canadian actor. He is best known for his roles as Victor Joseph in &quot;Smoke Signals&quot;; Frank Fencepost in &quot;Dance Me Outside&quot;; Tommy on &quot;Walker, Texas Ranger&quot;; Kickin&#x27; Wing in &quot;Joe Dirt&quot;; U.S. Marine Corporal Ira Hayes in &quot;Flags of Our Fathers&quot;; Private Ben Yahzee in &quot;Windtalkers&quot;; Dr. Charles Eastman (Ohiyesa) in &quot;Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee&quot;; NYPD Detective Chester Lake in &quot;Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit&quot;; and Officer Jim Chee in the film adaptations of &quot;Skinwalkers&quot;, &quot;Coyote Waits&quot; and &quot;A Thief of Time&quot;. He starred in the Canadian 2012–2014 series &quot;Arctic Air&quot; and played Slipknot in the 2016 film &quot;Suicide Squad&quot;. He also performed as Squanto in Disney&#x27;s historical drama film &quot;&quot;. Most recently he has starred in &quot;Hostiles&quot; (2017) as Black Hawk and the Netflix original film &quot;Juanita&quot; (2019) as Jess Gardiner and Edward Nappo in Jane Campion&#x27;s &quot;The Power of the Dog&quot;.

==Early life==
Adam Beach was born in Ashern, Manitoba. He is Saulteaux Anishinaabe and has some Icelandic roots through his great-grandmother. Beach spent his early years with his parents and two brothers on the Lake Manitoba/Dog Creek First Nation Reserve at Lake Manitoba. When Beach was eight years old, his mother, Sally Beach, eight months pregnant with a baby girl, was killed by a drunk driver. Eight weeks after his mother&#x27;s death, the family discovered their father Dennis Beach had drowned near the community. It is unclear whether his death was an accident or suicide.

Adam and his two brothers initially lived with their grandmother; he was with her from age 8 to 12. Five years after their parents&#x27; deaths, the three brothers were taken to Winnipeg to live with an aunt and paternal uncle: Agnes and Chris Beach (his father&#x27;s brother). Adam refers to his Uncle Chris as &quot;Dad&quot;.

Beach attended a drama class at Gordon Bell High School. He began performing in local theatre productions and eventually dropped out of school to take a lead role at the Manitoba Theatre for Young People.

==Career==
Beach has a long list of diverse portrayals. He saw acting as a catharsis and turned to theater as a venue to express his feelings and tell his own personal stories. At age 18, Beach won a small role in the miniseries &quot;Lost in the Barrens&quot;, based on the Farley Mowat novel. In the following years, he continued to work in local theatre and guest-starred on television shows such as &quot;Walker, Texas Ranger&quot; and &quot;Touched by an Angel&quot;. Shortly afterwards, Beach was cast as a regular on the television shows &quot;North of 60&quot; and &quot;The Rez&quot;. After his performance in &quot;Dance Me Outside,&quot; he starred in &quot;Smoke Signals,&quot; which was nominated for the Grand Jury Prize at the Sundance Film Festival. He took a small role in Disney&#x27;s &quot;Mystery, Alaska&quot; in 1999 and in 2000 accepted a role in the thriller, &quot;The Last Stop.&quot; Beach appeared in Helen Lee&#x27;s &quot;The Art of Woo&quot; and the 2001 hit &quot;Joe Dirt&quot; as Kickin&#x27; Wing, a Native American fireworks salesman. The producers of &quot;Joe Dirt&quot; had originally wanted to hire Evan Adams for the parody of his character in &quot;Smoke Signals&quot;, but accidentally called Beach instead.

In 2002, &quot;Windtalkers&quot;, starring Beach, was released in theatres; it was about Navajo codetalkers working with the US Marines during World War II. To prepare for this role, Beach spent six months learning the Navajo language. He used this language in his next project, &quot;Skinwalkers&quot;, based on a novel by Tony Hillerman and directed by Chris Eyre, who had given him his breakout role in &quot;Smoke Signals.&quot; Between large-scale projects, Beach made small television appearances on such shows as &quot;JAG&quot; and &quot;Third Watch&quot;. Also, in 2003, he returned to the character that he first portrayed in &quot;Skinwalkers&quot; in the movie &quot;Coyote Waits&quot;, also based on a Hillerman novel. He also made a guest appearance in the hit show &quot;The Dead Zone&quot; as a Native shaman (in the episode &quot;Shaman&quot;).

In 2006, Beach portrayed Ira Hayes in Clint Eastwood&#x27;s feature film &quot;Flags of Our Fathers&quot;. During the filming of this movie, both Beach&#x27;s grandmother and his best friend died. Beach commented, &quot;And if you add those up, there&#x27;s a lot of emotion. When you&#x27;re doing a movie, when you let go emotionally, there&#x27;s nothing to grab onto,&quot; he said about the deaths. About playing the part, Beach said, &quot;For me, playing Ira was a meaningful relationship. I would call it – trying to find out how he was, or how he thought and felt&quot;. The movie won two Academy Award nominations and Beach was nominated for multiple Best Supporting Actor honors.

In 2006, Beach ran as a candidate to lead his Lake Manitoba First Nation; he was not successful but said he will try again. In 2007, Beach starred in HBO Films&#x27; adaptation of Dee Brown&#x27;s history, &quot;Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee.&quot; In the film, Beach portrays Charles Eastman (Dakota name Ohiyesa), a doctor, Sioux advocate and author. He explores and expresses the changing understanding of Aboriginal-US relations during the period leading up to the Wounded Knee Massacre.
In addition to starring in the Canadian television series &quot;Moose TV&quot;, Beach is executive-producing and starring in the movie &quot;Older Than America.&quot; The independent feature is filmed in Cloquet, Minnesota, mostly on the Fond du Lac Ojibwe reservation. He joined the cast of &quot;Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit&quot; as Detective Chester Lake for the show&#x27;s ninth season after guest-starring in season eight. In April 2008, &quot;TV Guide&quot; announced that he would not return for the show&#x27;s tenth season. He later stated he grew disillusioned with the strictly procedural nature of the show and opted to leave after the finish of the ninth season.

Starting in 2009, Beach played a supporting role on the HBO series &quot;Big Love&quot; as a manager in an Indian casino with Bill Henrickson (Bill Paxton). On February 10, 2010, it was announced that Beach will portray Tommy Prince, the Canadian war hero, in an upcoming movie about his life. According to Bay Film Studios, the movie will be a &quot;true account of Canada&#x27;s most highly decorated First Nations soldier.&quot; Beach said he is honoured to portray Prince, calling him a positive role model for all First Nations. In 2011, he starred in &quot;Cowboys &amp; Aliens&quot;, an American science fiction Western film directed by Jon Favreau and starring Daniel Craig, Harrison Ford and Olivia Wilde. The film is based on the 2006 graphic novel of the same name created by Scott Mitchell Rosenberg. Also in 2011, Beach returned to Canada to star in the TV series &quot;Arctic Air&quot;, which premiered on January 12, 2012. In 2015, Beach appeared on several episodes of &quot;Backstrom&quot; as Sheriff Jesse Rocha. In 2017, he played Black Hawk in &quot;Hostiles&quot;, starring Christian Bale, Rosamund Pike and Wes Studi.

In 2022 Beach was selected as host of the Canadian chainsaw carving competition show &quot;A Cut Above&quot;.

==Personal life==

Adam Beach has been married three times and has three children. He has two sons with his first wife, Meredith Porter (married 1999–2002). He did not have children with his second wife, Tara Mason (married 2003⁠–⁠2007). In 2008, his current wife, Summer Tiger, gave birth to a daughter.

<text>Zhang Ning (; born 19 May 1975) is a former Chinese badminton player. She won the Olympic gold medal twice for women&#x27;s singles in both 2004 and 2008. She has played badminton on the world scene since the mid-1990s and has been particularly successful since 2002 while in her late twenties and early thirties, relatively late for singles at the highest level, and especially for top players in the Chinese system who are developed very early. She is known for her consistency of shot, deception and constant pressure, dictating the pace of rallies and working her opponents in all four corners of the court. She is the only female player to win consecutive Olympic singles gold medals. She also became World champion in 2003 and has a total of five medals of all colours in the competition.

Zhang first represented China in the Uber Cup (women&#x27;s world team championship) competition in 1994 and last represented it in 2006. Though she was not always chosen to play in each of the biennial editions of this tournament, the span of her Uber Cup service is the longest of any Chinese player.

==Career==

===2003===
Although she had previously won a number of international open titles dating from the mid-1990s, Zhang&#x27;s breakthrough as a dominant player on the world circuit came in the 2003 IBF World Championships, where she stormed into the final. There, 28-year-old Zhang Ning defeated compatriot Gong Ruina easily 11-6, 11-3.

===2004===
The following year, Zhang played badminton at the 2004 Summer Olympics for China. In women&#x27;s singles, she defeated Marina Andrievskaya of Sweden and Kelly Morgan of Great Britain in the first two rounds. In the quarterfinals, Zhang beat Wang Chen of Hong Kong 9-11, 11-6, 11-7 to advance to the semifinals. There, she defeated countrywoman Zhou Mi 11-6, 11-4. Zhang defeated Netherlands&#x27;s Mia Audina 8-11, 11-6, 11-7 in the final to win the gold medal. It was sweet revenge for the 29-year-old, who had lost to Audina 10 years earlier in the decisive match of the Uber Cup. With her Olympic win, she became one of three singles players in the world to win the World Championship and the Olympic Games (in either order) in successive years, the others being Susi Susanti and Taufik Hidayat.

===2005===
Zhang also claimed many titles after her breakthrough wins. She bested Xie Xingfang in the 2005 China Open 3-11, 11-4, 11-8, but in the 2005 World Championships final Zhang fell to Xie Xingfang, 8-11, 11-9, 3-11.

===2006===
In 2006, Zhang reached the finals of the World Championships yet again, but she was still unable to defeat Xingfang. This time, she lost 16-21, 14-21. However, Zhang claimed revenge in the Japan Open, defeating Xingfang 21-11, 16-21, 30-29. This was the 19th time they had met in an international tournament, with the head-to-head tied at 9-9.

During this year the well known Dutch documentary filmmaker Roel van Dalen made the documentary film &quot;Olympic Journey - The Road to Beijing&quot; on the life of Zhang Ning, which was broadcast on television worldwide.

===2007===
In 2007, Zhang won her fifth Singapore Open title in six times, beating Xingfang 21-18, 19-21, 21-3. In the World Championships, Xingfang was defeated in the third round by Malaysian Wong Mew Choo, making Zhang a favourite for the title. However, she was stopped in the semi-finals by Wang Chen. This was the second time Wang Chen had beaten her in 2007, after the Indonesian Open. Zhang&#x27;s compatriot Zhu Lin went on to beat Wang in the final 21-8, 21-12. In the Beijing Good Luck Invitational tournament, Zhang reached the semi-finals to face Zhu Lin but pulled out due to injury.

In the Danish Open, she reached the final, but lost 17-21, 14-21 to compatriot Lu Lan due to a thigh injury. Zhang also reached the semi-finals of the French Open, but was upset by local hope Pi Hongyan.

In the China Open, Zhang lost in straight sets to Malaysia&#x27;s Wong Mew Choo in the semi-finals. Zhang cited injury and fatigue as the main reasons for her loss.

===2008===
Zhang&#x27;s 2008 season started with a first round loss in the Malaysian Open. She was seen coaching her younger teammates in the tournament as well. In the Korean Open, she lost to her former compatriot, Zhou Mi, in the quarter-final. Zhou now plays for Hong Kong. In the All England, Zhang and Xie, the top 2 seeds, lost in the first round. However they both bounced back strongly in the Swiss Open to reach the final, for their 22nd international meeting. To be in the final was a relief for Zhang, who had failed to get past the quarter-finals in three previous tournaments. Still, Xie beat Zhang 21-18, 21-17, bringing their head-to-head stands to 11:11.

Later, at the Beijing Olympic Games, Zhang progressed to the quarter-final after overcoming South Korean Jun Jae Youn in the third round. She then subdued fifth-seeded Pi Hongyan of France and Indonesia&#x27;s Maria Kristin Yulianti 21-15, 21-15 to reach the final. There she faced compatriot and world number 1 Xie Xingfang and won in a tough three-setter, 21-12, 10-21, 21-18, to extend her gold medal reign. Zhang became the first badminton player to ever defend an Olympic singles title even though many questioned her ability to do so at the age of 33. She was additionally chosen to represent China as the flag bearer for the 2008 Summer Olympics closing ceremony.

==Retirement==
Having previously announced her plans to retire after the 2008 Olympic Games, a retirement ceremony for Zhang and other retiring members of the Chinese national team was held at the 2008 China Open Badminton Championships in Shanghai in November 2008. She was in tears receiving an award during the ceremony to mark her retirement with five other teammates from the Chinese national badminton team on the sidelines of the China Open badminton event in Shanghai, November 23, 2008. After her retirement, Zhang Ning immediately began working with the Chinese national team in coaching and developing the up-and-coming women&#x27;s singles players. In 2018 however she was replaced by Luo Yigang as the coach of China&#x27;s women&#x27;s badminton team following the below par performance of team at the Uber Cup.

<text>Hamo de Crevequer (died 1263) was an Anglo-Norman nobleman who held the office of Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports.

Gerinun de Holeburn was in 1263 one of a jury of twelve assembled lawfully to conclude upon an ‘inquisition into how much land ‘Hamo de Creuker’, (Crevequer) Baron of Chatham, deceased, held of our Lord the King, at Ledes’ in Kent.

Hamo de Crevequer took possession of his lands at Brenchley in 1217; he was succeeded by his grandson Robert. In 1264/5, Robert&#x27;s lands were seized by Gilbert de Clare, 3rd Earl of Gloucester. It is recorded that from 29 April 1230 a market was held each Sunday by Hamo de Crevequer, until it was ordained by Henry III on 30 June 1233, that the market formally held in the churchyard should in future be held on de Crevequer&#x27;s own land, but on a Saturday.

Hamo de Crevequer acquired property in Folkestone, Kent, England, from the barony of the family of Abrincis. Hamo quitclaimed the advowson of the church of Alkham and chapel of Manrege to St Radegunds (Radigunds) Abbey, in Kent in 1258, in which charter he refers to his wife, Maud de Abrincis [d&#x27;Avranches].

His daughter, Isolde, who was born after 1251, was married to John de Sandwich. She subsequently married Nicholas Merryweather was born between 1251–1286 in Lenham, Kent, England, some time during the reign of King Edward I of England (1272–1307). On 12 June 1285 Edward I inspected a charter of Robert de Crevequer, granting the Castle of Ledes the fair of Chatham. By 1380 the fair had become the king&#x27;s own right, for his wife.

By 1296 the market at Brenchley was being held by Gilbert de Clare, earl of Gloucester and Hertford, and in 1312 de Clare claimed that his ancestors had held the market &#x27;from time out of mind&#x27;. De Clare followed Hamo de Crevequer, some years later as Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports.

<text>Zhou Mi (; born 18 February 1979) is a Chinese badminton player. During much of her career she represented the People&#x27;s Republic of China, but since 2007 she has represented Hong Kong which has a sports program and teams independent from those of the mainland. In 2010, she received a 2-year ban, for failing a drugs test.

== Career ==
Since 1998 Zhou has won more than twenty international singles titles on the world circuit and has achieved number one world rankings at various times. She was a silver medalist behind compatriot Gong Ruina at the 2001 IBF World Championships and was a bronze medalist at the 2003 Championships. She won women&#x27;s singles at the quadrennial Asian Games in 2002, defeating Gong Ruina in the final. Zhou is a three-time finalist at the prestigious All-England Championships where she captured the title in 2003. She played singles for world champion Chinese Uber Cup (women&#x27;s international) teams in 2002 and 2004.

=== Olympic controversy ===
At the 2004 Athens Olympics Zhou reached the semifinal round where she was eliminated from gold medal contention by fellow countrywoman Zhang Ning. She then defeated Gong Ruina in the playoff for the bronze medal. The circumstances behind Zhou&#x27;s semifinal defeat are controversial, however, because China&#x27;s national coach Li Yongbo later confirmed rumors that he had instructed Zhou not to fight hard after she had dropped the first game to Zhang. His rationale was that a fresh Zhang Ning would have a better chance to defeat a non-Chinese opponent, the Netherlands&#x27; Mia Audina, in the final.

=== &quot;Retirement&quot; and comeback ===
Whether the Olympic episode or subsequent injury and poor performance was the primary cause, Zhou apparently retired from badminton during the 2005 season. She played no tournaments in 2006 but secured residence in Hong Kong through its Quality Migration program. Zhou then reemerged on the world badminton circuit during the 2007 season. From a weak start at the Singapore Open her results dramatically improved to the point where she had regained a number one world ranking as of the end of the year 2008. Since launching her comeback Zhou&#x27;s titles have included the New Zealand and Philippines Opens in 2007, and the South Korea, India, Macau Opens, and China Masters in 2008. In December, Zhou ended the 2008 season by winning the BWF Super Series Masters Finals, the biggest prize money event in the sport.

=== Positive clenbuterol test and two years ban ===
The BWF announced on 4 September 2010 that a BWF Doping Hearing conducted in Copenhagen on Monday 23 August has banned Zhou Mi for 2 years from participation in badminton, following an Adverse Analytical Finding. A sample taken from her in late June as part of the BWF&#x27;s &#x27;out-of-competition&#x27; testing programme. Zhou tested positive to clenbuterol, a Class 1 Anabolic Agent on the WADA Prohibited List of substances.

On 27 October 2011, more than one year after she was handed a two-year ban for testing positive for clenbuterol, former badminton world No. 1 Zhou Mi reiterated her innocence. &quot;At the time of the test, I was not competing or preparing to compete. There was not even the slightest reason or incentive for me to take any performance-enhancing substance,&quot; said Zhou. Regardless of the incident, Zhou, now 32, added it was time for her to retire from the sport. Clenbuterol can be consumed from eating contaminated food.

<text>Mitkof Island is an island in the Alexander Archipelago in southeast Alaska between Kupreanof Island to the west and the Alaskan mainland to the east. It is approximately wide and long with a land area of , making it the 30th largest island in the United States. Much of the island is managed as part of the Tongass National Forest.

The island is relatively flat with numerous muskegs. The highest point is Crystal Mountain .

The city of Petersburg is on the north end of the island. The total population of the island was 3,364 at the 2000 census, almost all of it in the city of Petersburg.

The island is surrounded by Frederick Sound to the north, Dry Strait to the east, Sumner Strait to the south, and Wrangell Narrows to the west. Bordered by Mitkof Island on one side, and Kuprenof and Woewodski Islands on the other, the Wrangell Narrows creates the only navigable &#x27;Inside Passage&#x27; at this latitude and is one of the six Listed Narrows of Southeast Alaska. Because of their shallow depths, the largest cruise ships do not pass through Wrangell Narrows or through Dry Strait. Spirit Creek is the southernmost stream on the island in the Wrangell Narrows, just two miles from where the narrows opens onto Sumner Strait.

The first European to sight the island was James Johnstone, one of George Vancouver&#x27;s officers during his 1791-95 expedition, in 1793. The island is shown as separate from Kupreanof Island in an 1844 Russian chart, while the name was published in 1848 on a Russian Hydrographic Department chart as &quot;Os(trov) Mitkova&quot; for an Admiral Prokofy Mitkov.

<doc id="927572" wikidata="Q890780" url="?curid=927572" title="Guernsey cattle">
<text>The Guernsey is a breed of dairy cattle from the island of Guernsey in the Channel Islands. It is fawn or red and white in colour, and is hardy and docile. Its milk is rich in flavour, high in fat and protein, and has a golden-yellow tinge due to its high β-carotene content. The Guernsey is one of three Channel Island cattle breeds; the other two are the Alderney, which is now extinct, and the Jersey.

== History ==

The Guernsey was bred on the Channel Island of Guernsey; it is first documented in the nineteenth century, and its origins are unknown. Cattle were brought to the island in the Middle Ages for draught work. It has been suggested that the Guernsey derives from cattle imported from the French mainland – brindled cattle from Normandy, and wheaten stock similar to the Froment du Léon of Brittany. There may also have been some influence from Dutch cattle in the 18th century. During that century large numbers of cattle were exported from the Channel Islands to England; some of them had previously been brought from France. Imports of French cattle to Guernsey were forbidden by law in 1819, but some importation of British cattle continued until 1877. Some cattle evacuated from Alderney during the Second World War were merged into the breed.

Exports of cattle and semen were for a while an important economic resource for the island, and in the early 20th century, a large number of Guernsey cattle were exported to the United States. The Guernsey breed is on the watch list maintained by the American Livestock Breeds Conservancy, with fewer than 2,500 annual registrations in the U.S. and an estimated global population less than 10,000 animals.

== Characteristics ==
The Guernsey is of medium size: cows weigh , and bulls . The coat is red or fawn (wheat-coloured), and may or may not be pied red-and-white or fawn-and-white. The Guernsey produces rich and flavoursome milk. It traditionally had several other good qualities: it was long-lived, calved without difficulty, grazed well and – being relatively small-sized – was an efficient milk producer. These advantages have been compromised by recent selective breeding strategies, which have led to larger animals, with longer legs. These no longer display the traditional qualities of the breed; this is particularly marked where there has been cross-breeding with Holstein-Friesian stock.

== Use ==
The Guernsey is a dairy breed, and generally is reared for that purpose only. However, the cow is usually removed from the dairy herd around ages six to eight, and marketed for beef, and other processed meats. The milk has a golden-yellow tinge due to a high content of β-carotene, a provitamin for vitamin A. The milk also has a high butterfat content of 5% and a high protein content of 3.7%. Guernsey cows produce around 6000 litres per cow per year.

<text>Gong Ruina (; born on 23 January 1981) is a badminton player from the People&#x27;s Republic of China.

==Career==
Gong Ruina was one of the world&#x27;s leading women&#x27;s singles players, former World No. 1 in the first few years of the 21st century. She won a number of top tier international titles including the 2001 IBF World Championships in Seville, Spain and the venerable All-England Championships (2004). In both of these events she defeated fellow countrywoman Zhou Mi, one of her principal rivals, in the finals. On the other hand, Gong was beaten by Zhou in the final of the Asian Games (2002), and was denied a bronze medal by her at the 2004 Athens Olympics after each had been beaten in the semifinals.

Gong played singles for China&#x27;s world champion Uber Cup (women&#x27;s international) teams of 2002 and 2004. Her other individual titles included the Brunei (1998), Swedish (1999), Malaysia (2001), China (2002), Indonesia (2002), Denmark (2003), and Swiss (2004) Opens. She was a bronze medalist at the 1999 IBF World Championships in Copenhagen, and a silver medalist behind fellow countrywoman Zhang Ning at the 2003 IBF World Championships in Birmingham, England.

Gong retired in the prime of her career to explore other opportunities in her life in June 2005. She once lived in Hong Kong with her husband, a Chinese entrepreneur who has a company in Hong Kong, and with her two children. She now works as the head coach of the Hunan province amateur badminton team.

<text>Benjamin Lev Kweller (born June 16, 1981) is an American singer, songwriter, and multi-instrumentalist.

A former member of Radish, Kweller has released six solo albums and appeared on several collaborations.

==Early life==
Ben Kweller was born in San Francisco in 1981. In 1982, his family relocated to Emory, Texas, where his father, Howard Kweller, became the town&#x27;s first doctor. In 1986, the Kwellers moved to the larger Texas town of Greenville.

Kweller was exposed to music at a very early age. Howard taught Ben how to play the drums when he was seven years old. For the next year, they would play together almost every night after Howard got home from work. Howard sang and played guitar, while Ben played the drums. The duo played songs by The Beatles, The Hollies, Jimi Hendrix, and other artists of the 1960s. Howard is also a longtime friend of Nils Lofgren, a neighbor of his. Kweller has mentioned in interviews that meeting Lofgren greatly helped his exposure to music. When Kweller turned eight, someone showed him how to play &quot;Heart and Soul&quot; on the piano, and the youngster immediately began to create his own songs using the same chords. By the time he was nine, he had a dozen original compositions under his belt and had entered a songwriting contest sponsored by &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine, where he won an honorable mention.

==Radish (1993–1999)==
In 1993, Kweller became friends with a local musician, drummer John Kent, and formed the band Radish with bassist Ryan Green. The trio played locally in and around Greenville and recorded two independent releases, &quot;Hello&quot; (1994) and &quot;Dizzy&quot; (1995), with Martin Baird at Verge Music Works recording studio in Dallas, Texas. Around the time of the release of &quot;Dizzy&quot;, Green left Radish to focus his attention on school. Lauren Hamilton stood in for Green for a few months until Bryan Bradford, also known as Bryan Blur, joined on for most of the band&#x27;s career.

Kweller sent a copy of &quot;Dizzy&quot; to guitarist Nils Lofgren, who grew up with Kweller&#x27;s father in Maryland. Lofgren was impressed with Radish and recommended them to Roger Greenawalt, who was producing Lofgren&#x27;s album &quot;Damaged Goods&quot; at the time. Greenawalt took Radish to a studio to record a demo tape, which was subsequently sent to record labels nationwide. After an unexpected bidding war for &quot;Dizzy&quot;, Radish signed to Mercury Records to release the full-length &quot;Restraining Bolt&quot;.

Radish made appearances on &quot;The Weird Al Show&quot;, &quot;Late Night with Conan O&#x27;Brien&quot; and &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot;, but despite a much-hyped signing, the band failed to strike success. Radish earned a cult following in the United Kingdom with its top-40 hit &quot;Little Pink Stars.&quot; The band went on multiple European tours, including opening slots for Faith No More and Main Stage at Reading Festival in 1997. Radish released two singles.

In 1998, Radish became a quartet; it featured Joe Butcher of the Polyphonic Spree and UFOFU on lead guitar and Debbie Williams on bass. Radish went to Muscle Shoals Studio in Alabama to record the follow-up to &quot;Restraining Bolt&quot;, provisionally titled &quot;Discount Fireworks&quot;. The band recorded with producer Bryce Goggin (Pavement, The Lemonheads). While mastering &quot;Discount Fireworks&quot; in New York City, Kweller and Kent met bassist Josh Lattanzi, who would become Radish&#x27;s fifth and final bass player. As a result of PolyGram&#x27;s merger with Universal Music Group, the 18-song album was never released, and Radish secured a release from their contract with Mercury Records.

==Solo career==
At age 19, Kweller moved with his girlfriend, Liz Smith, to New York, where he began his solo career. He played solo acoustic shows and self-released four EPs, comprising some of the unreleased Radish &quot;Discount Fireworx&quot; recordings and other songs recorded in his apartment on a laptop computer. It was one of these EPs, &quot;Freak Out, It&#x27;s Ben Kweller&quot;, that caught the attention of Evan Dando of The Lemonheads. Dando invited Kweller on tour with him. Jeff Tweedy, Juliana Hatfield and Guster also noticed Kweller and took him on tour with them.

===&quot;EP Phone Home&quot; and &quot;Sha Sha&quot; (2002)===

In 2001, Ben Kweller became ATO Records&#x27; first worldwide signing and released a 5-track EP entitled &quot;EP Phone Home&quot;. In March 2002, &quot;Sha Sha&quot;, Kweller&#x27;s first solo studio LP, was released. &quot;Sha Sha&quot; included the radio-friendly and popular single &quot;Wasted &amp; Ready&quot;, which reached #29 on the Modern Rock Tracks chart. The album featured John Kent on drums and Josh Lattanzi on bass, and showcased a wide variety of sound from quirky pop, to folk, to punk. The album grew in popularity with a grassroots effort based on his website and a promotion group called teamBK, which promoted via word-of-mouth advertising. To support the release of the album and EP, he put together a live band, initially composed of Lattanzi on bass, Fred Eltringham on drums, and Mike Stroud on guitar and keyboards. Towards the end of the &quot;Sha Sha&quot; album cycle, the four-piece performed on PBS&#x27;s &quot;Austin City Limits&quot;.

===The Bens (2003)===
In 2003, Kweller toured Australia with Ben Folds and Ben Lee as The Bens. The trio produced an eponymous four-song EP, with each member taking lead vocals on one song, and a final song in which they all contributed vocals. In an interview on October 14, 2006, Ben hinted that The Bens may do another album.

===Guster collaboration (2003)===
Late in 2003, Kweller provided lead vocals on the song &quot;I Hope Tomorrow is Like Today&quot; from Guster&#x27;s album &quot;Keep It Together&quot;. Kweller and Guster co-wrote the song after a late night jam at Guster&#x27;s Brooklyn studio. The song is prominently featured in the movie &quot;Wedding Crashers&quot;.

===&quot;On My Way&quot; (2004)===
Kweller&#x27;s second LP, &quot;On My Way&quot;, took a new musical direction. The album, produced by Ethan Johns, was recorded mostly live, with limited overdubs and no use of headphones. After the release of &quot;On My Way&quot;, Kweller embarked on more touring. On these tours, Kweller played for his largest audiences ever, including a US tour co-headlining with Death Cab for Cutie. By this point, the lineup of his live band had changed to include John Kent on drums and Jason Roberts on guitar and keyboards, after Mike Stroud left to concentrate on his own band Ratatat and Fred Eltringham left to play drums in The Wallflowers.

===&quot;Ben Kweller&quot; (2006)===
In 2006, he recorded his third LP, &quot;Ben Kweller&quot; with producer Gil Norton. Unlike the previous studio albums, Kweller played all the instruments on this record himself. Kweller continued to tour to support his self-titled album, and expanded his band into a five piece, which grew to include Dan Horne on bass, Mark Stepro on drums, Jay Barclay on guitar and organ and Jason Roberts on lead guitar. Kweller continued to play guitar and piano on this tour, but it also gave him the opportunity to just sing on certain songs. The Montreal group Sam Roberts Band, and New York based Hymns, opened for Kweller.

His tie-in &#x27;Trio on the Train Track Tour&#x27; included a new live band comprising Chris Morrissey on bass, vocals &amp; keyboard and Mark Stepro on drums, vocals, glockenspiel, percussion &amp; &quot;whatever else he feels like&quot; during appearances in the United States. During the Australian leg of the tour, the band was composed of Jay Barclay on guitar, keyboard &amp; vocals, Dan Horne on bass &amp; vocals, and Mark Stepro continuing his previous roles.

===&quot;Changing Horses&quot; (2009)===
&quot;Changing Horses&quot; is Ben Kweller&#x27;s fourth official studio album, which was expected for release in September 2008 but was pushed to February 2, 2009, in Europe and February 3, 2009, in the United States through ATO Records. Kweller has described the new album as being more country in style than his previous releases. The album features his rhythm section Chris Morrissey (bass) and Mark Stepro (drums). It also debuts the talents of Ben Kitterman, who played pedal steel guitar and Dobro. On November 23, 2008, the full album was leaked to the Internet. In a statement, ATO Records said the leak was not the final version of the album. The song &quot;Hurtin&#x27; You&quot; debuted on Stereogum, and the whole album was made available to stream exclusively on Last.fm.

In April 2009, Ben Kweller appeared at Australian festivals such as Chill City, East Coast Blues &amp; Roots Music Festival and West Coast Blues &amp; Roots Festival.

===&quot;Go Fly a Kite&quot; (2012)===
Kweller&#x27;s fifth studio album, &quot;Go Fly a Kite&quot;, was his first release produced solely by his own record label, The Noise Company. In earlier interviews, Kweller had stated that it would be released as early as March or April 2011. However, a conversation with the manager of The Noise Company revealed that it was now set to come out either late January or early February 2012. The delay in release is a result of Kweller&#x27;s parting ways with his former record label, ATO Records. This was confirmed by Kweller himself, onstage at Stubbs in Austin, Texas, on April 16, 2011. More recently, Kweller posted on his Twitter account that &quot;Kite&#x27;s&quot; released date will be February 12, 2012. This was followed by a tweet saying that it will be available for pre-order in October. Kweller&#x27;s album was released a few days earlier than expected on iTunes on February 7, 2012.

===&quot;Circuit Boredom &quot; (2021)===
Ben Kweller&#x27;s sixth studio album likely started its production in 2018 and culminated with the album&#x27;s global release on December 17, 2021.

On June 23, 2018, Kweller announced via his Instagram page that he would be releasing a new album soon.

On January 22, 2019, Kweller announced his return to music after he and his family had a near-death experience after carbon monoxide poisoning during a vacation in New Mexico. The new album, &quot;Circuit Boredom&quot;, co-produced by Dwight A Baker, was released over the course of a year via multiple singles. Its first single, &quot;Heart Attack Kid&quot;, was released on February 8, 2019.

Kweller&#x27;s music video for &quot;Heart Attack Kid&quot;, was made in collaboration with Robert Strange of Superorganism and released on February 19, 2019.

Other singles include &quot;Just For Kids&quot;, &quot;Only A Day&quot;, and &quot;Starz&quot;. The official street date for &quot;Circuit Boredom &quot; was Friday, December 17, 2021, when it was released to all DSP&#x27;s worldwide. The Noise Company (record label) has said the album is a priority of theirs in 2022, starting with a radio campaign for the single &quot;American Cigarettes&quot; in early 2022. Limited edition vinyl was made available on Kweller&#x27;s website.

==Austin City Limits performances==

Kweller played the 2003 Austin City Limits Music Festival at the conclusion of his tour, where he played &quot;Sha Sha&quot; in its entirety.

He returned to the Austin City Limits in 2004 when he performed on the Bank of America stage.

As part of his 2006 tour, Kweller played the Austin City Limits, where he was plagued by a severe nosebleed for the entirety of his set. After covering his guitar in blood, he attempted to stop the flow by inserting a travel-size tampon thrown onto the stage by a fan, which expanded painfully during a performance of &quot;This Is War&quot;. After attempting to play &quot;Falling&quot; at a piano which he also covered in blood, Kweller was forced to end the set early.

In spring of 2007, Kweller co-headlined with his label-mates Gomez. He continued through the summer with his own string of headlining dates which eventually ended at ACL fest. This time, he did not get a bloody nose; however, commemorative T-shirts were sold at the merchandise booth with fake blood stains that said &quot;ACL 2007: The return of Ben Kweller&quot;.

Immediately following his performance at ACL, Kweller began recording his fourth full-length LP, a country record titled &quot;Changing Horses&quot; in Austin, Texas on September 21, 2007.

==Film debut==
Kweller made his acting debut in William H. Macy&#x27;s &quot;Rudderless&quot;; filming began in April 2013.

==Personal life==
Ben married his longtime love Liz in 2003 (she inspired the song &quot;Lizzy&quot; from 2002&#x27;s &quot;Sha Sha&quot; album). They had two sons, Dorian and Judah.

However, on February 28, 2023, it was announced that Kweller&#x27;s 16-year-old son Dorian had died in a car crash.

<text>Minisupercomputers constituted a short-lived class of computers that emerged in the mid-1980s, characterized by the combination of vector processing and small-scale multiprocessing. As scientific computing using vector processors became more popular, the need for lower-cost systems that might be used at the departmental level instead of the corporate level created an opportunity for new computer vendors to enter the market. As a generalization, the price targets for these smaller computers were one-tenth of the larger supercomputers.

Several notable technical, economic, and political attributes characterize minisupercomputers. First, they were architecturally more diverse than prior mainframes and minicomputers in hardware and less diverse in software. Second, advances in VLSI made them less expensive (mini-price). These machines were market targeted to be cost-effective and quickly manufactured. Third, it is notable who did not manufacture minisupercomputers: within the USA, IBM and the traditional mainframe makers, outside the USA: the Japanese supercomputer vendors and Russia (despite attempts to manufacture minicomputers).

The appearance of even lower-priced scientific workstations (e.g., Dana Computer/Ardent Computer/Stellar Computer (the merger of these companies)) based on microprocessors with high performance floating point units (FPUs) during the 1990s (such as the MIPS R8000, IBM POWER2), and Weitek eroded the demand for this class of computer.

The industry magazine &quot;Datamation&quot; coined the term &quot;Crayette&quot; which in short order meant instruction set compatible to Cray Research, Inc.

<text>Mia Audina Tjiptawan (born 22 August 1979) is a former Indonesian badminton player who represented Indonesia and later the Netherlands in international competitions. A badminton prodigy, Audina first played Uber Cup (the women&#x27;s world team championship) for Indonesia at age fourteen, winning the decisive final match in the championship round against China in 1994. She was briefly ranked as the World No.1 women&#x27;s singles player in October 1996. Audina helped Indonesia to retain the Uber Cup title in 1996, and was a member of the 1998 Indonesian team which relinquished the Cup to China, before moving to the Netherlands with her Dutch-national husband in 2000.

== Career ==
As a Dutch resident she continued to compete, winning titles in both Europe and Asia before retiring from high-level competition in 2006. Top honors in badminton&#x27;s three most prestigious events for individual players, the Olympics, the All-Englands, and the World Championships, eluded Audina, though she was twice an Olympic silver medalist in singles (1996, 2004) and was a bronze medalist at the World Championships in 2003. Her most significant victories included the open singles titles of the USA (1996), Singapore (1997), Japan (1997, 2004), Indonesia (1998), Korea (2003), the Netherlands (2001, 2002), Switzerland (2002), and Taiwan (2000, 2003). She won singles at the SEA Games in 1997 and both singles and women&#x27;s doubles at the European Championships in 2004. A gritty competitor and, in her youth, exceptionally mobile and supple (she was rarely forced into hitting backhands), Audina was a crowd favorite throughout her career.

<text>San Polo () is the smallest and most central of the six sestieri of Venice, northern Italy, covering 86 acres (35 hectares) along the Grand Canal. It is one of the oldest parts of the city, having been settled before the ninth century, when it and San Marco formed part of the Realtine Islands. The sestiere is named for the Church of San Polo.

The district has been the site of Venice&#x27;s main market since 1097, and connected to the eastern bank of the Grande Canal by the Rialto bridge since the thirteenth century. The western part of the quarter is now known for its churches, while the eastern part, sometimes just called the &quot;Rialto&quot;, is known for its palaces and smaller houses.

Attractions in San Polo include the Rialto Bridge, the Church of San Giacomo di Rialto (according to legend the oldest in the city), the Campo San Polo with the Church of San Polo, the House of Goldoni, the Church of Santa Maria Gloriosa dei Frari, the Church of San Rocco and the Scuola Grande di San Rocco.

<text>The Wrangell Narrows is a winding, channel between Mitkof Island and Kupreanof Island in the Alexander Archipelago in Southeast Alaska. The Wrangell Narrows is one of the six Listed narrows in Southeast Alaska. There are about 60 lights and buoys to mark it because of its winding nature and navigation hazards. It was named &quot;Proliv Vrangelya&quot; (English: &quot;Wrangell Strait&quot;) in 1838 by G. Lindenberg after Admiral Baron Ferdinand Petrovich von Wrangell. The translation &quot;Wrangell Strait&quot; remained in use while Wrangell Narrows referred to the narrowest central portion. By 1919 Department of Commerce nautical chart 8170 was changed from &quot;Wrangell Strait&quot; to Wrangell Narrows.

Dakxhatgwak Séet is the original Tlingit name of Wrangell Narrows. Later it was called Gantee Yaak’w Séet (Steamboat Channel) referring to it having become a passage for steamers.

The town of Petersburg is at the north end of the Narrows. The Narrows are created by Mitkof Island to the east and southeast, and the islands of Kuprenof and Woewodski to the north and west. The Narrows opens up to Frederick Sound to the north and Sumner Strait to the south.

The channel is used by fishing boats and Alaska Marine Highway ferries. Very large ships (such as the largest cruise ships) do not use it because it is too shallow and narrow for them to pass safely. Because this is the only safe &quot;Inside Passage&quot; at this latitude, these larger ships must navigate in &quot;outside&quot; waters. Dry Strait to the east of Mitkof Island is not commonly used by marine traffic despite being a wider channel since it is dangerously shallow and part of the greater Stikine River estuary.

<doc id="927621" wikidata="Q6142258" url="?curid=927621" title="James Robertson (explorer)">
<text>James Robertson (June 28, 1742 – September 1, 1814) was an American explorer, soldier and Indian agent, and one of the founding fathers of what became the State of Tennessee. An early companion of explorer Daniel Boone, Robertson helped establish the Watauga Association in the early 1770s, and to defend Fort Watauga from an attack by Cherokee in 1776. In 1779, he co-founded what is now Nashville, and was instrumental in the settlement of Middle Tennessee. He served as a brigadier general in the Southwest Territory militia in the early 1790s, and as an Indian Commissioner in later life.

==Early life and education==

Robertson was born in 1742 in Brunswick County, Virginia, of Scots-Irish and English descent, to John Randolph Robertson and Mary (Gower) Blakely. Around 1749, his father relocated the family to Wake County, North Carolina. Robertson worked with his siblings on their family farm and had limited formal education, but he learned to track and hunt animals and know his way in the woods and waterways.

==Marriage and career==

Robertson returned to North Carolina and married Charlotte Reeves in 1767. They started farming. In 1769, Robertson accompanied explorer Daniel Boone on his third expedition to lands beyond the Allegheny Mountains. The party discovered the &quot;Old Fields&quot; (lands previously cultivated by generations of Native Americans) along the Watauga River valley, where Elizabethton, Tennessee later developed. Robertson stopped here to plant corn while Boone continued on to Kentucky.

After returning to North Carolina, Robertson became involved with the Regulator movement. They recruited a group of settlers to return to the Watauga River valley, which they believed to be in Virginia (at that time including present-day West Virginia). In 1772, Robertson and the pioneers who had settled in Northeast Tennessee (along the Watauga, Doe, Holston and Nolichucky rivers) met at Sycamore Shoals to establish an independent regional government known as the Watauga Association.

However, in 1772, surveyors placed the land officially within the domain of the Cherokee tribe, who had long occupied this area. They required the settlers to negotiate a lease to cultivate and settle on their land. As the signed lease was being celebrated, a Cherokee warrior was murdered by a white man. Robertson&#x27;s skillful diplomacy made peace with the irate Cherokee, who threatened to expel the settlers by force if necessary.

In 1775, a treaty meeting was held between the Cherokee and a delegation of the Transylvania Company, headed by Richard Henderson. Under the Treaty of Sycamore Shoals (or the Treaty of Watauga), the Transylvania Company purchased a vast amount of land from the Cherokee, including most of present-day Kentucky and part of Tennessee. The treaty was technically illegal since only the government could have formal transactions and purchase land from Native American tribes. (The British, the colonial governments of Virginia and North Carolina and, later, the United States, all forbade private purchase of land from Indians).

During the treaty process, Dragging Canoe, son of Cherokee chief Attacullaculla, made a speech condemning the sale of any Cherokee land, which the tribe held in common for the use of all. He broke from the general Cherokee tribal government to form a band that the pioneers called the Chickamauga Cherokee or Chickamauga, for their settlement, although the people never had a separate tribal identity. After Henderson&#x27;s Transylvania Company had bought Kentucky (although other tribes such as the Shawnee also claimed it), Daniel Boone was hired to widen the Indian path over Cumberland Gap to facilitate migration by Anglo-American pioneers. This road became known as the Wilderness Road.

Robertson&#x27;s group lived at Watauga in peace until July 1776, when Chief Old Abraham of Chilhowee led a Cherokee contingent that attacked Fort Watauga (a defensive log fort built by the Watauga Association). A 40-man contingent commanded by John Carter, with Robertson and John Sevier as lieutenants, withstood a siege of about two weeks. After the Cherokee were subjugated later that year, the governor of North Carolina appointed Robertson as Indian agent to reside at the Cherokee capital. He was to prevent them from forming an alliance with the British to fight as their allies against the rebels during the American Revolution.

==Fort Nashborough==
In the spring of 1779, during the Revolutionary War, Robertson and John Donelson founded Fort Nashborough, later to become Nashville. It was then part of the Washington District, North Carolina. He represented Davidson County (home of Fort Nashborough in present-day Tennessee, not to be confused with the modern Davidson County, North Carolina), in the North Carolina legislature and had the settlement established as a town. He also established the first school there, the historic Davidson Academy for male students.

The Spanish governor of former French territory west of the Mississippi River offered Robertson peace and the free navigation of the Mississippi in exchange for his leaving the United States and establishing — along with the Watauga settlement and Kentucky — an independent government. He refused to consider the matter.

In 1790, Robertson was appointed brigadier-general of the territorial militia by U.S. President George Washington, serving until 1796. He shared with Sevier the honor and affection of Tennesseans. He was appointed as Indian commissioner, serving until his death in 1814.

==Death and legacy==
Robertson died near Memphis and was buried there. His family had his remains moved and re-interred in 1825 in the Nashville City Cemetery, to memorialize his contributions there. 

Robertson and his wife had several children: 
* Jonathan Friar Robertson m. Ciddy Davis 
* James Randolph Robertson, &quot;beheaded by the Indians and the head was paraded on a pole at their camp&quot; circa 1794, possibly triggering the unauthorized Nickajack Expedition 
* Delilah Robertson m. John Bosley 
* Peyton Henderson Robertson (c. 1775–1787), beheaded &quot;by Indians&quot;
* Charlotte Robertson, died young 
* Felix Robertson m. Lydia Waters; served as Mayor of Nashville from 1818 to 1819
* Charlotte Robertson m. Richard C. Napier 
* William Blount Robertson m. Leodocia Erwin 
* Peyton Robertson m. Ellen Davis 
* Lavinia Robertson m (1) John Beck Jr., (2) John B. Craighead 
* John McNairy Robertson m. Lucy Scale 

Robertson&#x27;s great-granddaughter, Medora Cheatham, married Telfair Hodgson Jr., the treasurer of and a developer of Belle Meade, Tennessee. She was the honorary president-general of the United Daughters of the Confederacy (UDC).

==Legacy and honors==
*Robertson County, Tennessee was named in his honor in 1796
*A memorial obelisk was installed in his honor in the Nashville City Cemetery.
*In World War II the United States liberty ship &quot;SS James Robertson&quot; was named in his honor.
*A memorial plaque is installed on a large rock that gives directions to where his family home in Wake County NC was. This plaque is located at the intersection of Battle Bridge Road and Auburn Knightdale Road. And can be seen here;

<text>Dorsoduro is one of the six sestieri of Venice, in northern Italy.

Dorsoduro includes the highest land areas of the city and also Giudecca island and Isola Sacca Fisola. Its name derives from the Italian for &quot;hard back&quot;, due to its comparatively high, stable, rocky land.

==History==
The original heart of the area was the Giudecca Canal, along which buildings were constructed from the sixth century. By the eleventh century, settlement had spread across to the Grand Canal, while later religious buildings including the Basilica of Santa Maria della Salute and the Zattere quay are now its main landmarks.

In the nineteenth century the Accademia was set up in Dorsoduro and the Ponte dell&#x27;Accademia linked it to San Marco, making it an expensive area, popular with foreign residents. The western quarter end and the Giudecca, became industrialised around this time.

==Main sights==
Landmarks and visitor attractions in Dorsoduro include:

*Ca&#x27; Foscari
*Ca&#x27; Rezzonico
*Campo San Barnaba
*Campo San Gregorio

<text>Frederick Sound (also called Prince Frederick Sound or Prince Frederick&#x27;s Sound) is a passage of water in the Alexander Archipelago in Southeast Alaska that separates Kupreanof Island to the south from Admiralty Island in the north.

Frederick Sound was named by Captain George Vancouver for Prince Frederick, Duke of York and Albany. It was first charted in 1794 by two of his men, Joseph Whidbey and James Johnstone. The sound may also be known as the Russian transliteration Fridrikhe Zund.

The sound is a popular location for watching whales in the summer and is busy marine passageway for both Alaska Marine Highway ferries and cruise ships.

The sound is home to the Five Finger Islands Light.

<text>In meteorology, the planetary boundary layer (PBL), also known as the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) or peplosphere, is the lowest part of the atmosphere and its behaviour is directly influenced by its contact with a planetary surface. On Earth it usually responds to changes in surface radiative forcing in an hour or less. In this layer physical quantities such as flow velocity, temperature, and moisture display rapid fluctuations (turbulence) and vertical mixing is strong. Above the PBL is the &quot;free atmosphere&quot;, where the wind is approximately geostrophic (parallel to the isobars), while within the PBL the wind is affected by surface drag and turns across the isobars (see Ekman layer for more detail).

==Cause of surface wind gradient==

Typically, due to aerodynamic drag, there is a wind gradient in the wind flow ~100 meters above the Earth&#x27;s surface—the surface layer of the planetary boundary layer. Wind speed increases with increasing height above the ground, starting from zero due to the no-slip condition. Flow near the surface encounters obstacles that reduce the wind speed, and introduce random vertical and horizontal velocity components at right angles to the main direction of flow.
This turbulence causes vertical mixing between the air moving horizontally at one level and the air at those levels immediately above and below it, which is important in dispersion of pollutants and in soil erosion.

The reduction in velocity near the surface is a function of surface roughness, so wind velocity profiles are quite different for different terrain types. Rough, irregular ground, and man-made obstructions on the ground can reduce the geostrophic wind speed by 40% to 50%. Over open water or ice, the reduction may be only 20% to 30%. These effects are taken into account when siting wind turbines.

For engineering purposes, the wind gradient is modeled as a simple shear exhibiting a vertical velocity profile varying according to a power law with a constant exponential coefficient based on surface type. The height above ground where surface friction has a negligible effect on wind speed is called the &quot;gradient height&quot; and the wind speed above this height is assumed to be a constant called the &quot;gradient wind speed&quot;. For example, typical values for the predicted gradient height are 457 m for large cities, 366 m for suburbs, 274 m for open terrain, and 213 m for open sea.

Although the power law exponent approximation is convenient, it has no theoretical basis. When the temperature profile is adiabatic, the wind speed should vary logarithmically with height. Measurements over open terrain in 1961 showed good agreement with the logarithmic fit up to 100 m or so (within the surface layer), with near constant average wind speed up through 1000 m.

The shearing of the wind is usually three-dimensional, that is, there is also a change in direction between the &#x27;free&#x27; pressure gradient-driven geostrophic wind and the wind close to the ground. This is related to the Ekman spiral effect. 
The cross-isobar angle of the diverted ageostrophic flow near the surface ranges from 10° over open water, to 30° over rough hilly terrain, and can increase to 40°-50° over land at night when the wind speed is very low.

After sundown the wind gradient near the surface increases, with the increasing stability.
Atmospheric stability occurring at night with radiative cooling tends to vertically constrain turbulent eddies, thus increasing the wind gradient. The magnitude of the wind gradient is largely influenced by the weather, principally atmospheric stability and the height of any convective boundary layer or capping inversion. This effect is even larger over the sea, where there is much less diurnal variation of the height of the boundary layer than over land.
In the convective boundary layer, strong mixing diminishes vertical wind gradient.

==Nocturnal and diurnal conditions==
The planetary boundary layer is different between day and night. During the day inversion layers formed during the night are broken up as a consequence of the turbulent rise of heated air. The boundary layer stabilises &quot;shortly before sunset&quot; and remains so during the night. All this make up a daily cycle. During winter and cloudy days the breakup of the nighttime layering is incomplete and atmospheric conditions established in previous days can persist. The breakup of the nighttime boundary layer structure is fast on sunny days. The driving force is convective cells with narrow updraft areas and large areas of gentle downdraft. These cells exceed 200–500 m in diameter.

==Constituent layers==

As Navier–Stokes equations suggest, the planetary boundary layer turbulence is produced in the layer with the largest velocity gradients that is at the very surface proximity. This layer – conventionally called a surface layer – constitutes about 10% of the total PBL depth. Above the surface layer the PBL turbulence gradually dissipates, losing its kinetic energy to friction as well as converting the kinetic to potential energy in a density stratified flow. The balance between the rate of the turbulent kinetic energy production and its dissipation determines the planetary boundary layer depth. The PBL depth varies broadly. At a given wind speed, e.g. 8 m/s, and so at a given rate of the turbulence production, a PBL in wintertime Arctic could be as shallow as 50 m, a nocturnal PBL in mid-latitudes could be typically 300 m in thickness, and a tropical PBL in the trade-wind zone could grow to its full theoretical depth of 2000 m. The PBL depth can be 4000 m or higher in late afternoon over desert.

In addition to the surface layer, the planetary boundary layer also comprises the PBL &quot;core&quot; (between 0.1 and 0.7 of the PBL depth) and the PBL top or &quot;entrainment layer&quot; or &quot;capping inversion layer&quot; (between 0.7 and 1 of the PBL depth). Four main external factors determine the PBL depth and its mean vertical structure: 
# the free atmosphere wind speed;
# the surface heat (more exactly buoyancy) balance;
# the free atmosphere density stratification;
# the free atmosphere vertical wind shear or baroclinicity.

==Principal types==
===Convective planetary boundary layer (CBL)===

A convective planetary boundary layer is a type of planetary boundary layer where positive buoyancy flux at the surface creates a thermal instability and thus generates additional or even major turbulence. (This is also known as having CAPE or convective available potential energy; see atmospheric convection.) A convective boundary layer is typical in tropical and mid-latitudes during daytime. Solar heating assisted by the heat released from the water vapor condensation could create such strong convective turbulence that the free convective layer comprises the entire troposphere up to the tropopause (the boundary in the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere between the troposphere and the stratosphere), which is at 10 km to 18 km in the Intertropical convergence zone).

===Stably stratified planetary boundary layer (SBL)===

The SBL is a PBL when negative buoyancy flux at the surface damps the turbulence; see Convective inhibition. An SBL is solely driven by the wind shear turbulence and hence the SBL cannot exist without the free atmosphere wind. An SBL is typical in nighttime at all locations and even in daytime in places where the Earth&#x27;s surface is colder than the air above. An SBL plays a particularly important role in high latitudes where it is often prolonged (days to months), resulting in very cold air temperatures.

Physical laws and equations of motion, which govern the planetary boundary layer dynamics and microphysics, are strongly non-linear and considerably influenced by properties of the Earth&#x27;s surface and evolution of processes in the free atmosphere. To deal with this complexity, the whole array of turbulence modelling has been proposed. However, they are often not accurate enough to meet practical requirements. Significant improvements are expected from application of a large eddy simulation technique to problems related to the PBL.

Perhaps the most important processes, which are critically dependent on the correct representation of the PBL in the atmospheric models (Atmospheric Model Intercomparison Project), are turbulent transport of moisture (evapotranspiration) and pollutants (air pollutants). Clouds in the boundary layer influence trade winds, the hydrological cycle, and energy exchange.

<doc id="927644" wikidata="Q1898080" url="?curid=927644" title="Underwriting">
<text>Underwriting (UW) services are provided by some large financial institutions, such as banks, insurance companies and investment houses, whereby they guarantee payment in case of damage or financial loss and accept the financial risk for liability arising from such guarantee. An underwriting arrangement may be created in a number of situations including insurance, issues of security in a public offering, and bank lending, among others. The person or institution that agrees to sell a minimum number of securities of the company for commission is called the underwriter.

== History ==
The term &quot;underwriting&quot; derives from the Lloyd&#x27;s of London insurance market. Financial backers (or risk takers), who would accept some of the risk on a given venture (historically a sea voyage with associated risks of shipwreck) in exchange for a premium, would literally write their names under the risk information that was written on a Lloyd&#x27;s slip created for this purpose.

==Securities underwriting==
In the financial primary market, securities underwriting is the process by which investment banks raise investment capital from buyers on behalf of corporations and governments by issuing securities (such as stocks or bonds). As an underwriter, the investment bank guarantees a price for these securities, facilitates the issuance of the securities, and then sells them to the public (or retains them for their own proprietary account). This process is often seen in initial public offerings (IPOs), where investment banks help a corporation raise funds from the public. The underwriter is obligated to purchase the entire issue at a predetermined price before reselling the securities in the market. Should they not be able to find buyers, they will have to hold some securities themselves. To reduce the risk, they may form a syndicate with other investment banks. Each bank will buy a portion of the security issue, and typically resell securities from that portion to the public. Underwriters make their profit from the price difference (called &quot;underwriting spread&quot;) between the price they pay the issuer and what they collect from buyers or from broker-dealers who buy portions of the offering.

The services provided in the process of underwriting include:
# Giving advice on whether to issue stocks or bonds, the timing of issuance (ideally, corporations should sell securities when they will obtain the highest possible price). Underwriters also have to determine at what price the security should be sold.
# Filing documents: assisting companies with making the filings required by financial authorities. Companies issuing new securities to the general public must file a registration statement detailing their financial conditions, management, competition, industry, experience, funding purposes, and securities&#x27; risk assessment. A portion of this statement is reproduced in a document called a prospectus, which investors can access to obtain information about new securities.
# Underwriting: A company sells the entire issue to the underwriter at an agreed price. The underwriter will then sell it to the public at a higher price to achieve a profit, to the extent that it does not retain part of the issue as a proprietary holding.

===Risk, exclusivity, and reward===
Once the underwriting agreement is struck, the underwriter bears the risk of being unable to sell the underlying securities, and the cost of holding them on its books until such time in the future that they may be favorably sold.

If the instrument is desirable, the underwriter and the securities issuer may choose to enter into an exclusivity agreement. In exchange for a higher price paid upfront to the issuer, or other favorable terms, the issuer may agree to make the underwriter the exclusive agent for the initial sale of the securities instrument. That is, even though third-party buyers might approach the issuer directly to buy, the issuer agrees to sell exclusively through the underwriter.

In summary, the securities issuer gets cash up front, access to the contacts and sales channels of the underwriter, and is insulated from the market risk of being unable to sell the securities at a good price. The underwriter receives a profit from the markup, plus the possibility of an exclusive sales agreement.

Also, if the securities are priced significantly below market price (as is often the custom), the underwriter also curries favor with powerful customers by granting them an immediate profit (see flipping), perhaps in a &quot;quid pro quo&quot;. This practice, which is typically justified as the reward for the underwriter for taking on the market risk, is occasionally criticized as unethical, such as the allegations that investment banker Frank Quattrone acted improperly in doling out hot IPO stock during the dot-com bubble.

In an attempt to capture more of the value of their securities for themselves, issuing companies are increasingly turning to alternative vehicles for going public, such as direct listings and SPACs.

==Bank underwriting==
In banking, underwriting is the detailed credit analysis preceding the granting of a loan, based on credit information furnished by the borrower; such underwriting falls into several areas:

*Consumer loan underwriting includes the verification of such items as employment history, salary and financial statements; publicly available information, such as the borrower&#x27;s credit history, which is detailed in a credit report; and the lender&#x27;s evaluation of the borrower&#x27;s credit needs and ability to pay. Examples include mortgage underwriting.
*Commercial (or business) underwriting consists of the evaluation of financial information provided by small businesses including analysis of the business balance sheet including tangible net worth, the ratio of debt to worth (leverage) and available liquidity (current ratio). Analysis of the income statement typically includes revenue trends, gross margin, profitability, and debt service coverage.

Underwriting can also refer to the purchase of corporate bonds, commercial paper, government securities, municipal general-obligation bonds by a commercial bank or dealer bank for its own account or for resale to investors. Bank underwriting of corporate securities is carried out through separate holding-company affiliates, called securities affiliates or Section 20 affiliates.

Of late, the discourse on underwriting has been dominated by the advent of machine learning in this space. These profound technological innovations are altering the way traditional underwriting scorecards have been built, and are displacing human underwriters with automation. Natural language understanding allows the consideration of more sources of information to assess risk than used previously. These algorithms typically use modern data sources such as SMS / Email for banking information, location data to verify addresses, and so on. Several firms are trying to build models that can gauge a customer&#x27;s willingness to pay using social media data by applying natural language understanding algorithms which essentially try to analyse and quantify a person&#x27;s popularity / likability and so on, with the premise being that people scoring high on these parameters are less likely to default on a loan. However, this area is still vastly subjective.

==Insurance underwriting==
Insurance underwriters evaluate the risk and exposures of potential clients. They decide how much coverage the client should receive, how much they should pay for it, and whether to accept the risk. Underwriting involves measuring risk exposure and determining the premium that needs to be charged to insure that risk. The function of the underwriter is to protect the company&#x27;s book of business from risks that they feel will make a loss and issue insurance policies at a premium that is commensurate with the exposure presented by a risk.

Each insurance company has its own set of underwriting guidelines to help the underwriter determine whether or not the company should accept the risk. The information used to evaluate the risk of an applicant for insurance will depend on the type of coverage involved. For example, in underwriting automobile coverage, an individual&#x27;s driving record is critical. However, the type of automobile is actually far more critical. As part of the underwriting process for life or health insurance, medical underwriting may be used to examine the applicant&#x27;s health status (other factors may be considered as well, such as occupation and risky pursuits) and decide whether the policy can be issued on the standard terms applicable to the customer&#x27;s age. The factors that insurers use to classify risks are generally objective, clearly related to the likely cost of providing coverage, practical to administer, consistent with applicable law, and designed to protect the long-term viability of the insurance program.

Underwriters may choose to decline a risk, provide a quotation with adjusted premiums, or apply policy exclusions. Adjusted premiums typically include a loading factor, which accounts for administrative costs, expected claims, and a margin for profit. Policy exclusions, on the other hand, limit the circumstances under which claims can be made. Depending on the type of insurance product (line of business), insurance companies use automated underwriting systems to encode these rules, and reduce the amount of manual work in processing quotations and policy issuance. This is especially the case for certain simpler life or personal lines (auto, homeowners) insurance. Some insurance companies, however, rely on agents to underwrite for them. This arrangement allows an insurer to operate in a market closer to its clients without having to establish a physical presence.

Two major categories of exclusion in insurance underwriting are moral hazard and correlated losses. With a moral hazard, the consequences of the customer&#x27;s actions are insured, making the customer more likely to take costly actions. For example, bedbugs are typically excluded from homeowners&#x27; insurance to avoid paying for the consequence of recklessly bringing in a used mattress. Insured events are generally those outside the control of the customer, for example in life insurance, death by automobile accident is typically covered, but death by suicide is typically not covered. Correlated losses are those that can affect a large number of customers at the same time, thus potentially bankrupting the insurance company. This is why typical homeowner&#x27;s policies cover damage from fire or falling trees (usually affecting an individual house), but not floods or earthquakes (which affect many houses at the same time).

For all types of insurance underwriting, advice and assistance is often provided by reinsurers, who of course have an interest in accepting risks on appropriate terms.

==Other forms==

===Continuous underwriting===
Continuous underwriting is the process in which the risks involved in insuring people or assets are being evaluated and analyzed on a continuous basis. It evolved from the traditional underwriting, in which the risks only get assessed before the policy is signed or renewed. Continuous underwriting was first used in workers&#x27; compensation, where the premium of the insurance was updated monthly, based on the insured&#x27;s submitted payroll. It is also used in life insurance and cyber insurance.

===Real estate underwriting===
Real estate underwriting is the evaluation of a real estate investment, either of equity ownership or of a real estate loan. The underwriting process generally involves a detailed analysis of expected cash flows, the local market, supply and demand, and risks such as the physical state of the property, environmental or geotechnical risks, zoning, taxes, and insurance. In the evaluation of a real estate loan, lenders assess both the risk of lending to a specific borrower as well as the risk of the underlying real estate. Loan underwriters use various metrics including debt service coverage ratio, loan-to-value ratio, and debt yield ratio to assess out whether the property is capable of making debt service payments.

===Forensic underwriting===
Forensic underwriting is the &quot;after-the-fact&quot; process used by lenders to determine what went wrong with a mortgage. Forensic underwriting is a borrower&#x27;s ability to work out a modification scenario with their current lien holder, not to qualify them for a new loan or a refinance. This is typically done by an underwriter staffed with a team of people who are experienced in every aspect of the real estate field.

===Sponsorship underwriting===

Underwriting may also refer to financial sponsorship of a venture, and is also used as a term within public broadcasting (both public television and radio) to describe funding given by a company or organization for the operations of the service, in exchange for a mention of their product or service within the station&#x27;s programming.

===Thomson Financial league tables===
Underwriting activity in the mergers and acquisitions, equity issuance, debt issuance, syndicated loans and U.S. municipal bond markets is reported in the Thomson Financial league tables.

<text>Harpoon Brewery is an employee owned American brewery, with locations in Boston, Massachusetts, and Windsor, Vermont.

==History==

Harpoon Brewery, also known as Mass. Bay Brewing Company, Inc., was originally founded in 1986. The brewery was the first company to obtain a permit to manufacture and sell alcohol in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts in more than 15 years, and as a result laid claim to Massachusetts Brewing permit #001. Harpoon originally struggled to break even; the company reportedly first made a profit in 1992.

Harpoon was the first brewery in New England to brew an India Pale Ale. The beer was originally designed by Head Brewer (at the time) Tod Mott, in 1992 and first sold as a summer seasonal in 1993 and quickly became the brewery&#x27;s flagship beer. Harpoon IPA quickly became a staple of the American India pale ale style and was found on tap at bars and restaurants in Greater Boston.

Locally, Harpoon is known for annual festivals that they hold at the brewery. In 1990, Harpoon threw the first Harpoon Octoberfest, which drew 2,000 people. Recent Harpoon Octoberfests have drawn more than 15,000 attendees. Harpoon also holds an annual St. Patrick&#x27;s Day festival in early March and Harpoonfest in May.

In 2001, Harpoon started a five-mile road race known as the Harpoon 5-Miler. The race has reportedly raised more than $2.2 million for ALS research via The Angel Fund. In 2002, Harpoon launched the Harpoon Point-to-Point, a cycling race that raises money for the Vermont Foodbank. The race last raised more than $100,000.

Harpoon purchased the former Catamount Brewery plant in Windsor, Vermont, in 2000, expanding its brewing operations beyond Massachusetts.

In July 2014, while then the twelfth-largest craft brewery in the United States, the company became employee-owned via the creation of the Harpoon Employee Stock Ownership Plan. Harpoon&#x27;s cofounder, Rich Doyle, along with other key investors, sold most of their shares in Harpoon and transferred them into an Employee Stock Ownership Plan.

In 2015, for the first time since its founding, Harpoon Brewery suspended production of its beer citing an imminent blizzard. Following the COVID-19 pandemic, the Brewery ran a campaign to fight food insecurity, donating money from beer purchases to the Vermont Foodbank and Greater Boston Food Bank.

In June 2022, Harpoon acquired the Long Trail Brewery of Bridgewater, Vermont. The deal involved Harpoon assuming possession of the Long Trail, Otter Creek and Shed brands.

==Products==

Harpoon has seasonal beers, including an Octoberfest Marzen style Ale and Harpoon Camp Wannamango Another line of beers from Harpoon is its &#x27;100 Barrel Series&#x27;, which consists of a number of one of a kind batches.

It brews multiple other year-round beers including the award-winning Dark, UFO Hefeweizen, UFO Raspberry Hefeweizen, UFO White, and Boston Irish Stout. It also brews several house beers at Boston bars, including &quot;Sevens Ale&quot; for the Sevens Ale House in Beacon Hill. Other offerings include Rec League, a New England Pale Ale, Big League, a big and juicy IPA, UFO Light Force, a light white, UFO Maine Blueberry, and selected Clown Shoes beers.

In 2017, Harpoon began collaborating with Cleveland&#x27;s Great Lakes Brewing Company to package several varieties of Great Lakes Beer in cans.

In 2018, Harpoon teamed with Dunkin&#x27; Donuts to release Dunkin&#x27; Coffee Porter. They have released collaborative mix packs of beer with Dunkin’ Donuts every year since. In 2022, the company&#x27;s flavors included Harpoon Dunkin’ Cold Brew Coffee Porter, Harpoon Dunkin’ Hazelnut Blonde Stout and Harpoon Dunkin’ Coffee Roll Cream Ale.

In 2022, Harpoon teamed up with the Boston Bruins hockey team to create a limited-edition beer called Hometown Hat Trick. The brewery also introduced a custom blood orange IPA in partnership with the Davio&#x27;s restaurant in Boston&#x27;s Seaport District. The same year, the company also introduced a non-alcoholic IPA called Open League, with 35 calories per serving.

Harpoon Brewery is also well known for their various pretzels made on site, which are made from leftover yeast of beer brewing. Harpoon used to produce several non-alcoholic sodas, including root beer, orange and cream, and cream soda, but ceased production in 2009. As of 2022, its homemade root beer is available on draft at its breweries.

<doc id="927665" wikidata="Q52428" url="?curid=927665" title="Santa Croce (Venice)">
<text>Santa Croce is one of the six sestieri of Venice, northern Italy.

During the eleventh century, in 1273, it was administered by the Hungarian nobleman and crusader knight Giovanni, member of one of the biggest Christian families in Hungary Renoldi, as reported by the book published in 1866 in Florence &quot;book of the Venetian noblemen for the first time shown&quot;.

==Geography==
It occupies the north west part of the main islands, and can be divided into two areas: the eastern area being largely mediaeval, and the western - including the main port and the Tronchetto - mostly lying on land reclaimed in the 20th century.

The district includes the Piazzale Roma, home to Venice&#x27;s bus station and car parks, and around which is the only area of the city in which cars can travel. The tourist attractions lie mostly in the eastern part of the quarter, and include the churches of San Nicolo da Tolentino, San Giacomo dell&#x27;Orio, and San Zan Degola; the Fondaco dei Turchi; the Museum of the History of Fabric and Costume at Palazzo Mocenigo; the Patrician Palace; and Ca&#x27; Corner della Regina.

==History==
The area was once part of the Luprio swamp, but has been steadily reclaimed.

It is the area of the city most affected by the opening of the lagoon road in April 1933.

<text>Air Zonk, known in Japan as , is a horizontally scrolling shooter released for the TurboGrafx-16 in 1992. &quot;Air Zonk&quot; was an effort to update the company&#x27;s image with a modern, punkish character named Zonk, who bears a deliberate resemblance to the TurboGrafx-16&#x27;s caveman mascot, Bonk.

The game was developed by Red Company, the original creators of the Bonk series, and also known for their &quot;Gate of Thunder&quot; series. &quot;Air Zonk&quot; features King Drool, the antagonist of the &quot;Bonk&quot; series, along with many other enemies from that series. A sequel, &quot;Super Air Zonk: Rockabilly-Paradise&quot;, was released in 1993 for the TurboDuo and has been made available on the Wii&#x27;s Virtual Console.

==Gameplay==
&quot;Air Zonk&quot; is a reimagining of the &quot;Bonk&quot; video game series as a scrolling shooter set in the future. Artistically, the game is lighthearted, featuring humorous designs for the environment and characters. Throughout the five levels, the gameplay focuses on the effective use of shooting and bombing to complete each stage. At the start, the player may choose a companion character to team up with, such as an anthropomorphic gumball machine or a mummy with a drill attached to its head, in order to enhance Bonk&#x27;s powers. Players can limit the use of designated companion characters for each level or opt not to use them at all. Each companion character, or friend, can only be used once. &quot;Air Zonk&quot; adopts the distinct visual style sometimes referred to as a &quot;cute &#x27;em up.&quot; There are three difficulty settings: sweet, spicy, and bitter.

Zonk can charge his shots, allowing him to fire a more powerful attack. A longer charge causes Zonk to drop a bomb, which damages all enemies on the screen. Zonk can also acquire seven types of power-ups, each of which can be charged for a unique special attack. As with most scrolling shooters, whenever Zonk acquires a new power-up, he loses the current one. If Zonk is hit while holding a power-up, he loses it but does not die, except in the case of the Mini-Zonk power-up. The Mini-Zonk power-up differs from other power-ups in that it cannot be charged and can be found in both florets and random enemy drops (while other power-ups can only be found in florets).

Zonk begins each stage alone and without power-ups. He must collect eight smiley faces, the eighth of which will appear in giant form with sunglasses, in order to summon his friend. Initially, the friend acts as a &quot;Gradius&quot;-style support, following Zonk and shooting projectiles. If the player collects another eight smiley faces, Zonk and his friend will merge into a hybrid form, granting a new attack and 20 seconds of invulnerability. This new attack cannot be charged, and Zonk cannot drop bombs while in hybrid form. Once invincibility expires, if Zonk is hit, he will revert to his normal form, and his friend will leave. However, Zonk retains any power-up he had before transforming into hybrid form.

==Reception==
&quot;Air Zonk&quot; was awarded Best TurboGrafx Game of 1992 by &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot;. The game has since gained a cult following. Many game critics consider &quot;Air Zonk&quot; to be one of the best games ever released for the TurboGrafx-16.

==Legacy==
&quot;Air Zonk&quot; received a sequel in 1993 titled &quot;Super Air Zonk: Rockabilly-Paradise&quot; (also known as &quot;CD Denjin Rockabilly&quot;), which was released in the SuperCD format and requires the Super System Card to play on first-generation TurboGrafx-CD consoles. As its name suggests, the game features a CD audio soundtrack consisting of rockabilly music. The game includes all-new levels, assistants, and enemies.

&quot;Air Zonk&quot; was released on the Wii&#x27;s Virtual Console in May 2007 in Japan, July in America, and on July 13 in Europe. It was also released on the Wii U&#x27;s Virtual Console in Japan on June 19, 2014, in America on July 27, 2017, and in Europe on August 3.

<doc id="927687" wikidata="Q1646263" url="?curid=927687" title="J. J. Pickle">
<text>James Jarrell &quot;Jake&quot; Pickle (October 11, 1913 – June 18, 2005) was a United States Representative from the 10th congressional district of Texas from 1963 to 1995.

== Early life ==
Pickle was born in Roscoe, Texas, and brought up in Big Spring. He acquired his nickname Jake from a mischievous character he portrayed in a family play when he was four years old. Pickle was an Eagle Scout and recipient of the Distinguished Eagle Scout Award from the Boy Scouts of America.

Pickle attended the public schools in Big Spring and received his Bachelor of Arts from the University of Texas at Austin where he was a member of the 1934 Southwest Conference championship swimming team and the student body president as a senior in 1937. He was also a member of the Friar Society.

== Career ==
Pickle was introduced by future governor John Connally to Representative Lyndon Johnson, who served as his political mentor. He assisted the latter in his 1940 election campaign and assisted Lady Bird Johnson in running the Congressional office. When the United States entered World War II, Pickle joined the Navy as a gunnery officer and was stationed on the cruisers and , surviving three torpedo attacks. When the war ended, he, Johnson, and Connally helped found a radio station (KVET) in Austin, Texas. After 10 years in the advertising business, he joined the Democratic Election Executive Committee of Texas in 1957.

Pickle was elected as a Democrat to the 88th Congress, by special election, to fill the vacancy caused by the resignation of U.S. Representative Homer Thornberry, who became a U.S. District judge. Pickle was reelected 15 times before retiring at the conclusion of the 103rd Congress. His campaign trademark was a &quot;squeaky pickle&quot; rubber toy he handed out to those he met in area parades.

While in the House, Pickle rose through the ranks to become the third ranking Democrat on the House Ways and Means Committee. Pickle voted in favor of the Civil Rights Acts of 1964 and 1968, and the Voting Rights Act of 1965. He was one of only eight Southern Representatives to vote for the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Pickle went on to play a key role in passing major Social Security reform legislation in 1983 to save the system from insolvency. The reforms increased the payroll tax rate, slowly increased the full benefit retirement age to 67 and taxed some of the benefits. He considered this legislation his greatest accomplishment.

Pickle was able to steer research money to the University of Texas, and today the university&#x27;s J. J. Pickle Research Campus is named in his honor. He was influential in the city of Austin, Texas, as well, most notably for relocating Austin&#x27;s main airport from Robert Mueller Municipal Airport to Austin-Bergstrom International Airport. He was also instrumental in bringing the SEMATECH and MCC consortiums to Austin.

== Personal life ==
Before Pickle left for World War II in 1942, he married Ella Nora &quot;Sugar&quot; Critz. They had one daughter together. Critz died in 1952, and Pickle married Beryl Bolton McCarroll in 1960.

Pickle was diagnosed with prostate cancer in 1991 and lymphoma in 2001. He died at his home in Austin on June 18, 2005, of complications from his cancer and is interred at the Texas State Cemetery there.

Peggy Pickle was Jake Pickle&#x27;s only daughter. She still makes contributions to the University of Texas at Austin on her father&#x27;s behalf. In 1997, Jake and Peggy Pickle wrote a book together called &quot;Jake&quot; with a foreword by former Texas governor Ann Richards.

<doc id="927688" wikidata="Q10210" url="?curid=927688" title="White wine">
<text>White wine is a wine that is fermented without undergoing the process of maceration, which involves prolonged contact between the juice with the grape skins, seeds, and pulp. The colour can be straw-yellow, yellow-green, or yellow-gold. It is produced by the alcoholic fermentation of the non-coloured pulp of grapes, which may have a skin of any colour. White wine has existed for at least 4,000 years.

The wide variety of white wines comes from the large number of varieties, methods of winemaking, and ratios of residual sugar. White wine is mainly from &quot;white&quot; grapes, which are green or yellow in colour, such as the Chardonnay, Sauvignon blanc and Riesling. Some white wine is also made from grapes with coloured skin, provided that the obtained wort is not stained. Pinot noir, for example, is commonly used to produce champagne.

Among the many types of white wine, dry white wine is the most common. More or less aromatic and tangy, it is derived from the complete fermentation of the wort. Sweet wines, on the other hand, are produced by interrupting the fermentation before all the grape sugars are converted into alcohol; this is called &quot;Mutage&quot; or fortification. The methods of enriching wort with sugar are multiple: on-ripening on the vine, &quot;passerillage&quot; (straining), or the use of &quot;noble rot&quot;. Sparkling wines, which are mostly white, are wines where the carbon dioxide from the fermentation is kept dissolved in the wine and becomes gas when the bottle is opened.

White wines are often used as an &quot;apéritif&quot; before a meal, with dessert, or as a refreshing drink between meals. White wines are often considered more refreshing and lighter in both style and taste than the majority of their red wine counterparts. Due to their acidity, aroma and ability to soften meat and deglaze cooking juices, white wines are often used in cooking.

== History ==


=== Antiquity ===
The first trace of wine that has been found dates to 7500 years ago, in present-day Iran but the results of archaeological excavations have not been able to determine from which time wine began to be produced. Epigraphy tells us about the presence of wine in the Middle East: it was produced in the &quot;High Country&quot; (the mountain borders between Anatolia and Armenia) and then imported into Mesopotamia especially from the 3rd millennium BC. The tablets of Hattusa describes wine with the term &quot;wiyana&quot; in the Hittite language, in Sumerian, and &quot;karânu&quot; in Akkadian. It could be red (), light (or maybe white: ), good wine (), honeyed () new (), or sour ().

In Ancient Greece wine had already been developed and used since Hippocrates, a physician born around 460 BC who commonly prescribed it to patients. &quot;Vinous white wine&quot; and &quot;bitter white wine&quot; were used among his remedies – a sign of diversity in production at that time.

In Roman times the type of viticulture practiced by the Greeks was their model; production included white wine. Rich Roman patricians organized banquets where the cost of the food was a sign of prestige. In the range of expensive products wine played a predominant role. The richest citizens built sumptuous villas in the Bay of Naples where the vine had been cultivated since its introduction by the Greeks. The &quot;aminum&quot; or ancient grape produced a sweet white wine produced as mulled wine resembling modern-day Madeira. The conquering of regions more and more to the north encouraged the Romans to cultivate the vine and to produce lighter and less sweet wines. It also encouraged them to seek new wild varieties adaptable to these distant areas where the Mediterranean varieties showed their limits. For example, vines were planted on the banks of the Rhine to provide the Legions with a healthy drink, as opposed to water which was rarely drinkable. The wine was drunk cool in summer and warm in winter, a practice which still continues in the 21st century.

=== Middle Ages ===
Wine merchants failed to survive the fall of the Western Roman Empire and viticulture declined dramatically. The Germanic tribes preferred to drink beer and did not see the value of the wine trade. The decline of viticulture was intensified when Vikings cut the sea lanes in the Atlantic. In the south the Saracens were making &quot;Ghazw&quot; or raids. These campaigns in southern Europe caused Languedoc, Provence, Southern Italy, and the Douro Valley to become depopulated – the people being taken into slavery or fleeing the threat.

Knowledge about the culture of grapevines was conserved by the Catholic Church: Wine was necessary for the celebration of Mass, and the monks planted vines at high latitudes and increased the monastic acreages. Difficult to transport and store, wine long remained a product for local consumption. The trade was re-established initially after the enrichment of the nobles and prelates because, as with the Romans, the art of the table reflected the reputation of the host.

River trade was of great importance in the development of vineyards. The Germanic countries benefited from the navigability of the Rhine and the Danube so they could export their production. Charlemagne contributed to this growth by enacting his &quot;Capitulare de villis&quot; which included a set of rules on the cultivation of the vine in all areas. It was an era of great development of the culture of white wine in Germany and Austria. The Central European vineyards reached 100,000 hectares, which was three and a half times the area in the 1990s. From the 13th century traders distinguished &quot;vinum hunicum&quot; (wine of the Huns), which was drunk by the people, from &quot;vinum francium&quot; (Wine of the Franks) which was the wine for the wealthy aristocracy. There was recognition of varieties of Riesling and Sylvaner from the late Middle Ages.

Part of European trade was by sea along the Atlantic coast. The English, then the Dutch and Scandinavians from their demand for wine, created a craze for planting between Bordeaux and La Rochelle. Little dry white wine was produced for export from La Rochelle while Bordeaux exported mainly wines from the hinterland received via the Garonne. When wine production was introduced on the banks of the Charente in the 17th century, Charente white wines were introduced as cognac. At the same time, the dry white wine popular with the Dutch was produced to the north, around the port of Nantes from the current areas of Muscadet AOC and &quot;Gros-plant AOVDQS&quot; in the Loire Valley. Vineyards in the Loire Valley and the South-west had their sales network thanks to the navigability of the Loire and the Garonne.

In the Mediterranean Basin the Crusades greatly enriched both rival republics of Venice and Genoa. To supply the troops of the rich Frankish lords these republics provided them with wine from Greece. The port of Monemvasia, which exported a large amount of white wine, gave its name to the variety Malvasia. The Crusaders also discovered Muscat wine. Once back home, the rulers and wealthy aristocrats looked to buy the sweet wines they enjoyed in the East. They came from grapes that dominated the vineyards of Languedoc-Roussillon and Spain. Trade in these wines was facilitated by their high alcohol content which ensured preservation during the long journey to Northern Europe.

=== Modern era ===
In 1453 the Ottoman Empire took Constantinople and the situation of the Venetians and Genovese deteriorated. The wine trade between the eastern Mediterranean and northern Europe fell sharply. At the same time, the Spanish had just completed their &quot;Reconquista&quot; and replaced the Mediterranean wine with its own, especially for English and Dutch consumers. The port of Sanlúcar de Barrameda began to export large quantities of white wine which was the ancestor of today&#x27;s sherry. This wine was called &quot;sack&quot; and caused a sensation in England. Even at the height of animosity between the two countries (as in the episode of the Spanish Armada in 1588) the trade continued – sometimes provided by pirates who stole what they could not buy. Between 40 and 60 thousand barrels each of 500 litres left the Spanish coast annually for England and the Netherlands (this volume of some 300,000 hectolitres represented two-thirds of today&#x27;s production).

From the 16th century the first European vines were planted in America: in Mexico, then Peru, Bolivia, Argentina, and Chile. These were in addition to the native vines that grew in Mexico, but this pre-Columbian production was not for the production of wine since the grapes were too acidic. It was used to produce &quot;acachul&quot; a drink sweetened with fruit and honey.

The Little Ice Age spelt the death knell of northern viticulture. The vine disappeared from northern Germany and Baden, and the maximum altitude for viticulture descended to 220 metres. Hans-Jürgen Otto noted that: &quot;all the vineyards suffered and decreased in area&quot;. In England the vine also disappeared. The less early vineyards preferred to select white varieties of grapes because, even if unripe, white grapes allowed wine that was a little sour to still be consumable, while red grapes do not give enough colour, and green tannins make the wine bitter. The interruption of the fermentation by a cold winter led to the discovery of the process of secondary fermentation of champagne.

The enrichment of some of the population created a craze for rare wines. This phenomenon, which was already responsible for the development of sherry in England, was reproduced in Central Europe. The discovery of the benefits of the noble rot on white grapes took place around 1650 in Hungary for the development of Tokaji wine. Hugh Johnson declared that: &quot;the Tokay of three centuries ago was the best sweet wine in the world, it was inherited from a long-standing winemaking tradition&quot;. Developed with a grape whose exceptional maturity is due to a trade secret, this wine also developed its qualities through a process that long remained a secret in underground cellars of the winery. Prized by the House of Habsburg, Tokay experienced profitable trading. Attempted imitation came to nought and the use of noble rot remained a secret. It was not until 120 years later that a method of very late harvest was experimented with on the steep banks of the Rhine. Its use in Sauternes was attested in 1836 in the Château La Tour Blanche but at that time very late harvest gave a very rich wine that required several years to age in barrels.

Other regions were discovering secrets which would make them rich. So it was that Dom Perignon was the legendary creator of champagne. In a northern vineyard he developed a special wine that would give rise to an exceptional passion for wine produced in a climate where it could not be expected for wine to reach maturity nor sufficient colour.

The fashion of drinking cheap dry white wine started in Paris in the 18th century. To evade the excise duty, Parisians took the habit of going to drink their wine at the producers premises outside the walls of the city. Cabarets opened their doors by the river, becoming Guinguettes (similar to taverns): so the wine that was drunk there was also called &quot;guinguet&quot;. This is a wine from the hills of the Seine or the Marne, sour, but the conditions of transport of the time did not allow it to be used prematurely.

=== Contemporary era ===
Champagne was created in the 18th century but it was in the next century that its global expansion would occur. The crowned heads of Europe quickly made the wine stylish in their courts although its production, necessarily in bottles, made for a very expensive product. Historian Hugh Johnson assigns an important diplomatic role to champagne: Talleyrand would have offered this wine at the negotiating table of the Congress of Vienna, using it to relax his partners in the discussions. The occupation of Champagne by Russian troops in 1815 publicized the sparkling wine to the Russian aristocracy. The &quot;Veuve Clicquot&quot; (Widow Clicquot) booked her wine to her occupants saying &quot;they drink today, tomorrow they will pay...&quot;

The progress of the glass industry (especially from the use of coal) helped to democratize the use of the glass bottle. The production of sparkling wine increased dramatically and spread to the American continent. The technique of manufacturing was industrialized and other regions were inspired but the reputation of champagne suffered. The commercial flight of champagne was a product of the Industrial Revolution that allowed it to be within the financial reach of the emerging middle classes.

The period of the 19th century before the arrival of phylloxera was a golden age of wine. The Industrial Revolution enriched a bourgeoisie clientele for the best wines and the rural exodus to factories created a large market for mass-produced wines. A prominent example for white wines was the viticulture in Germany. The feeling of freedom infused into the German winemakers under French occupation during the First Empire prevented the aristocracy and the clergy from recovering all the vineyards from which they were dispossessed. The practice of late harvest was widespread and the more or less sweet wines gained balance against their always lively acidity. In 1872, the Geisenheim Grape Breeding Institute was created, and it was the source of a great amount of interbreeding giving new varieties – the best known of these is the Müller-Thurgau. During the same period, Switzerland adopted, along the shores of Lake Geneva, vineyards predominantly producing white wine.

During the 20th century planting vines in countries where it was unknown was booming. However, it was shaky in places with higher temperatures during fermentation. The use of larger containers creates problems during fermentation: the yeasts produce heat which cannot escape and beyond 35 °C the micro-organisms begin to suffer and fermentation slows then stops. After cooling the wine a new addition of yeast is needed to resume fermentation (not to mention the adverse effects on the wine&#x27;s aromas and the risk of &quot;lactic bite&quot;). In California the search for temperature control of fermentation matured. Applied to white wine they revolutionized this type of wine. European wines, marked by their processes of crushing the grapes, are diametrically opposed to those very fruity wines marked by a refreshing liveliness. During the years 1960–1990, these methods of wine-making moved to Europe and the use of refrigeration equipment is now widely used in almost all regions producing white wine.

== Geographical distribution ==
=== Production ===
==== Climatic zones ====
Many wine-producing countries produce white wine. However, the white grape needs less heat than red grapes to ripen: The lack of maturity of tannins is not a problem since they are not extracted in pressing. In addition the taste balance is based on a significant liveliness due to the acidity. The grapes for the production of dry white wine are harvested just before ripening. These production conditions can result in a more northerly or mountainous location for the vineyard producing dry white wines.

In Europe, German vineyards are predominantly white (63.1% of production area in 2006), as are the Swiss vineyards (more than 50% of the area in production are white grapes) and the Luxembourg vineyards (93% of the production area in white or grey grapes). In France the northern half produces most of the white wines (Alsace, Jura, Champagne, and the Loire Valley). In Spain, paradoxically, Castile-La Mancha accounts for 50% of the Spanish vineyards, producing mostly white wine on a very large production area in a high temperature zone. The Catalonia region produces a lot of white grapes, which are transformed into Sparkling wine called &quot;Cava&quot;. The producing area for Cava is 45,000 hectares out of a total producing area of 65,600 hectares.

The Americas have developed both white and red wines, some of which are now recognized worldwide. White wines have to conquer hostile territories where red wine dominates, such as the Rocky Mountains or Canada. In Canada, the technique of ice wine can produce exceptional wines in a climate which is apparently unfavourable. Canada is the largest producer of ice wine in the world.

The warmer southern areas also produce white wine, but in a lower proportion. In addition, it is more often sweet or fortified wines, natural sweet wines or &quot;vinés&quot; wines, as in the case of vineyards around the Mediterranean (muscat, madeira, marsala etc.).

==== Geological zones ====
According to Claude and Lydia Bourguignon, red wines are well suited to soil based on limestone while the best white wines are produced on soils over metamorphic rocks (Alsace, Moselle, Anjou) or volcanic rocks (Tokaj in Hungary and Slovakia).

In addition, white wines are also produced on land with a limestone sub-soil such as the chalky base of the Champagne wine region or the limestone under siliceous marl of Chassagne-Montrachet form the backdrop to some of the most prestigious wines in the world.
== Grape varieties ==
Numerous varieties of grapes can be used to develop white wine.

Some have achieved a strong reputation thanks to their marketing of a wine variety:
* Chardonnay: originating from Burgundy and long sold under that name under the communal AOC or premier and grand crus, it has spread to many new producing countries who sell under the name of the grape. It can be made sparkling or still. It typically has a wider-bodied and rich citrus taste compared to other white wines. A common choice of food pairing for this wine is fish or poultry. It owes its world distribution to its quality in a very wide variety of regions of climate and geology: from France to the United States, Australia, and South Africa
* Sauvignon blanc: originating from the centre of France and the Bordeaux vineyards, it then spread to the vineyards of the South-West and the Loire Valley. Noticed by Anglo-Saxon consumers, it spread to growing regions in the United States, Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa. It is remarkable for its typical vegetable/mineral aromas so tends to be flat and lack fruit qualities. The dominating flavours range from sour green fruit such as of apple, pear and gooseberry through to tropical fruit such as melon, mango and blackcurrant. A common food pairing for this wine is seafood, poultry, and salad.
* Riesling: originates from German vineyards (Germany, Alsace, Switzerland). It is a grape that can be of high quality in a variety of soils provided that yield is limited and climate tends to a continental climate. This type is much lighter in comparison to other white wines and typically has a green apple aroma. Common food dishes that go well with Riesling are fish, chicken, and pork.
* Müller-Thurgau: the most widely grown grape in Germany, which gives a fruity and well-balanced wine but that cannot be kept very long
* Muscat : a group of varieties (over 150 according to Pierre Galet) which have specific aromas. Typically made from Italian- and Austrian-grown grapes, it can offer a sweet and fruity taste. Shows best on its own without a food pairing.
* Petite Arvine originated in the Valais in Switzerland. Historical documents reveal it has been grown since the early 17th century, around 1602. Typically medium-dry, this textured wine contains a generous amount of extract from its thick-skinned berries. Highly regarded by modest vintners, it has become the most frequently grown wine in the most prominent wine-growing region of Switzerland. The variety is often paired with central and northern European foods.

Other grape varieties are less well known because they may be marketed under an &quot;Appellation&quot; or mixed with other varieties:
* Airén: a little-known variety, yet it is the most planted vat wine in the world with 390,000 hectares. It is second only to the sultana. Grown almost exclusively in Spain, it is planted in a low density and produces a dry white wine consumed locally
* Catarratto bianco comune: a grape from southern Italy, it gives an aromatic and high alcohol (14% of volume) wine. It is one of the varieties of grape used to produce Marsala and Madeira.
* Chenin blanc: a French grape from the Loire Valley, it is also grown in South Africa. It yields a very fruity wine, sometimes mineral, dry, or sweet depending on the soil. It can be kept for a long time and take on the noble rot
* Maccabeu: a Spanish grape, it is used to develop Cava, the Spanish sparkling wine. It is also grown in the vineyards of Languedoc-Roussillon in France. Its wine is dry and fruity and yields a Fortified wine
* Sémillon: a grape originally from Bordeaux vineyards, it is the main variety used for sweet wines from Bordeaux and Bergerac due to its ability to take the noble rot. It possesses a fig-like characteristic and is often paired with Sauvignon blanc to mellow its strong berry-like flavours.
* Trebbiano bianco or Ugni Blanc: an Italian grape variety giving a fairly neutral wine. In France this wine is usually distilled to yield cognac or armagnac
* Viognier: a French grape from the Rhône Valley, it has been planted in California since the 2000s. It yields a very fruity and complex wine
* Grenache blanc: this is the white form of Grenache black N. A variety of quality, it produces fine full-bodied dry wines, albeit with sometimes deficient acidity. It also provides natural sweet wines of high quality.

Some varieties with coloured skins are also used to produce white wines:
* Gewürztraminer: This grape has a pink skin. Vinified in white, this is a very aromatic grape with typical aromas reminiscent of pink flowers and lychees. It is grown all over the Alps. It is an aromatic mutation of Traminer (in German &quot;gewürzt&quot; means &quot;spiced&quot;)
* Grenache Gris: this is the rosé form of Grenache. It is used in the amber versions of Grenache from Rivesaltes AOC, a natural sweet wine white with a darker colour from oxidation.
* Malbec: this deep purple and thin-skinned grape variety is typically used for making red wine. However, white Malbec wines have been produced in recent years, with the first vintage being produced in 2011.
* Pinot gris (Pinot grigio) is planted extensively the Venice region of Italy. The colour of these grapes range from a copper yellow to light pink. It typically has a crisp fruity flavour which allows for a versatile food pairing.
* Pinot noir and Pinot Meunier: These grapes are used for the development of champagne and rose wines.
* Sauvignon gris: used to make rosé from Sauvignon blanc, it has a superior richness in sugar and heavier aromas. It is particularly well suited to the production of sweet wines

== Components of the grape and the must ==

=== The stalk ===
The stalk (or &quot;rafle&quot;) is the herbaceous branch that bears the grapes. It consists of about 80% water, soluble minerals (nearly 3% with half of potassium) and polyphenols. The polyphenols are mainly tannins and are responsible for the bitter taste and the sensation of astringency. In the production of a white wine, the stalk does not contain any useful part: its moisture can cause dilution and the presence of tannins is not desirable in the wine. This is why it is quickly isolated from the rest of the harvest, either by shaking or by pressing.

=== The grape berry ===
The grape berry is made of skin, flesh (or pulp), and seeds. The seeds are hard and are 2 to 5% by weight of the berry. The seeds contain 25-45% water, 34-36% carbohydrates, 13-20% fat (the grape seed oil), 4-6% tannins, 4-6.5% protein, 2-4% minerals, and 1% fatty acids. Their contribution in white wine is zero since they are removed in the pressing, in addition, the pressure is insufficient to extract anything from the seed.

The skin is 6-12% by weight of the grape. It is coated on the surface with Pruinescence, a waxy coating that gives a matte finish to the colour of the grape and contains the yeast responsible for fermentation. The grape skin also contains volatile compounds in its deeper layers. These are responsible for the aroma of the grape and for the molecules that become the aroma of wine during fermentation: They are the &quot;aroma precursors&quot;. In red grapes, the film also contains anthocyanins or coloured matter, which is from bright to purplish red. To produce white wine from red grapes, it is necessary not to macerate the grapes, nor to press too hard on the harvest to avoid the dissolving of the anthocyanins in the grape juice. The skin contains a lot of cellulose, insoluble pectin and proteins, and organic acids: citric, malic, and tartaric acids. The skin of the Sauvignon blanc B grape has a pH of about 4.15. It also contains between 2 and 3% tannins.

The flesh of the grape is the most important part – it is between 75 and 85% of the weight of the grape. It consists of large polygonal cells which are very thin-walled. With a low pressure the cells leak their contents: the wort. The flesh of the grape contains mainly water. The organic components are fermentable sugars (between 170-230 grams for a dry wine and between 200 and 300 grams per litre or even more for Fortified wines) and organic acids, especially malic acid and tartaric acid. Acids occur in larger amounts in the centre of the berry while the sugars are in greater proportion at the periphery. This heterogeneity in the distribution of sugars, acids, and inorganic compounds in the berry is used during pressing, especially in Champagne pressing. This process separates them as it happens and uses them to measure the progress of the &quot;vintage&quot;, the first and second &quot;tailles&quot;, and finally the &quot;rebêches&quot; of insufficient quality to be made into AOC wine.

The flesh is the major element of the wine, as it is the part that contains the highest proportion of liquid. The flavours are much less present than in the skin.

=== The wort ===
In the case of white winemaking, the wort is simply the grape juice from the pressing of grape berries.

==== The sugars ====
Sugars are carbohydrates derived from photosynthesis. The sucrose is made in the leaves and flows into the plant, where it is broken down into glucose and fructose and accumulates in the berry, where it is a characteristic of the maturation of the grapes. Many different sugars coexist: the most common are glucose and fructose which will be consumed by anaerobic yeast to convert it to alcohol during fermentation. They are in substantially equal amounts. To verify the completion of the fermentation they can be quantified by chemical assay (glucose and fructose are &quot;reducing&quot; sugars that react with an alkaline copper solution called Fehling&#x27;s solution), an enzymatic method, or by infrared spectroscopy.

Other sugars are not fermentable at all. After consumption by the yeast, the ratio of non-fermentable sugars (the ones that are not consumed by yeast: arabinose and xylose) is between 0.5 and 1.7 grams per litre. Sugars exercise a control over the taste – they balance the spiciness of the acidity and the burning of the alcohol.

==== The organic acids ====
The organic acids are mainly malic and tartaric acids. Tartaric acid is a characteristic of grapes; in its leaves, its content ranges from 5 to 7 grams per litre. Malic acid is present in green grapes, and its ratio decreases with maturation to give between 2 and 7 grams per litre at harvest. The range is very wide depending on the variety and soil with hot climates giving lower rates as the heat accelerates its degradation. There are many other acids in small quantities: citric acid, ascorbic acid, α-ketoglutaric, fumaric acid, galacturonic acid, coumaric acid, etc. Their variable quantity varies the pH of the wort. The must of white wine is generally more acidic than red grape must simply because the grape maturity is less advanced.

==== Vitamins ====
Vitamin C (or ascorbic acid) is present in the grape and the must up to 50 milligrams per litre. It is a protection in the wort against the oxidation phenomenon. In the presence of oxygen it produces hydrogen peroxide; by this reaction it deprives the enzymes in the wort of oxygen that is necessary to oxidize the wine. Since 1962 the addition of vitamin C in the wine has been allowed to a maximum of 15 grams per hectolitre at the time of packaging to stabilize the wine. Experiments in the late 2000s tried to determine a method to add it to fresh harvests or in the wort.

Vitamin B1 or thiamine is present at a concentration between 0.2 and 0.5 milligrams per litre. This vitamin is necessary for the proper growth of yeasts that ensure alcoholic fermentation. In the must of healthy grapes, the natural quantity is sufficient for the yeast. On the other hand, for a degraded harvest (by gray mold), the degradation of this vitamin leads the winemaker to add it to the must to ensure a trouble-free fermentation. In the case of a harvest with a very clear wort and low temperature the yeast works in a limited way and the addition of thiamine can help avoid a difficult end of fermentation. Legislation limits the amount added to 30 milligrams per hectolitre.

==== The mineral elements ====
The wort also contains minerals. Sodium, Potassium, and Magnesium are most common. Potassium and also calcium can form salts with the tartaric acid: Potassium bitartrate and the neutral calcium tartrate at the pH of the wine. For these, when their solubility threshold is reached, they settle and contribute to de-acidify the wort. In the southern regions where acidity is sometimes a little lacking this may be a cause of failure of extra acidity.

== Winemaking ==
White winemaking is broadly similar to red winemaking although details differ when making the two types.

White wine is made from white or black grapes (but always with white flesh; the grapes with coloured flesh are called &quot;Teinturier&quot;, meaning coloured juice). Once harvested, the grapes are pressed, and only the juice, called wort, is extracted. The wort is put into tanks for fermentation where sugar is transformed into alcohol by yeast present on the grapes.

=== The grape harvest ===
Grape maturity depends on the requirement of the final product. For a sweet white wine, whether fortified or natural, sugar is the key criterion. For a dry white wine, technological maturity is calculated and the fruit is harvested just before (usually eight days) the maturity of the sugar. At this point the relationship between sugar and acid is optimal. Further, low acidity will cause the future wine to be unbalanced with excess alcohol and lack of liveliness. In addition, the flavour will be less fresh and less vivid.

Traditional hand harvesting of whole bunches has been increasingly challenged by the harvesting machine for dry white wines, an economic choice but not always a qualitative one. The fragility of the grape requires either a rapid transfer to the winery or protection from oxidation. When the transport time between vine and winery is long, the harvest can be refrigerated and kept away from oxygen using nitrogen or dry ice.

However, for some sweet wines, a successful harvest requires manual work and training for pickers to pick only clusters where the berries have reached optimum ripeness or have been affected by noble rot (for the &quot;Sélection de Grains Nobles&quot;). Handpicking is recommended for sparkling wines and absolutely necessary for white wines from grapes with coloured skin.

=== Treatments before fermentation ===
The first step in processing the grapes at the winery is to separate the components of the wort that are needed from the unwanted parts. The process followed at this stage will largely determine the future quality of the wine. For this, the clusters are generally shaken then trampled. The practice of moderate trampling allows the grains to burst, releasing the juice and pulp (it cannot be used for white wine from black grapes because the premature bursting of the berries would cause a coloured must). The practice of shaking or stalking has the advantage of separating the stems from the cluster of grapes and avoids giving the wine an herbaceous taste at pressing. The skin is not macerated and the transparent yellow colour is retained.

The winemaker can soak the skins of white grapes and practice maceration if the quality of the grapes is good. Pre-fermentation Maceration is generally performed at a controlled temperature to delay the onset of fermentation. This technique improves the extraction of varietal aromas and their precursors which are mainly located in the skin. Acidity decreases as does the ratio of Colloids (large pectin type molecules) and aging potential. To be implemented, this process requires a perfect de-stalking, moderate crushing and sulphite to protect the wort from oxidation. The duration (typically 5 to 18 hours at ) depends on the variety, the temperature of maceration, the maturity of the grape, and the quality of the soil.

The trampled and de-stemmed harvest is then pressed. The type of wine press also affects the potential quality of the wine. Since the 1980s, pneumatic presses have improved the work involved by working in airtight conditions and allowing a fine control of the pressure to extract the juice without damaging the grapes. The juice or &quot;moût de goutte&quot; (Must of Drops) is the juice that flows naturally from the berries crushed under their own weight prior to pressing (on the way to the press). Trampling increases its proportion and makes the material profitable by processing a higher tonnage of grapes at the same time. The &quot;moût de presse&quot; (&quot;must of the press&quot;) is the juice flowing from the press from the pressure on the grapes. It concentrates the grape&#x27;s qualities or defects: It is rich in aromas, colloids, or phenolic compounds. However, it can also be marked by olfactory defects, such as the smell of fungus on spoiled grapes or the vegetable smell of a harvest with insufficient maturity. The blending or not of the &quot;moût de goutte&quot; and the &quot;moût de presse&quot; musts and release depends on the health of the grapes, the method of pressing, and the style of wine intended. Manipulation of the grape before pressing increases the amount of lees and complicates pressing. For the development of a quality wine, their use is excluded or very limited.

=== The settling ===
The settling is intended to clarify the wort by removing the lees from it. The lees are colloids in suspension, debris from the skins or pulp, and exogenous debris (soil).

Static settling consists of leaving the must to let the debris settle: after pressing, the must is left to stand in a tank away from air. Suspended particles precipitate to the bottom of the tank. This is facilitated by the addition of pectolytic enzymes which are long chain carbons composed of pectic compounds. These pectins give a high viscosity to the juice, cut the suspended particles into shorter chains, and accelerate precipitation. Refrigeration of the wort is needed: if the fermentation starts, the release of bubbles of carbon dioxide would spread suspended particles throughout the wort preventing their deposition. After the wort is clarified it is decanted for fermenting.

Dynamic settling is performed with a machine that accelerates the separation of the wort from the lees. The centrifuge removes the largest particles but does not achieve a high level of clarity.

Settling by flotation is a technique where the introduction of a gas at the bottom of the tank creates bubbles which cause the particles to rise to the surface where they are removed by a scraper. Filtration with a rotary vacuum filter is relatively slow but effective. It is often used to recover clear wort in the lees exiting the centrifuge.

In addition enzyme treatment can improve the settling of the Finings. Bentonite plays a mechanical role of ballast to settle the colloids – it accelerates the sedimentation rate. Gelatin is also used to flocculate the suspended tannins extracted by the press. Often associated with a bitter taste, their removal is generally beneficial for white wine. Polyvinylpolypyrrolidone or &quot;PVPP&quot; allows the fixing of polyphenols and eliminating them. These molecules are responsible for the browning of wine and their removal gives an element of stability in the future drink.

In the &quot;stabilisation of lees&quot; (liquid cold stabilization) the winemaker regularly adds lees in suspension for several days so they do not settle immediately. Then he proceeds to a conventional settling as indicated above. This technique allows the enrichment of the wort with precursors of &quot;thiol&quot; (passion fruit, citrus ...) which are naturally very soluble in the wort and are particularly suitable for some varieties such as Sauvignon and Colombard. In the &quot;maceration of lees&quot;, the lees from the static settling are gathered in a refrigerated tank and agitated for several days. After filtration and fermentation they give a white wine also rich in thiols.

=== The making of the wine ===
The wort is then placed in a tank to undergo fermentation. These fermentation tanks can be of several types: oak, cement coated with epoxy, stainless or enamelled steel, or epoxy resin. For large volume tanks the control of temperature, which typically is around 18 °C, becomes necessary. The majority of aromatic components (acetates of alcohol and ethyl esters of fatty acids) are synthesized by the yeast during fermentation of light juice below 18 °C. However, clarity and low temperatures are factors which slow fermentation. Recourse to the addition of selected yeasts for these difficult working conditions becomes crucial. In contrast some producers grow their vines organically or biodynamically: the lees are of good quality without synthetic chemicals harmful to yeast so they are kept in the wine. Turbidity of the must ensures a good supply of yeasts and fermentation in small tanks or in barrels then does not require mastery of cold.

Fermentation starts spontaneously under the action of the natural yeasts from the grapes. The winemaker can choose to use a commercially available active dry yeast. It can help to express the characteristics of a variety or a method of manufacture. For a dry white wine fermentation continues until the sugar runs out. The wine is then usually decanted to eliminate the lees. When fermentation is done in barrels the temperature often exceeds 20 °C or even 25 °C.

After the end of fermentation, the wine may also have malolactic fermentation or FML. This second fermentation carried out by bacteria deacidifies the wine: it transforms the malic acid, which has two carboxyl groups, into lactic acid. This operation, which reduces the biting acidity of the wine, is not always desirable nor practiced. In southern areas the acidity is carefully preserved to give the wine its liveliness for refreshing aroma of wine. During the fermentation of the grapes, varietal aromas are reduced in favour of an increase in roundness and volume in the mouth of the wine during ageing in oak barrels. It gives a better biological stability in champagne wines.

For a sweet wine, fermentation is stopped before its end to keep some of the sugar: this is the &quot;Mutage&quot; (fortification). The fermentation can be stopped by adding sulphur dioxide (SO2) (sterilisation of wine), by sudden cooling (anaesthesia of yeasts), by sterile filtration (capturing the yeasts in a very fine mesh filter), or a combination of several of these methods. A rule of thumb for determining the point of &quot;mutage&quot;, which allows a good balance of acquired alcohol and residual sugar, is to leave as many potential degrees as the degrees acquired over 10% by volume. For sweeter dessert wines fermentation stops spontaneously by excess sugar and alcohol: Alcohol is waste from the yeast and it is poisonous in large doses. In the case of sweet wines an addition of wine alcohol stops the fermentation. FML is not done for sweet wines as the lactic bacteria preferentially degrades sugar which would give a lactic bite (sweet and sour wine). In addition, the balance of acidity and sugar in the wine supports vivacity.

A winemaking technique called &quot;reducing&quot; or &quot;technology&quot; has been developed. Very fashionable in Australia and New Zealand, this technique seeks highly aromatic white wines and is very interesting on aromatic varieties such as Sauvignon B, Colombard B, and Riesling B, although less so for varieties such as Chardonnay B. It works by limiting premature oxidation in the must or the wine at all stages of development. The use of inert gases such as carbon dioxide (CO2) isolates the grapes from oxygen from the air, and cold partially inhibits the action of oxidative enzymes in the must. Tyrosinase, a natural enzyme in the grape, and laccase, an enzyme coming from the &quot;gray mold&quot;, are very active in oxidation. Laccase can be eliminated by sorting the grapes. Strong limitation on the amount of polyphenols in the wine by reducing the time between harvest and pressing is another technique that aims to make a very light wine, protected from yellowing.

== Preparation of wine before packaging ==


After fermentation all wine requires constant care to be fit for consumption. All of these practices before bottling are known as &quot;élevage&quot; or Maturing.

=== Maturing ===
Maturing can be done in a vat. It takes little time to clarify and to prepare the packaging (bottling or Bag-In-Box) but this may be extended by maturing of lees. This type of maturing consists of regularly adding fine lees in suspension in the wine. The dead yeast is used for the fine lees which digests itself (autolysis) giving the wine volume and body to support the fruitiness. This operation is called &quot;Bâtonnage&quot; or stirring and is traditionally done with a stick to agitate the lees at the bottom of the barrel. This technique needs to be well controlled, however, otherwise the wine may take on a &quot;Goût de réduit&quot; (Reduced taste) due to the activity of reductase sulphite from the yeast. This operation can be done in vats, as in Muscadet, barrels as in Burgundy and many chardonnays, or bottles as in champagne.

Maturing can also be done in barrels. The wine is put in barrels after fermentation but fermentation itself may also occur in the barrel. The barrel has a dual role: it flavours the wine giving it a scent of toast, butter, and vanilla but it also helps to mature it by providing a very small regular quantity of oxygen through the wooden walls. This oxygen helps to polymerize the components of the wine making it less aggressive and more balanced.

=== Blending ===
The blending consists of mixing different wines in order to obtain the desired final blend. This assembly can be of varietals (in the case of Bordeaux wines or wines from the Languedoc-Roussillon), or blending of a vintage with varieties (in the case of champagne).

This blending may be purely quantitative: various vintages can be blended to achieve the desired volume. It can also be qualitative; the taster or a team of tasters (cellar master, winemaker, owner of the estate, etc.) determine the amount of each wine to mix together in the final blend to obtain optimum quality. In winemaking blending is always empirical, it cannot be predicted that the combination of two or more vintages will give the expected product. The only secure values are analytical values (alcoholic strength, acidity, pH, etc.).

=== Clarification ===
Clarification consists of removing insoluble particles in suspension in the water-alcohol solution that is the wine and stabilization is to maintain the solubility of the elements dissolved in the wine throughout the retention period in the bottle and consumption at the table.

To clarify wine, it is necessary to wait for particle deposition at the bottom of the wine container but this can be accelerated by the use of oenological adhesives. These additives bind to the insoluble particles and fall to the bottom.

Tannic acid (or gallotannic) C76-H52-O46 is used for the clarification of white wine, using casein, gelatin, or Isinglass.

=== Stabilisation ===
The majority of wine components are dissolved in the wine: certain components, however, may take an insoluble form during ageing or storage of wine – this is the case with tartaric acid. A salt containing potassium, potassium bitartrate is in the form of crystals at the bottom of the bottle. This is a natural phenomenon but many producers seek to avoid this as dealers and uninformed consumers take these crystals as a fault. It is caused or accelerated by cold storage: low temperature reduces its solubility. The habit of refreshing white wine makes this wine particularly sensitive to this phenomenon.

Several solutions are available to stabilize the wine:

The first is to cool the wine to a negative temperature near freezing for several weeks. The potassium bitartrate crystals precipitate and can be removed by filtration prior to packaging in bottles or bag-in-boxes. This solution is costly in refrigeration energy and can negatively affect the organoleptic qualities of the wine.

Another solution is to introduce Metatartaric acid, a tartaric acid polymer, into the wine. Its mode of action is still unknown but it prevents microscopic crystals from growing. However, the effect is not sustainable in the long term (between 6 and 18 months) because it hydrolyzes when warm.

A third way is electrodialysis: an electric current between two plates attracts the wine ions and eliminates them. However, this solution not only acts on tartaric acid but also other compounds especially potassium which is responsible for the formation of insoluble bitartrate and also modifies the organoleptic qualities. However, it does allow a definitive stabilization. Reports of high tartaric stability in white wines matured on lees has led to research in this area. A protein from the hydrolyzate of the yeast (mannoproteins) allows salts of tartar to keep their solubility. The addition of this compound industrially permits a good quality stabilization. This solution is the least expensive for energy and refrigeration equipment and does not alter the aromatic perception of wine. Nevertheless, tests conducted by the Cooperative Institute for Wine of Languedoc-Roussillon did not show conclusive effectiveness.

Finally the study of the addition of cellulose gum or carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) conducted in recent years led to its approval in 2009 (EC Regulation 606/2009).

Some producers who sell their own products directly to the consumer, explain these natural phenomena to the customer who then serve the wine gently in order to prevent the crystals forming in the bottom of the bottle.

The presence of unstable proteins that can create a visual problem (protein breakdown) in the wine also requires stabilization. Treatment with bentonite allows the precipitation of unstable proteins which can then be removed by filtration and extraction. The proteins can also react with Metatartaric acid added to wine to prevent tartaric precipitation: the wine then loses its shine and becomes opalescent like whey. Some varieties are naturally high in protein (muscat. ..) but levels also vary depending on the vintage and maturity levels.

Finally some white wines can be victims of &quot;Rosissement&quot; (pinking). This phenomenon manifests itself in a light rosé colouration of the wine and takes the appearance of a &quot;stained&quot; wine or one that is contaminated by the presence of anthocyanins from red wine. Yet this is not so: the phenomenon is due to the presence of a normally colourless dissolved polyphenol which turns pink due to oxidation. An infusion of PVPP generally eliminates the substrate of oxidation. Some varieties are particularly sensitive to pinking: Sauvignon B, Viognier, Grenache B...

=== Use of SO2 ===
SO2, sulphur dioxide or dioxide of sulphur is used in all winemaking operations from harvesting to packaging. It plays a protective role in the wine against the phenomena of oxidation, oxidase enzyme action (enzymes that oxidize the polyphenols in wine), and the control of microbial populations in yeasts and bacteria (antiseptic effect).

The maximum allowable doses depend on the sugar content of the wine: the residual sugar is susceptible to attack by microorganisms which would cause a restart of fermentation. In France the dose is limited to 150 mg/litre for Vin de Pays (country wines), 185 mg/L for Sparkling wines, 200 mg/L for Fortified wines, 200 mg/L for dry white wines, 250 mg/L for white wines with residual sugar greater than 5 g/litre (Moelleux wines), and 300 mg/L for liquoreux sweet wines.

=== Filtration and conditioning ===
For sale to individuals or restaurants the wine is filtered if necessary, then conditioned. The filtration consists of passing the wine through a filter element for retaining fine particles suspended in the wine. It may be fine earth (Kieselguhr), cardboard sheets, membranes, or Cross-flow filtration.

Packaging wine has historically varied. In one early method, wine merchants kept their stock in barrels or casks and the client would fill their pitcher or bottle. Glass bottles revolutionized the wine industry. The absence of transfer and thus contact with the oxygen in the air has made a significant improvement to the quality of the product. Other containers have emerged: aluminum cans, Tetra Pak cartons, plastic bottles, and the bag-in-box. Their quality is in their chemical inertness in relation to wine and their hermetic character against oxygen.

The wine bottle has been given certain shapes dedicated to wine. The most emblematic is the bottle of sparkling wine: because of the pressure inside it is a fairly thick glass. Many countries have adopted this shape for bottles of white wine – a more streamlined form than red wine bottles.

== Wine tasting ==

=== Colour ===
The colour of white wine is as varied as the types of wines. The term most commonly cited is yellow. However, the richness of vocabulary leaves free space for visual analysis between the actual colour and the hue (the range of colour is often different at the joint between the wine and the glass).

At the end of the 20th century the components of the wine which made the colour were still not clearly identified. Over the ages, the &quot;flavones&quot; in the grapes were considered responsible for the yellow colour, but their very low dissolution in wine, due to short maceration, led to a search for other molecules. A thesis by Biau in 1995 alluded to the influence of polysaccharides, proteins, and some phenolic acids.

Léglise specified that: &quot;the term &quot;gold&quot; is used if the appearance is very bright and full of reflections, in the definition of the various nuances specific to the metal (...) If, with proper clarity, the wine does not shed light and does not radiate reflection, we will give only the term yellow&quot;. On a colour scale white wine can be almost colourless white. When young it usually takes on a pale greenish or pale yellow tint. Its yellow colour darkens with age and maturing becoming gold, then copper, and finally amber. One of the darkest wines in the world is achieved with a white grape: the &quot;Pedro Ximenez&quot;. The ratio of sugar also affects the colour of the wine, making the colour more sustained, depending on the nature of the grape varietal: A Bordeaux Sauvignon blanc or a Muscadet Melon have a greenish tint while Chardonnay or Traminer grown and vinified under comparable conditions will be yellow.

=== Aromas ===
The aromas from white wine cover almost the whole palette of wine aromas.

The fruity aromas include citrus fruit such as lemon and grapefruit, white fruit such as apple, quince, peach and apricot, and nuts such as walnut and hazelnut. Exotic fruits are also present: pineapple, mango, and lychee. Obviously the aromatic palette includes these cooked flavours: apple, jam, candied fruit, etc. White wines may also convey floral aromas of acacia, honeysuckle, verbena, violet, etc.. (Scents of honey can also be assimilated).

Ageing also brings other flavours to the wine. Barrel ageing creates scents of vanilla, butter, brioche, toast, caramel, etc. The long maturing wines like yellow wine or sherry have typical aromas of fresh walnuts, almonds, and hazelnuts.

Finally the soil can impart a flavour characteristic of a region. Thus, the mineral aromas of flint (odour of flint or of light stone) well expressed in Chardonnay B and sauvignon B, and the scent of oil is typical of old Alsatian Rieslings B.

Same aromas that may be thought to be confined to red wines are found in white wines. This is the case especially in some white champagne wines partly made from black grapes and reminiscent of red fruit (strawberry, raspberry, blueberry, gooseberry, etc.).

=== Taste ===
When placed in the mouth white wine has a balance different from red wine from which the tannic structure is removed. The balance is no longer based only on alcohol and acidity: this is the factor that explains the difficulty of making a white wine.

For sweet and fortified white wines the presence of sugar adds a parameter to balance the alcohol and acidity.

Maturing in the barrel gives wine a wooded touch and tannins from the oak give it structure. The strongest wines, as in some grand crus of Sauternes (Château d&#x27;Yquem for example) even support ageing in new wood.

=== Glasses for white wine ===
Ever since glass containers have existed, specialised glasses for each type of wine were created. Many glasses specific to white wine exist in many wine-producing regions. The glass must be perfectly clear and colourless to properly appreciate the colour of the wine. However, designers and manufacturers of tableware have created white wine glasses with green or blue feet. These colours flatter the wine – they give an artificial colour in the shade (a reflection barrier which emphasizes the separation between the glass and the wine) – rejuvenating the perceived impression.

Sparkling wines are served in particular glasses such as the flute and the coupe. The flute is the preferred glass for professional tasters: the shape concentrates the aromas to the nose of the taster and its height allows appreciation of the fine bubbles that rise to the surface. The coupe is not recommended because of its too flared shape: it does not preserve the layer of foam, and the gas and aromas escape too fast. According to legend, this type of glass was developed based on the shape of the Breast of the Marquise de Pompadour. The coupe dates from a time when the wines were mostly sweeter and less aromatic. Since the 1930s and with the habit to consume drier sparkling wines, the flute has taken the place of the coupe. The coupe is also used in mixtures which have an olive in a bubbly cocktail and in the spectacular pyramids of glasses that crown festivities.

Besides this range of glasses, the work of a team of tasters, including Jules Chauvet of the INAO in France, led to the creation in 1970 of the &quot;INAO glass&quot;. This glass has a thin glass wall and curve calculated to be able to taste all wines. This glass is used, among others, during the approval tastings – the gateway for the wines to be entitled to bear the name of an appellation d&#x27;origine contrôlée (AOC). This simple but elegant glass can also be used to serve wine at the table.

== Types ==

=== Dry white wine ===
The dry white wine is a wine without sugar (the sugar ratio is generally less than 4 grams per litre). It is a wine very difficult to develop because the balance of the wine is based on only two parameters: acidity and alcohol.

Before the 1950s, the traditional European wine was made in small containers where the temperature did not rise high enough to interfere with the fermentation but this method of vinification gave wine structure and roundness but was not aromatic. In California and Australia, the need to cool the grapes and wine during fermentation led winemakers to equip their cellars with adequate equipment: refrigeration units, circuits of pipes to carry the liquid refrigerant, and vats temperature-regulated by coils in the walls of the vessel or flag (a thin welded coil shaped like a flat plate with a high heat exchange capability). This mode of production happened in Europe at the same time as new techniques of treatment of the must (accelerated settling, use of selected yeasts, addition of glues and yeast enzymes, the practice of maceration). In wine jargon, all of these practices give a &quot;technological wine&quot;. This is very fragrant, crisp on the palate, and does not require ageing. The &quot;old&quot; type of European white wines were well suited to this type of wine – it was the Sauvignon B grape varietal that was first used in this manner, which allowed it to be blended with Semillon B. There has also been a decrease in growing areas in the last thirty years. In Burgundy these practices may face the phenomenon of premature oxidation. Chardonnay is the archetype of the great wine that can be produced with old-fashioned methods.

The photo below compares the colours of two Chenins B and illustrates the visual difference between a South African &quot;technologic&quot; wine and a &quot;classic&quot; French wine from the Loire Valley.

=== Sweet and fortified white wine ===
There is a wide variety of sweet wines, from slightly sweet all the way to Fortified wine with the consistency of syrup.

The origin of the sugar is from the grape. The fermentation is stopped before it ends, although the practice of chaptalization has changed the practice in certain wine regions. Many techniques exist to concentrate the sugar:
* &quot;Passerillage with straining&quot; or &quot;late harvest&quot; consists of leaving the grapes on the vine to concentrate the sun. The sugar no longer builds up once reaching maturity but the water evaporates which lowers the yield but increases the concentration of sugar. This is the oldest and most common method. It can be improved by plucking the stems: the winemaker prevents sap reaching the cluster and so it dries faster. The annular incision, long practiced, involves removing a ring of bark on the branch below the clusters. The sweet sap cannot descend and is concentrated in the grapes, while the sap continues to feed the upper branch. Another quick method is to cut a portion of the stem. The grape is dried upstream, but the downstream section progresses normally. The blending in the vat or the press of two types of grapes improves the final result.
* &quot;Passerillage without straining&quot; is a practice of concentrating the grapes before pressing. The grapes are hung in an attic or on trays for the time it takes for some of the water they contain to evaporate. This method is the raw material of straw wine
* &quot;noble rot&quot; is a method of concentration depending on climatic conditions. The Botrytis cinerea creates microscopic perforations of the grape skin through which water is allowed to evaporate while maintaining the other components. The action of botrytis induces different flavours in the grape related to chemical reactions in the berry. The precocity of the varietal-land and low vigour of the vine are favourable to the action of noble rot and helps prevent gray rot. This type of grape is used for the production of Hungarian Tokaji, fortified wines of Aquitaine (Sauternes, Barsac, Loupiac, Monbazillac, etc.), and some selections of noble rot berries in Alsace and Germany: Trockenbeerenauslese.
* &quot;Freezing of grapes&quot; and cold pressing are used to squeeze the liquid part of the berries. The flakes of frozen water remain in the press and only the sweet juice flows. This is the principle of ice wine. Cryoextraction is a recent technique invented to reproduce the phenomenon in regions that are not cold enough: The grapes are artificially frozen before being pressed. This method overcomes the climate, and harvesting work can continue without waiting for the frosts (risk of loss of the grapes by weather accident or attack by hungry sparrows), but shortening the maturation does not give the same flavour.

=== Sparkling wine ===
Festive Wines par excellence is the prestigious image conveyed by champagne but sparkling wine can come from very different practices. In contrast to sparkling wines, wines without foam are called &quot;still wines&quot;.

Sparkling wine is mostly white and contains fermentation gases (carbon dioxide). The first sparkling wine dates back to the very first winemaking. During alcoholic fermentation of all wines yeast produces carbon dioxide so during fermentation all wines are sparkling. For most of them the gas escapes and does not remain dissolved. Methods of production of sparkling wines are therefore intended to maintain the CO2 dissolved in the wine which is responsible for the bubbles:
* the traditional method which was once called méthode champenoise consists of vinifying white or rosé wine as for a still wine. A &quot;liqueur de tirage&quot; (sugar) is then added to the wine and bottled. A second fermentation then occurs in the bottle from yeast and the sugar from the liqueur de tirage. The wine is then &quot; dégorgé&quot; or disgorged and a &quot;liqueur de dosage&quot; or mix (liquor more or less sweet depending on the desired final product: brut, demi-sec, or doux).
* the rural method or craft method for a wine in which the fermentation was stopped by cold (in the past it was the arrival of winter blocking fermentation). The remaining sugar finishes fermenting in the bottle, producing dissolved gas. This is the method developed by the producers of Gaillac AOC and Blanquette de Limoux
* the transfer method uses the traditional method but after fermentation the bottles are uncorked and the wine is blended in a closed pressure vessel. It is filtered before being returned to the bottle
* the Dioise method: after fermentation using the standard rural method, the wine is filtered in a vat similar to the transfer method
* the closed vat method: the second fermentation takes place in closed vats. The wine is filtered then bottled under pressure
* the continuous method or Russian method: the wine passes from one closed vat to another. Previously the yeasts were fixed with oak chips. After filtration the wine is bottled under pressure
* the method by gasification: a &quot;liqueur de dosage&quot; is added to the wine then carbon dioxide is injected into the vat. The wine is bottled under pressure. This is the method of production for flavoured sparkling wines.

Made famous by the champagne used to christen large ships at launch, sparkling white wine is produced in almost all wine-producing countries and has become a benchmark for providing a festive and commemorative spirit to an event. This unique side is found in the labelling of the bottle. Firstly the gas pressure requires a heavier bottle, then the plug with its mushroom shape must be retained by a Muselet, and finally the top of the bottle is covered with a metallic foil shell gold or silver coloured.

=== Fortified wine ===

A fortified wine is a wine in which there has been an addition of alcohol. This category includes three types of wine products depending on the fermentation stage where the fortification took place:
* The &quot;mistelles&quot; or dessert wines are grape juices whose fermentation has been prevented by fortification with alcohol. Although the absence of fermentation can lead to discussion of their qualification as wine, it is nevertheless an alcoholic grape product. The Pineau des Charentes, the floc de Gascogne, and the macvin du Jura are three AOC French mistelles.
* The &quot;Vin doux naturel&quot; or sweet wines are wines where fermentation was stopped before completion. The added alcohol retains the grape sugar and guarantees its smooth taste. The majority of muscat wines fall into this category (Muscat de Beaumes-de-Venise, Muscat de Rivesaltes, Muscat de Mireval, Moscatell Catalan, Moscato d&#x27;Asti etc.) as do white port, and Madeira.
* The &quot;vins mutés secs&quot; or dry fortified wines are dry wines (without sugar) whose fermentation was completed. A quantity of alcohol is added to increase their alcohol content. They age for a long time giving wines with the ability to be kept for a very long time. These wines are the sherries and some dry white ports.

== Culinary aspects ==
The temperature of service is a criterion to put wine in the best condition for drinking. The wine must be chilled but not be served with ice. Between 8 and 9 °C, the chill will accentuate the liveliness of the bubbles and reduce the sweetness of a sweet or Fortified wine. For an aromatic dry wine service between 10 and 12 °C stimulates vivacity and gives freshness to the flavours. Finally, the great white wines are best at a temperature between 12 and 14 °C which allows the flavours and the structure to be revealed.

=== Pairing white wine and food ===
The acidity of dry white wine is reduced by slightly salty or sweet dishes while the wine accentuates the salty side of food and tempers heavy fatty foods. Sweet wine goes well with sweet and savoury dishes to mitigate the heavy sugar and stimulate the fruitiness.

For an aperitif, flavoured dry wine or sparkling wine goes with all meals. Specialists in tasting consider that the sugar or alcohol in some wines has a saturating effect on the taste buds, by contrast the fruity liveliness awakens them to the meal to come.
At mealtimes very dry wines with little minerals are recommended with oysters and seafood: their acidity reveals the salinity of the shellfish. The most fragrant wines go well with shellfish, fish, or poached white meat. For stews the acidity of white wine counterbalances the weight of fat. If the sauce is well balanced with an intense ingredient (lemon juice or mustard) a more opulent wine can be recommended: sweet or dry wine aged in barrels. Sweet wines, either just sweet or fortified, are a good option for exotic dishes with sweet spices (dishes with cinnamon, vanilla etc.). Fortified white wines are recommended with foie gras. Sparkling wines can be taken at any time during the meal, their diversity allows this. A choice of sparkling wine also allows the retention of the same wine from the beginning to the end of the meal.

Gourmets generally prefer white wine to red to accompany cheese as its acidity agrees well with the fat in dairy products. Dry wines with mineral aromas such as chardonnay or sauvignon blanc bring out the milky taste of goat cheese. Aromatic wines, such as Gewurztraminer and some sparkling wines support the strong taste of Washed-rind cheeses (Maroilles, Époisses, Munster, etc.). Neutral white wines (Castilla-La Mancha, Italian Trebbiano) are well suited to sheep cheese and there are also Manchego and pecorino romano for a little spicy. The cooked pressed cheeses require a bold wine, woodland. There is perfect agreement between the Comté cheese and the yellow wine of the Jura. Fortified wines are recommended with veined cheeses (Blue or Roquefort). In this case, the cheese mould (Penicillium roqueforti) and the wine (noble rot) form a harmonious whole.

White wine is also a dessert wine. All choices are allowed even if the sweet and fortified wines are more suitable for this. Perfumed wines (Gewurztraminer, Muscat), sparkling, and sweet wines accord well with fruit desserts (salad, tart). The fortified and sparkling wines support rich desserts made with cream or butter. Crèmes brûlées or caramel which combine sugar and cream can be eaten with a sweet and lively wine such as Jurançon or a late harvest wine. Chocolate requires a very powerful wine so white wine selection is quite limited: a natural amber sweet wine is the best compromise.

More than other wines, white wine is a wine that can be consumed between meals. The habits of the Anglo-Saxons and Germans require a sweet wine or a dry and fruity wine.

=== White wine as an ingredient ===
White wine is regularly used as an ingredient. Its acidity balances well with fat, taking away excess heaviness. This acidity also refines the meat or fish and it helps to break down the fibres of the meat to make it tender. The role of white wine is similar to that of lemon juice used under the same conditions: once verjuice also fulfilled this function. The vinegar combines acidity with a burning sensation that gives recipes where it is used a bittersweet side characteristic.

As a means to balance the fat, white wine is involved in the preparation of sauces such as ravigote sauce, béarnaise sauce, marinara sauce, etc. The drippings of cooking juices is also a role that white wine can be used in; made with a sweet white wine and giving a sour-sweet or sweet-salt sauce. In cheese fondue the liveliness of dry white wine is balanced with the fat of the cheese. The freshness of the wine as a table drink contrasts the heat of the fondue.

In marinades its power to soften the protein fibre is used. Sometimes it can even happen in cooking such as in Italian-style tuna carpaccio.

White wine is also used as a wetting agent for slow cooking. In this type of dish it combines the flexibility of the meat and balances the fat from the sauce. It plays this role in the case of cabbage, baeckeoffe or risotto, and in the gravy in the preparation of white meat as in osso buco or blanquette de veau (veal stew), Chicken with morels and its variants, Chicken à la comtoise and Yellow coq au vin, rabbit or with charcuterie such as diots and tripe. It can also be used to prepare fish and seafood dishes such as &quot;pôchouse&quot; with Burgundy wine, monkfish stew, Flounder stew, mussels in white wine, or a Seafood Pot-au-feu.

A common rule by gourmets is to serve at table the same wine that has been used in cooking.

=== Painted or drawn white wine ===
Since the Middle Ages white wine has inspired many painters to include it in still lifes or for the representation of the everyday life, party life, or life to excess. An abundance of English, Dutch and German paintings from the 17th century depicted a high consumption of white wine at that time replacing the consumption of beer in the aristocracy and the bourgeoisie.

White wine has also inspired designers, cartoonists, advertising etc.

Adèle Blanc-Sec, heroine of comics winked at the beverage. She also has cinematic posterity with &quot;The Extraordinary Adventures of Adèle Blanc-Sec&quot;.

=== In literature ===
A number of authors, poets, and philosophers have celebrated wine in general but the quotes are become much more rare when it comes to include colour. Authors in all eras have spoken using white wine to illustrate their point. Serious or tinged with humour white wine is present in all kinds of works, novels, poetry, and philosophy itself. The white wine most commonly cited in literature is French champagne.

François Rabelais, an angevin &quot;bon vivant&quot;, repeatedly celebrated the white wine of Anjou that he liked and it was appreciated by his literary heroes.

&quot;Jumping, dancing, touring – and drinking white wine and rose – and do nothing every day – What counts as crowns of the sun&quot; - François Rabelais

During the Enlightenment, Voltaire and Casanova celebrated wine parties, drunk at fine tables.

&quot;Every guest had at his right a bottle that could be white wine or mead. I know I drank ... of the excellent white burgundy&quot; - Casanova

&quot;From this fresh wine the sparkling foam
For our French it is a brilliant image&quot; - Voltaire

White wine is also used in humour, in a drama with Marcel Pagnol or in a gossip radio show for Pierre Desproges.

&quot;Serve me a bottle of white wine if it is fresh.
- If it is fresh? Touch me there! Looks like it comes from the vineyards of the North Pole!&quot; - Marcel Pagnol

&quot;In June at the fish market, one does not loiter anymore: one strolls. Behind the port, the cherry tomato is nowhere to be seen at the farmers market stall. One munches them with salt on the sand with a basil branch and a glass of Brem iced white wine&quot; - Pierre Desproges

Michel Onfray has written a book based on the Sauternes. Partly on wine and its land, its philosophical reflection outweighs the viticultural theme.

=== In song ===
White wine celebrated by poets was sometimes set to music. The most famous white wine in relation to a song is probably: &quot;Ah! the white wine&quot; by Jean Dréjac and Charles Borel-Clerc.

&quot;A touch of champagne&quot; is a song by Harry Fragson written about 1890.

&quot;I am Drunk&quot;, sung by Louis Byrec and written by Yvette Guilbert in 1895 gave the best part to knowledge of sparkling wines:

&quot;I come to the wedding of my sister Annette
And, when the champagne is flowing,
I could not hold you, I am tipsy,
and I pinched my little tuft.
I feel flageoler I feel my legsM
I have the heart guil&#x27;ret, the pleasing air
I am ready to cavort
When I drank Moet et Chandon&quot;.

Even some varieties are mentioned in song such as the song entitled &quot;Sauvignon&quot; by Hubert Lapaire in 1926:

&quot;I dounn&#x27;rais the burgundy vou the Burgundian
And all your sacred champagne wines
for a little keg of sauvignon
Who gilds the cotiau of nout campaign
It is v&#x27;louteux it is blondin
It is of the little wine franch&#x27;ment kind ...
If bin before St. Martin J&#x27;mettrons the throat under the champ&#x27;lure&quot;

Closer to home Boris Vian celebrated &quot;Muscadet in green glasses, a fresh wine, What cheers&quot; in his song &quot;Mechanical Music&quot;. Jacques Higelin wrote the song &quot;Champagne&quot; on his album &quot;Champagne for everyone&quot;:

&quot;Seek me without delay the friend who treats and cures the madness with me and has never betrayed me. Champagne!!&quot;

=== Proverbs ===
The consumption of white wine is also mentioned in proverbs:
* &quot;White then red, nothing moves, red then white, all bugger off&quot; It means that drinking white wine after a few glasses of good red wine inevitably some physical discomfort of

&quot;In the morning, drink the white wine. Red in the evening for blood&quot; is a bourguignon proverb.

== Health effects ==
Because of its shorter maceration, white wine contains very little tannin and therefore little antioxidants that make red wine so interesting medically speaking. However, a team of researchers from Montpellier has developed a white wine enriched with polyphenols.

The sulphur dioxide additive commonly used in wine is not harmful in the amounts used but its effects are feared among asthmatics: it can cause the onset of a crisis (Difficulty breathing). Symptoms such as difficulty breathing, migraine, or stomach heat sensation may indicate an intolerance. A reaction caused by a deficiency of sulphite oxidase (the enzyme that breaks down Sulphur Dioxide) is very rare. Studies are underway to investigate whether some of the symptoms attributed to Sulphur Dioxide could not come from another molecule present in the wine.

White wine is an acidic beverage with a pH ranging from 2.8 to 3.6. This acidity is an aggressive element to tooth enamel.

In addition it contains alcohol which is expressed in degrees or percentage. This alcohol can be responsible for cirrhosis. This disease can occur from a regular consumption of 20 grams per day for women and 40 grams per day for men. However, some studies in California may indicate beneficial effect of wine at a low daily dose for non-alcoholic cirrhosis.

In recent studies white wine was indicated to have some cardiovascular benefits. As well, white wine contains antioxidants, although red wine contains higher levels of antioxidants. Both white and red wines are effective in preventing LDL oxidation.

== Price ==
Having been lost in a shipwreck, a case of 1907 Heidsieck was discovered in 1997. At auction each bottle made $275,000 making them the most expensive bottles of white wine ever sold.

<doc id="927696" wikidata="Q511686" url="?curid=927696" title="Nubian pyramids">
<text>The Nubian pyramids were constructed by the rulers of the ancient Kushite kingdoms in the region of the Nile Valley known as Nubia, located in present-day northern Sudan. This area was the site of three ancient Kushite kingdoms. The capital of the first was at Kerma (2500–1500 BC), the second was centered on Napata (1000–300 BC) and the third was centered on Meroë (300 BC – 300 AD).

In Nubian culture, the pyramids were integral to burial customs for royalty and other wealthy figures of the Kushite kingdom, with this practice starting as early as the 7th century BC. These customs endured for almost a thousand years from 700 BC to 350 AD. The Nubian pyramids display adaptations of Egyptian architecture that were prevalent during the New Kingdom. Notably these are a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

==Chronology and organization of Nubian burial sites==
The Nubian pyramids were built over a period of a few hundred years to serve as tombs for the kings and queens and wealthy citizens of Napata and Meroë. The four main sites in which these pyramids hold prominence are El-Kurru, Nuri, Jebel Barkal, and Meroe. The first three sites are located around Napata in Lower Nubia, near the modern town of Karima.

The earliest pyramids in El Kurru were constructed in 751 BC, which formed the center of the Empire of Kush during the Napatan period, ca. 850-300 BC. It is recognized as the origin of the tombs belonging to the rulers of Egypt and Nubia&#x27;s 25th Dynasty, , along with their ancestors. The tradition of building royal Kushite pyramids is believed to have originated from King Piankhy. This burial tradition was continued by Piye&#x27;s successor Shabataka, Shabaka. and Tanwetamani. 

Later these pyramids begin to be built 26 kilometers upstream from El-Kurru at the site of Nuri which contains burials from 670-310 BC. The earliest burial at Nuri is accredited to King Taharqo who ruled from 690–664 BC. The oldest and largest pyramid at Nuri–and in all of Nubia–is that of the Napatan king and Twenty-fifth Dynasty pharaoh Taharqa. His tomb, standing at 160–180 feet tall, differed from other Nubian pyramids in the manner that it mirrored the tomb of Osiris, an Egyptian pyramid. The pyramid was built on the left bank of the Nile, typically the west bank representing sunset and death. However, due to the bend of the Nile at Nuri, the left bank is actually the east bank representing sunrise and rebirth. In this way, the tomb was used to associate Taharqa&#x27;s passing with new beginnings and rebirth, paving the way to a new golden age with the ushering in of the next ruler. This necropolis was the burial place of 21 kings and 52 queens and princes including Anlami and Aspelta. The bodies of these kings were placed in huge granite sarcophagi. Aspelta&#x27;s weighed 15.5 tons, and its lid weighed four tons.

The next burial sites appear at Jebel Barkal from late 4th century. This location was an important political and religious centre of the Kingdom of Kush, ancient Napata. The pyramids here are located beside the mountain of Jebel Barkal and consist of 25 pyramids that are split into 2 areas. The earliest pyramids at Jebel Barkal date from the beginning of the 3rd century while the second group of pyramids dates to the 1st century BC.

Eventually, the prosperity of the Nubian kingdom began to decline. Assyrians invaded Nubia, forcing Taharqa&#x27;s successor to flee from Egypt. Following this, a new Egyptian dynasty formed, defeating the Nubians and regaining its independence in 593 BC In response, the capital of Nubia was moved from Napata to Meroe. Nubian rulers consequently chose to be entombed in the new capital, and a new group of pyramids was built at Meroe. The pyramids at Meroe were built beginning in 270 BC and the construction of these pyramids lasted for over 700 years. Centuries passed, until the Nubian kingdom based in Meroe eventually fell to the Romans. The last Nubian pyramid (and the last African pyramid) was built at Meroe around 350 AD.

== Burial methods and architecture ==
Egyptian burial methods began to adapt in Nubia during Egyptian occupation of Nubia during the New Kingdom period.

The Nubian pyramids were constructed using a combination of granite and sandstone and are closely arranged in clusters, such that a selection of two pyramids may lie within touching distance of one another. One of the tools used was shadoof counterbalanced lever hoist, of which the central pivot poles were left buried in the center of the pyramid and covered by their respective cap stones. The interior chambers were lined with plaster and decorated with scenes from the life of the deceased. The largest pyramid at Meroë is high and is thought to have been built for the Nubian queen Amanishakheto.

The Nubian pyramids emulated a form of Egyptian private elite family pyramid that were common during the New Kingdom in Egypt.

In the Twenty-fifth Dynasty, with the Nubian conquest of Egypt, Nubian burial customs began to shift back towards the pyramid in Napata. The more traditional tumulus made way for the pyramid amongst Nubian royalty, but the chapels and underground burial chambers remained from the previous time period. These pyramids were inspired by Egyptian private pyramids dating back to the New Kingdom. Indeed, some burial chambers were decorated in the manner of the private pyramid.

The tombs inside the pyramids of Nubia were plundered in ancient times. Wall reliefs preserved in the tomb chapels reveal that their royal occupants were mummified, covered with jewellery and laid to rest in wooden mummy cases. At the time of their exploration by archaeologists in the 19th and 20th centuries, some pyramids were found to contain the remains of bows, quivers of arrows, archers&#x27; thumb rings, horse harnesses, wooden boxes, furniture, pottery, colored glass, metal vessels, and many other artifacts attesting to extensive Meroitic trade with Egypt and the Hellenistic world.

A pyramid excavated at Meroë included hundreds of heavy items such as large blocks decorated with rock art and 390 stones that comprised the pyramid. A cow buried complete with eye ointment was also unearthed in the area to be flooded by the Meroë Dam, as were ringing rocks that were tapped to create a melodic sound.

It is important to note that the pyramids of royalty and the wealthy differed significantly in various architectural aspects.

Approximately 255 pyramids are known to have been constructed by the Nubians, more than double the number constructed in Ancient Egypt.

The physical proportions of Nubian pyramids differ markedly from the Egyptian pyramids: they are built of stepped courses of horizontally positioned stone blocks and range approximately in height, but rise from fairly small foundation footprints, resulting in tall, narrow structures inclined at approximately 70°. Most also have offering temple structures abutting their base with unique Kushite characteristics. Egyptian pyramids of similar height generally had foundation footprints at least five times larger and were inclined at angles between 40–50°.

The most striking difference, however, is that while Egyptian pyramids house tombs of rulers within, Nubian pyramids are built on top of the burial chambers. This was a longtime source of confusion to archaeologists until George Reisner discovered that the entryways were filled in and concealed following the ruler&#x27;s funeral. In this way, the pyramids served as elaborate tombstones, and tributes to the Egyptian way.

== Notable figures and their discoveries ==
In the 1830s Giuseppe Ferlini came to Meroe seeking treasure and raided and demolished a number of pyramids which had been found &quot;in good conditions&quot; by Frédéric Cailliaud just a few years earlier. At Wad ban Naqa, he leveled the pyramid N6 of the &quot;kandake&quot; Amanishakheto starting from the top, and found dozens of gold and silver jewelry pieces. Overall, he is considered responsible for the destruction of over 40 pyramids.
Ferlini returned home in 1836, having found the treasure he was looking for. A year later he wrote a report of his expedition containing a catalog of his findings, which was translated in French and republished in 1838. He tried to sell the treasure, but at this time nobody believed that such high quality jewellery could be made in Sub-Saharan Africa. His finds were finally sold in Germany: part of these were purchased by King Ludwig I of Bavaria and are now in the State Museum of Egyptian Art of Munich, while the remaining – under suggestions of Karl Richard Lepsius and of Christian Charles Josias von Bunsen – was bought by the Egyptian Museum of Berlin where it still is.

George Reisner, a Harvard archaeologist, investigated the pyramids at Nuri and mapped more than 80 royal Kushite burials in 1916–1919. Reisner started to explore burial chambers but he found they were flooded by the rising water table. During his excavation, a staircase collapsed and killed five of his workers. He abandoned his expedition believing it to be too dangerous. Some of his findings were published in 1955. Nonetheless, Reisner&#x27;s work helped to piece together the history of an ancient kingdom, one that was previously little known outside of its biblical mentions.

National Geographic funded explorations from 2015 to 2019 using underwater scuba diving equipment and remote controlled robots.

<text>Tadeusz Mazowiecki (; 18 April 1927 – 28 October 2013) was a Polish author, journalist, philanthropist and politician, formerly one of the leaders of the Solidarity movement, and the first non-communist Polish prime minister since 1946, having held the post from 1989 to 1991.

He was the founder and leader of Democratic Union and Freedom Union. Between 1991–2001, he was a member of the Polish Parliament. In the years 2010–2013, he served as advisor to President Bronisław Komorowski. He is the recipient of Poland&#x27;s highest order of merit, the Order of the White Eagle.

==Biography==

Tadeusz Mazowiecki was born in Płock, Poland on 18 April 1927 to a Polish noble family, which uses the Dołęga coat of arms. Both his parents worked at the local Holy Trinity Hospital: his father was a doctor there while his mother ran a charity for the poor. His education was interrupted by the outbreak of World War II. During the war he worked as a runner in the hospital his parents worked for. After the German forces had been expelled from Płock, Tadeusz Mazowiecki resumed his education and in 1946, he graduated from &quot;Marshal Stanisław Małachowski&quot; Lyceum, the oldest high school in Poland and one of the oldest continuously operating school in Europe. He then moved to Łódź and then to Warsaw, where he joined the Law Faculty of the Warsaw University. However, he never graduated and instead devoted himself to activity in various Catholic associations, journals and publishing houses.

=== Catholic activist ===

==== PAX and WTK ====

Already during his brief stay at the Warsaw University Mazowiecki joined the Caritas Academica charity organisation, he also briefly headed the University Printing Cooperative between 1947 and 1948. In 1946 he also joined Karol Popiel&#x27;s Labour Party. However, later that year the party was outlawed by the new Stalinist authorities of Soviet-controlled Poland. Almost all other non-communist organisations soon also became a target of state-sponsored repressions.

One of the exceptions was the PAX Association, the only large Catholic organisation supported by the Communist authorities – and supporting the authorities in their conflict with the Catholic clergy. Mazowiecki joined PAX in 1948, initially as one of the leaders of the youth circles. He openly criticised Bolesław Piasecki&#x27;s vision of the association and his allegiance to the Communists. He nevertheless rose through the ranks of various journals published by the association. Initially, a journalist in the &quot;Dziś i Jutro&quot; weekly, in 1950 he became the deputy editor-in-chief of &quot;Słowo Powszechne&quot; daily newspaper. In 1952 the conflict between Piasecki and the opposition within the PAX (the so-called Fronda, composed mostly of young intellectuals) led to Mazowiecki being expelled from the daily and relegated to a less prominent role of an editor of newly created &quot;&quot; (&quot;Wrocław Catholic Weekly&quot;, WTK). Until 1955 he served as the editor-in-chief of that journal, he also remained one of the leaders of the opposition within the association, criticising Piasecki and his associates for their conflicts with the Catholic hierarchy, loyalty to the communist authorities, and lack of democratic procedures within PAX. For that he was eventually dismissed from the WTK and eventually in 1955 expelled from the association altogether.

==== Involvement in Communist propaganda ====

Despite criticizing Piasecki, Mazowiecki offered his own support to the Communist authorities, expressed in press articles and other publications. In 1952, he published a pamphlet titled &quot;The enemy remains the same&quot; (&quot;&quot;, co-authored with Zygmunt Przetakiewicz, then editor-in-chief of &quot;WTK&quot;) imputing an alliance between Polish anti-communist resistance movement and Nazi war criminals. In a press article published in &quot;WTK&quot; in 1953, Mazowiecki fiercely condemned Czesław Kaczmarek, then Bishop of Kielce. Kaczmarek, groundlessly accused by the Communists of being an American and Vatican spy, was later sentenced to 12 years in prison.

==== Club of Catholic Intelligence and &#x27;Więź&#x27; ====

Having left PAX, together with a group of his former colleagues Tadeusz Mazowiecki started cooperation with the &quot;Tygodnik Powszechny&quot; weekly, &quot;Po prostu&quot; journal and the Crooked Circle Club. While these journals were formally dependent on PAX, they were increasingly liberal and independent. Eventually, during the Polish October of 1956 Tadeusz Mazowiecki became one of the founders of the All-Polish Club of Progressive Catholic Intelligentsia, the predecessor of Club of Catholic Intelligentsia (KIK), the first all-national Catholic organisation independent of the Communist authorities in post-war Poland. Until 1963 he served as a board member of KIK. He was also a founding member of the &quot;Więź&quot; Catholic monthly in 1958 and served as its first editor-in-chief. While relatively independent from the Communist authorities, the monthly was also independent from the Catholic hierarchy, which often led to conflicts with both. In his texts published in &quot;Więź&quot; Mazowiecki, inspired by Emmanuel Mounier&#x27;s personalist ideas, sought intellectual dialogue with members of left-leaning lay intelligentsia.

Mazowiecki was a friend and confidant of Pope John Paul II.

=== Politician and dissident ===

One of the lasting effects of Władysław Gomułka&#x27;s rise to power during the Polish October 1956 was the dissolution of PAX. A group of former PAX dissenters, the &quot;Fronda&quot;, along with some of the professors of the Catholic University of Lublin approached Gomułka in 1956. In exchange for their support, Gomułka accepted the creation of Znak Association along with its publishing house, the only such venture independent from the communist government in contemporary Poland. Moreover, a small group of 12 Catholics associated with the Znak were allowed to run in the Polish legislative election of 1957, among them Tadeusz Mazowiecki. While the 12 members of parliament elected that year were formally independent, they formed the first form of opposition to the rule of the Polish United Workers&#x27; Party within the Polish Sejm, dubbed the &quot;MP circle of Znak&quot; (). Mazowiecki remained a member of the Sejm until 1971, serving his second, third and fourth terms as a member of the Catholic &quot;party&quot;.

During his parliamentary career, he was an active member of the Commission on Education and the Commission on Work and Social Matters. As Poland was effectively a one-party state, the role of the token opposition was mostly symbolic. However, some of Mazowiecki&#x27;s speeches and interpellations made a large impact on Polish society. Such was the case of his critique of the official curriculum of Polish schools underlining the crucial role of Karl Marx&#x27;s historical materialism, or his isolated protest against the new Assemblies Act, effectively putting an end even to a theoretical freedom of assembly in Poland. In 1968 he was the only member of parliament to raise the issue of the brutal suppression of the students&#x27; demonstrations during the 1968 Polish political crisis. In the aftermath of the bloody quelling of the 1970 protests, in which 42 people were killed by the army and the Citizens&#x27; Militia, Tadeusz Mazowiecki unsuccessfully demanded that the matter be investigated in order to find those responsible for the bloodshed. This and similar acts of questioning the actions of the Communist authorities made Mazowiecki one of the unwanted members of parliament and consequently in 1972 the party did not allow him to run for his fifth term.

Having left the Sejm, Mazowiecki became the head of Warsaw chapter of the Club of Catholic Intelligentsia and one of the best-known Polish dissidents. In early 1976, soon after the publication of the Letter of 59, Mazowiecki initiated a similar letter to the PUWP signed by most members of the former Znak circle. Although not a member of the Workers&#x27; Defence Committee, he supported it on numerous occasions, notably in the aftermath of the June 1976 protests in Radom and Ursus. An heir to a long tradition of organic work, on 22 January 1978 Tadeusz Mazowiecki, together with other Polish dissidents, including Stefan Amsterdamski, Andrzej Celiński and Andrzej Kijowski, became one of the founding members of the Society of Scientific Courses, the predecessor of the Flying University.

=== Solidarity and the fall of Communism ===

In August 1980, he headed the Board of Experts, which supported the workers from Gdańsk who were negotiating with the authorities. From 1981, he was the editor-in-chief of the &quot;Tygodnik Solidarność&quot; weekly magazine. After martial law was declared in December 1981 he was arrested and imprisoned in Strzebielnik, then in Jaworz and finally in Darłówek.

He was one of the last prisoners to be released on 23 December 1982. In 1987, he spent a year abroad, during which he talked to politicians and trade union representatives. Starting in 1988, he held talks in Magdalenka. He firmly believed in the process of taking power from the ruling Polish United Workers&#x27; Party through negotiation and thus he played an active role in the Polish Round Table Talks, becoming one of the most important architects of the agreement by which partially free elections were held on 4 June 1989. While the Communists and their satellites were guaranteed a majority in the legislature, Solidarity won all of the contested seats in a historic landslide.

The Communists had originally planned for Solidarity to be a junior partner in the ensuing government. However, Solidarity turned the tables on the Communists by persuading the Communists&#x27; two satellite parties to switch their support to Solidarity. This would all but force Communist President Wojciech Jaruzelski to appoint a Solidarity member as prime minister, heading the first government in 45 years that was not dominated by Communists. At a meeting on 17 August 1989, Jaruzelski finally agreed to Lech Wałęsa&#x27;s demand to pick a Solidarity member as the next prime minister. Walesa chose Mazowiecki as a Solidarity candidate to lead the coming administration. On 21 August 1989 General Jaruzelski formally appointed Mazowiecki as Prime Minister-designate. On 24 August 1989, he won a vote of confidence in the Sejm. He thus became the first Polish prime minister in 43 years who was not either a Communist or a fellow traveler, as well as the first non-communist Prime Minister of an Eastern European country in over 40 years.

===Prime minister===
On 13 September 1989 during his long investiture speech outlining the extensive political agenda of his nominated cabinet prior to the mandatory confidence vote, Mazowiecki grew weak necessitating a one-hour break in proceedings. However, the government was approved by a vote 402–0, with 13 abstentions. Mazowiecki&#x27;s government managed to carry out many fundamental reforms in a short period. The political system was thoroughly changed; a full range of civil freedoms as well as a multi-party system were introduced and the country&#x27;s emblem and name were changed (from the People&#x27;s Republic of Poland to the Republic of Poland). On 29 December 1989, the fundamental changes in the Polish Constitution were made. By virtue of these changes, the preamble was deleted, the chapters concerning political and economic forms of government were changed, the chapters concerning trade unions were rewritten and a uniform notion of possession was introduced.

Mazowiecki used enormous popularity and credibility of the Solidarity movement to transform the Polish economy by a set of deep political and economic reforms. Better known under the name of Balcerowicz Plan after Mazowiecki&#x27;s minister of finance, Leszek Balcerowicz, the reforms enabled the transformation of the Polish economy from a centrally-planned economy to a market economy. The reforms have prepared the ground for measures stopping the hyperinflation, introducing free-market mechanisms and privatisation of state-owned companies, houses and land. The plan resulted in reduced inflation and budget deficit, while simultaneously increasing Unemployment and worsening the financial situation of the poorest members of society. In 1989, in his first parliamentary speech in Sejm, Mazowiecki talked about a &quot;thick line&quot; (&quot;&quot;): &quot;We draw a thick line on what has happened in the past. We will answer for only what we have done to help Poland to rescue her from this crisis from now on&quot;. Originally, as Mazowiecki explains, it meant non-liability of his government for damages done to the national economy by previous governments.

===Later years===
In 1991 Mazowiecki was appointed the United Nations Commission of Human Rights Special Rapporteur on the &quot;Situation of Human Rights in the Territory of the Former Yugoslavia&quot;. In 1993 he issued a report on human rights violations in the Former Yugoslavia and he recommended criminal accountability for the atrocities being perpetrated there. However, two years later Mazowiecki stepped down in protest at what he regarded as the international community&#x27;s insufficient response to atrocities committed during the Bosnian war, particularly the Srebrenica massacre committed by the Serb army that year.
A conflict with Lech Wałęsa resulted in the disintegration of Citizens&#x27; Parliamentary Club that represented Solidarity camp. The Citizens&#x27; Parliamentary Club was divided into Centre Agreement, which supported Wałęsa, and ROAD, which took sides with Mazowiecki. That conflict lead both politicians to compete in presidential election at the end of 1990. Mazowiecki, who during Solidarity times was an advisor to Lech Wałęsa and strike committee in Gdańsk&#x27;s shipyard, stood against Wałęsa in the election and lost to him. He did not even join the second round (he gained the support of 18.08% of people – 2,973,364 votes) and was defeated by Stanisław Tymiński, a maverick candidate from Canada.

In 1991, Mazowiecki became a chairman of the Democratic Union (later Freedom Union), and from 1995 he was its honorary president. Together with Jan Maria Rokita, Aleksander Hall and Hanna Suchocka he represented the Christian Democratic wing of the party. Between 1989 and 2001 Mazowiecki was a representative to the Polish Parliament (first from Poznań, later from Kraków).

Mazowiecki was a member of parliament in the first, second, and third term (a member of the Democratic Union), later the Freedom Union.
During the National Assembly (1997) he introduced compromise preamble of Polish constitution (previously written by founders of &quot;Tygodnik Powszechny&quot; weekly), which was accepted by the National Assembly. In November 2002, he left the Freedom Union, .
In 2005, he became one of the founders of the Democratic Party – demokraci.pl – created through expanding the former Freedom Union by new members, especially young people, and few left-wing politicians. He was a leader on the parliamentary list in parliamentary elections in Warsaw constituency in 2005 with 30143 votes. The highest number of votes he gained in Żoliborz district, and the lowest in Rembertów. Until 2006 he was the leader of its Political Council.

Mazowiecki received numerous awards including an honorary degree from the universities in: Leuven, Genoa, Giessen, Poitiers, Exeter, Warsaw and the Katowice University of Economics. He also received the Order of White Eagle (1995), Golden Order of Bosnia (1996), Légion d&#x27;honneur (1997), Srebrnica Award (2005), the Giant award (1995) awarded by &quot;&quot; (&quot;Election Gazette&quot;) in Poznań and Jan Nowak-Jezioranski Award (2004). In 2003, he was elected to the board of directors of the International Criminal Court&#x27;s Trust Fund for Victims. Mazowiecki was a member of the Club of Madrid. He was a supporter of a more united Europe.

Mazowiecki died in Warsaw on 28 October 2013, having been taken to hospital the previous week with a fever. Foreign Minister Radosław Sikorski stated that he was &quot;one of the fathers of Polish liberty and independence&quot;. He was survived by three sons from his second marriage.

<doc id="927701" wikidata="Q6115085" url="?curid=927701" title="Jack Shaftoe">
<text>Jack Shaftoe (also known, at various points, as King of the Vagabonds, L&#x27;Emmerdeur, Half-Cocked Jack, Quicksilver, Ali Zaybak, Sword of Divine Fire, and Jack the Coiner) is one of the three primary fictional characters in Neal Stephenson&#x27;s 2,686-page, Clarke Award-winning epic trilogy, &quot;The Baroque Cycle&quot;.

Born in 1660 to a poor London family, Jack, the youngest of three half-brothers, becomes a mudlark at the age of five, abandoning this then-common criminal enterprise shortly thereafter when his eldest half-brother Dick is drowned during a failed raid on a Dutch &quot;galjoot&quot; in the Thames. After several years working as an impromptu assistant to men about to be hanged by Jack Ketch from the Treble Tree in Tyburn, Jack leaves England to become a vagabond in continental Europe. Much of &quot;The Baroque Cycle&quot; concerns Jack&#x27;s adventures in (among other ports-of-call) England, France, Germany, Austria, The Barbary Coast, Egypt, India, Japan, the Philippines, and Mexico between the years 1683 and 1714.

In its 2004 review of &quot;The Confusion&quot;, &quot;The Guardian&quot; called the character of Jack Shaftoe &quot;magnificent ... a swashbuckling hero with a foul mouth and few morals.&quot; &quot;The Village Voice&quot; has translated one of the more commonly used fictional sobriquets used to describe Shaftoe, &quot;l&#x27;emmerdeur&quot;, as &quot;he who fucks shit up.&quot;

==Characterization==

Shaftoe is illiterate until his later years and slightly mad, having contracted syphilis at a time when it was still untreatable. Nevertheless, he is depicted by Stephenson as a daring, charismatic, clever, and resourceful man. While he&#x27;s possessed by an almost pathological impulsiveness, denominated by his brother Bob &quot;The Imp of the Perverse,&quot; Jack also exhibits a surprising capacity for loyalty, mercy, and even, at times, mawkish sentimentality.

During the fifty-four years of European history traced by &quot;The Baroque Cycle&quot;, Jack loves only one woman, Eliza de la Zeur, the rescued harem-slave turned English Duchess/French Countess (though Jack fathers two children in the early 1680s, Danny and Jimmy, by Irishwoman Mary Dolores Partry, who dies shortly thereafter). Jack spends much of the period between 1683 and 1714 either fighting for his life or attempting to earn, from a great distance, the love and respect of Eliza; often these endeavors are concurrent. His late 17th-century/early 18th-century exploits as a street urchin, mercenary soldier, vagabond, errand-boy, merchant, galley-slave, pirate, petty despot, spy, coiner, and terrorist in the employ of King Louis XIV are the subject, in the world of Stephenson&#x27;s epic, not only of much of the text proper but also of widely popular picaresque novels read by various characters in the story.

Shaftoe is a distant ancestor of a number of characters appearing in Stephenson&#x27;s earlier novel, &quot;Cryptonomicon&quot;, including Bobby Shaftoe, Douglas MacArthur Shaftoe, America &quot;Amy&quot; Shaftoe, Marcus Aurelius Shaftoe, Robin Shaftoe, and presumably the mysterious &quot;Uncle Jack&quot; Shaftoe.

<text>The Olympic Stadium of Athens &quot;[[Spyridon Louis|Spyros Louis]]&quot; (, &quot;Olympiakó Stádio Athinón &quot;Spýros Loúis&quot;&quot;) is a sports stadium in Marousi, in the north section of Athens, Greece. With a total capacity of 75,000, it is the largest sports venue in Greece. It is a part of the Athens Olympic Sports Complex (OAKA) and is named after the first modern Olympic marathon gold medalist in 1896, Spyros Louis. The stadium served as the main stadium during the 2004 Summer Olympics and the 2004 Summer Paralympics, including the opening and closing ceremonies.It is the current home ground of Panathinaikos F.C.

Built in 1982 for the 1982 European Athletics Championships and the Hellenic Football Federation&#x27;s host bid for the 1990 FIFA World Cup, it became the national stadium of Greece. In its original iteration, it served as the home ground for football clubs Panathinaikos from 1984 to 2000, Olympiacos from 1984 to 1989 and again from 1997 to 2002, and AEK Athens from 1985 to 1987. Additionally, it became the main venue for athletics, as Greek track rose on the international stage, while it also hosted the Greek national football team. It served as the venue for the 1991 Mediterranean Games and the 1997 World Athletics Championships.

As part of the greater construction of the Olympic Sports Complex, the stadium was substantially renovated from 2002 to 2004, to some controversy, highlighted by its trademark roof, designed by Santiago Calatrava. The hosting of the 2004 Olympics and Paralympics became a huge success and was highly lucrative for Greece. After the Games, it hosted Panathinaikos on several occasions from 2005 to 2023 and AEK Athens from 2004 to 2022, while serving as the country&#x27;s primary sports venue. By the early 2020s, it had become increasingly dilapidated and it was closed on safety grounds in October 2023. Following modifications on the roof, it reopened in May 2024.

The Olympic Stadium has hosted three European Cup/Champions League finals, in 1983, 1994 and 2007, the 1987 European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup Final and the men&#x27;s final in the Summer Olympics.

==History==

Located in the suburb of Marousi in Athens, the Olympic Stadium was originally designed in 1980 and built in 1980–1982. At over 75,000 capacity, it became the biggest football and track stadium in Greece, well surpassing Thessaloniki&#x27;s Kaftanzoglio Stadium, which stood at just below 45,000 capacity at the time, following the nationwide renovations after the Karaiskakis Stadium disaster.

It was completed in time to host the 1982 European Championships in Athletics. It was inaugurated by the President of Greece at the time, Konstantinos Karamanlis, on 8 September 1982. Considered an illustrious architectural achievement, it was dubbed by European media as &quot;The modern Greek Wonder&quot;. One year later, in 1983, OAKA Stadium hosted the 1983 European Cup final between Hamburger SV and Juventus. In 1984, Panathinaikos took over the Olympic Stadium as their home ground after the Leoforos Alexandras Stadium, fell into disrepair. At the same year Olympiacos also decided to play their home games in the Olympic Stadium instead of the Karaiskakis Stadium, which they shared with city rivals until 1989. The club had successfully experimented with the stadium&#x27;s usage in its 1982–83 and 1983–84 European campaigns, which included a 2–0 win against Dutch giants AFC Ajax in September 1983, and a 0–4 loss to eventual winners Hamburger in November 1982, which recorded the ground&#x27;s highest official figures to date, at 75,223 spectators, although unofficial estimates for many events range higher.

In 1985 AEK Athens also moved to the Olympic Stadium until 1987, due to construction works at AEK Stadium. During the club&#x27;s brief stay at the stadium&#x27;s initial configuration, an official attendance record of 74,465 was set in a home league match versus Olympiacos in February 1986, which is an all-time record for a Greek football match.

In the 1980s, the three largest Greek football clubs temporarily played in the same stadium, so that during the 1985–86 season the most tickets were sold in one season in Greece, with 1,784,844 tickets sold in 45 games.

Olympiacos returned to the Karaiskakis Stadium in 1989, but as their contract for the stadium rent expired in 1997, the team returned to the Olympic Stadium, which ushered an era of unprecedented success, as the team would win five consecutive league titles and reach the quarter-finals of the UEFA Champions League in the 1998–99 season, establishing a long period of dominance in Greek football, characterised by famous club players such as Christian Karembeu and Giovanni, before departing in 2002 to make way for the Olympic renovations. As the plans for a total renovation of the aging Karaiskakis Stadium commenced, the team played in the Georgios Kamaras Stadium, commonly known as Rizoupoli, from 2002 to 2004, before settling in the rebuilt Karaiskakis, where the club has been situated since.

In 1987, the stadium hosted the 1986–87 European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup final between Ajax and Lokomotiv Leipzig. Olympic Stadium is an UEFA category four stadium and is the largest stadium in Greece. In 1994, the stadium hosted their second European Cup Final, this time contested between Milan and Barcelona. It also hosted several events of the 1991 Mediterranean Games and the 1997 World Championships in Athletics, sought in order to prove that it was capable of hosting major sporting events after the failure of Athens to win the 1996 Summer Olympics, but successfully hosting the 2004 Summer Olympics. As a result, the construction works for the stadium which begun in 2002 resulted in Panathinaikos and Olympiacos, who had returned to the Olympic Stadium in 1997, to return to their original homegrounds by the same year. In addition, every final of the Greek Football Cup between 1983 and 2002 took place in the arena intermittently, while it also hosted the only final of the Greek League Cup in 1990.

===2004 Summer Olympics===

It was extensively renovated in time for the 2004 Summer Olympics and the 2004 Summer Paralympics, including a roof designed by Santiago Calatrava, and innovatively positioned with Enerpac hydraulics. The roof was added atop the sidelines and completed just in time for the opening of the Games. The stadium was then officially re-opened on 30 July 2004. It hosted the athletics events and the football finals at the Olympics and the athletics at the Paralympics. It also hosted the opening ceremony on 13 August 2004, and the closing ceremony on 29 August 2004 along the Paralympics ceremonies on 17 and 28 September.

===Aftermath===
After the Olympic Games, AEK Athens and Panathinaikos, whose stadiums had become dilapidated and no longer met safety regulations, moved again to the Olympic Stadium. AEK&#x27;s move back to the stadium after 17 years came as the Nikos Goumas Stadium, the club&#x27;s traditional home ground since 1930, was demolished in 2003. After spending the first half of the 2003–04 season at the Nea Smyrni Stadium and then primarily at the Giannis Pathiakakis Stadium, due to fan incidents, the club completed its move at the end of the Olympic Games as a temporary stay, which became permanent as AEK&#x27;s plans for a new stadium were put on halt in the 2000s, due to the club&#x27;s financial condition.

In 2007, OAKA Stadium hosted the 2007 UEFA Champions League final between Milan and Liverpool. The stadium&#x27;s attendance was reduced to 72,000 for the Olympics, the initial capacity was some 75,000, though only 69,618 seats were made publicly available for the track and field events and slightly more for the football final. The turf system consists of natural grass in modular containers which incorporate irrigation and drainage systems. Greece applied together with Turkey to host the 2008 and 2012 European Football Championships, with the finals supposed to have taken place in the Athens Olympic Stadium. However, the applications failed: in 2008 the competition went to Austria and Switzerland and for 2012 UEFA decided in favor of Poland and Ukraine.

On 18 March 2012, wild incidents occurred in the derby between Panathinaikos and Olympiacos, as after the goal from the red and whites at the eleventh minute, hooligans from the home team threw Molotov cocktails at the stands, which were filled with around 50,000 spectators, and the pitch. The game had to be abandoned and was awarded 3–0 to Olympiacos and Panathinaikos were deducted five points. There were 30 fires in the arena and 57 arrests. On 14 April 2013, several AEK Athens ultras stormed the pitch during the game against Panthrakikos, who had taken the lead in the 87th minute. The game was subsequently cancelled and awarded 0–3 for Panthrakikos, as AEK Athens were eventually relegated for the first time in their history after being deducted an additional three points. Nevertheless, they continued using the stadium as their home ground. 

In 2013, Panathinaikos, unable to afford the rent for the Olympic Stadium, due to the club&#x27;s deteriorating financial situation, returned in the renovated Leoforos Alexandras Stadium, however the green used again the Olympic Stadium as their home ground from 2018 to 2020. In 2022, as Agia Sophia Stadium was completed, AEK Athens left the Olympic Stadium, after a stay for nearly two decades characterised by major ups and downs for the club&#x27;s history. After the Olympics, the Olympic Stadium hosted again the Greek Football Cup finals from 2009 to 2016 and in 2018, 2019, 2021 and 2022 respectively.

In 2023, an inspection of the stadium&#x27;s roof and a preliminary study of upgrades were organized to prepare stadium for the first renovation since 2004. After the inspection, the stadium and the nearby Athens Olympic Velodrome were subsequently ordered to stop instituting any sort of organized events inside the venues and effectively shut down over safety failures.

Following the removal of unsafe panels on the roof, the stadium reopened in May 2024. The renovations are expected to be completed by 2026.

==Design==
===Construction===
The foundation stone for the Olympic Stadium was laid on 7 January 1980. Its construction was revolutionary and involved the use of a prefabrication method for the 34 sets of pillars supporting the stands (each weighed 600 tons). About 26,000 seats of the lower tier were covered, while the stadium&#x27;s most striking feature were the four leaning pillars that held its floodlights, each being 62 metres tall. The Athens Olympic Stadium was finally inaugurated in September 1982.

===Renovation===
The stadium was renovated from 2002 until 2004 adding the famous roof for the 2004 Summer Olympics. The central lawn of O.A.K.A consists of approximately 6.000 plastic capsules inside which thermophile lawn is grown. The capsules are adjoining, their size is 1.2*1.2m and are situated on a flat cement surface of two acres, flanked by two lateral drainage channels. The irrigation of the lawn is achieved by 35 automatically elevated water launchers with the use of programmed irrigation. This system allows the movement of the lawn to an area outside the stadium in order for the surface to be used for different events. Thirty-four entrance gates provide access to the stands. Odd gate numbers (1 to 35) lead to the lower and even numbers (2 to 34) to the upper tier. There are no gates numbered 18 and 36, since the two video-scoreboards are located in their place. Additionally, the stadium features 17 VIP boxes and 3 parking lots. Due to its design, the stadium&#x27;s tribunes have the ability to empty within 7 minutes.

Competition Area
===Roof===
Designed by the Spanish architect Santiago Calatrava, the roof cost €256.2 million. The two giant arcs have a total span of 304m and a maximum height of 72m. The roof has a total weight of 18,700 tons coverering by 5,000 polycarbonate panels which covers an area of 25,000 square metres. The west arc was assembled 72m from its final position and the east 65m - both later slid into place. The roof is designed to withstand winds up to 120 km/h and earthquakes up to magnitude 8.

===Transport===
Access by:

Car - Exit the city centre to the north via Kifissias Avenue and just follow the road signs to &quot;OAKA&quot;. If you come from the Attiki Odos ring road, use exit 11 (&quot;Kifissias - Ol. Stadium&quot;).

Bus - Use E14 from Syntagma Square in central Athens. It will take you directly to the Olympic Stadium in at least 30 minutes.

Metro - It is a 25-minute ride from the city centre. Use Line 1 and get off at &quot;Irini&quot; or &quot;Neratziotissa&quot;. From there, it is a 10-minute walk from the Olympic Complex to the stadium.

<text>The glucose oxidase enzyme (GOx or GOD) also known as notatin (EC number 1.1.3.4) is an oxidoreductase that catalyses the oxidation of glucose to hydrogen peroxide and D-glucono-δ-lactone. This enzyme is produced by certain species of fungi and insects and displays antibacterial activity when oxygen and glucose are present.

Glucose oxidase is widely used for the determination of free glucose in body fluids (medical testing), in vegetal raw material, and in the food industry. It also has many applications in biotechnologies, typically enzyme assays for biochemistry including biosensors in nanotechnologies. It was first isolated by Detlev Müller in 1928 from &quot;Aspergillus niger&quot;.

==Function==

Several species of fungi and insects synthesize glucose oxidase, which produces hydrogen peroxide, which kills bacteria.

Notatin, extracted from antibacterial cultures of &quot;Penicillium notatum&quot;, was originally named Penicillin A, but was renamed to avoid confusion with penicillin. Notatin was shown to be identical to Penicillin B and glucose oxidase, enzymes extracted from other molds besides &quot;P. notatum&quot;; it is now generally known as glucose oxidase.

Early experiments showed that notatin exhibits &quot;in vitro&quot; antibacterial activity (in the presence of glucose) due to hydrogen peroxide formation. &quot;In vivo&quot; tests showed that notatin was not effective in protecting rodents from &quot;Streptococcus haemolyticus&quot;, &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot;, or salmonella, and caused severe tissue damage at some doses.

Glucose oxidase is also produced by the hypopharyngeal glands of honeybee workers and deposited into honey where it acts as a natural preservative. GOx at the surface of the honey reduces atmospheric O2 to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), which acts as an antimicrobial barrier.

== Structure ==

GOx is a dimeric protein, the 3D structure of which has been elucidated. The active site where glucose binds is in a deep pocket. The enzyme, like many proteins that act outside of cells, is covered with carbohydrate chains. GOx is a glucose oxidising enzyme with a molecular weight of 160 kDa. It is a dimeric glycoprotein consisting of two subunits each weighing 80 kDa. Flavinadenine dinucleotide (FAD) in the active site is buried approximately 1.5 nm inside the protein shell and acts as the initial electron acceptor.

== Mechanism ==

At pH 7, glucose exists in solution in cyclic hemiacetal form as 63.6% β-D-glucopyranose and 36.4% α-D-glucopyranose, the proportion of linear and furanose form being negligible. The glucose oxidase binds specifically to β-D-glucopyranose and does not act on α-D-glucose. It oxidises all of the glucose in solution because the equilibrium between the α and β anomers is driven towards the β side as it is consumed in the reaction.

Glucose oxidase catalyzes the oxidation of β-D-glucose into D-glucono-1,5-lactone, which then hydrolyzes into gluconic acid.

In order to work as a catalyst, GOx requires a coenzyme, flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD). FAD is a common component in biological oxidation-reduction (redox) reactions. Redox reactions involve a gain or loss of electrons from a molecule. In the GOx-catalyzed redox reaction, FAD works as the initial electron acceptor and is reduced to FADH−. Then FADH− is oxidized by the final electron acceptor, molecular oxygen (O2), which can do so because it has a higher reduction potential. O2 is then reduced to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2).

== Applications ==
=== Glucose monitoring ===
Glucose oxidase is widely used coupled to peroxidase reaction that visualizes colorimetrically the formed H2O2, for the determination of free glucose in sera or blood plasma for diagnostics, using spectrometric assays manually or with automated procedures, and even point-of-use rapid assays.

Similar assays allows the monitoring of glucose levels in fermentation, bioreactors, and to control glucose in vegetal raw material and food products. In the glucose oxidase assay, the glucose is first oxidized, catalyzed by glucose oxidase, to produce gluconate and hydrogen peroxide. The hydrogen peroxide is then oxidatively coupled with a chromogen to produce a colored compound which may be measured spectroscopically. For example, hydrogen peroxide together with 4 amino-antipyrene (4-AAP) and phenol in the presence of peroxidase yield a red quinoeimine dye that can be measured at 505 nm. The absorbance at 505 nm is proportional to concentration of glucose in the sample.

Enzymatic glucose biosensors use an electrode instead of O2 to take up the electrons needed to oxidize glucose and produce an electronic current in proportion to glucose concentration. This is the technology behind the disposable glucose sensor strips used by diabetics to monitor serum glucose levels.

=== Food preservation ===
In manufacturing, GOx is used as an additive thanks to its oxidizing effects: it prompts for stronger dough in baking, replacing oxidants such as bromate. It is also used as a food preservative to help remove oxygen and glucose from food when packaged such as dry egg powder to prevent unwanted browning and undesired taste.

=== Wound treatment ===
Wound care products, such as &quot;Flaminal Hydro&quot; make use of an alginate hydrogel containing glucose oxidase and other components as an oxidation agent.

== Clinical trials ==

A nasal spray from a bag-on-valve device that mixes glucose oxidase with glucose has undergone clinical trials in 2016 for the prevention and treatment of the common cold.

<doc id="927712" wikidata="Q5330534" url="?curid=927712" title="Eastern Transport Corridor">
<text>The Eastern Transport Corridor in Auckland, New Zealand, is a transport reserve along a strip of land and water some of which is occupied by housing, commerce, industry and local roads. It runs adjacent to the North Island Main Trunk freight and passenger railway line.

Historically, it was to provide the route for an additional motorway connecting through the isthmus from the east into the Auckland CBD, with an estimated cost of up to $4 billion, but political and local community resistance made the project fail in the 2000s. In 2022, Te Ara ki Uta ki Tai, a walking and cycling path between Glen Innes and Tamaki Drive, was built in this corridor; and the Eastern Busway is being built further south.

== Proposed motorway ==

=== Original designs ===
A strategy study in 2002 stated a need for a new motorway to be built in the corridor (as had been planned decades before) for a variety of reasons including the need to make suburban streets safer and less polluted. In March 2004, Auckland City Mayor John Banks proposed a motorway scheme through Hobson Bay. There was substantial community and political resistance to the scheme, largely due to the cost of the proposal (equivalent to four years of the entire country&#x27;s transport funding budget) and the impact it would have on a number of established neighbourhoods, as well as areas like Tamaki Drive, the Parnell Baths and several environmentally sensitive areas. However, there were also groups that defended it, citing the projected economic gains, and the benefit it would have on the traffic volumes on Tamaki Drive. Banks proposed to underground large sections of the scheme (earning it the nickname &#x27;tunnelway&#x27; amongst some commentators) and proposed to pay for the construction costs at least partly by selling Auckland City&#x27;s 25% shareholding in Auckland International Airport, and by charging a $5 toll.

In 2002, Banks proposed that the Eastern Transport Corridor might link into a harbour tunnel starting north of Parnell, and linking to Ngataringa Bay near Devonport, for an estimated cost of $1 billion.

=== Revised designs ===
Many spoke out against the project, including former Auckland City Mayor Christine Fletcher, who argued that the proposed motorway barely featured in the statutory policy documents, that city councillors lacked the necessary information to make informed decisions, and that the intended growth areas of the city would not require the corridor, with a public transport route being preferable.

A revised plan published on 25 August 2004 reduced the number of lanes substantially (2-3 lanes + bus lane in each direction depending on the section), reducing the financial and ecological impact. Banks said he hoped the scheme would be acceptable to the opponents of the scheme, even though around 1,200 houses would still have to be demolished or otherwise affected. The Purewa Creek section was to be aligned on an elevated expressway to avoid damage to the environmentally sensitive area, while the motorway would be sunk into trenches in Glen Innes to reduce disruption. Depending on the connection to the CBD, the scheme would have either entered the city on a widened western Tamaki Drive section after crossing Hobson Bay, or gone through a tunnel under Parnell – which politicians promised would reduce much of the effects on Parnell residents.

However the impacts were still high, and the costs rising (with a worst case estimate of NZ$3.9 billion), and at that point the corridor was fast becoming a political boondoggle.

The proposed motorway was one of the principal points of contention in the 2004 local body elections and contributed to the defeat of Banks. It also led to the election of two candidates from the Action Hobson protest group who became councillors primarily on the promise to stop the new motorway.

The Auckland City Council transport and urban linkages committee decided on 10 December 2004 to scrap the planned motorway component in favour of improved public transport and increased capacity on existing local roads. However the transport reserve remains in place, allowing for the motorway to be undertaken at some point in the future if it becomes economically and politically feasible.

== Walking and cycling infrastructure ==
In 2022, Auckland Transport and Waka Kotahi built Te Ara Ki Uta Ki Tai &quot;(the path of land and sea)&quot; in this corridor.

==Alternative proposals==

Based on this strong opposition to a major link through this area of eastern Auckland, the AMETI (Auckland-Manukau Eastern Transport Initiative) project was intended to improve the connections of this area towards the south-east (Manukau City), via less problematic routes. The new roads and public transport links were to serve intensified residential and mixed developments like the Mount Wellington Quarry area. In 2010, it was revealed that the updated AMETI plans now included much stronger bus priority proposals than before.

A significant part of AMETI emerged as the Eastern Busway project. Preliminary works for the busway began in 2018.

== Legal status ==

The designations for the Eastern Transport Corridor still exist as of 2020, and is currently held by Auckland Transport. Various proposals over the years (such as in 2006, initiated by Action Hobson) did not end in removal, partly because it was argued that the designations were needed for future proofing for the city&#x27;s growth, and also because other transport links, such as another rail track, or busways, could be needed.

<text>San Pietro di Castello (), formerly Olivolo (; ), is an island in the Venetian Lagoon, northern Italy, forming part of the Castello sestiere. It is linked to the main islands of Venice by two bridges.

==History==
The island was the site of a castle from at least the 6th century, and it is from this that the island and the sestiere are named. In the seventh century, it became the seat of the Bishop of Olivolo, later renamed Bishop of Castello. When Castello was merged into the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Venice it remained the seat of that archdiocese until 1807. The Church of San Pietro was the seat from the ninth century, while other attractions on the island include a campanile with a ring of bells in C, and the greenery of the Campo San Pietro.

<text>Macintosh File System (MFS) is a volume format (or disk file system) created by Apple Computer for storing files on 400K floppy disks. MFS was introduced with the original Apple Macintosh computer in January 1984. 

MFS is notable both for introducing resource forks to allow storage of structured data, and for storing metadata needed to support the graphical user interface of the classic Mac OS. MFS allows file names to be up to 255 characters in length, although Finder does not allow users to create names longer than 63 characters (31 characters in later versions). MFS is called a flat file system because it does not support a hierarchy of directories.

Folders exist as a concept on the original MFS-based Macintosh, but work completely differently from the way they do on modern systems. They are visible in Finder windows, but not in the open and save dialog boxes. There is always one empty folder on the volume, and if it is altered in any way (such as by adding or renaming files), a new Empty Folder appears, thus providing a way to create new folders. MFS stores all of the file and directory listing information in a single file. The Finder creates the illusion of folders, by storing all files as pairs of directory handles and file handles. To display the contents of a particular folder, MFS scans the directory for all files in that handle. There is no need to find a separate file containing the directory listing.

The Macintosh File System does not support volumes over 20 MB in size, or about 1,400 files. While this is small by today&#x27;s standards, at the time it seemed very expansive when compared to the Macintosh&#x27;s 400 KB floppy drive.

Apple introduced Hierarchical File System as a replacement for MFS in September 1985. In Mac OS 7.6.1, Apple removed support for writing to MFS volumes “as such writes often resulted in errors or system hangs”, and in Mac OS 8.0 support for MFS volumes was removed altogether. Although macOS (formerly Mac OS X) has no built-in support for MFS, an example VFS plug-in from Apple called MFSLives provides read-only access to MFS volumes.

<text>Mason Jennings is an American folk-pop singer-songwriter.

==Biography==
Born in Hawaii, Jennings moved with his family to Pittsburgh at an early age. Jennings learned to play guitar at the age of 13, when he began writing songs. Jennings later dropped out of school and moved to Minneapolis to pursue his musical career.

Jennings produced his self-titled debut album in 1997 on an analog four-track in the living room of a rented home, playing all instruments himself. In October 1998, joined by drummer Chris Stock and bassist Robert Skoro, he began a weekly gig at the 400 Bar as the Mason Jennings Band. The two-week gig ended up lasting four months. In April 1999, six months after forming, The Mason Jennings Band was voted by the 1999 &quot;Picked to Click Poll&quot; conducted by the Minneapolis-St. Paul newspaper, City Pages. Mason began touring nationally and expanded the depth of his sound by inviting saxophonist Chris Thomson to play with them occasionally and replacing Stock with Brazilian jazz drummer Edgar Olivera.

&quot;Birds Flying Away&quot; (2000) revealed his penchant for singing first-person narratives of imaginary rustic characters. Following the release of this album, Noah Levy took over drumming duties from Olivera. In 2002, Jennings released a studio album, &quot;Century Spring&quot;, and a &quot;fans only&quot; collection of acoustic songs, &quot;Simple Life.&quot; Jennings released all three discs – and re-released his earlier albums – on his homebrew record label, Architect Records.

In 2003, Skoro and Levy left the band and were replaced by bassist Chris Morrissey (Bill Mike Band) and drummer Brian McLeod. On February 10, 2004, Jennings released &quot;Use Your Voice&quot;, which notably included the songs &quot;Keepin&#x27; It Real,&quot; ostensibly written at the request of &quot;Shrek 2&quot; producers (but not used in the film), and &quot;The Ballad of Paul and Sheila,&quot; an acoustic dirge for late Minnesota senator Paul Wellstone. On September 30 of that year, the band released a DVD entitled &quot;Use Your Van&quot;, which chronicled the recording of &quot;Use Your Voice&quot; and part of the promotional tour. The DVD was filmed by Andy Grund.

On June 17, 2005, Jennings signed with Glacial Pace, a subsidiary of Sony&#x27;s Epic Records headed by Modest Mouse frontman Isaac Brock. Minnesota&#x27;s &quot;Star Tribune&quot; credited Brock with convincing Jennings to sign after Mason Jennings had opened for several Modest Mouse shows in 2004. Jennings had long avoided the major labels, citing desires to maintain creative control and dodge big-label politics. Glacial Pace is now an independent label.

Jennings recorded his sixth album, &quot;Boneclouds&quot;, at Pachyderm Studio in Cannon Falls, Minnesota, with producer Noah Georgeson. The album was released on May 16, 2006, by Glacial Pace. Soon thereafter, bassist Chris Morrisey left the band. Accompanying Jennings was new bassist Arabella Kauffmann and Brian McLeod on drums. Jennings sang two Bob Dylan songs which Christian Bale lip-synched in the movie &quot;I&#x27;m Not There&quot; (released in November 2007 in the U.S.): &quot;The Times They Are a-Changin&#x27;&quot; and &quot;The Lonesome Death of Hattie Carroll.&quot;

In early 2008 Jennings signed with Jack Johnson&#x27;s record label, Brushfire Records. Jennings released &quot;In the Ever&quot; in May 2008. The title was inspired by his son referring to where he was before he was born as, &quot;In the ever&quot;. Jennings and Johnson met at Gustavus Adolphus College&#x27;s Earth Jam in 2001 when Jennings was scheduled as Johnson&#x27;s opening act. Jennings announced at the Elemental Experience Music &amp; Arts Festival in San Diego, California on May 2, 2009, that he would be releasing a new album (later entitled Blood of Man) in summer 2009. He also mentioned that he would have music on the soundtrack for the documentary &quot;180° South&quot;. The documentary was released in March 2010.

On September 15, 2009, &quot;Blood of Man&quot; was released on CD and vinyl format. A free bonus EP titled Independent (containing the tracks &quot;Mark My Heart With Ashes&quot; and &quot;Wide Open Country&quot;) was distributed with the album at independent record stores. A week before the official CD release, a version of the album containing the exclusive track &quot;Waves&quot; was made available exclusively on iTunes. The album received a 4 star review in Rolling Stone.

In late 2010, &quot;Live at First Ave.&quot;, his first live album ever, was released. In 2010, Jennings released &quot;The Flood&quot;. This album was made up of songs he had recorded in the 1990s on a cassette tape. Jennings rediscovered these songs and re-recorded them in a stripped down fashion to stay true to their intent. In 2011, he released &quot;Minnesota&quot;, his first new album of original songs since 2009&#x27;s &quot;Blood of Man&quot;. On November 12, 2013, he released &quot;Always Been&quot;. The first single from the album was &quot;Lonely Street&quot;, followed by &quot;Wilderness&quot;. He released &quot;Wild Dark Metal&quot; in 2016. He got divorced from Amy Turany. After taking some time off to focus on painting and recovering from depression and agoraphobia he began touring again. He married Josie Jennings in 2018 and released an album of love songs inspired by their relationship on May 11, 2018, called &quot;Songs From When We Met&quot;.

Jennings started a new project called Painted Shield with Pearl Jam guitarist Stone Gossard in 2014. Their long-awaited album was released November 27, 2020.

Jennings has been honored with a star on the outside mural of the Minneapolis nightclub First Avenue, recognizing performers that have played sold-out shows or have otherwise demonstrated a major contribution to the culture at the iconic venue. Receiving a star &quot;might be the most prestigious public honor an artist can receive in Minneapolis,&quot; according to journalist Steve Marsh.

<text>The Athens Olympic Aquatic Centre is a complex at the Athens Olympic Sports Complex in Marousi, Athens, Greece, consisting of two outdoor pools and one indoor pool, that was built for the 1991 Mediterranean Games. It was refurbished and expanded for the 2004 Summer Olympics and the 2004 Summer Paralympics. The larger of the two outdoor pools, which seats 11,500 spectators, hosted swimming and water polo events. The smaller pool, which hosted synchronized swimming, had the capacity for 5.300 people. The indoor pool also hosted the water polo, diving and the swimming during the Paralympics had capacity for another 6.300 persons.

The outdoor pool was the subject of significant controversy during the run-up to the Olympic Games. At the bidding process, the Bidding Committee and the Greek Government promised that the outdoor pools would gain cover to meet the necessary conditions requested by FINA at the time. But, due to the inflation of the Game&#x27;s works and the constant delays, it was decided that the planned coverage would have to wait for later, which until 2024 has not happened. According to preliminary assessments, the roof would serve to protect both athletes and spectators from the scorching sun and summer heat of Athens, which were even worse in the pools because of their location in the west. However, this ended up not happening because of inflated costs and constant delays in other works that were more urgent and there is no option, FINA approved the holding of events in outdoor pools that received temporary bleachers to reach the minimum required capacity these bleachers were higher than the fixed ones and provided shade for the outdoor pools and other areas of the complex, but not for the present public.

Since 2005, outdoor pools have been used to host swimming programs during the period between the late spring to the early winter. During the high winter period, the programs were held in the indoor pools.

In 2024, the two outdoor pools remain wide open to the sky.

Unfortunately, after the games, the city did not have any legacy plans to the venue. The last master plan dated back to 1985 for the 1991 Mediterranean Games and the next one was adopted in 2014, so they did not get the most out of the opportunity. It is known that the dynamics of cities have been strongly influenced by late 20th-century economic globalization. Hosting the 2004 Summer Olympics at this existent aquatic center has helped Athens&#x27;s economic growth and helped enhance the globalization of the urban areas. The aquatic center got many upgrades as well, which they made to ensure that the looks were up to date with global standards. Athens Olympic Aquatic Centre for the 2004 Olympics had a contract with the company PICO to supply the overlays to every Olympic center that was hosting the Olympic games. 

The Aquatic Centre needed many service overlays, tents, and stations to host all of the behind-the-scenes portions of the 2004 Summer Olympics. This insured that the cameramen had the perfect locations to film, the security had tents and barricades set up so people could not sneak in, and insured the looks of the aquatic center were looking the best. They supplied nearly 1000 flag and banner poles, hanging up a variety of countries&#x27; flags and more.

<text>The Athens Olympic Tennis Centre is a grouping of 16 tennis courts at the Athens Olympic Sports Complex, in Marousi, Athens, Greece. The centre consists of a main stadium, known as [[Athens Olympic Tennis Centre Main Court|The Main Court]], seating 8,600 fans - though only 6,000 seats were made publicly available during the 2004 Summer Olympics and 2004 Summer Paralympics- two semifinal courts, seating 4,300 spectators - though only 3,200 seats were made publicly available during the Olympics - and thirteen side courts, seating 200 observers each.

Each of the courts use the DecoTurf cushioned acrylic surface, the same surface as the U.S. Open Grand Slam event. The Main Court, in particular, is extremely large by the standards of major tennis competitions, with the seats being relatively far removed from the tennis court.

==History==
The centre hosted the tennis matches at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece. The centre was completed in February 2004, and officially opened on 2 August 2004.

In 2017, the Greek Basket League club, AEK Athens, revealed their plans to acquire the Main Court facility, in order to transform it into their home indoor basketball hall, with a spectator capacity for basketball games, of 9,500-10,000 seats.

<text>The Athens Olympic Velodrome is a velodrome stadium that is located in Marousi, Athens, Greece, at the Athens Olympic Sports Complex. The venue, which have the capacity for 5,250 people, but only 3,300 seats were used due to the security measures available for the 2004 Summer Olympic Games and the 2004 Summer Paralympics. It has distinctive twin roofs, covering the stands on each side.

==History==
The Velodrome was originally between 1989 and 1991 as an outdoor venue to host the 1991 Mediterranean Games.
However, the original planning for the 2004 Summer Olympics did not include any renovations to the velodrome or even a roof.But as soon after the Atlanta Games in 1996, the UCI found that the weather conditions interfered directly in the tests, it was decided that from Sydney 2000, the Olympic tests would have to be in covered velodromes and there was a need for a general reform in the place that lbe gave a more modern track and a controversial ceiling in order to host the track cycling events at the 2004 Athens Summer Olympics and track cycling events at the 2004 Summer Paralympics. The project was designed by the Spanish architect Santiago Calatrava who added a roof to harmonize with the Olympic Stadium and the projected swimming outdoor pools ceiling. The track, made of Afzelia wood, is long and wide. Reconstruction of the stadium was completed on May 30, 2004, and it was officially re-opened on July 30, 2004.

In September 2023 the venue was shut down due to the findings of a study that showed that the roof was not meeting the safety requirements.

<doc id="927752" wikidata="Q1071337" url="?curid=927752" title="HFS Plus">
<text>HFS Plus or HFS+ (also known as Mac OS Extended or HFS Extended) is a journaling file system developed by Apple Inc. It replaced the Hierarchical File System (HFS) as the primary file system of Apple computers with the 1998 release of Mac OS 8.1. HFS+ continued as the primary Mac OS X file system until it was itself replaced with the Apple File System (APFS), released with macOS High Sierra in 2017. HFS+ is also one of the formats supported by the iPod digital music player. 

Compared to its predecessor HFS, also called &quot;Mac OS Standard&quot; or &quot;HFS Standard,&quot; HFS Plus supports much larger files (block addresses are 32-bit length instead of 16-bit) and using Unicode (instead of Mac OS Roman or any of several other character sets) for naming items. Like HFS, HFS Plus uses B-trees to store most volume metadata, but unlike most file systems that support hard links, HFS Plus supports hard links to directories. HFS Plus permits filenames up to 255 characters in length, and n-forked files similar to NTFS, though until 2005 almost no system software took advantage of forks other than the data fork and resource fork. HFS Plus also uses a full 32-bit allocation mapping table rather than HFS&#x27;s 16 bits, improving the use of space on large disks.

== History ==
Codenamed &quot;Sequoia&quot; in development, HFS+ was introduced with the January 19, 1998, release of Mac OS 8.1.

With the release of the Mac OS X 10.2.2 update on November 11, 2002, Apple added optional journaling features to HFS Plus for improved data reliability. These features were accessible through the GUI, using the Disk Utility application in Mac OS X Server, but only accessible through the command line in the standard desktop client.

With Mac OS X v10.3, all HFS Plus volumes on all Macs were set to be journaled by default. Within the system, an HFS Plus volume with a journal is identified as &quot;HFSJ&quot;.

Mac OS X 10.3 also introduced another version of HFS Plus called &quot;HFSX&quot;. HFSX volumes are almost identical to HFS Plus volumes, except that they are never surrounded by the HFS Wrapper that is typical of HFS Plus volumes and they optionally support case sensitivity for file and folder names. HFSX volumes can be recognized by two entries in the Volume Header, a value of HX in the signature field and 5 in the version field.

Mac OS X 10.3 also marked Apple&#x27;s adoption of Unicode 3.2 decomposition, superseding the Unicode 2.1 decomposition used previously. This change caused problems for developers writing software for Mac OS X. 

Mac OS X 10.3 introduced a number of techniques that are intended to avoid fragmentating files in HFS+.

With Mac OS X 10.4, Apple added support for Inline Attribute Data records, something that had been a part of the Mac OS X implementation of HFS Plus since at least 10.0, but always marked as &quot;reserved for future use&quot;. Until the release of Mac OS X Server 10.4, HFS Plus supported only the standard UNIX file system permissions; however, 10.4 introduced support for access control list–based file security, which provides a richer mechanism to define file permissions and is also designed to be fully compatible with the file permission models on other platforms such as Microsoft Windows XP and Windows Server 2003.

In Mac OS X Leopard 10.5, directory hard-linking was added as a fundamental part of Time Machine.

In Mac OS X Snow Leopard 10.6, HFS+ compression was added using Deflate (Zlib). In open source and some other areas this is referred to as AppleFSCompression or decmpfs. Compressed data may be stored in either an extended attribute or the resource fork. When using non-Apple APIs, AppleFSCompression is not always completely transparent. OS X 10.9 introduced two new algorithms: LZVN (libFastCompression), and LZFSE.

In Mac OS X Lion 10.7, logical volume encryption (known as FileVault 2) was added to the operating system. This addition to the operating system in no way changed the logical structure of the file system. Apple&#x27;s logical volume manager is known as Core Storage and its encryption at the volume level can apply to file systems other than HFS Plus. With appropriate hardware, both encryption and decryption should be transparent.

== Design ==
HFS Plus volumes are divided into sectors (called logical blocks in HFS), that are usually 512 bytes in size. These sectors are then grouped together into allocation blocks which can contain one or more sectors; the number of allocation blocks depends on the total size of the volume. HFS Plus uses a larger value to address allocation blocks than HFS, 32 bits rather than 16 bits; this means it can access 4,294,967,296 (= 232) allocation blocks rather than the 65,536 (= 216) allocation blocks available to HFS. When disks were small, this was of little consequence, but as larger-capacity drives became available, it meant that the smallest amount of space that any file could occupy (a single allocation block) became excessively large, wasting significant amounts of space. For example, on a 1 GB disk, the allocation block size under HFS is 16 KB, so even a 1-byte file would take up 16 KB of disk space. HFS Plus&#x27;s system greatly improves space utilization on larger disks as a result.

File and folder names in HFS Plus are also encoded in UTF-16 and normalized to a form very nearly the same as Unicode Normalization Form D (NFD) (which means that precomposed characters like &quot;å&quot; are decomposed in the HFS+ filename and therefore count as two code units and UTF-16 implies that characters from outside the Basic Multilingual Plane also count as two code units in an HFS+ filename). HFS Plus permits filenames up to 255 UTF-16 code units in length.

Formerly, HFS Plus volumes were embedded inside an HFS standard file system. This was phased out by the Tiger transition to Intel Macs, where the HFS Plus file system was not embedded inside a wrapper. The wrapper had been designed for two purposes; it allowed Macintosh computers without HFS Plus support in their ROM to boot HFS Plus volumes and it also was designed to help users transition to HFS Plus by including a minimal HFS volume with a read-only file called &quot;Where_have_all_my_files_gone?&quot;, explaining to users with versions of Mac OS 8.0 and earlier without HFS Plus, that the volume requires a system with HFS Plus support. The original HFS volume contains a signature and an offset to the embedded HFS Plus volume within its volume header. All allocation blocks in the HFS volume which contain the embedded volume are mapped out of the HFS allocation file as &quot;bad blocks&quot;.

Notable among file systems used for Unix systems, HFS Plus does not support sparse files.

There are nine structures that make up a typical HFS Plus volume:

# Sectors 0 and 1 of the volume are HFS boot blocks. These are identical to the boot blocks in an HFS volume. They are part of the HFS wrapper.
# Sector 2 contains the &quot;Volume Header&quot;, which is equivalent to the Master Directory Block in an HFS volume. The Volume Header stores a wide variety of data about the volume itself, for example the size of allocation blocks, a timestamp that indicates when the volume was created or the location of other volume structures such as the Catalog File or Extent Overflow File. The Volume Header is always located in the same place.
# The &quot;Allocation File&quot; which keeps track of which allocation blocks are free and which are in use. It is similar to the Volume Bitmap in HFS, in which each allocation block is represented by one bit. A zero means the block is free and a one means the block is in use. The main difference with the HFS Volume Bitmap, is that the Allocation File is stored as a regular file – it does not occupy a special reserved space near the beginning of the volume. The Allocation File can also change size and does not have to be stored contiguously within a volume.
# The &quot;Catalog File&quot; is a B-tree that contains records for all the files and directories stored in the volume. The HFS Plus Catalog File is very similar to the HFS Catalog File, the main differences being records are larger to allow more fields and to allow for those fields to be larger (for example to allow the longer 255-character unicode file names in HFS Plus). A record in the HFS Catalog File is 512 bytes in size; a record in the HFS Plus Catalog File is 4 KB in the classic Mac OS and 8 KB in macOS. Fields in HFS are of fixed size, while in HFS Plus the size can vary depending on the actual size of the data they store.
# The &quot;Extents Overflow File&quot; is another B-tree that records the allocation blocks that are allocated to each file as extents. Each file record in the Catalog File is capable of recording eight extents for each fork of a file; once those are used additional extents are recorded in the Extents Overflow File. Bad blocks are also recorded as extents in the Extents Overflow File. The default size of an extent record in the classic Mac OS is 1 KB and 4 KB in macOS.
# The &quot;Attributes File&quot; is a new B-tree in HFS Plus that does not have a corresponding structure in HFS. The Attributes File can store three different types of 4 KB records: &quot;Inline Data Attribute&quot; records, &quot;Fork Data Attribute&quot; records and &quot;Extension Attribute&quot; records. Inline Data Attribute records store small attributes that can fit within the record itself. Fork Data Attribute records contain references to a maximum of eight extents that can hold larger attributes. Extension Attributes are used to extend a Fork Data Attribute record when its eight extent records are already used.
# The &quot;Startup File&quot; is designed for non-Mac OS systems that lack HFS or HFS Plus support. It is similar to the Boot Blocks of an HFS volume.
# The second-to-last sector contains the &quot;Alternate Volume Header&quot;, which is equivalent to the Alternate Master Directory Block of HFS. This is the second-to-last-sector for the disk, not the volume; if the disk is larger than the volume, the AVH will be outside the range of the filesystem.
# The last sector in the volume is reserved for use by Apple. It is used during the computer manufacturing process.

== Criticisms ==
HFS Plus lacks several features considered staples of modern file systems like ZFS and NTFS. Data checksums are the most routinely cited missing feature.

Besides checksumming, features of modern file systems that HFS+ lacks include:
* nanosecond timestamps
* concurrent access (that is, more than one process can access the filesystem at the same time)
* snapshotting
* Support for dates beyond February 6, 2040
* sparse file support
* a better implementation of hard links (in other filesystems, these are typically multiple directory entries pointing to the same data blocks; hard links in macOS are implemented as small files that are stored in a special hidden directory)

HFS Plus was not designed for Unix-like systems, so features such as file system permissions and hard links had to be retrofitted when Apple moved to Mac OS X.

== Other operating systems ==

=== Linux ===
The Linux kernel includes the hfsplus module for mounting HFS+ filesystems read-write. HFS+ fsck and mkfs have been ported to Linux and are part of the hfsprogs package.

In 2009, these drivers were diagnosed to be corrupting HFS+ drives with a capacity greater than 2 TB. Consequently, Linux distributions such as Debian and Ubuntu stopped allowing mounting of HFS+ drives or partitions greater than 2 TB. , work is in progress to lift this restriction. 

Under Linux&#x27;s current HFS+ driver, journaling must be disabled in order to write data safely onto an HFS+ partition. Provided the partition isn&#x27;t being used by Apple&#x27;s Time Machine software, journaling can be disabled under macOS: Using Disk Utility in OS X Yosemite, the user may hold Alt/Option and click &quot;Disable Journaling&quot; on the File menu, having first selected a mounted partition.

An HFS+ partition with journaling enabled may be forcibly mounted with write access under Linux, but this is unsupported and unwise.

A Google Summer of Code project to implement write support to journaled HFS+ was accepted by the Linux Foundation in 2011 but was not completed at that time and is still a work in progress. Progress and improvements to the HFS+ driver, including some updates to journaling support, are posted on the linux-fsdevel mailing list from time to time.

, Paragon Software Group provided kernel drivers that allow full read-write access to HFS+ journaled volumes. The product is a proprietary implementation of HFS+ based on Paragon&#x27;s proprietary UFSD library. There are both free and paid editions of the driver, and they include a utility for checking and repairing HFS+ volumes. According to the online documentation (free version or the paid edition), both the free edition and the paid edition currently support Linux kernels from 2.6.36 up to 4.12.x. Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora Linux, Rocky Linux, Red Hat Enterprise Linux, OpenSUSE and CentOS are the only Linux distributions officially supported.

=== Windows ===
As of May 2012, Apple has only released read-only HFS+ drivers for Windows XP, Windows Vista, and Windows 7 as part of the Boot Camp software in Mac OS X 10.6. This means users on these systems can read data on the HFS+ drive, but not write to them. Microsoft has created an HFS+ driver for the Xbox 360 mainly for the purpose of reading HFS+-formatted iPods.

A free and opensource software – jHFSplus, based on HFSExplorer and jpfm – can be used to mount hfs/hfs+ partitions as read-only virtual folders.

A freeware plugin for Total Commander exists, that can read, among others, HFS and HFS+ filesystems.

DiskInternals Linux Reader can be used to extract/save folders/files out of HFS and HFS+ Hard Drives/Partitions.

A commercial product, MacDrive, is also available for mounting HFS and HFS+ drives, optical discs, and other media in Windows Explorer, and allows both reading and writing to the volume, as well as repairing and formatting Mac disks.

A commercial product, Paragon&#x27;s HFS+ for Windows allows full read and write and disk management from all versions of Windows from Windows XP to Windows Server 2008.

=== Cross-platform ===
A free (GPL) alternative is HFSExplorer written by Erik Larsson. HFSExplorer is a Java application for viewing and extracting files from an HFS+ volume (Mac OS Extended) or an HFSX volume (Mac OS Extended, Case-sensitive). The volume can be located either on a physical disk, in various Apple disk image and sparse disk image formats, or a raw file system dump. However, HFSExplorer is a read-only solution; it cannot write to HFS-formatted volumes.

<text>The Warsaw concentration camp (; see other names) was a German concentration camp in occupied Poland during World War II. It was formed on the base of the now-nonexistent Gęsiówka prison, in what is today the Warsaw neighbourhood of Muranów, on the order of Reichsführer-SS Heinrich Himmler. The camp operated from July 1943 to August 1944.

Located in the ruins of the Warsaw Ghetto, Warschau first functioned as a camp in its own right, but was demoted to a branch of the Majdanek concentration camp in May 1944. In late July that year, due to the Red Army approaching Warsaw, the Nazis started to evacuate the camp. Around 4,000 inmates were forced to march on foot to Kutno, away; those who survived were then transported to Dachau. On 5 August 1944, KL Warschau was captured by Battalion Zośka during the Warsaw Uprising, liberating 348 Jews who were still left on its premises. It was the only German camp in Poland to be liberated by anti-Nazi resistance forces, rather than by Allied troops. After the Red Army definitively expelled the Germans from Warsaw in January 1945, the new communist administration continued to run the buildings as a forced labour camp, and then as a prison, until it was closed in 1956. All the camp&#x27;s premises were demolished in 1965.

The &quot;Encyclopedia on Camps and Ghettos&quot; says that a total of 8,000 to 9,000 inmates were held there, while Bogusław Kopka estimates the number at at least 7,250 prisoners, all but 300 of whom were Jews from various European countries, in particular from Hungary and Greece. The Jewish inmates were used as forced labour to clean the ruins of the Warsaw Ghetto, with the ultimate goal of creating a park in the former ghetto&#x27;s area. They also had to find and sort whatever precious items were still left on its territory. The camp and adjacent ruins were additionally used by the German administration as a place of execution, the victims being Polish political prisoners, Jews caught on the &quot;Aryan side&quot;, and generally people rounded up on the streets of Warsaw. About 4,000 to 5,000 prisoners died during the camp&#x27;s existence, while the total number of people murdered in the camp is estimated at 20,000.

The camp played a comparatively minor role in the Holocaust and thus seldom appears in mainstream historiography. However, it has been at the centre of a conspiracy theory, first promoted by Maria Trzcińska, a Polish judge who served for 22 years as a member of the Chief Commission for the Prosecution of Crimes against the Polish Nation. The theory, refuted by mainstream historians, contends that KL Warschau was an extermination camp operating a giant gas chamber inside a tunnel near Warszawa Zachodnia railroad station and that 200,000 mainly non-Jewish Poles were gassed there.

== Name ==

During the first nine months, the Warsaw concentration camp functioned in its own right. At this time it carried the official name of (often referred to as for short in Nazi documents and in Polish scholarship, or, in most contemporary German-language works, ). In May 1944, became a branch of Majdanek concentration camp, so the camp&#x27;s name changed to . It was also sometimes referred to in German sources as .

The name (IPA: ) often appears in Polish sources. This is due to the fact that the camp occupied the complex of now non-existent , which were relatively well-preserved after the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising. The caserns, at the corner of then-existing Gęsia and Zamenhof streets, were a military prison before World War II. During German occupation, they accommodated the central prison for the Jewish district, the , as well as the . The prison complex became colloquially known as (named for Gęsia street), which nickname transferred to as well. Supporters of the Trzcińska&#x27;s theory tend to prefer the German name, which Aleksandra Ubertowska says has to do with the name being perceived as more serious.

After World War II, the camp, although with changed purposes, was still run by Communist authorities under other names (see the relevant section for details).

==Creation==

According to Bogusław Kopka, the first person behind the idea of creating a new concentration camp in Warsaw was Heinrich Himmler, head of the &quot;Schutzstaffel&quot; (SS), who mentioned it in a letter dated 9 October 1942. The letter informed the local posts of SS and the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; in the General Government that all Jewish craftsmen who so far had managed to avoid deportation to extermination camps were to be &quot;assembled by SS-&quot;Obergruppenführer&quot; Krüger and SS-&quot;Obergruppenführer&quot; Pohl on the spot, i.e. in the concentration camps in Warsaw and Lublin&quot;. The two camps were also intended to host Jewish labourers, who were supposed to be working for weapons factories operating on-site; as for production facilities, they were planned to be successively moved to concentration camps near Lublin, and then farther east. Himmler assumed that concentrating all Jewish labour in the camps controlled by the SS Main Economic and Administrative Office (SS-WVHA) would be the basis for the creation of an SS economic empire in the East. His ideas, however, were met with resistance from the military, the police and civil administration of the General Government, as well as from the Reich Ministry of Armaments and War Production and from German companies using Jewish slave labour. Himmler was thus unable to bring his idea to fruition, so the concentration camp in Warsaw did not appear, nor did all factories using Jewish labour become controlled by SS.

As plans to demolish the Warsaw Ghetto appeared, Himmler soon returned to the idea of creating a concentration camp in Warsaw. In a letter dated 16 February 1943, Himmler instructed SS-&quot;Obergruppenführer&quot; Oswald Pohl, head of SS-WVHA, to create a concentration camp in the &quot;Jewish district&quot; and ordered all German-owned private enterprises operating in the Ghetto to be relocated there. The camp, together with its enterprises and inhabitants, was planned to be &quot;transported as quickly as possible to Lublin and nearby areas&quot;. On the same day, Himmler also wrote a letter to SS- Friedrich-Wilhelm Krüger, Higher SS and police leader for the General Government, which demanded that the buildings of the deserted ghetto be demolished after the concentration camp was transported to Lublin. The task of demolition, it was suggested, was to be handed over to the local Jews. The idea&#x27;s implementation was marred with numerous difficulties, so when the Germans decided to accelerate the deportations on 19 April, they met strong resistance from the Jews, who began the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising. The concentration camp failed to materialise again, and only part of the enterprises, together with some of the Jews, were evacuated to the concentration camps in Majdanek, Trawniki, and Poniatowa.

The idea of the camp was revived once again after the failure of the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising. SS-&quot;Brigadeführer&quot; Jürgen Stroop, who led the efforts aimed at quashing the insurgency, proposed on 16 May 1943, the day the uprising came to an end, to convert the Pawiak prison to a concentration camp. The building was previously used by the SD and the &quot;Sicherheitspolizei&quot; (Security Police). It is suggested that by creating such a camp, the Germans wanted to destroy evidence of the crimes committed during the suppression of the uprising as well as to enrich themselves by the loot that would be collected in the rubble by slave labourers. Himmler agreed to the proposal and issued the order, which read:

Eventually, Pawiak&#x27;s status as a prison did not change, but the concentration camp was created on nearby Gęsia street, which was also located inside the Ghetto walls. One of the reasons why was chosen was because it was among the only buildings left intact in the area previously occupied by the Ghetto. In addition to that, Bogusław Kopka argues that its position within a deserted area with restricted access to civilians was also a factor. Another advantage was the camp&#x27;s proximity to the warehouses at &quot;Umschlagplatz&quot; as well as German militarised units: an SS outpost on street, a strong German army command at street and the staff of the Pawiak prison, all of whom could be quickly dispatched in case of mutiny.

On 19 July 1943, the first 300 prisoners, who were German and predominantly criminals, were transported from Buchenwald concentration camp. This date is considered to be the day when started operation.

== Description ==


=== Location and facilities ===

The Warsaw concentration camp was created inside a closed and deserted zone of the former ghetto, which was surrounded by walls regularly patrolled by German guards and the police. , a former military prison, and spaces along Gęsia Street were adapted for the purposes of the camp. Since none of the camp&#x27;s buildings survived, its general appearance and facilities can only be deduced from witness testimony, aerial photography, and photos made during exhumations and after the camp&#x27;s liberation. According to the evidence, was divided into two parts. The first, called and also known as &quot;the old camp&quot;, was located between what is now and , and comprised proper (the camp&#x27;s easternmost part) and wooden barracks erected during the initial months of the camp&#x27;s operation. The camp&#x27;s second part, between Smocza and Okopowa Streets, was called or &quot;the new camp&quot; and contained brick barracks. In total, 21 barracks were built, each around long with a capacity of 600 inmates.
The camp was surrounded by high walls guarded by watchtowers. The main entrance was located at what was then Gęsia Street 24. The former military prison and seat, at what is today 17a, served as a crematorium for bodies of dead inmates and executed civilians from outside the camp. The Germans also started building two other cremation sites, but did not manage to open them before they evacuated the camp; even the one that existed was not operated in the camp&#x27;s final days. Additionally, one of Gęsiówka&#x27;s buildings was used as a torture room, while a prison yard came to be an SS officers&#x27; mess. A bathhouse was built in late 1943 and early 1944, and bunkers were also available on-site. By February 1944, the camp&#x27;s infrastructure was in an advanced stage of completion, with 90% of and 75% of finished (Berenstein gives figures of 95% and 60%, respectively). However, the construction was repeatedly halted due to the recurring typhus epidemic, which decimated the inmate population and forced the camp&#x27;s administration to quarantine the premises twice (in January and February 1944, see below, and again in April and May). Therefore, work on the camp was only completed in June 1944.

=== Personnel ===
Initially, about 380 SS soldiers were maintaining the concentration camp, approximately the size of a company. The number of SS guards was relatively low, as the former ghetto, itself a closed zone, was surrounded by patrolled walls, and due to the fact that the prisoner functionaries were Germans from the initial transport and were thus delegated much more power than was usual for their counterparts in other camps. The original SS unit was gathered from various other camps, including the Trawniki concentration camp and the Sachsenhausen concentration camp. Following the attachment to Majdanek in May 1944, they were replaced with SS personnel from Lublin, and the guard was reduced to 259 people. Leadership positions were occupied by high- and middle-ranking SS members who were pre-war Third Reich citizens (&quot;Reichsdeutsche&quot;), while the rank-and-file were usually recruited among the &quot;Volksdeutsche&quot;, mainly from Southeast Europe but also from other areas.

In comparison with other concentration camps, KL Warschau had a less sophisticated internal structure. Bogusław Kopka writes that the camp lacked the political department (&quot;Politische Abteilung&quot;), and some other positions remained unoccupied. Conversely, the Institute of National Remembrance&#x27;s report on the investigation of the crimes committed in KL Warschau says that the &quot;Politische Abteilung&quot; did exist, but it was directly subordinate to the commandant of &quot;Sicherheitsdienst&quot; and &quot;Sicherheitspolizei&quot; in Warsaw, instead of being the main department of the camp&#x27;s administration. Among the 208 identified members of the camp&#x27;s administration, SS- Karl Leuckel was the director of the administrative department, SS-&quot;Oberscharführer&quot; was the &quot;Rapportführer&quot; and the person responsible for prisoner work management, while SS- and SS- were camp doctors. The camp&#x27;s staff was subordinate to SS-WVHA, but it also was obliged to cooperate closely with the SS and police leader for the Warsaw District due to an agreement reached between the two SS institutions. The coordination was particularly strong during the pacification that happened at the turn of 1943/44, which was targeted at the Polish population of the capital.

There were three concentration camp commandants () in the course of the camp&#x27;s history:
* SS-&quot;Obersturmbannführer&quot; Wilhelm Göcke served until September 1943, when he was transferred to the newly created concentration camp in Kaunas in Generalbezirk Litauen;
* SS-&quot;Hauptsturmführer&quot; Nikolaus Herbet commanded the camp from September or October 1943 until his arrest in late April 1944;
* SS-&quot;Obersturmführer&quot; Friedrich Wilhelm Ruppert was appointed in May 1944 and dismissed in late June the same year.

As for the &quot;Schutzhaftlagerführer&quot;, who was simultaneously the camp director and the chief of the guards, SS-&quot;Obersturmführer&quot; served in this role from &#x27;s creation until his arrest in late April 1944, while SS-&quot;Unterscharführer&quot; occupied the position for the remainder of the camp&#x27;s existence.

The Warsaw concentration camp usually featured SS officers who were deemed to be low-value workers. The first two commandants exhibited incompetence and little interest in the functioning of the camp. Many of the &quot;Volksdeutsche&quot; were hardly able to speak German, while some were illiterate. Corruption was rampant and extended up to the apex of the camp&#x27;s hierarchy, which Andreas Mix attributes to the fact that like the senior SS officers, the kapos were Germans, therefore, the SS officers frequently made illicit agreements with them. The irregularities were so numerous that SS authorities eventually intervened. Mix suggests an escape of a &quot;Reichsdeutsche&quot; prisoner triggered this intervention.

In late April 1944, Commandant Nikolaus Herbet, &quot;Schutzhaftlagerführer&quot; Wilhelm Härtel as well as &quot;Lagerälteste&quot; (camp supervisor) , were all arrested. The whole command of the camp was dissolved and almost all of its members were relieved of duty. By early May, the guards who were until then performing their duties in Warsaw were transported to Sachsenhausen and were replaced by personnel delegated from Majdanek. This scandal coincided with the degradation of the status of to a subcamp of Majdanek on 1 May 1944, and was thus renamed &quot;Lublin concentration camp – Warsaw labour camp&quot;. According to some sources, it came due to deportations of prisoners to other camps as well as the advances of the Soviet army towards the territory of the General Government. Bogusław Kopka, Andreas Mix and Paweł Wieczorek write, however, that it was the corruption scandal that was the causative agent for the change in status, though, as the former two historians say, the camp&#x27;s reorganisation failed to get rid of the corruption issues.

=== Prisoners ===

==== General information ====
The trait that distinguished the Warsaw concentration camp from the other ones was that, with the exception of the initial transport of 300 Germans, the inmates were uniformly Jewish. Additionally, only accepted prisoners who were previously in concentration camps under the jurisdiction of SS-WVHA; in contrast, it did not accept those prisoners who were to serve in concentration camps due to a decision of the Reich Security Main Office (RSHA), local Security Police outposts, or new prisoners. These were predominantly young males (under 40 years old), whom the Germans deemed to be suitable for demanding physical work. Only in the last days of the camp&#x27;s existence was a group of Jewish women from the nearby Pawiak prison delivered to . The Nazis were trying to transport Jews from various European countries and specifically sought to exclude Polish-speaking Jews, hoping that the lack of knowledge of Polish would prevent them from communicating with the residents of Warsaw. Therefore, few Polish Jews were detained at the Warsaw concentration camp.

The first inmates, who previously were German prisoners in the Buchenwald concentration camp, arrived on 19 July 1943. Among these 300 people, 224 were professional criminals (, or for short), 41 were deemed political prisoners, and 35 were considered &quot;asocial&quot;. They became prisoner functionaries, such as kapos and (block supervisors). Walter Wawrzyniak got hold of the chief position of camp supervisor (). Most of the German kapo prisoners, in particular those imprisoned as criminals, intimidated fellow Jewish inmates and acted towards them with cruelty, seeing them as expendable; though, as Gabriel Finder argues, this was not in most cases due to inherent anti-Semitism but rather due to the fact such violence granted them survival. Unlike in most other Nazi camps, Jewish kapos were absent from the camp and there is little evidence an internal hierarchy among Jewish prisoners has ever developed.

The first transport of Jewish prisoners arrived from Auschwitz-Birkenau on 31 August 1943, and three subsequent ones were made up to 27 November the same year, bringing 3,683 Jews in total, according to official data. The labourers represented Jews from various countries – the most numerous were Greek Salonican Jews, but some Austrian, Belgian, French, Dutch, German and even 50 Polish representatives of that religion (who only came because Germans had to meet 1,000 people transport quota) arrived to Warsaw as well. The ethnic composition changed substantially in spring 1944, when several trains from Auschwitz delivered 3,000 Hungarian Jews (most of whom originally were deported from ghettos in Mukachevo, Uzhhorod, Khust and Tiachiv, then in Hungarian-occupied Carpathian Ruthenia) who became the majority in the Warsaw concentration camp in the last months of its existence.
The exact number of prisoners who went through KL Warschau remains difficult to ascertain, as witness and expert estimates vary from 1,500 to 40,000. As Gabriel N. Finder noted, the Warsaw concentration camp played a minor role in the Holocaust in comparison to other camps and is thus often absent from standard narratives of the period. In his entry in the &quot;Encyclopedia of Camps and Ghettos&quot;, he suggested that some 8,000–9,000 people were incarcerated there. Bogusław Kopka says in his monograph that at least 7,250 inmates went through the Warsaw concentration camp, including 300 German prisoner functionaries, about 3,700 Jews who arrived in 1943 and 3,000 Jews who came in 1944 from Auschwitz, in addition to 50 highly skilled Jews sent to the camp by the Ostbahn railway company in 1943 and 200 Jews moved from the Pawiak prison. Successful escapes were rare and Jews who were caught in the attempt were hanged in front of the assembled prisoner population.

==== Tasks ====
Prisoners were tasked with constructing the concentration camp they were residing in, demolishing the remaining ruins of the ghetto, clearing of rubble and with flattening the terrain at above the previous ground level, so as to convert the former ghetto into a park as Himmler envisaged in his order from 11 June 1943. While doing that, the workers were also ordered to salvage building materials (mainly scrap metal and bricks) for the German war effort. of buildings were demolished, which yielded some 8,105 tonnes of metal (of which about 7,300 tonnes of ferrous scrap metals and 805 tonnes of non-ferrous metals) and 34 million bricks. A separate search team was formed to find whatever precious items, such as money or jewellery, were left in the ruins; yet another team was working on the &quot;Umschlagplatz&quot; near street, where salvaged items were sorted and stored in warehouses.

Tatiana Berenstein and Adam Rutkowski estimate the value of the pre-war houses demolished at 220 million pre-war zlotys (i.e. slightly above US$800 million in 2021 dollars), but, according to Andreas Mix, the salvaged materials were only worth 5 million Reichsmarks, thus, with the initial investment of 150 million Reichsmark, the camp ran at steep losses.

A couple thousand Polish civilians, who were paid, also worked in the area, as did dozens of German technicians. At one period, these people, who usually handled more sophisticated tasks, such as the maintenance of demolition machines and handling explosives, outnumbered the inmates. German constructions companies, including Berlinisches Baugeschäft (Berlin), Willy Keymer (Warsaw), Merckle (Ostrów Wielkopolski), and Ostdeutscher Tiefbau (Naumburg), operated there on contract and benefitted from slave labour provided by the prisoners. The Ostbahn assisted them.

==== Conditions ====
The conditions in were extremely harsh. Prisoners&#x27; food rationing was meagre and hunger was common among the inmates, which was exacerbated by lack of food parcels from the outside, as these were not delivered to the camp. The shortages, however, were somewhat alleviated by the presence of Polish workers contracted to remove the ruins of the ghetto, as this was an opportunity for the inmates to clandestinely buy food for whatever valuables they could find in the ruins, and, in later days, when such items became scarce, for gold fillings extracted from their teeth. However, the gold contained there was also of interest of the SS guards, who strictly forbade removal of the teeth. They sought to enrich themselves by getting the precious metal after the death of the labourers.

The Jews were subjected to extermination through labour. The demolition and salvage work were hard and perilous labor, carried out at a brisk pace with no regard to loss of life of the prisoners, so fatal workplace incidents were commonplace. The guards were torturing and murdering the Jews on a whim, viewing them as enemies of the state, and prisoner functionaries, particularly criminal prisoners, were hardly better in their treatment of fellow inmates. Sanitation was sorely lacking to the extent that hungry and drained prisoners were decimated by outbreaks of infectious diseases, and the lack of hygiene gave way to infestations of lice and fleas. In particular, a typhus epidemic in January and February 1944 decreased the prison population by two-thirds, though the sanitary situation improved somewhat by the time the leadership was changed and the camp&#x27;s construction was finished. The camp infirmary, according to Felician Loth, was &quot;a parody of a sick ward&quot;, and patients who were unable to continue work were usually killed. For these reasons, almost 75% of original prisoners have died by March 1944, reducing the camp&#x27;s population to around 1,000 inmates. This prompted the Germans to supply about 3,000 Hungarian Jews from Auschwitz.

Just as the Jews in other concentration camps, the inmates in were forced to wear and wooden clogs. The former had the Star of David badge sewn on it and a Latin letter marking the inmate&#x27;s provenance. The newly arrived prisoners had their hair cut shortly and then underwent a procedure of bathing and , which, before the bathhouse was built in the camp, was happening in Pawiak prison. Prisoner functionaries, however, were treated differently – they lived in a separate barrack (with the exception of the ), could wear civilian clothes, bear arms, and were even sometimes allowed to go outside the camp&#x27;s premises. Jewish inmates speaking German and/or Polish also had slightly better conditions, the former because they could easily understand the guards&#x27; orders and communicate with them, while the latter could barter more efficiently with the Polish workers.

== Executions ==
In 1943–1944, camp inmates, Polish Jews caught hiding on the &quot;Aryan side&quot; of Warsaw or in the ghetto&#x27;s ruins, Polish political prisoners (Pawiak inmates) and Polish hostages captured during the street roundups (&quot;łapanki&quot;) were executed in the ruins of the former ghetto, which surrounded the camp. These executions took place almost daily and on some days, the number of victims reached dozens or even hundreds. The bodies were then burnt, first in open air pyres and later in the camp&#x27;s crematorium.

The ruins of the ghetto supplanted previous execution sites, which were operating in the countryside around Warsaw, such as in Kampinos Forest (the site of the Palmiry massacre). The proximity of the Pawiak prison and the isolation of the former ghetto from the rest of the city, made them – from the German perspective – a far more suitable place for mass killings. Members of personnel, along with the members of other SS and &quot;Ordnungspolizei&quot; formations in Warsaw, were among the executioners. Furthermore, a special &quot;Sonderkommando&quot;, composed of the Jewish prisoners of the , was used to dispose the bodies of the victims. The members of that detachment were often murdered after completing the task, too.

It is impossible to determine the exact number of victims of executions in the ruins since the documents related to the camp were destroyed during its evacuation. Bogusław Kopka and Jan Żaryn estimate that some 20,000 people died as a result of the camp&#x27;s activity, of which 10,000 were Poles. The number includes prisoner deaths as well as victims of executions in and around the camp, among whom were Polish political prisoners and Polish Jews caught hiding on the &quot;Aryan side&quot; of Warsaw or in the restricted zone of the former Warsaw Ghetto. Kopka later clarified that 10,000 people at most could have died in the camp itself. The &quot;Encyclopedia of Camps and Ghettos&quot; gives a smaller estimate of 4,000–5,000 people, counting only prisoners of KL Warschau, while Vági and Kádár suggest 3,400 to 5,000 prisoners.

== Evacuation and liberation ==
In summer 1944, as the Red Army was approaching, the Germans decided to evacuate the prisons and camps in Warsaw. By the end of July, &quot;Schutzhaftlagerführer&quot; Heinz Villain demanded that all prisoners who would not be able to endure a march to assemble, promising the sick and exhausted that they would be transported in horse carriages. However, on 27 July, all those who appeared on the camp director&#x27;s call were shot. The same day, all patients in the camp&#x27;s infirmary were also killed. In total, around 400 prisoners, including at least 180 Hungarians, died due to these actions.

The evacuation of the Warsaw concentration camp started on 28 July. About 4,500 inmates were then forced to march to Kutno, away, in sweltering heat. During the march, which lasted for three days, the prisoners were not given water nor food; the guards additionally murdered everyone who was unable to proceed or who was too slow to execute orders. Those who survived were loaded in freight carriages on 2 August, where poor conditions and the guards&#x27; cruelty added to the tally of dead prisoners. A total of 3,954 prisoners eventually arrived at the Dachau concentration camp on 6 August, of which there were only 280 Greek Jews who arrived at the beginning of the camp&#x27;s existence. The &quot;Encyclopedia of Camps and Ghettos&quot; says that at least 500 inmates died during the operation, while Kopka gives a higher estimate of approximately 2,000 prisoners. Most of the prisoners were subsequently transported to Dachau&#x27;s subcamps in Mühldorf, Kaufering and Allach-Karlsfeld, while a few were sent to Flossenbürg&#x27;s subcamp in Leitmeritz (today&#x27;s Litoměřice in the Czech Republic).

The Warsaw concentration camp was still operating, however. Ninety SS personnel stayed there, as did about 400 prisoners who volunteered to stay in the camp to demolish it. Among those were about 300 original prisoners as well as dozens of Jewish prisoners of Pawiak (38–100 people, including 24 women), who were moved to on 28 July.

On 1 August, the Home Army (AK) started an uprising against Germans in Warsaw. In the first day of fighting, the &quot;Kedyw&quot; (sabotage command) for the Home Army District of Warsaw led by Lt. &quot;Stasinek&quot; (son of Stanisław Sosabowski) captured Waffen-SS warehouses on Stawki street (&quot;Umschlagplatz&quot;) and a school on nearby street, setting free around 50 prisoners who were working there. By that time, the Home Army also partially controlled the area of &quot;the new camp&quot;, located near Okopowa street. In light of these advances by AK, the concentration camp&#x27;s staff and the prisoners retreated to the fortified defence positions in &quot;the old camp&quot;.

In the following few days, the patrol of the insurgent forces made several incursions into , with little success. Meanwhile, Cpt. &quot;Jan&quot;, head of the , asked his superior, Lt. Col. Jan Mazurkiewicz &quot;Radosław&quot;, to storm the buildings of Gęsiówka. Control over the concentration camp&#x27;s area was important from a tactical standpoint, as the Home Army could gain control over the road leading to the Old Town via the ghetto&#x27;s ruins, while also serving a humanitarian purpose of liberating the prisoners, who could be murdered. &quot;Radosław&quot; eventually agreed, and according to the plan, scout Battalion Zośka was handed the task of capturing the concentration camp&#x27;s premises.

 was attacked on 5 August at 10:00, when Ryszard Białous &quot;Jerzy&quot;, Zośka&#x27;s commander, and Wacław Micuta, who commanded one of its platoons, started the offensive. The military advantage was on the Polish side due to their prior capture and usage of a Panther tank, which destroyed the camp&#x27;s watchtowers and bunkers. The German defence eventually collapsed and SS personnel hid in the Pawiak prison walls. Battalion Zośka&#x27;s losses were rather small – one person was killed in action, another died of wounds and one person was wounded in action but survived; German losses are unknown but were presumably larger. The Home Army thus liberated 348 Jews, among which 24 were women. Those released were mostly Hungarian (200–250 people) and Greek Jews, with some Czechoslovakians and Dutch Jews, who knew very little Polish. It is known that only 89 people among the liberated had been Polish citizens, and historians have only been able to identify 73 prisoners by name. The Warsaw concentration camp was the only German concentration camp in Poland that was not liberated by main Allied troops, but by resistance fighters.

The vast majority of released Jewish prisoners swiftly took part in the uprising, which Gabriel Finder attributes to an informal political group which that prevented the camp&#x27;s inhabitants from moral deterioration. Some of them were fighting along with other soldiers, but most, given their lack of combat experience, were helping with logistical issues, rescuing those under ruins as well as extinguishing fires. Morale among Jewish fighters was hurt by displays of antisemitism, with several former Jewish prisoners in combat units killed by antisemitic Poles, in particular those associated with the National Armed Forces. After the defeat of the uprising, the survivors fled or hid in bunkers. There were as few as 200 Jewish survivors (former prisoners as well as Jews who were hiding on the &quot;Aryan&quot; side) on 17 January 1945, on which date the Red Army .

== Postwar ==

After the retreat of the German forces from Warsaw, the former Nazi camp was first operated by the Soviet NKVD for German prisoners of war, as well as for the soldiers of the Home Army loyal to the Polish government-in-exile and other persons suspected of opposing the Soviet occupation. As in the case for the German period, the prisoners were held in poor conditions and it is probable that numerous executions were taking place in the camp.

The camp was then turned over to the Polish Ministry of Public Security (MBP) in mid-1945, when it became known as the Central Labour Camp for Warsaw&#x27;s Reconstruction (). Its prisoners were used for construction and demolition works in the capital. Most of the prisoners of war were released in 1948 and 1949, and in November 1949 the labour camp was converted to a prison. The facility, which became known under two names: Central Prison – Labour Centre in Warsaw () or Central Prison Warsaw II Gęsiówka (), did not &quot;de facto&quot; change its purpose. The inmates were still producing building materials for Warsaw&#x27;s reconstruction, and still used forced labour, but instead of prisoners of war, common criminals and people accused by the of economic wrongdoings were sent there. According to Bogusław Kopka, 1,800 people died in the postwar prison; though an estimate of 1,180 victims also appears in the literature. The fact that the former Nazi camp was taken and run by the communist authorities was the main reason why the Chief Commission for the Investigation of German Crimes in Poland ceased its investigation in 1947.

The prison was closed in 1956 and was demolished in 1965. No element of the Nazi camp was preserved. As of 2023, the site is occupied by a garden square, residential buildings, and the building of the POLIN Museum of the History of Polish Jews.

== Inquiries ==

It did not take long for the newly established Communist government in Poland to start analysing the events that happened in the camp&#x27;s history. Already in May 1945, the Warsaw Circuit Commission for the Investigation of German Crimes in Poland launched a formal inquiry into the crimes committed in Warsaw concentration camp. Prosecutors inspected the premises several times, which yielded rich photographic documentation of the camp&#x27;s buildings. On 15–25 September 1946, a total of 2180 kg of human corpses was exhumed and analysed (the corpses were then buried again in ); however, the exhumations did not cover the whole territory of the camp.

In 1947, the inquiry was halted for the first time due to political considerations, as the former concentration camp was functioning converted to a labour camp under the Communist Ministry of Public Security. It was only in 1974 that the investigation was continued on the request of the Central Office of the State Justice Administrations for the Investigation of National Socialist Crimes in Ludwigsburg, Germany; however, after two years, it was again suspended as the prosecutors deemed it impossible to retrieve more evidence in Poland. The investigation was once again opened in 1986, only to be closed in 1996 due to the unavailability of the perpetrators for interrogation (who either went missing or were already dead). A parallel inquiry by German federal officials was also closed.

The topic of the camp returned to prominence in early 2000s, not least due to the July 2001 Sejm resolution commemorating the victims of the concentration camp, so the Regional Prosecutor&#x27;s Office in Warsaw decided to open the Warsaw concentration camp case once again in 2002. The case was first managed by the Institute of National Remembrance&#x27;s District Commission in Warsaw, then it was transferred to Łódź, but was promptly returned to the capital. On 23 January 2017, the case was closed for the fourth time.

=== Criminal responsibility of perpetrators ===
Following Allied victory in World War II, some people related to the Warsaw concentration camp&#x27;s history were convicted in criminal or military courts.
* 53 SS officers and prisoner functionaries were convicted by the judiciary of the Polish People&#x27;s Republic, who in most cases received relatively light sentences. Five SS officers from the camp were executed for their role in administering ; seven died in prison and the rest was released in 1956 at the latest.
* Some members of staff were convicted in Dachau trials in the American zone of Allied-occupied Germany. Wilhelm Ruppert, Alfred Kramer and , for instance, received death penalties in the Dachau camp trial (Ruppert and Kramer were executed in 1946, while Mielenz died in prison); , the camp doctor, also received capital punishment and was hanged in 1947, though he was indicted in a different trial, which concerned the Mauthausen-Gusen camp.
* , who was a prisoner functionary, was also sentenced to death for his activities in in an East German court in 1950, but this was reduced to life imprisonment on appeal.
* , whom Bogusław Kopka described as among the most cruel staff members of , was ultimately convicted in the Third Majdanek Trial. In 1981, a court in Düsseldorf in West Germany gave him a 6-year prison term.

Additionally, Theodor Szehinskyj, a former guard who immigrated to the US in the 1950s, had his US citizenship revoked as a federal court in Pennsylvania found in July 2000 that he had lied in his initial visa application about his past in the SS Totenkopf Division, including in the Warsaw concentration camp; the decision was upheld on appeal to the 3rd Circuit. Jürgen Stroop&#x27;s trial in 1950 also included significant evidence relating to the concentration camp (Stroop was hanged in Warsaw in 1952).

Most of the staff of , however, did not face consequences for the war crimes. In particular, the whereabouts of Nicolaus Herbet, the second commandant of the camp, as well as &quot;Schutzhaftlagerführer&quot; remained unknown. The Institute of National Remembrance&#x27;s (IPN) prosecutors inquired about 208 people whom it identified to be staff members of the concentration camp in 2014, but the Ludwigsburg office only sent information about a fraction of them because of staffing issues related to processing the request of this breadth. In January 2017, IPN&#x27;s prosecutors speculated that some SS officers involved in might be still alive, but decided to discontinue the investigation due to the fact the prosecutors had no confirmation of this.

== Discredited extermination camp story ==
=== Hypothesis ===
Despite the availability of reliable information about the Warsaw concentration camp, in the 1980s a since-discredited legend or conspiracy theory developed concerning the camp. Maria Trzcińska, a Polish judge who served in 1974–1996 as a member of the Chief Commission for Investigation of Hitlerite Crimes in Poland (named Chief Commission for Investigation of Crimes against the Polish Nation after 1991), was assigned to investigate German documents that her counterparts in Ludwigsburg had found. In mid-1988, testimony began to emerge suggesting that the concentration camp was also located near Warszawa Zachodnia railway station, more than away from Gęsia Street, and included gas chambers. These witnesses said that other camps had also existed in the vicinity of the camp&#x27;s generally recognised area. The earliest mention of the gas chambers appeared in the early 1970s in an issue of &quot;Perspektywy,&quot; a Polish weekly political magazine discontinued in 1990.

Thereafter Trzcińska advocated commemoration of the concentration camp&#x27;s victims, based on the testimony from the late 1980s. In 2002 Trzcińska published a book, &quot;Obóz zagłady w centrum Warszawy. Konzentrationslager Warschau&quot; (&quot;The Extermination Camp in the Centre of Warsaw: Konzentrazionslager Warschau&quot;). According to Jan Żaryn, when the idea of a monument to the victims of the Warsaw concentration camp approached fruition, the interested parties were unable to agree on inscriptions to be placed on it, so Trzcińska requested that the IPN verify which version was correct. The institute&#x27;s conclusions, published in a book by Bogusław Kopka, however, diverged so strongly from hers that she retracted her section of the book and independently published her own conclusions, reiterating the points she had made five years before. These can be summarised as follows:
* started its operation in October 1942, just after Himmler&#x27;s first order (see Creation section);
* The Warsaw concentration camp was, according to Trzcińska, an extensive complex consisting of five subcamps. The main camp, which purportedly had previously served as a POW camp for the Polish Army soldiers detained after September 1939, was located in a small forest in the neighbourhood of Koło called ; two subcamps were located in the former ghetto (one on Gęsia street, which is the generally recognised location, and another on street); and two were located near the Warszawa Zachodnia station. These are said to have extended over an area of around , containing 119 barracks capable of housing 41,000 inmates.
* , as Trzcińska purported, operated as an extermination camp for Poles. Around 200,000 people, mostly ethnic Poles, were said to have been killed by gassing and mass shootings. A road tunnel under the railway line, which is today part of (then part of ), was allegedly converted into a gas chamber, which she claimed played a central role in that extermination.
* The Polish People&#x27;s Republic authorities were loath to study the history of the Warsaw concentration camp or commemorate its victims, as they were afraid of disclosing the information about the functioning of Soviet NKVD and Polish Communist MBP administrations in .

=== Refutation ===
These contentions, in addition to not being confirmed by Bogusław Kopka, have also been refuted by the IPN in a later analysis by . The findings were also cast in doubt by other historians, including Władysław Bartoszewski, Tomasz Szarota, Andreas Mix and Jan Żaryn. In particular, they say that:
* no credible evidence exists for the assertion that had more camps than the one at Gęsia street. There is no testimony whatsoever about the existence of the camp at Bonifraterska street; as for three other camps which supposedly existed, available testimony is scarce, is contradictory and contains few details. There is also no evidence for a POW camp in Koło neighbourhood that had allegedly existed before , or in general of any spatially separated camps;
* there is no credible evidence for the hypothesis that KL Warschau was an extermination camp, or that it featured a giant gas chamber under the railway tracks. Neither the Polish Underground State reports nor the German archives reveal any such information, nor did any piece of testimony coming from wartime period or shortly thereafter mention it. The oral and written submissions Trzcińska relied on were created more than 40 years after the war, and their veracity is dubious. Moreover, retired workers of &quot;Kolprojekt&quot;, a rail construction bureau, and available documents of the enterprise suggest that the ventilation shafts near , which supposedly were remnants of the gas chamber, were in fact built in the 1970s and that in 1960, the technical plan of Warszawa Zachodnia station did not have any gas chambers detected;
* known estimates of the losses Warsaw endured in World War II contradict the notion that 200,000 people could have died in the Warsaw concentration camp. Bogusław Kopka suggested that this number is in fact a sum of those who died in Warsaw Uprising, the deaths in the camps and some other civilian deaths in Warsaw.

In 2010, the Institute of National Remembrance commissioned a report from historian and aerial-photography expert , which was submitted in December 2016 (it is not yet published as of August 2022). The report confirmed that the only place existed on was on Gęsia Street and that no camp infrastructure existed in the areas said to have contained other subcamps. Walkowski also noted that the tunnels were not closed and that vehicles could drive through them, while the two ventilation shafts and a ventilator engine that were supposedly used to pump Zyklon B into the tunnel were only built in the 1970s. It was also shown that during the German occupation, access to the forest near Koło was not restricted for civilians, the barracks were already built in the 1930s and were used by civilians, while the purported &quot;death wall&quot; only emerged in 1972.

=== Reactions ===
According to Christian Davies, the discredited story that the Germans built a gas chamber to kill non-Jews, together with the fact of some 200,000 Polish fatalities in the 1944 Warsaw Uprising (for a total of 400,000 non-Jewish deaths in Warsaw, which is also the usual estimate of the number of Jews imprisoned in Warsaw), has been used by the story&#x27;s advocates to seek parity between Jewish and non-Jewish victimhood that would make the Holocaust seem less unique, a notion that Davies dubbed the &quot;Polocaust&quot;. He also pointed to Law and Justice party (PiS) officials&#x27; endorsement for , who emerged as one of the main proponents of the extermination camp hypothesis after Trzcińska died in 2011, and IPN&#x27;s lack of reaction when the commemorative plaque citing Trzcińska&#x27;s data was unveiled in 2017. &quot;Nasz Dziennik,&quot; a right-wing to far-right Catholic newspaper, and affiliated &quot;Radio Maryja,&quot; have promoted the hypothesis as an emblem of Polish martyrdom. These media outlets have also advocated for introducing the story into school curricula and for constructing a museum of .

In 2001, Bartoszewski dismissed the gas chamber theory as being propagated among those &quot;who think that too few people have died in Warsaw&quot;. Havi Dreifuss, Jan Grabowski, and Gideon Greif have related the gas-chamber story to the current Polish government&#x27;s history policy and interpreted the account as a conspiracy theory (Grabowski) or fake history (Dreifuss). Walkowski, who said he was bemused by the fact that people were unhappy with his findings about fewer deaths, told reporters he had received threats. Historian Daniel Blatman, on the other hand, while seeing the hypothesis as &quot;one of numberless stories that Holocaust deniers around the world are posting online&quot;, warned against generalising on the Polish society or the governments it brought to power.

== Commemoration ==

Probably in the 1950s, a Tchorek plaque, which said that &quot;in 1943–1944, Polish patriots were repeatedly shot to death and burnt by the Hitlerites in this building&quot;, was installed on a wall of the burnt-out Wołyń Caserns, specifically on the east wall, facing Zamenhof Street. The plaque was lost in 1965, when Gęsiówka was demolished. Bogusław Kopka says, though, that during his visit to Warsaw in 1959, Richard Nixon, then Vice President of the United States, managed to lay a wreath in front of the main building of the former concentration camp.

Commemoration efforts were renewed in July 2001, when the Sejm, the lower house of the Polish parliament, adopted a resolution commemorating the victims of the concentration camp while calling to create a monument &quot;in remembrance of thousands of Polish inhabitants of Warsaw who were murdered in the Warsaw concentration camp as part of the plan of annihilating the Capital City of Poland, as well as murdered citizens of other nationalities: Jews, Greeks, Gypsies, Belarusians and Italian officers&quot;.

In March 2004, the Warsaw city council allowed to build a commemoration site on the Alojzy Pawelek square in the southern part of Wola district, next to what Trzcińska contended were gas chambers and subcamps of . It became a place of informal monthly gatherings of supporters of Trzcińska&#x27;s hypothesis. Despite the fact that relevant authorities consider the monument an illegal building and do not cover it by protection afforded to other monuments as it cites false historical data, the monument still stands.

The resolution that initially allowed the monument&#x27;s construction was cancelled in October 2009 after consultations with the Council for the Protection of Struggle and Martyrdom Sites, a governmental body responsible for the preservation of sites of wartime persecution, and it was decided to place a new monument in the neighbourhood of Muranów, on the site of what was then Serbia prison, some away from the walls of the actual concentration camp. That decision was opposed by supporters of Trzcińska&#x27;s hypothesis, who argued that placing the monument there would suggest that only Jews were victims of the concentration camp, but the Supreme Administrative Court denied their request to invalidate the new resolution.

Supporters of the extermination camp theory have created their own commemoration sites. Their efforts have resulted in the 2004 monument, a plaque on a nearby on , placed in 2009 and consecrated by Archbishop Kazimierz Nycz, and another two in 2017, one on a in the Warsaw district of Praga-Południe and its copy in the Jasna Góra Monastery in Częstochowa; all of these are repeating Trzcińska&#x27;s conjecture about 200,000 Poles murdered in the Warsaw concentration camp. An unofficial plaque was also installed in the Lasek na Kole forest, contending that a place of execution connected with the Warsaw concentration camp existed there. Marius Gudonis and Benjamin T. Jones, in their book &quot;History in a Post-Truth World&quot;, relate the fact such plaques appeared to the indifference to established facts and to an ideological devotion to the preferred historical narrative, which, in the case of the 2009 plaque, was further cemented by approval of high church authorities.

As a result, the only place of commemoration of the Warsaw concentration camp in the area of is a plaque that was initially embedded into a wall of a building at 34 Anielewicza Street in 1994; it was moved in 2018 and is now located on the corner of Anielewicza and Okopowa Streets, which was the south-west corner of KL Warschau. The plaques, written in Polish, Hebrew and English tell about the camp&#x27;s liberation by Battalion Zośka and the subsequent participation of the prisoners in the Warsaw Uprising. A plaque in remembrance of the victims was also unveiled near the Museum of Pawiak Prison in November 2013.

The camp&#x27;s name appears on the 1995 German post stamp, prepared for the 50th anniversary of the liberation of prisoners from Nazi concentration camps. In 2020, a 10 PLN silver commemorative coin was issued by the National Bank of Poland, honouring the camp&#x27;s victims.

<text>Singapore competed at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece, from 13 to 29 August 2004. This was the nation&#x27;s thirteenth appearance at the Olympics, except for two different editions. Singapore was part of the Malaysian team at the 1964 Summer Olympics in Tokyo, but did not attend at the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow, because of its support for the United States boycott.

The Singapore National Olympic Council sent a total of sixteen athletes to the Games, six men and ten women, to compete in six different sports. The nation&#x27;s team size was roughly denser from Sydney by two athletes, being considered its largest delegation since the 1956 Summer Olympics in Melbourne. For the first time in its Olympic history, Singapore was represented by more female than male athletes. Eight Singaporean athletes had previously competed in Sydney four years earlier; five of which were swimmers, including four-time Olympian and multiple-time Southeast Asian Games champion Joscelin Yeo. Meanwhile, badminton player Ronald Susilo was appointed by the council to carry the Singaporean flag in the opening ceremony.

Singapore, however, failed to win a single Olympic medal in Athens since the 1960 Summer Olympics in Rome, where Tan Howe Liang claimed silver in men&#x27;s weightlifting. Table tennis player Li Jiawei narrowly missed the nation&#x27;s first ever medal in 44 years, after losing out her match against South Korea&#x27;s Kim Kyung-Ah for the bronze.

==Athletics==

<doc id="927757" wikidata="Q116761" url="?curid=927757" title="Gęsiówka">
<text>Gęsiówka () is the colloquial Polish name for a prison that once existed on &quot;Gęsia&quot; (&quot;Goose&quot;) Street in Warsaw, Poland, and which, under German occupation during World War II, became a Nazi concentration camp.

In 1945–56 the Gęsiówka served as a prison and labor camp, operated first by the Soviet NKVD to imprison Polish resistance fighters of the Home Army and other opponents of Poland&#x27;s new Stalinist regime, then by the Polish communist secret police.

== History ==
Before World War II, the Gęsiówka was a Polish Army military prison on Gęsia Street (now Anielewicza Street), near the intersection with Okopowa Street and the Okopowa Street Jewish Cemetery. Beginning in 1939, with the German occupation of Poland, it became a re-education camp of the German security police (&quot;Arbeitserziehungslager der Sicherheitspolizei Warschau&quot;).

In 1943 the prison was turned into a concentration camp, mostly for Jewish prisoners from countries other than Poland, particularly from Greece and Hungary. Over the course of its operation, the camp, known as the Warsaw concentration camp, housed an estimated 8,000–9,000 prisoners, who were engaged in slave labor. 4,000 to 5,000 prisoners are estimated to have died in the camp, during the death march from the camp, during the Warsaw Uprising, and while in hiding after the Uprising.

The former Gęsiówka prison is now the site of the POLIN Museum of the History of Polish Jews.

== Liberation during Warsaw Uprising ==

On 5 August 1944, early in the Warsaw Uprising, the &quot;Zośka&quot; scouting battalion of the Home Army&#x27;s Radosław Group, led by Ryszard Białous and Eugeniusz Stasiecki, attacked the Gęsiówka camp, which was being liquidated by the Germans. &quot;Magda&quot;, one of two Panther tanks that had been captured by Polish insurgents on 2 August, and assigned to Zośka&#x27;s newly formed armour platoon commanded by Wacław Micuta, supported the assault with fire from its main gun. In the one-and-a-half-hour battle, most of the SD guards were killed or captured, though some fled toward the Pawiak prison.

Only two Polish fighters were killed in the attack. Rescued from certain death were 348 able-bodied Jewish prisoners who had been retained by the Germans as slave labour after the Germans&#x27; 1943 liquidation of the Warsaw Ghetto and had been left behind after the evacuation of most of the Gęsiówka camp&#x27;s inmates in July 1944.

Many of the Jewish prisoners joined the ranks of the insurgents, and most were killed in the next nine weeks of fighting, as were most of their liberators (the &quot;Zośka&quot; battalion lost 70% of its members in the Uprising).

== After World War II ==
In January 1945 Gęsiówka was used by the Soviet NKVD to imprison Polish resistance fighters of the Home Army and other opponents of Poland&#x27;s new Stalinist regime, who were kept there in appalling conditions. The Polish communist secret police took over the administration of the camp later that year and continued to use it as a prison and labour camp for criminal and political prisoners, including so-called &quot;class enemies&quot;, until 1956.

== Gęsiówka liberation memorial ==
The Gęsiówka was demolished in the 1960s. The only visible evidence of its previous existence is a plaque, on the wall of 34 Anielewicza Street, commemorating the camp&#x27;s 1944 liberation.

The memorial was unveiled during the commemoration of the fiftieth anniversary of the Warsaw Uprising in 1994. Wacław Micuta, commander of the armoured platoon of the Zośka battalion, said the following words at the ceremony:

On 27th July the Germans decided to evacuate the Gęsiówka camp to Dachau. More than 400 inmates, incapable of marching, were shot...A column of about 4,000 Jews was marched off, but disappeared without trace. And now the Zośka battalion was standing in front of this camp. They remembered the Scouting Statute, which says that a scout is a friend to every other human being and a brother to every other scout. We all wanted to attack immediately...and since we had captured a couple of tanks, the situation was rather better than in the previous days. So four of us went back to &quot;Radosław&quot; [Jan Mazurkiewicz, commander of the insurgent forces in Warsaw&#x27;s Wola district] to ask for permission. Radosław was a cautious man and shared the view that the fortified positions should not be attacked frontally. But he agreed on condition that the attacking force be small in number and be composed entirely of volunteers...We carried it off by surprise. Our tank was a great success because the Germans [in the camp] had no anti-tank weapons. After the main gateway was destroyed Felek&#x27;s platoon moved in...

The memorial features inscriptions in Polish, Hebrew and English.

<doc id="927764" wikidata="Q656397" url="?curid=927764" title="Bombing of Warsaw in World War II">
<text>The bombing of Warsaw in World War II started with the aerial bombing campaign of Warsaw by the German Luftwaffe during the siege of Warsaw in the invasion of Poland in 1939. It also included German bombing raids during the Warsaw Uprising in 1944. During the course of the war, approximately 85% of the city was destroyed due to German mass bombings, heavy artillery fire, and a planned demolition campaign.


==Siege of Warsaw (1939)==
In 1939, the Luftwaffe opened the German attack on Poland with operation Wasserkante, an air attack on Warsaw on 1 September. This attack by four bomber groups was of limited effectiveness due to low-lying cloud cover and stout Polish resistance by the PZL P.11 fighters of the Pursuit Brigade, which claimed down 16 German aircraft for the loss of 10 of their own. However, heavy losses in Polish fighter aircraft meant that by 6 September the air defense of Warsaw was in the hands of the 40 mm (24 guns), 75 mm (72 guns) anti-aircraft guns and many anti-aircraft machine guns of the Warsaw Defense Command.

As the German Army approached Warsaw on 8 September 1939, 140 Junkers Ju 87 Stukas attacked the portions of the city on the east bank of the Vistula River and other bombers bombed the Polish Army positions in the western suburbs. On 13 September Luftwaffe level and dive bombers caused widespread fires. Further resistance was followed by propaganda leaflet drops.

Finally, starting at 0800 on 25 September, Luftwaffe bombers under the command of Major Wolfram Freiherr von Richthofen conducted the largest air raid ever seen by that time, dropping 560 tons of high explosive bombs and 72 tons of incendiary bombs, in coordination with heavy artillery shelling by Army units. The center of Warsaw was badly damaged. Approximately 1,150 sorties were flown by a wide variety of aircraft, including obsolescent Junkers Ju 52/3m bombers, which dropped 13 percent of the incendiary bombs dropped on the day. Only two Ju 52 bombers were lost.

Although commonly portrayed as being absolutely decisive, the Black Monday air attack was a mixed success. While the bombing lowered Polish morale, it did not cause the Polish surrender. Smoke from fires and large amounts of dust obscured targets and greatly reduced accuracy. As a result, Luftwaffe bombers dropped a significant amount of their bomb loads on German infantry positions in the northwest suburbs of the city, leading to acrimonious discussions between Luftwaffe and Army commanders. The tonnage dropped combined with only approximate delivery on target and the short duration does not begin to approximate the intensity of attacks major European cities were subsequently to suffer.

However, on 26 September three key forts in the city defenses were captured, and the Polish garrison offered its surrender - on 27 September German troops entered the city. The international press reported that 20,000 to 40,000 civilians were killed, figures that have remained in the history books sixty years later. The real number is likely far lower; calculating with the same casualty rates as the most lethal bombing raids in World War II in Germany, the number of dead amounts to 6,000 to 7,000. 40 percent of the buildings in the city were damaged and 10 percent of the buildings destroyed. However, some of the damage was the result of ground artillery fire and not solely caused by aerial bombing—including intense street fighting between German infantry and armor units and Polish infantry and artillery.

The September 25 raid had the aim of breaking Polish morale and forcing a surrender. According to the laws of war in 1939, Warsaw was a defended military target and the Luftwaffe raid could be construed as a legitimate military operation.

The Siege of Warsaw accounted for 10% destroyed buildings by late-1939.

== Warsaw Uprising (1944) ==
The Luftwaffe conducted numerous strikes against Polish resistance and civilian targets. Warsaw&#x27;s infrastructure was also heavily damaged by air raids, as desperate street-to-street fighting took place in the destroyed areas. After 63 days of heavy urban fighting, the Luftwaffe&#x27;s combined efforts with artillery bombardment, and systemic destruction accounted for 85%-90% destroyed buildings by January 1945.

<doc id="927765" wikidata="Q7748494" url="?curid=927765" title="The Lorelei Signal">
<text>&quot;The Lorelei Signal&quot; is the fourth episode of the first season of the animated American science fiction television series &quot;Star Trek&quot;. It first aired in the NBC Saturday morning lineup on September 29, 1973, and was written by Margaret Armen, author of three &quot;Original Series&quot; episodes.

Set in the 23rd century, the series follows the adventures of Captain James T. Kirk (voiced by William Shatner) and the crew of the Federation starship &quot;Enterprise&quot;. In this episode, Lt. Uhura (voiced by Nichelle Nichols), Nurse Chapel (voiced by Majel Barrett) and the &quot;Enterprise&quot; women must take charge of the ship from incapacitated male senior officers and rescue Captain Kirk and his landing party held on an alien world.

== Plot ==
The Federation starship &quot;Enterprise&quot; investigates a sector of space where starships have been disappearing every 27.346 years. A compelling musical signal lures the &quot;Enterprise&quot; to a remote planet in the Taurean system. The music works on the men of the &quot;Enterprise&quot;, affecting their judgement and causing them to experience euphoric hallucinations. Captain Kirk, First Officer Spock, Chief Medical Officer Dr. McCoy, and Lieutenant Carver beam down to the source of the signals. The inhabitants are a race of beautiful women who want to celebrate their arrival. As they indulge in the entertainment the women offer, they find themselves in a lethargic state and rapidly aging. Headbands locked around their foreheads transmit their lifeforce to the women, who are growing in strength.

On board the &quot;Enterprise&quot;, Communications Officer Lt. Uhura talks with Nurse Chapel about the men&#x27;s condition and concludes that she must take command due to the euphoric state of Chief Engineer Scott.

Kirk and his party gather enough strength to escape to a spacious garden and hide inside a tall urn. They realize the pace of their loss of strength correlates with the proximity of the women. Spock, who has not aged as much due to longer Vulcan longevity, agrees to go back to retrieve their communicators; he tells Uhura to send an all-female rescue party.

Uhura beams down with Chapel and a female security force. When the native women try to force them to leave, they stun them with their phasers. When Uhura threatens to destroy their temple, the Taurean women explain how they came to be in their current situation; when their people settled on the planet, the planet weakened them, and the women could only survive by draining the men&#x27;s remaining energy, causing their deaths. The women are now immortal and unaging, but cannot reproduce, and every 27 years must lure males and drain their life forces to stay alive. At Uhura&#x27;s urging, the Taurean women help them locate the male landing party, who are drowning in the urn due to a rainstorm. The female landing party frees them using their phasers.

The aging process is stopped with the removal of the headbands, but they cannot find a treatment to restore their original age. Spock comes up with the idea of using their original transporter patterns from when they first beamed down.

Uhura returns to the planet and witnesses the Taurean leader, Theela, destroying the device that had been luring starships, stating that Uhura should tell Kirk she kept her side of the bargain. Uhura informs them that a ship of women will return to bring them to a habitable world and that the women&#x27;s bodies should return to normal in a few months. Theela is pleased, preferring a life fully lived to a static immortality.

== Production ==
In addition to her normal role as Nurse Chapel, Majel Barrett supplies the voice of Theela, the head of the Taurean women, Nichelle Nichols supplies the voice of security officer Lt. Davison in addition to that of Lt. Uhura, and James Doohan adds the voice of Lt. Carver to his usual role of Chief Engineer Scott. (Doohan also sings part of an old Welsh folk song, &quot;Yr Hufen Melyn&quot; (&quot;The Yellow Cream&quot;) as the &quot;Enterprise&quot; is seen drifting by the planet, in a segment that lasts over half a minute.)

Co-producer Lou Scheimer recounted that during the table read for the episode, &quot;Nichelle [Nichols] yelled happily, &#x27;What you&#x27;re kidding? I actually get to run the &quot;Enterprise&quot;? Really?&#x27; It broke the whole room up.&quot; This is one of three times a woman commands the &quot;Enterprise&quot;, the other two being in &quot;The Cage&quot; by Number One, and &quot;Turnabout Intruder&quot; by Dr. Janice Lester.

== Reception ==
&quot;Den of Geek&quot; listed &quot;The Lorelei Signal&quot; as one of the top 25 episodes from a grouping of &quot;TOS&quot; and &quot;TAS&quot; together. &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; rated &quot;The Lorelei Signal&quot; the 91st best episode of all &quot;Star Trek&quot; episodes, prior to &quot;Star Trek: Discovery&quot;. &quot;SyFy&quot; noted this episode as having Uhura&#x27;s third best scene in &quot;Star Trek&quot;. A &quot;Star Trek&quot; binge-watching guide by &quot;Den of Geek&quot; recommended this episode as part of the &quot;foundations of &quot;Star Trek&quot;&quot; group.

<doc id="927766" wikidata="Q2451909" url="?curid=927766" title="Super Mario Bros. Deluxe">
<text>Super Mario Bros. Deluxe (also titled Super Mario Bros. DX) is a 1999 video game developed by Nintendo for the Game Boy Color as a version of the 1985 NES game &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot;. The game contains a largely unmodified version of &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot; with an unlockable version of the 1986 Japanese sequel &quot;Super Mario Bros.: The Lost Levels&quot;. In addition, the game includes several new gameplay features, such as a single and two-player race mode, a challenge mode for individual levels, and miscellaneous toys and collectibles, some of which utilize the functionality of the Game Boy Printer. 

Upon release, &quot;Deluxe&quot; received critical acclaim, with reviewers praising the faithfulness of the translation of &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot; to the Game Boy Color and the additional gameplay features and modes, with minor criticism directed at the gameplay effects of the smaller screen size compared to the NES. Sales for the game were also positive, with the game remaining in sales charts for two years and being one of the highest-selling video games of 2000. Retrospective reception of &quot;Deluxe&quot; has praised the game as one of the best titles released for the Game Boy system.

== Gameplay ==

&quot;Deluxe&quot; features platforming gameplay largely similar to the original, allowing players to control Mario or Luigi through the 32 levels of &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot;, referred to in the game as &quot;Original 1985&quot;. The game retains the pixel graphics of the original but with a smaller resolution to fit the screen of the Game Boy Color. The game features screen scrolling to reflect this change, and players can use the vertical directional buttons to scroll the screen up or down. Players can also save the progress of their game at any time.

=== Additions ===

Challenge Mode is an additional mode that allows players to replay completed stages with the objective of achieving the highest score and locating items across the stage, including five red coins and a hidden Yoshi egg in each stage. Players select individual stages and complete them in a single attempt. Upon completion, Toad will provide the player with a rating based on their performance in reaching a threshold score, collecting the five red coins in a stage, and discovering the hidden Yoshi. The Vs. mode allows two players to compete in a race to the end of a stage by using two Game Boy Colors connected with a Game Link Cable. Vs. levels feature vanishing blocks that can be triggered by a player to hide or reveal obstacles. A similar single-player mode title You vs. Boo is available where the player races Boo across the same courses. In this mode, when players complete a stage, Boo&#x27;s speed is set to the best time set by the player. 

Players are able to unlock additional game features and collectables through completing several actions in the game. The main addition is the ability to play &quot;Super Mario Bros. 2&quot; when the player reaches a minimum score of 300,000 points in the original mode. Other unlockable features are included in a Toy Box menu. These include a calendar that allows players to set marks or notes for dates between 1999 and 2999. The fortune teller allows players select one of five cards, with the results reflecting levels of luck, providing extra lives the first time they receive an Extremely Lucky card. The Yoshi Finder scrolls through random levels and displays a frame in which a hidden Yoshi can be found in the Challenge mode. As players progress in the game, they will collect awards, pictures and banners that can be printed using the Game Boy Printer.

== Development ==
Development of &quot;Deluxe&quot; was led by Nintendo director Toshiaki Suzuki in the Nintendo Research &amp; Development 2 team, a small team dedicated to hardware peripherals and software. &quot;Deluxe&quot; was Suzuki&#x27;s directorial debut, with Nintendo assigning his team to recreate &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot; and &quot;The Legend of Zelda: Link&#x27;s Awakening&quot; for the Game Boy Color, along with a few additional features. The team worked closely with Shigeru Miyamoto and Toshihiko Nakago, the designer and programmer of the original game. Suzuki stated that the development process had little pressure in the belief that the game would regardless be enjoyable and sell well. The developers developed and demonstrated a one-level prototype of &quot;Deluxe&quot; prior to the commercial release of the Game Boy Color. As an early Game Boy Color title, &quot;Deluxe&quot; was the first full-colour &quot;Mario&quot; title to appear on a handheld. The game was released in North America on May 10, 1999 and in the United Kingdom in December 1999. In Japan, &quot;Deluxe&quot; did not receive a commercial release but was distributed starting March 1, 2000, on Nintendo Power kiosks in Lawson stores, where consumers could have the game copied onto a memory cartridge.

== Reception ==
=== Sales ===
Following release, &quot;Deluxe&quot; sold 2.8 million units in the United States. According to NPD sales charts, &quot;Deluxe&quot; ranked as the fourteenth best-selling video game on all platforms in the United States in 2000. The game peaked in third place for weekly handheld sales charts in June 1999, and remained in overall weekly sales charts into 2001.

=== Critical reviews ===

&quot;Deluxe&quot; was met with critical acclaim upon release, with an average score of 92% according to review aggregator &quot;GameRankings&quot;.

Critics praised the additional modes and features. Describing &quot;Deluxe&quot; as the &quot;killer app&quot; for the Game Boy Color, Cameron Davis of &quot;GameSpot&quot; wrote that Nintendo had &quot;pulled out the stops&quot; to deliver rewards and &quot;cool diversions&quot; for players. &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; considered the game&#x27;s additions and extras to add &quot;challenge&quot; and &quot;tons of replay value&quot; to the game, specially noting the game&#x27;s two-player mode as a &quot;blast&quot;. Craig Harris of &quot;IGN&quot; praised the inclusion of a save feature, unlockable items and secrets. He gave special mention to the versus mode, describing it as a &quot;cool use&quot; of the original engine and &quot;worth the purchase of another cartridge just for this feature alone&quot;. Martin Kitts of &quot;Planet Game Boy&quot; described the game&#x27;s additions as &quot;packed to bursting point&quot; with features and assessed it as &quot;arguably the most complete Game Boy title ever made&quot;. Many critics also praised the decision to include &quot;The Lost Levels&quot; in the game.

Reviewers praised the faithfulness and of quality of the game&#x27;s port of &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot; Describing the game as a &quot;dead-on carbon copy&quot; of the graphics and music of &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot;, Colin Williamson of &quot;Allgame&quot; highlighted the &quot;bright&quot; and &quot;colorful&quot; display of the Game Boy screen. Craig Harris of &quot;IGN&quot; considered the recreation to be &quot;pixel-perfect&quot; and a &quot;perfect translation&quot;, calling the game &quot;the Game Boy Color-specific game to own&quot; and anticipating the game would prompt a &quot;revolution of porting NES games to the handheld&quot;. &quot;Computer and Video Games&quot; also noted the game &quot;plays wonderfully&quot; and was unchanged from the original game. Cameron Davis of &quot;GameSpot&quot; described the game as a &quot;still perfect&quot; version of &quot;Mario Bros.&quot;, praising the preservation of &quot;every secret, bonus, bug and warp&quot; and the fact &quot;no compromises&quot; were made with the game&#x27;s graphics. &quot;Nintendo Life&quot; wrote, &quot;It may just be our hazy 80s memory, but we think that the colors look even more vibrant on the Game Boy Color.&quot;

Some reviewers noted the smaller screen of the Game Boy Color compared to the NES version. Colin Williamson of &quot;Allgame&quot; considered the adjustment of the screen when jumping was a &quot;major pain&quot; when facing vertical platforms or enemies such as Lakitu. &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; noted &quot;minor problems&quot; with the game&#x27;s vertical scrolling for limiting visibility. Cameron Davis of &quot;GameSpot&quot; assessed that the game&#x27;s camera issues were a trade-off for the preservation of the game&#x27;s graphics, calling the leaps of faith &quot;annoying, but better than the alterative&quot;.

=== Retrospective reception ===
Many critics have retrospectively assessed &quot;Deluxe&quot; as one of the best games released for the Game Boy system due to its enhancements of the original game. Jeremy Parish of &quot;USGamer&quot; described the game as a &quot;comprehensive overhaul&quot; that added &quot;considerably more&quot; to the original game. Chris Scullion of &quot;Official Nintendo Magazine&quot; similarly expressed that &quot;Deluxe&quot; was the &quot;definitive version&quot; of the original game, and surpassed its quality. Darryn Bonthuys of &quot;GameSpot&quot; commended the game as &quot;timeless&quot; and one of the best for the handheld due to the &quot;tons of new content that made the entire game feel like a brand-new experience to play&quot;. Graeme Mason of &quot;GamesRadar&quot; praised the game as one of the best games on the Game Boy Color, describing the &quot;almost-perfect replication&quot; of the original and the additional features as an &quot;excellent value-for-money package&quot;. Gabe Gurwin of &quot;Digital Trends&quot; ranked the game as the eleventh-best Game Boy Color game, stating the color made the graphics &quot;appear to pop off the screen&quot; and noting the game had &quot;plenty for newcomers to love&quot;. Gavin Lane of &quot;Nintendo Life&quot; also ranked &quot;Deluxe&quot; as the eleventh-best title for the system, assessing it as a &quot;special&quot; title that offered a &quot;great version of the original game&quot;, although noting its additional features compensated for its &quot;reduced view&quot; on the &quot;diminutive screen&quot; of the Color. Ashley Day of &quot;Retro Gamer&quot; ranked the game as the third-best Game Boy Color title, describing it as &quot;unmissable&quot;, a perfect recreation of the original, and one of the first Game Boy Color titles to &quot;use the full power&quot; of the platform. In describing &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot; as the fourth-best &quot;Mario Bros.&quot; title of all time, Chris Tapsell of &quot;Eurogamer&quot; noted that &quot;Deluxe&quot; warranted &quot;special mention&quot; for its additions to the original game including the challenge mode and world map, considering it to be a better version to the original game.

<doc id="927773" wikidata="Q7741973" url="?curid=927773" title="The Infinite Vulcan">
<text>&quot;The Infinite Vulcan&quot; is the seventh episode of the first season of the American animated science fiction television series &quot;Star Trek: The Animated Series&quot;. It first aired on NBC on October 20, 1973, and was written by &quot;Original Series&quot; cast member Walter Koenig. It was the actor&#x27;s only involvement in the series, as he had not been hired to voice Pavel Chekov in the animated version due to budgetary limitations. With &quot;The Infinite Vulcan&quot;, Koenig became the first member of the &quot;Star Trek&quot; cast to write an episode for the franchise. As with the rest of the first season, the episode was directed by Hal Sutherland.

Set in the 23rd century, the series follows the adventures of Captain James T. Kirk (voiced by William Shatner) and the crew of the Starfleet starship &quot;Enterprise&quot;. In this episode, the crew visit a planet inhabited by plant-based lifeforms and must save the life of Science Officer Spock (voiced by Leonard Nimoy) after he is abducted by a giant clone of Dr. Stavos Keniclius (voiced by James Doohan).

Koenig was hired to write the script after some of his work was passed from Susan Sackett to series creator Gene Roddenberry. Koenig found the writing process for the episode was not enjoyable, due to the number of re-writes required. Further additions were made by Roddenberry, including talking vegetables as characters. When the producers offered him a second episode, Koenig turned it down. &quot;The Infinite Vulcan&quot; received a mixed reception from critics, who suggested that the writing could have been better, but others included it in lists of the best episodes of &quot;The Animated Series&quot;.

== Plot ==
While exploring the newly discovered planet Phylos for possible Federation colonization, Lt. Sulu picks up a walking plant, called a Retlaw, and is poisoned by a stinger. The plantlike alien beings who inhabit the planet approach the &quot;Enterprise&quot; landing party and their leader, Agmar, saves Sulu&#x27;s life. The Phylosians say they were nearly wiped out by a mild terrestrial disease that was brought to the planet by Dr. Stavos Keniclius, a Terran scientist who survived Earth&#x27;s Eugenics Wars.

A giant clone of Keniclius, named Keniclius Five, kidnaps First Officer Spock. Keniclius has survived through the centuries by periodically transferring his consciousness into a new, more advanced clone body. He believes the galaxy is as war-ravaged as Earth was when he left it. He plans to enforce peace on the galaxy with the aid of a fleet of Phylosian ships and a giant clone of Spock that he&#x27;s created by transferring Spock&#x27;s consciousness into it, leaving Spock&#x27;s original body a mindless shell. The newly awakened Spock Two uses his Vulcan telepathic abilities to mind meld with his original self and save his life. The two Spocks, in concert with Captain James T. Kirk, convince Keniclius that the need for his plan no longer exists. Spock Two and Keniclius Five devote themselves to restoring the Phylosian civilization as Spock One departs with his shipmates.

== Production ==

Walter Koenig joined the main cast of &quot;Star Trek: The Original Series&quot; during the second season as Pavel Chekov and continued to appear in the series until it was cancelled at the end of season three. Although the remaining main cast of the series were hired as voice actors for &quot;Star Trek: The Animated Series&quot;, Koenig was not brought in due to financial constraints. He only found out about his omission from the show when Sackett announced it on stage at a &quot;Star Trek&quot; convention he was attending. His character was replaced by a new animated character voiced by James Doohan.

Koenig first became involved with writing a script for &quot;The Animated Series&quot; after he asked Susan Sackett, &quot;Star Trek&quot; creator Gene Roddenberry&#x27;s assistant, to type up some writing he was working on. After reading it through, she thought it was good and passed it to Roddenberry, who agreed and asked Koenig if he was interested in writing for the animated show. He accepted the offer, and started working on a plot involving cloning which was inspired by newspaper articles about the subject, becoming the first actor from &quot;Star Trek&quot; to write for the franchise.

He found the writing process for &quot;The Infinite Vulcan&quot; &quot;unbearable&quot;. This was due to interference from Roddenberry, resulting in Koenig producing ten drafts of the screenplay, and because of Koenig&#x27;s frustration in not otherwise being involved in the series. He could not understand why so many redrafts were required, a view shared by story editor/associate producer D.C. Fontana. Roddenberry was keen in particular to make use of the benefits of an animated medium, by including things which could not have been shown on a live-action series. These included &quot;talking vegetables&quot; as characters, which Koenig said were not his idea but were so silly as to not be worthy of a fight. David Alexander, in his book &quot;Star Trek Creator: The Authorised Biography of Gene Roddenberry&quot;, suggested that Koenig was hired to write &quot;The Infinite Vulcan&quot; because Roddenberry felt &quot;bad&quot; about Koenig&#x27;s exclusion from the series.

Koenig asked to play the part of Dr. Keniclius. Roddenberry and Fontana approved, and the show&#x27;s producers allowed him to audition, but he said later that he suspected it was &quot;a very token gesture&quot; and they were not seriously considering him. He included a reference to himself in the episode, as the walking plant is called a Retlaw – Walter spelled backwards. This was a reference to aliens in the 1940s comic book &quot;Planet Comics&quot; who spoke backwards. He later used a similar idea in &quot;The Stranger&quot;, a &quot;Land of the Lost&quot; episode he wrote, in which Koenig introduced the character Enik. This character was originally called Eneg, backwards for Gene as a reference to Gene Roddenberry.

Koenig felt that &quot;The Infinite Vulcan&quot; turned out &quot;OK&quot;, and had heard a number of opinions on it ranging from it being the best episode of &quot;The Animated Series&quot; to it being the very worst. He felt overall that it was &quot;an interesting take and certainly a little different.&quot; Fellow cast member George Takei felt the episode showed that Koenig was &quot;enterprising&quot;. The producers liked the episode so much that they wanted Koenig to write another, but he turned them down. Koenig later explained that he was still upset at the time over not appearing as Chekov in the series. Keniclius later appeared in Kevin Lauderdale&#x27;s story &quot;The Rules of War,&quot; which takes place during the Eugenics Wars, in the anthology &quot;Strange New Worlds IX&quot;.

== Reception ==
James Van Hise wrote in his book &quot;The Man Who Created Star Trek: Gene Roddenberry&quot;, that &quot;some of the writing on the series&quot;, specifically that on &quot;The Infinite Vulcan&quot;, &quot;left much to be desired&quot;.

&quot;The Infinite Vulcan&quot; was included in best of/recommend lists by some reviewers. For example, in James Rundle&#x27;s retrospective of the episodes for &quot;SciFiNow&quot;, he gave &quot;The Infinite Vulcan&quot; a rating of three out of five. The episode was included in seventh place of the best episodes of the series by the website Topless Robot, who added that while Keniclius&#x27; plan was &quot;unclear&quot;, it had the &quot;greatest ending of a cartoon ever.&quot; &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; rated &quot;The Infinite Vulcan&quot; the 74th best episode of all &quot;Star Trek&quot; episodes. In &quot;Wired&quot; magazine list of episodes to watch after they were posted for free on the official &quot;Star Trek&quot; website, &quot;The Infinite Vulcan&quot; was included specifically because it was the first episode of the franchise to be written by one of the actors.

== Novelization ==
This story was expanded into a novelette by science-fiction author Alan Dean Foster as part of the collection of &quot;The Animated Series&quot; adapted novelizations and was released as part of &quot;Star Trek Log Two&quot;, published in September 1974. The other episodes adapted in the same work were &quot;The Survivor&quot; and &quot;The Lorelei Signal&quot;.

== Home media release ==
&quot;The Infinite Vulcan&quot; was released on LaserDisc as part of the series set. The first release of &quot;Star Trek: The Animated Series&quot; on DVD was through fan-made productions. The official DVD release was on November 21, 2006 in the United States, a single release containing all episodes from both seasons of the television show, and on Blu-ray seven days later. This episode was streamed for free on April 5, 2021 as part of the First Contact Day event on Startrek.com, along with several other episodes and roundtable discussions with &quot;Star Trek&quot; actors.

<text>Republic Airways Inc. is an American regional airline subsidiary of Republic Airways Holdings that operates service as American Eagle, Delta Connection, and United Express using a fleet of Embraer 170 and Embraer 175 regional jets. It is headquartered in Indianapolis, Indiana.

==History==

In 1999, Republic Airways Holdings incorporated a new subsidiary, &quot;Republic Airline, Inc.&quot; but the subsidiary had no activity prior to 2004 and no ability to operate aircraft prior to 2005. In 2004 the holding company activated Republic Airways in reaction to a pilots&#x27; suit against American Airlines.

American had awarded the flying of 44-seat regional jets to Chautauqua Airlines, then the main operating subsidiary of Republic Airways Holdings. However, Chautauqua later started to operate 70-seat regional jets on behalf of United Airlines, and this caused American to be in violation of its pilot union scope clause, which prevented an airline from operating on behalf of American if that airline was operating jet aircraft of more than 50 seats, even if such aircraft were operating on behalf of a carrier other than American. To repair the situation, Republic Airways Holdings activated Republic Airline, and upon Part 121 certification in 2005 allowing Republic Airline to operate commercial service. Republic Airways Holdings then transferred the offending 70-seat regional jets from Chautauqua to Republic Airline. American was then no longer in violation of its pilot union scope clause. Republic Airways Holdings paid $6.6 million to the pilot union of American Airlines to settle the issue.

US Airways&#x27; pilots had a scope clause prohibiting the airline from operating large regional jets such as the Embraer E170. The airline negotiated around this clause by offering flight deck jobs to laid-off US Airways pilots, in a program known as &quot;Jets for Jobs&quot;. This agreement created a subsidiary, MidAtlantic Airways. As part of US Airways&#x27; bankruptcy restructuring, the 25 Embraer E170s delivered to MidAtlantic were bought by Republic to help US Airways come out of bankruptcy; Republic operates them along with additional newly delivered aircraft.

In 2007, Frontier Airlines signed an 11-year service agreement with Republic Airways. Under the agreement, Republic would operate 17 Embraer E170 aircraft for the Frontier Airlines operation. The first aircraft was placed into service in March 2007, and the last aircraft was expected to be placed into service by December 2008. On April 23, 2008, Republic Airways Holdings (parent of Republic Airline) terminated its service agreement with Frontier Airlines, which entered Chapter 11 bankruptcy in early April 2008. Subsequently, Republic Air Holdings purchased Frontier Airlines in bankruptcy. Frontier-branded Republic Airways E190 aircraft provided regional capacity support. In September 2013, Republic Airways Holdings sold Frontier Airlines. As part of the sale, Republic Airways terminated the Frontier branded E190 from flying.

On February 1, 2008, Republic Airways opened a base at John Glenn Columbus International Airport in Columbus, Ohio.

On September 3, 2008, Republic signed a new 10-year codeshare agreement with Midwest Airlines. The aircraft would be based at Kansas City International Airport beginning October 1, 2008. Twelve aircraft would be placed in service with Midwest. On June 23, 2009, Republic announced it would acquire Midwest Airlines for $31 million.

In January 2013, Republic Airways Holdings reached a capacity purchase agreement with American Airlines to operate Embraer E175 airplanes under the American Eagle brand beginning in mid-2013. Republic began service as an American Eagle affiliate on August 1, 2013, from Chicago to New Orleans, Pittsburgh, and Albuquerque.

On February 25, 2016, the airline filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. The airline was hit hard because of pilot shortages, but a new contract ratified in October 2015 helped restructure the airline. At the time of filing, Republic Holdings claimed $2.97 billion in liabilities and $3.56 billion in assets. On November 16, 2016, Republic Airways Holdings filed their Plan of Reorganization with intentions to emerge from Chapter 11 during the first quarter of 2017.

It was announced that parent company Republic Airways Holdings would merge subsidiaries Shuttle America and Republic Airways into one company, with Republic Airways being chosen as the surviving company. On January 31, 2017, Shuttle America merged with Republic Airways. In December 2018, the operating division was renamed Republic Airways to match its parent company.

As of January 31, 2017, Republic Airways has the largest fleet of Embraer E170 and Embraer E175 aircraft in the world.

==Destinations==
As of January 2023, Republic operates for American Eagle, Delta Connection, and United Express.
==Fleet==
===Current fleet===
, the Republic Airways fleet consists of the following aircraft:

===Fleet development===
The Embraer 175 made its United States domestic debut when the first aircraft was delivered to Republic Airways in March 2007. Total orders were for 36 aircraft, which were operated in an 80-seat configuration under the US Airways Express brand name.

In July 2010, Republic ordered a further 24 Embraer E190 aircraft.

In May 2012, Republic Airways agreed to fly the 28 Bombardier Q400s for United Express that bankrupt Pinnacle Airlines planned to return to its lessors. The Q400 fleet was retired in 2017.

Republic Airways Holdings signed a three-year contract in October 2012 with Caesars Entertainment Corporation where its Republic Airways subsidiary would operate five Embraer E190 aircraft to provide more than 1,500 charter flights annually for Caesars. Service began in January 2013. This contract ended in August 2015 and all E190 aircraft were sold or returned to the lease holders.

In January 2013, Republic Airways Holdings reached a capacity purchase agreement with American Airlines to operate 47 Embraer E175 airplanes under the American Eagle brand beginning in mid-2013. The regional jets would be deployed out of American&#x27;s Chicago hub. In addition, Republic would have options to purchase an additional 47 Embraer aircraft beginning in 2015. Republic took first delivery of the E175 jets in July 2013 and service began August 1, 2013, from Chicago to New Orleans, Pittsburgh and Albuquerque. Republic began using Miami as an American Eagle hub in October 2014 and in New York-JFK in May 2015.
In late 2015, it was announced Republic Airways achieved approval from the FAA for Extended Overwater Operations (EOW), which allows Republic to operate up to 162 nautical miles from shore. As of January 31, 2017, only Republic E175 aircraft operating for American Airlines are equipped to operate as an EOW aircraft. American Airlines uses Republic to operate aircraft out of Miami International Airport to various Caribbean and Central American destinations, including the Bahamas, Mexico, Panama, Belize, Honduras, Costa Rica, Turks &amp; Caicos, Cuba, Guadeloupe, and the French West Indies.

In late 2016 it was announced, due to the impending merger with Shuttle America, that the 80-seat Embraer E175s operated for American Eagle (previously US Airways Express) would have the last row of seats removed (4 in total) to conform with Delta&#x27;s scope clause, which limits all regional jets to a maximum of 76 seats. These aircraft were retrofitted to American&#x27;s standard Embraer E175 layout.

On January 31, 2017, all existing aircraft operating under the Shuttle America operating certificate were transferred to the Republic Airline Inc. operating certificate, thus ceasing operations for Shuttle America, and completing the merger process of both subsidiaries. The move made Republic the largest operator of Embraer E170 and Embraer E175 aircraft in the world.

On December 20, 2018, Republic Airways announced that it had finalized a firm order for 100 Embraer E175 aircraft, stating that deliveries for the new aircraft would start in the second half of 2020 

In October 2019, Republic received the first of 30 E175s to be transferred from Compass Airlines upon the cancellation of their contract with Delta.

In September 2021, Republic agreed to sell 11 E170s and 6 E175s to Envoy Air.

==Incidents==
* On 9 April 2017, a passenger was forced off of a Republic-operated United Express flight in Chicago bound for Louisville. The passenger was forced off the flight by Department of Aviation officers after he refused to give up his seat to an airline employee. He attempted to run back onto the aircraft, but was forcibly removed. A video posted on social media showing him being injured and dragged off the plane led to a public outcry against United Airlines.
* On 21 June 2018, a Republic-owned E170 registered N876RW was damaged by a fire while undergoing maintenance at John Glenn Columbus International Airport. The aircraft was deemed to be damaged beyond economical repair.
* On 10 May 2019, a Republic-owned E175 operating Delta Connection flight 5935 was heading towards New York&#x27;s LaGuardia Airport when a suicidal passenger attempted to open a cabin door in mid-flight, causing the pilots to declare an emergency shortly before landing. The situation was brought under control, after which the plane landed safely and was met by law enforcement at the gate.
*On 6 November 2019, a Republic-owned E175 operating American Eagle Flight 4439 returned to Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport after suffering severe controllability issues after takeoff: ATC flight data recorded the crew stating a &quot;trim runaway&quot; and a &quot;stalling situation&quot;. The data shows the aircraft rapidly climbing to 15,100 ft (4,600 m) and slowing down to 160 knots (300 km/h) while performing nearly two full right turns.
* On June 4, 2022, a Republic Airways flight from Indianapolis to Chicago aborted its takeoff after an odor of smoke was reported in the aircraft. The aircraft was evacuated on a taxiway. No injuries were reported.

<doc id="927794" wikidata="Q1090995" url="?curid=927794" title="Thailand at the 2004 Summer Olympics">
<text>Thailand competed at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece, from 13 to 29 August 2004. This was the nation&#x27;s thirteenth appearance at the Olympics, except the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow because of its partial support to the United States boycott.

The National Olympic Committee of Thailand sent a total of 42 athletes to the Games, 24 men and 18 women, to compete in 13 sports; the nation&#x27;s team size was roughly smaller from Sydney by ten athletes. Fourteen of them had previously competed in Sydney, including featherweight boxer and 1996 Olympic champion Somluck Kamsing, and Asia&#x27;s top tennis star Paradorn Srichaphan, who was later appointed by the committee to carry the Thai flag in the opening ceremony. Along with Kamsing, US-based swimmer Ratapong Sirisanont and badminton player Pramote Teerawiwatana became the first Thai athletes to compete in four Olympic Games. Among the sports played by athletes at these Games, Thailand marked its debut in equestrian and taekwondo.

Thailand left Athens with a total of eight medals (three golds, one silver, and four bronze), setting a historic milestone as the nation&#x27;s most successful Games in Olympic history. Thai athletes continued to dominate in boxing and weightlifting, where they each won more than two Olympic medals, including a prestigious gold from Manus Boonjumnong in light welterweight boxing, and Udomporn Polsak, and Pawina Thongsuk in women&#x27;s weightlifting.

<text>Ken Friedman (born September 19, 1949 in New London, Connecticut) is a design researcher. He was a member of Fluxus, an international laboratory for experimental art, architecture, design, and music. Friedman joined Fluxus in 1966 as the youngest member of the classic Fluxus group. He has worked closely with other Fluxus artists and composers such as George Maciunas, Dick Higgins, and Nam June Paik, as well as collaborating with John Cage and Joseph Beuys. He was the general manager of Dick Higgins&#x27;s Something Else Press in the early 1970s. In the 1990s, Friedman&#x27;s work as a management consultant and designer led him to an academic career, first as Professor of Leadership and Strategic Design at the Norwegian School of Management in Oslo, then as Dean of the Faculty of Design at Swinburne University of Technology in Melbourne. Friedman is currently University Distinguished Professor at Swinburne and Chair Professor of Design Innovation Studies at Tongji University.

==Education==
From 1965 to 1966, Friedman studied at Shimer College, a Great Books school then located in Mount Carroll, Illinois. It was at this time that he developed the programs at Radio WRSB that brought him into contact with Dick Higgins and the Something Else Press. While Friedman was at Shimer, he created the score for &quot;A Mandatory Happening&quot;. George Maciunas would produce this as one of Friedman’s first Fluxus boxes.

Friedman received his Master of Arts degree in Interdisciplinary Studies in education, psychology, and social science from San Francisco State University in 1971. He received his doctorate in 1976 from the United States International University. In 2007 Loughborough University in the UK honored Friedman with the degree of Doctor of Science, honoris causa, for outstanding contributions to design research.

==Artistic career==
Recent solo exhibitions of Ken Friedman’s work include Ken Friedman: 99 Events at Stendhal Galleryin New York City, Ken Friedman Art(net)worker Extraordinaire at the University of Iowa Museum of Art in 2000, and Twelve Structures at The Centre of Attention, London, in 2004.

Many museums and galleries presented Friedman&#x27;s work in group exhibitions over the past decade. These include Fluxus and the Essential Questions of Life, a traveling exhibition in 2011 from The Hood Museum of Art, and several exhibitions at the Museum of Modern Art in New York 

Friedman’s work is represented in major museums and galleries around the world, including the Museum of Modern Art and the Guggenheim Museum in New York, the Tate Modern in London, the Hood Museum of Art at Dartmouth College, and Staatsgalerie Stuttgart. The University of Iowa Alternative Traditions in the Contemporary Arts is the official repository of Friedman’s art work, personal papers, and research notes. Archiv Sohm at Staatsgalerie Stuttgart and the Mandeville Department of Special Collections at the University of California hold extensive collections of his work and papers from the 1960s and 1970s.

==Academic career==
In the 1970s he was Director of the Institute for Advanced Studies in Contemporary Art, San Diego, and during the mid-1980s he was President of the Art Economist Corporation in New York. From 1994 to 2009, Friedman was Professor of Leadership and Strategic Design at the Norwegian School of Management in Oslo, as well as professor the Design Research Center at The Danish Design School in Copenhagen from 2003 to 2009. In October 2007, he was appointed Dean of the Faculty of Design at Swinburne University of Technology in Melbourne, a position he held through 2012. Friedman is currently University Distinguished Professor at Swinburne and Chair Professor of Design Innovation Studies at Tongji University.

Friedman is Editor-in-Chief of &quot;She Ji: The Journal of Design, Economics, and Innovation&quot;, a research journal published by Tongji University Press and Elsevier, and he is editor of Design Thinking, Design Theory, a book series from The MIT Press that Friedman edits together with Erik Stolterman of Indiana University.

<text>is an out-of-print Japanese collectible trading card game. It is marketed and produced by Broccoli, which produces games and Anime-related goods.

In the game, the player takes the role of a &quot;Mindbreaker&quot;, who can control and unlock the powers of the game characters. The goal is to defeat other Mindbreakers (players) and to grow stronger. The game continues until the player has defeated all of their opponents, or has been stripped of their powers; thus being knocked out of the game.

Unlike similar TCG, the player fields game characters instead of spells. They must gain control over each character before it can be used in a game. If a player is unable to control a character properly, it may turn on them.

The &quot;Aquarian Age&quot; franchise now supports a PlayStation game, a comic book, and a TV series; &quot;Aquarian Age: Sign for Evolution&quot; featuring a musical score by composer Yuki Kajiura.

==Story==
As far as the history of humanity is concerned, there has always been war. Conflicts overt and covert, known and secret, battles fought that would influence the histories of future generations. Across centuries, three secret but powerful organizations have fought for control, even as mere mortal forces struggled with their own petty wars and attempts at grandeur. These three forces have worked to shape mankind&#x27;s destiny with their powers of magery, savagery, and mysticism all the while keeping away from the eyes of those they control.

Each force was a counterbalance to the other. Arayashiki represented the mysticism of the Eastern world. WIZ-DOM subsisted on the magicks of the Western world. Finally there were the inhuman Darklore, from which tales of were-beasts and changelings abound. Each faction, however, sought also to duel with the others for control and power. Using both their abilities, and their influence over those they controlled, these forces caused many of the great battles humanity knows as part of its bloodstained history. Today, two millennia since it had begun, these three forces were locked in stalemate.

The year 2000 AD, the opening of the 21st century. The Age of Aquarius which astrologers had long since foretold, had finally arrived. Some believe it to be an age of peace, a new world order. Others proclaim it as the coming of the biblical end times. Whatever truth it would be, the Aquarian Age is the age of great changes, during which the shape of humankind would never be the same. From this generation emerged a new breed of human, one with the ability to influence objects and other people with the mere power of their minds. Calling themselves E.G.O., this group of psionics claimed to represent the new evolution in humankind, a new faction that challenged the existing triumvirate for the power to shape destiny.

Another group also emerged; Individuals who have the gift to both empower and control members of the other factions, and using them to fight their battles. This unaligned group&#x27;s members gained control of agents from the previous groups, just as those factions once did mortal men. These were the Mindbreakers, who were loyal to no one but themselves, and served their own personal agendas.

In the midst of this new turmoil was thrown a new and unquantified faction. From the heavens came an alien force of great power, their apparent goal to destroy the human species. Despite this, these aliens have not openly attacked, alternating between study of the four factions and the Mindbreakers, and actively participating in the battles. This mysterious force with no clear goals or purpose, was dubbed Eraser by the other factions due to their terrifying power.

During the chaotic period known in Western astrology as the Aquarian Age, the alien ERASER fleet attacks Earth, ravaging cities. However, a counteroffensive is launched. The four factions - ARAYASHIKI, WIZ-DOM, DARKLORE, and E.G.O. - who have previously been fighting each other for control of Earth, join forces to defeat the ERASERS.

In the aftermath of the conflict, Earth is placed under the unified rule of the Polestar Empire. However, peace is shattered when the Empire begins to use forbidden magic. These dark powers cause dimensional rifts around the world and once again plunge Earth into chaos and warfare.

==Anime==
Aquarian Age was adapted into an animated Japanese television series, &quot;Aquarian Age: Sign for Evolution&quot;.

==Factions of the Aquarian Age==

=== Arayashiki ===
The Arayashiki represent the eastern mages, primarily the onmyouji, who practice magic in theory with the Tao (Yin and Yang). Most of the members of this group seem to primarily represent Japanese mystics, but Chinese (and maybe even Indian) mages are included as well.

Although not as widespread as E.G.O., most Arayashiki members are quite commonly found, even ignored, in modern Asian society. Most of their kind occupy Asia as a whole, with particular concentrations in Japan and China (two of the most socio-politically developed nations in the region). Typical Arayashiki skills include the ability to commune with spirits and nature, all inclined towards the Eastern forms of magic (such as onmyoujitsu). Some are even skilled with martial arts of varying types, as well as Eastern (particularly Japanese) archaic weaponry.

Common types of Arayashiki are: Miko (Japanese shrine-maidens) and other spiritually-inclined occupations. Many martial arts practitioners of the esoteric bent, especially the infamous Ninja, are also surprisingly common among them as bodyguards and spies. Of particular note is that members of the Ainu indigenous tribes of northern Japan also figure quite strongly with them. The remainder of the Arayashiki consist of spirits, especially those of various Asian mythological figures.

The Arayashiki are highly traditionalist, and clash constantly with their direct western opposite, the WIZ-DOM.

The name &quot;Arayashiki&quot; most likely comes from the Japanese word for the Buddhist Yogacharan concept of a store consciousness, the idea that karmic occurrences are &quot;stored&quot; in the unconscious and affect our karma and perceptions of the world.

===WIZ-DOM===
The members of WIZ-DOM represent western magery, which includes (but is not limited to) pagan, druidic, and even kabbalistic magic. These will be quite familiar to people in the west, as they go by many terms such as witches, warlocks, wizards, and all other European-influenced symbols of magery.

WIZ-DOM members hail from all sects of western magic. Some might even be disguised as clerics of an established religion; although whether they are really part of these religions (WIZ-DOM members have been seen in both Catholic and Protestant denominations), it remains to be seen whether these are genuine alliances or mere cover for their true nature.

WIZ-DOM members seem to be rather isolated from most of society. Since their magic is of the western variety, skilled in a wide variety of occult practices. Common WIZ-DOM archetypes include sorceresses, alchemists, priestesses, knights, spirits and ghosts, and artificial beings (such as elementals and golems) created via magic. There are also a lot of scholars, as well as people proficient in fortune-telling techniques and archaic western weaponry.

Western magic emphasises control over the magical forces (as opposed to the emphasis on harmony espoused by Eastern magic and shamanism). WIZ-DOM considers the Arayashiki their mortal enemy. They fight for their own ways and their own homelands and care little for anything else. Well, except power, that is.

===Darklore===
The Darklore faction consists of demihumans and monsters. Under these are the werewolves and other were-creatures, as well as non-humans such as faeries, mermaids and (possibly) elves. Theoretically, they may be the oldest faction among the five, hinting at a pre-human background, but this is still to be confirmed.

An extremely varied faction, Darklore is a conglomeration of ancient, forgotten races. Elves, lycanthropes (were-creatures), demons, mermaids, vampires, oni, fairies, even undead. Almost every beast or creature recounted in tales and myths can draw their origin from Darklore sightings. Obviously, only the more human members of Darklore &quot;(such as lycanthropes, which change from beast to human at will)&quot; can assimilate with human society. Everything but angels and dragons can be lumped under Darklore. Some ancient gods including Ba&#x27;al are included as Darklore

Typical skills vary widely, depending on race and disposition, but there&#x27;s a lot of magical power to be found here, usually magic inherent to a given species.

The creatures of the Darklore faction want the world that was once theirs back, basically to retake earth from what they see as the human taint. Their principal enemies are the WIZ-DOM and Arayashiki, with whom they have fought for centuries.

===E.G.O.===
The group E.G.O. is the newest faction to enter the conflict. They claim to be the next level of human evolution, and possess powerful psionic abilities. Also siding with them are androids &quot;(artificial humanoids)&quot; and cyborgs, the technology of whom might have been taken from Eraser. It&#x27;s interesting to note that most E.G.O. members appear to be the youngest among those involved in this fight, most of them barely in their late teens yet possessing extensive psionic abilities, among other skills.

E.G.O. members are in plain sight and never seen. This is because unlike the isolationist WIZ-DOM or the inhuman Darklore, they are quite sociable, human, and ordinary for the most part. They can be schoolchildren, celebrities, military personnel, teachers, scientists, police, criminals (!), or even menial laborers (waiters/waitresses, maids, etc.). One would never really if the person you&#x27;re talking to know was part of E.G.O. Assorted androids and cyborgs (presumably taken from Eraser) are also among them, well-hidden.

E.G.O. members with occupations tend to be &quot;the best in their fields&quot; (for instance, scientists on the cutting edge of technology—or ahead of it). Typical skills and powers include proficiency with modern or even futuristic (probably more Eraser technology) weapons, knowledge of cybernetics, telekinesis and other psychic powers, and genetic enhancements (Eraser/human hybrids, for example).

The E.G.O. claim to fight for the next generation, for the future of humanity, and they see themselves as the embodiment of that future. They harass the Erasers frequently, and generally take a dim view of the three &quot;old&quot; factions, on account of them being outdated.

NOTE: The name E.G.O. was originally coined for an all-female group, or &quot;Evolutionary Girls Organization&quot;. With the Juvenile Orion expansion and its all-male additional characters, this just didn&#x27;t jibe. As of the second series (Aquarian Age Saga II), the group will include both male and female members, and henceforth will be referred to as the &quot;Evolutionary Generation Organization&quot;.

===Eraser===
The final faction is known as Eraser, the only non-earth based faction. This is the name assigned to them by the other four factions, due to their sheer power. Despite all this power, and their open hostility towards the other four factions, Eraser&#x27;s true origins are unknown, their actions intermittent, and their motives unclear, save for a claim that it plans to eradicate humanity. All that is known is that they are completely alien to the other factions, and for some reason, has decided to involve itself in their power struggles.

Physical descriptions of Eraser vary, but the most notable are the &#x27;Angels&#x27;, that appear very much like the human interpretation of angels, and their immediate subordinates, a reptiloid race that have been called the &#x27;Dragoons&#x27;. They have technology advanced enough that androids, cyborgs, and clones have been manufactured, presumably to act as infiltrators studying the human race and are occasionally involved in the battles. E.G.O. has somehow managed to gain access to some of this technology, which may explain the existence of cyborgs and androids among the E.G.O. as well.

Powers and skills among Angel Erasers vary, but they usually rely heavily on advanced science and technology, particularly weapons development. They also seem to possess the power to create &quot;miracles&quot;, such as the ability to stop time. The Dragoon Erasers are much simpler (one may say brutish)--they are an out and out warrior race; when they do use high technology, it&#x27;s almost always in the form of weapons given to them by the Angels. The androids, cyborgs and clones do whatever the Erasers design them to do, and that covers a wide range of tasks.

There have been many references hinting that Eraser possesses a large battlefleet and that this is but one of the many planets they have encountered. It is possible that Eraser is studying the other four factions and the Mindbreakers (especially the latter, due to their unique abilities), but as to what reason, one can only hazard a guess.

The Erasers are engaged mostly in fighting the E.G.O. The older factions, occupied with their own battles, take little notice of them; the Erasers pay them little heed in return. But the Erasers wish to destroy humanity, and the E.G.O. - self-proclaimed guardians of humanity&#x27;s future - have risen up to stop them.

Towards the end of the first Aquarian Age Saga, Eraser has been driven off by the four Earthbound Factions and Mindbreakers. It is currently unknown whether they will return at a later date.

===Mindbreakers===

The Mindbreakers are an interesting new group involved in this battle. They are a group of men and women who have an odd ability; the power to unlock the potential powers of the Arayashiki, WIZ-DOM, Darklore, E.G.O., and even Eraser factions, as well as to somehow gain control of them. They are not a faction like the other five, since each Mindbreaker has his or her own goals and purposes to achieve, as well as methods to achieve them. This often leads Mindbreakers to battle each other. The victor of such a battle gains the loser&#x27;s power—the members of Arayashiki, WIZ-DOM, Darklore, E.G.O. and Eraser previously under the loser&#x27;s control.

Precisely how a Mindbreaker controls one of these factions, much less how they can awaken the new powers within them, is still unknown. Speculation ranges anywhere from advanced psionic powers to emotional attachment. There&#x27;s no single rule to explain this ability yet, but the presence of a mindbreaker favoring a member of the previously mentioned factions is often enough to tip the balance in a battle.

In the Saga II game, the player assumes the role of Mindbreaker, controlling the characters through use of cards.

===Polestar Empire===
The &quot;Empire&quot; faction is a group of invaders from another dimension, another Earth with a different history. They are fantasy-inspired characters, such as knights, dragons and the undead. Like Eraser, their ultimate goals are unknown.

The Empire faction was introduced in the Saga II series, a &#x27;reboot&#x27; of the Aquarian Age card game that integrates the male characters seen in Juvenile Orion with regular Aquarian age gameplay.

<text>Zubaz () is a brand of shorts and pants, distinctively patterned with colorful stripes, that became popular during the early 1990s. It was primarily marketed as athletic wear for weightlifting and wrestling but found wider success.

==History and description==
In 1988, professional wrestlers Michael Hegstrand &amp; Joseph Laurinaitis brainstormed ideas with Bob Truax and Don Stock, managers at gyms the pair owned, for better quality workout pants. Laurinaitis said, “We need to come up with an idea for pants that we can make for big guys for leisure, sporting events, working out or whatever.” Truax and Stock developed a comfortably baggy pair of shorts with an elastic waistband. Zubaz was registered as a trademark in 1989. Initially, they were marketed as a comfortable, functional pair of shorts for weightlifting.

Hegstrand and Laurinaitis, who owned half the company, helped popularize the pants, wearing them while teaming as the Road Warriors on the NWA on TBS. Soon after, distribution with JCPenney and high profile marketing deals with NFL players such as Dan Marino helped the pants become wildly popular in the United States. The Zubaz company sold $100 million worth of products in 1991 alone. The company slogan is &quot;Dare to be Different.&quot; The company is named after a nonsensical phrase of excitement that Laurinaitis heard on playgrounds growing up in St. Paul.

Although Zubaz began as a line of shorts, the brand was extended into long pants, caps, shirts, and even diapers. The pants are tapered at the ankle, with the outer part of the leg being longer than the inner part. They have an elastic waistband to allow for greater flexibility and movement. The pants were originally created in a zebra print, but later began to be sold in many other prints.

Regardless of the specific design, Zubaz are almost always bright, flashy, and often ostentatious. Zubaz designed the uniforms of several Arena Football League teams in the early 1990s, including the Tampa Bay Storm and the now-defunct New Orleans Night. However, these designs were considered outlandish and were soon replaced.

In a 1993 survey in &quot;Inside Sports&quot; magazine, Zubaz finished third in the voting for &quot;Worst Thing to Happen in Sports&quot; that year. Ahead of it were the retirement of Michael Jordan and the death of wrestler Dino Bravo.

The long pants were the most popular item in the product line. Despite the decline in popularity, fans still sometimes wear Zubaz pants in team colors at professional football games.

Zubaz manufactured &quot;slider shorts.&quot; These shorts had the famous wild patterns at the bottom of the garment while the rest of the garment displayed the name and logo of the sport team and the Zubaz name.

The original business went bankrupt in 1996, and Truax and Stock bought back the trademark rights. In 2007, Zubaz resurfaced, offering a limited production release of the original classic Zubaz patterns. In 2014 the brand fully resurfaced with a wider selection on its internet storefront. The revived brand opened its first storefront in Fashion Outlets of Niagara Falls, a mall in Niagara Falls, New York, in November 2016; Zubaz chose Western New York as its first brick-and-mortar location because of the brand&#x27;s particular association with the Buffalo Bills, as fans of the franchise have consistently been one of the brand&#x27;s most loyal customer bases.

On July 16, 2008, the Saint Paul Saints independent professional baseball team wore Zubaz pants during their game against the Sioux City Explorers. The bases were also painted in a recognizable Zubaz tiger-striped pattern. On the December 6 edition of professional wrestling TV show &quot;TNA Impact&quot;, Christopher Daniels and Kazarian wrestled the main event in pink and black Zubaz pants. The Russian curling team wore Zubaz pants in the 2014 Winter Olympics. The Detroit Tigers also wore Zubaz pants in 2017.

Minnesota Vikings mascot Viktor the Viking usually wears team-colored Zubaz pants.

<doc id="927827" wikidata="Q141955" url="?curid=927827" title="Jamaica at the 2004 Summer Olympics">
<text>Jamaica competed at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece, from 13 to 29 August 2004. This was the nation&#x27;s fourteenth appearance at the Summer Olympics as an independent nation, although it had previously appeared in the first four editions as a British colony, and as part of the West Indies Federation. The Jamaica Olympic Association sent a total of 47 athletes to the Games, 22 men and 25 women, to compete only in track and field (the largest ever by sport), badminton, shooting, and swimming. For the second consecutive time in Olympic history, Jamaica was represented again by more female than male athletes.

With Merlene Ottey&#x27;s sudden demise to compete for Slovenia at these Games, the Jamaican team featured several Olympic medalists from Sydney, including track hurdler Danny McFarlane and sprinter Sandie Richards, who followed Ottey&#x27;s path as another Jamaican athlete to compete in five Olympic Games since her debut in 1988. Being the oldest and the most sophisticated athlete of the team, Richards was appointed by the committee to become the nation&#x27;s flag bearer in the opening ceremony. Other notable Jamaican athletes also featured the Atkinson swimming clan Janelle, Jevon, and Alia, and top medal favorite Asafa Powell in the men&#x27;s 100 metres.

Jamaica left Athens with a sterling record of five medals (two golds, one silver, and two bronze), being marked as an enormous improvement from Sydney, where the nation failed to claim a single gold. After picking up the first Olympic medal of her illustrious career, sprinter Veronica Campbell sought her sights to break a historic milestone as she became the first Jamaican athlete in history to claim an individual Olympic title in the women&#x27;s 200 metres. She was also named the most decorated Jamaican athlete of the Games, after helping out her relay team produce a brilliant finish with their second gold and collecting the bronze earlier in the 100 metres. Meanwhile, Danny McFarlane added a second silver to his Olympic career hardware in the men&#x27;s 400 metres hurdles, finishing behind Dominican Republic&#x27;s Félix Sánchez by only a few hurdles left in the track.

<text>Robert Adams (born 1937) is an American photographer who has focused on the changing landscape of the American West. His work first came to prominence in the mid-1970s through his book &quot;The New West&quot; (1974) and his participation in the exhibition &quot;New Topographics: Photographs of a Man-Altered Landscape&quot; in 1975. He has received two Guggenheim Fellowships, a MacArthur Fellowship, the Deutsche Börse Photography Prize and the Hasselblad Award.
== Early life and education ==
Robert Hickman Adams was born on May 8, 1937, in Orange, New Jersey to Lois Hickman Adams and Ross Adams. In 1940 the family moved to Madison, New Jersey where his younger sister Carolyn was born. Then in 1947 they moved to Madison, Wisconsin for five years, where he contracted polio at age 12 in 1949 in his back, left arm, and hand but was able to recover. They moved one last time, in 1952, to Wheat Ridge, Colorado, a suburb of Denver, when his father secured a job in Denver. They moved to Colorado partly because of the chronic bronchial problems that he suffered from in Madison, New Jersey around age 5 as an attempt to help alleviate those problems. He continued to suffer from asthma and allergy problems.

During his childhood, Adams often accompanied his father on walks and hikes through the woods on Sunday afternoons. He also enjoyed playing baseball in open fields and working with his father on carpentry projects. He was an active Boy Scout, and was also active with the Methodist church that his family attended. He and his father made several raft trips through Dinosaur National Monument, and during his adolescent years he worked at boys&#x27; camps at Rocky Mountain National Park in Colorado. He also took trips on pack horses and went mountain climbing. He and his sister began visiting Denver Art Museum. Adams also learned to like reading. In 1955, he hunted for the last time.

Adams enrolled in the University of Colorado, Boulder in 1955, and attended it for his first year, but decided to transfer the next year to the University of Redlands in California where he received his B.A. in English in 1959. He continued his graduate studies at the University of Southern California and received his PhD in English Literature, in 1965.

In 1960 while at Redlands, he met and married Kerstin Mornestam, a Swedish native, who shared the same interest in the arts and nature. Robert and Kerstin spent their first few summers together in Oregon along the coast, where they took long walks on the beach and spent their evenings reading.

== Work ==

In 1963 they moved back to Colorado, and Adams began teaching English at Colorado College in Colorado Springs. In 1963, Adams bought a 35 mm camera and began to take pictures mostly of nature and architecture. He soon read complete sets of &quot;Camera Work&quot; and &quot;Aperture&quot; at the Colorado Springs Fine Arts Center. He learned photographic technique from Myron Wood, a professional photographer who lived in Colorado. While finishing his dissertation, he began to photograph in 1964. In 1966, he began to teach only part-time to have more time to photograph. He met John Szarkowski, the curator of photography at the Museum of Modern Art, on a trip to New York City in 1969. The museum later bought four of his prints. In 1970, he began working as a full-time photographer.

Critic Sean O&#x27;Hagan, writing in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, said &quot;his subject has been the American west: its vastness, its sparse beauty and its ecological fragility. [. . .] What he has photographed constantly – in varying shades of grey – is what has been lost and what remains&quot; and that &quot;his work&#x27;s other great subtext&quot; is silence.

<doc id="927830" wikidata="Q1533348" url="?curid=927830" title="Go motion">
<text>Go motion is a variation of stop motion animation which incorporates motion blur into each frame involving motion. It was co-developed by Industrial Light &amp; Magic and Phil Tippett. Stop motion animation can create a distinctive and disorienting staccato effect because the animated object is perfectly sharp in every frame, since each frame is shot with the object perfectly still. Real moving objects in similar scenes have motion blur because they move while the camera&#x27;s shutter is open. Filmmakers use a variety of techniques to simulate motion blur, such as moving the model slightly during the exposure of each film frame, or placing a glass plate smeared with petroleum jelly in front of the camera lens to blur the moving areas.

== History ==
In the 1920s, Ladislas Starevich started using this technique by the time he started making films in France. He moved the puppet or the set during the exposure of the frame to create motion blur. Some of this can be seen in films like &quot;The Midnight Wedding&quot;, &quot;Love in Black and White&quot;, &quot;The Voice of the Nightingale&quot; or &quot;The Little Parade&quot; and more extensively in the battle scene of &quot;The Queen of the Butterflies&quot; (1924) and &quot;The Mascot&quot; (1933).

Phil Tippett and Industrial Light &amp; Magic later recreated the go motion technique for some shots of the tauntaun creatures and AT-AT walkers in the 1980 &quot;Star Wars&quot; film &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot;. After that, go motion was used for many other movies: for the dragon in &quot;Dragonslayer&quot; (1981), the dinosaurs in the prehistoric documentaries &quot;Prehistoric Beast&quot; (1984) and &quot;Dinosaur!&quot; (1985), the harpy sequence in &quot;Young Sherlock Holmes&quot; (1985), the lord demon creature in &quot;Howard the Duck&quot; (1986), the winged demon in &quot;The Golden Child&quot; (1986), the extraterrestrial living flying machines in &quot;Batteries Not Included&quot; (1987), and the two-headed Eborsisk dragon in &quot;Willow&quot; (1988). The last film using go motion was &quot;Coneheads&quot; (1993). Other minor sequences using go motion appeared in films like the first three &quot;Indiana Jones&quot; installments (1981–1989) and &quot;E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial&quot; (1982).

With the completion of &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; (1993), Tippett Studio abandoned go motion and fully converted its teams and equipment to CG computer-graphics.

==Methods for creating motion blur==

=== Petroleum jelly ===
This crude but reasonably effective technique, known as &quot;vaselensing&quot;, involves smearing petroleum jelly (&quot;Vaseline&quot;) on a plate of glass in front of the camera lens, then cleaning and reapplying it after each shot—a time-consuming process, but one which creates a blur around the model. The technique was used for the endoskeleton in &quot;The Terminator,&quot; by Jim Danforth to blur the pterodactyl&#x27;s wings in Hammer Films&#x27; &quot;When Dinosaurs Ruled the Earth&quot;, and by Randal William Cook on the &quot;terror dogs&quot; sequence in &quot;Ghostbusters&quot;.

===Bumping the puppet===
Gently bumping or flicking the puppet before taking the frame produces a slight blur; however, care must be taken that the puppet does not move too much, and that props or set pieces are not moved.

===Moving the table===
Moving the table on which the model is standing while the film is being exposed creates a slight, realistic blur. This technique was developed by Ladislas Starevich: when the characters ran, he moved the set in the opposite direction. This is seen in &quot;The Little Parade&quot; when the ballerina is chased by the devil. Starevich also used this technique on his films &quot;The Eyes of the Dragon&quot;, &quot;The Magical Clock&quot; and &quot;The Mascot&quot;. Aardman Animations used this for the train chase in &quot;The Wrong Trousers&quot; and again during the lorry chase in &quot;A Close Shave&quot;. In both cases the cameras were moved physically during a 1-2 second exposure. The technique was revived for the full-length &quot;Wallace &amp; Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit&quot;.

===Go motion===
The most sophisticated technique was originally developed for the film &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot; and used for some shots of the tauntauns and was later used on films like &quot;Dragonslayer&quot; and is quite different from traditional stop motion. The model is essentially a rod puppet. The rods are attached to motors which are linked to a computer that can record the movements as the model is traditionally animated. When enough movements have been made, the model is reset to its original position, the camera rolls and the model is moved across the table. Because the model is moving during shots, motion blur is created.

A variation of go motion was used in &quot;E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial&quot; to partially animate the children on their bicycles.

Go motion was originally planned to be used extensively for the dinosaurs in &quot;Jurassic Park&quot;, until Steven Spielberg decided to try out the swiftly developing techniques of CG instead.

Today, the mechanical method of achieving motion blur using go motion is rarely used, as it is more complicated, slow, and labor-intensive than computer generated effects. However, the motion blurring technique still has potential in real stop motion movies where the puppet&#x27;s motions are supposed to be somewhat realistic. Many professional visual effects applications now allow for motion blur to be simulated in post production.

<doc id="927832" wikidata="Q2360566" url="?curid=927832" title="Hairball">
<text>A hairball is a small collection of hair or fur formed in the stomach of animals, and uncommonly in humans, that is occasionally vomited up when it becomes too big. Hairballs are primarily a tight elongated cylinder of packed fur, but may include bits of other elements such as swallowed food. Animals with hairballs are sometimes mistaken as having other conditions of the stomach such as lymphosarcoma, tuberculosis, and tumor of the spleen. Cats are especially prone to hairball formation since they groom themselves by licking their fur, and thereby ingest it. Rabbits are also prone to hairballs because they groom themselves in the same fashion as cats, but hairballs are especially dangerous for rabbits because they cannot regurgitate them. Due to the fragility of their digestive systems, hairballs in rabbits must be treated immediately or they may stop feeding and ultimately die from dehydration. Cattle are also known to accumulate hairballs but, as they do not vomit, these are found usually after death and can be quite large.
== Clinical significance ==
A &quot;trichobezoar&quot; is a bezoar (a mass found trapped in the gastrointestinal system) formed from the ingestion of hair. Trichobezoars are often associated with trichotillomania (compulsive hair pulling). Trichobezoars are rare, but can be fatal if undetected. Surgical intervention is often required.

== Society and culture ==
Although uncommon in humans, some hairballs have been reported. These hairballs occur when hair strands collect in the stomach and are unable to be ejected due to not enough friction with the surface of the gastric mucosa. Hairballs are often seen in young girls as a result of trichophagia, trichotillomania, and pica. In 2003, a 3-year-old girl in Red Deer, Alberta, Canada, had a grapefruit-sized hairball surgically removed from her stomach; in 2006, an 18-year-old woman from Chicago, Illinois, had a hairball surgically removed from her stomach; and in 2014, a 9-pound hairball was removed from the stomach of an 18-year-old in Kyrgyzstan. Hairballs can be quite hazardous in humans since hair cannot be digested or passed by the human gastrointestinal system, and (assuming it is identified) even vomiting may be ineffective at removing the hair mass. This can result in the general impairment of the digestive system.

<doc id="927844" wikidata="Q569280" url="?curid=927844" title="Java Authentication and Authorization Service">
<text>Java Authentication and Authorization Service, or JAAS, pronounced &quot;Jazz&quot;, is the Java implementation of the standard Pluggable Authentication Module (PAM) information security framework.
JAAS was introduced as an extension library to the Java Platform, Standard Edition 1.3 and was integrated in version 1.4.

JAAS has as its main goal the separation of concerns of user authentication so that they may be managed independently. While the former authentication mechanism contained information about where the code originated from and who signed that code, JAAS adds a marker about who runs the code. By extending the verification vectors JAAS extends the security architecture for Java applications that require authentication and authorization modules.

== Administration ==
For the system administrator, JAAS consists of two kinds of configuration file:
*codice_1: specifies how to plug vendor-supplied login modules into particular applications
*codice_2: specifies which identities (users or programs) are granted which permissions

For example, an application may have this file indicating how different authentication mechanisms are to be run to authenticate the user:

 PetShopApplication {
 com.sun.security.auth.module.LdapLoginModule sufficient;
 com.foo.SmartcardLoginModule requisite;
 com.sun.security.auth.module.UnixLoginModule required debug=true;

== Application interface ==

For the application developer, JAAS is a standard library that provides:
* a representation of identity (&quot;Principal&quot;) and a set of credentials (&quot;Subject&quot;)
* a login service that will invoke your application callbacks to ask the user things like username and password. It returns a new &quot;Subject&quot;
* a service that tests if a Subject was granted a permission by an administrator.

== Security system integration ==

For the security system integrator, JAAS provides interfaces:
* to provide your identity namespace to applications
* to attach credentials to threads (&quot;Subject&quot;)
* for developing login modules. Your module invokes callbacks to query the user, checks their response and generates a &quot;Subject&quot;.

== Login Modules ==
Login modules are primarily concerned with authentication rather than authorization and form a widely used component of JAAS. A login module is required to implement the codice_3 interface, which specifies the following methods:

Note: A codice_4 is the user that is attempting to log in.

*initialize: Code to initialize the login module, usually by storing the parameters passed into appropriate fields of the codice_5.
*login: Actually check the credentials provided via an codice_6 that implements the codice_7 interface (e.g. check against a database). This method could prompt the user for their login and password or it could use details previously obtained. It is important to note here that, if invalid credentials are supplied then a codice_8 should be thrown (rather than returning false, which indicates that this login module should be ignored, which potentially allows authentication to succeed).
*commit: The identity of the subject has been verified, so code in this method sets up the codice_9 and codice_10 (roles) for the successfully authenticated subject. This method has to be written carefully in enterprise applications as Java EE application servers often expect the relationships between the codice_9 and codice_12 objects to be set up in a certain way. This method should throw a codice_8 if authentication fails (e.g. a user has specified an incorrect login or password).
*abort: Called if the authentication process itself fails. If this method returns false, then this Login Module is ignored.
*logout: Code that should be executed upon logout (e.g. could remove the codice_9 from the codice_4 or could invalidate a web session).

Login modules can provide single sign on (SSO) via a particular SSO protocol/framework (e.g. SAML, OpenID, and SPNEGO), can check for the presence of hardware security tokens (e.g. USB token), etc. In an n-tier application, codice_16 can be present on both the client side and server side.

=== LoginModule (codice_3) ===
Login modules are written by implementing this interface; they contain the actual code for authentication. It can use various mechanisms to authenticate user credentials. The code could retrieve a password from a database and compare it to the password supplied to the module.

=== LoginContext (codice_18) ===
The login context is the core of the JAAS framework which kicks off the authentication process by creating a Subject. As the authentication process proceeds, the subject is populated with various principals and credentials for further processing.

=== Subject (codice_19) ===
A subject represents a single user, entity or system –in other words, a client– requesting authentication.

=== Principal (codice_20) ===
A principal represents the face of a subject. It encapsulates features or properties of a subject. A subject can contain multiple principals.

=== Credentials ===
Credentials are nothing but pieces of information regarding the subject in consideration. They might be account numbers, passwords, certificates etc. As the credential represents some important information, the further interfaces might be useful for creating a proper and secure credential – codice_21 and codice_22. Suppose that after the successful authentication of the user you populate the subject with a secret ID (in the form of a credential) with which the subject can execute some critical services, but the credential should be removed after a specific time. In that case, one might want to implement the codice_23 interface. codice_24 might be useful if a credential has only a limited timespan in which it is valid.
