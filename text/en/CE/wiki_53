<text>Djibouti (also called Djibouti City and Jibuti in early Western texts) is the capital city of the Republic of Djibouti. It is located in the coastal Djibouti Region on the Gulf of Tadjoura.

Djibouti has a population of around 780,000 inhabitants, which counts for 73% of the country&#x27;s population. The settlement was founded in 1888 by the French, on land leased from the ruling Somali and Afar Sultans. During the ensuing period, it served as the capital of French Somaliland and its successor the French Territory of the Afars and Issas.

==History==

There is evidence of human settlement on the eastern coastline of Djibouti dating back to the Bronze Age.
From 1862 until 1894, the land to the north of the Gulf of Tadjoura was called &quot;Obock&quot; and was ruled by Issa and Afar Sultans, local authorities with whom France signed various treaties between 1883 and 1887 to first gain a foothold in the region. The exchange of Franco-British diplomatic notes of 2 and 9 February 1888 fixed the territorial limit between the colonies of the two countries; leaving explicitly under French authority the southern coasts of the Gulf of Tadjoura, including a peninsula composed of insubmersible plateaux, Ras Djibouti as a highly strategic location, a future bridgehead for French designs in the rest of Africa and Asia. It is then that this point begins to be used as departure for caravans towards Harar.
The French subsequently founded Djibouti in 1888, in a previously uninhabited stretch of coast. According to one account, this was due to &quot;its superiority to Obok both in respect to harbour accommodation and in nearness to Harrar.&quot; Ambouli was a small village before the French arrived, about south of Ras Djiboutil. Ambouli is identified with the city of Canbala by O.G.S. Crawford, appearing in Muhammad al-Idrisi&#x27;s map of 1192 on the coast of the Horn of Africa, southeast of the straits of Bab-el-Mandeb, and with Cambaleh, a town where the Venetian traveler Bragadino, a thirteenth-century European visitor to Ethiopia, resided for eight years. In 1896, the settlement was made the capital of French Somaliland.
The main purpose of the French interest in colonizing the region was to protect their trade routes to Madagascar and Indochina from the encroachment of other European powers. The town later grew considerably in size following the construction of the Franco-Ethiopian Railway. In 1895, Djibouti, which, not so long ago, was just a peninsula, already had 5,000 inhabitants. Many Issa and Afar nomads left their herds to settle here, built houses on what is now the downtown area. They became dockers and constitute the first local proletariat. The French and natives built hotels, houses, mosques and churches. The Yemeni, Egyptian, Greek, Armenian and Italian merchants and traders flocked to this promise that Djibouti represented. Additionally, the rich agricultural southern area of Ambouli continued to flourish due to an abundance of date palm farms and orchards. Djibouti did not attract as many boats as Aden. In 1896, Léonce Lagarde became the first governor of the French Somali Coast, a new name for the French dependencies in the region. At the start of the 20th century, Djibouti had 10,000 inhabitants and was considered a major regional port. Its main activity remains the supply of French ships en route to Indochina or Madagascar. Only 150,000 tonnes of freight per year were handled. In addition, the railway line has not yet been fully exploited.

Although the initial French efforts to establish commercial influence in the region proved to be unsuccessful enough to require a government bailout, the Franco-Ethiopian Railway itself was a success and allowed Djibouti&#x27;s commerce to quickly eclipse the former caravan-based trade carried on with nearby Zeila in British Somaliland. Djibouti became the center of exports from southern Ethiopia and the Ogaden, including trade in Harari coffee and khat. Djibouti began to develop as a commercial center. On 12 July 1926, the Fontainebleau, a Messageries Maritimes steamer loaded with cotton and heading for China caught fire while approaching Djibouti. The captain decided to flood the holds and run aground his ship in the middle of the harbor of Djibouti, causing significant inconvenience for port traffic. The city then proposed using the wreck as a promontory of a new deep-water port, connecting it to the Marabout plateau by a 700-meter jetty. The idea was accepted and work began in 1931. The first phase was completed in 1935 and considerably increased port and rail traffic.In 1933, Djibouti was the first town to be wired to electricity in French Somaliland, and an oil terminal was built in 1937.
During the Second World War, Djibouti was hit by Italian airstrikes on 21 June 1940, which killed many people in the town. The anti-aircraft fire was intense and two Italian aircraft failed to return, but fires and explosions were seen in Djibouti. Overnight, several waves of Savoia-Marchetti SM.81 bombers attacked the port facilities. After the defeat of France the colony came under the control of the pro-Axis Vichy government. By that time, the Allied offensive against the Italians included a blockade of French Somaliland. On 25 September the RAF launched several airstrikes on the city, prompting governor Pierre Nouailhetas to institute a brutal reign of terror against Europeans and African inhabitants of the city. Famine set in and malnutrition-related diseases took many lives, 70% of them women and children, and many townsfolk left for the hinterland. The locals named the blockade the carmii, a word for a type of sorghum usually reserved for cattle, but used as human food at the height of the famine. The head doctor at the hospital committed suicide in despair. Only a few Arab dhows (boutres) managed to run the blockade to Djibouti and Obock and only two French ships from Madagascar managed to run it.

The Japanese declaration of war (7 December 1941) gave the colony some respite, since the Royal Navy were forced to withdraw all but two ships from the blockade for use in the Far East. The rule of Nouailhetas was too brutal for even the authoritarian leaders at Vichy to stand for. In October 1942 he was recalled and forced to retire without a pension, Following the war, he escaped to Portugal. He returned to face a military tribunal and was acquitted on 17 July 1953, which sparked outrage in Djibouti. 

The Commander-in-Chief, East Africa, William Platt, codenamed the negotiations for the surrender of French Somaliland &quot;Pentagon&quot;, because there were five sides: himself, the Vichy governor, the Free French, the British minister at Addis Ababa and the United States. Christian Raimond Dupont, the governor of French Somaliland, surrendered and Colonel Raynal&#x27;s troops crossed back into French Somaliland on 26 December 1942, completing its liberation. The official handover took place at 10:00 p.m. on 28 December. The first governor appointed under the Free French was André Bayardelle.

In 1946, Djibouti received the status of overseas territory. An elected territorial assembly was created then, in 1956, a government council charged, under the chairmanship of the head of the territory, with the management of local affairs. At the same time, fiscal, customs and monetary measures are put in place to promote the development of the deep-water port, to finally compete with Aden. Port facilities expanded considerably and could afford to accommodate 2,000 ships per year. Djibouti becomes a free port and abandons the free zone. In 1948, a new currency, the Côte Française des Somalis, was created, pegged to the gold standard and convertible into dollars.
In August 1966, an official visit to the territory by then French President, General Charles de Gaulle, was also met with demonstrations and rioting. In response to the protests, de Gaulle ordered another referendum. On 19 March 1967, a second plebiscite was held to determine the fate of the territory. Initial results supported a continued but looser relationship with France. However, the referendum was again marred by reports of vote rigging on the part of the French authorities, voters rejected independence by a 50-point margin. Announcement of the plebiscite results sparked civil unrest, including several deaths.

The population of Djibouti was growing rapidly, from officially about 17,000 inhabitants in 1947. In 1949, the plan of Djibouti consisted of four main features: a hierarchical system of streets laid out in a grid, large blocks consisting of small-scale domestic dwellings, the organization of these blocks around central open spaces, and the concentration of cultural institutions to form a civic center. It then became the headquarters of the succeeding French Territory of the Afars and Issas.

When Djibouti declared Independence on 27 June 1977, the population of Djibouti was over 110,000, the city has since served as the administrative and commercial capital of the Republic of Djibouti.

It is lowest during the rainy period, when there is some coastal fog and greater cloud coverage as warm air passes over the cool sea surface. However, precipitation is highly variable and long periods without any rainfall occur throughout the year. Unusual episodes of heavy rain sometimes occur, with a maximal falling in November 1949.

This climate zone has summers that reach a maximum temperature of and a minimum temperature of . Winters have average nighttime temperatures of and a daytime maximum temperatures of . There are barely any days in the year without sunshine, and even during the winter there are many clear days.


==Demographics==


Djibouti is a multi-ethnic town. It had a population of around 777,000 residents (including suburbs like Balbala) in 2024, making it by far the largest settlement in the country. The largest ethnic group are the Somali and the second largest being Afars, both Cushitic speaking Cushitic peoples. The population of Djibouti City has risen exponentially with the successive waves of immigrants and refugees arriving throughout the 20th century. Many of the immigrants arrived from Ethiopia and Somalia in 1985 and 1991. In 2001 many undocumented immigrants, were expelled from Djibouti. Another mass wave of Yemeni refugees from Yemen arrived in 2015. Djibouti City was nicknamed the &quot;French Hong Kong in the Red Sea&quot; due to its cosmopolitan urbanism. In 2023, the government of Djibouti launched a major campaign to combat illegal immigration, citing security and public health concerns.

The majority of local residents speak Somali (303,100 speakers) or Afar (101,200 speakers) as a first language, which are the mother tongues of the Somali and Afar ethnic groups, respectively and the two main demographic groups in the city. Both languages belong to the larger Afroasiatic family. There are two official languages in Djibouti: Arabic (Afroasiatic) and French (Indo-European).

Arabic is of social, cultural and religious importance. In formal settings, it consists of Modern Standard Arabic. Colloquially, about 40,000 local residents speak the Ta&#x27;izzi-Adeni Arabic dialect, also known as &quot;Southern Yemeni Arabic&quot; due to Yemeni immigrants. French was inherited from the colonial period and is the primary language of instruction. About 14,200 Djiboutians speak it as a first language. Immigrant languages include Omani Arabic (38,900 speakers) and Amharic (1,400 speakers).

Djibouti&#x27;s population is predominantly Muslim. Islam is observed by 94% of the nation&#x27;s population (around 740,000 ), whereas the remaining 6% of residents are Christian adherents. The Diocese of Djibouti serves the small local Catholic population, which it estimates numbered around 7,000 individuals in 2006.

A few of the building fronts have been renovated and date back to the 19th century. The Place of 27 June in the city center is also distinguished by its Moorish-inspired arches. Due to its numerous exotic edifices and structures, the city has also been likened to a European settlement. Since independence, the people of Djibouti have introduced new infrastructure and technology, which has led to new and innovative building concepts, ideas and construction techniques. Notable taller architecture in Djibouti City includes the Mezz Tower, SALAAM Tower and East Africa Bank. Djibouti City is the headquarters of the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD).

Originally a modest-sized facility, the airport grew considerably in size in the post-independence period after numerous successive renovation projects. Outbound international travel from the Djibouti-Ambouli International Airport accounts for the majority of all air passengers traveling to and from Djibouti. Due to its strategic location, the facility acts as a civil aviation hub for the rest of the country.

However, the standard-gauge railway is built on a new, straighter right-of-way that allows for much higher speeds. New stations have been built outside city centres, and the old stations have been decommissioned. On 10 January 2017, the 100 km section of Djibouti side was inaugurated in a ceremony held in the new station by Djibouti&#x27;s President Ismail Omar Guelleh and Ethiopia&#x27;s prime minister Hailemariam Dessalegn. There are two local railway stations: a passenger station at Nagad, and a freight station at the Port of Doraleh.

<text>Sveg () is a locality and the seat of Härjedalen Municipality in Jämtland County, Sweden with 2,547 inhabitants in 2010.

==Overview==
Sveg is the largest urban area in Härjedalen and the fourth largest in the county of Jämtland. The Ljusnan river flows through the city.
Sveg is located on Riksväg 84 which runs from Hudiksvall in Gävleborg County to the Norwegian border where it connects with Fylkesvei 31 
providing a route to Røros.

The addition of railway lines, Orsa–Svegs Järnväg between Orsa and Sveg in 1909 together with connection line from 
Sveg to Brunflo in 1922 and between Sveg and Hede in 1924, supported the development of large forest companies in the area.

==Hydroelectric power plants==
Sveg Power Plant (&quot;Svegs kraftverk&quot;) is a hydroelectric power plant that began to be built in 1972. The work was greatly accelerated as the energy crisis increased the need for Swedish energy production. The power plant was commissioned in 1975. The power plant is located at the 18 meter high dam next to Lake Svegssjön, a water reservoir that was created when the Ljusnan, Veman and Härjån rivers were dammed up in 1975.
There are two power plant facilities directly adjacent to the lake. Svegs kraftverk is the larger of the facilities, and the dam itself, is located near Sveg. The smaller power plant located at Kvarnforsen just south of Herrö was built in 1966 and is owned by Härjeåns Kraft AB.
==Sveg Church==
Sveg Church (&quot;Svegs kyrka&quot;) is located in central Sveg. The church is of stone with towers and narrower sacristy. It was built in 1845–47. The present church is believed to have been preceded by at least three prior church buildings, the first of which was probably built in the late 1000s. Construction was under the direction of Jacob Norin (1795–1864) from Norrala in Hälsingland. The church includes an altar from 1623 and a pulpit from 1649. The church bell was cast at Stockholm in 1683.

==Climate==
Sveg has a relatively mild subarctic climate. It has certain continental features, being prone to heat and cold extremes with an all-time record of and a cold extreme of , although the latter was set in the 19th century. A more recent reading was in January 1987 during a chilling cold wave that struck Northern Europe. In spite of it being in the middle of the Scandinavian landmass on such a high latitude and a bit elevated, the winters are somewhat milder than expected, due to the mild North Atlantic air that often raises temperatures. Summer days are often warm, many times averaging around , but nights are regularly cool, and frost can be recorded even in the midst of summer. In terms of Scandinavian climate, Sveg is an anomaly in that December is at least as cold as February, both averaging similar means.

== Literature ==
Swedish author Henning Mankell (1948–2015) was brought up in Sveg, where his father was a district judge. Sveg is the setting for his crime novel &quot;Danslärarens återkomst&quot; (2000) which was translated by Laurie Thompson (1938–2015) into English as The Return of the Dancing Master&quot;.&quot;

<text>Hammarstrand is a locality and the seat of Ragunda Municipality in Jämtland County, Sweden with 1,052 inhabitants in 2010. The town is host to a bobsleigh and luge track. It was built on the dry bed of the former lake Ragundasjön, which drained suddenly and catastrophically in 1796.

==Bobsleigh and luge track==
Constructed in 1964, the track was 1045 meters long with 11 curves and a start height of 900 meters.
Its last World Cup luge competition was held in 1990. Until the completion of the bobsleigh and luge track used for the 1994 Winter Olympics at Lillehammer in 1992, it was the only track of its kind in Scandinavia. The track was the last natural track to host the FIL European Luge Championships and was the last natural track to host the FIL World Luge Championships until the 2000 event in St. Moritz, Switzerland. Its last use was in 2001.

<doc id="920732" wikidata="Q452484" url="?curid=920732" title="Ligroin">
<text>Ligroin is the petroleum fraction consisting mostly of C7 and C8 hydrocarbons and boiling in the range 90‒140 °C (194–284 °F). The fraction is also called heavy naphtha. Ligroin is used as a laboratory solvent. Products under the name ligroin can have boiling ranges as low as 60‒80 °C and may be called light naphtha. 

The name &quot;ligroin&quot; (or &quot;ligroine&quot; or &quot;ligroïne&quot;) appeared as early as 1866.

== Standards ==
Ligroin is assigned the CAS Registry Number 8032-32-4, which is also applied to many other products, particularly the lower boiling ones, called petroleum spirit, petroleum ether and petroleum benzine.

== Use as fuel ==
Ligroin was used to refuel the world&#x27;s first production automobile, the Benz Patent-Motorwagen, on a long distance journey between Mannheim and Pforzheim. Bertha Benz added ligroin to the vehicle at a pharmacy in Wiesloch, making it the first filling station in history.

The first functional diesel engine could also run on ligroin.

<text>ClickWorkers was a small NASA experimental project that uses public volunteers (nicknamed &quot;clickworkers&quot; on the site) for scientific tasks. Clickworkers are able to work when, and for however long they choose, doing routine analysis that would normally require months of work by scientists or graduate students. The web site and database were created and maintained by one engineer, Bob Kanefsky, and advised by two scientists, Nadine Barlow and Virginia Gulick. The pilot study was sponsored by the NASA Ames Director&#x27;s Discretionary Fund.

As of March 31, 2020, the Clickworkers volunteer program appears to be defunct. None of the links to the program are functional, as of that date.

== Identifying Martian craters ==
The original phase ran from November 2000 to September 2001, identifying and classifying the age of craters on Mars images from Viking Orbiter that had already been analyzed by NASA. The goal was to answer two meta-science questions:
# Is the public ready, willing, and able to help science?
# Does this new way of powering science analysis produce results that are just as good as the traditional way?

In February 2001 clickworkers started processing new images from Mars Global Surveyor, surveying small craters never before cataloged. Clickworkers also searched Mars images for &quot;honeycomb&quot; terrain, although no further images were discovered and it is suspected that this is an illusory feature type. Their analysis might potentially be useful for scientists, although there are no specific plans for using it yet.

, new beta tasks were up on the Clickworker site. This time workers were being asked to help catalog Mars landforms in one of two ways. In the first task, high resolution images from the HiRISE camera on the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter are displayed and the volunteers are to stamp areas on the image with appropriate landform types. The second task took a different approach and displayed wider field views from the older MOC camera on Mars Global Surveyor. The landforms on these wider views were then marked, and interesting features could be tagged for possible future hi-res imaging with HiRISE.

== New site ==
In November 2009 it was announced that NASA has developed a new website to allow volunteer users to help in Martian mapping. The site &quot;Be a Martian&quot; went live on November 17, 2009, and allows users to either map features or count craters on Mars. As of March 2020, the &quot;Be a Martian&quot; website appears to be defunct.

<text>Arlöv () is the seat of Burlöv Municipality, Skåne County, Sweden. It is statistically not defined as a locality of its own, but forms part of the contiguous city of Malmö, 5 km northeast of downtown Malmö. Out of Malmö&#x27;s 344,000 inhabitants, 11,000 live in Arlöv. However, in the 1950s, a public vote took place, deciding once and for all that Burlöv Municipality would never be a part of Malmö.

== Overview ==
Arlöv is known for its sugar industry, &quot;Sockerbolaget AB&quot; (owned by the Danish company Danisco). The town was also the home of the &quot;AB Svenska Järnvägsverkstäderna&quot; (&quot;Swedish Railway Works&quot;) or ASJ, who in the 1970s also built several automobiles for SAAB, notably the Saab Sonett II and III. 

== Buildings ==

Arlöv Church dates from 1900 and is Neo-Gothic in style; it was built to accommodate the growing congregation. The former office building of Danisco Sugar was bought in 2008 by the Church of Scientology who opened their new church, a so-called &quot;&quot;Ideal org&quot; there in 2009.

== Sport ==
A motorcycle speedway venue known as the Arlövs Motorstadion existed in the 1930s, 1940s and early 1950s, it was the first speedway track in Malmö. It ran speedway around the football pitch near the Hamngatan road.

== Popular culture ==
Arlöv is mentioned in the song &quot;Hanna från Arlöv&quot;&quot; (&quot;Hanna from Arlöv&quot;) by the 1970s Swedish band Nationalteatern. 

== Notable people ==

Notable people from Arlöv include rock artist Kal P. Dal, footballer Pontus Jansson, and author Amanda Svensson.

<text>Speed Busters (known in North America as Speed Busters: American Highways) is a video game developed by Ubisoft&#x27;s Montreal studio for Microsoft Windows in 1998. It was released for the Dreamcast in 1999 as Speed Devils. This racing game features courses with hazards such as dinosaurs, rolling boulders, and UFOs set in exotic locales, including Louisiana, Louisiana Tornado, New York City, New York City Winter, Mexico, Nevada, Aspen Summer, Aspen Winter, Canada (supposedly northern Quebec), Canada Light Winter, Canada Heavy Winter, Montreal Industrial, Hollywood, and Hollywood Disaster. The console version&#x27;s career mode allows players to advance through the ranks of a fictional racing league. Colorful rivals challenge players to accomplish specific feats during races, placing bets using prize money earned from competitions. The money earned from gambling and performance is used to purchase cars, upgrade them, and maintain them. The game also supports up to five players on a single Dreamcast console.

In 2000, Sega released Speed Devils Online Racing, an updated version of the game for Dreamcast that added online play.

==Reception==

&quot;Speed Busters: American Highways&quot; and &quot;Speed Devils&quot; received favorable reviews, while the mobile version of the latter received mixed reviews, according to the review aggregation website GameRankings. &quot;GameRevolution&quot; reviewed the Dreamcast version, stating, &quot;At the finish line, Speed Devils is an above-average racer, but not much more.&quot; The reviewer noted that the game featured good graphics and appealing cars but suffered from poorly designed tracks, leaving players wondering how they managed to drive off a cliff without noticing it. The article also criticized the game&#x27;s two-player mode for being boring and drawn out. &quot;Edge&quot; rated the same console version seven out of ten, stating, &quot;While not outstanding in any particular regard, &quot;Speed Devils&quot; is good entertainment that should captivate anyone tired of realistic racers with its accessible and player-friendly arcade-like nature.&quot; Chris Charla of &quot;NextGen&quot; described the same console version as &quot;the best racing game you can find on Dreamcast today.&quot; In Japan, where the same console version was released on November 18, 1999, &quot;Famitsu&quot; awarded it a score of 29 out of 40.

Nick Smith of &quot;AllGame&quot; gave &quot;Speed Busters: American Highways&quot; three-and-a-half stars out of five, stating, &quot;You&#x27;ll have a fast and furious time with &quot;SpeedBusters&quot; —but only if you have a competent graphics card. If you&#x27;ve got a puny PC with little video memory, forget it.&quot; However, Jonathan Sutyak rated &quot;Speed Devils&quot; two-and-a-half stars out of five, commenting, &quot;If you can overlook the obstacles, or even enjoy them, you may get a kick out of some of the races. Although the ability to run tracks in the opposite direction with some different obstacles is a plus, &quot;Speed Devils&quot; becomes repetitive due to the long laps of each track and the weak computer opponents. They may try to block you when you attempt to pass and will also ram into you, but ultimately, they do not provide an exceptional challenge.&quot;

<text>The Dikhil Region (, , ) is a region in southern Djibouti. It is bordered by the Regions of Tadjoura to the north, Arta to the northeast, Ali Sabieh to the east. To the west and south, it has a long line with the Djibouti-Ethiopia border adjacent to the Ethiopia Regions of Afar Region and Somali Region. Dikhil Region is the largest Region in Djibouti by area, with a mainland area of 7,200 square kilometres (2,800 sq mi), it is about the same size as Sikkim. The Dikhil Region&#x27;s capital is the town of Dikhil.

==History==

During the Middle Ages, the Dikhil Region was ruled by the Ifat Sultanate and the Adal Sultanate. It later formed a part of the French Somaliland protectorate in the first half of the 20th century. While the region is built in &quot;administrative position Gobad Dikkil&quot; from March 25, 1927, it is only December 21, 1927 a detachment from Djibouti to recognize the region &quot;and Dekkel Gobad&quot; led by the Arthur Diderrich administrator. Following this mission, a military and administrative is installed at a place called Dikhil March 26, 1928. Become attached to a post &quot;circle of Adaels&quot; December 24, 1930, the sub-prefecture becomes a vicious self-April 9, 1931. It then includes all the southern colony, the Ethiopian border that French Somaliland.
January 19, 1939 has created a &quot;circle of Ali Sabieh&quot; on the eastern part of the Dikhil. After several changes, this part definitely gets a separate entity in 1958 with the appointment of a specific administrator. Dikhil region takes the appearance it retains until the creation of the Arta region in 2002. On Asa Ragid site, the material found consists of shell middens from oysters, basalt rhyolite peaks whose dating for older, is at 5000–5800 years BC Also circular stone structures and a microlithic industry red jasper and obsidian and pottery shards more or less decorated beads and ostrich egg shell. As for the site of Asa Koma (Red Hill) As near Eyla, he revealed a life towards the end of the third millennium with a population of fishermen who hunted jackal, raised cattle and made pottery decorated with prints and chiseled features of good quality and which shapes and colors are similar to ceramics found in Sudan. It was discovered in 1989 a burial of an elderly adult and a young woman of 18. Many lithic obsidian and bone tools and beads of ostrich egg shells or shells of the Red Sea. Also animal bones, especially jackals, hippos rarely or gazelles, antelopes and domestic cattle and bones of fish (tilapia and catfish). Spread throughout the country and in more recent times are the cairn housing Graves (hundreds in the north). In one of these mounds in Balho, we found a fragment of cranium from the early first millennium BC The diversity of these burials attests different periods to which they relate. In 1963 during the first Somali-Ethiopian war a terrible massacre was perpetrated by the Ethiopian soldiers in Aysha, mainly populated by the Issa Somali. Among the latter, those who succeeded in fleeing arrived at Dikhil and Ali Sabieh and in 1977 during the Ogaden War between Somalia and Ethiopia, a second wave of populations fleeing hostilities took refuge in Dikhil and Ali Sabieh.

==Geography==

Dikhil Region is in the west part of the Republic of Djibouti, the Region of Dikhil is the largest Region in the country, it accounts for 27.5% of the land of Djibouti. Dikhil Region is best known for its desert landscape. It is also known for its climate, which presents exceptionally hot summers and mild winters. 
The Region is made up of three geologic regions: Mountains, Plains-Valleys, and Desert which occur in large bands from west to east. Because of the different geologic regions there are contrasting climates and ecosystems. The precipitation and temperature in the mountainous areas depends on the elevation.

==Climate==
The Dikhil Region has two seasons, with a warm and dry climate, very low precipitation (not exceeding 200 mm annually) and variable and it depending on the year.

=== Northern Dikhil Region ===
Monthly normal high and low temperatures (°F) for various Northern Dikhil Region cities

During fall, winter, and spring, it experiences the most clear days statewide. The wettest months in this region occur during the summer. Winds are strengthened as they are forced to push through canyons and valleys.

=== Southern Dikhil Region ===

Monthly normal high and low temperatures (°F) for Southern Dikhil Region cities

The wettest months are the summer inland, where it is drier, ranches dominate the landscape, characterized by thick spiny brush and grasslands. Winter nights commonly see temperatures fall below 25 °C (77 °F)

==Overview==
The Region of Dikhil is situated at the boundary of the Afar 44% and Issa Somali 56% sociolinguistic groups. In some part, it includes the territory of the former Sultanate of Gobaad, originally populated by populations of Afar. According to the 2009 Census, the local population consists of 88,948 individuals, 28,876 of whom are nomads.

<text>The Gloucestershire Warwickshire Steam Railway (GWR, GWSR or Gloucs-Warks Steam Railway) is a volunteer-run heritage railway which runs along the Gloucestershire/Worcestershire border of the Cotswolds in England.

The GWSR has restored and reopened around of track, operating between and . The most recent extension to Broadway (completed in 2018) involved the company raising £1.38 million. The 28-mile return trip on steam and heritage diesel trains follows part of the route of the former Great Western main line from Birmingham to Cheltenham. There is a long-term aim of extending a further from Broadway to the national rail network at .

==Overview==
The line was originally part of the Great Western Railway&#x27;s Cheltenham–Stratford-upon-Avon–Birmingham line, known as the Honeybourne Line, built in 1900–1906, and runs through the Cotswold towns of Winchcombe and Bishop&#x27;s Cleeve. The line was run down over the years and finally closed after a derailment damaged a stretch of track in 1976, with the double track being lifted from 1979.

The preservation group rehabilitated the line, starting steam train operations at Toddington in 1984 over of re-laid track. In 1987, the line was restored as far as Winchcombe, where the station was reconstructed using the former Monmouth Troy station building. The railway continued to re-lay track west of Winchcombe, through the long Greet Tunnel, and past the villages of Gretton, Gotherington and Bishops Cleeve. The line to was re-opened by Princess Anne in 2003. The latest extension of the line, to Broadway, opened in March 2018.

The GWSR runs trains from March to the end of December, with the line closing during January and February as well as November for line and locomotive maintenance. The GWSR runs regular train services every weekend, plus most weekdays from Easter to the end of October, and some weekends are used to host special events including steam and diesel galas, Wartime in the Cotswolds, Real Ale Weekends and Santa Specials.

The railway operates a wide variety of both steam and heritage diesel locomotives, as well as heritage DMUs. Notably, the famous locomotives 4472 &quot;Flying Scotsman&quot; and 3440 &quot;City of Truro&quot; have also run services on this railway. In 2021, the resident steam locomotives on the line were 7820 &quot;Dinmore Manor&quot;, 28xx class 2807 (undergoing 10-year overhaul), 42xx class 4270, 7903 &quot;Foremarke Hall&quot; and 35006 &quot;Peninsular &amp; Oriental SN Co&quot;. To complement the running stock, a collection of over 210 carriages and wagons of various origins has been compiled, many of which are still being restored.

The GWSR opened its extension to Broadway, Worcestershire to the public on 30 March 2018.

In December 2021 the railway returned to running a standard timetable after the removal of Coronavirus restrictions.

==Signalling of the Heritage GWSR==
The route consists of single line sections with passing places at the major stations. All stations and loops are signalled using GWR lower quadrant semaphore signals.

The signalling on the line is a mixture of Electric Key Token (EKT) and One Train Staff working, depending on operational requirements. Current sections are:
* Broadway–Toddington (One Train Staff) - will be Track-circuit block (TCB) when Broadway box opens
* Toddington–Winchcombe (EKT)
* Winchcombe-Gotherington (EKT)
* Gotherington-Cheltenham Race Course (EKT)
* Winchcombe–Cheltenham Race Course (EKT) (With Gotherington switched out)
* Toddington–Cheltenham Race Course (One Train Staff - with Winchcombe and Gotherington switched out and Cheltenham Race Course behaving as a ground frame)

There are four signal boxes along the line, and a new-built platform-mounted one at Broadway, with the frame parts all acquired and assembled:
* Broadway – currently non-operational
* Toddington – operational
* Winchcombe – operational
* Gotherington – operational
* Cheltenham Race Course – operational

==Stations==





== Future development plans ==

=== South to Cheltenham ===
Encouraged by support from Cheltenham Borough Council, which has both given the railway direct funds and placed protected status on the former line&#x27;s trackbed south from Cheltenham Race Course to Cheltenham Spa, the railway could at some point connect to Network Rail in the south.

The Council has backed the long-term scheme, as this would allow the railway to:
* be reinstated as an access point for race-goers from all over the UK to reach meetings at Cheltenham Racecourse, thus reduce current traffic congestion
* build a new halt in the Wyman&#x27;s Brook area of Cheltenham itself, to serve an adjacent Prince of Wales sports stadium
* run tourist and excursion trains to access the railway and the town.

Although the GWSR has extended track to (and through) Hunting Butts tunnel, a few hundred yards beyond Cheltenham Race Course station, it owns the trackbed as far as the Prince of Wales stadium at Wyman&#x27;s Brook. It is likely that after completion of its extension to Broadway, laying track further into Cheltenham will happen to this point; a distance of about 1 mile. However, beyond here major and costly engineering works would be required to extend the trackbed further south.

The primary impediments are firstly a bowstring bridge over Honeybourne Way (at ), built in 2002 to allow continued access by bicycle along the old trackbed alignment to Cheltenham Leisure Centre when planning permission was given for the redevelopment of the former station site as a Waitrose supermarket; the bridge spans a gap in the former railway embankment which was created to provide road access to the supermarket. Secondly, a reduced-height pedestrian specification bridge carrying the footpath/railbed beneath the busy St Georges Road, which would have to be replaced to allow trains to pass beneath the road. There is space alongside the bowstring bridge for the railway, but there is no way to avoid the work necessary to get railway vehicles beneath St Georges Road.

An alternative connection to Network Rail close to Swindon Village was also discussed in 2018 in conjunction with developing Cheltenham Race Course station into a National Rail parkway railway station, although the proposal was not acknowledged in the subsequent Gloucestershire Local Transport Plan covering 2020–2041. The 2020 Gloucestershire Rail Strategy does advocate further assessment is made of a new Gloucestershire Parkway station but suggests a site on the existing Birmingham and Gloucester Railway close to M5 junction 11 would have the greatest benefit.

===Between Broadway and Honeybourne===
GWSR (Gloucestershire Warwickshire Railway) could buy the trackbed between Broadway and Honeybourne to protect it from future non-GWSR developments. The trackbed is 4.5 miles long, the bridges have not been removed or filled, and there are no plans to fill or remove them. However, they are in a very poor state and would cost a significant amount to restore; additionally, the DfT has indicated that it would not grant permission for the GWSR to purchase the trackbed and to take on liability for the bridges.

===North from Honeybourne===
When the GWSR was first formed, it intended to purchase the entire line from Cheltenham Racecourse to Stratford Racecourse. However, when applying for the required Light Railway Order, the group were informed that they were unlikely to be granted the order for 25 miles when they had no experience of running a railway. A reduced application for the 15 miles from Cheltenham Race Course to Broadway was successful and track has since been laid and operations begun. Since this time, the section between Stratford and Stratford Racecourse has been utilised to improve road access around the town, especially the A4390, making reinstatement of rail to the main station at Stratford extremely difficult.

==Landslips==
In the early 2010s the GWSR was affected by two major landslips in embankments on the line, which severed the preserved line into separate sections; however, both slips have now been repaired, and the whole line has been fully reopened. A further landslip occurred in November 2019 just south of Gotherington station, and again was repaired.

===2010 (Gotherington)===
In April 2010 the GWSR suffered a landslip of an embankment near Gotherington. Train services continued despite the Gotherington landslip, but over a reduced route. The landslip forced the closure of the line south of Gotherington, including Cheltenham Race Course Station, which was effectively cut off. The railway continued to operate services from Toddington to Gotherington, with a locomotive at both ends of the train (&quot;top and tailed&quot;), as it was not possible to run the locomotive around the train at Gotherington at the time (there is now a run round loop just south of Gotherington). The railway launched a £1m appeal, both to fund the rebuilding of the embankment, and also to undertake preventative maintenance to ensure that similar problems do not happen at other points along the line. It was deemed unlikely that the line south of Gotherington would reopen before July 2011, but donations ensured that the work could be carried out promptly, and it was reopened on 22 April 2011.

===2011 (Chicken Curve)===
In January 2011 the railway was damaged by another landslip just east of Winchcombe station at Chicken Curve. The landslip severed the railway in two; it was very similar to the one at Gotherington, but closer to the middle of the route. It was estimated that the cost of the repair work would be £850,000; funds for the repair were successfully raised. During the repair period a DMU service was run from Toddington up to the extension at Laverton; since the earlier Gotherington slip had been repaired, steam trains ran from Winchcombe to Cheltenham Race Course, the steam locomotive maintenance facilities temporarily being transferred to Winchcombe. The Chicken Curve landslip was repaired over the summer of 2012, and the GWSR was once again operational as a single unified line from Cheltenham Race Course to the site of Laverton Halt, a total of 12 route miles in length at that time.

===2019 (Gotherington)===
Following extended heavy rain, one side of the embankment south of Gotherington station slipped. This was first discovered in November 2019, and worsened to the extent that no trains could run in January 2020. Following remedial works, the line reopened on 7 March 2020, in time for the regular Cheltenham race trains to run. Work is still ongoing to finish off the site. The total cost of repairs is expected to be £500,000; an emergency appeal has been issued to raise £250,000 towards this cost due to the closure of the line following the coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak.

<text>Harry Alan Sinclair (born 1959) is a New Zealand film director, writer and actor. In his early career he was an actor and member of The Front Lawn, a musical theatre duo. He went on to write and direct several short films, a TV series and three feature films. He is best known for his role as Isildur in the first scenes of Peter Jackson&#x27;s &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring&quot;.

==Early life==
Harry Sinclair was born in 1959 in Auckland, New Zealand. He is the son of historian Keith Sinclair and brother of writer Stephen Sinclair.

Sinclair studied acting at the Ecole Philippe Gaulier in Paris, and went on to a career on the stage in Auckland, as well as roles in a number of New Zealand films including working with Peter Jackson, playing the role of Roger in &quot;Braindead&quot; and Isildur in &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;.

==Career==

===The Front Lawn===
In 1985 he co-founded The Front Lawn (with Don McGlashan), a multi-media comedy music duo. Sinclair and The Front Lawn toured internationally with a series of live shows including: &quot;Songs and Stories from The Front Lawn&quot;, &quot;The Reason for Breakfast&quot;, &quot;The Washing Machine&quot;, and &quot;The Story of Robert&quot;. They also completed two music albums, &quot;Songs from The Front Lawn&quot; and &quot;More Songs from The Front Lawn&quot;. They performed twice at the Edinburgh Festival, in 1988 and 1989, winning The Independent newspaper&#x27;s theatre award for the festival in 1988, and in both years winning inclusion in the &quot;Pick of the Fringe&quot; season at London&#x27;s Donmar Warehouse.

The Front Lawn also toured extensively in Europe, America, Australia and New Zealand.

Sinclair and McGlashan made several short films: &quot;The Lounge Bar&quot; (which was featured in the First Annual International Festival of Short Films in the U.S. as one of the &quot;world&#x27;s best live-action shorts&quot;), &quot;Walk Short&quot; and &quot;Linda’s Body&quot; (which won Best Short Film at the New Zealand Film Awards).

===Films===

After The Front Lawn disbanded in 1990, Sinclair directed two short films, &quot;Casual Sex&quot;, and &quot;Avenue Du Maine&quot;.

Sinclair&#x27;s first feature film &quot;Topless Women Talk About Their Lives&quot; (1997), starring Danielle Cormack and Joel Tobeck, was released theatrically in 23 countries and won nine awards at the New Zealand Film Awards including Best Director and Best Film. It was a spin-off from his TV series of the same name, which was shown on TV3 in New Zealand and on SBS in Australia. Each of the 41 episodes was only 4 minutes long, and featured a different song from Flying Nun Records.

His second feature, &quot;The Price of Milk&quot; (2000), starring Danielle Cormack and Karl Urban, was his only film to be released in the US, by Lot 47 Films. It won the Grand Prize at the Puchon International Fantastic Film Festival (2001) and the Grand Prize at the Tokyo International Fantastic Film Festival (2001).

His third feature was &quot;Toy Love&quot; (2002) starring Dean O&#x27;Gorman and Kate Elliott.

His three feature films were made in an unconventional manner, with Sinclair casting his lead actors before writing the scripts. The stories were developed during video workshops with the actors, and the final scripts written during the shoots, allowing the stories to develop organically, building on what naturally developed between the actors.

===Television===
In 2009 and 2010, he was a regular director of the TV series &quot;90210&quot;.

===The Builders Association===
From 2006 to 2008 Sinclair collaborated with the New York-based theatre company Builders Association, touring internationally as an actor in their production &quot;Super Vision&quot;. He co-wrote their next production, &quot;Continuous City&quot;, which premiered in November 2008 at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, and toured through 2010. He also played a lead role in &quot;Continuous City&quot;, appearing only in projected film sequences.

===Kiri and Lou===
Sinclair is currently writing and directing an animated children&#x27;s series, &quot;Kiri and Lou&quot;, for Television New Zealand and the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. He is collaborating with animation director Ant Elworthy and composer Don McGlashan, and the series is produced by Fiona Copland.

==Personal life==
Sinclair lives in Los Angeles.

<text>Ali Sabieh Region (, ) is a region in southern Djibouti. With a mainland area of 2,400 square kilometres (900 sq mi), it lies along the national border with Somaliland and Ethiopia, bordering also the Dikhil Region to the west and the Arta Region to the north. Its capital is Ali Sabieh. The Arrei Mountains are the highest point in the region.

==History==

Nomadic life in the Ali Sabieh Region dates back at least 2,000 years. During the Middle Ages, the Ali Sabieh Region was ruled by the Ifat Sultanate and the Adal Sultanate. It later formed a part of the French Somaliland protectorate in the first half of the 20th century. Considered the border with Ethiopia, the area had few permanent settlements at the turn of the 20th century. In 1904, a report notes that &quot;when the border post of Ali Sabieh, it has the appearance of a fortress. Attached to the circle of &quot;Gobad-Dikkil&quot; from its inception in 1931, Ali Sabieh became the chief town of a circle autonomously 1939. It was briefly attached to the circle of Djibouti between 1946 and 1949. It is managed by the commander of the circle Dikhil between 1952 and 1958, before finally receive its own administration.

==Overview==

The region borders Arta Region to the north, the Dikhil Region to the west, and the nation of Somaliland to the east, and the nation of Ethiopia to the south. Largely arid, the Ali Sabieh Region is noted for its bare plains of Grand Bara and its large Mountains. The Ali Sabieh region has old forts all round the region build by the French Army in the 20th century. The inhabitants of the Ali Sabieh region belong mainly to the people of Issa Somali clan. In 1963 during the first Somali-Ethiopian war a terrible massacre was perpetrated by the Ethiopian soldiers in Aysha, mainly populated by Issa Somali. Among the latter, those who succeeded in fleeing arrived at Dikhil and Ali-Sabieh. At Ali-Sabieh, the colonial administration installed them in a new area. In 1977: during the Ogaden War between Somalia and Ethiopia, a second wave of populations fleeing hostilities took refuge in Ali Sabieh. In 1984, A severe drought that struck the Aysha and Hadagalah regions and decimated thousands of people and hundreds of thousands of sheep and cattle caused a human flood, particularly towards Ali Sabieh. In 1991 during the Somali Civil War a fourth wave of populations came to take refuge in Ali Sabieh and also in Ali Adde and Holhol. The local commercial sector is centered on construction (cement) and storage of goods in transit to Ethiopia. Towns in the region have experienced significant growth with the increasing industrialization. The area has also seen some investment.

==Geography==
Ali Sabieh is the fourth largest Region in the country. It contains around 16.5% of the nation&#x27;s landmass. In total area, it is larger than Mauritius and smaller than Samoa. The Arta lies to the north, and Dikhil to the west. Ali Sabieh Region also shares a border with the Somali Region of Ethiopia to the south, and the Awdal region of Somaliland to the east. Ali Sabieh&#x27;s highest point is Arrei, which has an elevation of 4,268 ft (1,301 m). Other mountain ranges in the Region include the Boura Mountains, the Arrei Mountains, the Rahle Godle, and the Dagouein Mountain. Ali Sabieh Region has an extraordinarily diverse geography. The western half of the region is part of the coastal plain and has an exceedingly hot, humid and arid climate. The eastern half, however, is very mountainous, with the major peak being 1,301 m (4,268 ft) Arrei Mountain, near Guelile. These mountains trap the moisture created by an upper-level wind reversal between May and October, so that in the eastern half of the region annual rainfall increases from 150 millimetres in the foothills to probably more than 270 millimetres. The main wadis that cross are the wadis Dey Dey, Holl-Holl, Beye-Adey, Danan and Guestir. The Region of Ali Sabieh has 52 mountain summits with 3,000 feet (914 m) of prominence.

==Economy==

Activities oriented towards animal production (goat and dromedary farming) and agriculture in irrigated perimeters characterize the economy of the region. There is also the practice of small business and other informal activities. The proximity of the Ethiopian border, the railway activities linking Djibouti to Ethiopia, the storage of goods in transit to Ethiopia and the use of building materials (Ali Sabieh Cement) have made the city of Ali Sabieh a place for exchanges of cross flows. Its prospects for development are characterized by cross-border commercial dynamics and a process of industrialization. The entire region has been significantly affected by caravan activities to and from Ethiopia. The capital city concentrates almost all of the factors driving the economy. This is where all civil servants and other agents work in the decentralized departments of ministries, in public institutions. Most of the small business units (shops, grocery stores, taxis and internetcafes) are located in the city of Ali Sabieh.

<doc id="920765" wikidata="Q665327" url="?curid=920765" title="Stat (system call)">
<text> is a Unix system call that returns file attributes about an inode. The semantics of vary between operating systems. As an example, Unix command uses this system call to retrieve information on files that includes:
* atime: time of last access ()
* mtime: time of last modification ()
* ctime: time of last status change ()

codice_1 appeared in Version 1 Unix. It is among the few original Unix system calls to change, with Version 4&#x27;s addition of group permissions and larger file size. The similarly named command-line tool codice_1 has been available for Linux since at least 2004.

==stat() functions==
The C POSIX library header , found on POSIX and other Unix-like operating systems, declares the codice_3 functions, as well as related functions called codice_4 and codice_5. The functions take a pointer to a codice_6 buffer argument, which is used to return the file attributes. On success, the functions return zero, and on error, −1 is returned and errno is set appropriately.

The codice_3 and codice_5 functions take a filename argument. If the file is a symbolic link, codice_3 returns attributes of the eventual target of the link, while codice_5 returns attributes of the link itself. The codice_4 function takes a file descriptor argument instead, and returns attributes of the file that it identifies.

The family of functions was extended to implement large file support. Functions named codice_12, codice_13 and codice_14 return attributes in a codice_15 structure, which represents file sizes with a 64-bit type, allowing the functions to work on files 2 GiB and larger (up to 8 EiB). When the codice_16 macro is defined to 64, these 64-bit functions are available under the original names.

The functions are defined as:
int stat(const char *filename, struct stat *buf);
int lstat(const char *filename, struct stat *buf);
int fstat(int filedesc, struct stat *buf);
==stat structure==
This structure is defined in header file as follows, although implementations are free to define additional fields:
struct stat {
 mode_t st_mode;
 ino_t st_ino;
 dev_t st_dev;
 dev_t st_rdev;
 nlink_t st_nlink;
 uid_t st_uid;
 gid_t st_gid;
 off_t st_size;
 struct timespec st_atim;
 struct timespec st_mtim;
 struct timespec st_ctim;
 blksize_t st_blksize;
 blkcnt_t st_blocks;


POSIX.1 does not require codice_17, codice_18 and codice_19 members; these fields are defined as part of XSI option in the Single Unix Specification.

In older versions of POSIX.1 standard, the time-related fields were defined as codice_20, codice_21 and codice_22, and were of type codice_23. Since the 2008 version of the standard, these fields were renamed to codice_24, codice_25 and codice_26, respectively, of type struct codice_27, since this structure provides a higher resolution time unit. For the sake of compatibility, implementations can define the old names in terms of the codice_28 member of codice_29. For example, codice_20 can be defined as codice_31.

The codice_6 structure includes at least the following members:
* codice_33 identifier of device containing file
* codice_34 inode number
* codice_35 protection mode; see also Unix permissions
* codice_36 reference count of hard links
* codice_37 user identifier of owner
* codice_38 group identifier of owner
* codice_17 device identifier (if special file)
* codice_40 total file size, in bytes
* codice_20 time of last access
* codice_21 time of last modification
* codice_22 time of last status change
* codice_19 preferred block size for file system I/O, which can depend upon both the system and the type of file system
* codice_18 number of blocks allocated in multiples of codice_46 (usually 512 bytes).
The codice_35 field is a bit field. It combines the file access modes and also indicates any special file type. There are many macros to work with the different mode flags and file types.

== Criticism of atime ==

Reading a file changes its eventually requiring a disk &quot;write,&quot; which has been criticized as it is inconsistent with a read only file system. File system cache may significantly reduce this activity to one disk write per cache flush.

Linux kernel developer Ingo Molnár publicly criticized the concept and performance impact of atime in 2007, and in 2009, the mount option had become the default, which addresses this criticism. The behavior behind the mount option offers sufficient performance for most purposes and should not break any significant applications, as it has been extensively discussed. Initially, only updated atime if atime &lt; mtime or atime &lt; ctime; that was subsequently modified to update atimes that were 24 hours old or older, so that and Debian&#x27;s popularity counter (popcon) would behave properly.

Current versions of the Linux kernel support four mount options, which can be specified in fstab:
* (formerly , and formerly the default; as of 2.6.30) always update atime, which conforms to the behavior defined by POSIX
* (&quot;relative atime&quot;, introduced in 2.6.20 and the default as of 2.6.30) only update atime under certain circumstances: if the previous atime is older than the mtime or ctime, or the previous atime is over 24 hours in the past
* never update atime of directories, but do update atime of other files
* never update atime of any file or directory; implies ; highest performance, but least compatible
* update atime according to specific circumstances laid out below

Current versions of Linux, macOS, Solaris, FreeBSD, and NetBSD support a mount option in /etc/fstab, which causes the atime field never to be updated. Turning off atime updating breaks POSIX compliance, and some applications, such as mbox-driven &quot;new mail&quot; notifications, and some file usage watching utilities, notably tmpwatch.

The option on OpenBSD behaves more like Linux .

Version 4.0 of the Linux kernel mainline, which was released on April 12, 2015, introduced the new mount option . It allows POSIX-style atime updates to be performed in-memory and flushed to disk together with some non-time-related I/O operations on the same file; atime updates are also flushed to disk when some of the sync system calls are executed, or before the file&#x27;s in-memory inode is evicted from the filesystem cache. Additionally, it is possible to configure for how long atime modifications can remain unflushed. That way, lazytime retains POSIX compatibility while offering performance improvements.

== ctime ==
It is tempting to believe that originally meant creation time; however, while early Unix did have modification and creation times, the latter was changed to be access time before there was any C structure in which to call anything . The file systems retained just the access time () and modification time () through 6th edition Unix. The timestamp was added in the file system restructuring that occurred with Version 7 Unix, and has always referred to inode change time. It is updated any time file metadata stored in the inode changes, such as file permissions, file ownership, and creation and deletion of hard links. POSIX also mandates (last status change) update with nonzero  (file modification). In some implementations, is affected by renaming a file, despite filenames not being stored in inodes: Both original Unix, which implemented a renaming by making a link (updating ) and then unlinking the old name (updating again) and modern Linux tend to do this.

Unlike and , cannot be set to an arbitrary value with , as used by the utility, for example. Instead, when is used, or for any other change to the inode other than an update to caused by
accessing the file, the value is set to the current time.

== Time granularity ==
* provides times accurate to one second.
* Some filesystems provide finer granularity. Solaris 2.1 introduced a microsecond resolution with UFS in 1992 and a nanosecond resolution with ZFS.
* In Linux kernels 2.5.48 and above, the stat structure supports nanosecond resolution for the three file timestamp fields. These are exposed as additional fields in the stat structure.
* The resolution of create time on FAT filesystem is 10 milliseconds, while resolution of its write time is two seconds, and access time has a resolution of one day thus it acts as the access date.

== Example ==
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
#include &lt;time.h&gt;

#include &lt;sys/types.h&gt;

<doc id="920767" wikidata="Q842474" url="?curid=920767" title="Death Crimson OX">
<text>is a light gun shooting game developed by Ecole Software. It was released in arcades in 2000 then ported to the Dreamcast console in 2001 (published by Sammy Entertainment), several months after Sega had dropped support for the console. It is the third and final game in the &quot;Death Crimson&quot; series, and the only one to be released outside Japan. The game was also released as Guncom 2 in Europe and in Japan on the PlayStation 2.

== Gameplay ==
The game can be played with either a standard controller or a light gun.

== Development ==

&quot;Death Crimson OX&quot; was developed by Ecole Software.

== Reception ==
The Dreamcast version received &quot;generally unfavourable reviews&quot; according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. &quot;GameSpot&quot; described it as a second-rate &quot;House of the Dead&quot; clone. &quot;IGN&quot; cited a confusing storyline, poor visuals, and new gameplay mechanics which prevent the game from offering any sort of challenge. &quot;Game Informer&quot; said that it &quot;gives you plenty of targets, but no real reason to keep pulling the trigger.&quot; Eric Bratcher of &quot;NextGen&quot; called it &quot;A typical gun game with typical gun game problems: It&#x27;s too short, too redundant, and too similar to everything else out there. Only the NRA would lobby for this one.&quot; In Japan, &quot;Famitsu&quot; gave it a score of 25 out of 40.

Also in Japan, &quot;Game Machine&quot; listed the arcade version in their 1 January 2001 issue as the thirteenth most-popular dedicated arcade game of the year 2000.

==Series==
The first game in the series, &quot;Death Crimson&quot;, was released in 1996 for the Sega Saturn. A sequel, &quot;Death Crimson 2: Meranito no Saidan&quot;, was released in 1999 for the Dreamcast. Both games were exclusive to Japan. &quot;Death Crimson 2&quot; received an English fan translation patch in 2024.

<text>Jakobsberg is a suburban area (pop. ca 32 643 in the year 2022) within Stockholm urban area, and the seat of Järfälla Municipality, Stockholm County in Sweden. 

Jakobsberg, Järfälla&#x27;s commercial and administrative centre, grew up around the railway. In the 1940s, blocks of flats were built and the municipal council moved its offices here. Jakobsberg gradually became the centre of the municipality and now has a population of 24,046.

The Jakobsberg Centre includes shops, offices, car parks and apartments, as well as a modern library, an art gallery, an exhibition hall and a cinema.

There are a number of ancient monuments and buildings of historic interest in the area. Jakobsbergs Gård - a 17th-century manor-house - is now a community based centre that hosts a variety of events such as weddings, business meetings, parties etc., organized by public and private organizations and people. However, it is not located in the municipality of Jakobsberg, but rather in a southern suburb of Stockholm known as Bredäng, which is about 30 kilometers south of the location being discussed in this article. Säby Gård, from the 1650s, houses a Steiner Waldorf nursery school and a riding school. Görväln House on the shore of Lake Mälaren was built in the 1660s.

Jakobsberg also has one of the busiest stations on the Stockholm commuter rail network, situated on the Bålsta line.

<text>Märsta () is a suburb of Metropolitan Stockholm, a locality and the seat of Sigtuna Municipality, Stockholm County, Sweden with 27,034 inhabitants in 2015. The town is situated close to Stockholm&#x27;s main international airport, Arlanda. Even though its origins go back to around 500 AD, Märsta is a widespread modern residential area. Märsta has a mix of multi-storey dwellings and smaller houses. It is in a phase of expansion and new residential areas are built both in central parts of Märsta and in the surrounding areas like for instance Steningehöjden. Märsta can be reached by Stockholm commuter rail trains running at quarterly intervals during daytime and by bus from Stockholm Arlanda Airport. The central parts of Märsta has a shopping area &quot;Märsta Centrum&quot; with various shops, pub and restaurants. Another smaller shopping area is &quot;Valsta Centrum&quot;. East of the central parts of Märsta there is an industrial area and a bit further east close to the airport a shopping mall &quot;Eurostop&quot;. Most parts of Märsta and the municipality of Sigtuna can be reached with local bus services originating at the Märsta Railway Station and also connecting with commuter trains.

==Name==
The origin of the name &quot;Märsta&quot; goes back to around 500 AD. At that time most of the valleys in &quot;Märsta&quot; were still under water, which explains the name. &quot;Mär-&quot; is found in the Swedish word &quot;mjärde&quot; which is a fishing tool, and &quot;-sta&quot; means a place (area or somekind of habitat) like the Swedish word &quot;stad&quot; meaning city. Märsta means &quot;place to fish&quot; or &quot;fishing-place&quot;.

==Geography==
Märsta is situated north of &quot;Steningevik&quot;, which is a bay of the lake Mälaren. The center of the town is located in a valley called &quot;Märstadal&quot; and the area &quot;Sätuna&quot;, which also holds the train station of the town.

The rest of the town&#x27;s buildings spread upon and below the hills that form the valleys in Märsta. The stream that flows through the town out to Steningevik is called &quot;Märstaån&quot;. It is also located along the motorway E4 about 37 km north of central Stockholm, 33 km south of Uppsala and about 4 km from Arlanda Airport.

==Coat of arms==
The coat of arms of Märsta resulted from merging the seals of the two hundreds of Ärlinghundra and Seminghundra, which are today located in Märsta. The combined seal, showing a key and axe crossed in gold on a blood-red ground, is known to have been in use from 1568. The key was the symbol of Ärlinghundra and symbolised &quot;the key to heaven&#x27;s gates&quot;. The axe was the symbol of Seminghundra and symbolized the axe which killed Saint Olaf; Seminghundra was also known as an execution place for convicts during the Middle Ages.

Märsta existed as a municipality of its own between 1952 and 1970. The coat of arms was created in 1954 and became obsolete as municipal arms when Märsta was merged into Sigtuna Municipality in 1971.

==History==
The area has been populated since the Stone Age and due to the location of traditional Viking-land has rich archaeological remains from the Bronze Age, Iron Age and Viking Age. There are many runestones and older ruins of stone castles and walls in the Märsta area.

The area of today&#x27;s modern Märsta consisted of big farms and small communities, that were (and still are) typical for the landscape of the province Uppland.
Märsta was just one of these farms but due to the location and importance of travelling between Stockholm and Uppsala, the farm had to turn into an inn. The important travelling road can be traced back to the Viking Age and even older ages.

During the days of the Swedish Empire many of the old nobles became land owners in the area and built palaces like &quot;Steninge&quot;, &quot;Skånelaholm&quot;, &quot;Rosersberg&quot; and &quot;Venngarn&quot;.
Even Sweden&#x27;s oldest public school is located in &quot;Husby-Ärlinghundra&quot;, the parish of Märsta. It was built in 1697 and is today a museum.

The first telegraph pole in Sweden was placed in Märsta 1853 and the train station got built in the 1860s. It is currently the northern termini of the commuter railways in Stockholm, and a minor interchange to SJ. The name Märsta got along only because it was common for travellers even though they were placed on neighbouring farms.

The Märsta municipality was formed in 1952 due to a fusion of the parishes of &quot;Husby-Ärlinghundra&quot;, &quot;Norrsunda&quot;, &quot;Odensala&quot; and &quot;Skånela&quot;. In 1967 the parishes of &quot;Vidbo&quot;, &quot;Lunda&quot; and &quot;Skepptuna&quot; also merged into the municipality. In 1971 the cities of Sigtuna and Märsta were forged together and formed Sigtuna Municipality with Märsta as the seat of the ruling council.

In 1957 the Swedish government decided to build Stockholm&#x27;s new international airport, Stockholm Arlanda, at Halmsjön, east of Märsta. In its decision the government mentioned the building of a town where the employees at the new airport could live. The town was located IN Märsta. A plan for the residential area was made in 1960 and during the 1960s the population of Märsta quadrupled. A large part of the buildings in Märsta was built in the 1960s. Expansion of Märsta to the east is restricted due to the 55 dB(A) noise area restrictions in force. There are not many older houses in the central parts of Märsta but south of Märsta, Steninge Castle is located, with an environment dating back to 1690. Steninge Castle is a popular tourist attraction.

==Culture and education==
There is a private cinema, &quot;Biokällan i Forum&quot; in Märsta.

There is a public theatre facility, Sigtuna Municipal Theatre, &quot;Kulturum&quot; which is Märstas venue for theater, concerts and conferences. The theater was completed in autumn 1980 and was inaugurated in November of that year. The salon has 454 seats. Local productions, performances and conferences are held at &quot;Kulturum&quot;. The theater is used for many different purposes, such as local productions, performances, arts school concerts, conferences and more. Once a month the City Council uses the Sigtuna Municipal Theatre as meeting room. Kulturum is in the same building as Märstas gymnasium, (Arlandagymnasiet).

Like many similar sized Swedish towns and central communities Märsta has pre school and pedagogical care facilities available to its citizens and also high schools and a gymnasium, (Arlandagymnasiet). Märsta also has a school for adult education. There is a public library in the town centre, (Märsta Centrum).

==Business and employment==
There are some local businesses in Märsta and also two major factories producing paint, Beckers Industrial Coatings AB, producing industrial paint, and Becker Acroma, now part of Sherwin-Williams. There are also some transport and spedition companies in the area. But most employment opportunities for people living in Märsta are at Stockholm Arlanda Airport and in Stockholm City.

<text>Åkersberga is a locality and the seat of Österåker Municipality, Stockholm County, Sweden with 28,033 inhabitants in 2010.

== History ==
In 1901 a railway station named &quot;Berga&quot; was opened on this rural spot some 30 km from Stockholm. Some shops and a post office followed. The name Berga was changed to &quot;Åkers Berga&quot; to avoid confusion with other places in Sweden named Berga, and the present name evolved from this. After World War II the village grew and blocks of flats were built. Åkersberga gradually evolved into a suburb with many of its inhabitants commuting to work-places in Stockholm, and has become more urban in character.

Between 1974 and 1982 Åkersberga was the seat of Vaxholm Municipality. When the municipality was split in 1983, Åkersberga became the seat of the reinstituted Österåker Municipality.

Notable people from Åkersberga include Loreen, Jesper Parnevik, Alexander Östlund and Richard S. Johnson. The punk rock band Coca Carola is from Åkersberga, as are the bands Lustans Lakejer and Eskobar, of which the former have released an album named &quot;Åkersberga&quot;.

Åkersberga is served by the narrow-gauge urban railway Roslagsbanan, which has four stops in the town, Österskär, Tunagård, Åkersberga Station and Åkers Runö.

<doc id="920782" wikidata="Q59052" url="?curid=920782" title="Skutskär">
<text>Skutskär is a bimunicipal locality and the seat of Älvkarleby Municipality in Uppsala County, Sweden with 6,075 inhabitants in 2010. According to the census of 2000 6,003 people lived in Skutskär, most of them in Älvkarleby Municipality, but a minor part in Gävle Municipality in Gävleborg County.

==History==
Originally Skutskär was the area south and south-east from the industries located there. The first record of Skutskär (Ship Reef) is done 1741 and describes an anchoring point for the industries of Harnäs. The industries in question are iron smelting furnaces in Harnäs (shut down in the 1910s) and later the saw mill and wood pulp mill Skutskärsverken owned by Stora Enso which is still one of the largest in the world. This mill and its subcontractors remains by far the largest employer in Skutskär and the surrounding area. Skutskär back then had a large percentage of laborers and their families, which led to the building of all the facilities needed in a small town, including schools, shops, a fire brigade, ambulance and police. Even a public bath (shut down and demolished in the 1970s) and other facilities that must have been a luxury for the working class was built, often with support from the pulp mill.

The other half of what is now Skutskär is still called Upplandsbodarna or just Bodarna, especially by the older generations. It is located further south, along the Boda river, which is a small branch of the Dalälven river, before they both flow into the sea. The population consisted mainly of farmers and fishermen. This village was present a long time before the industries of Skutskär and associated to the Älvkarleby population. Skutskär and Bodarna was not physically the same town until the 1930s, when the new housing district of Kyrkbyn was built. By then the combination of the two urban areas was known simply as Skutskär.

Skutskär now remains a stable community population-wise due to the wood pulp mill, the saw mill (that is now run by other ventures after Stora shut down its saw mill operations in Skutskär), and the vicinity to Gävle but the municipality is struggling with its financial situation due to political decisions in the 1980s and 90s, mainly integration problems and failed building projects.

==Subdivision==
==Sports==
The following sports clubs are located in Skutskär:

*Skutskärs IF, bandy club, as of 2018 the Swedish champions among women
*Skutskärs IF FK, association football club
*Skutskärs OK - orienteering, orienteering club

<text>Mölnlycke is a small town nearby Greater Gothenburg, a locality and the seat of Härryda Municipality, Västra Götaland County, Sweden. It had 17,499 inhabitants in 2019. The urban area stretches over two municipalities. Mölndal Municipality is the second.

==History==

The first people to settle in the area that would later become Mölnlycke came there during the Stone Age. At this time there were five lakes, which today are formed into one single lake. The lake shore is one of the places where many ancient remains have been found. It is speculated that when people learned to farm, this population moved out of the region to an area better for farming. The next known human settlement was during the Middle Ages, and this is also when the first Råda Church was built. During the Middle Ages, the border with Denmark went through what is today Mölnlycke and therefore the area was much affected by war between Denmark and Sweden.

The first time the name Mölnlycke was mentioned that we know of was 1576. The name was originally made up of the two Old Swedish words “mölna” and “lycka”, literally meaning mill field. It probably came from a mill built at the location of today&#x27;s Mölnlycke Fabriker during the Middle Ages.

In 1849, Gustaf Ferdinand Hennig founded &quot;Mölnlycke Väfveri AB&quot;, a textile manufacturer, which has had a big impact on Mölnlycke. In addition to attracting many workers to the city, it also led to the building of the railway between Gothenburg and Borås, which today still has a stop in Mölnlycke. Today the company is called Mölnlycke Health Care.

== Geography ==

Mölnlycke is located at a height of 91 meters above sea level and is about 10 km from Gothenburg, the second largest city in Sweden. The short distance to Gothenburg is probably one of the factors of the quick expansion of the city that started during the 20th century, when many people started commuting between Mölnlycke and Gothenburg.

== Culture ==

Mölnlycke Kulturhus, located in the center of Mölnlycke, contains Mölnlycke library, a cinema and a café.

<text>Zoo Atlanta (sometimes referred as Atlanta Zoo) is an Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA) accredited zoo in Atlanta, Georgia. The current president and CEO of Zoo Atlanta is Raymond B. King.

==History==

Zoo Atlanta was founded in 1889, when businessman George V. Gress purchased a bankrupt traveling circus and donated the animals to the city of Atlanta. City leaders opted to house the collection in Grant Park, which remains the zoo&#x27;s present location. Original residents of the zoo included a black bear, a raccoon, a jaguar, a hyena, a gazelle, a Mexican hog, lionesses, monkeys, and camels. The zoo&#x27;s collection expanded in the 1930s with the personal donation of a private menagerie owned by Asa G. Candler, Jr.

The 1950s and 1960s were decades of renovation and construction at the zoo, but by the early 1970s, many of its exhibits and facilities were outdated and showing signs of disrepair. In 1970, a small group of concerned citizens founded the Atlanta Zoological Society in hopes of raising funds and awareness for the institution.

Following a period of decline in the mid-1980s, the zoo was privatized in 1985 with the creation of a nonprofit organization, Atlanta Fulton County Zoo Inc., and was renamed Zoo Atlanta that same year. A 20-year period of aggressive restoration followed, marked by several high-profile exhibit openings, including &quot;The Ford African Rain Forest&quot;, in the late 1980s and early 1990s. A pair of giant pandas, Lun Lun and Yang Yang, arrived at Zoo Atlanta in 1999 and made their debut at Zoo Atlanta in 1999.

==Habitats==

===African Savanna===
Zoo Atlanta&#x27;s African Savanna, opened in 2019 as part of the Zoo&#x27;s Grand New View transformation, houses wildlife native to the grasslands and desert of Africa, including African elephants, lions, giraffes, plains zebras, ostriches, warthogs, meerkats, white rhinos, kori bustards, and a bontebok.

===Scaly Slimy Spectacular: The Amphibian and Reptile Experience===

Opened in 2015, Scaly Slimy Spectacular: The Amphibian and Reptile Experience was the world&#x27;s first LEED Gold-certified amphibian and reptile complex. The complex, which replaced the Zoo&#x27;s former World of Reptiles, is home to more than 200 animals representing more than 70 species.

Notable reproductive successes include Arakan forest turtles, a critically endangered species harvested nearly to extinction for food and traditional medicine. A rare Guatemalan beaded lizard hatched at Zoo Atlanta in March 2012. A critically endangered bog turtle hatched at Zoo Atlanta in 2022 for the first time in 30 years.

===Arthur M. Blank Family Foundation Giant Panda Conservation Center===
From 1999 to 2024, Zoo Atlanta was one of the four institutions in the U.S. that housed giant pandas. The zoo&#x27;s pandas resided in the Zoo&#x27;s Arthur M. Blank Family Foundation Giant Panda Conservation Center.

Lun Lun (female) and Yang Yang (male) arrived in Atlanta as juveniles in 1999 and resided at the zoo on loan from China until 2024. The pair&#x27;s first cub, male Mei Lan, was born on September 6, 2006. A second cub, male Xi Lan, was born August 30, 2008. Female Po was born November 3, 2010. Po&#x27;s name was announced by actor Jack Black in 2011; Po was named after Black&#x27;s character in the DreamWorks films &quot;Kung Fu Panda&quot;. A fourth and a fifth cub, both female, born July 15, 2013, were the first twin pandas to be born in the U.S. since 1987. Their names were announced on ABC&#x27;s &quot;Good Morning America&quot; on October 23, 2013; 100 days after their birth, which is a Chinese tradition. The names are Mei Lun and Mei Huan. A sixth and seventh cub, both female, were born September 3, 2016. Their names were announced on their 100th day of life: Ya Lun and Xi Lun. Like their older siblings, the twins and their parents ultimately traveled to China on October 14, 2024. Lun Lun, Yang Yang, Mei Lan, Xi Lan, Po, Mei Lun, Mei Huan, Ya Lun and Xi Lun currently reside at the Chengdu Research Base of Giant Panda Breeding in China.

===The Ford African Rain Forest===

Twenty-four western lowland gorillas have been born at the zoo since the opening of &quot;The Ford African Rain Forest&quot; in 1988. Kali and Kazi, a rare set of twins, were born at Zoo Atlanta on October 31, 2005.

Zoo Atlanta also remains home to offspring of its best-known gorilla, Willie B. (ca. 1959–2000). The zoo is also home to six of Willie B.&#x27;s grandchildren: Merry Leigh (2011) and Mijadala (2016), born to Kudzoo; Anaka (2013), born to Sukari; Andi (2013) and Floyd (2019), born to Lulu. Others reside at other accredited zoos.

Other famous gorillas who have lived at Zoo Atlanta include Ivan, who resided at the Zoo from 1994 to his passing in 2012, and Ozzie, who lived at the Zoo from 1988 until his passing in 2022.

&quot;The Living Treehouse&quot; is an extension of &quot;The Ford African Rain Forest&quot; completed in 2004. The exhibit houses an aviary of African birds, as well as black-and-white ruffed lemurs and ring-tailed lemurs, with adjacent habitats for Angolan colobus monkeys, drills, Schmidt&#x27;s guenons, and Wolf&#x27;s guenons. In 2017, Zoo Atlanta introduced two crowned lemurs.

===Corridor to Change and Complex Carnivores===
Corridor to Change is focused on species impacted by the international wildlife trade. The complex is home to sun bears and Sumatran tigers. An adjacent area, Complex Carnivores, houses clouded leopards and binturongs.

===Asian Forest===
The &quot;Asian Forest&quot; houses giant otters, a Komodo dragon and a red panda, as well as Bornean and Sumatran orangutans.

The &quot;Orangutan Learning Tree Project&quot;, launched at Zoo Atlanta in 2007, utilizes in-habitat touch screen technology to allow orangutans to engage in computer puzzles, games and problem-solving exercises while guests observe their activities on a linked monitor.

===Orkin Children&#x27;s Zoo===

Zoo Atlanta&#x27;s &quot;Outback Station&quot; petting zoo is home to Saanen goats, Oberhasli goats, Nubian goats, Southdown babydoll sheep, Gulf Coast sheep, Nigerian dwarf goats, and two kunekune pigs.

===Aviaries===
Aviaries throughout Zoo Atlanta are home to more than 50 species. These include but are not limited to Bali mynas, white-headed buffalo weavers, superb starling, golden pheasant, king vulture, hooded vulture, Indian peafowl, blue-throated macaw, milky eagle owl, southern ground hornbill, tawny frogmouth, blue-throated laughingthrush, blue crane, wattled crane, and white storks.

Zoo Atlanta&#x27;s flock of Chilean flamingos, visible just inside the zoo entrance in Flamingo Plaza, has consistently bred and nested since 2001.

==Conservation and Research==

Zoo Atlanta&#x27;s mission statement is &quot;We save wildlife and their habitats through conservation, research, education, and engaging experiences. Our efforts connect people to animals and inspire conservation action.&quot;

Species impacted by conservation support from Zoo Atlanta have included but are not limited to giant pandas, African elephants, golden lion tamarins, western lowland gorillas, Panamanian golden frogs, red pandas, clouded leopards, giant otters, Bornean orangutans, African vulture species such as hooded vultures and lappet-faced vultures, and native reptile species such as eastern indigo snakes and diamondback terrapins.

In 2018, Zoo Atlanta was named a Top 10 Research Zoo for its contributions to peer-reviewed scientific research.

===Species Survival Plans===
Zoo Atlanta is a participant in the AZA Species Survival Plan for the following programs:
* Aruba Island rattlesnake
* Bali mynah
* Black rhino
* Bongo
* Burmese star tortoise
* Clouded leopard
* African elephant
* Giant panda
* Gorilla
* Golden lion tamarin
* Guenon
* Komodo dragon
* Kori bustard
* Lemur
* Lion
* Orangutan
* Otter
* Radiated tortoise
* Red panda
* Sumatran tiger
Zoo Atlanta also participates in several international conservation initiatives for reptiles and amphibians, working to combat issues such as the Asian Turtle Crisis and Global Amphibian Decline. Staff members from Zoo Atlanta and the Atlanta Botanical Garden have established captive assurance colonies of Panamanian frogs threatened by the spread of chytrid fungus. (Chytrid is the cause of the infectious amphibian disease chytridiomycosis.) 

==Savanna Hall==

Built in 1921, the historic Savanna Hall was for decades the former home of the Atlanta Cyclorama painting &quot;The Battle of Atlanta.&quot; The painting now resides at the Atlanta History Center.

Zoo Atlanta was granted stewardship of the structure by Atlanta mayor Kasim Reed in 2014. Upon restoring the building, Zoo Atlanta engaged in many efforts to retain nods to the structure&#x27;s history, including but not limited to preserving its original granite facade, original terra cotta walls, and original rail system used to hang the massive painting. These are visible in what is now the Michael and Thalia Carlos Ballroom.

Savanna Hall opened as a special events destination in 2019.

==Leadership==
Atlanta native Raymond B. King has served as president and CEO since 2010. Zoo Atlanta has a Board of Directors who are elected for three-year terms.

Dennis W. Kelly served as President and CEO from 2003 to 2009. Dr. Terry Maple is Zoo Director Emeritus of Zoo Atlanta. In 1985, he assumed management responsibility for zoo operations of the Atlanta-Fulton County Zoo, Inc, which was privatized and rebranded as Zoo Atlanta. Maple retired from Zoo Atlanta in 2003.

Duane Rumbaugh, a professor at Georgia State University in Atlanta, was a longtime advisor and researcher on animal behavior and welfare.

<text>Henån is a locality and the seat of Orust Municipality, Västra Götaland County, Sweden with 1,816 inhabitants in 2010.

==Overview==
Henån is home to approximately 2,000 permanent year-round residents with a significant increase of summer residents who come from the nearby towns and cities to stay in their summer cottages, which frequently are passed down for generations.

In 1850, Henån became one of the first swimming resorts in Sweden where people from Gothenburg, Alingsås, and other inland cities and towns came to stay with locals to enjoy the warm summer waters of the sea. Later the hotel and hostels were built and saw the town of Henån grow.

There is a boat-building tradition on Henån which still lives on amongst the residents. While most of the smaller traditional boat building shops have since long closed down, the traditional craft has turned out brands like Najad, Hallberg-Rassy, Malö Yachts, and Regina af Vindö.

<doc id="920800" wikidata="Q2975639" url="?curid=920800" title="Elemental Gimmick Gear">
<text>is an action role-playing game for the Sega Dreamcast console. &quot;Elemental Gimmick Gear&quot; uses hand-drawn art in an overhead view during exploration, then switches to 3D graphics during boss battles. It was developed by Birthday and published by Hudson Soft in Japan and Vatical Entertainment in the United States.

==Gameplay==
The game follows through several ruins, that contain puzzles needing to be solved to move forward. Puzzles include switches and moving objects to open doors.

There are racing areas where the main character rolls into a ball (or egg shape) and race along rails to be the first to finish against the computer players.

==Plot==
===Beginning===
In the world of Tokion, a dome-shaped ancient ruin was discovered inside a thick jungle. During excavation, an egg-shaped robot was found inside the ruins containing a sleeping man. No matter how hard scientists tried, he would not wake up. He was taken to a laboratory along with the machine to be further studied.

Upon analyzing the machine, they learned that it was over 5000 years old. They also could not find any form of power source. In time, the machine became known as &quot;Elemental Gimmick Gear&quot;, or EGG for short. After extensive scientific analysis over a number of years, copies of the EGG were produced and used as personal robots.

100 years later, the ruin suddenly became active after a group of robots activated a button, which unleashed the power of a scary holographic face called Psycho Mother. These robots were later revealed to be members of a gang called The Pirates. This incident was later dubbed by the Tokionese as &quot;The Breeding&quot;, as the power of Psycho Mother created a multitude of tentacles into the ground. They spread all across the land, destroying anything in their way and spawning a horde of killer monsters and robots in the process. With the tentacles came a thick layer of fog that surrounded the ruin, and people gave them the name Fogna.

At the same time, the Sleeper who was discovered a century prior finally awoke. He had not aged a day since his discovery and had no memory of his past or his own name. Selen, who was with him as he woke, set him free without notifying the other scientists in the lab. Naming him at default as Leon, she sent him to Fogna to begin searching for clues of what happened 5100 years ago, and to stop &quot;The Breeding&quot;. Because Leon spends most of his time inside his EGG robot, many players have referred to the protagonist simply as &quot;EGG&quot; (said letter-by-letter).

===Middle===

While making his way through the first areas of Fogna, battling brain robots and a spider named Jointer (earning a Fire Stone), EGG returns to the village to hear that Selen was kidnapped by The Pirates. The Pirates are a vicious gang of robots led by Juji, the brutal dictator of Tokion that has long oppressed its people.

Upon talking to many of the townspeople (being asleep for 5100 years, EGG is unfamiliar with where he lives), he learns that Juji resides in Metal Heaven, a steampunk sky village that is rumoured to be &quot;a paradise&quot;. The only way to get there is to succeed a series of life-threatening trials at Fog Tower, which connects Metal Heaven to Tokion. This tower serves as a buffer zone to prevent ordinary people from entering Metal Heaven, by which only Juji&#x27;s bravest Pirates are able to pass the challenges. EGG uses the Fire Stone that he found from defeating Jointer to break the branches that block his way to Fog Tower, saving a woman stuck behind the branches. However, he then learns that he needs the Ice Stone as well to freeze the ponds that guard Fog Tower. He finds that stone after exploring Fogna&#x27;s back entrance, where he encounters The Pirates face-to-face for the first time.

EGG uses the Ice Stone to access Fog tower, and completes all of the puzzles and challenges successfully. In the last challenge of Fog Tower, EGG was forced to fight Maximum, Juji&#x27;s right-hand man. After EGG severely damaged Maximum (despite being alive still), Juji ordered two of his Pirates to throw him off the tower, as Juji felt that Maximum was &quot;a weakling&quot; upon his loss in the battle. Juji offers EGG to be his new right-hand man, and tells him to go to The Factory to meet up with him. Although EGG knows that his goal is to find Selen, and that Juji is an enemy, EGG agrees so he can get access to The Factory.

On the top floor of The Factory, EGG is able to find Selen, and he proceeds to find Juji in the next room. Although Juji treats him in a friendly manner, EGG shows him his true feelings, wanting payback for kidnapping Selen. Angered and betrayed, Juji gets inside of a large robots, and a boss fight ensures.

Upon destroying the robot and capturing Juji, EGG is awarded $1000 by the village mayor, a knight named Henry. Rots, the owner of the Eastokion Bar, is furious at Juji for an unexplained grudge that they have against each other. If EGG apologizes to Juji after Rots leaves in anger, he will begin to talk to EGG in a friendlier manner (despite being angry for what happened at The Factory) This decision made by the player will help to reveal a major plot point not found anywhere else in the game. Selen, back at the laboratory, awards EGG a propellor, which he can use to explore the flooded basement of Fogna. There, he needs to locate a green Plasma Stone to activate the elevator at Fogna&#x27;s main entrance. The elevator takes EGG to Fogna&#x27;s second floor, which has a long tentacle bridge at the second floors exit. This bridge takes him to a place called Trench Plant, an underwater base where EGG&#x27;s (unknowingly) long lost friend, Omega, resides. This is around the point when EGG begins to remember who he was and his past.

EGG is only familiar to Omega from three prior, yet vague, flashbacks:

::: 1st (before encountering The Pirates at Fogna)- Omega and EGG (as Dr. Beta) are in a rocky environment on a different planet (judging by the rocky textures), discussing organism samples that died off. They agree that they need to find more samples.

::: 2nd (when entering Metal Heaven)- Omega and EGG are standing in front of a large war robot called Armordress. They discuss how they built it, and that they are afraid “for the time when it must be used”. They fear that the machine could “extinct humanity”.

::: 3rd (at the tentacle bridge)- An earthquake occurs, and EGG becomes trapped underneath rocks. EGG was left there for 5,000 years until the excavation at the beginning of the game.

After having a lengthy discussion with Omega about their shared past, EGG is clarified about who he was. EGG was originally a scientist named Dr. Beta, who helped to construct a colony on the moon (Moon Colony). He was also an important researcher there. It was constructed during the time of World War 3, where the world became so ravaged and destroyed, that people lived at the colony until it was safe enough to return to Earth. The Armordress from the second flashback was what made World War 3 deadlier than it should have been. Fogna served as a “gateway” between Earth and Moon Colony. Omega states that Psycho Mother was originally programmed by a scientist named Alpha. Because he isn&#x27;t mentioned anywhere else in the game, this character was most likely to be used for a future sequel, which never came to be. Omega orders EGG to go to Moon Colony, using the spaceship at Fog Tower to get there. However, while riding the ship, Psycho Mother learns of EGG&#x27;s and Omega&#x27;s actions. Omega is killed, and EGG dodges a tentacle launched at him.

At Moon Colony, all of the previous robots that were stationed there have gone haywire, due to the powers of Psycho Mother. There, EGG finds Moon Colony&#x27;s main computer, Grand Mother. She orders EGG to find the Nova Stone, which can unlock the 16th basement of Fogna where Psycho Mother lives. She wants Psycho Mother to be defeated once and for all.

===End===

EGG finds the Nova Stone from Moon Colony, and returns to Tokion back on Earth. If EGG speaks with Juji at the village square before pursuing Psycho mother one-on-one, the player will have to make two very important choices. If the player selects EGG to say &quot;I refuse (the money)&quot; and &quot;No, I feel sorry for you&quot;, EGG will learn things of Juji&#x27;s past. During the conversation, Juji begins to speak in a sad and more human tone, compared to his personality as a brutal dictator. He even speaks pleasantly about a child who offered him bread. EGG can then go to meet Rots at the Easttokion Bar. After Rots asks EGG how Juji is doing, the player should select &quot;He was thinking&quot;. Rots then leaves to meet Juji. However, once EGG goes back to the village square, Juji is nowhere to be found, and Rots explains to him their grudge (which was before unexplained):

::: Rots and Juji were best friends, and both worked as archaeologists. Juji had a 5-year-old son named Timmy, who would follow them on their excavations. When they went inside Fogna to find something (years before &quot;The Breeding&quot; took place), an earthquake happened, and Timmy became trapped under rocks. Rots and Juji quickly run out of Fogna to check to see if we were safe. Unfortunately, Juji struggled to get Timmy out of the rocks, so Rots went around town to get help. However, no one was willing to help, and Timmy died in front of Juji&#x27;s eyes as a result.

::: Once Juji became Tokion&#x27;s dictator, he would purge its people out of revenge of neglecting his son. To ensure the last step of the people&#x27;s destruction, Juji ordered his Pirates to go to the bottom of Fogna, to find &quot;Fogna&#x27;s ultimate power&quot; (he is referring to what was later discovered to be Psycho Mother). This was the exact moment that created &quot;The Breeding&quot;, and all of the tentacles that destroyed Tokion.

::: Rots then told EGG that Juji stole a man&#x27;s robot to stop &quot;The Breeding&quot; and Psycho Mother himself, trying to correct his past wrongdoing of unleashing her power.

Once EGG reaches the last room of Fogna&#x27;s 16th basement, EGG confronts Psycho Mother. She is in an extremely mad state, appearing more vicious and scary than before. Before shutting down permanently, Psycho Mother uses the last of her energy to hatch the large snowglobe egg found in the center of Fogna. A large tube tunnel of tentacles is created from the snowglobe egg, connecting to Fogna&#x27;s rooftop. There, Psycho Mother&#x27;s son Noman is born.

Upon taking the elevator to the snowglobe egg room, Juji is seen at the brink of death. In his last breaths, Juji tells EGG how he unsuccessfully tried to stop Psycho Mother and her forces, and that EGG is the last hope in stopping &quot;The Breeding&quot; that he created long ago. Juji also offers EGG an Energy Tank before dying. Without it, EGG will have a very difficult time defeating Noman.

In his last words, Juji says, &quot;Oh... He&#x27;s calling me... Timmy, Daddy&#x27;s here...&quot;

Confronting Noman on Fogna&#x27;s roof, Noman attaches himself to a large monster to make him unstoppable. EGG successfully defeats Noman and the monster, sending him through a black hole. Upon the defeat, EGG&#x27;s friends congratulate him for stopping Psycho Mother and her forces (especially for Noman). However, EGG tells them that the only way &quot;The Breeding&quot; can officially be ended is for him to return to Moon Colony, shutting down Fogna permanently from there. As a result, EGG cannot return to Earth to visit his friends. EGG wishes them a final farewell before leaving and permanently shuts down Fogna with the Grand Mother computer. Fogna couldn&#x27;t be shut down prior to EGG&#x27;s first visit with Grand Mother, as Psycho Mother&#x27;s power prevented Fogna from being able to self-destruct.

The game ends with an important life message:

::: &quot;In the past, people made many mistakes. We still do. That may never change. However, we are also given the ability to correct mistakes and make fresh starts. As long as we do not forget that, we can rise again and again after any degree of destruction. We should be able to live along with our planet because we are also one of the lives that it has created and raised. In the future, our planet may be blessed with beautiful and perfect civilizations. Or it may be violated again. It is... up to us...&quot;

With reading the plotline and all its complex details, the context is obvious. This is explaining Juji&#x27;s past evil and his change-of-heart in helping EGG to stop Psycho Mother (who he sent his Pirates to unleash at the beginning of the game).

==Characters==

;Sleeper
&quot;The Sleeper&quot;, Leon is the main character of the game. Leon is his default name, he is given it by Selen, the scientist watching over him. The player has the option of renaming him if desired. At the beginning of the game, Leon is frozen in a sleeping pod in the laboratory of Dr. Yam. Leon had been found 200 years earlier inside the original EGG, in which he had slept for 5000 years.

;Dr. Yam
Dr. Yam is the head doctor at YAM Ruin Laboratory, which his father founded, where Leon awakes at the start of the game. He has spent his life studying the Sleeper. He takes care of Selen as if she were his daughter and gave her the assignment of studying the Sleeper.

;Selen
Selen works in the laboratory, where she is responsible for caring for the Sleeper, whom she names Leon. She is the one who was with Leon as he woke and allows him to leave the lab. She always supports him.

;Luckie
Luckie is an orphan who lost his parents during the Fogna activation. He lives in the city near YAM Ruin Laboratory with his younger sister. He is the leader of the local orphans from the Fogna disaster.

==Reception==
The game received above-average reviews according to the review aggregation website GameRankings. In Japan, &quot;Famitsu&quot; gave it a score of 27 out of 40. E. Coli of &quot;GamePro&quot; said, &quot;&quot;E.G.G.&quot; has a surprisingly small world, and playing time depends mostly on how fast you can solve its mysteries. While it lacks depth, &quot;E.G.G.&quot; does offer some interesting and complex puzzles that will appeal mostly to gamers who aren&#x27;t in a hurry.&quot;

<text>Kungshamn (&quot;King&#x27;s Landing&quot;) is a locality and the seat of Sotenäs Municipality in Västra Götaland County, Sweden with 3071 citizens (in 2011). During summers, population is doubled multiple times, as Kungshamn is a popular tourist visit.

The town consists of the former towns of &quot;Gravarne&quot;, &quot;Bäckevik&quot; and &quot;Fisketången&quot;. Kungshamn is situated on a peninsula just north of Lysekil and on the same latitude as Uddevalla, Skövde and Linköping. Since 1970, the town is connected to the Smögen island by a bridge.

Kungshamn is known for its fishing industry. The Abba Seafood company is located next to Smögen Bridge. Since 1920, all products for the company have been manufactured in the town.

== Name ==
The direct translation of Kungshamn is &quot;King&#x27;s harbour&quot; but mostly known as and correctly translated to &quot;King&#x27;s Landing&quot;. The name implies a connection to a king, but its origin is unknown. The locality was named Kungshamn in the 1960s. Before the renaming, it consisted of the smaller settlements Gravarne, Bäckevik and Fisketången. The names referred to the small communities located in the &quot;Kungshamn area&quot;. Gravarne was the most commonly used in the late 20th century and fishermen used that name on their boats to identify their home port.

== History ==
All of Bohuslän used to belong to Norway until it was seceded to Sweden in the 1658 Treaty of Roskilde. During the Middle Ages, foreigners were attracted by the rich herring fishing and therefore came to the west coast of Sweden to fish herring and later export it. Toll houses were established and one of the largest was in Kungshamn. Due to the herring fishing more and more people came to settle down in the Kungshamn locality. A more permanent village was established during the 19th century, due to a period of exceptional rich herring fishing.

== Nature ==
The north eastern part of Kungshamn is forested. The landscape is characteristic for Bohuslän, with predominantly bare granite cliffs intersected by deep valleys with shrub bog areas, rich with birdlife. In the forest there is a hiking trail. The trail goes through Kungshamn and continues into other localities within the Sotenäs Municipality.

<doc id="920806" wikidata="Q1018719" url="?curid=920806" title="Kopparberg">
<text>Kopparberg is a locality and the seat of Ljusnarsberg Municipality, Örebro County, Sweden, with 4,200 inhabitants in 2015. It is famous for one of the most valuable postage stamps in the world, the Treskilling Yellow from 13 July 1857, Kopparberg&#x27;s wooden church (voted No. 1 in Sweden in 2006), and Kopparberg Cider, now one of the best selling ciders in the UK and worldwide.

This name is traditionally associated with Falun, some 90 km to the north, and gave its name to Kopparbergs län (Kopparberg County, now called Dalarna County) and the 700-year-old mining company Stora Kopparberg, which is now part of Stora Enso. However, the town was founded as late as 1635 with the name Nya Kopparberget. It was named after the copper mines that were, in the 18th century, a major supply of the world&#x27;s copper, and a considerable contributor to the Swedish national economy. Kopparberg lies on a major north–south road, 80 km north of Sweden&#x27;s sixth most populous city, Örebro. Örebro is in the middle of Sweden, lying on the east–west 500 km/300 mile E18/E20 highway and also railway lines that directly connect Stockholm, Sweden, to Oslo, Norway. These are some of the busiest in Sweden.

== Population ==
Kopparberg has approximately 4,200 inhabitants, although its population has been steadily declining over the past 40 years. The population is ageing as the young people move away to education, jobs, and a more entertaining life in the larger cities, Örebro University and the Kopparberg Brewery being the major attractions for many. However people born in Kopparberg tend to return as they get older. Almost 10% of the inhabitants are immigrants. This is due to the influx of immigrants the town receives through the auspices of the Swedish Government. Politically, it has a somewhat higher concentration of those who favour the Miljöpartiet (Environmental or Green Party) and the Vänsterpartiet (former Communist Party).

== Geography ==
Kopparberg lies in a mountainous mid-lower-central district of Sweden named Bergslagen, after the regional laws and customs prevailing there. Another name applied to the region is &quot;mellansverige&quot; = middle Sweden. This particular region was one of the last to be settled in Sweden. Certain varieties of plant and mushroom are only found in their particular forms in Bergslagen.

==Climate==
The Bergslagen area is comparatively cool compared to lowland areas further south in the county such as Örebro. Kopparberg has a cool humid continental climate due to recent mildening of the climate. In the 1961–1990 reference period the nearest weather station at nearby locality Ställdalen indicated a maritime type of a subarctic climate.

Although Kopparberg is slightly further south, it is located at a slightly higher elevation south-east, rendering likely values very similar. Winter highs usually average just below freezing, and frosts are frequent from October through April. Summers are very tempered, compared to both the Mälar Valley to the south and east and central Dalarna to the north. The warmest recorded temperature of is still high by Swedish standards, courtesy of the unpredictability of its far inland position.

== Tourism ==

=== Sightseeing ===
Among the sights are Kopparberg&#x27;s Church (voted as the nicest church in Sweden), Gillersklack (ski sports, walking, pools), Finngruvan (the copper mines), and the natural environment of the area. Nearby is Kloten, a well-established recreation and hunting area. Neighbours from the eastern side of the Baltic Sea are attracted in the summer every year by the available harvests of lingonberries, a small, ground growing version of cranberry, and by bilberries. They come and pick berries by the bucket, and either sell them in Sweden, or take them back to their native countries.

=== Culture and events ===
Kopparbergs Marknad (Fair) is held on the last weekend of September. It has been billed as the third largest annual fair in Sweden. Around 125,000 people attend this, depending on the weather. The event starts on Friday afternoon (the carnival is held on Friday evening, lasting until midnight) and the fair continues until Sunday afternoon. A variety of items are sold, including clothing, footwear, jewellery, electrical, cooking and household goods, DVDs, CDs, tapes, second-hand books, magazines and food, including hot, fresh corn-on-the-cob. Some live entertainment is available too.
Annually, in late June or early July, the town is host to a gold panning contest. The Swedish Gold Panning Championship has been held here several times, and Kopparberg has also hosted the World Gold Panning Championship.

Once per year, generally in June, a gem and mineral show, billed as the largest in Europe, is held in the northern part of the town.

Opera på Skäret is home to a cultural association, and is situated in the northwest part of the town, where it hosts concerts and events.

13 July every year is a special day, commemorating the Treskilling Yellow stamp. The stamp is one of the most valuable postage stamps in the world, and it was minted in Kopparberg on 13 July 1857.

== Transportation ==

=== Bus ===
Kopparberg is reachable from the north or south via the local bus company LänsTrafiken, based in Örebro (1.5 hours), and a national bus line, Swebus, from destinations throughout Sweden.

=== Train ===
Kopparberg is connected by train to Örebro (80 km, journey time approximately 1 hour) and Hallsberg (108 km) to the south, and Ludvika (40 km), Borlänge (90 km), and Falun (120 km) to the north.

== Business life ==
The largest company in Kopparberg town is Kopparbergs Brewery, with around 150 employees. Independently owned by the Bronsman family, the brewery has gone on to produce the UK&#x27;s number 1 fruit cider and the most recognisable fruit cider in the world - listed in 37 countries worldwide. Business seems to have diversified slightly over the last 10 years.

== Kopparberg&#x27;s economics ==
The first employment in the area came about because of the mines. At that time it was mining, smelting, and various general supportive enterprises which formed the basis of the town.

Later metal products and manufacturing came into vogue. B. Nilsson AB&#x27;s Bandstål (&quot;band&quot; = strip, &quot;stål&quot; = steel) manufacturing and sales is still in business today, situated in the business park to the south of town, called Bångbro (&quot;bång&quot; = bang, &quot;bro&quot; = bridge), so-called because it lies south of the bridge, in an area notable for industries whose work involved repetitive banging noises.

More recently, one of the town&#x27;s best established and most significant employers is the Kopparbergs Brewery, owned by two brothers, which manufactures various alcoholic drinks. Kopparberg Premium Cider is one of their brands of Swedish fruit ciders, first launched in 1997, which is exported to United States of America, United Kingdom, Finland and the Republic of Ireland amongst other countries. The ciders are manufactured with an alcohol content that varies from 0 to 8.5%. Many flavours are in production, but the most widely distributed are Apple, Pear and Raspberry/Blackcurrant (although strawberry is gaining in popularity). The pear cider is sold by IKEA in a non-alcoholic version in many countries. The brewery also makes &quot;Sofiero Original&quot;, which has been the most popular beer in Sweden since its release in 2003.

More recently, a foreign company, called QXL, came to do an Internet bid-on-products until deadline auction service (eBay-type) business from Kopparberg. PC Express bought the firm and used the warehouse, but later moved the business to Sweden&#x27;s capital Stockholm.

== History ==

=== Kopparberg&#x27;s mines ===
According to current research, an ancient meteor landed approximately 14.5 million years ago to the west-northwest of the city. This area is particularly rich in certain minerals, and a most diverse variety of minerals is to be found in the region. Copper was discovered on the surface no later than 1634 on the hills that now form part of the town of Kopparberg, itself, and stretch out to the north. Word quickly spread of the richness of the copper veins. As mining, particularly in the winter, was hard and difficult, and the Finns were acclimatized to hard work under cold conditions, they readily took to mining and refining this rich source of copper. The largest mine is called Finngruvan (Fin = Finland or Finns, gruvan = the mine), which lies just outside the town, proper, to the north. The veins were almost completely pure copper, with trace amounts of silver and gold.

=== Kopparberg&#x27;s church ===
In the old days, the church was the centre of all local activity on Sundays. Kopparberg&#x27;s church was begun in 1635, and the first incarnation was completed shortly thereafter. The church was voted as the most beautiful church in Sweden in a voting held by the Swedish magazine &quot;Året Runt&quot; in February 2006. The church is named &quot;Ljusnarsbergs Kyrka&quot; after the parish Ljusnarsberg.

In 1674 a residence for the clock (bells) keeper was created, called Klockargården (&quot;klock&quot; = bell, &quot;gården&quot; = plot). That site serves today as the headquarters and school for KomVux, a multi-purpose educational institution for those training for new work, those out of work, and immigrants. You can notice the age of the building by how you have to stoop to go through the inner doors between rooms. People were shorter in olden days.

=== Ljusnarsberg architecture ===
Most old buildings are log cabins or other wooden houses (&quot;trähus&quot; in Swedish). These are mostly protected by red stain produced from the mines of the name of Kopparberg in Falun. This stain is universal in Sweden and all the barns are painted with Falun Red, with very few exceptions. This gives the landscape a uniform effect: Grass is green and barns and houses are red. Later, many of these, not all, came to be covered with mortar, stucco, and other sidings, giving them even more cold resistance and durability. Many of these buildings from hundreds of years ago are still standing and quite functional.

<doc id="920815" wikidata="Q1216882" url="?curid=920815" title="The Tracey Ullman Show">
<text>The Tracey Ullman Show is an American television sketch comedy variety show starring Tracey Ullman. It debuted on Fox on April 5, 1987, as the network&#x27;s second original primetime series to air, following &quot;Married... with Children&quot;, and ran for four seasons and 81 episodes until May 26, 1990. It was produced by Gracie Films in association with 20th Century Fox Television. The show blended sketch comedy with musical numbers and dance routines, choreographed by Paula Abdul, along with animated shorts. The format was conceived by co-creator and executive producer James L. Brooks, who was looking to showcase the show&#x27;s multitalented star. Brooks likened the show to producing three pilots a week. Ullman was the first British woman to be offered her own television sketch show in the United States.

The show is also known for producing a series of shorts featuring the Simpson family, which was later adapted into the longest-running American scripted primetime television series, &quot;The Simpsons&quot;. &quot;The Tracey Ullman Show&quot; was the first Fox primetime show to win an Emmy Award, winning a total of 10 over its run.

&quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked &quot;The Tracey Ullman Show&quot; as the 25th-best sketch comedy show in its &quot;40 Greatest Sketch-Comedy TV Shows of All Time&quot; list.

==Development==
British actress, comedian, singer, and former dancer Tracey Ullman was encouraged to try to break into American television by her husband, British producer Allan McKeown, who was looking to station himself in the United States. Ullman, who was already a household name in her native Britain, had already been making the rounds in the US promoting her film and music career in the mid 1980s. Unlike British audiences, Americans were not aware of her comedy background outside of humorous appearances on &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot; and &quot;Late Night with David Letterman&quot;. Ullman already had three British comedy television shows under her belt, garnering her awards and accolades. &quot;I didn&#x27;t believe there was anything above &quot;Webster&quot; standard [in America]. I was wrong.&quot; Her British agent put together a compilation of her work and began circulating it around Hollywood. Her tape landed in the lap of Craig Kellem, vice president of comedy at Universal Television. &quot;I could not believe my eyes. It was just about the most extraordinary piece of material I&#x27;d seen in a long time.&quot; He wanted production on a series to begin immediately for her. &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; scribe and creator of CBS&#x27;s &quot;Square Pegs&quot;, Anne Beatts was hired to write the pilot. While Universal liked the script, Ullman didn&#x27;t appreciate changes that senior executives wanted to make. Recalling the project: &quot;We&#x27;d just hit on an idea, then some white-haired executive – very, very important – would come in from the race track and say, &#x27;I don&#x27;t like that idea. I think Tracey should be a caring person. I think there should be a kid in this. Now, I&#x27;m just pitching here. I don&#x27;t know if this is funny. But I think Tracey should love this kid and maybe there&#x27;s a moment where she tells the kid something about life.&#x27; And I&#x27;d say, &quot;Look – I don&#x27;t want to work with little kids being cute who I eventually adopt&#x27;.&quot;

Ullman&#x27;s new agent, Martha Luttrell sent her tape to James L. Brooks, who had a deal with Fox. Fox, dubbed America&#x27;s &quot;fourth network&quot;, was looking to create its own brand of original primetime programming. Brooks was bowled over by Ullman&#x27;s material. &quot;I saw original talent, and how often does that happen to you?&quot; &quot;I started showing [her work] to people like you&#x27;d show home movies.&quot; &quot;I was just startled by the size of the talent. I got chills.&quot; Ullman explained to Brooks her situation at CBS and the fact that she was now pregnant. Brooks convinced her to get out of the CBS deal, and after she had her baby, they would do a show together. Brooks felt that a sketch show would best suit her assets (acting, singing, and dancing). &quot;Why would you do something with Tracey playing a single character on TV when her talent requires variety? You can&#x27;t categorize Tracey, so it&#x27;s silly to come up with a show that attempted to.&quot;

To ensure that she was well-versed in American comedy, Brooks began sending her tapes of American sitcoms and variety shows to watch and study. Ullman also began visiting and spending time at the Museum of Television &amp; Radio.

&quot;After I made [the 1985 film] &quot;Plenty&quot;, I thought it was sad that everyone left London to go home to Hollywood. Thought I&#x27;d join &#x27;em. [...] I thought of myself as a Peter Sellers type. No one does American accents better than him. Look at &quot;Dr. Strangelove&quot; and &quot;Lolita&quot;&quot;. As one critic noted, Sellers had American director Stanley Kubrick as his visionary and Ullman would get American television and film director James L. Brooks, the man behind such hit television shows as &quot;The Mary Tyler Moore Show&quot;, &quot;Taxi&quot;, and &quot;Rhoda&quot;, and the films &quot;Terms of Endearment&quot; and &quot;Broadcast News&quot;. &quot;I came to America in 1985 and James made me stay. If I had a mentor like him in Great Britain, I would&#x27;ve stayed there.&quot;

&quot;Variety hadn&#x27;t been done for sometime and we wanted to do a show that would allow me to do the things I like to do and can do,&quot; stated Ullman in 1987. &quot;I think, literally, the word unique and mean it,&quot; said Brooks in regards to Ullman&#x27;s talent. &quot;We&#x27;re so obsessed with comparisons. The only one I could even think of that comparing her to is Peter Sellers – he&#x27;s the only one you can mention. He could do a variety of Americans. And then you have to add that Tracey sings and dances.&quot;

The key to getting Ullman ready for primetime was &quot;assembling the right people&quot; according to Brooks. Brooks, along with co-executive Jerry Belson, Ken Estin, and Heide Perlman, went on a retreat in Northern California to think through the show. &quot;We wanted to tell a story, to be involved in character. We did not want to do spoofs or takeoffs. You define a show by what you don&#x27;t want to do as well as by what you do. We rushed on the air and have been finding the show while we&#x27;re on the air. You lose a lot of sleep that way, but it&#x27;s great. Now, we have five or six characters that we repeat from time to time, and new ones are candidates for repetition.&quot; When it came to Fox, Brooks stated, &quot;It was helpful for us to do the show without any preconceived context. Not only were we new, but so was Fox. There was no notion of something to fit into.&quot; Fox was reportedly backing the show with nearly $1,000,000 per broadcast. The series landed an initial 26-episode commitment deal, unheard of for a television comedy; Fox ordered a further 30 episodes in October 1987. Describing the show proved difficult; creator Ken Estin dubbed it a &quot;skitcom&quot;.

An array of original and diverse characters was created for Ullman to perform. Extensive makeup, wigs, teeth, and body padding were used, sometimes rendering her completely unrecognizable. One original character created solely by Ullman back in Britain was uprooted for the show: long-suffering British spinster Kay Clark. Kay was based on a real woman who worked in a Midlands bank that Ullman kept in touch with long after leaving Britain for the United States. &quot;Kay&quot; would ask her about Hollywood on the telephone; Ullman would subsequently do the voice she heard on the other line to her dog. She had been obsessed with spinsters ever since she was a small child, and kept a mental file on them. She never saw &quot;Kay&quot; and imagined what she looked like. &quot;Tracey Ullman Show&quot; costume designer Jame Ruhm suggested a drooping bust and cellulite-covered hips for the character. Ruhm created a costume complete with &quot;hydraulic pistons&quot;. &quot;Tracey is really, really interested in what her characters look like,&quot; revealed Ruhm. &quot;She is constantly going around collecting pictures of people and coming to me and saying, &#x27;I want to do a character dressed like this!&#x27; I file that in my memory, and then we&#x27;ll get a script and I&#x27;ll say, &#x27;That character that you wanted to do, can we use it on this?&#x27; She&#x27;ll say, &#x27;Yeah!&#x27; And we&#x27;ll go.&quot; &quot;It&#x27;s a real thrill to me that someone like Kay can be famous in America.&quot;

For other characters, she drew upon people she either knew or celebrities for inspiration. &quot;I based one character on Maggie Smith, which the script supervisor suggested. I remember her in &quot;California Suite&quot; saying, &#x27;Well, I don&#x27;t care if I didn&#x27;t win the fucking Oscar.&#x27;... It sounded good. It made me laugh, and then I felt that I could do the character.&quot; She based the character Francesca on a neighbor, an awkward teenaged girl, who would come to visit her in her kitchen and would sheepishly stand in the corner. &quot;I wanted to portray painful adolescence, but not an adolescent that was spoiled. I&#x27;d seen so many that were just, &#x27;Like I really want to go to the movies, and you&#x27;re totally stupid.&#x27; I didn&#x27;t want to play a horrible kid.&quot; Ullman believed in progressing the characters, adamant that they didn&#x27;t stagnate. &quot;You have to advance the characters [...] you have to find new situations for them [...] They have to do something or say something or grow as people. And they have to be unusual.&quot; Like Kay, another character created and performed by Ullman first for British television (&quot;Three of a Kind&quot;) and then adapted for the Fox show was impoverished housewife Betty Tomlinson.

Producers decided to add animated segments when they had trouble figuring out a way to end one sketch and go into the next. They had considered talking animals, specifically a talking bear. &quot;I don&#x27;t know why we were so into a bear,&quot; explained Ken Estin. &quot;Nobody was in love with that idea, but we just couldn&#x27;t think of how else to do it. In most variety shows, it was just sketches that were so short that they didn&#x27;t have to worry about from going from one to the next. Nobody had ever really done this before.&quot; Estin was given with a drawing of &quot;Life in Hell&quot; by Matt Groening from Richard Sakai. &quot;It was very different. It was smart. It was unusual. It was drawn poorly, which I thought added the charm [...] I said, &#x27;What if we have this guy do these little cartoons in between the scenes? Is that possible? Does anybody like that idea?&#x27; They all said they liked the idea. This is how Matt ended up being our guy.&quot; James L. Brooks was also familiar with Groening&#x27;s work. Polly Platt, producer of his film &quot;Terms of Endearment&quot; had given him a cartoon called &quot;Success and Failure in Hollywood&quot; drawn by Groening as a gift. Platt suggested that he do a special on the characters.

Heide Perlman found another artist to do animated segments – M.K. Brown, who worked for &quot;National Lampoon&quot;. She agreed to do a cartoon based around a female psychiatrist, Dr. N!Godatu. Producers stopped hearing from Groening when Fox wanted to take over &quot;Life in Hell&quot; merchandising as part of his deal, resulting in his passing on the project. Estin asked Sakai to ask Groening if he had any characters that he would be willing to allow Fox to merchandise. Groening said that he did have other characters and would send them over for consideration. &quot;Well, two, maybe three days after I spoke to Richard, Matt sends us a drawing of the Simpsons exactly as–well, not exactly–almost exactly as they are. Anyhow, everybody said, &#x27;Fine. That&#x27;s fine. We like them.&#x27; And Matt made his deal with Fox.&quot; Eventually, producers found that Groening&#x27;s work suited the show better than Brown&#x27;s and her segments were no longer used. Tracey Ullman was approached to do one of the voices of the Simpsons, but with her already spending up to three hours in the makeup chair, adding voice-over work was not feasible. Fellow cast member Julie Kavner then agreed to do it. Groening approached Ullman sporadically about doing a guest voice for the shorts, but with her heavy workload, she never had the time.

Early reports regarding the show&#x27;s premise were: The focal point would be Ullman starring in one, 12-minute-long &quot;playlet&quot;, a shorter sketch, some music, and a weekly lecture from Harry Shearer. The show would start with no pilot and a 26-episode commitment, and would be produced by Brooks along with some of the top writers from &quot;Cheers&quot;. Shearer&#x27;s weekly lecture never materialized.

When the time came to go out and promote the show, Fox only allowed Ullman to tour Los Angeles and New York. In 1988, she insisted that she be allowed to tour Middle America. Never a fan of dialect coaches, this promotional tour would allow her to have ample opportunity to do some character study. &quot;I want to see America a bit, I really do. I&#x27;ve only been to LA and New York, and they make very disparaging remarks about Middle America there. I mean, Des Moines, Iowa, is the place network executives always talk about, like, &quot;Would they like this in Des Moines?&#x27; They think you just want &quot;Facts of Life&quot; and &quot;She&#x27;s the Sheriff&quot;, that you really want that type of television, and I don&#x27;t really believe that you do. There&#x27;s no intelligence, no truth in anything like that. I think you want something a bit smarter. [...] We take pictures everywhere [on this promotional tour]; we&#x27;re taping people&#x27;s voices. I&#x27;m taking it all in, and it&#x27;s great. Some journalist once said that I was a &#x27;social satirist,&#x27; and I thought, &#x27;That sounds quite intelligent, doesn&#x27;t?&#x27; So that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m doing, I&#x27;m meeting people from a social satirist&#x27;s point of view.&quot; Whenever she was stuck on particular voice or accent, she would open a phone directory. &quot;If I wanted to do somebody from Brooklyn, I would call the library in Brooklyn and listen to their voice and tape them surreptitiously so they didn&#x27;t know.&quot;

Also helping her in her quest for accents was the show&#x27;s staff. When she had to find a Brooklyn accent distinctive from the Queens accent she used for her character, United States postal worker Tina, she had the show&#x27;s staff make a long compilation tape of genuine Brooklyn accents (recordings from radio stations and even randomly placed phone calls placed to random Brooklynites). Ullman would also call car dealerships in different parts of the country pretending to be interested in buying a car just to hear how the people there spoke.

==Production==
===Casting===
Dan Castellaneta, a relative unknown, was asked to read for the show after he was spotted by Ullman at Chicago&#x27;s The Second City. Castellaneta&#x27;s portrayal of a blind man who wants to be a comedian brought her to tears instead of making her laugh. Ullman told producers that she wouldn&#x27;t do the show if Castellaneta wasn&#x27;t hired. He gave up the opportunity to appear in the short-lived sitcom version of the film &quot;Nothing in Common&quot;, in which he appeared, so as to star in the Ullman show. &quot;Tracey always says, &#x27;You&#x27;re so lucky, Dan. You can always go back to &quot;Nothing in Common&quot;,&quot; joked Castellaneta in a 1988 interview. Describing the show, Castellaneta stated, &quot;Essentially what dictates it is that there are no parodies and even if it&#x27;s an unusual situation, Tracey and (executive producer) Jim Brooks try to keep things as believable and real. You&#x27;ve got to be honest.&quot; He would continue to stay true to his Second City philosophy when playing comedy and characters. &quot;Don&#x27;t ever do what&#x27;s expected. Always try to find a different way of doing something. ...Always play to the top of your intelligence. A character should be as smart as you are. And if the character isn&#x27;t as smart as you are, you can&#x27;t make a comment about it, you can&#x27;t make fun of the character.&quot; Castellaneta felt that audiences could see right through a character that wasn&#x27;t done honestly and that &quot;The Tracey Ullman Show&quot;&#x27;s audience were both pretty demanding, as well as intelligent. &quot;They&#x27;re people who like something different, they&#x27;re certainly an intelligent audience. And they&#x27;re an audience that isn&#x27;t as easily offended as other people might be.&quot;

Actress Julie Kavner had co-starred in Brooks&#x27; spin-off series to &quot;The Mary Tyler Moore Show&quot;, &quot;Rhoda&quot;, starring Valerie Harper. Kavner played Harper&#x27;s younger, socially awkward sister Brenda, a role for which she won an Emmy Award. Kavner was at the top of the list of people Brooks wanted to be part of the show. Brooks on Kavner: &quot;When somebody&#x27;s intrinsically funny – you know, in-their-bones funny – they never have to work at (being funny), so they&#x27;re free to work on other things. We were all nuts about her work. She was the person we most wanted to work with Tracey.&quot;

Actor Sam McMurray read for a guest spot on the show playing William, lover of 13-year-old valley girl Francesca&#x27;s (Ullman) father. McMurray recalled his casting: &quot;The first Francesca sketch, they said, &#x27;Play the guy not so gay.&#x27; And I said &#x27;I disagree.&#x27; I had a big mouth then -— still do. I said, &#x27;I think he&#x27;s more the woman. I think he&#x27;s more out there.&#x27; So I read and I read it big, and they cast me. It was just a one-off, and then we were on hiatus. I did the one week, and I had a friend coincidentally who used to write, a guy named Marc Flanagan, and he was on the show as a staff guy. He called me up and said, &#x27;Did they call your agent?&#x27; I said, &#x27;No, why?&#x27; He said, &#x27;They wanna make you a regular.&#x27;&quot; McMurray, who did not become a full-fledged cast member until the sixth episode, did not find himself feeling terribly comfortable at first with the show. McMurray: &quot;[T]he social dynamic of the show is an odd one. I spoke with (executive producer) Jim Brooks about this later and I said, &#x27;You know, it&#x27;s like we&#x27;re all square pegs, aren&#x27;t we?&#x27; And he said, &#x27;Yeah,&#x27; and that the same thing occurred on &quot;The Mary Tyler Moore Show&quot;. Everybody was from a different discipline on that show, – somebody had been from sitcoms, somebody came from the stage, and somebody had been a stand-up comic, and yet whatever the dynamic that was forged from it, it&#x27;s singular and it works.&quot;

The last to be cast was dancer Joseph Malone. He was originally hired for a guest shot– acting as a cop who also danced with a possible jumper on a ledge, which led to him becoming a series regular. He had worked with Michael Jackson, Lily Tomlin, and Barbara Mandrell. The show now had its cast. During the 1987–1988 season (the show&#x27;s 2nd season), Julie Kavner asked to be let out of her contract to be able to concentrate on making movies; Kavner had been living in New York while &quot;The Tracey Ullman Show&quot; taped in Los Angeles. Actress Anna Levine was subsequently cast, with Kavner putting in special appearances. Though by the start of season 3, Kavner had returned to the cast permanently, with Levine staying on albeit in a diminished role.

===Writing===
James L. Brooks knew the importance of good writers, and quickly assembled a team for the show, most notably, Heide Perlman and Ken Estin of &quot;Cheers&quot; fame. Estin also worked on Brooks&#x27;s &quot;Taxi&quot;. The pair would also act as executive producers. Also joining the team was Jerry Belson; he also acted as executive producer. Belson had written for such television comedies as &quot;The Dick Van Dyke Show&quot;. Belson was the writer to whom Ullman warmed immediately; he was always in her corner. In an interview with &quot;The Nerdist Podcast&quot;, she recalled Belson saying, &quot;&#x27;Leave her alone, Jim, she&#x27;s tired.&#x27; [...] He was one of those funny writers [who] if you said that you didn&#x27;t like a joke in the room, he&#x27;d say, &#x27;What is this, Nazi, Russia?&#x27;&quot; When they won an Emmy, Belson&#x27;s response was, &quot;This is my first Emmy in color.&quot; Sam Simon, like Estin, wrote for &quot;Taxi&quot;, as well as executive produced the show. Brooks discovered writer Marc Flanagan after watching a piece performed by Meryl Streep and Kevin Klein at a benefit. He asked to speak to the writer and kept him in mind when he worked on the &quot;Ullman&quot; show as writer and producer. &quot;SCTV&quot; writers Dick Blasucci and Paul Flaherty wrote and co-produced as well.

For each show, a table read would take place on Monday mornings in the presence of writers and producers. Not unusually, rewrites could go past midnight. What worked in the writers room would sometimes fall flat once in the hands of the actors. The best readings were the result of numerous rewrites. &quot;I love cracking a run-through,&quot; said Ullman in 1989. &quot;It&#x27;s like a drug. If I can get them looking at me and respecting me, and thinking, &#x27;She&#x27;s done it!&#x27; – it&#x27;s the best feeling.&#x27;&quot; But she knew that the only performance that truly counted was the final one recorded in front of a live studio audience. &quot;You just gotta pray you hit that happy, energetic mood on Friday.&quot; The cast rehearsals would take place into lunch and dinner hours, usually under the tutelage of director Ted Bessell. Around 3:30 pm each day, writers and producers, led by Brooks and Belson, would arrive for a run-through. They would observe, shout out suggestions, make additions and subtractions, and work out any kinks in the production. The show would then be ready to tape by Friday at 7:00 pm. One &quot;writer&quot; frequently credited on the show, Bonita Carlisle, was actually a &quot;nom de plume&quot; chosen by the writers&#x27; room indicating that the sketch had been a group effort. Guest stars such as Steve Martin and Mel Brooks also got heavily involved in their sketch&#x27;s writing, as well.

While the Fox network was liberal when it came to the material it would allow the show to put on, by 1989, after controversy stemming from &quot;Married... with Children&quot;, the network&#x27;s standards and practices department began monitoring the scripts and kowtowing to advocating groups. A sketch consisting of a nun (played by Ullman), a priest, and last rites was pulled midproduction. Producers were given the option of either watering down the skit or not doing it at all. Ullman had no problem with the piece. Brooks responded: &quot;They&#x27;re smart enough to know that they can&#x27;t have a bland network that responds to every pressure and be successful ... If we really believe a piece should be broadcast, then we will take a stand. We do care about doing characters accurately and in them taking a comic view of life, but when censorship interferes with that, we&#x27;ve got to scream.&quot;

===Format===
A typical episode of &quot;The Tracey Ullman Show&quot; consists of two or three sketches (or ) featuring Tracey Ullman playing an array of characters, along with her supporting cast of Julie Kavner, Dan Castellaneta, Sam McMurray, Joseph Malone, and in season three, Anna Levine. The final sketch of the night usually includes a musical or dance number featuring Ullman either solo or with other members of the cast. Paula Abdul was responsible for choreographing all of the show&#x27;s dance routines. Interstitial cartoon shorts (&quot;Dr. N!Godatu&quot;, &quot;The Simpsons&quot;) were featured before and after each commercial break.

The show&#x27;s producers toyed with the format during the show&#x27;s first season. A variety act was added and then scrapped by the third episode. Ullman began opening the show as herself by episode five; this was dropped altogether by season three in favor of an elaborate opening title sequence.

The final segment of all four seasons has Ullman, clad in a pink robe, delivering a closing monologue to the studio audience before ending the show with her signature catchphrase, &quot;Go home! Go home!&quot; and dancing as the credits roll. She chose the phrase &quot;Go home,&quot; because she could not think of anything clever for the ending. Her closing monologue is, &quot;Oh, you got sore bums. Go home!&quot;

===Opening title sequence===
George Clinton was hired to write and perform the show&#x27;s funk-infused theme song, &quot;You&#x27;re Thinking Right&quot;. Brooks hired animation and graphic-design company Klasky Csupo to design the show&#x27;s title sequence. It would become the studio&#x27;s big break. In addition to handing the show&#x27;s opening, they also produced the show&#x27;s animated bumpers. The opening title sequence in seasons one and two followed a brief introduction by Ullman to the studio audience. For season three, however, the opening was scrapped, and in its place, a live-action farce was used; Ullman pulls up to the 20th Century Fox lot in her car and hits a pedestrian. She attempts CPR in front of onlookers and revives her victim. She then rushes into the studio and meets George Clinton; a person tries to get her opinion on a costume; Paula Abdul attempts to go over choreography with her. Next, she visits the makeup room and greets her fellow castmates – this includes the Simpson family. She then looks at a pushpin board, and stills of that week&#x27;s sketches are posted. Season four featured a title sequence similar to the first two seasons.

===Ending===
After four seasons, Ullman decided to end the show, stating that she was &quot;constantly challenged and happily tortured by a unique group of people.&quot; She also thanked Fox &quot;for letting somebody no one ever heard of do a show on a network that didn&#x27;t exist.&quot; Brooks stated that &quot;The Tracey Ullman Show&quot; was &quot;the hardest work any of us ever did, and we would have continued forever if she had wanted us to [...] I&#x27;m just glad I appreciated it as it was happening and not just in retrospect ... Tracey is one of the most talented people alive.&quot; The show earned Fox its first Emmy Award, racking up a total of 13 nominations, and garnering four wins, by the end of its run.

Brooks did not mince words when Fox chairman Barry Diller was announced to be stepping down in 1992. &quot;I thought &quot;The Tracey Ullman Show&quot; should have stayed on as long as she wanted to do it.&quot; Diller had been dragging his feet in renewing the show. Tired of waiting, Ullman decided to pull the plug herself. When Ullman and the show won at the 1990 Emmy Awards, &quot;The Los Angeles Times&quot; remarked, &quot;Tracey Ullman gets last laugh.&quot; Later, Ullman admitted that she would have liked an additional year to try out all the characters she wanted to play. She was proud, though, of what they achieved: &quot;no compromises, no giving up, always wanting the best.&quot;

==Recurring characters==

Over the course of four seasons, Tracey Ullman played upwards of 100 characters; some were repeated, but not on a weekly basis. The show&#x27;s supporting cast also had their own characters, usually playing opposite Ullman&#x27;s, but sometimes in sketches solo. The following is a list of recurring characters performed by Tracey Ullman, Dan Castellaneta, Julie Kavner, and Sam McMurray. They are listed in order of appearance.

==Animated segments==
&quot;The Tracey Ullman Show&quot; regularly featured short animated cartoons as interstitials in the first three seasons.

===&quot;Dr. N!Godatu&quot;===
&quot;Dr. N!Godatu&quot; was a series of animated shorts created by M.K. Brown, and animated by Klasky-Csupo. It was seen during season one only, and was the first cartoon seen on Ullman&#x27;s show. The shorts followed the somewhat surreal life of Dr. Janice N!Godatu, who calmly and cheerfully addressed the camera as she detailed her latest misadventure. The character was voiced by Julie Payne.

The feature appeared in the first two &quot;Ullman&quot; episodes, then alternated more-or-less every other week with the &quot;Simpsons&quot; shorts (see below). After appearing six times, &quot;Dr. N!Godatu&quot; was dropped at the conclusion of the first season. Two additional &quot;Dr. N!Godatu&quot; cartoons that were prepared for the show never aired.

===&quot;The Simpsons&quot;===
The Simpson family debuted in short animated cartoons on &quot;The Tracey Ullman Show&quot;, beginning with episode three of the first season. The shorts originally were presented on an occasional basis, alternating episodes with &quot;Dr. N!Godatu&quot;, but the reaction to the Simpsons shorts was very positive, and after appearing seven times during season one, the feature was quickly promoted to full-time status, appearing in every episode of seasons two and three, before being spun off into a half-hour series. These shorts, also called &quot;bumpers&quot;, aired before and after commercial breaks during the first and second seasons of the show. They eventually had their own full segments between the live-action segments during season three. Except for a repeat airing of the short &quot;Simpson Xmas&quot;, they did not appear in the fourth and final season of &quot;The Tracey Ullman Show&quot;, as they had their own half-hour TV series by then.

All of them were written by Matt Groening and animated at Klasky Csupo by a team of animators consisting of David Silverman, Wes Archer, and Bill Kopp. &quot;Tracey Ullman Show&quot; cast members Dan Castellaneta and Julie Kavner provided the voices of Homer and Marge Simpson, respectively. In the beginning, the drawings appeared very crude because the animators were more or less just tracing over Groening&#x27;s storyboards, but as the series developed, so did the designs and layouts of the characters and the &quot;Simpsons drawing style&quot; was ultimately conceived. At first, they just established the basics; clothes, hair, distinctive features etc. This style evolved even more throughout the first few seasons of &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, and was used more than a decade later on &quot;Futurama&quot;, and &quot;Disenchantment&quot;, other animated series created by Groening.

==Reception==
===Critical response===
While the show was a critical darling, it was never a ratings juggernaut; although none of the early newly launched primetime Fox network shows generated a significant return (Fox did not crack the top 30 in the Nielsen ratings until 1990 with &quot;The Simpsons&quot;). On the show&#x27;s ratings, Fox president Jamie Kellner was quoted in 1988 as saying, &quot;We&#x27;re too new new to be discouraged by ratings [...] It&#x27;s true that it&#x27;s harder to discover Tracey on Fox than on NBC.&quot; As critic Howard Rosenberg of &quot;The Los Angeles Times&quot; and &quot;The Washington Post&quot; pointed out, though, it was probably easier for her to survive, as the show she was producing was probably too &quot;rule-bending&quot; for NBC to be interested in, in the first place.

The show faced practical obstacles reaching viewers, one of which was the network broadcasting via UHF signal in many areas. Ullman was personally critical of Fox messing with the show&#x27;s timeslot, something network chairman Barry Diller later conceded. &quot;I think there was real anger about the shifting time a lot, and that it was legitimate. Networks do many things that are not necessarily in the interests of a particular show, and those things are not always smart. We had a very large audience for a very special show-but it wasn&#x27;t large enough. Certain things take time. As the world speeds up, the rhythm of this show will become consistent with the rhythm of the audience. But it might take 10 years. I think the 80-something shows they did will be like &quot;The Honeymooners&quot;. I don&#x27;t know when. But it&#x27;s going to be pure, driven gold. We expect to get every nickel back. Plus, plus, plus.&quot; &quot;It should&#x27;ve been on Sunday night. I think a great lineup would&#x27;ve been &quot;The Simpsons&quot; followed by Tracey, on Sunday night.&quot;, said Matt Groening in 1991. Despite its issues in the ratings, the show retained a devoted fan base and became a cult hit up until the end. It also helped the Fox network gain credibility within the industry. &quot;Married... with Children&quot;, the series that launched the same night as the &quot;Ullman&quot; show, was mired in controversy and soon became branded low-brow humor.

===Accolades===

The show won a total of 10 Primetime Emmy Awards including Outstanding Variety, Music or Comedy Program in 1989 and 1990, and Outstanding Individual Performance in a Variety or Music Program in 1990. Also in 1989, choreographer Paula Abdul won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Choreography for her work on the show.

==Distribution==
===International===
When &quot;The Tracey Ullman Show&quot; first appeared in Ullman&#x27;s native England, the BBC broadcast the series unedited for the first seven episodes. After a gap, it was decided to cut six minutes from the show, specifically the Simpsons shorts. &quot;The BBC said the only thing they didn&#x27;t like about the show was those weird little animated characters and suggested maybe they could get rid of them because they would never catch on,&quot; recalled Ullman. Despite their aversion to the cartoon shorts, she attempted to convince the broadcaster to buy the rights to &quot;The Simpsons&quot; television series, telling them it would be a mistake not to; Sky ended up buying the show. When the last batch of episodes were screened in 1991 the series was given a 25mins slot and thus broadcast in full, &quot;The Tracey Ullman Show&quot; aired on BBC Two in the UK, Network 10 in Australia and TVNZ in New Zealand.

===Syndication===
Reruns of the show appeared on Lifetime and Comedy Central throughout the 1990s in the United States.

==Home media==
, &quot;The Tracey Ullman Show&quot; has never been commercially released through any home media platform. In an interview from 2017, Tracey Ullman theorized that music clearance issues may be the reason for this. A selection of the Simpsons shorts was released from 1997 through 1999 on &quot;The Simpsons&quot; VHS home video releases. The first Simpsons short called &quot;Good Night&quot; was included as a special feature on &quot;The Simpsons: The Complete First Season&quot; DVD box set released on September 25, 2001. The sketch &quot;Due Diligence&quot; featuring actor-comedian Mel Brooks was released as an extra on &quot;The Incredible Mel Brooks: An Irresistible Collection of Unhinged Comedy&quot; DVD in 2012.

<text>Barbara Bluestein Simons (born January 26, 1941) is an American computer scientist and the former president of the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM). She is a Ph.D. graduate of the University of California, Berkeley and spent her early career working as an IBM researcher. She is the founder and former co-chair of USACM, the ACM U.S. Public Policy Council. Her main areas of research are compiler optimization, scheduling theory and algorithm analysis and design.

Simons has worked for technology regulation since 2002, where she advocates for the end of electronic voting. She subsequently serves as the chairperson of the Verified Voting Foundation and coauthored a book on the flaws of electronic voting entitled &quot;Broken Ballots,&quot; with Douglas W. Jones.

== Early life ==
Simons was born in Boston, Massachusetts and grew up in Cincinnati, Ohio. In high school, she developed an interest for math and science while taking A.P. Math classes. She attended Wellesley College for a year, before moving to California in 1959 to resume her undergraduate education at Berkeley. There, she married James Harris Simons. At the beginning of her junior year she gave birth to a daughter, Liz, and dropped out of Berkeley shortly thereafter to become a mother and a housewife. In this time she decided to pursue a profession in Computer Programming, and began taking computer science classes part-time, before enrolling in graduate school at Stony Brook University. After a year of graduate school there, she and James Harris Simons divorced in 1974.

Simons transferred back to Berkeley for the remainder of graduate school, where she concentrated on studying scheduling theory and helped co-found the Women in Computer Science and Engineering club (WiCSE). In 1981, she received her Ph.D. in Computer Science. She received a Distinguished Engineering Alumni Award from Berkeley&#x27;s College of Engineering.

==Career==
1981-1998: IBM

After leaving the Berkeley in 1981, Simons began her career at Research Division of IBM in their Research Division in San Jose. There, she worked on compiler optimization, algorithm analysis, and clock synchronization, which she won an IBM Research Division Award for. In 1992, she began working as a senior programmer in IBM&#x27;s Applications Development Technology Institute and subsequently as a senior technology adviser for IBM Global Services.

Over the course of her career at IBM, her interests shifted from research to the policy and regulation of technology. She took early retirement from IBM in 1998 after spending 17 years with the company.

1993-2002: ACM

After leaving IBM in 1998, Simons served as president of the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM), the largest computing society in the world, until 2000. She joined ACM when her career focus shifted from computing research to the politics of technology legislation. Prior to becoming the ACM president, Simons founded ACM&#x27;s US Public Policy Committee (USACM) in 1993. She co-chaired this committee along with the ACM Committee for Scientific Freedom and Human Rights for 9 years. As president, she co-chaired the ACM study of statewide databases of voters in 1999 under President Clinton, called Voter Registration Databases 2000–2002. In 1999 she was elected secretary of the Council of Scientific Society Presidents (CSSP) as ACM President. In 2001 after her time as president, she received ACM&#x27;s Outstanding Contribution Award. She is still a Fellow of ACM and the American Association for the Advancement of Science.

2008–Present: The Verified Voting Foundation

Since 2008, Simons has served on the board of directors of the Verified Voting Foundation, a non-partisan and non-profit organization that advocates for legislation to promote the safest and most transparent voting. The group&#x27;s goals are to ensure that states and municipalities across America adopt voting technology best practices.

=== Other work ===
Simons helped found the Reentry Program for Women and Minorities at U.C. Berkeley in the Computer Science Department. She also serves on the boards of the Coalition to Diversify Computing (CDC) and the Berkeley Foundation for Opportunities in Information Technology (BFOIT), both which promote minorities to learn and work in computing.

In 2005 Simons became the first woman ever to receive the Distinguished Engineering Alumni Award from the U.C. Berkeley&#x27;s College of Engineering.

She is a member of the board of directors at the U.C. Berkeley Engineering Fund, the Electronic Privacy Information Center, and sits on the Advisory Boards of the Oxford Internet Institute.

==Voting technology policy==

After leaving IBM and serving as ACM president, Simons began working to reverse the dangers of using unverifiable technology in voting. In 2001 she participated in the National Workshop on Internet Voting under President Clinton, where she helped produce a report on Internet voting. She subsequently served on the President&#x27;s Export Council&#x27;s Subcommittee on Encryption, as well as on the Information Technology-Sector of the President&#x27;s Council on the Year 2000 Conversion. Barbara held one of her first public outcries of unverifiable voting technology in 2003 because election officials in Silicon Valley wanted to switch to paperless machines. Now, Barbara serves as a board chair at Verified Voting. She also co-chaired the ACM study of statewide databases of registered voters alongside Paula Hawthorn. She participated on the Security Peer Review Group for the US Department of Defense’s Internet voting project (SERVE) and co-authored the report that led to the cancellation of SERVE because of security concerns 2004.

In addition to serving on the Board of Directors of the Verified Voting Foundation, Simons has worked for legislation to remove paperless voting machines and published various work about it. She played a key role in changing the League of Women Voters support and use of paperless voting. Initially the League had seen electronic voting as better for disabled people, then endorsed voting machines that are &quot;recountable&quot; after Simons. In 2008 she was appointed by Senator Harry Reid to the U.S Election Assistance Commission Board of Advisors, where she contributed to &quot;Help America Vote Act&quot; (HAVA). In 2009 she co-authored the League of Women Voters report on election auditing. With fellow computer scientist Douglas Jones, she co-authored a book about electronic voting machines in 2012, titled &quot;Broken Ballots: Will Your Vote Count?&quot;. Following this, in July 2015 she published another report about electronic voting for the U.S. Vote Foundation entitled &quot;The Future of Voting: End-to-End Verifiable Internet Voting&quot;.

<doc id="920820" wikidata="Q1342654" url="?curid=920820" title="List of German divisions in World War II">
<text>This article lists divisions of the Wehrmacht (German Armed Forces) and Waffen-SS active during World War II, including divisions of the Heer (army), Luftwaffe (air force), and the Kriegsmarine (navy).

Upgrades and reorganizations are shown only to identify the variant names for what is notionally a single unit; other upgrades and reorganizations are deferred to the individual articles. Due to the scope of this list, pre-war changes are not shown. Most of these divisions trained in Berlin, which is also where new military technology was kept and tested.
==German unit designations==
These designations are normally not translated and used in the German form in the unit name or description.
==Army (Heer)==

===Panzer divisions===
====Numbered panzer divisions====

====Named panzer divisions====

====Light mechanized divisions====

The designation &quot;Light&quot; (&quot;leichte in German&quot;) had various meanings in the German Army of World War II. There were a series of 5 Light divisions; the first four were pre-war mechanized formations organized for use as mechanized cavalry, and the fifth was an &quot;ad hoc&quot; collection of mechanized elements rushed to Africa to help the Italians and organized into a division once there. All five were eventually converted to ordinary Panzer divisions.

Various other divisions were dubbed &quot;Light&quot; for other reasons, and are listed among the Infantry Series Divisions (see below ↓).

==Infantry series divisions==
The backbone of the &quot;Heer&quot; was the infantry division. Of the 154 divisions deployed against the Soviet Union in 1941, including reserves, there were 100 infantry, 19 panzer, 11 motorized, 9 security, 5 &quot;Waffen-SS&quot;, 4 &quot;light&quot;, 4 mountain, 1 SS-police, and 1 cavalry. A typical infantry division in June 1941 had 17,734 men organized into the following sub-units: 
*three infantry regiments with staff and communications units 
**three battalions with: 
***three infantry companies
***one heavy weapons company
**one anti-tank company (mot.) 
**one artillery company
**one reconnaissance unit 
*one tank destroyer battalion with: 
**three companies (each with twelve 3.7 cm guns) 
*one artillery regiment 
**three battalions
***three batteries
*one pioneer battalion 
*one communications unit 
*one field replacement battalion 
*Supply, medical, veterinary, mail, and police

Infantry divisions were raised in &quot;waves&quot; (&quot;Aufstellungswelle&quot;), sets of divisions with a standardized table of organization and equipment. In general the later waves (i.e., the higher-numbered divisions) were of lower quality than the earlier ones.

===Numbered divisions===
Divisions are listed by number and reflect their lineage where names or designations were changed over time.

==== 1st to 99th ====

==== 100th to 199th ====

==== 201st to 299th ====

==== 300th to 999th ====

===Named divisions===

=== Landwehr divisions ===

=== Mountain divisions ===

===Ski division===

* 1st Ski Division (previously 1st Ski Brigade)

===Cavalry divisions===

According to Davies, the &quot;Cavalry&quot; divisions were mounted infantry and the &quot;Cossack&quot; divisions were &quot;true cavalry&quot;, modelled on the Russian cavalry divisions.

===Artillery divisions===

===Named fortress divisions===

===Named training divisions===

===RAD divisions===

In 1945 the Reichsarbeitsdienst (Reich Labour Service) transferred personnel to the army to form new divisions as part of the 35th Aufstellungswelle, the last of the war.

===Field replacement divisions===

==Navy (Kriegsmarine)==
===Marine divisions===

==Air Force (Luftwaffe)==
===Hermann Göring divisions===

The Hermann Göring formations grew from a single police detachment to an entire armored corps over the course of the war. The later epithet &quot;Fallschirm&quot; (&quot;parachute&quot;) was purely honorific.

===Airborne divisions===

To keep its existence secret, the first German airborne division was named as if a &quot;Flieger&quot; (&quot;flier&quot;) division in the series of &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; divisions that controlled air assets rather than ground troops-named 7th &quot;Flieger&quot; Division (often translated &quot;7th Air Division&quot; - which see: 1st Parachute Division (Germany)) The division was later reorganized to start a series of nominally airborne divisions. Though named (&quot;paratrooper&quot;) divisions, only some of them participated in airdrops in the early part of the war. Whilst the first five divisions received full paratrooper training, the remaining divisions did not and in practice operated as ordinary infantry throughout their existence. The lower-numbered ones earned and maintained an elite status, but quality generally declined among the higher-numbered divisions.

===Field divisions===

Luftwaffe Field Divisions were ordinary infantry divisions organized from &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; personnel made available after mid-war due to problems with manpower. They were originally &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; units but were later handed over to the &quot;Heer&quot;, retaining their numbering but with &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; attached to distinguish them from similarly numbered divisions already existing in the &quot;Heer&quot;.

===Training divisions===

===Anti-Aircraft divisions===

These were headquarters for controlling aggregates of &quot;flak&quot; (&quot;anti-aircraft artillery&quot;) assets rather than ordinary combined arms divisions organized for ground combat.

==Waffen-SS (Schutzstaffel)==
All divisions in the &quot;Waffen-SS&quot; were ordered in a single series up to 38th, regardless of type. Those tagged with nationalities were at least nominally recruited from those nationalities. Many of the higher-numbered units were small battle groups (Kampfgruppen), i.e. divisions in name only.

Also Panzer Division &quot;Kempf&quot;, a temporary unit of mixed &quot;Heer&quot; and &quot;Waffen-SS&quot; components.

<doc id="920843" wikidata="Q3948" url="?curid=920843" title="Brits, South Africa">
<text>Brits () is a town in the North West Province of South Africa. It is situated in a fertile citrus, vegetable and grain-producing area that is irrigated by the waters of the Hartbeespoort Dam. It is close to the City of Tshwane Metropolitan Municipality in Gauteng, which includes Pretoria, and it has the same dialling code as Pretoria. In addition to being a centre for agriculture, the city is home to several heavy industries. A factory of the Italian car manufacturer Alfa Romeo produced cars for the domestic market and export to Asia from 1974 to 1985. The city also plays an important role in the South African mining industry: 94% of South Africa&#x27;s platinum comes from the Rustenburg and Brits districts, which together produce more platinum than any other single area in the world. In addition, there is a large vanadium mine in the district.

Mothotlung, Letlhabile, Maboloka, Bapong, Majakaneng, Tornado, Bethanie and Oukasie are the black townships, with Oukasie founded in 1931 being one of the oldest townships in South Africa.The Indian area in Brits is &quot;Primindia&quot;. Brits is part of the Madibeng Local Municipality.

Brits is linked to Sandton by the R511 and to Randburg by the R512, and to Pretoria by the R513, R514 &amp; R566. Freeway access is by the N4 Highway (Bakwena Toll Route), which was constructed in the early 2000s.

==History==
The first European to build a pioneer hut in the area was Albertus Venter circa 1840. He settled down with his wife and daughter on the farm which is today known as &quot;De Kroon&quot; and started farming. The Fourie family soon joined him and on 13 June 1846 the first white baby was born in this area north of the Magaliesberg. Phillipus Fourie eventually bought the farm from Venter and he put up the first permanent homestead that became known as the &quot;Ou Werf&quot;.

The railway station called Brits was opened on 9 July 1906 and residents began putting up small businesses on the southern side of it. The station was built on the property of Johan Nicolaas Brits that owned part of the farm &quot;Roodekopjes&quot;. He was previously the first owner of the farm Bloemfontein which he sold to Capt. Warden. In 1918 a steam driven roller mill was built west of the station and served the farming community for many decades. Mail now arrived by train and it became the station master&#x27;s job to sort out the people&#x27;s mail. The first post office was built on the station in 1915, and the first post master was Haydon Thomas. It was in this little building that the first telephone was installed and it was operated by Miss Theron. The first police station was established in 1921 and Sergeant Prinsloo was the first station commander.

A little village began to develop around the main road on the southern side of the station, which later became known as Tom Street. Unfortunately no proper city planning was done and this area had no access to running water. A businessman by the name of Louis Karovsky, bought the part of Hendrik Christiaan Brits&#x27; farm to the north of the rail road. This section was cut up into 940 stands and legally proclaimed as a township in October 1923. The area south of the railway station eventually become the Indian area of Primindia, with Tom Street as its primary business node. Brits was founded in 1924 on the farm &quot;Roode Kopjes&quot; (Red Hills) and was named after the owner, Johannes Nicolaas Brits. The armistice treaty for the Transvaal civil war was signed in 1864 beneath a karee tree just to the south of Brits. A speech by General Hertzog in 1912 at the nearby De Wildt railway station led to the formation of the National Party.
==Animals==
The De Wildt Cheetah and Wildlife Centre, renowned for its success in breeding and studying cheetah, king cheetah, brown hyena, suni, blue duiker and wild dogs is situated in the small town of De Wildt, just east of Brits.

Ukutula Lodge and conservation center is also based in Brits. Ukutula is home to a number of wild cat species and is a registered Wildlife Breeding and trading facility, as well as an animal rescue center.

Brits is also the birthplace of the first cloned animal in Africa, a cow.

==Transport==
Brits Airfield is located a few miles north of the city. Communities from surrounding villages and townships make use of taxis, buses, private cars as well as bicycles as modes of transport to move from one point to another.

==Notable people==
* Katlego Mphela (born 1984), footballer
* Bobby van Jaarsveld, singer and actor
*Corrie Sanders, boxer, former world champion

<text>A deck is a permanent covering over a compartment or a hull of a ship. On a boat or ship, the primary or upper deck is the horizontal structure that forms the &quot;roof&quot; of the hull, strengthening it and serving as the primary working surface. Vessels often have more than one level both within the hull and in the superstructure above the primary deck, similar to the floors of a multi-storey building, that are also referred to as decks, as are certain compartments and decks built over specific areas of the superstructure. Decks for some purposes have specific names.

==Structure==
The main purpose of the upper or primary deck is structural, and only secondarily to provide weather-tightness and support people and equipment. The deck serves as the lid to the complex box girder which can be identified as the hull. It resists tension, compression, and racking forces. The deck&#x27;s scantling is usually the same as the topsides, or might be heavier if the deck is expected to carry heavier loads (for example a container ship). The deck will be reinforced around deck fittings such as the capstan, cleats, or bollards.

On ships with more than one level, &#x27;deck&#x27; refers to the level itself. The actual floor surface is called the sole; the term &#x27;deck&#x27; refers to a structural member tying the ship&#x27;s frames or ribs together over the keel. In modern ships, the interior decks are usually numbered from the primary deck, which is #1, downward and upward. So the first deck below the primary deck will be #2, and the first above the primary deck will be #A2 or #S2 (for &quot;above&quot; or &quot;superstructure&quot;). Some merchant ships may alternatively designate decks below the primary deck, usually machinery spaces, by numbers, and those above it, in the accommodation block, by letters. Ships may also call decks by common names, or (especially on cruise ships) may invent fanciful and romantic names for a specific deck or area of that specific ship, such as the &quot;lido deck&quot; of the Princess Cruises&#x27; &quot;Love Boat&quot;.

Equipment mounted on deck, such as the ship&#x27;s wheel, binnacle, fife rails, and so forth, may be collectively referred to as deck furniture. Weather decks in Western designs evolved from having structures fore (forward or front) and aft (rear) of the ship mostly clear; in the 19th century, pilothouses/wheelhouses and deckhouses began to appear, eventually developing into the superstructure of modern ships. Eastern designs developed earlier, with efficient middle decks and minimalist fore and aft cabin structures across a range of designs.

== Common names for decks ==

In vessels having more than one deck there are various naming conventions, numerically, alphabetically, etc. However, there are also various common historical names and types of decks:

* 01 level is the term used in naval services to refer to the deck above the main deck. The next higher decks are referred to as the 02 level, the 03 level, and so on. Although these are formally called decks, they are usually referred to as levels, because they are usually incomplete decks that do not extend all the way from the stem to the stern or across the ship.
*Afterdeck an open deck area toward the stern-aft. 
* Berth deck: (&quot;naval&quot;) A deck next below the gun deck, where the hammocks of the crew are slung.
* Boat deck: Especially on ships with sponsons, the deck area where lifeboats or the ship&#x27;s gig are stored. 
* Boiler deck: (river steamers) The passenger deck above the vessel&#x27;s boilers. 
* Bridge deck: (a) The deck area including the helm and navigation station, and where the Officer of the Deck/Watch will be found, also known as the &quot;conn&quot;. (b) An athwartships structure at the forward end of the cockpit with a deck, often somewhat lower than the primary deck, to prevent a pooping wave (a wave which comes over the stern and onto the deck) from entering through the companionway. May also refer to the deck of a bridge. 
* Flight deck: (&quot;naval&quot;) A deck from which aircraft take off or land. 
* Flush deck: Any continuous unbroken deck from stem to stern. 
* Forecastle deck: A partial deck above the main deck under which the sailors have their berths, extending from the foremast to the bow. 
* Freeboard deck: assigned by a classification society to determine the ship&#x27;s freeboard; usually the highest continuous deck, i.e. equivalent to the main deck. 
* Gun deck: (&quot;naval&quot;) on a multi-decked vessel, a deck below the upper deck where the ships&#x27; cannon were carried. The term originally referred to deck for which the primary function was the mounting of cannon to be fired in broadsides. However, on many smaller and unrated vessels the upper deck, forecastle and quarterdeck bore all of the cannons but were not referred to as the gun deck. 
* Hangar deck: (&quot;naval&quot;) A deck aboard an aircraft carrier used to store and maintain aircraft. 
* Half-deck: That portion of the deck next below the forecastle or quarterdeck which is between the mainmast and the cabin. 
* Helicopter deck (heli or helo deck): Usually located near the stern and always kept clear of obstacles hazardous to a helicopter landing. 
* Hurricane deck: (&quot;river steamers, etc.&quot;) the upper deck, usually a light deck, erected above the frame of the hull (deriving its name from the wind that always seemed to blow on the deck). 
* Lido deck: Open area, typically at or near the stern of a passenger ship, housing the main outdoor swimming pool and sunbathing area. 
* Lower deck: (a) the deck immediately over the hold, originally only of a ship with two decks. (b) synonym for berth deck. (c) alternative name for a secondary gun deck. 
* Main deck: The principal deck of a vessel; in some ships the highest deck of the hull, usually but not always the weather deck; in sailing warships often a deck under the upper deck. 
* Middle or waist deck: The upper deck amidships, the working area of the deck. 
* Orlop deck: The deck or part of a deck where the cables are stowed, usually below the waterline. It is the lowest deck in a ship. 
* Poop deck: The deck forming the roof of a poop or poop cabin, built on the upper deck and extending from the mizzenmast aft. 
* Promenade deck: A &quot;wrap-around porch&quot; found on passenger ships and riverboats encircling the superstructure. This can have open railings or be enclosed in glass, or a combination. Often the entire level where this is located is referred to as the promenade deck. 
* Quarterdeck: (a) The part of the upper deck abaft the mainmast, including the poop deck when there is one. Usually reserved for ship&#x27;s officers, guests, and passengers. (b) (&quot;naval&quot;) The shipboard area, connected by a gangplank to a dock or another ship, where personnel arrive and depart a naval vessel in port. It is where the Officer of the Deck and his assistants are stationed, official visitors received, and personnel arrival/departure ceremonies conducted. In the event of multiple gangplanks, only one will lead to the official Quarterdeck; the others will be manned by Junior OODs or a Petty Officer of the Watch. The Quarterdeck also functions as an administrative point in port, where the ship&#x27;s log is maintained, announcements are made via an electronic public address system (called the &quot;1MC&quot; on American navy and coast guard ships, and the &quot;Tannoy&quot; on others), the ship&#x27;s bell rung, etc. (c) (&quot;naval&quot;) Some ships have a space named &quot;quarterdeck&quot;, usually amidships, that normally, but situationally may not, be used for that purpose. 
*Shelter deck: A lightly constructed deck over the main deck of a ship covering a space open to the weather; offering some protection from the weather but not completely enclosed. 
* Side-deck: The upper deck outboard of any structures such as a coachroof or doghouse, also called a breezeway. 
* Spar deck: In larger vessels during the age of sail, spare spars could be roped together to provide a temporary surface known as a &quot;spar deck&quot;. These served as jury-rigged repairs for permanent decks, or as an additional platform under which to shelter goods or crew. The term was also informally applied to areas of the forecastle or quarterdeck where spare spars were stored by laying them flat against the existing decking. In the modern era the term has been used to describe the uppermost deck on flush decked vessels. On Great Lakes bulk freighters this is the term used for the deck over the cargo holds.
* Steerage: The lower deck of a ship, where the cargo is stored above the closed hold. In the late 19th and early 20th century, steamship steerage decks were used to provide the lowest cost and lowest class of travel. 
* Sundeck: A deck onboard passenger watercraft used for suntanning. 
* Sweep deck: (&quot;naval&quot;) The aftmost deck on a minesweeper, set close to the waterline for ease in launch and recovery of equipment.
* Topgallant forecastle deck: Any raised deck occurring above the forecastle deck (see above). 
* Tween deck: the storage space between the hold and the main deck, often retractable. 
* Upper deck: The highest deck of the hull, extending from stem to stern. 
* Vehicle deck: (&quot;naval&quot;) aboard amphibious assault ships the deck or decks used to carry vehicles, aboard civilian ferries and other commercial vessels a deck used for a similar purpose. 
* Weather deck: (a) Any deck exposed to the outside. (b) The windward side-decks. 
* Well deck: (a) An exposed deck (weather deck) lower than decks fore and aft. In particular it is one enclosed by bulwarks limiting flow of water and thus drainage. (b) (&quot;modern naval&quot;) A hangar-like deck located at the waterline in the stern of some amphibious assault ships, also known as a well dock. By taking on water the ship can lower the stern, flooding the well deck and allowing boats and landing craft to dock within the ship.

== Construction ==

=== Methods in wood ===

A traditional wood deck would consist of planks laid fore and aft over beams and along carlins, the seams of which are caulked and paid with tar. A yacht or other fancy boat might then have the deck canvased, with the fabric laid down in a thick layer of paint or sealant, and additional coats painted over. The wash or apron boards form the joint between the deck planking and that of the topsides, and are caulked similarly.

Modern &quot;constructed decks&quot; are used primarily on fiberglass, composite, and cold-molded hulls. The under structure of beams and carlins is the same as above. The decking itself is usually multiple layers of marine-grade plywood, covered over with layers of fibreglass in a plastic resin such as epoxy or polyester overlapped onto the topsides of the hull.

=== Methods in metal ===

Generally speaking, the method outlined for &quot;constructed decks&quot; is most similar to metal decks. The deck plating is laid over metal beams and carlins and tacked temporarily in place. The difficulty in metal construction is avoiding distortion of the plate while welding due to the high heat involved in the process. Welds are usually double pass, meaning each seam is welded twice, a time-consuming process which may take longer than building the wood deck. However, welds result in a waterproof deck which is strong and easily repairable. The deck structure is welded to the hull, making it structurally a single unit.

Because a metal deck, painted to reduce corrosion, can pick up heat from the sun, and be quite slippery and noisy to work on, a layer of wood decking or thick non-skid paint is often applied to its surface.

=== Methods in fiberglass ===

The process for building a deck in fiberglass is the same as for building a hull: a female mould is built, a layer of gel coat is sprayed in, then layers of fiberglass in resin are built up to the required deck thickness (if the deck has a core, the outer skin layers of fiberglass and resin are laid, then the core material, and finally the inner skin layers). The deck is removed from the mould and usually mechanically fastened to the hull.

Fiberglass decks are quite slick with their mirror-smooth surfaces, so a non-skid texture is often moulded into their surface, or non-skid pads glued down in working areas.

To make the decks of modern yachts more natural, teak wood decking is primarily used.

=== Rules of thumb to determine the deck scantlings ===

The thickness of the decking affects how strong the hull is, and is directly related to how thick the skin of the hull itself is, which is of course related to how large the vessel is, the kind of work it is expected to do, and the kind of weather it may reasonably be expected to endure. While a naval engineer or architect may have precise methods of determining what the scantlings should be, traditional builders used previous experiences and simpler rules-of-thumb to determine how thick the deck should be built.

The numbers derived by these formulae gives a rough number for determining the average thickness of materials based on some crude hull measurements. Below the waterline the thickness should be approximately 115% of the result, while upper topsides and decks might be reduced to 85% of the result.

* In wood – For plank thickness in inches, LOA (Length OverAll) and Beam are measured in feet. For plank thickness in mm, LOA and beam are measured in meters.
**Plank thickness in inchesformula_1
**Plank thickness in mmformula_2
* In fiberglass – For skin thickness in inches, LWL (Length WaterLine) is in feet. For skin thickness in mm, LWL is in meters.
**Skin thickness (inches)formula_3
**Skin thickness (mm)formula_4
* In fiberglass sandwich – First determine the skin thickness as single skin, then multiply by modifiers for inner skin, outer skin, and core thicknesses. Cored decks might be modified even thicker, 2.6–2.7, to increase stiffness.
** Inner skin modifier = 0.3
** Outer skin modifier = 0.4
** Core modifier = 2.2

== Deck covering of modern yachts ==

=== Teak wood ===

Teak wood is a popular choice for modern yacht decking due to its natural durability, water resistance, and aesthetic appeal. Known for its ability to withstand harsh marine environments, teak requires relatively simple maintenance while providing a classic, luxurious look. Its natural oils make it resistant to rot, pests, and UV damage, and over time, it develops a silver-gray patina. Teak decks are also non-slip when wet, making them practical for safety in marine settings. Despite its advantages, teak can be expensive and requires regular cleaning to maintain its appearance.

=== Alternative covers / Plastic teak imitation===

Alternative yacht deck materials have grown in popularity due to their affordability, lower maintenance, and environmental benefits compared to traditional teak. Some common alternatives include:

- Synthetic Teak: Made from PVC or other polymers, synthetic teak mimics the look of real teak but requires much less maintenance. It is resistant to UV rays, stains, and water damage, making it durable for marine use.

- Cork: Lightweight and eco-friendly, cork is naturally non-slip, resistant to water, and comfortable to walk on. It is also an excellent thermal and sound insulator.

- Bamboo: An increasingly popular option due to its sustainability. Bamboo is durable and environmentally friendly but requires proper treatment to ensure resistance to moisture and rot.

- Eva foam: Common on racing yachts, these materials are practical, lightweight, and easy to implement. They provide excellent grip but may not have the same aesthetic appeal as wood or wood-like alternatives.

<text>The Common Business Communication Language (CBCL) is a communications language proposed by John McCarthy that foreshadowed much of XML. The language consists of a basic framework of hierarchical markup derived from S-expressions, coupled with some general principles about use and extensibility. Although written in 1975, the proposal was not published until 1982, and to this day remains relatively obscure.

<text>The SSS islands (), locally also known as the Windward Islands ( or ), is a collective term for the three territories of the Dutch Caribbean (formerly the Netherlands Antilles) that are located within the Leeward Islands group of the Lesser Antilles in the Caribbean Sea. In order of population size, they are: Sint Maarten, Sint Eustatius, and Saba. In some contexts, the term is also used to refer to the entire island of Saint Martin (which also includes the Collectivity of Saint Martin), alongside Sint Eustatius and Saba.

The SSS islands were island territories of the Netherlands Antilles, until its dissolution in 2010. Since then, Sint Maarten is a constituent country of the Kingdom of the Netherlands, while Sint Eustatius and Saba are special municipalities of the Netherlands. &quot;SSS&quot; is an acronym of the islands&#x27; names, and is analogous to the ABC, CAS, and BES islands, which are other commonly used subdivisions of the Dutch Caribbean.

==History==
The island of Saint Martin was split between France and the Netherlands in 1648. The Dutch part, together with Sint Eustatius and Saba, became a single Dutch colony in 1815 as Sint Eustatius and Dependencies (). In 1828, this colony was merged with the colonies Curaçao and Dependencies (the ABC islands) and Surinam, with Paramaribo as its capital. When this merger was partly reversed in 1845, the Dutch part of the SSS islands became part of Curaçao and Dependencies, with Willemstad as its capital. This colony became the Netherlands Antilles in 1954.

As part of the Netherlands Antilles, the SSS islands initially formed a single island territory () as the Windward Islands. In 1983, it was split up into three separate island territories, each with a separate island council. After the dissolution of the Netherlands Antilles on 10 October 2010, Sint Eustatius and Saba became special municipalities of the Netherlands, while Sint Maarten became an independent country within the Kingdom of the Netherlands.

<doc id="920880" wikidata="Q6530305" url="?curid=920880" title="Leschi Park">
<text>Leschi Park is an park in the Leschi neighborhood of Seattle, Washington, named after Chief Leschi of the Nisqually tribe. The majority of the park is a grassy hillside that lies west of Lakeside Avenue S. and features tennis courts, picnic tables, and a playground. 
Across Lakeside Avenue to the east is the western shore of Lake Washington and a small lawn with benches. To its south is the southern portion of Leschi Moorage, separated from the northern portion by a parking lot in the E. Yesler Way right-of-way, private docks, and an office/restaurant complex.

The cable car run from Pioneer Square that operated from September 27, 1888, to August 10, 1940, terminated here. As with Madison Park to the north, there was a cross-lake ferry run from Leschi Park to the Eastside before the construction of the Lacey V. Murrow Memorial Bridge. Seattle&#x27;s first zoo was located here, but moved to Woodland Park in 1903. Leschi Park borders Frink Park in its southwest corner.

The Duwamish called the area &quot;Changes-Its-Face&quot; (Lushootseed: s7ayá7oos), referring to an enormous and powerful supernatural horned snake that was said to live there.

==Steamboat operations==

From about 1890 to about 1910, Leschi Park was an important stop for steamboats which ran on Lake Washington.

<doc id="920887" wikidata="Q313366" url="?curid=920887" title="Dr. Alban">
<text>Alban Uzoma Nwapa (born 26 August 1957), better known by his stage name Dr. Alban, is a Nigerian-Swedish musician and producer with his own record label, Dr. Records. His music can best be described as Eurodance/hip-hop reggae in a dancehall style. He has sold an estimated 16 million records worldwide and is most famous for his worldwide 1992 hit &quot;It&#x27;s My Life&quot;, from the album &quot;One Love&quot;.

==Life and career==
===Early life===
Alban was born Alban Uzoma Nwapa into a middle-class family of 10 children in Oguta, Imo state, Nigeria. He is Igbo.

===Education===
He got his secondary education at Christ the King College and spent most of his youth in his hometown of Oguta. At age 23, he travelled to Sweden to study dentistry at Lund University. To finance his studies, Dr. Alban became a DJ at the Stockholm club Alphabet Street.

===Denniz Pop and achieving success: 1990s===
In 1990, he met Denniz Pop from the SweMix label and, together with Denniz and rap artist Leila K, released his first record &quot;Hello Afrika&quot;. At this point, he took the stage name Dr. Alban, a nod to his dental studies. His debut album included hits like &quot;Hello Afrika&quot; and &quot;No Coke&quot;, both of which ended up being million-selling singles. The album itself was quite successful and earned him gold certification awards in numerous markets including Germany (for sales of over 250,000 units), Austria (25,000), and Switzerland (25,000).

One year later, this success was surpassed by his second album &quot;One Love&quot;. The album included European hit singles such as &quot;It&#x27;s My Life&quot; (which was used as background music for a Tampax advert) and &quot;Sing Hallelujah&quot;. The single &quot;It&#x27;s My Life&quot; reached No.1 in Israel, Austria, the Netherlands, Sweden, and Germany, and No.2 in Norway, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. The song &quot;It&#x27;s My Life&quot; went platinum in Germany (for sales of over 500,000 units), in the Netherlands (75,000), and it sold over two million copies overall in Europe. The album in turn reached the top of the album chart in Austria and entered the top five in Switzerland, also reaching No.6 in Germany. It went gold in Germany (for sales of over 250,000 units) and platinum both in Austria and Switzerland (both 50,000).

Alban&#x27;s third album &quot;Look Who&#x27;s Talking!&quot;, released in 1994, hit the top 10 in numerous markets including Germany, Switzerland, and Austria. The album was the first to earn Alban a gold certification award in his home country of Sweden for sales of over 50,000 units.

Dr. Alban founded his own record label &quot;Dr. Records&quot;, whereon he released his 1996 album &quot;Born in Africa&quot;. The album was unable to match the success of his previous releases. It only reached No.12 in Finland, while it peaked at No.37 in Switzerland and Sweden, No.52 in Germany, and No.41 in Austria. The single &quot;Born in Africa&quot; went to number 1 in Finland.

In 1997, Alban released the compilation album &quot;The Very Best of 1990–1997&quot;, which only charted in Austria, Sweden, and Germany. The same year, the artist also released the studio album &quot;Believe&quot;, which peaked at No.27 in Sweden, No.30 in Finland, and No.41 in Austria. In late 1998, Dr. Alban released a single with German-based artist Sash!, entitled &quot;Colour the World&quot;, which experienced moderate chart success in Europe.

===Decline and return to music: 2000s===
In 2000, Alban released the single &quot;What Do I Do&quot;, which charted only in Sweden at No.43; it spent only two weeks on the charts there. The album &quot;Prescription&quot; was a flop as it failed to chart anywhere.

In 2007, after years of absence from the music scene, Dr. Alban released the studio album &quot;Back to Basics&quot;. It was sold on the internet only through Dr. Alban&#x27;s official website. In Russia, however, physical CDs and cassettes were released.

===Later activities: 2010s–present===
In 2010, Alban collaborated once again with Sash! to produce a remake of &quot;Hello Afrika&quot;, &quot;Hello South Afrika&quot;, dedicated to the 2010 FIFA World Cup. It was followed by a single consisting of 16 remixes.

On 15 February 2014 at the Scandinavium arena in Gothenburg, Dr. Alban teamed up with Jessica Folcker and arrived in fifth place in the third heat of Melodifestivalen 2014, with the song &quot;Around the World&quot;, to win the right to represent Sweden at the Eurovision Song Contest 2014 in Copenhagen, Denmark.

In 2015, he released the single &quot;Hurricane&quot;, which failed to enter the European charts.

In May 2020, Alban released the song &quot;Hello Sverige&quot; (in Swedish) to encourage the population of Sweden to respect social distancing measures put in place to counteract the COVID-19 pandemic. The next month, he released an English version titled &quot;Hello Nations&quot;. The song is another remake of his classic hit &quot;Hello Afrika&quot;.

In June 2020, Alban released the single &quot;Drama&quot;, also in Swedish, in collaboration with singer Folkhemmet. The song talks about Alban&#x27;s long-running acrimonious relationship with Swedish tabloid journalists.

===Personal life===
Alban met his future wife, Swedish teacher Katrine Hermansson, in 2004, through footballer Tomas Brolin. The couple had two daughters together, Jane (2005) and Julia (2008). The relationship ended in 2021. Since his divorce, Alban has continued to live in Stockholm.

<doc id="920896" wikidata="Q6516469" url="?curid=920896" title="River Eden, Kent">
<text>The River Eden is a tributary of the River Medway in south east England. It rises at the foot of the North Downs escarpment near Titsey in Surrey and runs initially southwards through Oxted before turning eastwards to enter Kent. After flowing through Edenbridge and passing Hever Castle, the Eden meets the Medway at Penshurst.

The name &#x27;Eden&#x27; is a back-formation from Edenbridge, (&quot;Eadhelmsbrigge&quot; (Eadhelm&#x27;s Bridge) in Old English).

==Course==
The Eden rises at the foot of the North Downs in Titsey parish, Surrey (grid reference TQ 420 551), about 350 metres north of Clacket Lane motorway services. It initially runs southwestwards through Oxted, before turning south. From its source to its confluence with the Gibbs Brook (which it meets to the north of Crowhurst), the Eden is also known as the Broadmead Water.

Downstream of Haxted Mill, the river meets its principal tributary, the Eden Brook, and turns eastwards to enter Kent above Edenbridge. The river continues to flow eastwards, feeding the ornamental lake at Hever Castle, before turning southeastwards to meet the Medway at Penshurst.

Much of the catchment area of the Eden lies on Weald Clay.

==Water quality==
According to the Environmental Change Network, water quality in the Eden is mainly classified as General Quality Assessment (GQA) Class C, although the headwaters near Oxted are Class D. The river receives treated sewage effluent from two Southern Water sewage treatment works (STW), serving Edenbridge and Oxted respectively; the stretches receiving these effluents are both subject to EC Urban Water Treatment &quot;Sensitive Waters&quot; investigations. There are other, much smaller, private sewage treatment works throughout the catchment. The river and its tributaries support coarse fisheries. Average flows at Penshurst range from 3.909 m3/s in January to 0.485 m3/s in July. Water to fill Bough Beech Reservoir, owned by SES Water, is pumped from a point just upstream of Penshurst.

Water quality of the River Eden in 2019:
==Watermills==

The River Eden powered a number of watermills. From source to the Medway they were:

===Titsey Mill===

This was an old manorial mill. A Roman Villa at Titsey was converted into a fulling mill.

===Limpsfield Mill===
TQ 404 534 

The 1868 ordnance survey map identifies the site of this pre-conquest mill from the position of its sluice. This has been renewed and the pond is occasionally in water.

===Tidy Green Mill, Limpsfield===

This was a Domesday site, the mill at Limenensfeld then being valued at 2s. This mill may take its name from the Tydye/Tidy family. This mill was demolished in 1892.

===Upper Mill, Oxted===
TQ 386 523 
This mill was demolished in the late 18th century; by 1817 the site of the millpond was used for cottages.

===Middle Mill, Oxted===
TQ 390 513 
The surviving corn mill building, now just &quot;Oxted Mill&quot;, has been converted into offices. It dates from 1892-5, although on a site in use from much earlier. Originally two buildings, the older one housed an overshot wheel of diameter, breadth . The newer mill, opened on 12 June 1893, was a roller mill driven by a turbine producing at 63 revolutions per minute. The building was used as a factory for making woodworking tools in the 1950s.

===Coltsford (Cottsford) Mill, Oxted===

TQ 397 506 

A Domesday site. This mill retains its machinery, which dates from c.1860 and is all cast iron. The mill is used as a corporate event centre, and there is a trout fishery nearby. The cast iron waterwheel still turns.

===Mill site===

This mill stood just downstream of Coltsford mill, it may have been known as &quot;Crowherstmelle&quot;.

===Haxted Mill, Edenbridge===
TQ 418 455 

Haxted Watermill stands in Surrey close to the borders with Kent. It is a Domesday site and the mill was mentioned in the will of Sir Reginald de Cobham in 1361. The western half of the building dates to c.1580 and the eastern half dates to 1794. The mill was last used to grind flour in 1919 but worked until 1945. It was turned into a museum in 1969 but is now a brasserie and bar.

The current overshot waterwheel has a diameter of and a width of . It was installed in about 1830, but by 1972 the 72 iron buckets had failed and were replaced by fibreglass replicas. The bearing-stone for an earlier, undershot waterwheel was found during renovation and this dates to the 14th century. In full working order the current wheel produced about , rotating at 8 r.p.m. and driving three pairs of millstones, through gearing, at 120 r.p.m. The pit wheel and wallower are of the same date as the waterwheel, but the great spur wheel, made of oak with applewood teeth, has been dated to 1580. The mill originally operated three pairs of millstones, but in the later years of its working life one pair was removed.

===Town (Honour&#x27;s) Mill, Edenbridge===
In 1291 a water powered pump was at work here, draining the marshland between Lingfield and Edenbridge. The present corn mill building dates to the early 19th century, but incorporates parts of an older structure. The cast iron low breastshot waterwheel drove three pairs of stones. The mill last ground by water sometime before the First World War, and was working by electricity into the 1970s. The waterwheel was used to work ancillary machinery until 1968, when the cast iron pit wheel was broken in the floods of that year.

===Hever Castle Mill===

There was a corn mill at Hever Castle.

===Chiddingstone (Cranstead) Mill===

TQ 496 461 

Possibly a Domesday site. In the 18th century, the millers were the Keeys family, Richard c.1740, followed by his son Richard. In 1840, the mill was owned by Henry Streatfield and in the occupation of James Young. The wife of his son James Jr died in 1853, James Jr was describes as being &quot;of Chiddingstone mill&quot;. The mill was last worked in the 1930s.

This mill was a derelict shell for many years, but the building has now been house converted. No machinery survives. A picture of the mill before conversion can be seen here and more pictures can be seen here.

===Vexour Park mill===

TQ 511 454 approx 

A weir in Vexour Park marks the site of a long vanished watermill.

==Tributaries==

The main tributaries of the Eden are the Gibbs Brook, Eden Vale Stream, and the Eden Brook, which has the Felbridge Water as a tributary. The Kent Brook, which forms the boundary between Surrey and Kent for part of its length, joins near Edenbridge.

==Watermills on the tributaries==

Various tributaries also powered watermills:

===Gibbs Brook===

The Gibbs Brook, formerly known as the Gippes River powered four watermills.

====Mill site====
====Ivy Mill, Godstone.====

This mill belonged to the manor of Chevington in Bletchley. In 1698 the owner was George Whatman, the mill being partly rebuilt in that year. A photograph of Ivy Mill in 1898 can be seen here. It was burnt down in the 1920s.

====Leigh Mill, Godstone====

This Domesday mill was valueless in 1349, as all the soke tenants had perished in the plague. It had previously been worth 20s or 30s per year. In the Elizabethan times the mill was used as a gunpowder mill, in the ownership of George Evelyn, grandfather of diarist John Evelyn. On 28 January 1589 Evelyn was granted a wide-ranging royal licence to explore for saltpetre, a principal ingredient, and his mills at Godstone were the most important in the country. The mill has been house converted, only the axle and pit wheel remaining of the machinery.

====Mill site====
===Eden Brook===

The Eden Brook powered three watermills.

====Hedgecourt Mill, Felbridge====

TQ 359 404 

This was an old hammer mill site. The mill was first mentioned in 1562 when John Thorpe was listed as repairing buildings, the mill and banks to the value of £64. He was leasing the manor of Hedgecourt from the Gage family of Firle at the time. In 1567 John Thorpe took out a 21 year lease on the mill, the mills being described as &quot;newly erected&quot; and having an overshot waterwheel. In 1594, the mill was in the tenancy of Thomas Thorpe, son of John Thorpe. In 1652, the mill was in the tenancy of Robert Filkes of Godstone. In 1663, John Finch took out an eleven-year lease on Hedgecourt Mill. A toll chest is mentioned in the lease, indicating that the mill was a corn mill, at least in part. He was still there in 1669, paying a half-yearly rent of £14 and tax of 2/-. By March 1670 Joseph Marchant had joined him, but he died in 1674. His widow Sarah took out a lease on the mill in October of that year. The mill passed to her son John in 1688. In 1701, Joseph Marchant (son of John) was at the mill. He built or extended a house in 1701, possibly an extension to the mill. In 1723, Joseph Marchant renewed his lease on the mill and in 1739 James Marchant (son of Joseph) took a sixty-year lease with William Clayton of Marden on of Hedgecourt Heath in Horne, on which to erect a windmill. The mill was an open trestle post mill. Joseph Marchant seems to have retired by 1742. An unexecuted lease of 1743 mentions that the miller has permission to take timber for the purpose of making charcoal (used in the smelting of iron). The site remained in the ownership of the Gage family until 1745, when Colonel Edward Evelyn bought it. It was a furnace mill at that time.

Edward Evelyn commissioned a map of his new estate. This was drawn by J Bourd of Tunbridge Wells, Kent in 1748. James Marchant was still at the mill in 1773, when he bequeathed all his possessions to his brother Benjamin Marchant, a cooper and innkeeper of Cheam, Surrey. James Marchant seems to have retired in the 1780s. The next known millers were Messrs Stenning, Lock and Stone are recorded as paying rent for the Mill at Hedgecourt. This can only be the watermill as the windmill had gone by 1789. Thomas Stone was the miller in 1814, followed by his son John, who was joined by Laurence Hardy by 1822. John Saunders was the miller in 1840, having previously been at Wiremill. Saunders was still at the mill in 1855 when it was sold by Lady Selina Charlotte, Viscountess Milton to George Gatty. At that time the mill had an diameter overshot waterwheel driving two pairs of millstones. John Tully Coomber had joined Saunders by 1858, working the mill until at least 1861. George Gatty died in 1864 and the mill passed to his son Charles Henry Gatty. Robert Bartley was the miller in 1869, working the mill until at least 1871 and then Sydney Killick was the miller in 1881, followed by Thomas Colvin who was there in 1891. Charles Gatty died in 1903, and the mill passed to two of his cousins, Charles Lane Sayer and Alfred Leighton Sayer. The mill was probably still operable at this time. In 1910 the mill was sold to Percy Portway Harvey, and in 1916 the mill was in the ownership of Henry Willis Rudd, later passing to a Belgian by the name of Mr Honore Dubar.

The mill was visited by Robert Thurston Hopkins in 1926, the machinery still being intact at this time. The mill was also visited by Jack Hillier in 1948, while researching his book on Surrey watermills. By this time the mill was a ruin, still containing its machinery. The upper floors of the mill were demolished in 1949 with the lower part of the mill being used as a boat store. in 1962, the Dubars sold the mill to John Edwards. The mill house was condemned in 1964 and stood empty until 1969. The building being then converted and extended to form two residences.

;Machinery
Overshot waterwheel, cast iron spokes, wooden soleboard and buckets, diameter by wide on an oak axle, driving a diameter cast iron pit wheel with oak cogs. This drove a cast iron wallower on a wooden hexagonal upright shaft, driving a wooden Great Spur Wheel in diameter, driving two pairs of millstones.

====Felcourt (Woodcock Hammer, Weir, Wire) Mill. Felbridge====

An old hammer mill site, at work from 1567 to 1786. One of the names indicates that the mill was a drawing mill at one time. In 1533, the effects of Thomas Gaynesford included a hammer mill. The property had been bough by Gaynesford from Sir John Gage in 1550. In 1559, Nicholas Norton was a miller grinding grain near lands called Shawnors, followed by John Myller in 1560 to 1563, when John Rodgers succeeded him. in 1567, Wiremill was being worked by John Thorpe. In the 1560s, there are several references to Woodcock Hammer or Forge being worked by Swanne.

Woodcock Forge is believed to have been built by Jack Dancy of Turners Hill. Hedgecourt Mill is thought to have been remodelled by him about the same time. The pond at Hedgecourt acted as a storage for the Woodcock forge. The tilt hammer was operated by an overshot waterwheel. Another overshot waterwheel worked bellows. In 1574, John Thorpe of Hedgecourt was working the forge in connection with the furnace at Myllwood. in 1586 Thorpe bought property from William Swanne Sr in the Woodcock Forge area. From 1598 to 1606 the rent was paid by Thomas Thorpe, son of John and in 1629 the forge was leased by John Gage to Richard Thorpe, the son of Thomas. His son, also Richard, held the forge until 1651, when it was forfeit in lieu of a debt. Thorpe&#x27;s interest in the forge was sold to Simon Everenden of Cliffe near Lewes. In the 1650s the forge was in the occupation of John Newnham. In 1664, the forge was lease by Jeremy Johnson Jr of Charlwood. In 1672, woodland next to the pond was referred to as &quot;Hammerwood&quot; also known as &quot;Wire Wood&quot; thus indicating a drawing mill. John Newnham died in 1707, and his wife died in 1719, but the forge was known as &quot;Mr Johnson&#x27;s Forge&quot; in 1717. At that time the output from the forge was some per annum. By 1729 the forge was in the occupation of Thomas Stanford, who was converting sows from Heathfield furnace at Woodcock Forge. Stanford does not seem to have had any connections with the Wealden iron industry after 1738. In 1742 Samuel Baker was in occupation, followed by Edward Raby and Alexander Master in 1758. They were supplying the Board of Ordnance with several gauges of bar iron, staff iron and rolled plate. Raby &amp; Master were bankrupt in 1764. Edward Raby died in 1771, and the forge was taken over by his son Alexander until 1774, when the Government forced him to give up Woodcock furnace in a wrangle over the size of his moulds. Joseph Wright and Thomas Pickett took the business, but it is thought that the Hammer Mill ceased to be used c.1787. In 1800, the name Wire Mill is first used.

Daniel Fossick held Wire Mill from 1800 to 1816, when he died. The mill was sold to James Jenner, who converted it to a corn mill. Jenner was at Wire Mill until 1844, when he was succeeded by William Brand. In 1838 he was joined by John Saunders, the mill being known as Woodcock Mill then. Saunders left in 1840 to take Hedgecourt Mill and William Brand joined Jenner. Jenner died in 1844 and Thomas Brand took the mill, which was known as Wire Mill in 1851. At this time the mill had two overshot waterwheels and drove four pairs of millstones. In 1855 the mill lake covered . Thomas Brand was still running the mill in 1871, assisted by his son Thomas, John Holman and John Burfield, all described as millers in the census of that year. In 1881, Thomas Brand (son) was the miller at Wire Mill. He ran the mill until 1887/88 when David Dadswell took the mill. Wire Mill was sold in 1911, described as having two overshot waterwheels and the mill lake covered at this time. A picture of the mill c.1911 can be seen here. The mill was not sold and again offered for auction in 1912, again without success. A third attempt at auction in 1918 saw the mill being bought by a Major Crum. He sold it to a Miss Wilkins who had the building converted to residential use in 1920. The mill was purchased by the Women&#x27;s Farm and Garden Union in 1922 and by 1929 was the Wire Mill Tea Gardens. By 1933 it was the Wire Mill Fishing Club and in 1948 the Wire Mill Hotel and Fishing Club. By 1962 the property was known as the Wiremill Lakeside Hotel, Country and Fishing Club. Over the next decade the Country Club grew in popularity, leading to complaints and the local council refused to renew the clubs music and dancing licence. In 1986 the mill was again sold, and although damaged by a fire during renovations reopened as a restaurant in September of that year. The mill was sold again in 1996 and 2000 and is now a pub. The building is devoid of machinery.

===Lingfield Tannery===

This tannery was water powered. It stood opposite the present day Lingfield Racecourse. In 1684 the mansion house of Batnors (later Battners) was bought by James Farindon. This included the tanyard, drying sheds and mill thereto. A map of John Gainsford&#x27;s lands in 1679 shows Gateland Farm was previously known as Tanners Farm. The farm was later the home of Robert Boreman, who died in 1715. The Tannery building was rebuilt by J T Kelsey c.1840. A planning application to demolish the &quot;historic old tannery&quot; was made in 1996 and the site is now a small housing development.

===Crooked River===
This rises in springs to the south of the Greensand Ridge at the edge of Limpsfield Common, Surrey. It joins the Kent Brook at (TQ 421 480), just to the west of the hamlet of Troy Town, Kent. On Rocque&#x27;s map of 1762 it is called the &quot;Serpentine River&quot;.

====Doghurst Mill====
TQ 412 508 

On the Crooked River at Itchingwood Common, three-quarters of a mile south of the source. On the 1868 county survey the building is standing, but shown as &quot;site of former water mill&quot;, and the mill pond is unwatered.

===Felbridge Water===

The Felbridge Water is a tributary of the Eden Brook. It powered two watermills.

====Clarkes Mill, Lingfield====

TQ 401 402 

This was a hammer mill, owned by Lady Gage in 1574.

====Ware (Weir) Mill, Felbridge====

A mill was on this site in 1241, when Stephen the miller held it of William de Adburton at a rent of 11s annually. In 1347, the mill was granted to John Gainsford. In 1406 William Atte Hurst obtained &quot;Crowherstmelle&quot; from the Marchant family, and granted it to William Gainsford. This may refer to this mill (but see above).

===Other tributaries.===

There are other tributaries feeding the River Eden that also powered watermills.

====Four Elms Mill, Hever====

Possibly the site of the Hever mill mentioned in 1279, when Roland, son of Peter de Broke, attempting to &quot;twirl the wheel&quot; was dragged into the cogs and crushed to death. The mill had an overshot wheel and had been demolished by 1933.

====Bough Beech Furnaces, Hever====

TQ 4813 4756 and TQ 4816 4760 .

An old hammer mill site, two furnaces are known to have existed.

====Christmas Mill, Edenbridge====

 (TQ 444 436) This was a double mill (i.e. having two waterwheels) in 1347, then in the possession of William de Shernden. The mill building survives, converted into a dwelling. The miller in 1841 was J Bassett. In 1910 a float device for automatically regulating the water level in the pond was installed. This is now a static exhibit at the nearby Haxted Mill Museum.

====Salman&#x27;s Farm Mill, Penshurst====

TQ 512 434

A Domesday site, this corn mill was powered supplied by a pond fed by a stream. It was powered by a cast iron overshot waterwheel and the machinery was removed in the early 1930s. The cast iron axle survives.

<doc id="920901" wikidata="Q10859422" url="?curid=920901" title="Software versioning">
<text>Software versioning is the process of assigning either unique &quot;version names&quot; or unique &quot;version numbers&quot; to unique states of computer software. Within a given version number category (e.g., major or minor), these numbers are generally assigned in increasing order and correspond to new developments in the software. At a fine-grained level, revision control is used for keeping track of incrementally-different versions of information, whether or not this information is computer software, in order to be able to roll any changes back.

Modern computer software is often tracked using two different software versioning schemes: an &quot;internal version number&quot; that may be incremented many times in a single day, such as a revision control number, and a &quot;release version&quot; that typically changes far less often, such as semantic versioning or a project code name.

==History==
File numbers were used especially in public administration, as well as companies, to uniquely identify files or cases. For computer files this practice was introduced for the first time with MIT&#x27;s ITS file system, later the TENEX filesystem for the PDP-10 in 1972.

Later lists of files including their versions were added, and dependencies amongst them. Linux distributions like Debian, with its dpkg, early on created package management software which could resolve dependencies between their packages. Debian&#x27;s first try was that a package knew other packages which depended on it. From 1994 on this idea was inverted, so a package that knew the packages it needed. When installing a package, dependency resolution was used to automatically calculate the packages needed as well, and install them with the desired package. To facilitate upgrades, minimum package versions were introduced. Thus the numbering scheme needed to tell which version was newer than the required one.

==Schemes==
A variety of version numbering schemes have been created to keep track of different versions of a piece of software. The ubiquity of computers has also led to these schemes being used in contexts outside computing.

===Sequence-based identifiers===

In sequence-based software versioning schemes, each software release is assigned a unique identifier that consists of one or more sequences of numbers or letters. This is the extent of the commonality; schemes vary widely in areas such as the number of sequences, the attribution of meaning to individual sequences, and the means of incrementing the sequences.

==== Change significance ====
In some schemes, sequence-based identifiers are used to convey the significance of changes between releases. Changes are classified by significance level, and the decision of which sequence to change between releases is based on the significance of the changes from the previous release, whereby the first sequence is changed for the most significant changes, and changes to sequences after the first represent changes of decreasing significance.

Depending on the scheme, significance may be assessed by lines of code changed, function points added or removed, the potential impact on customers in terms of work required to adopt a new version, risk of bugs or undeclared breaking changes, degree of changes in visual layout, the number of new features, or almost anything the product developers or marketers deem to be significant, including marketing desire to stress the &quot;relative goodness&quot; of the new version.

==== Semantic versioning ====

 (aka SemVer) is a widely-adopted version scheme that encodes a version by a three-part version number (Major.Minor.Patch), an optional pre-release tag, and an optional build meta tag. In this scheme, risk and functionality are the measures of significance. Breaking changes are indicated by increasing the major number (high risk); new, non-breaking features increment the minor number (medium risk); and all other non-breaking changes increment the patch number (lowest risk). The presence of a pre-release tag (-alpha, -beta) indicates substantial risk, as does a major number of zero (0.y.z), which is used to indicate a work-in-progress that may contain any level of potentially breaking changes (highest risk). As an example of inferring compatibility from a SemVer version, software which relies on version 2.1.5 of an API is compatible with version 2.2.3, but not necessarily with 3.2.4.

Developers may choose to jump multiple minor versions at a time to indicate that significant features have been added, but are not enough to warrant incrementing a major version number; for example, Internet Explorer 5 from 5.1 to 5.5 or Adobe Photoshop 5 to 5.5. This may be done to emphasize the value of the upgrade to the software user or, as in Adobe&#x27;s case, to represent a release halfway between major versions (although levels of sequence-based versioning are not necessarily limited to a single digit, as in Blender version 2.91 or &quot;Minecraft&quot; Java Edition starting from 1.7.10).

A different approach is to use the &quot;major&quot; and &quot;minor&quot; numbers along with an alphanumeric string denoting the release type, e.g. &quot;alpha&quot; (a), &quot;beta&quot; (b), or &quot;release candidate&quot; (rc). A software release train using this approach might look like 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9 → 1.0b1, 1.0b2 (with some fixes), 1.0b3 (with more fixes) → 1.0rc1 (which, if it is stable &quot;enough&quot;), 1.0rc2 (if more bugs are found) → 1.0. It is a common practice in this scheme to lock out new features and breaking changes during the release candidate phases and, for some teams, even betas are locked down to bug fixes only, to ensure convergence on the target release.

Other schemes impart meaning on individual sequences:
:&quot;major.minor[.build[.revision]]&quot; (example: &quot;1.2.12.102&quot;)
:&quot;major.minor[.maintenance[.build]]&quot; (example: &quot;1.4.3.5249&quot;)

Again, in these examples, the definition of what constitutes a &quot;major&quot; as opposed to a &quot;minor&quot; change is entirely subjective and up to the author, as is what defines a &quot;build&quot;, or how a &quot;revision&quot; differs from a &quot;minor&quot; change.

Shared libraries in Solaris and Linux may use the &quot;current.revision.age&quot; format where:
:&quot;current&quot;: The most recent interface number that the library implements.
:&quot;revision&quot;: The implementation number of the current interface. 
:&quot;age&quot;: The difference between the newest and oldest interfaces that the library implements. This use of the third field is specific to libtool: others may use a different meaning or simply ignore it.

A similar problem of relative change significance and versioning nomenclature exists in book publishing, where edition numbers or names can be chosen based on varying criteria.

In most proprietary software, the first released version of a software product has version 1.

==== Degree of compatibility ====
Some projects use the major version number to indicate incompatible releases. Two examples are Apache Portable Runtime (APR) and the FarCry CMS.

Often programmers write new software to be backward compatible, i.e., the new software is designed to interact correctly with older versions of the software (using old protocols and file formats) and the most recent version (using the latest protocols and file formats). For example, IBM z/OS is designed to work properly with 3 consecutive major versions of the operating system running in the same sysplex.
This enables people who run a high availability computer cluster to keep most of the computers up and running while one machine at a time is shut down, upgraded, and restored to service.

Often packet headers and file format include a version number – sometimes the same as the version number of the software that wrote it; other times a &quot;protocol version number&quot; independent of the software version number.
The code to handle old deprecated protocols and file formats is often seen as cruft.

==== Designating development stage ====
Software in the experimental stage (alpha or beta) often uses a zero in the first (&quot;major&quot;) position of the sequence to designate its status. However, this scheme is only useful for the early stages, not for upcoming releases with established software where the version number has already progressed past 0.

A number of schemes are used to denote the status of a newer release:
* &quot;Alphanumeric suffix&quot; is a common scheme adopted by semantic versioning. In this scheme, versions have affixed a dash plus some alphanumeric characters to indicate the status.
* &quot;Numeric status&quot; is a scheme that uses numbers to indicate the status as if it&#x27;s part of the sequence. A typical choice is the third position for the four-position versioning.
* &quot;Numeric 90+&quot; is another scheme that uses numbers, but apparently under a number of a previous version. A large number in the last position, typically 90 or higher, is used. This is commonly used by older open-source projects like Fontconfig.

The two purely numeric forms remove the special logic required to handle the comparison of &quot;alpha &lt; beta &lt; rc &lt; no prefix&quot; as found in semantic versioning, at the cost of clarity.

==== Incrementing sequences ====
There are two schools of thought regarding how numeric version numbers are incremented. Most free and open-source software packages, including MediaWiki, treat versions as a series of individual numbers, separated by periods, with a progression such as 1.7.0, 1.8.0, 1.8.1, 1.9.0, 1.10.0, 1.11.0, 1.11.1, 1.11.2, and so on.

On the other hand, some software packages identify releases by decimal numbers: 1.7, 1.8, 1.81, 1.82, 1.9, etc. Decimal versions were common in the 1980s, for example with NetWare, DOS, and Microsoft Windows, but even in the 2000s have been for example used by Opera and Movable Type. In the decimal scheme, 1.81 is the minor version following 1.8, while maintenance releases (i.e. bug fixes only) may be denoted with an alphabetic suffix, such as 1.81a or 1.81b.

The standard GNU version numbering scheme is major.minor.revision, but Emacs is a notable example using another scheme where the major number (1) was dropped and a &quot;user site&quot; revision was added which is always zero in original Emacs packages but increased by distributors. Similarly, Debian package numbers are prefixed with an optional &quot;epoch&quot;, which is used to allow the versioning scheme to be changed.

==== Resetting ====
In some cases, developers may decide to reset the major version number. This is sometimes used to denote a new development phase being released. For example, &quot;Minecraft&quot; Alpha ran from version 1.0.0 to 1.2.6, and when Beta was released, it reset the major version number and ran from 1.0 to 1.8. Once the game was fully released, the major version number again reset to 1.0.0.

==== Separating sequences ====
When printed, the sequences may be separated with characters. The choice of characters and their usage varies by the scheme. The following list shows hypothetical examples of separation schemes for the same release (the thirteenth third-level revision to the fourth second-level revision to the second first-level revision):

* A scheme may use the same character between all sequences: 2.4.13, 2/4/13, 2-4-13
* A scheme choice of which sequences to separate may be inconsistent, separating some sequences but not others: 2.413
* A scheme&#x27;s choice of characters may be inconsistent within the same identifier: 2.4_13 (for instance, &quot;Minecraft&quot; Beta incremented from 1.7 to 1.7_01 to 1.7.2)

When a period is used to separate sequences, it &quot;may&quot; or &quot;may not&quot; represent a decimal point—see &quot;Incrementing sequences&quot; section for various interpretation styles.

==== Number of sequences ====
There is sometimes a fourth, unpublished number which denotes the software build (as used by Microsoft). Adobe Flash is a notable case where a four-part version number is indicated publicly, as in 10.1.53.64. Some companies also include the build date. Version numbers may also include letters and other characters, such as Lotus 1-2-3 Release 1a.

==== Negative numbers ====
Some projects use negative version numbers. One example is the SmartEiffel compiler which started from −1.0 and counted upwards to 0.0.

===Date of release===

Many projects use a date-based versioning scheme called Calendar Versioning (aka CalVer).

Ubuntu is one example of a project using calendar versioning; Ubuntu 18.04, for example, was released in April 2018. This has the advantage of being easily relatable to development schedules and support timelines. Some video games also use date as versioning, for example the arcade game &quot;Street Fighter EX&quot;. At startup it displays the version number as a date plus a region code, for example &quot;961219 ASIA&quot;.

When using dates in versioning, for instance, file names, it is common to use the ISO 8601 scheme &quot;YYYY-MM-DD&quot;, as this is easily string-sorted in increasing or decreasing order. The hyphens are sometimes omitted. The Wine project formerly used a date versioning scheme, which used the year followed by the month followed by the day of the release; for example, &quot;Wine 20040505&quot;. &quot;Minecraft&quot; had a similar version formatting, but instead used DDHHMM, ex: rd-132211, 13 being the 13th of May, and 2211 being 22:11.

Microsoft Office build numbers are an encoded date: the first two digits indicate the number of months that have passed from the January of the year in which the project started (with each major Office release being a different project), while the last two digits indicate the day of that month. So 3419 is the 19th day of the 34th month after the month of January of the year the project started.

Other examples that identify versions by year include Adobe Illustrator 88 and WordPerfect Office 2003. When a year is used to denote version, it is generally for marketing purposes, and an actual version number also exists. For example, Windows 95 is internally versioned as MS-DOS 7.00 and Windows 4.00; likewise, Windows 2000 is internally versioned as NT 5.0.

== Software examples ==

===Python===
The Python Software Foundation has published PEP 440 – Version Identification and Dependency Specification, outlining their own flexible scheme, that defines an epoch segment, a release segment, pre-release and post-release segments and a development release segment.

===TeX===
TeX has an idiosyncratic version numbering system, an unusual feature invented by its developer Donald Knuth. Since version 3.1, updates have been indicated by adding an extra digit at the end, so that the version number asymptotically approaches the number , so 3.14 effectively means 3.2 in semantic versioning. (This is a form of unary numbering; the version number is the number of digits.) Since 2021, the version number has been 3.141592653 (3.9). This is a reflection of TeX being very stable, and only minor updates are anticipated. TeX developer Donald Knuth has stated that the &quot;absolutely final change (to be made after [his] death)&quot; will be to change the version number to , at which point all remaining bugs will become permanent features.

In a similar way, the version number of Metafont asymptotically approaches Euler&#x27;s number,. As of February 2021, the version number is 2.71828182 (2.8). Metafont was also devised by Donald Knuth as a companion to his TeX typesetting system.

===Apple===
During the era of the classic Mac OS, minor version numbers rarely went beyond &quot;.1&quot;. When they did, they usually jumped straight to &quot;.5&quot;, suggesting the release was &quot;more significant&quot;. Thus, &quot;8.5&quot; was marketed as its own release, representing &quot;Mac OS 8 and a half&quot;, and 8.6 effectively meant &quot;8.5.1&quot;.

Mac OS X departed from this trend, in large part because &quot;X&quot; (the Roman numeral for 10) was in the name of the product. As a result, all versions of OS X began with the number 10. The first major release of OS X was given the version number 10.0, but the next major release was not 11.0. Instead, it was numbered 10.1, followed by 10.2, 10.3, and so on for each subsequent major release. Thus the 11th major version of OS X was labeled &quot;10.10&quot;. Even though the &quot;X&quot; was dropped from the name as of macOS 10.12, this numbering scheme continued through macOS 10.15. Under the &quot;X&quot;-based versioning scheme, the third number (instead of the second) denoted a minor release, and additional updates below this level, as well as updates to a given major version of OS X coming after the release of a new major version, were titled Supplemental Updates.

The Roman numeral X was concurrently leveraged for marketing purposes across multiple product lines. Both QuickTime and Final Cut Pro jumped from version 7 directly to version 10, QuickTime X and Final Cut Pro X. Like Mac OS X itself, the products were not upgrades to previous versions, but brand-new programs. As with OS X, major releases for these programs incremented the second digit and minor releases were denoted using a third digit. The &quot;X&quot; was dropped from Final Cut&#x27;s name with the release of macOS 11.0 (see below), and QuickTime&#x27;s branding became moot when the framework was deprecated in favor of AVFoundation in 2011 (the program for playing QuickTime video was only named QuickTime Player from the start).

Apple&#x27;s next macOS release, provisionally numbered 10.16, was officially announced as macOS 11 at WWDC in June 2020, and released in November 2020. The following macOS version, macOS Monterey, was released in October 2021 and bumped its major version number to 12.

===Microsoft Windows===
The Microsoft Windows operating system was first labelled with standard version numbers for Windows 1.0 through Windows 3.11. After this Microsoft excluded the version number from the product name. For Windows 95 (version 4.0), Windows 98 (4.10) and Windows 2000 (5.0), year of the release was included in the product title. After Windows 2000, Microsoft created the Windows Server family which continued the year-based style with a difference: For minor releases, Microsoft suffixed &quot;R2&quot; to the title, e.g., Windows Server 2008 R2 (version 6.1). This style had remained consistent to this date. The client versions of Windows however did not adopt a consistent style. First, they received names with arbitrary alphanumeric suffixes as with Windows Me (4.90), Windows XP (5.1), and Windows Vista (6.0). Then, once again Microsoft adopted incremental numbers in the title, but this time, they were not versioning numbers; the version numbers of Windows 7, Windows 8 and Windows 8.1 are respectively 6.1, 6.2 and 6.3. In Windows 10, the version number leaped to 10.0 and subsequent updates to the OS only incremented build number and update build revision (UBR) number.

The successor of Windows 10, Windows 11, was released on October 5, 2021. Despite being named &quot;11&quot;, the new Windows release didn&#x27;t bump its major version number to 11. Instead, it stayed at the same version number of 10.0, used by Windows 10.

== Other schemes ==
Some software producers use different schemes to denote releases of their software. The Debian project uses a major/minor versioning scheme for releases of its operating system but uses code names from the movie &quot;Toy Story&quot; during development to refer to stable, unstable, and testing releases.

BLAG Linux and GNU features very large version numbers: major releases have numbers such as 50000 and 60000, while minor releases increase the number by 1 (e.g. 50001, 50002). Alpha and beta releases are given decimal version numbers slightly less than the major release number, such as 19999.00071 for alpha 1 of version 20000, and 29999.50000 for beta 2 of version 30000. Starting at 9001 in 2003, the most recent version is 140000.

Urbit uses &quot;Kelvin versioning&quot; (named after the absolute Kelvin temperature scale): software versions start at a high number and count down to version 0, at which point the software is considered finished and no further modifications are made.

==Internal version numbers==
Software may have an &quot;internal&quot; version number which differs from the version number shown in the product name (and which typically follows version numbering rules more consistently). Java SE 5.0, for example, has the internal version number of 1.5.0, and versions of Windows from NT 4 on have continued the standard numerical versions internally: Windows 2000 is NT 5.0, XP is Windows NT 5.1, Windows Server 2003 and Windows XP Professional x64 Edition are NT 5.2, Windows Server 2008 and Vista are NT 6.0, Windows Server 2008 R2 and Windows 7 are NT 6.1, Windows Server 2012 and Windows 8 are NT 6.2, and Windows Server 2012 R2 and Windows 8.1 are NT 6.3. Windows 10 was initially intended to be NT 6.4, as the earliest Technical Preview build shared to the public is numbered 6.4.9841. However, that did not last as the version of Windows 10 was quickly artificially increased to 10.0 to align with the commercial name, resulting in the first released version of the operating system being numbered 10.0.10240. Note, however, that Windows NT is only on its fifth major revision, as its first release was numbered 3.1 (to match the then-current Windows release number) and the Windows 10 launching made a version leap from 6.3 to 10.0.

==Pre-release versions==
In conjunction with the various versioning schemes listed above, a system for denoting pre-release versions is generally used, as the program makes its way through the stages of the software release life cycle.

Programs that are in an early stage are often called &quot;alpha&quot; software, after the first letter in the Greek alphabet. After they mature but are not yet ready for release, they may be called &quot;beta&quot; software, after the second letter in the Greek alphabet. Generally alpha software is tested by developers only, while beta software is distributed for community testing.

Some systems use numerical versions less than 1 (such as 0.9), to suggest their approach toward a final &quot;1.0&quot; release. This is a common convention in open source software. However, if the pre-release version is for an existing software package (e.g. version 2.5), then an &quot;a&quot; or &quot;alpha&quot; may be appended to the version number. So the alpha version of the 2.5 release might be identified as 2.5a or 2.5.a.

An alternative is to refer to pre-release versions as &quot;release candidates&quot;, so that software packages which are soon to be released as a particular version may carry that version tag followed by &quot;rc-#&quot;, indicating the number of the release candidate; when the final version is released, the &quot;rc&quot; tag is removed.

==Release train==
A software release train is a form of software release schedule in which a number of distinct series of versioned software releases for multiple products are released as a number of different &quot;trains&quot; on a regular schedule. Generally, for each product line, a number of different release trains are running at a given time, with each train moving from initial release to eventual maturity and retirement on a planned schedule. Users may experiment with a newer release train before adopting it for production, allowing them to experiment with newer, &quot;raw&quot;, releases early, while continuing to follow the previous train&#x27;s point releases for their production systems prior to moving to the new release train as it becomes mature.

Cisco&#x27;s IOS software platform used a release train schedule with many distinct trains for many years. More recently, a number of other platforms including Firefox and Fenix for Android, Eclipse, LibreOffice, Ubuntu, Fedora, Python, digiKam and VMware have adopted the release train model.

==Modifications to the numeric system==
===Odd-numbered versions for development releases===
Between the 1.0 and the 2.6.x series, the Linux kernel used odd minor version numbers to denote development releases and even minor version numbers to denote stable releases. For example, Linux 2.3 was a development family of the second major design of the Linux kernel, and Linux 2.4 was the stable release family that Linux 2.3 matured into. After the minor version number in the Linux kernel is the release number, in ascending order; for example, Linux 2.4.0 → Linux 2.4.22. Since the 2004 release of the 2.6 kernel, Linux no longer uses this system, and has a much shorter release cycle.

The same odd-even system is used by some other software with long release cycles, such as Node.js up to version 0.12 as well as WineHQ.

===Dropping the most significant element===
Sun&#x27;s Java has at times had a hybrid system, where the internal version number has always been 1.&quot;x&quot; but has been marketed by reference only to the &quot;x&quot;:
* JDK 1.0.3
* JDK 1.1.2 through 1.1.8
* J2SE 1.2.0 (&quot;Java 2&quot;) through 1.4.2
* Java 1.5.0, 1.6.0, 1.7.0, 1.8.0 (&quot;Java 5, 6, 7, 8&quot;)

Sun also dropped the first digit for Solaris, where Solaris 2.8 (or 2.9) is referred to as Solaris 8 (or 9) in marketing materials.

A similar jump took place with the Asterisk open-source PBX construction kit in the early 2010s, whose project leads announced that the current version 1.8.x would soon be followed by version 10.

This approach, panned by many because it breaks the semantic significance of the sections of the version number, has been adopted by an increasing number of vendors including Mozilla (for Firefox).

==Version number ordering systems==
Version numbers very quickly evolve from simple integers (1, 2, ...) to rational numbers (2.08, 2.09, 2.10)
and then to non-numeric &quot;numbers&quot; such as 4:3.4.3-2. These complex version numbers are therefore better treated as character strings. Operating systems that include package management facilities (such as all non-trivial Linux or BSD distributions) will use a distribution-specific algorithm for comparing version numbers of different software packages. For example, the ordering algorithms of Red Hat and derived distributions differ to those of the Debian-like distributions.

As an example of surprising version number ordering implementation behavior, in Debian, leading zeroes are ignored in chunks, so that 5.0005 and 5.5 are considered as equal, and 5.5&lt;5.0006. This can confuse users; string-matching tools may fail to find a given version number; and this can cause subtle bugs in package management if the programmers use string-indexed data structures such as version-number indexed hash tables.

To ease sorting, some software packages represent each component of the &quot;major.minor.release&quot; scheme with a fixed width. Perl represents its version numbers as a floating-point number; for example, Perl&#x27;s 5.8.7 release can also be represented as 5.008007. This allows a theoretical version of 5.8.10 to be represented as 5.008010. Other software packages pack each segment into a fixed bit width; for example, on Microsoft Windows, version number 6.3.9600.16384 would be represented as hexadecimal 0x0006000325804000. The floating-point scheme breaks down if any segment of the version number exceeds 999; a packed-binary scheme employing 16 bits apiece breaks down after 65535.

==Political and cultural significance of version numbers==
===Version 1.0 as a milestone===
The free-software and open source communities tend to release software early and often. Initial versions are numbers less than 1, with these 0.x version used to convey that the software is incomplete and not reliable enough for general release or usable in its current state. Backward-incompatible changes are common with 0.x versions.
Version 1.0 is used as a major milestone, indicating that the software has at least all major features plus functions the developers wanted to get into that version, and is considered reliable enough for general release. A good example of this is the Linux kernel, which was first released as version 0.01 in 1991, and took until 1994 to reach version 1.0.0.

The developers of the arcade game emulator MAME do not ever intend to release a version 1.0 of the program because there will always be more arcade games to emulate and thus the project can never be truly completed. Accordingly, version 0.99 was followed by version 0.100.

Since the internet has become widespread, most commercial software vendors no longer follow the maxim that a major version should be &quot;complete&quot; and instead rely on patches with bugfixes to sort out the known issues which a solution has been found for and could be fixed.

===Version numbers as marketing===
A relatively common practice is to make major jumps in version numbers for marketing reasons. Sometimes software vendors just bypass the 1.0 release or quickly release a release with a subsequent version number because 1.0 software is considered by many customers too immature to trust with production deployments. For example, as in the case of dBase II, a product is launched with a version number that implies that it is more mature than it is.

Other times version numbers are increased to match those of competitors. This can be seen in many examples of product version numbering by Microsoft, America Online, Sun Solaris, Java Virtual Machine, SCO Unix, WordPerfect. Microsoft Access jumped from version 2.0 to version 7.0, to match the version number of Microsoft Word.

Microsoft has also been the target of &quot;catch-up&quot; versioning, with the Netscape browsers skipping version 5 to 6, in line with Microsoft&#x27;s Internet Explorer, but also because the Mozilla application suite inherited version 5 in its user agent string during pre-1.0 development and Netscape 6.x was built upon Mozilla&#x27;s code base.

Another example of keeping up with competitors is when Slackware Linux jumped from version 4 to version 7 in 1999.

===Superstition===
*The Office 2007 release of Microsoft Office had an internal version number of 12. The next version, Office 2010, has an internal version of 14, due to superstitions surrounding the number 13. Visual Studio 2013 is Version number 12.0 of the product, and the new version, Visual Studio 2015 has the Version number 14.0 for the same reasons.
*Roxio Toast went from version 12 to version 14, likely in an effort to skip the superstitions surrounding the number 13. 
*Corel&#x27;s WordPerfect Office, version 13 is marketed as &quot;X3&quot; (Roman number 10 and &quot;3&quot;). The procedure has continued into the next version, X4. The same has happened with Corel&#x27;s Graphic Suite (i.e. CorelDRAW, Corel Photo-Paint) as well as its video editing software &quot;Video Studio&quot;.
*Sybase skipped major versions 13 &quot;and&quot; 14 in its Adaptive Server Enterprise relational database product, moving from 12.5 to 15.0.
* ABBYY Lingvo Dictionary uses numbering 12, x3 (14), x5 (15).
* SUSE Linux Enterprise skipped version 13 and 14 after version 12 and directly released SLES 15 in July 2018.

===Geek culture===
* The SUSE Linux distribution started at version 4.2, to reference 42, &quot;the answer to the ultimate question of life, the universe and everything&quot; mentioned in Douglas Adams&#x27; &quot;The Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy&quot;.
* A Slackware Linux distribution was versioned 13.37, referencing leet.
* Finnix skipped from version 93.0 to 100, partly to fulfill the assertion, &quot;There Will Be No Finnix &#x27;95&quot;, a reference to Windows 95.
* The Tagged Image File Format specification has used 42 as internal version number since its inception, its designers not expecting to alter it anymore during their (or its) lifetime since it would conflict with its development directives.

==Overcoming perceived marketing difficulties==
In the mid-1990s, the rapidly growing CMMS, Maximo, moved from Maximo Series 3 directly to Series 5, skipping Series 4 due to that number&#x27;s perceived marketing difficulties in the Chinese market, where the number 4 is associated with &quot;death&quot; (see tetraphobia). This did not stop Maximo Series 5 version 4.0 from being released. (The &quot;Series&quot; versioning has since been dropped, effectively resetting version numbers after Series 5 version 1.0&#x27;s release.)

==Significance==

=== In software engineering ===
Version numbers are used in practical terms by the consumer, or client, to identify or compare their copy of the software product against another copy, such as the newest version released by the developer. For the programmer or company, versioning is often used on a revision-by-revision basis, where individual parts of the software are compared and contrasted with newer or older revisions of those same parts, often in a collaborative version control system.

In the 21st century, more programmers started to use a formalized version policy, such as the semantic versioning policy. The purpose of such policies is to make it easier for other programmers to know when code changes are likely to break things they have written. Such policies are especially important for software libraries and frameworks, but may also be very useful for command-line applications (which may be called from other applications) and for other applications (which may be scripted and/or extended by third parties).

Versioning is also a required practice to enable many schemes of patching and upgrading software, especially to automatically decide what and where to upgrade to.

===In technical support===
Version numbers allow people providing support to ascertain &quot;exactly&quot; which code a user is running, so that they can rule out bugs that have already been fixed as a cause of an issue, and the like. This is especially important when a program has a substantial user community, especially when that community is large enough that the people providing technical support are &quot;not&quot; the people who wrote the code. The semantic meaning of version.revision.change style numbering is also important to information technology staff, who often use it to determine how much attention and research they need to pay to a new release before deploying it in their facility. As a rule of thumb, the bigger the changes, the larger the chances that something might break (although examining the Changelog, if any, may reveal only superficial or irrelevant changes). This is one reason for some of the distaste expressed in the &quot;drop the major release&quot; approach taken by Asterisk et alia: now, staff must (or at least should) do a full regression test for every update.

==Non-software use==
Some computer file systems, such as the OpenVMS Filesystem, also keep versions for files.

Versioning amongst documents is relatively similar to the routine used with computers and software engineering, where with each small change in the structure, contents, or conditions, the version number is incremented by 1, or a smaller or larger value, again depending on the personal preference of the author and the size or importance of changes made.

Software-style version numbers can be found in other media. 

In some cases, the use is a direct analogy (for example: Jackass 2.5, a version of Jackass Number Two with additional special features; the second album by Garbage, titled &quot;Version 2.0&quot;; or &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; 3.5, where the rules were revised from the third edition, but not so much as to be considered the fourth).

More often it&#x27;s used to play on an association with high technology, and doesn&#x27;t literally indicate a &#x27;version&#x27; (e.g., &quot;Tron 2.0&quot;, a video game followup to the film &quot;Tron&quot;, or the television series &quot;The IT Crowd&quot;, which refers to the second season as Version 2.0). A particularly notable usage is Web 2.0, referring to websites from the early 2000s that emphasized user-generated content, usability and interoperability.

Technical drawing and CAD software files may also use some kind of primitive versioning number to keep track of changes.

<doc id="920902" wikidata="Q628812" url="?curid=920902" title="CowParade">
<text>CowParade is an international public art exhibit that has featured in major world cities. Fiberglass sculptures of cows are decorated by local artists, and distributed over the city centre, in public places such as train stations, important avenues, and parks. They often feature artwork and designs specific to local culture, as well as city life and other relevant themes.

After the exhibition in the city, which may last many months, the statues are auctioned off and the proceeds donated to charity.

There are a few variations of shape, but the three most common shapes of cow were created by Pascal Knapp, a Swiss-born sculptor who was commissioned to create the cows specifically for the CowParade series of events. Pascal Knapp owns the copyrights to the standing, lying, and grazing cow shapes used in the CowParade events.

==History==
The concept of &quot;cow parade&quot; has its origins in Zürich, Switzerland, in 1998 by artistic director Walter Knapp, it is based on an idea which was realised in the same city for the first time in 1986: lions as the symbol of Zurich were painted and then on display throughout the city.

The Zürich exhibit 1998 was not called &quot;cow parade&quot; - it was called Land in Sicht (&quot;Land ho&quot;). The concept was brought to the United States when Chicago businessman Peter Hanig, along with Commissioner of Cultural Affairs Lois Weisberg, organized an event in Chicago in 1999 called Cows on Parade. A Swiss company, CowHolding Parade AG, started to explore the idea. The American company capitalizing on this idea, CowHolding Parade, was founded in 1999; the Swiss company promptly sued but the case fizzled out without results. A bronze casting of one of the cows is on permanent display in Chicago in commemoration of the city&#x27;s initial exhibition.

The success of this venture inspired many other cities to host similar fundraising projects. The idea has been taken up by other cities which have chosen animals for public art projects with painted fiberglass sculptures (e.g. Liverpool) (see Similar projects).

==Similar projects==
The phenomenon of CowParade has spawned copy-cat statue decorating projects in a number of cities worldwide.

Zürich itself has adapted the bear theme in the &quot;Teddy-Summer&quot; in 2005.

===Elephant Parades===
Elephant Parade is dedicated to saving the Asian elephant from extinction with auctioned off proceeds going to the Elephant Family organisation.

===Buddy Bears===
This adopts the Cowparade idea to Berlin&#x27;s town mascot; however the entailing United Buddy Bears exhibitions are very different from all other urban events. The bears were created by the German artists Klaus and Eva Herlitz. The idea and the philosophy behind the United Buddy Bears exhibitions are unique: with its international approach and its symbolism, this synthesis of the arts globally promotes tolerance, international understanding and a peaceful coexistence.

===Wild in Art===
Since 2008 Wild in Art has created sculpture trails since 2008 from Aberdeen to Cape Town including events associated with sporting events (2012 Olympics and 2014 Commonwealth Games).

==Criticism==
CowParade has been criticized by contributing artists for their selectivity standards; David Lynch&#x27;s cow with its flesh partially ripped off, and organs showing, was rejected. The explanation is that this particular CowParade cow was rejected by the City of New York, not the CowParade organisation.

<doc id="920929" wikidata="Q1228510" url="?curid=920929" title="Disco Volante (Mr. Bungle album)">
<text>Disco Volante (Italian for &quot;Flying Saucer&quot;) is the second studio album by American experimental rock band Mr. Bungle. It was released on October 10, 1995, through Warner Bros., and is often considered their most experimental album, mixing elements from such varied styles as death metal, jazz, Arabic music, musique concrète, easy listening, klezmer, and tango.

== Background ==
The album&#x27;s title refers to the name of the yacht of the same name featured in the James Bond film &quot;Thunderball&quot;, meaning &quot;flying saucer&quot; in Italian. Mr. Bungle had previously covered the film&#x27;s theme song live and in studio, but it was never officially released.

&quot;Disco Volante&quot; would be founding member Theo Lengyel&#x27;s final album with the band, leaving shortly after the tour due to &quot;artistic differences&quot;. Drummer Danny Heifetz would later comment, &quot;I miss him. He added a huge chemical imbalance that helped us on the road. He hates us and rightfully so. The music changed, plain and simple. Very little call for saxes, trombone or flute. He was an original member. I&#x27;m not. Makes me feel a bit like a union-buster.&quot;

Regarding the writing process of the album, bassist Trevor Dunn wrote on his website: 
== Composition ==
&quot;Disco Volante&quot; is regarded as Mr. Bungle&#x27;s most experimental album. Categorized primarily as experimental rock, avant-garde metal, and jazz fusion, many of the songs jump between multiple genres, including sludge metal (&quot;Everyone I Went to High School With Is Dead&quot;), death metal (&quot;Carry Stress in the Jaw&quot;, &quot;Merry Go Bye Bye&quot;), Arabic music (&quot;Desert Search for Techno Allah&quot;), musique concrète and tango (&quot;Violenza Domestica&quot;), klezmer (&quot;Ma Meeshka Mow Skwoz&quot;, &quot;Platypus&quot;), noise (&quot;The Bends&quot;), and easy listening (″Backstrokin&#x27;″).

Although much of the album&#x27;s lyrics are limited (&quot;Carry Stress in the Jaw&quot;, &quot;Phlegmatics&quot;), in non-English languages (&quot;Desert Search for Techno Allah&quot;, &quot;Violenza Domestica&quot;), or constructed from nonsense words (&quot;Ma Meeshka Mow Skwoz&quot;, &quot;Chemical Marriage&quot;), the lyrical content of &quot;Disco Volante&quot; is, as on their eponymous debut album, both dark and comedic. Lyrical themes include social isolation (&quot;Everyone I Went to High School With Is Dead&quot;), bruxism (&quot;Carry Stress in the Jaw&quot;), child abuse (&quot;After School Special&quot;), domestic violence (&quot;Violenza Domestica&quot;), the &quot;gradual decline of the human body due to social interactions&quot; (&quot;Phlegmatics&quot;), masturbation (&quot;Backstrokin&#x27;&quot;), and martyrdom (&quot;Merry Go Bye Bye&quot;). &quot;The Bends&quot; is a largely instrumental ten-minute suite split into ten different sections, detailing the experiences of a negligent diver who experiences decompression sickness.

&quot;Carry Stress in the Jaw&quot; and &quot;Phlegmatics&quot; are parts two and three of the &quot;Sleep&quot; trilogy, with part one being on the band&#x27;s eponymous debut album.

Both &quot;Carry Stress in the Jaw&quot; and &quot;Merry Go Bye Bye&quot; feature untitled hidden tracks. The first is sometimes referred to as &quot;The Secret Song&quot; (after a prominent lyric) or &quot;Spy&quot; (used to denote the song on the band&#x27;s set lists). The second is sometimes called &quot;Nothing&quot;, due to a joke in the liner notes. On vinyl pressings, the album is double grooved the first hidden track is in the second groove, which is notoriously difficult to accurately locate. On CD pressings, the hidden track is simply put immediately after &quot;Carry Stress in the Jaw&quot; on the same track. It was originally recorded without bassist Dunn&#x27;s input or knowledge; although, shortly before its release, Dunn managed to find it and added a vocal part. Dunn believes that the drums were played by McKinnon, keyboards by Heifetz, and bass guitar by Patton. The freely improvised hidden track after &quot;Merry Go Bye Bye&quot; begins at 7:21, after a full minute of silence. Neither track is mentioned in any way on the album packaging.

&quot;Disco Volante&quot; spawned a number of officially unreleased demos (circulated on internet peer-to-peer sharing networks): &quot;Ma Meeshka Mow Skwoz&quot;, &quot;Coldsore&quot; and &quot;Spy&quot;. &quot;Coldsore&quot;, one of woodwind player and keyboardist Clinton McKinnon&#x27;s first compositions for the band, would be adapted into the &quot;Love on the Event Horizon&quot; section of &quot;The Bends&quot;.

== Reception ==

In a highly favorable review of the album, Greg Prato of AllMusic described Mr. Bungle&#x27;s music as &quot;the musical equivalent of a David Lynch movie&quot;, performed in a &quot;totally original and new musical style...that sounds like nothing that currently exists.&quot; &quot;Stylus Magazine&quot; wrote in their 2005 review of the album that &quot;a decade later, &quot;Disco Volante&quot; still sounds daring.&quot; In a negative review, Mark Sutherland of &quot;NME&quot; wrote that the album was &quot;70 minutes of irredeemable excrement&quot; that failed at being music.

<text>Alois Terry Leiter (; born October 23, 1965) is an American former professional baseball player and current television sports commentator. He played in Major League Baseball as a left-handed pitcher from to for the New York Yankees, Toronto Blue Jays, Florida Marlins, and New York Mets. 

A two-time National League (NL) All-Star player, Leiter pitched for three World Series winning teams and threw a no-hitter in 1996 during his tenure with the Marlins. As a member of the New York Mets, Leiter was named the recipient of the prestigious Roberto Clemente Award in . After his playing career, he worked as a television color commentator and baseball analyst for the YES Network and the MLB Network.

==Career==
===Early career===
Leiter was raised in a baseball-oriented family; all five of his brothers played the game. A native of Berkeley Township, New Jersey, Leiter attended Central Regional High School, in the township&#x27;s Bayville section. During one stretch in high school, he pitched consecutive no-hitters followed by a 32-strikeout game in 13 innings on April 19, 1984 (a game which ended in a tie when it was called for rain). Leiter was selected for the Wilson First Team All-American team. In 2016, the NJSIAA named Leiter to the NJ High School Hall of Fame.

===New York Yankees===
Leiter was drafted by New York Yankees in 1984 MLB draft as a second round pick. Both he and his brother Mark became Yankees prospects.

Leiter made his MLB debut as the starting pitcher for the Yankees on September 15, 1987, earning the win in a Yankees 4–3 victory over the Milwaukee Brewers at Yankee Stadium. Leiter has mentioned on a YES Network broadcast that early in his career with the Yankees, manager Billy Martin walked up to him and asked him why he was lifting weights. Leiter responded, &quot;To strengthen my arm.&quot; Billy was quoted as saying, &quot;If you want to strengthen your arm, do some long toss.&quot; The young Leiter grew nervous easily; teammate Tommy John observed &quot;If they had named him to start on opening day [in 1989], he wouldn&#x27;t have slept for a week. That&#x27;s how high-strung he was. He was a rookie bouncing off the walls.&quot; In one of his final starts as a young player for the Yankees, manager Dallas Green left Leiter in to throw 162 pitches on a cold damp day in 1989.

===Toronto Blue Jays===
The Yankees traded him to the Toronto Blue Jays for outfielder Jesse Barfield on April 30, 1989. After being dealt to Toronto, the left-hander had arthroscopic surgery. He pitched in fewer than 20 innings for the Blue Jays from 1989 to 1992, because of the surgery, a pinched nerve in his elbow, tendinitis, and another arthroscopic surgery on his left shoulder. His statistics during this period were a 5.17 ERA, IP, 14 H, 10 K, 11 BB, 1 HR, 1 GS, 0–0. He was, however, able to overcome a blisters problem with an exotic liniment (that he used throughout his career), and was still seen as a very promising prospect.

Leiter finally got over his injury troubles in 1993, making 32 appearances (12 starts) for the Blue Jays. That year he appeared in 5 postseason games and even picked up a win in relief in Game One, and hit a double in Game Three of the 1993 World Series, as the Blue Jays went on to win their second consecutive World Championship. Leiter pitched effectively for the Blue Jays for the next two seasons before departing via free agency in 1996.

===Florida Marlins===
Following the 1995 season, Leiter left Toronto and signed with the Florida Marlins as a free agent. In his first season as a Marlin, Leiter made his first All-Star team, going 16–12 with a 2.93 ERA and 200 strikeouts.

On May 11, 1996, he pitched a no-hitter against the Colorado Rockies, the first no-hitter in Marlins franchise history. This was also the first no-hitter that included a three-pitch inning. Leiter was also selected to his first All Star game. The game was played at Veterans Stadium in Philadelphia where he recorded the last out of a National League 6–0 win over the American League. The win was the last NL win for 13 years until 2010 when the National League won the All Star Classic in Anaheim.

In 1997, Leiter won another World Series as the Marlins beat the Cleveland Indians. Leiter started Game 7 for the Marlins, pitching 6 innings and giving up two earned runs while being credited with a no decision. The Marlins would go on to win the game 3–2 in 11 innings to capture the championship.

===New York Mets===

In the following off-season, Leiter was traded to the New York Mets in part of the Marlins&#x27; fire sale where owner Wayne Huizenga traded away almost all of the team&#x27;s higher priced players.

In Leiter&#x27;s first season as a Met, he reached a career high in wins going 17–6 and a career low in ERA finishing with a 2.47 ERA. In 1999, when the Mets were tied with the Cincinnati Reds for the National League Wild Card spot after 162 games, Leiter was the Mets starting pitcher in the &quot;winner take all&quot; one game playoff at Cinergy Field in Cincinnati. Leiter pitched a 2-hit shutout to earn the win in the Mets 5–0 victory. The win put the Mets in the playoffs for the first time in 11 seasons. The Mets would go on to lose the 1999 National League Championship Series to the Atlanta Braves 4 games to 2.

In 2000, Leiter made the All-Star team once again going 16–8 with a 3.20 ERA and 200 strikeouts. The Mets made the playoffs again in 2000 and this time reached the World Series. Leiter started Game 1 of the 2000 World Series at Yankee Stadium and Game 5 at Shea Stadium. Although he managed to achieve a 2.87 ERA and 16 strikeouts in innings, the Mets lost both games he started and eventually lost the World Series 4 games to 1. He was booed by Yankee fans when presented that year&#x27;s Roberto Clemente Award prior to Game 2 of the World Series. Leiter was the second New York Met to be honored with the award. During the 2000 season, he pitched in the All Star game, and gave up a single to Derek Jeter.

On April 30, 2002, Leiter became the first Major League pitcher to defeat all 30 teams, after beating the Arizona Diamondbacks 10–1. Leiter would pitch for the Mets until the end of the 2004 season. In his seven seasons in a Met uniform, all wearing number 22, he went 95–67 with a 3.42 ERA. At the time he left the Mets, he ranked highly on several Mets all-time lists including wins (6th), strikeouts (7th with 1106), innings pitched (7th with 1360.0), and games started (6th with 213). He was the Mets Opening Day starting pitcher in 1999, 2001, and 2002.

In ten straight seasons, from 1995 to 2004, Leiter had at least 10 wins and at least a .500 record.

===Second stint with Marlins===
Following the 2004 season, the Mets declined Leiter&#x27;s US$10 million option for 2005, making him a free agent. His former team, the Marlins, signed Leiter to a one-year, $8 million contract on December 8, 2004.

Leiter struggled during his return to the Marlins. He walked more batters than usual (60 in 80 innings, in addition to 88 hits). In 17 appearances (16 starts), he had a 3–7 record and a 6.64 ERA, and he took much criticism for the Marlins&#x27; first-half struggles in 2005 (they were 7 games behind the surprising Washington Nationals at the All-Star break). He was demoted to the bullpen in late June, but he returned to the rotation after an injury to Josh Beckett. On July 10, when the Marlins played their last game before the three-day All-Star break, he gave up six runs in three-plus innings.

On July 14, 2005, the Florida Marlins designated Leiter for assignment. 

===Second stint with Yankees===
On July 15, 2005, Leiter was acquired by the New York Yankees, who had four starting pitchers on the disabled list, for a player to be named later. His first start as a Yankee since April 26, 1989, came on July 17, 2005, against the division-leading Boston Red Sox. Leiter won the game, pitching innings, allowing one run and three hits, and striking out eight. After several starts with mixed success, he informed Joe Torre that he would be willing to pitch out of the bullpen, where he would stay for the latter part of the season, yielding his starting slot to Aaron Small.

Leiter worked out of the bullpen in the 2005 American League Division Series pitching in four of the five games between the Yankees and Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim. The Angels won the series 3 games to 2. In his final official appearance in a Major League uniform, Leiter earned a win, pitching scoreless innings in Game 4 at Yankee Stadium. The Yankees won the game 3–2.

Leiter signed a minor league contract with the Yankees in 2006; however, he stated he would likely retire. The primary reason he spent part of spring training with the Yankees was to keep in shape for the World Baseball Classic. After the United States team was eliminated from the World Baseball Classic, he officially retired in an interview on YES, after a Yankees spring training victory versus the Indians where Leiter pitched of an inning.

==Broadcasting career==

<text>Stefan Christian Holm (born 25 May 1976) is a retired Swedish high jumper. He won an Olympic gold medal, a silver in the World Championships, and one silver and one bronze medal in the European Championships. His personal records are (outdoors, set 2008) and (indoors, set 2005). Clearing the bar 59 centimeters (23 in) over his own height, he currently holds the world record for height differential, held jointly with American Franklin Jacobs.

Holm is currently coach of Swedish high jumper Sofie Skoog.

==Biography==
His inspiration for high-jumping began when he was 8 years old. He saw a Swedish high-jumping legend, and former world-record holder, Patrik Sjöberg, compete on television.

He set an indoor personal best of in 2003 to win the Hochsprung mit Musik meeting, and managed to reach the same height outdoors the following year while winning the Internationales Hochsprung-Meeting Eberstadt. In 2004, Holm won the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens with a jump of 2.36 and was awarded the Svenska Dagbladet Gold Medal. This year Holm also won the Jerring Award.

Holm finished 4th at the 2008 Summer Olympics with a leap of 2.32 m. On 13 September 2008 he announced his retirement from the sport. Holm ended his 20-year career with a second place at the World Athletics Final in Stuttgart.

He briefly returned to high jump competition in 2010 for a charity event: the Auto Lounge Comeback competition in Sweden. As his main rival Patrik Sjöberg had a knee injury, Holm agreed to jump off his wrong foot to even the score. He beat Sjöberg in the wrong-footed faceoff and went back to his normal takeoff to jump 2.15 m for third behind Ukhov and Donald Thomas.

He became an IOC member at the 125th IOC Session in Buenos Aires in September 2013. In October 2019, he announced he would leave his seat following the 2020 Summer Olympics.

On his 40th birthday in May 2016, Holm set a new Swedish veteran record for 40-year-olds (M40). With 2.06 m he broke the previous record of 2.05 m, which had been held by Egon Nilsson for almost 50 years.

Holm participated in the Swedish version of Who Do You Think You Are? in 2016. The longest ancestry tracing in the series&#x27; history was successfully made, covering 29 generations and 1,000 years back to the Swedish king Olof Skötkonung. This lineage is on Holm&#x27;s maternal great-great-great-grandfather&#x27;s side.

Holm&#x27;s son is Melwin Lycke Holm, winner of the 2023 European Athletics U20 Championships in the high jump.

<text>Paul Anthony Sorvino (, ; April 13, 1939 – July 25, 2022) was an American actor. He often portrayed authority figures on both the criminal and the law enforcement sides of the law.

Sorvino was particularly known for his roles as Lucchese crime family &quot;caporegime&quot; Paulie Cicero (based on real life gangster Paul Vario) in Martin Scorsese&#x27;s 1990 gangster film &quot;Goodfellas&quot; and as NYPD Sergeant Phil Cerreta on the second and third seasons of the TV series &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot;. He also played a variety of father figures, including Juliet&#x27;s father in Baz Luhrmann&#x27;s 1996 film &quot;Romeo + Juliet&quot;, as well as guest appearances as the father of Bruce Willis&#x27; character on the TV series &quot;Moonlighting&quot; and the father of Jeff Garlin&#x27;s character on &quot;The Goldbergs&quot;. He was in additional supporting roles in &quot;A Touch of Class&quot; (1973), &quot;Reds&quot; (1981, as Louis C. Fraina), &quot;The Rocketeer&quot; (1991), &quot;Nixon&quot; (1995, as Henry Kissinger), and &quot;The Cooler&quot; (2003).

Usually cast in dramatic supporting roles, he occasionally acted in lead roles in films including &quot;Bloodbrothers&quot; (1978), and also in comedic roles including his turn as a bombastic Southern evangelist in Carl Reiner&#x27;s &quot;Oh, God!&quot; (1977). Sorvino was nominated for a Tony Award for Best Actor for the 1972 play &quot;That Championship Season&quot;, and later starred in film and television adaptations. He was the father of actors Mira Sorvino and Michael Sorvino.

==Early life==
Sorvino was born on April 13, 1939, and raised in the Bensonhurst section of Brooklyn. His mother, Angela Maria Mattea (née Renzi; 1906–1991), was a homemaker and piano teacher of Italian (Molisan) descent who was born in Connecticut. His father, Ford Sorvino, was an Italian (Neapolitan) immigrant who worked in a robe factory as a foreman.

Sorvino attended Lafayette High School (where he was a classmate of Peter Max, a painter and artist), graduated, and then went to the American Musical and Dramatic Academy.

==Career==
Sorvino began his career as a copywriter in an advertising agency. He took voice lessons for 18 years. While attending The American Musical and Dramatic Academy, he decided to go into the theatre. He made his Broadway debut in the 1964 musical &quot;Bajour&quot;, and six years later he appeared in his first film, Carl Reiner&#x27;s &quot;Where&#x27;s Poppa?&quot;, starring George Segal and Ruth Gordon. In 1971, he played a supporting role in Jerry Schatzberg&#x27;s critically acclaimed &quot;The Panic in Needle Park&quot;, starring Al Pacino and Kitty Winn.
Sorvino received critical praise for his performance as Phil Romano in Jason Miller&#x27;s 1972 Broadway play &quot;That Championship Season&quot;, a role he reprised in the 1982 film version. He acted in another George Segal-starring film with a prominent supporting role in the Academy Award-winning romantic comedy &quot;A Touch of Class&quot; (1973). In &quot;It Couldn&#x27;t Happen to a Nicer Guy&quot; (1974), he played Harry Walters, a real estate salesman randomly picked up by a beautiful woman (JoAnna Cameron) and raped at gunpoint as a prank. He appeared in the 1976 Elliott Gould/Diane Keaton vehicle &quot;I Will, I Will... for Now&quot;. He starred in the weekly series &quot;We&#x27;ll Get By&quot; (1975, as George Platt), &quot;Bert D&#x27;Angelo/Superstar&quot; (1976, in the title role), and &quot;The Oldest Rookie&quot; (1987, as Detective Ike Porter). He also directed &quot;Wheelbarrow Closers&quot;, a 1976 Broadway play by Louis La Russo II, which starred Danny Aiello.

In 1981, Sorvino played the role of Italian-American communist Louis C. Fraina in Warren Beatty&#x27;s film &quot;Reds&quot;. He appeared in Larry Cohen&#x27;s 1985 horror film &quot;The Stuff&quot; as a reclusive militia leader, alongside future &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot; co-star Michael Moriarty. Sorvino also helped found the American Stage Company, a group that launched several successful Off-Broadway shows, in 1986.

In 1991, Sorvino took on the role of Sergeant Phil Cerreta (replacing actor George Dzundza in a new role) on the popular series &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot;. Sorvino initially was excited about the role but left after 29 episodes, citing the exhausting schedule demanded by the filming of the show, a need to broaden his horizons, and the desire to preserve his vocal cords for singing opera. Sorvino&#x27;s exit from the series came in an episode in which Sgt. Cerreta is shot in the line of duty and transferred to an administrative position in another precinct. He was replaced by Jerry Orbach.

In 1993, Sorvino substituted for Raymond Burr in a Perry Mason TV movie, &quot;The Case of the Wicked Wives&quot;. He had earlier appeared as Bruce Willis&#x27; father in the weekly series &quot;Moonlighting&quot; and the &quot;Lamont&quot; counterpart in the never-aired original pilot for &quot;Sanford and Son&quot;. Some of his most notable film roles were &quot;caporegime&quot; Paul Cicero in Martin Scorsese&#x27;s &quot;Goodfellas&quot; (1990) and Henry Kissinger in Oliver Stone&#x27;s &quot;Nixon&quot; (1995). In addition to &quot;Goodfellas&quot;, Sorvino also played mob bosses Eddie Valentine in &quot;The Rocketeer&quot; and Tony Morolto in &quot;The Firm&quot;.

Sorvino founded the Paul Sorvino Asthma Foundation; he intended to build asthma centers for children and adults across the United States. In 1998, he narrated the series &quot;The Big House&quot; for The History Channel. In 1999, he directed and again starred in (albeit playing a different role) a TV version of &quot;That Championship Season&quot;.
In &quot;Hey Arnold!: The Movie&quot;, Sorvino voiced the main antagonist, Mr. Scheck, the CEO of Future Tech Industries, who wants to convert Arnold&#x27;s neighborhood into a huge shopping mall. From 2000 to 2002, Sorvino had a lead role as Frank DeLucca in the television drama &quot;That&#x27;s Life&quot;. He also starred in the comedy &quot;Still Standing&quot; as Al Miller, father to Bill (Mark Addy). Sorvino filmed &quot;The Trouble with Cali&quot; in the Scranton/Wilkes-Barre area of Pennsylvania. He directed and starred in the film, and his daughter Mira also acted in a lead role in the film.

Sorvino played GeneCo founder Rotti Largo in the 2008 musical film &quot;Repo! The Genetic Opera&quot;. Working with &quot;Repo!&quot; director Darren Lynn Bousman again, Sorvino played God in &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Carnival&quot;, a short film screened on tour beginning in April 2012.

Sorvino&#x27;s final motion picture &quot;The Ride&quot; was released posthumously in 2022. Sorvino appeared alongside Dean Cain, D.B. Sweeney, and his wife Dee Dee in his final performance. Sorvino&#x27;s scenes were filmed in Jacksonville, Florida.

==Personal life==
Sorvino lived in Los Angeles and Madison, Indiana. He had three children: Mira, Michael, and Amanda from his first marriage with Lorraine Davis. Mira and Michael are actors.

On January 17, 2007, news reports detailed that he pulled a gun in front of Daniel Snee, an ex-boyfriend of his daughter Amanda, after the man pounded on her hotel room door and made threats. Amanda testified that Snee threatened to kill her at a hotel on January 3 in Stowe, Vermont. She said she locked herself in the bathroom and called both the police and her father. Her 67-year-old father showed up before police, she testified. When police arrived, the young man was arrested and charged with disorderly conduct, she said. As a deputy sheriff in Pennsylvania, Sorvino was legally authorized to carry a gun in different states. He did not point the gun at Snee or threaten him.

In March 2008, Sorvino and his daughter Amanda lobbied with the Americans Against Horse Slaughter in Washington D.C., for U.S. Congress to pass the American Horse Slaughter Prevention Act (S311/HR503). The Sorvinos run a private horse rescue operation in Gilbert, Pennsylvania.

Sorvino was also an accomplished sculptor, specializing in cast bronze. In December 2008 his sculpture of the late playwright Jason Miller was unveiled in Scranton, Pennsylvania. In addition, he guest-starred on the 2008 album of Neapolitan singer Eddy Napoli, &quot;Napulitanata&quot;, performing a duet of the song &quot;Luna Rossa&quot;.

In 2007, Sorvino launched Paul Sorvino Foods to market a range of pasta sauces. Based on his mother&#x27;s recipe, the product appeared in supermarkets in the northeastern United States in late 2009. Three years later, Sorvino became part owner in Janson-Beckett Cosmeceuticals.

In an April 2014 interview, Sorvino said, &quot;Most people think I&#x27;m either a gangster or a cop or something, but the reality is I&#x27;m a sculptor, a painter, a best-selling author, many, many things—a poet, an opera singer, but none of them is gangster, but, you know, obviously I sort of have a knack for playing these things. It&#x27;s almost my later goal in life to disabuse people of the notion that I&#x27;m a slow-moving, heavy-lidded thug, and most people&#x27;s impression of me &quot;IS&quot; that—because of the success of &quot;Goodfellas&quot; and a few other things, but they forget that I was also Dr. Kissinger in &quot;Nixon&quot;, the deaf lawyer in &quot;Dummy&quot;, and they forget a lot of things that I&#x27;ve done. It would be nice to have my legacy more than that of just tough guy.&quot;

Before screening his film &quot;Once Upon a Time in Queens&quot; at the Florida Film Festival in Orlando in April 2014, Sorvino revealed that he practiced New Formalism, by writing rhymed and metrical verse after the heyday of Modernist poetry, and recited one of his own poems as an example.

In December 2014, Sorvino married political pundit Dee Dee Benkie after he met her while appearing as a guest on &quot;Your World With Neil Cavuto&quot;.

In January 2018, Sorvino found out that Harvey Weinstein allegedly sexually harassed his daughter Mira, and blacklisted her within the film industry after she rejected the film mogul&#x27;s sexual demands. In response, Sorvino told TMZ, &quot;He&#x27;s going to go to jail. Oh yeah. That son of a bitch. Good for him if he goes, because if not, he has to meet me. And I will kill the motherfucker. Real simple. If I had known it, he would not be walking. He&#x27;d be in a wheelchair. This pig will get his comeuppance. The law will get him. He&#x27;s going to go to jail and die in jail.&quot;

===Death===
Sorvino died of natural causes at Mayo Clinic Florida in Jacksonville on July 25, 2022, aged 83. He was interred at Hollywood Forever Cemetery.

<text>The Chunta Aragonesista (CHA; ) is a political party in Aragon (Spain), influenced by eco-socialism and pacifism. CHA defends a federal state, greater financial resources for Aragon, and the protection of the environment and hydrological resources of the Ebro Valley. It promotes the use of the Aragonese language.

== History ==
CHA was founded in 29 June 1986. 

In the 2000 and 2004 general elections, CHA won 0.4% of the vote and one seat for José Antonio Labordeta, a folk singer in the Zaragoza constituency. It lost the seat in 2008 after Labordeta retired from the congress. In the 2011 election, it regained the seat as part of an electoral alliance with United Left.

José Luis Soro has been the president since February 2012.

== Ideology ==
The CHA has been described as Aragonese nationalist and eco-socialist. In 2005, the party campaigned against the ratification of the European Constitution.

The National Assembly is the highest organ of representation and decision of the Chunta. It establishes political policies, programs and principles, and chooses the members of the Mayan of Lawsuits, to those of the National Committee and to the president of CHA.

=== Alliances ===

For the European Parliament elections, CHA has taken part in many nationwide coalitions such as the Europe of the Peoples or European Spring.

<doc id="920966" wikidata="Q7440275" url="?curid=920966" title="Seacoast Region (New Hampshire)">
<text>The Seacoast Region is the southeast area of the U.S. state of New Hampshire that is centered around the city of Portsmouth. It includes the eastern portion of Rockingham County and the southern portion of Strafford County. At its narrowest definition, the region stretches along the Atlantic Ocean from New Hampshire&#x27;s border with Salisbury, Massachusetts, to the Piscataqua River and New Hampshire&#x27;s border with Kittery, Maine. The shoreline alternates between rocky and rough headlands and areas with sandy beaches. Some of the beaches are bordered by jetties or groins, particularly in the towns of Rye and Hampton. Most definitions of the Seacoast Region includes some inland towns as well, including the Great Bay area cities of Dover and Rochester, the college town of Durham, and areas as far west as Epping. Some definitions also include nearby portions of York County, Maine that are culturally aligned with the Portsmouth area rather than the Portland, Maine metropolitan area.

The city of Portsmouth is the cultural and commercial hub of the region, with numerous historical landmarks and other attractions including Strawbery Banke, the Moffatt-Ladd House, and the John Paul Jones House. Dover in Strafford County is the largest city in the region by population and is the oldest permanent settlement in New Hampshire. Dover is home to the Children&#x27;s Museum of New Hampshire and the renowned Woodman Institute Museum. The Seacoast Region was the first area of the state to be permanently settled by Europeans in the early 17th century.

Straddling the maritime border New Hampshire shares with Maine are the Isles of Shoals - White, Seavey, Lunging, and Star Islands. From Portsmouth, they are a short ferry ride out into the Gulf of Maine.

==Transportation==
New Hampshire Route 1A runs along the ocean shore, while U.S. Route 1 runs in a parallel direction slightly farther inland. During the high tourist season, these highways are crowded with day tourists and seasonal renters. Slightly farther inland, Interstate 95 (the Blue Star Turnpike) carries most of the through traffic between Maine and Massachusetts, while NH Route 101 carries New Hampshire&#x27;s east–west traffic between the Seacoast Region and the inland portions of the state. The Spaulding Turnpike (NH 16) originates in Portsmouth and travels north through Dover and Rochester, connecting the Seacoast with New Hampshire&#x27;s Lakes Region and White Mountains Region.

Amtrak&#x27;s &quot;Downeaster&quot; stops in three Seacoast communities - Dover, Durham–UNH, and Exeter- with service to Boston&#x27;s North Station and Portland, and points north. The &quot;Downeaster&quot; also stops in nearby Wells, Maine.

The Pease International Tradeport includes a shipping port (the Port of New Hampshire) and the Portsmouth International Airport at Pease, which provides cargo and passenger service.

<text>A demand curve is a graph depicting the inverse demand function, a relationship between the price of a certain commodity (the &quot;y&quot;-axis) and the quantity of that commodity that is demanded at that price (the &quot;x&quot;-axis). Demand curves can be used either for the price-quantity relationship for an individual consumer (an individual demand curve), or for all consumers in a particular market (a market demand curve).

It is generally assumed that demand curves slope down, as shown in the adjacent image. This is because of the law of demand: for most goods, the quantity demanded falls if the price rises. Certain unusual situations do not follow this law. These include Veblen goods, Giffen goods, and speculative bubbles where buyers are attracted to a commodity if its price rises. 

Demand curves are used to estimate behaviour in competitive markets and are often combined with supply curves to find the equilibrium price (the price at which sellers together are willing to sell the same amount as buyers together are willing to buy, also known as market clearing price) and the equilibrium quantity (the amount of that good or service that will be produced and bought without surplus/excess supply or shortage/excess demand) of that market. 

Movement &quot;along the demand curve&quot; refers to how the quantity demanded changes when the price changes. 

Shift of the demand curve as a whole occurs when a factor other than price causes the price curve itself to translate along the x-axis; this may be associated with an advertising campaign or perceived change in the quality of the good.

Demand curves are estimated by a variety of techniques. The usual method is to collect data on past prices, quantities, and variables such as consumer income and product quality that affect demand and apply statistical methods, variants on multiple regression. The issue with this approach, as outlined by Baumol, is that only one point on a demand curve can ever be observed at a specific time. Demand curves exist for a certain period of time and within a certain location, and so, rather than charting a single demand curve, this method charts a series of positions within a series of demand curves. Consumer surveys and experiments are alternative sources of data. For the shapes of a variety of goods&#x27; demand curves, see the article price elasticity of demand.

==Shape of the demand curve==
In most circumstances the demand curve has a negative slope, and therefore slopes downwards. This is due to the law of demand which conditions that there is an inverse relationship between price and the demand of commodity (good or a service). As price goes up quantity demanded reduces and as price reduces quantity demanded increases. 

For convenience, demand curves are often graphed as straight lines, where &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; are parameters:

:formula_1.

The constant &quot;a&quot; embodies the effects of all factors other than price that affect demand. If income were to change, for example, the effect of the change would be represented by a change in the value of &quot;a&quot; and be reflected graphically as a shift of the demand curve. The constant &quot;b&quot; is the slope of the demand curve and shows how the price of the good affects the quantity demanded.

The graph of the demand curve uses the inverse demand function in which price is expressed as a function of quantity. The standard form of the demand equation can be converted to the inverse equation by solving for P:

:formula_2.

=== Curvature ===

The demand is called &quot;convex&quot; (with respect to the origin) if the (generally down-sloping) curve bends upwards, &quot;concave&quot; otherwise. 

The demand curvature is fundamentally hard to estimate from the empirical data, with some researchers suggesting that demand with high convexity is practically improbable. Demand curve are, however, considered to be generally convex in accordance with diminishing marginal utility. Theoretically, the Demand curve is equivalent to the Price-offer curve and can be derived by charting the points of tangency between Budget Lines and indifference curves for all possible prices of the good in question.

==Assumptions underlying the derivation of the demand curve==

# Income of the consumer remains constant.
# Price of other related goods remain constant.
# Preference, tastes, habits and fashions of consumer remains constant.
# Number of buyers remain constant.
# The commodity is a normal good and has no status value.

==Three categories of demand curves==

*Individual demand curve: the relationship between the quantity of a product a single consumer is willing to buy and its price.
*Market demand curve: the relationship between the quantity of a product that all consumers in the market are willing to buy and its price. The market demand curve can be obtained by adding up the individual demand curves of individual consumers in the industry horizontally.
*Firm demand curve: (A firm demand curve may also be referred to as the demand curve of the market to which the firm is exposed.) It refers to the relationship between the number of customers willing to buy a certain product from the enterprise and its price.

The slope of the market industry demand curve is greater than the slope of the individual demand curve; the slope of the enterprise demand curve is less than the slope of the industry demand curve.

The slope of a firm&#x27;s demand curve is less than the slope of the industry&#x27;s demand curve.

==Shift of a demand curve==
The shift of a demand curve takes place when there is a change in any non-price determinant of demand, resulting in a new demand curve. Non-price determinants of demand are those things that will cause demand to change even if prices remain the same—in other words, the things whose changes might cause a consumer to buy more or less of a good even if the good&#x27;s own price remained unchanged.

Some of the more important factors are the prices of related goods (both substitutes and complements), income, population, and expectations. However, demand is the willingness and ability of a consumer to purchase a good &quot;under the prevailing circumstances&quot;; so, any circumstance that affects the consumer&#x27;s willingness or ability to buy the good or service in question can be a non-price determinant of demand. As an example, weather could be a factor in the demand for beer at a baseball game.

When income increases, the demand curve for normal goods shifts outward as more will be demanded at all prices, while the demand curve for inferior goods shifts inward due to the increased attainability of superior substitutes. With respect to related goods, when the price of a good (e.g. a hamburger) rises, the demand curve for substitute goods (e.g. chicken) shifts out, while the demand curve for complementary goods (e.g. ketchup) shifts in (i.e. there is more demand for substitute goods as they become more attractive in terms of value for money, while demand for complementary goods contracts in response to the contraction of quantity demanded of the underlying good).
With factors of individual demand and market demand, both complementary goods and substitutes affect the demand curve.

*Complementary goods are goods A and B where the demand for the former and the price of the latter have an inverse relationship, with an increase in the price of the former leading to a decrease in the demand for the latter and vice versa, but there is no relationship between them as capital goods and consumer goods.
*Substitutes are those goods for which there is a positive relationship between the demand for good A and the price of good B (e.g., an increase in the price of one good is an increase in the demand for the other) and which are in competition with each other.

===Factors affecting individual demand===
* Changes in the prices of related goods (substitutes and complements)
* Changes in disposable income, the magnitude of the shift also being related to the income elasticity of demand.
* Changes in tastes and preferences. Tastes and preferences are assumed to be fixed in the short-run. This assumption of fixed preferences is a necessary condition for aggregation of individual demand curves to derive market demand.
* Changes in expectations.

===Factors affecting market demand===
In addition to the factors which can affect individual demand there are three factors that can cause the market demand curve to shift:

* a change in the number of consumers,
* a change in the distribution of tastes among consumers,
* a change in the distribution of income among consumers with different tastes.

Some 

factors which affect demand curve
*Decrease in price of a substitute
*Increase in price of a complement
*Decrease in income if good is normal good
*Increase in income if good is inferior good

==Movement along a demand curve==

There is movement &quot;along&quot; a demand curve when a change in price causes the quantity demanded to change. It is important to distinguish between movement along a demand curve, and a shift in a demand curve. Movements along a demand curve happen only when the price of the good changes. When a non-price determinant of demand changes, the curve shifts. These &quot;other variables&quot; are part of the demand function. They are &quot;merely lumped into intercept term of a simple linear demand function.&quot; Thus a change in a non-price determinant of demand is reflected in a change in the x-intercept causing the curve to shift along the x axis.

==Price elasticity of demand==

The price elasticity of demand is a measure of the sensitivity of the quantity variable, Q, to changes in the price variable, P. Its value answers the question of how much the quantity will change in percentage terms after a 1% change in the price. This is thus important in determining how revenue will change. The elasticity is negative because the price rises, and the quantity demanded falls, a consequence of the law of demand.

The elasticity of demand indicates how sensitive the demand for a good is to a price change. If the elasticity&#x27;s absolute value is between zero and 1, demand is said to be inelastic; if it equals 1, demand is &quot;unitary elastic&quot;; if it is greater than 1, demand is elastic. A small value--- inelastic demand--- implies that changes in price have little influence on demand. High elasticity indicates that consumers will respond to a price rise by buying much less of the good. For examples of elasticities of particular goods, see the article section, &quot;Selected price elasticities&quot;.

The elasticity of demand usually will vary depending on the price. If the demand curve is linear, demand is inelastic at high prices and elastic at low prices, with unitary elasticity somewhere in between. There does exist a family of demand curves with constant elasticity for all prices. They have the demand equation formula_3, where &quot;c&quot; is the elasticity of demand and &quot;a&quot; is a parameter for the size of the market. These demand curves are smoothly curving with steep slopes for high values of price and gentle slopes for low values.

==Taxes and subsidies==
A sales tax on the commodity does not directly change the demand curve, if the price axis in the graph represents the price including tax. Similarly, a subsidy on the commodity does not directly change the demand curve, if the price axis in the graph represents the price after deduction of the subsidy.

If the price axis in the graph represents the price before addition of tax and/or subtraction of subsidy then the demand curve moves inward when a tax is introduced, and outward when a subsidy is introduced.

== Effect of taxation on the demand curve ==

*When the demand curve is perfectly inelastic (vertical demand curve), all taxes are borne by the consumer.

*When the demand curve is perfectly elastic (horizontal demand curve), all taxes are borne by the supplier.

*If the demand curve is more elastic, the supplier bears a larger share of the cost increase or tax. 

== Derived demand ==

The demand for goods can be further divorced into the demand markets for final and intermediate goods. An intermediate good is a good utilized in the process of creating another good, effectively named the final good. It is important to note that the cooperation of several inputs in many circumstances yields a final good and thus the demand for these goods is &quot;derived&quot; from the demand of the final product; this concept is known as derived demand. The relationship between the intermediate goods and the final good is direct and positive as demand for a final product increases demand for the intermediate goods used to make it.

In order to construct a derived demand curve, specific assumptions must be made and values held constant. The supply curves for other inputs, demand curve for the final good, and production conditions must all be held constant to ascertain an effective derived demand curve.

<doc id="920982" wikidata="Q1519460" url="?curid=920982" title="Management information base">
<text>A management information base (MIB) is a database used for managing the entities in a communication network. Most often associated with the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP), the term is also used more generically in contexts such as in OSI/ISO Network management model. While intended to refer to the complete collection of management information available on an entity, it is often used to refer to a particular subset, more correctly referred to as MIB-module.

Objects in the MIB are defined using a subset of Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1) called &quot;Structure of Management Information Version 2 (SMIv2)&quot; . The software that performs the parsing is a MIB compiler. 

The database is hierarchical (tree-structured) and each entry is addressed through an object identifier (OID). Internet documentation RFCs discuss MIBs, notably , &quot;Structure and Identification of Management Information for TCP/IP based internets&quot;, and its two companions, , &quot;Management Information Base for Network Management of TCP/IP-based internets&quot;, and , &quot;A Simple Network Management Protocol&quot;.

==ASN.1==
Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1) is a standard and flexible notation that describes data structures for representing, encoding, transmitting, and decoding data. It provides a set of formal rules for describing the structure of objects that are independent of machine-specific encoding techniques and is a precise, formal notation that removes ambiguities.

ASN.1 is a joint ISO and ITU-T standard, originally defined in 1984 as part of CCITT X.409:1984. ASN.1 moved to its own standard, X.208, in 1988 due to its broader applicability. The substantially revised 1995 version is covered by the X.680 standards series.

An adapted subset of ASN.1, Structure of Management Information (SMI), is specified for use in SNMP to define sets of related MIB objects; these sets are termed MIB modules.

==MIB hierarchy==
The MIB hierarchy can be depicted as a tree with a nameless root, the levels of which are assigned by different organizations. The top-level MIB OIDs belong to different standards organizations, while lower-level object IDs are allocated by associated organizations. This model permits management across all layers of the OSI reference model, extending into applications such as databases, email, and the Java reference model, as MIBs can be defined for all such area-specific information and operations.

A managed object (sometimes called a MIB object or object) is one of any number of specific characteristics of a managed device. Managed objects are made up of one or more object instances, which are essentially variables. An OID uniquely identifies a managed object in the MIB hierarchy.

Two types of managed objects exist: 
*Scalar objects define a single object instance.
*Tabular objects define multiple related object instances that are grouped in MIB tables.

An example of a managed object is &quot;codice_1&quot;, which is a scalar object that contains a single object instance, the integer value that indicates the total number of input AppleTalk packets on a router interface.

===SNMPv1 and SMI-specific data types===
The first version of the Structure of Management Information (SMIv1) specifies the use of a number of SMI-specific data types, which are divided into two categories: simple data types and application-wide data types.

====Simple data types====
Three simple data types are defined in the SNMPv1 SMI: 
* The &quot;integer&quot; data type is a signed integer in the range of −231 to 231−1.
* &quot;Octet strings&quot; are ordered sequences of 0 to 65,535 octets.
* &quot;Object IDs&quot; represent object identifiers that are allocated according to the rules specified in ASN.1.

====Application-wide data types====
The following application-wide data types exist in the SNMPv1 SMI:
*&quot;Network addresses&quot; represent addresses from a particular protocol family. SMIv1 supports only 32-bit (IPv4) addresses. SMIv2 uses Octet Strings to represent addresses generically, and thus are usable in SMIv1 too. SMIv1 had an explicit IPv4 address datatype.
*&quot;Counters&quot; are non-negative integers that increase until they reach a maximum value and then roll over to zero. SNMPv1 specifies a counter size of 32 bits.
*&quot;Gauges&quot; are non-negative integers that can increase or decrease between specified minimum and maximum values. Whenever the system property represented by the gauge is outside of that range, the value of the gauge itself will vary no further than the respective maximum or minimum, as specified in .
*&quot;Time ticks&quot; represent time since some event, measured in hundredths of a second.
*&quot;Opaques&quot; represent an arbitrary encoding that is used to pass arbitrary information strings that do not conform to the strict data typing used by the SMI.
*&quot;Integers&quot; represent signed integer-valued information. This data type redefines the integer data type, which has arbitrary precision in ASN.1 but bounded precision in the SMI.
*&quot;Unsigned integers&quot; represent unsigned integer-valued information, which is useful when values are always non-negative. This data type redefines the integer data type, which has arbitrary precision in ASN.1 but bounded precision in the SMI.

===SNMPv1 MIB tables===
The SNMPv1 SMI defines highly structured tables that are used to group the instances of a tabular object (that is, an object that contains multiple variables). Tables are composed of zero or more rows, which are indexed in a way that allows an SNMP manager to retrieve or alter an entire row with a single codice_2, codice_3, or codice_4 command.

===SMIv2===
The second version of the SMI (SMIv2) is described in and . It enhances and adds to the SMIv1-specific data types, such as including bit strings, network addresses, and counters. Bit strings are defined only in SMIv2 and comprise zero or more named bits that specify a value. Network addresses represent an address from a particular protocol family. Counters are non-negative integers that increase until they reach a maximum value and then return to zero. In SMIv1, a 32-bit counter size is specified. In SMIv2, 32-bit and 64-bit counters are defined.

SMIv2 also specifies information modules, which specify a group of related definitions. Three types of SMI information modules exist: MIB modules, compliance statements, and capability statements. 
* MIB modules contain definitions of interrelated managed objects.
* Compliance statements provide a systematic way to describe a group of managed objects that must be implemented for conformance to a standard.
* Capability statements are used to indicate the precise level of support that an agent claims with respect to a MIB group. An NMS can adjust its behavior toward agents according to the capabilities statements associated with each agent.

== Updating MIB modules ==
MIB modules are occasionally updated to add new functionality, remove ambiguities and fix defects. These changes are made in conformance to section 10 of and section 5 of . An example of a MIB module that has been updated many times is the important set of objects that was originally defined in , also known as &quot;MIB-II&quot;. This MIB module has since been split up and can be found in MIB modules such as &quot;Management Information Base for the Internet Protocol (IP)&quot;, &quot;Management Information Base for the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)&quot;, &quot;Management Information Base for the User Datagram Protocol (UDP)&quot;, &quot;The Interfaces Group MIB&quot; and &quot;Management Information Base (MIB) for the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)&quot;.

There are a large number of MIBs defined by standards organizations like the IETF, private enterprises and other entities.

=== IETF maintained ===
There are 318 RFCs in the first 5000 RFCs from the IETF that contain MIBs. This list is a mere fraction of the MIBs that have been written:

*SNMP - SMI: — Defines the Structure of Management Information (SMI)
*MIB-I: — Historically used with CMOT, not to be used with SNMP
*SNMPv2-SMI: — Structure of Management Information Version 2 (SMIv2)

The IETF and IEEE have agreed to move MIBs relating to IEEE work (for example Ethernet and bridging) to their respective IEEE workgroup. This is in process and a few items are complete.
* Network bridge
** IEEE 802.1ap-2008 consolidated the IEEE and IETF RFCs related to bridging networks into eight related MIBs.
* Management Information Base (MIB) Modules / IEEE 802.1

<text>Giovanni &quot;Tinto&quot; Brass (born 26 March 1933) is an Italian film director and screenwriter. In the 1960s and 1970s, he directed many critically acclaimed avant-garde films of various genres. Today, he is mainly known for his later work in the erotic genre, with films such as &quot;Caligula&quot;, &quot;Così fan tutte&quot; (released under the English title &quot;All Ladies Do It&quot;), &quot;Paprika&quot;, &quot;Monella&quot; (&quot;Frivolous Lola&quot;) and &quot;Trasgredire&quot;.

==Career==
===Avant-garde cinema===
In the 1960s and 1970s, Brass was considered a promising experimental and avant-garde director, and his debut film &quot;Who Works Is Lost&quot; got very favorable reviews after screening at Venice Film Festival 1963. In 1964, he was commissioned by Umberto Eco to create two short films experimenting with visual language for the 13th Triennale di Milano – &quot;Tempo Libero&quot; and &quot;Tempo Lavorativo&quot;. Throughout the 1960s and early 1970s, Brass directed films in many genres, including western (&quot;Yankee&quot;) and crime (&quot;Col cuore in gola&quot;), all using a very experimental editing- and camera-style. In 1968, Warner Bros. offered Brass the job of directing &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot;, which did not happen due to scheduling conflicts. In an article about the filming of &quot;Dropout&quot; from 1970, he was called the &quot;Antonioni of the 70s&quot;. His early period has been referred to as &quot;, anarchistic and experimental&quot;.

&quot;L&#x27;urlo&quot; was shown in competition at Berlin Film Festival 1970. &quot;La Vacanza&quot;, starring Vanessa Redgrave and Franco Nero won the prize of the film critics for the best Italian film at 1971 Venice Film Festival. In 1972, Brass was a member of the jury at the 22nd Berlin International Film Festival.

===Erotic cinema===
After &quot;Salon Kitty&quot; (1976) and &quot;Caligula&quot; (1979), the style of his films gradually changed towards erotic films. &quot;Caligula&quot; was originally supposed to be a satire on power instead of an erotic film, but the producers changed and re-edited the film entirely without Brass&#x27;s consent, removing many political and comical scenes, and shooting sexually explicit sequences, to make the film a pornographic drama. The director demanded that his name be stricken from the credits, and he is only credited for &quot;Principal Photography&quot;. Despite this, the film remains his most widely viewed work (and the highest-grossing Italian film released in the United States). Other notable works of Brass&#x27;s later period include &quot;The Key&quot; (1983) and &quot;Senso &#x27;45&quot; (2002). He was making films into his seventies.

===Style===

Brass&#x27; films since his early works follow an impressionistic style – they tend not to show immense landscapes, but bits and pieces of the scenery and peripheral characters and objects through pans and zooms, thus imitating how the viewer might see the events if he were actually present. This also gives the films an extraordinarily rapid pace. He often uses a television-like multicam method of shooting, with at least three cameras running at once, each focusing on something different.

There are many other directorial trademarks throughout his films. From &quot;Salon Kitty&quot; onwards, mirrors play a large part in the set design. Sometimes he even goes as far as to begin a scene with a mirror shot, then pan over to the action being reflected, giving a disorienting feeling. His erotic films – especially &quot;The Key&quot;, &quot;Miranda&quot; and &quot;All Ladies Do It&quot; – often accentuate women&#x27;s ample buttocks and pubic hair as well as underarm hair.

Brass&#x27; films in the 1980s and early 1990s had mainly been adaptations of famous literary works usually in the erotic genre, namely &quot;The Key&quot; (&quot;La chiave&quot;), &quot;The Mistress of the Inn&quot; (&quot;Miranda&quot;), the novel &quot;Le lettere da Capri&quot; by Mario Soldati (&quot;Capriccio&quot;), the novel &quot;Snack Bar Budapest&quot; by Marco Lodoli and Silvia Bre (eponymous), &quot;Fanny Hill&quot; (&quot;Paprika&quot;), and the novel &quot;L&#x27;uomo che guarda&quot; by Alberto Moravia (&quot;The Voyeur&quot;), while 2002 film &quot;Senso &#x27;45&quot; is an adaptation of &quot;Senso&quot;, previously filmed by Luchino Visconti.

Many of Brass&#x27; works qualify as period drama set during World War II (&quot;Salon Kitty&quot; and &quot;Senso &#x27;45&quot;, set in Berlin and Asolo respectively), in postbellum Italy (&quot;Miranda&quot; and &quot;Capriccio&quot;), antebellum Italy (&quot;The Key&quot;), and in 1950s Italy (&quot;Paprika&quot; and &quot;Monella&quot;).

Brass almost always works in a cameo for his friend Osiride Pevarello and himself as well. He was also featured as the presenter in the direct-to-video erotic short films compilation &quot;Tinto Brass presenta Corti Circuiti Erotici&quot; released in four volumes in 1999.

==Personal life==

Brass&#x27; nickname &quot;Tintoretto&quot; (later shortened to Tinto) was given by his grandfather Italico Brass, a renowned Gorizian painter.

He was married to Carla Cipriani (b. 1930, nicknamed &quot;Tinta&quot;), from 1957 until her death in 2006. Carla was the daughter of Harry&#x27;s Bar founder Giuseppe Cipriani, who managed the restaurant Locanda Cipriani on the Venetian island of Torcello and also collaborated as a screenwriter in Brass&#x27;s films. The couple had a daughter, Beatrice, and a son, Bonifacio.

After his wife&#x27;s death, Brass began a relationship with lawyer Caterina Varzi (b. 1961) who starred in his 2009 short film &quot;Hotel Courbet&quot;. They married in 2017.

As of 2010, Brass is politically affiliated with the Italian Radicals.

On 18 April 2010, he suffered an intracranial hemorrhage.

==Retrospectives==
In 2012, Hollywood Reel Independent Film Festival did a retrospective on Brass&#x27; early 1960s and 1970s films, screening newly restored versions.

<text>The Andalusian Party (, PA) was an Andalusian nationalist centre-left political party from Andalusia (Spain), with an important presence in provinces such as Cádiz and Seville although in the past they have stood in other provinces and even won seats in Barcelona to the Parliament of Catalonia.

==History==
The party was founded as the Socialist Alliance of Andalusia () in 1965 by Alejandro Rojas-Marcos. In 1976 it took the name Socialist Party of Andalusia (). In 1979 the name was changed to Socialist Party of Andalusia - Andalusian Party (). The PA party name was adopted in 1984. Its last Secretary-General was Antonio Jesús Ruiz.

A splinter group, led by former leader Pedro Pacheco, was formed in 2001, under the name Socialist Party of Andalusia (), later rejoined Partido Andalucista.

Historically, the party had been strong in the capital city of Andalusia, Seville, as well as other big cities like Jerez de la Frontera or Algeciras, obtaining the cities&#x27; mayorship in several times in all three cities. At their 17th Congress on 12 September 2015, the party dissolved.

Along much of its length, it follows the National Cycle Network Route 8 (Lôn Las Cymru) that continues to Holyhead, and is substantially off-road.

==History==

The trail was launched in September 1988 by Sir Wyn Roberts, Minister of State for the Welsh Office. The project was initiated and co-ordinated by the Merthyr and Cynon Groundwork Trust, with the co-operation of the local councils through whose areas the trail passes. Financial and logistical support was given by the Welsh Development Agency and by Sustrans, a sustainable transport charity.

Before the trail, there were several similar but disconnected routes in the area. Taff Ely borough council had created cycling routes within its boundaries, Cardiff city council had provided the Three Castles Cycle Route from Caerphilly into Cardiff, and the Brecon Beacons National Park was developing leisure trails to encourage the use of the park. The Groundwork Trust for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhondda Cynon Taf saw a need for the co-ordination of these efforts, and the Taff Trail was born.

In more recent times, there have been criticisms of the Taff Trail, both for being almost universally shared with pedestrians whenever it is segregated, and for being too narrow. Crashes have occurred along much of the Trail, with Cardiff Council promising to widen much of the route in their local area.

==The route==
The trail makes much use of an abandoned branch of the Taff Vale Railway and of the Glamorganshire Canal. These had been built in the 18th and 19th centuries to transport coal and iron ore from Merthyr Tydfil, the Cynon Valley and the Rhondda valley to the docks at Cardiff and Barry. The canals had become disused due to competition from the railways, and the railways in turn had become surplus to requirements as the heavy industries upon which they depended had been wound down. These routes, which although disused had remained largely intact, proved ideal for the needs of the trail, providing a convenient path along the narrow Taff valley.

===Cardiff===

The trail begins in Roald Dahl Plass in Cardiff Bay, at a sculpture named &quot;The Celtic Ring&quot;, created especially for the trail by Harvey Hood . Travelling west, it crosses the Taff and follows the river north through the centre of Cardiff along the Taff Embankment. It passes within of Cardiff Central railway station and of the Millennium Stadium in the city centre, before winding through Sophia Gardens, passing the home of Glamorgan County Cricket Club.

The trail continues along the Taff through Pontcanna Fields &amp; Llandaff Fields, and crosses the pedestrian bridge at Blackweir. It then follows the eastern bank of the Taff past Blackweir Lodge, under the A48 road flyover, past Llandaff Weir (Llandaff Rowing Club is visible on the opposite bank) near Howell&#x27;s School, Llandaff Cathedral and the BBC Wales studios, and through Hailey Park in Llandaff North. In this area (as with most of the path within Cardiff Council boundaries) pedestrians have been given priority, despite the national cycle route status of the trail. Especially on fair weather days, cyclists must proceed slowly due to pedestrian congestion and dog walkers.

It then moves inland for a short distance, before rejoining the river back close to Forest Farm, and continues along the river past Radyr Weir and under the M4 motorway.

===Tongwynlais===
After passing underneath the A470 dual carriageway, the Trail reaches the village of Tongwynlais. As well as shops, pubs, a café, and a cycle shop, it is home to the Gothic fantasy castle, Castell Coch. The Castell Coch grounds act as a lay by near the visitor centre, the Fforest fawr car park has been used by cyclists as a base to ascend the hills. Downhill mountain biking is a focal point to ride the 27 trails surrounding the castle grounds. At Tongwynlais, the trail splits into two. The high-level route climbs the steep hill to Castell Coch, then up a very steep path (best avoided in muddy conditions), and along a forest track of sharp stones. The low-level route is tarmacked and runs below the castle, adjacent to Taff&#x27;s Well railway station and then climbs steadily for along the former Rhymney Railway, until it rejoins the high-level route just before the Nantgarw bypass.

Here the route turns left off the main path - an easy turn to miss - and crosses the bypass, joining National Cycle Network Route 4 (known in Wales as the Celtic Trail). Route 4 stretches from London in the east to St David&#x27;s in the west, and runs along with the Taff Trail as far as Pontypridd.

===Pontypridd===

The trail proceeds along the former Alexandra (Newport Docks) Docks &amp; Railway Company line towards Rhydyfelin. At Rhydyfelin, the Trail emerges briefly to cross a minor road, before continuing through the Glyntaff Farm housing estate and passing along the length of Glyntaff Cemetery.

After the cemetery, the Trail joins Cilfynydd Road. The former route continued along the road for half a mile, before leading into the northern end of Pontypridd town centre. However, the trail is now signposted to cross a pedestrian bridge and pass through Ynysangharad Park. At the northern exit from the park, users may wish to take a short (50 yards) detour to visit the Old Bridge in Pontypridd. Cyclists may wish to use the bike locks outside the cafe promenade opposite the Northern exit of the park.

===Abercynon===
The Trail continues north-west on-road through Trallwng, before becoming traffic-free for a stretch, rejoining the Taff along the way. North of Cilfynydd, a permissive path alongside the Taff has been opened to avoid the previous road route between Cilfynydd and Abercynon. At Abercynon, the Trail follows the route of the Merthyr Tramroad, used by Richard Trevithick&#x27;s Penydarren steam locomotive. This stretch has been recently upgraded, but the original stone tramroad sleepers can be seen at the side of the gravel track.

===Aberfan===

At Pontygwaith, the Trail climbs steeply above the A470 by means of some steps. It then follows above the A470 as far as Aberfan, where it descends below the road and continues through the mainly residential areas of Aberfan. At this point, it passes the Aberfan Cemetery containing the memorial to the children and teachers who died in the Aberfan disaster. The stretch from Pontygwaith to Merthyr Tydfil follows the route of the former Glamorganshire Canal.

===Merthyr Tydfil===
After Aberfan, the trail passes through Troedyrhiw and Abercanaid, before reaching Merthyr Tydfil at the Rhydycar Leisure Centre. From this point, the town centre is around away over the Taff. It is very easy to get lost in Merthyr, and travellers may find it easier to ignore the Route 8 signs, and follow their road map instead.

===Brecon===
From Merthyr, the trail continues across Cefn Coed Viaduct, through Cefn-coed-y-cymmer, then follows the Taf Fechan (the smaller of the two main tributaries of the River Taff) past Pontsticill Reservoir. From Pontsticill to Brecon is about of remote scenery crossing the Brecon Beacons mountains - partly pretty forest tracks and partly wide open, expansive moorland. There are very steep roads on both sides of the mountain. Descending the mountain, cyclists can avoid the slow rough track on the east side of Talybont Reservoir by taking the road along the west bank, on which traffic is normally very sparse. The route continues along the trackbed of the former Brecon and Merthyr Railway to Talybont-on-Usk, then towards Brecon , in the last few kilometres following alongside the Monmouthshire and Brecon Canal.

A second route exists - also called the Taff Trail - from Cefn Coed to Brecon along the Taf Fawr (more or less parallel to the A470 road, but often on the opposite side of the valley) via the Garwnant Visitors Centre. This route is most suitable for walking and horse-riding. Although cycling (pref. mountain bike) is possible in places, it is not nearly so well sign-posted as the Taf Fechan route.

<text>The British Army presence in Egypt in World War II had, as a side effect, the concentration of a group of Cairo poets. There had been a noticeable literary group in Cairo before the war in North Africa broke out, including university academics. Possibly as a reflection of that, there were two strands of literary activity and publication during the years 1942–1944. There was the &quot;Personal Landscape&quot; group centred on the publication of that name, founded by Lawrence Durrell, Robin Fedden and Bernard Spencer. There was also the &quot;&quot; group, which produced a magazine and the &quot;Oasis&quot; series of anthologies. To oversimplify, the first group produced poetic reputations, while the second, founded by servicemen, broadcast appeals and collected an archive of 17,000 poems written at the period. 

Poets such as Terence Tiller and G. S. Fraser had a foot in both camps. Keith Douglas, the iconic war poet, was associated with the &quot;Personal Landscape&quot; group. Alan Rook, John Gawsworth and John Waller published in &quot;Salamander&quot;.

Several of the Cairo poets appeared in the &#x27;Poets in Uniform&#x27; issue of Tambimuttu&#x27;s &quot;Poetry London&quot; early in 1941.

An English literary presence persisted after the war, in the persons of P. H. Newby, Robert Liddell, Denys Johnson-Davies, Hilary Corke and D. J. Enright.

==Poets in &quot;Personal Landscape. An Anthology of Exile&quot; (1945)==

Keith Douglas, Lawrence Durrell, Harold Edwards, Robin Fedden, G. S. Fraser, Diana Gould, Charles Johnston, Robert Liddell, Olivia Manning, Elie Papadimitiou, Hugh Gordon Porteus, George Seferis, Ruth Speirs, Bernard Spencer, Terence Tiller, David Gwyn Williams.

<text>The Carpi or Carpiani were a tribe that resided in the eastern parts of modern Romania in the historical region of Moldavia from no later than c. AD 140 and until at least AD 318.

The ethnic affiliation of the Carpi remains disputed, as there is no direct evidence in the surviving ancient literary sources. A strong body of modern scholarly opinion considers that the Carpi were a tribe of the Dacian nation. Other scholars have linked the Carpi to a variety of ethnic groups, including Sarmatians, Thracians, Slavs, Germanic peoples, Balts and Celts.

About a century after their earliest mention by Ptolemy, during which time their relations with Rome appear to have been peaceful, the Carpi emerged in c. 238 as among Rome&#x27;s most persistent enemies. In the period AD 250–270, the Carpi were an important component of a loose coalition of transdanubian barbarian tribes that also included Germanic and Sarmatian elements. These were responsible for a series of large and devastating invasions of the Balkan regions of the empire which nearly caused its disintegration in the &quot;Crisis of the Third Century&quot;.

In the period 270–318, the Roman &quot;military emperors&quot; acted to remove the Carpi threat to the empire&#x27;s borders. Multiple crushing defeats were inflicted on the Carpi in 273, 297, 298-308 and in 317. After each, massive numbers of Carpi were forcibly transferred by the Roman military to the Roman province of Pannonia (modern western Hungary) as part of the emperors&#x27; policy of repopulating the devastated Danubian provinces with surrendered barbarian tribes. Since the Carpi are no longer mentioned in known documents after 318, it is possible that the Carpi were largely removed from the Carpathian region by c. 318 or, if any remained, it is possible that they mingled with other peoples resident or immigrating into Moldavia, such as the Sarmatians or Goths.

== Name etymology ==
The Greco-Romans called this people the &quot;Carpi&quot; or &quot;Carpiani&quot;. Probably the earliest mention of them, under the name &quot;Καρπιανοί&quot; (&quot;Carpiani&quot; in Latin) is in the &quot;Geographia&quot; of the 2nd-century Greek geographer Ptolemy, composed c. AD 140.
The name Carpi or Carpiani may derive from the same root as the name of the Carpathian mountain range that they occupied, also first mentioned by Ptolemy under the name &quot;Καρπάτης - Karpátēs&quot;.
The root may be the putative Proto-Indo-European word *&quot;ker/sker&quot;, meaning &quot;peak&quot; or &quot;cliff&quot; (cf. Lithuanian &quot;karpyti&quot; &quot;mountain peaks looking like a saw&quot;, Albanian &quot;karpë&quot; &quot;rock&quot;, Romanian &quot;(ş)carpă&quot; &quot;precipice&quot;, Sanskrit &quot;kar&quot; &quot;cut&quot;, and Latin &quot;scarpa&quot;, cfr. Italian &quot;scarpata&quot;, English &quot;escarpment&quot;). Scholars who support this derivation are divided between those who believe the Carpi gave their name to the mountain range (i.e. the name means &quot;mountains of the Carpi&quot;) and those who claim the reverse. In the latter case, &quot;Carpiani&quot; could mean simply &quot;people of the Carpathians&quot;. But the similarity between the two names may be coincidence, and they may derive from different roots. For example, it has been suggested that the name may derive from the Slavic root-word &quot;krepu&quot; meaning &quot;strong&quot; or &quot;brave&quot;.

Romanian scholar Vasile Pârvan considered that the following peoples recorded in ancient sources correspond to Ptolemy&#x27;s &quot;Karpiani&quot;:
* the &quot;Kallipidai&quot; mentioned in the &quot;Histories&quot; of Herodotus (composed around 430 BC) as residing in the region of the river &quot;Borysthenes&quot; (Dnieper)
* the &quot;Karpídai&quot; around the mouth of the river &quot;Tyras&quot; (Dniester) recorded in a fragment of Pseudo-Scymnus (composed c. 90 BC)
* the &quot;Harpii&quot;, located near the Danube Delta, mentioned by Ptolemy himself.
If so, their locations could imply that the Carpi had very gradually migrated westwards in the period 400 BC - AD 140, a view championed by Kahrstedt. These names&#x27; common element &quot;carp-&quot; appears frequently in Dacian and Thracian placenames and personal names. But there is no consensus that these groups are in fact Carpi. Bichir suggests that they were Thraco-Dacian tribes distantly related to the Carpi.

== Territory ==
The &quot;Barrington Atlas of the Greek and Roman World&quot; places the Carpi between the river &quot;Hierasus&quot; (Siret) and the river &quot;Porata&quot; (Prut)

However, it is not possible to reliably define the territories of these groups due to the imprecision of the ancient geographical sources. Also, it is likely that in many areas, ethnic groups overlapped and the ethnic map was a patchwork of dispersed sub-groups. The Sarmatians and Bastarnae are attested, in both literature and archaeology, all over Wallachia, Moldavia and Bessarabia. It is likely that, when Greco-Roman sources refer to conflicts with the Costoboci, Carpi or Goths, they are referring to coalitions of different groups under the currently hegemonic tribe. Given the Carpi&#x27;s repeated raids South of the Danube and clashes with the Romans during the 3rd century, it is likely by ca. 230, the Carpi had extended their hegemony over eastern Wallachia, previously dominated by the Roxolani.

== Material culture ==
There is no dispute among scholars that some Decebalic-era Dacian settlements in Moldavia (mostly west of the Siret, with a few on the east bank (including &quot;Piroboridava&quot;, identified with Poiana-Tecuci), were abandoned by 106, most likely, according to Bichir, as a result of the Roman conquest of Dacia. From this time, Bichir identifies two distinct cultures in Moldavia, existing side by side. One, a sedentary culture, labelled &quot;Daco-Carpic&quot; by Bichir, started around 106 and disappeared around 318; A smaller culture displayed characteristics usually associated with nomadic peoples from the Eurasian steppes, labelled &quot;Sarmatian&quot; by Bichir.
By 1976, 117 sedentary settlements had been identified, the great majority (89) located West of the Siret (thus inside Dacia&#x27;s borders as defined by Ptolemy). The inhabitants lived in both surface-dwellings and sunken-floor huts. The single-roomed surface-dwellings were made of wattle and beaten-earth, usually of rectangular or square form, varying from 9 sq m to 30 sq m in size. Each contained a clay hearth placed at the centre of the dwelling. The more numerous sunken-earth huts are usually of oval or round shape. The sedentary people generally cremated their dead, both adults and children, according to Bichir: all the 43 purely &quot;Daco-Carpic&quot; (sedentary) cemeteries used only cremation. The ashes from the cremation were, in the great majority of cases, buried inside urns. Some graves contained grave-goods, but no weapons other than a single dagger. Mundane goods include knives, keys, and belt-buckles; valuable goods include Sarmatian-style mirrors, silver ear-rings, gold pendants and beads.

Pottery found in sedentary sites includes the hand-made &quot;porous&quot; type, grey wheel-made ware, red-fired pottery and imported Roman ware. Bichir describes the first two as continuing Dacian La Tène pottery, and points to the presence of the so-called &quot;Dacian cup&quot;, a cup of distinctive design, as evidence of a Dacian base to this culture. However, he admits that the pottery also shows Roman and Sarmatian influence. The sedentary folk appear to have been generally illiterate, as no &quot;Daco-Carpic&quot; inscription was ever found during the very intensive excavations carried out in the region.

The sedentary culture did not issue its own coinage. However, Roman coinage circulated &quot;intensely&quot; in the Carpi&#x27;s territory, according to Bichir. This is based on the large number of coin-hoards found in Moldavia (90), and about 100 isolated coins. However, the circulation of Roman coins seems to have virtually ceased after 218, as no coin-hoards and only 7 isolated coins have been found from after Caracalla, who ruled AD 211–218.

Nomadic-culture graves are predominantly of the inhumation type, found, by 1976, in 38 places in Moldavia. These are predominantly found on the plains, rarely on the Carpathian foothills (i.e. East of the Siret), either singly or in small groups of 2-13 graves, including men, women and children. The great majority of nomadic-culture graves are flat (non-tumular), in contrast to nomadic barrow-graves found from the Dniester region eastwards. However, some secondary barrow-burials (i.e. using pre-existing barrows) have been found, mostly dating from 200 onwards. The nomadic graves always contain grave-goods, often including weapons, and mirrors engraved with tamgas (ritual or tribal symbols associated with nomadic steppe cultures).

Six cemeteries in Bichir&#x27;s list contain both cremation and inhumation graves. At the Poieneşti site (the only one fully investigated by 1976), 6 adults and 17 children were buried (compared with 62 cremated). Of these, 2 adults and 7 children were found to have artificially elongated crania. This custom, achieved by tightly binding an infant&#x27;s skull during its early growth phase, is associated with steppe nomads. Bichir identifies the adults as nomads and the children as the progeny of mixed nomad-sedentary marriages.

From the ratio of sedentary to nomadic graves, Bichir concludes that the sedentary folk constituted the majority of the population of Moldavia. In the mixed cemeteries documented by Bichir, nomadic graves constitute about 28% of the total. However, in Moldavia as a whole, nomadic graves represent no more than 1% of all graves.

After 318, according to Bichir, the &quot;Daco-Carpic&quot; culture was in Moldavia replaced by the Sîntana-de-Mureş &quot;variant&quot; of the Chernyakhov culture common to much of the North-Pontic region of south eastern Europe in the period 200–400.

== Ethno-linguistic affiliation ==
There is no direct evidence in surviving Roman imperial era sources, literary or epigraphic, regarding the language of the Carpi. In the near-total absence of inscriptions in the &quot;barbaricum&quot;, the only valid (though not infallible) indicator of the linguistic affiliation of barbarian peoples are personal names, which can sometimes be ascribed to a linguistic group. However, not a single Carpi personal name is preserved in the surviving ancient sources, other than the name &quot;Carpi&quot; itself, which cannot be ascribed with confidence to any linguistic group.

According to traditional Romanian historiography, as well as to several non-Romanian scholars, the Carpi were a people of the Dacian tongue and culture Heather, who supports this view, suggests that the Carpi name was adopted as the collective name of the Free Dacian tribes when they achieved a degree of political unification in the early 3rd century.

However, a significant number of scholars dispute that the Carpi were ethnic Dacians, and have identified them variously as Sarmatians, Daco-Thracians, Celts, or even proto-Slavs. This is because the region between the rivers Siret and Dniester was of great ethnic diversity during the Roman imperial era, the &quot;Barrington Atlas&quot; listing Agathyrsi, Bastarnae, &quot;Britolagai&quot;, Costoboci, Roxolani, &quot;Thrakes&quot;, and Tyragetae. Also, some modern authors surmise the existence of ethnic groups formed &quot;in loco&quot; from mixed origins (but mostly with an indigenous Dacian/Sarmatian base e.g. the Goths).

The evidence to support a Dacian identity:
# Archaeology: Pottery and other artifacts, identified as &quot;Dacian-style&quot; by archaeologists such as Bichir, were discovered at sites in the region of Moldavia presumed inhabited by the Carpi in the period AD 100-300 (e.g. at Poieneşti, near Vaslui) as well as in burial sites. In particular, Bichir points to a cup of unusual design and to the &quot;corded&quot; decoration of pots, as characteristically Dacian. However, determination of the Carpi&#x27;s ethno-linguistic affiliation using the typology, or by the relative quantity, of finds has been questioned by Niculescu. Roger Batty concurs that the presence of &quot;Dacian-style&quot; artefacts attests to the material level of the indigenes, but does not prove their ethnicity. These objections reflect modern archaeological theory, which considers that material cultures are not a reliable guide to the ethnic identity, and even less to the language, of the people in question (which may, in any case, have changed over time).
# Zosimus, a Byzantine chronicler writing around AD 500, records an invasion of Rome&#x27;s Danubian provinces in 381 by a barbarian coalition of Huns, Sciri and &quot;Karpodakai&quot; (&quot;Carpo-Dacians&quot;). The latter term has been taken by some scholars as &#x27;proof&#x27; of the Carpi&#x27;s Dacian ethnicity. But this is the only literary evidence linking the Carpi name to that of the Dacians, and Zosimus is regarded by numerous modern scholars as an unreliable chronicler. One historian accords Zosimus &quot;an unsurpassable claim to be regarded as the worst of all the extant Greek historians of the Roman Empire [...] it would be tedious to catalogue all the instances where this historian has falsely transcribed names, not to mention his confusion of events...&quot;. In any case, the term is ambiguous. It has also been interpreted as the &quot;Carpi and the Dacians&quot; or &quot;the Carpi mixed with the Dacians&quot;. According to the eminent classical scholar Kahrstedt, the term does not refer to the Carpi at all but to Free Dacians, who occupied the territory of the Carpi, after the latter were deported by the Romans. He argues that, in ancient Greek, the first part of the term could only have a geographical meaning: i.e. &quot;Karpodakai&quot; means &quot;the Dacians from the land of the Carpi&quot;. In the same vein, it has also been interpreted as &quot;the Dacians of the Carpathians&quot;. (Compare Tyragetae, supposedly meaning &quot;the Getae from the Tyras region&quot;). It is possible that the entire Carpi people were transferred to the Roman empire by 318, which is supported by literary and archaeological evidence: Bichir notes that the culture which he calls &quot;Daco-Carpic&quot; ended in about 318. If so, then Zosimus&#x27; &quot;Karpodakai&quot; could not be referring to the Carpi.
# Inscription AE (1965) 223 is engraved on the tombstone of Publius Aelius Proculinus, a centurion of the Cohors VII Praetoria (Philippiana) &quot;missed (i.e. killed) in the Dacian War at Castellum Carporum&quot; (&quot;bello Dacico desiderato ad castellum Carporum&quot;). According to Bichir and others, this refers to the war against the Carpi conducted by emperor Philip the Arab in 246/7, and the &quot;castellum Carporum&quot; (literally: &quot;fort of the Carpi&quot;) is the stronghold of the Carpi, mentioned by Zosimus, where the final battle of the campaign took place. By implication, he argues, this supports the view that the Carpi were Dacians. But other scholars identify the &quot;castellum Carporum&quot; as a Roman auxiliary fort on the lower Danube, evidenced by the &quot;vicus Carporum&quot;, a fort-satellite village opposite Carsium (Hârșova, Rom.), mentioned by Ammianus Marcellinus. Cuff argues that Proculinus was actually in command of this fort when he was killed.

A possible argument against Dacian ethnicity is that Roman emperors did not use the long-established imperial victory-title (&quot;cognomen ex virtute&quot;) &quot;Dacicus Maximus&quot; (literally: &quot;the greatest Dacian&quot;) for victories over the Carpi, but instead adopted the separate title &quot;Carpicus Maximus&quot;. This was introduced by Philip the Arab in 247, the first Roman emperor to defeat the Carpi in person. Such titles were usually ethnographic, not geographical (i.e. &quot;Dacicus&quot; meant &quot;victorious over the Dacians&quot;, not &quot;victorious in Dacia&quot;) The emperors Aurelian and Constantine I claimed both the &quot;Dacicus&quot; and &quot;Carpicus&quot; titles. The existence of a separate victory-title for the Carpi may imply that the Romans did not consider the Carpi to be ethnic-Dacians. The same argument may also apply against a Sarmatian or Germanic identity for the Carpi, as &quot;Sarmaticus&quot; and &quot;Germanicus&quot; were also established titles in Philip&#x27;s time. However, the victory-title argument is not conclusive, as 3rd-century emperors used three titles simultaneously to indicate victories against the Iranians, &quot;Parthicus&quot; (&quot;Victorious over the Parthians&quot;), &quot;Medicus&quot; (&quot;Medes&quot;) and &quot;Persicus&quot; (&quot;Persians&quot;).
Note: *Some of the titles above are attested to in multiple inscriptions.

== Conflict with Rome ==
Although the Carpi are recorded as resident in the Dacian region from at least the 140&#x27;s onwards, they are not mentioned in Roman accounts of several campaigns in the Dacian region in the second century. For example, in Rome&#x27;s vast and protracted conflict with the trans-danubian tribes, known as the Marcomannic Wars (166-80), during which Dacia province suffered at least two major invasions (167, 170), only their neighbours the Costoboci are mentioned specifically. Silence on the role of the Carpi in these conflicts may imply that they were Roman allies in this period.

Around AD 200 a phase of major population movements started in the European &quot;barbaricum&quot; (the region outside the borders of the empire). The cause of this dislocation is unknown, but an important factor may have been the Antonine Plague (165-180), a devastating smallpox pandemic, which may have killed 15-30% of the Roman empire&#x27;s inhabitants. The impact on the barbarian regions would have resulted in many weakened tribes and empty regions that may have induced the stronger tribes to expand. A well-known example is the Goths. These were probably recorded by the Roman historian Tacitus, under the name &quot;Gotones&quot;, as inhabiting the area East of the Vistula river in central Poland in AD 100. By 250, the Goths had moved South into western Ukraine and were frequently raiding the empire in conjunction with local tribes.

It was in this context of upheaval that, in the middle of the third century, the Carpi emerged as a major barbarian threat to Rome&#x27;s lower Danubian provinces. They were described by Jordanes as &quot;a race of men very eager to make war, and often hostile to the Romans&quot;. A series of major Carpi incursions into the empire are recorded, either alone or in alliance with their neighbouring Sarmatian or Germanic tribes (including Roxolani, Bastarnae, Goths). However, the role of the Carpi in the coalition&#x27;s incursions is not always clear, as the most comprehensive account, that of the 6th-century chronicler Zosimus, is chronologically confused and often denotes the participants under the vague term &quot;Scythians&quot; (meaning inhabitants of the geographical region called Scythia (i.e. roughly modern Ukraine), not ethnic Scythians).

The involvement of the Carpi in attacks by the Free Dacians into Roman Dacia is also uncertain. Supporters of a Dacian ethnicity for the Carpi have tended to assume that they participated in campaigns where Roman emperors claimed the title &quot;Dacicus Maximus&quot;, in addition to those resulting in a &quot;Carpicus Maximus&quot; acclamation. But all incursions in which the Carpi are specifically reported by ancient sources were into Moesia Inferior, not Dacia. The following is a list of recorded incursions in which Carpi participation is specifically attested to by the sources:

=== Carpi attacks on the Danubian frontier (238–250) ===
238: The Carpi launched their first recorded major incursion into Roman territory south of the Danube, during the brief joint rule of the adolescent Gordian III and the senators Balbinus and Pupienus Maximus. This was apparently provoked by the refusal of the governor of Moesia Inferior, Tullius Menophilus, to grant the Carpi&#x27;s demand for an annual subsidy to keep the peace, as was already paid to the Goths and other tribes on the lower Danube. This lends support to the possibility that, until this time, the Carpi had been long-term allies of the Romans and were aggrieved that they were in effect penalised for their loyalty. However, the governor succeeded in driving out the Carpi in 239.

245–247: During the rule of emperor Philip the Arab (244-249), the Carpi crossed the Danube and laid waste Moesia Inferior. After the theatre governors failed to repel the invasion, the emperor took personal command and launched a major counter-attack. After a prolonged struggle, the Carpi were driven back across the Danube. Pursued by the Romans into their homeland, the main body of Carpi took refuge in a major stronghold (presumably a hillfort), where they were surrounded and besieged by Philip&#x27;s forces. The remaining Carpi forces, which had scattered, rallied and launched an attempt to relieve the siege. The besieged staged a mass sortie to distract the Romans&#x27; attention from the approach of the relief-force. But the latter were intercepted and routed by Philip&#x27;s &quot;equites Maurorum&quot; (Berber light cavalry from N. Africa). The breakout itself was contained, forcing the Carpi to sue for peace. This was granted to them on apparently lenient terms by Philip, who was eager to conclude the campaign in time for the forthcoming celebrations of the 1,000th anniversary of the City of Rome&#x27;s foundation (April 248). Philip was acclaimed &quot;Carpicus Maximus&quot;.

=== Sarmato-Gothic invasions of the Roman empire (250-270) ===

250-251: The Carpi participated in a massive transdanubian invasion of Moesia and Thrace under the leadership of the Gothic king Kniva. Kniva&#x27;s invasion had apparently been provoked by the termination of the Goths&#x27; annual Roman subsidy by the emperor Philip. Judging by their actions, the invaders&#x27; war aims were limited to pillage: the capture of as many slaves, horses, treasure and other goods as possible to take back to their homelands across the Danube.

Kniva&#x27;s horde apparently included Goths, Taifali and Vandals, as well as some renegade Roman army veterans. Given Zosimus&#x27; description of &quot;Scythians&quot;, it almost certainly included Sarmatian elements such as the Roxolani. In addition, an apparently separate force of Goths and Bastarnae also entered Moesia Inferior, led by Kniva&#x27;s two top lieutenants. Jordanes claims that the barbarians totaled 300,000 men, but Byzantine chroniclers often grossly inflate barbarian numbers, typically by a factor of ten (e.g. Zosimus&#x27; claim that 60,000 Alamanni fell at the Battle of Strasbourg in 357, against the 6,000 recorded by the contemporary and more reliable Ammianus Marcellinus). Thus 30,000 is a more plausible, but still formidable, estimate for Kniva&#x27;s invasion, divided into two divisions. The Carpi contingent numbered 3,000 men, according to Jordanes.

Facing the invasion were the Roman emperor &quot;Trajan&quot; Decius, an experienced general and Philip&#x27;s commander on the Danube front, who had succeeded his patron after the latter was murdered by mutinous troops in 249, and Caius Trebonianus Gallus, who had been appointed governor of Moesia Superior in the previous year by Decius. It appears that, for the purpose of dealing with the threat, Gallus was given command of forces in the frontier forts along the Danube, while the emperor commanded a mobile force of crack units.

After losing two encounters with the Romans in Moesia Inferior, Kniva surprised the emperor by unobservedly crossing the &quot;Haemus&quot; (Balkan) mountains into Thracia, which was largely undefended. The emperor, who was left several days&#x27; march behind, was obliged to rush his army into Thracia by forced marches. At &quot;Beroe&quot; (Stara Zagora, Bulgaria), Kniva launched a surprise attack on the emperor&#x27;s exhausted army, inflicting a major defeat. Decius was obliged to withdraw the remnants of his shattered force to Moesia Inferior and to leave Thracia to be pillaged at will by the barbarians. Kniva&#x27;s horde stormed the city of &quot;Philippopolis&quot; (Plovdiv, Bulgaria) and spent the winter of 250/251 in the province.

In the meantime, Decius rebuilt his field army in Moesia Inferior. In 251, as the barbarian army headed home towards the Danube, laden with a vast quantity of plunder, they were intercepted by the emperor at &quot;Abrittus&quot; in Moesia Inferior. In a hard-fought battle, Kniva&#x27;s main force was routed. The emperor then led his men across a bog in order to engage Kniva&#x27;s reserve force, which guarded the barbarians&#x27; booty. But the emperor had underestimated the difficulty of the terrain: the Romans became immobilised in the mire and reportedly every one of them perished, including the emperor himself, massacred at long range by Kniva&#x27;s archers or drowned.

When news of this disaster reached the remaining legions on the Danube, they proclaimed their commander Gallus emperor. The latter concluded a peace with the Goths, which permitted them to return home with their booty intact and guaranteed resumed subsidies. Although Zosimus denounces the terms as shameful, it was probably the only realistic option open to Gallus in the circumstances.

But Gallus&#x27; resumption of subsidies did not have the desired effect of sustaining peace on the Danube. Hard on the heels of military catastrophe, the Roman army was crippled by the outbreak of a devastating smallpox pandemic, the so-called Plague of Cyprian (251 - c. 270). The effects of the Cyprianic pandemic are described by Zosimus as even worse than the earlier Antonine outbreak, which probably killed 15-30% of the empire&#x27;s inhabitants. The Roman army would have suffered heavy casualties as a result of its close concentration of personnel and frequent movements between provinces, thus probably losing about a third of its strength. Taking advantage of Roman military disarray, the transdanubian barbarians launched repeated massive invasions of imperial territory. The exact number, dates and events of these invasions are uncertain due to the confused and fragmentary nature of the sources. It is possible that there were invasions every year and that parts of the Danubian provinces were occupied by marauding bands of barbarians year-round, during the period 251–270. From Zosimus, the following major events may be discerned:

252-253: The Carpi joined Goths and two Sarmatian tribes (the Urugundi and the Borani) in an invasion of Roman territory, ravaging Moesia and Thrace. (Zosimus states that they then crossed into Asia Minor, but as this is inconsistent with the rest of the narrative, it may be a confusion with the invasion of 256). Roman forces on the lower Danube were unable to prevent them from marauding at will, probably due to their losses at Abrittus and the impact of the plague. Eventually, the barbarians were intercepted on their way home by Aemilianus, commander of the army of Pannonia. At first, his men were fearful of engaging the barbarians, because of their aura of invincibility after Abrittus, but Aemilianus&#x27; leadership steadied them. At an unknown location near the Danube, the Romans launched a surprise attack and scored a complete victory. They chased the barbarians over the river and deep into their homelands, recovering vast quantities of plunder and liberating thousands of Roman civilians who had been abducted. Possibly among the latter was the C. Valerius Serapio (probably a Greek) who dedicated an undated altar found at &quot;Apulum&quot; (Alba Iulia) in Roman Dacia, as thanksgiving for his rescue from the Carpi (&quot;liberatus a Carpis&quot;)

Aemilianus was hailed as emperor by his victorious troops and marched on Rome, where Gallus&#x27; forces killed their leader rather than fight against the Danubian army. However, only three months later, Aemilianus was in turn assassinated by the same troops, who defected to Valerian (reigned 253–260), the commander of forces on the Rhine, who had marched into Italy to rescue Gallus.

Valerian was proclaimed emperor and promptly elevated his son Gallienus (reigned 253–268) as &quot;Augustus&quot; (co-emperor). This father-and-son team presided over the most chaotic period of the empire&#x27;s history before the 5th century. The empire suffered multiple and massive barbarian invasions on the Rhine, Danube and in the East; at least 11 generals launched military coups; the empire was split into three autonomous pieces; and Valerian himself was captured by the Persians and died after several years in their captivity, the first Roman emperor to suffer such a humiliation.

256-257: The Carpi, with the same allies as in 253, burst into Moesia, ravaged Thrace and lay siege unsuccessfully to &quot;Thessalonica&quot; in Macedonia. Valerian and Gallienus were obliged to leave the Balkan theatre to subordinates with inadequate forces, as they were fully occupied, the former in the East fighting the Persians, the latter on the Rhine trying to stem a massive Germanic incursion. The whole of Greece was placed on invasion alert: the Athenians rebuilt their city walls for the first time since they were demolished by the republican general Sulla in 87 BC and the Peloponnesians re-fortified the Isthmus of Corinth. The barbarians were eventually routed by Gallienus&#x27; lieutenant Aureolus, who brought large numbers of prisoners to Rome.

259-260: &quot;The Scythians, including every people of their country&quot; (i.e. including the Carpi) launched a massive invasion over the Danube, taking advantage of the military and political chaos in the empire. It appears that the barbarians divided into two armies. One invaded Greece and, despite its new walls, succeeded in storming and sacking Athens. The other group crossed Illyricum into Italy, and appeared before the walls of Rome, forcing the Roman Senate to arm the civilian population to man the ramparts, as Gallienus was fully occupied on the Rhine fighting a coup d&#x27;état by one of his generals (Postumus). Recognising that there was no possibility of taking the city and sacking it, the Gothic-led host proceeded to ravage the whole of Italy. They were finally driven out by Gallienus&#x27; lieutenant Macrianus, who brought the Rhine army into Italy.

Further major &quot;Scythian&quot; invasions took place in 265-266 and possibly the largest of all, 267-268, which was a seaborne invasion which penetrated the Aegean Sea, landed in Macedonia and proceeded to ravage Thrace. However, it was eventually stopped by the emperor Claudius II Gothicus, who destroyed the barbarian host at Naissus (268). Unlike previous invasions, the Carpi are not mentioned specifically by Zosimus and the other chroniclers and their role is thus uncertain.

=== Defeat and resettlement in the Empire (271-318) ===

The late third century saw the military recovery of the empire under the iron rule of the so-called &quot;Illyrian emperors&quot;, a tightly knit group of career soldiers with shared origins in the Danubian provinces and regiments. Their successors, often their descendants, dominated the empire for over a century (268-379). These not only broke the transdanubian tribes on the battlefield, but also pursued a policy of large-scale resettlement of defeated tribespeople in the Danubian provinces of the empire. This was motivated by the need to re-populate the Danubian provinces, which had been ravaged by plague and barbarian invasions during the period 250–270.

272: The emperor Aurelian (reigned 270–275) scored a major victory over the Carpi, for which he was granted the title &quot;Carpicus Maximus&quot; by the Senate. He then resettled a large number of Carpi prisoners around &quot;Sopiana&quot; (Pécs, Hungary) in the Roman province of Pannonia. This appears to have inaugurated the policy of resettling the Carpi in the empire.

296-305: In 296, the emperor Diocletian (reigned 284–305) went to war against the Carpi, the Romans&#x27; first major conflict with this people since its defeat by Aurelian 23 years earlier. The war ended in 297 with a crushing Roman victory. A panegyric of 297 hails &quot;the recent disasters [suffered by] the Carpi&quot; (&quot;proxima illa ruina Carporum&quot;). Diocletian claimed the title &quot;Carpicus Maximus&quot; for the first time. In 298, Diocletian handed the lower Danube command to his &quot;Caesar&quot; (deputy emperor), Galerius. In an intensive series of campaigns, Galerius inflicted four more defeats on the Carpi in just two years (302-303 inclusive). These victories are attested by the 4 additional &quot;Carpicus&quot; titles claimed by Diocletian and his three imperial colleagues (known as the Tetrarchs. (It was apparently their practice to claim victory-titles collectively, thus all four claimed &quot;Carpicus&quot; titles for the victories achieved by Galerius).

305-311: After acceding as &quot;Augustus&quot; (full emperor) in 305, Galerius is recorded as claiming the &quot;Carpicus&quot; title for a sixth time, at some time during his reign.

318: The emperor Constantine I the Great (reigned 312–337) is recorded as holding the &quot;Carpicus Maximus&quot; title in an inscription of that year. This most likely represents a victory over the Carpi in 316–317, when Constantine is documented as resident in the Balkans for the first time since his appointment as &quot;Caesar&quot; in 306.

Each of these acclamations probably implied the slaying of at least 5,000 Carpi (as traditionally required for the grant of a Triumph in Rome). For the Carpi, these defeats were accompanied by mass deportations and resettlement inside the empire. According to Ammianus, Diocletian&#x27;s regime continued to settle Carpi in Pannonia, and, apparently, in Scythia Minor (i.e. the coastal region of modern Romania). Eutropius reports that &quot;enormous numbers&quot; were transferred. Heather interprets these reports as implying hundreds of thousands of deportees. According to Victor, writing in 361, the entire remaining Carpi people were transferred into the empire.

== Carpi after 318 ==
There are several indications that the Carpi may have been largely eliminated north of the Danube by 318:
# The evidence of Aurelius Victor that all the Carpi were deported to the empire.
# The sheer scale of losses in repeated wars against the Romans (5 wars in a 21-year period 296–317) and subsequent mass deportations.
# The disappearance, c. 318, of the &quot;Daco-Carpic&quot; culture in Moldavia, according to Bichir.
# The absence of any mention of the transdanubian Carpi in the contemporary history of Ammianus, whose surviving books provide a detailed account of the period 353–378. (Ammianus does mention the Carpi twice, but only those settled inside the empire).
# The fact that the &quot;Carpicus&quot; title was not claimed after 318.

Many historians dispute that the Carpi were eliminated from the Carpathian region and argue that many Carpi remained, e.g. Millar and Batty. Beyond 318, specific evidence of Carpi continuity is limited to Zosimus&#x27; reference to &quot;Karpodakai&quot; joining in a barbarian invasion of the empire in the 380s.

Even if some Carpi did remain north of the Danube, it is clear that they lost their political independence, according to Heather. After the death of Constantine, the Wallachian plain and Moldavia fell under the domination of the Thervingi branch of the Gothic nation, as evidenced by the existence of a substantial Gothic kingdom in the mid fourth century. Transylvania appears to have been dominated in the fourth century by another, probably Germanic group, the Taifals. However, the Taifali appear also to have been under Gothic suzerainty.

These Germanic kingdoms were after 350 overwhelmed by the Huns, resulting in the great Gothic-led migration of Transdanubians across the Danube that culminated in the Roman disaster at the Battle of Adrianople in 378. The Carpi are nowhere mentioned in Ammianus&#x27; detailed account of these epic events, suggesting that any who remained north of the Danube had probably lost their distinct identity.

<text>A displacer beast is a fictional evil feline creature created for the &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; role-playing game in 1975; it has subsequently been included in every edition of the game to the present day.

==Description==
A displacer beast is a magical six-legged black panther-like feline with a pair of tentacles growing from its shoulders; the beast has an innate &quot;displacement&quot; ability, causing it appear to be several feet away from its actual location. &quot;These mighty predators are typically found in the Feywild&quot;, &quot;an alternate plane of existence&quot; home to &quot;D&amp;D&quot;&#x27;s version of fairies.

==Publication history==
===&quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; (1974–1976)===
The displacer beast was created for &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;, first introduced in the game&#x27;s supplement, &quot;Greyhawk&quot; (1975), as &quot;a puma-like creature with six legs and a pair of tentacles which grow from its shoulders.&quot; The concept of the creature was borrowed from A. E. van Vogt&#x27;s 1939 science fiction story &quot;Black Destroyer&quot;, which described a feline-like creature called a coeurl. Van Vogt later incorporated the coeurl into the novel &quot;The Voyage of the Space Beagle&quot; (1950).

===&quot;Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; 1st edition (1977–1988)===
The displacer beast appears in the first edition &quot;Monster Manual&quot; (1977), where it is described as a vaguely puma-like beast that always appears to be three feet away from its actual position. David M. Ewalt, in his book &quot;Of Dice and Men&quot;, discussed several monsters appearing in the original &quot;Monster Manual&quot;, describing displacer beasts as looking like &quot;pumas with thorn-covered tentacles growing out of their shoulders&quot;.

The displacer beast was detailed in &quot;Dragon&quot; #109 (May 1986), in the &quot;Ecology of the Displacer Beast&quot;.

===&quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; (1977–1999)===
This edition of the &quot;D&amp;D&quot; game included its own version of the displacer beast, in the &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons Basic Set&quot; (1977), and &quot;Expert Set&quot; (1981 &amp; 1983), and was also later featured in the &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons Game&quot; set (1991), the &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons Rules Cyclopedia&quot; (1991), the &quot;Classic Dungeons &amp; Dragons Game&quot; set (1994), and the &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons Adventure Game&quot; set (1999).

===&quot;Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; 2nd edition (1989–1999)===
The displacer beast appears in the &quot;Monstrous Compendium Volume One&quot; (1989), and is reprinted in the &quot;Monstrous Manual&quot; (1993).

===&quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; 3.0 &amp; 3.5 editions (2000–2007)===
The displacer beast appears in the 3rd edition &quot;Monster Manual&quot; (2000) and then in the 3.5 edition &quot;Monster Manual&quot; (2003). This edition also described the displacer beast pack lord. For this edition, Wizards of the Coast considered the displacer beast to be an original product of &quot;D&amp;D&quot; and was therefore categorized as a &quot;Product Identity&quot;; as such it was not released under its Open Game License.

===&quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; 4th edition (2008–2013)===
The displacer beast appears in the 4th edition &quot;Monster Manual&quot; (2008), and again a description is included for the displacer beast pack lord.

===&quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; 5th edition (2014)===
The displacer beast appears in the 5th edition &quot;Monster Manual&quot; (2014). It is considered a copyrighted original creation for the &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; game.

==Other media==
A displacer beast appears in the film &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Honor Among Thieves&quot;. A displacer beast kitten is a &quot;&quot; card created as part of the &quot;&quot; crossover.

==Reception==
Rob Bricken from io9 named the displacer beast as the 2nd most memorable &quot;D&amp;D&quot; monster. Reviewers also counted it among the &quot;most iconic&quot; and &quot;fan-favorite&quot; monsters of the game. It was considered an &quot;old-school&quot; and &quot;most enduring&quot; monster, having been part of the game from its earliest stages. Author Ben Riggs remarked on the movie version of the displacer beast: &quot;The design of the creature is just so fantastic. It&#x27;s creepy. Even though it&#x27;s a panther with a couple tentacles, at first you&#x27;re creeped out&quot;. David M. Marshall remarked that the displacer beast is one of the elements &quot;which disrupts the roughly period [medieval] atmosphere of the game&quot;.

<text>Erik Zabel (; born 7 July 1970) is a German former professional road bicycle racer who raced for most of his career with Team Telekom. With 152 professional wins and 211 wins in his career, he is considered by some to be one of the greatest German cyclists and cycling sprinters of all time. Zabel won a record nine points classifications in grands tours including the points classification in the Tour de France six consecutive years between 1996 and 2001 and the points classification in the Vuelta a España in 2002, 2003 and 2004. Zabel won the Milan–San Remo four times and numerous six-day track events. He was one of the few road cyclists of recent times who raced all year, including track cycling in winter. For season 2012 he joined as sprint coach. He previously held that same position with the team until their dissolution. Zabel admitted to doping from 1996 to 2003. He is the father of cyclist Rick Zabel.

==Early life and amateur career==

Zabel grew up in East Berlin, in the borough Marzahn. His father Detlev was a professional cyclist. His first international success as a junior was at the track world championship when he was third in the team pursuit on the East German team. In 1988 he was fifth in the points race. In 1989, as a 19-year-old, he was included in the East German national track team for professionals. That year he became national champion of East Germany in the individual pursuit.

After the Fall of the Berlin Wall he moved to Dortmund and became part of the amateur team RC Olympia Dortmund, led by Hennes Junkermann. He was second at the first national road championship of re-unified Germany in 1991, first at the regional championship of North Rhine-Westphalia and was included in the amateur German team for the World Championship in August. In 1992 he made name as a strong sprinter, winning the green jersey in the Peace Race and taking several stage wins in stage races. In July he was fourth in the road race of the 1992 Olympic Games in Barcelona, where he won the sprint of the peloton.

==Professional career==

===1993–1995: The early years===
In late 1992 he turned professional with the small German team Union-Frondenberg, before changing in 1993 to Team Telekom where he further developed as a sprinter. On 27 April 1994 Zabel tested positive for clostebol metabolites in Veenendaal–Veenendaal. He was fined 3000 Swiss francs and lost 50 points. A suspension on probation was cancelled. Later that year he won Paris–Tours in a mass sprint, his first win in a classic race.

In 1995 he won two stages on the Tour de France, his first success on a grand tour.

===1996–1999: Green jerseys and classics victories===

In 1996 he won again two stages in the Tour de France and won the points classification. He took over the green jersey in the 10th stage and wore it until the end of the Tour. That year his Telekom team took first and second place in the general classification as well, with Bjarne Riis and Jan Ullrich respectively.

In 1997 Zabel won his first monument classic, Milan–San Remo. He was the only sprinter in a group of forty to make it to the finish and easily won the sprint. Later that year, he won three stages on the Tour de France and secured his second green jersey.

In 1998 he won Milan–San Remo a second time and became national road champion of Germany. He won his third green jersey in the Tour de France, however this time without a stage victory.

In 1999 he was second in Milan–San Remo, winning the peloton sprint behind Andrei Tchmil who had broken clear in the final kilometer and managed to maintain his effort. He won the important German semi-classic Rund um den Henninger Turm in Frankfurt and won his fourth consecutive green jersey, equalling Sean Kelly&#x27;s record, again without winning a stage.

===2000–2002: World number one===
In 2000 he won two legs of the UCI Road World Cup in spring: Milan–San Remo a third time and a surprise win in the Amstel Gold Race, beating Michael Boogerd in a bunch sprint. In the summer he won an unprecedented fifth green jersey, thereby surpassing Kelly&#x27;s previous record. At the end of the year, he was the best overall in the World Cup and number two on UCI World Ranking.

In 2001 he won Milan–San Remo a fourth time, the most since cycling legend Eddy Merckx, earning him the nickname &quot;Signore Milano-Sanremo&quot; in Italy. He won the points classification in the Tour de France a sixth consecutive time, winning three stages furthermore. Zabel&#x27;s unique streak of six green jerseys was owed to his all-round ability: he was one of the strongest sprinters, but could also climb reasonably well. This meant that, apart from taking the lead in the general classification in the Tour de France thanks to time bonuses, he could pick up further victories when other sprinters had retired and take the green jersey (as symbol for the leader of the points classification) to Paris. One memorable victory in securing the green jersey was in the 2001 Tour de France, when his competition with Australian Stuart O&#x27;Grady lasted from the first week until the final stage in Paris, where Zabel&#x27;s better placing took the green jersey off O&#x27;Grady&#x27;s shoulders. Later that summer, he also won the HEW Cyclassics, Germany&#x27;s biggest one-day classic, and his seventh World Cup race. In September he won three stages, consecutive, in the Vuelta a España and was fifth in the World Championship road race in Lisbon.

2001 turned out to be his most successful year ever. At the end of the year, he had won 29 races and was number one on the closing standings of the world ranking.

In 2002 he missed the breakaway in Milan–San Remo but won Rund um den Henninger Turm a second time. In the summer, he failed to win a seventh consecutive green jersey in the Tour de France. He won one stage victory, his twelfth in total, but was ultimately beaten by Australian Robbie McEwen in the final points classification. He won the points classification in the Vuelta a España instead, without winning a stage. In Zolder, in Belgium, he finished third at the World championship in a peloton sprint behind Mario Cipollini and Robbie McEwen. At the end of the year, he maintained his number one position on the world ranking.

Zabel would have retroactively been awarded the Vélo d&#x27;Or for his performances of 2000 and 2001, but after Lance Armstrong was stripped of the titles in 2012–2013, as with each other races, the 2nd-place finisher was not promoted to 1st.

===2003–2005: Vuelta success and podium places===

In 2003 he became national road champion of Germany for a second time, but failed to win a stage in the Tour de France and was third in the final points classification. He won two stages in the Vuelta and again won the points classification of the race. In October he won Paris–Tours for the second time in his career and was awarded the unofficial Ruban Jaune for winning the race in a record average speed for a one-day race of 47.55 km per hour. The record stood until 2010 when Óscar Freire won Paris–Tours riding at an average of speed of 47.73 km per hour. He ended the year as number two on the world ranking behind Paolo Bettini.

In 2004 Zabel began the season losing what would have been his fifth Milan–San Remo. He looked secure to win the sprint, but lifted his arms to celebrate too early and was ultimately foiled by Óscar Freire. He was third in the points classification of the Tour de France and first in the Vuelta points classification, but despite numerous second and third places, he didn&#x27;t win a stage. His first place in the Vuelta was also his ninth win in a points classification of a grand tour, an all-time record. At the 2004 Olympics in Athens, he was again fourth in the road race, again winning the sprint behind three escapees and so missing an olympic medal twelve years after Barcelona. In October, after 9 victories and 18 second places throughout the season, he ended the year as he had begun it: second behind Freire, this time in the world championship in Verona.

In 2005 Zabel became the first to win Rund um den Henninger-Turm in Frankfurt a third time, in his first win on the season. In May he participated for the first time in his career in the Giro d&#x27;Italia, seeking the only points classification he had not yet won, but failed to win a stage and was sixth in the points ranking. His T-Mobile Team, keen on winning the Tour de France with Jan Ullrich, decided not to include him in the selection for that year&#x27;s Tour, much to the discontent of Zabel, who declared at the start of the HEW Cyclassics that he would be leaving the team at the end of the year. He rode the Vuelta, but was unable to win a stage or the points classification despite multiple second places behind Alessandro Petacchi, and played no role in the World Championship in Madrid. In October he won Paris–Tours a third time, equalling the record in the classic of Gustave Danneels, Paul Maye and Guido Reybrouck.

===2006–2008: Team Milram===
At 35, Zabel left his team Telekom after 13 years, and signed on for the Italian-German team Milram in 2006, where he teamed up with Alessandro Petacchi. Petacchi was considered the fastest sprinter in the world by then and would focus on an Italian program, but the Italian broke his knee in the Giro, making Zabel the leader of the team that season. He had to wait until 24 May to take his first win of the season, a stage in the Bayern Rundfahrt. In the Tour, he was the team leader in the absence of a GC contender, and was ultimately second in the points classification, but his best stage results were two third places. In the Vuelta he won two stages, his first ProTour wins in 2006, before heading to the world championship. In Salzburg, he finished second in a three-man sprint with Paolo Bettini and Alejandro Valverde, his third podium finish in the world championships.

In 2007 he won two stages in the Bayern Rundfahrt and one in the Tour de Suisse. He was again captain in the team selection for the Tour de France, after Alessandro Petacchi had been suspended for a positive salbutamol test. He wore the green jersey one day, was twice second and once third in a stage, but was third once more in the final points classification. In July he won one stage in the Deutschland Tour, his 13th in total, and won the race&#x27;s points classification for the seventh time. In September he won the seventh stage in the Tour of Spain, ahead of world champion Bettini, totalling eight stage victories in the Vuelta throughout his career.
In 2008 he won one race, a stage win in the Tour of Valencia early in the season. In his last participation in the Tour de France, at age 38, he was once more third in the final points classification. In September 2008 Zabel stated he would retire the following month after 16 years as a professional cyclist with 209 professional road victories and many more podium finishes. In December 2008 he joined the Columbia team as an advisor, to work alongside riders such as Mark Cavendish, André Greipel and Mark Renshaw.

==Doping confession==
On 24 May 2007, Zabel and former Team Telekom teammate Rolf Aldag admitted using EPO to prepare for the 1996 Tour de France. Zabel told at a press conference he experimented with it for a week and stopped due to side effects. He apologized for lying about using EPO in the past. His confession was triggered by accusations by former Team Telekom masseur Jef d&#x27;Hont and the confessions of Bert Dietz, Udo Bölts and Christian Henn, all former members of Team Telekom. D&#x27;Hont&#x27;s book, of which excerpts were printed in the German political magazine &quot;Der Spiegel&quot; in April 2007, accused members of Team Telekom of systematic doping with EPO in the mid-1990s.

His name was also on the list of doping tests published by the French Senate on 24 July 2013 that were collected during the 1998 Tour de France and found positive for EPO when retested in 2004. As a result, Zabel was suspended from his coaching role with Team Katusha and resigned his membership of the UCI&#x27;s Professional Cycling Council.

Days later, Zabel finally admitted to sueddeutsche.de and revealed the level of his truth-bending. He told the German publication that he actually used the substance between 1996 and 2003, as well as other banned products and methods. &quot;EPO, cortisone, then even blood doping: it is still a big deal&quot;, he said.

<doc id="921009" wikidata="Q464205" url="?curid=921009" title="1996 Summer Olympics medal table">
<text>The 1996 Summer Olympics, officially known as the Games of the XXVI Olympiad, were a summer multi-sport event held in Atlanta, Georgia, United States from July 19 to August 4, 1996. A total of 10,318 athletes representing 197 National Olympic Committees (NOCs) participated. The games featured 271 events in 26 sports across 37 disciplines, including the Olympic debuts of beach volleyball, mountain biking and softball. A total of 24 countries made their Summer Olympic debuts in Atlanta, including 11 former Soviet republics participating for the first time as independent nations.

79 nations received at least one medal, with 53 of them winning at least one gold medal, both of which were new records.
Armenia, Belarus, Burundi, Costa Rica, Croatia, Czech Republic, Ecuador, Hong Kong, Kazakhstan, Nigeria, Slovakia, Syria, Thailand, and Ukraine won their nations&#x27; first Summer Olympic gold medals. They were also the first Summer Olympic medals of any kind for Armenia, Belarus, Burundi, Czech Republic, Ecuador, Hong Kong, Kazakhstan, Slovakia, and Ukraine. Meanwhile, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Moldova, Mozambique, Tonga, and Uzbekistan won their first Summer Olympic medals.

Athletes from the host nation of the United States won the most gold medals, with 44, and the most medals overall, with 101. It marked the first time the United States led the medal count in both gold and overall medals since 1984 and the first at a non-boycotted Olympics since 1968. Among individual participants, American swimmer Amy Van Dyken won the most gold medals with four, while Russian gymnast Alexei Nemov won the most medals overall with six (two gold, one silver, and three bronze).

==Medal table==

The medal table is based on information provided by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and is consistent with IOC conventional sorting in its published medal tables. The table uses the Olympic medal table sorting method. By default, the table is ordered by the number of gold medals the athletes from a nation have won, where a nation is an entity represented by a NOC. The number of silver medals is taken into consideration next and then the number of bronze medals. If teams are still tied, equal ranking is given and they are listed alphabetically by their IOC country code.

Events in boxing resulted in bronze medals being awarded to each of the competitors who lost their semi-final matches, as opposed to them taking part in a third place tiebreaker. Events in judo used a repechage system which also resulted in two bronze medals being awarded.

In the men&#x27;s rings and women&#x27;s uneven bars events, there were ties for second place which resulted in two silver medals and no bronze medals being issued in each event. In the women&#x27;s artistic individual all-around, two bronze medals were awarded due to a tie. Additionally, in the men&#x27;s horizontal bars, three bronze medals were awarded due to a tie.

<text>Frink Park is a 17.2 acre (70,000 m2) park in the Leschi neighborhood of Seattle, Washington. It is a heavily wooded hillside and ravine through which flows Frink Creek. Most of the park is bounded by 31st Avenue S. in the west, 34th Avenue S. in the east, and the rights-of-way of S. Main Street in the north and S. King Street in the south. Lake Washington Boulevard S. and S. Frink Place are recreational drives within the park.

Frink Park borders Leschi Park in its northwest corner.

The land for the park was donated to the city in 1906 by parks commissioner John M. Frink. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2019.

<text>Xabier Arzalluz Antia (24 August 1932 – 28 February 2019) was a Basque politician, leader of the Basque Nationalist Party from 1979 until 2004. He was a nationalist and a Christian Democrat, considered during the period one of the most powerful politicians in the Basque Autonomous Community, making strategic decisions for the party he led from 1986 onwards.

==Early years==
Arzallus was born in Azkoitia, Gipuzkoa, Basque Country. From a Carlist family, he studied in a Jesuit school in Durango. During the 1960s, he received degrees in Law and Philosophy at the University of Zaragoza. He spent some time in Frankfurt-am-Main preparing a thesis on German Christian Democracy and studying Theology. He became a Jesuit priest. After another period in Frankfurt and Madrid, he worked at the Jesuit University of Deusto. In 1969, he joined the clandestine Basque Nationalist Party, mentored by the pre-war leader Juan de Ajuriaguerra. In 1971, he was admitted to the leadership of the Biscayan branch. He was laicized and got married.

==Spanish transition to democracy==

In 1977 and 1979, he was elected as a member of the Spanish Congress of Deputies for the PNV in Gipuzkoa. His talks with Adolfo Suárez paved the way to the Statute of Autonomy of the Basque Country, contributing to its wording. He designed accordingly a strategy for the party along the lines of that Statute, called the &quot;Spirit of Arriaga&quot;. In 1979, he resigned his seat and succeeded Carlos Garaikoetxea as PNV leader, a position that he would hold until 2004. During his rule the PNV maintained its dominant position in the political life of the Autonomous Community of the Basque Country.

==Later career==

Later in the 1980s, Garaikoetxea, the ruling lehendakari, struggled for autonomy from the party. Arzalluz, however, asserted the authority of the organization over individual members. This issue, among others, led in 1984 to a schism within the PNV, and to the creation of a new party Eusko Alkartasuna, led by Garaikoetxea.

Arzalluz was the main spokesman for the Basque Nationalist Party, publishing his opinions every Sunday in the Basque newspaper Deia and in many public speeches during PNV rallies, some of which took place on Party Day and on the Day of the Basque Homeland. While liked by PNV voters, he was the least popular party leader among the general Spanish public in 1997.

He had a reciprocal admiration for the Italian Christian Democrat leaders Francesco Cossiga and Giulio Andreotti. In spite of his contacts with European Christian Democrats, the PNV had to leave the Christian Democrat International in the 1990s because of pressure from the Spanish conservative People&#x27;s Party. Besides his political role, he had also been a professor of Constitutional Law (in the Basque language) at the University of Deusto in Bilbao until 1999.

==Death==
He died in Bilbao on 28 February 2019 aged 86.

<text>The term total analysis system (TAS) describes a device that combines and automates all necessary steps for the chemical analysis of a sample (e.g., sampling, sample transport, filtration, dilution, chemical reactions, separation, and detection). Most current total analysis systems are &quot;micro&quot; total analysis systems which utilize the principles of microfluidics.

Total analysis systems are designed to shrink the processes carried out in a laboratory to a chip-sized lab-on-a-chip. Due to this, it can be more cost-effective to carry out complex tests when considering chip technologies, sample sizes, and analysis time. Total analysis systems can also reduce the exposure of toxic chemicals for lab personnel. This technology can also be used in point-of-care testing or point-of-use diagnostics, which do not require skilled technicians.

<text>WGTV (channel 8) is a PBS member television station licensed to Athens, Georgia, United States, a legacy of the station&#x27;s early years as a service of the University of Georgia (UGA). Owned by the Georgia Public Telecommunications Commission (technically under the Georgia Board of Regents, along with the University System of Georgia), it is the flagship station of the statewide Georgia Public Broadcasting (GPB) television network, serving the Atlanta metropolitan area from a transmitter atop Stone Mountain just east of Atlanta.

WGTV has been part of GPB proper since January 1, 1982, after the state government ordered the consolidation of the two broadcasting entities. It was a separate entity owned by UGA for its first 22 years, though it supplied much of the non-instructional programming seen on the state&#x27;s educational network.

==History==
WGTV began broadcasting on May 23, 1960. It was licensed to the University of Georgia and operated out of the Georgia Center for Continuing Education. Channel 8 had been placed in Athens by the 1952 &quot;Sixth Report and Order&quot;, which ended the TV freeze of 1948 and revised the table of television station allotments nationally; it had previously been in Atlanta, used by WSB-TV on channel 8 and then by its facility successor WLTV, which moved to channel 11 as a result of the order in 1953.

While WGTV was a separate station from the Atlanta-based Georgia Educational TV Network, which had transmitters in the rest of the state, WGTV provided all of the non-instructional evening programming that aired on its transmitters. WGTV moved its transmitter to Stone Mountain in 1969, adding Atlanta to its coverage area; the university had desired for channel 8 to be receivable in the state capital since 1958.

In November 1980, Governor George Busbee proposed the consolidation of WGTV with the state&#x27;s network of transmitters into a new Georgia Public Telecommunications Council and also called for said body to negotiate to buy Atlanta&#x27;s public television station, WETV, from the Atlanta Board of Education. The Georgia state senate approved the bill, but it stalled in the House of Representatives due to the objections of Athens-area members and those involved with the UGA station. After the legislative session ended, Governor Busbee revived the proposal by executive order. On January 1, 1982, the new council took operational control of WGTV, and the combined service rebranded as Georgia Public Television; by June 1982, after the expiration of remaining program contracts, WGTV was fully incorporated into the network, and UGA&#x27;s role was reduced to program supplier.

===Analog-to-digital conversion===
WGTV shut down its analog signal, over VHF channel 8, on February 17, 2009, at 11:59 p.m., to conclude the federally mandated transition from analog to digital television. The station&#x27;s digital signal relocated from its pre-transition VHF channel 12 to channel 8. The station played the original sign-off video with outdoor scenes around Georgia set to the tune of &quot;Georgia On My Mind&quot; before permanently ceasing transmission. A final message at the end of the video read &quot;Presented in fond remembrance of the analog broadcast era on Georgia Public Broadcasting.&quot; The transition to digital ended nearly 49 years of analog broadcasting by WGTV.

WGTV&#x27;s analog signal was the strongest of the GPB TV network, covering most of the northern part of Georgia, extending in about a radius from the transmitter site. WGTV&#x27;s digital/HDTV facility began broadcasting on December 20, 2007, on channel 12. However, it was at very low power, unable to be received through much (if not most) of metro Atlanta. It moved from channel 12 to full power on channel 8 after the analog shutdown in February 2009, using the same digital transmitter re-tuned to use the channel 8 antenna. This selection, made without conflict in the first-round digital channel election, is due to WDEF-TV in Chattanooga opting to stay digital on channel 12. WGTV was originally assigned channel 22 for DTV operations, but requested the frequency allotment change to channel 12 by the FCC.

The analog station had an effective radiated power (ERP) of 316 kilowatts (the maximum for high VHF), at height above average terrain (HAAT). The temporary digital station had an ERP of only 16 kW at . The previous 21 kW and current 17.3 kW are still well below the limit of 63 kW for digital stations on high VHF (channels 7 to 13), which would also be legally equivalent to what it had on analog. Because of this, reception is still difficult in much of metro Atlanta. This was expected to improve once the station changed to physical channel 7 in 2020, after May 1 (when other stations in phase 9 finish) but no later than July 3 (the end of phase 10, the final phase of the national repacking of all stations to below channel 37). The omnidirectional signal will increase to 62 kW toward the north-northwest with a directional antenna, but areas south and southeast of a line from Carrollton to Athens will not see an improvement in signal strength. The lowest signal strengths (18 kW) will be in slight nulls toward the southwest (to protect Alabama Public Television station WCIQ TV 7) and toward the east. Despite the channel change at noon on July 3, the station is still difficult to receive, as it has actually dropped to 17.3 kW under special temporary authority (STA), which expires at the end of 2020. The temporary antenna model listed is different from both the old channel 8 antenna and the channel 7 model listed in its permit, but all are at the same height, indicating that the old antenna must be removed before the new permanent one can be installed, tested, and switched over to for full-power operation.

The settlement goes back to a Slavonic settlement named Turguo in the shire of Neletici. There was presumably a wooden Slavonic castle located on the site of the present-day Hartenfels castle.

In the 10th century it fell under the rule of the Holy Roman Empire, and a stone castle was built, around which the settlement congregated. A market is attested in 1119. The town was located on the important trade route, the Via Regia Lusatiae inferioris, between Leipzig and Frankfurt an der Oder that crossed the river Elbe at a ford east of Torgau.

Torgau belonged to the duchy of Saxe-Wittenberg, which in 1356 was raised to be the Electorate of Saxony. After the last Ascanian duke died without issue in 1423, the Electorate passed to the Wettin dynasty, which took up its residence at Torgau.

Following the Treaty of Leipzig partition of the Wettin inheritance on 26 August 1485, Torgau fell to the Ernestine line. Frederick III, Elector of Saxony and his successors had Hartenfels Castle at Torgau built by architect Conrad Pflüger and his successor Konrad Krebs.

The Ernestine court resided mainly in Torgau and in Weimar. From 1525 onward, Torgau became the sole residence. Hartenfels Castle is the largest completely preserved castle of the early Renaissance in Germany. After the Battle of Mühlberg in 1547, Torgau fell to the Albertine line.

During the Reformation, the town council closed all cloisters in 1523. Citizens of Torgau destroyed paintings and statues of saints in the churches and stormed the Franciscan monastery.

After Martin Luther had driven Andreas Karlstadt from Saxony in 1524, he enforced the expulsion of Karlstadt&#x27;s followers from Torgau in 1529. Katharina von Bora, the widow of Luther, died in Torgau and is buried there in the Marienkirche. The court chapel, constructed in 1543-44 by Nikolaus Gromann, was consecrated by Luther on 5 October 1544; it is thus the second oldest newly constructed Protestant church in the world, after the court chapel of Neuburg Castle which was consecrated in 1543.

The Torgauer Artikel, a draft of the Augsburg Confession, was composed by Luther, Melanchthon, Bugenhagen and Jonas in the electoral superindenture in 1530 (Wintergrün). The Lutheran Formula of Concord was written in Torgau in 1576.

The first German opera, Heinrich Schütz&#x27;s &quot;Dafne&quot;, was presented at the court in Torgau in 1627.

In the Battle of Torgau, fought on 3 November 1760, a Prussian army under the command of King Friedrich the Great defeated a larger Austrian army under the command of Field Marshal Leopold Josef Graf Daun, a major battle of the Seven Years&#x27; War. After the Congress of Vienna, it was passed to Prussia in 1815.

===World War II===

The town is where, during World War II, the United States Army from the west and the Red Army from the east met during the invasion of Germany on 25 April 1945, remembered as &quot;Elbe Day&quot;.

Units of the U.S. First Army and the Soviet First Ukrainian Front met on the bridge at Torgau, and at Lorenzkirch (near Strehla), 20 miles to the south. The unit commanders met the following day at Torgau for an official handshake. This marked the beginning of the line of contact between Soviet and American forces, but not the finalized occupation zones. In fact, the area surrounding Torgau, initially occupied by U.S. forces, was given over to Soviet forces in compliance with the Yalta Agreement.

After the war, in 1949, the film &quot;Encounter at the Elbe&quot; was released by Mosfilm about the meeting of both armies.

Torgau is home to one of the prisons in which Reinhold Eggers spent his postwar imprisonment after he had been sentenced by the Soviets. He had been the security officer at Oflag IV-C during the war in Colditz Castle.

===Post–World War II===

After the war, the Soviet secret police agency NKVD established its Special Camps Nos. 8 and 10 in Fort Zinna and in the nearby Seydlitz barracks. Germans and some Soviet citizens were interned here or served sentences passed by the Soviet military tribunals. The East German People&#x27;s Police used the Fort Zinna prison from 1950 to 1990 as a penitentiary. In the 1950s, it primarily housed political prisoners.

The Memorial Site Torgau (formerly Documentation and Informationcenter Torgau (DIZ)), founded in 1991 and now under the administration of the Saxon Memorial Foundation for the commemoration of the victims of political despotism, researches and presents the history of the Torgau prisons in the permanent exhibition „Courage and Helplessness“. Recent commentary distinguishes the camps run by the Nazis and the Soviets. 

After World War II, Torgau was initially the district center of the state of Saxony Anhalt in East Germany. After the dissolution of the states of East Germany in 1952, it became part of Bezirk Leipzig. In 1990, after the Unification of Germany, it became part of the Leipzig region of the state of Saxony. In 2008 it became the center of the Nordsachsen district.

==Geography==
The town Torgau consists of Torgau proper and the following &quot;Ortschaften,&quot; or municipal divisions:

*Beckwitz
*Graditz
*Loßwig
*Mehderitzsch
*Melpitz
*Staupitz
*Weßnig
*Zinna
Beckwitz, Loßwig, Mehderitzsch, Staupitz and Weßnig were part of the former municipality Pflückuff, which was absorbed into Torgau on 1 January 2009.

==Population development==


==Sights==
Sights include the historic town center, restored since German reunification, a brewery museum, the monument for the meeting of the Russian and American troops on the Elbe, and a Russian military cemetery. Carl Loebner Torgau is claimed to be the world&#x27;s oldest toy store. The first documented mention of the shop in the history of Torgau goes back to the year 1685.

The early Renaissance Hartenfels Castle dominates the town. The chapel was built in 1544 (designed by Nickel Gromann) and combines late Gothic with early Renaissance elements. It was consecrated by Martin Luther on 5 October 1544. Brown bears are still kept in the moat.

<doc id="921038" wikidata="Q692708" url="?curid=921038" title="I Fought the Law">
<text>&quot;I Fought the Law&quot; is a song written by Sonny Curtis of the Crickets and popularized by a cover by the Bobby Fuller Four, becoming a top-ten hit for the band in 1966. Their version of the song was ranked No. 175 on the &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; list of The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time in 2004, and the same year was named one of the 500 &quot;Songs that Shaped Rock&quot; by the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

Thrre are several notable covers of the song. A version by Sam Neely charted in 1975. The song was also recorded by the Clash in 1979. A version with different lyrics was recorded by the Dead Kennedys in 1978.

==Original song==
The song was written in 1958 by Sonny Curtis, and recorded in 1959 when he joined the Crickets, taking the place of Buddy Holly on guitar. Joe B. Mauldin and Jerry Allison continued their positions on the stand-up bass and drums, respectively, while Earl Sinks filled the role for vocals. The song was included on their 1960 album, &quot;In Style with the Crickets&quot;, and the following year appeared as the B-side of their single, &quot;A Sweet Love&quot;. The song received very little airplay.

Milwaukee&#x27;s Paul Stefen and the Royal Lancers covered the song in 1962; it provided them with a local hit, but it did not make the national charts. In 1964, Sammy Masters recorded his cover of the song. That same year, the song was recorded by Bobby Fuller and his band on his own Exeter label in El Paso, which solidified the band&#x27;s popularity in the West Texas area with one of his biggest local hits.

==Bobby Fuller Four version==

After enjoying regional success in Texas, Bobby Fuller and his band decided to switch to a major label—Del-Fi Records under Mustang Records—and they became known as The Bobby Fuller Four. While producing minor hits, the band broke the national top ten when they re-recorded &quot;I Fought the Law&quot; in 1965 with Bobby Fuller (vocals, guitar), Randy Fuller (backing vocals, bass guitar), Jim Reese (backing vocals, guitar), and DeWayne Quirico (drums).

Just six months after the song made its first appearance on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top 100 chart, Fuller was found dead from asphyxiation in his mother&#x27;s car in a parking lot near his Los Angeles apartment. The police declared the death an apparent suicide, but others believe that he was murdered.

The mono and stereo mixes differ in both Fuller&#x27;s vocals and the guitar riffs.

In 2015, the Bobby Fuller Four version of the song was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame.

===Chart positions===

==The Clash version==

In mid-1978, the Clash were working on their second album, &quot;Give &#x27;Em Enough Rope&quot;. Singer Joe Strummer and guitarist Mick Jones flew to San Francisco to record overdubs in September–October at the Automatt studio. The owner of the Automatt kept his collection of classic jukeboxes distributed around the various rooms of the studio complex. Strummer and Jones heard the Bobby Fuller version of &quot;I Fought the Law&quot; for the first time on one of the jukeboxes. Their version first appeared on the EP &quot;The Cost of Living&quot; in May 1979 in the UK, and later that year was made part of the American edition of the Clash&#x27;s eponymous album. This cover version helped gain the Clash their first taste of airplay in the States, and is one of the best-known cover versions of the song. A live recording of the song, performed at the Lyceum Theatre, West End, London, on December 28, 1978, features as the last piece of the 1980 film &quot;Rude Boy&quot; directed by Jack Hazan and David Mingay. The Clash were dressed all in black for that gig, and the song, at that stage, was considered the film&#x27;s title song. On July 26, 1979, &quot;I Fought the Law&quot; was the first single by the band to be released in the United States.

In 1988, CBS Records re-issued the single (catalog number) in CD, 12-inch and 7-inch vinyl formats, with &quot;City of the Dead&quot; (2:24) and &quot;1977&quot; (1:40) as its 7-inch B-side. The song is featured as a downloadable track in the music video game series &quot;Rock Band&quot;.

In 1989, during Operation Just Cause, the U.S. military surrounded the Apostolic Nunciature in Panama while trying to capture Manuel Noriega, the strongman of Panama. U.S. forces blasted loud rock music—including &quot;I Fought the Law&quot; by the Clash—to put pressure on Noriega to give himself up.

In 2012, the Clash&#x27;s version of the song was featured in the video game &quot;Sleeping Dogs&quot;, as part of a karaoke mini-game.

The song appears during the end credits of the 2014 film &quot;RoboCop&quot;, the 2016 film &quot;War on Everyone&quot; and the 2018 video game &quot;Lego DC Super-Villains&quot;.

===Recording===
Some of the percussive noises on the record were made by hitting the pipes on a urinal. Jones told &quot;Uncut&quot; magazine in 2015, &quot;Yeah, we went into the toilets and banged on the pipes with hammers to make it sound like a chain gang. Y&#x27;know, that &#x27;clang! clang!&#x27; at the end? And then at the very end you can hear a &#x27;sssszzhhh!&#x27; That&#x27;s it flushing!&quot;

==Other versions==
*Hank Williams Jr. recorded a version of the song in 1978, which was released on &quot;Family Tradition&quot; (1979). Released as the album&#x27;s first single, it was a moderate hit and peaked at number 15 on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Hot Country Singles &amp; Tracks chart, giving Williams his first Top 15 single in four years.
*Dead Kennedys adapted &quot;I Fought the Law&quot; shortly after San Francisco politician Dan White murdered city Supervisor Harvey Milk and Mayor George Moscone in 1978. Most of the lyrics were re-written so the song was from White&#x27;s point of view; the chorus was changed to &quot;I fought the law, and I won&quot;, with the final line in the final chorus changed to &quot;I am the law, so I won.&quot; The song portrays White as someone who got away with first-degree premeditated murder and is unrepentant about it and specifically cites his use of the diminished responsibility defense. It also makes use of the reference &quot;Twinkie defense&quot;, where lead singer Jello Biafra sings &quot;Twinkies are the best friend I ever had&quot;. During Biafra&#x27;s campaign for the office of Mayor of San Francisco, he proposed erecting statues of Dan White around the city and allowing the parks department to sell eggs and tomatoes with which people could pelt the statues.
*Sam Neely&#x27;s version of the song went to No. 54 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; pop charts and no. 61 on the country charts in 1975. Another country version by the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band went to No. 66 in 1992.
*Green Day&#x27;s version of the song was used in 2004 for a Pepsi/iTunes commercial that premiered during Super Bowl XXXVIII.
*&quot;I Fought the Lloyds&quot; was a comedy version released in 2008 by British band Oystar in support of the campaign by Lloyds TSB customers mounting legal challenges to get their charges refunded. In this version lyrics were changed; the key line became &quot;I fought the Lloyds and Lloyds lost&quot;. It reached No. 25 on the UK Singles Chart.
*Colin Farrell recorded a version in 2003 for the Irish black comedy crime film &quot;Intermission&quot; directed by John Crowley and written by Mark O&#x27;Rowe.

<text>Berbera (; , ) is the capital of the Sahil region of Somaliland and is the main sea port of the country, located approximately 160 km from the national capital, Hargeisa. Berbera is a coastal city and was the former capital of the British Somaliland protectorate before Hargeisa. It also served as a major port of the Ifat, Adal and Isaaq sultanates from the 13th to 19th centuries.

In antiquity, Berbera was part of a chain of commercial port cities along the Somali seaboard. During the early modern period, Berbera was the most important place of trade in the Somali Peninsula. It later served as the capital of the British Somaliland protectorate from 1884 to 1941, when it was replaced by Hargeisa. In 1960, the British Somaliland protectorate gained independence as the State of Somaliland and united five days later with the Trust Territory of Somalia (the former Italian Somalia) to form the Somali Republic. Located strategically on the oil route, the city has a deep seaport, which serves as the region&#x27;s main commercial harbour.

== Etymology ==
The name Berbera comes from the Somali phrase &quot;beri-beri&quot;, meaning occasionally. Before it became a major port city, Berbera was a seasonal settlement, only inhabited during cooler months. Residents still head for milder weather in the summer, a vacation tradition called &quot;xagaa-bax&quot;, which is also common in other coastal cities (e.g. Djibouti, Bosaso). 

According to the Royal Asiatic Society, the name could be derived from the Arabic word &quot;barbarah&quot;, meaning &quot;talking much, shouting&quot;.

==History==
===Antiquity===

Berbera was part of the classical Somali city-states that engaged in a lucrative trade network connecting Somali merchants with Phoenicia, Ptolemic Egypt, Ancient Greece, Parthian Persia, Saba, Nabataea and the Roman Empire. Somali sailors used the ancient Somali maritime vessel known as the &quot;beden&quot; to transport their cargo.

Berbera preserves the ancient name of the coast along the southern shore of the Gulf of Aden. It is believed to be the ancient port of &quot;Malao&quot; () described as 800 stadia beyond the city of the Avalites, described in the eighth chapter of the Periplus of the Erythraean Sea, which was written by a Greek merchant in the first century AD. In the &quot;Periplus&quot; it is described as: 

===Middle Ages===

Duan Chengshi, a Chinese Tang dynasty scholar, described in his written work of AD 863 the slave trade, ivory trade, and ambergris trade of Bobali, which is thought to be Berbera. The great city was also later mentioned by the Islamic traveller Ibn Sa&#x27;id as well as Ibn Battuta in the thirteenth century.

In Abu&#x27;l-Fida&#x27;s, &quot;A Sketch of the Countries&quot; (), the present-day Gulf of Aden was called the Gulf of Berbera, which shows how important Berbera was in both regional and international trade during the medieval period.
Legendary Arab explorer Ahmad ibn Mājid wrote of Berbera and a few other notable landmarks and ports of the northern Somali coast and referred to what is now the Gulf of Aden as the Gulf of Berbera. He also included Zeila and its archipelago, Siyara, Heis, Alula, Ruguda, Maydh, El-Sheikh and El-Darad.

Berbera was an important and well built settlement that served as a major harbor port for several successive Somali Kingdoms in the Middle Ages like the early Adal Kingdom, Ifat Sultanate and Adal Sultanate.

Berbera, along with Zeila, were the two most important ports situated inside the Adal Sultanate, and they provided vital political and commercial links with the wider Islamic World:

Along with other ports and settlements in East Africa, explorers Ludovico di Varthema, Duarte Barbosa and Leo Africanus wrote brief accounts of the port town of Berbera in the early sixteenth century, mainly detailing her historic trading links with Aden and Khambat (Cambay).

Duarte Barbosa&#x27;s brief account of Berbera:

Further on, on the same coast, is a town of the Moors [Muslims] called Barbara; it has a port, at which many ships of Adeni and Cambay touch with their merchandise, and from there those of Cambay carry away much gold, and ivory, and other things, and those of Aden take many provisions, meat, honey, and wax, because, as they say, it is a very abundant country.

Not long after their departure from Zeila and Berbera, the Portuguese fleet under Lopo Soares de Albergaria and António de Saldanha sacked both port towns between 1516 and 1518.

According to Selman Reis, an ambitious Ottoman Red Sea admiral, Berbera was rich with pearls, and the amount of merchandise and trade consisting of &quot;gold, musk and ivory&quot; present at Berbera, on the Somali coast, was described by Selman as &quot;limitless&quot;.

===Precolonialism===


One of the earliest precolonial accounts comes from Ibrahim Punkar, who wrote a memoir in 1801 and letter in 1809 to the Governor of Bombay John Duncan. Noting that Berbera had 5-6 towers with armed guards, he would go to describe the trade and general outlook of the city. Further noting the Somali inhabitants adhering to the Shafi&#x27;i school of Sunni Islam significant trade came from Harar in the interior alongside Gondar and Shewa. Cloth, rice and tobacco came from Kutch in Gujarat and Muscat with Mocha, Jeddah and Al Mukalla being the source of dates and tin. Punkar stated that the Somalis of the area were skilled musketeers and possessed powerful cavalry and knowledge of archery, but were often internally divided except for when united against common enemies. All foreigners including Arabs and Indians who often frequented Berbera were prohibited from venturing further inland, lest they access the lucrative trade of Harar directly and bypass the Somalis.

One certainty about Berbera over the following centuries was that it was the site of an annual fair, held between October and April, which Mordechai Abir describes as &quot;among the most important commercial events of the east coast of Africa.&quot; The major Somali sub-clans of the Isaaq in Somaliland, caravans from Harar and the interior, and Banyan merchants from Porbandar, Mangalore and Mumbai gathered to trade. All of this was kept secret from European merchants. Lieutenant C. J. Cruttenden, who wrote a memoir describing this portion of the Somali coast dated 12 May 1848, provided an account of the Berbera fair and an account of the historic environs of the town: &quot;an aqueduct of stone and chunam, some nine miles [15 km] in length&quot;, which had once emptied into a presently dry reservoir adjacent to the ruins of a mosque. He explored part of its course from the reservoir past a number of tombs built of stones taken from the aqueduct to reach a spring, above which lay &quot;the remains of a small fort or tower of chunam and stone ... on the hill-side immediately over the spring.&quot; Cruttenden noted that in &quot;style it was different to any houses now found on the Somali coast&quot;, and concluded with noting the presence in &quot;the neighbourhood of the fort above mentioned [an] abundance of broken glass and pottery ... from which I infer that it was a place of considerable antiquity; but, though diligent search was made, no traces of inscriptions could be discovered.&quot;

Berbera was the most important port in the Somali Peninsula between the 18th–19th centuries. For centuries, Berbera had extensive trade relations with several historic ports in Arabia and the Indian subcontinent. Additionally, the Somali and Ethiopian interiors were very dependent on Berbera for trade, where most of the goods for export arrived from. During the 1833 trading season, the port town swelled up to 70,000 people, and upwards of 6,000 camels laden with goods arrived from the interior within a single day. Berbera was the main marketplace in the entire Somali seaboard for various goods procured from the interior, such as livestock, coffee, frankincense, myrrh, acacia gum, saffron, feathers, wax, ghee, hide (skin), gold and ivory. In the trading season of 1840, French explorer Charles-Xavier Rochet d&#x27;Héricourt visited Berbera and estimated the total exports of the season to be around thirteen times greater than that of Massawa.

According to a trade journal published in 1856, Berbera was described as “the freest port in the world, and the most important trading place on the whole Arabian Gulf.”:

“The only seaports of importance on this coast are Feyla [Zeila] and Berbera; the former is an Arabian colony, dependent of Mocha, but Berbera is independent of any foreign power. It is, without having the name, the freest port in the world, and the most important trading place on the whole Arabian Gulf. From the beginning of November to the end of April, a large fair assembles in Berbera, and caravans of 6,000 camels at a time come from the interior loaded with coffee, (considered superior to Mocha in Bombay), gum, ivory, hides, skins, grain, cattle, and sour milk, the substitute of fermented drinks in these regions; also much cattle is brought there for the Aden market.”

Historically, the port of Berbera was controlled indigenously between the mercantile Reer Ahmed Nur (Ayyal Ahmed) and Reer Yunis Nuh (Ayyal Yunis) sub-clans of the Sa&#x27;ad Musa, Habr Awal. These two sub-clans effectively administered the trade of the town, especially in the dealings of all transactions and brokerage between various parties to issuing protection agreements towards the foreign Arab and Indian traders. In the year 1845, the two sub-clans had a dissension over the control of the trade of Berbera, which lead to a wider altercation where each side sought outside support. With the backing of Haji Sharmarke Ali Saleh, the Reer Ahmed Nuh drove out their kinsmen and declared themselves the sole commercial masters of Berbera. The defeated Reer Yunis Nuh moved westwards and established the port of Bulhar which later, for a brief period, became a trading rival to nearby Berbera. Sharmarke Ali Saleh&#x27;s actions were a political ruse to control Berbera for himself, which he achieved for several years.

Berbera commanded most of the trade traffic with the Somali and Ethiopian interiors. The two main caravan trade routes from Berbera extended to Harar and Shewa in the west, and to the Shebelle basin in the south (although some caravans traveled to/from as far as the Jubba River). Moreover, the inland caravan trade routes were also concurrently used as pilgrim routes during the trading season by Somali Hajj pilgrims who resided in the deep interior.

In addition, Mocha, Aden, Jeddah and several other ports in Arabia had constant contact with Berbera in regard to general trade and commerce. In the early years of the nineteenth century, the local Somalis of Berbera (Habr Awal clan) had a navigation act where they excluded Arab vessels and brought the goods and produce of the interior in their own ships to the Arabian ports:

Berbera held an annual fair during the cool rain-free months between October and April. This long drawn out market handled immense quantities of coffee, gum Arabic, myrrh and other commodities. These goods in the early nineteenth century were almost exclusively handled by Somalis who, Salt says, had &quot;a kind of navigation act by which they exclude the Arab vessels from their ports and bring the produce of their country either to Aden or Mocha in their own dows.&quot;

In much of the 19th century, the trade between Berbera and Aden was so important to the later that when disturbances effected the Berbera trading season, Aden too suffered as a result. According to Captain Haines, who was then the colonial administrator of Aden (1839-1854), 80% of Aden&#x27;s revenue in 1848 was derived from duties charged on imported goods from Berbera. Additionally, most of the coffee imported by Mocha (centre of the coffee trade in early modern times) arrived via Somali merchants from Berbera, who procured the coffee beans from the environs of Harar. Although the coffee beans were grown in Harar (present-day Ethiopia), the coffee was named &quot;Berbera Coffee&quot; in the international market, and the beans were considered superior to the locally grown varieties in Yemen.
The British explorer Richard Burton made two visits to this port, and his second visit was marred by an attack on his camp by a group of local Somali warriors, and although Burton was able to escape to Aden, one of his companions was killed. Burton, recognizing the importance of the port city wrote:

By 1869, a sub-clan of the Reer Ahmed Nur (Ayyal Ahmed, Habr Awal) were operating a fort in the port town and it was manned by several hired guards armed with muskets and fiercely loyal to them. A British officer visiting the city from Aden noted the guards would not betray the Reer Ahmed Nur save death.

====Battle====

When a British vessel named the &quot;Mary Anne&quot; attempted to dock in Berbera&#x27;s port in 1825 it was attacked and multiple members of the crew were massacred by the Habr Awal. In response the Royal Navy enforced a blockade and some accounts narrate a bombardment of the city. In 1827 two years later the British arrived and extended an offer to relieve the blockade which had halted Berbera&#x27;s lucrative trade in exchange for indemnity. Following this offer the Battle of Berbera 1827 broke out. After the Habr Awal defeat, 15,000 Spanish dollars was to be paid by the Habr Awal leaders for the destruction of the ship and loss of life.

In the 1830s, the Isaaq Sultan Farah Guled and Haji Ali penned a letter to Sultan bin Saqr Al Qasimi of Ras Al Khaimah requesting military assistance and joint religious war against the British. This would not materialize as Sultan Saqr was incapacitated by prior Persian Gulf campaign of 1819 and was unable to send aid to Berbera. Alongside their stronghold in the Persian Gulf &amp; Gulf of Oman the Qasimi were very active both militarily and economically in the Gulf of Aden and were given to plunder and attack ships as far west as the Mocha on the Red Sea. They had numerous commercial ties with the Somalis, leading vessels from Ras Al Khaimah and the Persian Gulf to regularly attend trade fairs in the large ports of Berbera and Zeila and were very familiar with the Isaaq.

===British Somaliland===

After signing successive treaties with the various clans of the northern Somali coast between 1884 and 1886, the British established a protectorate in the region referred to as British Somaliland. The British garrisoned the protectorate from Aden and administered it from their British India colony until 1898. British Somaliland was then administered by the Foreign Office until 1905 and afterwards by the Colonial Office.

Despite Berbera&#x27;s strategic location, being the only port with a sheltered harbor on the southern side of the Gulf of Aden (the gateway to the Suez Canal), the British later came to regret their nominal control of the region. In fact, Winston Churchill once visited Berbera in 1907 when he was Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies, and he noted the protectorate be abandoned, since it was &quot;unproductive, inhospitable, and the people are very hostile to occupation.&quot; The stated purposes of the establishment of the protectorate were to &quot;secure a supply market and to exclude the interference of foreign powers.&quot; The British principally viewed the protectorate as a source for supplies of meat for their British Indian outpost in Aden through the maintenance of order in the coastal areas and protection of the caravan routes from the interior. Colonial administration during this period did not extend infrastructure beyond the coast (which left the Somali clans within the protectorate with greater autonomy), and contrasted with the more interventionist colonial experience of Italian Somalia. In the early days of the protectorate, some planned to invest in major infrastructure projects such as the abandoned Berbera-Harar Railway initiative; this was vetoed by parliament because it would harm the cordial agreement (entente cordiale) between France and Britain.
In August 1940, during the East African Campaign, British Somaliland was briefly occupied by Italy after a large invasion force defeated British colonial troops at the Battle of Tug Argan. During this period, the British rounded up soldiers and governmental officials to evacuate them from the territory through Berbera. In total, 7,000 people, including civilians, were evacuated. The Somalis serving in the Somaliland Camel Corps were given the choice of evacuation or disbandment; the majority chose to remain and were allowed to retain their arms. In March 1941, the British forces recaptured the protectorate during Operation Appearance after a six-month occupation. The first WW2 Australian POWs were taken hostage here in 1940.

The British Somaliland protectorate gained its independence on 26 June 1960 as the State of Somaliland, before uniting as planned five days later with the Trust Territory of Somalia (the former Italian Somalia) to form the Somali Republic.

===Modernity===

In the post-independence period, Berbera was administered as the part of the North-Western province of the Somali Republic. It served as the main livestock port of the republic and in the 1970s and 1980s, nearly all of the livestock exports went out through the port of Berbera via Isaaq livestock traders. The entire livestock exports accounted to upwards of 90% of the Somali Republic&#x27;s entire export figures in a given year, and Berbera&#x27;s exports alone provided over 75% of the nation&#x27;s recorded foreign currency income at the time. The main consumers were the wealthy gulf states and Saudi Arabia in particular.

As early as 1962, The Soviet Union agreed to assist the nascent Somali Republic towards the construction of modern port facilities and a military base, which was completed in 1969 and was called on by sixteen Soviet Ships in 1971. Coinciding with the Ogaden War between The Somali Republic and Ethiopia in 1977, the Soviets left Berbera and the nation as a whole due to a disagreement, leaving the United States to arrive with a $40 million investment and new health facilities in 1980. By 1985, the city had an estimated population of 70,000, with the outbreak of the Somali National Movement (SNM) ousted government troops from the city following aerial bombardments and extrajudicial killings inflicted on the population by the government. With the downfall of General Siad Barre in 1991, the Northern region of the Somali Republic, declared the state of Somaliland, of Somalia. A slow process of infrastructural reconstruction subsequently began in Berbera and other towns in the region.

The city remains a competitive regional port and in 2016 a US$442 million agreement was reached between DP World and the government of Somaliland. The deal involves enhancing and operating the regional trade and logistics hub at the Port of Berbera. The project, which will be phased in, will also involve the setting up of a free zone.

On 1 March 2018, Ethiopia became a major shareholder following an agreement with DP World and the Somaliland Port Authority. DP World holds a 51% stake in the project, Somaliland 30% and Ethiopia the remaining 19%. As part of the agreement, the government of Ethiopia will invest in infrastructure to develop the Berbera Corridor as a trade gateway for the inland country, which is one of the fastest growing countries in the world. There are also plans to construct an additional berth at the Port of Berbera, in line with the Berbera master plan, which DP World has started implementing, while adding new equipment to further improve efficiencies and productivity of the port.

On 24 June 2021, The CEO of DP World officially announced the second phase of the Berbera port upgrade during the inauguration ceremony for the completion of the first phase. The second phase includes extending the new quay from 400 to 1,000 metres, and adding seven more ship-to-shore gantry cranes, bringing the total to ten and enabling the expanded port to handle up to two million TEU containers a year.

The agreement comes as part of a larger government-to-government memorandum of understanding between Government of the United Arab Emirates and the Government of Somaliland to further strengthen their strategic ties. Somalia&#x27;s attempts to obstruct and block the deal were frustrated and failed to stop the project from commencing.

A rail link to Addis Ababa, the capital of Ethiopia, has remained a point of discussion and may materialize. On January 1, 2024, it was announced that Ethiopia signed an agreement with Somaliland to utilize Berbera&#x27;s sea port.

<text>The Pilatus B4-PC11 (also known as the PC-11 in the Pilatus numbering sequence) is an all-metal intermediate glider built by Pilatus Aircraft of Switzerland.

The B4-PC11 is designed to Standard Class specifications, meaning that it has a 15-metre wingspan and no flaps. Air brakes are provided on the top surface of each wing for glidepath control. Construction is aluminium, with foam ribs in the mainplane, fin and tailplane.

==Development==
The design of this glider originated in the 1960s, when the company Firma Rheintalwerke G. Basten (from which the &quot;B&quot; in the original designation is derived) manufactured the first two prototypes. The designers were Ingo Herbst, Manfred Küppers and Rudolf Reinke. The first flight of the first prototype took place on 7 November 1966. However, no series production was started.

In 1972 Pilatus bought the manufacturing licence for the B-4 and renamed it the B4-PC11. In the spring of the same year the first production example (numbered HB-1100) made its first flight.

A total of 322 B4-PC11s of all versions were built by Pilatus by 1980, when the license to manufacture the craft was sold to Nippi Aircraft of Japan, who built only 13 examples, plus a two-seater designated the Nippi B4T.

Subsequently, in 1994, EWMS Technomanagement bought the rights to produce and service the B4-PC11. This company also specializes in renovating and upgrading older B4-PC11 craft. In addition, it manufactures a motorized B4-PC11.

==Variants==
;B4-PC11: Permitted to fly a number of aerobatic manoeuvres, it was not permitted to do inverted loops or flick/snap/quick maneuvers. The B4-PC11 was available with either fixed or retractable landing gear.
;B4-PC11A: developed to perform inverted loops and was also able to handle higher g-forces. 
;B4-PC11AF: released in 1975, with full aerobatic capabilities.
;Lynch B4M1: a motor glider conversion in Australia by John F. Lynch, powered by a König SC 430 engine.

The changes in construction from B4-PC11 through A and AF variants were to add extra ribs through the fuselage section (increasing torsional rigidity, only AF variant), and to modify the control column stops and shorten the rudder, giving greater control surface deflection.

<text>George Bähr (15 March 1666 – 16 March 1738) was a German architect.

==Life==
George Bähr was born into a poor family in Fürstenwalde (now a part of Geising, Saxony), the son of a weaver. The village priest, however, helped pay for his education, and Bähr was able to become a carpenter&#x27;s apprentice in Lauenstein, Saxony.

In 1690, Bähr went to Dresden to start work as a carpenter. His dream was to go to Italy and see the famous buildings there, so in his spare time he studied mechanics, calling himself both an artist and a mechanic, and designing not only castles and palaces but also sketches of organs.

In 1705, aged 39, Bahr was named Dresden&#x27;s City Master Carpenter, although he did not even have a master carpenter&#x27;s certificate. One of Bähr&#x27;s main goals was to modernise the city&#x27;s churches. He believed that the existing buildings did no justice to Protestant church services in particular.

His first building was the Loschwitz Church, a building in the shape of a stretched-out octagon, completed in 1708.

The Dresden &quot;Waisenhauskirche&quot; (Orphanage Church) was built around 1710, followed by the &quot;Dreifaltigkeitskirche&quot; (Trinity Church) in Schmiedeberg, in the Ore Mountains, 1713–1716. Between 1719 and 1726 the church in Forchheim was built, as well as more in Königstein, Hohnstein and Kesselsdorf (all in Saxony) and a considerable amount of housing in Dresden.

But Bähr is most famous for designing the Frauenkirche in Dresden. He was given the task in 1722; in 1726, the design was approved and work began. From 1730, Bähr became the first in Germany to go by the title of “Architect”.

Whilst working on the Frauenkirche, Bähr also oversaw the building of the Dreikönigskirche in Dresden&#x27;s Neustadt area, designed by Matthäus Daniel Pöppelmann.

George Bähr did not live to see the Frauenkirche completed – he died in Dresden, aged 72, and was buried in the church&#x27;s vaults. In 2004, a memorial was built to him in the castle at Lauenstein, where he learned his trade.

==DNA Analysis==
In 2018, researchers from the University of Tuebingen and the Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History in Jena analyzed the genome of George Bähr. They found that he most likely had light skin pigmentation, brown eyes and is of central European origin.

<text>The CDC 8600 was the last of Seymour Cray&#x27;s supercomputer designs while he worked for Control Data Corporation. As the natural successor to the CDC 6600 and CDC 7600, the 8600 was intended to be about 10 times as fast as the 7600, already the fastest computer on the market. The design was essentially four 7600&#x27;s, packed into a very small chassis so they could run at higher clock speeds.

Development started in 1968, shortly after the release of the 7600, but the project soon started to bog down. The dense packaging of the system led to serious reliability problems and difficulty cooling the individual components. By 1971, CDC was having cash-flow problems and the design was still not coming together, prompting Cray to leave the company in 1972. The 8600 design effort was eventually canceled in 1974, and Control Data moved on to the CDC STAR-100 series instead.

Cray revisited the 8600&#x27;s basic design in his Cray-2 of the early 1980s. The introduction of integrated circuits solved the problems with dense packaging and liquid cooling addressed the heat issues. The Cray-2 is very similar to the 8600 both physically and conceptually.

==Design==
In the 1960s, computer design was based on mounting electronic components (transistors, resistors, etc.) on circuit boards. Several boards formed a discrete logic element of the machine, known as a &quot;module&quot;. Overall machine cycle speed is strongly related to the signal path—the length of the wiring—requiring high-speed computers to make their modules as small as possible. This was at odds with the need to make the modules themselves more complex to increase functionality. By the late 1960s, individual components had stopped getting much smaller, so to increase the complexity of the machines, the modules would have to grow. In theory, this could slow the machine down due to signalling delays.

Cray aimed to solve these contradictory problems by doing both; making each module larger and crammed with many more components, while at the same time making the computer as a whole smaller by packing the modules closer together inside the machine. Between the time the 7600 was developed and work on the 8600 began, there had been no process improvements in the components themselves, so any performance improvements had to come solely from packaging. For the new design, they used modules containing eight four-layer circuit boards about 8&quot; by 6&quot;, resulting in a stack the size of a large textbook and using up about 3 kilowatts of power. The modules were then packed into a mainframe chassis that was comparatively tiny, a 16-sided cylinder about one meter (3&#x27;) across and high, sitting on top of a ring of power supplies. The proposed design bears a strong resemblance to the later Cray-2, but even shorter and smaller in diameter.

With all of this power being dissipated in such a small space, cooling was a major design issue. Cray&#x27;s refrigeration engineer, Dean Roush, formerly of Amana, placed a sheet of copper inside each of the circuit boards, removing the heat to a copper block on one end where it was cooled by a freon system. This further increased the weight and complexity of the modules, to the point where each one weighed about . The external cooling system was considerably larger than the machine itself.

The electronic components were likewise improved over previous designs. The main CPU circuits moved to ECL-based logic, enabling a clock speed increase to 125MHz (8ns cycle time) from the 7600&#x27;s 36.4MHz (27.5ns cycle time) an increase of about four times. Main memory was also moved to an ECL implementation and the machine was equipped with a whopping-for-the-times 256k-words (2 megabytes) standard. The design spread the memory across 64 banks for fast access at about 8 ns/word, even though the cycle time of any one bank was about 250 ns. A high-speed core memory with a 20 ns access (overall) was also designed as a backup to the semiconductor memory.

Cray decided that the 8600 would include four complete CPUs sharing the main memory. To improve overall throughput, the machine could operate in a special mode that sent a single instruction to all four processors with different data. This technique, today known as SIMD, reduced the total number of memory accesses because the instruction was only read once, instead of four times. Each processor was about 2.5 times as fast as a 7600, so with all four running the machine as a whole would be about 10 times as fast, at about 100 MFLOPS.

The government made it clear that all future computer purchases would require ASCII processing. To meet this requirement, the 8600 used a 64-bit word (eight eight-bit characters) instead of the earlier 60-bit word (ten six-bit characters) used in the 6600 and 7600. As in prior designs, instructions were &quot;stuffed&quot; into words, with each instruction taking up either 16- or 32-bits (up from 15/30). The 8600 no longer used the A or B registers as in previous designs, and included a set of 16 general-purpose X registers instead. A 6600/7600 Peripheral Processor system was used for I/O, largely unchanged.

Some effort was made to help compatibility between the older machines and the 8600, but the change in word length made this difficult. Instead, floating point formats were retained, allowing Fortran code to port directly.

==Company problems==
In 1971, Control Data was undergoing a &quot;belt tightening&quot; due to the cost of an ongoing lawsuit against IBM, and asked all divisions to reduce their payroll by 10%. Cray begged to Control Data to exempt his division so he could get the 8600 shipping. When Control Data refused this request, he cut his own pay to minimum wage to solve the problem.

By 1972, it appeared that even Cray&#x27;s legendary module design abilities were failing him in the case of the 8600. Reliability was so poor that it appeared impossible to get a whole machine working. This was not the first time this had happened: on the 6600 project Cray had to start over from scratch, and the 7600 was in production for some time before it started working reliably. In this case Cray decided the current design was a dead-end, and told William Norris (CDC&#x27;s CEO) that the only way forward was to redesign the machine from scratch. The finances of the company were dangerous, and Norris decided that he could not take the risk; Cray would have to continue with the current design.

In 1972, Cray decided that he could not work under such conditions, and left CDC to form Cray Research (it was an amicable departure; Norris and other CDC staffers purchased some of the Cray Computer initial stock offering, which turned out to be a lucrative investment for them). For his new work he abandoned the multiprocessor concept, concerned that software of the era would be unable to take full advantage of the CPUs. He may have come to this conclusion after the ILLIAC IV finally entered operation at about the same time, and proved to have disappointing performance.

Team members convinced Norris that the 8600 could be completed even without Cray, and work continued at the Chippewa Lab. By 1974, the machine still didn&#x27;t work correctly. Jim Thornton&#x27;s competing STAR design had reached production quality at this point, and the 8600 project was then cancelled. In service STAR proved to have poor real-world performance, and when the Cray-1 entered the market in 1976, CDC was quickly pushed from the supercomputer market. An effort was made to re-enter the market in the 1980s with the ETA-10, but this ended poorly.

==Notes==
*Gordon Bell puts the project start at 1968, while the only mention at the former Cray museum states it was 1970.
*Quoted memory speed varies widely, with some sources suggesting a 22 ns cycle time for the semiconductor and 20 ns for the core, while other suggest the higher numbers used in this article. Nor is it clear if the core memory was designed as a backup, or that the semiconductor memory came along later.

<text>Oliver Beene is an American sitcom that aired on Fox from March 9, 2003 to September 12, 2004. The show was created by Howard Gewirtz. Set in 1962 and 1963, the show chronicled the trials and tribulations of the 11-to-12-year-old Oliver Beene (played by Grant Rosenmeyer), in first person perspective. &quot;Oliver Beene&quot;&#x27;s other main characters are his parents Jerry and Charlotte Beene, his older brother Ted Beene, and his two friends Joyce and Michael. The narrator, an older Oliver reflecting on his experience, is voiced by David Cross. Often in episodes, the story is interrupted by flashbacks and flashforwards.

==Premise==

==Episodes==
The series first aired on March 9, 2003, as a Fox program to replace the animated series &quot;Futurama&quot;. The first season was relatively successful, and the show was brought back for a second season. However, poor ratings throughout the second season led to the show&#x27;s cancellation in September 2004, with the two last episodes of the season being left unaired in America. (the last episode to air in the show&#x27;s original timeslot was broadcast on September 12, 2004). In the UK and Ireland, Sky One broadcast both seasons, in their entirety. In Germany, Das Erste HD broadcast both seasons, in their entirety, twice, once in 2006, and once in 2010, dubbed in German. In The Czech Republic, ČT1 broadcast both seasons, in their entirety, dubbed in Czech.

<text>Hallmark Channel is an American cable television network owned by Hallmark Media, a subsidiary of Hallmark Cards. The channel broadcasts family-oriented general entertainment programming, including television series and made-for-TV movies.

The channel has its origins in the religious broadcasters American Christian Television System (ACTS) and the Vision Interfaith Satellite Network (VISN). The two services timeshared on a single satellite signal, which was later rebranded as The Faith &amp; Values Channel in 1993. After Liberty Media acquired a 49% stake in the channel in 1996, it relaunched as the Odyssey Network. As Odyssey, the channel gradually phased out religious programming in favor of family-oriented films and television series—a pivot that intensified after Hallmark Entertainment and The Jim Henson Company acquired major stakes in the channel in 1998.

In 2001, after a corporate reorganization, Odyssey rebranded as Hallmark Channel. By the 2010s, Hallmark Channel had established a focus on made-for-TV movies—particularly romance films and comedies—themed around specific seasons and holidays throughout the year. The strategy sought to create synergies with Hallmark&#x27;s core greeting card business, and build upon the strength of the &quot;Countdown to Christmas&quot; programming event it first introduced in 2009.

In 2019, &quot;The New Yorker&quot; magazine published an article about the Hallmark Channel and its dominance over North American cable television and the cable industry using Christmas themed movies to gain popularity. , Hallmark Channel is available to approximately 70,000,000 pay television households in the United States—down from its 2015 peak of 90,000,000 households.

==History==

The Hallmark Channel traces its history to the launch of two separate religious cable channels, the American Christian Television System (ACTS) and the Vision Interfaith Satellite Network (VISN). The two networks began alternating time on a shared transponder slot on the Galaxy III satellite in 1992. Under the original timeshare agreement, the network was branded as VISN/ACTS. Each network was provided time for its programming blocks, and would use their own logos.

VISN launched on July 1, 1988, and was founded by the National Interfaith Cable Coalition (NICC), in cooperation with several cable providers. The coalition&#x27;s membership consisted of 65 different religious groups. It aired for about 16 hours a day and ran religious programs from mainline Protestant denominations such as the United Methodist Church, the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America and the United Church of Christ. In addition, Roman Catholic, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Jewish, and Islamic faiths also provided some programming. VISN aired during the morning and evening hours. ACTS commenced operations in 1984, and was owned by the Southern Baptist Convention. It aired programming from evangelical and fundamentalist non-charismatic Christian groups such as the SBC, the Christian Reformed Church, and the Association of Regular Baptist Churches, as well as well-known evangelists such as Jerry Falwell, Charles Stanley and D. James Kennedy. Both channels aired several hours a week of religious children&#x27;s programs, some of which overlapped, including &quot;Sunshine Factory&quot;, &quot;Joy Junction&quot;, &quot;Davey and Goliath&quot;, and &quot;Jot&quot;.

In 1993, VISN-ACTS was relaunched as the Faith &amp; Values Channel; it began adding a few secular programs during this time, including news, information, and lifestyle programming

===Odyssey Network===
In 1995, cable conglomerate Tele-Communications Inc.&#x27;s Liberty Media acquired a 49% ownership stake in the Faith &amp; Values Channel, and took over operational control of the network. It added more secular programming to the network and reduced religious programming to about 10 hours a day. In 1996, the network was rebranded as the Odyssey Network (although on-air promotions often referred to the network simply as &quot;Odyssey&quot;), and launched a website, Odysseyfamily.com.
Hallmark Entertainment and The Jim Henson Company bought significant stakes, paid partly through programming commitments, in Odyssey in late 1998; by this time, Odyssey carried a mix of religious programming and family-friendly secular shows, with a limited amount of original productions. Liberty had convinced Hallmark not to launch its own domestic channel, citing difficulty in getting carriage for a new network on existing cable systems. The NICC and Hallmark-Henson would hold equal shares while Liberty increased their stake, and the three groups shared control of the board. Hallmark and Henson would have say over chief executive selection. While adding Henson&#x27;s and Hallmark&#x27;s libraries, the channel could not make major programming format changes, so cable systems could not drop them. Hallmark hired former Fox Kids Network worldwide vice-chairman Margaret Loesch that year to overhaul Odyssey into a family channel (Loesch had quit Fox in late 1997, ironically after acquiring Odyssey&#x27;s rival, The Family Channel, with plans to revamp that network; however, she had to wait out a non-compete clause in her contract before officially joining Odyssey).

Under the new ownership structure, Odyssey underwent a major programming revamp on April 4, 1999; the revamp decreased the amount of religious programs on the network down to an average of four hours a day, although more hours were religious on the weekend. The channel began to focus more on family-targeted entertainment programming, including classic sitcoms and variety series (such as &quot;ALF&quot; and &quot;The Muppet Show&quot;), children&#x27;s programs (such as &quot;The Archie Show&quot;, &quot;Fraggle Rock&quot;, and &quot;Zoobilee Zoo&quot;), and family-oriented films and miniseries (such as the cable broadcast premiere of Hallmark and Henson&#x27;s 1996 adaptation of &quot;Gulliver&#x27;s Travels&quot;). The afternoon block &quot;Leonard Maltin Presents&quot; featured films from the RHI Entertainment-owned Hal Roach Studios library, while Wednesday nights featured classic &quot;Hallmark Hall of Fame&quot; productions.

Loesch explained that the three owners shared a commitment to &quot;quality programming&quot; and &quot;raising the bar on television&quot;, and that the channel was being programmed in a direction reminiscent of television in the 1950s and 1960s, where broadcasters &quot;really had quite broad fare, but you never had to ask anyone to leave the room, like your children&quot;.

===Hallmark Channel===
In 2000, Odyssey&#x27;s ownership group was re-organized as Crown Media Holdings, with Hallmark, Chase Equity Associates, Liberty Media, and the NICC transferring their shares in Odyssey to the company. There were plans for the company to go public; Hallmark received all of Crown Media&#x27;s class B shares, which were worth ten votes each, thus giving it control of Crown Media. After The Jim Henson Company was sold to German company EM.TV &amp; Merchandising in February 2000, it sold its remaining stake in Odyssey the following month in exchange for 8% of Crown Media&#x27;s stock.

In March 2001, Crown Media announced that Odyssey would rebrand as Hallmark Channel on August 6, taking advantage of the better-known Hallmark brand to encourage wider carriage. Loesch commented that some viewers had mistaken Odyssey as being a travel or science fiction channel rather than family entertainment, and that Hallmark Channel&#x27;s main goal would be telling &quot;great stories&quot;. Crown Media negotiated with the NICC to reduce the amount of religious programming Hallmark Channel would air to 14 hours per-week (as well as allow for less overtly-religious programs with broader, spiritual themes), and help fund and distribute a digital cable network for the NICC. The channel&#x27;s launch programming included the miniseries &quot;The Infinite Worlds of H.G. Wells&quot;, a new slate of original movies, and acquired programming such as &quot;Tales from the Neverending Story&quot;.
In 2002, the Hallmark Channel premiered a weekday morning talk show, &quot;New Morning&quot;. A Sunday morning version, hosted by Naomi Judd, titled &quot;Naomi&#x27;s New Morning&quot;, debuted in 2005 and lasted two years before being pulled from the schedule in early 2007. In 2004, the network launched a sister channel, Hallmark Movie Channel.

Hallmark Channels in international markets were sold for about $242 million in 2005 to Sparrowhawk Media, a private equity group backed by Providence Equity Partners and 3i. The channel in 2005 had its highest-rated year with 34% increase in viewers, being ranked seventh in growth, and the highest-rated movie on a basic cable network (&quot;Meet the Santas&quot;).

With the expiration of RHI Entertainment&#x27;s exclusive contract with Hallmark Channel, Larry Levinson Productions became the channel&#x27;s sole producer. In 2007, additional producers were added as suppliers as the channel increased the number of original films by 50% from 20 in 2007 to 30 in 2008.

In January 2008, the Hillary Clinton presidential campaign purchased an hour of Hallmark Channel&#x27;s primetime slots under a paid programming arrangement to run a town hall special promoting Clinton&#x27;s campaign for President of the United States on February 4, the day before the multi-state &quot;Super Tuesday&quot; primaries. The wheel series &quot;Mystery Movie&quot; was discontinued in 2008 as the channel was doing better with lighter romances. Reporting on Hallmark Channel&#x27;s 2009 upfronts, &quot;The New York Observer&quot; noted that the channel had built a brand on formulaic romantic movies, explaining that &quot;while other media companies were thrashing around in a tumultuous, confusing sea of unpredictability, the Hallmark Channel was thriving with the television equivalent of comfort food.&quot;

=== Bill Abbott era, Martha Stewart agreement ===
In May 2009, William J. &quot;Bill&quot; Abbott—who had previously held an advertising sales role—succeeded Henry Schleiff as president of Hallmark Channel. Abbott planned to retool its programming to appeal to younger viewers without alienating its core audience of baby boomers, aiming for Hallmark Channel to become &quot;a destination for lighter fare, for comedies and quality programming&quot;, and for its programming to be &quot;true&quot; to the Hallmark brand. In a 2019 interview, Abbott explained of these goals that &quot;you should turn on our channel and almost feel like you’re walking into a [Hallmark Gold Crown] store.&quot; The channel also began to experiment with abbreviated commercial breaks featuring one 30-second advertisement, with these slots costing twice the amount of a normal 30-second slot.

Later that year, Hallmark Channel held the inaugural &quot;Countdown to Christmas&quot;—a seasonal programming event featuring four original holiday film premieres, and a &quot;Movie Night with Hoops &amp; Yoyo&quot; block on Friday nights—the first cross-promotional campaign between Hallmark Channel and Hallmark Cards.

In January 2010, Hallmark Channel announced a multi-year strategic partnership with Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia (MSLO), under which first-run episodes of &quot;The Martha Stewart Show&quot; would move from syndication to Hallmark Channel beginning that September, and MSLO would produce a series of primetime specials for the channel (which would begin with specials focused on Halloween and Christmas). It was reported that Abbott had sought to reposition Hallmark Channel as a lifestyle-oriented channel to compete with the Scripps Networks Interactive channels, and shift its television films exclusively to Hallmark Movie Channel to appeal to younger demographics.

On March 16, 2010, Hallmark Channel also acquired rights to MSLO library content, announcing a daily daytime block (lasting for seven hours on weekdays, and a shorter block on weekends) of these programs beginning March 26. Crown Media and MSLO were also reportedly exploring the formation of a lifestyle cable network as a joint venture, tentatively named &quot;Hallmark Home&quot;. In June 2010, the channel ordered several additional MSLO-produced series to accompany &quot;Martha&quot;, including &quot;Mad Hungry with Lucinda&quot; and &quot;Whatever with Alexis and Jennifer.&quot;

Due to low viewership, Hallmark shortened the Martha Stewart block by two hours in October 2010. At least 500 hours of new original programming was slated for the 2011–12 season, including 25 original movies, 160 hours of MSLO programming (including new series &quot;Emeril&#x27;s Table&quot;, and additional &quot;Martha Presents&quot; specials), and a series in development with poet Maya Angelou. In addition, &quot;Hallmark Hall of Fame&quot; productions would air on Hallmark Channel a week after their television premieres on ABC.

In January 2012, &quot;Martha&quot; was cancelled by Hallmark Channel due to its high production costs, with production ending after the conclusion of its then-current season. Hallmark Channel was still in discussions over the fate of its other MSLO-produced programming. During its upfronts for the 2012–13 season, Hallmark Channel announced the new daytime talk shows &quot;Home &amp; Family&quot; and &quot;Marie!&quot; with Marie Osmond, as well as a slate of original movies that would include pilots for adaptations of the novels &quot;Cedar Cove&quot; and &quot;When Calls the Heart&quot;. In October 2012, ahead of the January 2013 premiere of its pilot movie, &quot;Cedar Cove&quot; was given a series order as Hallmark Channel&#x27;s first original primetime program. &quot;When Calls the Heart&quot; was also picked up as a series in 2013, while &quot;Marie!&quot; was canceled after one season.

On March 15, 2013, the channel introduced a new family-oriented Friday night movie block, &quot;Walden Family Theater&quot;, in partnership with Walden Media and others. In April 2014, the channel launched a TV Everywhere video on-demand service, &quot;Hallmark Channel Everywhere&quot;, which offers a streaming selection of Hallmark Channel films and series for subscribers on participating television providers. At some point before July 2021, the name of the app was changed to &quot;Hallmark TV&quot;.

=== Focus on seasonal programming ===
In the 2014–15 season, &quot;Hallmark Hall of Fame&quot; premieres moved exclusively to Hallmark Channel, with up to four new films scheduled per-year. Two new series, &quot;Good Witch&quot; and &quot;Signed, Sealed, Delivered&quot;, were picked up for the 2014–15 season. In February 2015, Hallmark Channel held an inaugural &quot;Countdown to Valentine&#x27;s&quot; event to build off the success of Countdown to Christmas, featuring four movie premieres.

In 2015, Mariah Carey directed and starred in a Christmas movie for Hallmark. She also hosted &quot;Mariah Carey&#x27;s Merriest Christmas&quot;, which was the channel&#x27;s most-viewed show. Thus in May 2016, Carey signed a three-film deal for her to develop, executive-produce, direct, co-star, and write an original song for three movies with one for &quot;Countdown to Valentine&#x27;s Day&quot;. The channel&#x27;s first &quot;Winterfest&quot; seasonal programming was in January 2016. At its March 2016 upfronts, Hallmark Channel executives revealed that they planned to divide their programming into themed seasons year-round, to build upon the success of Countdown to Christmas and other franchises.

On October 20, 2016, Hallmark Channel and the Hallmark Movies &amp; Mysteries channel were added to the Sling TV service. On November 15, 2017, PlayStation Vue added Hallmark Channel, Hallmark Movies &amp; Mysteries, and Hallmark Drama to its lineup.

In October 2017, Hallmark Channel launched a new, over-the-top subscription service known as Hallmark Movies Now, which features new and existing original content from the network. In October 2018, the three Hallmark linear channels were added to streaming service Philo.

In November 2017, the channel beat all four major broadcast networks in the ratings one night with its &quot;Hallmark Hall of Fame&quot; movie, &quot;The Christmas Train&quot;. In March 2019, Hallmark announced it had dropped Lori Loughlin from future company projects due to her role in the 2019 college admissions bribery scandal.

In December 2019, the channel stopped airing advertisements for the online wedding registry Zola.com that included two brides kissing each other, because of complaints that it was lesbians kissing and promoted same-sex marriages. A main complainant was One Million Moms, a division of the socially conservative American Family Association, which has been described as an anti-LGBTQ hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center. Similar advertisements with heterosexual couples kissing were not pulled. As a result, social media users called for a boycott of the channel, while competitors like Netflix and the Disney-owned Freeform cable channel responded by touting their LGBTQ inclusivity. On December 15, Hallmark reversed its decision and said it would reinstate the advertisements and work with GLAAD, an LGBTQ media monitoring organization, to create more inclusive programming. The series finale of &quot;Good Witch&quot;, which aired in July 2021, featured the first lesbian kiss in a Hallmark production.

Abbott quietly and abruptly stepped down as president of Hallmark Channel in February 2020; the following year, a group led by Abbott acquired the Southern lifestyle channel Great American Country (GAC) from Discovery, Inc. to relaunch it as a direct competitor to Hallmark, Great American Family. The channel has emulated the programming strategies that were mounted by Hallmark Channel under Abbott, and has also leveraged talent who had been associated with the channel&#x27;s original productions.

On October 31, 2022, Hallmark announced a distribution agreement with NBCUniversal, under which live and on-demand programming from its networks would be available to Peacock subscribers.

==Programming==

Hallmark Channel&#x27;s programming consists of original dramas and made-for-TV movies, and syndicated reruns of sitcoms. It also airs the &quot;Hallmark Hall of Fame&quot; anthology series.

Despite largely being an apolitical brand, Hallmark Channel has garnered a following among politically conservative viewers in suburban and rural areas who, according to Manhattan Institute for Policy Research&#x27;s Steven Malanga in a &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; op-ed, feel the network and its original programming feed their desire to &quot;express traditional family values and also to steer away from political themes and stories that denigrate religion.&quot;

===Original movies===

The network&#x27;s made-for-TV movies are characterized as family-friendly and inspirational, ranging from holiday-themed films to westerns. In the early stages of the channel&#x27;s development, Hallmark Channel had a steady one-movie-a-month, or 12-a-year, production schedule with the films mainly being produced by RHI Entertainment. However, in 2008, Crown Media had ramped up its production schedule to approximately 30 movies a year and opened up two other production companies, though RHI still produces some movies for Hallmark Channel. The network premiered 35 original movies during the period from 2009 to 2010, with production ramping up further in the years that followed.

Hallmark original movies were budgeted at $2.2 million in 2007. Hallmark does not pay the full cost of films, thus they are often deficit-financed by their producers. Many of Hallmark Channel&#x27;s productions are produced in Canada, using local talent and filming locations (including a preference towards location shoots instead of sound stages) to reduce production costs. A number of actors and actresses have become known for frequent appearances in Hallmark Channel movies.

&quot;The New Yorker&quot; felt that the often-formulaic structure of Hallmark&#x27;s films contributed to their popularity, describing them as usually featuring &quot;independent women with interesting jobs&quot;, &quot;appealing romantic prospects&quot;, and often being set in towns where residents &quot;care for one another, run viable small businesses, and compete in gingerbread bake-offs—America as we might wish it were, and as some believe it once was.&quot;

====Series====
* &quot;Hallmark Hall of Fame&quot;: Originally only an encore or library home for the &quot;Hallmark Hall of Fame&quot; anthology film series, the series moved its original showings to the channel in 2014.
* &quot;Mystery Movie&quot; (also &quot;Hallmark Channel Mystery Wheel&quot;): The channel began a Sunday night mystery movie wheel series called &quot;Mystery Movie&quot; in 2004. This wheel series consisted of four individual movie series of four films that would also be later shown on Hallmark Movie Channel. Two of the film series were &quot;Mystery Woman&quot; and &quot;Jane Doe&quot;. A successor series, &quot;Original Mystery Wheel&quot;, was established in 2015 on the Hallmark Movies &amp; Mysteries channel.
* &quot;Walden Family Theater&quot; (2013) On March 15, 2013, the channel started its family friendly Friday night movie series, &quot;Walden Family Theater&quot; in partnership with Walden Media, Arc Entertainment, Procter &amp; Gamble and Walmart. P&amp;G and Walmart were sponsoring partners with Walmart selling the movies DVD in store the Tuesday after airing, while Arc and Walden were producing partners. The first movie was the world premiere of &quot;Return to Nim&#x27;s Island&quot;, one of six new films produced for the series. &quot;Space Warriors&quot; was shown later in the premier season, with additional films drawn from Hallmark&#x27;s library of films. The series&#x27; second season was launched on September 6, 2013, with the premiere of the film, &quot;Dear Dumb Diary&quot; based upon the Scholastic book, with the Civil Rights era drama &quot;The Watsons Go to Birmingham&quot; premiering next.

===Seasonal programming===
Hallmark Channel is known for scheduling themed programming around major holidays such as Christmas, Mother&#x27;s Day, and Valentine&#x27;s Day—including new original movies relevant to said holiday, in addition to the prime wedding season in the month of June. With the introduction of its &quot;Countdown to Christmas&quot; branding in 2009, the channel gradually expanded the number of seasonal programming events it holds. By 2016, the network had divided its schedule into themed &quot;seasons&quot; year-round, with original programming aligned with these themes. Crown Media&#x27;s then-CEO Bill Abbott explained that this strategy allowed the network to be positioned as &quot;a year-round destination for celebrations&quot;, which need not depend on a single series or franchise to bolster its viewership. This programming strategy also creates synergies with Hallmark Cards.
* &quot;New Year New Movies!&quot; is broadcast in January; it features movies with a winter theme, but not necessarily tied to the Christmas and holiday season (as with Countdown to Christmas). The event was previously known as &quot;Winterfest&quot; from 2016 to 2020.
* &quot;Loveuary&quot;, formerly &quot;Countdown To Valentine&#x27;s Day&quot; (2015–2019) and &quot;Love Ever After&quot; (2020–2021), is broadcast in February. In 2015, the event was 15 days long with four original movie premieres.
* &quot;Spring into Love&quot;, formerly &quot;Spring Fling&quot; and &quot;Spring Fever&quot;, is broadcast in March and April.
* &quot;Countdown to Summer&quot; was a one time event with 5 movies in May 2020.
* &quot;Summer Nights&quot; (2016–present) is broadcast June through August. In 2017, Summer Nights movies were only shown in August. In 2018 and 2019, Summer Nights movies were shown in July and August. In 2020, there were only three Summer Nights movies in August to go along with the five Countdown to Summer movies in May. In 2021, Summer Nights movies were split up into 2 parts, with the first part being all in June, then taking over a month break, with the second part starting the last week of July, going through all of August, and ending the first week of September.
* &quot;June Weddings&quot; (2017–2019) was broadcast in June. It was on hiatus on Hallmark Channel starting in 2020, and made its return in 2023.
* &quot;Fall Harvest&quot; (2015–present) airs during September and most of October, primarily airing autumn-themed movies (sometimes relating to Halloween). In 2016 and 2019, Fall Harvest movies only aired in October. 
* &quot;Five Nights Stuffed Full of Original Holiday Movies&quot; (2015–present), which airs near Thanksgiving.

====Countdown to Christmas====
From the last weekend in October until January 1, Hallmark Channel runs an event known as the &quot;Countdown to Christmas&quot;, where the network&#x27;s schedule is devoted to a mix of holiday movies, specials and holiday-themed original programming. The block is branded as &quot;Countdown to New Years&quot; from December 26 until January 1 and culminates with the channel&#x27;s broadcast of the Tournament of Roses Parade. Actresses frequently featured in the channel&#x27;s Christmas films have been promoted as the &quot;Queens of Christmas&quot;, including Rachel Boston, Candace Cameron Bure, Lacey Chabert, Erin Krakow, Kellie Martin, Danica McKellar, Autumn Reeser and Alicia Witt. Hallmark&#x27;s &quot;Christmas TV ratings system&quot; has designations like &quot;F for Family&quot; and &quot;J for Joy&quot;.

The event was introduced in 2009, featuring four original movie premieres. Countdown to Christmas has featured cross-promotion of Hallmark Cards, including having featured the characters of Hoops &amp; Yoyo in promotions, and airing &quot;Jingle All the Way&quot;—a half-hour animated Christmas special featuring the character of Jingle the Husky Pup—in 2011, which marked the first Hallmark Channel original production to be a collaboration with a Hallmark Cards property. By 2013, the event featured 12 new movies.

Since 2012, the network has held a Christmas in July event with airings of past Hallmark Channel Christmas movies, which is used to promote Hallmark Cards&#x27; collectibles for the upcoming season. In 2013, the event included holiday tips from the cast of &quot;Home &amp; Family&quot;. In 2014, the event added a theatrical movie premiere. By 2015, the event included one new original movie.

In 2014, Hallmark Channel and Hallmark Cards collaborated for the first time on a movie, &quot;Northpole&quot;, which was shown during Countdown to Christmas. The 2014 movie &quot;Christmas Under Wraps&quot;, starring Candace Cameron Bure, became the highest-rated premiere in Hallmark Channel history, with 5.8 million viewers; the success prompted Hallmark Channel to further increase its production of original movies. During the 2017 holiday season, Hallmark Channel premiered 33 original Christmas holiday films, up from a total of 28 holiday movies in 2016. As of 2017, Hallmark had a total of 136 Christmas holiday-themed movies in their original library of films. That year, it introduced the &quot;Christmas in Evergreen&quot; franchise, which was based on a Hallmark greeting card line.

For 2018, a satellite radio companion to the event was carried on Sirius XM—&quot;Hallmark Channel Radio&quot;—which carried Christmas music hosted by Hallmark Channel talent (such as Holly Robinson Peete and Lacey Chabert), and behind-the-scenes features relating to Countdown to Christmas programming. In honor of the franchise&#x27;s 10th anniversary, Countdown to Christmas movies aired on Friday nights throughout 2019, and a &quot;Hallmark Channel Christmas Con&quot; was held in Edison, New Jersey in November 2019, featuring appearances by Hallmark Channel talent.&quot;&quot;

===Animal special franchise===
With the success of the Dog Hero Awards, the channel started a franchise out of the show with additional shows that counterprogram major sporting events. Beyond the Dog Hero Awards and the Kitten Bowl, the channel has the Paw-Star Game (counterprogramming the MLB All-Star Game) and the Summer Kitten Games (which had its first edition counterprogram the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro). On February 2, 2014, the Hallmark Channel partnered with New York&#x27;s North Shore Animal League and Last Hope Animal Rescue to debut the &quot;Kitten Bowl&quot; during Super Bowl XLVIII. The event – hosted by Beth Stern and announcers John Sterling and Mary Carillo – is designed as counterprogramming to the Super Bowl and airs during the game&#x27;s halftime show, and is similar to another animal-themed event that debuted nine years earlier on Animal Planet, the Puppy Bowl. &quot;Kitten Bowl II&quot; returned on February 1, 2015, and was watched by 1.3 million viewers. A new Kitten Bowl has aired every year since, running repeatedly on Super Bowl Sunday in a three-hour program that includes &quot;playoff games&quot;. In 2019, the first edition of the &quot;Cat Bowl&quot; was shown during that year’s Super Bowl. The eighth and last edition of the Kitten Bowl aired in 2021 as Hallmark canceled it the next year.

=== Content standards ===
The Hallmark Channel has been criticized for editing its programming to remove what its Standards and Practices department considers offensive words. After the word &quot;God&quot; was muted in April 2014 from the film &quot;It Could Happen to You&quot;, in what is described as an attempt &quot;to avoid taking His name in vain&quot;, the practice backfired when viewers interpreted the muting as evidence of hatred for God. Blogger Donna Cavanagh criticized the channel&#x27;s content policies in July 2011, describing them as &quot;censorship at its worst&quot;, with removal of profanities or epithets such as &quot;ass&quot; and &quot;hooker&quot;. In response to Cavanagh&#x27;s inquiry, a representative of the network wrote:
Cavanagh accused the network of hypocrisy in deeming such material as being objectionable according to the network&#x27;s standards, while continuing to acquire off-network sitcoms such as &quot;Frasier&quot; and &quot;The Golden Girls&quot;, which often feature sexual content including references to promiscuity. Others have recommended the channel&#x27;s late night programming, while noting that the word removal from these programs &quot;puts a mild damper on the fun.&quot;

==International versions==

Hallmark Channel operated several cable channels in various international markets; they were sold in 2005 to Sparrowhawk Media, which was in turn acquired by Universal Networks International in 2007.

Universal&#x27;s licensing agreement ended in July 2011; the networks were either shut down, or rebranded under another NBC Universal-owned brand (such as Diva Universal, Studio Universal, 13th Street Universal or Universal Channel). In the United Kingdom, the Hallmark Original Movies originally shown on the channel are now shown on Movies 24, a sister to the Hallmark Channel.

On October 25, 2018, Corus Entertainment announced that W Network would become the exclusive Canadian broadcaster of Hallmark Channel original series and films beginning November 1. The agreement includes branded blocks of Hallmark Channel programming, and airings of seasonal events such as Countdown to Christmas (which launched the agreement).

<text>Basque Workers&#x27; Solidarity (in Basque: &quot;Eusko Langileen Alkartasuna&quot; (ELA), in Spanish: &quot;Solidaridad de Trabajadores Vascos&quot; (STV)) is the most influential trade union in Basque Country, having been created, as &quot;Solidaridad de Obreros Vascos&quot;, by members of the Basque Nationalist Party on June 10, 1911, in Bilbao.

==History==

It was opposed to the influence of trade unions who appealed to a working class ethos (Socialist UGT and Anarchist CNT), advocating instead a Basque nationalist outlook. Initially, ELA-STV was centered on projects of mutual assistance between its affiliates, as a vehicle for social security. It expanded with much more success in Guipúzcoa and Biscay than in Navarre and Álava.

ELA-STV was caught in the fighting of the Spanish Civil War, and banned by the Francoist State. It reemerged in 1976, during the transition to democracy. Today, it has over 105,000 members.

In the 70&#x27;s ELA abandoned its original social-christian ideology in favour of more socialist positions, recognizing the importance and validity of the class struggle, breaking with the Basque Nationalist Party and approaching LAB, a union within the abertzale left.

In the General Congress of 1976 ELA-STV approved the new principles and rules of the union, which will become its identity: ELA was a Basque national and class union, independent from all political parties, open to all workers of Euskal Herria, economic independence (funding only through membership fees, not accepting public money), incompatibility of positions, confederal basis, creating a common strike fund, international solidarity, etc. This line will be ratified and will gain further in the coming Congress. During the transition, ELA opposed the Moncloa Pacts. The pro-PNV and anti-socialist wing of the union split and formed Eusko Langillen Alkartasuna (Askatuta) – Solidaridad de Trabajadores Vascos (Independiente) (ELA (a)-STV (i)), which would disappear in 1990.

==Strike fund==
ELA&#x27;s strike fund is unusual in Spanish unionism.
Only USO among the main Spanish unions provides one.
According to ELA, the fund received 13.7 million euros between 2008 and 2011, 15.1% of its expenses, and 19.1 M€ between 2012 and 2016 (16,24%).

<text>The 1992 Summer Olympics, officially known as the Games of the XXV Olympiad, and officially branded as Barcelona &#x27;92, were an international multi-sport event held in Barcelona, Spain, from 25 July to 9 August 1992. A total of 9,356 athletes representing 169 National Olympic Committees (NOCs) participated. The games featured 257 events in 25 sports and 34 disciplines. Badminton, baseball, and women&#x27;s judo were included as official medal events for the first time.

Following the dissolution of the Soviet Union, athletes from twelve of the fifteen former Soviet republics competed together as part of the Unified Team. Two other Soviet republics, Estonia and Latvia, competed independently for the first time since 1936, while Lithuania did so for the first time since 1928. South Africa, which had been excluded from the Olympics for its use of the apartheid system in sports, returned to the games for the first time since 1960.

Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, and Slovenia competed independently, as opposed to as a part of Yugoslavia, for the first time following the breakup of Yugoslavia. Due to conduct in the ongoing Yugoslav Wars, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia was placed under sanctions by United Nations Security Council Resolution 757, which prevented the country from taking part in the Olympics. Individual Yugoslav athletes were allowed to take part as independent participants and, with Macedonian athletes who could not appear under their own flag because their NOC had not yet been formed, combined to form the Independent Olympic Participants team. East and West Germany also competed together for the first time since 1964, following the German reunification.

Athletes representing 64 NOCs received at least one medal, with 37 NOCs winning at least one gold medal. The Unified Team won the most gold medals, with 45, and the most overall medals, with 112. Algeria, Indonesia, and Lithuania won their nations&#x27; first Summer Olympic gold medals. It was also the first Olympic medal of any kind for Lithuania. Croatia, Israel, Malaysia, Namibia, Qatar, and Slovenia won their nation&#x27;s first Olympic medals. Unified Team gymnast Vitaly Scherbo won the most gold and overall medals among individual participants, with six (all gold).

==Medal table==


The medal table is based on information provided by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and is consistent with IOC conventional sorting in its published medal tables. The table uses the Olympic medal table sorting method. By default, the table is ordered by the number of gold medals the athletes from a nation have won, where a nation is an entity represented by a NOC. The number of silver medals is taken into consideration next and then the number of bronze medals. If teams are still tied, equal ranking is given and they are listed alphabetically by their IOC country code.

In gymnastics events, there were eight ties for medals. Two gold medals and no silver medals were awarded due to first-place ties in the men&#x27;s pommel horse and women&#x27;s vault events. Two silver medals and no bronze medals were awarded due to second-place ties in the men&#x27;s floor, men&#x27;s horizontal bar, and women&#x27;s balance beam events. Three bronze medals were awarded due to third-place ties in the men&#x27;s parallel bars and women&#x27;s floor events, while two bronze medals were awarded in the men&#x27;s rings event.

In women&#x27;s solo synchronized swimming there was also a two-way tie for first, which resulted in two gold medals and no silver medals being awarded.

Events in boxing and tennis resulted in bronze medals being awarded to each of the competitors who lost their semi-final matches, as opposed to them taking part in a third place tiebreaker. Events in judo used a repechage system which also resulted in two bronze medals being awarded.

<text>The Grammy Award for Best Boxed or Special Limited Edition Package has been presented since 1995 to an album&#x27;s art directors. The award is not bestowed upon the artist unless they are also a credited art director.

The award year reflects the year of presentation, not the year the work was actually released. The award category has previously been known as Best Recording Package – Boxed (1995–1997) and Best Boxed Recording Package (1998–2002). Usually, five nominees are presented; though in 2016, the number of nominees was six.

Years reflect the year in which the Grammy Awards were presented, for works released in the previous year.
